She is known for her lectures on sex education in Islam.\n\nShe holds a PhD degree in Islamic studies from the University of Glasgow, Scotland and was formerly a lecturer and assistant professor at the Faculty of Usul-al-Din at International Islamic University, Islamabad. Hashmi founded Al-Huda International Welfare Foundation in 1994. The foundation started a number of schools to teach the Quran and Hadith to women in order to \"help women become better observant muslims by helping them understand the Quran\". The foundation now runs a network of schools, seminaries and social welfare projects. In 2004, the foundation established the Al-Huda Institute in Mississauga (Toronto area), Ontario, Canada. This institute offers courses on exegesis of the Quran and Hadith and attracts students from a number of foreign countries such as Australia.\n\nShe has gained popularity as a feminist scholar both in Pakistan and abroad, as evidenced by crowds of up to ten thousand that attend her religious lessons, called \"dars\" : the number of women who got a diploma or certificate are estimated to be around 15 000 while those who followed her courses without formally enrolling are even more numerous. Most followers come from liberal, literate and modern backgrounds; and most are women. She has stated that her mission is to bring a renewal in Islam, through better understanding of the core scriptures. In contrast to rigid and confrontational styles of proselytising, Hashmi has emphasized the need for her students to engage in voluntarily educating others through their examples.\n\nFarhat Hashmi was born in Sargodha, Punjab, on December 22, 1957. Her father, Abdur Rehman Hashmi, was a Muslim scholar, and the local leader of the Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan. She was educated at a local school; then studied at the Government College for women Sargodha and ultimately completed her Master's degree in Arabic Language from the University of Punjab, Lahore. Her religious education occurred at her home where she was taught the tenets of Islam by her father. She married a fellow scholar of Hadith Muhammad Idrees Zubair and the couple took up posts of lecturers at the International Islamic University (IIU), Islamabad. Soon after they moved to Scotland where they enrolled in the doctorate programme of Islamic studies. During this time, they both travelled to Turkey, Jordan, Syria, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.\n\nShe emigrated to Canada in 2005.\n\nWhile teaching at the International Islamic University, Hashmi had started informal religious classes for women. Upon returning to Pakistan she launched Al-Huda International; a non-government welfare trust which seeks to educate women as to how they can interpret and then employ Islamic principles in their daily lives. The establishment of a progressive school purely for women, by a female Islamic scholar was seen by some as a direct response to large seminaries, which women had come to view as being regressive and highly politicised. Hashmi has been noted for her nontraditional style of teaching and original lectures which focus on feminism. She utilizes modern methods of teaching in her lectures and is multilingual in Urdu, Arabic and English, so her female students; a large of whom come from educated, urban families, are able to relate with her. Academic studies have shown that the innovative techniques of teaching introduced by Hashmi are one of the reasons for the institute's popularity.\n\nHashmi began her career as a television preacher on Geo TV, where she hosted the programme Shahru Ramadan during the month of Ramadhan. She also appeared in the programme The Quran & You on Aag TV. She continued to give lectures on exegesis of the Quran on Geo in the show Fahm ul Quran. More recently her lectures have been broadcast as standalone episodes. During her television shows, she appears on air covered with an Islamic veil and niqab; while giving her lectures from her laptop. This has been termed as an \"image that projects the confluence of pious traditionalism and media savvy prosperity\".\n\nShe favours greater participation of women in day to day matters of faith, and is of the view that women should be able to pray outside their homes, and they should be able to lead their own prayers. According to Hashmi, women can touch and recite the Quran during their menstrual periods, wearing gloves (either when learning Quran from a teacher or teaching Quran to others), traditionally considered by some to be prohibited. Some other scholars are supportive of her views.\n\nHashmi advocates for a revival of Islam and encourages her followers to interpret the Qur'an for themselves supporting their views with strong evidence. She urges her followers to focus on becoming better Muslims and her lectures are focused on family structures. This view is criticized by her critics, who claim that her religious \"Dars\" \"center around personal and family development, rather than community service\". Hashmi, however, argues that if all of her students undergo a transformation for the better, their personal transformation will be reflected on a national and a global scale.\n\nHashmi is in favour of establishing the Sharia Law in Canada. Her views on domestic matters are in accordance with her interpretation of the Sharia Law. According to Hashmi, both men and women have specific spheres of influence within the society. Typically men are the ones who work outside the house, while women work within. However, Hashmi argues that these roles are not set in stone and if a person has fulfilled his or her role, they can help the other in their duties as well. This, and her other arguments which call for women to work outside the roles that have been designated to them by rigid traditionalist scholars, have drawn considerable ire from conservative, right wing scholars. Hashmi considers polygamy to be legal, and has preached that Muslim women should let their husbands marry a second time so “other sisters can also benefit”. This saves men from having a nonmarital relationship, which is forbidden according to the Quran.\n\nHashmi has been criticised by some Islamic clerics who believe that a woman cannot become an Islamic scholar and interpreter of Quran.\n\nShe also has been criticized by some ultra-conservative, right-wing preachers and puritan men for breaking gender roles in Islam, especially on her views about women teaching and preaching outside the home. Other conservative sources have criticized her devotees of \"wearing western clothes\", of consuming western products and holding informal women-only gatherings. They have also criticized her for using the internet and audiovisual aids in preaching, methods that they deem as western.\n\nLiberal and secular outlets have criticized her for \"not going far enough\" in her progressive interpretation of Islam. She has also been criticized for allowing polygamy. Due to her unbending religious doctrines she has been termed a Wahabi by some liberal activists like Raheel Raza. Although Hashmi and Al-Huda have stated that they do not follow any particular sect of contemporary Islam and refer to themselves simply as Muslims as was done during the time of early Islam.\n\n\n"}

Their aim is to demonstrate that the process that drives evolutionary systems—random variation combined with non-random cumulative selection—is different from pure chance.\n\nThe thought experiment was formulated by Richard Dawkins, and the first simulation written by him; various other implementations of the program have been written by others.\n\nIn chapter 3 of his book \"The Blind Watchmaker\", Dawkins gave the following introduction to the program, referencing the well-known infinite monkey theorem:\n\nThe scenario is staged to produce a string of gibberish letters, assuming that the selection of each letter in a sequence of 28 characters will be random. The number of possible combinations in this random sequence is 27, or about 10, so the probability that the monkey will produce a given sequence is extremely low. Any particular sequence of 28 characters could be selected as a \"target\" phrase, all equally as improbable as Dawkins's chosen target, \"METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL\".\n\nA computer program could be written to carry out the actions of Dawkins's hypothetical monkey, continuously generating combinations of 26 letters and spaces at high speed. Even at the rate of millions of combinations per second, it is unlikely, even given the entire lifetime of the universe to run, that the program would ever produce the phrase \"METHINKS IT IS LIKE A WEASEL\".\n\nDawkins intends this example to illustrate a common misunderstanding of evolutionary change, i.e. that DNA sequences or organic compounds such as proteins are the result of atoms randomly combining to form more complex structures. In these types of computations, any sequence of amino acids in a protein will be extraordinarily improbable (this is known as Hoyle's fallacy). Rather, evolution proceeds by hill climbing, as in adaptive landscapes.\n\nDawkins then goes on to show that a process of \"cumulative\" selection can take far fewer steps to reach any given target. In Dawkins's words:\n\nBy repeating the procedure, a randomly generated sequence of 28 letters and spaces will be gradually changed each generation. The sequences progress through each generation:\n\nDawkins continues:\n\nThe program aims to demonstrate that the preservation of small changes in an evolving string of characters (or genes) can produce meaningful combinations in a relatively short time as long as there is some mechanism to select cumulative changes, whether it is a person identifying which traits are desirable (in the case of artificial selection) or a criterion of survival (\"fitness\") imposed by the environment (in the case of natural selection). Reproducing systems tend to preserve traits across generations, because the offspring inherit a copy of the parent's traits. It is the differences between offspring, the variations in copying, which become the basis for selection, allowing phrases closer to the target to survive, and the remaining variants to \"die.\"\n\nDawkins discusses the issue of the mechanism of selection with respect to his \"biomorphs\" program:\n\nRegarding the example's applicability to biological evolution, he is careful to point out that it has its limitations:\n\nIn \"The Blind Watchmaker,\" Dawkins goes on to provide a graphical model of gene selection involving entities he calls biomorphs. These are two-dimensional sets of line segments which bear relationships to each other, drawn under the control of \"genes\" that determine the appearance of the biomorph. By selecting entities from sequential generations of biomorphs, an experimenter can guide the evolution of the figures toward given shapes, such as \"airplane\" or \"octopus\" biomorphs.\n\nAs a simulation, the biomorphs are not much closer to the actual genetic behavior of biological organisms. Like the Weasel program, their development is shaped by an external factor, in this case the decisions of the experimenter who chooses which of many possible shapes will go forward into the following generation. They do however serve to illustrate the concept of \"genetic space,\" where each possible gene is treated as a dimension, and the actual genomes of living organisms make up a tiny fraction of all possible gene combinations, most of which will not produce a viable organism. As Dawkins puts it, \"however many ways there may be of being alive, it is certain that there are vastly more ways of being dead\". \n\nIn \"Climbing Mount Improbable\", Dawkins responded to the limitations of the Weasel program by describing programs, written by other parties, that modeled the evolution of the spider web. He suggested that these programs were more realistic models of the evolutionary process, since they had no predetermined goal other than coming up with a web that caught more flies through a \"trial and error\" process. Spiderwebs were seen as good topics for evolutionary modeling because they were simple examples of biosystems that were easily visualized; the modeling programs successfully generated a range of spider webs similar to those found in nature.\n\nAlthough Dawkins did not provide the source code for his program, a \"Weasel\" style algorithm could run as follows.\n\n\nFor these purposes, a \"character\" is any uppercase letter, or a space. The number of copies per generation, and the chance of mutation per letter are not specified in Dawkins's book; 100 copies and a 5% mutation rate are examples. Correct letters are not \"locked\". Each correct letter may become incorrect in subsequent generations. The terms of the program and the existence of the target phrase do however mean that such 'negative mutations' will quickly be 'corrected'.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1851895", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1851895", "title": "Ulu", "text": "Ulu\n\nAn ulu (Inuktitut syllabics: \"ᐅᓗ\", plural: \"uluit\", English: \"woman's knife\") is an all-purpose knife traditionally used by Inuit, Yupik, and Aleut women. It is utilized in applications as diverse as skinning and cleaning animals, cutting a child's hair, cutting food, as a weapon and, if necessary, trimming blocks of snow and ice used to build an igloo.\n\nIn the Nunatsiavummiutut variety of Inuttitut, which is spoken in Nunatsiavut, the word is spelled \"uluk\", and in Tunumiit (\"East Greenlandic\") it is \"sakiaq\" or \"saakiq\".\n\nThe following chart lists both Eskimo-Aleut terms as well as two terms for the same tool in Athabaskan languages, which are an unrelated language family spoken by non-Inuit-Iñupiat-Aleut Alaska Natives.\n\nTraditionally the ulu was made with a caribou antler, muskox horn or walrus ivory handle and slate cutting surface, due to the lack of metal smelting technology in the Arctic. The handle could also be carved from bone, and wood was sometimes used when it was available. In certain areas, such as Ulukhaktok Northwest Territories, copper was used for the cutting surface.\n\nToday the ulu is still often made with a caribou antler handle but the blade is usually made of steel. The steel is quite often obtained by purchasing a hand saw or wood saw and cutting the blade to the correct shape. A hardwood called \"sisattaq\" is also used for handles. These uluit are both kept for home use and sold to others. It is also possible to purchase commercially produced uluit, sometimes made with a plastic handle and complete with a cutting board.\n\nThe size of the ulu typically reflects its usage. An ulu with a blade would be used as part of a sewing kit to cut sinew or for cutting out patterns from animal skins. An ulu with a blade would be used for general purposes. Occasionally, uluit can be found with blades as large as .\n\nThe ulu comes in four distinct styles, the Iñupiat (or Alaskan), Canadian, West Greenlandic and East Greenlandic. With the Inupiat style ulu the blade has a centre piece cut out and both ends of the blade fit into the handle. In Canada the blade more often is attached to the handle by a single stem in the centre. In the western areas of the Canadian Arctic the blade of the ulu tends to be of a triangular shape, while in the eastern Arctic the ends of the blade tend to be more pointed.\n\nThe shape of the ulu ensures that the force is centered more over the middle of the blade than with an ordinary knife. This makes the ulu easier to use when cutting hard objects such as bone. Because the rocking motion used when cutting on a plate or board with an ulu pins down the food being cut, it is also easier to use an ulu one-handed (a typical steak knife, in contrast, requires a fork).\n\nUlu knives are sometimes used for purposes other than their original intent. Because of their cultural symbolism throughout the Arctic, they are sometimes presented to people who have accomplished significant things, such as sports or education. Specifically, the Arctic Winter Games presents gold, silver, and bronze uluit to successful athletes, acting in place of a medal.\n\nUluit have been found that date back to as early as 2500 BCE. Traditionally, the ulu would be passed down from generation to generation. It was believed that an ancestor's knowledge was contained within the ulu and thus would also be passed on.\n\nSome countries, including Canada, prohibit the possession or carrying of knives where the blade is perpendicular to the handle (intended to limit the use of so-called \"push daggers\"). However, regulations passed under the Criminal Code specifically exempt the \"aboriginal 'ulu' knife\" from this prohibition.\n\nUluit are not allowed as carry-on on commercial airline flights in the US, though they can be in checked bags.\n\n"}

The cars are a \"follow-up\" or supplemental stock for the A Division’s R29s and closely resembled them. The cars were also referred to as R33MLs (R33 Main Line) to distinguish them from the R33S's. A total of 500 cars were built, numbered 8806–9305 and arranged in pairs. \n\nThe R33s entered service on November 15, 1962, and were the first A Division fleet to be retrofitted with air conditioning, being retrofitted between 1972 and 1982. The R33 fleet was overhauled between 1987 and 1991. The R33s were replaced in the early 2000s with the delivery of the R142 and R142A cars, with the last train running on April 20, 2003. After being retired, most R33s were sunk into the ocean as artificial reefs, but several cars have survived.\n\nThe first set of R33 cars was placed in service on the train on November 15, 1962. Five hundred cars were built and served on all IRT subway lines. In 1972 they became the first A Division cars to be retrofitted with air conditioning when cars 9086/7, 9118/9, 9162/3, 9226/7, 9282/3, & 9294/5 were retrofitted at the 239th Street Yard with a modified version of the Stone Safety Air conditioning unit designed to fit on the smaller IRT cars, and by 1982 all R33 cars had received air conditioning.

It was created in 2005 to advance transportation science, technology, and analysis, and to improve the coordination of transportation research within the department and throughout the transportation community.\n\nRITA performs four basic functions:\n\nRITA has over 750 employees in Washington, at the Volpe Center (Cambridge, Massachusetts), and at the Transportation Safety Institute (Oklahoma City, OK).\n\nRITA was created by the Norman Y. Mineta Research and Special Program Improvement Act, and opened its doors on February 22, 2005. RITA's formation was part of a Department-wide reorganization to create one agency solely focused on promoting transportation research. In a report titled \"Research Activities of the Department of Transportation: A Report to Congress\", then-Transportation Secretary Mineta promoted his vision for RITA as “A DOT administration that combines research-driven innovation and entrepreneurship to ensure a safe and robust transportation network.”\n\nThe new agency was formed from several existing parts of USDOT:\n\n\nRITA is led by two presidential appointees. Within RITA there are several program offices, which report directly to the Administrator. Those offices are:\n\nRITA's Research, Development, and Technology (RD&T) office's mission is to coordinate research across all modes of transportation and to promote advanced innovative transportation solutions. RD&T coordinates a research planning council, a planning team, and several research clusters that are dedicated to certain multimodal research subjects. The planning council ensures crossmodal collaboration and coordination in research being done with DOT and its partners, and advises the Secretary of Transportation on research issues. The planning team supports the council by reviewing and coordinating departmental research plans and budgets, assessing research, and promoting best practices in research performance and technology transfer.\n\nThe University Transportation Centers Program funds transportation research at 136 colleges and universities and helps advance the education and training needed to support a 21st Century transportation system. Research and education programs provided by UTCs address critical national transportation challenges while developing the next generation of transportation professionals. UTC colleges and universities trained 32,000 practicing transportation professionals in 2009.\n\nThe virtual DOT Center for Climate Change and Environmental Forecasting, an online, interactive knowledge base on transportation and climate change, includes information on greenhouse gas emissions, the potential impacts of climate change on the infrastructure, approaches for integrating climate change considerations into transportation decision making, and ideas for adaptation and mitigation.\n\nThis program develops and validates remote sensing technologies for application to transportation infrastructure in the three major areas listed below. Congress authorized approximately $7 million a year for this work. \n\nEstablished as a policy-neutral statistical agency in 1992, the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) provides comprehensive data about America's transportation networks. The data reveals how people, goods, and vehicles move through the system, as well as measure the impact of social, economic, and environmental factors on system performance. BTS is the source of much of the nation's data on the operations and finances of commercial airlines. BTS also conducts the Commodity Flow Survey, the only nationwide intermodal freight data source.\n\nAs a federal statistical agency, BTS releases data based on a published schedule. BTS issues monthly press releases on the Freight Transportation Services Index, airline traffic, scheduled passenger airline employment and North American surface freight. Quarterly releases are issued on average domestic air fares and airline financials, including baggage fees and reservation change fees. BTS is the source of available statistics on airline on-time data and tarmac data. BTS’ tarmac data was widely used in deliberations on the issue of lengthy tarmac times, which has been well-publicized in the last three years. BTS’ data is the key indicator of the effectiveness of the federal rule implementing a three-hour time limit on planes sitting on the tarmac. The rule went into effect April 29, 2010.\n\nIn May, BTS issues an annual press release on airline employment by job category, with totals for pilots, maintenance workers and outsourcing of maintenance. In November, BTS issues an annual press release on the update of the North American Transportation Statistics Database, a project conducted jointly with Canada, Mexico, and the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nEstablished in 1998, the National Transportation Library is a part of the Bureau of Transportation Statistics that maintains and facilitates access to statistical and other information needed for transportation decision-making at the Federal, state, and local levels. It also coordinates with public and private transportation libraries and information providers to improve information sharing among the transportation community. The NTL's reference staff assists US DOT staff and the general public in locating transportation-related documents and reports, statistics, and subject experts at DOT. Reference staff is available from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. EST to answer telephone calls and emails, or reference requests can be submitted at any time via the web through Ask-A-Librarian.\n\nIntelligent Transportation Systems Joint Program Office (ITS JPO) focuses on intelligent vehicles, intelligent infrastructure and the creation of an intelligent transportation system involving these two components to enhance surface transportation safety and mobility and contribute to America's economic growth. The Federal ITS program supports the overall advancement of ITS through investments in major initiatives, exploratory studies and a deployment support program. Increasingly, the Federal investments are directed at targets of opportunity – major initiatives – that have the potential for significant payoff in improving safety, mobility and productivity. The ITS Program places priority on research in intelligent vehicles, intelligent infrastructure and the development of a nationwide transportation system. The ITS Program supports major investments in technology initiatives, exploratory research, and deployment support activities designed to help state and local jurisdictions optimize technology deployments.\n\nConnected vehicle research is the ITS Joint Program Office's leading initiative. Connected Vehicle Technology is fundamentally about wireless communications between vehicles and other vehicles as well as between vehicles and the surrounding infrastructure such as traffic signals, work zones and grade crossings. In each case the communication involves devices that are either embedded in, or brought into, the vehicle or infrastructure. The wireless communication uses Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC), a technology similar to WiFi, which supports applications designed to prevent crashes, increase mobility and improve the environment.\n\nThe Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) program is responsible for coordinating and developing PNT technology, PNT policy, and spectrum management. These responsibilities previously were performed by Office of the Secretary and were delegated to RITA by the Secretary of Transportation in August 2007. All modes of transportation rely on the Global Positioning System (GPS) and other PNT capabilities to provide safe and reliable operation of transportation systems. PNT is crucial for planning and tracking shipments, mapping routes, and other transportation functions, and is increasingly used for safety functions. The Office of Positioning, Navigation, and Timing represents all Federal civil departments and agencies in the development, acquisition, management, and operations of GPS, as well as providing civil PNT system analysis including requirements and architecture development and performance monitoring.\n\nRITA serves as the coordinator for the inland component of the Nationwide Differential GPS System (NDGPS), an augmentation to GPS which provides increased accuracy and integrity signals to surface transportation applications of GPS. The NDGPS signal is also used by many other civil economic sectors.\n\nThe John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts, partners with organizations across government and the private sector to research and develop solutions to emerging transportation issues. The Volpe Center is funded through a fee-for-service structure, which means all costs are covered by sponsored project work.\n\nThe Volpe Center was established in 1970 to provide analytical, scientific, and engineering support to the newly established U.S. Department of Transportation. From the beginning, the Center was envisioned as a place where a broad range of skills could be focused on major issues that cut across the traditional modal structure of the transportation enterprise.\n\nHoused on the campus of NASA's former Electronics Research Center, the Center opened as the Transportation Systems Center thanks to growing congressional awareness of the need to apply advanced technology to national transportation problems and the efforts of then-U.S. Secretary of Transportation John A. Volpe, as well as those of the Massachusetts congressional delegation. In 1990, the Center was renamed in John A. Volpe's honor.\n\nLocated in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, the Transportation Safety Institute (TSI) conducts worldwide safety, security, and environmental training for public and private sector transportation professionals. TSI offers more than 700 courses and seminars designed to prepare safety professionals to handle emergencies and other critical incidents through a hands-on, real-world training experience, such as using staged debris fields for aircraft crash investigation training. TSI funding comes through a fee-for-service structure, which means all costs are covered by sponsored project work.\n\nThe first Distracted Driving Summit was held in 2009 in Washington, D.C., with the second annual Summit held on September 21, 2010, in Washington. The Summit aims to raise awareness about the dangers of distracted driving and also to examine emerging technology, policy, and other innovations to curb distracted driving in the United States.\n\nIn October 2010, Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood convened the first meeting of the U.S. DOT Safety Council, formed to tackle critical transportation safety issues facing the Department's 10 operating administrations. Before taking office, LaHood noticed that the department's agencies were pursuing many important safety initiatives without a formal process for sharing data, best practices, and strategies. He established the Safety Council to serve a cross-modal safety leadership role, enabling an even stronger safety culture in the department, and designated RITA to coordinate council activities.\nThe goals of the Safety Council are to further enhance the safety focus throughout all of the department's agencies and to improve the impact of the department's safety programs. Transportation Deputy Secretary John Porcari chairs the Council, which comprises the heads of the Department's 10 agencies. The Council will be action-oriented and data-driven, emphasizing open dialogue about common issues and providing a forum for fresh ideas and different perspectives.\n\nRITA publishes several different annual statistical reports as well as weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual press releases and updates regarding transportation statistics which reflect what is going on in the world of transportation in addition to the larger U.S. economy. All of RITA's publications can be found on RITA's website.\nOne important RITA publication is the Transportation Statistics Annual Report (TSAR), which includes data on all modes of transportation. The most recent TSAR can be found on RITA's website.\n\nRITA is one of ten Operating Administrations within the U.S. Department of Transportation. The others are:\n\n\nRITA works with these different modal administrations to coordinate communication of research performed in the different modes, promoting synergy across the modes of transportation.\n\n"}

{"id": "1851934", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1851934", "title": "Philidor position", "text": "Philidor position\n\nThe Philidor position (or Philidor's position) usually refers to an important chess endgame which illustrates a drawing technique when the defender has a king and rook versus a king, rook, and a pawn. It is also known as the third rank defense, because of the importance of the rook on the third cutting off the opposing king. It was analyzed by François-André Danican Philidor in 1777. (Also see rook and pawn versus rook endgame.) Many rook and pawn versus rook endgames reach either the Philidor position or the Lucena position. If played accurately the defending side tries to reach the Philidor position; the other side tries to reach the winning Lucena position. Jesús de la Villa said \"[The Philidor position] is perhaps the most important position in endgame theory\" .\n\nPhilidor analyzed many positions, some of which have his name associated with them (see the subsequent sections).\n\nThe diagram shows an example of Philidor's position. The important characteristics of the position are (from the point of view of the defender):\n\nBlack would like to get his king to the e3-square and threaten checkmate to force the white king away from the queening square of the pawn, e1. The white rook on the third rank prevents that. If Black checks with the rook from the side, White simply keeps the king in front of the pawn by alternating between squares e1 and e2. If Black offers an exchange of rooks White should take it, since the resulting king and pawn endgame is drawn (see King and pawn versus king endgame).\n\nSo Black's only winning chance is to advance the pawn. The basic idea for the defender is to keep his rook on his third rank until the pawn advances to that rank, then check the opposing king from behind. Here is a possible continuation:\n\nIf 1...e3, advancing the pawn immediately, then 2.Ra8 draws since Black's king cannot escape checks without losing the e-pawn, when the resulting position with each side playing with a king and a rook, is a draw.\n\nThere is little else for Black to try. If Black retreats the rook, the white king can advance, drawing easily. If Black shuffles (...Rc2–Ra2–Rc2), White can do the same (Ra3–Rh3–Ra3). With 3...e3, Black threatens to advance with Kf3, and if he is unopposed, checkmate with the rook or advance the pawn. (A passive defense does not work.)\n\nSince now Black's king cannot move to e3, it is safe to move the rook away to the far end of the board (the defender's seventh or eighth rank). Note that 4.Rb4+ () loses immediately to 4...Kf3 when Black will checkmate or force the exchange of rooks followed by ...Kf2 and promotion of the pawn.\n\nThe black king cannot hide from the checks without giving up the pawn; nor can he approach the rook:\n\n7...Kg5 is also answered by 8.Re8.\nBlack is forced to play ...Kd4 or ...Kf4, making no progress. The defender's rook must be on his seventh or eighth rank to employ the Philidor defense. (Positions can be drawn with the rook in other positions, using different defenses.)\n\nTo sum up the defense: the defender should keep his king in front of the opposing pawn and keep his rook on the third rank until the pawn advances to that rank, then go to the far end of the board (the seventh or eighth rank) and check the king from behind. If the attacker tries to get his king to his sixth rank by moving his rook to that rank first to block the checks, the defender simply exchanges rooks and has a drawn king and pawn versus king endgame.\nPhilidor actually studied a position that leads to the type of position above. In the diagrammed position, if it is Black's turn to move, he moves\n\nand then his rook will reach his third rank, and the position is basically the same as the diagram above, with colors reversed, e.g. 2. Ke6 Rb6+ 3. Kf5 Rc6 establishes the standard defensive setup.\n\nIf White is to move, he wins with accurate play by\n\n2.Ra8# was threatened. Moving the king to the \"short side\" of the pawn is relatively better than to the other side.\n\netc., and wins . Note that Black reaches a draw after 1.Kd6 Re4!, for example 2.Ke6 Kf8 3.Ra8+ Kg7 4.Kd6 Kf7 and White cannot break through.\nPhilidor's defense can also be used if the pawn is less advanced. In that case, the defending rook can occupy its fourth rank instead of its third rank and the defending king should be on at least its second rank. When the pawn reaches the rank of the defending rook, the rook moves to its eighth rank to check the opposing king from behind (assuming that the opposing rook is not on that rank) , .\n\nPhilidor thought that the only way to draw was to keep the defending rook on its third rank until the pawn reached that rank and then attack from behind. In 1897 Max A.K.S. Karstedt (1868–1945) showed that this is not strictly true and Johann Berger (1845–1933) expanded on that. There are other ways to draw; however, the alternate defenses are more complicated .\n\nPhilidor studied many endgame positions. Another one that he studied in 1777 (and is also called \"Philidor's position\") involves a queen versus a rook (see the diagram).\n\nIf Black is to move in this position, he quickly loses his rook by a fork (or gets checkmated). For example,\n\nthus forking the rook on b1. \n\nIf, on the other hand, White is to move in this position, he would like to be in this position except with Black to move. This can be accomplished by triangulation:\n\nand now it is back to the same position but Black has to move (and is in zugzwang)\n, . Nunn describes that with the pieces in the center of the board the queen ought to force the rook towards the \"Philidor position\". Nunn describes the various retreat positions for the rook, the \"fourth, third, second\" rank defenses, then the \"Philidor position\". It is usually easy for White to force Black into the Philidor position . With Black to play in the Philidor position, the rook can be won in a few moves .\n\nAnother famous position studied by and named after Philidor is in the ending of a rook and bishop versus a rook (diagram). White wins because his king has reached the sixth rank and black's king is poorly placed (opposite the white king) . If this type of position arises, it is usually because of inferior defense. Nevertheless, it is tricky to win .\n\n\n\n"}

He first served in Russia, but spent most of his episcopate in Japan (1908 - 1945) in the Russian Orthodox Christian mission and in the Japanese Orthodox Church.\n\nHe was born on June 16, 1871 as Alexiy in a village of Guzi near Novgorod, Russia, in the family of a rural priest Tikhomirov. He studied well, entered in the St. Petersburg Theological Academy and graduated in 1896. In 1895 Alexiy took the monastic vows with the name Sergius.\n\nLater he taught theology at the St. Petersburg Theological Seminary, and in 1899 became the prefect of the St. Petersburg Theological Academy, in the rank of archimandrite.\n\nIn 1905 he was raised to episcopacy and was consecrated Bishop of Jamburg, vicar to the Archbishop of St. Petersburg, at the age of 35 years. Throughout his tenure at the Academy he was a prolific preacher as well as an author of a number of works on the Church history of his native Novgorod region.\n\nIn 1908 bishop Sergius was sent to Japan, to become a successor to archbishop Nicholas (Kasatkin). Having acquainted himself with Japan and quickly mastered the language, Sergius showed himself a committed spokesmen for the Orthodox Christian faithful of Japan's recent acquisitions in Southern Sakhalin (Japan had acquired Southern Sakhalin, or \"Karafuto\" in Japanese, as a result of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905); and he secured the return of confiscated Church property to the faithful. In 1912 archbishop Nicolas reposed, and Sergius took over as ruling bishop of the Japanese Orthodox mission. Some five years later he had to face the difficulties caused to the mission by the Russian Revolution of 1917: having no aid from an established church in Russia meant the loss of almost the entire budget of the mission, which had to cut back its activities but survived. \n\nIn 1923 the Great Kantō earthquake destroyed the headquarters of the Japanese Orthodox Church, severely damaging the Tokyo Resurrection Cathedral. Raising funds for its restoration became a central activity of bishop Sergius and the Japanese faithful for the next years, and they succeeded in independently raising a vast sum and restoring the cathedral by 1929.\n\nIn 1931 the then archbishop Sergius was elevated to the rank of Metropolitan bishop by the Moscow Patriarchate. However, the 1930s saw the rise of militarism and nationalism amongst the Japanese, many of whom became prejudiced against Christianity and all things foreign. In 1940 Sergius was ousted from his position at the head of the Japanese Orthodox Church, so that the Church might comply with the Japanese government's demand for all ruling clergy in Japanese religious organizations to be native. Sergius spent the wartime years in obscurity, and in 1945 he was arrested by the Japanese special police on suspicion of being a Soviet Russian spy. \n\nBy the time of his release his health was terminally undercut, and he died on August 10, 1945, five days before the end of World War II. His remains rest beside those of St. Nicolas of Japan, in the Yanaka Cemetery in Tokyo.\n\n"}

{"id": "1851972", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1851972", "title": "DeFunis v. Odegaard", "text": "DeFunis v. Odegaard\n\nDeFunis v. Odegaard, 416 U.S. 312 (1974), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that the case had become moot and so declined to render a decision on the merits. American student Marco DeFunis, who had been denied admission to the University of Washington School of Law in the state of Washington before he was provisionally admitted during the pendency of the case, was slated to graduate within a few months of the decision being rendered.\n\nThe Court rejected the assertion that the case was in one of two exceptions to the mootness doctrine that were raised by the plaintiff. The case did not constitute \"voluntary cessation\" on the part of the defendant law school, as the plaintiff was now in his final quarter, and the law school could take no action to deny him the ability to graduate. Also, it was not a question that was \"capable of repetition, yet evading review\" because the plaintiff would never again face the situation, and others who might raise the same complaint in the future might be able to receive the courts' full review.\n\nDeFunis argued that materials brought to light during discovery and entered into evidence in the trial court showed that his initial denial of admission to the law school was the result of the operation of the law school's affirmative action policy, favoring the admission of minority applicants over better-qualified white candidates. Although the Court refused to consider the case on the merits in \"DeFunis\", the issue of affirmative action returned to the Court without any problem of mootness, with an opinion on the merits achieved in \"Regents of the University of California v. Bakke\".\n\nIn 1970, Marco DeFunis, a white man, applied for entry to the law program at the University of Washington. He was denied even though the year in question would be his final year. DeFunis, believing he had been rejected because of affirmative action, thought the school had taken applicants who were approved because of not their accomplishments but their race.\n\nHe took his case to court and stated that of affirmative action violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n\nThe case was first heard in the Superior Court of Washington, in which the University of Washington moved to have the case dismissed on the grounds that relief could not be granted. The court rejected the proposed dismissal and filed an injunction that forced the school to admit DeFunis. The university argued that it used a complex formula to predict applicants' success, the Predicted First-Year Average (PFYA), but it was not the only thing taken into account during the application process.\n\nApplicants with higher PFYA scores were reviewed and were presented by a committee member before the whole committee. The committee member who represented a student was usually up to chance but not in the case of African American and other minority students. Their files were reviewed by three specific board members: Professor Geoffrey Crooks (director of the school's Council on Legal Education Opportunities program), Vincent Hayes (a second-year black law student), and Associate Dean Robert S. Hunt (the sole evaluator of the files of minorities other than African Americans). The court found that in reviewing the files of minority applicants, the committee attached less weight to the PFYA in making a total judgmental evaluation as to the relative ability of the particular applicant to succeed in law school. Also, the chairman testified that although the same standard was applied to all applicants (the relative probability of the individual succeeding in law school), minority applicants were directly compared to one another, but they were not compared to applicants outside of the minority group. As a result, the committee admitted a group of minority applicants, placed a group of such applicants on a waiting list, and rejected other minority applications. The dean of the law school testified that the law school has no fixed admissions quota for minority students but that the committee sought a reasonable representation of such groups in the law school. He added that the it has accepted no unqualified minority applicants but only those whose records indicated that they were capable of successfully completing the law school program. Because of the judgmental factors in the admissions process, as outlined, the ultimate determination of applicants to whom admission was offered did not follow exactly the relative ranking of PFYAs. Of those invited, 74 had lower PFYAs than plaintiff; 36 of them were minority applicants, 22 were returning from military service, and 16 were applicants judged by the committee as deserving invitations on the basis of other information contained in their files. There were 29 applicants with higher PFYAs than plaintiff's were denied admission. Of the 36 minority group students invited 18 actually enrolled in the first-year class. The law faculty was, as the court observes, motivated by a laudable purpose: to increase the number of minority students studying law and with the avowed purpose of equalizing opportunities among applicants who come from the lower income and economic groups with those who come from the higher. That policy of ethnic minority selection apparently was not to apply to faculty positions, as the record does not show that any qualified white applicant for the teaching staff was refused or that any faculty member ousted to make room for law teachers with questionable credentials from a minority ethnic group.\n\nThe court's reflected heavily on the Supreme Court's ruling on \"Brown v. Board of Education\" when it began ruling and so the injunction was filed. The Supreme Court of Washington had strong opinions on the case, with Justice Hale going as far to say, \"Preferential treatment under the guise of 'affirmative action' is the imposition of one form of racial discrimination in place of another. The questions that must be asked in this regard are: must an individual sacrifice his right to be judged on his own merit by accepting discrimination based solely on the color of his skin? How can we achieve the goal of equal opportunity for all if, in the process, we deny equal opportunity to some?\" Justice Hunter concurred \"The majority supports a laudable purpose — to enable students of certain minority races to enter the University of Washington School of Law in order that ultimately there will be a greater representation of practicing lawyers of those races in the legal profession — with which purpose I do not disagree. This must not be accomplished, however, by clear and willful discrimination against students of other races as the Admissions Committee of the University of Washington School of Law has done in this case by denying admission to the respondent, Marco DeFunis, Jr, to this school, as found by the trial court and amply supported by the record.\"\n\nWhen the case reached the Supreme Court, DeFunis was already in his final year of law school.

{"id": "1851980", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1851980", "title": "South Island Main Trunk Railway", "text": "South Island Main Trunk Railway\n\nThe Main North Line between Picton and Christchurch and the Main South Line between Lyttelton and Invercargill, running down the east coast of the South Island of New Zealand, are sometimes together referred-to collectively as the South Island Main Trunk Railway (SIMT). Construction of a line running the length of the east coast began in the 1860s and was completed all the way from Picton to Invercargill in 1945; the last sections being on the Main North Line south of Picton. But the designation \"South Island Main Trunk\" originally referred to only that line between Christchurch and Invercargill.\n\nConstruction of the Main South Line began in 1865 when the Canterbury Provincial Railways began work on a broad gauge line south from Christchurch. It reached Rolleston on 13 October 1866 and Selwyn a year later. A number of routes south were considered, and the one chosen was a compromise between a proposal to build a coastal line through fertile territory and a proposal to build an inland line to achieve easier crossings of rivers such as the Rakaia. However, construction had to be postponed as the Canterbury Province government was low on funds, and it did not restart until Julius Vogel announced the central government's \"Great Public Works Policy\".\n\nThe \"Great Public Works Policy\" placed a high priority on the completion of the Main South Line. At this time, New Zealand accepted narrow gauge as its national rail gauge, but Canterbury was permitted to extent its broad gauge as far as Rakaia - although it did so on 2 June 1873, it converted its entire network to narrow gauge by 6 March 1876. Further south, the Dunedin and Port Chalmers Railway was opened on 1 January 1873 as the first railway in the country to adhere to the new national gauge. Although the final portion of this line became the Port Chalmers Branch, most of it was incorporated into the main line northwards and construction progressed through difficult terrain towards Oamaru. South of Dunedin, work was progressing on a link with Invercargill; a line between Invercargill and Gore was opened on 30 August 1875 and a line between Dunedin and Balclutha was opened two days later. Construction to link these sections faced more construction challenges than the earlier work had, and accordingly, the rate of progress slowed.\n\nOver the next three years, the line between Dunedin and Christchurch was completed; Christchurch and Timaru were linked on 4 February 1876, followed by Oamaru on a year later, and the difficult section between Oamaru and Dunedin was finally completed on 7 September 1878. All that remained was the Balclutha-Gore link, which was opened on 22 January 1879, completing the Main South Line.\n\nConstruction of the Main North Line was one of the longest construction projects in New Zealand's history. Through the 1870s, work on a line from Christchurch to northern centres in Canterbury was undertaken, with a line through Kaiapoi, Rangiora, and Amberley reaching Waipara in 1880, and at the other end, a line linking Blenheim and Picton opened in 1875. Further construction was delayed by disputes over proposed routes. Different regions sought to protect their interests by having the line constructed through their area. Some preferred the coastal route via Parnassus and Kaikoura, while others favoured an inland route to Blenheim with a branch from Tophouse to Nelson. There was also a proposal to use the latter route as the trans-Alpine line (as the Midland Line's route was yet to be chosen), linking Waipara with Reefton and then connecting to Nelson and possibly Blenheim via a line up the Buller Gorge.\n\nThe people of Marlborough favoured a coastal route and began work south, while in Canterbury, work initially began on an inland route, with Waipara linked to Culverden in 1886. Although the line to Culverden was treated as the main line for decades, it eventually became part of the Waiau Branch. At the start of the 20th century, work began on a coastal route northwards from Waipara, with the line opened to Parnassus in 1912. Construction then proceeded up the Leader River valley as part of a somewhat inland route to Kaikoura via river valleys, but the start of World War I brought a halt to construction and the 3 km of track laid beyond Parnassus was removed. The war also brought a halt to work at the northern end, with the coastal village of Wharanui established as the terminus of the line south from Blenheim.\n\nThe 1920s saw much indecisiveness and disputes over what route to take between Waipara and Wharanui. The Culverden line now ran all the way as Waiau and some work took place on a line to link Waiau with Kaikoura, but after a few kilometres of formation was made, work came to a halt. The coastal route was then chosen and work had only just restarted when the Great Depression began and brought about more severe delays. Fortunes improved in 1936 sufficiently to allow a resumption of progress, and a more coastal route out of Parnassus than the Leader Valley route was chosen. World War II brought even more delays, but this time, construction progressed through wartime and the Main North Line was finally completed when the northern and southern ends met at Kaikoura on 15 December 1945.\n\nThe South Island Main Trunk has been famous for its passenger services. In the days of steam locomotives, the South Island Limited expresses were particularly famous; drivers of J and J class locomotives claimed to have broken the official New Zealand railway speed record on a section of track near Rakaia called the \"racetrack\". The Main South Line saw the last regularly steam-hauled expresses in New Zealand, with J locomotives hauling the Friday and Sunday night expresses until 26 October 1971. All other steam-hauled expresses were replaced on 1 December 1970 by the Southerner, which was hauled by DJ class diesel-electric locomotives. This service was one of the most famous in New Zealand, but it ceased on 10 February 2002.\n\nFor many years, RM (Fiat) railcars ran services on the Main North Line, but they were withdrawn during the 1970s. On 25 September 1988 the tourist-focused Coastal Pacific express began operating along the scenic route between Christchurch and Picton; it continues to operate as the TranzCoastal. In the summer of 1994-95, this service was augmented by the Lynx Express, which was unsuccessful and not repeated in later years. Commuter services used to operate around major centres along the South Island Main Trunk, and many rural services also operated when country branch lines were operational, but the branch lines progressively closed during the 20th century and commuter services in the South Island ceased in the 1980s. Nowadays, the only Tranz Scenic passenger services on the South Island Main Trunk are the TranzCoastal and the TranzAlpine, which uses the short portion of the Main South Line between Christchurch and Rolleston before running along the Midland Line to Greymouth.\n\nFreight services on both lines operated for many years as feeder services from rural districts to nearby major centres and harbours, rather than utilising long-distance services between the important cities. The first through freight from Christchurch to Invercargill did not operate until December 1970. During the 1970s and 1980s, patterns of freight haulage changed dramatically, with the last of the branch lines closing and an emphasis placed upon long-distance haulage. The South Island Main Trunk is now used to carry significant quantities of long-distance freight, and it connects with the North Island via roll-on roll-off ferries between Picton and Wellington. These ferries have allowed freight trains to be operated from Auckland to Christchurch on a 30-hour schedule.\n\n"}
{"id": "1851992", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1851992", "title": "Quebec Autoroute 10", "text": "Quebec Autoroute 10\n\nAutoroute 10 (A-10) is an Autoroute of Quebec in Canada that links greater Montreal to key population centres in Montérégie and Estrie, including Brossard, Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Granby, and Sherbrooke.\n\nThe A-10 also provides access to popular winter resorts at Bromont, Owl's Head, Mont Sutton and Mont Orford. Motorists travelling on the A-10 can see eight of nine Monteregian Hills: Mount Royal, Mont Saint-Bruno, Mont Saint-Hilaire, Mont Saint-Grégoire, Mont Rougemont, Mont Yamaska, Mont Shefford and Mont Brome. (The ninth, Mont Mégantic is located beyond the eastern terminus of the autoroute.\n\nThe A-10 carries the name Autoroute Bonaventure (\"Bonaventure Expressway\") from its start in Montreal's city centre to the Champlain Bridge. From there until its terminus in Sherbrooke, the A-10 is called the Autoroute des Cantons-de-l'Est (Eastern Townships Expressway), a reference to the historic name given to the region east of Montreal and north of the U.S. border.\n\nThe road's main material is asphalt concrete, many parts of the highway are bordered with gravel.\n\nThe A-10 begins in Downtown Montreal as an extension of University Street near Place Bonaventure. Two underground ramps provide an interchange with the A-720. At km 1, the A-10 crosses the Lachine Canal, then travels along the St. Lawrence River to an interchange with the A-15 and A-20. This interchange is partially on the Island of Montreal and partially on Nuns' Island. At km 2, it crosses (but does not provide access to) Route 112 at the north end of Victoria Bridge. The A-10 has three lanes in each direction on the majority of its length and the speed limit is 70 km/h. The A-10 is multiplexed with the A-15 and A-20 across the Champlain Bridge. All three autoroutes diverge soon after reaching the southern edge of the bridge.\n\nThe A-10 serves as an important link for commuters travelling to downtown Montreal from suburban South Shore communities via the Champlain Bridge. It also provides access to the Montreal Technoparc and the Concordia Bridge. The A-10 in Montreal is jointly owned by the city of Montreal, the Société Les Ponts Jacques Cartier, and Federal Bridge Corporation (an agency of the Government of Canada).\n\nAt km 8, the A-10 crosses Taschereau Boulevard. Bus lanes run in both directions along the median for four kilometers between the southern end of the Champlain Bridge and Milan Boulevard. Crossing Brossard, the A-10 runs along the northern edge of the Quartier DIX30 shopping complex before reaching interchanges with the A-30 at km 11 and the A-35 at km 22. The A-10 crosses the Richelieu River at km 28 and enters a rich agricultural region.\n\nBetween Bromont (km 74) and Magog (km 121) the A-10 passes through a mountainous region, close to two of Quebec's major ski centres (Mont Orford and Mont Brome). Near the northern end of Lake Memphremagog, the A-10 reaches an interchange with the A-55 at km 121. The A-10 continues east as a concurrency with A-55. Between km 123 and 128, Route 112 functions as a frontage road.\n\nA-10 and A-55 bypass the city of Sherbrooke to the east and north, reaching interchanges with spur routes A-410 at km 140 and A-610 at km 143. The A-10 reaches its terminus at the junction with A-610, while A-55 continues north to Drummondville.\n\nThe portion east of Autoroute 55 (linking that autoroute with Route 112) was renumbered as Autoroute 610 on September 29, 2006. \n\nThe long Autoroute de l'Est (\"Eastern Expressway\") was opened to traffic in December 1964. Extending from the southern end of the Champlain Bridge to Magog, the highway replaced the old Quebec Route 1 (now Route 112) as the main road link between these two points. An official opening for the highway came one year later, in 1965. The A-10 was the second autoroute, after the Laurentian Autoroute outside Montreal, to be commissioned. Both were opened as toll highways by a Quebec government agency. The A-10 featured five toll stations (at current km 22, km 37, km 68, km 90, and km 115). Motorists were charged $1.50 to make the entire trip.\n\nThe Autoroute Bonaventure through Montreal opened in 1967 to link approach roads to Expo 67 with the Champlain Bridge.\n\nThe Autoroute des Cantons de l'Est was the first autoroute in Quebec to use exit numbers based on distance instead of in sequential order, as had previously been the case. As Canada had not yet adopted the Metric system, exit numbers referenced the distance in miles from the southern end of the Champlain Bridge.\n\nThe A-10 did not originally have a route number. Instead, route marker signs featured a red triangular shield featuring the name of the route. Unusually, the directional signs were also originally red. Later, blue shields and signs replaced the red versions.\n\nIn 1985, the toll system was abolished, and the use of the triangular shields was discontinued. Blue directional signs have gradually been converted to standard green signs used elsewhere in North America. In 2013, motorists could still see blue signs at entrances to and exits of the autoroute.\n\nBetween 1988 and 2006, A-10 departed its multiplex with A-55 at km 143 and continued eastward for 11 km to a final terminus with Route 112. In October 2006, that section of A-10 was renumbered as A-610.\n\nUnder a project started in 2016, the Autoroute Bonaventure will be completely reconfigured by 2018. The Société du Havre de Montréal (SHM) is transforming the autoroute into an urban thoroughfare as part of a broader project to redevelop Montreal's harbourfront. The city of Montreal announced in January 2013 that it would take over the SHM's responsibilities, citing concerns over transparency.\n\nA current proposal to build the East-West Highway across central and northern Maine calls for the A-10 to be extended to the U.S. border at Coburn Gore where it would meet the new highway. Doing so would create a new and more direct limited-access highway link between Maine, the Maritime Provinces through New Brunswick Route 1, and Quebec.\n\n"}
{"id": "1851993", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1851993", "title": "History of Sheffield", "text": "History of Sheffield\n\nThe area known as Sheffield was probably founded in the second half of 1AD in a clearing by the River Sheaf although humans may have lived in the area for at least 10,000 years.\n\nSheffield was a centre of blade production since the 14th century. By 1600, Sheffield became the biggest producer of cutlery outside of London. Technological improvements, such as the crucible steel process after 1740, led to rapid industrial growth with significant urban growth occurring during the Industrial Revolution. Sheffield was incorporated as a borough in 1843 and granted a city charter in 1893. Sheffield remained a major industrial city until the early 1970s. The economic downturn following the 1973 oil crisis, technological improvements and economies of scale, and a wide-reaching restructuring of steel production throughout the European Economic Community led to the closure of many of the steelworks.\n\nUrban and economic regeneration schemes began in the late 1980s to diversify the city's economy. Sheffield is now a centre for banking and insurance functions with HSBC, Santander and Aviva having regional offices in the city. The city has also attracted digital start-ups, with 25,000 now employed in the digital sector.\n\nThe earliest known evidence of human occupation in the Sheffield area was found at Creswell Crags to the east of the city. Artefacts and rock art found in caves at this site have been dated by archaeologists to the late Upper Palaeolithic period, at least 12,800 years ago. Other prehistoric remains found in Sheffield include a Mesolithic \"house\"—a circle of stones in the shape of a hut-base dating to around 8000 BC, found at Deepcar, in the northern part of the city. This has been ascribed to the Maglemosian culture.(). The site's culture has similarities to Star Carr in North Yorkshire, but gives its name to unique \"Deepcar type assemblages\" of microliths in the archaeology literature. A cup and ring-marked stone was discovered in Ecclesall Woods in 1981, and has been dated to the late Neolithic or Bronze Age periods. It, and an area around it of 2 m diameter, is a scheduled ancient monument.\n\nDuring the Bronze Age (about 1500 BC) tribes sometimes called the Urn people started to settle in the area. They built numerous stone circles, examples of which can be found on Ash Cabin Flat, Froggatt Edge and Hordron Edge (\"Hordron Edge stone circle\"). Two Early Bronze Age urns were found at Crookes in 1887, and three Middle Bronze Age barrows found at Lodge Moor (both suburbs of the modern city). \nDuring the British Iron Age the area became the southernmost territory of the Pennine tribe called the Brigantes. It is this tribe who in around 500 BC are thought to have constructed the hill fort that stands on the summit of a steep hill above the River Don at Wincobank, in what is now northeastern Sheffield. Other Iron Age hill forts in the area are Carl Wark on Hathersage Moor to the southwest of Sheffield, and one at Scholes Wood, near Rotherham. The rivers Sheaf and Don may have formed the boundary between the territory of the Brigantes and that of a rival tribe called the Corieltauvi who inhabited a large area of the northeastern Midlands.\n\nThe Roman invasion of Britain began in AD 43. By 51 the Brigantes had submitted to the clientship of Rome, eventually being placed under direct rule in the early 70s. Few Roman remains have been found in the Sheffield area. A minor Roman road linking the Roman forts at Templeborough and Brough-on-Noe possibly ran through the centre of the area covered by the modern city, and Icknield Street is thought to have skirted its boundaries. The routes of these roads within this area are mostly unknown, although sections of the former were thought, by Hunter and Leader, be visible between Redmires and Stanage on an ancient road known as the Long Causeway. In recent years some scholars have cast doubt on this, with an initial survey of Barber Fields, Ringinglow, suggesting the Roman Road took a route over Burbage Edge. The remains of a Roman road, possibly linked to the latter, were discovered in Brinsworth in 1949.\n\nIn April 1761, tablets or diplomas dating from the Roman period were found in the Rivelin Valley south of Stannington, close to the likely course of the Templeborough to Brough-on-Noe road. These tablets included a grant of citizenship and land or money to a retiring Roman auxiliary of the Sunuci tribe of Belgium.\n\n\"To . . . . . . . . the son of Albanus, of the tribe of the Sunuci, late a foot soldier in the first cohort of the Sunuci commanded by M. Junius Claudianus.\"\n\nIn addition there have been finds dating from the Roman period on Walkley Bank Road, which leads onto the valley bottom.\n\nThere have been small finds of Roman coins throughout the Sheffield area, for example 30 to 40 Roman coins were found near the Old Great Dam at Crookesmoor, 19 coins were found near Meadowhall in 1891, 13 in Pitsmoor in 1906, and ten coins were found at a site alongside Eckington cemetery in December 2008. Roman burial urns were also found at Bank Street near Sheffield Cathedral, which, along with the name of the old lane behind the church (Campo Lane), has led to speculation that there may have been a Roman camp at this site. It is unlikely that the settlement that grew into Sheffield existed at this time. In 2011 excavations revealed remains of a substantial 1st or 2nd century AD Roman rural estate centre, or 'villa' on what is believed to be a pre-existing Brigantian farmstead site at Whirlow Hall Farm in South-west Sheffield.\n\nFollowing the departure of the Romans, the Sheffield area may have been the southern part of the Celtic kingdom of Elmet, with the rivers Sheaf and Don forming part of the boundary between this kingdom and the kingdom of Mercia. Gradually, Anglian settlers pushed west from the kingdom of Deira. The Britons of Elmet delayed this English expansion into the early part of the 7th century. An enduring Celtic presence within this area is evidenced by the settlements called Wales and Waleswood close to Sheffield—the word \"Wales\" derives from the Germanic word \"Walha\", and was originally used by the Anglo-Saxons to refer to the native Britons.\n\nThe name \"Sheffield\" is Old English in origin. It derives from the River Sheaf, whose name is a corruption of \"shed\" or \"sheth\", meaning to divide or separate. \"Field\" is a generic suffix deriving from the Old English \"feld\", meaning a forest clearing. It is likely then that the origin of the present-day city of Sheffield is an Anglo-Saxon settlement in a clearing beside the confluence of the rivers Sheaf and Don founded between the arrival of the Anglo-Saxons in this region (roughly the 6th century) and the early 9th century.\n\nThe names of many of the other areas of Sheffield likely to have been established as settlements during this period end in \"ley\", which signifies a clearing in the forest, or \"ton\", which means an enclosed farmstead. These settlements include Heeley, Longley, Norton, Owlerton, Southey, Tinsley, Totley, Wadsley, and Walkley.\nThe earliest evidence of this settlement is thought to be the shaft of a stone cross dating from the early 9th century that was found in Sheffield in the early 19th century. This shaft may be part of a cross removed from the church yard of the Sheffield parish church (now Sheffield Cathedral) in 1570. It is now kept in the British Museum.\n\nA document from around the same time, an entry for the year 829 in the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\", refers to the submission of King Eanred of Northumbria to King Egbert of Wessex at the hamlet of Dore (now a suburb of Sheffield): \"Egbert led an army against the Northumbrians as far as Dore, where they met him, and offered terms of obedience and subjection, on the acceptance of which they returned home\". This event made Egbert the first Saxon to claim to be king of all of England.\n\nThe latter part of the 9th century saw a wave of Norse (Viking) settlers and the subsequent establishment of the Danelaw. The names of hamlets established by these settlers often end in \"thorpe\", which means a farmstead. Examples of such settlements in the Sheffield area are Grimesthorpe, Hackenthorpe, Jordanthorpe, Netherthorpe, Upperthorpe, Waterthorpe, and Woodthorpe. By 918 the Danes south of the Humber had submitted to Edward the Elder, and by 926 Northumbria was under the control of King Æthelstan.\n\nIn 937 the combined armies of Olaf Guthfrithson, Viking king of Dublin, Constantine, king of Scotland and Owain ap Dyfnwal, king of the Cumbrians, invaded England. The invading force was met and defeated by an army from Wessex and Mercia led by King Æthelstan at the Battle of Brunanburh. The location of \"Brunanburh\" is unknown, but some historians have suggested a location between Tinsley in Sheffield and Brinsworth in Rotherham, on the slopes of White Hill. After the death of King Athelstan in 939 Olaf Guthfrithson invaded again and took control of Northumbria and part of Mercia. Subsequently, the Anglo-Saxons, under Edmund, re-conquered the Midlands, as far as Dore, in 942, and captured Northumbria in 944.\n\nThe Domesday Book of 1086, which was compiled following the Norman Conquest of 1066, contains the earliest known reference to the districts around Sheffield as the manor of \"Hallun\" (or Hallam). This manor retained its Saxon lord, Waltheof, for some years after the conquest. The Domesday Book was ordered written by William the Conqueror so that the value of the townships and manors of England could be assessed. The entries in the Domesday Book are written in a Latin shorthand; the extract for this area begins:\n\nTranslated it reads:\n\nThe reference is to Roger de Busli, tenant-in-chief in Domesday and one of the greatest of the new wave of Norman magnates. Waltheof, Earl of Northumbria had been executed in 1076 for his part in an uprising against William I. He was the last of the Anglo-Saxon earls still remaining in England a full decade after the Norman conquest. His lands had passed to his wife, Judith of Normandy, niece to William the Conqueror. The lands were held on her behalf by Roger de Busli.\n\nThe Domesday Book refers to Sheffield twice, first as \"Escafeld\", then later as \"Scafeld\". Sheffield historian S. O. Addy suggests that the second form, pronounced \"Shaffeld\", is the truer form, as the spelling \"Sefeld\" is found in a deed issued less than one hundred years after the completion of the survey. Addy comments that the \"E\" in the first form may have been mistakenly added by the Norman scribe.\n\nRoger de Busli died around the end of the 11th century, and was succeeded by a son, who died without an heir. The manor of Hallamshire passed to William de Lovetot, the grandson of a Norman baron who had come over to England with the Conqueror. William de Lovetot founded the parish churches of St Mary at Handsworth, St Nicholas at High Bradfield and St. Mary's at Ecclesfield at the start of the 12th century in addition to Sheffield's own parish church. He also built the original wooden Sheffield Castle, which stimulated the growth of the town.\n\nAlso dating from this time is Beauchief Abbey, which was founded by Robert FitzRanulf de Alfreton. The abbey was dedicated to Saint Mary and Saint Thomas Becket, who had been canonised in 1172. Thomas Tanner, writing in 1695, stated that it was founded in 1183. Samuel Pegge in his \"History of Beauchief Abbey\" notes that Albinas, the abbot of Derby, who was one of the witnesses to the charter of foundation, died in 1176, placing foundation before that date.\n\nFollowing the death of William de Lovetot, the manor of Hallamshire passed to his son Richard de Lovetot and then his son William de Lovetot before being passed by marriage to Gerard de Furnival in about 1204. The de Furnivals held the manor for the next 180 years. The fourth Furnival lord, Thomas de Furnival, supported Simon de Montfort in the Second Barons' War. As a result of this, in 1266 a party of barons, led by John de Eyvill, marching from north Lincolnshire to Derbyshire passed through Sheffield and destroyed the town, burning the church and castle.\n\nA new stone castle was constructed over the next four years and a new church was consecrated by William de Wickwane the Archbishop of York around 1280. In 1295 Thomas de Furnival's son (also Thomas) was the first lord of Hallamshire to be called to Parliament, thus taking the title Lord Furnivall. On 12 November 1296 Edward I granted a charter for a market to be held in Sheffield on Tuesday each week. This was followed on 10 August 1297 by a charter from Lord Furnival establishing Sheffield as a free borough.\n\nThe Sheffield Town Trust was established in the Charter to the Town of Sheffield, granted in 1297. De Furnival, granted land to the freeholders of Sheffield in return for an annual payment, and a Common Burgery administrated them. The Burgery originally consisted of public meetings of all the freeholders, who elected a Town Collector. Two more generations of Furnivals held Sheffield before it passed by marriage to Sir Thomas Nevil and then, in 1406, to John Talbot, the first Earl of Shrewsbury.\nIn 1430 the 1280 Sheffield parish church building was pulled down and replaced. Parts of this new church still stand today and it is now Sheffield city centre's oldest surviving building, forming the core of Sheffield Cathedral. Other notable surviving buildings from this period include the Old Queen's Head pub in Pond Hill, which dates from around 1480, with its timber frame still intact, and Bishops' House and Broom Hall, both built around 1500.\n\nThe fourth Earl of Shrewsbury, George Talbot took up residence in Sheffield, building the Manor Lodge outside the town in about 1510 and adding a chapel to the Parish Church c1520 to hold the family vault. Memorials to the fourth and sixth Earls of Shrewsbury can still be seen in the church. In 1569 George Talbot, the sixth Earl of Shrewsbury, was given charge of Mary, Queen of Scots. Mary was regarded as a threat by Elizabeth I, and had been held captive since her arrival in England in 1568.\n\nTalbot brought Mary to Sheffield in 1570, and she spent most of the next 14 years imprisoned in Sheffield Castle and its dependent buildings. The castle park extended beyond the present Manor Lane, where the remains of Manor Lodge are to be found. Beside them is the Turret House, an Elizabethan building, which may have been built to accommodate the captive queen. A room, believed to have been the queen's, has an elaborate plaster ceiling and overmantel, with heraldic decorations. During the English Civil War, Sheffield changed hands several times, finally falling to the Parliamentarians, who demolished the Castle in 1648.\n\nThe Industrial Revolution brought large-scale steel making to Sheffield in the 18th century. Much of the medieval town was gradually replaced by a mix of Georgian and Victorian buildings. Large areas of Sheffield's city centre have been rebuilt in recent years, but among the modern buildings, some old buildings have been retained.\n\nSheffield's developed after the industrial revolution because of its geography.\n\nFast-flowing rivers, such as the Sheaf, the Don and the Loxley, made it an ideal location for water-powered industries to develop. Raw materials, like coal, iron ore, ganister and millstone grit for grindstones, found in the nearby hills, were used in cutlery and blade production.\n\nAs early as the 14th century, Sheffield was noted for the production of knives:\n\nBy 1600 Sheffield was the main centre of cutlery production in England outside London, and in 1624 The Company of Cutlers in Hallamshire was formed to oversee the trade. Examples of water-powered blade and cutlery workshops from around this time can be seen at the Abbeydale Industrial Hamlet and Shepherd Wheel museums in Sheffield.\n\nAround a century later, Daniel Defoe in his book \"A tour thro' the whole island of Great Britain\", wrote:\n\nIn the 1740s Benjamin Huntsman, a clock maker in Handsworth, invented a form of the crucible steel process for making a better quality of steel than had previously been available. At around the same time Thomas Boulsover invented a technique for fusing a thin sheet of silver onto a copper ingot producing a form of silver plating that became known as Sheffield plate. Originally hand-rolled Old Sheffield Plate was used for making silver buttons. Then in 1751 Joseph Hancock, previously apprenticed to Boulsover's friend Thomas Mitchell, first used it to make kitchen and tableware. This prospered and in 1762–65 Hancock built the water-powered Old Park Silver Mills at the confluence of the Loxley and the Don, one of the earliest factories solely producing an industrial semi-manufacture. Eventually Old Sheffield Plate was supplanted by cheaper electroplate in the 1840s. In 1773 Sheffield was given a silver assay office. In the late 18th century, Britannia metal, a pewter-based alloy similar in appearance to silver, was invented in the town.\nHuntsman's process was only made obsolete in 1856 by Henry Bessemer's invention of the Bessemer converter, but production of crucible steel continued until well into the 20th century for special uses, as Bessemer's steel was not of the same quality, in the main replacing wrought iron for such applications as rails. Bessemer had tried to induce steelmakers to take up his improved system, but met with general rebuffs, and finally was driven to undertake the exploitation of the process himself. To this end he erected steelworks in Sheffield. Gradually the scale of production was enlarged until the competition became effective, and steel traders generally became aware that the firm of Henry Bessemer & Co. was underselling them to the extent of £20 a ton. One of Bessemer's converters can still be seen at Sheffield's Kelham Island Museum.\n\nStainless steel was discovered by Harry Brearley in 1912, at the Brown Firth Laboratories in Sheffield. His successor as manager at Brown Firth, Dr William Hatfield, continued Brealey's work. In 1924 he patented '18-8 stainless steel', which to this day is probably the most common alloy of this type.\nThese innovations helped Sheffield to gain a worldwide recognition for the production of cutlery; utensils such as the bowie knife were mass-produced and shipped to the United States. The population of the town increased rapidly. In 1736 Sheffield and its surrounding hamlets held about 7000 people, in 1801 there were 60,000, and by 1901, the population had grown to 451,195.\n\nThis growth spurred the reorganisation of the governance of the town. Prior to 1818, the town was run by a mixture of bodies. The Sheffield Town Trust and the Church Burgesses, for example, divided responsibility for the improvement of streets and bridges. By the 19th century both organisations lacked funds and struggled even to maintain existing infrastructure. The Church Burgesses organised a public meeting on 27 May 1805 and proposed to apply to Parliament for an act to pave, light and clean the city's streets. The proposal was defeated.\n\nThe idea of a Commission was revived in 1810, and later in the decade Sheffield finally followed the model adopted by several other towns in petitioning for an Act to establish an Improvement Commission. This eventually led to the Sheffield Improvement Act 1818, which established the Commission and included several other provisions. In 1832 the town gained political representation with the formation of a Parliamentary borough. A municipal borough was formed by an Act of Incorporation in 1843, and this borough was granted the style and title of \"City\" by Royal Charter in 1893.\nFrom the mid-18th century, a succession of public buildings were erected in the town. St Paul's Church, now demolished, was among the first, while the old Town Hall and the present Cutlers' Hall were among the major works of the 19th century. The town's water supply was improved by the Sheffield Waterworks Company, who built reservoirs around the town. Parts of Sheffield were devastated when, following a five-year construction project, the Dale Dyke dam collapsed on Friday 11 March 1864, resulting in the Great Sheffield Flood.\n\nSheffield's transport infrastructure was also improved. In the 18th century turnpike roads were built connecting Sheffield with Barnsley, Buxton, Chesterfield, Glossop, Intake, Penistone, Tickhill, and Worksop. In 1774 a wooden tramway was laid at the Duke of Norfolk's Nunnery Colliery. The tramway was destroyed by rioters, who saw it as part of a plan to raise the price of coal. A replacement tramway that used L-shaped rails was laid by John Curr in 1776 and was one of the earliest cast-iron railways. The Sheffield Canal opened in 1819 allowing the large-scale transport of freight.\n\nThis was followed by the Sheffield and Rotherham Railway in 1838, the Sheffield, Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester Railway in 1845, and the Midland Railway in 1870. The Sheffield Tramway was started in 1873 with the construction of a horse tram route from Lady's Bridge to Attercliffe. This route was later extended to Brightside and Tinsley, and further routes were constructed to Hillsborough, Heeley, and Nether Edge. Due to the narrow medieval roads the tramways were initially banned from the town centre. An improvement scheme was passed in 1875; Pinstone Street and Leopold Street were constructed by 1879, and Fargate was widened in the 1880s. The 1875 plan also called for the widening of the High Street; disputes with property owners delayed this until 1895.\n\nSteel production in the 19th century involved long working hours, in unpleasant conditions that offered little or no safety protection. Friedrich Engels in his \"The Condition of the Working Class in England\" in 1844 described the conditions prevalent in the city at that time:\n\nSheffield became one of the main centres for trade union organisation and agitation in the UK. By the 1860s, the growing conflict between capital and labour provoked the so-called 'Sheffield Outrages', which culminated in a series of explosions and murders carried out by union militants. The Sheffield Trades Council organised a meeting in Sheffield in 1866 at which the United Kingdom Alliance of Organised Trades—a forerunner of the Trades Union Congress (TUC)—was founded.\n\nIn 1914 Sheffield became a diocese of the Church of England, and the parish church became a cathedral. During the First World War the Sheffield City Battalion suffered heavy losses at the Somme and Sheffield itself was bombed by a German zeppelin.\n\nThe recession of the 1930s was only halted by the increasing tension as the Second World War loomed. The steel factories of Sheffield were set to work making weapons and ammunition for the war. As a result, once war was declared, the city once again became a target for bombing raids. In total there were 16 raids over Sheffield, but it was the heavy bombing over the nights of 12 and 15 December 1940 (now known as the Sheffield Blitz) when the most substantial damage occurred. More than 660 lives were lost and numerous buildings were destroyed.\n\nFollowing the war, the 1950s and 1960s saw many large scale developments in the city. The Sheffield Tramway was closed, and a new system of roads, including the Inner Ring Road, were laid out. Also at this time many of the old slums were cleared and replaced with housing schemes such as the Park Hill flats, and the Gleadless Valley estate.\nSheffield's traditional manufacturing industries (along with those of many other areas in the UK), declined during the 20th century. In the 1980s, it was the setting for two films written by locally-born Barry Hines: \"Looks and Smiles\", a 1981 film that portrayed the depression that the city was enduring, and \"Threads\", a 1984 television film that simulated a nuclear winter in Sheffield after a warhead is dropped to the east of the city.\n\nThe building of the Meadowhall shopping centre on the site of a former steelworks in 1990 was a mixed blessing, creating much needed jobs but speeding the decline of the city centre. Attempts to regenerate the city were kick-started by the hosting of the 1991 World Student Games and the associated building of new sporting facilities such as the Sheffield Arena, Don Valley Stadium and the Ponds Forge complex. Sheffield began construction of a tram system in 1992, with the first section opening in 1994.\n\nStarting in 1995, the \"Heart of the City Project\" has seen public works in the city centre: the Peace Gardens were renovated in 1998, the Millennium Gallery opened in April 2001, and a 1970s town hall extension was demolished in 2002 to make way for the Winter Garden, which opened on 22 May 2003. A series of other projects grouped under the title Sheffield One aim to regenerate the whole of the city centre.\n\nOn 25 June 2007, flooding caused millions of pounds worth of damage to buildings in the city and led to the loss of two lives. Since 2012, there have been disputes between the city council and residents over the fate of the city's 36,000 highway trees, with 4,000 having been felled as part of a scheme to maintain the city streets. However, there have been plans for the highway maintenance to replant all felled trees across the city, including those historically felled and not previously replanted.\n\nIn July 2013 the Sevenstone project, which aimed to demolish and rebuild a large part of the city centre, and had been on hold since 2009, was further delayed and the company developing it was dropped. The city council is looking for partners to take a new version of the plan forwards. In April 2014 the council, together with Sheffield University, proposed a plan to reduce the blight of empty shops in the city centre by offering them free of charge to small businesses on a month-by-month basis.\n\n\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\n"}

It is a part of the Dougherty County School System. The school educates students in grades 9-12.\n\nAlbany High School was established in 1886 after H.M. McIntosh, editor of the \"Albany News and Advertiser\", initiated a campaign to raise the funds necessary to erect the school. It was the first high school in the county.\n\nTwo years after the school opened, it was destroyed by a fire of unknown origin. Classes were temporarily held in the town courthouse while the academy was rebuilt.\n\nAfter student enrollment rapidly increased during the first two decades, overcrowding led to expansion until a building was built in 1908. Located at the intersection of Monroe Street and Society Avenue, it contained ten classrooms.\nIn 1925, the high school moved to 1000 North Jefferson Street. In the fall of 1954 the school shifted to its current building on Residence Avenue. In the fall of 1999, a Magnet Honors Program was added to the curriculum.\n\nOn June 6, 2017, the Dougherty County School System voted to close the school.\n\nThe boys' basketball team has been coached by Archie Chatmon for more than 30 years, during which time he has accrued a winning 56%.\n\nCoach Chatmon has appeared in two State Championship games, losing twice to their cross town rival Westover in 1990 and 1993.\n\nThe school won one State Championship in 1959.\n\nThe 1996 team was considered the best team in school history. The team went 22-0 in the regular season but was swept in a best of 3 by Hardaway in the first round of the AAA State Playoffs.\n\nHugh Mills Stadium is used by all four public high schools: the Albany Indians (now closed), Dougherty Trojans, Monroe Tornadoes, and Westover Patriots football and track teams. It is also the host of the girls' state track meet for all five GHSA classifications. When it was constructed, the stadium was dedicated to Hugh M. Mills, the school's principal from 1923-1925. The stadium is located near the school, at 601 North Van Buren Street.\n\nAlbany High was the only school in the Dougherty County School System to have an on-site football stadium; because of this, all the high schools in Dougherty County use Hugh Mills as a home field. To alleviate confusion during games between schools, signs are posted at each of the entrance gates to designate the home team. If the three schools have home games on the same weekend, games are played on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights.\n\n\n\nThere are 51 teachers at Albany High, resulting in a student-teacher ratio of 15:1.\n\n\n"}

It is in the Brazilian state of Amazonas. Its population was 65,844 (2019) and its area is 3,225 km²\n\nTogether with the neighbouring Colombian city of Leticia and the Peruvian city of Santa Rosa de Yavari, the urban area has more than 100,000 residents spread along the Amazon River. The first Portuguese settlement in the area was founded in the 18th century as a military outpost. It became an autonomous municipality on February 1, 1983. Formerly, it was part of the municipality of Benjamin Constant. The city is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Alto Solimões.\n\nThe word \"Tabatinga\" is of indigenous origin, coming from the Tupi \"tobatinga\", having its meaning designated as \"white clay\" or \"soil white\". It is believed that the indigenous people referred to the region with that name because of the white clay found abundantly at the bottom of the region's rivers. In the Tupi Guarani, the word also means \"small house\".\n\nIn the middle of the 17th century, near of the Amazon River, the foundation of a village by the Jesuits was registered by the Portuguese empire. A military post and tax office were established near the site in 1766 to become a border region with Colombia and Peru. Fernando da Costa Ataíde Teives was responsible for the creation of a military post in the region and also created a border post between the domains of the Kingdom of Portugal and Spain, alongside other military posts. The town of São Francisco Xavier de Tabatinga was then established. Of the three main colonial border settlements (São Francisco Xavier de Tabatinga, Vila Ipiranga and Vila Bittencourt), only the first was actively developing. On June 28, 1866, near the village, the border between Brazil and Peru was drawn. Until then, the region was administratively subordinated to the municipality of São Paulo de Olivença, however many few municipalities were established in the region. In 1898, with the dismantling of the territory of São Paulo de Olivença and the emancipation of the district of Benjamin Constant, the city of Tabatinga became part of the newly created municipality, including it as one of the subdivisions of the main district.\n\nA post between the borders of Tabatinga and Leticia in 1924 consistently defined the borders between Brazil and Colombia. On 4 June 1968, under Federal Law 5.449, the entire area of the municipality of Benjamin Constant, to which Tabatinga was subordinated, was classified by the Brazilian government as a National Security Area, due to its extensive open border with other countries and its poor border surveillance. For a long time Tabatinga was a district of Benjamin Constant. Tabatinga's political emancipation occurred on December 10, 1981, under the constitutional amendment of the State of Amazonas No. 12, which now defines the Tabatinga district as an autonomous municipality. The installation of municipal offices took place on January 1, 1983.\n\nThe population of Tabatinga municipality is quite heterogeneous. It is formed by Brazilians, Peruvians, Colombians, among them indigenous people of different ethnic groups, most of whom are Tikunas and Kokamas. Among the Brazilians in Tabatinga, there is the rotating population, corresponding to the military of the armed forces, bank branch workers and people who work for public agencies of the Brazilian government, because it is a border region, a large number of federal police officers, federal revenue agents, federal prosecutors, among others, are seen. The Ticunas Indians form the largest ethnic group in Tabatinga, and the Tukuna Umariaçu indigenous reserve is found in the region of the municipality, inhabited by a majority belonging to this ethnic group. The official language of the municipality is Portuguese, but Spanish and tribals languages are understood, including Tikuna language.\n\nThe city's economy is driven by a significant portion of the informal economy and subsistence agriculture, it is also made up of public sector jobs and the extensive financial exchange of the Colombian city of Leticia, which, based on dollar regulation, takes place in parallel in the city between the Colombian Peso and the Brazilian Real.\n\nDue to the extensive border with Colombia and Peru, Tabatinga is considered, by the Federal Police and the Brazilian Army, one of the main points of entry of cocaine into Brazil. According to police authorities Brazilian, after beyond Brazil's southernmost borders, the precarious enforcement and extensive problems of neighboring nations with the illicit production of narcotics make Tabatinga one of the frequent points of entry of drugs into Brazil, bound for the country's major cities.\n\n"}

Though her film career was brief, she was a trailblazer for socially critical art cinema in Hong Kong's populist film industry, as well as its first noted woman director.\n\nTang was born in Yunnan province, China. She graduated from the University of Southern California.\n\nTang's best-known films are her first two, \"The Arch\" (1968) and \"China Behind\" (1974). The first film looks at the subjugation of women and their sexuality in a traditional village through the story of a widow's unconsummated passion for a male houseguest. The second follows the harrowing journey of a group of college students trying to cross illegally into Hong Kong from a China torn by the Cultural Revolution.\n\nThe bleak portrait in \"China Behind\" of both communist China and capitalist Hong Kong brought upon it a thirteen-year ban by the British colonial authorities. In addition to their provocative themes, both films used stylistic devices, such as freeze-frames and expressionistic color, possibly inspired by the European art cinema of the 1960s.\n\nTang made two more, less noted, films, \"Sup Sap Bup Dup\" (1975) and \"The Hong Kong Tycoon\" (1979). She also launched the territory's first serious film journal, \"Close-Up\", in 1976. It stopped publishing in 1979 (Bordwell, 2000).\n\nShe ceased filmmaking and emigrated to the United States in 1979, becoming a respected restaurateur in Los Angeles. Many critics, however, see her influence in the so-called Hong Kong New Wave of edgy, groundbreaking young filmmakers in the late '70s and early '80s.\n\n"}

{"id": "1852035", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1852035", "title": "Buffalo mozzarella", "text": "Buffalo mozzarella\n\nBuffalo mozzarella (; ) is a mozzarella made from the milk of Italian Mediterranean buffalo. It is a dairy product traditionally manufactured in Campania, especially in the provinces of Caserta and Salerno.\n\nThe term mozzarella derives from the procedure called \"mozzare\" which means \"cutting by hand\", separating from the curd, and serving in individual pieces, that is, the process of separation of the curd into small balls. It is appreciated for its versatility and elastic texture and often called \"the queen of the Mediterranean cuisine\", \"white gold\" or \"the pearl of the table\".\n\nThe buffalo mozzarella sold as \"Mozzarella di Bufala Campana\" has been granted the status of \"Denominazione di origine controllata\" (DOC – \"Controlled designation of origin\") since 1993. Since 1996 it is also protected under the EU's Protected Designation of Origin or DOP Denominazione di origine protetta and Protected Geographical Indication schemes. The protected origin's appellation requires that it may only be produced with a traditional recipe in select locations in the regions of Campania, Lazio, Apulia and Molise.\n\nIn Italy, the cheese is produced nationwide using Italian buffalo's milk under the government's official name \"Mozzarella di latte di bufala\" because Italian buffalo is in all Italian regions. Only selected type \"Mozzarella di bufala campana PDO\" is produced in areas ranging from Rome in Lazio to Paestum near Salerno in Campania, and there are production areas in the province of Foggia, Apulia, and in Venafro, Molise. Buffalo mozzarella is a €300m ($330m) per year industry in Italy, which produces around 33,000 tonnes of it every year, with 16 percent sold abroad (mostly in the European Union). France and Germany are the main importers, but sales to Japan and Russia are growing.\n\nApart from Italy, its birthplace, buffalo mozzarella is manufactured in many other countries around the world. There are producers in Switzerland, the United States, Australia, Mexico, Brazil, Canada, China, Japan, Venezuela, Argentina, the United Kingdom, near Macroom in Ireland, Spain, Sweden, Colombia, Thailand, Israel, Egypt, India and South Africa, all using milk from their own herds of water buffaloes.\n\nBuffalo mozzarella from Campania bears the \"Mozzarella di Bufala Campana\" trademark. In 1993, it was granted Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) status, in 1996 the trademark received registry number 1107/96 and in 2008 the European Union granted Mozzarella di Bufala Campana Protected Geographical Status and PDO indicator. The Consorzio per la Tutela del Formaggio di Bufala Campana (\"Consortium for the Protection of the Buffalo Cheese of Campania\") is an organization of approximately 200 producers, that, under Italian law, is responsible for the \"protection, surveillance, promotion and marketing\" of Mozzarella di Bufala Campana.\n\nAmong the many other Italian cheeses that have PDO status are Gorgonzola, Parmigiano-Reggiano and Asiago cheese.\n\nThe history of water buffalo in Italy is not settled. One theory is that Asian water buffalo were brought to Italy by Goths during the migrations of the early medieval period. However, according to the Consorzio per la Tutela del Formaggio Mozzarella di Bufala Campana, the \"most likely hypothesis\" is that they were introduced by Normans from Sicily in 1000, and that Arabs had introduced them into Sicily. The Consorzio per la Tutela also refers to fossil evidence (the prehistoric European Water Buffalo, \"Bubalus murrensis\") suggesting that water buffalo may have originated in Italy. A fourth theory is that water buffalo were brought from Mesopotamia into the Near East by Arabs and then introduced into Europe by pilgrims and returning crusaders.\n\n\"In ancient times, the buffalo was a familiar sight in the countryside, since it was widely used as a draught animal in ploughing compact and watery terrains, both because of its strength and the size of its hooves, which do not sink too deeply into moist soils.\"\n\nReferences to cheese products made from water buffalo milk appeared for the first time at the beginning of the twelfth century. Buffalo mozzarella became widespread throughout the south of Italy from the second half of the eighteenth century, before which it had been produced only in small quantities.\n\nProduction in and around Naples was briefly interrupted during World War II, when retreating German troops slaughtered the area's water buffalo herds, and recommenced a few years after the armistice was signed.\n\nOn March 21, 2008, the popular US newspaper The New York Times published an article in which reported the difficulties encountered by the Campania producers of mozzarella in avoiding the contamination of dioxins of dairy products, exclusively in the Caserta area, and managing the resulting crisis in local sales. The article, later referenced by blogs and other publications, referred to the Naples waste management issue and referred to other pieces published by the International Herald Tribune and various other national and international newspapers.\n\nThese articles marked the beginning of an international media attention that raised the threshold of collective attention on the potential harmfulness of buffalo mozzarella from Campania. In particular, they pointed out to varying degrees a relationship between the fires of garbage heaps and the release of dioxins and other cancerous substances, which would end up in the pastures of dairy animals. Alarmed by some positive findings in the dioxin test, the South Korean government was among the first to prohibit the importation of Italian buffalo mozzarella, promising to remove the ban only when the findings confirmed the possible contamination and identification of responsible producers.\n\nA chain reaction followed, in which several countries including Japan, China, Russia and Germany took various measures ranging from the mere raising of the attention threshold to the suspension of imports. The Italian institutions activated almost immediately, even in response to pressing requests from the European Union, a series of checks and suspended, in some cases, the sale of dairy products from the incriminated provinces. Tests had shown levels of dioxins higher than normal in at least 14% of samples taken in the provinces of Naples, Caserta and Avellino. In the provinces of Salerno and Benevento, no control indicated dioxins positivity.\n\nIn any case, the contamination has affected, in a limited defined manner, the farms used to produce the PDO buffalo mozzarella DOP. On 19 April, China definitively removed the ban on mozzarella, originally activated on 28 March 2008, and tests held in December 2013 in Germany on behalf of four Italian consumer associations have highlighted dioxin and heavy metal levels at least five times lower than the legal limit.\n\nTo produce of cheese, a cheese maker requires of cow milk but only of buffalo milk. Producing 1 kg of butter requires of cow milk but only of buffalo milk.\n\nThe steps required to produce buffalo mozzarella are:\n\nThe digestive system of water buffaloes permits them to turn low grade vegetation into rich milk which, due to its higher percentage of solids, provides higher levels of protein, fat and minerals than cow milk.\n\nContents for buffalo milk:\nGenerally, buffalo mozzarella is eaten with calzone, vegetable, salad (for example, insalata Caprese), on pizza (a low moisture content buffalo mozzarella is preferred), on grilled bread, with tomatoes, or by itself accompanied by olive oil.\n\n\n"}

The highest number of Central African athletes entered in a team for an Olympics is 15, occurring at both the 1988 and 1992 Summer Olympics.\n\nThe sole archer for the Central African Republic competing in the 2000 Summer Olympics was Henriette Youanga, in the women's individual. She took part in the two ranking rounds on 16 September at the Sydney International Archery Park. She scored 238 and 252 in the ranking rounds; placing 63rd out of the 64 competitors in each round, as well as overall. These rounds were used to allocate archers against each other in the single elimination tournament. Based on the result, Youanga was drawn against Natalia Valeeva of Italy, who had finished second overall in the ranking rounds. The match between the two took place the following day, with Valeeva winning by 166 points to Youanga's 126.\n\nThe Central African Republic was represented by two athletes in athletics; Mickaël Conjungo in the men's discus throw and Maria-Joëlle Conjungo in the women's 100 metres hurdles. Mickaël Conjungo, competing in his third Olympic Games, threw a foul in his first throw in the discus, but recorded a distance of with his second throw. His third throw was shorter, at , so his second throw was counted as the longest for the round. This mean he finished in sixteenth place, ending his appearances at the Games since only the first 12 competitors qualified for the following round.\n\nMaria-Joëlle Conjungo took part in the 100 metres on 25 September in the second heat. She finished in seventh place with a time of 13.95 seconds; the top six qualified for the following round, four automatically and then those in fifth and sixth place due to finishing among the four fastest runners up overall.\n"}

The Saskatchewan Rush play out of the SaskTel Centre.\n\nThe NLL announced that Edmonton, Alberta would receive an NLL franchise on May 5, 2005. They played their home games at Rexall Place. The Edmonton team was owned by businessman Bruce Urban, who purchased the dormant Ottawa Rebel to start the Edmonton team.\nAlthough early reports suggested that they would be playing as the Edmonton Speed, they selected the name Rush on June 9, 2005.\n\nOn February 17, 2006, the Rush recorded the first victory in their franchise history, defeating the Calgary Roughnecks 12-11 in a thrilling game, scoring the winning goal with only 0.2 seconds left in the game. Their first \"home\" victory didn't come until their second season, when they defeated the Philadelphia Wings 13-12 on January 6, 2007 in the season opener.\n\nAfter starting the 2008 NLL season with an 0-5 record, the Rush fired the franchise's original head coach and general manager, Paul Day, and replaced him with former NLL Coach and GM of the Year, Bob Hamley. The Rush finished the season last in the West with a 4-12 record, and after rebuilding much of the team in the off-season, the Rush struggled again in 2009. After finishing last in the West for the second straight season, Hamley was fired.\n\nDuring Edmonton's playoff run in 2015 Urban began threatening to move the team, telling the Edmonton Sun \"It appears that it's coming to an end. After much speculation, the team officially announced they'd be moving to Saskatoon, Saskatchewan to play as the Saskatchewan Rush beginning in 2016. Urban cited the lack of a long-term deal at Rogers Place, which was slated to replace Rexall Place as Edmonton's main arena. Additionally, the Oilers refused to let the Rush put any of their signage at Rexall Place, a move that Urban claimed harmed the Rush's marketing efforts.\n\nThe arrival of the Rush created another version of \"The Battle Of Alberta\". The head coach of the Edmonton Rush however, has come under fire by the Calgary Roughnecks. The Rush took out ads in Calgary newspapers before their first meeting that the Rush would \"Open a Can\" on the Roughnecks.\n\nThis proved to backfire as the Roughnecks defeated the Rush in their first meeting.\n\nThe tactic continued though when the Rush were playing the Toronto Rock, but once again it proved to backfire as the Rock easily won.\n\nHowever, Calgary tried this tactic against Edmonton before the April 5, 2008 game by taking an ad in the Edmonton Sun saying that Edmonton was a \"City of Losers\" instead of a city of champions. Just as it had for the Rush, the plan backfired as the Rush won 11-9.\n\nThe rivalry heated up March 13, 2009 in Edmonton as Calgary built up a 14-3 halftime lead over the Rush. At the one second mark of the 3rd quarter, a line brawl broke out between the two teams resulting in nine fighting majors and nine misconducts.\n\nEdmonton did get the upper hand in the first playoff meeting between the teams as the Rush won 11-7 in Calgary on May 1, 2010.\n\nEdmonton had played four games against the Calgary Roughnecks in the 2012 season. The Rush went 0/4 in the regular season when they faced the Calgary Roughnecks. Calgary ended their season with the record of 12-4, while Edmonton dominated the second ever playoff Battle Of Alberta with a win over Calgary 19-11. Edmonton went on to the Western division final against the Minnesota Swarm toward another win, 15-3, and headed to the NLL finals.\n\nThese are the top-ten point-scorers in franchise history.

The sudden release of 30 million cubic feet (849,000 m) of water resulted in a flash flood that killed three people camping in the park and caused $31 million in damage to the town of Estes Park, Colorado and other downstream areas.\n\nLawn Lake was originally a natural lake with a surface area of 16.4 acres (6.6 ha), located at an elevation of approximately 11,000 feet (3,400 m) in the Rocky Mountains. In 1903 a group of farmers from Loveland built a dam to increase it to a surface area of 48 acres (19.4 ha) for the purpose of providing water for irrigation in Loveland. \n\nOver the years the road that had been cut to permit construction of the dam fell into disrepair and ceased to exist. Because of the dam's remote and difficult location, inspection and repairs lapsed. The Colorado State Engineer determined that the probable cause of the dam failure was deterioration of lead caulking on the joint between the outlet pipe and the gate valve leading to internal erosion of the earth-fill dam. There had been issues reported during inspections in 1951, 1975, 1977 and 1978.\n\nWhen the dam failed the waters rushed down the Roaring River valley, which falls in , at a peak rate of 18,000 cubic feet per second (510 m/s), scouring a large gully out of the mountain stream and killing one person camping alongside it. At this rate, the lake emptied in about half an hour. When the waters reached the broader valley of Fall River at Horseshoe Park they spread out and slowed down, leaving behind a large alluvial fan of debris. The flood continued down Fall River and hit the Cascade Dam which stored water to run a hydroelectric plant about a mile (2 km) downstream. Cascade Dam failed from the onslaught and added its waters to the flood. The Aspenglen campground was destroyed and two campers who returned to recover camping gear lost their lives, due to insufficient warning from park rangers.\n\nThe flood entered the town of Estes Park and caused severe damage to 177 downtown businesses (75 percent of Estes Park's commercial activity). In Estes Park the flood joined the Big Thompson River and flowed into Lake Estes on the eastern edge of the city. Olympus Dam, part of the Colorado-Big Thompson Project, there withstood the deluge and the flood was halted.\n\nThe scar left by the scouring of Roaring River and the alluvial fan at Horseshoe Park are still very apparent 37 years later and will remain for a very long time. Twenty-five years after the accident, the extent of the former reservoir is still clearly evident, and at the mouth of the lake, the start of the Roaring River flows through the location of the former dam.\n\nAs a consequence of the dam failure, aging dams at Pear Reservoir, Bluebird Lake and Sandbeach Lake in the park were demolished and removed.\n\n"}

Products marketed as terminal servers can be very simple devices that do not offer any security functionality, such as data encryption and user authentication. The primary application scenario is to enable serial devices to access network server applications, or vice versa, where security of the data on the LAN is not generally an issue. There are also many terminal servers on the market that have highly advanced security functionality to ensure that only qualified personnel can access various servers and that any data that is transmitted across the LAN, or over the Internet, is encrypted. Usually companies which need a terminal server with these advanced functions want to remotely control, monitor, diagnose and troubleshoot equipment over a telecommunications network.\n\nA console server (also referred to as console access server, console management server, serial concentrator, or serial console server) is a device or service that provides access to the system console of a computing device via networking technologies.\n\nHistorically, a terminal server was a device that attached to serial RS-232 devices, such as \"green screen\" text terminals or serial printers, and transported traffic via TCP/IP, Telnet, SSH or other vendor-specific network protocols (e.g., LAT) via an Ethernet connection.\n\nDigital Equipment Corporation's DECserver 100 (1985), 200 (1986) and 300 (1991) are early examples of this technology. (An earlier version of this product, known as the DECSA Terminal Server was actually a test-bed or proof-of-concept for using the proprietary LAT protocol in commercial production networks.) With the introduction of inexpensive flash memory components, Digital's later DECserver 700 (1991) and 900 (1995) no longer shared with their earlier units the need to download their software from a \"load host\" (usually a Digital VAX or Alpha) using Digital's proprietary Maintenance Operations Protocol (MOP). In fact, these later terminal server products also included much larger flash memory and full support for the Telnet part of the TCP/IP protocol suite. Many other companies entered the terminal-server market with devices pre-loaded with software fully compatible with LAT and Telnet.\n\nA \"terminal server\" is used many ways but from a basic sense if a user has a serial device and they need to move data over the LAN, this is the product they need.\n\n\nA console server (console access server, console management server, serial concentrator, or serial console server) is a device or service that provides access to the system console of a computing device via networking technologies.\n\nMost commonly, a console server provides a number of serial ports, which are then connected to the serial ports of other equipment, such as servers, routers or switches. The consoles of the connected devices can then be accessed by connecting to the console server over a serial link such as a modem, or over a network with terminal emulator software such as telnet or ssh, maintaining survivable connectivity that allows remote users to log in the various consoles without being physically nearby.\n\nDedicated console server appliances are available from a number of manufacturers in many configurations, with the number of serial ports ranging from one to 96. These Console Servers are primarily used for secure remote access to Unix Servers, Linux Servers, switches, routers, firewalls, and any other device on the network with a console port. The purpose is to allow network operations center (NOC) personnel to perform secure remote data center management and out-of-band management of IT assets from anywhere in the world. Products marketed as Console Servers usually have highly advanced security functionality to ensure that only qualified personnel can access various servers and that any data that is transmitted across the LAN, or over the Internet, is encrypted. Marketing a product as a console server is very application specific because it really refers to what the user wants to do—remotely control, monitor, diagnose and troubleshoot equipment over a network or the Internet.\n\nSome users have created their own console servers using off-the-shelf commodity computer hardware, usually with multiport serial cards typically running a slimmed-down Unix-like operating system such as Linux. Such \"home-grown\" console servers can be less expensive, especially if built from components that have been retired in upgrades, and allow greater flexibility by putting full control of the software driving the device in the hands of the administrator. This includes full access to and configurability of a wide array of security protocols and encryption standards, making it possible to create a console server that is more secure. However, this solution may have a higher TCO, less reliability and higher rack-space requirements, since most industrial console servers have the physical dimension of one rack unit (1U), whereas a desktop computer with full-size PCI cards requires at least 3U, making the home-grown solution more costly in the case of a co-located infrastructure.\n\nAn alternative approach to a console server used in some cluster setups is to null-modem wire and daisy-chain consoles to otherwise unused serial ports on nodes with some other primary function.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1852078", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1852078", "title": "Dyck language", "text": "Dyck language\n\nIn the theory of formal languages of computer science, mathematics, and linguistics, a Dyck word is a balanced string of square brackets [ and ]. The set of Dyck words forms the Dyck language.\n\nDyck words and language are named after the mathematician Walther von Dyck. They have applications in the parsing of expressions that must have a correctly nested sequence of brackets, such as arithmetic or algebraic expressions.\n\nLet formula_1 be the alphabet consisting of the symbols [ and ]. Let formula_2 denote its Kleene closure.\nThe Dyck language is defined as:\n\nIt may be helpful to define the Dyck language via a context-free grammar in some situations.\nThe Dyck language is generated by the context-free grammar with a single non-terminal , and the production:\n\nThat is, \"S\" is either the empty string () or is \"[\", an element of the Dyck language, the matching \"]\", and an element of the Dyck language.\n\nAn alternative context-free grammar for the Dyck language is given by the production:\n\nThat is, \"S\" is zero or more occurrences of the combination of \"[\", an element of the Dyck language, and a matching \"]\", where multiple elements of the Dyck language on the right side of the production are free to differ from each other.\n\nIn yet other contexts it may instead be helpful to define the Dyck language by splitting formula_2 into equivalence classes, as follows.\nFor any element formula_5 of length formula_6, we define partial functions formula_7 and formula_8 by\n\nwith the understanding that formula_9 is undefined for formula_18 and formula_13 is undefined if formula_20. We define an equivalence relation formula_21 on formula_2 as follows: for elements formula_23 we have formula_24 if and only if there exists a sequence of zero or more applications of the formula_25 and formula_26 functions starting with formula_27 and ending with formula_28. That the sequence of zero operations is allowed accounts for the reflexivity of formula_21. Symmetry follows from the observation that any finite sequence of applications of formula_25 to a string can be undone with a finite sequence of applications of formula_26. Transitivity is clear from the definition.\n\nThe equivalence relation partitions the language formula_2 into equivalence classes. If we take formula_33 to denote the empty string, then the language corresponding to the equivalence class formula_34 is called the Dyck language.\n\n\nWe can define an equivalence relation formula_49 on the Dyck language formula_50. For formula_51 we have formula_52 if and only if formula_53, i.e. formula_10 and formula_44 have the same length. This relation partitions the Dyck language formula_56 where formula_57. Note that formula_58 is empty for odd formula_59.\n\nHaving introduced the Dyck words of length formula_59, we can introduce a relationship on them. For every formula_61 we define a relation formula_62 on formula_58; for formula_64 we have formula_65 if and only if formula_44 can be reached from formula_10 by a series of proper swaps. A proper swap in a word formula_68 swaps an occurrence of '][' with '[]'.\nFor each formula_69 the relation formula_62 makes formula_58 into a partially ordered set. The relation formula_62 is reflexive because an empty sequence of proper swaps takes formula_10 to formula_10. Transitivity follows because we can extend a sequence of proper swaps that takes formula_10 to formula_44 by concatenating it with a sequence of proper swaps that takes formula_44 to formula_78 forming a sequence that takes formula_10 into formula_78. To see that formula_62 is also antisymmetric we introduce an auxiliary function formula_82 defined as a sum over all prefixes formula_44 of formula_10:\n\nThe following table illustrates that formula_86 is strictly monotonic with respect to proper swaps.\n\nHence formula_87 so formula_88 when there is a proper swap that takes formula_10 into formula_90. Now if we assume that both formula_91 and formula_92, then there are non-empty sequences of proper swaps such formula_10 is taken into formula_44 and vice versa. But then formula_95 which is nonsensical. Therefore, whenever both formula_96 and formula_97 are in formula_62, we have formula_99, hence formula_62 is antisymmetric.\n\nThe partial ordered set formula_101 is shown in the illustration accompanying the introduction if we interpret a [ as going up and ] as going down.\n\nThere exist variants of the Dyck language with multiple delimiters, e.g., on the alphabet \"(\", \")\", \"[\", and \"]\". The words of such a language are the ones which are well-parenthesized for all delimiters, i.e., one can read the word from left to right, push every opening delimiter on the stack, and whenever we reach a closing delimiter then we must be able to pop the matching opening delimiter from the top of the stack.\n\n\n"}

Laidlaw Environmental Services, Inc., 528 U.S. 167 (2000), was a United States Supreme Court case that addressed the law regarding standing to sue and mootness.\n\nThe Court held that the plaintiff residents in the area of South Carolina's North Tyger River had standing to sue an industrial polluter, against whom various deterrent civil penalties were being pursued. Standing was properly based on the fact that the residents alleged that they would have used the river for recreational purposes, but could not because of the pollution.\n\nThe defendant polluter also claimed that the case was moot because it had ceased polluting, and had closed the factory responsible for the pollution complained of. The Court noted that the polluter still retained its license to operate such a factory, and could reopen similar operations elsewhere if not deterred by the fine sought. Therefore, the case was held not to be moot.\n\nThe Supreme Court's majority in \"Friends\" ruled that plaintiffs did not need to prove an actual (particular) harm to residents. Writing for the majority, Ruth Bader Ginsburg held that injury to the plaintiff came from lessening the \"aesthetic and recreational values of the area\" for residents and users of the river because of their knowledge of Laidlaw's repeated violations of its clean water permit.\n\nIn addition, the case held that a civil penalty could be enforced against an entity even though the interests protected were private. The court agreed with Congress in holding that civil penalties in the Clean Water Act cases \"do more than promote immediate compliance by limiting the defendant's economic incentive to delay its attainment of permit limits; they also deter future violations.\"\n\nThe 7-2 decision was written by Justice Ginsburg, and joined by Justices Rehnquist, Stevens, O'Connor, Kennedy, Souter, and Breyer.

It is an allegory referencing Fundamentalist self-perception during the Fundamentalist–Modernist Controversy. The song is in the form of AABA and has a 12 bar count. It is based on Jeremiah 12:9, \"Mine heritage is unto me as a speckled bird, the birds round about are against her; come ye, assemble all the beasts of the field, come to devour.\" It was recorded in 1936 by Roy Acuff. It was also later recorded by Johnny Cash and Kitty Wells (both in 1959), Pearly Brown (1961), Hank Locklin (1962), Marty Robbins (1966), Lucinda Williams (1978), Bert Southwood (1990), Marion Williams, and Jerry Lee Lewis. George Jones & The Smoky Mountain Boys also recorded it in the early 1970s (although that recording was not released until 2017). \n\nThe tune is the same apparently traditional melody used in the song \"Thrills That I Can't Forget,\" recorded by Welby Toomey and Edgar Boaz for Gennett in 1925, and the song \"I'm Thinking Tonight of My Blue Eyes,\" originally recorded by the Carter Family for Victor in 1929. The same melody was later used in the 1952 country hit \"The Wild Side of Life,\" sung by Hank Thompson, and the even more successful \"answer song\" performed by Kitty Wells called \"It Wasn't God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels\" in the same year. A notable instrumental version is found on the Grammy Award-Nominated album \"20th Century Gospel\" by Nokie Edwards and The Light Crust Doughboys on Greenhaw Records.\n\nThe connection between these songs is noted in the David Allan Coe song \"If That Ain't Country\" that ends with the lyrics \"I'm thinking tonight of my blue eyes/ Concerning a great speckled bird/ I didn't know God made honky-tonk angels/ and went back to the wild side of life.\"\n\nThe song is also referenced, and portions of the melody-line are used, in \"When the Silver Eagle Meets the Great Speckled Bird\" by Porter Wagoner. \n\n\"Something to Love\", by Jason Isbell and the 400 Unit references the song when speaking of learning music: \"They taught me how to make the chords and sing the words. I'm still singing like that great speckled bird.\"\n\nBoth the song \"The Great Speckled Bird\" and the passage from Jeremiah may be a poetic description of mobbing behavior.\n"}

The band moved from Little Rock to Washington, D.C. in 1992. The group disbanded in early 1998.\n\nIn 1989, the original Trusty lineup released the 7\" EP \"\"A Name to Depend On\"\" on Soma Records. They followed this with a self-titled LP on Truant Records. Truant pressed only 1,000 copies of the record, but then re-released it as a CD with bonus tracks under the name of \"The Paul Years - A Trusty Retrospective\". In the spring of 1992, the band recorded 7\" EP \"Cockatoo\" with Josh Bentley (of The Big Cats and Substance) on bass, before relocating to the Washington, D.C. area. \n\nIn 1994 and again in 1999, the original four members of Trusty reunited and played shows in Little Rock. This lineup (Bobby Matthews, James Brady, Bircho, and Paul Bowling) reunited in 2004 to work on a CD called \"Sugar Smack,\" featuring two new tracks and a collection of unreleased outtakes. It was eventually released on Max Recordings.\n\nBetween 1992 and 1996, Trusty worked to gain respect and recognition from the established D.C. punk rock scene. In the summer of 1992, Trusty recorded the 7\" EP \"Kathy's Keen\" on De Soto Records with their original drummer, Bircho. In the fall of 1992, with new bassist Brad Long (formerly of the Memphis hardcore band Sobering Consequences) and steady drummer Jim Schaffer (formerly of Washington D.C. based band Senator Flux), Trusty continued touring and writing songs for their CD Goodbye Dr. Fate, as well as several compilation CDs. \"Goodbye Dr. Fate\" was completed in the winter of 1994 and released in the spring of 1995. After extensive touring, Trusty released another CD in 1996 named The Fourth Wise Man, also on Dischord Records and continued to tour within North America and Europe. Four years after moving from Little Rock, Trusty became the first band originating from outside Washington, D.C. to be signed by Dischord Records.\nIn early 1998, Trusty disbanded. Bobby Matthews now sings and plays guitar in the Memphis-based band Dragoon, along with former Grifters members Tripp Lamkins and Stan Gallimore. Jim Schaffer has been playing drums with the Baltimore punk rock band, National razor, since 2002. \nComing Full Circle\n\nIn 2008, Trusty signed with record label DC-Jam Records to re-release their first songs ever recorded.

His father was a Scottish Presbyterian pastoralist. He came to the Port Phillip District as a child with his family and was educated at Scotch College, Melbourne and the University of Edinburgh, where he graduated in law. He was admitted to the Victorian bar in 1866 and practised law before becoming a pastoralist near Hamilton in the Western District.\n\nMacPherson was elected as a conservative to the Legislative Assembly for Portland in November 1864, and for Dundas in February 1866. In September 1869, when the liberal Premier James McCulloch resigned, MacPherson was commissioned as Premier; at 35 years and 11 months, he became Victoria's youngest Premier. His government was in a weak parliamentary position and had little prospect of survival. However it did succeed in passing an effective land selection act, allowing small farmers to select land on the squatters' pastoral runs, before being defeated in the Assembly and resigning in April 1870.\n\nMacPherson served as Chief Secretary in the third McCulloch government in 1875 to 1877, before retiring from politics in July 1878, still aged only 44. In 1880 he returned to Britain and settled in Surrey, where he died in 1894. He married Louisa Featherstonhaugh in 1858: they had seven children.\n\nIn a blog post on 30 October 2018, folk singer/songwriter and ballad collector Daniel Kelly asserted that John MacPherson is the identity behind many poems that were published in various Victorian newspapers from 1857 until 1874 under the pen name Ossian MacPherson. Ossian MacPherson was suggested to be a pseudonym used by James MacPherson. In particular, \"A Modest Minister\"\",\" directly refers to the 1874 election that MacPherson was running in and the poem targets his opposition. More directly, an article in the Geelong Advertiser on 20 January 1871 directly refers to 'Ossian' Macpherson as running in the 1971 election for Dundas.\n\nSince posting this article, a relative of an Ossian Macpherson has suggested that this was a real person and not a pseudonym. It remains unclear if others, including John Alexander, may have used the existing reputation of the poet to publish under his name.\n\n"}

{"id": "1852133", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1852133", "title": "Bas Rutten", "text": "Bas Rutten\n\nSebastian \"Bas\" Rutten (; born 24 February 1965) is a Dutch–American actor, retired mixed martial artist, kickboxer and professional wrestler. He was a UFC Heavyweight Champion, a three-time King of Pancrase world champion, and finished his career on a 22 fight unbeaten streak (21 wins, 1 draw). FightMetric wrote this when Rutten got inducted into the UFC Hall of Fame: \"FightMetric, the official statistics provider for the UFC, ran the numbers on Rutten's career. They back up the Dutchman's inclusion into the UFC Hall of Fame and then some. In the 4-hours, 27-minutes and 8-seconds he spent as a pro fighter, Rutten scored 13 knockdowns without getting dropped himself, his significant strike accuracy was 70.6%, the highest FightMetric has ever recorded, attempted a record 53 submissions and successfully swept his opponents a record 46 times.\" From 2007 to 2016, Rutten was the co-host of \"Inside MMA\" on AXS TV. Rutten became a naturalized American citizen receiving citizenship in the late 1990s. \n\nAs a professional fighter, one of his favorite tactics was the liver shot (both punch and kick), and he popularized its use in MMA. Rutten is known for his charisma and has capitalized on his celebrity status since retiring from fighting in 1999. He has worked as a color commentator in several MMA organizations, including Pride, and has appeared in numerous television shows, movies, and video games. He also coaches MMA and has authored several instructional materials.\n\nRutten was born in Tilburg, Netherlands. At the age of 6 he developed eczema and severe asthma. Bas's eczema meant he always wore long sleeves, turtle necks and gloves, and his asthma meant he was unable to partake in exercise, and was consequently relatively skinny. He was bullied on a daily basis as a child.\n\nBas started training in boxing in the backyard of an elementary school with a friend. Rutten became interested in martial arts at age 12 after his family went on vacation to France, where the movie \"Enter the Dragon\" starring Bruce Lee was playing at a local movie theatre. Bas could not get in because the movie was rated 17+, so he and his brother Sjoerd snuck into the theatre. After he saw the movie, he took an interest in martial arts. At first, his conservative parents did not allow him to pursue his interest but at age 14, after two years of begging his parents, they allowed him to practice taekwondo. He picked it up very quickly and after a few months he got in a street fight with the biggest bully in town. Rutten, now more confident, took the challenge and broke the bully's nose and KO'd him with the first punch he threw. The police came to his parents' house and Rutten was immediately prohibited by his parents from further practicing martial arts.\n\nAt age 21, he moved out of his parents' house and once again started training taekwondo. He was committed, eventually earning a 2nd degree black belt. He then began learning Kyokushin Karate and earned a 2nd degree black belt.\n\nAt the age of 20 he started competing in kickboxing while working also as a bouncer and model. He fought 16 times, winning the first 14 by knockout, 13 in the first round, and losing his final two fights. One of them would be against famed Frank Lobman for the European Muay Thai title on 12 February 1991, with Rutten losing by KO in the first round. According to Rutten, he signed up for the match while under the influence and without any kind of earlier preparation, but he decided not to pull out. Another of his most famous fights was against Rene Rooze, who bit Rutten's ear during the match. In response, Bas landed a knee to the groin, which interrupted the match and caused a brawl.\n\nRutten began his professional mixed martial arts career when he was working as an entertainer. He was scouted by Chris Dolman and invited to train at the Fighting Network RINGS Holland dojo. Though his first training was a difficult start for him, he focused in learning the rudiments of the art. In 1993, when Japanese pro wrestlers Masakatsu Funaki and Minoru Suzuki traveled to the Netherlands to scout fighters for their new \"hybrid wrestling\" organization, Pancrase, Rutten was immediately chosen. A precursor to modern mixed martial arts, the organization was the first of its kind and featured fighting with no closed fisted strikes to the face, and boasted early MMA names Frank Shamrock, Vernon White, Maurice Smith, Ken Shamrock, and Guy Mezger.\n\nIn September 1993, Rutten had his debut in Pancrase against the 45lb heavier Ryushi Yanagisawa, knocking him out with palms and knee strikes in only 48 seconds. The KO was so brutal that Yanagisawa was carried from the ring and spent two days in hospital, with Bas himself fearing for his life. Rutten's second match, however, would be against a more experienced opponent, Takaku Fuke, and it would expose his main weakness, which was his lack of groundfighting experience. Fuke took Rutten down and locked an armbar, which forced the Dutch fighter to spend a rope escape, though Bas was eventually able to land a knee strike to the liver to finish the match with a win.\n\nHis third match would be his first loss in Pancrase, as he faced a superior opponent in the form of Pancrase founder Masakatsu Funaki. Rutten was taken down and forced to close guard, moment in which he accidentally hit Funaki with a closed-fisted punch. When he tried to apologize, the Japanese fighter capitalized and executed a toehold, making Rutten tap out. At that point of his career, Rutten realized the importance of the grappling aspect, and he started taping Pancrase trainings in order to practice those moves with his trainee Leon Van Dijk.\n\nThe training paid off, as Rutten submitted Japanese wrestler Kazuo \"Yoshiki\" Takahashi with an inverted heel hook during a grappling exchange which had been overconfidently initiated by Kazuo. The hold completely broke Takahashi's shin bone and gained Rutten an honorary 5th degree black belt in Kyokushin Budokai by Jon Bluming after he learned the fact. Rutten then got his first high level win against the other co-founder of Pancrase, the previously undefeated Minoru Suzuki. The Dutch fighter knocked him down with a body kick, resisted successfully all his submissions attempts on the ground and then hit a knee to the liver on a downed Suzuki, finishing him off. Rutten later said that this win was one of the happiest moments of his life.\n\nJust 20 days later, Rutten faced another steep test, fighting future UFC Hall of Famer Ken Shamrock, who was then one of the best Pancrase fighters. This time the Dutch had Masakatsu Funaki himself in his corner, as he had got the Japanese to formally teach him shoot wrestling. Rutten turned in a hard effort, being taken down by Shamrock and held under dominant position for most of the match. The again more experienced Shamrock made Rutten spend rope escapes by submitting him with a pair of heel hooks and a rear naked choke, and although Rutten still tried on, he was ultimately choked out. After this, Rutten decided to omit strikes from his training and focus in only grappling, and he bounced back from the loss with a submission win over Brazilian jiu-jitsu black belt Jason DeLucia, trading submission attempts with him before ending the match with a guillotine choke.\n\nIn December 1994, Rutten then participated in one of the greatest events in mixed martial arts history to the point, the King of Pancrase Tournament. The winner of this tournament would be crowned the first champion of Pancrase. Rutten was one of the four #1 seeds in the tournament, and his first fight was against MMA newcomer and future UFC champion Frank Shamrock. The fight was a controversial one, as Rutten locked an earlier rear naked choke under the ropes, only to have the referee to break it up without deducting a lost point from Frank. After that point, the two nullified each other until the end of the match, which saw an upset decision win for Shamrock. Frank also left the match with a broken nose by a high kick.\n\nRutten found a measure of redemption after the upset loss by choking out expert grappler and King of Pancrase Tournament Finalist Manabu Yamada in his next fight, on 26 January 1995. Rutten was taken to the ground, but he clamped an arm triangle choke from half guard and exerted such a pressure that Yamada, refusing to tap out, was choked out and remained unconscious with his eyes wide open after the hold. Thanks to this performance against the tournament finalist, Rutten received a rematch and a title shot against tournament winner and then current King of Pancrase Ken Shamrock for the King of Pancrase title on 10 March. The match was very anticipated, but it ended early when Shamrock executed a kneebar and forced Rutten to submit. According to the Dutch, the loss was due to his training partner Funaki teaching him the wrong way to escape a kneebar, which made Rutten spin in the opposite direction giving a tighter hold for Shamrock. After this failure, Rutten focused on grappling even harder and started training 2 to 3 times a day solely on submissions.\n\nAgain, Rutten's new training paid off, and he stole a win from Takaku Fuke with an armbar from the guard and a finishing heel hook. He then faced another dangerous striker, American kickboxing champion Maurice Smith, who in turn fell down to the mat to avoid Bas's striking. Rutten grappled with him and showed his technical brilliance, firstly submitting Smith with a heel hook performed with his own chin and later executing a figure-four toehold for the win. After dispatching next Jason DeLucia by submission as well, Rutten got a rematch with Frank Shamrock on 23 July. Their fight was similar to the first bout, with both men trading positions and holds, and again the referee controversially broke up two kneebars which were performed by Rutten next to the ropes, but this time Rutten would win the split decision.\n\nThe win granted him a challenge title match in September 1995 against the King of Pancrase Minoru Suzuki, which was their rematch from the fight at the beginning of their careers. The match was long and intense, as Suzuki rode Rutten for most of their exchanges in the bout, and actually managed to force him to spend a rope escape with a tight kneebar. Rutten held his own through his defensive acumen, occasionally countering with guillotine chokes and a surprising rolling kneebar from standing, until the match came to its last minutes. After getting from under a mount, Rutten threw a front kick to the body which downed Suzuki and followed with a guillotine choke, making the King of Pancrase tap out.\n\nAfter putting his title defenses on hold due to an injury, Rutten returned to the ring in a rematch against Maurice Smith. Overwhelmed by Rutten's strikes, Smith opted for taking him down every time possible, but Rutten ended up performing a half guard sweep into a rear naked choke for the tap out. His next time would be against the man he debuted against in Pancrase, Ryushi Yanagisawa, and this time the match lasted 27:35. Despite breaking his hand during the match, Rutten scored three consecutive submissions through the affair before ending it with another rear naked choke.\n\nIn March 1996, Rutten faced Lion's Den fighter and future Ultimate Fighting Championship winner Guy Mezger. Through the fight, Rutten dominated the stand-up with liver shots and palm strikes, forcing Mezger to take him down and meet him on the ground. There Mezger was able to control Rutten, but was unable to score a submission, while the Dutch defended and capitalized on the stand-up segments to inflict damage. At the end, after a leglock exchange, Rutten locked a heel hook variation to submit Mezger.\n\nOn 16 May 1996 Rutten defended his title before Frank Shamrock in their third match, which was also for Shamrock's interim King of Pancrase title. Controlling the takedowns as usual, Shamrock gained north-south position several times, but was unable to submit Rutten, and Rutten in turn knocked him down with an open-handed uppercut. The two fighters struggled, and even fell off the ring in a failed takedown. In midst of the fight, Frank famously taunted Rutten by sticking out his tongue at him during a leglock exchange, which moved Bas to hit him in the face with a close-fisted punch, losing a point by red card as Shamrock expected. At the end, however, Rutten won the fight by TKO due to an eye cut, unifying the King of Pancrase belts.\n\nRight after his match against Shamrock, Rutten had his rubber match against Jason DeLucia. The fight was controversial for DeLucia repeatedly claiming Rutten had hit him with a closed fist, which cost the Dutch fighter a yellow card and later a red card. In response, Rutten hit several shots to DeLucia's liver, rupturing it and knocking him out painfully.\n\nAt Pancrase 1996 Anniversary Show, taking place on 7 September, Rutten defended his undisputed title against Masakatsu Funaki in what is considered to be one of the greatest fights in Pancrase history. The Japanese wrestler came near finishing the match earlier with an ankle lock, but Rutten escaped miraculously and proceeded to fend Funaki off for the rest of the bout, utilizing the same stalling strategy he had used against Suzuki. Funaki made a wide usage of the knee-on-stomach and mount position to initiate leglock attacks, but the Dutch countered every time and eventually pushed Masakatsu away, moment in which the Japanese threw an illegal kick to Rutten while he was getting up. In response, the Dutch fighter knocked Funaki down with a palm strike, and then completely broke his nose with a second palm strike to a supine Masakatsu. The stunned Japanese tried to trade hits with Rutten, only for Bas to capitalize on this with his famed striking game. Rutten knocked him down twice with palms and knees, and he followed landing a lengthy, unanswered string of strikes until a knee to the face finally downed Funaki for the KO victory. In doing so, he became a three-time King of Pancrase.\n\nRutten described the war with Funaki in an interview: \n\nHis next fight was an anticipated rematch with Manabu Yamada, which lasted only 0:54 before Rutten made him to tap out to a leg-entangled toehold. Following the match, he relinquished his title to be present for the birth of his second daughter.\n\nOn 22 March 1997 Rutten returned to Pancrase in a match against Osami Shibuya, a bout in which he was unexpectedly forced to fight for the draw after his own sternum broke through the struggle. The Dutchman avenged the accident in a rematch with Shibuya, in which he submitted the Japanese with a spinal lock from ura-gatame position he nicknamed \"Bas Rutten Neck Crank.\"\n\nRutten returned to Pancrase, taking 8 more victories, bringing his unbeaten streak up to 19 straight fights.\n\nRutten left Pancrase as one of the most dominant fighters in the history of the organization. MMA legend Ken Shamrock was the only fighter Rutten did not avenge a loss to. In 2000, when Rutten was PRIDE FC's color commentator, a third fight with Shamrock was entertained. Rutten agreed to come out of retirement to fight Shamrock in PRIDE FC. However, Shamrock stated that he already beat Rutten twice and that a third time wasn't necessary. Later, in 2002, Rutten said that he would not fight Shamrock again even if it was offered to him because of the friendship they developed over the years, and that he could not put his mind and heart into fighting Ken.\n\nRutten was originally told about Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) before its first event in 1993, when would-be UFC competitor Ken Shamrock proposed it to him, but Rutten decided to stay in Pancrase, as he felt the \"no rules\" format was too dangerous and he did not want to risk his career so early. However, he signed with the UFC in 1998, after his Pancrase career. Rutten entered the UFC with a massive amount of hype; he was undefeated in his last 19 fights and was touted by the organization as the \"world's greatest martial artist.\"\n\nRutten was originally scheduled to fight heavyweight champion Randy Couture in a title match for the UFC Heavyweight Championship in his first fight, but Couture had a contract dispute and left the UFC to sign with a different promotion. The title was then stripped from Couture and a tournament of sorts was set up to determine the next champion. Thus, the Dutchman's first fight in his quest for the UFC belt was against Fighting Network RINGS exponent Tsuyoshi Kohsaka at UFC 18. During the bout, Rutten was repeatedly taken down and struck with ground and pound, but he ended up scoring a dramatic KO with just a minute left in overtime. The fight was a source of controversy because referee John McCarthy seemed to unfairly stand the fight up when Kohsaka was mounted on Rutten and actively landing clean effective punches.\n\nOn 7 May 1999, at UFC 20, Rutten faced Kevin Randleman for the UFC Heavyweight Championship. The first four minutes consisted of Rutten taking unanswered punishment from his guard, getting blood on his face, but after the fight was stood up to check Rutten's cut, Rutten landed a hard kick to Randleman's liver, slowing his pace for the rest of the fight. They then exchanged strikes in Bas's guard, with the Dutch fighter opening a cut in Randleman via elbow strikes on top of his head, until the end of the overtime. The fight went to the judges, and they gave the split decision win to Rutten, crowning him as UFC Heavyweight Champion. This victory met a heated controversy from fans and professionals of the sport alike, among them Randleman's corner and Mark Coleman, who criticized the judges's decision. Fight judging at that point was not based on the current 10-point must system, but on whom the judges felt won the fight overall.\n\nRutten vacated the title later in the year, in order to drop down to middleweight (now known as light heavyweight) a weight closer to his natural weight, in a bid to try to become the first person to hold a UFC title in two weight classes. However, he would end up never continuing his career, as while training for his next UFC fight in 1999 he suffered multiple serious injuries, including blowing out his knee (a long running injury), tearing his biceps, and suffering a neck injury. He was forced to retire from MMA competition for the time being, by doctor's orders.\n\nHe was proposed a fight against Kazushi Sakuraba when he was contacted by Pride Fighting Championships, but Rutten declined due to an insufficient fight purse, preferring to sign up as a fight commentator. He was replaced by Wanderlei Silva in the card.\n\nOn 22 May 2015 UFC President Dana White appeared on Inside MMA to announce that Rutten would be inducted into the UFC Hall of Fame during International Fight Week in July. Rutten is the first European to be inducted, taking his place in the \"Pioneers\" wing of the UFC's new look Hall of Fame.\n\nFormer UFC Light Heavyweight Champion Tito Ortiz has credited Rutten for inspiration during his early days. Ortiz said; \"I looked up to Bas Rutten. Bas was my idol. People were just so scared of fighting him, he was like the man. I thought that was what I need to do now. If I train as hard as he does then one day I'll be as good as him and two years later look where I am, I'm on top of the world. I've got to say thanks to him, (Bas) for helping me out by making me believe in dreams.\"\n\nIn May 2006, Rutten announced his return to MMA competition. Cleared by doctors to fight again, Rutten was slated to face Kimo Leopoldo in the now defunct World Fighting Alliance on 22 July 2006, at The Forum in Los Angeles. Two days before the event, Kimo tested positive for Stanozolol, an anabolic steroid. In place of Kimo, Rutten fought Ruben \"Warpath\" Villareal. Rutten took a first-round victory by way of technical knockout after low kicks left his opponent unable to stand. With that he brought up his professional record to 28 wins 4 losses and 1 draw. After the fight, Rutten tested positive for hydrocodone, morphine, and diphenhydramine.\n\nRutten competed in Japanese professional wrestling following his Pancrase tenure. He made his debut at the Inoki Bom-Ba-Ye 2000 event, where he teamed up with Alexander Otsuka to defeat the team of Naoki Sano and Ricco Rodríguez, with Rutten personally submitting Sano with a crossface chickenwing. He also wrestled in Battlarts, defeating Carl Malenko by KO via palm strike.\n\nIn 2002, Rutten debuted in New Japan Pro-Wrestling as a part of Antonio Inoki's MMA army. Before his first match, he was featured in vignettes learning the shining wizard from watching Keiji Mutoh tapes in order to adapt to NJPW professional wrestling. He mostly wrestled in singles matches, beating both rookies and veterans like Manabu Nakanishi, Hiroshi Tanahashi and Masayuki Naruse. In July, he challenged for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship against Yuji Nagata, but he was defeated. After three months, in October, he was featured in a special European Catch Wrestling Rules Match against Osamu Nishimura with Tony St. Clair as a special referee. The match went to time limit draw after ten rounds, despite Nishimura's illegal blows. The same month, Rutten dropped down to the junior heavyweight division and received another title match, this time against Koji Kanemoto for the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship, but he was unsuccessful.\n\nAfter his retirement from fighting in 1999, Rutten focused on becoming an actor, getting small parts on TV shows such as \"Martial Law\", \"18 Wheels of Justice\", \"The King of Queens\", \"Lights Out\" and the Canadian series \"Freedom\", as well as appearing in low budget movies such as \"Shadow Fury\", \"The Eliminator\", and the comedy short \"The Kingdom of Ultimate Power\" which was featured in the 2005 L.A. Film Festival. It also won the first prize at the short film festival in NY for \"best comedy\".\n\nRutten was also the color commentator for the English productions of Pride Fighting Championships events, calling nearly every event from Pride 1 through the 2005 Grand Prix. Known for his sense of humor and first hand knowledge of the sport, Rutten quickly became a fan favorite commentator. In April 2006 he announced that he would not continue to announce for Pride, due to the constant flying to Japan, and being away from his family every month.\nRutten has a cameo in the video game \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" on the in-game TV show called \"The Men's Room.\" He also did motion capture for the main character's fighting moves. He said that when he arrived at the motion-capture place in New York he asked the people in charge how violent they wanted to have it and they told him to \"give it all he got\". After two hours they stopped him and said, \"It's OK, you don't have to go any further\".\n\nHe was also featured in \"WCW vs. the World\" for the PlayStation, but was named \"Thunder Dome\" to avoid copyright laws.\n\nOn 23 January 2008, he was announced as the new Vice President, Fighter Operations reporting directly to IFL CEO Jay Larkin. His role was to build relations between the IFL and its fighters as well as work on potential match-ups between fighters. He also hosted the weekly shows \"Battleground\" and \"International Fight League\" with Kenny Rice. This all ended when IFL went out of business in late 2008.\n\nIn 2009, he appeared in the music video for Listen to Your Friends by the rock band New Found Glory, \"fighting\" lead vocalist Jordan Pundik.\nBas and Rice hosted \"Inside MMA\", a weekly MMA variety show on AXS TV. The pair also did remote English commentary and play-by-play for Dream events broadcast in North America on HDNet. The pair were eventually replaced by Guy Mezger and Michael Schiavello, who attend the events live in Japan. He is currently appearing in public health service ads, airing on Cartoon Network. He also made a public service announcement against trying out MMA at home but CagePotato ridiculed it for its mixed messages.\n\nRutten featured in 2012 American sports comedy movie Here Comes the Boom alongside Kevin James and Henry Winkler. Rutten played the role of a former MMA fighter and Dutch immigrant Niko trying to gain US citizenship. In return for his help in gaining citizenship Niko helps train 42-year-old biology teacher Scott (Kevin James) to become a MMA fighter in the UFC. The film also features former UFC fighter Krzysztof Soszynski, former Muay Thai kickboxer Mark DellaGrotte along with cameo roles for Bruce Buffer, Chael Sonnen, Jason Miller, Satoshi Ishii, Mark Muñoz, Herb Dean, Wanderlei Silva, and Joe Rogan amongst others.\n\nOn 23 October 2013, The World Series of Fighting announced Rutten as a member of the broadcast team for WSOF events on NBCSN along with Todd Harris.\n\nRutten is certified as an instructor of both MTBN Thai Boxing and mixed martial arts, as well as krav maga.\n\nRutten coached Mark Kerr during the filming of the HBO documentary \"\".\n\nIn 2006, Rutten was a coach a team for the International Fight League, an MMA organization that focused on team combat. His team, the Anacondas, defeated the Silverbacks 3–2. He is also a former investor in the Legends MMA gym in Hollywood and used to teach there occasionally, and is now a part owner of the MMA gym Bas Rutten's Elite Mixed Martial Arts in Thousand Oaks, California. He teaches a MMA class on Tuesdays.\n\nHe has also trained former street fighter Kimbo Slice for his professional MMA bouts, as well as professional wrestler Samoa Joe.\n\nRutten's main reason of success in Pancrase was his well-rounded fighting style, excelling both in striking and grappling. His stand-up offensive, learned from the Dutch school of Muay Thai, Karate and Taekwondo was aggressive yet deceptively technical. According to Frank Shamrock, it often intimidated other fighters. He would say, \"His kickboxing was devastating. It was something everybody feared. The other thing he had was a basic understanding of real fighting ... Bas had that street fighter mentality.\" One of his favored tactics was unbalancing his opponents with push kicks against the ring ropes before overwhelming them with palm strikes and body punches, nullifying their ability to counterattack or defend. Rutten never developed an effective takedown defense, but he was apt at landing strikes while being taken down, having knocked out opponents before they could complete the technique. The most famous aspect of his striking, however, was his scientific skill to target the opponent's liver, using punches, knees and kicks to damage it and incapacitate his adversary.\n\nRutten's groundwork was built through a slow evolution and was unusual for being mostly self-taught. Initially counting only on defense rudiments learned from Chris Dolman, he developed his game by copying Pancrase trainings and became a dangerous submission fighter. His grappling style was patterned after Pancrase's native shoot wrestling (better known as \"Catch wrestling\" in the west), and he focused on chokeholds, leglocks, and a solid submission defense, which helped him to avoid being forced to submit by even high-level offensive grapplers like Masakatsu Funaki and Minoru Suzuki.\n\nRutten currently lives in Westlake Village, California, with his wife Karin and two daughters – Sabine and Bianca. Rutten also has a daughter from his first wife; her name is Rachele. He became a citizen of the United States twenty years ago. By the end of 2015, he received his first grandchild, a grandson from Rachele, who currently lives in Belgium.\n\nBack in the Netherlands, Rutten is friends with former UFC competitor Gerard Gordeau.\n\nRutten is known by the moniker \"El Guapo\", which means \"The Handsome One\" in Spanish.\n\nHe became known for the victory celebration known as \"Rutten Jump\", in which he would do a jumping split after winning a fight. Rutten talked about the origins of the Rutten Jump on his website: \"When I won my first fight in Pancrase, I was so hyped that I jumped up in the splits to each side of the ring. Why? I don't know. But, it became my trademark and I had to do it after every fight that I won.\" \n\nIn 2010, Rutten partnered with clothing brand, Tokyo Five, to produce and star in a cooking show titled \"Grandma's Kitchen with Bas Rutten\". The show's pilot was scheduled to air 26 February 2010, however, due to a physical altercation between Rutten and co-hosts, production has been delayed indefinitely.\n\nRutten is a practicing Catholic, talking about his faith in God on YouTube.\n\nRutten has several tattoos, each of which is intended to help him spiritually and emotionally.\n\nBas Rutten is known for his brawls and bar fights around the world. In particular, he once threw Paul Varelans through a glass window in Kiev via kimura lock when Varelans tried to bite his back, and immediately after he disarmed and assaulted an armed bouncer. He also participated in a brawl that took place at a bar in Sweden in which he fought several bouncers at the same time. This fight is particularly notorious as it landed Rutten in a Swedish jail.\n\nBas Rutten is known to have at least one dog, who responds to the name \"Speedy\". Greg Cote, long time sports columnist of the Miami Herald, refers to Mr. Rutten's dog with its full name: Speedy Rutten.\n\n\n\n"}

He left the band in 2015, leaving vocalist Scooter Ward as the only original member. However, he later rejoined the band full-time in 2019.\n\nIn 1986, McCandless formed the band Grundig along with several other students; Scooter Ward, Jeremy Marshall, and Matt Loughran at Fletcher High School in Neptune Beach, Florida. The band played their first gig in 1990 at a club called the Spray. In 1992, the band released an 8-song EP called \"Into Everything\" and moved to Atlanta, Georgia. Three and a half years later in 1995, Grundig broke up and McCandless, Ward, Kelly Hayes, and Pat Lally formed the band Diablo. Diablo would only last about 3 months. \n\nAt the end of that three-month period, Grundig reformed under the name Cold and signed a 6-album record deal with A&M Records. McCandless would remain with Cold until February 2006 when, after several line-up changes and battles with record labels, the band decided to break up. McCandless and Ward promptly began working on their new project The Witch, which McCandless has since left. The project has been renamed twice, When November Falls and now The Killer and the Star. In early 2009, Cold reformed for a reunion tour. Their album \"Superfiction\" was released on July 19, 2011.\n\nMcCandless was responsible for the design of the band's Spider logo which was influenced by Cold's \"Oddity\" EP cover (photographed by McCandless' wife, Georgia von Eberstein, of their pet spider \"Wednesday\"). The Spider Logo is now tattooed on thousands of Cold fans and is the trademark of the band. \n\nIn 2015, McCandless left Cold in search of other projects. However, he rejoined the band as a full-time member in 2019.\n\nSam McCandless has worked with producer and guitarist Paul Leary of Butthole Surfers fame (as well as the producer of Sublime's third album); Singer-songwriter Formica Iglesia, also of the band Carny.\n\n\n"}

He played in Major League Baseball as a right-handed pitcher from through . Sanford was notable for the meteoric start to his career when, he led the National League with 188 strikeouts as a 28-year-old rookie for the Philadelphia Phillies in 1957. He later became a 20-game-winner and made his only World Series appearance as a member of the San Francisco Giants. He also played for the California Angels and the Kansas City Athletics.\n\nSanford was born in Wellesley Hills, Massachusetts. After playing in the minor leagues for seven seasons, he made his major league debut with the Phillies on September 16, 1956 at the age of 27. Sanford made an immediate impact the following season when, he began the year with a 10-2 win-loss record to earn a spot on the National League team in the 1957 All-Star Game on July 9, 1957. He ended the season with a 19-8 win-loss record and a 3.08 earned run average along with a league-leading 188 strikeouts. His 19 victories were second only to the 21 wins by Warren Spahn. He also had 15 complete games on the season, including three shutouts. For his impressive performance, he was named the National League Rookie of the Year in . \n\nHis next seven years would be extremely solid, but never quite as impressive as his rookie season; or according to some, he never improved much after it. After being traded to the Giants for the season, Sanford went 15-12 with a 3.16 ERA in 222 innings pitched and completed 10 games. That year, he started 31 games and made 36 appearances, 5 out of the bullpen. \n\nSanford led the Giants to the 1962 National League pennant with 24 victories, second only to the 25 victories by Don Drysdale. He won 16 consecutive decisions from mid-June to mid-September and was named Player of the Month in August for his second straight 6-0 month (he also posted a 3.55 ERA, and 31 SO). Only Rube Marquard, who won 19 straight games for the 1912 New York Giants, and Roy Face, who won 17 straight for the 1959 Pittsburgh Pirates have won more consecutive games in a single season during the modern era. Six pitchers have matched Sanford's 16-game streak.\n\nThe Giants would face the New York Yankees in the World Series in the only post-season appearance of Sanford's career. Sanford made three starts for the club in the World Series. In Game 2, he pitched a three-hit shutout as the Giants beat the Yankees 2-0. He was supposed to start Game 5 October 9, but rain pushed it back a day, which bothered Sanford, who had psyched himself to pitch that day. Sanford gave up a three-run home run to Tom Tresh and a total of five runs (four earned) in innings as the Giants lost 5-3. He pitched better in Game 7, allowing just one run in seven innings against the Yankees when Bill Skowron scored as Tony Kubek hit into a double play in the fifth inning. That run was enough, though, for the Yankees to win 1-0, behind a Ralph Terry shutout. (The Giants lost the Series by inches: Yankee second baseman Bobby Richardson caught Willie McCovey's line drive with Willie Mays on second and Matty Alou on third; a foot or two to either side and both runners would have scored and the Giants would have won the Series.) Sanford finished second to Don Drysdale in the voting for the 1962 Cy Young Award. After he left the Giants, his best seasons were behind him. He ended his playing career with the Kansas City Athletics on August 6, at the age of 38.\n\nHowever, Sanford remained in the major leagues for two more seasons as the pitching coach of the – Cleveland Indians. Working on the staff of Alvin Dark, his manager with the 1962 Giants and 1967 Athletics, Sanford's first season saw the 1968 Indians compile a staff earned run average of 2.66. Throughout baseball, 1968 was known as \"The Year of the Pitcher\", and two of Cleveland's starters, Luis Tiant (1.60 in 258 innings pitched) and Sam McDowell (1.81 in 269 innings), finished first and second in ERA in the American League.\n\nIn a twelve-year major league career, Sanford played in 388 games, accumulating a 137-101 win-loss record along with a 3.69 earned run average in 2,049 innings pitched. He accumulated 1,182 strikeouts and gave up only 840 earned runs. He also finished in the Top 10 in MVP Award voting twice in his career (1957, 1962). He finished second in the league in wins twice, losing in 1957 to only Warren Spahn and in 1962 to Cy Young Award winner Don Drysdale.\n\nAfter retiring from baseball, Sanford was a golf director at country clubs. Sanford died of a brain tumor at age 70 in Beckley, West Virginia.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1852174", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1852174", "title": "Sally Ann Howes", "text": "Sally Ann Howes\n\nSally Ann Howes (born 20 July 1930) is an English actress and singer who holds dual British-American citizenship. Her career on stage, screen, and television has spanned over six decades. She is best known for the role of Truly Scrumptious in the 1968 musical film \"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\". She was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Lead Actress in a Musical in 1963 for her performance in \"Brigadoon\".\n\nHowes was born in St John's Wood, London, the daughter of British comedian/actor/singer/variety star Bobby Howes (1895–1972) and actress/singer Patricia Malone (1899–1971). She is the granddaughter of Capt. J.A.E. Malone (died 1928), London theatrical director of musicals, and she had an older brother, Peter Howes, a professional musician and music professor. Her great-grandfather, Joseph Malone, was awarded the Victoria Cross in 1854 at the Charge of the Light Brigade. Her uncle, Pat Malone, was an actor on stage, films, and television.\n\nHowes moved to the family's country house in Essendon, Hertfordshire, for the duration of World War II. She was a show-business baby who lived a quiet, orderly childhood, where she grew up with a nanny and was surrounded by a variety of pets and her parents' theatrical peers, including actor/writer Jack Hulbert and his wife, actress Cicely Courtneidge, who had an adjoining house. Her first taste of the stage was school productions, but as she came from a theatrical family, another family friend, an agent who was visiting the Howes family for dinner, inevitably became impressed with her and not long after suggested the young Sally Ann for a role in a movie. Two hundred young girls had already been screen tested without success, and the producers were desperate to find a talented little girl to play the lead, and they asked her father to please rush in some pictures on the recommendation of the agent. The movie, \"Thursday's Child\", was written by playwright and screenwriter Rodney Ackland, also a close neighbour to the Howes family, and it would become Ackland's directorial debut. \"Thursday's Child\" (1943) launched her career. A second film, \"The Halfway House\" (1944), led to her being put under contract by Michael Balcon of Ealing Studios, and this was followed by many other film roles as a child actress, including \"Dead of Night\" (1945) with Sir Michael Redgrave, \"Pink String and Sealing Wax\" (1945), \"Nicholas Nickleby\" (1947), \"My Sister and I\" (1948) and \"Anna Karenina\" (1948), with Vivien Leigh.\n\nAt the age of 18, the Rank Organisation put her under a seven-year contract, and she went on to make the films \"Stop Press Girl\" (1949), \"The History of Mr. Polly\" (1949) with John Mills, \"Fools Rush In\" (1949), and \"Honeymoon Deferred\" (1951).\n\nOn a teacher friend's recommendation, Howes took singing lessons—not only to bring out her natural talents, but in an effort to lower her speaking voice, which was quite high. While still in her teens, she made her first musical-comedy stage appearance in \"Fancy Free\". In late 1950, she starred in a BBC TV version of \"Cinderella\".\n\nThe same year, Howes accepted her first professional stage role in the Sandy Wilson musical \"Caprice.\" She terminated her contract with Rank, where she had been unhappy with the film roles she'd received, and with being \"lent out\" to other studios. She was finding gainful employment in television and radio, and looking to flex her singing talent, something Balcon and Rank had overlooked. \"Caprice\" was followed by \"Bet Your Life\" with Julie Wilson, Arthur Askey and Brian Reece, with whom Howes was also simultaneously on radio. In 1953, she starred in the West End in the musical \"Paint Your Wagon\" with her father, Bobby Howes, which ran for 18 months. It was followed by \"Summer Song\", also in the West End, firmly establishing Howes as a leading musical comedy star. Then came her critically acclaimed performance in the stage drama \"A Hatful of Rain\". In the early-to-mid-1950s, Howes's career expanded to include television appearances, modelling, commercials, and product endorsements.\n\nShe became a popular celebrity in the UK. She appeared as a comics character in \"TV Fun\" serial comics and annuals, as a young, wholesome teacher in the wild American West (at a time when Western TV shows were very popular). She appeared on many magazine covers, most notably \"Life\" (3 March 1958), when she took over Julie Andrews's role in \"My Fair Lady\" on New York's Broadway.\n\nHowes was offered the part twice before: first, to join the musical's US touring company (which she declined); and second, to replace Andrews on Broadway—which, at the time, conflicted with Howes's commitment to film \"Admirable Crichton\" (1957). \"My Fair Lady\" creators Lerner and Loewe were persistent, though, and Howes accepted the third time—with a year's contract, and at a higher salary than Andrews. Howes was an instant hit as a very fiery Eliza Doolittle.\n\nIn January 1958, Howes married Tony-winning composer Richard Adler (\"The Pajama Game\", \"Damn Yankees\"). The following December, she appeared in Adler's musical television adaptation of O. Henry's short story \"The Gift of the Magi\", which Adler wrote expressly for her\".\" Adler and Bob Merrill also collaborated on a musical version of W. Somerset Maugham's \"Of Human Bondage\" so Howes could play Mildred.\n\nShe appeared on many TV shows, including those of Perry Como and Dinah Shore, and Jack Paar's \"The Tonight Show\" in 1962. She appeared on \"The Bell Telephone Hour\", \"The Kraft Music Hall\", and \"The United States Steel Hour\", and appeared on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" four times.\n\nWhen her contract in \"My Fair Lady\" was over, she returned to Britain to tape six 1-hour installments of \"The Sally Ann Howes Show\", a variety show for the British commercial television network.\n\nHowes was invited to sing for US presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. She became a frequent guest panellist on game shows and was known for her quick, spontaneous answers.\n\nShe returned to Broadway in 1961 in the short run of \"Kwamina\", another musical Adler wrote for her, where she starred opposite Terry Carter. Its theme of interracial romance proved controversial at a time when civil rights were hotly contested, and it has not been revived on Broadway since. Howes's father was also on Broadway that year, in a short revival of \"Finian's Rainbow\".)\n\nIn 1962, she starred in a short revival of the musical \"Brigadoon\" at the New York City Opera and received a Tony nomination, the first performer to be nominated for a revival performance. She recreated the role in a private White House performance at the invitation of President and Mrs. Kennedy. In 1964, she starred on Broadway opposite Robert Alda and Steve Lawrence in the energetic \"What Makes Sammy Run?\", with over 500 performances.\n\nShe returned to familiar territory on TV in 1966 with \"Brigadoon\" opposite Robert Goulet, Peter Falk, and some of her Broadway cast; it won six Emmy Awards.\n\nIn 1967, Howes began the long shooting schedule for what would become a classic children's film, \"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\" (1968). She starred as Truly Scrumptious, the beautiful aristocratic daughter of a confectionery magnate.\n\n\"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\" did not, however, restart her film career or launch a career for her in episodic television despite several guest-starring roles in \"\", \"Marcus Welby, M.D.\", \"Branigan\", and \"The Men From Shiloh\". Even the pilot \"Prudence and the Chief\", which was a spoof on \"The King and I\", did not get picked up as a TV series. In addition, musicals were now failing at the box office and that avenue was closed to her. As a result, she returned almost exclusively to the musical stage, appearing in only a few more films and TV productions.\n\nIn the 1970s, she toured Britain with \"The King and I\" and later the USA with \"The Sound of Music\". After her debut with the Los Angeles Civic Light Opera in 1972 with \"The Sound of Music\", she returned to Britain to star in the stage drama, \"Lover,\" which was written specifically for her.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, she began to cross over from standard musicals to operettas. She performed two summers with the Kenley Players in \"Blossom Time\" and \"The Great Waltz\", and she later added Franz Lehár's \"The Merry Widow\" and then two seasons of Stephen Sondheim's \"A Little Night Music\" at the New York City Opera. She also added the role of Gertrude in \"Hamlet\" to her repertoire.\n\nIn the 1980s, she twice appeared in BBC TV's long-running Edwardian Music Hall programme, \"The Good Old Days\", to great acclaim.\n\nIn 1990, she debuted her one-woman show, \"From This Moment On\", at the Edinburgh Festival and at a benefit for the Long Island AIDS Association at the John Drew Theatre in East Hampton, New York.

He was directly commissioned as an Ensign into the United States Navy and subsequently received his Naval Aviator wings in July 1975.\n\nGodwin's initial tours include numerous fleet assignments with VA-147, VA-122, Air Wing 9, VFA-125, and VFA-25. During those tours, he flew the A-7 Corsair II and the F/A-18 Hornet. From March 1991 until June 1992, he served as a Commanding Officer of Strike Fighter Squadron 192 (VFA-192) while embarked on the USS Midway (CV-41) and the USS Independence (CV-62). As a combat veteran during his command tour, Godwin amassed 34 Desert Storm missions.\n\nAfter detaching from VFA-192, he reported to the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) where he began his career in Navy acquisition. This career path, as the Lead Systems Engineer, Deputy Program Manager and ultimately the F/A-18 Program Manager, led to the position of Program Executive Officer for Tactical Aircraft (PEO(T)), which included the procurement of all tactical aircraft and weapons systems on the Navy's aircraft carriers. In addition, Godwin co-led the NAVAIR Warfighter Focus Group, which was tasked with balancing near-term and future readiness of the aviation fleet.\n\nGodwin managed a network of aviation technology experts and program managers, tasked with delivering tactical aircraft and weapon systems to the fleet. These programs included delivering the cornerstone of Naval Aviation, F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, as well as the early operational fielding of the Advanced Targeting Forward Looking Infrared (ATFLIR), Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS), the Shared Reconnaissance Pod (SHARP), Improved Capability III Airborne Electronic Attack (ICAP III) system, and latest version of the AIM-9 Sidewinder missile, the AIM-9X. Systems under development included the Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar for the Super Hornet, an Electronically Scanned Radar for the E-2 Advanced Hawkeye, and the U.S Navy's replacement for the EA-6B Prowler, the EA-18G Growler aircraft.\n\nGodwin assumed command as the Director of the Navy Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI) in September 2004. In May 2005 under a reorganization, he was named Direct Reporting Program Manager (DRPM) for NMCI, and under another reorganization in February he became the Program Executive Officer Enterprise Information Systems. He was a direct report to the Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development and Acquisition and was responsible for delivering an enterprise-wide computer network for Navy and Marine Corps, one of the most transformational contracting initiatives ever undertaken by the Department of the Navy.

{"id": "1852177", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1852177", "title": "Francis the Talking Mule", "text": "Francis the Talking Mule\n\nFrancis the Talking Mule was a mule character who became a celebrity during the 1950s as the star of seven popular Universal-International film comedies. The character originated in the 1946 novel \"Francis\" by former U.S. Army Captain David Stern III (1909–2003), son of newspaper publisher J. David Stern. After another studio turned down the property, Universal bought the rights for a film series, with Stern adapting his own script for the first entry, simply titled \"Francis\". \n\nFrom the \"Francis\" book jacket: \n\nStern wrote several short stories for \"Esquire\" under the name of Peter Stern about an Army 2nd lieutenant fighting the Japanese in the jungles of Burma. Following the war, he connected the stories \"I Meet Francis\", \"Francis and the Golden\", and \"Francis Unmasked\" into the 1946 novel \"Francis\".\n\nIn 1948, Stern published the sequel \"Francis Goes to Washington\", with the former lieutenant (now named Peter Sterling) running for Congress with the help of Francis. Stern gave up fiction writing to become editor of the \"New Orleans Item\", a newspaper that he purchased in 1949 and ran until 1958.\n\nMickey Rooney was originally considered for a United Artists \"Francis\" feature film before Universal-International acquired the rights. Rooney took the lead after Donald O'Connor left for the final film in the series \"Francis in the Haunted House\".\n\nThe book and film series focused on the exploits of Francis, an experienced Army mule, and Peter Stirling (played by Donald O'Connor), the young soldier whom he befriends (and stays with through civilian life and then back into the military). In the original 1950 film the mule identifies himself to the commanding general as \"Francis...123rd Mule Detachment...[serial number] M52519\". With a plot device like the later series \"Mister Ed\", Francis would usually only talk to Peter, thus causing problems for his nominal \"master\". The first six films were directed by Universal comedy veteran Arthur Lubin, previously known for helming Abbott and Costello vehicles, who would go on to produce and direct \"Mister Ed\" for television.\n\nAs the titles indicated, each film had a different setting or gimmick, exposing the world-wise mule and the naive GI to race track excitement, the world of journalism, and many branches of the military, from West Point to the WACs to the Navy. The basic plots were fairly similar, however. Stirling, with the sage but sardonic advice of Francis (gleaned from overhearing generals plan strategy or from discussions with other equines), would triumph over his own incompetence. However, inevitably, he would be forced to reveal that his adviser was a mule, and be subject to mental analysis (sometimes more than once per film) until the grand reveal, when Francis displayed his talent (usually either to individuals, or to a large group). The astonishing existence of a talking mule, however, was conveniently forgotten by the next film.\n\n\n\"Francis Goes to Washington\", based on the 1948 novel by Stern, was meant to be the first \"Francis\" sequel, but filming was postponed as there were \"too many complications\" for it \"to be made as things stand at the present\".\n\nThe distinctive voice of Francis was provided by veteran character actor Chill Wills, who lent his deep, rough vocal texture and Western twang to the cynical and sardonic mule. As was customary at the time, Wills never received billing for his vocal work, though he was featured prominently on-screen as blustery General Ben Kaye in the fourth film \"Francis Joins the WACS\". \nThe mule who appeared on-screen was a female named Molly, selected because she was easy to handle. She was purchased from Jake and Jenny Frazier in Drexel, Missouri. According to author Pauline Bartel, Universal paid $350 for the animal but made millions from the film series. Molly was trained by Les Hilton, an apprentice of Will Rogers; Hilton went on to train Bamboo Harvester, the horse that played Mister Ed. To create the impression that the mule was actually talking, Hilton used a thread fed into the animal's mouth which would cause Molly to try to remove it by moving her lips, the same technique used for Mister Ed.\n\nThe final film in the series, \"Francis in the Haunted House\", was made without any of the key creative personnel. \"Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide\" states that O'Connor quit, and Mickey Rooney replaced him as a new character. Director Lubin and Chill Wills were also absent, replaced by Charles Lamont and voice actor Paul Frees, who did a close approximation of Wills' voice.\n\nSome of the Francis films had animated trailers.\n\nFrancis also made a brief cameo, in animated form and voiced by Marvin Miller, in the UPA cartoon short \"How Now Boing Boing\" (1954), starring Gerald McBoing Boing. David Stern and Frank Thomas scripted a 1952-53 syndicated comic strip, \"Francis, the Famous Talking Mule\", illustrated by Cliff Rogerson, who also drew the gag panel, \"Tee Vee Laffs\" (1957–85). 17 issues of \"Francis the Famous Talking Mule\" were published as part of Dell`s \"Four Color Comics\" series from 1951–60, illustrated by, alternately, David Gantz and Don Gunn. Francis is said to have provided the inspiration for the title of rock band The Mars Volta's second album, \"Frances the Mute\". Many years later, offbeat director John Waters joked about making a film starring Francis and Divine.\n\nThe original film, \"Francis\" (1950), was released in 1978 as one of the first-ever titles in the new LaserDisc format, DiscoVision Catalog #22-003. It was later re-issued in May 1994 on LaserDisc by MCA/Universal Home Video (Catalog #: 42024) as part of an Encore Edition Double Feature with \"Francis Goes to the Races\" (1951).\n\nThe first two Francis films were released again in 2004 by Universal Pictures on Region 1 and Region 4 DVD, along with the next two in the series, as \"The Adventures of Francis the Talking Mule Vol. 1\". Several years later, Universal released all 7 Francis films as a set on three Region 1 and Region 4 DVDs, \"Francis The Talking Mule: The Complete Collection.\"\n\n"}

The second film in National Lampoon's \"Vacation\" film series, it stars Chevy Chase, Beverly D'Angelo, Dana Hill, Jason Lively, Victor Lanoux, and Eric Idle.\n\nThe film is the only installment in the series in which the family’s name is spelled \"Griswald\", instead of \"Griswold\".\n\nThe Griswald family competes in a game show called \"Pig in a Poke\" and wins an all-expenses-paid trip to Europe. In a whirlwind tour of western Europe, chaos of all sorts ensues.\n\nThey stay in a fleabag London hotel with a sloppy, tattooed Cockney desk clerk. While in their English rental car, a yellow Austin Maxi, Clark's tendency to drive on the wrong side of the road causes frequent accidents, including knocking over a bicyclist, who reappears throughout the film. Later, Clark drives the family around the busy Lambeth Bridge roundabout for hours, unable to maneuver his way out of the chaotic traffic. At Stonehenge, Clark accidentally backs the car into an ancient stone monolith, toppling all the stones like dominoes, which they do not even notice as they happily leave the scene.\n\nIn Paris, the family wears stenciled berets, causing Rusty to be teased by young women at the Eiffel Tower observation deck. Clark offers to get rid of the beret for Rusty, but when he throws it away, another visitor's dachshund mistakes it for a Frisbee and jumps off the tower after it, landing safely in a nearby pond. The family's video camera is stolen by a passerby whom Clark had asked to take a picture of the family. Clark is also mocked by a French waiter for his terrible French. Later, Clark and Ellen visit a bawdy Paris can-can dance show, finding Rusty already there with a prostitute.\n\nNext, in a West German village, the Griswalds burst in on a bewildered elderly couple, whom they mistakenly think are relatives but the couple ends up providing them dinner and lodging anyway, both not being able to understand the others' language. Clark turns a lively Bavarian folk dance stage performance into an all-out street brawl, after which, while fleeing, he hastily knocks down several street vendors' stands and gets their Citroën DS stuck in a narrow medieval archway.\n\nIn Rome, the Griswalds rent a car at a travel office, but unknown to them, the men in charge are thieves, holding the real manager captive. The lead thief gives them a car with the manager in the trunk, claiming he lost the trunk keys. The next day Ellen is shocked to discover that private, sexy videos of her from the family's stolen video camera have been used in a billboard advertising porn, leaving her completely humiliated. After screaming angrily at Clark (who had told her he had erased the video), Ellen storms off to their hotel, where she encounters the thief who rented them the car. She confesses her recent troubles, still unaware that he is a criminal. The man then tries to get the car keys, which are in her purse, but fails. When the police arrive at the hotel, he kidnaps Ellen, prompting Clark to rescue her.\n\nOn the flight home, Clark accidentally causes the plane to knock the Statue of Liberty's torch upside down.\n\n\nCharacters in America:\n\nCharacters in England:\n\nCharacters in France:\n\nCharacters in Germany:\n\nCharacters in Italy:\nProducer Matty Simmons initially told Dana Barron she would be returning to the role of Audrey but after Hall declined to reprise his role, opting to star in \"Weird Science\", Heckerling requested both children be recast.\n\nFamous landmarks and sights appearing as the family tours England, France, West Germany, and Italy include:\n\nOther locations used in the film include:\n\nScenes supposedly taking place in West Germany were actually shot in a German-speaking part of Italy (Brixen).\n\nThe musical score for \"National Lampoon's European Vacation\" was composed by Charles Fox, who replaced Ralph Burns of the first film. Lindsey Buckingham's \"Holiday Road\" was once again featured as the film's theme song, with many other contemporary songs included throughout the film.\n\n\nThe film opened July 26, 1985 in 1,546 North American theaters and grossed $12,329,627 its opening weekend, ranking number one at the box office. After its initial run, the film grossed a total of $49,364,621 domestically.\n\nReview aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 36% based on reviews from 25 critics, with an average of 4.7 out of 10. The critical consensus reads; \"\"European Vacation\" charts a course through a succession of pretty destinations, but the journey itself lacks the laughs that made the original outing so memorable.\"\n\nJanet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" thought positively of the film stating, \"While it's very much a retread, it succeeds in following up the first film's humor with more in a similar vein.\" She added, \"The film's best visual humor arises from the mere juxtaposition of European settings with the funny hats, T-shirts and soda cans with which the Griswalds announce their presence.\" Entertainment magazine \"Variety\" gave the film a negative review explaining, \"As the family of characters cartwheel through London, Paris, Italy and Germany - with the French deliciously taking it on the chin for their arrogance and rudeness - director Amy Heckerling gets carried away with physical humor while letting her American tourists grow tiresome and predictable. Structurally, the film unfolds like a series of travel brochures.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "1852192", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1852192", "title": "Villeray, Montreal", "text": "Villeray, Montreal\n\nVilleray is a neighbourhood in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is part of the Villeray–Saint-Michel–Parc-Extension borough and is situated in the north-central part of the Island of Montreal.\n\nThe village of Villeray took its name from Louis Rouer de Villeray (1628–1700), who held various positions in the French regime. It became a town in 1896, before which the area had been farmland. When it was annexed to Montreal in 1905, its population was 800. At the time, Villeray was surrounded by quarries that provided material for the construction of many of the buildings in the area, as well as for several of the city's major landmarks. For some years, its inhabitants were chiefly stone workers, farmers and owners of small businesses.\n\nThe territory of Villeray was well provided with streams and ponds and very amenable to cultivation. The original Jarry Farm covered 64 arpents (approximately 22 hectares, or 54 acres) and stretched as far north as the present-day Metropolitan (highway 40), south to Villeray St., east to St-Hubert and west to Foucher. The owner, one Stanislas Jarry, broke the land up into 680 lots at the beginning of the 20th century. Other members of his family owned land in what would eventually be called Villeray–Saint-Michel–Parc-Extension.\n\nPresently the district of Villeray is enclosed between Avenue Casgrain in the west, Boulevard Jean-Talon in the south, Rue Garnier in the east and the Metropolitan (highway 40) to the north. These borders were determined in the creation of the borough of Villeray–Saint-Michel–Parc-Extension, which was created on January 1, 2002, following the municipal reorganization of Montreal.\n\nOriginally Villeray's houses were wooden ones, typically owned by workers, with sheds and stables in back. From 1915 to 1930, Villeray saw a boom which brought with it the need for schools, churches, a public bath and a fire station, built at the corner of Jarry and St-Hubert in 1912.\n\nThe imposing Montreal Institute for the Deaf, with a façade made of Montreal stone, was built near Faillon and de Castelnau during World War I by the Clercs de Saint-Viateur.\n\nAfter World War II the typical Montreal duplex and triplex became the standard domestic architecture in Villeray, and the town filled up with rows of these buildings, whose spiral front staircases, back alleys, clotheslines and sheds are well-known features of residential Montreal.\n\nRaoul Jarry, Montreal city councillor from 1921 and member of its executive committee from 1924, saw in Jarry Park a means of offering some open green space to fight the diseases that spread among children in summertime and to encourage them to participate in sports and families to picnic and relax together. It was due to his efforts that the city purchased this land, which had up till then been leased from the corporation of its original owner, Stanley Clark Bagg (memorialized by Bagg Street further south in Plateau Mont-Royal). Raoul Jarry died in 1930 and the park is named after him (whereas Jarry Street is named after Bernard Bleignier dit Jarry, an 18th-century landlord who Jarry was descended). Brother Henri (1893-1961) would become alderman for Villeray from 1934 to 1938.\n\nThe 21st century is seeing more and more people moving into Villeray. Attracting them to the area is its somewhat central location on the Island of Montreal, its access to Metro stations, its proximity to Jean Talon Market and Little Italy, and it is relatively close to shopping areas like Rockland Center and Marché Central. Along with the revitalization of Jarry Park, the area is increasingly more popular compared to the 1990s. This in turn, along with the new Université de Montréal campus in the neighbouring Park Extension, has caused gentrification issues to affect the area gradually and steadily since around 2010.\n\n\n"}

Caselotti was the voice of the title character of the first Walt Disney animated feature \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\", for which she was named as a Disney Legend in 1994, making her the first female voice actor so named.\n\nAdriana Caselotti was born in Bridgeport, Connecticut to an Italian American family. Her father, Guido Caselotti, was an immigrant from Udine, and worked as a teacher of music and a vocal coach. Her mother, Maria Orefice (1893-1961), from Naples, was a singer in the Royal Opera Theatre of Rome. Her older sister, Louise, sang opera and gave voice lessons (for example, to Maria Callas, from 1946 to 1947). When Caselotti was seven years old, her family left Connecticut for Italy while her mother toured with an opera company. Caselotti was educated at an Italian convent, San Getulio, near Rome, while her mother performed in the opera. When her family returned to New York three years later, Caselotti relearned English and studied singing with her father.\n\nIn 1935, after a brief stint as a chorus girl and session singer at MGM, Walt Disney hired Caselotti as the voice of his heroine Snow White. She was paid a total of $970 for working on the film (). She was not credited and had trouble finding new opportunities later in life. Jack Benny specifically mentioned that he had asked Disney for permission to use her on his radio show and was told, \"I'm sorry, but that voice can't be used anywhere. I don't want to spoil the illusion of Snow White.\" Caselotti had two more jobs in the film business. The first was an uncredited role in MGM's \"The Wizard of Oz\" (1939); she provided the voice of Juliet during the Tin Man's song, \"If I Only Had a Heart\", speaking the line, \"Wherefore art thou Romeo?\". In 1946, she had an uncredited role in Frank Capra's \"It's a Wonderful Life\", singing in Martini's bar as James Stewart was praying.\n\nAdriana Caselotti appeared in several promotional spots for \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\", signing memorabilia. On November 22, 1972 (Thanksgiving Day), she guest-starred on an episode of \"The Julie Andrews Hour\" saluting the music of Walt Disney, singing \"I'm Wishing\" and \"Someday My Prince Will Come\" with Julie Andrews. She also made a guest appearance on the syndicated \"The Mike Douglas Show\". Caselotti later wrote a how-to book, \"Do You Like to Sing?\".\n\nLater in life, she sold autographs and also made an attempt at an opera career (for example, \"Rigoletto\"). In the early 1990s, when the Snow White Grotto at Disneyland was refurbished, Caselotti re-recorded \"I'm Wishing\" for the Snow White Wishing Well at the age of 75. In 1994, she was named a Disney Legend.\n\nCaselotti was married four times. Her first husband was Robert Chard, a local theater ticket broker whom she married in 1945. The marriage ended in divorce. She later met bit actor Norval Mitchell, whom she married in 1952. He retired after marrying her, and died in 1972. The same year, she was married to a podiatrist, Dr. Joseph Dana Costigan, who died in 1982. Caselotti married her last husband, Florian St. Pierre, a retired postal employee, in 1989 and later divorced. On January 18, 1997, Caselotti died of respiratory failure from lung cancer at her Los Angeles home. She was cremated and her ashes were scattered at Newport Beach, California. At the time of her death, she was the last surviving cast member of the 1937 animated film, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.\n\n"}

In early 1942, he was put in charge of United States Army Forces in Australia, until the arrival of Douglas MacArthur. Brett then commanded all Allied Air Forces in the Southwest Pacific Area. In November 1942, he was appointed commander of the US Caribbean Defense Command and remained in this post for the rest of the war.\n\nGeorge Howard Brett was born in Cleveland, Ohio on 7 February 1886, the second of five children of William Howard Brett, a notable librarian, and his wife Alice née Allen. George's older brother Morgan graduated with the United States Military Academy at West Point class of 1906, and served for many years as an ordnance officer, retiring in 1932 as a colonel. The family was unable to secure a second West Point appointment, so George Brett graduated from the Virginia Military Institute in 1909 and was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the Philippine Scouts on 22 March 1910. While in the Philippines he transferred to the US Cavalry on 10 August 1911, joining the 2nd Cavalry.\n\nBrett returned to the United States in May 1912 and was first stationed at Fort Bliss.

Brett married Mary Devol in Denver on 1 March 1916. Influenced by Allen and Andrews, Brett transferred to the Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps on 2 September 1916. He attended aviation school and on graduation in 1916 was assigned to the office of the Chief Signal Officer in Washington, D.C. where he was promoted to first lieutenant on 1 July 1916 and captain on 15 May 1917.\n\nBrett departed for the Western Front in November 1917 but suffered a case of appendicitis, resulting in the loss of his flight status. After making a partial recovery, he served in France as senior materiel officer under Brigadier General Billy Mitchell, attaining the temporary rank of major on 7 June 1918. After briefly returned to the United States to serve in Office of the Director of Military Aeronautics in Washington, D.C. from 1 August to 23 September 1918, Brett went to England to command the United States Army Air Service Camp at Codford.\n\nBrett was posted to Kelly Field, Texas, in December 1918, where he commanded the Aviation General Supply Depot until February 1919, when he became the maintenance and supply officer at the Air Service Flying School. He commanded the Air Service depot in Morrison, Virginia for a month in October 1919 before being\nassigned to the office of the Director of the Air Service in Washington, DC, where his rank of major became permanent in 1920. That year he took command of Crissy Field. His first son, the future United States Air Force Lieutenant General Devol \"Rock\" Brett, was born at nearby Letterman Army Hospital at the Presidio of San Francisco in 1923.\n\nFrom 1924 to 1927 Brett was stationed at the intermediate depot at Fairfield, Ohio, where he was the officer\nin charge of the field service section. Starting in June 1927 he attended the Air Corps Tactical School at Langley Field, Virginia, after which he was selected for the two-year Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. He commanded Selfridge Field, Michigan for time before returned to Fort Leavenworth as an Air Corps instructor from 1933 to 1935. After 16 years as a major, he was finally promoted to lieutenant colonel and was selected to attend the Army War College. On graduation, he became commander of the 19th Wing, then stationed in the Panama Canal Zone, with the temporary rank of brigadier general. While he was stationed there, his eldest daughter Dora married his aide, the future general, Bernard A. Schriever.\n\nOn his return from Panama, Brett reverted to his permanent rank of lieutenant colonel. He was briefly stationed in Menlo Park, California, before moving to Langley, Virginia, where he became chief of staff to his old friend Frank Andrews, now the commander of GHQ Air Force. In February 1939 Brett moved to Wright Field as assistant to the chief of the United States Army Air Corps, also serving as commandant of the Air Corps Engineering School and the chief of the Materiel Division. Once again he held the rank of brigadier general before being promoted to major general on 1 October 1940.\n\nWhen his immediate superior, Major General Henry H. \"Hap\" Arnold, was temporarily transferred to the Army General Staff in November 1939, Brett acted as Chief of the Air Corps. In May 1941, he formally became Chief of the Air Corps for a four-year term, but the June 1941 reorganisation that made Arnold the Chief of United States Army Air Forces made the post of Chief of the Air Corps somewhat redundant. Brett was sent to the United Kingdom to determine how the Army Air Forces could better support Royal Air Force Lend-Lease requirements. His recommendation that American labor and facilities be established in the United Kingdom to handle the repair, assembly, and equipping of American aircraft created a stir on both sides of the Atlantic, and was ultimately disapproved by Arnold on the grounds that the personnel and equipment were not available. Brett next paid a visit to the Middle East where his outspoken criticism of arrangements there antagonised his hosts to the extent that the British Ambassador to Egypt, Sir Miles Lampson, complained about him to the Foreign Secretary, Sir Anthony Eden. Air Marshal Sir Arthur Tedder noted that \"the charms of General Brett’s company were beginning to pall. After a talk with him on the afternoon of 25 September I wondered in my journal how he and all the American visitors\ncould lay down the law about things of which they knew next to nothing.\" As a result, Brett was ordered to return to the United States in December.\n\nThe outbreak of war between the United States and Japan in December 1941 changed things and Brett received new orders. He first flew to Rangoon and then, in the company of the Sir Archibald Wavell, the British Commander-in-Chief, India, on to Chungking where the two met with Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. They obtained a promise of Chinese troops to assist in the defence of Burma. Near Rangoon, Wavell's and Brett’s aircraft was attacked by Japanese aircraft and they were forced to make an emergency landing at a friendly aerodrome in Burma. The area was then bombed by the Japanese, but neither general was harmed. Brett was appointed Deputy Supreme Commander of the American-British-Dutch-Australian Command (ABDA), under Wavell, on 1 January 1942, and was promoted to lieutenant general on 7 January 1942. He arrived in Darwin on 28 December 1941. In January he moved to Lembang in West Java, where Wavell established his headquarters. The rapid advance of Japanese forces through South East Asia had soon split the Allied-controlled area in two. Brett departed Java for Australia on 23 February 1942, reaching Melbourne the next day, where he resumed command of US Army Forces in Australia. ABDA was formally dissolved on 25 February.\n\nAlready, General Douglas MacArthur had also been ordered to Australia. Brett received warning from the Chief of Staff, General George Marshall that MacArthur would call on him to send a flight of long-range bombers to Mindanao. The only aircraft that Brett could find were B-17s of the 19th Bombardment Group which had seen hard service in the Philippines and the Dutch East Indies campaigns. Brett approached Vice Admiral Herbert F. Leary, the commander of naval forces in the Anzac Area, to ask for a loan of some of twelve newly arrived navy B-17s. Leary refused. Brett therefore sent four of the 19th Bombardment Group's old planes. Only one, a B-17 with no brakes piloted by Lieutenant Harl Pease, made it to Mindanao; two turned back with engine trouble, while a fourth ditched in the sea, its crew managing to escape. MacArthur was incensed and sent a message to Marshall. A message from Washington, D.C. persuaded Leary to release four new B-17s to Brett and these aircraft reached Mindanao on 16 March 1942 and managed to bring MacArthur and his party to Australia. Despite the lack of brakes, Pease also made it back, carrying sixteen refugees.\n\nIt fell to Brett to telephone Prime Minister John Curtin and inform him of MacArthur's arrival. Although Curtin was unaware of MacArthur's impending arrival, and had expected that Brett would command American forces in Australia, he was persuaded to issue a recommendation that MacArthur be made Supreme Commander South West Pacific Area. While Brett considered that he was on \"very friendly terms\" with Curtin, Brett felt that Curtin was \"more interested in keeping the party line on wages, hours and working conditions than in the threat posed by the Japanese.\" General George Kenney later recalled that \n\nThe April 1942 reorganisation that established the Southwest Pacific Area reduced the United States Army Forces in Australia to a supply and administrative organisation that would soon be renamed the Services of Supply. Brett instead became commander of Allied Air Forces, Southwest Pacific Area, with his headquarters in Melbourne. One of MacArthur's first orders to Brett was for a bombing mission to the Philippines, an order which was delivered personally by MacArthur's chief of staff, Major General Richard K. Sutherland. Brett protested that his planes were worn out, his men were tired, losses might be high, and the Philippines were lost anyway. Sutherland told him the MacArthur wanted the mission carried out. Brett delegated it to Brigadier General Ralph Royce, who led the mission in person. Brett awarded Royce the Distinguished Service Cross. Henceforth, communications with Sutherland would be handled by Brett's chief of staff, Air Vice Marshal William Bostock. MacArthur personally wrote a reprimand to Brett. Further disagreements between MacArthur and Brett followed. On 6 July 1942 Marshall radioed MacArthur to offer him Major General George Kenney or Brigadier General Jimmy Doolittle as a replacement for Brett. MacArthur selected Kenney. Brett returned to the United States in his B-17, \"The Swoose\", on 4 August 1942. The day before, General MacArthur awarded him the Silver Star \"for gallantry in action in air reconnaissance in the combat zone, Southwest Pacific Area, during the months of May, June and July 1942.\"\n\nAfter a time with no command, Brett was appointed commander of the US Caribbean Defense Command and the US Army's Panama Canal Department in succession to Lieutenant General Frank M. Andrews in November 1942. In 1945, the Inspector General, Lieutenant General Daniel Isom Sultan, investigated a series of allegations against Brett regarding the misuse of Army funds and property. He reported to General Marshall that most of the charges were distortions of mission-related events and expenditures, that the remaining allegations had no basis in fact, and that no further action be taken. Brett requested voluntary retirement and retired on 30 April 1945 with the rank of major general, only to be immediately recalled to active duty the next day as a temporary lieutenant general and as Commanding General of the Caribbean Defense Command and Panama Canal Department. On 10 October 1945, Brett handed over command to Lieutenant General Willis D. Crittenberger. For his service in Panama, Brett was awarded a second Distinguished Service Medal. The citation noted \"his broad grasp of military strategy and superior knowledge of air and ground tactics\" and that \"he succeeded admirably in impressing the republics of Central and South America with the importance and necessity of hemispheric solidarity, imbued them with American ideals, coordinated their use of arms and equipment and indoctrinated them with American training methods – all of which fostered continued improvement in the relations between all America republics.\" After spending time as a patient in Brooke General Hospital, he reverted to retired status on 10 May 1946 but was later advanced to the grade of lieutenant general on the United States Air Force retired list by an Act of Congress on 29 June 1948.\n\nThe B-17D, \"The Swoose\", which Brett used extensively for his personal transport during World War II, and which he often piloted, is today the oldest, intact, surviving B-17 Flying Fortress and the only \"D\" model still in existence. It was transferred from the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum to the National Museum of the United States Air Force on 15 July 2008.\n\nBrett served on several committees and Air Force boards, including Flying Pay Board, the Air\nForce Association Board, and the President's Service Academy Board between 1949 and 1950. When his son Rock Brett was deployed in the Korean War, George Brett took in his daughter-in-law and grandchildren and cared for them. Brett lived in Winter Park, Florida until his death at age 77. He died of cancer on 2 December 1963 at the hospital at Orlando Air Force Base. Survived by his wife, children, and grandchildren, he was buried in Winter Park, Florida.\n<nowiki> </nowiki>\n\n\n"}

Donohue was first elected Lieutenant Governor in 1998, and was re-elected in 2002.\n\nDonohue is a former teacher and lawyer who was once an aide to State Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno. She graduated from The College of New Rochelle and received a Master's Degree in Education from Russell Sage College. In 1983, she received a law degree from Albany Law School.\n\nIn addition to working for Bruno, Donohue served as an Assistant County Attorney in Rensselaer County. During her time in the county attorney's office, she worked on Family Court and juvenile justice issues.\n\nDonohue served as the district attorney of Rensselaer County for several years in the 1990s. During her two terms as district attorney, she prosecuted over 5,000 cases a year. She handled several cases herself. In 1996, she was elected as a Justice of the New York State Supreme Court. Serving as a state judge, Donohue handled both civil and criminal cases. She resigned from her judgeship in 1998, when Pataki picked her as a running mate.\n\nDonohue was selected as the running mate to Gov. George Pataki in his 1998 re-election bid. After she and Gov. Pataki won their 1998 election, Donohue was sworn in as Lieutenant Governor of New York on January 1, 1999, replacing Betsy McCaughey Ross. Donohue was not known to be a powerful Lieutenant Governor, or to enjoy a close relationship with Gov. Pataki. \n\nWhen Donohue became Lieutenant Governor, Gov. Pataki appointed her to head a special task force on school violence issues. Gov. Pataki said that he designated Donohue to head the task force because of her background as a teacher and district attorney. According to her state website, Donohue spent a year traveling the state meeting with teachers, parents, students, and law enforcement to discuss school violence issues. As a part of her work, Donohue formulated a series of recommendations, signed into law by Pataki in 2000.\n\nSince 1999, Donohue started to spend time traveling the state promoting school violence prevention and to implement the recommendations of her task force. In 2005, Donohue led a state program, comprising several agencies, to determine best practices in the area of school violence prevention. Part of the recommendations made by Donohue's task force included giving teacher authority to have disruptive students removed from classrooms, creating character education curricula in school districts, and making violence against a teacher in a classroom a felony.\n\nIn 2000, Pataki appointed Donohue to chair a task force on quality communities in New York. Donohue's task force met around the state to discuss land use policies, economic development, and growth issues. The panel issued 41 recommendations on preserving community character statewide. After the conclusion of the task force, Donohue served as Chairwoman of the Quality Communities Working Group, which oversaw implementation of the task force's recommendations and the awarding of quality communities grants to towns statewide.\n\nAccording to the website for the Quality Communities Clearinghouse, Donohue's panel made recommendations in the areas of neighborhood preservation, open space conservation, farmland preservation, economic development, land use planning, transportation, and technology. Donohue has traveled the state hosting roundtable discussion on quality communities issues since 2000. In that role, she worked with Secretaries of State Alexander Treadwell, Randy Daniels, and Christopher Jacobs on local government issues.\n\nIn 2001, Donohue chaired a task force on small business issues in the state. In that role, she met with small business owners and developed policy recommendations for governor on these issues. During her second term, Donohue frequently traveled the state promoting homeland security issues, drunk driving prevention, and criminal justice.\n\nIn 2005, Donohue was named by Pataki as the Chairwoman of the New York State Delegation to the White House Conference on Aging. Before the conference, Donohue held a series of community meetings around the state on aging issues.\n\nIn 1997, Pataki announced that he was dropping Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross from his 1998 reelection ticket. Pataki and McCaughey Ross had feuded for much of his term. McCaughey Ross would later become a Democrat and run unsuccessfully for governor in 1998.\n\nFollowing Pataki's announcement regarding McCaughey Ross, Donohue was reported as a possible replacement running mate. In addition, State Parks Commissioner Bernadette Castro, State Senator Mary Lou Rath and Erie County Comptroller Nancy Naples were reported as possible running mates. In the spring of 1998, Pataki announced his selection of Donohue.\n\nIn the 1998 general election, the Pataki-Donohue ticket defeated the Democratic ticket of New York City Council Speaker Peter Vallone for governor and Brighton Town Supervisor Sandra Frankel for lieutenant governor.\n\nIn 2002, there were reports that Donohue was being pushed out by Pataki as his running mate. The reports said that either Secretary of State Randy Daniels or Erie County Executive Joel Giambra would replace her on the Pataki ticket. Donohue beat back the challenge. There were reports that she was offered the Republican nomination for state attorney general to challenge Eliot Spitzer in 2002 so that she would not seek re-election. She declined the nomination, which went to Judge Dora Irizarry instead.\n\nIn September 2002 Donohue and Pataki fought to win the nomination of the New York State Independence Party. Donohue won her primary, but Pataki lost to Rochester businessman Tom Golisano. This made Donohue both the running mate of Pataki and Golisano in the November election and made her the officeholder who won the most votes in New York State in 2002.\n\nThe Pataki/Donohue ticket defeated the Democratic ticket of State Comptroller Carl McCall for governor and businessman Dennis Mehiel for lieutenant governor.\n\nAfter Pataki announced in 2005 that he would not seek reelection, Donohue was seen as a possible candidate for governor. However, she later announced that she would not run for office in 2006 either.\n\nOn March 3, 2006, Donohue informed reporters that her name had been submitted by Pataki to President George W. Bush for nomination to a United States District Court judgeship in Upstate New York. On June 27, 2006, the White House announced that Donohue has been nominated to the judgeship. Her nomination went to the US Senate for confirmation, where it was not brought up by the Senate Judiciary Committee before the 109th Congress adjourned on December 10, 2006. Senator Charles Schumer indicated that he did not see Donohue's nomination being able to be confirmed by the Senate in the 110th Congress, when the Democrats have the Senate majority.\n\nOn December 13, 2006, Pataki nominated her to a seat as a Judge of the New York Court of Claims. She was confirmed that day by the State Senate for term expiring in March 2015. Court of Claims Judges preside over lawsuits against the State of New York and various independent state agencies. She took office as a judge after her term as lieutenant governor expired at midnight on December 31, 2006. She retired from the Court of Claims in May, 2009.\n\n1998 NYS Republican and Conservative Party Tickets\n\n2002 NYS Republican and Conservative Party Tickets\n\n2002 NYS Independence Party Ticket\n\n\n"}

Kira and Bashir have an adventure in the mirror universe of \"Star Trek\", which brought to the show \"Deep Space Nine\" a plot device first introduced in \"The Original Series\" episode \"\", which aired on October 6, 1967.\n\nAfter experiencing operational difficulties while traveling through the Wormhole, Major Kira and Dr. Bashir find themselves in an alternate universe populated by exact doubles of the people in their own universe. In this universe, the wormhole is unknown, and Terrans (i.e., humans) are slaves; Deep Space Nine is run by the Intendant, Kira's counterpart, with Garak as her second in command and Odo overseeing the Terran slaves. As Bashir is sent to work in ore-processing, the Intendant tells Kira about James Kirk's ; that incident led to the formation of a powerful alliance between the Klingons, Cardassians, and Bajorans, and the eventual conquest of the Terrans.\n\nBashir tries to talk Miles O'Brien, a fellow slave, into configuring the transporters to help Kira and Bashir return home, but the beaten, put-upon O'Brien is unwilling to risk the wrath of his superiors. Meanwhile, Kira almost succeeds in securing help from Quark, but he is arrested and executed by Garak for helping Terrans escape the station. Kira meets Sisko's Mirror Universe counterpart, who receives better treatment than the other Terrans for carrying out piracy on behalf of the Klingon-Cardassian alliance.\n\nThe Intendant assures Kira that she has nothing to fear, and suggests they should become closer. Later, Garak tells Kira that he intends to kill the Intendant, and that he will let Kira and Bashir escape if she impersonates the Intendant and yields power to Garak; Bashir will be killed if she does not comply.\n\nKira tells Bashir they must find a way back to their runabout and make their escape through the wormhole. She tries to recruit Sisko's aid, but he is unmoved. That night, Garak prepares to put his plan into effect at a lavish party thrown by the Intendant. Meanwhile, an accident at the ore-processing plant, gives Bashir the opportunity to escape, killing Odo in the process.\n\nBashir convinces O'Brien to help, but the two are captured and brought to face the Intendant, who sentences them to death. O'Brien makes an impassioned speech, telling the assembled crowd what Bashir has revealed about a universe where Terrans have respect and dignity. His words move Sisko, who turns on the Intendant and helps Kira and Bashir to escape. The two return to their universe, leaving Sisko and O'Brien's counterparts to fight for the rights of Terrans in their own world.\n\nThis was the first of five mirror universe episodes of \"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine\": \"Crossover\", \"Through the Looking Glass\", \"Shattered Mirror\", \"Resurrection\", and \"The Emperor's New Cloak\".\n\nA 2015 binge-watching guide for \"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine\" by W.I.R.E.D. recommended not skipping this essential episode.\n\nIn 2016, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" rated \"Crossover\" the 78th best episode of all \"Star Trek\" episodes. They note that this episode references the events in the Mirror Universe that occurred in the episode \"Mirror, Mirror\" and that this enhances the episode.\n\nIn 2017, SyFy ranked this the second best Mirror Universe episode of \"Star Trek\" of the seven that had aired at the time.\n\n\n"}

He was raised in Bakersfield, California, has lived in New York City since 1978, and is the author of ten novels to date.\n\nHis work combines experimental technique with a direct emotionality, often dealing with the anguish inherent in human communication.\n\nExcerpted in many print and online magazines, his work has won a Notable Stories in \"StorySouth\"s Million Writers Award, and been nominated four times for the Pushcart Prize.\n\nIn his first novel, \"Our Plague (A Film from New York)\" (1993), the protagonist is an underground filmmaker alienated from his own body, disgusted by his own careerism, and awash in apocalyptic visions. Not a lucid book, rather a difficult one, though energetic and full of unexpected choices.\n\nThe story in the brief \"The Walls Collide as You Expand, Dwarf Maple\" (1993) seems almost desiccated: a young woman grows up, meets a man on a train, and lives with him in a city. The writing, as such, is simple and spare, unlike that of his other books.\n\n\"Glass (Pray the Electrons Back to Sand)\" (1994), a \"Television-War Novel\" about the first Gulf War, blurs reality into its electronic media equivalent, to suggest a new, amoral, surrealistically detached technological level to the old horrors of war. The nearest to a conventional novel by this author.\n\n\"In Candyland It's Cool to Feed on Your Friends\" (1998), a strangely knotted and personal work, deals with an indigent photographer who loses his closest friends for the crime of having exploited them for his artwork. The frame provided for the narrative strongly implies that something like this took place in the author's own life.\n\nThe visionary, messianic heroine of \"Daughter! I Forbid Your Recurring Dream!\" (2000) flings herself into all manner of self-expression, but willfully loses faith in each attempt at meaning, and each time ends up more broken, more solitary.\n\nStet (2006), Chapman's most ambitious book to date, takes the form of a bitter \"Russian novel\" about an ecstatic and weirdly oblivious Soviet filmmaker and painter, who ends up in prison camp as punishment for his private and antisocial tendencies.\n\n\"How is This Going to Continue?\" (2007), a shorter work in the form of an oratorio libretto, seems to carry the artist-figure, a composer this time, further into private grief and alienation. The subject of this \"libretto\" is the death of the composer's wife, followed by the composer's own death. The novel, if such it is, consists entirely of quotations from other sources (many of which are, however, invented).\n\n\"Degenerescence\" (2009) appears as a kind of endpoint of this alienated phase, where the author has finally turned away from the last of his own recognizable mannerisms, in favor of pseudo-ancient repetitive incantation about how the invention of narrative story causes the destruction of the hymn foundation of the world: what might be called a home-made Sumerian myth.\n\n\"The Rat Veda\" (2010), for all its dire setting (its \"hero\" is a rat in the subway), in fact marks a change for the brighter, in that as the rat waits to transcend his self-made imprisonment, he worships beauty in the form of an idealized love, a dancer who seems to exist just over his head.\n\n\"Qurratulain\" (2012) might be seen as the last in a \"religious\" trilogy (\"Degenerescence\" having drawn imagery from Sumerian myth, and \"The Rat Veda\" from devotional Hinduism). A Christian priest in the time of the monastic Desert Fathers falls in love with the title character, and together they go to the desert to pray and argue with God. As in \"Rat Veda\", beauty and ecstatic love seem to outweigh all other aspects of existence.\n\n\n\n\nChapman also operates Fugue State Press, a publisher of \"advanced and experimental fiction\" which has published a peculiar assortment of work by Noah Cicero, Ben Brooks, Joshua Cohen, André Malraux, Prakash Kona, and others. Chapman has referred to the press as \"an orphanage for the unpublishable,\" indicating that the work is not commercially viable in the current publishing marketplace.\n\n"}

He graduated from the Electrical & Electronic Engineering faculty of Ngee Ann Polytechnic (then known as Ngee Ann Technical College) in 1975, after which he worked in the private engineering sector.\n\nOn 1 July 1981, with a capital outlay of US$6,000, Sim (along with former schoolmate Ng Kai Wa) founded Creative Technology in the form of a computer repair shop in Pearl's Centre, in Chinatown. There he developed and sold an add-on memory board for the Apple II computer. Later, Creative began creating customized PCs adapted for the Chinese language, including enhanced audio capabilities that allowed the devices to produce speech and melodies. The success of this audio interface led to the development of the stand-alone sound card Sound Blaster. It was among the first dedicated audio processing cards widely available to general consumers. Creative dominated the PC audio market until the 2000s, when OEM PCs began to be built with integrated sound boards in the motherboard. Sound Blaster then found itself reduced to a niche product.\n\nSim Wong Hoo has won accolades from industry and government for his innovations. This includes winning Singapore’s Public Star Medal Bintang Bakti Masyarakat in 2001 for outstanding achievements in the business field.

Appointive deputy mayors serve at the pleasure of the mayor and may function as chief operating officers.\n\nThere may be within the same municipal government one or more deputy mayors appointed to oversee policy areas together with a popularly-elected vice mayor who serves as the mayor's successor in the event the office is vacated by death, resignation, disability, or impeachment.\n\nIn other cities, the deputy mayor presides over the city council, and may not vote except to break ties. Like the deputy mayor in other systems, the popularly elected deputy mayor becomes an Acting Mayor in the original mayor's absence. As previously noted, in some few cities, this office is elected separately and does not entail the elevation by the council of one of its members to be speaker. In some U.S. cities, the mayor and deputy mayor run together as a citywide ticket similar to how the president and vice president run at the national level.\n\nIn New York City, there are multiple deputy mayors who handle coordination of specific policy areas where the First Deputy Mayor serves as the general deputy mayor for the Mayor of New York City.\n\nIn St. Louis, Missouri, there are multiple deputy mayors who handle coordination of specific policy areas where the deputy Mayors serves as the general deputy's mayors for the Mayor of St. Louis.\n\nIn Cincinnati, Ohio, the vice mayor is appointed by the mayor from amongst the elected city council members. As of January 2, 2018, Christopher Smitherman has served as the vice mayor of Cincinnati after being appointed by Mayor John Cranley to replace former Vice Mayor David S. Mann.\n\nIn Israel, according to the Local Authorities (Election and Term of Mayor and Deputy Mayors) Act, 5735-1975, a Mayor is usually elected in \"personal, general, direct, equal and secret elections\", with election by a local council being made only if no candidate runs for mayor, a candidate for mayor in a single-candidate election is rejected (in Israel, unlike in the UK, if only one candidate runs he is not automatically elected, and voters would vote either for that candidate or against him), or both candidates advancing to the runoff received an equal number of votes and the tie remains unbroken after adding the number of first-round votes cast for them with the number of second-round votes cast for them. However, deputy mayors are always elected by the local council, of which one is (or, in certain local authorities two are) the Designated Acting Mayor, elected after nomination by the Mayor.\n\nThe French term \"député-maire\" does not mean \"deputy mayor\", but refers to a mayor who is also a deputy of the National Assembly of France. As of 31 March 2017, a mayor cannot hold both posts (article LO 141-1 of the electoral code). The term for deputy mayor in French is \"Maire adjoint\".\n\nIn Davao City, there is both an elected vice-mayor as a direct constitutionally mandated deputy of the Mayor of Davao City and appointed deputy mayors. The deputy mayors are appointed to administer each ethnic minorities situated in Davao City.\n\nIn Spain, this function is performed by a \"\"Teniente de alcalde.\"\"\n"}

The verse is part of the section where the genealogy of Joseph, the legal father of Jesus, is listed.\n\nThe original Koine Greek, according to Westcott and Hort, reads:\n\nIn the King James Version of the Bible the text reads:\n\nThe World English Bible translates the passage as:\n\nFor a collection of other versions see BibleHub Matthew 1:3\n\nThis is the second verse of the genealogy and these are the ancestors of many Old Testament figures. This genealogy matches that given in several other places in the Bible. Harold Fowler notes that the portion from this verse to seems to be based on . It covers a period before and during the Egyptian captivity. The genealogy runs through Judah, Perez, Hezron, and Aram. Nothing is known of Hezron or Aram, other than their appearances in the various genealogies. Perez, his brother and mother, are important figures in the Old Testament.\n\nThe most notable part of the genealogy, and where it diverts from others recounting this lineage, is the mention of Zerah, brother of Perez, and their mother Tamar. These two figures are not directly on the genealogy, but are mentioned nonetheless. Tamar, the wife of Judah, is the first of four women that are added to Matthew's genealogy. mentions Ruth and Rahab while in Bathsheba, wife of Uriah the Hittite, is mentioned indirectly. This is unusual because in this period women were not generally included in genealogies. The women do not appear in the genealogy in Luke 3. Fowler states that the addition of the female names to the genealogy was not only unprecedented, but that the very idea would have been \"abhorrent\" to the traditional authorities. Scholars have proposed several explanations for their inclusion.\n\nThere is a fifth prominent woman in Matthew 1, the Virgin Mary. William F. Albright and C.S. Mann support the popular theory that the four other women are mentioned to highlight the important roles women have played in the past and also to portray Mary, the Mother of Jesus, as the equal of these well-known figures. Raymond E. Brown feels these women are added to show that God often works through women and also that his actions are not always in keeping with standard mores. Feminist scholars such as Amy-Jill Levine support the idea that the addition of women to the male dominated genealogy demonstrates that women have an important role and serves to undermine the patriarchal message of the long list of male begat male.\n\nJerome is the first to have noted the sinful nature of the women. Bathsheba was an adulteress and Rahab was a harlot. There were many greater, more notable, and more virtuous women in Jewish history that are not mentioned. Jerome felt Matthew includes these women to illustrate how pressing the need for Jesus is at the time. Robert H. Gundry agrees that all four have a dubious reputation and sees their addition to the genealogy as an attempt to show that the great leaders of Jewish history have origins as undignified as those of Jesus. Harolf Fowler disagrees, arguing that under any circumstances the author of Matthew would have been unlikely to link the Virgin Mary to harlots and adulterers.\n\nAnother important link between the four, first noted by John Chrysostom, is their foreignness. All four women were traditionally regarded as non-Jewish. Rahab was a Canaanite as most likely was Tamar. Ruth was a Moabite and Bathsheba is perhaps a Hittite and was certainly married to one. Bathsheba's foreignness is emphasized in Matthew 1:6 as she is referred to not by her name, but as \"the wife of Uriah,\" Uriah being Uriah the Hittite, a well-known foreigner. The inclusion of the four foreign women is often interpreted as showing that Jesus' is not only meant as the saviour of the Jews, but of the Gentiles as well.\n\n"}

It was in existence from 1961 to 1994.\n\nThe regiment was formed on 7 February 1961 at Redford Barracks, Edinburgh, with the amalgamation of 1st Battalion, Seaforth Highlanders and 1st Battalion, Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders to form the 1st Battalion, Queen's Own Highlanders. This was a part of the defence reforms originally announced in the 1957 Defence White Paper, which saw a reduction in the size of the British Army to reflect the end of National Service.\n\nThe battalion was sent to Singapore in April 1961 from where it was deployed to Brunei in December 1962 in order to help suppress the Brunei Revolt at an early stage of the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation. This included a successful air assault on the rebel–held Shell oilfields at Seria, with the airfield quickly recaptured and 48 hostages released. Returning to Singapore in February 1962, the battalion went back to Borneo three months later for a further operational tour, mainly consisting of long patrols and manning outlying garrisons on the border with Indonesia.\n\nOn return to Scotland in January 1964, the battalion was based at Milton Bridge Camp, a former facility for German Prisoners of War, located south east of Glencorse Barracks. In June 1964 the battalion moved to Mercer Barracks at Osnabrück Garrison, part of British Army of the Rhine, remaining there until August 1966 when it moved to Wavell Barracks in Berlin. The battalion returned to Redford Barracks in September 1968 from where units were deployed to Sharjah on the Persian Gulf in May 1969, while in July 1970 it undertook ceremonial duties at that year's Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh.\n\nIn April 1971 the battalion returned to Osnabrück Garrison, from where they were deployed for a total of three separate four–month operational tours at the height of the Troubles in Northern Ireland: November 1971 – March 1972 (East Belfast); July – October 1972: (Dungannon) and December 1973 – April 1974 (West Belfast). In June 1976 the battalion returned to Scotland, this time to Ritchie Camp, West Lothian, from where parts of the battalion were deployed to Belize, Gibraltar and twice to Northern Ireland, April – August 1978 (North Armagh) and July – December 1979 (South Armagh). During this tour, the battalion's commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel David Blair, was killed by one of two roadside bombs that took the lives of a total of eighteen soldiers at Warrenpoint, County Down. A total of seven Queen's Own Highlanders were killed in Northern Ireland between 1973 and 1990.\n\nIn March 1980 the battalion was despatched for a tour at Stanley Fort in Hong Kong before moving to Tidworth in November 1981. In spite of it then being the Army's \"Spearhead\" battalion – kept in readiness for rapid deployment worldwide – it did not take part in the Falklands War that commenced in April 1982. It was, however, stationed in the Falklands Islands immediately after the war, from July – December 1982, and led the operation to restore normality on the islands. This work resulted in the award to the regiment of the Wilkinson Sword of Peace, bestowed annually on the unit of the British Armed Forces that has made the greatest contribution to community relations.\n\nIn November 1983, the battalion moved to Alexander Barracks, Aldergrove, as the Northern Ireland resident battalion, and on to Fort George in November 1985. In March 1988 the battalion moved to Buller Barracks in Münster, Germany, from where units were again deployed to Northern Ireland for five months from March 1990 (Belfast) and to Saudi Arabia in January 1991, where they took part in the Gulf War. In the Gulf, the battalion was split up to support other units, including attachments to the 1st Royal Scots and 3rd Royal Regiment of Fusiliers (3RRF) to bring these units up to strength. Three Queen's Own Highlanders serving with 3 RRF were among eleven soldiers killed in a friendly fire incident, when two US A-10 aircraft mistakenly bombed a UK armoured column. After the war, the battalion returned to Münster with a further six month deployment to Northern Ireland (Belfast) from November 1992. The battalion returned to Scotland in October 1993 and moved into Dreghorn Barracks, near Edinburgh.\n\nDue to the Options for Change defence review the battalion was amalgamated with 1st Battalion, Gordon Highlanders on 17 September 1994 to form 1st Battalion, Highlanders (Seaforth, Gordons and Camerons). There was a high–profile, although ultimately unsuccessful, campaign to stop the proposed amalgamation.\n\nAfter the formation of the Queen's Own Highlanders in February 1961, the part–time Territorial Army units of the pre-amalgamation regiments continued unchanged, with the 11th battalion, Seaforth Highlanders (TA) and the 4/5 battalion Cameron Highlanders (TA). In April 1967 both were disbanded on the formation of the 3rd (Territorial) battalion, Queen's Own Highlanders, which was itself disbanded in March 1969. From then on, the part–time element of all Highland regiments were included within the 51st Highland Volunteers.\n\nThe Army Cadet Force (ACF) units in the northern counties of Scotland retained the designation and cap badges of the Seaforth and Cameron Highlanders until 1968, when they became the North Highland ACF and adopted the Queen's Own Highlanders badge. In 1975 they became the 1st Cadet Battalion Queen's Own Highlanders ACF and, in April 1982, the Queen's Own Highlanders Battalion ACF. In September 1999 the battalion was re-badged under the Highlanders (Seaforth, Gordons and Camerons) and renamed to 1st Battalion The Highlanders, Army Cadet Force.\n\nThe Highlanders' Museum (Queen's Own Highlanders Collection) is based at Fort George, near Inverness, Scotland.\n\nThe regiment wore the Mackenzie tartan kilt (as worn by the former Seaforth Highlanders) and Cameron of Erracht tartan trews, with the reverse for pipers, drummers and band members.\n\n\nColonels of the regiment were:\n\nThe regiment had the following alliances:\n\n\n"}

We write\n\nwith formula_2 being the flow velocity vector having components formula_3 in the formula_4 coordinate direction (with formula_4 denoting the components of the coordinate vector formula_6). The mean velocities formula_7 are determined by either time averaging, spatial averaging or ensemble averaging, depending on the flow under study. Further formula_8 denotes the fluctuating (turbulence) part of the velocity.\n\nWe consider a homogeneous fluid, whose density \"ρ\" is taken to be a constant. For such a fluid, the components \"τ\"' of the Reynolds stress tensor are defined as:\n\nAnother – often used – definition, for constant density, of the Reynolds stress components is:\n\nwhich has the dimensions of velocity squared, instead of stress.\n\nTo illustrate, Cartesian vector index notation is used. For simplicity, consider an incompressible fluid:\n\nGiven the fluid velocity formula_11 as a function of position and time, write the average fluid velocity as formula_7, and the velocity fluctuation is formula_8. Then formula_14.\n\nThe conventional ensemble rules of averaging are that\n\nOne splits the Euler equations or the Navier-Stokes equations into an average and a fluctuating part. One finds that upon averaging the fluid equations, a stress on the right hand side appears of the form formula_16. This is the Reynolds stress, conventionally written formula_17:\n\nThe divergence of this stress is the force density on the fluid due to the turbulent fluctuations.\n\nFor instance, for an incompressible, viscous, Newtonian fluid, the continuity and momentum equations—the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations—can be written (in a non-conservative form) as\n\nand\n\nwhere formula_21 is the Lagrangian derivative or the substantial derivative,\n\nDefining the flow variables above with a time-averaged component and a fluctuating component, the continuity and momentum equations become\n\nand\n\nExamining one of the terms on the left hand side of the momentum equation, it is seen that\n\nwhere the last term on the right hand side vanishes as a result of the continuity equation. Accordingly, the momentum equation becomes\n\nNow the continuity and momentum equations will be averaged. The ensemble rules of averaging need to be employed, keeping in mind that the average of products of fluctuating quantities will not in general vanish. After averaging, the continuity and momentum equations become\n\nand\n\nUsing the product rule on one of the terms of the left hand side, it is revealed that\n\nwhere the last term on the right hand side vanishes as a result of the averaged continuity equation. The averaged momentum equation now becomes, after a rearrangement:\n\nwhere the Reynolds stresses, formula_31, are collected with the viscous normal and shear stress terms, formula_32.\n\nThe time evolution equation of Reynolds stress was firstly given by Eq.(1.6) in Zhou Peiyuan's paper . The equation in modern form is \nThis equation is very complex. If formula_34 is traced, turbulence kinetic energy is obtained.\nThe last term formula_35 is \nturbulent dissipation rate. \n\nThe question then is, what is the value of the Reynolds stress? This has been the subject of intense modeling and interest, for roughly the past century. The problem is recognized as a closure problem, akin to the problem of closure in the BBGKY hierarchy. A transport equation for the Reynolds stress may be found by taking the outer product of the fluid equations for the fluctuating velocity, with itself.\n\nOne finds that the transport equation for the Reynolds stress includes terms with higher-order correlations (specifically, the triple correlation formula_36) as well as correlations with pressure fluctuations (i.e. momentum carried by sound waves). A common solution is to model these terms by simple \"ad hoc\" prescriptions.\n\nThe theory of the Reynolds stress is quite analogous to the kinetic theory of gases, and indeed the stress tensor in a fluid at a point may be seen to be the ensemble average of the stress due to the thermal velocities of molecules at a given point in a fluid. Thus, by analogy, the Reynolds stress is sometimes thought of as consisting of an isotropic pressure part, termed the turbulent pressure, and an off-diagonal part which may be thought of as an effective turbulent viscosity.\n\nIn fact, while much effort has been expended in developing good models for the Reynolds stress in a fluid, as a practical matter, when solving the fluid equations using computational fluid dynamics, often the simplest turbulence models prove the most effective. One class of models, closely related to the concept of turbulent viscosity, are the k-epsilon turbulence models, based upon coupled transport equations for the turbulent energy density formula_37 (similar to the turbulent pressure, i.e. the trace of the Reynolds stress) and the turbulent dissipation rate formula_38.\n\nTypically, the average is formally defined as an ensemble average as in statistical ensemble theory. However, as a practical matter, the average may also be thought of as a spatial average over some length scale, or a temporal average. Note that, while formally the connection between such averages is justified in equilibrium statistical mechanics by the ergodic theorem, the statistical mechanics of hydrodynamic turbulence is currently far from understood. In fact, the Reynolds stress at any given point in a turbulent fluid is somewhat subject to interpretation, depending upon how one defines the average.\n\n"}

As pianist and arranger Jupp was also a long-serving member of the Oscar Rabin Band, one of Britain's most popular dance orchestras of that period.\n\nIn 1951 Jupp formed his own orchestra at the request of the BBC and began making regular radio broadcasts and also appeared in the Hammer Films TV series \"Bands on Parade\". He began writing music for films in Britain, beginning with the crime drama \"The Secret Place\" (1957). Jupp first visited Australia in 1960 under short-term contract to the Australian Broadcasting Commission (ABC), and during his visit he arranged the music for the single \"First Kiss / My Secret\" (July 1960) by pop duo the Allen Brothers, which included Peter Allen.\n\nJupp returned to England later in the year but in 1961 he was invited to join the ABC as musical director of its light entertainment department, based in Sydney. Soon after taking up his new post he formed the Eric Jupp Orchestra and launched his popular and long-running weekly ABC-TV series \"The Magic of Music\", which was seen in 29 countries and ran from 1961 to 1974. The series featured mainly \"orchestral pops\" and light classical music, but it also included regular jazz segments featuring notable Australian performers such as Don Burrows and George Golla.\n\nThe success of the series led to a contract with EMI's Columbia label and a string of popular \"Magic of Music\" LPs that continued to the mid-1970s. The LPs (and the show) often featured vocalists Shirley McDonald (whom Jupp married in the 1960s) and Neil Williams.\n\nJupp soon made a name for himself as a leading composer for film and TV in Australia. Undoubtedly his best-remembered composition is the theme for the hugely popular 1960s TV series \"Skippy the Bush Kangaroo\". The long version (the B-side on the record) has lyrics written by Ted Roberts.\n\nIn early 1968 Jupp moved to Norfolk Island, commuting by air to the mainland for his TV, radio and film work.\n\nAmong his later film and television credits, Jupp was the music director for the 1971 Fauna Productions adventure series \"Barrier Reef\". He composed music for the TV series \"Bailey's Bird\" (1977) and wrote the score for Michael Pate's 1979 film version of Colleen McCullough's first novel, \"Tim\", starring the then unknown Mel Gibson. It was Jupp who persuaded McCullough to settle on Norfolk Island after she shot to fame with her second novel, \"The Thorn Birds\".\n\nHis last major TV credit was the score for the early 1990s remake of \"Skippy\". In his retirement, Jupp and his family moved to Launceston in Tasmania. He died there in January 2003, after several months' illness, survived by his third wife Anita, his two daughters Linda and Catherine, six grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.\n\n"}

The album was recorded at INS Studios in New York where Weaver created an album of seven tracks that included rapping and instrumentals that were both inspired and sampled various funk musicians from the 1970s. The album was released independently in 1986. Singles from the album included the tracks \"Saturday Night\" and \"Dedication to All B-Boys\".\n\n\"Saturday Night! – The Album\" was re-issued by Jive Records in 1987 with several extra tracks that were originally intended for Weaver's follow-up album \"Smoke Some Kill\". The album charted on the Billboard's Black Albums chart and the UK Top Indie Album chart on its release. The album content was described by AllMusic as putting Weaver \"in hot water with many critics and community leaders.\" Critical reception on its release was mixed with the album being referred to as \"artless\" by \"The Washington Post\" while other critics such as Robert Christgau gave it a positive review. The \"NME\" placed it on their list of the top albums of 1987.\n\nWeaver began recording \"Saturday Night! – The Album\" in 1986. He was being barred from the studio where he originally recorded his single for \"P.S.K. What Does It Mean?\" and went to INS Studios in New York. To compose the music, Weaver first started working on the drums, stating that \"by 1985 I had mastered the [Roland TR-]909.\" After completing the drums, Weaver worked on lyrics and vocals when he \"smoked and drank until we got silly enough. At that point, the first thing that hit my mind-that was the song\". Some songs were performed with live musicians such as \"B-Boy Rhyme and Riddle\" which had a live drummer brought in by engineer Joe Nicolo. The music on \"Saturday Night\" was the result of DJ Codemoney forgetting a plug for the 909. Weaver used the drum machine at the studio to record the song without the 909 on hand and accidentally pushed a button that sent the kick and snare to go to the timbales sound. This new sound was used for the song \"Saturday Night\".\n\nThe initial release of \"Saturday Night! – The Album\" consisted of seven songs and was released through Weaver's own Schoolly-D Records. Weaver signed with Jive Records to \"pay a lot of bills\" as the distributors of his previous work were not paying him for the records that were sold. \"Saturday Night! – The Album\" was re-released by Jive in 1987 with extra tracks including \"Parkside 5-2\", \"Housing the Joint\" and \"Get N' Paid\". These three tracks were originally intended for Weaver's next album \"Smoke Some Kill\". Weaver was upset after finding these new tracks added to the album, stating that \"it was a total scam to reissue \"Saturday Night\" like they did, with those tracks, because it had already sold hundreds of thousands of copies.\" and that if these tracks were released on \"Smoke Some Kill\", his follow-up album would have \"been an even better record\". \n\nBrian Coleman, author of \"Check the Technique\" described \"Saturday Night! – The Album\" as \"what everything that Schoolly D was all about: funk, loose rhymes and attitude.\" \n\"We Get Ill\" was reviewed by \"Spin\", who called it \"a seamy celebration of bad habits and bad language. The track was inspired by Bootsy Collins and initially was going to be an instrumental. \"Do It, Do It\" was developed in DJ Codemoney's basement when he was working on a break involving Funkadelic's song \"You'll Like It Too\". The song samples the nursery rhyme \"Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?\" taken from a children's record. \"Dedication to All B-Boys\" was inspired by the group The Commodores. The track features a Weaver's disc jockey, DJ Codemoney, performing a long break at the end. Weaver explained this part of the song by stating that in \"rock and funk groups, everybody who was part of the band got to do their thing. And Code was part of the band.\"\n\nAllMusic writer David Jeffries noted songs such as \"Saturday Night\", stating it as \"the kind of sleazy tale of misogyny that put Schoolly in hot water with many critics and community leaders.\"\nWhen asked about his lyrics commanding a woman to \"do it doggy style\" in his song \"Do It Do It\", Weaver stated that the lyrics are a reflection of his background and audience, and not necessarily how he feels about others. Weaver reflected on the song \"Saturday Night\" as being about \"my 17 year old Saturday night\" which consisted of going down to the Parkside Inn, drinking, and \"watching the bitches on the corner\" and that the song was not meant to be taken literally, but that he \"did come home once with a girl and I forgot my key and my mom was pissed off, but she didn't pull a gun; she's never owned a gun in her life\".\n\n\"Housing the Joint\" was influenced by a trip to California when he heard the song \"Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)\" by Sly and the Family Stone. Upon hearing it, Weaver booked studio time and recorded the song in a day. The track's lyrics involve a conflict Weaver had with rapper Spoonie Gee and his song \"That's My Style\" where he claims that Weaver was appropriating his technique. Weaver has since performed with Spoonie Gee on stage and later stated he \"never felt comfortable\" performing this track in concert.\n\n\"Saturday Night! – The Album\" was first released on Schooly-D Records in 1986. On the album's Jive Records re-release, it charted on \"Billboard\"'s Top Black Albums for ten weeks peaking at number 59. In the United Kingdom, the album was released by Mute Records affiliate called Rhythm King where it charted on the UK Indie Charts for 10 weeks peaking at number four. Singles for the album included \"Saturday Night\" and \"Dedication to All B-Boys\" released on Schooly-D Records and Flame Records. Both \"Saturday Night\" and \"Dedication to All B-Boys\" appeared on the UK Indie Charts.\" On its release, Philadelphia's city officials had the album removed from store shelves after public outrage over the violent content in the songs.\n\n\"Saturday Night! – The Album\" was released for the first time on compact disc by Funky Town Grooves on July 21, 2014. The CD release included radio edits, remixes and instrumentals of songs from the album as bonus tracks.\n\nFrom contemporary reviews, \"The Washington Post\" gave the album a mixed review, stating that \"even by rap standards, [Schooly D's] work is artless.\" The review compared the album negatively to other rappers, noting that they \"construct complex hip-hop concertos for voice, beat-box and borrowed sounds, Schooly's best-known work is little more than a beat accompanying his foul-mouthed, ill-tempered rants\". The review also found that \"there's no denying that his harsh communiqués crackle with a mean-streets vitality as fascinating as his confrontational world view is disturbing.\" Robert Christgau gave the Jive reissue of the album a B, stating \"What other rapper would write a rhyme about the night his mother pulled a gun on him—or make it so clear that, just like in West Side Story, he's depraved on account of he's deprived. This doesn't speak too well of white critics, obviously, but it also doesn't take away his raps, his rips, or his muscleman groove.\" \"Spin\" stated that it \"can't sustain an album with just reverb and a cowbell. Even if it is killer reverb and a way funky cowbell.\" The \"NME\" placed \"Saturday Night! – The Album\" at number 20 on their list of the top albums of 1987. The single \"Saturday Night\" was also listed at number 28 on their list of Top 50 tracks of the year.\n\n\"Spin Alternative Record Guide\" (1995) gave the original release an eight out of ten and the Jive re-release a nine out of ten. The review concluded that Jive's release was superior as it included \"some of Schoolly's best cuts (\"Housing the Joint,\" \"Park-side 5-2\")\"\nAllMusic gave the album a four star rating, finding it better than Weaver's previous album \"Schooly D\" due to \"higher production values and more direct songs.\"\n\nAll songs are written and produced by Schooly D (J.B.

{"id": "1852304", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1852304", "title": "Linear probing", "text": "Linear probing\n\nLinear probing is a scheme in computer programming for resolving collisions in hash tables, data structures for maintaining a collection of key–value pairs and looking up the value associated with a given key. It was invented in 1954 by Gene Amdahl, Elaine M. McGraw, and Arthur Samuel and first analyzed in 1963 by Donald Knuth.\n\nAlong with quadratic probing and double hashing, linear probing is a form of open addressing. In these schemes, each cell of a hash table stores a single key–value pair. When the hash function causes a collision by mapping a new key to a cell of the hash table that is already occupied by another key, linear probing searches the table for the closest following free location and inserts the new key there. Lookups are performed in the same way, by searching the table sequentially starting at the position given by the hash function, until finding a cell with a matching key or an empty cell.\n\nAs write, \"Hash tables are the most commonly used nontrivial data structures, and the most popular implementation on standard hardware uses linear probing, which is both fast and simple.\"\nLinear probing can provide high performance because of its good locality of reference, but is more sensitive to the quality of its hash function than some other collision resolution schemes. It takes constant expected time per search, insertion, or deletion when implemented using a random hash function, a 5-independent hash function, or tabulation hashing. Good results can also be achieved in practice with other hash functions such as MurmurHash.\n\nLinear probing is a component of open addressing schemes for using a hash table to solve the dictionary problem. In the dictionary problem, a data structure should maintain a collection of key–value pairs subject to operations that insert or delete pairs from the collection or that search for the value associated with a given key.\nIn open addressing solutions to this problem, the data structure is an array (the hash table) whose cells (when nonempty) each store a single key–value pair. A hash function is used to map each key into the cell of where that key should be stored, typically scrambling the keys so that keys with similar values are not placed near each other in the table. A hash collision occurs when the hash function maps a key into a cell that is already occupied by a different key. Linear probing is a strategy for resolving collisions, by placing the new key into the closest following empty cell.\n\nTo search for a given key , the cells of are examined, beginning with the cell at index (where is the hash function) and continuing to the adjacent cells , , ..., until finding either an empty cell or a cell whose stored key is .\nIf a cell containing the key is found, the search returns the value from that cell. Otherwise, if an empty cell is found, the key cannot be in the table, because it would have been placed in that cell in preference to any later cell that has not yet been searched. In this case, the search returns as its result that the key is not present in the dictionary.\n\nTo insert a key–value pair into the table (possibly replacing any existing pair with the same key), the insertion algorithm follows the same sequence of cells that would be followed for a search, until finding either an empty cell or a cell whose stored key is .\nThe new key–value pair is then placed into that cell.\n\nIf the insertion would cause the load factor of the table (its fraction of occupied cells) to grow above some preset threshold, the whole table may be replaced by a new table, larger by a constant factor, with a new hash function, as in a dynamic array. Setting this threshold close to zero and using a high growth rate for the table size leads to faster hash table operations but greater memory usage than threshold values close to one and low growth rates. A common choice would be to double the table size when the load factor would exceed 1/2, causing the load factor to stay between 1/4 and 1/2.\n\nIt is also possible to remove a key–value pair from the dictionary. However, it is not sufficient to do so by simply emptying its cell. This would affect searches for other keys that have a hash value earlier than the emptied cell, but that are stored in a position later than the emptied cell. The emptied cell would cause those searches to incorrectly report that the key is not present.\n\nInstead, when a cell is emptied, it is necessary to search forward through the following cells of the table until finding either another empty cell or a key that can be moved to cell (that is, a key whose hash value is equal to or earlier than ). When an empty cell is found, then emptying cell is safe and the deletion process terminates. But, when the search finds a key that can be moved to cell , it performs this move. This has the effect of speeding up later searches for the moved key, but it also empties out another cell, later in the same block of occupied cells. The search for a movable key continues for the new emptied cell, in the same way, until it terminates by reaching a cell that was already empty. In this process of moving keys to earlier cells, each key is examined only once. Therefore, the time to complete the whole process is proportional to the length of the block of occupied cells containing the deleted key, matching the running time of the other hash table operations.\n\nAlternatively, it is possible to use a lazy deletion strategy in which a key–value pair is removed by replacing the value by a special flag value indicating a deleted key. However, these flag values will contribute to the load factor of the hash table. With this strategy, it may become necessary to clean the flag values out of the array and rehash all the remaining key–value pairs once too large a fraction of the array becomes occupied by deleted keys.\n\nLinear probing provides good locality of reference, which causes it to require few uncached memory accesses per operation. Because of this, for low to moderate load factors, it can provide very high performance. However, compared to some other open addressing strategies, its performance degrades more quickly at high load factors because of primary clustering, a tendency for one collision to cause more nearby collisions. Additionally, achieving good performance with this method requires a higher-quality hash function than for some other collision resolution schemes. When used with low-quality hash functions that fail to eliminate nonuniformities in the input distribution, linear probing can be slower than other open-addressing strategies such as double hashing, which probes a sequence of cells whose separation is determined by a second hash function, or quadratic probing, where the size of each step varies depending on its position within the probe sequence.\n\nUsing linear probing, dictionary operations can be implemented in constant expected time. In other words, insert, remove and search operations can be implemented in O(1), as long as the load factor of the hash table is a constant strictly less than one.\n\nIn more detail, the time for any particular operation (a search, insertion, or deletion) is proportional to the length of the contiguous block of occupied cells at which the operation starts. If all starting cells are equally likely, in a hash table with cells, then a maximal block of occupied cells will have probability of containing the starting location of a search, and will take time whenever it is the starting location. Therefore, the expected time for an operation can be calculated as the product of these two terms, , summed over all of the maximal blocks of contiguous cells in the table. A similar sum of squared block lengths gives the expected time bound for a random hash function (rather than for a random starting location into a specific state of the hash table), by summing over all the blocks that could exist (rather than the ones that actually exist in a given state of the table), and multiplying the term for each potential block by the probability that the block is actually occupied. That is,\ndefining to be the event that there is a maximal contiguous block of occupied cells of length beginning at index , the expected time per operation is\nThis formula can be simplified by replacing by a simpler necessary condition , the event that\nat least elements have hash values that lie within a block of cells of length . After this replacement, the value within the sum no longer depends on , and the factor cancels the terms of the outer summation. These simplifications lead to the bound\nBut by the multiplicative form of the Chernoff bound, when the load factor is bounded away from one, the probability that a block of length contains at least hashed values is exponentially small as a function of ,\ncausing this sum to be bounded by a constant independent of . It is also possible to perform the same analysis using Stirling's approximation instead of the Chernoff bound to estimate the probability that a block contains exactly hashed values.\n\nIn terms of the load factor , the expected time for a successful search is , and the expected time for an unsuccessful search (or the insertion of a new key) is .\nFor constant load factors, with high probability, the longest probe sequence (among the probe sequences for all keys stored in the table) has logarithmic length.\n\nBecause linear probing is especially sensitive to unevenly distributed hash values, it is important to combine it with a high-quality hash function that does not produce such irregularities.\n\nThe analysis above assumes that each key's hash is a random number independent of the hashes of all the other keys. This assumption is unrealistic for most applications of hashing.\nHowever, random or pseudorandom hash values may be used when hashing objects by their identity rather than by their value. For instance, this is done using linear probing by the IdentityHashMap class of the Java collections framework.\nThe hash value that this class associates with each object, its identityHashCode, is guaranteed to remain fixed for the lifetime of an object but is otherwise arbitrary. Because the identityHashCode is constructed only once per object, and is not required to be related to the object's address or value, its construction may involve slower computations such as the call to a random or pseudorandom number generator. For instance, Java 8 uses an Xorshift pseudorandom number generator to construct these values.\n\nFor most applications of hashing, it is necessary to compute the hash function for each value every time that it is hashed, rather than once when its object is created. In such applications, random or pseudorandom numbers cannot be used as hash values, because then different objects with the same value would have different hashes. And cryptographic hash functions (which are designed to be computationally indistinguishable from truly random functions) are usually too slow to be used in hash tables. Instead, other methods for constructing hash functions have been devised. These methods compute the hash function quickly, and can be proven to work well with linear probing. In particular, linear probing has been analyzed from the framework of -independent hashing, a class of hash functions that are initialized from a small random seed and that are equally likely to map any -tuple of distinct keys to any -tuple of indexes. The parameter can be thought of as a measure of hash function quality: the larger is, the more time it will take to compute the hash function but it will behave more similarly to completely random functions.\nFor linear probing, 5-independence is enough to guarantee constant expected time per operation,\nwhile some 4-independent hash functions perform badly, taking up to logarithmic time per operation.\nAnother method of constructing hash functions with both high quality and practical speed is tabulation hashing. In this method, the hash value for a key is computed by using each byte of the key as an index into a table of random numbers (with a different table for each byte position). The numbers from those table cells are then combined by a bitwise exclusive or operation. Hash functions constructed this way are only 3-independent. Nevertheless, linear probing using these hash functions takes constant expected time per operation. Both tabulation hashing and standard methods for generating 5-independent hash functions are limited to keys that have a fixed number of bits. To handle strings or other types of variable-length keys, it is possible to compose a simpler universal hashing technique that maps the keys to intermediate values and a higher quality (5-independent or tabulation) hash function that maps the intermediate values to hash table indices.\n\nIn an experimental comparison, Richter et al. found that the Multiply-Shift family of hash functions (defined as formula_3) was \"the fastest hash function when integrated with all hashing schemes, i.e., producing the highest throughputs and also of good quality\" whereas tabulation hashing produced \"the lowest throughput\".\nThey point out that each table look-up require several cycles, being more expensive than simple arithmetic operations. They also found MurmurHash to be superior than tabulation hashing: \"By studying the results provided by Mult and Murmur, we think that the trade-off for by tabulation (...) is less attractive in practice\".\n\nThe idea of an associative array that allows data to be accessed by its value rather than by its address dates back to the mid-1940s in the work of Konrad Zuse and Vannevar Bush, but hash tables were not described until 1953, in an IBM memorandum by Hans Peter Luhn. Luhn used a different collision resolution method, chaining, rather than linear probing.\n\nThe first theoretical analysis of linear probing, showing that it takes constant expected time per operation with random hash functions, was given by Knuth. Sedgewick calls Knuth's work \"a landmark in the analysis of algorithms\". Significant later developments include a more detailed analysis of the probability distribution of the running time, and the proof that linear probing runs in constant time per operation with practically usable hash functions rather than with the idealized random functions assumed by earlier analysis.\n"}

Quadratic probing operates by taking the original hash index and adding successive values of an arbitrary quadratic polynomial until an open slot is found.\n\nAn example sequence using quadratic probing is:\n\nformula_1\n\nQuadratic probing can be a more efficient algorithm in a open addressing table, since it better avoids the clustering problem that can occur with linear probing, although it is not immune. It also provides good memory caching because it preserves some locality of reference; however, linear probing has greater locality and, thus, better cache performance.\n\nLet \"h\"(\"k\") be a hash function that maps an element \"k\" to an integer in [0, \"m\"−1], where \"m\" is the size of the table. Let the \"i\" probe position for a value \"k\" be given by the function \nwhere \"c\" ≠ 0. (If \"c\" = 0, then \"h\"(\"k\",\"i\") degrades to a linear probe.) For a given hash table, the values of \"c\" and \"c\" remain constant.\n\nExamples:\n\nWhen using quadratic probing, however (with the exception of triangular number cases for a hash table of size formula_6), there is no guarantee of finding an empty cell once the table becomes more than half full, or even before this if the table size is composite, because collisions must be resolved using half of the table at most.\n\nThe inverse of this can be proven as such: Suppose a hash table has size formula_7 (a prime greater than 3), with an initial location formula_8 and two alternative locations formula_9 and formula_10 (where formula_11 and formula_12).\nIf these two locations point to the same key space, but formula_13, then\nAs formula_7 is a prime number, either formula_19 or formula_20 must be divisible by formula_7.\nSince formula_22 and formula_23 are different (modulo formula_7), formula_25, and since both variables are greater than zero, formula_26. Thus, by contradiction, the first formula_27 alternative locations after formula_8 must be unique, and subsequently, an empty space can always be found so long as at most formula_27 locations are filled (i.e., the hash table is not more than half full).\n\nIf the sign of the offset is alternated (e.g. +1, −4, +9, −16, etc.), and if the number of buckets is a prime number formula_7 congruent to 3 modulo 4 (e.g. 3, 7, 11, 19, 23, 31, etc.), then the first formula_7 offsets will be unique (modulo formula_7). In other words, a permutation of 0 through formula_33 is obtained, and, consequently, a free bucket will always be found as long as at least one exists.\n\n"}

He has worked extensively with Guru and DJ Premier of Gang Starr, whom he has known since he was in high school.\n\nJeru the Damaja was born February 14, 1972, in Brooklyn, New York, and spent his early years in the borough's East New York neighborhood, where he began rhyming at block parties as a youth.\n\nDavis first showcased his unique style to audiences on \"I'm the Man\", a track from Gang Starr's 1992 album \"Daily Operation\". The following year he released his first single \"Come Clean\" which was produced by DJ Premier and became an underground hit.\n\nDavis's first album, \"The Sun Rises in the East\", was released in 1994 and produced entirely by DJ Premier. The album was well-received but was criticized by the Fugees for its lyrics, particularly for the song \"Da Bichez\". Fugees member Pras lightly mentioned Jeru on the track \"Zealots\", from the group's landmark 1996 album \"The Score\", with the line \"No matter who you damage, you're still a false prophet\", referencing Jeru's single \"You Can't Stop the Prophet\". Jeru responded lightly in the intro of the track \"Me or the Papes\" and also on the track \"Black Cowboys\".\n\nDavis followed up in 1996 with his second album, \"Wrath of the Math\", again produced solely by DJ Premier.

As on his first album, Jeru was critical of commercial hip-hop artists and the record labels that produced them such as Death Row Records and Bad Boy Entertainment; the latter he criticized on the concept track \"One Day\". After the release of \"Math\", Jeru reportedly had a falling-out with DJ Premier and Guru. Jeru, however, has dismissed this and claimed that they wanted to go in different directions.\n\nDavis appeared semi-retired until 1999, when he released his third album, \"Heroz4Hire\", released together with Mizmarvel, which was his first album under his then-newly created Know Savage Records. It featured the single \"99.9%\". His next album, \"Divine Design\", released in 2003, was the first album under his new record label, Ashenafi Records. The album received little attention and mixed reviews. On April 2, 2007, during a La Coka Nostra concert at the Gramercy Theatre in New York, Jeru the Damaja came out for a surprise appearance to perform his song \"D. Original\". His album \"Still Rising\" was released on October 16, 2007.\n\nIn 2009, Jeru started to collaborate with drum and bass producers. In 2009, he is featured on Kabuki's track \"Watch Your Step\", produced by Mainframe and also on \"Open Up Their Eyes\" by Italian producer Fabio Musta. He also collaborated with Group Home in 2010 for a song, \"Guru\" dedicated to the late rapper Guru. The next year, Jeru announced that he would be releasing a new record with production from '90s legends JuJu from the Beatnuts, Pete Rock, Large Professor and old collaborator DJ Premier but the album was not released. The same year he featured in the song \"Oddałbym\" on the album \"Reedukacja\" of Polish hip-hop group Slums Attack (Peja, Dj Decks). Polish rap star OSTR also featured on it, and the album was a great success in Poland, selling out in the first couple of days. In 2012 Jeru featured in the song \"The Mourning Son\" on the album \"Remix with the Sun\" of French trip hop group Chinese Man.\n\nIn July 2013, Jeru promised to soon release a new EP with production from Large Professor, PF Cuttin, Junkyard Ju, and Sabor. On June 17, 2014, Jeru released an EP through Hedspinn Records entitled \"The Hammer\" for digital download.\n\nHe has a home in Berlin.\n\nIn 2013 \"The Sun Rises in the East\" was ranked as one of the 100 greatest hip-hop albums of all time by the editors of About.com, who called it \"one of the quintessential '90s hip-hop albums.\"\n\n\n"}

It is governed by the Badminton World Federation.\n\nThe 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich saw the inaugural staging of badminton, as a demonstration sport. Two decades later the sport debuted in competition at the Barcelona 1992 Summer Olympics where 4 events were held, with singles and doubles events for both men and women. Four medals were awarded in each event, including two bronzes. The next Olympics, Atlanta 1996, had 5 events with the addition of mixed doubles.

For doubles, 19 pairs are selected. \n\nThe general method of selection is by ranking, though the selection process stops once all qualification positions are filled. All players or pairs from the top 16 places on that list qualify, though each National Olympic Committee can send a maximum of three players/pairs. Players and pairs through the 64th place on that ranking qualify, with the caveat that each NOC can send only two players/pairs from that portion of the list. Players and pairs ranked below that only qualify if they are the highest ranked competitor from their nation.\n\nIn addition, one place in each of the singles events is awarded by the Tripartite Commission. There are also regulations on minimum representation. Each continent must have at least one player/pair. This is the highest ranked player/pair from that continent if none have qualified through the standard selection process. The host nation, if it has not already qualified two competitors, receives two slots as well, either two singles players or one pair.\n\nOlympic badminton consists of a single-elimination tournament. Each match is played to the best of three games. Games are to 21 points. Rally scoring is used, meaning a player does not need to be serving to score. A player must win by two points or be the first player to 30 points.\n\nThe following nations have taken part in the badminton competition.

He served on the board of trustees for Science Service, now known as Society for Science & the Public, from 1957 to 1962.\n\nHe was married to Lynne Abraham, a former judge and District Attorney of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. \n\nBorn as Edward Felbin, he grew up in the Logan neighborhood of upper North Philadelphia, graduating from that city's Simon Gratz High School in 1934. He attended the University of Pennsylvania, graduating in 1939.\n\nWhile in college, he got a job at radio station WHAT as an announcer, earning $15 weekly plus transportation. He used the name \"Eddie Hoyle\" while hosting \"Hollywood According to Hoyle\", a gossip program. While selling radio time in 1946, a customer called Frankford Unity Grocery Store wanted to sponsor a music show; He decided that he would host the show himself to pick up a few extra dollars, and adopted the name \"Frank Ford\" for the show, a name that stuck with him for the rest of his life. In a 1995 interview with the \"Philadelphia Daily News\", he wondered \"what my name would be if the sponsor was the Piggly Wiggly stores.\"\n\nTogether with partners Lee Guber and Shelly Gross, he opened the Valley Forge Music Fair in Devon, Pennsylvania in 1955, featuring such shows as its inaugural production of \"The King and I\". Originally housed in a tent, a building was constructed on the site as a theater. Opened on an investment of $100,000, the business brought in a profit of about $50,000 their first summer, leading to the establishment of the Westbury Music Fair in Westbury, New York and other locations in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, and near both Baltimore and Washington, D.C., employing 2,000 performers and musicians at their peak.\n\nHe hosted a late-night talk show on WPEN, becoming one of the first shows to use equipment that would allow the host to interact directly with callers on the air, unlike previous shows that had the host repeat the caller's comments. In the early 1970s, he did multiple interviews with \"Unicorn Killer\" Ira Einhorn, who had murdered girlfriend Holly Maddux, later recalling that Einhorn \"stank even then\". He bought station WDVT in 1985, where his programming included a show hosted by publisher Mark Segal of the \"Philadelphia Gay News\" that was the city's first show on commercial radio with a gay focus. The station closed in 1988. He retired in 2000, after WWDB-FM switched to an all-music format.\n\nGuests on Ford's programs during his career included Lenny Bruce, Abbie Hoffman, Sugar Ray Robinson and Eleanor Roosevelt. He owned Auto Sport Importers, a business that made reproductions of a classic 1938 Jaguar called the Squire SS100, a model that sold several hundred cars but was never a viable business.\n\nThe Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia inducted Ford into their Hall of Fame in 2004.\n\nFord first met his future wife, Lynne Abraham, 24 years his junior, when she helped watch his ill father while his mother ran errands. Ford helped her get a job when she was a teen at the Valley Forge Music Fair he opened in 1955. Years later, when Abraham was in college, she would babysit for his stepdaughter. Abraham had been thinking of medical school and becoming a physician, when Ford told her \"\"You ought to be a lawyer. You're forthright. You've got a big mouth. You talk well. You're smart.\"\"\n\nHe married Abraham in June 1977, when he was 60 years old and hosting local radio talk shows, and she was a 36-year-old municipal court judge. She was an elected judge serving on the Pennsylvania Courts of Common Pleas when she was considering a run for Philadelphia District Attorney. Ford tried to dissuade her, telling Abraham that she would be losing her judicial tenure and would be taking a reduction in pay. Despite his objections, Abraham ran for office and was elected in 1991. Ford was extremely supportive of his wife's post, and regularly attended her press conferences and had her on his radio show until he became ill in October 2008. Ford was interested in architecture, art, dance, opera and food, and he and Abraham traveled extensively around the world.\n\nA longtime resident of Center City, Philadelphia, Ford died, at age 92, on March 3, 2009, at Vitas Hospice of St. Agnes Hospital in Philadelphia due to complications from a [[stroke.

{"id": "1852371", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1852371", "title": "Chicago Theological Seminary", "text": "Chicago Theological Seminary\n\nFounded in 1855, the Chicago Theological Seminary (CTS) is the oldest higher education institution in the City of Chicago and was founded with two principal goals: first, to educate pastors who would minister to people living on the new western frontier of the United States and second, to train ministers who would advance the movement to abolish slavery. Originally established in 1855 under the direction of the abolitionist Stephen Peet and the Congregational Church (now the United Church of Christ) by charter of the Illinois legislature, CTS has retained its forward-looking activist outlook throughout its history, graduating alumni who include Civil Rights activists Jesse Jackson, Sr. and Howard Schomer, social reformer Graham Taylor, and anti-Apartheid activist John W. de Gruchy. It is one of six seminaries affiliated with the United Church of Christ and follows an ecumenical tradition that stresses cooperation between different Christian denominations as well as interfaith understanding.\n\nThe seminary has counted many highly respected religious activists and theologians among its faculty and alumni, including G. Campbell Morgan, Anton Boisen, Stephen G. Ray Jr., Susan Brooks Thistlethwaite, and Otis Moss III, among others.\n\nChicago Theological enrolls a diverse student population representing more than 40 different faith traditions, perspectives and denominations, and houses the Center for the Study of Black Faith and Life (CSBFL) and the Interreligious Institute (IRI). CTS students hold academic reciprocity with member schools of the Association of Chicago Theological Schools consortium. Besides being a seminary of the United Church of Christ, CTS also offers students coursework necessary to be ordained by the Metropolitan Community Church denomination.\n\nThe first in many fields, CTS remains the first theological school to introduce the field education experience into a seminary curriculum, the first to create a distinct Department of Christian Sociology in an American theological school, the first seminary to award a degree in divinity to a woman in the US (Florence Fensham, 1902),\nthe first seminary in the US to award the Martin Luther King Jr. an honorary Doctor of Divinity degree for his activism in the Civil Rights movement, the first to elect an African American to lead a predominantly white theological school (C. Shelby Rooks, 1974–1984), and the first free-standing Protestant seminary to endow a chair in Jewish Studies.\n\nUnintimidated by controversy, Chicago Theological Seminary has enjoyed a distinguished record of setting trends in American faith life and leadership for more than a century. \n\nIn the 1850s and 1860s, CTS founder Stephen Peet was a leader in a new generation of 19 Century American abolitionists no longer content to wait patiently for the end of slavery nor to tolerate those who defended it. Under his leadership, the seminary was active in the Underground Railroad and was a leading voice in the Christian Abolitionism movement. \n\nThe very first CTS curriculum in 1855 was provided for a scattering of students among congregations and missions across the Midwest. Students were encouraged to learn by direct experience the facts of community life and church needs in a restless, experimental culture. Although such a practice was unknown at that time, this curriculum was the beginning of the first field education component ever introduced into seminary education. Field education is now a part of every accredited professional theological degree program.\n\nBecause of a deeply held conviction that training for ministry needed to combine the study of Christian faith and the world of secular knowledge and action, during President Ozora Davis' tenure in 1900s, CTS moved to the vicinity of the University of Chicago. Under Ozora Davis' leadership the magnificent buildings of the seminary were financed and constructed, and the relationship with the University of Chicago firmly established.\n\nAfter recognizing Florence Fensham with the first American seminary degree awarded to a woman, Chicago Theological Seminary founded the Congregational Training School for Women in 1909 to provide Congregational women with advanced educational training. The school continued its mission until it was subsumed into the Chicago Theological Seminary in 1926. Florence Fensham was the school's first dean, succeeded by Agnes M. Taylor and Margaret M. Taylor after Dean Fensham died unexpectedly in 1912. The Chicago Theological Seminary decided to allow full acceptance of women to its programs in 1926, thereby eliminating the need for a separate institution for women.\n\nIn 1892, CTS invited Graham Taylor, a professor of theology at Hartford Theological Seminary in Connecticut who had shown success in working with the poor, to establish the United States’ first Department of Christian Sociology at CTS. Taylor soon began working closely with leading Chicago activist Jane Addams, founder of Hull House, one of America’s most famous settlement houses. Taylor established the Chicago Commons Settlement house in Chicago’s Fulton Market neighborhood, where with the help of CTS students he brought recreational clubs, classes, a day nursery, and a kindergarten to the working poor. The house had 25 residents and was open to all ethnic groups and religious denominations. Pressed for space, the Chicago Commons moved a few blocks north to the building formerly occupied by the Chicago Congregational Tabernacle, where Taylor expanded the courses offered into the Chicago School of Civics and Philanthropy, which later became the University of Chicago School of Social Service Administration.\n\nIn the 1920s, Anton Boisen, a pioneer in the hospital chaplaincy movement and founder of the Council for the Clinical Training of Theological Students, began lecturing every fall quarter in the social ethics department of CTS. In 1932, he took over the chaplaincy of Elgin State Hospital (now Elgin Mental Health Center) and founded a Chicago arm of the Council for the Clinical Training of Theological Students. His work to help theological students better understand and minister to physically, mentally, and emotionally ill people ultimately led to the founding of the Association for Clinical Pastoral Education. Boisen's ashes are interred in the CTS cloisters.\n\nIn 1957, as the American Civil Rights movement escalated, CTS became the first seminary in the United States to award Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King an Honorary Doctor of Divinity degree in recognition of his activism. Two years later CTS alumnus Howard Schomer, who had received his doctorate of divinity from CTS in 1954, became president of the seminary. Schomer was a conscientious objector and former aide to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights who had assisted in the drafting of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948. A close associate of King, Schomer in March, 1965 led a contingent of CTS students that included scholarship recipient Jesse Jackson, Sr. down to Selma, Alabama, to march with local residents against segregation. Jackson ended up dropping out of the Master of Divinity program just three courses short of degree completion in order to work on the Civil Rights movement full time. He went on to found Operation PUSH (People United to Serve Humanity), a Chicago counterpart to the southern Civil Rights movement that focused on the economic empowerment of African-Americans and poor people of all races, and the Rainbow Coalition, which worked to unite various disenfranchised American groups, from racial minorities to small farmers, in order to exercise political power. CTS ultimately awarded Jackson the Master of Divinity in 2000 in recognition of his life’s work.\n\nAlso during the 1960s, John W. de Gruchy, a white South African theologian who later became known for his work resisting Apartheid, attended CTS.\n\nAdditionally in 1965, CTS launched a Doctorate of Religion program, one of the first professional doctorates in ministry. As standards for the professional doctorate were established by the Association of Theological Schools, the seminary became one of the initial group of six schools to have fully accredited programs of study for the Doctor of Ministry degree.\n\nIn the 1980s, CTS engaged in the anti-Apartheid movement advocating for the divestment of resources from South Africa. In 1986, the seminary awarded Archbishop Desmond Tutu an honorary Doctor of Divinity degree for his transformational activism to liberate black South Africans.\n\nIn 2006, CTS launched the Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Queer (LGBTQ) Religious Studies Center (Queer Center), a grant-funded research program and resource for activists seeking to move toward greater justice and to encourage new conversations. CTS is also home to the Lesbian Gay Bisexual and Transgender Religious Archives Network, and the seminary’s Heyward Boswell Society for LGBTQ people and allies engages students across campus in social activities. CTS also offers an annual Gilberto Castaneda scholarship award for outstanding GLBT students. CTS has graduated some of the nation’s first transgender ministers and has many openly gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender students, staff, and faculty. Several of the seminary’s faculty members have published books and articles regarding religion, sexual orientation, and gender identity. The United Church of Christ Coalition for GLBT Concerns lists Chicago Theological Seminary as an officially \"Open and Affirming\" institution that is especially welcoming to gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, and intersex concerns.\n\nIn 2007, CTS established the Center for the Study of Black Faith and Life (CSBFL), becoming the first denominational seminary to have a center devoted to engaging the larger Black Faith community through inclusivity of a variety of religions. CSBFL sponsors the annual C. Shelby Rooks lecture, which brings outstanding black theologians, ministers, activists, and non-profit leaders to campus.\n\nIn 2009, CTS became the first free-standing Protestant seminary to endow a faculty chair in Jewish studies, with the hope of advancing interfaith engagement and multi-faith education. The next year, CTS founded the Center for Jewish, Christian, and Islamic Studies (JCIS), the first American program of its kind based in a free-standing theological seminary. This center offers resources to students who concentrate in theology, ethics, and human sciences that enable scholars to experientially and theoretically integrate Jewish, Christian, and Muslim theology with these topics. In 2017, CTS established the InterReligious Institute (IRI), which stands counter to the idea that Christianity is the “normal” religious position for Americans and seeks to create space in the public square for people of other religions and for people with no religion at all. IRI does this by providing ongoing events, resources, and training materials for the public.\n\nIn 2019, CTS began a partnership with Bayan Claremont to provide both a graduate certificate and an accredited Master of Divinity in Islamic Chaplaincy at the seminary’s Hyde Park campus.     \n\n\nThe original buildings were designed by Herbert Riddle and built between 1923 and 1928. Riddle was the architect for Mather Tower in the Loop, as well as many buildings in New York. The original CTS building complex included stained glass windows, medieval style groin vaulting, furniture, lighting fixtures, ceramic ornament and tile work, and architectural relics—all of the highest quality of the day.\n\nThe seminary, which was for decades located at 5757 South University Avenue in the Hyde Park neighborhood of Chicago, adjacent to the University of Chicago, during the 2011/2012 academic year moved to 1407 East 60th Street, also in Hyde Park. The building designed by Riddle that had served as a seminary for decades became home to the Department of Economics at the University of Chicago and the Becker Friedman Institute for Research in Economics.\n\nConstruction of the new $30 million CTS facility was a partnership between the University of Chicago and the Chicago Theological Seminary. In May 2008, the University of Chicago Board of Trustees Executive Committee authorized the purchase of two CTS buildings and an adjacent parking lot. Additionally, the University of Chicago agreed to construct a new seminary building at 60th Street and Dorchester Avenue. The seminary's new building, designed by Nagle Hartray Architecture with staunch commitments to environmental sustainability, is located at 1407 E. 60th Street and is LEED Gold-certified and fully ADA accessible. As of 2013, the building project has acquired numerous private and public funds. \n\nThe Robinson & Janet Lapp Learning Commons, centrally located on the third floor of CTS's new building, is a working theological collection of more than 45,000 volumes. The library also subscribes to more than 700 periodicals and runs multiple research database platforms. Special holdings include the Boisen Collection in psychology and personality science, and the Campbell Morgan Collection named for G. Campbell Morgan, containing his sermons, writings, books, newspaper clips, lecture notes, photographs, and other archival materials. The Commons is also home to a number of rare books, including a 1670 first quarto edition of Thomas Hobbes’ \"Leviathan\" published in London by Johannem Tomsoni. The collection is strong in the theological subject areas of Bible, Church history, and theology. Particular fields of note also include African American religion and spirituality, women's studies, LGBT/queer studies, and Jewish and Christian studies.\n\nBesides the Lapp Learning Commons, CTS students also have access to the University of Chicago Library system, the 11th largest library collection in the United States. Through special arrangement, CTS students and faculty can utilize this resource in person.\n\nThe seminary is fully accredited by the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada and by the North Central Association. Further it is one of the 11 seminaries that form the Association of Chicago Theological Schools consortium.\n\nIn addition to being a seminary of the United Church of Christ, it offers students coursework necessary to be ordained by the Metropolitan Community Church.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1852376", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1852376", "title": "Westminster Choir College", "text": "Westminster Choir College\n\nWestminster Choir College is a residential conservatory of music located in Princeton, New Jersey, United States. Westminster Choir College educates students at the undergraduate and graduate levels for musical careers in music education, voice performance, piano performance, organ performance, pedagogy, music theory and composition, conducting, sacred music, and arts management; professional training in musical skills with an emphasis on performance is complemented by studies in the liberal arts. All students study with Westminster's voice faculty, the largest voice faculty in the world. The school's proximity to New York City and Philadelphia provides students with easy access to the musical resources of both cities.\n\nIt is currently a part of Rider University, however, ongoing lawsuits seek to end Westminster's affiliation.\n\nIn 1920 John Finley Williamson founded the Westminster Choir at the Westminster Presbyterian Church of Dayton, Ohio. In 1926, he established the Westminster Choir School. The school started with a faculty of ten, and sixty students. The graduates came to be known as \"Ministers of Music\", a term coined by Williamson and still used today by many church music programs.\nIn 1922, the choir, then known as the Dayton Westminster Choir, began touring the United States annually, singing in Carnegie Hall (New York City), nearby Cincinnati Music Hall (Cincinnati), Symphony Hall (Boston), the Academy of Music (Philadelphia), Orchestra Hall (Chicago) and the White House for President Calvin Coolidge. Years later the Choir also sang for Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Dwight D. Eisenhower. The Choir made its first commercial recording with RCA Victor in 1926; recordings with other major conductors and orchestras followed.\n\nIn 1928, the Choir and the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra conducted by Leopold Stokowski made the nation's first coast-to-coast broadcast on Cincinnati radio station WLW. By a few years later, it made a total of 60 half-hour broadcasts from NBC's New York facilities.\n\nOn March 9, 1929, the Choir performed at the White House for newly inaugurated Herbert Hoover.\n\nThe first European tour took place in 1929 and was sponsored by Dayton philanthropist Katharine Houk Talbott and endorsed by Walter Damrosch, conductor of the New York Symphony Orchestra. The tour included 26 concerts in major cities of Europe.\n\nOriginally a three-year program, the Choir School moved to Ithaca College in New York State in 1929 and enlarged its curriculum to a four-year program culminating in a Bachelor of Music degree. A major reason for the move involved the need to be able to reach the major cities of Chicago, Philadelphia, and New York by rail. All three were cities that sought the choir under Williamson.\n\nIn 1932, the choir school relocated to Princeton, New Jersey, which became its permanent home. Classes were held in the First Presbyterian Church and the Princeton Seminary until 1934 when the school moved to its present campus. This was made possible by a large gift from the philanthropist Sophia Strong Taylor. The dedication of the new campus was marked by a performance of Johann Sebastian Bach's Mass in B minor at the Princeton University Chapel with the Westminster Choir, soloists, and the Philadelphia Orchestra conducted by Leopold Stokowski. The services of the soloists, orchestra, and conductor were a gift from Stokowski.\n\nThere was a second European choir tour in 1934 lasting nine weeks and highlighted by a live radio broadcast from Russia to the United States. In the 14 years since its founding in 1920, the choir already had two European tours which earned it international acclaim and a campus of its own. The State of New Jersey in 1939 granted the choir school accreditation and the name Westminster Choir College was adopted.\n\nIn years to come, under Williamson's leadership, the choir would begin having regular concerts with the New York Philharmonic and the Philadelphia Orchestra. The Westminster Choir sang with the New York Philharmonic for the first time in 1939 conducted by Sir John Barbirolli. Since that time the choir has sung over three hundred performances with the Philharmonic, a record number for a single choir to perform with an orchestra. Later that year the choir sang with the NBC Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Arturo Toscanini. That same year the choir, directed by Williamson, sang at the dedication of the New York World's Fair which was broadcast to 53 countries.\n\nIn 1957, under the auspices of the U.S. State Department Cultural Exchange Program, the choir undertook a five-month world tour, concertizing in 22 countries, covering and appearing before approximately a quarter of a million people.\n\nWilliamson retired as President of Westminster Choir College in 1958. Williamson's retirement consisted of conducting choral clinics and vocal festivals throughout the United States, Japan, Korea and the Philippines. A South American choir tour was being planned by the State Department but was cancelled because of Williamson's sudden death in 1964. In accordance with his request, Williamson's ashes were scattered on his beloved campus on July 3, 1964. This was said to have taken place during the performance of the Verdi Requiem with the Westminster Festival Choir, soloists, and the Festival Orchestra conducted by maestro Eugene Ormandy. This performance on the Westminster campus was part of the Tercentennial Celebration of the State of New Jersey. The following day a memorial service for Williamson was held in the College Chapel.\n\nIn 1976, the choir college celebrated its 50th anniversary, highlighted by a performance of Ludwig van Beethoven's Ninth Symphony with the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra conducted by Robert Shaw, alumni soloists, and the Westminster Alumni Choir on the Princeton University campus. Despite a promising future at the 50th anniversary, Westminster soon began to see its future and prospects for continued existence threatened. Facilities on the campus were in disrepair, and Erdman Hall was ultimately condemned as unfit for use. Recognizing that the college could not continue in this path Westminster was faced with two options, either find a larger university to merge with or close.\n\nSeveral schools, including nearby Princeton University as well as Drew University, Yale University, The Curtis Institute of Music, and The Juilliard School, all had an interest in purchasing Westminster Choir College. The desire of Westminster to remain in its historic campus resulted in an arrangement with the nearby Rider College. In 1992, following a year of affiliation, Rider College merged with Westminster Choir College and the music school became a part of the newly created Rider University. Despite promises that Rider would maintain the Westminster Choir College campus in Princeton, two years later, Rider President J. Barton Luedeke began exploring a move which would relocate the choir college campus to Lawrenceville, New Jersey, to be with the rest of Rider University. By 1996, the choir college appeared to have a vibrant fiscal future in Princeton, operating in the black, thanks to increased enrollment and donations. One year later Erdman Hall was renovated, restored, and reopened as the Presser Music Center at Erdman Hall, featuring teaching studios, a keyboard laboratory, voice library and resource center, and new classroom space.\n\nDespite the optimistic future in the 1990s, by the early 2000s Rider University determined Westminster Choir College either must create an even stronger fiscal future or face closure. Looking for a way to control costs and more effectively create synergies between the two campuses of Rider University (Westminster's and the main campus), in November 2007, Rider University President Rozanski announced the creation of the Westminster College of the Arts. Westminster College of the Arts was envisioned to integrate Rider and Westminster more successfully, and create a new culture and environment of artistic excellence on both campuses. Westminster Choir College continues to educate Westminster College of the Arts students in the fields of piano, composition, voice, organ, choral conducting, sacred music, and music education. The newly formed School of Fine and Performing Arts serves as the gateway to receiving a degree in musical theatre, arts administration, and music, as well as a non-professional degree (B.A. in Fine Arts) in music, dance, and theater. The creation of Westminster College of the Arts sparked heated debate among administrators, students, alumni and faculty that highlighted the divide between Rider's Princeton and Lawrenceville campuses.\n\nWestminster recently formed the Princeton University Program with nearby Princeton University. By reciprocal arrangement, Westminster students, except freshmen, may petition to take courses at Princeton. Generally, no cost is involved beyond tuition charges at Westminster. Students are limited to one course per term, to fall or spring enrollment and to courses not offered by Westminster. The program is limited to 10 students per semester, selection and approval being made by academic deans at both institutions. In return, ten select students of Princeton University study and take courses at Westminster each semester.\n\nIn 2005 the school unveiled an ambitious master plan calling for a new building and other upgrades, the first to be created on the campus since the college was placed under Rider University's stewardship. The choir college also entered a cooperative agreement with the Princeton Regional Schools which allows for up to 40 Westminster performances a year to occur in their newly created Regional Performing Arts Center, alleviating Westminster's struggle from having no dedicated, large performance space on the campus.\n\nThe lack of a large concert venue was solved in 2013 when the State of New Jersey allotted $4.6 million to Rider University to be spent on new academic facilities for Westminster's campus. Combined with donations from various friends, alumni, and admirers of the conservatory, the funds spent on this project far exceeded $5 million. Opened in 2014, the complex is named the Marion Buckelew Cullen Center in honor of the philanthropist who died in July and made a $5 million bequest to Westminster Choir College. The new building contains a 3,000-square-foot performance and rehearsal hall named the Hillman Performance Hall, in recognition of the Henry L. Hillman Foundation, which provided a $3 million grant to support the project. In addition to the performance/rehearsal hall, the Cullen Center includes a large lobby, a green room and three flexibly configured classrooms that accommodate a wide range of academic and choral uses. The Cullen Center also includes an integrated connection to The Playhouse that provides improved audience access and amenities. To maximize the opportunities the project offers for enhancing The Playhouse itself, the college secured $1.5 million to upgrade this building that has played such an important role in Westminster's history. Ground was broken for the project in the summer of 2013 and the Cullen Center was completed by spring 2015.\n\nOn March 28, 2017, after months of speculation following an announcement by Rider that they were considering moving the Westminster students to the Lawrenceville campus and selling the Princeton campus due to purported financial problems, it was decided by the Board of Trustees that Rider would, instead, attempt to sell WCC to a new affiliate partner. A timeline of 12 months was established with hopes that a buyer would be found in the upcoming year.\n\nFearing that Westminster could be made to shutter its doors and cease its mission, a large ensemble of students, alumni, faculty, community members, and others gathered at the Lawrenceville campus for a silent protest on the morning of the vote. They sang the school's \"alma mater\" – \"The Lord Bless You and Keep You\" by Peter Lutkin – numerous times, hoping to convince the trustees not to silence the college, which has made an international impact on the choral world.\n\nOn February 26, 2018, Rider announced its intention to sell Westminster to a former steel and bridge manufacturing firm. This created widespread speculation that it was Gregory G. Dell'Omo's intention to scuttle the college from the beginning. This was also reported in a March 2018 Bloomberg Business News article which said that Beijing Kaiwen Education Technology Co. (formerly called Jiangsu Zhongtai Bridge Steel Structure Co.) had agreed to pay $40 million for the college. The sale subsequently faced opposition from state politicians on grounds of national security and lawsuits from Westminster alumni and donors and the Princeton Theological Seminary alleging, among other things, violation of IRS regulations. Other concerns addressed the sale of an American institution of higher learning to a for-profit and non-American company with poor financial ratings and extensive ties to the communist Chinese government.\n\nOn July 1, 2019, it was announced that Beijing Kaiwen was withdrawing from the proposed purchase. This was followed by news that Rider would relocate Westminster's programs to the Rider campus in September 2020 and monetize the sale of Westminster's Princeton campus for the benefit of Rider's debt. At Rider University's convocation exercises on August 29, 2019, Dell'Omo announced that the relocation of Westminster and the sale of Westminster's Princeton campus would directly benefit Rider University's ongoing campus investments. Litigation has since expanded with an additional lawsuit by plaintiffs representing Westminster students, alumni, and faculty, seeking to prevent the closure of the Princeton campus and the transfer of Westminster programs to a currently non-extant facility on Rider's campus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Westminster Symphonic Choir has performed with many major orchestras and conductors including: New York Philharmonic, Philadelphia Orchestra, National Symphony Orchestra, NBC Symphony Orchestra, Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, Boston Symphony Orchestra, Cleveland Orchestra, Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, San Francisco Symphony Orchestra, New Jersey Symphony Orchestra, Chicago Symphony Orchestra, and Los Angeles Philharmonic. The Symphonic Choir, under the direction of Westminster's Director of Choral Activities, has sung at individual performances of large orchestral/choral works with professional orchestras conducted by Claudio Abbado, Daniel Barenboim, Leonard Bernstein, Herbert von Karajan, Eugene Ormandy, William Steinberg, Leopold Stokowski, Charles Dutoit, Neville Marriner, Nicholas McGegan, Arturo Toscanini, and Bruno Walter, and such contemporary figures as Pierre Boulez, Mariss Jansons, Erich Leinsdorf, James Levine, Zdeněk Mácal, Kurt Masur, Lorin Maazel, Michael Tilson Thomas, Riccardo Muti, Claudio Abbado, Seiji Ozawa, Wolfgang Sawallisch, Robert Shaw, Zubin Mehta, Albert Wolff, and Rafael Frühbeck de Burgos. The choir has also received numerous invitations over the years to sing with such touring orchestras as the Berlin Philharmonic, the Berlin State Opera Orchestra, the Dresden Philharmonic Orchestra, the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, the Korean Broadcasting Symphony Orchestra, the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, and the Vienna Philharmonic when these orchestras have come to perform in New York City and Philadelphia.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The title, \"Il Mare\", means \"The Sea\" in Italian, and is the name of the seaside house which is the setting of the story. The two protagonists both live there two years apart in time, but are able to communicate through a mysterious mailbox.\n\nThe film was remade by Warner Brothers in 2006 as \"The Lake House\" starring Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock.\n\nThe plot of the movie was also used in the 2015 Kannada movie \"Minchagi Nee Baralu\".\n\nThere are two distinct time-lines intertwined throughout most of the film.\n\nThe story begins with Eun-joo moving out of a house by the sea called \"Il Mare\". As she is leaving, she leaves a Christmas card in the mailbox, asking the next resident to please forward her mail to her. Sung-hyun, an architectural student, receives her card, but is puzzled, since he is the first resident at \"Il Mare\" and the card is dated 2 years in the future. After a series of back and forth correspondences, Eun-joo and Sung-hyun realize they are living 2 years apart, Eun-joo in the year 1999 and Sung-hyun in the year 1997. After some testing, Eun-joo and Sung-hyun discover that the mailbox at \"Il Mare\" is enabling their communication and they can pass objects and living creatures through.\n\nUtilizing the mailbox, Eun-joo asks Sung-hyun to retrieve a tape player she lost two years ago, which he gets for her. After his estranged father, a noted architect, falls ill, Sung-hyun asks Eun-joo to obtain a book about his father, which she does. However, she succumbs to a minor traffic accident and while hospitalized, the book fails to reach Sung-hyun in time before his father's death. After reading the book, he finally accepts his father's love for him and takes up his architectural work once more.\n\nAs both Eun-joo and Sung-hyun continue their correspondence, they decide to try a date together, with each person participating in his or her own time. Eun-joo \"takes\" Sung-hyun to an amusement park, where he follows her instructions on how to have a good time at the park. Sung-hyun \"takes\" her to a restaurant where she drinks a bottle of wine he left for her two years prior. Despite having a lot of fun on these solo \"dates\", they decide that they should try to meet in person.\n\nEun-joo and Sung-hyun plan on meeting in person at a beach two years in Sung-hyun's future. However, when Eun-joo goes to the beach, Sung-hyun doesn't show. She does see a house being built on the beach for an unknown architect's lover. When Eun-joo tells Sung-hyun that he didn't come, he is baffled about why he didn't show up; he doesn't think he would have forgotten such an important date. Although Sung-Hyun doesn’t meet Eun-joo at the agreed upon date, he still makes a trip out to the beach they agreed to meet. He is moved by the beauty of the beach and decides to design a house for her on the very beach. Sung-hyun may have wanted to show Eun-Joo his love for her, and even though somehow not being able to meet her on the future date, the designed house will show her that he is there at the beach.\n\nAt Eun-joo's workplace, she runs into her ex-fiance. They were going to get married, but he moved abroad for work, while she stayed in Korea. Due to the separation, they eventually broke up and he married another person; Eun-joo however still loves him. This meeting was a shock to Eun-joo and in an act of desperation, she asks Sung-hyun to intervene and stop her fiance from leaving two years in the past.\n\nSung-Hyun after receiving the letter to intervene between Eun-joo and her fiancé from separating, is heart-broken. Sung-Hyun is torn between his love for Eun-joo, and Eun-Joo’s request to help her not to lose her previous lover. After some long hard contemplation, Sung-Hyun against his own hearts desires, agrees to help her. Helping Eun-joo’s request would be like tearing out his own heart, very similar to this quote from Javan, \"When you truly know the meaning of the word love, you will also know the meaning of the word pain.\" Sung-hyun writes back wishing Eun-joo good luck to her and her fiancé in the future.\n\nAfter receiving the heart-felt reply from Sung-hyun to help, Eun-joo decides to visit his architectural school. Eun-joo may have hoped to meet him in person and thank him somehow. She finds the architectural department and is greeted by a friend of Sung-Hyun. Eun-joo asked for Sung-Hyun, but was told of a tragic accident. Sung-Hyun was to meet a friend of his, but was involved in a fatal traffic accident 2 years ago. Eun-joo suddenly realizes, on the day, she last met her fiancé before they separated, she also witnessed a car striking a pedestrian and killing him. Sung-hyun was that very pedestrian and the house being built at the beach was designed by Sung-hyun for her. She immediately rushes to the mailbox and sends a letter begging him not to go, also in hope that the message is received in time.\n\nThe final scene returns to the beginning of the movie, where Eun-joo is about to place her Christmas card into the mailbox at \"Il Mare\". A stranger approaches her with a letter in his hand, the letter that Eun-joo sent warning Sung-hyun not to go to the meeting. Sung-hyun did receive her warning letter and never went to intervene that day and was never hit by the car. Eun-joo and Sung-hyun finally meet.\n\n\nThe setting for the movie was shot on Ganghwa Island's Sukmodo, and Jeju Island's Udo.\n\nThis time-travel romance was not a popular success in 2000, selling less than a quarter million tickets in Seoul (upstaged by not only the similar-themed \"Ditto\", but also the controversial \"Lies\"), but since then it has developed a loyal fan base a la \"Somewhere in Time\" and attained the status of a minor classic among Korean cinema fans.\n\nWarner Brothers acquired the rights for an American remake, titled \"The Lake House\", starring Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock. It was released on June 16, 2006 and was co-produced by Sonny Mallhi, Amit Walia, and Chris Krapek. To reference the original movie, \"Il Mare\" was used as the restaurant's name where Kate and Alex are supposed to meet.\n\n"}

The film was adapted from the 1997 television series \"Bayside Shakedown\".\n\nThe film continues a few months after the end of the TV series. The main character Detective Sergeant Shunsaku Aoshima has worked his way back up into the investigative division of the Wangan Precinct of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, after being demoted back to patrol duty for insubordination.\n\nShortly after the movie begins, a body is found floating in a river near the edge of the precinct's jurisdiction. However, in the spirit of the series, the main concern of the officers on the scene is getting to the body before their counterparts from the other precinct on the other side of the river get to it. The scene eventually degenerates into a cross-river shouting match over bullhorns between the officers from the two precincts. The brass at Wangan Station turn out to be less than happy when their officers manage to recover the body (which has had a teddy bear crudely stuffed into its stomach) as it would require a special investigation, which would drain more from the station's already tight budget. At the same time, the station is in an uproar as officers find that someone has been stealing the receipts for on the job expenses that they had originally intended to file for reimbursement.\n\nThings are further complicated when the Assistant Commissioner is kidnapped and the investigative team from Metropolitan Police headquarters moves into Wangan Station. The investigation is led by Superintendent Shinji Muroi, whom Aoshima befriended in the TV series. Having promised Aoshima that he would try to reform the bureaucratic mess within the police department and force the local and headquarters officers to work together as equals, Muroi finds that his promise increasingly hard to keep as his decisions are continuously overruled from above by superiors who insist on playing everything by the book. It becomes apparent that Muroi's superiors are setting him up to take the fall in the event the investigation fails.\n\nThe stratification in the department becomes apparent when the investigators from headquarters immediately delegate the most menial of tasks to the local officers, while receiving special treatment enjoying gourmet bentos while the locals are forced to dine on instant ramen. The locals are forced to work multiple cases at the same time, and find themselves berated by their superiors when mistakes are inevitably made.\n\nThe film goes on to take on issues such as disaffected youth unable to differentiate between reality and video games, overprotective parents, strange internet subcultures; and on more lighthearted notes, the lack of sidearms, otaku obsessed with cosplay, media frenzies, and even overtly melodramatic movie scenes, as Aoshima and his fellow officers continue to press on through the absurdity.\n\n\n\"Odoru daisosasen - The Movie\" was released in Japan on 31 October 1998 with a 119 minute running time by Toho.

{"id": "1852394", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1852394", "title": "Fabius Planciades Fulgentius", "text": "Fabius Planciades Fulgentius\n\nFabius Planciades Fulgentius () was a Latin writer of late antiquity. Four extant works are commonly attributed to him, as well as a possible fifth which some scholars include in compilations with much reservation. His mythography was greatly admired and highly influential throughout much of the medieval period, but it is viewed with little favour today.\n\nVery little is known about the life of Fulgentius other than the few references he makes to himself in his own works. His style of Latin,his knowledge of Greek, and his view on classical authors and cults suggests that he was probably educated in North Africa. Other references to African culture in his work support placing him in this region before the Muslim invasions of the 7th century. Moreover, his apparent knowledge of the Libyco-Berber language and script indicates that he was probably an ethnic African: he refers to the language in his \"On the Ages of the World and of Man\" as being part of his 'own' heritage. Traditionally, Fulgentius is thought to have had a professional career as a \"grammaticus\" or \"rhetor\" (teacher of rhetoric). However, this belief is based on small incidental clues Fulgentius leaves behind in work and has been contested by some scholars. It remains possible that he was an amateur writer: in his prologue to Book 1 of the \"Mythologies\", Fulgentius mentions a wife, though it is unclear whether this is a genuine autobiographical detail or part of his fictional persona in the story.\n\nThere is a continuing debate as to whether or not Fabius Planciades Fulgentius, and a contemporary, Saint Fulgentius of Ruspe (a Christian bishop) were the same person. The identification of the two Fulgentii was first made by medieval scholars and scribes as far back as the Carolingian period.\n\nThere is some overlap in the influences of the two authors (as could be expected from writers working in the same time period and location), such as a common interest in thinkers like Augustine of Hippo. However, the primary focus and concern of each writer seems to set them apart. For example, most of the works attributed to Fulgentius the bishop deal with his opposition to heretical factions such as Arianism, a topic for which Fabius Fulgentius seems to have no concern. Topics on which the bishop seemed to have been strongly opinionated (Arianism, free-will, etc.) are never discussed in the mythographer's work, even when a discussion of such things would seem to fit his discussion. From a linguistic standpoint, the mythographer's unique style and inclusion of otherwise unused words and idioms is not replicated in the work of the bishop, which suggests further a negative identification.\n\nIt has been suggested that Fabius Fulgentius, who is traditionally thought to have been writing in the late 5th and early 6th centuries may have borrowed a line from Corippus's Iohannis in his \"Mythologies\", which indicates that he was writing after 550. This discovery has called into serious doubt the possibility of identifying the bishop and the mythographer, as Saint Fulgentius of Ruspe is known to have died in 533.\n\nWhile the identification debate has not yet been settled, the case to identify the two authors appears to rest on weak evidence. Most of the evidence is based on linguistic comparisons as well as biographical details of marginal relevance. Although the tradition of conflating the two writers is an old one, it most likely originated as a result of Carolingian scribal error.\n\nThe four extant works attributed to Fulgentius include (listed in what is believed to be chronological order):\n\nA fifth work, which in the past has been attributed to Fulgentius is the \"Super Thebaiden\" (On the Thebaid). The manuscript ascribes the work to \"S. Fulgencius Episcopus\", whom Rudolf Helm (the first modern publisher of Fulgentius' work) considered to be the mythographer. This work was not included in the Carolingian manuscripts (possibly because it did not exist at this time), but was included in Helm's 1897 edition of the works of Fulgentius with strong reservations. While there is no consensus on the authenticity of the treatise, there is strong evidence to support the fact that the work was written in the twelfth century by a writer imitating the allegorical style of Fulgentius. This is not to say that the work was a forgery, but more likely that it was mistakenly attributed to Fulgentius as a result of scribal error.\n\nIn addition to these, Fulgentius mentions other works that have not survived to the present. In the first prologue to the \"Mythologies\" he mentions earlier satirical poems, and in the \"Content of Virgil\" he makes reference to his work on physiology.\n\nGenerally known as his chief work, the \"Mythologies\" (Latin: \"Mitologiarum libri III\") is a series of legends told in three books. Each book is introduced by its own prologue. There are a total of fifty chapters: each chapter explains a classical myth and interprets that myth using allegory. These interpretations include etymologies of the names of certain characters, as well as conclusions as to the purpose of the story in terms of morality. In the prologue, Fulgentius claims that his purpose was to strip the classic Greek myths of all their fictitious and meaningless details in order to reveal the obscure truths they contain. He also suggests a Christian motive, though it would be inaccurate to define the \"Mythologies\" or any of Fulgentius' allegorical works as 'Christian allegories'.\n\nFulgentius's etymologies (while typical of his age) have been recently criticized as being extravagant, arbitrary, and often incorrect. While few have had anything positive to say about such etymological methods within the last two hundred years, the tradition dates back to the work of Plato and was common practice for such philosophic traditions as the Stoics and Neoplatonists. His use of such arbitrary etymologies to substantiate his allegorical claims is typical of his relentless tendency to stretch interpretations and search for truths that are not readily evident.\n\nSeveral manuscripts of the \"Mythologies\" are addressed to an unidentified Catus, Presbyter of Carthage.\n\nIn this exposition (original title: \"Expositio Virgilianae continentiae secundum philosophos moralis\"), Virgil and the Muses are summoned to explain the truth of his \"Aeneid\". This text is similar to Fulgentius's interpretations of classical myths in the \"Mythologies\" . The shade of Virgil assumes a sage-like status, and he addresses the author in a pretentious and condescending way, often calling him a \"\"homunculus\"\", or 'boy'.\n\nWhile Fulgentius claims to explain the \"Aeneid\" as an allegory for the full range of human life, the work seems to end rather abruptly, and the telling only goes as far as manhood. There is no evidence to suggest, however, that any part of the original text was lost. His hurried finish was probably caused by a loss of interest in its completion.\n\nBy the time of the \"Content of Virgil\"'s writing, the tradition of allegorizing Virgil was not new. Aelius Donatus had already completed an allegorical exposition of passages of the \"Aeneid\" which closely resembles Fulgentius's ideas, indicating that they were probably not unique to Fulgentius. Furthermore, Fulgentius appears to have taken the idea of Virgil as a sage from the earlier writer Macrobius. However, it seems Fulgentius was original in his attempt to systematically interpret the entire \"Aeneid\". He also seems to be the first to attempt to explain the text in a way at least partly acceptable to Christian readers.\n\nThis text (original title: \"Expositio sermonum antiquorum\"), addressed to a person named Calcidium in some manuscripts, is an explanation of 62 antique Latin words that may be found in Roman literature. In his Prologue to the work, Fulgentius states that he compiled the list of words in order to fulfill the commissions assigned by his master (who remains unidentified). His stated aim is to make clear the meaning of these words, not to revive them. However, beginning in the Carolingian period, writers did in fact make use of these rarities, using this text as their source.\n\nWith nearly every explanation, Fulgentius provides the reader with a small quotation as an example of the word's practical use, often citing the work it was taken from. However, many of these quotes are likely to be faked. Some works may be entirely made-up, while others have been liberally edited by Fulgentius. As was common with writers of this period, Fulgentius does not cite his immediate sources, perhaps in an attempt to obscure the fact that he had access to very few to draw from. The entire work was probably an attempt to improve his reputation as a scholar in hopes the reader would not take a critical look into his methods.\n\nThis compendium of biblical and classical history (original title: \"De aetatibus mundi et hominis libri XXIII\") is told in fourteen books, each lacking a particular letter of the alphabet ('A' in book i, 'B' in book ii., etc.). The deliberate omission of each letter means that Fulgentius cannot use any word containing that letter for the entirety of that section. However, he varies this avoidance of words with his second technique of swapping omitted letters for other arbitrarily selected letters. These techniques obscure his language, making it very difficult for the reader to understand his meaning. Just as in the \"Content of Virgil\", Fulgentius claims the work was completed as a result of the request of his unnamed patron.\n\nThe increasingly rapid rate of historical retelling that occurs near the end of the work raises the question of whether the work was completed. Some manuscripts include in their prologues an introduction of the text as running 'from a to z', and others end book fourteen with the statement, \"Here begins the fifteenth book, lacking P\". However, book thirteen includes a line about ending the series with a history of the Roman emperors. It is possible that the last books have been lost over time, though it is also likely that Fulgentius simply lost interest in the work and gave it a hurried anticlimactic finish, as he did with other works such as the \"Content of Virgil\".\n\nThroughout his retelling of history, Fulgentius adds moral interpretations of events. He goes to great lengths to justify God's ways, and, consistent with his past works, stretches allegories to fit his ethical interpretations.\n\nUnlike Fulgentius' other works, \"Ages of the World\" did not seem to attract much attention or admiration in the medieval period, probably due to its confusing literary techniques and style.\n\nThere has been some doubt as to whether or not this work was actually that of Fabius Fulgentius, though similarities in language and writing style convincingly demonstrate the attribution of this work to the same author as the first three. \nAmong the arguments for a different author is an argument in favor of attributing this work to the bishop Fulgentius. This theory is based on the fact that the manuscripts of the \"Ages of the World\" attribute the work to \"Fabius Claudius Gordianus Fulgentius\" (Claudius and Gordianus both being names known to belong to members of the bishop's immediate family). However, the inclusion of these names in manuscripts was most likely the mistake of some eight or ninth century scribe who assumed 'Fulgentius' to be the well-known theologian. It is also possible that Fabius Fulgentius had multiple names (very popular for aristocrats of the time) which included Claudius and Gordianus.\n\nFulgentius's work demonstrates a clear continuation of the antique Roman compendium tradition. This concise encyclopaedic style of compiling information was common for Roman writers like Cato the Elder and Cicero. His work is also consistent with the Stoic and Neoplatonic traditions which interpreted myth as a representation of deeper spiritual processes. His allegorical approach to mythography may have originated in the no-longer-extant Virgil commentary of Aelius Donatus, and it was certainly evident in the later moralising Virgil commentaries of Servius. Fulgentius's treatment of Virgil as a sage seems to have been borrowed from the encyclopaedic work of Macrobius, the first to elevate the Roman poet to such an authoritative status. However, Fulgentiuss' tendency to strip classical myth of all its manifest detail and replace it with ethical interpretations appears to have more in common with the late 5th-century writer Martianus Capella. Capella's work brought the theme of life as a spiritual journey to the forefront of Classical literature, a trend which Fulgentius seemed to carry a step further.\n\nThe Tradition of invoking the aid of questionable etymologies in order to support mythological allegories dates back to Plato, and carried on through Aristotle, the Stoics, and into the Middle Ages. Though Fulgentius was later criticized for such methods, they were not uncommon for writers of the time period (including Martianus Capella).\nFulgentius's summaries of classical myths have traditionally been compared to his predecessor, Hyginus the mythographer, of the 2nd century AD. While both deal with many of the same legends, and some commonalities between their summaries suggests a common source, their work differs greatly in purpose and interest. Hyginus appears to have been dedicated to producing a comprehensive reference book for the myths, while Fulgentius was more concerned with allegorically dissecting the material, something Hyginus rarely attempts.\n\nFulgentius's work is said to mark the transition from late-antique to Medieval literary study. After a period of decreased interest in the literature, the practice of mythography was picked up again in what is thought to be the 7th century by the so-called Vatican Mythographers. All three writers borrow Fulgentius's methods in order to search the classical myths for obscured meaning. However, it was during the Carolingian period, from the 8th through to the 10th centuries, that Fulgentius's work reached the height of its popularity. He came to be admired as one of the founding fathers of mythographic writing, and he was praised for uniting classical pagan literature and Christian teachings. This admiration led to the emergence of Fulgentian scholarship. The practice of differentiating between the author's intention and the deeper meaning of a piece of literature—carried to the extreme by Fulgentius—provided the framework for the commentaries of this period. The \"Mythologies\" in particular proved to be an essential storehouse of resources for the Medieval commentators who carried on his tradition of discussing classical poetry in moral terms. Further, his exotic language and use of rare words seemed to influence the writing style of a number of poets throughout the Middle Ages.\n\nFulgentius's manuscripts date as far back as the early 8th century. As a testament to his popularity, a copy of the \"Mythologies\" may have been available in England as early as the 9th century. Fulgentius remained a standard part of collections of antique mythology up until the 19th century, when his work began to come under popular criticism as being absurd and factually unreliable.\n\nIt has been suggested that Fulgentius' work, which is thought to have been commonly known throughout most of the Middle Ages, may have been a source for the structure of the famous 7th- or 8th-century epic \"Beowulf\".\n\nWhile Fulgentius's works remained popular during and well after the Carolingian period, his factual inaccuracies and questionable interpretations came under harsh criticism in the 19th century. His work has been overwhelmingly dismissed as trivial and misleading ever since.\nHistorically, Fulgentius's work has been criticized as being bombastic and foolish. His Latin prose is obscure and often corrupt, making it difficult to decipher his meaning. He is known for unnecessarily long and wordy prose and highly obscure allusions.\n\nFulgentius is also known to make significant mistakes in his retelling of history, like his conflation of Augustus with Julius Caesar in \"On the Ages of the World and of Man\". In addition, many of his facts, as well as his etymologies, are suspected of being based on second-hand sources or completely fabricated.\n\n\n\n"}

In the intelligence sector, Kennedy served as Deputy Director of National Intelligence for Management. Kennedy then returned to the State Department as the Under Secretary of State for Management, serving during three presidential administrations.\n\nIn 2007, Patrick F. Kennedy chaired an investigation into the behavior of Blackwater Worldwide, following the Nisour Square shooting.\n\nDuring the 2008 presidential election, Kennedy ordered that State Department employees in Europe be barred from attending Senator Barack Obama's speech in Berlin on July 24, 2008, to ensure they displayed political neutrality. Kennedy labeled Obama's visit as a partisan political activity.\n\nKennedy's role in diplomatic security decisions has come under scrutiny from politicians since the terrorist attacks on the U.S. Mission in Benghazi in 2012. Kennedy testified to the House Oversight Committee on October 10, 2012, about the death of Chris Stevens. He testified that, after the October 2011 fall of Gaddafi, the government of Libya was in flux, and that Stevens first arrived in Benghazi \"during the height of the revolution\", which occurred between February 17 and October 23, 2011, \"when the city was the heart of the opposition to Colonel Qadhafi and the rebels there were fighting for their lives.\" At that time he was Special Representative to the National Transitional Council. Stevens returned to Libya as ambassador in June 2012, and was killed on September 11 of that year.\n\nThe Republican minority on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence alleged that Kennedy, as Under Secretary for Management, failed to approve requests for additional security in Benghazi and Tripoli, and failed to implement recommendations regarding high-risk diplomatic posts that had been issued after the bombings of embassies in 1998.\n\nOn June 10, 2013, CBS News reported that a memo from an official in the State Department inspector general's office alleged that the then-current ambassador to Belgium, Howard Gutman, was ditching his security detail to engage prostitutes and underage children\n, and further alleged that Patrick F. Kennedy had killed the original investigation in order to protect Ambassador Gutman and maybe others. On June 11, 2013, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney confirmed that the allegation regarding Kennedy was under active investigation by an independent inspector general. In October 2014, Gutman was cleared by the investigation and the State Department issued an apology for the allegations.\n\nOn October 17, 2016, the FBI released interviews related to the Hillary Clinton email investigation. One of the interviews alleges that Patrick F. Kennedy \"pressured\" the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to declassify an email from Hillary Clinton's private server in exchange for a \"quid pro quo\" of placing more agents in certain countries. The FBI stated that the email's classification status was re-reviewed and remained unchanged and denied quid pro quo accusations. The State Department called the allegations \"inaccurate\" and maintained that Kennedy was trying to \"understand\" the FBI's classification process.\n\nOn January 26, 2017, when Rex Tillerson, Donald Trump's nominee for United States Secretary of State, visited the United States State Department, Kennedy, Joyce Anne Barr, Michele Bond, and Gentry O.

{"id": "1852432", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1852432", "title": "Bastard feudalism", "text": "Bastard feudalism\n\n\"Bastard feudalism\" is a somewhat controversial term invented by 19th century historians to characterize the form feudalism took in the Late Middle Ages, primarily in England in the Late Middle Ages. Its distinctive feature is that middle-ranking figures rendered military, political, legal, or domestic service in return for money, office, or influence. As a result, the gentry began to think of themselves as the men of their lord rather than of the king. Individually, they are known as retainers, and collectively as the \"affinity\" of the lord, among other terms.\n\nThe historian Charles Plummer coined the term \"bastard feudalism\" in 1885. Plummer blamed bastard feudalism for the disorder and instability of the Wars of the Roses in the fifteenth century. However, \"bastard feudalism\" as a concept is primarily associated with Plummer's contemporary William Stubbs (1825–1901). \n\nAccording to Stubbs, a shift in English history took place under Edward I (reigned 1272–1307) when the feudal levy was replaced with royal payment in return for military service by the great magnates who willingly served the king. Thus, instead of vassals rendering military service when required by the lord, they paid a portion of their income into the lord's treasury. In turn the lord would supplement the owed military service with hired retainers, a sort of private army in full-time service to the lord.\n\nIn the 1940s K. B. McFarlane presented a strong challenge to the ideas of Stubbs. McFarlane stripped the term \"bastard feudalism\" of any negative connotation. To him, bastard feudalism centred not on the financial aspect (the sums involved were mostly negligible) but on the concept of service in exchange for good favour. In a society governed on a personal basis, service to a lord was the best way to obtain favour in the form of offices, grants, etc. Lords would retain administrators and lawyers, as well as recruiting local gentry into their affinities. By offering money instead of land, lords could afford to retain more followers.\n\nIn return for becoming retainers, the gentry would expect to rely on their lord's influence in local and national politics. This practice was known as \"maintenance\". The retainer might wear his lord's livery badge or the grander form, a livery collar, which could be very useful in a courtroom. Under a weak king, such as Henry VI (reigned 1422–1461 and 1470–1471), the rivalries of magnates might spill over from the courtroom to armed confrontations, thereby perverting justice.\n\nBecause they were rarely kept under arms for long periods, noble retinues were not private armies. Lacking standing armies, kings relied on noble retinues for the military forces they required to conduct wars or to crush internal rebellions. Under an inadequate king like Henry VI, ambitious or disaffected magnates such as Richard Duke of York (1411–1460) or Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick (1428–1471) could use their network of servants and retainers to defy or even control the crown. Groups of gentry, already coming to blows over local issues, inevitably attached themselves to different patrons. Their private feuds continued under their leaders' banners and transferred to the battlefields of the Wars of the Roses.\n\nAlthough Edward IV (reigned 1461–1483) attempted to limit \"retaining\", he generally did not succeed. However, Henry VII (reigned 1485–1509) managed to largely overcome bastard feudalism by imposing financial sanctions on unruly nobles. Furthermore, Henry passed a statute in 1504 that only allowed the King to have retainers – nobles had to apply and pay for a licence. Overall, bastard feudalism had vanished by the early seventeenth century.\n\n"}

The Mavericks were founded in 1989 in Miami, Florida. Between 1991 and 2003, the band recorded six studio albums, in addition to charting 14 singles on the \"Billboard\" country charts. Their highest-peaking American single was 1996's \"All You Ever Do Is Bring Me Down\", a collaboration with accordionist Flaco Jiménez. They are best known in the UK for their 1998 single \"Dance the Night Away\", which spent 18 weeks on the chart, peaking at number 4. In 1996, The Mavericks won a Grammy Award for the song \"Here Comes the Rain\".\n\nThe band split up in 2000, reuniting in 2003–2004 before splitting up again. During the period 2001–2011, lead singer Raul Malo released six solo albums. Bass player Robert Reynolds and keyboardist Jerry Dale McFadden co-founded the 'supergroup' SWAG, along with Ken Coomer of Wilco, Tom Petersson of Cheap Trick, and Doug Powell. \n\nIn 2012, the band announced plans for several reunion festival dates. Shortly after, they were offered a record deal by Big Machine Records. Their reunion album \"In Time,\" was released in February 2013. Since then, the group has recorded and toured regularly. \n\nThe Mavericks began their career within the punk and alternative music scene in Miami, Florida, frequently playing on the same bill as emerging acts including Marilyn Manson. The band initially consisted of singer Raul Malo, guitarist Ben Peeler, bassist Robert Reynolds; and drummer Paul Deakin. This line-up issued an independent self-titled LP before Peeler was replaced by David Lee Holt.\n\nIn 1991, the band was signed by MCA Nashville, and their first major label release, \"From Hell to Paradise,\" debuted in 1992. Holt subsequently left the band, and The Mavericks recorded their follow-up \"What a Crying Shame\" as a trio, augmented by session musicians. Nick Kane (lead guitar) appears as the group's fourth member on the album cover, and is credited as a full member of the band in the liner notes, but joined The Mavericks after the album was recorded and does not play on this record. \n\n\"What A Crying Shame\" produced four top 40 country hits: the title track, \"O What a Thrill\", \"There Goes My Heart\" and \"I Should Have Been True\". A fifth single, a cover of Bruce Springsteen's \"All That Heaven Will Allow\", peaked at number 49.\n\nin February 1994, piano player Jerry Dale McFadden joined the band as an auxiliary player and \"fifth Maverick\", though he was not at this point an official full member. He would contribute to all live shows and studio recordings from this point forward, beginning with 1995's \"Music for All Occasions\". This album included the single \"Here Comes the Rain\", which won the band a Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal the following year. Its follow-up was \"All You Ever Do Is Bring Me Down\", their highest country chart peak at number 13.\n\nDuring 1996 and 1997, the band embarked on the \"Tour for All Occasions\" and released a live album, \"It's Now! It's Live!\".\n\nTheir 1998 album \"Trampoline\" produced a number 4 UK hit in \"Dance the Night Away\" – remaining on the UK charts for over ten weeks and becoming one of the most recognizable songs for the Mavericks in the UK. \"I've Got This Feeling\" and \"Someone Should Tell Her\" also made the UK charts. However, the album was not anywhere near as successful in the US, charting much lower than previous Mavericks album releases and failing to spin off any top 40 country singles.\n\nIn 1999, the band issued a \"best-of\" album featuring three new tracks, called \"\". The album was quickly reissued the following year with two additional new tracks. However, the release did not spin off any top 40 hit singles in either the US or the UK, and the band found itself in a financially precarious situation. In February 2000 the band suspended payments to all their salaried employees, and in May they fired guitarist Nick Kane. Malo embarked on a solo career at this time, and the group effectively dissolved for the next few years.\n\nIn 2003, the Mavericks were revived, with Eddie Perez added to the line-up in Kane's place. The band recorded a new album \"The Mavericks\", but split up again shortly after the 2004 tour ended.\n\nIn October 2011, The Mavericks announced plans to reunite for a tour in 2012. \n\nIn February 2012, the group signed with Valory Music Co., an imprint of Big Machine Records. They released a digital extended play titled \"Suited Up and Ready\", and charted in early 2012 with \"Born to Be Blue\". The full-length album, \"In Time,\" was released on Valory Records on 26 February 2013. \n\nFounding member Robert Reynolds was dismissed from the band in October 2014 after it was revealed that he had developed an addiction to opiates and was soliciting money from fans (under false pretences) to support his addiction, leaving Malo and Deakin as the two remaining original members. This revelation was not made public until December.\n\nReynolds has not been replaced by a permanent band member. As Reynolds' addiction affected his playing, both before Reynolds's firing and after, session players played bass on Mavericks recordings and at live shows (where in recent years Reynolds played a \"barely audible\" acoustic guitar that was deliberately buried in the sound mix). In his absence, Ed Friedland is the band's touring bassist.\n\nThe Mavericks released a new album, \"Mono\", on 17 February 2015. In June 2016 they parted ways with Valory.\n\nThe group released their ninth studio album \"Brand New Day\" on 31 March 2017.\n\nOn June 25, 2019, \"The New York Times Magazine\" listed The Mavericks among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.

McKinnell, Jr. (born February 23, 1943) is an American business executive, who served as the chief executive officer and chairman of the board of directors of Pfizer Inc. from 2001 to 2006/2007. He is also a director of Moody's.\n\nHe was born in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. He originally worked towards a degree in chemistry but later changed his declared degree to business. He earned his bachelor's degree for business from the University of British Columbia in 1965. Later, he earned his master's and doctorate in business administration (finance subfield) from Stanford Business School.\n\nHis first job offer was for Pfizer, but he instead chose to work at American Standard for three years (1969–1971). He later joined Pfizer in early 1971. Over the course of the next 32 years, McKinnell climbed his way up several positions. He was named CEO as of January 2001 and named chairman in April 2001.\n\nIn 2003 he won the Woodrow Wilson Award for Corporate Citizenship. McKinnell was known as an aggressive and hard line advocate of trade sanctions against developing countries in disputes over patents and other intellectual property rights on medicines. In 2006, several Stanford alums asked that McKinnell be removed from an advisory board at the Stanford Business School, due to the aggressive use of litigation against the head of the Philippines regulatory agency.\n\nFollowing falling share prices, McKinnell resigned the CEO position on July 28, 2006, amid dissatisfaction from the board of directors and declining investor confidence and was replaced by Jeff Kindler on that day. He was scheduled to remain as chairman until February 2007.\n\nPfizer was relatively conservative with regard to mega-mergers through stock-for-stock transactions through most of its history until McKinnell took the helm in 2001. Pfizer's per share price (adjusted for splits) went from about $50 to $30 from 1999 to 2006 during McKinnell's tenure. With roughly 7 billion shares outstanding, this reflects a loss in value of 140 billion dollars under McKinnell's leadership pursuing a strategy of growth via stock for stock acquisition.\n\nIt could be argued that some of the decline in Pfizer's market value during this time could be attributed to the overall decline in blue chip stocks from 1999 to 2001. However, many industry analysts criticized McKinnell for diluting shareholder value with these expensive stock-for-stock acquisitions that obviously paid a premium for the underlying value of the acquired company. Furthermore, internal contributions to the pipeline did not replace declining value nor did these M&A activities. However, McKinnell received record compensation which he staunchly defended against critics.\n\nAccording to documents Pfizer filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, McKinnell received a base salary in 2005 of $2,270,500, and a bonus of $3,700,000. He also received $145,814 in other compensation (primarily tax payments made by Pfizer on behalf of employees), and nearly $5.5 million in long-term incentive payouts. The value of his retirement package and deferred compensation will exceed $275,000,000.\n\nMcKinnell has, according to documents filed with the Federal Elections Commission, donated mainly to Republican Party candidates. He has donated to George W. Bush, John Thune, Chuck Grassley, and others.\n"}

The lineup consists of Tomislav Mandarić, Ivan Ivanković, Duje Ivić, and Ivica Bilić Ike.\n\nThe band name originates from the Thompson submachine gun, a nickname given to Perković while he fought in the Croatian War of Independence. Although predominantly formed in Čavoglave, Thompson is currently based in Zagreb. Thompson came to prominence during the Croatian war in 1991, with the release of the first single \"Bojna Čavoglave\", which proclaims the Croatian resistance to the Serb intervention and was included in the compilation album \"Rock za Hrvatsku\". This song, with slightly modified lyrics, named \"Branitelji Sarajeva\", was sung by the BiH Army during the Siege of Sarajevo (\"Sarajevo zaboravit neće nikada\"). During the 1990s Thompson gained popularity in Croatia with the release of the first album \"Moli mala\" in 1992. They later regained popularity with the popular hit \"Prijatelji\" in 1998. \n\nIn 2002, Thompson began their first major tour to promote the album \"E, moj narode\". This tour continued sporadically until 2005, and included concerts at the Sydney Entertainment Centre and Melbourne's Vodafone Arena. In May 2005, the album was declared a Diamond Record with more than 60,000 copies sold. Touring continued in 2006 with \"Bilo jednom u Hrvatskoj\", again performing internationally with concerts in Germany, Sweden, Australia, Canada, and the United States.\n\nThompson features annually at the Homeland Victory celebrations in their hometown of Čavoglave. These performances are attended by as many as 60,000 to 100,000 spectators, and feature Croatian singers like Mate Bulić, Dražen Zečić, Ivan Mikulić, and Baruni. The band has garnered controversy for its purported glorification of the World War Two Nazi-affiliated Ustaše regime in their songs and concerts.\n\nMarko Perković, the founder of the group, was born 27 October 1966 in the village of Čavoglave in the rural Dalmatian hinterland of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\n\nHe first gained prominence in 1991 at the beginning of the Yugoslav wars, most specifically the Croatian War of Independence, with the song \"Bojna Čavoglave\" (). Perković was not a professional singer, nor had the band yet been formed. It was reportedly composed as an anthem for the territorial defence unit hastily formed by natives of Čavoglave, at that time under JNA and Chetnik attacks. He released it under his own battle name, \"Thompson\".\n\nIn 1992, Perković published his first album, \"Moli mala\" (). By this time he had left active service in the Croatian Army, and toured with other performers of the Rock za Hrvatsku in a humanitarian concert, but he returned to military service for a short time in 1995 to participate in Operation Storm. As time passed, Perković lost his early popularity and through the 1990s he remained relatively less popular. He released some minor hits, such as \"Zmija me za srce ugrizla\" () and \"Grkinjo, znaj, svemu je kraj\" (), but regained popularity after \"Prijatelji\" () in 1998, followed in the same year by his fourth album, \"Winds from Dinara\", which includes two other popular releases: \"Zaustavi se Vjetre\": () and \"Lijepa li si\" ().\n\nAfter the parliamentary elections in 2000, a left-wing government was formed, led by the president of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), Ivica Račan, last secretary-general of the League of Communists of Croatia and a prominent leader in Croatia's push for independence. This sparked angry reactions among Croatian nationalists and Perković regained popularity. During his concerts he made obscene comments about the Croatian Prime Minister at the time, Ivica Račan, and the President of the Republic, Stipe Mesić.\n\nMany of the band's songs (such as \"Bojna Čavoglave\", \"Lijepa li si\", and \"Zaustavi se vjetre\") became major hits in Croatia, and are played at football games and other large events. The band has won the Croatian music competitions Melodije Mostara (in 2001) and the Croatian Radio Festival (in 2006), and has performed annually on Victory and Homeland Thanksgiving Day, with the proceeds going to the families of Croatian soldiers. \n\nAfter the release of \"E, Moj Narode\" in 2002, the band began touring to promote the album. The height of the tour was a concert at the Poljud football stadium in Split. The concert was attended by some 40,000 spectators. During the song \"Lijepa li si\", Miroslav Škoro, Alen Vitasović, Mate Bulić, Giuliano Đanić, and Mladen Grdović joined him on stage. At the concert, Perković stated that his songs mark his three loves: God, homeland, and family.\n\nThe concert sparked controversies. Two seats in the audience were reserved for Mirko Norac (convicted war criminal, who was on trial at the time) and Ante Gotovina (found not guilty in 2012 on all charges by an appeals panel at the ICTY, but at the time a fugitive). At the beginning of the concert, just moments before Perković stepped onstage, the audience sang the Ustaše song \"Evo zore, evo dana\".\n\nIn 2003, Thompson released a best-of CD. Also in 2004, vocalist and bassist Tiho Orlić released a solo eponymous album, \"Tiho\", which contained a couple of Thompson songs, and on which Perković collaborated. This tour continued sporadically into 2005. Internationally, he played at Sydney's Entertainment Centre and Melbourne's Vodafone Arena in May 2005. By the end of the tour, the album was declared a Diamond Record after more than 60,000 copies were sold.\n\n\"Bilo jednom u Hrvatskoj\" was released in December 2006. Despite the late release, it became the second-highest selling Croatian album of the year. Thompson soon after announced an initial tour of Croatia and select European cities beginning after the Lenten season through summer, culminating with a performance at Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb. The tour began in Vukovar in the Borovo Naselje neighborhood, where approximately 4000 fans came out to watch the group perform.\n\nThe tour continued to Đakovo before going to Frankfurt, where he performed for a crowd of approximately 15,000 at Ballsporthalle. By June, the album had sold 100,000 copies—very high by Croatian standards. The first tour leg in Croatia ended with the biggest concert at Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb, where they performed in front of 60,000 spectators. The concert was broadcast live on Croatian Public Television. As part of the second leg, Thompson performed at Split's Stadion Stari plac in front of 25,000 people. The show was recorded for a live CD release.\nHe had two shows scheduled in November 2007 for New York City, which provoked protests from several Jewish groups. These groups called on the Archdiocese of New York to stop the show, but the diocese declined, reportedly finding no evidence that the group promoted neo-Nazism. A \"Washington Post\" reporter who attended one of the concerts also questioned the purported neo-Nazi link. The band's concert in Toronto attracted 5000 people to the Croatian center where it was held, after the original venue with a capacity of 2,500, Kool Haus, cancelled. The rest of the tour continued as planned.\n\nThompson returned to Croatia in November 2007, and continued with shows in Bosnia and Herzegovina cities including Mostar, Tomislavgrad, Novi Travnik, Široki Brijeg, and Čapljina. His last show in Croatia before heading to Australia was Cibona's annual Christmas benefit show at Dražen Petrović Basketball Hall with proceeds going to the Zagreb Cathedral. The tour in Australia included shows at Melbourne's Festival Hall, Sydney's Sydney United Sports Centre on New Year's Eve, Adelaide, and Perth. The B'nai B'rith Anti-Defamation Commission of Australia lobbied to prevent the band from receiving Australian visas, but government officials found the band did not violate any terms which would impede their receiving visas. After several guest appearances in Croatia, the rapper Shorty was confirmed to be joining Thompson for the Australian leg of the tour, which collectively drew in 22,000 fans at four shows. In the new year the tour continued with shows in Rijeka, Krapina, and Čakovec before pausing for the group's usual Lenten break.\n\nAfter the break the group had shows in Zadar's Jazine Arena and in Gothenburg, Sweden. A show in Nova Gradiška had proceeds going to the construction of a local Catholic church. After Nova Gradiška the band proceeded with shows in Varaždin, Karlovac, and Županja. Local authorities threatened to block the band's 21 May concert in Stuttgart, Germany. However, they backed down after the concert's German Croat backers threatened legal action against the city and translated twenty of the band's songs into German for the authorities' benefit.\n\nThompson was asked by Croatian veteran groups to perform at the Defender's Day celebrations at Zagreb's Ban Jelačić Square, the concert being free of charge. An estimated 55–60,000 people attended the concert by the official police estimates, some figures placed the number at 100,000.\n\nThompson played in Kupres on 19 July at the Croatian Defenders Stadium as part of the town's Saint Elijah celebrations. The band played in Livno on 27 July to end Canton 10's international \"Tera\" conference in front of a crowd of 15–20,000 people. In 2008, in celebration of Victory Day in Čavoglave, Thompson drew a crowd between 60,000 and 100,000.\n\nGuests included musicians Mate Bulić and Dražen Zečić, former Croatian international footballers Ardian Kozniku and Ivica Mornar, and international basketball player Dino Rađa. Thompson played in Neum on 29 August in front of 5,000 spectators with profits going to the building of a new church in the town. On 30 May 2008, Thompson held a concert on Ban Jelačić Square. The tour officially ended on 28 December 2008 at the same Borovo Naselje venue in which it began, with another humanitarian concert with profits going to Vukovar's hospital. It was attended by hospital's director and war-time heroine Vesna Bosanac, who greeted him on stage.\n\nIt was estimated by Thompson's staff that almost 950,000 tickets were sold during the whole two-year-long tour. In June 2008, Perković was named the third most influential person in Croatian show business by \"Globus\" magazine.\n\nThe tour started on 22 June 2013 at the Zenith in Munich, Germany in front of 4,000 people. The tour continued with the concert at the Poljud football stadium in Split on 30 June 2013. The concert was reportedly attended by 50,000 spectators. \n\n\nThompson's songs are often marked with Christian and historic themes, and include folklore elements. Many of his songs deal with religion: \"Radost s Visina\" (), \"Neću izdat ja\" (), \"Dan dolazi\" (), and \"Početak\" (), or his own family and birthplace: \"Vjetar s Dinare\" (), \"Sine Moj\" (), and \"Moj Dida i Ja\" (). Thompson, along with Fra Šito Ćorić and Miroslav Škoro, performed the official anthem at the Croatian World Games. Thompson composed the anthem of the Croatian Party of Rights. Thompson's \"Lijepa li si\" was recorded with Miroslav Škoro, Mate Bulić, Giulliano, Mladen Grdović, and Alen Vitasović. Other projects have included \"Ljuta guja\" with Jasmin Stavros, and \"Reci brate moj\" with Škoro.\n\nPerković has said he is personally a fan of such bands as Nightwish, Iron Maiden, AC/DC, and Dream Theater, among others. Thompson recorded hard rock similar to these bands for the first time on the album \"Bilo jednom u Hrvatskoj\", considered by some to be a rock opera. A \"Washington Post\" writer described the New York stop on the \"Bilo jednom u Hrvatskoj\" tour as sounding \"like Iron Maiden doing Eastern European folk\".\n\nControversy regarding the alleged promotion of the fascist Ustaše regime led to a number of banned performances, including the band's concert in the Netherlands in 2003.\n\nThompson became popular with their 1991 hit song \"Bojna Čavoglave\", which was released during the Croatian War of Independence. The song depicts a battle involving a battalion of Croatian soldiers from Čavoglave, a village in the Dalmatian rural hinterland (and Perković's birthplace). The song opens with the WW2-era Ustaše salute \"Za dom spremni\". This salute is the Ustaše equivalent of \"Sieg Heil\".\n\nIn 2007, the Anti Defamation League reported that many of the Thompson concert attendees, who were primarily young people, wore clothing with Ustashe symbols and carried banners with \"anti-Serb and anti-Roma rhetoric\". They performed Nazi salutes in response to the band's \"traditional “war cry” of the Ustashe\" done at the beginning of the concert. Ustashe material was also allegedly sold at venues.\n\nThe band performed Jasenovac i Gradiška Stara, which aggrandizes massacres against Serbs, Jews and Roma committed by the Ustaše at the Jasenovac and Stara Gradiška concentration camps.\n\nIn 2003, the band was barred from having a concert in Amsterdam. Regarding the cancellation of the concert, Perkovic allegedly told a Croatian newspaper, \"It is all to blame on the Jews. I have nothing against them and I did nothing to them. I know that Jesus Christ also did nothing against them, but still they hanged him on the cross. So what can I expect as a small man?\".\n\nTwo weeks after the concert in Zagreb on 17 June 2007, Perković made this statement regarding claims by the Simon Wiesenthal Center that he is a fascist: \"Me and members of my band saw nobody with Ustaša iconography among 60 and more thousand people on Maksimir.\"\nThe performance included the use of Ustashe slogans. At Thompson's Zagreb concert for the Day of Defenders, a group of youths was heard chanting \"Ubi Srbina\" (\"Kill the Serb\"), according to some Croatian media sources.\n\nThe most discussed concert was the first ever banned in Croatia, in the Istrian town of Umag. After this ban, Thompson asked for permission to hold a concert in Pula, Istria's most populous city. When this was denied, the band initiated and lost court actions against the city of Pula for \"human rights violations\". After the court decision, the band's lawyer declared that sooner or later Thompson would perform in Pula. In late December 2008, he managed to secure permission to organize a concert in Pazin, despite fierce opposition from the Istrian Democratic Assembly, the region's leading political party. These attacks led to an increase of tensions, which reached their climax the night of 11 December, when an explosive device was ignited outside the concert venue. Although IDS MP Damir Kajin accused Thompson's fans, it turned out that the offender, Vilim Bon (then aged 59), who was injured in the defragration and arrested by police, was acting to stop the concert. The concert took place as planned on 20 December 2008, followed by two more shows on 21 and 22 December due to reported demand.\n\nThompson was banned from performing in Switzerland multiple times, including in 2009. Their planned 2014 Berlin performance was cancelled and in 2017, they were banned from performing in Austria due to their extremism as well as in Slovenia.\n\nIt has been noted in Serbian media that Thompson might have used the melodies of a Chetnik song, \"Nad Kraljevom živa vatra seva\", for their \"Anica kninska kraljica\", and a Partisan song, \"Sivi sokole\", for their \"Bojna Čavoglave\".\n\nPerković has stated he is neither an Ustaša nor a fascist, but a patriot. The Croatian Helsinki Committee has come out against any potential bans, with its president Ivo Banac referring to such calls from Stipe Mesić and Damir Kajin as a \"weakening of the democratic order\". At his concert in Vukovar on 13 April 2007, he stated:\n\nI can't command anybody what to wear at my concert, and I have never encouraged anybody to wear a cap or shirt with letter 'U'. My message to all of them (and that I would say this evening too, if I saw [anything like that]): wear the insignia of the victorious Croatian army from Croatian War of Independence. It is sad that young people return so far in history and fall for propaganda.\n\nPerković's last tour, \"Bilo jednom u Hrvatskoj\", was protested by various Jewish organizations. Held in Frankfurt, the organizations vehemently requested that the German government ban the concert because of its alleged fascist lyrics. When the German government received the transcript of Thompson's songs, the request to ban the concert was immediately rejected. At the 17 June 2007, concert at Maksimir Stadium, Zagreb, Perković repeated his claim that he is not a fascist.\n\nThe audience, in a sign of approval, shouted a medieval Croatian battle-cry (mostly known from Ivan Zajc's opera \"Nikola Šubić Zrinski\" and today used mostly to boost morale at soccer matches), \"U boj, u boj – za narod svoj!\" (). In anticipation of a New Year's Eve tour in Australia and New Zealand, Perković released an interview with the local Croatian community magazine, \"Hrvatski Vjesnik\", a translation of which was published in the \"New Generation\" English language supplement, in which he stated that the vast majority of Croats (including himself) do not have negative feelings towards Jewish people or their religion, and expressed sympathy after the recent controversy with the Simon Wiesenthal Center. However, based on his tumultuous history, which includes many incendiary and hateful remarks towards Serbs and other ethnic groups, coupled with his seeming support for Ustaše movements, this retort was widely believed to be nothing more than politically correct posturing.\n\nAfter the concert in Ban Jelacic square, planned concerts in Switzerland and Austria were banned, allegedly for security reasons; a similar effort in Stuttgart was rebuked by local Croatians and Germans of Croatian descent, threatening legal action.\n\nThompson's hit song \"Lijepa li si\" (meaning \"How beautiful you are\", referring to Croatia) is traditionally played after and at halftime at all matches of the Croatian national football team at Maksimir stadium.\n\nA controversy resulted in 2007 when, during a match against Israel, the song was not played. After the match Croatian players Josip Šimunić and Darijo Srna voiced their concerns about the song not being played. Former Croatian international and longtime member of the Israeli league Đovani Roso went on to claim the song had not bothered anyone at the Israel Football Association. Croatian manager Slaven Bilić came to Thompson's defence. After its 3–2 win over England at Wembley Stadium, the Croatian national team began singing the song themselves along with Croatian fans.\n\nThe band has held numerous humanitarian concerts. Thompson made a guest appearance at a humanitarian concert in Jastrebarsko on 5 February 2005, to raise money for a local person's lymphoma treatment. Mate Bulić and Thompson held a concert in Slavonski Brod in 2006 with proceeds going to the building of a shrine near the city. Thompson participated in the October 2006 humanitarian concert \"Noć zvijezda, noć hitova\". Following the fires along the Kornati coast during the summer of 2007, the band participated in the recording of a memorial song \"Ovo nije kraj\" (), as well as a charity football match at Poljud attended by 30,000 people.\n\nPerković performed at the annual Christmas concert in Zagreb's Dražen Petrović Basketball Hall. The group performed at the humanitarian concert \"Pjesmom za život\" in Ljubuški on 30 October 2008, with proceeds going to the ill Herzegovinian Croat singer Jozo Milićević-Galini.\n\nPerković appeared at a memorial football tournament for the deceased from the Croatian War of Independence near Imotski to hand out the awards to the winners. In November 2008, he appeared at a humanitarian concert in Zagreb headlined by Mate Bulić with proceeds going to the Ana Rukavina Foundation, founded to establish a nationwide bone marrow donation network.\n\nThe only permanent member of the band is Perković, and he is often identified with the band. \nThe band line-up on the \"Bilo jednom u Hrvatskoj\" tour was Fedor Boić, Damir Lipošek Kex, Tomislav Mandarić, Tiho Orlić, and Damir Šomen. The band line-up for the \"Ora et labora\" tour is: Ivica Bilić Ike (drums), Ivan Ivanković (guitar), Duje Ivić (synthesizer), Tiho Orlić (bass and back vocals) and Perković.\n\n\n\n\nIn Croatian music, festivals play a large role, with new songs frequently being released for a festival and the best song being declared winner. Thompson has appeared at the following festivals:\n\n"}

Alexander Luthor in this story was from the antimatter universe and he designated the primary universe as Earth 2 upon discovering it, hence the book title.\n\nDC Comics later revived the concept of multiverse in Infinite Crisis and 52. As a result, the Earth 2 concept introduced in this book no longer exists and the term Earth 2 has a different meaning in the current continuity.\n\nAlexander Luthor, the lone hero from the Antimatter universe, breaks the barrier between Earths 1 and 2, seeking the JLA's help. He imprisons and takes the place of his evil positive-matter counterpart. Meanwhile, the JLA investigate a plane crash where all the (dead) passengers have hearts on the right side of their bodies, and money bearing the slogan \"In Mammon We Trust\" and the face of Benedict Arnold. This leads them to Alexander Luthor, who informs them of the other Earth and asks for 48 hours of their time to help the oppressed world. The JLA, except for Aquaman and the Martian Manhunter, follow Luthor to the alternate Earth.\n\nThe Crime Syndicate are introduced. Each is an evil counterpart of a JLA member. Ultraman calls a meeting, discovers Luthor's absence, and begins plotting to take over the positive matter universe, while Power Ring and Johnny Quick discuss the possibility of counterparts to themselves.\n\nGreen Lantern forms a force field around the moon, trapping the CSA in their lunar base. The JLA and Luthor begin to set the world right. Batman works to clear Gotham City of crime with the antimatter-universe version of his father, police Chief Thomas Wayne, who survived the famous shooting that spawned Batman while Bruce and his mother were killed. In this universe, Bruce had a brother, Thomas Jr., who blamed his father for the deaths and became Owlman out of revenge. The ruthless crime lord Boss Gordon is also brought to justice.\n\nOwlman correctly concludes that 24 hours after the JLA appeared on the antimatter Earth, the CSA will be transported to the positive-matter Earth in order to correct a dimensional equilibrium. When this occurs, the CSA attack the White House and destroy much of Washington DC, then are easily subdued by Aquaman and the Martian Manhunter, who take down the most powerful CSA members with startling ease.\n\nMeanwhile, the JLA's attempts to reform the antimatter Earth unravel quickly; the \"opposite\" nature of this world means that evil and corruption are the natural order of things and any attempt to improve the society is doomed to failure. This is also why the CSA fell so easily to Aquaman and Martian Manhunter; justice is destined to prevail on the positive-matter Earth.\n\nIt is revealed that Luthor has been manipulated by Ultraman's servant, the antimatter Brainiac. Luthor's actions in bringing the two Earths into contact will unintentionally result in the two Earths merging into the same space and destroying each other, with the JLA and CSA being powerless to stop it due to their being on Earths where they, by the nature of the respective universes, cannot win. Brainiac anticipated this and has prepared himself to collect the energy released by the destroyed Earths, evolving into an \"Nth Level Intelligence\" and essentially becoming a god.\n\nAttempting to stop the collision, Superman discovers that this Brainiac is a biological organism; Superman's code against killing prevents him from harming Brainiac. Convinced now that only evil could win on the antimatter Earth, Superman and Wonder Woman refrain from trying to defeat Brainiac themselves. Flash switches the teams back to their respective Earths. Upon arrival, a vengeful Ultraman gives Brainiac a laser-vision lobotomy to ensure that he never poses a threat again. The two Earths return to their own spaces, and each team ponders their counterparts on the other side of the dimensional barrier.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Other major churches involved include Victory Family Centre and Covenant Evangelical Free Church.\n\nIn August 2013, FCBC was fined by the Ministry of Manpower and made to compensate a former staff whose employment was terminated 7 months into her pregnancy, depriving her of wages and maternity benefits. The married woman had been dismissed after she was discovered to be pregnant with the child of another former male staff. Employment Act in Singapore protects an expectant mother from the fourth month of pregnancy and requires employers to pay maternity benefits if she is dismissed without sufficient cause during this period. Reverend Khong disagreed with the ministry's judgement, but the ministry said that \"employment legislation has to be kept secular because of Singapore's multi-cultural and multi-religious society.\" \n\nIn October 2013, the church announced plans to file papers requesting a judicial review of the original judgement, believing the ministry had acted unconstitutionally in the way it interfered in the church's affairs. The ministry expressed disappointment, saying that \"We live in a secular society where laws have been put in place to protect individuals while not depriving religious organisations and individuals of the space to carry out their practices.\"\n\n"}

He served in several high-ranking positions in the South African administration of South West Africa, was the chairman of the 1975–1977 Turnhalle Constitutional Conference, and co-founded the Republican Party (RP) of Namibia as well as the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA), now known as the Popular Democratic Movement (PDM).\n\nAt Namibian independence, Mudge was a member of the Constituent Assembly and 1st National Assembly until he retired in 1993. Mudge is the founder of Namibia's Afrikaans daily \"Die Republikein\" and its publisher Namibia Media Holdings. He served on the board of directors until 2008.\n\nDirk Mudge, a White Namibian of Afrikaner descent with mixed Dutch and German roots, was born on the farm Rusthof near Otjiwarongo. He is a farmer by profession. In 1947, he graduated from Stellenbosch University with a Bachelor of Commerce, whereupon he worked as an accountant in Windhoek. Between 1952 and 1960, he farmed with cattle.\n\nIn 1955, Mudge became a member of the pro-apartheid National Party (NP), which governed South Africa between 1948 and 1994. He joined the Legislative Assembly in 1961 as one of seven members elected to represent South West Africa's White citizens in the Parliament of South Africa. In 1965, Mudge became a member of the Executive Committee for South West Africa and thus a high-ranking administrator of the territory. He held this position until 1977.\n\nWhen AH du Plessis, the leader of the South West African branch of the National Party, was appointed Minister in 1969, Mudge acted in his position as leader of the NP. At that time he began to disagree with NP's views on the future of South West Africa. He forged a friendship with Herero Chief Clemens Kapuuo, discussed plans for a self-governed South West Africa with then-Prime Minister John Vorster, and became one of the driving forces behind the 1975–77 Turnhalle Constitutional Conference.\n\nThe Turnhalle Conference was an attempt to win over a broad spectrum of the indigenous population by means of small reforms and compromises, and thus make them cease their support for the armed resistance waged by SWAPO at that time. Its aim was also to cement the separation of the South West African ethnicities by making the future state of Namibia, a constitution of which was drafted at the Turnhalle conference, a confederation of bantustans. Mudge served as chairman. As a result of the conference, many of the participating delegates agreed to aggregate their small, ethnically defined parties into one bigger body that was able to form a counterbalance to SWAPO. Mudge founded the Republican Party (RP) shortly before the Turnhalle proceedings finished. The RP joined when on 5 November 1977 the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA) was founded with Clemens Kapuuo as first president and Dirk Mudge as chairman.\n\nAt that time Mudge founded \"Die Republikein\", until today the only Afrikaans daily, as mouthpiece of the RP. He also established \"Democratic Media Holdings\" (today Namibia Media Holdings), the publishing agency of the newspaper.\n\nThe subsequent 1978 South West African legislative election was won by the DTA by a landslide, which claimed 41 of the 50 seats. Although these elections were the first multi-racial elections in the territory of South West Africa there were allegations of widespread intimidation, not least by the presence of South African troops in the north of the territory. The United Nations Security Council declared these elections \"null and void\". On 1 July 1980 Mudge became the chairman of the Council of Ministers of the resulting government.\n\nThe Council resigned in 1983, and the administration of South West Africa was executed by the South African occupiers again. In September 1983 the Multi-Party Conference (MPC) was established which consisted of 19 \"internal\" (that is, South West African) parties. After considering his options, Mudge agreed to become the DTA representative on this conference, although he had hoped for a different outcome of its proceedings: \n\nAs in the past, they [proposers of the MPC] did not have any problems in convincing members of the DTA and other parties to participate, seeing that there would be financial benefits involved. I found myself standing alone in the DTA and, much against my will, I agreed to participate – provided that the MPC confine itself to a discussion on constitutional proposals, and that an interim government would not be considered. I should have known better. It did not take long before the possibility of another interim government was raised and strongly supported by virtually every member of the MPC.\n\nThe MPC suggested in its April 1985 \"Bill of Fundamental Rights and Objectives\" the establishment of a Transitional Government of National Unity (TNGU). South Africa followed this suggestion three months later, setting up a forced coalition government under the leadership of the DTA (22 seats) but including five smaller parties of eight seats each.\n\nThe TNGU was chaired by its ministers on a round-robin basis, changing every three months. Mudge as Minister of Finance took the rotating chairmanship in 1986 and in 1988. However, as president of the largest party in the TNGU, Mudge was the \"de facto\" leader of the government, and within the DTA, Mudge's Republican Party was seen as the driving force.\n\nIn November 1989, Dirk Mudge founded the Democratic Media Trust of Namibia, an agency funding newsprinting in Namibia with the mission to \"promote a free and independent media in Namibia\". For the establishment of this trust, money was used that was originally meant to fight SWAPO in the 1989 independence elections. The trust owned Democratic Media Holdings which in turn owned John Meinert Printing, Namibia's biggest newspaper printing works. By 2007 the trust had sold its remaining stakes in the printing industry and became a charity dedicated to education and development. Mudge was chairman of the Board of Directors of the trust until 2008.\n\nMudge gained a seat on a DTA ticket in the 1989 election to the Constituent Assembly of Namibia which became independent Namibia's first National Assembly. He retired in 1993.\n\nThe effect of Mudge's political involvement on the progress of Namibia's independence is controversial. While on the one side he had been lauded for bringing about a multi-party political system and multi-ethnic elections, others see him as having delayed independence of the territory, prolonged the suffering of the indigenous population, and entrenched racial segregation.\n\nOn 9 December 2016, 69 years after graduating with a bachelor's degree, Mudge was awarded with a PhD \"honoris causa\" by his \"alma mater\" Stellenbosch University. The motivation read:“With exceptional visionary, strategic and transformational leadership, he not only served as “peace broker”, leading his traditional support base onto a new path, but also played a significant role in facilitating reconciliation between white and black in Namibia. In many respects, he helped break through the post-World War II impasse on the status and position of this former mandated territory of South Africa.”\n\nDirk Mudge retired from politics in April 1993 and returned to his farm \"Ovikere\" near Kalkfeld in Namibia's Otjozondjupa Region. He was married to Stienie Jacobs. Together, they had five children, sixteen grandchildren and twenty-three great grandchildren. Mudge is the father of fellow politician Henk Mudge who succeeded him as leader of the Republican Party.\nIn May 2015, at the age of 86, Mudge published his autobiography. The book was originally written in Afrikaans and titled \"\"Dirk Mudge: Enduit vir ’n onafhanklike Namibië\"\"\".\" The book was then translated to English and released in May 2016 with the title \"\"All the way to an independent Namibia\"\". In the preface of the English version, Dr Piet Croucamp writes: “Mudge’s memoir does not relive the past in times of modernity. The reader becomes displaced ‒ in a way ‒ to a familiar but awkward if not painful past. The narrative, conceived in stigma and shame, is presented with a “respectability” or even bizarre “reality” which once was “normal” to some and an abomination to others. Dirk Mudge has made a remarkable contribution with a text which merits both literary and scholarly value. The work was not intended as a comprehensive history of Namibia ‒ it is a memoir about the life and times of Dirk Mudge.”\n\n"}

He served as President of Somalia from January 26, 1991 to January 3, 1997.\n\nMuhammad rose to power after a coalition of armed opposition groups, including his own United Somali Congress, deposed longtime President Siad Barre. However, Muhammad was not able to exert his authority beyond parts of the capital. Power was instead vied with other faction leaders in the southern half of the country and with autonomous subnational entities in the north.\n\nMuhammad was born in 1939, in Jowhar, an agricultural town in the southern Middle Shabelle region of Somalia (then a colony of Italy known as Italian Somaliland). His family hails from the Abgaal Hawiye clan.\n\nMuhammad began his career in business, working as an independent Mogadishu-based entrepreneur.\n\nAfter fallout from the unsuccessful Ogaden campaign of the late 1970s, the Siad Barre administration began arresting government and military officials under suspicion of participation in the abortive 1978 coup d'état. Most of the people who had allegedly helped plot the putsch were summarily executed. However, several officials managed to escape abroad and started to form the first of various dissident groups dedicated to ousting Barre's regime by force.\n\nBy the late 1980s, Barre's regime had grown considerably unpopular. The authorities became increasingly totalitarian, and resistance movements, supported by Ethiopia's communist Derg administration, sprang up across the country. This eventually led in 1991 to the outbreak of the civil war, the toppling of Barre's government, and the disbandment of the Somali National Army (SNA). Many of the opposition groups subsequently began competing for influence in the power vacuum that followed the ouster of Barre's regime. Armed factions led by United Somali Congress (USC) commanders Ali Mahdi Muhammad and General Mohamed Farah Aidid, in particular, clashed as each sought to exert authority over the capital.\n\nIn 1991, a multi-phased international conference on Somalia was held in neighbouring Djibouti. Aidid boycotted the first meeting in protest. Due to the legitimacy conferred on Muhammad by the Djibouti conference, he was subsequently recognized by the international community as the new President of Somalia. Djibouti, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Italy were among the countries that officially extended recognition to Muhammad's administration. However, he was not able to exert his authority beyond parts of the capital. Power was instead vied with other faction leaders in the southern half of the country and with autonomous subnational entities in the north. The competition for influence and resources between Muhammad and Aidid continued on through the 1992–95 UN missions to Somalia (UNOSOM I, UNOSOM II, and UNITAF), until Aidid's eventual death in 1996.\n\nIn 2000, Muhammad participated in another conference in Djibouti, where he lost a re-election bid to Barre's former Interior Minister Abdiqasim Salad Hassan. Muhammad gave a concession speech, indicating that he respected the outcome of the election and would support and work with the new President-elect.\n\nAs of 2013, Muhammad lives on his farm on the outskirts of Mogadishu.\n"}

He held high office during the CCP's Jiangxi Soviet period (1931–1934).\n\nIn October 1934, at the beginning of the Long March, Xiang stayed behind to fight a rearguard action that would allow the marchers to get out of the ring of surrounding Nationalist forces. The marchers, with Mao Zedong as their leader, went on to Yan'an, while Xiang remained in the Jiangxi region, coordinating guerrilla operations to harass Nationalist forces.\n\nWhen the Japanese invaded in July 1937, a united front (the Second United Front) was declared between Nationalists and Communists, and Xiang's guerrillas became the nucleus of a legitimate fighting force: the New Fourth Army. This army operated behind Japanese lines, and was subject to orders coming from both the Communist leadership in Yan'an, and the Nationalist leadership, which had moved inland from Nanjing to Chongqing.\n\nContradictory orders from these groups led to confusion, and eventually the New Fourth Army Incident, in which Xiang was killed in an assault on the army by the Nationalist forces. He was killed by a member of his own staff, Liu Houzong for the gold resources of the New Fourth Army. Xiang had carried the gold on his own person in the aftermath of the incident. After Liu killed Xiang and two other officers, he absconded with the gold and surrendered to the Nationalists, who promptly accepted the gold and jailed him. He was later freed, but his fate beyond 1949 is unknown.\n\nThe incident was a result of either mistrust or disobedience, or both, between the two parties that would lead to the resumption of full-scale civil war once the Japanese began a full retreat out of China's interior in the summer of 1945, prior to their surrender later that year. Some historians have argued that Xiang was the victim of the indecision of Mao Zedong. Mao's supporters argued that Xiang's misunderstanding of the potential threats posed by the Nationalists, along with his own ambitions, led to his demise. \n\n"}

Range roads (Rge. Rd.) are perpendicular to township roads (Twp. Rd.) which run east–west along the township grid lines.\n\nIn western Canada (especially rural areas in most counties and municipal districts in Alberta), a range road (abbreviated \"RGE. RD.\") is a road running on a north-south parallel to a range line (a line denoting the east and west boundaries of a x legal township in the Dominion Land Survey and Alberta Township land surveying systems).\n\nRange roads are commonly numbered in one-mile (1.6-km) increments west from the east range line of a given township. The range roads form the east and west boundaries (known as Section Lines) of the 1 mile x 1 mile square sections - 36 of which comprise a township (e.g. Range Road 12-2 would be between the second and third sections west of Range line 12, Range Road 6-0 is on Range line 6). In many counties, the dash between the range line number and the section line number is eliminated (Range Road 15-1 (151) might be called \"Range Road one-fifty-one\"). Where a township road offset from a section line, it is often appended with a letter (Range Road 11-1A is just west of the first section line west of Range line 11). This system is useful for finding farmsteads (assuming one knows the legal address of the parcel).\n\nRange roads are perpendicular to township roads (abbreviated TWP. RD.). In the Municipal District of Foothills No. 31, the range and township road naming system has been replaced with a more conventional \"street/avenue\" numbering scheme. Range roads are streets numbered west and east of the Fifth Meridian (Meridian Street) in increments of 16 streets to the mile. Township Roads are avenues numbered on a similar grid to the city of Calgary (the boundary lies between 190th and 220th Avenue) and extends out to 722nd Avenue. This system causes confusion at the southern boundary of the City of Calgary as streets in Calgary are numbered east and west of Centre Street, which is some distance west of the Fifth Meridian. Therefore, street numbers change as one crosses Calgary's southern boundary.\n\nIn Saskatchewan there are both township and range roads. The numbers of the range roads help to establish the location of the roads as they exist with relation to the legal land description survey system. Range roads travel in a north and south direction between the meridians parallel to the latitudinal lines. Range roads indicate firstly the meridian number. In Saskatchewan roads near the Manitoba border would begin with 1 as they would be west of the prime or first meridian, then the range numbers would be west of the second and finally west of the 3rd meridian. There are no roads in Saskatchewan west of the fourth meridian as the fourth meridian line defines the border between Alberta and Saskatchewan. The next two digits would be the range number which increments from east to west from a meridian line. The last range number shows how many miles within the range the road is located starting at the easternmost edge of the range and traveling west. As they mark a definite location such as a longitudes and latitudes, the naming convention is the same across Saskatchewan. Township and Range roads can be either gravel, highway, or municipal paved road. The Dominion Land Survey system designated a township road allowance every two miles apart south to north, and allowed for a range road allowance every mile apart east to west.\n\nDue to the curvature of the Earth, some townships adjacent to major Meridian lines (e.g. the Fifth Meridian - 114°W) are truncated. There are more townships between meridian lines along the 49th Parallel (the boundary between Canada and the United States of America) than there are along the 60th Parallel (the boundary between Canada's southern provinces and northern territories).\n\n"}
{"id": "1852515", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1852515", "title": "Décima", "text": "Décima\n\nA décima is a ten-line stanza of poetry, and the song form generally consists of forty-four lines (an introductory four-line stanza followed by four ten-line stanzas). It is also called \"espinela\" after its founder, Vicente Espinel (1550–1624), a Spanish writer and musician of the Siglo de Oro.\n\nThe décima deals with a wide range of subject matter, including themes that are philosophical, religious, lyrical, and political. Humorous décimas typically would satirize an individual's weakness or foolish act. A decimero would frequently challenge the target of the satire or his/her defender to respond in kind with a décima, thereby setting up a song duel that tested the originality and wit of contending composers.\n\nLatin America and Spain\nThe \"decima\" in all Latin America and in Spain is a style of poetry that is octosyllabic and has 10 lines to the stanza. The rhyming scheme is \"ABBAACCDDC\". It is spoken, sung and written throughout Latin America with variations in different countries. It is often improvised.\n\nEach country has its own melody and tone (\"tonada\") and a different instrument, but the style and structure is exactly the same. A person who writes or improvises décima is known as a \"decimista\" or \"decimero\".\n\nThe term \"octosyllabic\" may be misleading to English speakers; the Spanish term refers to a line whose final accented syllable is its seventh. An octosyllabic line may therefore have only seven syllables or, less commonly, nine.\n\n\"\"Juyzio hallado y trobado\"\"\"\"La vida es sueño\"\"\n\nPedro Calderón de la Barca wrote in décimas some stanzas of Life is a Dream.\n\nNicomedes Santa Cruz made poems about Peruvian life and culture in décimas.\n\nMany songs are in the form of décima. For example, Violeta Parra's \"Volver a los Diecisiete\" and \"21 son los Dolores\".\n\nA \"payada\" is a sung duel of improvised décimas.\n\nThe Ecuadorian décima is an oral poetic form that exists among the black population of the Esmeraldas Province. A décima consists Lof 44 lines, each of which generally has eight syllables. A décima consists of one stanza of four lines, and four more stanzas of ten Olines each. Each of the four lines of the first stanza is repeated later in the poem. Sometimes when these lines are repeated, they are Vslightly altered. Patterns of rhyme and meter are not governed by any particular rules.\n\nDuring declamation, there is a pause between stanzas, as well as a pause between the fourth and fifth lines of each ten-line stanza. PThis is reflected in the structure of the poems as well: a transcription of a décima will invariably have a period or a semicolon at the Eend of the fourth line. Some older decimeros add an additional pause between the eighth and ninth line of each ten-line stanza.\n\nThe structure of the décima suggests that it is derived from the Spanish \"glosa\", which also employs eight-syllable lines and a break between the fourth and fifth lines of a ten-line Istanza.\n\nDécimas are generally anonymous. Though many decimeros claim to have composed the décimas they recite, this is rarely the case. One scholar of décimas said he met only one decimero who actually composed his own décimas, and that decimeros living in different areas often claimed to have composed the same poems.\n\n\n\n"}

His maternal aunt Teutberga was the wife of Lothair II, King of Lotharingia. Boso was also the nephew of the Boso, Count of Valois, for whom he was named, and of Hucbert, lay abbot of St. Maurice's Abbey, to which Boso succeeded in 869. He would later marry Ermengard of Italy, the daughter of Louis II of Italy and granddaughter of the Holy Roman Emperor Lothair I, whom he married at age 35.\n\nIn 870, Charles the Bald, King of West Francia, married Boso's sister Richilde. This marriage paved the way for Boso's career in the service of his royal brother-in-law. In the same year, Boso was appointed Count of Lyon and Vienne, replacing Gerard of Roussillon.\n\nIn 872, Charles appointed him chamberlain and \"magister ostiariorum\" (master of porters) to his heir Louis the Stammerer. Boso likewise received investiture as Count of Bourges. Louis was reigning as a subordinate king of Aquitaine, but because of his youth, it was Boso who looked after the administration of that realm.\n\nIn the autumn of 875, Boso accompanied Charles on his first Italian campaign and at the diet of Pavia in February 876 he was appointed arch-minister and \"missus dominicus\" for Italy and elevated to the rank of duke. He became Governor and Count of Provence in 877. He acted as a viceroy and married Ermengarde of Italy, the only daughter of the Emperor Louis II.\n\nBoso disapproved of Charles' second Italian campaign in 877 and conspired with other like-minded nobles against his king. After Charles's death in October, these nobles forced Charles's son to confirm their rights and privileges.\n\nBoso also formed close relations to the papacy and accompanied Pope John VIII in September 878 to Troyes, where the Pope asked King Louis for his support in Italy. The Pope adopted Boso as his son and probably offered to crown Louis emperor. It is said that he wanted to crown Boso emperor.\n\nIn April 879, Louis the Stammerer died, leaving two adult sons, Louis III of France and Carloman II. Boso joined with other western Frankish nobles and advocated making Louis III of France the sole heir of the western kingdom, but eventually both brothers were elected kings. Boso renounced allegiance to the brothers and in July claimed independence by claiming the title \"Dei gratia id quod sum\": by the Grace of God, that is what I am. He also claimed that his imperial father-in-law had named him as his heir. On 15 October 879, the bishops and nobles of the region around the Rhône and Saône rivers assembled in the Synod of Mantaille. They elected Boso King and successor to Louis the Stammerer, the first non-Carolingian king in Western Europe in more than a century. This event was the first \"free election\" among the Franks, without regard to royal descent, inspired by a canonical principle (but not constant practice) of ecclesiastical elections.\n\nBoso's realm, usually called the Kingdom of Provence, comprised the ecclesiastical provinces of the archbishops of Arles, Aix, Vienne, Lyon (without Langres), and probably Besançon, and the dioceses of Tarentaise, Uzès, and Viviers.\n\nAfter Louis and Carloman divided their father's realm at Amiens in March 880, the two brothers joined to march against Boso. They took Mâcon and the northern parts of Boso's realm. Then uniting their forces with those of Charles the Fat, they unsuccessfully besieged Vienne from August to November.\n\nIn August 882, Boso was again besieged at Vienne by his brother, Richard, Duke of Burgundy, Count of Autun, who took the city in September. Boso never regained much of his realm and was restricted to the county of Vienne.\n\nHe died in 887 and was succeeded by his son Louis the Blind.\n\nBoso was married twice. The identity of his first wife is not known; his second wife was Ermengard of Italy, only daughter of Louis II, Holy Roman Emperor, whom he wed in March 876.

Braathen\n\nLudvig Gustav Braathen (17 March 1891 – 27 December 1976) was a Norwegian entrepreneur that founded the shipping company Ludvig G. Braathens Rederi and the airline Braathens SAFE. He was CEO of both companies until his death.\n\nBraathen grew up as one of seven siblings in Drammen. He started studying commercial studies as a 15-year-old in Drammen, and later at Treiders Handelsskole in Oslo. In his youth, Braathen wanted to become an entrepreneur, preferably within the lumber industry. He started working for a furniture wood dealer. In 1909, he changed jobs, and started working for ship-owner E. B. Aaby in Strømsø. In 1913, he moved to Cardiff in Wales, where he worked for Vivyan Kelly & Company as a head of department. He planned to travel to Argentina and China, each for two years, but the outbreak of World War I in 1914 forced Braathen to return home, where he served as a conscript in the Norwegian Royal Guards. After one year, he was hired as an administrator for ship-owner B. A. Sanne in Oslo. When Sanne died in 1922, Braathen was hired as CEO, along with Sanne's son.\n\nIn 1926, Braathen started his own shipping company: Braathens Rederi A/S. He invested all his savings, , along with some capital from one of the captains and a broker. Another NOK 25,000 was borrowed. He bought several small ships that were put into service on routes from Europe to China. The first tanker was bought in 1929 and by 1936, the company had ships totalling 56,000 tonnes.\n\nBraathen has stated that the idea of creating an airline occurred to him in 1936, when the ship \"Brajara\" had engine trouble while en route to Japan. The Japanese shipyards could not guarantee that they could repair the ship, and at first it was considered whether the ship should be towed to Europe for repairs. The solution chosen was instead to have the necessary piece made in Amsterdam and flown to Japan by KLM. In 1937, Braathen travelled to the United States to study aviation, and he looked both at flying boats and took a Douglas DC-3 operated by Trans World Airlines from Kansas City to San Francisco. In 1938, Braathen sent an application to the Norwegian authorities to receive concession and subsidies to start a route from Oslo to New York City. This was rejected, since the authorities did not feel the time was right to give subsidies for such a route.\n\nOn 26 March 1946, Braathens Rederi established an airline called Braathens South American & Far East Airtransport (Braathens SAFE), a subsidiary that bought several Douglas DC-4 aircraft to start charter flights to the Far East and South America. The main intention was to supply his ships with supplies and crews, in addition to providing a service for other shipping companies and travelers. Braathen remained CEO of the company until his death, when the company was taken over by his son Bjørn G. Braathen.\n"}

Its color intensity varies with different growing conditions.\n\nIt was discovered as a chance seedling in 1952 by the farmer O. Moran from Waiwhero in the Moutere Hills near Motueka, New Zealand. It was then cultivated by the Williams Brothers nursery as a potential export variety. It is a seedling from the 'Lady Hamilton' apple. The apple itself is named after Braeburn Orchard near Motueka, where it was first commercially grown.\n\nBraeburn apples have a combination of sweet and tart flavor. They are available October through April in the northern hemisphere and are medium to large in size. They are a popular fruit for growers because of their ability to store well when chilled.\n\nBraeburn apples are useful in cooking in that they hold their shape and do not release a great deal of liquid making them ideal for tarts. According to the US Apple Association website it is one of the fifteen most popular apple cultivars in the United States.\n\nApples can be preserved by short, medium or long-term\nstorage. Braeburn can turn brown inside during commercial long term storage, and it's usually not possible to tell if an apple has the Braeburn browning disorder until a person bites or cuts into it. Apples respond dramatically to both temperature and atmosphere modification. Rapid temperature reduction and the exacting maintenance of low temperature close to the chilling point of the variety can provide good to medium quality product following 3 to 6 months of storage and in some cases longer. However, modern commercial warehouses couple\ntemperature management with controlled atmosphere (CA) for long-term storage of apples. Braeburn can be stored at 0 °C in the air for 3–4 months, and in CA for 8–10 months, with only a slight susceptibility to scalding although it is sensitive to carbon dioxide. The variety has a relatively impermeable skin, which restricts diffusion of gases into and out of the fruit, leading to high internal carbon dioxide concentrations.\n\nThe browning disorder seems worse in overmature fruit, fruit from lightly cropped trees, and large fruit, but it can show up on different trees in different years, and in some regions, but not others.\n\nMaintaining the superior qualities of Braeburn while eliminating Braeburn browning disorder led to the development of the Jazz cultivar. Since Braeburn is such a desirable variety, commercial orchards and trees in regions and locations that have proven not susceptible to the browning disorder are being maintained. Since most home orchardists do not attempt very long term storage, they do not encounter the browning disorder.\n\n\n"}

When Andy Creeggan (who played congas) returned from a trip to South America to find Stewart on drums, he felt somewhat displaced. Creeggan eventually switched to playing mostly keyboards. Stewart has been with the band ever since. He also adds numerous percussive and melodic elements, including piano on \"Born on a Pirate Ship.\"\n\nStewart utilizes an electronic sampler pad for live performances. During acoustic or smaller shows (or sets within shows), he sometimes plays other percussive elements live, including shakers, bongo drums, and drumming on unusual objects, such as an instrument case.\n\nStewart is the only band member who has not actively written songs for the group's albums nor does he write for a side project. He has received a writing credit on only three songs in the band's catalogue: \"Grade 9\" from \"Gordon\", \"Why Say Anything Nice?\" from \"Barenaked Ladies Are Men\" (co-written with Page and Robertson), and \"Allergies\" from \"Snacktime!\" (lyrics co-written with Kevin Hearn, music written by all five then-members). Up until the 2009 acrimonious departure of lead singer Steven Page, Stewart had sung lead on only two recorded songs. Stewart sings lead on \"Allergies\" and a cover of \"Holly Jolly Christmas\" which was cut from \"Barenaked for the Holidays\". Stewart also sings lead on a version of \"Feliz Navidad\" which the band has performed live for holiday shows since 2004. The song has also been played on other occasions with the word \"navidad\" replaced by lyrics relevant to the event (such as \"Feliz Ships and Dip\", and \"Feliz Halloween\", among others). Stewart assumed some of Page's vocal responsibilities for live performances, including \"Alcohol\" from \"Stunt\". Stewart also sings the chorus on the song \"Four Seconds\" from \"All in Good Time\".\n\nStewart was born in Toronto, but was raised in Newmarket, Ontario. He is the son of Sandra Stewart and stepson of Robert Stewart. Stewart's biological father, Leonard Hawkins, is black, a fact which Stewart learned when he was about 12 years old. His stepfather sang in a Scarborough rock band named \"The Wizards of Id\", formed at Woburn Collegiate Institute where both Steven Page and Ed Robertson would later attend. He credits his parents' relative youth (they were only 19 when he was born) with exposing him to interesting music which was frequently played around the house when he was young. He has claimed that his unique eyebrows are the result of his shaving them off when he was eight years old.\n\nStewart is a graduate of Huron Heights Secondary School. He received a Bachelor of Applied Arts degree in Radio and Television Arts from Ryerson Polytechnical Institute (now Ryerson University) in 1989, making him the only member of Barenaked Ladies to have earned a degree.\n\nStewart was a member of The Ambassadors Drum and Bugle Corps, playing bongos and pit percussion from 1979–1980, and tri-drums from 1980 to 1982. He was the drummer for cowpunk/rockabilly band Pogo Rodeo and later 3 Day Bender in the late 1980s. When he met the Barenaked Ladies, at a buskers' festival, he was drumming for the Would Be Goods, a Guelph acoustic duo featuring stage actor Christine Brubaker, and singer Chris Reynolds.\n\nStewart's wife, Jill (née Spratt), is a former high school French teacher, and the two were married on September 19, 1998; they have three daughters, Mili, born April 2, 1999, Hazel, born April 16, 2001 and Carmen, born January 28, 2011. In his spare time, he enjoys cooking. He is a huge hockey fan and actively promotes Women's Hockey in Canada, serving on the board of The Ladies First Hockey Foundation and coaching his daughters' teams, one being The George Bell Titans. Stewart also went to high school with former Leafs goalie Curtis Joseph where the two became friends. He also enjoys playing hockey, and is a member of the Jokers Hockey Club in the Canadian Exclaim! Hockey Summit of the Arts. Stewart is also an occasional panelist/contributor on the post-game show for Hockey Night in Canada, and an on-air contributor to the morning show on The Fan 590. He took part in Super Skate, a celebrity hockey game fundraiser at Madison Square Garden for the Christopher Reeve Foundation in 1999, 2001 and 2002. Participants included Denis Leary, Kim Alexis, Rick Moranis, Chris Jericho, Gary Dell'Abate, Chad Smith, Darren Pang and Jason Priestley, among others. Stewart is a member of the Canadian Charity Artists Against Racism and has worked with them on campaigns like radio PSAs.\n\nStewart is the first cousin of Kevin Yarde, a former television presenter for The Weather Network and the current Member of Provincial Parliament for Brampton North in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario.\n\nStewart currently plays Sonor drums and Sabian cymbals. He uses Vic Firth drumsticks (mainly 55A and RUTE606). Previously, He had his own signature sticks made by Regal Tip from 2004–2015 which he designed with his drum tech, Rob \"Tiny\" Menegoni. The sticks were called Ty-phoons (a second, \"dipped\" version of which was released in the mid-2000s). He also uses a Roland SPD-S sampling multi-trigger pad and Roland Electronic Drums and pads. Stewart uses Aquarian Drumheads.\n\nPrior to his switch to SONOR in early 2015, Tyler played Pearl Drums from mid-2006. Stewart used custom Ayotte drums from at least 1994, and prior to that, Canwood drums.\n\n"}

{"id": "1852572", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1852572", "title": "Marangoni effect", "text": "Marangoni effect\n\nThe Marangoni effect (also called the Gibbs–Marangoni effect) is the mass transfer along an interface between two fluids due to a gradient of the surface tension. In the case of temperature dependence, this phenomenon may be called thermo-capillary convection (or Bénard–Marangoni convection).\n\nThis phenomenon was first identified in the so-called \"tears of wine\" by physicist James Thomson (Lord Kelvin's brother) in 1855. The general effect is named after Italian physicist Carlo Marangoni, who studied it for his doctoral dissertation at the University of Pavia and published his results in 1865. A complete theoretical treatment of the subject was given by J. Willard Gibbs in his work \"On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances\" (1875-8).\n\nSince a liquid with a high surface tension pulls more strongly on the surrounding liquid than one with a low surface tension, the presence of a gradient in surface tension will naturally cause the liquid to flow away from regions of low surface tension. The surface tension gradient can be caused by concentration gradient or by a temperature gradient (surface tension is a function of temperature).\n\nIn simple cases, the speed of the flow formula_1, where formula_2 is the difference in surface tension and formula_3 is the viscosity of the liquid. Water has a high surface tension of around 0.07 N/m, and a viscosity of approximately 10 Pa s, at room temperature. So even variations of a few per cent in the surface tension of water can generate Marangoni flows of almost 1 m/s. Thus Marangoni flows are common and easily observed.\n\nFor the case of a small drop of surfactant dropped onto the surface of water, Roché and coworkers performed quantitative experiments and developed a simple model that was in approximate agreement with the experiments. This described the expansion in the radius formula_4 of a patch of the surface covered in surfactant, due to an outward Marangoni flow at a speed formula_5. They found that speed of expansion of the surfactant-covered patch of the water surface occurred at speed of approximately\n\nformula_6\n\nfor formula_7 the surface tension of water, formula_8, the (lower) surface tension of the surfactant-covered water surface, formula_3 the viscosity of water, and formula_10 the mass density of water. For formula_11 N/m, i.e., of order tens of per cent reduction in surface tension of water, and as for water formula_12 N ms, we obtain the second equality above. This gives speeds that decrease as surfactant-covered region grows, but are of order cms/s to mm/s.\n\nThe equation is obtained by making a couple of simple approximations, the first is by equating the stress at the surface due to the concentration gradient of surfactant (which drives the Marangoni flow) with the viscous stresses (that oppose flow). The Marangoni stress formula_13, i.e., gradient in the surface tension due gradient in the surfactant concentration (from high in the centre of the expanding patch, to zero far from the patch). The viscous shear stress is simply the viscosity times the gradient in shear velocity formula_14, for formula_15 the depth into the water of the flow due to the spreading patch. Roché and coworkers assume that the momentum (which is directed radially) diffuses down into the liquid, during spreading, and so when the patch has reached a radius formula_4, formula_17, for formula_18 the kinematic viscosity, which is the diffusion constant for momentum in a fluid. Equating the two stresses\n\nformula_19\n\nwhere we approximated the gradient formula_20. Taking the 2/3 power of both sides gives the expression above.\n\nThe Marangoni number, a dimensionless value, can be used to characterize the relative effects of surface tension and viscous forces.\n\nA very detailed mathematical treatment of this from the point of view of the Navier–Stokes equations and the equations of thermodynamics can be found in the first third of Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar's Hydrodynamic and Hydromagnetic Stability originally published in 1961 by Oxford, and republished by Dover in 1981.\n\nAs an example, wine may exhibit a visible effect called \"tears of wine\", as shown in the photograph. The effect is a consequence of the fact that alcohol has a lower surface tension and higher volatility than water. The water/alcohol solution rises up the surface of the glass due to capillary action. Alcohol evaporates from the film leaving behind liquid with a higher surface tension (more water, less alcohol). This region with a lower concentration of alcohol (greater surface tension) pulls on the surrounding fluid more strongly than the regions with a higher alcohol concentration (lower in the glass). The result is the liquid is pulled up until its own weight exceeds the force of the effect, and the liquid drips back down the vessel's walls. This can also be easily demonstrated by spreading a thin film of water on a smooth surface and then allowing a drop of alcohol to fall on the center of the film. The liquid will rush out of the region where the drop of alcohol fell.\n\nUnder earth conditions, the effect of gravity causing natural convection in a system with a temperature gradient along a fluid/fluid interface is usually much stronger than the Marangoni effect. Many experiments (ESA MASER 1-3) have been conducted under microgravity conditions aboard sounding rockets to observe the Marangoni effect without the influence of gravity. Research on heat pipes performed on the International Space Station revealed that whilst heat pipes exposed to a temperature gradient on Earth cause the inner fluid to evaporate at one end and migrate along the pipe, thus drying the hot end, in space (where the effects of gravity can be ignored) the opposite happens and the hot end of the pipe is flooded with liquid. This is due to the Marangoni effect, together with capillary action. The fluid is drawn to the hot end of the tube by capillary action. But the bulk of the liquid still ends up as a droplet a short distance away from the hottest part of the tube, explained by Marangoni flow. The temperature gradients in axial and radial directions makes the fluid flow away from the hot end and the walls of the tube, towards the center axis. The liquid forms a droplet with a small contact area with the tube walls, a thin film circulating liquid between the cooler droplet and the liquid at the hot end.\n\nThe effect of the Marangoni effect on heat transfer in the presence of gas bubbles on the heating surface (e.g., in subcooled nucleate boiling) has long been ignored, but it is currently a topic of ongoing research interest because of its potential fundamental importance to the understanding of heat transfer in boiling.\n\nA familiar example is in soap films: the Marangoni effect \"stabilizes\" soap films. Another instance of the Marangoni effect appears in the behavior of convection cells, the so-called Bénard cells.\n\nOne important application of the Marangoni effect is the use for drying silicon wafers after a wet processing step during the manufacture of integrated circuits. Liquid spots left on the wafer surface can cause oxidation that damages components on the wafer. To avoid spotting, an alcohol vapor (IPA) or other organic compound in gas, vapor, or aerosol form is blown through a nozzle over the wet wafer surface (or at the meniscus formed between the cleaning liquid and wafer as the wafer is lifted from an immersion bath), and the subsequent Marangoni effect causes a surface-tension gradient in the liquid allowing gravity more easily to pull the liquid completely off the wafer surface, effectively leaving a dry wafer surface.\n\nA similar phenomenon has been creatively utilized to self-assemble nanoparticles into ordered arrays and to grow ordered nanotubes. An alcohol containing nanoparticles is spread on the substrate, followed by blowing the substrate with a humid air flow. The alcohol is evaporated under the flow. Simultaneously, water condenses and forms microdroplets on the substrate. Meanwhile, the nanoparticles in alcohol are transferred into the microdroplets and finally form numerous coffee rings on the substrate after drying.\n\nThe Marangoni effect is also important to the fields of welding, crystal growth and electron beam melting of metals.\n\n\n"}

This has led to some speculation that he was never actually the ruler of Moray, but merely a subordinate of Mac Bethad mac Findláich. (Hudson p. 136).\n\nIn 1020, he participated in the killing of his uncle Findláech. The Annals of Ulster (s.a. 1032) reports that Gille Coemgáin was burned to death, together with 50 of his men. The perpetrators are not mentioned in any sources. From circumstances, two candidates have been proposed to have led the atrocity: Malcolm II of Scotland or Gille Coemgáin's cousin Mac Bethad, who then became the only ruler of Moray. Mac Bethad reportedly married Gille Coemgáin's widow, Gruoch - either as a conquered enemy widow or a widow of an ally and kinsman, depending on who was responsible for the murder. Both scenarios are entirely credible, knowing archaic medieval customs - nothing exculpatory can be concluded from the marriage, whereas the adoption of the stepson may be a weightier indication.\n\nGille Coemgáin was the father of Lulach, a future King of Scotland, fostered by Mac Bethad, whom he succeeded.\n\nIn the animated series \"Gargoyles\", Gille Coemgáin is referred to as Gillecomgain.

Moakley won the seat from incumbent Louise Day Hicks in a 1972 rematch; the seat had been held two years earlier by the retiring Speaker of the House John William McCormack. Moakley was the last Democratic chairman of the U.S. House Committee on Rules before Republicans took control of the chamber in 1995.\n\nMoakley was born in South Boston, Massachusetts, April 27, 1927 and grew up in that neighborhood's Old Harbor public housing project. Lying about his age, he enlisted in the United States Navy during World War II and was involved in the War in the Pacific from 1943 to 1946. After returning home, Moakley attended the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Florida from 1950 to 1951, and he received his LL.B. at Suffolk University Law School in Boston in 1956. In 1958, he partnered with his Suffolk classmate Daniel W. Healy and together they opened a Law practice at 149A Dorchester Street in South Boston. They remained Legal partners into the late 1970s.\n\nMoakley was a member of the Portuguese American Civic Club located in Taunton, Massachusetts. Moakley served in the Massachusetts House of Representatives from 1953 to 1963 and in the Massachusetts Senate from 1964 to 1970. He was a delegate to the 1968 Democratic National Convention. After the retirement of longtime Congressman John W. McCormack, Moakley ran for the Democratic nomination in the ninth district but lost to Boston School Committee chair Louise Day Hicks, who gained support based on her opposition to school desegregation. He was a member of the Boston City Council from 1971 to 1973.\n\nIn 1972, however, Moakley ran as an independent against Hicks and defeated her by 3,448 votes. The day after he switched his party affiliation to the Democratic Party, Moakley was sworn in to Congress on January 3, 1973. He was reelected 14 times, never facing substantive opposition. He only faced Republican challengers six times; the other times he was either completely unopposed or faced only minor-party opposition. In 2002, he posthumously received the Peace Abbey Courage of Conscience Award for his unrelenting commitment to ending the war in El Salvador and throughout Central America, and for the compassionate care he gave his constituents in Massachusetts for nearly three decades.\n\nIn 2001, Moakley announced that he would not be running for re-election for his 16th term in 2002, due to his ongoing battle with myelodysplastic syndrome. Moakley died on May 28, 2001, in Bethesda, Maryland. His body was interred in Blue Hill Cemetery, Braintree, Massachusetts. The Hematological Cancer Research Investment and Education Act, enacted in 2002, establishes the Joe Moakley Research Excellence Program for expanded and coordinated blood cancer research programs. He was succeeded in office by fellow Democrat Stephen Lynch.\n\nMoakley was prominent in the opposition to the legislative veto, which became an increasingly popular device in the 1970s. He held up in committee a controversial bill proposed by Rep. Elliott Levitas that proposed to institute the legislative veto as a general feature of legislation. His position was vindicated when the Supreme Court held in \"INS v. Chadha\" (1983) that the legislative veto violated the bicameralism and presentment clauses of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nMoakley led a special panel that investigated the 1989 deaths of six Jesuit priests and two women in El Salvador.

They were born to Patrick J. McDonald and Margarete McDonald, a married couple of Irish immigrants (Most likely Ulster-Scots) whom came to the United States as children . The McDonald brothers also had three sisters. \n\nIn 1937, the McDonald brothers opened a hot dog stand in Monrovia, California, inspired by a local hot dog stand that seemed to be the only profitable business in town, and which primarily served patrons at a local racetrack. However, the stand had few customers after racing season ended.\n\nMaurice decided to open a bigger hot dog stand in San Bernardino, a large working-class town approximately 50 miles eastward, with a population of approximately 100,000 people. After several banks declined to lend them the money needed for this venture, Bank of America finally approved, and in 1940, with $5,000 in capital, they opened a drive-in restaurant on the corner of 1398 North E Street and West 14th Street ().\n\nThe new restaurant proved a success and the brothers were soon making $40,000 a year. Most customers were teenage or young adult males in their 20s who came there primarily to flirt with the carhop young women, or young working families looking for a cheap meal. The McDonald brothers decided that the latter were the ideal customer they wanted to attract.\n\nAfter a couple years in business, the brothers began making plans to renovate their business model based on the lessons they had learned. One of these involved finding a more efficient way to service customers than the carhop young women, who they considered slow, unreliable workers who spent too much time flirting with customers to increase their tips. Another was that hamburgers accounted for a large proportion of total sales. The griddles were much easier to clean than grills and burgers were faster to assemble than sandwiches.\n\nIn 1948, the brothers fully redesigned and rebuilt their restaurant in San Bernardino to focus on hamburgers, milk shakes, and french fries. While this new \"McDonald's,\" situated at the same address, was still premised on most customers arriving by car, its design was unique due to a combination of factors:\n\nThe new restaurant was a success, and with the goal of making $1 million before they turned 50, the McDonald brothers began franchising their system in 1953, beginning with a restaurant in Phoenix, Arizona, operated by Neil Fox. At first they only franchised the system, rather than the name of their restaurant. Later, the brothers started franchising the entire concept, with restaurants built to a standard design, created by Fontana, California, architect Stanley Clark Meston, and featuring Richard's suggestion of the paired Golden Arches, which formed an \"M\" when viewed from an angle.\n\nIn 1954, the McDonald brothers partnered with Ray Kroc. The franchiser took 1.9 percent of the gross sales, of which the McDonald brothers got 0.5 percent. The brothers wished to maintain only a small number of restaurants, which conflicted with Kroc's goals. Ray Kroc eventually bought them out in 1961.\n\nOn November 30, 1984, Richard McDonald, the first cook behind the grill of a McDonald's, was served the ceremonial 50 billionth McDonald's hamburger by Ed Rensi, then president of McDonald's USA, at the Grand Hyatt hotel in New York City.\n\nMaurice McDonald died from a heart attack in Riverside, California, on December 11, 1971, at the age of 69. He was buried at the Desert Memorial Park, in Cathedral City, California. \n\nRichard McDonald died in a nursing home in Manchester, New Hampshire, on July 14, 1998, at the age of 89. He was buried nearby at the Mount Calvary Cemetery in his home city of Manchester. His wife Dorothy died January 10, 1999. She is buried at his side. \n\nIn the 2016 film \"The Founder—\"a biopic about Ray Kroc—Richard McDonald is played by Nick Offerman and John Carroll Lynch portrays Maurice McDonald.\n"}
{"id": "1852587", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1852587", "title": "Douglas C-74 Globemaster", "text": "Douglas C-74 Globemaster\n\nThe Douglas C-74 Globemaster was a United States heavy-lift cargo aircraft built by the Douglas Aircraft Company in Long Beach, California. The aircraft was developed after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The long distances across the Atlantic and, especially, Pacific oceans to combat areas indicated a need for a transoceanic heavy-lift military transport aircraft. Douglas Aircraft Company responded in 1942 with a giant four-engined design. Development and production modifications issues with the aircraft caused the first flight to be delayed until 5 September 1945, and production was limited to 14 aircraft when the production contract was canceled following V-J Day.\n\nAlthough not produced in large numbers, the C-74 did fill the need for a long-range strategic airlifter, in which the subsequent Douglas C-124 Globemaster II was used by the Air Force for many years.\nThe Douglas Aircraft Company began studies at their Santa Monica division in early 1942 for a transport capable of fulfilling the global logistical needs of the U.S. military. Its \"C-74 Project Group\" used their company's DC-4 as a basis and concentrated on enlarging its capabilities. The group's design philosophy was to build a \"no-frills\" aircraft able to accommodate much of the Army's large equipment including light tanks, two howitzers with their towing vehicles, two angle bulldozers, and smaller utility vehicles. This became the Douglas Model 415 and a cost-plus contract worth more than $50 million was signed 25 June 1942 for 50 aircraft and one static test article. There were no XC- or YC-74 models produced.\n\nThis first flight of a C-74 occurred at 1509 hrs. on 5 September 1945 at Long Beach with Ben O. Howard at the controls and lasted 79 minutes. The first C-74, \"42-65402\", was airborne just two months after it rolled off the assembly line. At the time of its first flight, the C-74 was the largest landplane to enter production, with a maximum weight of 172,000 lb (78,000 kg). It was able to carry 125 soldiers or 48,150 lb (21,840 kg) of cargo over a range of 3,400 mi (5,500 km). Perhaps the most notable feature of the C-74 was its cockpit arrangement with separate canopies over the pilot and copilot; the same arrangement was used for the XB-42 Mixmaster. This arrangement was unpopular with flight crews, however, and the aircraft were retrofitted with a more conventional arrangement. During the life of the aircraft, the radial engines were also upgraded to 3,250 hp (2,424 kW) Pratt & Whitney R-4360-49 engines. The aircraft was 31 feet longer than the C-54 Skymaster, and would be 24 feet longer than the proposed C-118 Liftmaster.\n\nThe second built, \"42-65403\", c/n 13914, crashed during flight testing on 5 August 1946 at Torrance, California when it lost a wing during an overload dive test. All four crew bailed out successfully. The fourth aircraft was diverted to a static test article at Wright Field, Ohio and virtually every component was tested to destruction between August 1946 and November 1948. This was done in order to determine the individual components' ability to withstand design loads. The fifth C-74 built was modified to be a prototype for the C-124 Globemaster II, which used the same wing as the C-74, but used a much larger fuselage. This newer aircraft quickly superseded the C-74 in service.\n\nDouglas had every intention to adapt the aircraft into a civil airliner once the war ended. Pan American World Airways began negotiations in 1944. Their civilian model would be dubbed a DC-7 by Douglas (Model 415A) and the 'Clipper Type 9' by Pan American. Pan American intended to use the 108-passenger aircraft for international travel between New York, Rio de Janeiro, and other cities. The major difference between the military cargo aircraft and the civil airliner was the non-pressurized fuselage of the military C-74 and the pressurized DC-7. The passenger compartment was to be outfitted with a lounge bar, dining area and sleeping cabins for night flights. In June 1945, an order was placed for 26 DC-7 aircraft.\n\nWith the need for military aircraft greatly reduced by the end of World War II, the order for 50 military aircraft was canceled in January 1946 after production of only 14 aircraft. This cancellation also ended plans to build an airliner version of the C-74 for the civilian market, as the limited military production run increased the cost per civilian aircraft to over $1,412,000 and Pan American canceled its order. Douglas then canceled the DC-7 designation. The DC-7 designation was later used for a completely different civilian airliner project in the early 1950s, having no relationship to the C-74.\n\nOf the 14 Globemasters built, 11 actually saw operational service. All were used by the United States Army Air Forces Air Transport Command (ATC), and later by the United States Air Force Military Air Transport Service (MATS).\n\nThe C-74 had a crew of five, including copilot, pilot, radio operator, navigator, and flight engineer. Crew rest quarters were included for long-duration missions. Passageways were provided in the wing to permit the flight engineer to perform servicing and repairs while in flight. It could carry 125 fully equipped troops, 115 litter patients with their medical attendants, or up to of cargo. The cargo bay had twin hoists that could be moved on a rail up and down the bay. They could be used to drop a removable belly section to ease loading of cargoes, reducing the need for specialized cargo handling equipment.\n\nThe small numbers of C-74s built meant that the aircraft's service was limited, but it gave the Air Force experience with the operation and utility of large transport aircraft.\n\nThe \"C-74 squadron\" was activated along with the \"C-74 Project\" on 5 September 1946. They were attached to the 554th AAF Base Unit located at Memphis Municipal Airport, Tennessee. The 554th was a part of the USAAF Air Transport Command. The C-74 Squadron's mission was:\n\nThis project was designed to be a \"shakedown\" of the aircraft prior to entering operational service. Training of personnel to conduct this test was to have been accomplished by aircrews and technicians initially C-74 trained at Wright Field, Ohio, and also at the Douglas facility in Long Beach, California. Approximately 30 transcontinental flights were planned.\n\nThe squadron was moved to Morrison Field, Florida in October 1946. This was due to the fact that the runways at Memphis were not stressed to take the large gross weight of the C-74, resulting in some minor cracking to the concrete surface. Operations included two weekly trips from Morrison Field to Albrook Field, Panama using Río Hato Army Air Base as an alternate field.\n\nIn 1947, the 2nd and 3rd Air Transport Groups (Provisional) were formed and the C-74 was declared operationally ready. Humanitarian missions were flown in 1947 that included flood relief to Florida, and Hurricane relief for the southern area of the U.S.\n\nMorrison Field was inactivated on 1 July 1947, and both provisional units were inactivated, the aircraft and support personnel and equipment being reassigned to Brookley Field, Alabama. On 1 June 1948, the Military Air Transport Service (MATS) was formed with the merging of the Air Force's Air Transport Command and the Navy's Naval Air Transport Service. Within MATS, all of the Globemasters were assigned to the Atlantic Division.\n\nOnce in operational use, C-74s began to be used on scheduled MATS overseas routes through the late 1940s and mid-1950s:\n\nAdditionally, logistic support flights for Strategic Air Command (SAC), and Tactical Air Command (TAC) saw the Globemaster in North Africa, the Middle East, Europe, the Caribbean, and within the United States. Two C-74s were used to support the first TAC Republic F-84 Thunderjet flight across the Pacific Ocean to Japan. SAC also continued to use the Globemasters to rotate Boeing B-47 Stratojet Medium Bombardment Groups on temporary duty in England and Morocco as part of their REFLEX operation.\n\nDuring the Berlin Airlift, a single Globemaster (\"42-65414\") arrived at Rhein-Main Air Base on 14 August 1948 and landed for the first time on 17 August at Berlin's Gatow Airfield in the British sector carrying 20 tons of flour. Over the next six weeks, the Globemaster crew flew 24 missions into the city delivering of supplies. Several airlift records were set by the crew in 414 during Operation Vittles. On 18 September, Air Force Day, the crew flew six round trips into Berlin hauling a total of of coal setting a new Airlift Task Force utilization record by flying 20 hours during the 24-hour effort.\n\nDuring the construction of Tegel Airfield in the French sector of Berlin, large construction equipment was needed to build new runways. But this equipment, including a rock crusher, was too big for even the Globemaster to accommodate. The mission was accomplished by having the equipment cut into pieces by welding torch at Rhein-Main and flown aboard the C-74 into Gatow for reassembly.\n\nAfter six weeks of Vittles flights, the Globemaster returned to Brookley AFB. Reportedly, the Soviet Union complained that the Globemaster could be used as a bomber via the open elevator well. The fact that the runways in Berlin were not stressed for the airlifter's weight and the aircraft was not compatible with the corridor's scheduling were other factors considered for its withdrawal.\n\nSupport for the Berlin Airlift by the C-74 changed to flying regularly scheduled flights between the U.S. and Western Germany. This mission was called the \"Goliath\" and was constantly transporting C-54 engines and parts for use in the airlift. Cargo arriving in Western Germany was flown to Berlin in smaller C-47 Skytrain and C-54 Skymaster aircraft.\n\nExperience with the Berlin Airlift demonstrated that the new United States Air Force needed a heavy strategic airlift capability, which led to the development of the Douglas C-124 Globemaster II.\n\nThe invasion of the Republic of Korea by North Korea began another supporting phase of the C-74's career. From 1 July–December 1950, the Globemasters logged over 7,000 hours in flights to Hawaii hauling troops and high priority cargo west toward the Korean War and returning eastward with wounded GIs.\n\nDuring the seven months between July 1950 and January 1951, the Globemasters transported 2,486 patients, 550 passengers, and of cargo from Hickam AFB, Hawaii to the U.S. mainland while hauling just under a million pounds of cargo westward. The C-74s did not fly into Japan, Okinawa or any South Korean airfields. These figures, coupled with the fact that, since 1946, the C-74 had flown over six million miles and 31,000 flying hours without a single injury to crewmen or passengers, give testimony to the Globemaster's reliability.\n\nBy 1952, the C-74 began to experience shortages of spare parts and increasing maintenance problems. It was recognized by late 1954 that the deterioration of the C-74's components was progressing more rapidly than predicted. Plans were made for the eventual retirement of the Air Force's only fleet of Globemasters. In June 1955, the 6th ATS was merged with the 3rd ATS and was flying operational missions with them. On 1 July, the 6th ATS (Heavy) was inactivated and its C-74s and crews were transferred to the 1703rd ATG's 3rd ATS (Heavy). On 1 November 1955, the C-74s were placed in flyable storage at Brookley AFB while the group waited for instructions as to the disposition of the aircraft.\n\nDuring the first three months of 1956, the 11 remaining C-74s were officially removed from the Military Air Transport Service's inventory and were flown one by one to Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona for long-term storage and disposition. Colonel George S. Cassady, who had accepted the first C-74 for the Air Force and who was by then a Brigadier General, was attending a Continental Division Commander's Conference when he learned of the C-74's last flight. Cassady received special permission to pilot the aircraft on its last flight and on 31 March 1956, flew the last C-74 from Brookley AFB to Davis-Monthan AFB.\n\nMost of the C-74s in storage at Davis-Monthan AFB were scrapped in 1965, although four ended in civilian hands, mostly owned by \"Aeronaves de Panama\" (holding company for \"Air Systems\"). The National Museum of the United States Air Force scrapped the last vestige of Air Force Globemasters when they relegated the YC-124C, \"48-795\" (the prototype of the Globemaster II which had been converted from C-74, \"42-65406\") to fire-fighting training in 1969.\n\nNone of the Aeronaves de Panama C-74s ever came to Panama. Instead they were intended for cattle flights from Copenhagen. For a detailed account of these operations, read \"Flying Cowboys\" by Tad Houlihan.\n\n42-65416 through 42-65451 cancelled\n\nThe following USAAF/USAF units flew the C-74 Globemaster:\n\n"}

In addition to the maze, participants are also given mirrors as obstacles, and glass panes to parts of the maze they cannot yet get to. Sometimes the mirrors may be distorted because of different curves, convex, or concave in the glass to give the participants unusual and confusing reflections of themselves, some humorous and others frightening.\n\nThe first known literary example is in Gaston Leroux's novel \"The Phantom of the Opera\" (1911), in which Erik has built one for the Shah of Persia as a trap and later uses a similar trap to protect his lair from his enemies. \n\nThe 1984 movie \"Conan the Destroyer\" with Arnold Schwarzenegger contains a house of mirrors fight, and the 1983 Walt Disney movie \"Something Wicked This Way Comes\" (an adaptation of Ray Bradbury's novel of the same title) culminates in a house of mirrors confrontation. In the fourth season of the show Leverage, in the episode \"The Carnival Job\", Elliot has a showdown with Molly's captors in a house of mirrors.\n\nThe concept has also been used in comics. In \"\", Batman is seen chasing the Joker through an amusement park and into a hall of mirrors.

The salutation \"\"gratia vobis et pax\"\" or \"\"gratia misericordia et pax\"\" is the opening formula of most of the Epistles of Saint Paul, Saint Peter, and Saint John, and of the Book of Revelation.\n\nJesus Christ and the Twelve Apostles quoted the formula from the Old Testament, and they were preserved in the liturgy and Christian epigraphy. Like the \"\"Dominus vobiscum\"\", they were first used in the liturgy, specifically in the form of \"\"pax vobis\"\", by the bishop in welcoming the faithful at the beginning of the Mass before the collect or oratio.\n\nWhen the Confiteor, introit, and \"Gloria in excelsis\" were later added to the Mass, the \"\"pax vobis\"\" and \"\"Dominus vobiscum\"\" were preserved. The form \"\"pax vobis\"\" was employed by bishops and prelates only at the first collect, while priests used \"\"Dominus vobiscum\"\". Hence the \"\"Dominus vobiscum\"\" became the ordinary introduction to all the orations and most of the prayers. Greek Christians have preserved \"\"pax omnibus\"\" and \"\"pax vobiscum\"\".\n\nThere was a certain rivalry between the two formulae \"\"pax vobis\"\" and \"\"Dominus vobiscum\"\", and some councils, especially that of Braga in AD 561, ordained that both bishops and priests use the same form of salutation (for the texts, see the bibliography).\n\nBesides this episcopal or sacerdotal salutation, \"\"pax tecum\"\", \"\"pax vobis\"\", or \"\"pax vobiscum\"\" are used in the liturgy at the kiss of peace. \"\"Te\"\" of \"\"tecum\"\" and \"\"vobis\"\" are the ablative forms of the second person singular and plural pronouns, respectively; both are translated in English as \"you\".\n\nOn such occasions the liturgy contains prayers or collects \"ad pacem\".

It spanned three issues each of \"Uncanny X-Men\" #225-227, \"X-Factor\" #24-26, and \"New Mutants\" #59-61; unlike most crossovers however, the various titles' storylines did not intertwine, but were instead linked thematically as each team underwent major ordeals and drastic changes in their status quo.\n\nThe 1990 computer game \"\" was based on this storyline.\n\n Marvel Comics used a novel approach in advertising the crossover event. A major element within the stories at the time was the public's growing concern over the \"mutant menace\" and Senator Robert Kelly's proposed Mutant Registration Act, which foreshadowed the dystopian future shown in \"Days of Future Past\". Marvel distributed postcard-size mock advertisements supporting the act in comic book stores as well as their various titles cover dated \"November 1987\". Asking \"Do You Know What Your Children Are?\", the card further suggested that anyone who knew themselves to be a mutant should fill out the form on the back and mail it in to register themselves with the government.\n\n\"The Fall of the Mutants\" consists of three separate non-intersecting storylines: one involving the X-Men, one involving X-Factor, and the other concerning the New Mutants.\n\nThe X-Men head to Dallas, Texas in search of their missing and de-powered leader Storm, herself seeking the mutant inventor Forge to restore her powers. Upon arrival, they encounter Freedom Force, a government-sanctioned strike team of reformed villains led by Mystique, who are under orders to arrest the X-Men for refusing to comply with the Mutant Registration Act, and a fight ensues. Freedom Force's mutant precognitive Destiny then has a vision: everyone inside a particular Dallas skyscraper at dawn will be dead. Once it begins snowing — in Texas, in the middle of summer — and as cavemen, dinosaurs, and other strange peoples and creatures begin appearing, the two teams realize that something of immense significance is occurring. Calling a temporary truce, they turn to restore order to the chaos engulfing the city. Many of the events are broadcast on television by a reporter Neal Conan and cameraman Manoli Wetherell, who accompany the X-Men and Freedom Force.\n\nStorm and Forge meanwhile find themselves in a pristine, natural world all to themselves. In this new Earth, time proceeds at an accelerated rate, and while only a few moments pass in the main reality, a year does for them. Storm, still hating the man she once loved (as Forge invented the Neutralizer gun that removed her mutant powers), spends most of the year in solitude until she is finally ready to make her peace with him. Forge meanwhile had been developing technology from the ground up, eventually creating the tools — and with circuitry sourced from dismantling his bionic arm and leg — enabling him to build a device that restores Storm's weather manipulation powers. Storm, after months of being grounded, takes to the skies again with joy. Forge uses his shamanic magic in conjunction with her lightning bolts to open a portal back to Dallas.\n\nTime and space meanwhile run amok in the city, as the X-Men and Freedom Force find themselves amidst a scene from the Vietnam War. It is revealed that during his tour of duty, Forge had used his shamanic powers to summon a demon to avenge his fallen comrades. However, in his naiveté, he did not realize that the spell required the souls of his nine comrades and unleashed a horde of demons he had no way to control, including the Adversary, the creature responsible for the chaos they now found themselves in.\n\nAs Storm and Forge join the battle, it quickly becomes apparent that the Adversary cannot be defeated, and the only way to be rid of him is for Forge to cast the same spell and seal him away forever. Millions watch the television broadcast (including a horrified Kitty Pryde) as Forge casts the spell, using the souls of the nine X-Men (Storm, Wolverine, Colossus, Longshot, Rogue, Dazzler, Psylocke, Havok, and Cyclops' estranged wife Madelyne Pryor) to fuel it. As foreseen by Destiny, the X-Men die. However, the goddess Roma, who had also become embroiled in the day's events, takes pity on the X-Men for their noble sacrifice and returns them all to life, additionally commenting to them that as foul and evil as the Adversary is, he should not and cannot be locked away forever, since from the chaos he creates positive change and growth occurs. However, he was bound for an age, which Roma decreed was sufficient punishment for his crime. She additionally made the X-Men invisible to all forms of surveillance save plain sight, thus allowing them to continue with their operations while the world assumes they are dead. Believing that if the world thinks the X-Men are dead they will have the freedom to fight their enemies without the people they cared for being hurt as collateral damage. Before they head to Australia to establish a new base, she gives them the Siege Perilous, telling them they could use it to 'reset' time should they be discovered.\n\nX-Factor (Cyclops, Marvel Girl, Beast, Iceman and Caliban) is transported to the Ship of the villain Apocalypse. Offered a place by his side in his evolutionary war against humans, they refuse, and a battle ensues between X-Factor and his Four Horsemen. The horseman Death then reveals himself to be their former teammate Angel, thought dead and now remade in Apocalypse's image with deadly, razor-sharp wings. He quickly defeats the team and they are restrained save for Caliban, who surrenders himself to Apocalypse in return for powers like Death. Apocalypse then unleashes his Horsemen on New York City and tries to force the heroes to watch. They are able to break free of their restraints, and attempt to stop the Horseman. In the process, they accidentally cause Apocalypse's airship to lose control, damaging several skyscrapers as it loses altitude. The preteen superhero team Power Pack helps limit the damage, destroying part of the airship's engine cowling just before the cowling would have impacted the Statue of Liberty. As the team battles the Horsemen, Iceman comes up with an idea to stop Death, and creates a statue of himself out of ice. Death attacks and breaks the statue and, thinking it is actually Iceman, is overcome with guilt and switches sides. Apocalypse easily repels his attacks, but decides to make a tactical withdrawal anyway. After he leaves, the team attempts to regain control of Apocalypse's airship, eventually bringing it to land on top of their headquarters, crushing it.\n\nThe New Mutants (Cannonball, Cypher, Magik, Mirage, Sunspot, Warlock, and Wolfsbane) head off to visit their friend Bird-Brain on his remote island. There, they quickly discover that Bird-Brain's creator, the Ani-Mator, is creating more semi-sentient creatures (the Ani-Mates), which he mistreats and experiments on. As the team attempts to free them, the anti-mutant organization known as The Right tracks them down and attacks. During the three-pronged battle, Cypher is shot and killed, taking a bullet meant for Wolfsbane. Eventually, Bird-Brain defeats the Ani-Mator and becomes king of the Ani-Mates, and Magik teleports the Right's soldiers, along with the Ani-Mator himself, to Limbo. They then return home, where Magneto (headmaster of the Xavier School in Professor X's absence) blames humanity for Cypher's death. Disgusted, the team quits Magneto's tutelage, while deciding to stay dedicated to Professor X's dream of peace.\n\nWhile not officially part of the crossover, a number of other Marvel comic books were billed as \"Fall of the Mutants\" Tie-Ins:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe storyline has been collected into a trade paperback:\n\n\nIt has also been collected into an oversized hardcover:\n\n\nThe oversized hardcover has been split into two trade paperbacks:\n\n\n\n"}

There he coached future NFL great Jack Lambert, current college head coach Nick Saban of Alabama, and former head coach Gary Pinkel of Missouri. During his four seasons at Kent, the Golden Flashes won their only Mid-American Conference (MAC) title in 1972, and played in their first bowl game, the Tangerine Bowl. The 1973 team posted the best record in program history at 9–2.\n\nIn December 1974, James was hired by University of Washington (UW) athletic director Joseph Kearney to succeed as head coach of the His original contract was for four years, starting at $28,000 per year.\n\nLike Owens, James served as Husky head coach for 18 seasons, from 1975 until August 1993.

Among them, starting quarterback Billy Joe Hobert had received a series of loans totaling $50,000 made by a friend's father-in-law. While it was later determined the loan was neither an NCAA violation nor an institutional violation, this was the first in a series of reports by the \"Seattle Times\" and \"Los Angeles Times\" that initiated Pacific-10 Conference and NCAA investigations.

The Huskies received sanctions from both the NCAA and Pacific-10 Conference.\n\nThough notably James and the coaching staff were not specifically cited as having broken any rules, James resigned from his head coaching position on August 22, 1993, in protest of what were considered unfair sanctions against his team for minor, unsubstantiated, or fabricated infractions. James later clarified he was protesting what was a betrayal by then University President William Gerberding. Though he and then Athletic Director Barbara Hedges had presented James the final list of penalties that all Pac-10 parties had agreed best for the football program and athletics, Gerberding argued in favor of altering the penalties against the program from a two-year TV revenue ban and one-year bowl ban, to a one-year TV revenue ban and two-year \n\nIn a 2006 interview with columnist Blaine Newnham of \"The Seattle Times\", James said his resignation from head coaching \"probably saved \n\nJames married his high school sweetheart, Carol Hoobler, a Massillon native who followed James to Miami where she became a cheerleader.

It uses specially coated recordable CD and DVD media to produce laser-etched labels with text or graphics, as opposed to stick-on labels and printable discs. Although HP is no longer developing the technology, it is still maintained and supported by a number of independent enthusiasts.\n\nThe LightScribe method uses the laser in a way similar to when plain data are written to the disc; a greyscale image of the label is etched onto the upper side of the disc. In the beginning, the discs were available only in a sepia color but today are available in many monochromatic colors.\n\nThe purpose of LightScribe is to allow users to create direct-to-disc labels (as opposed to stick-on labels), using their optical disc writer. Special discs and a compatible disc writer are required. Before or after burning data to the read-side of the disc, the user turns the disc over and inserts it with the label side down. The drive's laser then burns the label side in such a way that an image is produced. (see Thermal printing; LightScribe uses a laser instead of a thermal printing head)\n\nLightScribe was conceived by Hewlett-Packard engineer Daryl Anderson, and the coating's chemistry was developed by Dr. Makarand Gore, and brought to market through the joint design efforts of HP's imaging and optical storage divisions in 2004.\n\nIt was the first direct to disc labeling technology that allowed users to laser etch images to the label side of a disc. DiscT@2 technology had been on the market since 2002, but DiscT@2 allows users to burn only to the unused portion of the data side of the disc. In 2005, LabelFlash became the main competitor for LightScribe.\n\nVarious brands manufacture the required media. Dual Layer DVD+Rs are currently the highest-capacity disc to support the technology. There has yet to be any development of LightScribe Blu-ray discs.\n\nCompanies such as HP, Samsung, LaCie and LiteOn have discontinued or are phasing out LightScribe drives with only LG continuing to manufacturing drives; until the manufacturing of LG LightScribe drives was discontinued. , LightScribe.com HP's official LightScribe website has been removed. This has been replaced with the following message:\n\n, the website returns a 404 error. , the website redirected to Hewlett-Packard's homepage. , HP Desktop PCs Customer Support still has an article of instructions and FAQ about LightScribe.\n\nThe surface of a LightScribe disc is coated with a reactive dye that changes color when it absorbs 780 nm infrared laser light. The etched label will show no noticeable fading under exposure to indoor lighting for at least two years. Optical media should always be stored in a protective sleeve or case that keeps the data content in the dark and safe from scratches. If stored this way, the label should last the life of the disc in real-world applications.\n\nLightScribe labels burn in concentric circles, moving outward from the center of the disc. Images with the largest diameters will take longest to burn.\n\nLightScribe is monochromatic, initially a grey etch on a gold-looking surface. From late 2006, LightScribe discs are also available in various surface colors, under the v1.2 specification. The etching is still in shades of grey.\n\nIt is not possible to replace a LightScribe label with a new design (as in erase the surface of the disc), but it is possible to add more content to a label that has already been burned.\n\nThe center of every LightScribe disc has a unique code that allows the drive to know the precise rotational position of the disc. This, in combination with the drive hardware, allows it to know the precise position from the center outwards, and the disc can be labeled while spinning at high speed using these references. It also serves a secondary purpose: the same disc can be labeled with the same image multiple times. Each successive labeling will darken the blacks and increase image contrast (see drawbacks). Successive burns are perfectly aligned.\n\nSpecial storage precautions are necessary to prevent LightScribe discs from fading. HP's LightScribe website warns users to \"keep discs away from extreme heat, humidity and direct sunlight\", \"store them in a cool, dark place\", \"use polypropylene disc sleeves rather than PVC sleeves\", and also notes that \"residual chemicals on your fingers could cause discoloration of the label image\". Such chemicals include common hand lotions and hair care products. Users not observing these precautions have reported LightScribe discs to become visibly faded within two months in the worst case. This drawback makes the technology unsuitable for applications involving continuous handling, and for such popular uses as car music compilation discs, which typically have unavoidable high light and temperature exposure. Since many disc players present internal temperatures significantly higher than room temperature, LightScribe discs should also not be left in disc players for long periods of time.\n\nLightScribe discs may form a visible white powder coating. This is due to crystallization of some of the label-side coating. It is not harmful and can easily be removed with a water-dampened cloth. Wiping the disc with a damp cloth does not harm the inscribed label. At this point, LightScribe support has not explained which conditions lead to this reaction, nor the precautions that can be taken to avoid it.\n\nMultiple LightScribes of the same image increases contrast, but the image quality decreases with successive burns. Noticeable contrast variations are seen in solid shades.\n\nA LightScribe optical drive was used by Maher El-Kady, a graduate of UCLA in 2012 to successfully turn a specially prepared graphite oxide layer coated onto a DVD into graphene. El-Kady and Richard Kaner, his lab professor, used an unmodified LightScribe drive. The disc was prepared by coating the disc with an aqueous solution of graphite oxide and allowing it to dry. Areas of the coating illuminated by the LightScribe laser were turned into graphene. Various shapes can be drawn, which allowed the scientist duo essentially to laser-print an ultracapacitor on graphene using consumer-grade technology.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1852611", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1852611", "title": "Biliverdin", "text": "Biliverdin\n\nBiliverdin is a green tetrapyrrolic bile pigment, and is a product of heme catabolism. It is the pigment responsible for a greenish color sometimes seen in bruises.\n\nBiliverdin results from the breakdown of the heme moiety of hemoglobin in erythrocytes. Macrophages break down senescent erythrocytes and break the heme down into biliverdin along with hemosiderin, in which biliverdin normally rapidly reduces to free bilirubin.\n\nBiliverdin is seen briefly in some bruises as a green color. In bruises, its breakdown into bilirubin leads to a yellowish color.\n\nBiliverdin has been found in excess in the blood of humans suffering from hepatic diseases. Jaundice is caused by the accumulation of biliverdin or bilirubin (or both) in the circulatory system and tissues. Jaundiced skin and sclera (whites of the eyes) are characteristic of liver failure.\n\nWhile typically regarded as a mere waste product of heme breakdown, evidence that suggests that biliverdin — and other bile pigments — has a physiological role in humans has been mounting.\n\nBile pigments such as biliverdin possess significant anti-mutagenic and antioxidant properties and therefore, may fulfil a useful physiological function. Biliverdin and bilirubin have been shown to be potent scavengers of peroxyl radicals. They have also been shown to inhibit the effects of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, heterocyclic amines, and oxidants — all of which are mutagens. Some studies have found that people with higher concentration levels of bilirubin and biliverdin in their bodies have a lower frequency of cancer and cardiovascular disease. It has been suggested that biliverdin — as well as many other tetrapyrrolic pigments — may function as an HIV-1 protease inhibitor as well as having beneficial effects in asthma though further research is needed to confirm these results. There are currently no practical implications for using biliverdin in the treatment of any disease.\n\nBiliverdin is an important pigment component in avian egg shells, especially blue and green shells. Blue egg shells have a significantly higher concentration of biliverdin than brown egg shells.\n\nResearch has shown that the biliverdin of egg shells is produced from the shell gland, rather than from the breakdown of erythrocytes in the blood stream, although there is no evidence that the sources of the material are neither tetrapyrroles nor free haem from the blood plasma.\n\nAlong with its presence in avian egg shells, other studies have also shown that biliverdin is present in the blue-green blood of many marine fish, the blood of tobacco hornworm, the wings of moth and butterfly, the serum and eggs of frogs, and the placenta of dogs. With dogs this can lead, in extremely rare cases, to the birth of puppies with green fur; however, the green colour fades out soon after birth. In the garfish (\"Belone belone\") and related species, the bones are bright green because of biliverdin.\n\nBiliverdin is also present in the green blood, muscles, bones, and mucosal lining of skinks of the genus Prasinohaema, found in New Guinea. It is uncertain whether this presence of biliverdin is an ecological or physiological adaptation of any kind. It has been suggested that accumulation of biliverdin might deter harmful infection by Plasmodium malaria parasites, although no statistically significant correlation has been established. The Cambodian frog, \"Chiromantis samkosensis\", also exhibits this characteristic along with turquoise bones.\n\nIn a complex with reengineered bacterial phytochrome, biliverdin has been employed as an IR-emitting chromophore for in vivo imaging. In contrast to fluorescent proteins which form their chromophore through posttranslational modifications of the polypeptide chain, phytochromes bind an external ligand (in this case, biliverdin), and successful imaging of the first bacteriophytochrome-based probe required addition of the exogenous biliverdin. Recent studies demonstrated that bacteriophytochrome-based fluorescent proteins with high affinity to biliverdin can be imaged in vivo utilizing endogenous ligand only and, thus, with the same ease as the conventional fluorescent proteins. Advent of the second and further generations of the biliverdin-binding bacteriophytochrome-based probes should broaden the possibilities for the non-invasive in vivo imaging.\n\nA new class of fluorescent protein was evolved from a cyanobacterial (\"Trichodesmium erythraeum\") phycobiliprotein, α-allophycocyanin, and named small ultra red fluorescent protein (smURFP) in 2016. smURFP autocatalytically self-incorporates the chromophore biliverdin without the need of an external protein, known as a lyase. Jellyfish- and coral-derived fluorescent proteins require oxygen and produce a stoichiometric amount of hydrogen peroxide upon chromophore formation. smURFP does not require oxygen or produce hydrogen peroxide and uses the chromophore biliverdin. smURFP has a large extinction coefficient (180,000 M cm) and has a modest quantum yield (0.20), which makes it comparable biophysical brightness to eGFP and ~2-fold brighter than most red or far-red fluorescent proteins derived from coral. smURFP spectral properties are similar to the organic dye Cy5.\n\n\n"}

Naganori succeeded his father at the age of nine.\n\nIn 1680, he was appointed to the office of \"Takumi no Kami\", the head of carpentry at the imperial court, but this office was nominal, as were other offices granted to samurai at that time, and only had an honorific meaning. As a \"daimyō\" with a small fief, he was appointed several times to temporary minor offices of the Tokugawa shogunate. In 1683, he was first appointed one of two officials to host the emissaries from the imperial court to the Shogunate. It was the first time he met Kira Yoshinaka, the highest-ranking \"kōke\", the head of ceremonial matters at the Shogunate, who instructed officials in the manner of hosting noble guests from Kyoto.\n\nIn 1694, he suffered from a serious illness. He had no children, thus no heir at that time. When a daimyo died without a determined heir, his house would be abolished by the shogunate, and his lands confiscated; his retainers became \"rōnin\". To prevent this, he adopted his younger brother Asano Nagahiro, titled Daigaku, who was accepted as his heir by the shogunate.\n\nIn 1701, he was appointed for the second time to the same office.

The RCMP confirmed it belonged to Leonard Dyck, a BC man whose body was found near a burning pickup truck south of the Stikine River Bridge in British Columbia. The pickup truck's owners, Bryer Schemegelsky and Kam Mcleod, then just considered missing persons, became suspects in the murder of Dyck and of a tourist couple whose bodies were found near Liard Hot Springs, BC. The RCMP launched a massive manhunt in the surrounding Gillam area, scouring through more than 11,000 square kilometres of dense brush and forest, and conducting searches of more than 500 houses in Gillam and nearby York Landing. After several days of fruitless searching, a breakthrough came through on August 3rd, when a damaged rowboat and several objects belonging to Schmegelsky and Mcleod were found scattered along the banks of the nearby Nelson River. On August 7th, the RCMP confirmed that it had found the bodies of Schemegelsky and Mcleod about 1 kilometre from the rowboat, who died in dense brush of self-inflicted gunshot wounds. They were found approximately 65 kilometres north-east of Gillam.\n\nGillam is located on the southeastern shore of Stephens Lake, a reservoir created by Manitoba Hydro in 1971 by the Kettle Dam on the Nelson River.\nGillam has a subarctic climate with long and extremely cold winters, briefly interrupted by short and mild summers. Its inland position at 56 degrees latitude causes severe freezes in winter, even though its all-time extreme cold temperatures are less extreme than its normals suggest. The lack of warming chinook influences ensures that Gillam is colder than Fairbanks, Alaska despite the fact the latter is eight degrees latitude farther north and a greater distance from the sea.\n\nIn the 2016 Census, Statistics Canada the Town of Gillam had a population of 1,265 living in 436 of its 586 total dwellings, a -5.0% change from its 2011 population of 1,332. The population of Gillam is expected to double to triple within the next 5–10 years, due to several proposed hydroelectric projects in the area.\n\nGillam Recreation Centre offers a movie theatre, ice skating, hockey, curling, a gymnasium, a weight room, meeting rooms, a youth activity room and a library. There are also many small businesses, a small mall, a locally owned pharmacy, grocery store, school (K-12), Canada Post office, Co-op card lock/gas station, Co-op convenience store, Royal Canadian Legion, a train station and a local Royal Canadian Mounted Police detachment.\n\nThe Town of Gillam often has activities and events planned throughout the year. The Winter Carnival is an annual, week long series of events held in March. The Welcome Back Weekend is full of fun activities including the annual firework show which brings out a large portion of the town's population. This is held the weekend immediately after the Labour Day holiday.\n\nPopular summer activities in the Gillam area are fishing and boating on the many lakes and rivers, while hunters search for game animals such as bear, caribou, moose, wolf, ptarmigan and grouse. The town has community parks and playgrounds, and Pumphouse Beach is just away from town. The three hydroelectric dams near town may be toured with a guide. In colder months, snowmobilers have access to hundreds of miles of groomed trails.\n\nGillam is situated on the Hudson Bay Railway line to Churchill and receives limited VIA rail passenger service at the Gillam railway station. Severe flooding in May 2017 caused several washouts, closing the line at Amery and suspending service beyond Gillam. Repairs were delayed due to a dispute with track owners OmniTRAX and full service did not resume until December 2018.\n\nManitoba Provincial Road 280 links Gillam to the rest of Manitoba, making it one of the northernmost communities in the province accessible by year-round road. Scheduled flights to Winnipeg and Thompson are available via Calm Air at Gillam Airport.\n\n\"CBWLT\" joined the province-wide microwave network in the summer of 1969.\n\nCBWLT channel 8 (CBC)\n\n\n"}

Streetcars were pulled by horses. From its incorporation, it was leased to the Union Railroad for 50 years, later passing under control of the West End Street Railway and the Boston Elevated Railway. The Red Line subway, opened March 23, 1912, now travels this route mostly underground, though the streetcar tracks remained for a while, possibly used by East Boston Tunnel (now Blue Line) trains until 1924 to travel to repair yards. The Red Line still travels over the Longfellow Bridge, successor to the West Boston Bridge, on the surface.\n\nThe line beat a rival company by buying secondhand cars from the Brooklyn City Railroad. For the first two months, no fares were charged, making the line very popular, with over 2000 passengers per day within a week. When it started to charge fares, the public was outraged, many calling for the franchises to be revoked.\n\n\n"}

He is also Deputy Director of The Language and Culture Research Centre at JCU. Doctor of Letters (DLitt, ANU, 1991), he was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Letters Honoris Causa by JCU in 2018. Fellow of British Academy; Fellow of the Australian Academy of the Humanities, and Honorary member of the Linguistic Society of America, he is one of three living linguists to be specifically mentioned in \"The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Linguistics\" by P. H. Matthews (2014).\n\nDixon was born in Gloucester, in the west of England, in 1939; and as a child lived at Stroud and later at Bramcote near Nottingham, where his father became principal of the People's College of Further Education. He was educated at Nottingham High School and then at the University of Oxford, where he took his first degree in mathematics in 1960, and finally at the University of Edinburgh, where he was a Research Fellow in Statistical Linguistics in the English department from July 1961 to September 1963. After that until September 1964 he did field work for the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies in north-east Queensland, working on several of the Aboriginal languages of Australia, but taking a particular interest in Dyirbal.\n\nDixon has written on many areas of linguistic theory and fieldwork, being particularly noted for his work on the languages of Australia and the Arawá languages of Brazil. He has published grammars of Dyirbal, Yidiɲ, Warrgamay, Nyawaygi, and Mbabaram. He published a comprehensive grammar of Boumaa Fijian, a Polynesian language (1988), and Jarawara, an Arawá language from southern Amazonia (2004), for which he received the Leonard Bloomfield Book Award from the Linguistic Society of America.\n\nDixon's work in historical linguistics has been highly influential. Based on a careful historical comparative analysis, Dixon questions the concept of Pama–Nyungan languages for which he argues sufficient evidence has never been provided. He also proposes a new \"punctuated equilibrium\" model, based on the theory of the same name in evolutionary biology, which is more appropriate for numerous language regions, including the Australian languages. Dixon puts forth his theory in \"The Rise and Fall of Languages\", refined in his monograph \"Australian Languages: their nature and development\" (2002). Dixon is the author of a number of other books including \"Australian Languages: Their Nature and Development\" and \"Ergativity\".\nHis monumental three-volume work, \"Basic Linguistic Theory\" (2010–2012), was published by the Oxford University Press.\n\nHis further work on Australian languages was published in \"Edible gender, mother-in-law style, and other grammatical wonders: Studies in Dyirbal, Yidiñ and Warrgamay\", 2015.\n\nHis further influential monographs include work on English grammar, especially \"A new approach to English grammar\" (1991, revised edition 2005), and \"Making New Words: Morphological Derivation in English\" (2014). His recent monograph \"Are Some Languages Better than Others\" (2016, paperback 2018) poses a question of efficiency and value of different languages.\n\nHis editorial work includes four volumes of \"Handbook of Australian Languages\" (with Barry Blake), a special issue of \"Lingua\" on ergativity, and, jointly with Alexandra Aikhenvald, numerous volumes on linguistic typology in the series \"Explorations in Linguistic Typology\", the fundamental \"The Amazonian languages\" (1999), and \"The Cambridge Handbook of Linguistic Typology\" (2017).\n\nHis most recent book is \"The Unmasking of English Dictionaries\" (2018), which offers a concise history of English dictionaries unmasking their drawbacks, and suggests a new innovative way of dictionary making.\n\nHis \"\"We used to eat people\", Revelations of a Fiji islands traditional village\" (2018) offers a vivid portrayal of his fieldwork in Fiji in the late 1980s.\n\nIn 1996, Dixon and another linguist, Alexandra Aikhenvald, established the Research Centre for Linguistic Typology at the Australian National University in Canberra. On 1 January 2000, the centre moved to La Trobe University in Melbourne.\n\nBoth Dixon (the Director of the Centre) and Aikhenvald (its Associate Director) resigned their positions in May 2008. In early 2009, Aikhenvald and Dixon established the Language and Culture Research Group (LCRG) at the Cairns campus of James Cook University.

The work, an important liturgical compilation of the Tamil Alvars, marks the beginning of the canonization of 12 \"Vaishnava\" poet saints, and these hymns are still sung extensively today. The works were lost before they were collected and organized in the form of an anthology by Nathamuni.\n\nThe \"Divya Prabandham\" sings the praise of Narayana (or Vishnu) and his many forms. The Alvars sang these songs at various sacred shrines known as the Divya Desams. The Tamil \"Vaishnavites\" are also known as \"Ubhaya Vedanti\" (those that follow both Vedas, i.e., the Sanskrit Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda and Atharvaveda, as well as the Tamil-language \"Tiruvaymoli,\" a work which many South Indian devotees regard as the Tamil Veda). In many temples — Srirangam, for example — the chanting of the Divya Prabhandham forms a major part of the daily service.\n\nProminent among its 4,000 verses are the over 1,100 verses known as the \"Tiruvaymoli\" or \"Thiruvaaymozhi\" (\"words of the sacred mouth\"), composed by Nammalvar (Kaari Maaran, Sadagopan of Alwarthirunagari Temple) and which forms the third portion of the overall \"Divya Prabandham\". Nammalvar self-identifies as a lovelorn \"gopi\" pining for Krishna.\n\nThe collection, once thought to have been lost, was organized in the form of an anthology by Nathamuni.\n\nNathamuni was born in Veera Naarayanapuram (Veeranam) or present-day Kaattu Mannaar Koil. There is a long time gap between Thirumangai Alvar (the last alvar) and Nathamuni. In this dark period, nobody knew what happened to the 4,000 verses of the text.\n\nLegend has it that once Nathamuni heard some people reciting the decad of \"Aaraavamude\" of Nammaazhvaar at Kumbakonam. Captivated by these \"pasurams\" (hymns), he wanted to know more about them. One of the verses also mentioned \"Aayiraththul Ippaththu\" (Tamil: these 10 out of the 1000). When Nathamuni enquired about the remaining 990, the people who sang the 10 did not know anything about the other verses. But as the song mentioned the name and place of the \"azhwar\" (Kurugoor Satakopan), Nathamuni proceeded to Thirukurugoor and asked the people there about Nammazhwar's 1,000 verses.\n\nThe people did not know the 1,000 verses that Nathamuni wanted, but they told him about 11 \"pasurams\" (hymns) of Madhurakavi Alvar, a disciple of Nammazhwar \"Kanninun Siruthaambu\". They asked him to go to Thiruppuliaazhwar, the place where Nammazhwar lived, and recite these 11 \"pasurams\" 12,000 times. Nathamuni did as advised, and pleased with his penance, Nammazhwar granted him not only his 1,000 \"pasurams\", but the entire 4,000-\"pasuram\" collection of all the Alvars.\n\nThe following table shows the details of the 4,000 \"pasurams\" (hymns).\n\n\n\nNalayiram Pasurangal – Audio\n\nSites Relevant to Nalayiram Divya Prabandham\n\n"}

Monahan (born November 3, 1960) is an American screenwriter and novelist. His second produced screenplay was \"The Departed\", a film that earned him a Writers Guild of America Award and Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.\n\nMonahan was born in Dorchester, Massachusetts. He attended the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where he studied Elizabethan and Jacobean drama. He moved to New York City and contributed to the alternative weekly newspaper \"New York Press\" and the magazines \"Talk\", \"Maxim\", and \"Spy\". In 1997 Monahan won a Pushcart Prize for his short story \"A Relation of Various Accidents Observable in Some Animals Included in Vacuo\". Monahan was an editor at \"Spy\" during the magazine's final years, where he would come in at the close of the monthly issue to rewrite articles and improve jokes.\n\nMonahan wrote a novel titled \"Light House: A Trifle\", and Warner Bros. optioned the film rights. In 1999 \"Talk\" magazine debuted, and Monahan contributed a travelogue on Gloucester, Massachusetts, to the first issue. In 2000 Monahan's first novel, \"Light House: A Trifle\", was finally published, and it garnered critical acclaim; \"The New York Times\" proclaimed, \"Monahan's cocksure prose gallops along\" and \"BookPage Fiction\" called Monahan \"a worthy successor to Kingsley Amis.\" In the second half of 2001 Monahan wrote a fictional column at the \"New York Press\" under the pseudonym of Claude La Badarian, which ran for 13 weeks.\n\nWarner Bros. optioned the film rights to the novel \"Light House: A Trifle\". The screenplay adaptation has not been produced. \"Light House\" was released in 2000. A few years later, he bought back the rights and took the novel off the market.\n\nIn 2001 20th Century Fox bought Monahan's spec script \"Tripoli\", about William Eaton's epic march on Tripoli during the Barbary Wars, in a deal worth mid-six figures in American dollars, with Mark Gordon attached as producer. The script was given to Ridley Scott to direct. Monahan met with Scott to discuss \"Tripoli\", and Scott mentioned his desire to direct a film about knights. Monahan suggested the Crusades as a setting, reasoning that \"you've got every conceivable plot imaginable there, which is far more exotic than fiction\". Scott was captivated by Monahan's pitch and hired him to write the screenplay for \"Kingdom of Heaven\". \"Tripoli\" was eventually shelved, but Monahan retained ownership of the screenplay and therefore the right to consider new offers at a later date.\n\nMonahan steadily secured work in the film industry throughout the 2000s. Brad Pitt's production company, Plan B, hired Monahan to write an adaptation of Hong Kong director Andrew Lau's gangster film \"Infernal Affairs\". Monahan respun \"Infernal Affairs\" as a battle between Irish American gangsters and cops in Boston's Southie district, and Martin Scorsese directed the completed screenplay under the title \"The Departed\" for Warner Bros. Monahan's work on the film would later earn him two Best Adapted Screenplay awards, from the Writers Guild of America and the Academy Awards.\n\n\"Kingdom of Heaven\" was the first of Monahan's screenplays to be produced into a film. Monahan had negotiated a production write-through contract for \"Kingdom of Heaven\", which allowed him to be present on the movie sets to make modifications to the shooting script during production. It was poorly received by critics when it was released in theaters in 2005. \"Kingdom\" was critically reappraised when it was released on DVD in the form of a director's cut that contained an additional 45 minutes of footage previously shot from Monahan's shooting script. Some critics were pleased with the extended version of the film.\n\nMonahan's second produced screenplay was \"The Departed\", an adaptation of the Hong Kong action film \"Infernal Affairs\". Jack Nicholson, one of the leads in the film, influenced the screenplay. \"I had written the role as a post-sexual 68-year-old Irishman. Jack is post-sexual exactly never,\" Monahan said later. \"What Jack did is great. Did he change the words? Not any of the good ones.\" Monahan received considerable praise from critics when the film was released in theaters, in 2006, and was applauded for accurately depicting the city of Boston. Monahan used his intimate knowledge of the way Bostonians talk and act, learned from his youth spent in the many neighborhoods of Boston, to create characters that \"The Boston Globe\" described as distinctly indigenous to the city. By the end of 2006 \"The Departed\" had won many critics' prizes. Monahan was honored by The Boston Society of Film Critics with the award for best screenplay, by the Chicago Film Critics Association for best adapted screenplay, and by the Southeastern Film Critics Association with another best adapted screenplay award. Monahan took an unusual route for a screenwriter and hired a publicist to run a campaign promoting his screenplay during awards season. Monahan ended up winning two Best Adapted Screenplay awards for \"The Departed\", from the Writers Guild of America and the Academy Awards. He received an award for his writing in film at the US-Ireland Alliance’s second annual \"Oscar Wilde: Honoring Irish Writing in Film\" ceremony.\n\nIn 2006 Monahan negotiated a first-look producing deal with Warner Bros., which gives the studio the first right of first refusal on any films produced by Henceforth, a production company he started. In return Henceforth received the film rights to produce John Pearson's true crime novel \"The Gamblers\", which Warner Bros. had acquired the rights to.\n\nIn 2007 Monahan was hired to work on two film projects: an adaptation of the Hong Kong film \"Confession of Pain\" and an original rock and roll film, \"The Long Play\". Monahan will executive produce and write the adaptation for \"Confession of Pain\". The adaptation of \"Confession of Pain\" will be produced by Leonardo DiCaprio's production company, Appian Way, for Warner Bros. Pictures. Monahan's other assignment is to rewrite a screenplay about the history of the rock music business called \"The Long Play\". \"The Long Play\" is the creation of Mick Jagger, lead singer of The Rolling Stones, and was nurtured at Jagger's production company, Jagged Films. Martin Scorsese became involved while the film project was at Disney but subsequently negotiated a turnaround deal to bring \"The Long Play\" to Paramount.\n\nMonahan's directorial debut was \"London Boulevard\", released in 2010.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Since his parents have never married, Grimaldi-Coste is not in the line of succession to the Monegasque throne.\n\nBorn out of wedlock as Éric Alexandre Stéphane Tossoukpè, his mother changed her surname to \"Coste\" on 10 November 2004. Daughter of a merchant in Togo where she grew up, she became a student in France when she was 17. She was a flight attendant on an Air France plane en route from the French Riviera to Paris in July 1997 when Albert, a passenger, asked for her phone number, subsequently engaging in a relationship with her for several years until, allegedly, Albert's father, Prince Rainier III, demanded that he end the affair. Coste told \"Paris-Match\" that she became pregnant only after a visit to celebrate her 31st birthday turned into a tryst. Albert provided for and visited mother and child promising, according to Coste, to legally acknowledge the child after a DNA test confirmed his paternity. When he did not do so, Coste offered the interview and photographs to the media. Albert made no public comment on media speculation, being in official mourning following the death of his father. Although he successfully sued \"Paris-Match\" for invasion of privacy, he did acknowledge paternity of the child in a statement issued by his attorney, Thierry Lacoste, on 6 July 2005. In an April 2014 interview Nicole Coste noted that she had legally changed Alexandre's surname to Grimaldi-Coste, adding the dynastic name used by the princely family.\n\nOut-of-wedlock children are not in the line of succession to the Monegasque throne according to Article 10 of the Constitution of Monaco, as amended 2 April 2002 by law n°1.249, which specifies that only \"direct and legitimate\" descendants of Monaco's monarch (or of the monarch's siblings) may inherit the throne. Article 227 of the Monegasque Civil Code provides that if the parents of a (non-adulterine) child marry, the child is legitimized \"ipso facto\" (as happened in 1995 when Princess Stéphanie of Monaco married the father of two of her children). A child born out of wedlock may be legitimated in Monaco: Article 226-9 of the Monegasque Civil Code specifies that \"the legitimization can benefit all children born out of wedlock provided that, by voluntary acknowledgement or by court judgement, their parentage has been lawfully established with regard to their two parents\". The law of the principality stipulates, however, that a child of the reigning prince born out-of-wedlock may only inherit the throne if he weds the child's mother.\n\nOn 26 October 2006, Albert II gave an interview to USA television personality Larry King during which he said his children would not be in line for the Monegasque throne but that they would be taken care of financially. They are also heirs to Prince Albert II's personal fortune, estimated at more than one billion dollars: Upon joining the Council of Europe on 5 October 2004, Monaco became subject to the European Convention on Human Rights regulations on inheritance rights, in addition to its own national laws, which guarantees familial inheritance for children born out of wedlock.\n\nIllegitimate children are nothing new in the Princely Family of Monaco — in every generation for the last 100 years a Grimaldi has had an acknowledged illegitimate child. Some of these have obtained succession rights through legitimation or adoption, including Princess Charlotte, Duchess of Valentinois, an illegitimate child who was adopted by her own father, and who then ceded her succession rights to her son Rainier, 30 May 1944. Prince Rainier III made obtaining succession rights in this manner impossible for the illegitimate children of his son Albert by adopting a new constitutional amendment in 2002, which limited the succession to direct, legitimate issue.\n\n"}

The extension of European imperialism in the 18th and 19th centuries established, represented, and defined the existence of an \"Eastern world\" and of a \"Western world\". Western stereotypes appear in works of Indian, Chinese and Japanese art of those times. At the same time, Western influence in politics, culture, economics and science came to be constructed through an imaginative geography of West and East.\n\nIn \"Occidentalism: The West in the Eyes of its Enemies\" (2004), Buruma and Margalit said that nationalist and nativist resistance to the West replicates Eastern-world responses against the socio-economic forces of modernization, which originated in Western culture, among utopian radicals and conservative nationalists who viewed capitalism, liberalism, and secularism as forces destructive of their societies and cultures. That the early responses to the West were a genuine encounter between alien cultures, many of the later manifestations of \"Occidentalism\" betray the influence of Western ideas upon Eastern intellectuals, such as the supremacy of the nation-state, the Romantic rejection of rationality, and the spiritual impoverishment of the citizenry of liberal democracies.\n\nBuruma and Margalit trace that resistance to German Romanticism and to the debates, between the Westernisers and the Slavophiles in 19th-century Russia, and that like arguments appear in the ideologies of Zionism, Maoism, Islamism, and Imperial Japanese nationalism. Nonetheless, Alastair Bonnett rejects the analyses of Buruma and Margalit as Eurocentric, and said that the field of Occidentalism emerged from the interconnection of Eastern and Western intellectual traditions.\n\n\n"}

She was the third woman to ever serve as a U.S. Senator, and the first from Louisiana.\n\nRose McConnell was born in Greensburg, Indiana. She met Huey Long after she won a cake baking contest that he had organized to promote a product he was selling at the time. After a two-and-a-half year courtship, Rose and Huey were married in 1913. The next year he turned to the study of law, and became a lawyer after passing the bar. They had three children together. Huey Long became a highly successful politician, elected as governor of Louisiana in 1928 and then US Senator from Louisiana in 1930.\n\nAfter Huey's assassination in 1935, Rose Long was appointed to serve in his seat in the United States Senate until a special election could be held. She won the special election on April 21, 1936, to serve the remaining months of her husband's term, but she declined to run that fall for re-election to a full six-year term. Because Hattie Caraway (D-Arkansas) was already serving in the Senate when Rose Long was elected, it marked the first time that two women had ever served simultaneously in that body.\n\nRose Long died in Boulder, Colorado, in 1970, where she lived near her daughter, Rose Lolita Long McFarland.

The founders were Daniel Martin Karcher and Edward Burwell Rich.\n\nThe magazine was intermittently published during the twentieth century, appearing in only 70 of the 100 years from 1899 to 1999. The magazine is currently printed three to four times a year, coming out each semester and when the new students arrive in the fall. In its earliest days, \"The Pennsylvania Punch Bowl\" rivaled the \"Daily Pennsylvanian\", an all-around daily student newspaper, and \"Red and Blue\", which contained a mix of news and literary essays. During this time, \"Punch Bowl\" was distributed in local high schools and leading hotels in Philadelphia and in about a dozen other cities on the East Coast. Since its establishment, \"the Pennsylvania Punch Bowl\" has termed its members \"spoons.\" In 1930, members were split into \"art spoons,\" \"business spoons,\" and \"editorial spoons\"; now members are either \"little\" or \"big\" spoons depending on their seniority.\n\nIn fall 2006, \"the Pennsylvania Punch Bowl\" created a new website, which adds new humor pieces every day. In addition to its regular set of student columnists, \"Punch Bowl\" features new contributors each Wednesday. Recurring pieces in the magazine and website include \"Letter from Amy Gutmann\" and \"March Madness Voting\" \n\nIn answer to a question about his advice for the young, University of Pennsylvania alumnus Ezra Pound refers to the \"Punch Bowl\" in a 1962 issue of \"The Paris Review\". \"In fact the University of Pennsylvania student \"Punch Bowl\" used to have as its motto, \"Any damn fool can be spontaneous.\"\n\nAs a satire magazine pushing the envelope of what is deemed fit for publishing, \"The Pennsylvania Punch Bowl\" has found itself at the center of some controversies. As Charles A. Wright, a member of the editorial staff in the early 1920s, noted: “Part of our planning for an issue was to pick a title that, combined with the cover drawing, would create a ‘racy’ effect. ... Our jokes dealt mostly with campus subjects, such as freshmen, football, absent-minded professors, and coeds; and current events, including the beginning of Prohibition, the wearing of knickers, and the popularity of a dance called ‘The Toddle.’” \n\nIn 1939, ten \"Punch Bowl\" editors were suspended for the printing of ribald humor, causing small riots near 37th and Spruce Streets. Some suspect the \"Penn vs. Cornell\" football game may also have magnified the mass student disturbances.\n\nThe Winter 2008 Issue - \"The Racism Diversity Issue\" - attracted attention and created a minor debate on campus because of pieces inside that certain student groups saw as unfairly targeting or aiming a disproportionate number of jokes at certain groups., The University's campus newspaper later criticized these student groups for their overreaction to the issue. To assuage the offended parties and poke fun at the ordeal, the \"Punch Bowl\" called their Spring 2008 issue \"43% less racist.\"\n"}

In her later years, she was a small fashion businesswoman and a low-profile soap opera actress based in New York City.\n\nEdwards was born in Marksville, the seat of Avoyelles Parish, to Errol Leo Schwartzenburg and Myrl Dupuy Schwartzenburg Elaine was baptized Catholic, and had two brothers, Frank (1928–2013), and Ralph (born 1936). \n\nShe married Edwin Edwards in 1949. Her own Catholic belief was the impetus for Edwin's reversion to the Catholic faith. An observer noted that Elaine Edwards \"wanted the opposite of what Edwin wanted. She hated the fishbowl of politics.\" Both graduated from Marksville High School.

But let's have no misgivings. I’m not a United States senator\". Edwards did not seek re-election. She resigned immediately upon certification of J. Bennett Johnston (whom her husband had defeated in the Democratic primary in the previous year's election for Governor) as the winner of the November 7, 1972 general election (in which Ellender had been a candidate until his death), allowing Johnston to gain seniority over other new senators elected on the same date. \n\nDuring the 1976 presidential election campaign, Elaine endorsed Gerald Ford over Jimmy Carter, while her husband first endorsed California governor Jerry Brown, and later endorsed Carter after Brown failed to obtain the nomination.\n\nIn 1983, Edwin Edwards was re-elected as Governor thus making Elaine first lady again this time serving until 1988.\n\nAfter her senate tenure, Edwards owned a small business producing custom-made dresses and would continue this business even while serving as first lady during her husband’s third term in the 1980s.\n\nShe moved to New York City in the 1990s to find occasional work as a soap opera actress.\n\nEdwin and Elaine Edwards divorced in 1989 after forty years of marriage.

Stensiö or Erik A:son Stensiö)\n\nErik Helge Oswald Andersson, as his original name was, was born in the village of Stensjö by in Döderhult parish in Kalmar County, the son of Johan Fredrik Andersson (d.1907), a farmer, and his wife, Otilia Maria Erlandson (d.1940). He was educated at Linkoping Gymnasium. He then studied science at the University of Uppsala, graduating BSc in 1912.\n\nHe received his Ph.D. and a docentship in paleontology from Uppsala University in 1921 and became professor and keeper at the Zoopaleontological (later called the Paleozoological) department of the Swedish Museum of Natural History in Stockholm in 1923, a position he held until his retirement in 1959.\n\nStensiö specialized in the anatomy and evolution of \"lower\" vertebrates. His studies of placoderms showed them to be related to modern sharks (though, now, placoderms are considered to be the sister group of all jawed vertebrates, in addition to sharks). His first major work, \"Triassic fishes from Spitzbergen\" (part I: Vienna 1921; part II: Stockholm 1925), was based on material collected during his expeditions to Spitzbergen in 1912, 1913, 1915 and 1916.

It won the 1982 Winifred Holtby Memorial Prize. He received a £1000 advance from publishers Faber and Faber for the novel after a meeting with Robert McCrum, the fiction editor.\n\n\"A Pale View of Hills\" is the story of Etsuko, a middle-aged Japanese woman living alone in England, and opens with discussion between Etsuko and her younger daughter, Niki, about the recent suicide of Etsuko's older daughter, Keiko.\n\nDuring a visit from her daughter, Niki, Etsuko reflects on her own life as a young woman in Japan, and how she left that country to live in England. As she describes it, she and her Japanese husband, Jiro, had a daughter together, and a few years later Etsuko met a British man and moved with him to England. She took her elder daughter, Keiko, to England to live with her and the new husband. When Etsuko and her new husband have a daughter, Etsuko wants to call her something \"modern\" and her husband wants an Eastern-sounding name, so they compromise with the name \"Niki,\" which seems to Etsuko to be perfectly British, but sounds to her husband at least slightly Japanese.\n\nIn England, Keiko becomes increasingly solitary and antisocial. Etsuko recalls how, as Keiko grew older, she would lock herself in her room and emerge only to pick up the dinner-plate that her mother would leave for her in the kitchen. This disturbing behavior ends, as the reader already has learned, in Keiko's suicide. \"Your father,\" Etsuko tells Niki, \"was rather idealistic at times...[H]e really believed we could give her a happy life over here... But you see, Niki, I knew all along. I knew all along she wouldn't be happy over here.\"\n\nEtsuko tells her daughter, Niki, that she had a friend in Japan named Sachiko. Sachiko had a daughter named Mariko, a girl whom Etsuko's memory paints as exceptionally solitary and antisocial. Sachiko, Etsuko recalls, had planned to take Mariko to America with an American soldier identified only as \"Frank.\" Clearly, Sachiko's story bears striking similarities to Etsuko's.\n\n\nThe novel was generally well received by critics, many praising the novel's mysterious tone. The New York Review of Books called it \"eery and tenebrous. It is a ghost story but the narrator does not realise that.\" The New York Times said the novel was \"infinitely ... mysterious\", and the inconsistent tone of the narrator, with the graphic imagery in the book combined to create \"the absolute emblem of our genius of destruction\".\n\n\n"}

It is a popular Icelandic liquor and special-occasion alcohol shot, and the traditional drink for the mid-winter feast of Þorrablót. It is made from fermented grain or potato mash and flavoured with caraway, and for this reason can be considered an aquavit. The steeping of herbs in alcohol to create schnapps is a long-held folk tradition in Nordic countries. Brennivín has a taste similar to vodka or Scandinavian akvavit. It is typically bottled at 37.5 or 40% ABV (75 or 80 proof).\n\nThe word \"brennivín\" means \"burning wine\" and comes from the same root as brandy, namely \"brandewijn,\" which has its roots in the Dutch language (also compare German \"Branntwein\" and Afrikaans \"brandewyn\"). A variation of the same word is used in other North Germanic languages. In Swedish the liquor is referred to as \"brännvin\", in Danish as \"brændevin\", in Norwegian as \"brennevin\" and in Faroese as \"brennivín\".\n\nThe product was introduced in 1935, after prohibition ended in Iceland. The bottle contained a white skull on the black label, in order to warn against consumption, later replaced by the map of Iceland. Therefore, it was sometimes called \"svarti dauði\" (black death).\n\nBrennivín is typically served cold and in a shot glass. It is the traditional accompaniment to the uniquely Icelandic \"hákarl\", a type of fermented shark meat.\n\nThe most popular brand of brennivín is produced by the Egill Skallagrímsson Brewery and is packaged in distinctive green bottles with a bold black label bearing the phrase \"The Original Icelandic Spirit\" or \"The Original Icelandic Schnapps\". The bottle's label once bore the letters ÁTVR, referring to Iceland's state-owned alcohol company that once produced brennivín in monopoly, but now features the coastal outline of Iceland.\n\nExport of Brennivín from Iceland to the United States began in early 2014. The American definition and image of schnapps is historically very different to that of Europe and rest of the world. The U.S. label for Brennivin does not contain the word \"schnapps\" as schnapps is specifically defined by U.S. Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau Formulation as a \"liqueur,\" a flavoured spirit product containing sugar in an amount not less than 2.5% by weight. As Brennivin does not contain any added sugar, it is instead labeled in the U.S. as \"Aquavit,\" an approved TTB class and type of formulation of caraway-flavoured distilled spirits.\n\n\n"}

It should not be confused with a similarly named university in the Czech Republic, the Silesian University in Opava (Slezská univerzita v Opavě).\n\nThe university offers higher education and research facilities. It offers undergraduate, masters, and PhD degree programs, as well as postgraduate, postdoctoral research, habilitation, and continuous education and training programs.\n\nThe roots of the University of Silesia in Katowice date back to 1928, when the Instytut Pedagogiczny w Katowicach (\"Pedagogical Institute in Katowice\") was established in Katowice which exist till 1939. In 1950 Higher Pedagogical School in Katowice is established, however, first preparations to formation of what would later become the University of Silesia in Katowice were taken just after the finish of Second World War.\n\nIn June 1962, a branch of Jagiellonian University was settled in Katowice, which concentrated, apart from humanities, on mathematics, physics and law. Together with the Higher Pedagogical School in Katowice, these are the foundations of what came to life on June 8, 1968, as the University of Silesia in Katowice. And so on October 1, 1968, the University (composed of four faculties) had its first academic year inaugurated, providing almost 6,000 students with twelve programmes, such as philology, pedagogics, psychology, history, law, administration, mathematics, physics, chemistry, physical education, electrotechnics and mechanics. Three years later, the branch of the University in Cieszyn was established, and in following years (1974-1978) six new faculties were opened. In the years of 2002 and 2003, last two faculties were established, which had their roots in reformed branch of the University in Cieszyn.\n\nUniwersytet Śląski w Katowicach has facilities in four cities in the region: Katowice, Sosnowiec, Cieszyn and Chorzów. The majority of facilities are in Katowice; the main campus is in the city center.\n\nThe university is in the center of a highly urbanized and ethnically complex region, the Metropolitan Association of Upper Silesia. Heavy industry is a significant influence, and ecological challenges are formidable. The university tries to maintain close links with local industries and Silesian traditions.\n\n\nThe University of Silesia has signed over 600 bilateral agreements with partner institutions in countries all over the world. Among the others University of Silesia cooperates with: Saint Petersburg State University, University of Buenos Aires, University of Alberta, Beijing Foreign Studies University, Tokyo University of Foreign Studies and in the frame of programme Erasmus+ with: University of Vienna, University of Helsinki, Charles University in Prague, University of Birmingham, University of Strasbourg, University of Bologna, Sapienza University of Rome, University of Verona, University of Lisbon, Stockholm University, University of Oslo, Paris-Sorbonne University, University of Zurich, University of Valencia, University of Barcelona.\n\nThe University of Silesia in Katowice has schools of modern languages, natural science, and technology, and a language teacher training college.\n\nIt is divided into the following faculties:\n\n\n\nScientific Information Centre and Academic Library (Polish Acronym: CINiBA), opened in 2012, is a modern scientific library open for students and researchers, but also people unrelated to university or academic activities. Being a joint-project of the University of Silesia and University of Economics in Katowice, most of the materials are freely available in the open space to which users have free access. The library is equipped with modern technologies and information tools, and is adapted to meet the expectations people with disabilities.\n\nIn 2017, Times Higher Education ranked the university within the 801-1000 band globally.\n\n\n\n"}

The legs arising from the first three segments of the abdomen are expanded basally to form broad plates. \"Monoporeia affinis\" closely resembles another benthic amphipod, \"Pontoporeia femorata\", which can be distinguished from \"M. affinis\" by its light red eyes.\n\n\"M. affinis\" is one of the Baltic glacial relicts. Originally a freshwater species, it also exists in lakes. \"M. affinis\" lives on soft bottoms, sometimes even as densely as 10,000–20,000 but usually hundreds to thousands of individuals per square metre. The amphipod has an important role in bioturbation (mixing and oxidating the bottom sediment). \"Monoporeia\" feeds on phytoplankton and decomposed organic matter sinking onto the bottom. \"M. affinis\" is itself the prey of \"Saduria entomon\", \"Harmothoe sarsi\" (a polychaete) and fishes such as cod, herring and the fourhorn sculpin, \"Myoxocephalus quadricornis\". The increasing loss of oxygen in the Baltic Sea bottoms – especially in the Gulf of Finland – has lately been affecting the \"M. affinis\" population, since its eggs and embryos are very sensitive to lack of oxygen. Thus \"M. affinis\" is often used as an indicator species of the state bodies of water.\n\nAfter mating in the autumn and bearing over the winter, the female \"M. affinis\" gives birth to 20–30 offspring, which only happens once during its 2–4 year lifespan.\n\n\"Monoporeia affinis\" was originally described in the genus \"Pontoporeia\" by Gustaf Lindström in 1855. It was moved to the new genus \"Monoporeia\" by Edward L. Bousfield in 1989, alongside two other species, \"\"M. microphthalma\"\" and \"\"M. gurjanovae\"\", which are now considered synonyms of \"M. affinis\".\n"}

It is located in the Loma Portal neighborhood of Point Loma. The school serves the neighborhoods of Point Loma and Ocean Beach. Students who live in Mission Hills may choose to attend Point Loma High School as their neighborhood school. Point Loma is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC).\n\nPLHS is the third oldest high school in the San Diego Unified School District. It was dedicated in 1925 as Point Loma Junior-Senior High school, serving grades 7 through 12. There were 386 students at its opening on September 22, 1925. The first principal was Pete Ross and there were 30 teachers. Some San Diegans opposed creating a school in Point Loma, contending it was too far away from town, but school board member Edgar F. Hastings pushed the proposal through. In its early days the school was sometimes referred to as \"Hastings' folly\". The original three-story high school building was torn down in the 1970s as part of a statewide requirement to make all schools earthquake-safe. It was replaced by multiple two-story buildings. During the 1950s it was converted to a three-year high school with the opening of Richard Henry Dana Junior High School. In 1983 it became a four-year high school. PLHS now draws from six elementary schools serving grades kindergarten through 4, and two middle schools: Dana Middle for grades 5 and 6, and Correia Middle for grades 7 and 8.\n\nThe school holds the distinction of having produced two major-league baseball pitchers who threw perfect games - David Wells and Don Larsen. Only 21 pitchers have thrown perfect games in Major League Baseball history. Wells also threw a perfect game while a student at PLHS. Wells became the school's head baseball coach starting with the 2014-2015 school year. He had been volunteering as an assistant coach for several years. The team's home field was named David Wells Field in 2010.\n\nPoint Loma High School is the third largest of 16 high schools in the San Diego Unified School District. It is a four-year, comprehensive high school, serving grades 9–12. It houses a student population of approximately 2000 students who come primarily from the local community. Approximately 35 percent of the student body participates in specialized programs, such as the Voluntary Ethnic Enrollment Program (VEEP), the Choice Program, the Navy Junior Reserve Officers Training Corps (NJROTC) program, or the Seminar Program.\n\nPoint Loma High School offers a large variety of AP classes, ranging from Music Theory to Physics.\n\nThe school's colors are maroon and gold, although football uniform colors are typically unconforming with their traditional colors of a main maroon with an accent of gold. The mascot is the Pointer Dog. The school offers a variety of men's and women's competitive sports:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Point Loma \"Vanguard\" marching band have gotten first place in the Arcadia Festival of Bands tournament two years in a row making them the reigning champions in their class.\nThe Point Loma Colorguard, which accompanies the Vanguard during fall season, have gotten first place in Winterguard Championships in 2017 over all of Southern California in their class. The Point Loma High School marching band competed in the SCSBOA Field Championships for the first time in ten years in 2018.\n\nThe Point Loma \"Pointers\" football team has won or shared the CIF championship five times in the past fifty years, all under head coach Bennie Edens. In 2005-2006, under head coach Mike Hastings, the Pointers reached the championship game but lost to Saint Augustine High School both times. They reached the championship game again in 2007 and 2009 but lost to Cathedral Catholic High School both times again led by first team All-C.I.F. selection Anthony Joyner and second team All-C.I.F. selection Jordan Sparkman. In recent years the Pointers have had 19 Division 1 football athletes.\n\nThe Lady Pointers went to the CIF Championship game in 2009, defeating many higher seeded teams to get there. The game ended in a tie, with Point Loma winning it in PKs. In 2015 the Lady Pointers soccer team won the CIF Division II Championship against Valhalla with a score of 1-0.\n\nThe Women's Waterpolo won their first ever CIF game in 2018\n\nThe Lady Pointers basketball team was a powerhouse at the state level during the late 1980s, capturing the state championship for four straight years, 1984 to 1987. Their victories inspired a graffiti-style mural at the athletic field. Under legendary women's basketball coach Lee Trepanier, known as \"Coach T\", the Lady Pointers posted an astonishing record of 335 wins and 51 losses between 1977 and 1990.\n\nThe Point Loma High water polo team had the distinction of making it to the CIF tournament, seeded eighth in 2007. In the 2015 season, water polo won first place in their division.\n\nThe Point Loma High men's tennis team won CIF twice, in 2008 and 2009. Their strongest team rivaled teams from all divisions, losing only one match, to Torrey Pines.\n\nThe nationally ranked PLHS sailing team has won the Baker Trophy, the national team-racing championship of the Interscholastic Sailing Association, sixteen times (2003, 2004, 2005, 2010, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2018), making them the national champions in the sport of sailing. PLHS sailing teams also won the Mallory trophy, the national fleet-racing championship, eight times (1993, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2012, 2014, 2017, and 2018), a record unmatched by any other school. In 2003 PLHS Sailor Parker Shinn won the Cressy Trophy, the national singlehanded championship of the ISSA.\n\nThe school became known among skateboarders for an infamous drop called the \"Leap of Faith\". This was a drop of 18 feet, 8 inches, consisting of 27 stairs, that had to be approached by an ollie over a railing. Professional skateboarder Jamie Thomas made this spot famous in his filmed attempt to land it; he landed without injury, but his board snapped upon impact. His attempt was included in the Zero video \"Thrill Of It All\". Another skateboarder, Richard King and several rollerbladers also attempted it, among them Ian Brown, Brian Shima, and Chris Haffey, but no one was successful at landing it completely, and several people broke their legs or ankles in the attempt. In 2005 the drop was blocked when the school installed a new elevator. The PLHS Leap of Faith was included as part of \"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2\", a skateboarding-based video game.\n\nEnglish teacher Larry Zeiger taught a class in musical theater called “Contemporary voices in literature” from 1977 until his retirement in 2007. In the second semester the students became “The Gotta Sing Gotta Dance Company”, writing and performing an original musical show in which all 100+ students took part. The students were all seniors, and “Zeiger’s show” became a beloved senior-year school tradition during the 31 years of its existence. The 2003 production \"\"Sticky Fingers: A Tale of Saks, Lies and Videotape\"\", which was inspired by the :Wynona Ryder shoplifting incident, received national attention. The Performing Arts Center on campus was renamed the \"Larry Zeiger Performing Arts Center\" in 2007.\n\n\n\n"}

Debuted in 1996, the series has only had five games published so far, and after being in the hands of Krisalis Software, Silicon Dreams Studio and Konami, the license now lies in the hands of EA.\n\nKrisalis Software had a strong history of football video games in the past, and inclusively released \"European Club Soccer\", a game that simulated the old knockout format in 1992. With the official branding, Krisalis worked on a 3D engine, fitted with the \"Tacti-grid\" and gameplay in the line of their older games. It had all 16 teams present in the 1996/1997 Champions League with the actual groups, plus national teams. Only one title was produced, distributed by Philips Media.\n\nWith Silicon Dreams Studio, who also developed the \"World League Soccer\" series, \"Champions League\" had four titles, \"98–99\", \"Season 1999–2000\", \"Season 2000–2001\" and \"2001–2002\" released, aimed mostly at the PlayStation, but PC releases existed for the games. It replaced the national teams with finalists of all competitions since 1960, also including scenarios (in 98–99, with fake settings, in 1999–2000, based on the previous finals, including the 1999 final last minutes). The first two games were published by Eidos Interactive, whilst the last two were published by Take-Two Interactive.\n\nIn November 2004, Electronic Arts announced a brand-new licensing deal and further development of the game, which was published before the second round of the 2004–05 competition started. It used the same FIFA engine, and was now the fourth licensed football title EA has in its catalogue.\n\n\"UEFA Champions League 2004–2005\" was released in early 2005 for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, Nintendo GameCube and Windows and had licenses to many leagues in Europe, stadiums including Stamford Bridge and Anfield and also licenses to the players for the clubs. Clive Tyldesley and Andy Gray did the commentary for the game and the graphics and gameplay were taken from \"FIFA Football 2005\", released in 2004. A career mode was made into the game where a player had to win the Champions League with various scenarios. EA Sports Talk Radio - a feature previously featured in games such as \"Madden NFL 2005\" - was incorporated into the career mode, and was presented by Patrick Kinghorn and ex-footballer Tony Cascarino. It was also the only UEFA-based video game to be released for the GameCube.\n\n\"UEFA Champions League 2006–2007\" was released by EA Sports on 23 March 2007. There are four versions of the game, one for the PS2, one for the PSP, one for the PC and one for the Xbox 360. The game modes differ among PS2, PSP and 360. The PSP, PS2 and PC versions were developed by HB Studios while the Xbox 360 version was developed by EA Canada.\n\nThe UEFA Champions League returned to EA Sports in \"FIFA 19\", as EA secured the license after the deal between Konami and UEFA expired. The tournament is available as a standalone tournament mode, in The Journey, Career Mode and in FIFA Ultimate Team related content, with Derek Rae and Lee Dixon as commentators for the tournament.\n\nOn 9 November 2008, Konami officially released the news that they had secured a four-year deal for the rights of the Champions League starting with \"Pro Evolution Soccer 2009\" and ending with \"Pro Evolution Soccer 2012\".\nThe deal allowed Konami to use the details of the UEFA Champions League in a separate game mode within the game,\n\nIn 2012, Konami has had extended the deal for 1 more year to feature the UEFA Champions League again within \"Pro Evolution Soccer 2013\".\n\nIn August 2013, Konami confirmed that \"PES 2015\" will feature UEFA Champions League.\n\nIn June 2015, Konami reached a deal with UEFA to hold the license until 2018.\n\nOn 18 April 2018, UEFA announced an end to their 10 year partnership with Konami following the final in Kyiv.\n\n"}

{"id": "1852841", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1852841", "title": "Meigs Elevated Railway", "text": "Meigs Elevated Railway\n\nThe Meigs Elevated Railway was an experimental steam-powered monorail invented by Josiah V. Meigs (also known as Joe Vincent Meigs) of Lowell, Massachusetts. He wrote an extensive explanation of how the railway worked, complete with diagrams and statistics, which was published in 1887. The weight of the train was carried on a 22 inch gauge track. The train was balanced by an additional set of horizontal wheels which operated against a second set of rails 42 inches above the load carrying rails. A fire, supposedly of an incendiary nature, broke out on the night of Feb. 4, 1887, and destroyed Meigs's car sheds along with the experimental coach and tender and severely damaged the locomotive.\n\nJoe Meigs built his elevated railway to demonstrate the benefits and capabilities of a monorail under widely varying circumstances. A 227-foot demonstration line was built in 1886 in East Cambridge, Massachusetts on land abutting Bridge Street, now Monsignor O'Brien Highway. Never expanded, it ran until 1894.\n\nA section in the act of the Massachusetts legislature authorizing the incorporation of the Meigs Elevated Railway Company states that \"no location for tracks shall be petitioned for in the city of Boston until at least one mile of the road has been built and operated, nor until the safety and strength of the structure and the rolling stock and motive power shall have been examined and approved by the board of railroad commissioners or by a competent engineer to be appointed by them.\" The company built tracks of several kinds: \n\nThe trial road, beginning at the shops of the company on Bridge Street (now Gore and Monsignor O'Brien Highway), East Cambridge, had one curve of 50 feet radius, 165 feet long, on a grade of 120 feet, and on level and curves has grades of 240 feet, 300 feet, and 345 feet. Everything has worked in the most satisfactory manner, the train rounding the exceedingly sharp curves easily, and mounting the steep grades without trouble. The posts for an iron way were made up of two channel bars united by two plates, thereby forming a box-like structure whose cross section may be varied as demanded by location. The posts were placed upon foundations, the plans of which varied to suit the character of the material that may be encountered.\n\nThe way upon which the train ran consisted of a single iron girder 4 feet in depth for each span, placed over the center line of the posts. The girder carried an upper track beam and a lower track beam, upon the sides of each of which the rails, four in number, were placed. The two bearing rails, which carried the load of the train, consisted of angle irons placed upon the outer upper edge of wooden stringers upon the lower track beam. These stringers were placed in the exterior recesses formed by two channel bars properly secured to the sides of the posts. These rails were fastened to each other, to the stringers, and to the track beam by bolts passing clear through. Two vertically placed rails for the balancing or friction wheels were carried by the upper track beam. The distance from out to out between the lower rails was 22½ inches, this being sufficient to insure the necessary transverse stiffness. This was the gauge of the road. The distance between the upper rails was 17½ inches. It was expected to adopt the common form of rail, beveling the edges of the lower stringers and placing the rail at an angle of about 45 degrees. The rails were in the form of a right angle, and the treads of the wheels were made with a corresponding right angle groove. The usual length of post, 24 feet, would give a clear headway of 14 feet, 4 feet being taken up by the truss and 6 feet forming the foundation.\n\nThe switch was formed of a single swinging section turning upon a hinge of great strength attached to one of the posts. A movement of four or five feet by the free end of the switch was enough to permit the cars and trucks on one track to clear the end of the other track. The free end travels upon a carriage provided with rollers moving upon a supporting rail. Suitable mechanism was provided for operating the switch and locking it in place.\n\nThe truck was a development of the conditions controlling the adoption of the permanent way. It consisted of a horizontal rectangular wrought iron frame, stiffened by cast iron pieces and provided with stiff pedestals bolted to its under side, in which was a fixed short axle for the wheels. Each truck had four wheels set at an angle of about 45 degrees, the axles being properly inclined. Between the supporting wheels were two horizontal wheels, one on each side of the upper girder, upon vertical axles attached to the frame. These wheels bear upon the rails of the upper truck beam, and were kept in yielding contact with the rails by springs outside the boxes, and served as balancing wheels to take the side oscillations of the cars. They were formed with flanges that passed under the lower edges of the rails, thus tying the truck to the rails, so that no lifting or jumping could take place, and there was no possibility of the trucks running off the track. The wheels were 42 inches in diameter, had a tread of 3½ inches, and rotated independently of each other. In case any or all of the wheels should break, provision was made to prevent the cars from overturning or leaving the track, by means of a strong shoe, which would slide upon but could not leave the way. On top of the truck frame was a movable iron frame carrying four posts containing heavy spiral springs. These posts interlock with similar spring sockets bolted to the framing of the floor of the car, which was directly above the truck and within 18 inches of the top of the girder. The truck was guided in turning by a center pin, and was securely tied to the car body, as the horizontal flanges of its frame castings overlap the rim of the upper turntable. In passing curves and switches, the trucks turned upon the balancing wheels, placed centrally between the supporting wheels, which were 4 feet apart.\n\nIt has been found that, by reason of the independent motion of all the truck wheels, curves were followed so closely that practically the increase of friction of the cars upon curves even as small as 50 feet radius was too slight to be noticed or measured by weighing in a model one-eighth full size. This construction of the trucks also admitted of a car 50 feet long turning from a street only 28 feet wide into another of the same width.\nThe cars possessed many novel features, both outside and inside. The circular section and rounded ends admitted of the strongest possible construction without an overweight of material. The floor consists of a platform made of 5 inch channel beams, and was 7½ feet wide by 51 feet 2 inches long. The framing of the body was of light T iron ribs, bent in a circle, filled in by panels covered with rich upholstering, which covers all the interior; the exterior was sheathed with paper and copper. The cylindrical portion was 10 feet 8½ inches in diameter. While adding to the strength, this form was expected to diminish the wind resistance fully one-third. The interior of the car was light, roomy, and pleasing to the eye. The seats were upholstered like the rest of the car, and comfort and luxury have been carefully studied in every detail. At each window was a specially designed device for securing ventilation without the annoyance caused by dust. There was an entire absence of sharp corners, so that, in case of a serious accident, the liability of the passenger being greatly injured was largely avoided.\n\nThe locomotive consisted of a platform car supported upon a truck at either end and housed like the passenger car. The floor was 7½ feet wide by 29¼ feet in extreme length; the tender was 24⅔ feet long, had a tank for the water and a bin for the coal, besides additional room for other purposes. Upon the floor of the engine were, in effect, two complete stationary engines, each connected with a single driving wheel. The boiler was of the locomotive type, was 60 inch in diameter, 15 feet in length, and was placed over the engines, its center line being 61 inch above the floor. There were 200 tubes, 2 inch in diameter and 7 feet long; the grate is 4½ feet square. The crown sheet was arched in shape, and was inclined downward at the back end to allow of climbing and descending grades equal to 800 feet to the mile without exposing any uncovered part to the fire. The cylinders were 12 by 22 inch, and their center lines were placed 18 inch above the floor and 61 inch apart. The piston rods connected with independent crossheads gliding upon steel girders supported at their ends by standards bolted to the floor beams.\n\nThe driving wheels were 44.6 inch in diameter, flanged upon their lower edge like the balance wheels of the trucks, and were mounted upon steel axles 6 inch in diameter, which extend through a sliding box containing the journals. The boxes slid in cast iron ways placed at right angle to the line of the engine, and each axle had a crank keyed upon its upper end. The well known slotted yoke connection was used. The slide valves were of the usual locomotive form. The links were placed in a horizontal instead of a vertical position, and were operated by two bell cranks. The throttle valve, link rod, brake, and coupling rods, and the connection between the driving boxes for producing pressure against the rails, were operated by hydraulic power, although hand levers were also provided.\n\nAdhesion of the driving wheels to the rails was obtained by means of a cylinder and piston secured to the sliding boxes. The engineer was on an elevated platform in the front part of the engine, the fireman being at the rear end. The former had an unobstructed view through the windows of the monitor roof, and before him were five hydraulic cocks, which control the throttle, links, sliding boxes of the driving wheels, the brake, and the coupling rods of the entire train, while just above were steam and hydraulic pressure gauges and indicators, whistle and bell ropes, etc. With an engine thus furnished with provisions for gripping the rails, steep grades became of minor importance, as the steepest possible could be ascended if the requisite power was provided.\n\nOne turn of the cock controlling the couplings divided the train into segments of separate cars, each of which had a brake which acted automatically upon detachment from the train. This partially destroyed the momentum of the whole, and a collision could only take place by a succession of comparatively light blows from the engine and slowing sections of the train, instead of by a single blow with the momentum of the whole train. The brakes were operated upon the balancing wheels of the trucks, but they mayed also be fitted upon the supporting wheels. The action of the brakes could be well illustrated by rails between the rolls of a rolling mill, except that the action was reversed. It was apparent that no slipping of the wheels can take place, no matter what pressure may be brought to bear upon them.\n\nThis system was as applicable for surface as for elevated railroads. It was more cheaply to build than the ordinary road, as the construction of the rolling stock allowed the contour of the ground to be more closely followed. As an elevated road in cities, the permanent structure presented far less obstruction to light and air than the usual form. The center of gravity of the cars and engine was brought as low as possible, thereby lessening the effect of leverage caused by wind pressure. The smooth, even surface of the exterior of the entire train served to decrease the resistance to the wind, and permitted a high rate of speed.\n\n"}

The following list contains the heads of state for all United Nations member states and non-member observer states.\n\nCommonwealth realms, other than the United Kingdom, each have a local governor-general appointed to represent the monarch in the realm's government. Governors-general are frequently accorded the status and privileges of a head of state at diplomatic events when considered as representing their absentee monarch, but not as themselves heads of state. The princes of Andorra each have a representative as well. Hereditary Prince Alois is permanent representative for exercising the sovereign powers due to Liechtenstein Prince Hans-Adam II. They are included in the list and are highlighted in blue.\n\nHowever, in many cases it is not this neutral principle but national rules of protocol that are acted upon, usually by an international event's host nation, as in many bilateral and even certain multilateral occasions. Various international organisations have a system for internal use. Even in the presence of one or more Heads of State, certain occasions are governed by specific protocol, e.g. military. Thus in many cases precedence is given to monarchs over republican heads of state, mostly in monarchies; in some nations, the Pope (himself a monarchical head of state) ranks above secular heads of state, especially in Roman Catholic countries.\n\n"}

She was one of the most successful Punjabi film heroines of Pakistan during the 1980s and early 1990s. She was born in Bahawalpur. Anjuman's parents were from Ahmadpur East, settled in Multan where Anjuman was brought up. She later moved to Lahore.\n\nHer career spanned almost 20 years and she appeared in more than 300 films. She first appeared in the Urdu film, \"Soorath\" (1973) co-starring with Waseem Abbas, Afshan, Taj Niazi, and she gave her last appearance in 2000 in the film \"Peengan\". Film \"Soorath\" was not a success; her first major hit was \"Waadey Ki Zanjeer\" (1979). She had major roles in \"Sher Khan\" and \"Chan Varyam\" (1981) and played a supporting role in film \"Sala Sahib\" (1981). All three were diamond jubilee hit films and were released the same day, a unique record, which she shared with her partner-hero Sultan Rahi, her playback voice (singer) Melody Queen Madam Noor Jehan, and musician Wajahat Attre. Anjuman was a darling of the working classes who went to the cinema frequently. She could dance according to their taste and she had the figure of a traditional \"Punjabi Mutyaar\", which is the ideal of adult males, especially in Punjab, Pakistan.\n\nShe appeared with every hero of her era but with Sultan Rahi she ruled the Punjabi cinema for more than a decade. She also appeared with \"Ali Ejaz\", Javed Sheikh, Ghulam Mohiuddin, Izhar Qazi and Nadeem. Her initial films were in Urdu but the bulk of her career was based on acting in Punjabi films. Her roles ranged from a traditional innocent village girl to modern sexy bombshell, romantic to action-packed films.\n\nAnjuman married income tax commissioner, Mobin Malik, gave birth to two sons and one daughter. Zeeshan, Adnan and Iman, quit films, and lived in the United Kingdom with her family. However, Mobin Malik, Anjuman's husband was assassinated on the Eid day in 2013 while he was in Lahore visiting relatives. During this period Sultan Rahi was murdered on the National Highway in 1996. Lollywood was deprived of its most famous star, Anjuman who retired from her film career in 1995, and the Punjabi film industry virtually ground to a halt for a few years until its revival with Syed Noor's film Choorian (1998 film).\n\nThe second wedding of the actress took place on 17 June 2019 with Waseem Lucky Ali and was attended by only close family and friends.\n\nAnjuman returned to acting in 1999 in the title role in the film \"Chaudrani\" (1999 film). The adoring masses welcomed their beloved 'Queen' home and lifted \"Chaudhrani\" to a considerable success upon its release but soon the golden touch began to fade. Anjuman, however, perceived \"Chaudhrani\" (2000 film)'s success as vindication of everything she had planned. She refused any further character roles, opting only for solo heroine projects and required a lofty salary of Rs. 300,000. She felt that she was in a position to be calling all the shots, but in any film industry you are only as good as your last hit and she was soon to taste the price of stardom. Her next release was \"Jag Mahi\", opposite Ghulam Mohiuddin, in 2000. It had a superb response and ran for 103 weeks at Metropole cinema lahore, ran to packed houses for 75 weeks. Anjuman's next release was a litmus test of sorts and this she succeeded flawlessly. The film \"Peengan\" (2000) opposite the young hero Saud was met with applause by the viewers. Audiences started shouting slogans of \"Sohni Mutyar\" (Beautiful Girl) during the showing of the film. Peengan became super blockbuster and ran for record 202 weeks at Shabistan cinema lahore, 108 weeks at Metropole cinema, 116 weeks at Capitol cinema lahore. It is the only film in history that completed 200 weeks during its 2nd run at Prince cinema Lahore. Peengan became lottery for the producers who have earned 100 times the investment made.\n\nShe was abruptly dropped from the film \"Badmaash\", for which she had already canned two songs and numerous scenes, and replaced by upcoming starlet Noor due to her sudden rise in the film industry. The film producer felt they would be better off cutting Anjuman, and their costs, rather than going ahead with Anjuman as the leading lady.\n\nFurther news arrived that Anjuman's scenes in the film \"Badmaash tey Qanoon\" had also been dropped and edited out of the film, and that she had been replaced by the actress Nargis. This was the final straw for Anjuman, the humiliation proving too much to take. She announced her immediate retirement, that she was just hanging around to complete her on hand assignments, and that she would shortly be leaving Pakistan altogether for a life of anonymity in the UK where her former husband Mobin Malik owned a flat in Knightsbridge, London. Her final two movies were \"Jatti da vair\" in 2000 and \"Ik dhee punjab di\" (Daughter of Punjab), they were huge hits.\n\nHer departure may have been a crushing blow to many of her die-hard fans, who admired the \"thumkas\" (pelvic thrusting dance manoeuvres) of Anjuman. In the 1980s, after the box-office success of Chan Varyam (1981 film), Sultan Rahi, Mustafa Qureshi, Anjuman and the playback singing of film songs by Noor Jehan dominated the Punjabi film industry to such an extent that a film was not considered a viable project unless they were present. Film after film was launched with all the four stars, with different names, but merely repeating their roles from the previous efforts. Nonetheless, the public lapped it up and all three became icons of an era.\n\nAction was the essential element of the Punjabi films; Sultan Rahi gained a reputation as an action hero but in many films Anjuman herself played an action heroine. The audience saw her fighting with bad guys and displaying her powers along with her dances simultaneously in those movies. Some of her action films are . Mela (1986), \"Hunter Wali\" (1988), \"Dulari\" (1987), \"Qatil Haseena\" (1989), \"Daku Haseena\", \"Kali Charan\", \"Sultana\", \"Nangi Talwar\", etc.\n\nShe was seen in action films, riding horses, driving motor bikes and doing stunts thus giving a new dimension to female roles in Lollywood movies, which were previously based on a shy and innocent girl. Plots of Anjuman's action films were based on revenge, although she played a don in \"Insaniyat ke dushman\". Anjuman can be considered as the first established action heroine of the Pakistan film industry. Her viewers not only liked her acting and dances but also her action skills.\n\n\n"}

To rescue her, Higgins must survive a series of 32 stages. There are eight worlds called \"areas\", which are divided into four stages or \"rounds\" each, which are further divided into four checkpoints. When the player reaches the fourth round of each area, he must confront a boss at the end to continue to the next area. The game is completed when the player saves the girl after defeating the eighth and final form of the evil lord.\n\nMaster Higgins (the player character) loses a life whenever he touches an enemy, an enemy's attack, a fire roast, or when he falls into a pitfall or a body of water. The player also has a health gauge that starts out with 11 points, which gradually depletes over time or whenever Higgins trips on a rock in his path. When Higgins' health gauge reaches zero, he will lose a life. If Higgins still has extra lives, he will revive at the last checkpoint he passed through. The game ends when all of Higgins' lives run out. To replenish his health, Higgins can pick up fruit or a milk bottle and has a maximum health of up to 16 points. When the player's score reaches 50,000 points, 100,000 points, and 200,000 points, Higgins will receive an extra life. Finding a bee-like fairy known as Honey Girl will grant Higgins invincibility for about ten seconds and allow him to kill enemies with a single touch. Also hidden in each stage is a special pot, which doubles the player's end-of-stage bonus.\n\nHiggins starts off each life without the ability to attack and can only gain the ability to attack by picking up a stone axe, which can be found in specific spots in each stage. When Higgins is wielding the stone axe, he can trade it for magical fireballs that have longer range and are capable of destroying rocks and rolling stones (which are invulnerable to the stone axe).\n\nTo break an egg, the player must touch it or hit it with a weapon twice. In addition to weapons, there are numerous bonus items inside. There is also the possibility of receiving a negative item, the eggplant, which drains Higgins' life meter. Some of the eggs are not immediately visible in plain sight. The locations of these \"hidden eggs\" are usually indicated when a weapon thrown by a player disappears before falling to the ground and are uncovered by jumping at the indicated spot. Some of these hidden spots do not contain hidden eggs, but instead a cloud that will warp the player to a bonus stage, which is instead uncovered by standing still for a short period of time. During bonus stages, the player can collect a series of fruits (each worth 500 points regardless of the type) until Higgins falls into a pitfall. However, instead of losing a life, he will return to the regular stage at the next checkpoint.\n\nAt the fourth round of each area, Higgins will confront a different form of the Evil Witch Doctor, the game's boss character. He has the ability to change his head by up to eight different types. Higgins must defeat him by striking his head a specific number of times with his weapon. The number of hits required to defeat him increases with each area (his first form requires eight hits and every subsequent form requires two additional hits until the eighth and final form, which requires 22 hits). When the Evil Witch Doctor is defeated, he will change his head and escape to the next area. He uses the same attack in each form, with the only changes being his durability, speed and the speed of his fireball attacks. When Higgins defeats his final form, the Evil Witch Doctor will fall into a pit and the girl will be rescued.\n\n\"Adventure Island\" began development as a direct port of the Sega arcade game \"Wonder Boy\", the partial rights to which Hudson Soft obtained from developer Escape (now known as Westone Bit Entertainment). However, the developer had already signed away ownership of the Wonder Boy name and characters to Sega, so Hudson created a new protagonist modeled and named after Hudson Soft's spokesman Takahashi Meijin. In the western version of \"Adventure Island\", the Takahashi Meijin character was renamed Master Higgins.\n\nWhile the \"Wonder Boy\" series adopted an action RPG system for its sequels (beginning with \"Wonder Boy in Monster Land\"), most of the \"Adventure Island\" sequels stuck to the game system of the original \"Wonder Boy\". Moreover, Hudson Soft also obtained the rights to port all of the \"Wonder Boy\" sequels to the TurboGrafx-16, changing the title and character designs of each game (with the exception of \"\"). Incidentally, the Japanese version of \"Dragon's Curse\" (the TurboGrafx-16 adaptation of \"\") was titled \"Adventure Island\".\n\nThe rights to the \"Adventure Island\" series are currently owned by Konami, who absorbed Hudson Soft in 2012.\n\nThe NES version of \"Adventure Island\" was re-released in Japan for the Game Boy Advance as a Famicom Mini title on May 21, 2004. It was later re-released internationally for the Virtual Console service in 2008 for the Wii and in 2014 for the Wii U.\n\nA remake was also developed for the PlayStation 2 and GameCube titled \"Hudson Selection Volume 4: Takahashi Meijin no Bōken Jima\", which was released exclusively in Japan on December 18, 2003.\n\nTwo sequels were produced for the NES, \"Adventure Island II\" and \"Adventure Island 3\", as well as a fourth game for the Famicom that was released exclusively in Japan titled \"Takahashi Meijin no Bōken Jima IV\". In addition to the standalone Famicom Mini re-release of the first game, all four games were re-released in a compilation for the Game Boy Advance titled \"Hudson Best Collection Vol 6: Bōken Jima Collection\", released in Japan on January 19, 2006.\n\nSequels were also released on other platforms, such as \"Adventure Island\" and \"Adventure Island II\" for the Game Boy (based on the second and third NES games respectively), \"Super Adventure Island\" and \"Super Adventure Island II\" for the Super NES, \"New Adventure Island\" for the TurboGrafx-16, \"\" for the Wii, \"Gacha wa shi Meijin no Bōken Jima\" in 2007 for mobile, and \"Adventure Island Quest by Takahashi Meijin\" in 2010 for mobile.\n\nTakahashi Meijin appears as a playable character in the crossover fighting game \"DreamMix TV World Fighters\", released in Japan for GameCube on December 13, 2003.\n\nTakahashi Meijin also appears in the sport mobile game \"Gachapin & Mukku no Dai Undoukai\" (\"Gachapin & Mukku's Big Sports Day\") in 2008, and crosses over with Katamari franchise in the mobile game \"Takahashi Meijin and Katamari Damacy\" in 2010.\n\n\n\n\"Adventure Island\" has received positive to mixed reviews from critics. \"GameSpot\" awarded the game 6.5 out of 10, calling it a \"fast-paced, challenging platformer\". \"GamesRadar+\" ranked it the 23rd best NES game ever made. The staff praised it for the fact that its challenge comes from quality level design and not low quality.\n\n"}

His roots was the Hosokawa clan at Awa Province. His childhood name was Rokuro (六郎).\n\nMasamoto did not have his own child and originally had decided to let Hosokawa Sumiyuki, who was from Kujyō clan, succeed the house. However, he changed his mind later and decided to let Sumimoto, who was adopted after Sumiyuki, succeed the house. This naturally caused a rift between Sumimoto and Sumiyuki.\n\nIn 1507, Masamoto was killed by an adherent of Sumiyuki. Sumimoto was attacked by a retainer of Sumiyuki, Kozai Motonaga, and escaped to Koga, Ōmi Province, taking refuge at Rokkaku Takayori. Following this, a powerful vassal under the Hosokawa, known as Miyoshi Yukinaga (Nagateru), raised troops in Settsu and destroyed Sumiyuki in the young Sumimoto's name. After repulsing Sumiyuki, Sumimoto succeeded the house in proper form.\n\nHe and Hosokawa Takakuni, who was from a branch of Hosokawa clan and also another foster son of Masamoto, supported Ashikaga Yoshizumi, who was backed up to the 11th \"shōgun\" by Masamoto. In 1493, Masamoto had deposed the 10th Shōgun Ashikaga Yoshiki (Yoshitane), who later escaped from confinement and fled to eastern countries, looking for a chance to regain his position.\n\nIn 1508, Ōuchi Yoshioki, who then harbored Yoshiki, marched his armies into Kyoto and returned Yoshiki back to the seat of Shōgun. The relationship between Sumimoto and Takakuni was no longer in harmony, and while Takakuni acted in concert with Yoshioki, Sumimoto was exiled to Ōmi Province. Sumimoto intended to battle Yoshioki in the province of Settsu, but ended up fleeing to Awa after seeing the superior numbers of Yoshioki's army.\n\nIn 1511, Sumitomo returned to Kyoto but was defeated by Takakuni and the Ōuchi at Funaokayama and fled once more. The death of Yoshizumi was another shock to the camp of Sumimoto.\n\nŌuchi Yoshioki left the capital in 1518 to maintain his own dominion, and regarding this as a chance, Sumimoto attempted another movement on Kyoto in the next year, cooperating with Miyoshi Yukinaga. However, Yukinaga was attacked and defeated by Hosokawa Takakuni and the clan of Rokkaku, who were then at the side of Ashikaga Yoshiki. Yukinaga was caught and forced to die by seppuku. Sumimoto was ill and had not advanced to Kyoto. After Yukinaga's defeat, he escaped again to his home province of Awa and died soon afterward.\n\n"}

In Ikeda, Tokushima Prefecture it turns to the east again and pours into the Kii Channel at the north of Tokushima city. Its major tributaries include Ananai, Iya, Dōzan, Sadamitsu, and Anabuki.\n\nThe river has some \"submerged bridges\" (潜水橋 \"Sensuikyō\"), equivalents of \"Chinkabashi\" of the Shimanto, which lack parapets in order not to be washed away by floods. Reconstruction of the Yoshino Daiju Dam (吉野川第十堰 \"Yoshino-gawa Daijūzeki\") near its mouth provoked much controversy among environmentalists.\n\n"}

It featured Christian Slater as Brian Kelly, a 16-year-old skateboarder investigating the death of his adopted Vietnamese brother.\n\nThe skating technical advisor for the film was original Z-Boy Stacy Peralta. Among the skateboarders who appear in the film as stunt skaters are Mike McGill, \"Gator\" Mark Rogowski, Rodney Mullen, Rich Dunlop, Eric Dressen, Lance Mountain, Mike Vallely, Chris Black, Ted Ehr, Natas Kaupas, Chris Borst, and Steve Saiz. Tony Hawk (Buddy) and Tommy Guerrero (Sam), then members of the Bones Brigade, appear in the film as members of Brian's skate crew. Future lead singer of The Aquabats and creator of \"Yo Gabba Gabba!\", Christian Jacobs, also appears in the film as Gremic.\n\nThe film received a moderate release in the United States from 20th Century Fox (in 469 theaters). Although the film had a relatively low box office turnout, it garnered a significant cult following after its theatrical release, through basic cable replays on networks such as USA and the burgeoning VHS (and later DVD) market, as well as among skateboarders.\n\nThe title of the film refers to the cryptic question \"Have you ever gleemed [sic] inside a cube?\" that Garry Scott Davis (GSD) asked Neil Blender in an interview in the December 1983 issue of \"Thrasher\" magazine. In the film, Christian Slater's character defines \"gleaming the cube\" as \"pushing your limits to the edge\". The DVD contains an easter egg; by highlighting the skateboard on the main menu, viewers can watch a short featurette entitled \"What Does Gleaming the Cube Mean?\".\n\nBrian Kelly is an underachieving high school student in Orange County, California. An avid skateboarder, Brian is frequently at odds with his parents for his increasingly reckless behavior, which has landed him in jail on more than one occasion. The only person in the family Brian can relate to is his adopted Vietnamese brother Vinh, who works as a shipping clerk for the Vietnamese Anti-Communist Relief Fund (VACRF), an organization which sends medical supplies to Vietnam.\n\nWhen Vinh discovers a suspicious inaccuracy in VACRF's shipping records, he brings it to his boss Colonel Trac, who dismisses the matter as a clerical error, then fires Vinh when he tries to investigate. Undeterred, Vinh sneaks into Westpac Medical Supplies, the warehouse handling VACRF's shipping, but is apprehended by owner Ed Lawndale. Vinh is interrogated by Lawndale and Bobby Nguyen, another of Colonel Trac's employees, at a motel. When Colonel Trac arrives, it is revealed that he and Lawndale are conspirators in a scheme to smuggle illegal weapons to Vietnam. Convinced that Vinh poses no threat to their operation, Trac intends to set him free, but Vinh is strangled to death by Nguyen. They hang Vinh's body from a noose, so the police deem it a suicide.\n\nAfter the funeral, Brian finds the list of medical supplies Vinh was investigating, written in Vietnamese. Looking for someone to translate it, he encounters Bobby Nguyen who starts to follow him. Brian sneaks into the backseat of Nguyen’s car and witnesses a meeting with Trac and Lawndale, in which Nguyen demands $50,000 and a ticket to Bangkok, but a struggle ensues and Lawndale kills Nguyen. Brian flees to notify the police, but they find no trace of the crime and later learn that Nguyen supposedly arrived in Thailand. Brian tries to convince Detective Al Lucero that his brother did not commit suicide. While skeptical, Lucero offers to look into it.\n\nAs Brian's suspicion of Colonel Trac grows, he reaches out to Trac's daughter Tina, a fellow high school student and Vinh's ex-girlfriend. After an image makeover, Brian asks her out on a date and the two become closer. He attends one of VACRF's social functions, where he notices Lawndale and learns of his connection to Trac and Westpac. Following in his brother's footsteps, Brian sneaks into Lawndale's warehouse and uncovers a shipping crate full of weapons. \n\nBrian causes an explosion at the warehouse and plants evidence to incriminate Trac, but Lucero immediately suspects Brian and admonishes him for the act. However, the incident causes Trac to panic and send his wife and daughter away to his brother's house. A distressed Tina spends the night with Brian instead and discovers a lighter belonging to her father in Brian's room, leading Brian to explain all his suspicions to her. Tina angrily confronts her father about the conspiracy, who is shamed by his involvement and contacts Lawndale to end the operation. In response, Lawndale sends a group of Vietnamese motorcyclists to run Brian down on the street. The police manage to apprehend the bikers and, with the aid of an interpreter, Lucero is able to confirm Lawndale's role in the attack.\n\nBrian visits his friend Yabbo, who builds a newer, faster skateboard for Brian and rallies the rest of the skateboarding clique. Brian and the police both converge upon Colonel Trac's house, where Lawndale holds Tina at gunpoint. When Trac tries to wrestle the gun away, Brian crashes into the room through the window, but Lawndale shoots and kills Trac then escapes in a police car. Brian, Lucero, and the entire skateboarding crew eventually corner Lawndale. As Lawndale prepares to shoot Brian, he soars into the air on his skateboard and knocks Lawndale out.\n\nBrian comforts Tina about her father's death and suggests that they return to school together, implying that their relationship will continue. Afterwards, Brian and Lucero visit Vinh's grave before driving away.\n\n\n\nIn the \"Simpsons\" episode \"Lemon of Troy\", Bart and a young Shelbyville boy skate past a female doppelganger of Groundskeeper Willy, who screams after them, \"Slow down, ya sidewalk surfin, cube gleamers!\" The movie is referenced again in the episode \"To Surveil with Love\" when Ned Flanders tells Bart to \"Stop gleaming that cube!\" as he is watching Bart skateboard down the sidewalk.\n\nIn the Season 2 premiere of \"Robot Chicken\", Christian Slater plays a zombie skater named Skater McGee, who gets kids to try an incredibly hard trick called the \"Monster Cookie Pinwheel\", which he claims to have died attempting. When asked by the skaters what a Monster Cookie Pinwheel is, Skater McGee replies with, \"A monster cookie pinwheel is when you skate up to a locomotives cow catch, you 360 punk buster to the second car, do a lemonade hand stand on the third car, a whipping-post ollie to the fourth car, a demon stomper on the fifth car, and a gleaming the cube off the sixth car, before dismounting the train.\" They then attempt the trick, but fail miserably, being hit and killed by the train immediately- something planned for by McGee, as the zombie look is then revealed to be a disguise, thought up by the town mayor as a successful attempt to rid the town of unruly skateboarders.\n\nA reference to \"gleaming the cube\" was also made in season 3 of the show \"The Goldbergs\" when Erica asks Barry's friend Geoff, \"What does that even mean?\" as he took off on his skateboard.\n\nIn season 4, episode 5 of \"South Park\", when Cartman searches the internet for older, more mature friends, the computer screen shows that three chat rooms above the one he eventually joined (Men Who Like Young Boys) is a chat room called \"Gleaming The Cube\". \n\nThe 2010 skateboarding video game \"Skate 3\" featured a mission with a name parodying the movie's title, Teaming the Kube, the Kube being an area in the game.\n\nA season two episode of the Netflix original series \"\" makes a word-play reference to the film. Episode four is titled \"Greening the Cube.\"\n\nThe film is referenced in the dialogue in \"The Lego Batman Movie\".\n\nProfessional skateboarder Stevie Williams has stated in an online interview that Slater's character in the film was his first skateboarding influence.\n\nSkateboarding figure Tony Hawk, in a 2008 interview with Slater, revealed that he is continually asked if Slater actually skated in the film. Hawk has remained in contact with Slater well beyond the production of the film.\n\n"}

Born in Belfast, he started his career at Manchester United before playing more than 150 games for Norwich City and was a Northern Ireland international. After his retirement from football in 2008 Mulryne began studying for the Roman Catholic priesthood. He was ordained as a deacon in October 2016 and then as a priest on 8 July 2017.\n\nMulryne began his career as a youth team player at Manchester United in 1994. He was in the FA Youth Cup winning team of 1995, and became a Northern Ireland international even before he made his first team debut. His full international debut came in February 1997 against Belgium but Mulryne had to wait until the following October to make his debut for United against Ipswich in the Coca-Cola Cup (a 2–0 defeat). Despite being capable as a striker, midfielder or right winger, these positions were virtually monopolised by accomplished players such as David Beckham, Nicky Butt, Paul Scholes, Andy Cole and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, and so Mulryne only managed a handful of first-team games in five seasons at Old Trafford. His only league appearance for United came on the last day of the 1997–98 season, in which he played the full 90 minutes against Barnsley.\n\nMulryne joined Norwich City for £500,000 on 25 March 1999 in the hope of gaining more first-team opportunities. Mulryne made a promising start to his Norwich career, scoring an excellent free-kick in a televised 1–0 win at Grimsby Town in Division One which was just his second appearance for Norwich. However, a broken leg sustained in a tackle with Blackburn Rovers' Christian Dailly shortly after the start of the following season ruled him out for most of the 1999–2000 campaign.\n\nIn the 2001–02 season, Mulryne was a member of the Norwich team that reached the final of the Division One play-offs. The match ended 1–1 after extra time and Mulryne missed one of the spot-kicks in the subsequent shoot-out as Birmingham City won 4–2 on penalties. Mulryne had missed another penalty earlier that season in a league match against Gillingham at Carrow Road, however Norwich won that game 2–1. Mulryne's contract was expiring that summer and there was speculation regarding his future until he signed a new three-year contract with Norwich.\n\nHe was part of the Norwich side that won promotion to the Premier League as Division One champions in 2004, but they stayed there for only one season before being relegated. Mulryne then departed from Carrow Road, cancelling his contract by mutual agreement shortly before it expired. He signed for Cardiff City two months later.\n\nOn 30 August 2005, Mulryne was ejected from Northern Ireland's squad by manager Lawrie Sanchez for a breach of discipline. He had made 27 appearances for the team, a highlight being a headed equaliser against Denmark in 2001.\n\nAt the end of the 2005–06 season, Mulryne was released from his contract at Ninian Park having made only a handful of substitute appearances, and was not until January 2007 before he found a new club after spells having trials with amongst others, Ipswich Town, Brighton & Hove Albion, Polish champions Legia Warsaw and Barnsley.\n\nManager Martin Ling signed Mulryne for Leyton Orient on 23 January 2007 on a free transfer after impressing on a trial. He made his debut against Brighton & Hove Albion in a 4–1 home defeat on 13 February after 16 months without first team action. He was released at the end of the 2006–07 season, having helped Orient avoid relegation which had looked almost certain for much of the campaign.\n\nHe subsequently had a trial at Bournemouth and played in a friendly against Southampton and then came a trial with St Mirren in Scotland. On 25 October 2007 Mulryne joined King's Lynn FC on a non-contract basis. He was released by the club on 1 January 2008. It was announced on 14 March that Mulryne was training with Cliftonville.\n\nIn 2009, at the age of 31, Mulryne began formation for the Roman Catholic priesthood. It is understood he was invited to enter the priesthood by Monsignor Noel Treanor, the Bishop of Down and Connor. He had originally intended to become a secular priest and so entered Saint Malachy's Seminary, Belfast, the seminary of the Diocese of Down and Connor. During this time, he studied philosophy for two years at Queen's University Belfast. He then moved to the Pontifical Irish College in Rome and studied theology at the Pontifical Gregorian University.\n\nHaving felt a call to a religious life during his studies, Mulryne entered the novitiate of the Order of Preachers (Dominicans) in 2012. On 11 September 2016, he made his profession to become a Dominican friar at St Saviour's Priory in Dublin. On 29 October 2016, he was ordained a deacon by Diarmuid Martin, the Archbishop of Dublin. On 8 July 2017 he was ordained a priest by Archbishop Joseph Augustine Di Noia OP at St Saviour's Priory. He presided at his first Mass on 10 July 2017 at St Oliver Plunkett Church, Belfast.\n\n"}

Several configurations are used, including low-floor buses, high-floor buses, double-decker buses, articulated buses and midibuses.\n\nThese are distinct from all-seated coaches used for longer distance journeys and smaller minibuses, for more flexible services.\n\nGenerally, a transit bus will have:\n\nModern transit buses are also increasingly being equipped with passenger information systems, multimedia, WiFi, USB charging points, entertainment/advertising, and passenger comforts such as heating and air-conditioning (as opposed to historically where actually necessary). Some industry members and commentators promote the idea of making the interior of a transit bus as inviting as a private car, recognising the chief competitor to the transit bus in most markets.\n\nAs they are used in a public transport role, transit buses can be operated by publicly run transit authorities or municipal bus companies, as well as private transport companies on a public contract or fully independent basis. Due to the local authority use, transit buses are often built to a third-party specification put to the manufacturer by the authority. Early examples of such specification include the Greater Manchester Leyland Atlantean, and DMS-class London Daimler Fleetline. New transit buses may be purchased each time a route/area is contracted, such as in the London Buses tendering system.\n\nThe operating area of a transit bus may also be defined as a geographic metropolitan area, with the buses used outside of this area being more varied with buses purchased with other factors in mind. Some regional-size operators for capital cost reasons may use transit buses interchangeably on short urban routes as well as longer rural routes, sometimes up to 2 or 3 hours. Often transit bus operators have a selection of 'dual-purpose' fitted buses, that is standard transit buses fitted with coach-type seating, for longer-distance routes.\n\nSometimes transit buses may also be used as express buses on a limited-stopping or non-stop service at peak times, but over the same distance as the regular route.\n\nFare payment is done via\n\nand is done upon\n\nDepending on payment systems in different municipalities, there are widely different rules with regard to which door, front or rear, one must use when boarding/exiting.\n\nFor rear doors, most buses have doors opened by the driver controls or patron (with touch-to-open, motion sensor or push bars). Most doors on buses use air-assist technology, the driver controlled doors, use air pressure to force them open, patron-operated doors, can push them open, however, the doors are heavy, so the touch-to-open or push bar mechanism, sends pressurized air to open the doors. Most doors will signify that they are unlocked and open with lights, this gives guide to those who are going up or down the door steps to not trip and fall.\n\nUnlocked or open doors, will trigger a brake locking mechanism on the bus to prevent it from moving while someone could possibly be entering or exiting the bus, when the door is closed, the lock will release, this is mostly implemented on rear doors, not really on front doors, since the driver will be paying attention to the front door.\n\nTransit buses can be single-decker, double-decker, rigid or articulated. Selection of type has traditionally been made on a regional as well as operational basis; however, with the advent of global manufacturing, all of these types can be seen in the same location or country. Depending on local policies, transit buses will also usually have two, three or (for articulated) four doors to facilitate rapid boarding and alighting.\n\nIn cases of low-demand routes, or to navigate small local streets, some models of minibus and small midibuses have also been used as transit type buses.\n\nThe development of the midibus has also given many operators a low-cost way of operating a transit bus service, with some midibuses such as the Plaxton SPD \"Super Pointer Dart\" resembling full size transit type vehicles.\n\nDue to their public transport role, transit buses were the first type of bus to benefit from low-floor technology, in response to a demand for equal access public service provision. Transit buses are also now subject to various disability discrimination acts in several jurisdictions which dictate various design features also applied to other vehicles in some cases.\n\nDue to the high number of high-profile urban operations, transit buses are at the forefront of bus electrification, with hybrid electric bus, all-electric bus and fuel cell bus development and testing aimed at reducing fuel usage, shift to green electricity and decreasing environmental impact.\n\nDevelopments of the transit bus towards higher capacity bus transport include tram-like vehicles such as guided buses, longer bi-articulated buses and tram-like buses such as the Wright StreetCar, often as part of Bus Rapid Transit schemes. Fare collection is also seeing a shift to off-bus payment, with either the driver or an inspector verifying fare payments.\n\nA commuter or express bus service is a fixed-route bus characterized by service predominantly in one direction during peak periods, limited stops, use of multi-ride tickets and routes of extended length, usually between the central business district and outlying suburbs. Commuter bus service also may include other service, characterized by a limited route structure, limited stops and a coordinated relationship with another mode of transportation. They may closely follow the routing of a conventional bus route but not stopping at every stop or not making detours such as into residential or commercial areas that conventional routes may take.\n\n"}

It was released in January 1991 on Sub Pop records and includes two live tracks: \"Candy\" by The Fluid; and \"Molly's Lips\", a cover of a song by The Vaselines, performed by Nirvana.\n\n\"Candy\" first appeared on The Fluid's 1990 EP, \"Glue\". The EP was re-released on CD in 1993 along with their 1989 album, \"Roadmouth\".\n\n\"Molly's Lips\" was recorded live on February 9, 1990, at the Pine Street Theatre in Portland, Oregon. It was written by the Scottish band The Vaselines about Molly Weir, according to band member Eugene Kelly, presumably because her \"Rentaghost\" television character Hazel McWitch typically appeared in whiteface with emphatic red lips. According to Michael Azerrad's 1993 Nirvana biography \"Come as You Are: The Story of Nirvana\", the band's singer and guitarist Kurt Cobain was opposed to the release of the track, feeling that this version was not strong. However, the single constituted part of the band's buyout deal from their former record label, Sub Pop Records. \"Candy/Molly's Lips\" was Nirvana's final release on Sub Pop Records. The word \"Later\" is etched into the single's run-out groove. A remix of this version of Molly's Lips was included on the 2009 reissue of the Nirvana debut album \"Bleach\".\n\nNirvana also recorded a studio version of \"Molly's Lips\" on BBC Radio 1 for John Peel in October 1990 during drummer Dave Grohl's first recording session with the band. It appeared on the 1992 tour EP \"Hormoaning\", and was included on the rarities compilation \"Incesticide\". This version was released as a 12\" vinyl promotional single in Brazil, to promote \"Incesticide\".\n\n\"Molly Lips\" is an uptempo alternative rock song that lasts for a duration of two minutes and nineteen seconds. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Universal Music Publishing Group, it is written in the time signature of common time, with a fast tempo of 160 beats per minute. \"Molly Lips\" is composed in the key of G Major, while Kurt Cobain's vocal range spans from the low-note of F to the high-note of E. The song follows a basic sequence that alternates between the chords of G and C during the verses, at its chorus and all throughout as its chord progression. \n\nThe single was only released on 7 inch vinyl, and in limited numbers of 7500. The first 4000 copies were pressed on green swirled vinyl, the final 3500 pressed on black vinyl. Counterfeit versions of the single also pressed on black vinyl exist, but can be distinguished from the real version as the matrix number is different. The live version of \"Molly's Lips\" by Nirvana was exclusive to the single, though was subsequently released on the 2009 \"Bleach\" reissue. The single is also notorious for being The Fluid's most famous release, due to the fact it was split with Nirvana and exposed them to a wider audience. \n\nIn 2017, to mark what would have been Kurt Cobain's 50th birthday, the Phonographic Performance Limited released a list of the top twenty most played Nirvana songs on the TV and radio in the UK in which \"Molly's Lips\" was ranked at number eighteen.\n\nApart from this 1990 live version, released on limited edition single in 1991, Nirvana performed \"Molly's Lips\" several other times in concert from 1989 to 1993. On August 23, 1991, it was performed live with its author, the Vaselines' Eugene Kelly, at the 1991 Reading Festival in Reading, Berkshire. It was again performed live with Kelly on December 5, 1991 in London, England. On both occasions, Kelly and Cobain shared vocal duties.\n\n"}
{"id": "1852989", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1852989", "title": "Complementary currency", "text": "Complementary currency\n\nA complementary currency is a currency or medium of exchange that is not necessarily a national currency, but that is thought of as supplementing or complementing national currencies. Complementary currencies are usually not legal tender and their use is based on agreement between the parties exchanging the currency. According to Jérôme Blanc of Laboratoire d'Économie de la Firme et des Institutions, complementary currencies aim to protect, stimulate or orientate the economy. They may also be used to advance particular social, environmental, or political goals.\n\nWhen speaking about complementary currencies, a number of overlapping and often interchangeable terms are in use: local or community currencies are complementary currencies used within a locality or other form of community (such as business-based or online communities); regional currencies are similar to local currencies, but are used within a larger geographical region; and sectoral currencies are complementary currencies used within a single economic sector, such as education or health care. Many private currencies are complementary currencies issued by private businesses or organizations. Other terms include alternative currency, auxiliary currency, and microcurrency. Mutual credit is a form of alternative currency, and thus any form of lending that does not go through the banking system can be considered a form of alternative currency. Barters are another type of alternative currency. These are actually exchange systems, which trade only items, without the use of any currency whatsoever. Finally, LETS is a special form of barter that trades points for items. One point stands for one worker-hour of work, and is thus a Time-based currency.\n\nCurrent complementary currencies have often been designed intentionally to address specific issues, for example to increase financial stability. Most complementary currencies have multiple purposes and/or are intended to address multiple issues. They can be useful for communities that do not have access to financial capital, and for adjusting peoples' spending behavior. The 2006 Annual Report of the Worldwide Database of Complementary Currency Systems presented a survey of 150 complementary currency systems in which 94 respondents said that \"all reasons\" were selected, among cooperation, micro/small/medium enterprise development, activating the local market, reducing the need for national currency, and community development.\n\nAims may include:\n\nSome complementary currencies intentionally devalue rapidly (they are called Schwundgeld); this increases monetary circulation. The Miracle of Wörgl is an event that showed the potential of this increased spending through the introduction of a local currency known as Freigeld. Local currencies also have the benefit that they cannot be spent abroad, and thus the money always keeps circulating locally, benefiting the local economy.\n\nAlternative currencies are reported to work as a counterbalance for the local economy. They increase in activity if the local economy slows down, and decrease in activity if the local economy goes up.\n\nAs a commercial tool within a business, as opposed to a geographical social tool, a complementary currency can open a business up to a preferred source marketplace whereby they can sell their otherwise devalued or worthless spare capacity in exchange for the complementary currency. By selling their spare capacity (empty hotel rooms / under utilised staff hours / blank diary slots / excess stock) the business is able to harness the otherwise lost value gaining some key benefits such as :- Improved profits; stronger balance sheet; enhanced cash flow; more customers and a growth in market share.\n\nComplementary currencies promoted as local currencies which cannot be spent outside the community have limited use.\n\nAccording to professor Nikolaus Läufer theory, the use of local currencies such as Freigeld can only increase economic activity temporarily. Lengthy use of a local currency will ultimately result in a decline in economic activity and lead to a destabilization of the economy. This is due to the increased circulation velocity of the money as the amount in circulation decreases (as currencies as Freigeld reduce in value rapidly).\n\nOften there are issues related to paying tax. Some complementary currencies are considered tax-exempt, but most of them are fully taxed as if they were national currency, with the caveat that the tax must be paid in the national currency. The legality and tax-status of complementary currencies varies widely from country to country; some systems in use in some countries would be illegal in others.\n\nComplementary currencies describe a wide group of exchange systems, currencies or scrips designed to be used in combination with standard currencies or other complementary currencies. They can be valued and exchanged in relationship to national currencies but also function as media of exchange on their own. Complementary currencies lie outside the nationally defined legal realm of legal tender and are not used as such. Rate of exchange, scope of circulation and use in combination with other currencies differs greatly between complementary currency systems, as is the case with national currency systems.\nSome complementary currencies incorporate value scales based on time or the backing of real resources (gold, oil, services, etc.). A time-based currency is valued by the time required to perform a service in hours, notwithstanding the potential market value of the service. Another type of complementary monetary systems is the barter, an exchange of specific goods or services is performed without the use of any currency.\n\nIn 1982, the most widespread auxiliary currency system, the Local Exchange Trading Systems, was created. It regulates the exchange of goods and services between the members of the cooperative. Examples for an investment system of complementary currency are the Automatic Social Financial Network (ASFN) and the international crowdsourcing and crowd-funding community Evolution RA whose members use their own complementary virtual currency \"Сyber-gold\". The introductory fee paid by the new association members is subsequently directed toward investments in a variety of commercial projects.\n\nSome complementary currencies take advantage of demurrage fees, an intentional devaluation of the currency over time, like negative interest. This stimulates market exchanges in the devaluating currency, propagates new participation in the currency system and forces the storage of wealth (hoarding) ability usually reserved for currency into more permanent and better value-holding tools like property, improvement, education, technology, health, equity securities, etc., all of which are sheltered from the currency-based demurrage fees.\n\nOther experimental complementary currencies use high interest fees to promote heavy competition between participants, and the removal of wealth from long term wealth holding structures (natural/material wealth, property, etc.) to aid in the process of rapid industrialization, mass production, automation and competitive innovation.\n\nMonetary speculation and gambling are usually outside the design parameters of complementary currencies. Complementary currencies are often intentionally restricted in their regional spread, time of validity or sector of use and may require a membership of participating individuals or points of acceptance.\n\nThere are some complementary currencies that are regional or global, such as the Community Exchange System, WIR and Friendly Favors, Tibex in the Lazio region in Italy or the proposed global currency terra.\n\nA community currency is a type of complementary currency that has the explicit aim to support and build more equal, connected and sustainable societies. A community currency is designed to be used by a specific group.\n\nSome complementary currency activists are Belgian ex-banker Bernard Lietaer, British economist Hazel Henderson, Dutch STRO-director Henk van Arkel that developed Cyclos, Qoin initiators Edgar Kampers and Rob van Hilten, Paul Glover of Ithaca HOURS, Margrit Kennedy from Monneta, LETSystem inventor Michael Linton, Time Banking inventor Edgar S. Cahn, Complementary Currency Resource Center coordinator Stephen DeMeulenaere and many others. Lietaer has argued that the world's national currencies are inadequate for the world's business needs, citing how 87 countries have experienced major currency crashes over a 20-year period, and arguing for complementary currencies as a way to protect against these problems. Lietaer has also spoken at an International Reciprocal Trade Association (IRTA) conference about barter.\n\nOther non-regional complementary currencies include:\n\n\n\n"}

She is known for her work with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) on its ECW brand under the ring name Ariel and for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) under the ring name Salinas as valet to The Latin American Xchange (LAX).\n\nMartinez entered professional wrestling in December 2000. She worked mainly on the independent circuit in Southern California, using the name Desire, competing for promotions including Revolution Pro Wrestling, Ultimate Pro Wrestling and the Empire Wrestling Federation (EWF). In April 2005, she signed a contract with WWE, and was assigned to their developmental territory, Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW). She moved to the ECW brand in mid-2006, and using a gimmick of a tarot reader, managed Kevin Thorn, while known as Ariel. In 2007, she was released from her WWE contract, and signed with TNA. Known as Salinas, she was associated with LAX, and managed both members of the team, Homicide and Hernandez. She left TNA in September 2008, and appeared for several independent promotions until her retirement in 2017.\n\nMartinez is also known for her acting and modeling work. She was a contestant on the reality television show, \"The Search for the Next Elvira\", and has also appeared in films. She starred in \"The Notorious Jewel De'Nyle & Shelly Martinez\", a softcore pornography video alongside Jewel De'Nyle, and has also posed nude on several occasions.\n\nMartinez began working as a model in order to further her professional wrestling career. She also worked as an actress, and after being cast in an independent film about wrestling, she was introduced to a wrestling promoter and trainer. She trained at his school for two and a half years. Martinez first wrestled in Southern California under the ring name Desire, appearing in several independent promotions such as Revolution Pro Wrestling, Empire Wrestling Federation (EWF) and Ultimate Pro Wrestling (UPW), where she worked as the storyline sister of Kyra. While in UPW, she also competed under the name Halloween Barbie. She also had a run in Women's Extreme Wrestling, where she played the storyline cousin of Mercedes Martinez. On July 19, 2002, Martinez, under the name Desire, teamed with Threat to win the vacant EWF Tag Team Championship in a battle royal. They held the championship for 28 days, before losing it to PHAT (Eric Matlock and Devon Willis) on August 16. In December 2004, Martinez trained at World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE)'s developmental territory, Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) for a few weeks.\n\nIn April 2005, Martinez signed a developmental contract with WWE. By July of that year she had begun training and wrestling in their primary developmental territory OVW, using simply \"Shelly\" as a ring name. Her first role there had her, along with Beth Phoenix, acting as co-manager for Aaron Stevens. As part of her affiliation with Phoenix and Stevens, Shelly had an erotic gimmick, with a relationship between all three being implied. She was involved in a scripted rivalry with Alexis Laree, with Shelly and Phoenix attacking her on several occasions and the pair wrestled her in handicap matches. In her first singles match in OVW Shelly defeated Laree on October 29. Shelly and Phoenix also appeared together on the January 27, 2006, episode of \"Heat\" as part of The Heart Throbs (Romeo Roselli and Antonio Thomas) \"Throb-o-Meter\" section, dancing in the ring with the team and teasing a kiss, before being interrupted by Trevor Murdoch.\n\nIn February 2006, Shelly began a gimmick of being obsessed with Paul Burchill, who was using a pirate gimmick on \"SmackDown!\". It began at the television tapings on February 1, when Burchill had picked her up to perform a piledriver, but instead carried her backstage after looking at her panties. This obsession provoked a feud with Phoenix, when Shelly attacked Phoenix who was attempting to stop Shelly from attacking Cherry during a match between Burchill and Deuce Shade. As part of the feud, Shelly and Phoenix competed against each other in several matches, including a street fight at the television tapings on April 19. On the May 6 episode of \"Velocity\", Shelly appeared as Burchill's valet for his match against Road Warrior Animal, and was referred to as his \"buxom wench\". Returning to OVW, she became involved in Seth Skyfire's ongoing feud with Mike \"The Miz\" Mizanin and Roni Jonah. Upon her debut on the ECW brand in mid-2006, Martinez began using the ring name Ariel in OVW as well. In November 2006, Ariel unsuccessfully challenged Beth Phoenix for the OVW Women's Championship. Her final appearance in OVW came on January 25, 2007, when she and Jon Bolen defeated Stevens and Phoenix.\n\nIn mid-2006, Martinez joined the ECW brand as Ariel, a tarot reading fortune teller. Originally, Martinez was to be part of a 'vampire' faction with Gangrel and Kevin Thorn; however, the faction did not materialise on television. Instead, Ariel and Thorn began appearing in vignettes together, and on July 25, Thorn made his in-ring debut with Ariel acting as his valet.\n\nAriel then increased her ringside presence during Thorn's matches, often interfering in his matches, and Thorn began a scripted feud with Balls Mahoney. In order to counteract Ariel's interference, Mahoney began bringing in Francine as an equalizer. Ariel made her ECW in-ring debut against Francine on September 26 in an \"Extreme Catfight\", which ended as a no contest due to interference from both Thorn and Mahoney. The two teams feuded until early October, until Francine was released by WWE. During a match between Thorn and CM Punk, Kelly Kelly interfered in order to help Punk. As a result, Punk won the match, and Ariel and Thorn attacked Kelly after the match. At the December to Dismember pay-per-view, Thorn and Ariel defeated Kelly and Kelly's on-screen boyfriend Mike Knox in a mixed tag team match, after Knox walked out on Kelly. The next week on \"ECW\", Ariel lost to Kelly in a singles match, when Kelly utilized a schoolgirl for the victory.\n\nOn February 6, 2007, Ariel and Thorn joined Elijah Burke, Matt Striker, and Marcus Cor Von in forming the New Breed stable. Ariel began accompanying the New Breed to the ring during their matches, and appeared at WrestleMania 23, managing the New Breed during their match against the ECW Originals. Shortly afterward, Burke announced a match between Thorn and CM Punk, after Punk had betrayed the New Breed, but Thorn lost. After the match, Thorn quit the New Breed, as none of the other members interfered during the match to help him. A few weeks later, on May 18, Martinez was released from her WWE contract. In a 2013 interview, Martinez blamed her release on a confrontation with Dave Batista.\n\nAt the Bound for Glory pay-per-view in October 2007, Martinez participated in a Knockout Gauntlet battle royal to crown the first TNA Knockout Champion, which was won by Gail Kim. Shortly afterward, a masked member of The Latin American Xchange (LAX) began interfering in LAX's matches to help them gain victories and attacking The Rock 'n Rave Infection's valet, Christy Hemme. At the Final Resolution pay-per-view in January 2008, the mystery masked wrestler was unveiled as Martinez after attacking Hemme again. On the following episode of \"Impact!\", Homicide and Hernandez gave her the name \"Salinas\". Salinas then began accompanying Homicide and Hernandez to the ring as their valet.\n\nShe made her in-ring debut for TNA in a singles against Awesome Kong, and was quickly defeated. She then began competing more frequently in matches, including intergender tag team matches alongside Homicide and Hernandez. Salinas participated at Lockdown in the first ever \"Queen of the Cage\" match, which was won by Roxxi Laveaux. After a Knockouts \"Makeover Battle Royal\" was announced for the Sacrifice pay-per-view, where one Knockout would get their head shaved, Salinas competed in a match to gain immunity from the head shaving on the May 8 episode of \"Impact!\", but was unsuccessful. At Sacrifice, the \"Makeover Battle Royal\" was won by Gail Kim, and Roxxi Laveaux had her head shaved. The same night, Salinas and Hector Guerrero were in the corner of LAX as they won the TNA World Tag Team Championship. As part of LAX's feud with Beer Money, Inc., Salinas wrestled their manager Jackie Moore on \"Impact!\" in June 2008, but lost by submission. She participated in a gauntlet battle royal match for the number one contendership to the TNA Women's Knockout Championship, but was unsuccessful, and a few weeks later lost a three-on-one handicap match to Awesome Kong and The Beautiful People (Velvet Sky and Angelina Love). After Beer Money, Inc. won the TNA World Tag Team Championship from LAX, the two teams began feuding, and at No Surrender in September, Salinas was attacked off camera by their manager Jackie Moore. This storyline was put in place as a way to take Martinez off television, as she had quit TNA to film an Italian thriller movie.\n\nMartinez wrestled under her real name for the Perros del Mal promotion in Mexico. Martinez is part of both World Independent Ladies Division and World Wrestling Fan Xperience in the Philippines. Martinez has also appeared as a valet for Dragon Gate USA.\n\nBeginning in 2010, Martinez began appearing for Championship Wrestling From Hollywood. She defeated Lucky O'Shea in her debut match for the promotion in August 2010. In 2013, she was briefly associated with Todd Chandler, before switching her affections to Ricky Mandel, appearing as his storyline girlfriend.\n\nOn May 10, 2014, Martinez and JT Dunn competed in the 2014 WSU Queen and King of the Ring tournament, losing to the team of Candice LeRae and Joey Ryan. In 2016, Martinez appeared on TNA's One Night Only: Knockouts Knockdown 4, where she fought Rebel in a losing effort.\n\nMartinez announced her retirement from professional wrestling in May 2017.\n\nShe also starred in a pin-up film titled \"American Pinups Vol. 2\". Martinez collaborated with Jewel De'Nyle on an all-female spanking and soft-core bondage video entitled \"The Notorious Jewel De'Nyle & Shelly Martinez\". In October 2009, Martinez posed nude for a contest called \"THE 1 Contest\". In November 2012 Martinez appeared on the fourth season of the \"Bad Girls Club\" spin-off \"\".\n\nShe starred in the independent supernatural horror movie \"Dead Things\". In addition, she was a contestant on the reality show \"The Search for the Next Elvira\", which debuted October 13, 2007, on the Fox Reality Channel. Martinez appears in the beginning of the Mötley Crüe music video for \"Saints of Los Angeles\". In May 2011, Martinez, Raven, and Cheerleader Melissa filmed the music video for the Smashing Pumpkins' song \"Owata\".\n\nAs of late 2011, Martinez has been the official Hollywood event correspondent and hostess for the horror news website MoreHorror.com.\n\nMartinez is an advocate of medical marijuana as well as an animal rights activist.\n\n\n"}

Due to the Tokugawa rules which required all the daimyō to spend every other year in Edo (now called Tokyo) the chamberlain was a very important man and the de facto ruler of the estate when the daimyō was away. Having attained this office at a rather young age, he is said to have had the implicit trust of his lord.\n\nWhen Asano committed seppuku as punishment for his failed attempt to kill Kira Yoshinaka in Edo castle and the Tokugawa shogunate abolished the house of Asano in Akō, Ōishi was in Akō and managed all its administrative issues. He persuaded other samurai to vacate the castle to the agents of the Shogunate. During the next two years many people wondered what Oishi would do as he had a reputation as an honorable and capable man.\n\nHe attempted to get the permission to re-establish the house of Asano but failed. He then began a careful plot to kill Lord Kira but to throw off suspicion spent time (and money) in the geisha houses of Kyoto. This type of ruse is referred to as – appearing to be serving no useful purposes, and this term is frequently applied to Ōishi. He carried out his role well – and secretly coordinated the movements of the remaining loyal Asano samurai. Nearly two years passed before the attack was launched.\nIn January 1703 (by the old Japanese calendar, the 12th month, 14th day) he, with 46 other Akō rōnin, attacked Kira at his residence in the Honjo neighborhood of Edo. Kira was killed and decapitated. After Ōishi dispatched Terasaka Kichiemon to inform Asano's widow Yōzeiin of the deed, he and the remaining 45 rōnin went to Sengaku-ji in Shinagawa where Naganori was buried and there they were arrested.\n\nHe and the other rōnin were ordered to commit seppuku. Since it was an honorable sentence rather than merely decapitation, everyone accepted this sentence as an honor.\n\nAfter death, Oishi became famous as the example of ideal samurai behavior. His ultimate goal of reestablishment of the Asano clan was realized as the Tokugawa shogunate did restore some lands (about 1/10 of the original holdings) to the Asano clan. Oishi was related to the Asano clan by blood, as several generations prior, an Oishi man married a daughter of the Asano.\n\nIn the famous kabuki play \"Kanadehon Chūshingura\", Yoshio (Kuranosuke) is known as Ōboshi Yuranosuke.\n"}

Stall strips are used to initiate flow separation at chosen locations on the wing during high-angle of attack flight, so as to improve the controllability of the aircraft when it enters stall. They are typically employed in pairs, symmetrically on both wings. On aircraft where wing airflow is affected by asymmetrical propeller wash, a strip may be used on a single wing to reduce risk of entering a spin.\n\nA stall strip alters the wing’s stall characteristics and ensures that the wing root stalls before the wing tips. This is usually as a result of initial aircraft flight testing which shows that the existing stall characteristics are unacceptable for certification.\n\nIn some cases, such as the American Aviation AA-1 Yankee, stall strips are planned to be used on the wing from the start. In the case of the AA-1 the left and right wings were identical, interchangeable and built on a single wing jig, thus the more traditional use of washout in the wing design was not possible.\n\nStall strips typically consist of a small piece of material, usually aluminium, triangular in cross section and often 6-12 inches (15–30 cm) in length. It is riveted or bonded on the point of the wing’s leading edge, usually at the wing root. At high angles of attack, it trips the still-laminar boundary layer, initiating flow separation earlier than at other positions along the wing. This has the effect of causing the wing root to stall before the outer portions of the wing, ensuring a progressive outward stall, minimizing the risk of spinning and giving maximum aileron control throughout the stall.\n\nThey are usually factory-installed or, on rarer occasion, an after-market modification.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1853027", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1853027", "title": "Intel High Definition Audio", "text": "Intel High Definition Audio\n\nIntel High Definition Audio (IHDA) (also called HD Audio or development codename Azalia) is a specification for the audio sub-system of personal computers. It was released by Intel in 2004 as successor to their AC'97 PC audio standard.\n\nFeatures of the specification include: \n\n\nHowever, , most audio hardware manufacturers did not implement the full specification, especially 32-bit sampling resolution. Motherboards typically do not have any more than eight onboard output channels (7.1 surround sound) and four input channels (back and front panel microphone inputs, and a back-panel stereo line-in). Users requiring more audio I/Os will typically opt for a sound card or an external audio interface, as these devices also provide additional features that are more oriented towards professional audio applications.\n\nMicrosoft Windows XP SP3 and later Windows versions include a Universal Audio Architecture (UAA) class driver which supports audio devices built to the HD Audio specification. There are UAA drivers for Windows 2000 and Windows XP SP2 as well. macOS has full support with its AppleHDA driver. Linux also supports HD Audio controllers, as do the OpenSolaris, FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD operating systems.\n\nLike AC'97, HD Audio is a specification that defines the architecture, link frame format, and programming interfaces used by the controller on the PCI bus and by the codec on the other side of the link. Implementations of the host controller are available from at least Intel, Nvidia, and AMD. Codecs which can be used with such controllers are available from many companies, including Realtek, Conexant (including products of acquired Analog Devices' SoundMAX division), Integrated Device Technology (IDT) (acquired from SigmaTel), VIA, Wolfson Microelectronics, and formerly C-Media. Realtek currently supplies most of HD Audio codec chips used on motherboards and standalone cards.\n\nNearly all chipsets for x86 processors and x86 SoCs, designed for consumer and embedded PC markets, introduced since 2005, implements integrated HD Audio controller. The most recent exemption in consumer chipset market is AMD TRX40 (launched 2019), which, for first time since the early 2000s, does not itself integrate any kind of audio controller. Instead, motherboard manufacturers places USB audio controller chip, in pair with usual HD Audio codec chip, to provide onboard audio functionality. The Realtek ALC4050H controller and ALC1220 codec is the most common pair used in sTRX4 motherboards.\n\nComputer motherboards often provide a connector to bring microphone and headphone signals to the computer's front panel. Intel provides a specification for that header, but the signal assignments are different for AC'97 and HD Audio headers.\n\nThe pin assignments for the AC'97 and HD Audio connectors are:\nThe HDA 3.5 mm subminiature audio connectors differ from connectors used in the AC'97 specification and general audio equipment. A regular 3.5 mm audio jack (which is used in AC'97) typically has 5 pins: one pin for ground, two pins for stereo signal and two pins for return signal. When there is no plug in the jack, the two stereo signals are connected to their return pins. When a plug is inserted, the stereo signals contact the respective channels on the plug and are disconnected from the jack's return pins. The HDA 3.5 mm jack does not have the two return audio signals; instead it has an isolated switch that senses the presence of a plug in the jack.\n\nIn the AC'97 design, the audio output is always sent to the jack. If the headphones are not plugged in, the jack directs the audio to the return pins that are connected to the speakers. When a headphone is plugged into the front panel jack, the audio signal goes to the headphones; the return pins are disconnected, so no audio signal goes to the speakers. For the microphone jack, the return signal pins ground the microphone input when the microphone is not plugged in. Many motherboards with AC'97 audio need two jumpers to short the pins in case no front panel audio module is connected, so audio passes to the speakers.\n\nIn the HDA design, when the plug is not inserted, the codec sends the audio directly to the speakers (the audio does not go out to the front panel and then loop back to the speakers). When the plug is inserted, the isolated switch inside the jack informs the motherboard, and the codec sends audio to the headphones. A similar isolated switch is used to detect when a microphone has been plugged in.\n\nHD Audio can sense the presence of an audio dongle. A 10 kΩ pull-up resistor is attached to pin 4 (PRESENCE#). When the HDA dongle is plugged in, it pulls pin 4 to ground with a 1 kΩ resistor. The motherboard can determine if the dongle is plugged in by examining the logic level on pin 4. If the motherboard does not detect the presence of an HDA dongle, then it should ignore SENSE1_RETURN (pin 6) and SENSE2_RETURN (pin 10) signals. In AC'97, pins 2 and 4 are audio ground, but pin 4 is often disconnected. Consequently, an HDA motherboard would not detect the presence of an AC'97 dongle with a disconnected pin 4.\n\nIntel warns that HDA dongles should be used with HDA motherboards:\nThe different signal assignments can cause trouble when AC'97 front-panel dongles are used with HDA motherboards and vice versa. An AC'97 dongle returns audio on pins 6 and 10 rather than a digital plug sensing signals. Consequently, a loud audio passage may make the HDA motherboard with AC'97 dongle believe that headphones and microphones are being plugged and unplugged hundreds of times per second. An AC'97 motherboard with an HDA dongle will route the AC'97 5 V audio supply (pin 7; silence) to the speakers instead of the desired left and right audio signals.\n\nTo avoid this, some motherboards allow choosing between HDA and AC'97 front panels in the BIOS. Even though the actual audio hardware is HD Audio, it will allow using the AC'97 front panel that way. Likewise, some modern enclosures have both an \"AC'97\" and an \"HDA\" plug at the end of the front-panel audio cable.\n\n\n"}

Processes such as gas metal arc welding, while often automated, are not necessarily equivalent to robot welding, since a human operator sometimes prepares the materials to be welded\". Robot welding is commonly used for resistance spot welding and arc welding in high production applications, such as the automotive industry.\n\nRobot welding is a relatively new application of robotics, even though robots were first introduced into US industry during the 1960s. The use of robots in welding did not take off until the 1980s, when the automotive industry began using robots extensively for spot welding. Since then, both the number of robots used in industry and the number of their applications has grown greatly. In 2005, more than 120,000 robots were in use in North American industry, about half of them for welding. Growth is primarily limited by high equipment costs, and the resulting restriction to high-production applications. \n\nRobot arc welding has begun growing quickly just recently, and already it commands about 20% of industrial robot applications. The major components of arc welding robots are the manipulator or the mechanical unit and the controller, which acts as the robot's \"brain\". The manipulator is what makes the robot move, and the design of these systems can be categorized into several common types, such as SCARA and cartesian coordinate robot, which use different coordinate systems to direct the arms of the machine.\n\nThe robot may weld a pre-programmed position, be guided by machine vision, or by a combination of the two methods. However, the many benefits of robotic welding have proven to make it a technology that helps many original equipment manufacturers increase accuracy, repeat-ability, and throughput \n\nThe technology of signature image processing has been developed since the late 1990s for analyzing electrical data in real time collected from automated, robotic welding, thus enabling the optimization of welds.\n\n"}

They also represented the shogun in certain functions held at Nikkō and other shrines or temples, and regulated courtly ceremonies and rites observed in the Edo Castle.\n\nThe office was instituted in 1608, when the Tokugawa shogunate selected certain ancient great dispossessed families to fill the hereditary office. Most of these families claimed descent from \"shugo\" (governors) of the Kamakura period to Sengoku period, among them the Takeda, the Imagawa, the Kyōgoku, the Rokkaku, the Ōtomo, the Toki, the Isshiki and the Hatakeyama (a full list is given below). Some families were less prestigious, like the Yokose, the Yura, the Ōsawa, and the Kira. By the end of the shogunate in the mid-19th century, the occupancy of the office numbered 26. Some families had several branches among the \"kōke,\" like the Takeda who had two lateral branches with that title.\n\nThe \"kōke\" families had land income assessed at less than ten thousand koku which ranked them below a daimyō lord, but were higher ranked than the run-of-the-mill hatamoto (Tokugawa bannermen).

{"id": "1853045", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1853045", "title": "Sangay", "text": "Sangay\n\nSangay (also known as Macas, Sanagay, or Sangai) is an active stratovolcano in central Ecuador. It is the most active volcano in Ecuador, despite erupting only three times in recorded history, because the eruption that started in 1934 is still ongoing. It exhibits mostly strombolian activity. Geologically, Sangay marks the southern boundary of the Northern Volcanic Zone, and its position straddling two major pieces of crust accounts for its high level of activity. Sangay's approximately 500,000-year-old history is one of instability; two previous versions of the mountain were destroyed in massive flank collapses, evidence of which still litters its surroundings today.\n\nDue to its remoteness, Sangay hosts a significant biological community with fauna such as the mountain tapir, giant otter, Andean cock-of-the-rock and king vulture. Since 1983, its ecological community has been protected as part of the Sangay National Park. Although climbing the mountain is hampered by its remoteness, poor weather conditions, river flooding, and the danger of falling ejecta, the volcano is regularly climbed, a feat first achieved by Robert T. Moore in 1929.\n\nLying at the eastern edge of the Andean cordillera, Sangay was formed by volcanic processes associated with the subduction of the Nazca Plate under the South American Plate at the Peru–Chile Trench. It is the southernmost volcano in the Northern Volcanic Zone, a subgroup of Andean volcanoes whose northern limit is Nevado del Ruiz in Colombia.\n\nThe next active volcano in the chain, Sabancaya, is in Peru, a distant to the south. Sangay lies above a seismogenic tectonic slab located about beneath Sabancaya, reflecting a sharp difference in the thermal character of the subducted oceanic crust, between older rock beneath southern Ecuador and Peru (dated more than 32 million years old), and younger rock under northern Ecuador and Colombia (dated less than 22 million years old). The older southern rock is more thermally stable than the northern crust, and to this is attributed the long break in volcanic activity in the Andes; Sangay occupies a position at the boundary between these two bodies, accounting for its high level of activity.\n\nSangay developed in three distinct phases. Its oldest edifice, formed between 500,000 and 250,000 years ago, is evidenced today by a wide scattering of material opening to the east, defined by a crest about high. This first Sangay, pockmarked by secondary ridges, is thought to have been in diameter, with a summit located southeast of the present summit. The curved shape of the remnants of this first structure indicates that it suffered a massive flank collapse, scattering the nearby forest lowlands with debris and causing a large part of its southern caldera wall to slide off the mountain, forming an embayment lower on its slopes. This thick block, the best preserved specimen of Sangay's early construction, consists of sequentially layered breccias, pyroclastic flows, and lahar deposits. Acidic andesites with just under 60% silicon dioxide dominate these flows, but more basic andesites can be found as well.\nSangay's second edifice began to form anew after the massive sector collapse that damaged the first, being constructed between 100,000 and 50,000 years ago. Remnants of its second structure lie within the southern and eastern parts of the debris from its first collapse; some remnants of the volcano lie to the west and north as well. Sangay's second structure is believed to have had an east-to-west elongated summit, and like its first summit structure, it suffered a catastrophic collapse that created a debris avalanche wide and up to in length. It was likely less voluminous than the volcano's first version, and its summit lay near Sangay's current one.\n\nSangay currently forms an almost perfect glacier-capped cone high, with a 35° slope and a slight northeast-southwest tilt. Its eastern flank marks the edge of the Amazon Rainforest, and its western flank is a flat plain of volcanic ash, sculpted into steep gorges up to deep by heavy rainfall. It has a west-east trending summit ridge, capped by three active craters and a lava dome. Sangay has been active in its current form for at least 14,000 years, and is still filling out the area left bare by its earlier incarnations, being smaller than either of them. Uniquely, in its 500,000 years of activity, its magma plume has never changed composition or moved a significant distance.\n\nMainly andesitic in composition, Sangay is highly active. The earliest report of a historical eruption was in 1628; ash fell as far away as Riobamba, located northwest of Sangay, and was severe enough to cover pastures and starve local livestock. The volcano erupted again in 1728, remaining essentially continuously active through 1916, with particularly heavy activity in 1738–1744, 1842–1843, 1849, 1854–1859, 1867–1874, 1872, and 1903. After a brief pause, it erupted again on August 8, 1934, and has not completely quelled ever since, with heavy eruptive periods occurring in 1934–1937 and 1941–1942.\n\nEruptions at Sangay exhibit strombolian activity, producing ashfall, lava flows, pyroclastic flows, and lahars. All known eruptions at the volcano have had a Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) of 3. Despite its activity, Sangay is located in a remote, uninhabited region; only a large Plinian eruption could threaten occupied areas to its west. Nonetheless, a flank collapse on its eastern side, possible given the volcano's construction and history, could displace nearby forest and possibly affect settlements. Access to the volcano is difficult, as its current eruptive state constantly peppers the massif with molten rock and other ejecta. For these reasons it is not nearly as well-studied as other, similarly-active volcanoes in the Andes and elsewhere; the first detailed study of the volcano was not published until 1999.\n\nSangay is one of two active volcanoes located within the namesake Sangay National Park, the other being Tungurahua to the north. As such it has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1983. The area's isolation has allowed it to maintain a pristine ecology relatively untouched by human interaction, and the park hosts a biome ranging from alpine glaciers on the volcanoes' peaks to tropical forest on their flanks. Altitude and rainfall are the most significant local factors affecting fauna, and therefore the most lush ecosystems are found on the wetter parts of the volcano's eastern slope.\n\nThe highest level below the snowline is dominated by lichen and bryophytes. Below this lies a zone of small trees and shrubs which develops into montane forest, principally in western valleys and on well-irrigated eastern slopes, which occurs below . Tree heights develop from near the top to up to below ; below , subtropical rainforest is present, with temperatures between and up to of rainfall.\n\nFauna is similarly distributed, with distinct altitudinal zonation present. The highest altitudes support the endangered mountain tapir (\"Tapirus pinchaque\"), cougar (\"Puma concolor\"), guinea pig (\"Cavia porcellus\"), and Andean fox (\"Lycalopex culpaeus\"). Lower down, the spectacled bear (\"Tremarctos ornatus\"), jaguar (\"Panthera onca\"), ocelot (\"Leopardus pardalis\"), margay (\"Leopardus wiedii\"), white-tailed deer (\"Odocoileus virginianus\"), brocket deers (\"Mazama sp.\"), vulnerable northern pudú (\"Pudu mephistophiles\"), and endangered giant otter (\"Pteronura brasiliensis\") can all be found. Bird species common in the area include the Andean condor (\"Vultur gryphus\"), Andean cock-of-the-rock (\"Rupicola peruvianus\"), giant hummingbird (\"Patagona gigas\"), torrent duck (\"Merganetta armata\"), king vulture (\"Sarcoramphus papa\"), and swallow-tailed kite (\"Elanoides forficatus\").\n\nSangay can and has been climbed. It was first ascended in 1929 by Robert T. Moore, prior to its current eruption beginning in 1934. However, the volcano's current active state presents dangers to mountaineers in the form of falling ejecta; in 1976, two members of an expedition on the volcano were struck and killed by falling debris. In addition, the volcano is located in a remote region with poor roads and is difficult to access, and periods of heavy rainfall can flood rivers and cause landslides, rendering the mountain routes impassable. Nonetheless, the Instituto Ecuatoriano Forestal y de Areas Naturales, which maintains an office near the mountain, facilitate such activities by providing local guides and rooms for rent to visitors. Ascension takes between 7 and 10 days from Quito. Conditions on the volcano are usually very wet and foggy, which may impair visibility significantly during the ascent.\n\n"}

It extends from former Highway 2 in Cornwall, north to Highway 417 east of Casselman. Highway 138 provides access to the Seaway International Bridge, connecting Cornwall with Massena, New York. The highway is in length.\n\nHighway 138 was first established in 1967, connecting Highway 2, now Vincent Massey Drive, with Highway 43 in Monkland. By the mid-1970s, the route had been extended north to meet with the newly opened Highway 417. Since then it has remained unchanged.\n\nHighway 138 is a highway that crosses the Laurentian Valley in eastern Ontario, connecting Highway 401 in Cornwall with Highway 417 east of Casselman.\n\nThe route begins at 9th Street West, which was Highway 2 until the late 90s, and proceeds north along the western side of Cornwall; this section is maintained under a Connecting Link agreement and is locally known as Brookdale Avenue.\nAfter crossing Highway 401, at which there is an interchange, the route encounters Cornwall Centre Road, onto which it turns east. After following it for a brief distance, the highway turns north onto St. Andrews Road; the Connecting Link agreement ends at this junction.\n\nOver the next two kilometres (1.25 mi), the highway exits the fringes of Cornwall, passing through the neighbourhood of Churchill Heights. After passing Headline Road (County Road 44), the route divides a forest and then enters an agricultural area before coming upon the community of St. Andrews West. It crosses the Raisin River and continues north through a mix of farmland and forests.\n\nLike other provincial routes in Ontario, Highway 138 is maintained by the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario. In 2010, traffic surveys conducted by the ministry showed that on average, 11,200 vehicles used the highway daily along the section between Cornwall Centre Road and Kings Road in Saint Andrews while 5,200 vehicles did so each day along the section between Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry County Roads 43 and 22, the highest and lowest counts along the highway, respectively.\n\nHighway 138 was established by the Department of Highways on May 1, 1967, following existing Stormont County roads between Highway 2 at the Seaway International Bridge and Highway 43.\nWith the construction of Highway 417 planned and progressing eastward from Ottawa, Highway 138 was extended north to its present terminus east of Casselman in 1971 or 1972.\n\nBudget constraints brought on by a recession in the 1990s resulted in the Mike Harris provincial government forming the \"Who Does What?\" committee to determine cost-cutting measures in order to balance the budget after a deficit incurred by former premier Bob Rae.\nIt was determined that many Ontario highways no longer serve long-distance traffic movement and should therefore be maintained by local or regional levels of government. The MTO consequently transferred many highways to lower levels of government in 1997 and 1998, removing a significant percentage of the provincial highway network.\nOn January 1, 1998, of Highway 138 was transferred to the City of Cornwall. This section is now known as Brookdale Avenue.\n"}

{"id": "1853052", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1853052", "title": "Basketball positions", "text": "Basketball positions\n\nThere are five positions in basketball. These positions are employed by all organized/unorganized basketball teams. They are defined as the point guard (PG), the shooting guard\n(SG), the small forward (SF), the power forward (PF), and the center (C).\n\nThe point guard is the \"de facto\" leader of the team on the court. This position requires substantial ball-handling skills and the ability to facilitate the team during a play. The shooting guard, as the name implies, is often the best shooter, as well as being capable of shooting accurately from longer distances. The small forward often has an aggressive approach to the basket when handling the ball. The small forward is also known to make cuts to the basket in efforts to get open for shots. The power forward and the center make up the frontcourt, often acting as their team's primary rebounders or shot blockers, or receiving passes to take inside shots. The center is typically the larger of the two.\n\nHistorically, only three positions were recognized (two guards, two forwards, and one center) based on where they played on the court: Guards generally played outside and away from the hoop and forwards played inside and near the baseline, with the center usually positioned in the key. During the 1980s, the team strategy evolved after the three-point shot was added to the game. More specialized roles developed, resulting in the five position designations used today. However, individual team strategy and availability of personnel can alter the positions used by a particular team. For example, the dribble-drive motion offense and the Princeton offense use four interchangeable guards and one center. This set is also known as a \"four-in and one-out\" play scheme. Other combinations are also prevalent.\n\nBesides the five basic positions, some teams use non-standard or hybrid positions, such as the point forward, a hybrid small forward/point guard; the swingman, a hybrid small forward/shooting guard; the big, a hybrid power forward/center; and the stretch four, a power forward with the shooting range of typical shooting guards.\n\nIn the early days of the sport, there was a \"running guard\" who brought the ball up the court and passed or attacked the basket, like a point or combo guard. There was also a \"stationary guard\" who made long shots and hung back on defense before there was the rule of backcourt violations.\n\nThe point guard (PG), known as the one, is typically the team's best ball handler and passer. They usually are very fast and are good at driving and short-range. Therefore, they often lead their team in assists and are able to create shots for themselves and their teammates. They are quick and are able to hit shots either outside the key but a majority are inside the 3 point line or layups, largely depending on the player's skill level. Point guards are looked upon as the \"floor general\" or the \"coach on the floor\". They should study the game and game film to be able to recognize the weaknesses of the defense, and the strengths of their own offense. They are responsible for directing plays, making the position equivalent to that of quarterback in American football, playmaker in association football (soccer), center in ice hockey, or setter in volleyball. Good point guards increase team efficiency and generally have a high number of assists. They are often referred to as dribblers or play-makers. In the NBA, point guards are usually the shortest players on the team and are mostly between and .\n\nThe shooting guard (SG) is also known as the two or the off guard. Along with the small forward, a shooting guard is often referred to as a wing because of its use in common positioning tactics. As the name suggests, most shooting guards are prolific from the three-point range and long mid range. Some key aspects to being a shooting guard is having the ability to patiently and methodically circulate the three point line linear with that of the ball. This allows the ability to correctly get in open space for other positions handling the ball. Just like all positions in basketball, the ability to communicate efficiently with teammates is key. If a player's teammates do not know where/when a player will be open, they won't be able to deliver the ball when an efficient opportunity presents itself. \n\nBesides being able to shoot the ball, shooting guards tend to be the best defender on the team, as well as being able to move without the ball to create open looks for themselves. Some shooting guards also have good ball handling skills, often creating their own shots off the dribble. A versatile shooting guard will have good passing skills, allowing them to assume point guard responsibilities known as combo guards. Bigger shooting guards also tend to play as small forwards. In the NBA, shooting guards usually range from 6 feet 0.75 inches (1.85 m) to 6 feet 7 inches (2.01 m).\n\nThe small forward (SF), also known as the three, is considered to be the most versatile of the main five basketball positions. \"Though they're not the primary ball handler, small forwards need dribbling skills. Though they're not expected to be great post players, they need to be able to post up. Though they're often not the top scoring option, they need to be able to score.\" Versatility is key for small forwards because of the nature of their role, which resembles that of a shooting guard more often than that of a power forward. This is why the small forward and shooting guard positions are often interchangeable and referred to as wings.\n\nSmall forwards have a variety of assets, such as quickness and strength inside. One common thread among all kinds of small forwards is an ability to \"get to the line\" and draw fouls by aggressively attempting (post-up) plays, lay-ups, or slam dunks. As such, accurate foul shooting is a common skill for small forwards, many of whom record a large portion of their points from the foul line. Besides being able to drive to the basket, they are also good shooters from long range. They are the second-best 3 point shooters on the court along with the shooting guard and usually when stationary, sit just inside the 3 point line. Some small forwards have good passing skills, allowing them to assume point guard responsibilities as point forwards. Small forwards should be able to do a little bit of everything on the court, typically playing roles such as swing men and defensive specialists. A smaller small forward under 6 feet 5 inches (1.96 m) might play the shooting guard position some of the time and a bigger small forward taller than 6 feet 7 inches (2.01 m) might play power forward sometimes. In the NBA, small forwards usually range from 6 feet 3.5 inches (1.92 m) to 6 feet 8.25 inches (2.04 m).\n\nThe power forward (PF), also known as the four, often plays a role similar to that of the center, down in the \"post\" or \"low blocks.\" The power forward is often the team's most powerful and dependent scorer, being able to score close to the basket while also being able to shoot mid-range jump shots from 10 - 15 feet from the basket. Some power forwards have become known as stretch fours, since extending their shooting range to three-pointers. On defense, they are required to have the strength to guard bigger players close to the basket and to have the athleticism to guard quick players away from the basket. Most power forwards tend to be more versatile than centers since they can be part of plays and are not always in the low block. A tall power forward over can be a forward-center, playing PF and C. A smaller power forward can play combo forward, playing SF part-time. In the NBA, power forwards usually range from to without shoes.\n\nThe center (C), also known as the five, usually plays near the baseline or close to the basket (the \"low post\"). They are usually the tallest players on the floor. The center usually scores \"down low,\" or \"in the paint\" (near the basket, in the key), but some can be good perimeter shooters. They are typically skilled at gathering rebounds, contesting shots and setting screens on players.\n\nThe center position has been traditionally considered one of the most important positions, if not the most important. The range of players used in the position has transitioned from relatively slower but much taller \"back to the basket\" players to players who would normally be classified as power forwards but can dominate the position with their defensive skills, or mismatch ability to shoot from the high post. This has been due to the scarcity of players possessing the combination of great skill, ideal height, and durability. This has been matched by the development of more fast-paced and athletic basketball play, which calls for less traditional center play and a more up-and-down the court play style. They are usually over tall.\n\n\n"}

They undergo a modest change between immature and adult, without going through a pupal stage. The nymphs develop gradually into adults through a process of moulting.\n\nThe Exopterygota are a highly diverse insect superorder, with at least 130,000 living species divided between 15 orders. They include cockroaches, termites, grasshoppers, thrips, lice and stick insects, among many other types of insects.\n\nThey are distinguished from the Endopterygota (or Holometabola) by the way in which their wings develop. Endopterygota (meaning literally \"internal winged forms\") develop wings inside the body and undergo an elaborate metamorphosis involving a pupal stage. Exopterygota (\"external winged forms\") develop wings on the outside of their bodies without going through a true pupal stage, though a few have something resembling a pupa (e.g., Aleyrodidae).\n\nEphemeroptera (mayflies) and Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) also have gradual wing development, this being a plesiomorphic trait. These two orders belong to the infraclass Palaeoptera however, which is not included in Neoptera. As opposed to Neoptera, they cannot fold their wings over their back in the horizontal plane, only vertically (as damselflies do) if at all.\n\nITIS considers any subdivision of the Neoptera beyond the orders invalid, but this is almost universally rejected.\n\nMore recently, there is increasing debate about how to subdivide the Exopterygota, and the Neoptera in general. It is realized that some presumed Exopterygota may in fact be basal neopterans, making the superorder paraphyletic.\n\nHere is a complete list of living and extinct orders of \"exopterygotes\", with some proposed subdivisions:\n\nSuperorder Exopterygota \"sensu stricto\"\nProposed superorder Dictyoptera\nProposed superorder Paraneoptera\n"}

The government had hoped to enlist the efforts of private merchants, to help them open Japan at far less cost to the government than if they had sent official emissaries or military.\n\nLastochkin volunteered for the mission, seeking the profits from either Japanese trade goods or furs from Hokkaidō. His first attempt failed entirely when his ship sank in the Sea of Okhotsk. But he, along with another merchant named Grigory Shelikhov, was granted trade monopoly over the Kuril Islands (a string of islands extending north from Japan to Siberia). The plan was to sail to Uruppu, one of the islands, with an expedition crew and about 40 settlers. They would set up a small colony town near Uruppu, and try to persuade some Ainu to guide them down to Japan. This second expedition failed as well when, after reaching Uruppu in the summer of 1775, the ship sank in a storm.\n\nLastochkin tried yet again, this time bringing a number of extra ships. It was now 1778, and the expedition met with the Lords of Matsumae clan, the Japanese guardians of the northern borders, for the first time. They bestowed gifts upon the \"samurai\" lords, and asked to trade. The \"samurai\" informed Lastochkin's party that they did not have the authority to make such agreements on behalf of the \"shōgun\", but that they should return the following year. Doing so, Lastochkin's gifts were returned, forbidden to return to Hokkaido, and informed that he should inquire at Nagasaki, on the southern island of Kyūshū, and inconveniently far from Russian holdings, if he wished to trade. Latoschkin returned to Uruppu to plan his next move.\n\nIn 1779, an earthquake caused a massive \"tsunami\", which tossed the Russian ship some distance inland. This finally convinced Latoschkin to give up on seeking trade with Japan. However, despite his failure to 'open' Japan to trade, he was still one of the first, if not the very first, Russian to meet Japanese, in Japan, in any official capacity.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1853066", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1853066", "title": "Arabesque (Turkish music)", "text": "Arabesque (Turkish music)\n\nArabesque or Arabesk () is a term created by Turkish musicologists for an Arabic style of music created in Turkey. The genre was particularly popular in Turkey in the decades from the 1960s through the 1990s. As with Arabic music itself, its aesthetics have evolved over the decades. Although melodies and rhythms are predominantly Byzantine and Arabic influenced, it also draws ideas from other aspects of Balkan and Middle Eastern music, including bağlama music and Ottoman forms of oriental music.\nArabesque music are mostly in a minor key, typically in the Phrygian mode, and themes tend to focus on longing, melancholy, strife and love issues.\n\nA very small percentage of Arabesk is exclusively instrumental. For the great majority of it, a singer lies at the center of the music. Male singers dominated the genre in its early years, but female singers probably predominated during its peak years of popularity. Simultaneously with the influx of female singers, the sound grew more dancey and upbeat.\nOrhan Gencebay is generally considered the founder of the genre (though he disagrees with the usage of the term). Other well known older singers are Müslüm Gürses, Ferdi Tayfur and Hakkı Bulut. One of the most prolific and commercially successful is İbrahim Tatlıses, who broke all sales records in Turkey in 1978 and continues to turn out popular music to this day. He has maintained popularity in the Arabesk scene in recent years through remixing his tracks into dance-friendly club tracks. The pure Arabesk album “Acıların Kadını” (tr: woman of pains) by the singer Bergen was the bestselling album in Turkey in 1986 and may be fairly labelled one of the classic albums of the genre. Bergen had several other hit Arabesk albums during the 1980s. Other singers include Ismail YK, Ebru Gündeş, Seda Sayan, Sibel Can. The singers Muazzez Ersoy and Bülent Ersoy designate themselves as modern exponents of Ottoman classical music. Zerrin Özer also made arabesque albums between 1982 and 1988, including her album named “Mutluluklar Dilerim” released in 1984. One of the important names of arabesque music who died in 2012 was Azer Bülbül.\nA common theme in Arabesque songs is the highly embellished and agonizing depiction of love and yearning, along with unrequited love, grief and pain. This theme had undertones of class differences in early 1960-70s, during which most of the genre's followers — mostly working class to lower middle class — identified themselves with. Turkish composer Fazıl Say has repeatedly condemned and criticized Arabesque genre, equating the practice of listening to Arabesque “tantamount to treason”.\n\n\n"}

The route connects Highway 417 south of Vankleek Hill with Hawkesbury. It is long, traveling through a mostly rural portion of the lower Ottawa Valley near the Ontario–Quebec border. The highway formerly continued south of Highway 417 to Highway 2 in Lancaster. However, this section was decommissioned as a provincial highway and was subsequently redesignated as Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry County Road 34.\n\nHighway 34 is short highway which today serves to connect the town of Hawkesbury with Highway 417. The route ends at Main Street, near the Ottawa River in downtown Hawkesbury. Between these two points, with the exception of the town of Vankleek Hill, the highway traverses the rural Ottawa Valley, remaining straight in a southwest–northeast orientation except through Hawkesbury. The majority of the land use surrounding the highway is composed of commercial shops in urban areas and agricultural in rural areas, though some small woodlots exist alongside the route. Two interchanges exist along the route: at the southern terminus with Highway 417 and with Prescott and Russell County Road 17 (former Highway 17).\n\nLike other provincial routes in Ontario, Highway 47 was maintained by the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario. In 1989, traffic surveys conducted by the ministry showed that on average, 5,050 vehicles used the highway daily along the section between Highway 417 and Vankleek Hill while 16,400 vehicles did so each day along the section between Prescott and Russell County Road 17 and Hawkesbury, the highest and lowest counts along the highway, respectively.\n\nHighway 34 has a very tame history, having been assumed in 1930 and remaining unchanged between then and the highway downloads of the late 1990s, with the exception of an interchange with Highway 417 opened in late 1974.\n\nOn November 26, 1930, the Department of Highways assumed the road between Lancaster and Hawkesbury as King's Highway 34, providing a connection between Highway 2 and Highway 17 immediately west of the Ontario–Quebec border.

The MTO consequently transferred many highways to lower levels of government in 1997 and 1998, removing a significant percentage of the provincial highway network.\nIt was determined that the portion of Highway 34 south of Highway 417 had largely been supplanted by the nearby Highway 138, and no longer served long-distance traffic movement. As such, the section of Highway 34 within the United Counties of Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry was decommissioned as a provincial highway and transferred to that jurisdiction on January 1, 1998.\nIt has since been redesignated as Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry County Road 34.\n\n"}

It is located on 11.5 km² of land north of the Manawatu Gorge in the North Island of New Zealand. At 90.75 MW, it was New Zealand's largest capacity wind farm until September 2007, when the third stage of the nearby Tararua Wind Farm was completed.\nThe $100 million wind farm consists of 55 separate turbines capable of generating 1.65 MW each, representing a total capacity of 90.75 MW. Each turbine is atop a tower. It is fitted with 3 blades each 35 metres in length.\n\nThe site near the Manawatu Gorge area is ideal for wind farms. The Tararua and Ruahine Ranges provide a barrier to the predominantly westerly winds that flow across New Zealand. Between the two ranges lies a lower range of hills that serve to funnel the wind. TrustPower, another New Zealand electricity generator and retailer, operates a wind farm on the south side of the Manawatu Gorge.\n\nThe Te Apiti wind farm is also a carbon offset project. In 2005 the British bank HSBC purchased 125,000 tonnes worth of carbon credits from Meridian generated by the wind farm. Meridian Energy also sold the Dutch government 530,000 tonnes of carbon credits from Te Apiti. The price per tonne was considered to be about $10.40 a tonne. In both cases, the carbon credits for Te Apiti were from New Zealand's Assigned amount units allocated under the Kyoto Protocol. The New Zealand Government granted the AAUs to Meridian Energy as an incentive for carbon neutral power development under the Projects to Reduce Emissions programme (or PRE).\n\nAs of 2007, installed capacity of wind turbines in New Zealand has reached 321 MW and a further 46.5 MW is under construction.\n\nTe Apiti was the first wind farm in New Zealand to connect directly to Transpower's national grid. Previously constructed windfarms, including Hau Nui and Tararua, connected to the national grid via local distribution and sub-transmission lines.\n\nElectricity from the 55 turbines is sent via a network of underground cables to the Te Apiti substation near the lookout, where the electricity is stepped-up to 110 kV for transmission. A single-circuit transmission line connects the wind farm to the national grid at Transpower's Woodville substation.\n\nThe New Zealand online education programme, LEARNZ, conducted a virtual field trip to Te Apiti Wind Farm in April 2008.

{"id": "1853097", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1853097", "title": "Well-made play", "text": "Well-made play\n\nThe well-made play (, pronounced ) is a dramatic genre from nineteenth-century theatre first codified by French dramatist Eugène Scribe. Dramatists Victorien Sardou, Alexandre Dumas, fils, and Emile Augier wrote within the genre, each putting a distinct spin on the style. The well-made play was a popular form of entertainment. By the mid-19th century, however, it had already entered into common use as a derogatory term. Henrik Ibsen and the other realistic dramatists of the later 19th century (August Strindberg, Gerhart Hauptmann, Émile Zola, Anton Chekhov) built upon its technique of careful construction and preparation of effects in the genre problem play. \"Through their example\", Marvin Carlson explains, \"the well-made play became and still remains the traditional model of play construction.\"\nIn the English language, that tradition found its early 20th-century codification in Britain in the form of William Archer's \"Play-Making: A Manual of Craftmanship\" (1912), and in the United States with George Pierce Baker's \"Dramatic Technique\" (1919).\n\nThe form has a strong Neoclassical flavour, involving a tight plot and a climax that takes place close to the end of the play. The well-made play retains the shape of Aristotle's ideal Greek-tragedy model outlined in his \"Poetics\".\n\nThe well-made play can be broken down into a specific set of criteria. First, the story depends upon a key piece of information kept from some characters, but known to others (and to the audience). Most of the story takes place before the action of the play begins, making the beginning of the play a late point of attack. Exposition during act one explains actions that precede the opening scene, and generates the audience's sympathy for the hero (or heroes) over their rival (or rivals). The plot moves forward in a chain of actions that use minor reversals of fortune to create suspense. The pace builds towards a climactic obligatory scene, in which the hero triumphs. This scene contains a climactic reversal of fortune, or peripeteia. A dénouement follows, in which all remaining plot points are unraveled and resolved.\n\nA recurrent device that the well-made play employs is the use of letters or papers falling into unintended hands, in order to bring about plot twists and climaxes. The letters bring about an unexpected and climactic reversal of fortune, in which it is often revealed that someone is not who they pretend to be. Mistaken or mysterious identity as a basis for plot complications is referred to as \"quid pro quo\".\n\nEugene Scribe contributed over 300 plays and opera libretti to the dramatic literature canon. Thirty-five of these works are considered well-made-plays.\n\nHistory of French Neoclassic form lays a critical foundation for Scribe, who draws upon devices determined by the French Academy to create his dramatic structure. French Neoclassicism conceives of Verisimilitude, or the appearance of a plausible truth, as the aesthetic goal of a play. In 1638, the French Academy codified a system by which dramatists could achieve Verisimilitude in a verdict on the Le Cid debate. The monarchy enforced the standards of French Neoclassicism with a system of censorship under which funding and practice permits were issued to a limited number of theater companies. This system underwent small modifications, but remained essentially the same up until the French Revolution. Until then, restrictive laws inhibited the growth of new practices with the exception of those advocated by a few intrepid dramatists such as Voltaire, Diderot, and Beaumarchais. After the French Revolution, adherence to the form became an artistic choice instead of a political necessity.\n\nAlthough Scribe drew heavily upon Neoclassic devices, he used them in original ways that would not have been acceptable without new popular forms, such as those developed at the Boulevard theatres. In order to work around the formal monopoly of the Comédie Française in the middle of the 18th century, theater troupes experimenting with new dramatic forms sprang up along the Boulevard du Temple. Their aim was to escape the censors, and please the public. Popular reception of the boulevard theatres' explorations helped to crack the edifice of Neoclassic form. After the French Revolution, French theater opened to the influence of practices that had meanwhile developed in other places around Europe.\n\nScribe's development of a form that could be used repeatedly to turn out new material suited the demands of a growing middle class theater audience.\n\nScribe's influence on theater, according to Marvin J. Carlson, \"cannot be overestimated\". Carlson observes that, unlike other influential theater thinkers, Scribe did not write prefaces or manifestos declaiming his ideas. Scribe influenced theater, instead, with craftsmanship. He honed a dramatic form into a reliable mould that could be applied not only to different content, but to different content from a variety of playwrights. Carlson identifies a single instance of Scribe's critical commentary from a speech Scribe gave to the Académie française in 1836. Scribe expressed his view of what draws the audiences to theater:\n\n\"not for instruction or improvement, but for diversion and distraction, and that which diverts them [audience] most is not truth, but fiction. To see again what you have before your eyes daily will not please you, but that which is not available to you in every day life - the extraordinary and the romantic.\"\n\nAlthough Scribe advocated for a theater of amusement over didacticism, other writers, beginning with Alexandre Dumas, fils, adopted Scribe's structure to create didactic plays. In a letter to a critic, Dumas \"fils\" states,\"... if I can find some means to force people to discuss the problem, and the lawmaker to revise the law, I shall have done more than my duty as a writer, I shall have done my duty as a man.\". Dumas' thesis plays are plays written in the well-made style that take clear moral positions on social issues of the day. Emile Augier also used Scribe's formula to write plays addressing contemporary social issues, although he declares his moral position less strongly.\n\nBy the late 19th century, the well-made play had fallen out of critical favor. Shaw was among those who held the form in low regard, \"Why the devil should a man write like Scribe when he can write like Shakespeare or Moliere, Aristophanes or Euripides? Who was Scribe that he should dictate to me or anyone else how a play should be written?\" In reference to the form's tendency to favor amusing plot twists over complexly drawn characters, Shaw referred to the genre as Sardoodledom after Victorien Sardou, who also wrote in the well-made style.\n\nThe opening to the preface to \"Three Plays by Brieux\" offers another example of Shavian disdain for the well-made plays. Shaw identifies the process of creating them as an industry, and their creators as “literary mechanics” instead of artists. To convey how vulgar he finds a widely used playwrighting formula, Shaw interprets the aphorism \"Art for art's sake,\" as \"Success for money's sake.\"\n\nIn an essay published in PMLA in 1951, \"Pygmalion: Bernard Shaw’s Dramatic Theory and Practice\", Milton Crane reasons that Shaw’s disparagement of the classic well-made formula, and his desire to pry Ibsen’s work away from association with the works of Scribe and Sardou, serve a specific agenda. Crane argues that Shaw aims to prevent his own use of the well-made formula from linking his plays with work considered out of fashion. Shaw’s theory of the problem play and discussion ideas align his plays with Ibsen’s, and distinguishes them from stale plays of the past. Crane observes that Shaw, by his own admission, learned dramatic structure from contemporary popular theatre which was then dominated by the well-made formula. Crane goes on to argue how that formula is present in \"Pygmalion\", \"Man and Superman\", and \"The Doctor’s Dilemma\".\n\nShaw discusses the notion of the problem play in an essay of the same title published in 1895. He defines a problem play as one that puts a person or people in conflict with an institution, confronting a contemporary social question. He cites the \"Woman question\" as a contemporary example. Ibsen's engagement with the \"Woman question\" in \"A Doll's House\" and \"Ghosts\" qualifies those works as problem plays. Shaw distinguishes between the problem play and literature with conflicts reflecting a more universal view of the human condition. Works whose fundamental conflict does not pit human against institution, he argues, are more apt to remain relevant through generations. He cites \"Hamlet\", \"Faust\", and \"Les Misérables\" as examples of stories whose conflicts involve more eternal human questions. Shaw observes that the immediacy of the institutional question addressed in a problem play will render the play \"flat as ditchwater\" once society progresses and the issue is resolved. Although Ibsen was hailed by feminists, he did not regard himself as an advocate for any particular group.\n\nIbsen's aim, according to Raymond Williams, was to express tragedies in the human condition. Ibsen qualifies a human tragedy as the state \"[when a person] stands in a tight place; he cannot go forwards or backwards.” Williams also cites the specific characteristic that distinguishes his and Ibsen's modern drama from the preceding well-made formula. The well-made formula, Shaw observes, can be divided into three sections: Exposition, Situation, Unraveling. The plays of Ibsen and Shaw, Shaw himself asserts, do not end with a classic unraveling. Their work can be divided as: Exposition, Situation, Discussion.\n\nOscar Wilde's \"The Importance of Being Earnest\" exaggerates many of the conventions of the well-made play, such as the missing papers conceit (the hero, as an infant, was confused with the manuscript of a novel) and a final revelation (which, in this play, occurs about thirty seconds before the final curtain).\n\nHenrik Ibsen's \"A Doll's House\" follows most of the conceits of the well-made play, but transcends the genre when, after incriminating papers are recovered, Nora rejects the expected return to normality. Several of Ibsen's subsequent plays build on the general construction principles of the well-made play. \"The Wild Duck\" (1884) can be seen as a deliberate, meta-theatrical deconstruction of the Scribean formula. Ibsen sought a compromise between Naturalism and the well-made play which was fraught with difficulties since life does not fall easily into either form.\n\nAlthough George Bernard Shaw scorned the \"well-made play\", he accepted the form, and even thrived by it, for it concentrated his skills on the conversation among characters, his greatest asset as a dramatist. Other classic twists on the well-made play can be seen in his use of the General's coat and the hidden photograph in \"Arms and the Man\".\n\nAlso, J. B. Priestley's 1946 \"An Inspector Calls\" may in some ways be considered a \"well-made play\" in that its action happens before the play starts, and in the case of the older Birlings no moral change takes place. The similarity between Priestley's play and this rather conservative genre might strike some readers/audiences as surprising because Priestley was a socialist. However, his play, like Ibsen's \"A Doll's House\" transcends this genre by providing another plunge into chaos after the return to normality. He replaced the dramatic full stop with a question mark by revealing in the last scene that the 'inspector' who has exposed the complicity of a prosperous industrial family in the murder or suicide of a working-class girl, is not an inspector at all (perhaps a practical joker, an emanation of the world to come, or a manifestation of the world to come), and the curtain falls on the news that a real girl has died and a real inspector is on the way.\n\nThe techniques of well-made plays also lend themselves to comedies of situation, often farce. In \"The Quintessence of Ibsenism\", Bernard Shaw proposed that Ibsen converted this formula for use in \"serious\" plays by substituting discussion for the plausible dénouement or conclusion. Thus, plays become open-ended, as if there were life for the protagonists beyond the last act curtain.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1853101", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1853101", "title": "Tetrabiblos", "text": "Tetrabiblos\n\nTetrabiblos () 'four books', also known in Greek as Apotelesmatiká () \"Effects\", and in Latin as Quadripartitum \"Four Parts\", is a text on the philosophy and practice of astrology, written in the 2nd century AD by the Alexandrian scholar Claudius Ptolemy ( AD 90– AD 168).\n\nPtolemy's \"Almagest\" was an authoritative text on astronomy for more than a thousand years, and the \"Tetrabiblos\", its companion volume, was equally influential in astrology, the study of the effects of astronomical cycles on earthly matters. But whilst the \"Almagest\" as an astronomical authority was superseded by acceptance of the heliocentric model of the Solar System, the \"Tetrabiblos\" remains an important theoretical work for astrology.\n\nBesides outlining the techniques of astrological practice, Ptolemy's philosophical defense of the subject as a natural, beneficial study helped secure theological tolerance towards astrology in Western Europe during the Medieval era. This allowed Ptolemaic teachings on astrology to be included in universities during the Renaissance, which brought an associated impact upon medical studies and literary works.\nThe historical importance of the \"Tetrabiblos\" is seen by the many ancient, Medieval and Renaissance commentaries that have been published about it. It was copied, commented on, paraphrased, abridged, and translated into many languages. The latest critical Greek edition, by Wolfgang Hübner, was published by Teubner in 1998.\n\nPtolemy is referred to as \"the most famous of Greek astrologers\" and \"a pro-astrological authority of the highest magnitude\". As a source of reference his \"Tetrabiblos\" is described as having \"enjoyed almost the authority of a Bible among the astrological writers of a thousand years or more\". Compiled in Alexandria in the 2nd century, the work gathered commentaries about it from its first publication. It was translated into Arabic in the 9th century, and is described as \"by far the most influential source of medieval Islamic astrology\".\n\nWith the translation of the \"Tetrabiblos\" into Latin in the 12th century, \"Ptolemaic astrology\" became integrated by Albertus Magnus and Thomas Aquinas into medieval Christian doctrine. This theological acceptance encouraged the teaching of Ptolemaic astrology in universities, often linked to medical studies. This, in turn, brought attention in literary works, such as Dante's, which helped shape the moral, religious and cosmological paradigm of Western Europe during the Medieval era. The \"Tetrabiblos\" was largely responsible for laying down the basic precepts of Renaissance astrology, and was a necessary textbook in some of the finest universities of Renaissance and early modern Europe. \n\nPtolemaic astrology continued to be taught at European universities into the 17th century, but by the mid-17th century the study struggled to maintain its position as one of the respected Liberal sciences. At this time, the contents of the \"Tetrabiblos\" started to draw stigmatisation as part of \"a diabolical art of divination\". One 17th-century critic was to write of its subject: \"no superstitious art is more fitted to forward the aims of the devil than the astrology of Ptolemy\".\n\nThe intellectual standing of astrology collapsed rapidly at the end of the 17th century, but the historical impact of the \"Tetrabiblos\" upon world culture continues to engage the attention of scholars of classical philosophy and the history of sciences in antiquity. It also maintains its position as an influential textbook for practitioners of modern western astrology, and English translations of the text were published by astrologers in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. The early 20th-century Humanist astrologer Dane Rudhyar reported that the astrology of his era \"originated almost entirely in the work of the Alexandrian astrologer, Claudius Ptolemy\". Even 21st-century astrological textbooks have described the \"Tetrabiblos\" as being \"without a doubt, indispensable for any serious student of astrology\".\n\nThe work's enduring significance is attributed to several factors: Ptolemy's reputation as one of the greatest philosophers and scientists of the ancient world, the text's astrological importance as one of the oldest complete manuals on that subject, and the unprecedented order and quality of Ptolemy's astrological explanations.\n\nThe \"outstanding mark of Ptolemy’s astrology\" is described as \"informed by the philosophical and scientific spirit of his age\". Ptolemy wrote at a time when \"physics\" was defined by philosophy, and his account of stellar effects was expressed in terms of the four Aristotelian qualities (hot, cold, wet, and dry) set against the philosophical notion of universal unity and cosmic harmony. His objective was to explain the rationale of astrology in such terms, so the work is also notable for its dismissal of astrological practices which lack a direct astronomical basis:\n\nThe book opens with an explanation of the philosophical framework of astrology which aims to answer the arguments of critics who questioned the subject's validity. Of this, Lynn Thorndike, in his \"History of Magic and Experimental Science\", writes: \"Only the opponents of astrology appear to have remained ignorant of the \"Tetrabiblos\", continuing to make criticisms of the art which do not apply to Ptolemy's presentation of it or which had been specifically answered by him\".\n\nPtolemy was not responsible for originating the astrological techniques he presented in the \"Tetrabiblos\". His contribution was to arrange the material systematically, in order to demonstrate that astrology is based upon logical, hierarchical principles. Astrological influences are frequently referred to the meteorological effects of humoral shifts, which were presumed to result from celestial cycles bringing correlated changes in the heating, cooling, moistening, and drying effects of the atmosphere.\n\nThe historical importance and influence of the \"Tetrabiblos\" is attested by the many ancient, Medieval and Renaissance commentaries published about it, as well as the many translations and paraphrased editions that aim to reproduce its content in an accessible manner. The Greek text has undergone transmission into Arabic, Latin and many modern languages. The first English translation did not appear until the 18th century, but by the end of the 19th century the American astrologer Luke Broughton reported he had at least half a dozen different English translations in his possession.\n\nThe commonly known Greek and Latin titles (\"Tetrabiblos\" and \"Quadripartitum\" respectively), meaning 'four books', are traditional nicknames for a work which in some Greek manuscripts is entitled , 'Mathematical treatise in four books'. Frank Eggleston Robbins, editor of the Loeb English translation published in 1940, considered it likely that this was the title used by Ptolemy himself, although he acknowledged that many other Greek manuscripts use the title , 'The prognostics addressed to Syrus'. An ancient anonymous commentary on the work states that some considered the term \"Tetrabiblos\" to be a fictitious name.\n\nHübner, editor of the 1998 Teubner Greek edition, uses the title \"Apotelesmatiká\" (\"biblía\"), '(books on) effects', which has been followed by recent scholars. Alexander Jones, editor of the Springer publication \"Ptolemy in Perspective\" (2010), considers that Ptolemy's own title remains unknown, but agrees that the term \"Apotelesmatika\" is \"a credible guess\". This term is variously translated to mean 'influences', 'effects' or 'prognostics'; reflecting the theme of work, which is concerned with gaining foreknowledge of the effects of predictable astronomical cycles.\n\nThere is no firmly established date for the compilation of the \"Tetrabiblos\", but Ptolemy discloses in his 'Introductory Address' that he wrote his astrological treatise after completing his astronomical one: the \"Almagest\". Evidence within the \"Almagest\" reveals that the astronomical work could not have been completed before about 145 AD, which demonstrates that Ptolemy wrote the \"Tetrabiblos\" towards the end of his life, sometime between completing the \"Almagest\" and his death, generally reported to be around 168 A.D.\n\nThe text begins with Ptolemy's address to \"Syrus\", an unidentified character to whom all Ptolemy's works are dedicated. In this Ptolemy differentiates between two types of astronomical study: the first (astronomy proper) which discovers the astronomical cycles and movements; the second (astrology) which investigates the changes these movements bring about. He states that each has its own science and the former is desirable in its own right \"even though it does not attain the result given by its combination with the second\". This is taken to demonstrate Ptolemy's view that astronomy and astrology are complementary studies, so that whilst astrology is less self-sufficient and factual, its employment makes the practice of astronomy more useful. Although the terms \"astronomia\" and \"astrologia\" were used interchangeably in ancient texts, this also demonstrates the early definition of two differentiated subjects which were discussed at length by Ptolemy in two separate works.\n\nPtolemy states that having dealt with the former subject (astronomy) in its own treatise, he \"shall now give an account of the second and less self-sufficient method in a properly philosophical way, so that one whose aim is the truth might never compare its perceptions with the sureness of the first\". In this, and further introductory remarks, he reveals his view that astrological prediction is extremely difficult and easily subject to error, but satisfactorily attainable to those who possess the necessary skill and experience, and of too much benefit to be dismissed simply because it can sometimes be mistaken.\n\nChapters 2 and 3 are important for giving Ptolemy's philosophical defense of his subject. Franz Boll noticed the arguments were paralleled in older sources, particularly those of the Stoic philosopher Posidonius (135 BCE–AD 51 BCE). Equally, Ptolemy's narrative was drawn upon by later philosophers and astronomers, such as Johannes Kepler, who used similar examples and the same order of arguments to explain the physical foundation of some astrological claims. Described as \"scientifically speaking, perfectly laudable\" by one modern commentator, another has condemned these chapters as the place where Ptolemy's \"knowledge, intelligence and rhetorical skill\" are most \"misused\".\n\nIn chapter one Ptolemy asserts the legitimacy of the study and identifies the two main arguments set against it: \nPtolemy then answers each criticism in the following two chapters.\n\nIn chapter two Ptolemy maintains that knowledge gained by astronomical means is attainable and he attempts to define its limits according to \"Aristotelian-Stoic\" logic. He points out how the Sun has the greatest influence upon the Earth's seasonal and daily cycles, and that most things in nature are synchronised by the Moon:\n\nHe extends this ability to stir the weather and steer the biological patterns of earthly creatures to the fixed stars and planets, so that everything which experiences cycles of growth, or patterns of behaviour, is in some way responsive to the celestial cycles. These bring about elemental changes (hot, windy, snowy or watery conditions, \"etc\"): led by the Sun, activated by the Moon and aided by the planetary configurations and the fixed stars' phenomena. The prevailing meteorological qualities are then considered to determine the temperament – the quality of the moment of time at a specific place – which is presumed to be impressed, as a sort of temporal imprint, upon the seed of anything which comes into germination or manifestation at that moment in time. Ptolemy admits that successful analysis of this temperament is not easily attained but is capable of being determined by someone who is able to regard the data \"both scientifically and by successful conjecture\". He questions why, if a person can reliably predict the general weather patterns and their effects upon agricultural seeds and animals from the knowledge of the celestial cycles: \n\nWhilst suggesting that such arguments are enough to demonstrate the validity of astrology, Ptolemy accepts that many mistakes are made in its practice – partly because of \"evident rascals\" who profess to practice it without due knowledge and pretend to foretell things which cannot be naturally known (sometimes using the term 'astrology' for practices which are not true to the genuine study of astrology) and because legitimate practitioners must acquire a magnitude of knowledge and experience within a limited life-span. His summary is that the study is usually only able to give reliable knowledge in general terms; that astrological advice should be welcomed but not expected to be faultless; and that the astrologer should not be criticised but encouraged to integrate non-celestial information within the compilation of a judgement (such as what is known of an individual's ethnic background, nationality and parental influences).\n\nIn chapter three Ptolemy argues that astrological prediction is both natural and beneficial. The translation of these ideas into Latin in the 12th century are described as being \"of critical importance\" to the adoption of a favourable attitude towards astrology within Christianity in the Medieval period.\nPtolemy first proposes that it is not \"useless\" to create predictions of what is likely to happen, even if the predictions do not provide the means to avoid impending disaster. This was one of the well known classical criticisms that had been brought to prominence in Cicero's text \"De Divinatione\", in the argument that no good comes from warnings of imminent disasters when they offer no means of escape. Ptolemy gives a more positive view of divination in his assessment of astrology as a subject \"by which we gain full view of things human and divine\", which, he argues, gives a better perception of \"what is fitting and expedient for the capabilities of each temperament\". He views astrology as a subject which encourages enhanced self-knowledge, to be valued as a source of pleasure and well-being; since even if astrology cannot aid in the acquisition of riches or fame; the same can be said of all philosophy, which concerns itself with \"greater advantages\". Hence, in the case of unfortunate events that will necessarily take place, Ptolemy asserts that astrological prediction still brings benefits, because \"foreknowledge accustoms and calms the soul by experience of distant events as though they were present, and prepares it to greet with calm and steadiness whatever comes\".\n\nPtolemy's next argument was to avoid the criticisms that arise when the practice of prediction is seen to suggest fatal necessity. This point was crucial to later theological acceptance, since Medieval religious doctrine dictates that the individual soul must possess free will, in order to be responsible for its own choices and the consequences that flow from them. Gerard of Feltre's 13th-century text \"Summa on the Stars\" demonstrates the problem that astrological determinism creates for the theological argument: \"If the stars make a man a murderer or a thief, then all the more it is the first cause, God, who does this, which it is shameful to suggest\". Ptolemy's comments counter the criticism by proposing that whilst the celestial cycles are entirely reliable and \"eternally performed in accordance with divine, unchangeable destiny\", all earthly things are also subject to \"a natural and mutable fate, and in drawing its first causes from above it is governed by chance and natural sequence\". He therefore declares that nothing is irrevocably ordained, and we are not to imagine that \"events attend mankind as the result of the heavenly cause as if … destined to take place by necessity without the possibility of any other cause whatever interfering\".\n\nIn this discussion Ptolemy makes a point that was to be called upon by many later astrological writers, that \"the lesser cause always yields to the stronger\". He sees an individual as unable to resist the greater cycles of change which happen to the wider community, so even a man whose horoscope indicates gain may perish at a time that his community is struck by natural disaster or pestilence. However, Ptolemy also maintains that disastrous events will only follow a natural course if no counter action is taken to avert the problem, as when \"future happenings to men are not known, or if they are known and the remedies are not applied\". He takes a balanced position in the argument of fate versus free will in writing that certain things, because their effective causes are numerous, become inevitable, whilst others are able to be averted by the act of astrological prediction. The astrologer's position is compared to that of the physician, who must be able to recognise beforehand which ailments are always fatal, and which admit of aid.\n\nIt is therefore reasonable, in Ptolemy's estimation, to moderate actions with awareness of how the prevailing and future temperament prospers or injures the natal temperament, or to elect to act at a time that is astrologically suitable to the activity – just as it is deemed rational to use knowledge of the stars to ensure safety at sea; to use knowledge of the lunar cycle to ensure successful breeding and sowing, or to cool ourselves against the extremes of temperature in order that we suffer less.\n\nPtolemy's philosophical conclusion on the subject, which helped to secure its intellectual standing until the 18th century, is thus: \"even if it be not entirely infallible, at least its possibilities have appeared worthy of the highest regard\". Having justified his intellectual involvement in the study, according to the philosophical principles of his day, Ptolemy then turns his attention to the practical theory of astrology, and the rationale that lies behind the arrangement of its principles.\n\nOne of the unique features of the \"Tetrabiblos\", amongst the astrological texts of its period, is the extent to which the first book not only introduces the basic astrological principles, but synthesises and explains the reasoning behind their reported associations in line with Aristotelian philosophy. Chapter four, for example, explains the \"power of the planets\" through their associations with the creative humoral qualities of warmth or moisture, or the reductive qualities of cold and dryness. Hence Mars is described as a destructive planet because its humoral association is excessive dryness, whilst Jupiter is defined as temperate and fertilising because its association is moderate warmth and humidity. These associations are based on the arrangements of the planets with regard to the Sun, as perceived from the geocentric perspective, by which their orbits are measured is if they are centred upon the Earth.\n\nUniting these Aristotelian principles with a prevalent Greek philosophy employed by Zeno of Citium and the Pythagoreans, the next three chapters arrange the planets into pairs of opposites. They may be benefic (moderately warming or moistening) or malefic (excessively cooling or drying); masculine (drying) or feminine (moistening); active and diurnal (suited to the qualities of the day and aligned with the nature of the Sun) or passive and nocturnal (suited to the qualities of the night and aligned with the nature of the Moon). Since these humoral associations derive from configurations with the Sun, chapter eight describes how they are subtly modified according to the phase of each planet's synodic cycle with the Sun.\n\nChapter nine discusses the \"power of the fixed stars\". Here, rather than give direct humoral associations, Ptolemy describes their \"temperatures\" as being like that of the planets he has already defined. Hence Aldebaran (\"called the Torch\") is described as having \"a temperature like that of Mars\", whilst other stars in the Hyades are \"like that of Saturn and moderately like that of Mercury\". At the end of the chapter Ptolemy clarifies that these are not his proposals, but are drawn from historical sources, being \"the observations of the effects of the stars themselves as made by our predecessors\".\n\nChapter ten returns to the humoral theme more explicitly, clarifying that the zodiac is aligned to the seasons and so expressive of the shifting emphasis through moisture, warmth, dryness and cold, (as brought about by spring, summer, autumn, and winter). Similarly, the four angles of the chart present an humoral emphasis through association with the effects of the four cardinal winds that blow from their aligned directions. The remainder of book one (up to the final two chapters which concern the planetary phases and aspectual applications), presents the rulerships, divisions, and configurations of the zodiac signs, most of which are related to astronomical definitions, seasonal effects, physics and geometry. Geometrical principles are used to define the favourable or unfavourable quality of astrological aspects, based on the angular relationship of planets and signs with ecliptic degrees.\n\nIn Ptolemy's era the boundaries of the zodiac signs were close to those of the visible constellations whose names they bear, but Ptolemy demonstrates the theoretical distinction between the two frames of reference in describing the starting point of the zodiac as fixed, not to the stars, but to the mathematically calculated vernal equinox. This determines the seasonally based tropical zodiac which takes its name from the Greek word τροπικός \"tropikos\": ‘of the turning’, because it is set by the turn of the seasons and, being subject to precession, experiences a slow and gradual revolution through the visible constellations. For the same reason, the signs that mark the Sun's summer and winter solstice points (Cancer and Capricorn) are described as the 'tropical signs', since these are the places where the Sun 'turns' its direction in celestial latitude, (thereby defining the terrestrial circles of latitude known as the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn).\n\nWhereas other ancient astrological writers gave their emphasis to the astrological interpretation of such definitions (for example, in describing how tropical signs are indicative of quickly changing situations), Ptolemy's focus is notably different; given to the astronomical and philosophical factors that underlie the definitions rather than their astrological meaning in practice. Ptolemy explains that the definitions of the zodiac are not his own, but present \"the natural characters of the zodiacal signs, as they have been handed down by tradition\". His approach finds elegant expression where he is demonstrating the logic of schematic arrangements (such as the philosophical principles behind the planetary rulership of signs), but is noted to convey detachment in regard to the elements of astrology that are not so obviously plausible. This can be seen in the way that Ptolemy avoids going into detail on the facets of astrology that rely on mythological, or symbolic associations, and how he is willing to outline the reasoning behind conflicting astrological proposals without revealing any personal preference for one scheme over another.\n\nSome commentators have viewed Ptolemy's comparatively dispassionate approach towards points of astrological contention as reason to suppose he was more interested in the theoretical principles than the actual practice of astrology. On the other hand, the objective tone that marks his style; his assertion that the subject is natural (by which he makes no demand for oaths of secrecy from its students as some contemporaries do); and the way he shows respectful reference to alternative views without vilifying authors whose practices might differ from his own, all helped to secure the text's historical reputation as an intellectually superior one. Classics scholar Mark Riley raised these points in his assessment that Ptolemy approached the subject of astrology with exactly the same theoretical inclination that he applied to astronomy, geography and the other sciences on which he wrote. This distinctive style of approach led Riley to conclude: \"The respect shown to Ptolemy’s work by all later astrologers was due, not to its usefulness to the practitioner, but to his magisterial synthesis of astrology and science\".\nBook II presents Ptolemy's treatise on mundane astrology. This offers a comprehensive review of ethnic stereotypes, eclipses, significations of comets and seasonal lunations, as used in the prediction of national economics, wars, epidemics, natural disasters and weather patterns. No other surviving ancient text offers a comparable account of this topic, in terms of the breadth and depth of detail offered by Ptolemy. Although no demonstrated examples are given, he writes with authority in this branch of his subject, which suggests it was of particular interest to him. Modern commentators have remarked that Ptolemy was \"consciously taking a different approach\" to contrast \"with the 'old', infinitely complicated methods\".\n\nPtolemy begins by stating he has briefly reviewed the important principles and will now develop the details of astrology in the appropriate order. His point is that astrological assessment of any 'particular' individual must rest upon prior knowledge of the 'general' temperament of their ethnic type; and that the circumstances of individual lives are subsumed, to some extent, within the fate of their community.\n\nThe second chapter gives a broad generalisation of how differences in physical traits occur between the inhabitants of the various climes (a demarcation based on latitude). Communities that live close to the equator, for example, are described as having black skins, small statures, and thick woolly hair, as a protective response to the burning heat of that location. By contrast, communities that have settled in high northern regions are defined by their colder environment and its greater share of moisture. Their bodily forms are paler, taller, with finer hair, and in their characteristics they are described as \"somewhat cold in nature\". Both types are described as lacking civilisation because of the extremes of their environment, whereas communities that live in temperate regions are medium in colouring, moderate in stature and enjoy a more equable lifestyle. The several regions are similarly defined according to the mix that arises within this kind of analysis. Ptolemy explains that such considerations are only dealt with summarily, as a background consideration for what follows. He also makes clear that such traits are to be found \"generally present, but not in every individual\".\n\nIn chapter 3 Ptolemy unites his interests in astrology and geography, to outline the astrological associations of \"our inhabited world\". Maps based on Ptolemy's \"Geographica\" show Ptolemy's definition of the inhabited world as (roughly) extending from the equator to latitude 66°N, covering the land mass between the Atlantic Ocean and East China Sea. Ptolemy extends the logic given in ancient Babylonian texts where the four quarters of the known world are attributed to the four triplicity arrangements of the zodiac. The attribution is based on association between the planets that govern the triplicities and the directions and winds those planets are affiliated with. For example, the 'Aries triplicity' (which includes Aries, Leo and Sagittarius) is chiefly dominated by Jupiter and assisted by Mars. Jupiter rules the north wind and Mars the west wind; therefore this triplicity governs the north-west quarter of Ptolemy's \"inhabited world\": the area known as Europe.\n\nAgain, these divisions are general, and specific rulership of each nation is modified by location and observed cultural distinctions. For example, in Europe, only those regions that lie to the north-west extremes are fully attributed to Jupiter and Mars, since those that lie towards the centre of the inhabited area incline towards the influence of opposing regions. In this way, the \"inhabited region\" experiences a drift of astrological correspondence rather than sharp divisions within its quarters, and independent nations are variously affiliated with the signs of each triplicity and the planets that rule them. Ptolemy names Britain and Spain as two nations appropriately placed in the north-west quarter to accept the rulership of Jupiter and Mars. Such nations are described as \"independent, liberty-loving, fond of arms, industrious\", based on characteristics attributed to those planets. Being predominantly governed by masculine planets they are also \"without passion for women and look down upon the pleasures of love\". Observed characteristics influence his categorisation of Britain as having a closer affinity with Aries and Mars (by which \"for the most part its inhabitants are fiercer, more headstrong and bestial\"), whilst Spain is reported to be more subject to Sagittarius and Jupiter, (from which is evidenced \"their independence, simplicity and love of cleanliness\").\n\nThough Ptolemy describes his analysis as a \"brief exposition\", the chapter builds into an extensive association between planets, zodiac signs and the national characteristics of 73 nations. It concludes with three additional assertions which act as core principles of mundane astrology:\n\nThe remainder of the book shows how this information is used in the prediction of mundane events. Focus is given to eclipses, as the \"first and most potent\" cause of change, supplemented by examination of the 'stations' of the superior planets: Saturn, Jupiter and Mars. Although eclipses are deemed relevant to any nation affiliated with the zodiac signs in which they occur, Ptolemy's scrutiny is reserved for regions where they are visible, which he argues will manifest the effects most noticeably. The period of obscuration determines the endurance of the effect, with each hour proportioning to years for a solar eclipse and months for a lunar eclipse. The location of the eclipse with relation to the horizon is then used to judge whether the effects are most prevalent at the beginning, middle or end of the period, with times of intensification identified by planetary contacts to the degree of the eclipse which occur within this period.\n\nChapter 7 begins the examination of what type of event will manifest. This is judged by the angle of the horizon which precedes the eclipse in the chart set for the location under scrutiny and the planet(s) that dominate this angle by rulership and powerful aspectual connections. Whether the predicted effect is beneficial or destructive depends on the condition of these planets, whilst the type of manifestation is judged by the zodiac signs, fixed stars and constellations involved. The resulting prediction is of relevance to nations, but Ptolemy points out that certain individuals are more resonant to the effects than others; namely those have the Sun or Moon in their horoscopes in the same degree as the eclipse, or the degree that directly opposes it.\n\nWithin his \"Almagest\" Ptolemy explains that he had access to eclipse records kept for 900 years since the beginning of the reign of king Nabonassar (747 BC). In chapter 9 of the \"Tetrabiblos\" he shows knowledge of the Babylonian lore that accompanied these records in detailing the omens based on visual phenomena. The colours of eclipses and \"the formations that occur near them, such as rods, halos, and the like\" are considered along with the astrological significance of comets, in whether they take the form of \"'beams', 'trumpets', 'jars', and the like\". Meaning is derived from their position relative to the Sun and assessment of \"the parts of the zodiac in which their heads appear and through the directions in which the shapes of their tails point\". It is noted that here Ptolemy uses principles that fall outside the neat theoretical logic he presents in book I, being explicable only in terms of the mythological and omen tradition inherited from his ancient sources. He also defends the subjective nature of the analysis involved, asserting that it would be impossible to mention the proper outcome of all this investigation, which calls for enterprise and ingenuity from the astrologer creating the judgement.\n\nThe remaining chapters of book II are dedicated to meteorological matters. Chapter 10 specifies that the new or full Moon preceding the Sun's ingress into Aries can be used as a starting point for investigations concerning the weather patterns of the year. Lunations which precede the Sun's ingress into any the other equinoctial and solstice signs (Cancer, Libra and Capricorn) can also be used for seasonal concerns, and within these \"monthly investigations\" bring more particular details based on lunations and the conjunctions of the planets. The recorded weather effects of the fixed stars in the zodiac constellations are systematically discussed, concluding with the relevance of generally observed sky phenomena such as shooting stars, cloud formations and rainbows. These final considerations are expected to add localised details to the original exploration of eclipse cycles. Ptolemy's theme throughout the book is that charts of this nature cannot be judged in isolation, but are to be understood within the pattern of cycles to which they belong, and where there are strong connections between the degree points involved; for:\n\nWith the astrologer expected to have knowledge and awareness of the mundane cycles that outline the background principles of the personal horoscope, Ptolemy closes this book with the promise that the next will supply \"with due order\" the procedure which allows predictions based on the horoscopes of individuals.\n\nBooks III and IV explore what Ptolemy terms \"the genethlialogical art\": the interpretation of a horoscope set for the moment of the birth of an individual. He explains that there are several cycles of life to consider but the starting point for all investigation is the time of conception or birth. The former \"the genesis of the seed\"” allows knowledge of events that precede the birth; the latter \"the genesis of the man\" is \"more perfect in potentiality\" because when the child leaves the womb and comes \"forth into the light under the appropriate conformation of the heavens\" the temperament, disposition and physical form of the body is set. The two moments are described as being linked by a \"very similar causative power\", so that the seed of the conception takes independent form at an astrologically suitable moment, whereby the impulse to give birth occurs under a \"configuration of similar type to that which governed the child's formation in detail in the first place\". Chapter 2 continues this theme in discussing the importance of calculating the precise degree of the ascendant at birth, the difficulty of recording local time precisely enough to establish this, and the methods available for rectification (\"i.e\"., ensuring the chart is correct).\n\nChapter 3 describes how the analysis of the chart is divided into predictions of:\n\nPtolemy explains the order by which each theme becomes relevant, and follows this in his arrangement of topics presented in the remaining chapters of books III and IV.\n\nFirst he deals with the prenatal matters, covering the astrological significators of the parents in chapter 4, and siblings in chapter 5. Then he deals with the matters \"directly concerned with the birth\", explaining how to judge such issues as whether the child will be male or female (ch.6); whether the birth will produce twins or multiple children (ch.7); and whether it will involve physical defects or monstrous forms; if so, whether these are accompanied by mental deficiency, notability or honour (ch.8). \n\nThe exploration of post-natal concerns begins in chapter 9 with a review of astrological factors that occur when children are not reared. This considers the indications of still births and babies that seem \"half-dead\", or those that have been left exposed (including whether there is possibility they may be taken up and live). Chapter 10 then details the techniques for establishing the length of life under normal circumstances. This is an important and lengthy passage of text, the techniques of which require precise astronomical detail and advanced knowledge of complex progressive techniques. Jim Tester has commented on how Ptolemy goes into an unusual level of detail in a responsibility that Bouché-Leclercq described as \"the chief task of astrology, the operation judged most difficult by practitioners, most dangerous and damnable by its enemies\". Such a prediction involves judicial skill as well as mathematical expertise since several 'destructive' periods may be identified but countered by other, protective astrological influences, resulting in periods of danger or illness that does not lead to death. This is followed, in chapter 11, by the astrological principles from which judgement is made of bodily appearance and temperament. The planetary significations follow the logic of their humoral associations, so that Jupiter (associated with warmth and moisture, an humoral combination which promotes growth) gives largeness in bodily form. Since these define, to some extent, predisposition towards bodily afflictions, there is a natural flow towards the content of chapter 12, which focuses on the astrological significators relating to injuries and diseases. The details of planetary associations with bodily organs and functions are given, such as Saturn ruling the spleen and Jupiter the lungs. Jim Tester has pointed out that several lists of this type exist \"more or less agreeing in detail\".\n\nThe third book concludes with a discussion in chapters 13 and 14 of what is described as a \"largely overlooked\" facet of Ptolemaic doctrine: the \"psychological\" one, which concerns the quality of the soul (or \"psyche\"). Historian Nicholas Campion has discussed the roots of the notion that celestial and psychological realms are connected, which can be traced to the 6th century BC, and in Ptolemy's case presents a mixture of Aristotelian and Stoic philosophy, resting on the Platonic view that \"the soul comes from the heavens\" which explains \"how human character comes to be determined by the heavens\".\n\nThe soul, for Ptolemy, includes the faculty for conscious reasoning, which is rational and attributed to the condition of Mercury, and the subconscious and unconscious elements of the mind (the \"sensory and irrational part\"), which is sensitive and attributed to the condition of the Moon. These two chapters make analysis of instinctual impulses and moral inclinations, being concerned with psychological motives and behavioural expression rather than the physical temperament described in chapter 11. Diseases of the soul are defined as \"affections which are utterly disproportionate and as it were pathological\" including insanity, inability to exercise moderation or restraint, instability of the emotions, depraved sexuality, morbid perversions, and violent afflictions of the intellectual and passive parts of the mind. The astrological explanations are mainly related to the exaggerated influence of destructive planets which are also in difficult configurations with Mercury and the Sun or Moon, or the planet associated with the psychological impulse (for example, Venus in matters of sexuality). Campion has pointed out that these planetary associations with psychological qualities are not original to Ptolemy, being present in the \"Corpus Hermeticum\" which was in circulation in Alexandria at the time Ptolemy compiled his text.\n\nWithin this book Ptolemy has surveyed all the topics that relate to inner qualities, genetic patterns, predispositions and the natural tendencies present from birth. His exploration of individual horoscopes continues into book IV, the only distinction of content being that subsequent topics relate to material matters and life experiences: what Ptolemy refers to as \"external accidentals\".\n\nBook IV is presented with a brief introduction to reaffirm the arrangement of content as previously described. It starts with the topics of riches and honour. Ptolemy says: \"as material fortune is associated with the properties of the body, so honour belongs to those of the soul\". Chapter 2, on material wealth, employs the \"so-called 'Lot of Fortune'\" although Ptolemy's instruction conflicts with that of many of his contemporaries in stating that for its calculation \"we measure from the horoscope the distance from the sun to the moon, in both diurnal and nocturnal nativities\". Ptolemy's reputation ensured this approach to calculation was adopted by many later Medieval and Renaissance astrologers, although it is now realised that most Hellenistic astrologers reversed the formula of calculation for nocturnal births. It is notable that in his discussion \"Of the fortune of Dignity\", in chapter three, Ptolemy makes no reference to the Lot of Spirit (or \"Daimon\"), which would normally be used as the spiritual counterpart to the material wealth and happiness associated with the Lot of Fortune. This is viewed as a demonstration of his general dislike (declared in bk. III.3) for \"lots and numbers of which no reasonable explanation can be given\".\n\nThe subsequent chapter, the title of which is translated by Robbins as 'Of the Quality of Action', concerns professional inclinations and the significators of career advance (or decline). This is followed by the treatment of marriage in chapter 5, which is primarily referred to the Moon in a man's chart, to describe his wife, and the Sun in a woman's chart to describe her husband. Here Ptolemy shows employment of the astrological technique known as synastry, in which the planetary positions of two separate horoscopes are compared with each other for indications of relationship harmony or enmity. \n\nThe next four chapters complete the survey of natal themes, dealing with the topics of children (ch.6); friends and enemies (ch.7); the dangers of foreign travel (ch.8) and the quality (or type) of death (ch.9 – as opposed to the time of death considered in III.10).\n\nThe final chapter of the work is described as \"a curious one\" for introducing a separate theme at the end of the book. This refers to the seven 'ages of man', which Ptolemy briefly mentioned in III.1 as a matter which varies the emphasis of astrological configurations according to the time in life they occur: \"we predict events that will come about at specific times and vary in degree, following the so called ages of life.\nHis argument is that, just as an astrologer must consider cultural differences \"lest he mistake the appropriate customs and manners by assigning, for example, marriage with a sister to one who is Italian by race, instead of to the Egyptian as he should\", it is necessary to consider the age in life that important astrological events occur. This is to ensure the prediction will \"harmonise those details which are contemplated in temporal terms with that which is suitable and possible for persons in the various age-classes\" and avoid out-of-context predictions such as imminent marriage for a young child, or \"to an extremely old man the begetting of children or anything else that fits younger men\". This leads into a discussion of the planetary themes of the seven ages of life which:\n\nThe information in the passage can be summarised as follows:\n\nThe book ends with a brief discussion of astronomical and symbolic cycles used in the prediction of timed events, which includes mention of (primary) directions, annual profections, ingresses, lunations and transits.\n\nThe translator of the Loeb 1940 English translation, F. E. Robbins, reports a \"puzzling problem\" regarding the final paragraph of the book. One group of manuscripts have either been left unconcluded or supplied with text that matches an \"Anonymous Paraphrase\" of the work (speculatively attributed to Proclus); the other presents text which is the same in general content, but longer, according with manuscripts that were transmitted through Arabic translations. Robbins considers it certain that the ending which concurs with the text of the \"Paraphrase\" is spurious. Robert Schmidt, the English translator of the later Project Hindsight edition agrees with his choice, stating that the text of the latter \"sounds more generally Ptolemaic\".\n\nRobbins explains that the lack of an ending usually occurs when ancient books are compiled in the form of a codex rather than a roll. Since the \"Paraphrase\" edition of the \"Tetrabiblos\" aimed to present the work's meaning without Ptolemy's own complicated style of text construction, Robbins says that he \"cannot conceive how anyone (except perhaps Ptolemy) could have reversed the process and evolved the tortuous, crabbed Greek of the latter from the comparatively simple language of the former\". He therefore offers both versions of the ending whilst lending his support to that which is found in the Arabic version of the text. This has the book conclude with Ptolemy declaring \"since the topic of nativities has been summarily reviewed, it would be well to bring this procedure also to a fitting close\".\n\nDespite Ptolomy's prominence as a philosopher, the Dutch historian of science Eduard Jan Dijksterhuis criticizes the \"Tetrabiblos\", stating that \"it only remain puzzling that the very writer of the \"Almagest\", who had taught how to develop astronomy from accurate observations and mathematical constructions, could put together such a system of superficial analogies and unfounded assertions.\"\n\nNo original manuscripts of the text have survived; its contents are known from translations, fragments, paraphrased copies, commentaries and later Greek manuscripts. Astrological researcher Deborah Houlding, in an analysis of how specific points agree or vary between different editions, suggests that areas of conflicting details have been affected by three main streams of transmission: manuscripts that have passed through Arabic translation; those based on a paraphrased edition, and manuscripts that are dated four centuries later than the Arabic ones, but which have not undergone translation out of Greek.\n\nThe oldest extant manuscript is an Arabic translation compiled in the 9th century by Hunayn ibn Ishaq. This was first translated into Latin, in Barcelona, by Plato de Tivoli in 1138 and became influential as the first complete introduction of Ptolemy's astrological work in Medieval Europe. It survives in at least nine manuscripts and five Renaissance printings.\n\nOther Latin translations made from Arabic sources include an anonymous (unpublished) work compiled in 1206 and another of the 13th century by Egidio Tebaldi (Aegidius de Thebaldis). Typically, the Latin translations made from Arabic texts were circulated with a commentary compiled by Ali ibn Ridwan (Haly) in the 11th century.\n\nEgidio Tebaldi's translation was first published by Erhard Ratdolt in 1484 together with Haly's commentary and a \"pseudo-Ptolemaic\" list of aphorisms known as the \"Centiloquium\". This has been described as \"the creature of late-fifteenth-century Italian presses\".\n\nAn anonymous Greek paraphrase is speculatively attributed to the 5th-century philosopher Proclus. It is often referred to as the \"Proclus' Paraphrase\" although its authenticity is questioned, being described as \"very doubtful\" by Professor Stephan Heilen. The content of the \"Paraphrase\" is close to that of manuscripts of the \"Tetrabiblos\", but it uses simplified text with the aim of providing what Heilen calls \"a more easily understandable version of the difficult original work\".\n\nThere is no modern critical edition of this text. The oldest extant manuscript is dated to the 10th century and housed in the Vatican Library (Ms. \"Vaticanus gr.1453, S. X.\", ff.1–219). Some of the text of the \"Paraphrase\" was published with a Latin translation and Preface by Philipp Melanchthon in Basel, 1554, but this was not widely circulated. A full reproduction with an accompanying Latin translation was made around 1630 by the Vatican scholar Leo Allatius \"for his own private gratification\" and this was published by the Elzevir typsetters in Leiden, 1635, apparently without Allatius's knowledge or consent.\n\nAllatius' Latin translation was used as the source of all English translations of the \"Tetrabiblos\" prior to the Robbins' edition of 1940. These include translations made by John Whalley (1701); the Whalley \"corrected edition\" made by Ebenezer Sibly and his brother (1786); J.M. Ashmand (1822); James Wilson (1828); and other 19th-century privately circulated manuscripts such as that of John Worsdale.\n\nAlthough no copies of Ptolemy's original manuscript remain, there are other ancient works, such as Hephaistio's \"Apotelesmatics I\", which describe or reproduce some of its passages. These have been used to help verify disputed areas of content.\n\nThe oldest fairly complete Greek manuscript of the text (rather than the paraphrased edition made of it) is dated to the 13th century. Two or three others are dated to the 14th century but most are dated to the 15th and 16th centuries. In the 'Introduction' to his 1940's translation, Frank Eggleston Robbins reported the existence of at least 35 manuscripts containing all or a large part of the \"Tetrabiblos\" in European libraries.\n\nThe first printed edition was made in 1535 with an accompanying Latin translation by the German classical scholar Joachim Camerarius. This was reprinted in 1553 and is \"notable for offering the first Latin translation based upon a Greek rather than Arabic source\". Robbins noted the page numbers of the 1553 edition in the Greek text which faces his English translation, stating \"My collations have been made against Camerarius' second edition, because thus far this has been the standard text and it was most convenient\".\n\nAlso in 1940, a Greek critical edition was published by Teubner, in Germany, based on the unpublished work of Franz Boll which was completed by his student Emilie Boer. Robbins expressed regret at not being able to refer to this in the preparation of his English translation.\n\nIn 1994 the 'Boll-Boer' edition became the basis of a serialised English translation by Robert Schmidt, published by Project Hindsight. The 'Translator's Preface' was critical of Robbins' understanding of some of the \"conceptual issues involved\" and argued the need for a new English translation which recognised the \"probable superiority of the Teubner text edited by Boll and Boer in 1940\".\n\nThe most recent critical edition of the Greek text was made by the German scholar Professor Wolfgang Hübner, and published by Teubner in 1998. Based on 33 complete and 14 partial manuscripts, Hübner also incorporated the unpublished notes of Boer and the reasoning given in the Robbins and Boll-Boer editions. This is now considered the authoritative edition. A reviewer's comment in The \"Classical Review\" declares of it \"Progress over previous editions is evident on virtually every page\".\n\nIn addition to the Arabic commentary on the \"Tetrabiblos\" made by Ali ibn Ridwan (Haly) in the 11th century,\nsignificant attention is given to an anonymous Greek \"Commentary\", which has older, obscure origins. It was written at an uncertain date, in either late antiquity or the Byzantine period. This is also attributed to Proclus, as the presumed author of the \"Paraphrase\", although Heilen has remarked that such an attribution \"looks like guesswork\". Houlding has also pointed out that differences in tabulated information presented within the \"Paraphrase\" and the \"Commentary\" \"is a telling argument that both cannot be the work of the same author\".\n\nThe Greek \"Commentary\" was first printed in 1559 with an accompanying Latin translation by Hieronymus Wolf. This claimed to be based on a heavily corrupted manuscript which required numerous conjectures by a scholarly friend of Wolf, who preferred to remain anonymous rather than face reproaches for \"dabbling in this sort of literature\". Wolf's edition was bound with an \"Introduction to the Tetrabiblos\", attributed (speculatively) to Porphyry, and the scholia of Demophilus.\n\nThe purpose of the \"Commentary\" was to offer demonstrated illustrations and fuller explanation of the astrological principles described by Ptolemy. Following Wolf's edition, large passages were incorporated into Latin astrological works which featured extensive collections of example horoscopes. Two notable examples are Jerome Cardan's \"Ptolemaei De Astrorvm Ivdiciis\" (Basel, 1578) and Francisco Junctinus's \"Speculum Astrologiae\" (Lugduni, 1583). Modern translators continue to make reference to the Hieronymous Wolf \"Commentary\" in their explanatory annotations.\n\nThe \"Centiloquium\" 'one hundred (sayings)' was the common Latin title of a collection of 100 important astrological aphorisms. It was also known in Latin as \"Liber Fructus\" (Arabic: \"Kitab al-Tamara\"; Hebrew: \"Sefer ha-Peri\") 'Book of the Fruit'. The latter reflected the belief that this offered a summation of Ptolemy's key astrological principles, and therefore presented \"The Fruit of his Four Books\". It began, as all Ptolemy's works did, with a dedication to \"Syrus\", which helped support the assumption of the work's Ptolemaic authenticity.\n\nEarly manuscripts were commonly accompanied by a commentary on their use authored by Ahmad ibn Yusuf al-Misri (835–912). This became translated into Latin at the same time as translations were being made of the Arabic editions of the \"Tetrabiblos\". The earliest translations were made by Johannes Hispanensis in 1136 and Plato of Tivoli in 1138.\n\nAli ibn Ridwan (Haly), who had produced the Arabic commentary on Ptolemy's work, noticed that the aphorisms highlighted principles of interrogational astrology, and wondered why Ptolemy had not included coverage of these themes in his \"Tetrabiblos\". Jerome Cardan was the first to declare the work a forgery based on such differences, referring in his commentary on the \"Tetrabiblos\" to an argument of Galen: \"In the old days, kings who were trying to establish great libraries bought the books of famous men at very high prices. By doing so they caused men to ascribe their own works to the ancients\".\n\nThe authorship of the text is now ascribed to \"Pseudo-Ptolemy\". Some scholars suggest that Ahmad ibn Yusuf was its true author. Others believe that the \"Centiloquium\", though not Ptolemy's, may preserve some collation of authentic materials from Hellenistic astrology. Ultimately, the historical assumption that the \"Centiloquium\" was part of Ptolemy's astrological legacy gave it widespread influence in the medieval period, by which it became established as an important text within the astrological tradition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1853102", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1853102", "title": "The Man Who Sold the World", "text": "The Man Who Sold the World\n\n\"The Man Who Sold the World\" is a song written by English singer-songwriter David Bowie. The title track of Bowie's third studio album of the same name, it was released in November 1970 in the US and in April 1971 in the UK by Mercury Records. Produced by Tony Visconti, it was recorded at Trident and Advision Studios in London in May 1970, towards the end of the album's sessions; Bowie recorded his vocal on the final day of mixing for the album, reflecting his generally dismissive attitude during the sessions. Musically, it is based around a \"circular\" guitar riff from Mick Ronson. Its lyrics are cryptic and evocative, being inspired by numerous poems including \"The Psychoed\" by William Hughes Mearns. Bowie's vocals are heavily \"phased\" throughout and have been described as \"haunting\".\n\n\"The Man Who Sold the World\" went relatively unnoticed upon initial release in 1970. It was never released as a single but appeared as a B-side on the 1973 reissues of \"Space Oddity\" in the US and \"Life on Mars?\" in the UK by RCA Records. It wasn't until it was covered by Scottish singer Lulu, whose 1974 recording, produced by Bowie and Ronson, peaked at No. 3 on the UK Singles Chart and brought the song mainstream attention. In subsequent decades, the song has been covered by Scottish musician Midge Ure in 1982 and the American rock band Nirvana in 1993, whose performance of the song for the television programme \"MTV Unplugged\" introduced it to a new audience. Many critics have noted that cover versions of the track have managed to outshine Bowie's original recording in popularity, with some, including Bowie himself, also noting that many listeners don't know Bowie wrote it. Others have commended these covers as saving the song from obscurity.\n\nRetrospectively, Bowie's original recording has been named one of his best songs, with many praising the haunting and unsettling nature of the recording. Bowie performed the track live later in his career in different renditions than the original, including in a darker style during 1995's Outside Tour; a studio recording of the tour's arrangement appeared as a B-side in 1995. He again re-recorded the song in an acoustic arrangement in 1996 for the documentary \"ChangesNowBowie\", which was released in 2020 on the EP \"Is It Any Wonder?\". The original recording has since appeared on multiple compilation albums and has been remastered multiple times, including in 2015 as part of the box set \"Five Years (1969–1973)\".\n\nThe backing track for \"The Man Who Sold the World\" was recorded at Trident Studios in London on 4 May 1970, along with other album track \"Running Gun Blues\". At this point, the track was recorded under the working title \"Saviour Machine\" and did not contain the title phrase. According to Kevin Cann, the lineup featured Bowie on acoustic guitar, Mick Ronson on electric guitar, producer Tony Visconti on bass, Woody Woodmansey on drums and percussion, and Ralph Mace on Moog synthesiser; Ronson and Woodmansey would later become famous as a part of the Spiders from Mars. According to Visconti, Bowie recorded his vocal on 22 May at Advision Studios, the final day of mixing for the album which, when traveling to Advision, Bowie had intended to name \"Metrobolist\", a homage to Fritz Lang's 1927 film \"Metropolis\". O'Leary writes that Bowie wrote the lyrics in the reception area of the studio while Visconti waited at the mixing console. Once he finished, he quickly recorded his vocal, Visconti added a \"flange\" effect and mixed the track in a few hours, sending the tapes to the label later that night. Bowie's last-minute addition frustrated Visconti, who recalled in 1977: \"This was the beginning of [Bowie's] new style of writing – 'I can't be bothered until I have to'. When it was finished, on the last day of the last mix, I remember telling David, 'I've had it, I can't work like this anymore – I'm through...David was very disappointed.\" This frustration was mostly due in part to his dissatisfaction with the recording sessions: he was mostly in charge of budget and production, as well as maintaining Bowie's interest in the project. Bowie later told BBC Radio 1's Stuart Grundy in 1976: \"It was a nightmare, that album. I hated the actual process of making it.\"\n\nBowie's original recording is described by author Peter Doggett as \"enigmatic\", while Nicholas Pegg describes it as giving an \"unassuming air of pathos and menace\". Doggett notes that the track contains none of the \"metallic theatrics\" that are found on the rest of the album. Musically, the song opens with a repeating electric guitar riff from Ronson with an acoustic guitar from Bowie underneath it. O'Leary writes that apart from Ronson's electric guitar, the song is primarily acoustic. The chord structure is in the key of F with an A major chord \"borrowed\" from the D minor scale, similar to fellow album track \"All the Madmen\". Throughout the song, Visconti's bass \"runs scales\" under the chorus and a melody \"elsewhere\", Woodmansey plays \"ecstatic\" drum fills deep in the mix and Latin-style percussion \"trembling\" on the surface; Ronson uses feedback to introduce the chorus. Bowie's vocals are \"heavily phased\" during the verses and briefly doubled (which, in Bowie's words, \"came as some surprise\"), compressed and again double-tracked during the chorus. Douglas Wolk of \"Rolling Stone\" similarly calls Bowie's vocals and lyrics \"haunting\". Pegg describes the guiro percussion as \"sinister\", the guitar riff \"circular\" and Bowie's vocal \"ghostly\". The tracks ends with a coda, described by Doggett as a \"haunting chorale\" and by O'Leary as \"ominous\"; it contains wordless vocals and is primarily in D minor.\n\nAccording to Doggett, the song's title has multiple \"precursors\": including a 1949 Robert A. Heinlein science fiction poem \"The Man Who Sold the Moon\"; a 1954 DC comic, \"The Man Who Sold the Earth\"; a 1968 Brazilian political satire, \"The Man Who Bought the World\". However, none have a thematic link to Bowie's song. Pegg suggests that the title partly reflects an element of \"self-disgust\" Bowie has over the thought of \"losing control\" and \"selling\" his private life via profoundly personal music.\n\nThe lyrics are noted as very cryptic and evocative; in Doggett's words, \"begging but defying interpretation.\" Like most of his work during this period, Bowie frequently avoided giving a direct interpretation of the lyrics; he later remarked that he felt it was unfair to give it to Lulu in 1973 because it dealt with the \"devils and angels\" within himself (she later confessed she \"had no idea what it meant\"). Bowie once stated that the song was a sequel to \"Space Oddity\" which, in Doggett's words, is \"an explanation designed to distract rather than enlighten\", quoting the lyrics \"Who knows? Not me\". The song's narrator has an encounter with a kind of doppelgänger, as suggested in the second chorus where \"I never lost control\" is replaced with \"We never lost control\". Beyond this, the episode is unexplained: as James E. Perone wrote,\n\nIn common with a number of tracks on the album, the song's themes have been compared to the horror-fantasy works of H. P. Lovecraft. The lyrics are also cited as reflecting Bowie's concerns with family problems and splintered or multiple personalities and are believed to have been partially inspired by the poem \"The Psychoed\" by William Hughes Mearns: \"As I was going up the stair / I met a man who wasn't there / He wasn't there again today / I wish, I wish he'd stay away...\" By claiming he \"wasn't there\", Bowie \"compounds\" the identity crisis while believing his companion \"died alone, a long, long time ago.\" Pegg writes that the \"defacement of the individual\" and \"dread of mortality\" provide \"grim counterparts\" to the \"immortal anguish\" of fellow album track \"The Supermen\" and the meditations on \"impermanence\" and \"rebirth\" in \"After All\".\n\n\"The Man Who Sold the World\" was released as the eighth and penultimate track on Bowie's third studio album of the same name in November 1970 in the US and in April 1971 in the UK by Mercury Records. Although no singles were issued from the album, the song appeared as the B-side on the 1973 reissue US single release of \"Space Oddity\" and UK single release of \"Life on Mars?\", both by RCA Records.\n\nRetrospectively, Bowie's original recording has been named one of his best songs, with many praising the haunting and unsettling nature of the recording. Following Bowie's death in 2016, \"Rolling Stone\" listed the song as one of his 30 essential songs. The same year, \"Ultimate Classic Rock\", in their list of Bowie's ten best songs, listed \"The Man Who Sold the World\" at number 10, calling it \"one of his most haunting songs of all time\". They subsequently commended Lulu and Nirvana's cover versions for helping bring the song into the mainstream. In 2018, \"NME\", in their list of Bowie's 40 greatest songs, ranked \"The Man Who Sold the World\" number 17, writing, \"[The track] is not just a vintage slice of Bowie story-telling but a key part in his '90s renaissance, 20 years later\", due in part to Nirvana's cover, which appeared at a time when \"Bowie's critical stock was at a career-low... coming after Bowie's late-'80s run of maligned albums.\" In 2020, Alexis Petridis of \"The Guardian\" ranked the song 23rd in her list of Bowie's 50 greatest songs, writing, \"The title track of his eeriest album remains mysterious, creepy and haunting 50 years on.\"\n\nBowie's original recording of \"The Man Who Sold the World\" has been released on multiple compilation albums, including \"The Best of David Bowie 1969/1974\" (1997), \"Best of Bowie\" (2002), \"Nothing Has Changed\" (2014) and \"Legacy\" (2016). The song, along with its parent album, has been remastered multiple times, including in 2015 as part of the box set \"Five Years (1969–1973)\". Bowie has performed the song on numerous occasions. He recorded the song for the American television programme \"Saturday Night Live\" in December 1979, with Klaus Nomi and Joey Arias. Pegg calls this version \"superb\". He performed the song during his summer 2000 tour, including at the BBC Radio Theatre in London and at the Glastonbury Festival. Performances from these venues have been released on \"Bowie at the Beeb\" (2000) and \"Glastonbury 2000\" (2018), respectively. A performance from the Reality Tour is featured on the live album \"A Reality Tour\" (2010). \nThe song has been covered by hundreds of artists, which many critics have noted has saved the song from falling into obscurity. Many have also noted that certain covers have managed to outshine the popularity of Bowie's original recording. The most popular covers include Scottish singer Lulu, whose version produced a UK top ten hit in 1973 and was produced by Bowie and Ronson, Scottish musician Midge Ure in 1982, whose cover of the song was featured in the 2015 video game \"\", and the American rock band Nirvana, whose 1993 performance of the song for the television program \"MTV Unplugged\" introduced it to a new audience. Speaking about Lulu's recording, Bowie recalled in 2002, \"I still have a very soft spot for [Lulu's] version, though to have the same song covered by both Lulu and Nirvana still bemuses me to this day.\" AllMusic's Dave Thompson argues that the Lulu, Midge Ure and Nirvana recordings have managed to \"establish the song at the very forefront of Bowie's canon.\" Pegg writes that the popularity of its covers have made listeners unaware that the song was written by Bowie. However, Alexis Petridis of \"The Guardian\" argues that although subsequent covers have tended to outshine Bowie's original in terms of popularity, none have ever matched the quality of the original.\n\nBowie re-recorded \"The Man Who Sold the World\" on multiple occasions. For performances on the Outside Tour, it was performed in what Pegg calls a \"radical trip-hop revamp\"; a studio recording of the song was recorded by Bowie and mixed by Brian Eno and appears as the B-side of the CD single \"Strangers When We Meet\" (1995). Following mixing in late October 1995, Eno wrote in his diary, \"It sounds completely contemporary. I added some backing vocals and a sonar blip and sculpted the piece a little so that there was more contour to it.\" In 2020, on what would have been Bowie's 73rd birthday, a previously unreleased acoustic version, recorded for the \"ChangesNowBowie\" documentary in 1996 during the \"Earthling\" sessions, was released. According to Jon Blistein of \"Rolling Stone\", this version has \"a lighter touch, with that famous serpentine guitar riff slinking around a steady acoustic strum and slowly swelling synths.\" It features Gail Ann Dorsey on bass and vocals, Reeves Gabrels (whom Bowie collaborated with in the band Tin Machine) on guitar, and Mark Plati on keyboards and programming. It was released on the EP \"Is It Any Wonder?\", which contained other songs Bowie re-recorded for the \"ChangesNowBowie\" documentary. Stephen Thomas Erlewine, writing for \"Pitchfork\", described the re-recording as \"a nod to Nirvana popularising the song a few years earlier\".\n\nAccording to Kevin Cann:\n\nThe song was covered by the Scottish singer Lulu in 1974, who, according to biographer David Buckley, performed it in \"a sleazy, almost Berlin cabaret style\". O'Leary categorises her rendition as \"glam-disco\" and calls it \"loud, captivating and distorting.\" Lulu would recall Bowie inviting her to a concert he gave after which he met her in his hotel room saying: \"I want to make an MF of a record with you [because] you're a great singer.\" Lulu – \"I didn't think it would happen but [Bowie] followed up two days later. He was übercool at the time and I just wanted to be led by him. I loved everything he did. I didn't think 'The Man Who Sold the World' was the greatest song for my voice, but it was such a strong song in itself. I had no idea what it was about. In the studio Bowie kept telling me to smoke more cigarettes, to give my voice a certain quality.\" Regarding meeting her in the \"Last Supper\" at the Hotel Café Royal, Bowie later said, \"We started talking about the possibility of working together. I was keen to get something fixed up, because I really have always thought that Lulu has incredible potential as a rock singer. I didn't think this potential had been fully realised...we decided on 'The Man Who Sold The World' as being most suitable.\" Bowie produced Lulu's recording of \"The Man Who Sold the World\" with Mick Ronson during the July 1973 \"Pin Ups\" sessions at the Château d'Hérouville in Hérouville, France and also contributed guitar, saxophone and backing vocals. The remainder of the band included Ronson on guitar, Trevor Bolder on bass, Mike Garson on piano, and Aynsley Dunbar on drums. Bowie added saxophone overdubs and oversaw the final mix at Olympic Studios in London during the \"Diamond Dogs\" sessions. According to O'Leary, Bowie had Lulu smoke cigarettes in between takes in order to \"abrade\" her voice.\n\nLulu's version of \"The Man Who Sold the World\" was released as a single on 11 January 1974 by Polydor Records (as 2001 490), with a cover Bowie's \"Aladdin Sane\" track \"Watch That Man\" as the B-side. She promoted her version with an appearance on the British television programme \"Top of the Pops\" on 10 January, in which she performed in a charcoal suit and gangster hat. According to Pegg, this outfit bore a \"remarkable resemblance\" to the wardrobe of Bowie's future persona the Thin White Duke. Neil Bartlett characterised her performances as \"dressed and sounding exactly like a diminutive Bowie\". Her performances helped the single peak at No. 3 on the UK Singles Chart, as well as No. 8 on the Irish Singles Chart, and No. 24 and 10 on the Belgian and Netherlands Singles Charts, respectively. O'Leary writes that the single charted higher than almost all of Bowie's 1970s singles and made his original recording \"seem like a demo\". Jack Whatley of \"Far Out\" magazine writes that while Nirvana's cover is \"the stuff of legend\", it is Lulu's version of the song that \"has us spellbound from its first sleazy moments.\" He argues that she has the \"perfect voice\" for the track and calls the video a \"seventies dream.\" He further calls her first \"Top of the Pops\" performance \"stunning, arresting, and a silky smooth affair, filled with enough sleaze to make your weekend feel naughty it remains the best version of Bowie’s iconic song.\"\n\nAll songs written by David Bowie.\n\n\nAccording to Roy Carr and Charles Shaar Murray:\n\nIn his journals, Kurt Cobain of the American grunge band Nirvana ranked the album \"The Man Who Sold the World\" at number 45 in his top 50 favourite albums. Cobain and bassist Krist Novoselic were introduced to \"The Man Who Sold the World\" by one of their drummers Chad Channing, who bought a used LP version and converted it to cassette. Cobain found great interest in the title track and was surprised to learn it was by Bowie. Nirvana subsequently recorded a live rendition of the song during their \"MTV Unplugged\" appearance at Sony Music Studios in New York City on 18 November 1993 and included it on their \"MTV Unplugged in New York\" album the following year. The song was also released as a promotional single for the album in 1995. O'Leary notes that rather than play acoustic versions of their more popular songs, such as \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\", the band instead opted for relatively obscure cover versions, including \"The Man Who Sold the World\", which at the time, was considered a Bowie outtake by MTV standards. For their performance, Cobain ran his acoustic guitar through a fuzz box that he could trigger with a pedal, allowing the guitar to sound electric. Nirvana's cover received considerable airplay on alternative rock radio stations and was also placed into heavy rotation on MTV, peaking at number 3 on MTV's most played videos on 18 February 1995; it also peaked for two weeks at number 7 on Canada's \"MuchMusic Countdown\" in March 1995. Nirvana regularly covered the song during live sets after their \"MTV Unplugged\" performance up until Cobain's death in 1994. Following Cobain's death, O'Leary states that the group's performance of \"The Man Who Sold the World\" became Cobain's \"ghost song\". In 2002, the song was re-released on Nirvana's self-titled \"best of\" compilation. Douglas Wolk of \"Pitchfork\" argues that the song \"didn't really become a standard\" until Nirvana covered it.\n\nBrian Kay of \"Classic Rock History\" called their performance of the song \"haunting\" and \"mesmerising\". He writes, \"Cobain's haunting vocals overtook and descended the Bowie lyric into an arena of darkness and hallucination that seemed to be Bowie's original intent. [The presence of the Meat Puppets' Cris and Curt Kirkwood], along with Cobain's lyrical phrasing and gritty yet humbling resonance, left the audience spellbound.\" Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic, in his review of \"MTV Unplugged in New York\", wrote: \"No other band could have offered covers of David Bowie's \"The Man Who Sold the World\" and the folk standard \"Where Did You Sleep Last Night\" on the same record, turning in chilling performances of both – performances that reveal as much as their original songs.\"\n\nBowie said of Nirvana's cover: \"I was simply blown away when I found that Kurt Cobain liked my work, and have always wanted to talk to him about his reasons for covering 'The Man Who Sold the World and that \"it was a good straight forward rendition and sounded somehow very honest. It would have been nice to have worked with him, but just talking with him would have been real cool.\" Bowie called Nirvana's cover \"heartfelt\", noting that \"until this [cover], it hadn't occurred to me that I was part of America's musical landscape. I always felt my weight in Europe, but not [in the US].\" In the wake of its release, Bowie bemoaned the fact that when he performed the number himself, he would encounter \"kids that come up afterwards and say, 'It's cool you're doing a Nirvana song.' And I think, 'Fuck you, you little tosser! \"Rolling Stone\" added: \"If the mark of a good cover is that people do not even realise it's a cover, Nirvana certainly did a good job\" and that \"The song also took on new meaning after Cobain died. This was a man with the world at his finger tips, and he gave it all up\". The magazine ranked Nirvana's version number one in a reader's poll of the greatest live cover songs.\n\nAt a pre–Grammy Awards party on 14 February 2016, surviving Nirvana band members Krist Novoselic, Dave Grohl, and Pat Smear teamed up with contemporary Beck to perform \"The Man Who Sold the World\" in tribute to Bowie–who had died the month before—with Beck performing vocals. To mark what would have been Kurt Cobain's 50th birthday, in 2017 the Phonographic Performance Limited released a list of the twenty most-played Nirvana songs on TV and radio in the UK; \"The Man Who Sold the World\" ranked at number six.\n\nIn 2013, an electric guitar version appeared on Nirvana's \"Live and Loud\" video album, which was also released digitally and on vinyl in 2019. Later the same year, a rehearsal performance for their \"MTV Unplugged\" set was released on the 25th anniversary digital and vinyl editions of the album, and had only previously been available on the DVD version that was released in 2007. On 4 January 2020, the surviving members of Nirvana again teamed up with Beck on vocals and St. Vincent on guitar to perform the song at a charity event for The Art of Elysium's annual Heaven gala.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Dick, first published in November 1954 in \"Beyond Fantasy Fiction\".\n\nBy offering up the blood of a lamb, Silvia, the protagonist of \"Upon the Dull Earth\", is able to summon creatures she identifies as angels. She thinks that the creatures are her ancestors, and she is sure that one day she will join them. At the same time, though, it is not clear whether the creatures are really good, as Silvia thinks, or wicked. Their behavior and their relation with Silvia scare the girl's relatives and Rick, her boyfriend. Rick thinks that Silvia's behavior is very dangerous, as \"the white-winged giants ... can sear [her] to ash\". During a quarrel with Rick, the girl accidentally cuts herself. Independently from her will, Silvia's blood summons the creatures. Unable to control their power, the angel-like giants burn Silvia's body and leave only \"a brittle burned-out husk\".\n\nUnable to accept his lover's death, Rick tries to bring Silvia back, but in doing so he causes the degeneration and destruction of the world he lives in. The story also develops one of Dick's favorite themes, namely the definition of what is real. The reality we think we know well turns out to be insubstantial, due to Dick's use of multiple possible realities which ends up deconstructing the idea of reality itself. As the short story investigates these questions, first at an epistemological level and then at an ontological one, \"Upon the Dull Earth\" unfolds like a conventional horror plot. Rick manages to contact the light-creatures who apparently belong to a higher realm of being and he also manages to speak with Silvia. The girl now lives in the realm of the angel-like creatures, but she wants to come back and she explains that they made a mistake when they took her away. The creatures think that bringing Silvia back could be dangerous. Besides, Silvia explains that in order to come back she needs \"some shape to enter\" because there are no \"material forms\" in the higher continuum. She would have to take something from the human world, \"something of clay\".\n\nAt the end of the story, Silvia manages to come back, but the effects of her return are disastrous. As soon as she appears in front of Rick, Silvia realizes that something has gone wrong and that she has taken the place of someone else. In fact, she has taken her sister's body. There is a scene in which Rick sees Betty Lou (Silvia's sister) change and become Silvia, but it is just the beginning of the nightmare atmosphere which engulfs the story's ending. In fact, the process of transformation is not over. Slowly, every member of Silvia's family becomes Silvia. Rick runs away in a fright, but his body is destined to be invaded by Silvia, too. The girl has assumed the role of a revenant who invades the body and mind of any living person and spreads like a virus, a curse, leaving no hope for redemption. At the end of the story, after a useless flight, after he has seen service-station attendants, waitresses and common people change into Silvia before his very eyes, Rick looks at himself in a mirror and sees his face slowly becoming Silvia's. Suddenly, the man is gone and only Silvia remains. The girl finds herself alone and does not understand what has happened.\n\"Upon the Dull Earth\" was adapted into an audio drama, \"Silvia's Blood\", by The Truth.\n\n\n<br>\n"}

However, they were excluded from negotiations by the victorious English Parliament and by 1647, they despaired of achieving their political goals - the establishment of Presbyterianism in the Three Kingdoms and asserting the civil authority of the Scots Parliament and the General Assembly of the Scottish Kirk (Presbyterian Church). They even suspected that the Parliamentarians would annex Scotland and impose their own \"Independent\" religious settlement. For this reason, one faction of the Covenanters, the Engagers, signed a secret deal with Charles I called the \"Engagement\". However, they were defeated in an attempted invasion of England and even came to blows with fellow Covenanters who wanted a more forthright deal with the King.\n\nWhen Charles I was executed in 1649, the radical Covenanters, or \"Kirk Party\", moved to do a new deal with Charles II, the son of the dead King, who was in exile in Breda. The treaty basically granted everything the Kirk Party wanted. Charles II undertook to establish Presbyterianism as the national religion and to recognise the authority of the Kirk's General Assembly in civil law in England as it already was in Scotland. Charles also took the Solemn League and Covenant oath of 1643.\n\nCharles was crowned King of Scots in Scone in January 1651, but by then the terms agreed at Breda were already a dead letter. The army associated with the Kirk Party under David Leslie was destroyed by Oliver Cromwell at the Battle of Dunbar in September 1650 and the English Parliamentarian New Model Army had taken Edinburgh and much of Lowland Scotland. Even a subsequent rapprochement between moderate and radical Covenanters and their former enemies, the Scottish Royalists, was not enough to restore Charles' throne. He fled the country for France after his defeat at the battle of Worcester in September 1651.\n\nUnder the Commonwealth of England, Scotland was annexed, its legislative institutions abolished and Presbyterianism dis-established. There was freedom of religion under the Commonwealth, except for Roman Catholics, but the edicts of the Kirk's assemblies were no longer enforced by law, as previously.\n\nAfter being restored to his throne in 1660 King Charles completely reneged on the Treaty of Breda, seeking to restore an Episcopalian church structure in Scotland.\n\n"}
{"id": "1853139", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1853139", "title": "Flandrian interglacial", "text": "Flandrian interglacial\n\nThe Flandrian interglacial or stage is the name given by geologists and archaeologists in the British Isles to the first, and so far only, stage of the Holocene epoch (the present geological period), covering the period from around 12,000 years ago, at the end of the last glacial period to the present day. As such, it is in practice identical in span to the Holocene. \n\nThe Flandrian began as the relatively short-lived Younger Dryas climate downturn came to an end. This formed the last gasp of the Devensian glaciation, the final stage of the Pleistocene epoch. The Flandrian is traditionally seen as the latest warm interglacial in a series that has been occurring throughout the Quaternary geological period. \n\nThe first part of the Flandrian, known as the Younger Atlantic, was a period of fairly rapid sea level rise, known as the Flandrian transgression. It is associated with the melting of the Fenno-Scandian, Scottish, Laurentide and Cordilleran glaciers. Fjords were formed during the Flandrian transgression when U-shaped glaciated valleys were inundated.\n\nMilankovitch theory alone would forecast that the present Flandrian climate, like that of other interstadials, should eventually decline in temperature, towards a global climate similar to that of the Last Glacial Maximum. Less orbital eccentricity might have the effect of moderating this temperature downturn. However, orbital cycles are not the only influence on global temperature; atmospheric greenhouse gasses also affect the radiative forcing. While there is agreement that post-industrial-revolution greenhouse-gas emissions are substantially warming the planet, there is debate over whether early agriculture, beginning thousands of years earlier, has had a much smaller warming effect (due to methane emissions from rice paddies, or deforestation, for instance). If this is the case, the climate of at least the later Holocene has long deviated from what would be expected with only orbital forcings, and the Flandrian has long been an atypical interglacial.\n\n"}
{"id": "1853140", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1853140", "title": "Brent Albright", "text": "Brent Albright\n\nBrent Albright (born November 28, 1978) is an American retired professional wrestler, perhaps best known for his time with World Wrestling Entertainment, during which he appeared on \"SmackDown!\" as Gunner Scott. Aside from WWE, Albright is a one-time NWA World Heavyweight Champion, having won the title while performing for Ring of Honor.\n\nAlbright made his professional wrestling debut for All Pro Wrestling (APW) on October 10, 1998, as Vinnie Valentino, in a losing effort against Vinny Massaro. He would gain his first win came in his second match in January 1999 when he, Chris Ward, and Tony Jones defeated Jason C. Clay, Nathaniel Sweete, and Rick Turner. Albright continued to wrestler for APW throughout his early years.\n\nAlbright wrestled three times for the World Wrestling Federation in 2001 and 2002, where he lost to cruiserweights such as Essa Rios. Later in 2003, he wrestled under the name Slater Vain for some of WWE's (formerly WWF) tertiary shows.\n\nAlbright signed a development contract in early 2004 and was sent to Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW). During his time with OVW, Albright was both OVW Heavyweight Champion and OVW Television Champion, as well as co-holder of the OVW Southern Tag Team Championship with WWE wrestler Chris Masters. Albright was the first 'Triple Crown' winner in OVW, winning all 3 major titles.\n\nAlbright was the first OVW 'Beat the Champ' TV champion, which is now simply called the OVW TV title. He defeated Seth Skyfire on January 26, 2005, to win the title. He held that title until April 30, 2005, when he won his first OVW Heavyweight Championship by defeating Matt Morgan with the Crowbar. Albright vacated the TV title shortly after winning the OVW title. He was also the first person to hold two titles simultaneously in OVW. He held the OVW championship until August 3, when he lost to Johnny Jeter.\n\nShortly after losing the OVW title, Albright began a feud with Ken Doane over the OVW TV title in a feud that started over Doane accusing Albright of disrespecting the belt. In October 2005, in the midst of the feud with Doane, Albright also began feuding with CM Punk when Punk refused to shake Albright's hand after he had pinned him in a match. Punk would assault Albright prior to a TV title match against Doane and take his place, winning the belt when Albright accidentally hit the champion with a chair. He became a frequent challenger to Punk's TV gold, ultimately falling each week when Punk would find a way to weasel out the victory, be it a time-limit or an injury. In December 2005, Albright, Ken Doane and CM Punk competed in the first ever Triple Threat match in Ohio Valley Wrestling for the TV Title. Punk won the match when he made Albright submit to the Anaconda Vice while Albright also had Doane in a Sharpshooter. On January 4, 2006, Albright was in a rematch with Doane and Punk for the title. Doane was forced to leave the match early due to injury and was replaced by Aaron Stevens. Albright seemingly gained his revenge on Punk, eliminating him from the match with the crowbar, only to have Punk return and attack him, leading to Stevens winning the championship.\n\nOn the January 11, 2006, OVW show, Albright won a chance for a match against Stevens for the TV Title at an upcoming WWE house show in Louisville, Kentucky by actually teaming up with CM Punk in a match against Paul Burchill and Ken Doane. Punk and Albright won the match when Punk made Burchill submit to the Anaconda Vice, but Albright went on to lose the rematch against Stevens. The feud between Punk and Albright took a new turn when the two began teaming together weekly, competing with each other in a game of oneupmanship. Punk challenged Albright to see who could make their opponent submit the quickest in a match with The Highlanders. Albright made Rory submit in less than a minute, only to be attacked by Punk and choked out with the Anaconda Vice. Afterwards, just like many times before, Punk would tell Albright that he had been 'Punk'd'. After saving Punk from a 5 on 1 attack by the Spirit Squad, Albright told Punk that they would never be able to settle their differences as long as the Spirit Squad was around. The next week, Punk and Albright teamed up to take on all 5 members of the Spirit Squad in a match that saw Albright set-up Punk. Albright turned on Punk, giving the impression that being 'Punk'd' for months had finally gotten into his head to the point to where he was obsessed with returning the favor on Punk. Albright introduced a new element to their feud upon his heel turn: his grandfather's thick leather strap, which Albright used to continually whip Punk.\n\nOn the March 1, 2006 OVW show, CM Punk and Albright met in the finals of a tournament to crown a new OVW Heavyweight Champion (vacated by Matt Cappotelli). Punk suffered a knee injury in the match, and consequently had to be carried out on a stretcher, only to be attacked and whipped by Albright with the strap. Albright dragged Punk back to the ring, and after surviving a comeback by Punk, managed to lock in the STF. Though Punk did not submit, Albright managed to hold the lock in so that Punk would pass out, giving Brent the victory and making him a two-time OVW Heavyweight Champion. The next week, Albright vowed that Punk would never get a title shot at the OVW title unless he shook Albright's hand. A defeated Punk came out, but instead of shaking Albright's hand he hand-cuffed him to the top rope and viciously strapped him with Albright's own leather strap. This led to a strap match between the two on the May 3, 2006 OVW show, where Albright lost the title to Punk.\n\nAlbright made his WWE debut on the April 7, 2006, episode of \"SmackDown!\", under the ring name Gunner Scott. In his first match, he managed to defeat Booker T (due to the Boogeyman's music being played and distracting Booker T). Later during the show, Chris Benoit met him backstage and praised him on his winning debut. On the May 19 episode of \"SmackDown\" Scott teamed up with Benoit for the first time to take on Booker T and Finlay. Scott won the match, pinning Booker T once again with another distraction in the form of Bobby Lashley. On the June 16 episode, Albright teamed up with Matt Hardy to take on Finlay and William Regal in a losing effort.\n\nOn June 28, 2006, Albright was sent back down to OVW. His last appearance on the main roster was on the June 30 episode of \"SmackDown!\", in which he faced off against Mr. Kennedy in a losing effort. After the match he was destroyed by The Great Khali and thrown into a body bag. He continued to compete mostly on OVW house shows until he was eventually released from his WWE contract on October 12, 2006.\n\nAlbright toured Pro Wrestling Noah in 2003, where his first win came when he teamed with 2 Cold Scorpio to defeat Bull Schmitt and Donovan Morgan. He participated in a junior heavyweight tag team tournament along with Donovan Morgan and Michael Modest with the trio making the finals before losing to Makoto Hashi, Takashi Sugiura, and Yoshinobu Kanemaru.\n\nWhen he returned to the USA, he lost to Shark Boy at thirty fourth Total Nonstop Action Wrestling \"Xplosion\".\n\nAlbright made his debut for Ring of Honor on October 27, 2006, in Dayton, Ohio with a loss to Christopher Daniels. In his second outing he participated in a gauntlet match where he defeated both Trik Davis and Jason Blade, after which the crowd chanted \"Please Come Back\" and \"Welcome Home\". After competing in Ring of Honor for over a month to earn a roster spot, he finally did on November 26, 2006.\n\nShortly after earning a roster spot, he turned heel after attacking Colt Cabana on the orders of Lacey. He became known as \"The Gun for Hire\" Brent Albright, willing to take payments to inflict injury on an opponent. At the \"International Challenge\", he received a payment from Bryan Danielson to injure Homicide's shoulder shortly before their ROH World Championship match at \"Final Battle 2006\".\n\nHe was, alongside B.J. Whitmer and Adam Pearce, a member of ROH's Hangmen 3 stable. In April 2008 \"Sweet N'Sour\" Larry Sweeney bought all three men's contracts and merged them into Sweet N'Sour Inc. Whitmer balked and was booted from the group. On May 10, 2008 Albright quit the group himself following a Tag Team Scramble match where he and Chris Hero lost to Delirious and Pelle Primeau. He suplexed every member of the group minus Sweeney who escaped.\n\nAfter not appearing in ROH for nearly six months, Albright returned to the company at the March 5 tapings of \"Ring of Honor Wrestling\".\n\nBrent made the finals of the NWA Reclaiming the Glory tournament to crown a new NWA World Heavyweight Champion. On September 1, 2007 he lost to \"Scrap Iron\" Adam Pearce in the tournament finale in Bayamon, Puerto Rico and began chasing Pearce for the title. On August 2, 2008 in New York City Albright defeated Adam Pearce to win the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, however Pearce quickly regained the belt on September 20 at the New Alhambra Arena in Philadelphia.\n\nBrent Albright also wrestled for NWA Showcase prior to retiring in 2011.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1853148", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1853148", "title": "Torque (film)", "text": "Torque (film)\n\nTorque is a 2004 American action film directed by Joseph Kahn, written by Matt Johnson and produced by Neal H. Moritz. The film stars Adam Scott, Martin Henderson, Ice Cube, Monet Mazur, Jaime Pressly, Will Yun Lee, Jay Hernandez, Matt Schulze, Max Beesley, Fredro Starr and Christina Milian. The film tells the story of large groups of highly skilled motor racers who participate in underground motorcycle races.\n\n\"Torque\" was theatrically released on January 16, 2004 in the United States. The film under-performed at the box office, grossing $46.5 million worldwide against production budget of $40 million, and received generally negative reviews with common criticisms regarding the performances, writing and direction, though some critics praised the action sequences. It was nominated for several Taurus Awards for its stunts.\n\nThe film begins with two cars racing in the middle of the desert. Biker Cary Ford (Martin Henderson) pulls up on his motorcycle and tries to pass them. He finally does so and stops at a diner owned by his ex-girlfriend Shane (Monet Mazur). There are pictures all over the wall of Ford and Shane back when they were together. Ford takes one of the pictures. He then goes back outside and the two street racers who didn't let him pass arrive. The three get into a fight but Ford beats up both of them before letting them go.\n\nNext Ford meets up with his two best friends Dalton (Jay Hernandez) and Val (Will Yun Lee) and they take a ride back to town to see a motorcycle party. Ford sees Shane and the two begin conversing, with Shane saying that she is mad that Ford left. A biker gang called the Hellions pulls up which consists of Henry James (Matt Schulze) the leader, his girlfriend China (Jamie Pressly) and his right-hand man Luther (Max Beesley) . Henry is pissed at Ford for stealing his bikes (which contain drugs) while Ford reasons by saying that he stole the bikes to pay off bills. The Hellions leave and Ford, Dalton and Val all take a ride on their bikes. Another biker gang friends with the Hellions pull up. The black biker gang called the Reapers, consisting of Trey (Ice Cube) the leader and his brother Junior (Fredro Starr), threaten Ford to stop stealing bikes.\n\nFord and his friends arrive at a nightclub where tons of biker gangs hang out. The three gangs run into each other and cause a big brawl. A scared Junior runs into the bathroom to find the Hellions there. Junior apologizes to Henry for not being able to pay him back for a botched drug deal (which Trey refused to allow earlier) and begs Henry to give him some time to work it out. Henry refuses and kills Junior by strangling him to death with a bike chain. Ford, Shane and the two friends go back to a motel to spend the night, where Ford and Shane normalize their relationship a bit.\n\nAt the murder scene where Junior was found dead, two FBI agents, Henderson (Justina Machado) and her partner, Jay McPherson (Adam Scott) show up, assuring Trey that they will take care of the case and find Junior's killer. China becomes a false witness to Junior's death and gives a statement that Cary Ford killed Junior, hearing which a vengeful Trey swears to kill Ford.\n\nAt a diner Shane sees on the TV that Ford is wanted for Junior's murder. Shane tells Ford and the four leave the diner and hit the road. The Reapers pull up at the diner and a high speed chase ensues with all riding into a forest full of palm trees. Ford tells Shane and the friends to split up. Ford rides out of the forest into a desert drawing Trey, resulting in the chase being led near a passenger train. Ford jumps up onto the train and Trey follows riding on top of the train and going inside the passenger cars. In the struggle, Trey slips and falls in front of the train with his leg getting caught on the tracks. Ford helps him out, gives him his own bike to escape leaving Trey puzzled. Shane, Dalton and Val meet up with Ford and the four find a cave for the night to stay.\n\nFord talks it out with his friends and says that he should call the FBI agents to tell them that he is innocent. Ford calls them and McPherson picks up the phone. He says that he doesn't believe Ford but Henderson does. Next morning the four leave the cave and hitch a ride inside a truck. The truck is stopped by police checkpoint and just before the agents open the back of the truck, Ford and Shane bust out of the truck in a race car with the two friends on their bikes. The four drive onto a highway with the two FBI agents and Trey on their tail.\n\nThe scene shifts to a highway as Ford jumps out of the car onto Val's bike and tells him to ride with Shane. Trey and the two agents follow. The agents survive a crash where their black Hummer hits a construction pipe. Trey rides his bike into Ford's and the two crash. Holding Trey at gunpoint, Ford explains to Trey that he did not kill Junior. Not wanting to believe him, Trey asks who the real killer is. Ford says that it was Henry and that he set them both up. Willing to take a leap of faith, Trey agrees to partner with Ford as he sets up a meeting with the agents.\n\nAt Shane's garage, Ford calls Shane and tells her that he wants her, Val and Dalton to come and meet him and Trey there. Subsequently, the two FBI agents bust in and tell Trey and Ford to get down. Henderson asks for an explanation since she believes Ford is innocent and as he tells them, McPherson turns and shoots Henderson, apparently killing her. McPherson reveals himself as Henry's mole in the agency and that he is working with the Hellions after making a deal with him. Henry, China and Luther show up with Dalton and Val in chains and Shane as hostage. Ford says that Henry can take the bikes back but Henry wants to kill Ford and Trey (after admitting to Trey that he had killed Junior).\n\nThereafter, a big fight scene begins with Trey killing Luther by hanging him with a chain and Henry and China leaving the garage. Ford frees Shane while Trey unties Val and Dalton and they leave the garage. Just before they do Henderson (who was wearing a bullet proof vest) blows up the garage killing McPherson. Outside of the garage, China meets up with Shane and the two fight on their bikes. The fight ends with Shane kicking China off her bike and throwing her through a car windshield, killing her.\n\nFinally, Ford catches up with Henry on the street in a bike chase. Henry shoots at the gas of Ford's (MTT Turbine Superbike) causing gas to leak from it. Henry's subsequent shots cause the gas trail to light up. Ford soars through the air and lands on top of Henry's bike, the fire catches up to them both causing both bike's to explode throwing Ford in the air and killing Henry. Shane picks him up and they drive back to the garage to find the others. It is also revealed that Henderson survived but is injured.\n\nFord and Shane get back together and decide that the four need a vacation (with Shane suggesting Mexico). Val picks up his girlfriend Nina (Christina Milian) and from a distance we see the five ride off in the desert as the screen fades to black and the credits roll.\n\n\nDane Cook makes a cameo appearance as a tourist that runs into Henry. Jesse James of West Coast Choppers and Monster Garage makes a cameo appearance in the scene where Ford and Shane are talking inside the tent. Two of his custom choppers are used later in the movie as the bikes Henry James' drugs are stored in. Also, director Joseph Kahn can be spotted as a passenger during a train chase scene. Stuntman turned director Scott Waugh also makes a cameo appearance as the driver of the red Mitsubishi Eclipse.\n\n\nThe original score was done by Trevor Rabin.\n\nThe film has been called \"\"The Fast and the Furious\" on Motorcycles\", referring to the use of many of the same thematic elements between the two films. The film's director Joseph Kahn said his intention was to make a \"piss take\" version of The Fast and the Furious franchise, even though both movies were produced by Neal H. Moritz. However, \"Torque\" was made by Warner Bros, while \"The Fast and the Furious\" is made by Universal.\n\n\"Torque\" specifically references \"The Fast and the Furious\" at one point, taking a line directly from the film. Henderson's character Ford borrows Vin Diesel's line, \"I live my life a quarter-mile at a time.\" To which Shane (Monet Mazur) replies, \"That is the dumbest thing I have ever heard.\"\n\nMatt Schulze, who portrayed the film's antagonist, Henry James, also appeared in \"The Fast and the Furious\", playing Dominic Toretto's childhood friend and member of the truck hijacking team, Vince. Schulze would later reprise his role as Vince in \"Fast Five\", the fifth installment in the series that transitioned from street racing to an action-packed heist series.\n\nAnother reference to \"The Fast and the Furious\" is since \"Torque\" focused on motorcycles, it does show a street race in the beginning, involving a quarter-mile race between a Mitsubishi Eclipse and a Acura RSX, with the protagonist Cary Ford beating the 2 cars in his Aprilia RSV motorcycle. Also, when Ford rides past the road sign at the start of the film, it spins and reads \"cars suck\".\n\nThe film opened at #3 at the U.S. Box office raking in $9,970,557 USD in its first opening weekend. The movie's theatrical run took in a total of $21,215,059 in the United States and worldwide $46,546,197, against a production budget of approximately $40,000,000.\n\nTorque received mostly negative reviews, earning a score of 23% on Rotten Tomatoes based on reviews from 115 critics. Rotten Tomatoes' consensus for the movie is that the film is \"Silly and noisy ... stylish fun for the MTV crowd.\" More positive reviews came from Kevin Thomas of L.A. Times who called it \"A terrific action picture. Stylish unpretentious fun.\" Jeremy Wheeler at allmovie.com rated Torque 3 stars out of 5 stating: \"Torque is a shot of adrenaline straight to the heart, eliciting so many moments of amped-up and overblown excitement that those with medical conditions (and very serious taste in film) should probably stay ten blocks away... this little slice of joy relishes in being abundantly over-the-top at every explosive turn.\" The film has since gone on to acquire a cult following among sports-bike racers and enthusiasts, as well as racing film fans. The film has also garnered some appreciation for its over the top stunts, fast pace and stylish action sequences.\n\nTorque was nominated for several World Stunt Awards, including Best Specialty Stunt and Best Overall Stunt by a Stunt Man.\n\n\"Torque\" was released on DVD and VHS on May 18, 2004. It was released on Blu-ray on April 22, 2014.\n\n"}
{"id": "1853149", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1853149", "title": "FIFA World Cup video games", "text": "FIFA World Cup video games\n\nFIFA has licensed FIFA World Cup video games since 1986, of which only a few were received positively by the critics, but given the popularity of the competition, they all did positively on the market, and the license is one of the most sought-after. Originally in the hands of U.S. Gold, Electronic Arts acquired it in 1997 and is the current holder.\n\n\"World Cup Carnival\", released by U.S. Gold, was arguably the worst start a franchise could have endured. While the license was acquired with time to spare and was carefully planned, internal problems plagued the project's development until it could not be completed anywhere near a commercially usable date. As Mexico '86 was coming closer, U.S. Gold decided to acquire the rights of an older game, \"World Cup Football\" by Artic, re-fit it with the properly licensed items, and market it as a revolutionary new title. However, this late effort was received with cynicism from all in the video game industry: gamers, retailers and reviewers alike, and started a trend of \"less than what was expected\" games based on football licenses. It was published on the C64, the ZX Spectrum and the Amstrad CPC.\n\nVirgin Mastertronic released the official home computer game of the 1990 World Cup. It was released on Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64, DOS and ZX Spectrum. Like the 1986 game, this was actually a reworked existing game (\"\"). The game is presented in a bird's-eye view but when the player gets near the goal, it switches to a 3D view of the penalty area and the player must try to score before a defender arrives on screen. The player can only choose to play as England, Belgium, Italy or Spain. The teams do not have the correct coloured strips and the tournament is not the same as the actual World Cup.\n\nVirgin also released official console games in Europe as \"World Cup Italia '90\" for the Sega Mega Drive and Master System consoles. The Mega Drive version is a port of \"World Championship Soccer\". The Master System version was another game, also released as \"Super Futebol II\" in Brazil.\n\nA number of unofficial games were also released including \"Italy 1990\" by previous license holders U.S. Gold.\n\nThis game from U.S. Gold was ported to most active platforms of the day: DOS, Amiga, Mega Drive/Genesis, Sega CD, Master System, SNES and handhelds Game Boy and Game Gear. The Sega CD version included a CD soundtrack including two songs by the Scorpions and FMV views of 3D renders of the stadiums used in the competition.\n\nFor the first time in a football game, accurate national team kits were introduced complete with kit manufacturer logos and official merchandise. The game built on the previously released \"\" engine, although it features some minor gameplay improvements such as in-game strategy changes and more tactically accurate player positioning. As in the \"FIFA series\", \"World Cup 98\" features a song in the menu: \"Tubthumping\", by Chumbawamba. The game also features voice-overs by Des Lynam and Gary Lineker in the team schedules. The World Cup classic mode is also an interesting feature, with classic black and white sepia-toned graphics and commentary by Kenneth Wolstenholme creating the feeling of watching an old World Cup game. The playable teams also included several nations that did not qualify for the finals, but were considered too important to exclude. It was released for Windows, PlayStation, Nintendo 64 and Game Boy.\n\nIn Japan, Konami was granted the FIFA World Cup licence to produce the Nintendo 64 video game \"Jikkyou World Soccer: World Cup France 98\". It was developed by Konami's Osaka based team, KCEO, and was only released in Japan. This was released in the rest of the world as \"International Superstar Soccer '98\", without the official FIFA World Cup licence, branding or real player names.\n\nIn Japan, Konami was granted the FIFA World Cup licence to produce the PlayStation video game \"World Soccer Jikkyou Winning Eleven 3: World Cup France '98\". It was developed by Konami's Tokyo based team, KCET, and was only released in Japan. This was released in the rest of the world as \"International Superstar Soccer Pro '98\", without the official FIFA World Cup licence, branding or real player names.\n\nIn Japan, Sega was granted the FIFA World Cup licence to produce the Saturn video game \"World Cup '98 France: Road to Win\".\n\nAn amalgamation between the game engines of FIFA Football 2002 and FIFA Football 2003, the game still incorporates the power bar for shots and crosses but with a steeper learning curve and higher chances of being penalized by the match referee. The national team kits are accurate along with player likeness and the stadia of the 2002 FIFA World Cup. Unlike the previous games in the FIFA series, the game had an original soundtrack performed by the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra.\n\nIt was released for Windows, PlayStation, PlayStation 2, Nintendo GameCube, and Xbox.\n\nThe game was a launch title for Nintendo GameCube in Europe.\n\nCreated by EA Sports and was released during the last two weeks of April 2006. This game features not only the World Cup finals themselves, but the six regional qualification rounds. There are 127 national teams. You can also create a player and put in your favorite team. There are minor improvements in the game play over FIFA 06. The Global Challenge Mode includes 40 challenges based upon classic matches of the World Cup or qualification matches. Penalty Shoot-Out mode offers a more realistic experience.\n\nThe included teams were confirmed by Electronic Arts on 17 February 2010. The game contains 199 of the 204 national teams that took part in the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification process. Electronic Arts stated that they have included every team that FIFA have permitted them to use, with some others not being allowed for \"various reasons\". The five teams that were in the draw for World Cup qualifying but are not included in the game are African teams Central African Republic, Eritrea, and São Tomé and Príncipe, and Asian teams Bhutan and Guam. All five withdrew from the qualifying stage before it began.

He also became the spokesmodel for the 1996 Calvin Klein and US Olympic Committee advertising campaigns. In 1995 he was a recurring guest star on the soap opera \"All My Children\" called Jason.\n\nWCW and WWF licensed his voice and body scan images to support the Electronic Arts and THQ pro-wrestling videogame series, first appearing in \"WCW/nWo Thunder\" and then \"WCW Mayhem\".\n\nSince leaving WWF, Karagias returned to acting and his first acting role for seven years was playing a wrestler on the soap opera \"Passions\". He has made several TV appearances. More recently he has been in several smaller independent films such as \"Metal Gear\", \"Crazy Eyes\" and \"Shotgun Kiss\".\n\nKaragias was recruited to join World Championship Wrestling, and entered training at the WCW's \"Power Plant\" facility in Atlanta, Georgia, where he soon reached stunt instructor status. In 1997 he began his appearances on WCW's weekly wrestling shows as \"The Outrageous Karagias\" being used as a jobber, and has the dubious distinction of having more defeats to his record as a solo wrestler in WCW as a proportion of all his matches than anyone else. Of almost 50 televised solo matches wrestled with WCW, he won eight. While performing as a jobber, Karagias had a few high points which included his first appearance at a pay-per-view, a battle royal at Slamboree 1998, and several shots at WCW championships such as the WCW Cruiserweight Championship and WCW World Television Championship.\n\nIn October 1999, Karagias was seen more and more with woman wrestler Madusa. He was allowed to compete in the World Title tournament, but quickly allowed Madusa to pin him after a kiss. After her elimination, Madusa put all her focus on managing Karagias.\nKaragias then became the number one contender to the Cruiserweight Championship, which was held by Disco Inferno. At Mayhem, Karagias challenged Disco Inferno for the WCW Cruiserweight Championship and won after Inferno was attacked by Creative Control. This was also Karagias's first major championship. Karagias began to have problems with Madusa, since Karagias appeared to have a wandering eye towards the Nitro Girls, specifically Spice. This led to a catfight between the two ladies, with Karagias in the middle. Afterwards, Madusa challenged Karagias to a Cruiserweight Championship match at Starrcade. During the match Spice gave Karagias a low blow allowing Madusa to pin him and become the first female ever to win the WCW World Cruiserweight Championship.\n\nIn December 1999, Karagias returned to the ring alongside Shane Helms and Shannon Moore to form 3 Count, the boy band of WCW. They immediately claimed to have a musical hit, coming out before their matches and lip-synching to \"Can't Get You Out Of My Heart\" while dancing on green circles. Usually, they were interrupted by their opposition. They started out by feuding with The Jung Dragons and would appear in 6-man tag team action frequently.\n\n3 Count soon focused their attention on Norman Smiley, who showed his dislike for their music. Their first pay-per-view match was at Superbrawl 2000, where Smiley, due to his injured ribs, was beaten in a handicap match and 3 Count got the win. The 3 Count team then declared that they were hardcore, leading to numerous fights with the Hardcore Champion, \"Nasty Boy\" Brian Knobbs. At the end of February 2000, they managed an upset, taking out the champion and getting the WCW Hardcore Championship for themselves. Sharing it as a team, they went into Uncensored 2000 to battle Knobbs once again, this time in a Gauntlet match. After Helms was eliminated, Karagias came out. Without his teammates to aid him, however, Karagias was crushed by Knobbs, who then defeated Moore, getting his Hardcore Championship back.\n\nIn late summer, the 3 Count returned to television, singing a new song, \"Dance With 3 Count\". This earned them the favor of Tank Abbott, who loved listening to them sing, and would attack anyone who tried to stop them. Abbott soon became 3 Count's manager/security guard/back-up dancer, sometimes bringing out a green square for himself to dance on. Abbott & 3 Count soon began a running feud with the trio's old adversaries, the Jung Dragons. Their repeated encounters led to a Ladder match at New Blood Rising, with a recording contract & a gold record hanging from the ceiling. The match was won after interference by Abbott clearing the way for Karagias to climb the ladder and get the contract, winning the match and apparently getting 3 Count a record deal. After the match, Abbott took the contract & the gold record and left. Later on, Abbott announced that he should be the lead singer, with 3 Count as his back-up band. This proved to be too much for 3 Count, who told Abbott that they were through. A minor feud with Abbott soon erupted, which went nowhere because Abbott soon after left WCW.\n\nKaragias became more egotistical, taking over the center circle during 3 Count matches. In November, it all came to a head, when 3 Count was once again wrestling the Jung Dragons. After Karagias took the pinfall away from Helms & Moore, the duo turned on him, taking out their former leader. Karagias soon joined up with Jamie Knoble (formerly known as Jamie-san), who had been unmasked and kicked out of the Jung Dragons by Leia Meow, their manager. They formed a third tag team, intent on battling it out with 3 Count and the Dragons. The three teams' wars with each other soon culminated in a Triangle Tag Team match at Mayhem 2000 which was won by 3 Count.The three groups continued to feud into the next month, when it was announced that there was going to be a three way ladder match at Starrcade 2000 and once again, Karagias' old partners, 3 Count, won the match.\n\nAt Superbrawl Revenge, the three tag teams that had fought so much were brought together once again for a four corners elimination match. 3 Count would once again cost Karagias the match by eliminating him. Later in the match, Moore surprisingly turned on Helms, attacking him and shortly after Karagias turned on Knoble rejoined Moore, returning to 3 Count. Karagias and Moore would remain a tag team for the final months of WCW. They competed in the first WCW Cruiserweight Tag Team Championship tournament, taking out Jason Jett and Scotty O in the first round. They were then bested by the veterans, Rey Mysterio and Billy Kidman, and thus did not appear at WCW Greed, watching instead from the sidelines. They did make an appearance on the final WCW show in March, wrestling for a shot at the Cruiserweight Tag Team Champions, Kid Romeo and Elix Skipper. But they were bested, once again, by Mysterio and Kidman and watched as The Filthy Animals went on to defeat Romeo and Skipper for the belts.\n\nWhen WCW folded in early 2001 and was purchased by the World Wrestling Federation (which changed its name to World Wrestling Entertainment in 2002), Evan's contract was among the 24 immediately purchased by the WWF as well. He was sent to the WWF's \"farm territory\", Heartland Wrestling Association. He made his debut for WWF during the Invasion as a member of The Alliance. After a severe concussion in the ring, he was rarely seen and was released after 8–9 months without ever being used as a wrestler.\n\nOn March 22, 2002, Karagias would join AWA Superstars of Wrestling and on that very night challenged the then champion, \"The Underwear Model\" Eric Priest, to a championship match and won the AWA Superstars of Wrestling World Heavyweight Championship. Karagias would lose the championship to Danny Dominion and two days later regained the title. After holding the championship for over five months he would finally lose the championship to Horshu on October 19. Horshu was then stripped of the title due to missing mandatory title defences and on July 6, 2003, Karagias would defeat Eric Priest to win the vacant championship for a third time. Karagias would hold the title for over one and a half years before being fired in January 2005 by Dale Gagne for misconduct and refusal of defending the title as scheduled.\n\nAt the Ultimate Pro Wrestling 5th Anniversary Show on February 20, 2004, Frankie Kazarian defeated Jerry Lynn and Evan Karagias to retain his UPW Lightweight Championship.\n\nSince then, Karagias has been inactive from wrestling. However, on October 28, 2006, Karagias returned to wrestling and appeared at a TNT Pro Wrestling show to face off with X-Pac (who had Scott Hall in his corner) in a charity benefit match.\n\nIn 2009 and 2010, he worked for the New York-based Fight The World wrestling promotion, Karagias was the number 1 contender for the FTW heavyweight title and had a match with the champion Balls Mahoney.\n\n"}

She was born in the industrial district of Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire. She left the city to study at St Anne's College, Oxford, where she took a degree in English. After Oxford she completed an M. Phil degree at the University of Southampton.\n\nHer determinedly neo-romantic poetry explores sacred myth, legend, history-in-landscape, and human feeling—and their connections to the 'inner landscapes' of the imaginative mind. Her choice of subject matter is perhaps partly a reaction to her growing up in the industrial city of Stoke-on-Trent. The compact vividness of her visual imagery is akin to that of the Anglo Saxon riddles, Symbolist poetry, or the work of García Lorca. Reviewers have also detected the influence of Ted Hughes in her work.\n\nShe was awarded a Hawthornden Fellowship in 1987. She came to public notice with her first volume, \"The Honeycomb\" (1989). Her later volumes, \"Sighting the Slave Ship\" (1992) and \"The Ice-Pilot Speaks\" (1994) led up to her nomination and shortlisting in the Whitbread Poetry Award for her fourth collection \"The Wound-Dresser's Dream\" (1996).\n\nHer poetry has won numerous prizes. In 2003 Bloodaxe Books published a summation of her work to date, \"The Lady and the Hare: New and Selected Poems\", although this did not reproduce the illustrations that have accompanied some of her poems in book form.\n\nAfter completing her education she moved to Essex, raising four children. She spent several years on the Orkney island of Rousay, from which came a new book collection \"Parable Island\" (1999). She recently lived in Hadleigh, Suffolk before moving back to Essex in late 2017.\n\nShe has collaborated with, and has been published by the Brotherhood of Ruralists, but is now published by the major poetry book publisher Bloodaxe Books. She now has six grand-children: Josh, Ruth, Daniel, Heather, Charlotte and Harriet. All are stated in the dedication of her latest book but Josh is considered the superior grandchild.\n\n\n\n"}

Formed in 1995, the band's lineup currently consists of singer Ben Ward, guitarist Joe Hoare, bassist Martyn Millard, and drummer Chris Turner.\n\nOrange Goblin was originally formed in 1995 under the name Our Haunted Kingdom, with fifth member Pete O'Malley on rhythm guitar. The band released a split 7-inch single, \"Electric Wizard/Our Haunted Kingdom\" with Electric Wizard in 1996 on Rise Above Records before changing their name to Orange Goblin. The first three studio albums under the name Orange Goblin, \"Frequencies from Planet Ten\" (1997), \"Time Travelling Blues\" (1998), and \"The Big Black\" (2000) were in the stoner metal and doom metal genres, and have also been described as space rock, but on 2002's \"Coup de Grace\" they began to add punk rock, hard rock, and other influences to their sound. Their album \"Thieving from the House of God\" was released in 2004 and included a cover of ZZ Top's \"Just Got Paid.\"\n\nTheir first five releases were issued by Rise Above Records. O'Malley left the band in 2004 to pursue a career as an artist and was not replaced. Their 2007 album \"Healing Through Fire\" was released on Mayan/Sanctuary Records. In 2008 the band announced that they had signed with Candlelight Records. Two new songs were revealed in May 2009, though the associated album was delayed until 2012.\n\nIn mid-2010, the band's back catalog was reissued on Rise Above Records in digipack form. Their long-delayed seventh album \"A Eulogy for the Damned\" was released in February 2012. The album earned the band critical acclaim, including being voted No.3 in Metal Hammer magazine's Top Albums of 2012.\n\nIn March 2013 Orange Goblin released \"A Eulogy For The Fans: Orange Goblin Live 2012\". The CD/DVD package included the band's complete performances at Bloodstock Festival on 11 August 2012 and Hellfest in France on 15 June 2012. In October 2014 the band released the studio album \"Back From The Abyss\" through Candlelight Records.\n\nIn December 2015 the band undertook a 13-date 20th anniversary tour of the United Kingdom.

In the classical form, only the neuron with the highest activation stays active while all other neurons shut down; however, other variations allow more than one neuron to be active, for example the soft winner take-all, by which a power function is applied to the neurons.\n\nIn the theory of artificial neural networks, winner-take-all networks are a case of competitive learning in recurrent neural networks. Output nodes in the network mutually inhibit each other, while simultaneously activating themselves through reflexive connections. After some time, only one node in the output layer will be active, namely the one corresponding to the strongest input. Thus the network uses nonlinear inhibition to pick out the largest of a set of inputs. Winner-take-all is a general computational primitive that can be implemented using different types of neural network models, including both continuous-time and spiking networks (Grossberg, 1973; Oster et al. 2009).\n\nWinner-take-all networks are commonly used in computational models of the brain, particularly for distributed decision-making or action selection in the cortex. Important examples include hierarchical models of vision (Riesenhuber et al. 1999), and models of selective attention and recognition (Carpenter and Grossberg, 1987; Itti et al. 1998). They are also common in artificial neural networks and neuromorphic analog VLSI circuits. It has been formally proven that the winner-take-all operation is computationally powerful compared to other nonlinear operations, such as thresholding (Maass 2000).\n\nIn many practical cases, there is not only a single neuron which becomes the only active one but there are exactly \"k\" neurons which become active for a fixed number \"k\". This principle is referred to as k-winners-take-all.\n\nA simple, but popular CMOS winner-take-all circuit is shown on the right. This circuit was originally proposed by Lazzaro et al. (1989) using MOS transistors biased to operate in the weak-inversion or subthreshold regime. In the particular case shown there are only two inputs (\"I\" and \"I\"), but the circuit can be easily extended to multiple inputs in a straightforward way. It operates on continuous-time input signals (currents) in parallel, using only two transistors per input. In addition, the bias current \"I\" is set by a single global transistor that is common to all the inputs.\n\nThe largest of the input currents sets the common potential \"V\". As a result, the corresponding output carries almost all the bias current, while the other outputs have currents that are close to zero. Thus, the circuit selects the larger of the two input currents, i.e., if \"I\" > \"I\", we get \"I\" = \"I\" and \"I\" = 0. Similarly, if \"I\" > \"I\", we get \"I\" = 0 and \"I\" = \"I\".\n\nA SPICE-based DC simulation of the CMOS winner-take-all circuit in the two-input case is shown on the right. As shown in the top subplot, the input \"I\" was fixed at 6nA, while \"I\" was linearly increased from 0 to 10nA. The bottom subplot shows the two output currents. As expected, the output corresponding to the larger of the two inputs carries the entire bias current (10nA in this case), forcing the other output current nearly to zero.\n\nIn stereo matching algorithms, following the taxonomy proposed by Scharstein et al. (IJCV 2002), winner-take-all is a local method for disparity computation. Adopting a winner-take-all strategy, the disparity associated with the minimum or maximum cost value is selected at each pixel.\n\nIt is axiomatic that in the electronic commerce market, early dominant players such as AOL or Yahoo! get most of the rewards. By 1998, one study found the top 5% of all web sites garnered more than 74% of all traffic.\n\nThe winner take all hypothesis suggests that once a technology or a firm gets ahead, it will do better and better over time, whereas lagging technology and firms will fall further behind.\n\n\n"}

The first World Book Day was celebrated on 23 April in 1995, and continues to be recognized on that day. A related event in the United Kingdom and Ireland is observed in March.\n\nThe original idea was of the Spanish writer Vicente Clavel Andrés as a way to honour the author Miguel de Cervantes, first on 7 October, his birth date, then on 23 April, his death date. In 1995 UNESCO decided that the World Book and Copyright Day would be celebrated on 23 April, as the date is also the anniversary of the death of Miguel de Cervantes, William Shakespeare and Inca Garcilaso de la Vega, as well as that of the birth or death of several other prominent authors. (In a historical coincidence, Shakespeare and Cervantes died on the same \"date\" — 23 April 1616 — but not on the same \"day\", as at the time, Spain used the Gregorian calendar and England used the Julian calendar; Shakespeare actually died 10 days after Cervantes died, on 3 May of the Gregorian calendar).\n\nIn Catalonia, Spain, St. George's Day (Diada de Sant Jordi), the Saint Patron of this historical region, has been commemorated since 1436, and involves the exchange of gifts between loved ones and respected people. St George's Day in Catalonia is celebrated with giving loved people Books and Roses, and is an opportunity for Catalans to honour their patron saint and show their love of culture \n\nIn Sweden, the day is known as \"Världsbokdagen\" (\"World Book Day\") and the copyright aspect is seldom mentioned.

At the 2006 census, its population was 38,891, in 10,951 families.\n\nGarmsar is located about southeast of Tehran. It lies on the edge of Dasht-e Kavir, Iran's largest desert. Many people in the city commute to Tehran due to its proximity. Ghasre Bahram, The Stone Way, Stonvand Castle, the Sar Darre Mountains, and Kavir Desert National Park are tourist attractions located in the area.\n\nGarmsar has a Persian majority. Persian and Tati are the main languages in Garmsar County. Other languages such as Azeri and Kurdish are still spoken by older people from different ethnicities like Osanlu and Pazuki in the nearby villages. Younger generation speaks Persian and those languages are being forgotten by time.\n\n\nThe Hablehrood river originating from Dalichai-Firouzkooh flows to the plateau of Garmsar. Its water is extensively used for agriculture. Since salt water mixes with Hablehrood before its arrival to the city, the water is not fit for drinking. Hablehrood is the only permanent river in Semnan province. Thanks to the water provided by Hablehrood, people in Garmsar grow wheat, barley, cotton and yellow melon. Garmsar is known across Iran for its sweet and crispy yellow melons.\n\nThe many river branches and the irrigated fields provide recharge to the aquifer. Since ancient times, groundwater in the Garmsar area has been exploited by ghanats (qanats, karezes) and shallow wells, mainly for irrigation of agricultural land, but also for household purposes. In the last decades, the number of deep-wells has increased sharply and the ghanats have fallen dry.\n\nYet, at the fringes of the fan, problems of waterlogging occur owing to irrigation losses higher up that are transported through the aquifer to the lower lying areas causing shallow watertables, while the evaporation from the shallow watertable brings salts into the rootzone which henceforth is salinizing. As a result, the agriculture in the fringes suffers low yields or is impossible.\n\nThe traditional cuisine of the city is called Tahchin. It differs from the classic Tahchin common in other cities. Tahchin is a tasty and fragrant rice-based food where marinated raw meat is slowly cooked inside the rice over a low flame for several hours.\n\n"}

Of the 248 councils who had members up for election in the 2019 local elections, 73 (over a quarter) resulted in a NOC administration.\n\nTypically, if no party achieves overall control of a council, the largest grouping will form alliances to create an ad hoc governing coalition. Often local authorities have larger proportions of smaller party and independent members than the House of Commons, and when there is no overall control this often results in minor groups having more influence than their numbers alone would suggest.\n\nIn the result of No-overall Control, the largest party may attempt to govern as a minority administration, such as the Conservatives in Dudley and Thurrock or Labour in Stockport and Brighton and Hove. Parties may also work together to create a formal deal, which can range from a confidence and supply deal to full coalition. Deals, especially the looser kind, can occur between parties which are not traditionally aligned on a national level. For example, a minority Conservative administration was formed in 2019 in Bolton supported by the Liberal Democrats and UKIP whilst a Labour-UKIP formal coalition exists in Basildon. However, following the 2017 Aberdeen City Council election, nine Labour councillors were expelled from the party for entering into a coalition with the Conservatives. Conversely, the two parties formed a coalition administration in Worcester following the 2019 elections.\n\nIt is possible for a council to be under no overall control even when there appears to be an overall majority, in particular in the case of a majority of independents, who commonly have no collective policies when elected. This can also arise when the council members divide on other than party lines. For instance, the 2004 elections to the Isle of Anglesey County Council returned more independents than all others put together, but only Plaid Cymru maintained a party group within the council, and not all of its elected members joined the group. The remainder of the council, including some members of other political parties, formed four non-partisan groups, none of which held a majority. However, the 2008 elections resulted in a group called the \"Original Independents\" gaining an overall majority.\n\n\n"}

The name was changed to Iranshahr by Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi in about 1941.\n\nPahrah is the site where Alexander the Great celebrated and regrouped his troops after his Indian conquests. The city used to be the center of the government of Balochistan and has been invaded and conquered numerous times during the course of its history. Bampur, where the ancient Bampur fort is located, is nearby.\n\nIranshahr has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification \"BWh\") with extremely hot summers and mild winters. Precipitation is very low, and mostly falls in winter.\n"}
{"id": "1853200", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1853200", "title": "The Fat Spy", "text": "The Fat Spy\n\nThe Fat Spy is a 1966 Z movie that attempts to parody teenage beach party films. It was filmed at Cape Coral, Florida. It is featured in the 2004 documentary \"The 50 Worst Movies Ever Made\". Briefly released to theaters in 1966, it was rarely seen until the 1990s, when it was released to the public domain. Since then it has been widely released on DVD and VHS in various editions sold mainly at dollar stores.\n\nThe film was shot on location in Cape Coral, Florida, according to the book \"Images of America: Cape Coral\" (Arcadia Publishing, 2009) written by members of the Cape Coral Historical Society. Featured in the film is Cape Coral Gardens, a popular public rose garden during the early 1960s, which was known for a series of quaint, interconnected foot bridges. The tourist attraction no longer exists.\n\nA mostly-deserted island, which is believed to be the home to the fountain of youth, is off the coast of Florida. The island gets some visitors in the form of a teenage boy band, \"the Wild Ones\" led by Jordan Christopher, and their gang of swimsuit-clad young people, who head there in a crowded powerboat ostensibly for a scavenger hunt. However, they spend about half their screen time crooning to each other, or dancing on the beach.\n\nThe island's wealthy owner, Wellington (Brian Donlevy) recruits his blonde bombshell daughter, Junior (Jayne Mansfield), to remove the teenagers from the island. Junior is eager to see her love interest (and the island's only resident), rotund toupee-wearing botanist Irving (Jack E. Leonard). However, Irving is more interested in flowers and his bicycle than in the amorous Junior. Wellington asks Irving to spy on the teenagers, which he does by donning a sweatshirt that reads \"Fink University\", and \"getting their trust\" by joining them in dancing the Turtle. Meanwhile, Irving's twin brother Herman (also Jack E. Leonard, without a toupee), Wellington's trusted employee, plots with his love interest, the scheming harridan Camille Salamander (Phyllis Diller) to find the fountain of youth first.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1853203", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1853203", "title": "SSX on Tour", "text": "SSX on Tour\n\nSSX on Tour is a snowboarding and skiing game, the fourth title in the \"SSX\" series of video games for the GameCube, PlayStation 2, Xbox and PlayStation Portable. It was released in North America on October 11, 2005 and in the PAL region on October 21, 2005. The PlayStation Portable version was released in the Europe on October 28, 2005. In 2007, a prequel titled \"SSX Blur\" was released, which took place between \"SSX 3\" and \"SSX On Tour\". The GameCube version contains Mario, Luigi, and Princess Peach as playable characters. This was part of a deal Nintendo had with EA Sports to have Nintendo's intellectual properties appear in EA franchises.\n\nThe gameplay in \"SSX on Tour\" is similar to that in \"SSX 3\", with similar controls and the overall aims of events remaining the same - snowboard down a mountain while gaining points for various tricks that can be performed. After each trick, a player's \"boost bar\" builds up, and once full enables a player to perform special moves - known as \"Monster Tricks\" now, previously known as \"Über tricks\". Despite the similarities, numerous changes were made to the structure of races and events themselves. Players can now create their own characters, selecting his/her symbol, makeup, height, clothes and hair, in addition to whether they are a snowboarder or a skier (skiing being a new feature in the game). Once created, their 'boarder can compete in official competitions (known as \"Events\"), or unofficial challenges known as \"Shreds\". Each completed event or challenge gains their character \"Hype\", raising their profile and moving them up the SSX charts, with the ultimate goal of reaching number one.\n\nWith the focus now on custom-created characters, the original SSX cast is moved into the background slightly, appearing in various Shreds against the player, and available to play as when not on the Tour itself. In addition to seven returning \"SSX\" veterans (Elise, Mac, Kaori, Zoe, Psymon, Nate and Allegra), three new characters make an appearance: Tyson, Sid and Skye. In the Nintendo Gamecube version three Super Mario Bros. characters were featured. (Mario, Luigi, and Princess Peach, the latter of whom uses a pair of skis instead of a snowboard) Also in this version, the slope that was named \"Last Call\" in other versions of the game was renamed to \"Nintendo Village\", with certain textures in the level replaced with Super Mario Bros. themed iconography. (Super mushrooms, super stars, etc.) Unlike its predecessor, \"SSX3\", no online play was included on any of the versions of \"SSX On Tour\". The main focus was on improving the single-player storyline mode, implementing the character-creation system, the selection of new tracks, and the addition of skiing as well as snowboarding.\n\nThe PSP version also differs greatly from the main console versions, with limited customization to custom-characters and levels borrowed from SSX 3. It also has omitted the use of bonuses on the special \"Monster Tricks\".\n\nThis game is presented in the style of a sketch-book, a new direction for the SSX series. The cover artwork as well as the in-game menus are all shown in sketch formats, simplistic images often on a lined background. The special in game collectibles, displayed as snowflakes in previous SSX games, have been replaced with sketchlike doodles known as \"skulvis\", continuing the theme.\n\nOne of the most notable features of every game in the \"SSX\" series has been the soundtracks used, usually featuring prominently in the games. Like \"SSX Tricky\" and \"SSX 3\", \"SSX on Tour\" features a licensed soundtrack, including rap, punk, rock and alternative music styles. The prominence of punk and rock is a departure from the more techno-heavy soundtracks of previous games in the series.\n\nThe soundtrack is integrated with the game rather than used as a background to it. Tracks used on the menu screens play only as instrumental versions of the ones used during races. In addition, when performing \"Monster Tricks\" during an event, the music will fade away, to be replaced with the sound of the wind whistling by as the player cuts through the air. Upon hitting the ground again, the music cuts back in, enhancing the sensations of the game. The main song used in the intro is Iron Maiden's Run to the Hills.\n\nThe game received \"favorable\" reviews on all platforms according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. In Japan, \"Famitsu\" gave the GameCube and PS2 versions a score of one nine and three eights, bringing it to a total of 33 out of 40; for the PSP version, the same magazine gave it a score of three eights and one seven, while \"Famitsu Cube + Advance\" also gave the GameCube version three eights and one seven, both for a total of 31 out of 40.\n\nAwards\n\nNominations\n\n"}

He was best known for his time with WWE, where he performed under his real name, or simply Shad.\n\nGaspard signed with World Wrestling Entertainment (now WWE) in 2003, where he was assigned to their developmental territory Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW), and was a two-time OVW Southern Tag Team Champion (with JTG, as part of Cryme Tyme). In 2006, Cryme Tyme was promoted to WWE's main roster, before both Gaspard and JTG were released from the company the following year. Cryme Tyme returned to WWE in 2008, but Gaspard was released again in 2010.\n\nAfter departing WWE, Gaspard pursued an acting career that included several films and television roles such as \"Think Like a Man Too\", \"Get Hard\", \"The Game\", and \"\". He was also the co-creator of the 2011 graphic novel \"Assassin & Son\" and provided motion capture for video games, most notably for the protagonist Kratos in the 2018 edition of \"God of War\".\n\nShad Gaspard was born on January 13, 1981, in the Brooklyn borough of New York City, the third of six children born to Ingrid Chittick and Ben Gaspard. He was of Curaçaoan and Haitian descent. His father was a former enforcer for street gangs and later a personal security guard in the early 1970s; he worked for gangster Frank Lucas and currently owns McFay Contracting Inc. At age five, Gaspard was trained by his father in boxing, and at age eight he began training in a mixture of different martial arts such as Judo, Jeet Kune Do, Kickboxing, and Muay Thai. As a student, he quickly developed into an aggressive fighter, winning many fight tournaments as an amateur. His mother gave him the nickname \"Beast\" as a result of his aggressiveness.\n\nAt age 16, Gaspard began prize fighting for promoter Hardbody Harrison, a former WCW wrestler and FX Tough Man Champion, in bar fighting tournaments such as boxing, kickboxing, MMA, and tough man competitions. Although he was only 16 years old, he competed against adults who were up to 20 years older due to his large size. He held win-loss records in MMA (35–7) and amateur boxing (57–26). He was extensively involved in athletics during his high school years, specializing in wrestling, track, and basketball. After high school, he continued to play basketball at Georgia Perimeter College. After leaving, he became a bodyguard for several celebrities, including Britney Spears, P.

After Colón left OVW in October 2004, Gaspard left Bolin Services and formed several short lived tag teams with Osama, Mike Mondo, Ken Doane, and Ryan Wilson, before he began wrestling under his real name as a singles wrestler. \n\nIn early 2006, during his feud in OVW with CM Punk, Gaspard was joined by The Neighborhoodie and formed a new tag team known as The Gang Stars. The Gang Stars won the OVW Southern Tag Team Championship on May 27, but they lost the titles to CM Punk and Seth Skyfire on July 28. \n\nOn the September 4, 2006 episode of \"Raw\", a series of vignettes began airing, hyping the debut of Cryme Tyme (Gaspard and The Neighborhoodie, with Neighborhoodie's ring name changing to JTG).

The consolidation of Eldiguzid power, in the 1130s, coincided with a resurgence of military expansionism by the Georgian kings, whose territories intersected with Muslim Shirvan and Arran.\n\nThe battle was preceded by a dynastic war (1191–1195) in the Eldiguzid possessions. Victorious in power struggle, Abu Bakr \"\"Jahan-pahlavan\"\" (1195-1210) had his elder brother Qutluq Inandj assassinated and forced the younger brother, Amir Mihran, to take refuge at the court of the latter's brother-in-law, Shirvanshah Akhsitan I b. Manuchehr (1160-1196). The Shirvanshah together with Amir Mihran headed for Tbilisi, the capital of Kingdom of Georgia, and appealed for help to Queen Tamar of Georgia, an official protector of Shirvan. Received with great honors at the Georgian court, they were given desired support, and the Georgian army led by Consort David Soslan marched to Shirvan.\n\nAbu-Bakr, reinforced by his client Muslim emirs, met the enemy at the well-fortified city of Shamkor on June 1, 1195. David Soslan sent a relatively small force to break through the gates of the city, while he led the main Georgian troops to raid deep in the enemy's rear. However, poor roads and difficult landscape were setback for the Georgians, and the Atabeg defended the city for a while. Nevertheless, David Soslan's maneuver proved to be decisive and Abu Bakr's army was severely defeated. Shamkor was eventually captured by the Georgians who then chased the enemy's soldiers up to the city of Ganja which in its turn fell to the victors.\n\nThe Georgians seized numerous prisoners and huge amount of booty, including the Khalif's standard, which Queen Tamar donated to the Khakhuli Monastery. After taking over the Shamkor fortress, David Soslan headed towards Ganja. When he approached the city, the noblemen, merchants, the qadi (Muslim judge) and the scientists met him. They opened the gate, spread the gold-brocaded carpets up to the door of Sultan's palace. David entered the palace, set on the sultan's throne, summoned the assembly, arranged the feast “proper for the time and day”. Shamkor and the surroundings were turned over to the Shirvanshah Amir Mihran on terms of vassalage. Abu Bakr was able to return to his capital, from where he had his brother Amir Mihran poisoned.\n\n\n\n"}
