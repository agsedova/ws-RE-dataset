The Kabul River empties into the Indus River near Attock, Pakistan. It is the main river in eastern Afghanistan and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan.\n\nThe Kabul River passes through the cities of Kabul, Surobi, and Jalalabad in Afghanistan before flowing into Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in Pakistan some north of the Durand Line border crossing at Torkham. In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the river passes through the cities of Peshawar, Charsadda, and Nowshera. In its upper reaches it is known as the Sarchashma.\n\nThe major tributaries of the Kabul River are the Logar, Panjshir, Alingar, Surkhab, Kunar, Bara, and Swat rivers.\n\nThe Kabul River is little more than a trickle for most of the year, but swells in summer due to melting snows in the Hindu Kush Range. Its largest tributary is the Kunar River, which starts out as the Mastuj River, flowing from the Chiantar glacie in Brughil valley in Chitral, Pakistan and after flowing south into Afghanistan it is met by the Bashgal river flowing from Nurestan. The Kunar meets the Kabul near Jalalabad. In spite of the Kunar carrying more water than the Kabul, the river continues as the Kabul River after this confluence, mainly for the political and historical significance of the name.\n\nThe Kabul River is impounded by several dams. The Naghlu, Surobi, and Darunta dams are located in the Kabul and Nangarhar provinces of Afghanistan. The Warsak Dam is in the Valley of Peshawar in Pakistan, approximately 20 km northwest of the city of Peshawar.\n\nIn Arrian's \"The Campaigns of Alexander\", the River Kabul is referred to as Κωφήν \"Kōphēn\" (Latin spelling \"Cophen\"), the accusative of Κωφής \"Kōphēs\" (Latin spelling \"Cophes\").\n\nThe word \"Kubhā\" which is the ancient name of the river is both a Sanskrit and Avestan word. The word later changed to \"Kābul\".\n\nAl-Biruni also called it \"the River of Ghorwand\".\n\nThe Kabul River later gave its name to the region and to the settlement of Kabul.\n\n"}

He was the most honored documentary filmmaker in Academy history, winning four Oscars from twelve nominations.\n\nGuggenheim was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, into a prominent German-Jewish family, the son of Ruth (Stix) and Jack Albert Guggenheim. His father and grandfather had a furniture business. He suffered from dyslexia as a child but the condition went undiagnosed and he was thought to be a \"slow learner.\" He did not learn to read until the age of nine. While studying farming at Colorado A&M in 1943, Guggenheim was drafted into the United States Army assigned to the 106th Division. Due to a severe foot infection, he avoided active duty in the Battle of the Bulge. Upon discharge from the service, he finished his college education at University of Iowa in 1948 and then moved to New York City to pursue a career in broadcasting.\n\nGuggenheim's first job was working for Lew Cohen at CBS, where he was exposed to the new media of film and storytelling.\n\nHe was subsequently recruited to St. Louis, Missouri, to serve as director of one of the first public television stations in the country, KETC. Two years later in 1954, Guggenheim founded his film production company, Charles Guggenheim and Associates, and produced his first feature film, \"The Great St. Louis Bank Robbery\" (1959), starring Steve McQueen. In 1956, he produced the first political advertisement broadcast on television (for Adlai Stevenson). In the early 1960s, Guggenheim formed a partnership with television and documentary film producer Shelby Storck and he and Storck collaborated on several documentaries which were nominated for and/or won Academy Awards. Guggenheim received his first Academy Award for Documentary Short Subject for 1964's \"Nine from Little Rock\", about the desegregation effort in Little Rock, Arkansas in 1957. Storck and Guggenheim also collaborated on a well-received political film for Pennsylvania governor Milton Shapp in 1966. That year, Guggenheim moved his company and his family to Washington, D.C., where he became a media advisor to many Democratic political figures. He worked on four presidential campaigns and hundreds of gubernatorial and senatorial campaigns.\n\nGuggenheim worked on Robert Kennedy's presidential campaign; after Sen. Kennedy was assassinated, Guggenheim was asked by the Kennedy family to put together a tribute for the 1968 Chicago Convention. It was completed in less than two months. It was shown at the convention and broadcast simultaneously. The convention hall came to a standstill for twenty minutes. The resulting film, \"Robert Kennedy Remembered\" (1968), won the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film. Although Guggenheim occasionally ventured into feature and political film production, he stayed mostly with documentary films. Charles quit producing political campaign advertisements in the early 1980s saying, \"If you play the piano in a house full of ill repute, it doesn't matter how well you play the piano.\" He won two more Oscars for short subject documentary film-making, for \"The Johnstown Flood\" (1989) and \"A Time for Justice\" (1995). He received twelve nominations in total.\n\nHis last documentary was produced with his daughter and colleague (since 1986) Grace Guggenheim: the 2003 TV documentary film \"Berga: Soldiers of Another War\", a little-known story about a group of 350 American soldiers captured by the Nazis during the Battle of the Bulge who, because they were Jewish or the Nazis thought they \"looked Jewish\", were sent to slave labor camp and worked beside civilian political prisoners. (Guggenheim, who was Jewish, had himself been a member of the 106th Division, which had the highest casualty rate of the Allied Divisions. But a severe leg infection caused him to be left behind when his unit was shipped overseas.) Guggenheim finished the film six weeks before his death in October 2002 from pancreatic cancer. \"Soldiers and Slaves\", a companion book to the film, was published by Roger Cohen, \"New York Times\" and \"Herald Tribune\" columnists using research materials.\n\nGuggenheim married Marion Streett in 1957. They had three children: Davis, Grace, and Jonathan. Davis followed in his father's footsteps as a documentary filmmaker and won an Oscar for best documentary in 2007 for \"An Inconvenient Truth\".\n\nGuggenheim is recognized with a star on the St. Louis Walk of Fame.\n\nThe moving image collection of Charles Guggenheim is held at the Academy Film Archive. The Charles Guggenheim papers at the Academy’s Margaret Herrick Library complement the film material at the Academy Film Archive. Guggenheim's film \"Children Without\" was preserved by the Academy Film Archive in 2016.\n\n\n\n"}

All but the last of these had been eliminated from Parliament in the parliamentary election of 2001. The party aimed to secure a niche in the middle ground of Fijian politics, offering a multiracial alternative to the Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua/Conservative Alliance coalition of Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase (supported almost exclusively by indigenous Fijians) on the one hand, and the Fiji Labour Party of former Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry (supported mostly by Indo-Fijians) on the other.

Scott. Based on the 1967 novel \"Un animal doué de raison\" (lit. \"A Sentient Animal\"), by French writer Robert Merle, the screenplay was written by Buck Henry.\n\nA brilliant and driven scientist, Jake Terrell, and his young and beautiful wife, Maggie, train dolphins to communicate with humans. This is done by teaching the dolphins to speak English in dolphin-like voices. Two of his dolphins, Alpha (\"Fa\") and Beta (\"Bea\"), are stolen by officials of the shadowy Franklin Foundation headed by Harold DeMilo (Fritz Weaver), the supportive backer of the Terrells' research. After the dolphins are kidnapped, an investigation by an undercover government agent for hire, Curtis Mahoney (Paul Sorvino), reveals that the Institute is planning to further train the dolphins to carry out a political assassination by having them place a magnetic limpet mine on the hull of the yacht of the President of the United States.\n\n\nThe novel was translated into English by Helen Weaver and published in the US in 1969 under the title \"The Day of the Dolphin\".\n\nThe film version was originally going to be directed by Roman Polanski for United Artists in 1969, with Polanski writing the script. However, while Polanski was in London, England, looking for filming locations in August 1969, his pregnant wife, the actress Sharon Tate, was murdered in their Beverly Hills home by disciples of Charles Manson. Polanski returned to the United States and abandoned the project.\n\nThe following year it was announced Franklin Schaffner would make the movie for the Mirisch Corporation. These plans were frustrated and Joseph Levine ended up buying the project from United Artists for Mike Nichols.\n\nScott was paid $750,000 for his role.\n\nThe film was mostly shot on Abaco Island in The Bahamas. Production was extremely difficult. Scott allegedly held up production for three days at the start of the shoot. Nichols later described it as the toughest shoot he had done to date.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews when released in 1973. Pauline Kael, the film critic for \"The New Yorker\", suggested that if the best subject that Nichols and Henry could think of was talking dolphins, then they should quit making movies altogether. Gene Siskel of the \"Chicago Tribune\" penned a positive review commenting that, \"Ultimately, \"The Day of the Dolphin\" works because of the values it celebrates and Scott communicates. The values are communication and love. In spite of their material, Nichols and Scott have given us a film that reminds us what love and care can do not so much for the object of affection, but for the person who tenders it. On that level, \"The Day of the Dolphin\" is really a fable.\"\n\nThe film was not successful commercially, though it was nominated for two Academy Awards, for Best Original Score (Georges Delerue) and Best Sound (Richard Portman and Larry Jost). Levine also claimed the movie had guaranteed pre-sales of $8,450,000 to cover costs, including a sale to NBC, which had expressed interest into turning the story into a TV series.\n\nAlpha the dolphin was named best animal actor in the 24th Patsy Awards.\n\nLevine admitted the film was not a success:\n\nThe rushes looked great. But it just didn't jell somehow. I really think Mike [Nichols] was the wrong guy to direct. And George C. Scott!... He got paid $750,000 for that movie—and ran us over schedule. The first three days of shooting he reported in with a \"virus\".\n\nAs of March 2020, \"The Day of the Dolphin\" holds a rating of 44% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 25 reviews.\n\nMerle's novel, a satire of the Cold War, is supposedly the basis for this film, but the film's plot was substantially different from that of the novel. The movie is instead inspired in part from the scientist John C. Lilly's life. A physician, biophysicist, neuroscientist, and inventor, Lilly specialized in the study of consciousness. In 1959, he founded the Communications Research Institute at St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands and served as its director until 1968. There he worked with dolphins exploring dolphin intelligence and human-dolphin communication.\n\nSee also \"Bottlenose dolphin communication\" and \"John Lilly and cetacean communication\".\n\n\n"}

From the lake, it flows east along the Rwanda-Burundi and Rwanda-Tanzania borders to a confluence with the Ruvubu River. The waters of the Kagera are thus provided by two major tributaries, the Nyabarongo of Rwanda, which feeds Lake Rweru, and the Ruvubu of Burundi. It is unknown which of these two feeder rivers is the longer and hence the ultimate source of the Nile. From the confluence, the Kagera flows north along the Rwanda-Tanzania border, over Rusumo Falls and through Akagera National Park. It then takes a turn to the east, following the Tanzania-Uganda border and emptying into Lake Victoria in Uganda. In 1898, Richard Kandt discovered the source of the Kagera.\n\nThe river has featured prominently in the histories of the countries it runs through, particularly Rwanda. In 1894, German Gustav Adolf von Götzen crossed the Kagera at Rusumo Falls, beginning the Rwandan colonial era; and in 1916, during World War I, the Belgians defeated the Germans, entering Rwanda by the same route. The river gained international notoriety in 1994 for carrying bodies from the Rwandan genocide into Lake Victoria, causing a state of emergency to be declared in areas of Uganda, where these bodies eventually washed up.\n\nThe Kagera rises in Burundi and flows into Lake Victoria. It is the largest single inflow into the lake, contributing approximately 6.4 billion cubic metres of water a year (about 28 per cent of the lake's outflow). The Kagera is formed by the confluence of the Ruvuvu and the Nyabarongo, close to the northernmost point of Lake Tanganyika. It forms parts of the Burundi–Tanzania, Rwanda–Tanzania, Burundi–Rwanda, and Tanzania–Uganda borders. It lends its name to Akagera National Park in northern Rwanda, as well as to the Kagera Region of Tanzania. On the river are the Rusumo Falls, an important crossing point between Rwanda and Tanzania. It is near the town of Rusumo.\n\nThe Kagera River basin is rich in fish. , there were at least 55 species known from the Rwandan section alone and the actual number is likely higher. Additionally, there are at least 15 undescribed species of haplochromine cichlids that are endemic to some of the lakes in the upper parts of the river basin. Because of the many waterfalls and rapids, the various sections of the Kagera River basin are clearly separated, making movements between them difficult or even impossible to fish.\n\nDuring the Rwandan genocide of 1994, the Kagera was used to dispose of corpses as thousands of Tutsis and Hutu political moderates were murdered on the river banks. The river brought the massacred bodies into Lake Victoria, creating a serious health hazard in Uganda.\n\n"}

In 1962, the Sanghao Caves were discovered outside of Mardan, which yielded artefacts from the Middle Paleolithic period, over 30,000 years ago. Other sites in the immediate area have yielded evidence of human activity from the Upper Paleolithic period. Further excavations from the area around Jamal Garhi near Mardan recovered artefacts from the Mesolithic period. \nThe area around Mardan then formed part of the homeland of the Gandhara grave culture around 1800 BCE. The Gandharan grave culture appears to have been a Central Asian group that may represent part of the Indo-Aryan invasion into the subcontinent.

A member of the Church of the Nazarene, his \"magnum opus\" was the three volume systematic theology \"Christian Theology\".\n\nHenry Orton Wiley was born in Marquette, Nebraska on 11 November 1877. The Wiley family moved to California in April 1886, then to Oregon in 1893. H. Orton Wiley graduated from Medford High School in Oregon on May 31, 1895. In his last year of high school, Wiley was employed at a local drugstore and began the study of Pharmacy and was awarded his certificate of Pharmacy by the Oregon State Board of Pharmaceutics on March 9, 1897. He later received a diploma in Pharmacy in 1897 from the National Institute of Pharmacy in Chicago, Illinois. Wiley converted to Christianity in 1895. Wiley met his wife, Alice, while working at his father's store. They were married in 1902. Wiley decided to further his education and earned his Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of the Pacific in 1910 and also a Bachelor of Divinity from Pacific Theological Seminary the same year.\n\nIn 1910, Wiley was elected dean of the Pacific Bible College under President Phineas F. Bresee. Wiley was asked by President Phineas F. Bresee to write the first catalogue for the college. In it, Wiley defended the role of the Christian liberal arts college, emphasizing its roles as a cultural custodian and promoter of spiritual intensity.\n\nLater, Wiley would himself become president of Nazarene University in 1913, but leave in 1916 to become president of the Idaho-Oregon Holiness School, which would be renamed Northwest Nazarene College under Wiley's leadership. He would leave Idaho to become president in California again in 1927 until leaving again in 1928, and was president at Pasadena one more time from 1933 to 1949.\n\nUpon arriving at the Idaho-Oregon Holiness School, Wiley was offered a notable ten-year contract as president, during which he published the first \"Oasis\" yearbook and \"Nazarene Messenger\", wrote a standard three-volume theological statement of the Church of the Nazarene. He “guided the school between Scylla of emotionalism and the Charybdis of formalism.” His leadership pushed the upstart institution to become a liberal arts school, a dream represented through changing the school’s name to Northwest Nazarene College.\n\nIn his book \"Introduction to christian theology\", Wiley argues for the Arminian views of unlimited atonement, conditional election and prevenient grace in opposition to the main points of Calvinism and also the Penal substitution theory. In \"Christian theology,\" he stresses that the prevenient grace, operates in a continuous way from \"the first dawn of the moral life\". This would allow a synergistic co-operation with the human will, that doesn't undermine the responsibility and the total depravity of man. Wayne Grudem considers this work to be the best Arminian systematic theology from the twentieth century, but not reaching to the level of John Miley’s. \n\nOrton died of cancer in his residence in Pasadena the 22nd August 1961. The H. Orton Wiley House is listed on the National Register of Historic Places in part for its association with Wiley.\n\n\n\n"}

Distributed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the film was directed by Alexander Mackendrick and is based on the 1959 novel \"Muscle Beach\", by Ira Wallach, who also wrote the screenplay.\n\nThe film depicts a series of romantic triangles between different groupings of the principal cast and supporting players among several backdrops involving Southern California culture (swimming pools, bodybuilding, beach life, fantastic real estate, mudslides, metaphysical gurus, etc.).\n\nCarlo Cofield, a tourist visiting California's west coast, has not even arranged lodging when his car is smashed by a reckless driver. She is carefree, attractive Italian artist Laura Califatti, who offers her couch for him to sleep that night.\n\nThis displeases Rod Prescott, a wealthy swimming-pool builder, because Laura is his mistress. After being kicked out, Carlo tries to sleep on the beach and nearly drowns. He is rescued by mouth-to-mouth resuscitation from a gorgeous surfer who goes by the name \"Malibu.\"\n\nCarlo begins a romantic pursuit of the much-younger woman. After renting a house near the ocean, Carlo cons a sweet but naive bodybuilder, Harry, who is Malibu's boyfriend, that having sex is harmful to his body. He also bribes a phony psychic, \"Madame Lavinia,\" who is actually a man, to discourage Harry from seeing Malibu anymore.\n\nRod decides to give the persistent Carlo a job as a pool salesman. The affair with Laura is discovered by Rod's wife, Diane, who demands a divorce. As a quarrel develops with everyone present, a mudslide caused by a sudden storm makes Carlo's house slide down a cliff. By the time everyone is saved, they pair off with the romantic partners they deserve.\n\nSharon Tate told her husband Roman Polanski that her experience working on this film was not particularly enjoyable. The production atmosphere was tense, and it was worsened when an uncredited stuntman drowned when he parachuted into the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe film was Tate's third to be produced, but as it was the first to be released in cinemas, it is generally considered to be her debut. MGM mounted an extensive publicity campaign upon its release that was based largely on Tate and her character, Malibu, and life-sized cardboard cutouts of Tate wearing a bikini were placed in cinema foyers throughout the United States. It was also linked to a widespread advertising campaign by \"Coppertone\" which also featured Tate.\n\nDave Draper, who plays Malibu's boyfriend Harry, was the 1965 IFBB Mr. America and the 1966 NABBA Mr. Universe.\n\n1966 NABBA Mr. Universe bodybuilder Chester Yorton, who plays Ted Gunder, made one other film, 1964's \"Muscle Beach Party\", in which he plays the character called \"Hulk.\"\n\nThe score was composed by Vic Mizzy. Roger McGuinn and Chris Hillman wrote the title song, \"Don't Make Waves,\" performed by The Byrds over the opening credits.\n\nUpon its release on June 20, 1967, \"Don't Make Waves\" received generally mixed reviews. By the time the film was released, the popularity of beach films and films that related to California beach culture had begun to wane as had the popularity of Tony Curtis as a matinee idol. In \"American Prince\", his 2009 autobiography, Tony Curtis wrote of making \"Don't Make Waves\", \"The plot was utterly ridiculous, but I agreed to appear in the film because I got a percentage of the gross.\" The film would go on to earn $1.25 million at the box office.\n\n\"Don't Make Waves\" has more recently received a positive review by film critic Leonard Maltin who describes it as \"a gem\", and makes note of the \"good direction, funny performance by Sharon Tate and a catchy title song...\".\n\n\"Don't Make Waves\" was released to DVD by Warner Home Video's Warner Archive on June 27, 2011 as a burn-on-demand Region 1 widescreen DVD.\n\n\n"}

The community population at the 2011 census was 874. \n\nAs its name suggests, the local parish church, now in heavily restored simple Perpendicular style, is dedicated to Saint Peter situated close to the River Ely (). In the conservation area, the oldest structure is what remains of Peterston Castle built by the Norman lords of the manor, Le Sor family, probably in the mid-13th century and replacing an earlier structure which had been destroyed by the Welsh and again by Owain Glyndŵr in 1403. Despite being a scheduled monument, the castle remains have been progressively destroyed by housing development.\n\nThe earliest feature of St. Peter’s Church is the 14th-century chancel arch but the church is more notable for its Perpendicular style tower. The west tower with its corbelled battlements and gargoyles is 15th century. The chancel was mostly rebuilt in 1890-91 by Kempson & Fowler. From the medieval period until the 19th century, the settlement was a small rural community with the majority of its inhabitants deriving an income from agriculture. Major change arrived with the construction of the railway (opened 1850) and the opening of a railway station west of the village in the second half of the 19th century. A comparison of the pre-railway Tithe Map of c. 1840 with the First Edition Ordnance Survey of c.1880 shows that the railway required a slight re-alignment of the through road giving rise to the unusual alignment of properties south of the railway bridge. The train station closed in 1971 and demolished. During the immediate post-railway period a school was built south of the church.\n\nThe Old Rectory was built in 1857 and the chancel of St. Peter’s Church was largely reconstructed. It has been suggested that the higher roots of the older yews in the churchyard indicate that the churchyard was cleared in the 19th century. In the early 20th century John and Reginald Cory, coal magnates, began a Garden Village to the south of, and quite separate from, the historic village, now known as Wyndham Park. Main Avenue was, and remains, a wide and straight spine road uphill from a bridge over the river. The road originally crossed the river on the site of today’s footbridge but is now re-directed westwards along Wyndham Park Way. The former mill is now a private residence. The church’s lynch gate is dedicated to those who fell in the Great War. The cost of the playing fields was deferred by grateful parishioners following the 1939-1945 War.\n\nFurther housing development took place in the late 20th century adding to the settlement’s population and thereby helping the village to continue to support a village shop and school. The Peterston Church in Wales Primary School has about 180 pupils.\n\nEntering the village from the east, the village primary school is on the right; the \"Three Horse Shoes\" pub is on the left. Past the pub, is the village shop and post office, the local BT telephone exchange, the church and the railway bridge over the South Wales Main Line from to and . \"The Sportsmans Rest\", a freehold pub, is on the right.\n\nIn 2009, the church was an outdoor and indoor filming location for the third series of \"Gavin & Stacey\". Local residents were used as extras.\n\nThe memorial park is opposite the church. The playing fields are used by the Peterston Juniors Football Club and the local tennis club. The tennis club contains three modern all-weather courts and youth community coaching is available. A community playground was erected in 1975 and upgraded to modern standards in 2013 by local residents through fundraising. In 2019, the tennis courts at the south-western end of the playing fields were converted to a multi-use-games area, created for the use by local sports clubs and for residents alike. This is managed by the Peterston Sports and Social Club. Peterston-super-Ely is an outdoor filming location for the Welsh language soap opera, \"Pobol y Cwm\". \n\nThe Peterston-super-Ely Community Council is elected by the community. As of 2017, the council comprises eight Independent councillors with no political affiliation. Four of these have been co-opted onto the council.\n\nPeterston-Super-Ely is included in a Peterson-super-Ely electoral ward with a representative on the Vale of Glamorgan Council. The local county councillor is Michael Morgan.\n\nThe Member of parliament (MP) is Alun Cairns, the Secretary of State for Wales since 19 March 2016.\n\n\n\n"}

With her three brothers she spent her childhood in France. Their holidays were spent alternately at the Villa Pianore in Lucca with their paternal grandmother the Dowager Duchess of Parma, or at Bernstorff Palace in Copenhagen with their maternal grandfather. In 1939 her family fled from the Nazis and escaped to Spain. From there they went on to Portugal and then to the United States. She attended the Parsons School of Design in New York City from 1940 to 1943. She also worked as a sales assistant at Macy's department store. In 1943, she volunteered for military service in the French Army. She served in Algeria, Morocco, Italy, Luxembourg and in liberated Germany, as an ambulance driver. Anne received the French \"Croix de guerre\" for her wartime service.\n\nIn November 1947, Anne met King Michael I of Romania who was visiting London for the wedding of Princess Elizabeth and Philip Mountbatten. In fact, a year previously Queen Mother Elena had invited Anne, her mother, and brothers for a visit to Bucharest, but the plan did not come off. Meanwhile, Michael had glimpsed Anne in a newsreel and requested a photograph from the film footage.\n\nShe did not want to accompany her parents to London for the royal wedding as she wished to avoid meeting King Michael in official surroundings. Instead, she planned to stay behind, go alone to the Paris railway station and, pretending to be a passerby in the crowd, privately observe the king as his entourage escorted him to his London-bound train. However, at the last moment she was persuaded by her first cousin, Prince Jean of Luxembourg, to come to London, where he planned to host a party. Upon arrival in London, she stopped by Claridge's to see her parents, and found herself being introduced unexpectedly to King Michael. Abashed to the point of confusion, she clicked her heels instead of curtseying, and fled in embarrassment. Charmed, the king saw her again the night of the wedding at the Luxembourg embassy \"soirée\", confided in her some of his concerns about the Communist takeover of Romania and fears for his mother's safety, and nicknamed her \"Nan\". They saw each other several times thereafter on outings in London, always chaperoned by her mother or brother.\n\nA few days later, she accepted an invitation to accompany Michael and his mother when he piloted a Beechcraft aeroplane to take his aunt Princess Irene, Duchess of Aosta, back home to Lausanne. Sixteen days after meeting, Michael proposed to Anne while the couple were out on a drive in Lausanne. She initially declined, but later accepted after taking long walks and drives with him. Although Michael gave her an engagement ring a few days later, he felt obliged to refrain from a public announcement until he informed his government, despite the fact that the press besieged them in anticipation.\n\nMichael returned to Romania, where he was told by the prime minister that a wedding announcement was not \"opportune\". Yet within days it was used as the government's public explanation for Michael's sudden \"abdication\", when in fact the king was deposed by the Communists on 30 December. Anne was unable to get further news of Michael until he left the country. They finally reunited in Davos on 23 January 1948.\n\nAs a Bourbon, Anne was bound by the canon law of the Roman Catholic Church, which required that she receive a dispensation to marry a non-Catholic Christian (Michael was Orthodox). At the time, such a dispensation was normally only given if the non-Roman Catholic partner promised to allow the children of the marriage to be raised as Roman Catholics. Michael refused to make this promise since it would have violated Romania's monarchical constitution, and would be likely to have a detrimental impact upon any possible restoration. The Holy See (which handled the matter directly since Michael was a member of a reigning dynasty) refused to grant the dispensation unless Michael made the required promise.\n\nHelen, Queen Mother of Romania and her sister Princess Irene of Greece and Denmark, Duchess of Aosta (an Orthodox married to a Catholic Prince) met with the fiancée's parents in Paris, where the two families resolved to take their case to the Vatican in person. In early March, the couple's mothers met with Pope Pius XII who, despite the entreaties of the Queen Mother and the fact that Princess Margrethe pounded her fist on the table in anger, refused permission for Anne to marry Michael.\n\nIt has been surmised that the Pope's refusal was, in part, motivated by the fact that when Princess Giovanna of Italy married Anne's cousin, King Boris III of Bulgaria, in 1930, the couple had undertaken to raise their future children as Roman Catholics, but had baptized them in the Orthodox faith in deference to Bulgaria's state religion. However, Michael declined to make a promise he could not keep politically, while Anne's mother was herself the daughter of a mixed marriage between a Catholic (Marie d'Orléans) and a Protestant (Prince Valdemar of Denmark), who had abided by their pre-ne temere compromise to raise their sons as Protestant and their daughter, Margrethe, as Catholic.\n\nAlthough under a great deal of stress, the engaged couple resolved to proceed. Anne's paternal uncle, Xavier, Duke of Parma, issued a statement objecting to any marriage conducted against the will of the Pope and the bride's family. It was he, not the Pontiff, who forbade Anne's parents to attend the wedding. Michael's spokesman declared on 9 June that the parents had been asked and had given their consent, and that the bride's family would be represented at the nuptials by her maternal uncle, the Protestant Prince Erik of Denmark, who was to give the bride away.\n\nThe wedding ceremony was held on 10 June 1948 in Athens, Greece, in the throne room of the Royal Palace; the ceremony was performed by Archbishop Damaskinos, and King Paul of Greece served as \"koumbaros\". Guests at the wedding included: Michael's mother Helen, Queen Mother of Romania, aunts Queen Frederica, Princess Irene of Greece and Denmark, Duchess of Aosta, Princess Katherine of Greece and Denmark; cousins Alexandra, Queen Consort of Yugoslavia, Prince Amedeo, Duke of Aosta, Princess Sophia of Greece and Denmark, Crown Prince Constantine of Greece and Princess Irene of Greece and Denmark, the three youngest ones serving as bridesmaids and pageboy; Anne's maternal uncle Prince Erik of Denmark; Princess Nicholas of Greece and Denmark, Princess Olga of Yugoslavia, Princess Elizabeth of Yugoslavia, Prince George William of Hanover and many other dignitaries. Michael's father, Prince Carol, and his sisters, Maria, Queen Mother of Yugoslavia, Princess Elisabeth of Romania (ex-Queen Consort of Greece) and Princess Ileana of Romania were notified, but not invited.\n\nAs no papal dispensation was given for the marriage, when it was celebrated according to the rites of the Eastern Orthodox Church, it was deemed invalid by the Roman Catholic Church, but perfectly legal by every other authority. The couple eventually took part in a religious ceremony again, on 9 November 1966, at the Roman Catholic Church of St Charles in Monaco, thus satisfying Roman Catholic canon law.\n\nAfter their wedding in 1948, Anne and Michael rented a house in Hertfordshire for four years, where they became market gardeners and farmed poultry. In 1956 they moved to Versoix on Lake Geneva, and raised five daughters there. In 1992 Anne and Michael visited Romania for three days; it was Anne's first visit to the country. From 1993 to 1997, despite repeated attempts, Michael was refused entry to Romania by the hostile Romanian government. During these years Anne visited the country a number of times representing her husband. After 1997, there were no restrictions on Anne and Michael's entry into Romania. Elisabeta Palace was put at their disposal by the government, and they recovered some properties from the state, including Săvârşin Castle and Peleş Castle.\n\nIn June 2008, Anne and Michael celebrated their diamond wedding anniversary with three days of events in Romania, which was the largest celebration the couple ever had since their wedding in June 1948.\n\n\nGuests at the events included: their two eldest daughters Crown Princess Margareta and Princess Elena, their sons-in-law Prince Radu and Alexander Nixon and Princess Elena's two children: Prince Nicholas and Elisabeta-Karina; Michael's maternal cousins ex-King Constantine II of Greece, Queen Sofia of Spain, Prince Amedeo, Duke of Aosta and Princess Irene of Greece and Denmark who were the original attendants at their wedding in 1948; Queen Anne-Marie of Greece, King Simeon II of Bulgaria and his wife Queen Margarita, Crown Prince Alexander of Yugoslavia and his wife Crown Princess Katherine, Duarte Pio, Duke of Braganza, Maximilian, Margrave of Baden and his wife Archduchess Valerie, Prince Lorenz of Belgium, Archduke of Austria-Este, Princess Silvia, Duchess of Aosta, Princess Marie Astrid of Luxembourg, Prince Philip of Bourbon-Parma and his wife Princess Anette. Attendees also included Representatives of Romania and of the Romanian Government, such as: Prime Minister Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu, Bogdan Olteanu, President of the Chamber of Deputies, Ionel Haiduc, President of the Romanian Academy, Patriarch Daniel and also members of the Diplomatic corps.\n\n Anne and King Michael had five daughters, all of whom have been married and three of whom have children:\n\n\nAnne was the younger sister of Prince Jacques of Bourbon-Parma and elder sister to Prince Michel of Bourbon-Parma who is married to Princess Maria Pia of Savoy (eldest child of King Umberto II of Italy and Queen Marie José), and Prince André of Bourbon-Parma.\n\nAs a granddaughter of Robert I, Duke of Parma she was first cousin to: King Boris III of Bulgaria; Robert Hugo, Duke of Parma; Infanta Alicia, Duchess of Calabria; Carlos Hugo, Duke of Parma; Crown Prince Otto of Austria; and Grand Duke Jean of Luxembourg.\n\nAnne died on 1 August 2016 in a hospital in Morges, Switzerland, at the age of 92. Although the offer to confer a posthumous military medal on her was declined by her family, Romania's President Klaus Iohannis offered condolences to King Michael and the royal family, issuing a statement which described the deceased as devoted to the country whose name she bore, \"Her Majesty Queen Ana of Romania will remain forever in memory and in our hearts as one of the most important symbols of wisdom, dignity and, especially, as a model of moral conduct.\". The government of Romania declared that the 13 August 2016 shall be a national day of mourning, during which the Romanian flag when displayed is to fly at half-mast at all institutions and buildings, private, cultural and partisan as well as public, and television and radio broadcasts are to adapt their programming appropriately in memory of Anne of Romania, whose funeral will be conducted that day at the Curtea de Argeș Cathedral. Two days later, on 5 August, President Nicolae Timofti of Moldova likewise decreed national mourning on 13 August in memory of Queen Anne, also calling for the republic to observe a moment of silence at 10 am on that day.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

She has been both an enemy to and a member of the Teen Titans, and she is the daughter of Deathstroke. Rose Wilson first appeared in \"Deathstroke\" #15 and was created by Marv Wolfman and Art Nichols.\n\nShe makes her live adaptation debut in the second season of the DC Universe series \"Titans\", played by Chelsea Zhang.\n\nSlade Wilson (Deathstroke) meets a Hmong woman named Lillian Wilson (born: Lillian Worth) on a search-and-rescue mission a few years after his divorce from Adeline Kane. His mission is to make sure that she escapes war-torn Cambodia safely. After an intermittent love affair with Wilson, Worth gives birth to a daughter whom she names Rose. Believing it to be in the child's best interest, Worth keeps Rose a secret from Wilson. Worth eventually settles down at a brothel in New York City, and, during a time when Deathstroke is injured and a fugitive from the law, Worth takes him in and nurses his wounds. Wintergreen (Deathstroke's butler) discovers 14-year-old Rose and suspects that she is Deathstroke's daughter.\n\nWhen Ravager (Wade DeFarge – Deathstroke's half-brother) kills Deathstroke's friends and family, Ravager discovers Rose, captures her, and tells her that Deathstroke is her father. Wintergreen and Worth launch a rescue attempt, but Worth is presumed dead after she drives a Jeep off a cliff while trying to run over DeFarge. Wintergreen successfully rescues Rose and escapes.\n\nRose tries to reach out to her father, but he turns her away. He fears for her safety because he believes himself to be responsible for the deaths of two of his sons. Deathstroke leaves her in the care of the Teen Titans superhero team. During a training exercise, Rose is injured and taken to the hospital, and her precognitive powers emerge for the first time when she has a lengthy vision of Deathstroke's future. She awakens before she can test her powers further. She leaves the Titans shortly after and does not see them again until the Technis Imperative conflict, where she allies herself with the Titans to save fellow Titan Cyborg. During this incident, she vocally challenges the New God Big Barda, as the Titans and the Justice League had come to blows. Barda seems more amused than concerned over Rose and their potential fight is neutralized by other forces.\n\nThe Madison family in Chicago adopt Rose, but DeFarge kills her new family. The Ravager claims to have been offered $100,000 for her death by an anonymous source, but neither of them know that Deathstroke hired DeFarge in an attempt to bring Rose closer to him.\n\nDeathstroke anonymously alerts the Titans that Rose's life is in danger, and they fight to defend her. All of the fighters are rendered unconscious by an explosion of halothane gas, and Rose awakens in Deathstroke's lair. He apologizes to Rose for abandoning her and says that she is the only family he has left. Deathstroke suggests that she become his apprentice, offering DeFarge as her first kill. Rose accepts and takes the name “Ravager” for herself. Deathstroke secretly injects Rose with the same serum that gave him his abilities, and it causes her to suffer from psychosis.\n\nDeathstroke doubts Rose's readiness to work with him and plans to disown her after she hesitates and is unable to kill Deathstroke's son Jericho (when he possesses Beast Boy's body). To prove her loyalty, she gouges out an eye to match his missing eye.\nAfter Rose suffers a defeat at the hands of Batgirl, Deathstroke places her under the tutelage of Nightwing after Slade is led to believe he has given up being a hero. Nightwing agrees to train Rose, while surreptitiously teaching her the values of heroism. Although Rose develops a crush on Nightwing as the training progresses, the attraction seemed entirely one-sided. In order to test Grayson's loyalty, Deathstroke replaces Rose's missing eye with one carved from Kryptonite and pits her and Nightwing against Superman. Rose attempts to kill Superman, but Nightwing uses Superman's concern for the safety of not only the civilian bystanders, but Rose herself as her final lesson on altruism. Nightwing agrees to stay away from Rose on the condition that Blüdhaven remained off-limits to the latest incarnation of The Society, of which Deathstroke is a charter member. Following the bombing of Blüdhaven on Deathstroke's orders in \"Infinite Crisis\", Nightwing returns and informs Rose that the Kryptonite Deathstroke had implanted in her eye-socket is not just a danger to Kryptonians, but it is also carcinogenic and is indeed lethal to humans under extended periods of prolonged exposure. Enraged and heartbroken that her father would endanger her life so dismissively, and emboldened by Nightwing's tutelage, Rose breaks all ties with her father and runs away.\n\nOne year after the events depicted in the \"Infinite Crisis\" crossover, Rose once again joins the Teen Titans. She wears the same costume and wields two katana-style swords. With Deathstroke and his serum's influence gone, Rose appears more balanced than previously depicted. Robin admits Rose to the team as a favor to the team founder and ex-leader, her former mentor Nightwing.\n\nRose forms a friendship with Kid Devil, using his flame breath to light her cigarettes. When Kid Devil is injured during a mission, Rose defends him, and on multiple occasions threatens those she deemed a threat to him. She later admits to Kid Devil that she is afraid of being kicked out, should the old members return to the team.\n\nOver the lost year, the Teen Titans came to the conclusion that they needed more members. After discovering that Raven believes there was a traitor on the team during the previous year, the team agrees to begin with her. The team travels the world in search of Raven apparently on the run from the traitor. They also meet several other former Titans, such as Red Star, Zatara, and Bombshell. During a meeting with Bombshell, Rose is accused of being the latest traitor, working for Deathstroke instead. She denies the accusation, supported by not only Kid Devil, but also Wonder Girl, who believes Rose would never go back to her father. Robin and Cyborg agree that Ravager would return to the Tower. Furious, Rose prepares to quit the team altogether until the team's caretakers Wendy and Marvin reveal to her that the traitor had stolen one particular object: the computer disk containing Jericho's essence.\n\nRealizing why Raven is truly on the run, Ravager quickly returns to the Titans' aid, just as the traitor is revealed to be Bombshell. Ravager manages to save Raven, just as the empathic Titan uses the same spell which resurrected her to resurrect Rose's dead and previously insane half-brother Jericho. Upon the resurrection of her elder brother, Joseph and Rose begin fraternizing, unaware that Bombshell's betrayal was orchestrated by Deathstroke, and that their teammates have been subdued by his associates.\n\nLater, Rose and Joseph fly to New York to have lunch with Nightwing, after which they go to the original Titans Island and discover that someone has built a demented version of the original tower there. Upon entering, they find that their father has kidnapped their teammates, all in order to gain control of them again. Rose and Joey then rescue Robin from Slade and Batgirl, during which Rose finally has her rematch with Cassandra Cain. Rose and Joey both attempt to stop their father, but they are defeated and left at his mercy until Nightwing, Donna Troy, Raven, Cyborg, Duela Dent, Beast Boy, and Bart Allen arrive.\n\nFollowing the death of her former-teammate Bart Allen, Rose attends his funeral in \"Countdown #43\" along with the rest of the Teen Titans.\n\nIn \"Teen Titans\" #50, Rose is present for Bart's wake, although she slips off after a while, bored with the somber, reminiscent atmosphere, and invites Kid Devil to join her in skinny-dipping in the Titans' swimming pool.\n\nIn \"Teen Titans\" vol. 3 #51, the Titans Tomorrow—a possible future version of the current Titans team—arrive in the present to aid the Teen Titans against Starro-controlled villains. Ravager's future-self is absent from the group and it is revealed that she betrays the team (primarily Bart Allen and Kid Devil) at some point. Kid Devil, his adult version Red Devil, and Rose are then sent to battle against Rampage & Livewire. Red Devil tries to convince Eddie to let Rose die during the fight, so that she does not manage to betray them in the future. Initially, it appears that Eddie intends to do so, before betraying his older self in order to aid Rose. Later, the trio return to the Titans Lair (home of the original Teen Titans), where they meet with Blue Beetle. There, Red Devil attacks Blue Beetle, claiming that he too cannot be trusted.\n\nEddie, Rose, and Jaime find themselves surrounded by an army of Titans led by Lex Luthor before they all battle against an invading army of Starros. Thanks in large part to Blue Beetle's powers and Robin and Wonder Girl managing to supposedly alter Robin's future (and thus alter the future of the Titans as a whole), the army of Titans is apparently defeated.\n\nIn \"Teen Titans\" #57, Rose is attacked by Persuader, Copperhead, and Dreadbolt of the Terror Titans, who had managed to infiltrate Titans Tower. During the battle, they goad Rose about the fate of Kid Devil, whom they had earlier captured. Despite overwhelming numbers, they are unable to take down Rose. Rose ruptures a gas line with her energy swords, blowing up a section of the tower. Rose is revealed to have survived the explosion by crossing the swords, creating a forcefield. She then follows the Terror Titans back to their base, saving Wonder Girl from Disruptor and Persuader. She then battles Clock King, her own precognitive powers matching him. Clock King offers Rose a place on his team, but she refuses. Clock King then ejects the Titans from his base. Back at the tower, Rose overhears Robin and Wonder Girl talking about her almost killing Persuader during battle, and deciding there will be \"repercussions\". Rose decides to leave the Titans, using one of Clock King's teleportation devices to do it.\n\nIn \"Terror Titans\" #1, Ravager is seen talking with Clock King, negotiating her role within his group. She agrees to take part in one of The Dark Side Club's arena battles, fighting against Fever. Rose defeats Fever, but when given the order to finish her, refuses, prompting Clock King to have Fever shot in the head. Although appalled by Fever's death, Rose stays, hoping to find out what Clock King's plan is. Continuing to fight in the tournament, Rose faces off against Static, and is almost killed. Rose eventually discover that Clock King intends to use the mind-controlled teen heroes as his own \"Martyr Militia\" to destroy Los Angeles, entirely for his own amusement. Attempting to get help, Rose is attacked by the Terror Titans, who overwhelm her. Help comes in the form of Miss Martian, who had been posing as one of the brainwashed teens, and had managed to use her telepathy to free them. Ravager follows the retreating villains back to their base, where she confronts Clock King. Despite their equal precognitive abilities, Ravager is able to defeat him, although she was unable to prevent his escape.\n\nRavager returns during the \"Teen Titans/Titans/Vigilante\" crossover \"Deathtrap\", seeking to save Jericho, who had been targeted by Vigilante. However, the unbalanced Jericho refuses her offer of help, continuing in his plot to kill the Titans, forcing Rose to team up with the heroes to stop him. It is also apparent that she has become addicted to the adrenaline given to her by the Clock King.\n\nFollowing the \"Deathtrap\" storyline, Rose briefly tries her hand at being a part of the Titans, but finds that she does not belong with them. After an altercation with Bombshell, staged to ensure her loyalty to the team, Rose leaves to find her own way in life. From Teen Titans #72 onwards, Ravager is featured in a 10-page, 9 part co-feature, Ravager: Fresh Hell, written by Sean McKeever and drawn by Yildiray Cinar.\n\nIn the \"Teen Titans\" tie-in to the \"Blackest Night\" crossover, Rose tracks Deathstroke down to his old mentor Wintergreen's house and attacks him. During the fight, the two are attacked by their deceased relatives Grant, Wade and Adeline, who, along with Wintergreen, have all been reanimated as Black Lanterns. When Grant attacks Deathstroke, intending to burn him in a fireplace, Rose reluctantly intervenes, saving her hated father. She then attempts to incinerate Wade, but is surprised when Jericho jumps out of his body. Jericho, whose eyes had grown back since Vigilante's attack, uses his powers to make the Black Lanterns destroy themselves. After the battle, Rose refuses to reconcile with Deathstroke, despite acknowledging her daughterly love for him. She also realises that her mother may still be alive, as she was not among the attacking Black Lanterns.\n\nFollowing an adventure in another dimension, Static, Miss Martian, Bombshell, and Aquagirl leave the Titans, and Rose is invited to rejoin the team in order to help build it back up. While staying in the Tower, Rose hacks into the team computer and begins searching for information on her mother. During her time with the group, Rose begins flirting with Superboy, and befriends Damian Wayne, the new Robin. She remains with the team up until the final battle with Superboy-Prime and the Legion of Doom, where she teams with Speedy to take down Persuader, one of her former teammates on the Terror Titans. She and Damian also help turn the tide of the battle by using a piece of Kryptonite to destroy several evil clones of Superboy.\n\nFollowing the events of \"Flashpoint\", the DC Universe was relaunched. In the New 52, Rose now has both eyes intact and does not go by the name Ravager, though she still appears to have her martial arts training and trademark swords. She is a teenaged mercenary hired by the shadowy organization N.O.W.H.E.R.E. to act as a handler for Superboy after he destroyed the N.O.W.H.E.R.E. lab used to create him in self-defense. Rose has a rivalry with Caitlin Fairchild, a young N.O.W.H.E.R.E. researcher who cares for Superboy. Her origin is altered so that she is now the daughter of Slade Wilson and his wife Adeline Kane, removing her Asian heritage in the process.\n\nAfter last seen by the side of her father Deathstroke, following the events that happened in The Ravagers, she reappears in a possible future 20 years distant. In this timeline she is along her husband Garfield Logan, now labeled as Beast Man, living together in the Justice League Watchtower as Beast Man is the only Justice Leaguer alive. The two also have a daughter named Red who is being mentored by them along other superpowered teenagers in order for them to become a team. After an encounter with three members of the Teen Titans from the present Red Robin, Wonder Girl and Superboy, Rose and Gar put in action a plan to swap Superboy (Kon-El) with the man of whom he is a clone (Jon Lane Kent, son of Superman and Lois Lane), who is responsible for the tragedy that happened in that future, in order to prevent those events from happening again. The plan is a success as Raven's soul-self departs with the Titans from the present and the unconscious Jon Lane, not Conner. Once alone, Rose asks Gar if they really did the right thing, which Gar responds: \"I damn well hope so Rose. I damn well hope so\".\n\nRose later reappears after the DC Rebirth relaunch, with her original Cambodian origin and mixed-race heritage now restored. She is seen working as a strip club bouncer who moonlights as a teenage mercenary, and reunites with her father after someone puts a hit on her. Her past in the New 52 continuity also appears to be retconned, as she makes no mention of N.O.W.H.E.R.E., and claims to have been trained by Nightwing, much to Slade's chagrin.\n\nInjected with the same serum that enhanced her father Deathstroke, Rose has increased reflexes, stamina, and strength, but is also prone to psychotic episodes, such as when she gouged out her own eye to be more like her father. She has received some training from Nightwing, including the virtues of being a hero. She also possesses a precognitive sense that lets her see into the immediate future. This allows her to react to oncoming attacks against her and to counter them accordingly.\n\nShe currently wields twin energy katanas that can cut through anything except flesh, and briefly \"merge\" into an energy shield. She also carries with her a small stash of adrenaline, both because Clock King had briefly managed to make her addicted to the substance, and also because while high on adrenaline her precognitive sense evolves into the ability to glimpse scenes from her immediate future. However, the more she uses adrenaline to enhance her powers, the more her metabolism is unbalanced, straining her health.\n\nIn September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, the source of Rose's powers are metagenes. She can dampen another person's powers and abilities such as weakening invulnerability and do damage to people such as Superboy or Mister Majestic.\nShe also has psionic powers, that make her immune to Jericho's possession abilities and Superboy's telekinesis. These facilities also psychically link her to other Gen-Actives, enabling multi-way mental communication with people enhanced by the Gen Factor. The limits of these powers are still unknown. \n\nIn Rebirth publishing, Ravager reacquires her old superhuman skill set prior to Flashpoint. The only difference being she now derives her abilities from the hereditary metagene begotten from her father, which became active due to prolonged exposure to Mr. Wilson's sword; The Deathstroke.\nRetaining the enhanced conditional practices of superhuman strength, durability, agility, healing, etc. She also had been bestowed a unique variation of the enhanced mind her father possessed; beyond the simple augmented brain percentage giving Deathstroke his genius intellect, rose has an accelerated probability factor wherein she can predict the future via cataloging and assembling details in a highly accurate outcome assessment.\n\nWhile Rose never appeared in the \"Teen Titans\" animated series, she appeared as the antagonist in an issue of the tie-in comic, Teen Titans Go! issue #49. As Ravager, she returns to Jump City, hoping to claim \"what is rightfully hers\". Ravager finds and attacks Wintergreen and Professor Chang, both of whom had something which belonged to her father. After blowing up Chang's robot factory, she goes on a rampage in Jump City, determined to carry on her father's legacy by defeating the Teen Titans once and for all. After a duel with Robin, the Titans help her understand that she does not have to carry on her father's legacy and offer her a home and a family while convincing her that she is free to make her own decisions in life. Touched by the Titans' words of friendship, she decides to frequently train (but not officially join) with them until she is ready to face her future as a better person.\n\nIn the \"Titans Tomorrow\" storyline, the Teen Titans are thrown back in time after teaming up with the Legion of Super-Heroes, only to arrive ten years into their own future. They discover that as adults, they are evil authoritarian dictators. However, a Titans East team has been formed to stop them. Rose Wilson is a member of the Titans East and is in love with Bart Allen, then the Flash, who is spying on the evil Titans. Rose and the Flash help the Teen Titans to return home.\n\nThe concept is revisited in \"Teen Titans\" vol. 3, where it revealed that the future has changed somewhat. Future Bart Allen is now just as unscrupulous as his teammates, and Rose's counterpart is dead. There exists no Titans East/Titans West division, as all belong to a greatly expanded teammates Titans Army.\n\nRose appears in \"Tiny Titans\", although she does not go by Ravager. She wears an eye patch on her right eye and had an undamaged eye underneath. It is not mentioned whether the patch was worn to improve her sight.\n\nIn the alternate timeline of the \"Flashpoint\" event, Rose Wilson was kidnapped by persons unknown, where her father Deathstroke, a pirate, is searching for her. Deathstroke and his shipmate Jenny Blitz located Rose, who was being held captive on the Caretaker's fleet. Deathstroke formulated a plan, while he and Jenny battled Caretaker's crew and manages to save Rose. After battling Caretaker's fleet, Rose rescued Deathstroke and Jenny from drowning, and is then reunited with her father and sailing towards an unknown destination.\n\nRose Wilson appears as Ravager in \"Smallville season 11\", based on the show by Bryan Q. Miller. She attempts to continue her father's work (Slade in this continuity having been a general with an obsession with stopping superpowered vigilantes, until he was left catatonic after Clark put him into the Phantom Zone), by taking out 'the next generation' of superheroes. Her Ravager gear seems to be heavily modeled after what Deathstroke wore in the second season of \"Arrow\".\n\nRavager appears in the \"DC Bombshells\" continuity as a member of the Coven along with Barbara Gordon and the Enchantress. This version is a prophetic pirate and uses her abilities to predict the moves of her opponents and to warn her comrades not to stray from the Belle Reeve Manor. While Killer Croc is specific on why Batgirl and Enchantress are at the bayou Manor, he just claims that Ravager \"did something bad\". After Francine Charles proves Ravager's prophecy on never leaving Belle Reeve to be false, the Coven, Charles, and Killer Croc, form Amanda Waller's Suicide Squad.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1844926", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1844926", "title": "Kapuas River", "text": "Kapuas River\n\nThe Kapuas River (or Kapoeas River) is a river in the Indonesian part of Borneo island, at the geographic center of Maritime Southeast Asia. At in length, it is the longest river of Indonesia and one of the world's longest island rivers. It originates in the Müller mountain range at the center of the island and flows west into the South China Sea creating an extended marshy delta. The delta is located west-southwest of Pontianak, the capital of the West Kalimantan province. This Kapuas River should be distinguished from another Kapuas River, which starts on the other side of the same mountain range in central Borneo, but flows to the south, merging with the Barito River and discharging into the Java Sea.\n\nThe river is long and up to wide at its delta; with a total area of , the river basin covers more than 67% of West Kalimantan. The discharge rate varies through the year, averaging around at the delta and upstream, at the confluence of the Tawang River. The discharge peaks during the rainy seasons in April and November, during which the water level may rise by overnight, overflowing river banks and flooding the nearby areas.\n\nThe river originates near the center of Borneo, south from the Indonesian-Malaysian border, in the joint between the western slope of the Müller Mountain Range, which runs through the island center, and the southern slope of the Upper Kapuas Range (), which is located more to the west. For about it flows through a mountainous terrain and then descends to a marshy plain. There, the elevation decreases by only over from Putussibau to the river delta. About from the source, near the northern shore of the river, lies a system of Kapuas Lakes which are connected to the river by numerous channels. These lakes are Bekuan (area 1,268 hectares), Belida (600 ha), Genali (2,000 ha), Keleka Tangai (756 ha), Luar (5,208 ha), Pengembung (1,548 ha), Sambor (673 ha), Sekawi (672 ha), Sentarum (2,324 ha), Sependan (604 ha), Seriang (1,412) Sumbai (800 ha), Sumpa (664) and Tekenang (1,564 ha). When the monthly precipitation exceeds about , the river overflows its banks, diverting much of its waters to the lakes at a rate of up to , and forming a single volume of water with them. This outflow prevents massive flooding of the lower reaches of the river; it also promotes fish migration from the river to the lakes for spawning, but drives birds away from the lakes.\n\nThe river discharges into the South China Sea creating a marshy delta, which spreads both inland and into the sea, with the silt deposits extending up to from the Borneo coast. The delta is located west-southwest of Pontianak, the capital of West Kalimantan province, which lies at the equator. The delta has five arms, of which the northernmost one is the widest, and is therefore called the Big Kapuas (). The largest tributary is the Melawi River, which occurs to the left near the city of Sintang, about 465 km from the mouth. Other major tributaries are the Landak, Kubu, Punggur and Sekayam rivers.\n\nThe climate is warm and very humid, with the average annual precipitation ranging from year to year between , and the number of rainy days between 120 and 309; the largest precipitation was observed in 1976 (120 rainy days) and the wettest in 1988, with only 184 rainy days. The temperature is rather stable with a typical minimum of and maximum of through the whole year.\n\nIn the upper and middle reaches, the river flows through dense tropical forests; the rich flora and fauna are the subject of international research. Discoveries of new species are frequent, such as of the Kapuas mud snake (\"Enhydris gyii\"), which was discovered in 2003–2005 by German and American herpetologists. This species is remarkable in that it can spontaneously change its skin color, similar to the chameleon.\n\nOtters and crocodiles are common in the Kapuas River, but frogs are nearly absent. Agile gibbons (\"Hylobates agilis\"), Müller's Bornean gibbons (\"Hylobates muelleri\"), Prevost's squirrels (\"Callosciurus prevostii\") and treeshrews inhabit the trees above the river.\n\nThere are two national parks on the river banks, Betung Kerihun with an area of 8,000 km and Danau Sentarum (area 1,320 km), the latter includes the Kapuas Lakes.\n\nAbout 300 species of fish have been identified in the river basin, of which 234 are of high economical value. This is more fish species than any other river basin in Indonesia. They belong to 120 genera and 40 families with the two major groups being cyprinids and catfish. More than 30% of the species originate from the sea and inhabit the delta areas. Among the economically important species are food fish such as \"Pangasius\" catfish, giant gourami, kissing gourami, snakeheads and large barbs (\"Leptobarbus\", \"Puntioplites\", \"Tor\" and others), and species from the aquarium trade such as the super red arowana and rasboras. Because of overfishing and habitat degradation, several species are threatened. Among these are the endangered arowana and white-edge freshwater whipray, and the wallago catfish, which formerly migrated in large groups in the Kapuas River.\n\nPart of the high species diversity in the Kapuas is related to the many different habitats in the river basin. In the headwaters are fast-flowing highland streams, typically dominated by small loaches, and small —often acidic (blackwater)— forest streams and peat swamps with species such as the tiny \"Sundadanio\" rasboras and macropodusine gouramis. The main river itself also includes several habitats, ranging from the nearshore to open waters. In the deepest sections, no light exists and in one species, \"Lepidocephalus spectrum\", this has resulted in a complete reduction of both eyes and pigmentation (similar to cavefish).\nOwing to the warm climate and abundance of food, most fishes breed all through the year with only a few species like fire eel (\"Mastacembelus erythrotaenia\") having certain reproduction periods. The number of individuals per species is relatively low. The large variety of species may be explained by the fact that some 6,000 years ago, the Kapuas River, as a tributary of the Sunda River, was connected to other tributary rivers of South Sumatra, Java and Malay Peninsula. Apart from fish, there are numerous crabs, prawns, water striders and other aquatic insects. The rich flora and fauna results in very complex food chains, with fishes consuming foods ranging from fruits to other fish. For example, \"Hemirhamphodon pogonognathus\" feeds exclusively on terrestrial insects. Abundant fruits and seeds enter the river after falling from large trees which bend over its waters. The feeding habits of the fish in the Kapuas River are distributed as follows: 54% are omnivores; 36% are carnivorous and eat other fish (14%), insects (5%) and mixed small forest animals (17%). The remaining 10% are herbivorous, with 4% of them specialising in algae.\n\nThe Kapuas River is the major waterway connecting the center of the island with its western coast. The large river width and depth (up to 27 meters) support intensive cargo and passenger shipping over most of the river length. Ships with a draft of up to 3 meters can navigate up to Sintang, 465 km from the mouth, and those with a draft up to 2 meters can reach the town of Putussibau (902 km from the mouth). Logging and rafting of timber occur all along the river. Fishing is also common, especially at the Kapuas Lakes and near the river delta. The Tayan Bridge, opened in 2016, crosses over the river and is the longest bridge in Kalimantan.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1844932", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1844932", "title": "Avoidance speech", "text": "Avoidance speech\n\nAvoidance speech is a group of sociolinguistic phenomena in which a special restricted speech style must be used in the presence of or in reference to certain relatives. Avoidance speech is found in many Australian Aboriginal languages and Austronesian languages as well as some North American languages, Highland East Cushitic languages and Bantu languages.\n\nAvoidance speech styles tend to have the same phonology and grammar as the standard language they are a part of. The lexicon, however, tends to be smaller than in normal speech since the styles are only used for limited communication.\n\nAvoidance speech in Australian Aboriginal languages is closely tied to elaborate tribal kinship systems in which certain relatives are considered taboo. Avoidance relations differ from tribe to tribe in terms of strictness and to whom they apply. Typically, there is an avoidance relationship between a man and his mother-in-law, usually between a woman and her father-in-law, and sometimes between any person and their parent-in-law of the same sex. For some tribes, avoidance relationships are extended to other family members, such as the mother-in-law's brother in Warlpiri or cross-cousins in Dyirbal. All relations are classificatory – more people may fall into the \"mother-in-law\" category than just a man's wife's mother.\n\nAvoidance speech styles used with taboo relatives are often called mother-in-law languages, although they are not actually separate languages but separate lexical sets with the same grammar and phonology. Typically, the taboo lexical set has a one-to-many correspondence with the everyday set. For example, in Dyirbal the avoidance style has one word, \"jijan\", for all lizards and iguanas while the everyday style differentiates many varieties. In Guugu Yimidhirr the avoidance speech verb \"bali-l\" \"travel\" covers several everyday verbs meaning \"go\", \"walk\", \"crawl\", \"paddle\", \"float, sail, drift\", and \"limp along\". Corresponding avoidance and everyday words are generally not linguistically related. Avoidance forms tend to be longer than everyday forms.\n\nIn some areas, the avoidance style is used by both members of the avoidance relationship; in others the senior member may talk to the junior in everyday style. Behavior associated with avoidance speech is a continuum and varies between tribes. For the Dyirbal people, a man and his mother-in-law may not make eye contact, face one another or directly talk to each other. Rather, they must address a third person or even a nearby object. For slightly less restricted relationships, such as between a man and his father-in-law, avoidance style is used and must be spoken in a slow, soft voice. An extreme case of avoidance behavior is found in the Umpila, in which a man and his mother-in-law may not speak at all in each other’s presence.\n\nChildren in these cultures acquire avoidance speech forms as part of their normal language development, learning with whom to use them at a fairly young age. Additionally, a few languages have another style, called a \"secret language\" or \"mystic language\", that is taught to boys as part of initiation rituals, and is only used between men.\n\nThere is also the tradition of avoiding reference to the names of people who have died during the mourning period as a mark of respect—and also because it is considered too painful for the grieving family. Today the practice continues in many communities, but has also come to encompass avoiding the publication or dissemination of photography or film footage of the deceased as well. Most forms of media in Australia include a disclaimer warning Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders that the material may contain images and voices of such people who have died. (as recommended by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation).\n\nThe avoidance period may last anywhere from 12 months to several years. The person can still be referred to in a roundabout way, such as, \"that old lady\", or by their generic skin name, but not by first name. In some Central Australian communities, if for example, an individual named Alice dies, that name must be avoided in all contexts. This can even include the township Alice Springs being referred to in conversation in a roundabout way (which is usually fine, as the Indigenous name can be defaulted to). Those of the same name as the deceased are referred to by a substitute name during the avoidance period such as \"Kuminjay\", used in the Pintubi-Luritja dialect, or \"Galyardu\", which appears in a mid-western Australia Wajarri dictionary for this purpose.\n\nA special system of avoidance vocabulary is traditionally used by married women speaking Highland East Cushitic languages in southwestern Ethiopia. In Kambaata and Sidamo, this system is called \"ballishsha\", and includes physical and linguistic avoidance of parents-in-law. Women who practice \"ballishsha\" do not pronounce any words beginning with the same syllable as the name of their husband’s mother or father. Instead, they may use paraphrase, synonyms or semantically similar words, antonyms, or borrowings from other languages.\n\n\"Hlonipha\", or \"isihlonipho\", is a traditional system of avoidance speech in Nguni Bantu languages of southern Africa including Zulu, Xhosa and Swazi. This special speech style and correlating respectful behaviors may be used in many contexts, but is most strongly associated with married women in respect to their father-in-law and other senior male relatives. Women who practice \"hlonipha\" may not say the names of these men or any words with the same root as their names. They avoid the taboo words phonologically (substituting sounds) or lexically (substituting words with synonyms, etc.). The \"hlonipha\" system also includes avoidance of the names of certain relatives by all speakers and physical avoidance of certain relatives.\n\n\n"}

While in the WWE, their ring personas were those of a duo of superheroes.\n\nIn mid-2003, The Hurricane \"discovered\" Rosey and from there on they wrestled together as a team. Two years later, they won the World Tag Team Championship. During that time, The Hurricane and Rosey joined forces with Stacy Keibler, who adopted a superhero ring persona and the name Super Stacy. After losing the World Tag Team title, the team disbanded.\n\nShortly after Rosey's old tag team partner Jamal was released from WWE in 2003, The Hurricane \"discovered\" Rosey's potential as a superhero, and christened him Rosey, the Super Hero in Training (or the S.H.I.T.). Throughout this time, Rosey came to the ring clad in makeshift superhero costumes, with each clearly depicting the S.H.I.T. reference on the front, and skits aired weekly showing Rosey training to be a superhero.\n\nThe Hurricane and Rosey began teaming together, and competed sporadically on \"Raw\", making more regular appearances on \"Heat\". They faced the teams of Chris Jericho and Christian and Evolution, before beginning a long-running feud (scripted rivalry) with La Résistance. The feud continued for most of 2004, and The Hurricane and Rosey faced La Résistance several times on \"Raw\" and pay-per-view, including at Backlash. On the July 19, 2004 episode of \"Raw\", Rosey appeared with a new costume, showing that he seemingly graduated to a full superhero. The Hurricane and Rosey finished out the year competing against teams including Rhyno and Tajiri and Val Venis and Steven Richards.\n\nIn early 2005 at May's pay-per-view event Backlash, The Hurricane and Rosey won the World Tag Team Championship in a Tag Team Turmoil match after defeating then-champions Tajiri and William Regal, The Heart Throbs (Romeo and Antonio), Simon Dean and Maven and La Résistance (Robért Conway and Sylvain Grenier) by last eliminating La Résistance. During this time, the team successfully retained the championship against various teams, including La Résistance, Simon Dean and Maven, and The Heart Throbs.\n\nWhile on Raw, Stacy Keibler joined forces with The Hurricane and Rosey, acting as their valet. She accompanied them to the ring wearing a mask and superhero costume of her own, calling herself \"Super Stacy\" until she was traded to the SmackDown! brand on August 22.\n\nOn the September 5, 2005 episode of \"Raw\", The Hurricane and Rosey were defeated by the team of Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch in Cade and Murdoch's debut match for the brand. Although this was a non-title match, the pair earned themselves a title match at the September pay-per-view, Unforgiven. During the title match at the event, Murdoch delivered an elevated DDT on The Hurricane outside the ring. The DDT caused The Hurricane to suffer a storyline \"stinger\" and allowed Cade and Murdoch to beat the injured Hurricane later in the match to win the World Tag Team Championship.\n\nThe loss of the World Tag Team Championship signalled the end of the team; in the following weeks, the pair began a losing streak, mainly caused by The Hurricane's injuries. During the October 17 episode of \"Raw\", The Hurricane was assaulted by Kurt Angle at the request of Vince McMahon. After the beating, footage was shown of The Hurricane ripping off his mask and striking Rosey (who had come to the ring to his aid). The following week, The Hurricane did not show up in a World Tag Team title match leaving Rosey to face the champions alone. During the match, The Hurricane (out of costume) appeared at the top of the entrance ramp, now going by his real name, Gregory Helms, and watched as Rosey was double teamed and defeated. After the match, Helms announced that he was fed up with being funny for the crowd and that he had been carrying Rosey as a tag team partner.\n\nHelms requested a match with Rosey, and defeated him with a shining wizard to end their partnership permanently. This was one of Rosey's last matches with WWE, as he was released shortly thereafter while Helms went on to win his third Cruiserweight Championship at the 2006 Royal Rumble in January, resulting in Helms returning to the SmackDown! roster and subsequently establishing himself outside The Hurricane identity, while Stacy Keibler left WWE in early 2006.\n\n\n"}

Lee Thompson and starring Deborah Kerr, David Niven and Sharon Tate. The film is set in rural France and was filmed at the Château de Hautefort and in England. \"Eye of the Devil\" is based on the novel \"Day of the Arrow\" by Robin Estridge and was initially titled \"Thirteen\".\n\nDavid Niven plays the owner of a vineyard, who is called back to the estate when it falls on hard times. Accompanied by his wife (Deborah Kerr), the couple are confronted by a beautiful witch (Sharon Tate), who also lives on the estate with her brother (David Hemmings). As time passes it becomes clear that a blood sacrifice is expected to return the vineyard to its former glory.\n\n\n\"The Day of the Arrow\" was published in 1964. The \"New York Times\" praised it for telling the story from a male point of view although said the ending would not surprise anyone who had read \"The Golden Bough\". Film rights were bought by Martin Ransohoff of Filmways, who had a multi-picture deal with MGM.\n\nThe script was written by Robin Estridge, author of the novel. Terry Southern was brought in to do an uncredited \"tighting and brightning\" of the screenplay.\n\nKim Novak was signed to play the lead. (Novak had signed a three-picture deal with Ransohoff in 1961.) David Niven joined her as co-star. It was the first feature film for Sharon Tate who had been discovered by Ransohoff when she went to audition for \"Petticoat Junction\"; he was impressed and put her under a seven-year contract. Tate had spent months studying and playing small roles at Ransohoff's expense before making her debut. \"Everybody should make an effort to show a new face in every major picture,\" said Ransohoff.\n\nThe original director was Sidney J. Furie, who had signed a three-picture deal with Ransohoff. In August 1965, shortly before filming was to begin, Furie was replaced by Michael Anderson. When Anderson fell ill, he was replaced in turn by J. Lee Thompson. Shortly before filming started the title of the movie was changed to \"13\".\n\nFilming started on 13 September 1965. In November, with only two weeks of shooting to be completed, Novak injured her back in a riding incident. While doing an important scene on location in France, she was thrown from a horse. The film was shut down while Novak sought treatment. She tried to resume filming two weeks later but was exhausted after only one day of work and was unable to go on. \"There is no permanent damage to Kim's back,\" said her husband Richard Johnson. \"It is not something that will trouble her for the rest of her life. She will recover eventually. It is going to take time and will not be an easy matter.\" (Novak later said the injury was a broken vertebra.)\n\n\"It is tragic, but without Kim or a replacement, we cannot go on,\" said David Niven. \"The person I feel most sorry for is director J. Lee Thompson. He has put everything into this picture.\"\n\nShe was replaced by Deborah Kerr. As a result, many scenes had to be reshot, with Novak seen only in some long shots. However, David Hemmings recalls in his autobiography that he witnessed a bitter argument between Kim Novak and Martin Ransohoff near the end of filming led Kim Novak to be sacked and the film to be reshot with Deborah Kerr. Filming resumed with Kerr in December.\n\nWhen asked what it was like to act with such a distinguished cast Tate said \"Of course I was nervous but I was flattered rather than intimidated because everybody put me at such ease. They are such pros. You don't see their technique but when you are surrounded by the best it brings out the best in you.\"\n\nTo give the pagan rites some authenticity, Alex Sanders, an English occultist and Wiccan, was hired as a consultant to the film.\n\nThe film features the debut performance of Sharon Tate, cast by Filmways executive Martin Ransohoff, who hailed her as his great discovery. The film attracted little attention and had little impact on Tate's career. A \"The New York Times\" review referred to Tate's \"chillingly beautiful but expressionless\" performance.\n\nAlthough \"Eye of the Devil\" was not a commercial success in the United States when first released, it was popular in Europe, and it has acquired a degree of cult status, largely due to its surreal themes, and the 1969 murder of Tate. The film is also notable for its distinguished supporting cast, which includes veteran actors Donald Pleasence, Flora Robson, Emlyn Williams, Edward Mulhare and John Le Mesurier.\n\nIn 1968 the film was listed as one of only three Ransohoff films to not make money (the others were \"Don't Make Waves\" and \"The Loved One\".) \n\n\"Eye of the Devil\" was released to DVD by Warner Home Video on 21 February 2011 via its Warner Archive DVD-on-demand service as a Region 1 widescreen DVD.\n\n"}

In the United States, bursars usually exist only at the level of higher education (four-year colleges and universities) or at private secondary schools. In Australia, Great Britain, and other countries, bursars are common at lower levels of education.\n\nThe bursar is responsible for billing of student tuition accounts. This responsibility involves sending bills and making payment plans; the ultimate goal is to bring all student accounts to a \"paid off\" status. Bursars are not necessarily involved in the financial aid process. \n\nBursars' duties vary from one institution to another. At many institutions, bursars deal only with student finances. At other institutions, bursars also deal with some faculty finance issues. Elsewhere, they also oversee accounts receivable, or the payments that the university receives from outside organizations for which it performs services. In some institutions, all money held by the institution is the bursar's responsibility. Some bursars (in the UK for instance) also have responsibility for payroll, investments, facilities, IT, human resources, health and safety and oversight of administrative functions at an institution.\n\nThe bursar statement is also known as a tuition bill or a student account bill.\n\nThe bursar often reports to a comptroller. For example, Barnard College employs an Associate Comptroller–Bursar. In other cases, the bursar has the same level as the comptroller, and both report to the director or vice president of finance. Some universities in the United States still have a director of student financial services whose role is similar to that of a bursar. The University of Pennsylvania employs an associate vice president who essentially combines the role of a bursar (using the student financial services title) and that of a registrar.\n\nTerry Pratchett's \"Discworld\" novels contain a character called \"The Bursar\". This character, like most other faculty members of Pratchett's Unseen University, is almost always referred to by his job title.\n\nIn the \"Hamilton (musical)\" in the song \"Aaron Burr, Sir\", it is mentioned that Alexander Hamilton punched the bursar.\n\n"}

Some who had escaped the raid continued underground or fled abroad. More members were arrested in 1994 and 1996, and the last of them in 2009; Brenice Lee Smith served two months in jail before pleading guilty to a single charge of smuggling hashish, and then was released after being sentenced to time served.\n\nIn 2010, Nicholas Schou published a book called \"Orange Sunshine\" on the brotherhood.

Ranked as a number 1 hit for Day on both the \"Billboard\" and \"Cash Box\", the song also afforded Day a number 1 hit in the UK. \"Secret Love\" has subsequently been recorded by a wide range of artists, becoming a C&W hit firstly for Slim Whitman and later for Freddy Fender, with the song also becoming an R&B hit for Billy Stewart, whose version also reached the Top 40 as did Freddy Fender's. In the U.K., \"Secret Love\" would become the career record of Kathy Kirby via her 1963 remake of the song. The melody bears a slight resemblance to the opening theme of Schubert's A-major piano sonata, D.664.\n\nDoris Day first heard \"Secret Love\" when its co-writer Sammy Fain visited the singer's home and played it for her, Day being so moved by the song that she'd recall her reaction as being: \"I just about fell apart\". \n\nDay recorded the song on 5 August 1953 in a session at the Warner Bros. Recording Studio (Burbank), overseen by Warner Bros. musical director Ray Heindorf. On the day of the recording session for \"Secret Love\", Day had done vocal exercises at her home. Then about noon—the session being scheduled for 1 p.m.—she had set out on her bicycle to the studio. Heindorf had rehearsed the studio orchestra prior to Day's reaching the studio; upon her arrival, Heindorf suggested that Day do a practice run-through with the orchestra prior to recording any takes, but acquiesced to Day's request that her first performance with the orchestra be recorded. Day recalls, \"When I got there I sang the song with the orchestra for the first time ... That was the first and only take we did.\" ... \"When I finished Ray called me into the sound booth grinning from ear to ear and said, 'That's it. You're never going to do it better.'\"\n\nThe single of \"Secret Love\" was released on 9 October 1953—three weeks prior to the premiere of the \"Calamity Jane\" film—by her longtime record label, Columbia Records in both 45 and 78 rpm format (cat. no.40108). The single entered the Top 20 bestselling singles survey at number 17 on \"Billboard\" magazine dated 9 January 1954 with the single reaching number 1 on the Top 20 survey for the week ending 17 February 1954, the week in which the song's Academy Award nomination for Best Song had been announced, the nominations for the 26th Academy Awards for the film year 1953 having been announced two days earlier. Day's \"Secret Love\", having spent three weeks ranked as the number 1 bestselling single by \"Billboard\", was still ranked as the number 4 bestseller the week of the 26th Academy Awards broadcast which occurred 25 March 1954. However, Day declined to perform the nominated (and ultimately victorious) \"Secret Love\" at the Academy Awards ceremony, later stating: \"When they asked me to sing 'Secret Love' on Academy Awards night I told them I couldn't—not in front of those people\". Instead, Ann Blyth performed the song at the ceremony. Day's refusal to perform \"Secret Love\" on the Academy Awards broadcast resulted in the Hollywood Women's Press Club \"honoring\" Day with the Sour Apple Award as the most uncooperative celebrity of 1953: this put-down occasioned a bout of depression which kept Day virtually housebound for several weeks, and which Day eventually had to qualify her Christian Science outlook to deal with, consulting with a medical practitioner.\n\nAt the time of the release of the Doris Day version of \"Secret Love\" two vocal cover versions were issued, one of which - by Gogi Grant with the Harry Geller orchestra - is said to have been recorded at RCA Victor's LA recording studio in July 1953 which would make its recording earlier than Day's: the other vocal cover was recorded for MGM by Tommy Edwards with the LeRoy Holmes orchestra. Bing Crosby also had a single release of \"Secret Love\", recorded for Decca in Los Angeles in a 31 December 1953 session with the John Scott Trotter Orchestra and it was included in his album \"Bing Sings the Hits\" (1954).\n\nOn 4 December 1953 Slim Whitman made a recording of \"Secret Love\" in Baltimore MD: Whitman's version reached number 2 on the C&W chart in \"Billboard\" magazine in the spring of 1954 concurrent with the Doris Day version being number 1 on the magazine's Pop chart.\n\nBoth the Moonglows and the Orioles covered \"Secret Love\" for the r&b market, the Moonglows' track being recorded in Chicago 10 January 1954 while the Orioles' track was recorded in New York City 29 January 1954.\n\nIn 1963 Kathy Kirby remade \"Secret Love\"; released in October 1963 as a single, the track - with musical direction by Charles Blackwell, Jimmy Page on guitar, and production by Kirby's regular collaborator Peter Sullivan - afforded Kirby her UK career record with a number 4 UK chart peak that December. \"Secret Love\" was also a hit in Australia reaching number 2. Kirby would recall: \"[when] 'Secret Love'...was suggested by my recording manager Peter Sullivan[,] I said 'But that's already been done beautifully by Doris Day!' Peter came up with a completely different version, up-tempo and starting with the middle eight. We took a chance on it and decided that if it didn't chart it would at least be a prestige number, so we were thrilled when it sold over half a million copies in three weeks\". \"Secret Love\" provided the title for a jukebox musical depicting Kirby's life story, which following its debut run at the Leeds City Varieties commencing 9 May 2008 played venues throughout England into 2009.\n\nFreddy Fender remade \"Secret Love\" for his 1975 album release \"Are You Ready For Freddy?\" recorded in the summer of 1975 at the SugarHill Recording Studios (Houston): issued as a single in October 1975 \"Secret Love\" afforded Fender the third of his four number 1 hits on the \"Billboard\" C&W, also crossing-over to the U.S. Top 40 of \"Billboard\" Hot 100, reaching number 20. (Fender would score one subsequent Top 40 hit, his fourth C&W number 1 hit \"You'll Lose a Good Thing\" crossing-over to the number 32 on the Hot 100.) Fender remade \"Secret Love\" for his 2002 album \"\"La Musica de Baldemar Huerta\".\n\nJohn Serry Sr. arranged and recorded this composition with his ensemble on Dot Records (DLP-3024) for his album \"Squeeze Play\" in 1956 and on Versailles Records (90 M 178) on \"Chicago Musette -John Serry et son Accordén\" in 1958.\n\n\nCaterina Valente also recorded this song in an upbeat version.\nPianist David Benoit recorded a version on his 1987 album, Waiting For Spring.\n"}

Before embarking on a career in music, he served in the United States Marines. In 1953, he made his first record for Sheraton Records in Boston, Massachusetts, but he did not immediately pursue a full-time career in music, instead choosing to study at Memphis State University from 1953 to 1955. Nicknamed \"Cowboy\" Jack Clement, during his student days, he played steel guitar with a local band. In 1956, Clement was part of one of the seminal events in rock-and-roll history when he was hired as a producer and engineer for Sam Phillips at Sun Records. Subsequently, Clement worked with future stars such as Roy Orbison, Carl Perkins and Johnny Cash. Most notably, he discovered and recorded Jerry Lee Lewis while Phillips was away on a trip to Florida. One of those recordings, \"Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On\", was selected in 2005 for permanent preservation in the National Recording Registry at the Library of Congress.\n\nIn 1957, Clement wrote the song \"Ballad of a Teenage Queen\", which became a crossover hit for Johnny Cash. Other Cash hits written by Clement include \"Guess Things Happen That Way\", which was No. 1 on the country chart and No. 11 on the pop chart in 1958, and the comedic \"The One on the Right Is on the Left\", which was a No. 2 country and No. 46 pop hit in 1966. Clement also produced Cash's No. 1 hit, \"Ring of Fire,\" in 1963. Clement performed \"Guess Things Happen That Way\" on the \"Johnny Cash Memorial Tribute\" on CMT (Country Music Television) in November 2003.\n\nIn 1958, Clement released the single \"Ten Years\", which was covered by Johnny Western (1959), Rex Allen (1962) and Roger Mews.\n\nIn 1959, Clement accepted an offer to work as a producer at RCA Victor in Nashville, then the most important label in the record industry. In 1961, he moved to Beaumont, Texas, joining the producer and publisher Bill Hall in opening the Gulf Coast Recording Studio and the Hall-Clement publishing company. He returned to Nashville permanently in 1965, becoming a significant figure in the country music business, establishing a publishing business, and founding a recording studio, making records for stars such as Charley Pride and Ray Stevens. In 1971, he co-founded JMI Records, which can be credited with launching the career of Don Williams.\n\nClement wrote a number of highly successful songs that have been recorded by singing stars such as Johnny Cash, Dolly Parton, Ray Charles, Carl Perkins, Bobby Bare, Elvis Presley, Jim Reeves, Jerry Lee Lewis, Cliff Richard (\"It'll Be Me\"), Charley Pride, Tom Jones, Dickey Lee and Hank Snow. He was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1973. He also produced albums by Townes Van Zandt and Waylon Jennings.\n\nClement was involved in a few film projects as a singer or songwriter of soundtracks. He produced the 1975 horror film \"Dear Dead Delilah\", the last film performance by the actress Agnes Moorehead.\n\nIn 1987, Clement was approached by U2 to record at Sun Studio in Memphis. Clement was then oblivious to U2's catalog, but nonetheless agreed to arrange the session upon the urging of someone in his office. The result was a portion of the U2 album \"Rattle and Hum\" (\"When Love Comes to Town\", with BB King; \"Angel of Harlem\", a tribute to Billie Holiday; and \"Love Rescue Me\", with backing vocals by Bob Dylan), as well as the Woody Guthrie song \"Jesus Christ\", which was included on the 1988 album \"Folkways: A Vision Shared—A Tribute to Woody Guthrie & Leadbelly\". Portions of the two sessions also appear in the film \"Rattle and Hum\".\n\nIn 2005, a documentary about Clement, \"Shakespeare Was a Big George Jones Fan\", was created by Robert Gordon and Morgan Neville, pieced together from Clement's home videos and interviews with peers, including Jerry Lee Lewis and Bono.\n\nClement hosted a weekly program on Sirius XM Satellite Radio.\n\nHe was inducted into the Rockabilly Hall of Fame, the Memphis Music Hall of Fame, and the Music City Walk of Fame.\n\nOn June 25, 2011, a fire destroyed his home and studio on Belmont Boulevard in Nashville. Clement was unhurt, but many priceless recordings and memorabilia were lost.\n\nOn April 10, 2013, it was announced Clement would be inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame.\n\nClement died at his home in Nashville, Tennessee, on August 8, 2013.

{"id": "1844998", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1844998", "title": "Oblate", "text": "Oblate\n\nIn Christian monasticism (especially Catholic, Orthodox, Anglican and Methodist), an oblate is a person who is specifically dedicated to God or to God's service.\n\nOblates are individuals, either laypersons or clergy, normally living in general society, who, while not professed monks or nuns, have individually affiliated themselves with a monastic community of their choice. They make a formal, private promise (annually renewable or for life, depending on the monastery with which they are affiliated) to follow the Rule of the Order in their private lives as closely as their individual circumstances and prior commitments permit. Such oblates are considered an extended part of the monastic community; for example, Benedictine oblates also often include the post-nominal letters 'OblSB' or 'ObSB' after their names on documents. They are comparable to the tertiaries associated with the various mendicant orders.\n\nThe term \"oblate\" is also used in the official name of some religious institutes as an indication of their sense of dedication.\n\nThe word \"oblate\" (from the Latin \"oblatus\" - someone who has been offered) has had various particular uses at different periods in the history of the Christian church.\n\nThe children vowed and given by their parents to the monastic life, in houses under the Rule of St. Benedict, were commonly known by this term during the century and a half after its writing, when the custom was in vogue, and the councils of the Church treated them as monks. This practice continued until the Tenth Council of Toledo in 656 forbade their acceptance before the age of ten and granted them free permission to leave the monastery, if they wished, when they reached the age of puberty. The term \"puer oblatus\" (used after that Council) labels an \"oblate\" who had not yet reached puberty and thus had a future opportunity to leave the monastery, though \"puer oblatus\" can also refer to someone entering an abbey. At a later date the term \"oblate\" designated such lay men or women as were pensioned off by royal and other patrons upon monasteries or benefices, where they lived as in an almshouse or homes.\n\nIn the 11th century, Abbot William of Hirschau or Hirsau (died 1091), in the old diocese of Spires, introduced two kinds of lay brethren into the monastery:\n\n\nAfterwards, the different status of the lay brother in the several orders of monks, and the ever-varying regulations concerning him introduced by the many reforms, destroyed the distinction between the \"conversus\" and the \"oblatus\".\n\nThe Cassinese Benedictines, for instance, at first carefully differentiated between \"conversi\", \"commissi\" and \"oblati\"; the nature of the vows and the forms of the habits were in each case specifically distinct. The \"conversus\", the lay brother properly so called, made solemn vows like the choir monks, and wore the scapular; the \"commissus\" made simple vows, and was dressed like a monk, but without the scapular; the \"oblatus\" made a vow of obedience to the abbot, gave himself and his goods to the monastery, and wore a sober secular dress.\n\nBut in 1625, we find the \"conversus\" reduced below the status of the \"commissus\", inasmuch as he could make only simple vows for a year at a time; he was in fact indistinguishable, except by his dress, from the \"oblatus\" of a former century. Then, in the later Middle Ages, \"oblatus\", \"confrater\", and \"donatus\" became interchangeable titles, given to any one who, for his generosity or special service to the monastery, received the privilege of lay membership, with a share in the prayers and good works of the brethren.\n\nCanonically, only two distinctions ever had any consequence:\n\n\nIn modern practice, many Benedictine communities have a greater or smaller number of secular oblates. These are either clergy or laypeople affiliated in prayer with an individual monastery of their choice, who have made a formal private promise (annually renewable or for life) to follow the Rule of St Benedict in their private life at home and at work as closely as their individual circumstances and prior commitments permit.\n\nIn the Roman Catholic Church the oblate is in an individual relationship with the monastic community and does not form a distinct unit within the Church, there are no regulations in the modern canon law of the Church regarding them. One consequence is that non-Catholic Christians can be received as oblates of a Catholic monastery. Similarly in Methodist monasteries, non-Methodist Christians can be received as oblates. The same is the case with many Anglican monasteries, which accept non-Anglican Christians as oblates. \n\nBy contrast, the Eastern Orthodox require that Oblates be baptized in the Orthodox faith and in good standing with their local parish.\n\nThere is a small number of conventual or claustral oblates, who reside in a monastic community. If the person has not done so previously, after a year's probation they make a simple commitment of their lives to the monastery, which is received by the superior in the presence of the whole community. More on the level of committed volunteers, they would share in the life of the community and undertake, without remuneration, any work or service required of them. They are not, however, considered monks or nuns themselves. Often they wear a religious habit similar to, but distinct from, that of the monks or nuns. A conventual oblate may cancel this commitment at any time; and it is canceled automatically if the superior sends the oblate away for good reason, after simple consultation with the chapter.\n\nThere are several religious orders (\"i.e.\", living the consecrated life according to Church Law) that use the word \"Oblate\" in their name, or in an extended version of their common name. These are not oblates like the oblates (secular) and (regular), and should not be confused with them.\n\nExamples include the:\n\n\n\n\n"}

Their traditional arch rivals are the Glasgow Rocks, however in recent years a rivalry with the Leicester Riders has also developed.\n\nThe Northumbria Northstars cheerleading team provide the cheerleaders known as the Eaglettes.\n\nThe club's roots can be traced back to the founding of EPAB Washington in 1976. The club played in Sunderland under various monikers throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, managing a second place league finish in 1983, as well as two play-off victories at Wembley in 1981 & '83. In 1995, the owner Dave Elderkin moved the club to Newcastle, to be known as the Newcastle Comets. Soon afterwards the club was bought by Sir John Hall, then the chairman of Newcastle United, adding them to his Newcastle Sporting Group of the city's football, ice hockey and rugby teams. Hall's Sporting Club group was considered by most observers to be a relative failure and upon its dissolution, Ken Nottage and Paul Blake became the Eagles' new owners. The final name change, from the Comets to the Eagles, took place in 1996. Performances remained consistent with the club achieving regular top five league placings from 1998 onwards.\n\nThe 2005–06 season proved to be the most successful in their history so far when, under the guidance of player/coach Fabulous Flournoy, the club achieved a \"clean sweep\" of trophies, including the BBL Cup, BBL Trophy and Championship \"double\".\n\nIn addition, Flournoy picked up the BBL Coach of the Year and former Villanova Wildcat, Andrew Sullivan, was voted BBL Player of the Year. Flournoy, Sullivan and Andrew Bridge were also members of the bronze medal winning England team in the 2006 Commonwealth Games during March 2006.\n\nAt the start of the 2007–08 season it was announced that Nike and Northern Rock were to sponsor the Eagles, bringing in more money to the club. Also, the signing of Richard Midgley gave great hope that the eagles could challenge Guildford Heat to regain the BBL League title. However, after a bust up with player/coach, Fab Flournoy he soon left to join the Everton Tigers. This meant there was no point guard and this led to the signing of Bryan Defares who could not settle in England and he too left. Finally, at the third attempt, Steve Leven (former NBA prospect) was signed despite his bad boy reputation. After defeat in the BBL Cup, then later defeat in the BBL Trophy Final the Eagles were in danger of having a poor season. Fortunately, after a miraculous overtime win against Guildford Heat, they won the BBL League Title.\n\nAt the start of the 2008–09 season they were strengthened by the signing of Trey Moore from Cheshire Jets. After an indifferent start, they embarked on a 17 match winning run to become the first team for nearly two decades to retain the BBL title, finishing 8 points ahead of Everton Tigers. They also reached the semi-finals of the BBL Cup, losing narrowly to Everton Tigers on aggregate before gaining revenge by beating them home and away in the BBL Trophy semi-final. The Eagles beat Guildford Heat at The Spectrum in the Final. In the play-offs they narrowly avoided an upset after seeing off Cheshire Jets 88–83 before beating Plymouth Raiders to form a match against Everton Tigers once again. Despite 30 points from ex-Eagles Richard Midgley, the Eagles held on for a 97–94 win, therefore winning the treble to cap off their most successful season since the clean sweep.\n\nIn the 2009–10 season the Eagles again retained the BBL title, finishing 2 points ahead of Sheffield Sharks. The league title actually came down to the last game of the season with Sheffield Sharks losing their last game of the season 97–95 to Worthing Thunder thanks to Evaldas Zabas' basket 4 seconds from the end. This completed the double for the Eagles who had won the BBL Trophy by beating 111–95 in the Final at The Spectrum. In the BBL Cup Eagles lost 64–61 in the quarter-finals to Cheshire Jets and in the play-offs Everton Tigers beat the Eagles 190–158 on aggregate in the two legged semi-final.\n\nAt the start of the 2010–2011 season it was announced that the Esh Group, along with partners Northumbria University and Northumbrian Water would be the new main sponsors of the Eagles. In the BBL Cup the Eagles were beaten 204–182 on aggregate by the Mersey Tigers in the semi-finals. Eagles had won the first leg at home 97–90 but lost the second leg away 114–85. It was the Mersey Tigers who would beat the Eagles in the semi-finals of the BBL Trophy also. After a rare first leg draw (82–82) away from home, the Eagles went down 77–74 at home.\n\nThe club repeated the feat of 2005–06 by winning all of the trophies on offer in a season for a second time 2011–12. The previous season was the first time since 2003–04 that they had failed to win a trophy. They lost 7 league games, 3 less than in 2005–06, although this time around they were only required to play 30 games, 10 less than in 2005–06. They clinched the clean sweep with a victory over Leicester in the play-off final on 12 May. A hat-trick of sweeps was completed in the 2014–15 season.\n\nIn January 2019, the Eagles moved into their own purpose-built arena on the Scotswood Road. Success did not follow them there at first, as they crashed out of the BBL Trophy, BBL Cup and BBL Playoffs without reaching any finals, and finished 3rd in the BBL for the second consecutive season.\n\nOn the night of their first preseason game ahead of the 2019-20 British Basketball League season, the club was rocked by the announcement that head coach Fabulous Flournoy would leave the club after 17 years. Flournoy would join the Toronto Raptors, the then-defending NBA champions, as an assistant coach, reuniting with his friend and mentor Nick Nurse, who gave him his first professional contract with the Birmingham Bullets in 1996. Assistant coach Ian MacLeod was announced as his interim replacement as head coach.\n\n\nAccurate as of 7 October 2014 (Includes BBL Championship games only)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The following information is established according to the official websites of the team (www.newcastle-eagles.com) and Britain's top professional league, the BBL (www.bbl.org.uk).\"\n\n– Set a club record or won an individual award as a professional player.<br>\n– Played at least one official international match for his senior national team at any time.\n\n\nStats correct up to and including 8 August 2018\n\n\n\nPlayer/Coach – Fab Flournoy\n\nAssistant Coaches – Dave Forrester, Ian MacLeod\n\nTeam Manager – Eric Wilson\n\n"}

The order was instituted by Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands on 19 March 1905 and is not subject to ministerial responsibility or influence, but is awarded at the discretion of the Dutch monarch alone.\n\nIn 1905, Queen Wilhelmina felt the need for a House Order because the Order of the Oak Crown of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, used by her father and grandfather to reward Dutch subjects, was no longer available to her, as succession to the throne of Luxembourg was directed by the House treaty of the House of Nassau in a way comparable to the Salic Law within its constitution in 1890.\n\nThe Order of the House of Orange had a very complex nomenclature, with 18 different classes and medals:\n\n\nThe number does not indicate a rank within the Order. The Dame of Honour was neither inferior nor superior to another grade; however the highest rank was the Grand Cross. The insignia vary considerably amongst these awards; however, they all share the same orange ribbon, symbolizing the House of Orange.\n\nMore than 3200 decorations were conferred between 1905 and 1969, mostly to Court Dignitaries, the Queen's household, and doctors and lawyers who could choose between sending a bill for their services or a decoration in the House Order.\n\nBy court decree on 30 November 1969, Queen Juliana decided to reorganise the Order to bring it more in line with the ever more egalitarian spirit of the Dutch society. As a result, the order is now divided into four semi-independent groups:\n\n\nSince the reorganisation in 1969 the House Order itself has these grades:\n\n\nEvery subject of the King (or Queen) of the Netherlands, apart from the members of the Royal House (see note), can be awarded the Cross of Honour. Once awarded, the recipient can be promoted to a higher grade of the House Order after three years.\n\n\"Note: The Royal House (Koninklijk Huis) is a rather complex definition within Dutch constitutional theory and Dutch law. It consists of the Monarch, his or her consort, former monarchs and their consorts and those members of his family that have a right to succeed him up to the second degree and their consorts. The Government is responsible for the actions and words of the monarch and in a lesser respect the members of the Royal House. The House is not the same as the Royal Family. The Queen's second son decided not to ask for parliamentary approval for his marriage and lost his right to succeed to the throne, his membership of the Royal House and the title Prince of the Netherlands. He did however retain the style and title of Royal Highness, a Prince of Orange-Nassau and a member of the Royal Family.\n\n"}
{"id": "1845001", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1845001", "title": "Superior good", "text": "Superior good\n\nSuperior goods or luxury goods make up a larger \"proportion\" of consumption as income rises, and therefore are a type of normal goods in consumer theory. Such a good must possess two economic characteristics: it must be scarce, and, along with that, it must have a high price. The scarcity of the good can be natural or artificial; however, the general population (i.e., consumers) must recognize the good as distinguishably \"better\". Possession of such a good usually signifies \"superiority\" in resources, and usually is accompanied by prestige. \n\nA Veblen good is a superior goods with a prestige value so high that a price decline would \"lower\" demand.\n\nThe income elasticity of a superior good is above one by definition, because it raises the expenditure share as income rises. A superior good also may be a luxury good that is not purchased at all below a certain level of income. Examples would include smoked salmon and caviar, and most other delicacies. On the other hand, superior goods may have a wide quality distribution, such as wine and holidays; however, though the \"number\" of such goods consumed may stay constant even with rising wealth, the level of spending will go up, to secure a better experience.\n\nThe choice of the word \"\"superior\"\" to define goods of this type suggests that they are the antonym of \"inferior goods\", but this is misleading; an inferior good can never be a superior good, but many goods are neither superior nor inferior. If the quantity of an item demanded increases with income, \"but\" not by enough to increase the share of the budget spent on it, then it is only a normal good and is not a superior good.\n\nConsumption of all normal goods increases as income increases. For example, if income increases by 50%, then consumption will increase (maybe by only 1%, maybe by 40%, maybe by 70%). A superior good is a normal good for which the proportional consumption increase exceeds the proportional income increase. So, if income increases by 50% then consumption of a superior good will increase by more than 50% (maybe 51%, maybe 70%). \n\nIn economics terminology, all goods with an income elasticity of demand greater than zero are \"normal\", but only the subset having income elasticity of demand > 1 are \"superior\".\n\nSome texts on microeconomics use the term \"superior good\" as the sole alternative to an \"inferior good\", making \"superior goods\" and \"normal goods\" synonymous. Where this is done, a product making up an increasing share of spending under income increases is often called an \"ultra-superior good\".\n\n"}

The village gives its name to a Cardiff local authority electoral ward, Pentyrch, which covers the village and immediate surrounding area. The Pentyrch community includes the neighbouring village of Creigiau and Gwaelod y Garth. People living in Pentyrch are commonly known as \"Penterchyians\".\n\nThe village is situated next to the Garth Mountain, high above the River Taff.\n\nThe village can be reached from junction 32 of the M4 Motorway, then A470, then via Heol Goch, a hill flanked by a quarry and nature reserve. Alternatively, Church Road provides access from Llantrisant Road near St Fagans.\n\nOther approaches are from Creigiau and Gwaelod-y-Garth.\n\nAt the 2001 census, Pentyrch contained 3,535 individuals, in 1,358 households.\n\nPentyrch became the newest addition to the Cardiff unitary authority in 1996. The electoral ward of Pentyrch elects one councillor to Cardiff Council.\n\nIt falls within the parliamentary constituency of Cardiff West and is represented by the Labour Party in the Houses of Commons and the National Assembly. The ward is bounded by Rhondda Cynon Taf to the north; and by the wards of Whitchurch & Tongwynlais to the east; Radyr & Morganstown to the southeast; and Creigiau & St. Fagans to the southwest.\n\nPentyrch was represented by Conservative councillor Craig Williams on Cardiff Council until he stepped down in 2015, following his election to Parliament for Cardiff North. A by-election for the Pentyrch ward took place on Tuesday 30 June 2015 which, despite a 27% swing to Plaid Cymru's Hywel Wigley, resulted in a narrow win for Conservative candidate Gavin Hill-John by 18 votes.\n\nAt the Cardiff Council election on 4 May 2017 Cllr Hill-John successfully defended his seat, increasing the margin between himself and Hywel Wigley to 215 votes. The turnout was 56%.\n\nThe Pentyrch Community Council has thirteen elected (or co-opted) members, representing the villages of Pentyrch, Creigiau (including Capel Llanilltern) and Gwaelod y Garth (the three community wards) on a ratio of 6:5:2.\n\nElections are held every five years.\n\nTen candidates (6 Independent, 3 Welsh Labour, 1 Plaid Cymru) stood for election during the 2017 Cardiff Council election. All candidates were therefore elected unopposed.\n\nThe following by-elections took place between May 2017 and the next election in 2022.\n\nPolitical affiliation recorded as 'Welsh Conservative' on the Pentyrch Community Council website (March 2020).\n\nPolitical affiliation recorded as 'Welsh Conservative' on the Pentyrch Community Council website (March 2020).\n\nThe next election is due to be held in May 2022.\n\nOn entering the village from Heol Goch, the visitor passes the playground, and on the left is Acapela Studio - a concert hall and recording studio - owned by harpist Catrin Finch and music and television producer Hywel Wigley. Acapela studio has hosted a series of acclaimed Welsh acts such as Gruff Rhys, Cerys Matthews and Charlotte Church as well as up and coming local and international music acts. Many programs for S4C and the BBC are filmed there. The building itself is converted from the former presbyterian Capel Horeb and contains a fully licensed bar. Opposite Acapela is the Lewis Arms public house.\n\nPast these lies the village centre, containing a Spar general store, delicatessen, hairdressers, a veterinary practice and butchers. The focus of older buildings in the village is reached by forking left after entering the village, travelling down to the King's Arms pub, and St. Catwg's Church, at the lowest point of the village. Along with St. Catwg's Church and its lychgate, the King's Arms is a Grade 2 Listed Building. Originally a seventeenth century copyhold farm called Cae Golman, the King's Arms became established as a public house in the eighteenth century. In the lounge bar, can be found a fireplace with chamfered beam, dated 1711.\n\nHousing is split between older housing and large developments of post-1970s housing.\n\nSport in the village is centred on the Pentyrch Rugby Football Club. There is also a cricket pitch and other facilities at the club.\n\nPentyrch Rangers football club is based in the village. The club has nearly 200 registered players and runs 10 junior and mini football teams in the Cardiff and District League.\n\nOther amenities include a village hall and primary school.

{"id": "1845010", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1845010", "title": "Kiamichi River", "text": "Kiamichi River\n\nThe Kiamichi River is a river in southeastern Oklahoma, United States of America. A tributary of the Red River of the South, its headwaters rise on Pine Mountain in the Ouachita Mountains near the Arkansas border. From its source in LeFlore County, Oklahoma, it flows approximately to its confluence with the Red River south at Hugo, Oklahoma.\n\nThe origin of the word Kiamichi is a matter of debate and may never be fully known. Most accounts say the word is a French word, which has been transliterated phonetically, for \"horned screamer\" or \"noisy bird,\" a reference to woodpeckers or other birds living along the river's banks. The spelling of the modern word was not standardized until the twentieth century, making its origin more difficult to determine. The \"Antlers News\", a newspaper published in what was then Antlers, Indian Territory (now in Oklahoma) first used the spelling \"Kiamichi\" in November 1900. Prior to this, the newspaper, along with other authoritative sources, spelled the name of the river as \"Kiamichia\" or \"Kiamitia\" (the latter is closest to a French spelling).\n\nMuriel H. Wright suggested that Kaimichi may be from the French word \"kamichi\", which meant \"horned screamer\", and possibly referred to the whooping cranes along the river. Other spellings of the name have included: Kiomitchie, Cayameechee, Kiamisha, Kimesha, Kimichy, and Kimishi.\nAnother possibility could be the Kichai tribe of the area and dates back to time of Caddo indians.\n\nFrom Pine Mountain the Kiamichi River flows southwest, past Talihina, Tuskahoma and Clayton to Antlers, where it turns abruptly southeast, flowing in this direction to its confluence with Red River.\n\nFor much of its journey the river flows through the picturesque and highly defined Kiamichi River valley, framed by mountains of the same name. Pine Mountain, at approximately , is the highest, although the mountains lining its course, such as Flagpole Mountain at Clayton, are significant, rising generally between and . At Antlers the river meets the massive geological formation known as Standpipe Hill, forcing its turn to the southeast. From Antlers to the Red River the Kiamichi is generally characterized by flowing through a broad alluvial plain, particularly on its approach to the Red.\n\nThe river or its tributaries is impounded by two lakes: Sardis Lake and Hugo Lake. Sardis Lake, named for the small settlement displaced during its construction, impounds Jack's Fork Creek. Hugo Lake, named for the nearby town of Hugo, impounds the river itself. Both are flood control reservoirs built and operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Additional, smaller dams have impounded the waters of the tributaries over time, mostly for the purpose of powering sawmills and other light, localized industry.\n\nNotable geological features of the Kiamichi River valley include McKinley Rocks, the Potato Hills, Rock Town, and Lost Mountain.\nMajor tributaries of the Kiamichi River include Anderson Creek, Big Cedar Creek, Buck Creek, Buffalo Creek, Gates Creek, Jacks’ Fork Creek, Pine Creek, Tenmile Creek and Waterhole Creek.\n\nThe area of the river's watershed is .\n\nThe Kiamichi River defined its region during prehistoric days. Its valley provided the only convenient means of traversing the region from north to south—much as now—and Native American peoples used it as a corridor. The Native Americans who lived in the region prior to European colonization of the Americas were generally Caddo, who were nomads. The powerful Caddoan Mississippian culture based at Spiro Mounds held sway over the Kiamichi River valley, which formed a part of its trade network.\n\nArcheological finds across the Kiamichi River basin attest to early life in its valley. A prehistoric fish weir, or trap, in the river in Pushmataha County, excavated by the Oklahoma Archeological Survey, is a particularly revealing site. Ancient Indians diverted the flow of the river with walls of stone to create a chute into which fish would flow. Radiocarbon dating of charred hickory and pecan hulls found at the site indicate a date of approximately 1,200 BC. Also found were stumps of cypress trees, a tree which has not grown in that portion of the county in perhaps hundreds of years.\n\nOver 220 archeological sites have been identified in Pushmataha County alone, indicating how widespread ancient and more recent settlement was in the region prior to European settlement. Of those sites, three date from at least 8,000 years ago; 145 date from between 2,000-8,000 years ago; and 22 date from between 500–1000 years ago.\n\nDiscovery by Europeans occurred in 1719, when French explorer Bernard de la Harpe explored the Kiamichi River valley. French explorers were quickly followed by French fur trappers; they named most of Oklahoma's rivers.\n\nAmerican explorers followed French ones, and were the first organized scientific surveys of the Kiamichi River. Thomas Nuttall traversed the Kiamichi and Little River valleys in 1819 and Stephen H. Long explored the Kiamichi River in 1821. Nuttall and Long were the precursors of empire; the region was actively settled by Choctaw Indians displaced from elsewhere in the United States starting in 1832.\n\nAfter the relocation of the Choctaw Nation to the Indian Territory in 1832, the river defined the political boundary or border between counties and districts. Forming an easily recognizable geographic frontier, it served in this capacity until Oklahoma's statehood in 1907, when the Choctaw Nation ceased to exist and its political subdivisions were eliminated. A Choctaw county was named after the river, although generally using the Choctaws’ spelling, \"Kiamitia\". The river formed the eastern boundary of Jack's Fork County and Kiamitia County, and the western boundary of Cedar County and Towson counties.\n\nNavigability of the Kiamichi River was an important goal but proved elusive due to a massive logjam in the Red River which prevented river traffic from going much beyond Nachitoches. In 1825 the Arkansas legislature petitioned the United States Congress to remove the Great Raft, as the logjam was called, so that boats could ply the Red River as far west as the mouth of the Kiamichi and the newly established Fort Towson. Within several years, the Army Corps of Engineers had done so.\n\nSecurity along the Red River, the United States' (US) international frontier with the Spanish Empire was a concern, and the US established a chain of forts along the border. Fort Towson in the Choctaw Nation was one. It was built on Gates Creek near the mouth of the Kiamichi. A military road was built from Fort Smith to Fort Towson through the valley of Little River, switching to the Kiamichi River near its southern terminus.\n\nDuring the American Civil War, the last Confederate Army troops to surrender did so at Fort Towson on June 23, 1865. The Confederate States government had disintegrated by this time, and its individual armies surrendered one by one. While the surrender of Robert E. Lee at Appomattox, Virginia signaled the end to the conflict, it did not truly end until the surrender of the last fighting Southern troops at Fort Towson.\n\nTransportation in the Kiamichi River valley was revolutionized between 1882 and 1887 with the construction of the St. Louis and San Francisco Railroad, commonly known as the Frisco. Part of a national network connecting Fort Smith, Arkansas with Paris, Texas, the railway was constructed parallel to the Kiamichi River from Talihina to Kellond, a small settlement three miles north of Antlers, Oklahoma. With the train came the telegraph and later the telephone.\n\nThe coming of the Frisco stimulated settlement in the Choctaw Nation by European Americans and European immigrants. Population centers formed around each of the railroad's station stops, stimulated by trade and new markets. The river was important as a source of fresh, plentiful water for the trains, several of which ran daily.\n\nThe frequent Frisco service encouraged developers to come for resource extraction. Timber companies and individual loggers soon moved in. Over the next several decades, they cleared the old-growth forest in the Kiamichi Mountains. Forestry remains the area's chief industry. Numerous rail spurs were developed from the Frisco outward along the creek valleys stretching away from the river. Large saw mill operations became common in the valleys for processing the lumber.\n\nDuring World War II, a training flight conducted by Britain's Royal Air Force—flying from a base in Texas—went awry in poor weather and two planes crashed. One crashed into the south slope of White Rock Mountain above Moyers, Oklahoma, and another crashed on Big Mountain between Moyers and Kosoma. Two fliers lost their lives in the latter crash. In 2000 school children from Rattan, Oklahoma erected the AT6 Monument in their honor on Big Mountain.\n\nAlso during World War II, the U.S. Navy honored the river with the launch of the USS \"Kiamichi\", hull number AOG-73, built by St. Johns River Shipbuilding in Jacksonville, Florida. She launched on August 17, 1945, three days after the surrender of Japan. Because of the end of the war, completion of the ship was canceled on August 29. A Klickitat-class gasoline tanker, she was later completed for International Tankers of Panama. The ship was renamed \"Transmere\" in 1951 and in 1952 was sold to Colombia; it was renamed \"Sancho Jimeno\".\n\nOn October 29, 1961, President John F. Kennedy visited Big Cedar, east of Talihina, Oklahoma to give a speech marking the opening of U.S. Route 259.\n\nIn August 1975 the Kiamichi River made national news when its bottomlands were the scene of a days-long hunt for two elephants that had escaped from a circus in Hugo, Oklahoma. They were found at Hugo Lake.\n\nFishing and hunting are common along the river, as is boating. American Whitewater, a private organization, defines seven miles of the river near Big Cedar as a \"Class II-III rapid\". In these upper reaches of the river, kayaking is a popular sport among tourists. In Hugo Lake, boating and camping are popular. Sardis Lake has yet to be tapped for large-scale tourism, but its campgrounds are well used. Some boating and waterskiing takes place on the lake.\n\nIn 1988 Congress created the Upper Kiamichi River Wilderness. Defined as a territory at and below the headwaters of the Kiamichi River at Pine Mountain and Rich Mountain, the wilderness now encompasses 9,754 acres. It is part of the National Wilderness Preservation System. A portion of the river's watershed is also protected by the Ouachita National Forest.\n\nThree federally designated endangered species occupy the river valley – the Indiana bat, red-cockaded woodpecker and leopard darter. It is also home to a variety of mussels, including several that are somewhat rare.\n\nThe Kiamichi River has been studied since at least 1894, when the first scientific fish collection was made at Walnut Creek at Albion, Oklahoma. This collection netted 36 different kinds of fish. Since construction of Sardis and Hugo dams in the 1970s and 1980s the river has suffered in environmental quality. Its mussels decrease significantly below the inflow from Sardis dam, and almost extinguished as a species below the inflow from Hugo dam. Nonetheless 101 species of fish still survive, and in some cases thrive, in the river.\n\n"}

It is the second longest river in Malaysia with a length of from its headwaters in the mountains of southwest Sabah, to its outlet at the Sulu Sea, east of Sandakan. The area is known for its remarkable wildlife and fascinating habitats including its limestone caves at Gomantong hill, dryland dipterocarp forests, riverine forest, freshwater swamp forest, oxbow lakes and salty mangrove swamps near the coast.\n\nWith the early Chinese traders settlement around the river mouth area, the name \"Kina Batañgan\" has been used by indigenous people with the word \"Kina\" itself is a reference by indigenous Dusun for the Chinese people. The Orang Sungai traditionally lived along the river banks and of mixed ancestry including Dusun, Suluk, Bugis, Bajau as well the Chinese. The earliest Chinese traders settlement on the banks of Kinabatangan River has been established since the 7th century where they trade in edible-nest swiftlet, beeswax, rattan and ivory. In the 15th century, a sister of the Chinese Kinabatangan settlement leader married with the Sultan of Brunei. During the era of British North Borneo, the river serves as the route for goods and timber exports, navigable for steam launches as well for smaller boats. William Burgess Pryer did attempt to establish a market at one location called Domingol in the river coast but the plan did not flourish.\n\nThe river area including Labang and Kuamut are form since the Early and Middle Miocene period while large parts of its river system from the Maliau Basin is form during the Early and Late Miocene. Towards the river mouth, the area is made of Middle Miocene chaotic deposits. The ecology of the upper reaches of the river has been severely disrupted by excessive logging and clearing of land for plantations although the original lowland forests and mangrove swamps near the coast have largely survived, provide sanctuary for a population of saltwater crocodiles (\"Crocodylus porosus\") and contain some of Borneo's highest concentrations of wildlife. In many villages along the river, the demand for freshwater fish always high where the livehood of the villagers greatly depend on the income from their catches. Each year, the lashing rains of the northeast monsoon cause the river to swell rapidly. Unable to disgorge into the sea quickly enough, the river frequently overflows its banks and spreads across the flat land of its lower reaches, creating a huge floodplain.\n\nIn 1997, of the lower Kinabatangan floodplain were declared a protected area. Much of the deeper river area are protected under the Lower Kinabatangan Sanctuary, a reserve established in 1999 which provides a variety of habitats for flora especially freshwater swamp forest, mangrove, palms and bamboo as well fauna such as hose's langur, proboscis monkey, orangutan, pig-tailed macaque, gibbon, slow loris, elephant and rhinoceros. In 2001, the lower Kinabatangan floodplain was upgraded into bird sanctuary area through the efforts of non-governmental organisation (NGOs). Following media attention after a decapitated elephant's head was found floating down the river in 2006, the protected area been gazetted as the Kinabatangan Wildlife Sanctuary through the Sabah Wildlife Conservation Enactment of 1997 under the purview of the Sabah Wildlife Department in 2009.\n\nSince the modern era in the early 1950s until 1987, the lower Kinabatangan area has been subjected to commercial logging activities and more than of its lowland rainforest has been developed into cocoa and palm oil plantations. This resulted in severe pollution to the river which have greatly affected the life of villagers who depended their livelihood on the river and attracting the attention of Minister for Tourism, Culture and Environment Department of the government of Sabah. In 2011, Nestlé launch a reforestation project of the riparian along the Kinabatangan River in Sukau to create a landscape where people, nature and agriculture activities can co-exist harmoniously in their need for water. Most nature tourism is the Kinabatangan River area is concentrated around Sukau since it is accessible by road and offering comfortable accommodation to visitors prepared to pay for well-managed tours.\n\nThe only bridge crossing the river is located at Federal Route , about from Sandakan. A bridge linking Sukau with Litang and Tommanggong was planned but cancelled in April 2017 after opposition from conservationists including David Attenborough due to potential adverse effect on the local pygmy elephant population. The river can be visited all year round, though it is often flooded during the wettest part of the year in December and January. From April to October during the main flowering and fruiting season, the climate is generally fairly dry and a good time to spot many birds and animals. During the northeast monsoon from November to March, there are often heavy showers during the afternoons which usually extended until December and January. Through the rainy season, it is possible to negotiate many of the river channels leading into the oxbow lakes, where there is a greater concentration of wildlife.\n\n\n"}

It is located approximately from the oblast capital, Luhansk. Population: .\nAlchevsk is one of the largest industrial centers in the Donbass, and comprises a quarter of the entire oblast's production. The city economy depends on OJSC \"Alchevsk Iron & Steel Works\" (a trade blockade by Ukrainian activists during the War in Donbass has all but halted production of this plant in February 2017) and \"Alchevsk Coke-Chemical Plant\" companies.\n\nThe city was known as Voroshylovsk () from 1931 to 1961, and then Komunarsk () until 1991.\n\nAlchevsk was founded in 1895 with the establishment of an iron works and named after the Ukrainian industrialist of the Russian Empire Oleksiy Alchevsky who founded the Donetsk–Yuryev Metallurgical Society. He was famous for the financial and industrial development of the eastern part of Ukraine and particularly the Donbass region. Later his children as well as his wife made enormous contribution in the development of the Ukrainian culture through poetry and music.\n\nA local newspaper is published in the city since 1930.\n\nIn 1931, Alchevsk was renamed Voroshilovsk, after Kliment Voroshilov, a Soviet military and party figure. As Voroshilov's personality cult was diminishing, the town was renamed Kommunarsk in 1961. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the original name was restored in 1992.\n\nOn January 22, 2006, the district heating system of the city almost entirely collapsed after an underground heat pipe line cracked in unusually cold weather (nearly ). As a result, heating equipment in the majority of Alchevsk's buildings was frozen and ruptured, leaving about 60,000 residents with only the protection of individual electric heaters. A few days later the sewage system also froze due to a lack of warm tap water.\n\nAn investigation revealed the massive, long-time negligence of the city authorities. The whole heating system was designed in a hyper-centralized way, depending on only two boilers and few main pipelines. Moreover, the housing company failed to react to the pipe incident properly: the water from the system wasn't immediately dumped to prevent further freezing.\n\nThe Ukrainian government took massive emergency actions to protect Alchevsk residents from freezing. Engineering teams sent by cities and industrial companies from other regions of the country were gradually restoring heating appliances in every apartment affected. Hundreds of children together with their schoolteachers were evacuated to the resorts and hotels in the warmer regions of Ukraine. According to the governor of Luhansk Oblast G. Moskal, it has been the worst human-made disaster in the history of independent Ukraine.\n\nStarting Mid-April 2014 pro-Russian forces conquered several towns in Luhansk Oblast, including Alchevsk.

She was a daughter of Louis VII of France and Adèle of Champagne.\n\nIn early 1178, Philip, Count of Flanders visited Constantinople on his way back from the Holy Land. The Eastern Roman Emperor Manuel I Komnenos, who had already entertained Louis VII in Constantinople at Christmas 1147 during the Second Crusade, was perhaps finally convinced by Philip that France would be a desirable ally in Western Europe. Over the winter of 1178-1179 an Imperial embassy accompanying Philip, and led by the Genoese Baldovino Guercio, was sent to the French court to secure a match between Agnes and Alexios, the only son and heir apparent of Manuel by his second wife Maria of Antioch. This or some similar marriage alliance had been favored by Pope Alexander III as early as 1171.\n\nIt was not uncommon for princesses, when a future marriage had been agreed, to be brought up in their intended husband's family; this, indeed, is why Agnes probably never met her elder sister Alys, who lived in the Kingdom of England from the age of about nine, when her marriage to the future Richard I of England was agreed on (though this marriage never took place). Agnes took ship in Montpellier, bound for Constantinople, at Easter 1179. At Genoa the flotilla increased from 5 to 19 ships, captained by Baldovino Guercio.\n\nOn arrival in Constantinople in late summer 1179 Agnes was met by seventy high-ranking ladies and lavish festivities were organized for her. She was greeted with an oration from Eustathios, former Master of the Rhetors and archbishop of Thessalonica. She was perhaps now presented with an elaborate volume of welcoming verses by an anonymous author, sometimes called the \"Eisiterion\".\n\nAccording to William of Tyre, Agnes was eight on her arrival at Constantinople, while Alexios was thirteen. William got Alexios' age wrong (he was born on 14 September 1169) and there is no other source for Agnes' year of birth. If she was in fact eight, she was at least three years too young for marriage, according to most 12th-century views. However, William of Tyre, who was present at the ceremony, seems to describe it as a full wedding (\"matrimonii legibus ... copulare\"); in this he is followed by some other non-Byzantine sources and by many modern authors.\n\nThe ceremony took place in the Trullo Hall, in the Great Palace, on 2 March 1180. Agnes was officially renamed Anna. Eustathios of Thessalonica produced a speech to celebrate the occasion, whose title in the manuscript is \"Oration on the Public Celebrations of the Betrothal of the Two Royal Children\". This ceremony came approximately one month after the wedding of Alexios' half-sister Maria Porphyrogenita to Renier of Montferrat, conducted by the Patriarch of Constantinople, Theodosios.\n\nOn 24 September 1180, Manuel died and Alexios succeeded him as Emperor. He was too young to rule unaided; his mother, Maria of Antioch, exercised more influence in affairs of state than Alexios or Anna.\n\nIn 1183 Maria of Antioch was displaced by a new power behind the throne, Andronikos I Komnenos. Andronikos was a first cousin of Manuel and was known to have harbored imperial ambitions for himself. He is believed to have arranged the deaths by poisoning of Maria Porphyrogenita and her husband Renier; he certainly imprisoned, and soon afterwards executed, Maria of Antioch. Andronikos was crowned co-ruler with Alexios; then, in October of the same year, he had Alexios strangled. Anna was now 12, and the approximately 65-year-old Andronikos married her.\n\nAndronikos had previously been married (his first wife's name is unknown). He had had sexual relationships with two nieces (Eudokia Komnene and Theodora Komnene) and with Philippa of Antioch. Philippa was a daughter of Constance of Antioch and her first husband and consort Raymond of Poitiers; she was also a sister of Maria of Antioch and thus maternal aunt of Alexios. Andronikos had two sons by his first wife; he also had a young son and daughter from his affair with Theodora. His eldest son, Manuel already had a son of his own, the future Alexios I of Trebizond.\n\nAnna was Empress consort for two years, until the deposition of Andronikos in September 1185. In an attempt to escape the popular uprising that ended his rule, Andronikos fled from Constantinople with Anna and his mistress (known only as \"Maraptike\"). They reached Chele, a fortress on the Bithynian coast of the Black Sea, where they tried to take ship for the Crimea. Their ship was prevented from sailing by contrary winds. Andronikos was eventually captured and returned to the capital, where he was tortured and killed on 12 September 1185.\n\nAnna survived Andronikos' fall and is next heard of in 1193, when she is said by a Western chronicler to have become the lover of Theodore Branas, a military leader who fought on the Empire's northern frontier. They did not at first marry.\n\nAfter the fall of Constantinople in 1204, Agnes derived respect from the Latin barons due to her being a former empress. According to Robert of Clari, Agnes had a bad reputation and could only talk through a translator because she did not know French. At that time she was 30 years old and had spent most of her life in the Byzantine court.\n\nAnna and Theodore eventually married, at the urging of the Latin emperor Baldwin I of Constantinople, in summer 1204. Theodore Branas continued to fight for the Latin Empire, and is last heard of in 1219, by which time Agnes has already disappeared from the historical record. They had at least one daughter, who married Narjot de Toucy.\n\nHer date of death is sometimes given in modern genealogies as \"1220\" or \"after 1240\". No primary source for these dates has been identified.\n\nThe crusader Robert of Clari, writing only 25 years after the event, is clear about the rich entourage that accompanied Agnes to Constantinople:\n\nHowever, in that account the embassy is attributed to Agnes' brother, Philip II of France, though Philip did not succeed to the French throne until 18 September 1180.\n\nAgnes is the subject of the historical novel \"Agnes of France\" (1980) by Greek writer Kostas Kyriazis (b. 1920). The novel describes the events of the reigns of Manuel, Alexios and Andronikos through her eyes. She is also part of the cast of the sequels \"Fourth Crusade\" (1981) and \"Henry of Hainaut\" (1984). All three have been in print in Greece since their first edition.\n\n\n"}

It boasts two Munro summits: the higher peak Sgorr Dhearg () lies about east of Sgorr Dhonuill (Sgurr Dhòmhnaill).\n\nThe mountain forms a horseshoe shape, with ridges pointing north enclosing the corrie of Gleann a' Chaolais (Glenachulish). The lower slopes on this side are cloaked in conifer plantations. To the south the mountain forms a steep ridge forming the northern wall of Glen Duror, which is also forested.\n\nThere are several routes up Beinn a' Bheithir. One of the simplest is to head through the forestry up Gleann a' Chaolais, reaching the high bealach between the two summits. Both summits can be bagged from here, and the walker may descend by the route of ascent.\n\nOther routes on include the north and northwest ridges of Sgorr Dhearg, or a steep ascent from Glen Duror.\n\nThe mountain at whose base tourists to Glencoe are landed was first called Beinn Ghuilbin but is now known as Beinn Bheithir. By tradition it got this name from a dragon which, long ago, took shelter in Corrie Liath, a great hollow in the face of the mountain and almost right above Ballachulish Pier. This dragon was apparently a terror to the surrounding district. From the lip of the corrie she overlooked the path round the foot of the mountain and, if the unsuspecting traveller attempted to pass by her, she would leap down and tear him to pieces.\n\nNo one dared attack her nor could anyone tell how she might be destroyed until Charles, the Skipper, came the way. He anchored his vessel a good distance out from the site of the present pier and, between the vessel and the shore, formed a bridge of empty barrels lashed together with ropes and brisling with iron spikes. When the bridge was finished he kindled a large fire on board the vessel and placed pieces of flesh on the burning embers. As soon as the savour of burning flesh reached the corrie the dragon descended by a succession of leaps to the shore and thence tried to make her way out on the barrels to the vessel. But the spikes entered her body and tore her up so badly that she was nearly dead before she reached the outer edge of the bridge. Meantime the vessel was moved from the bridge until a wide interval was left between it and the last barrel. Over this interval the dragon had not sufficient strength left to leap to the deck of the vessel and, as she could not return the way she came, she died of her wounds where she was, at the end of the bridge.\n\nThe people who lived in the neighbourhood of the mountain felt now at peace. But, if they did, little did they know of the new danger which threatened them. The cause of this new danger was a whelp which the old dragon left behind her in Corrie Liath. In course of time the whelp became a full-grown dragon which had a brood of young dragons hidden away in a corn stack at the foot of the mountain. When the farmer discovered them in his stack he at once set fire to it hoping thus to destroy the dangerous vermin it contained. Their shrieking was, with the wind, borne up the mountain-side and, as soon as it reached their mother, down she rushed to their assistance. But she was long in reaching them and in spite of all her efforts they were burned to death. When she saw this she stretched herself on a flat rock near the shore and continued to lash the rock with her tail until she killed herself.\n\nThe rock is still known as the Dragon's Rock, and on it Beinn Bheithir House now stands.\n"}
{"id": "1845039", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1845039", "title": "Subiaco, Lazio", "text": "Subiaco, Lazio\n\nSubiaco is a town and \"comune\" in the Metropolitan City of Rome, in Lazio, central Italy, from Tivoli alongside the river Aniene. It is a tourist and religious resort thanks to its sacred grotto (Sacro Speco), in the medieval , and for the Abbey of Santa Scolastica.\n\nAt a time when several German monks had been assigned to the monastery, German printers established a printing press in the town. They printed the first books in Italy in the late 15th century.\n\nAmong the first ancient settlers in the area were the Aequi, an Italic people. In 304 BC they were conquered by the Romans, who introduced their civilization and took advantage of the waters of the Aniene river. The present name of the city comes from the artificial lakes of the luxurious villa that emperor Nero had built: in Latin \"Sublaqueum\" means \"under the lake.\" The name was applied to the town that developed nearby. The biggest of the three Subiaco Dams was the highest dam in the world until its destruction in 1305. After the fall of the Roman Empire, the villa and the town were abandoned, becoming almost forgotten ruins.\n\nWhen St. Benedict, at the age of fourteen (c. 494), retired from the world and lived for three years in a cave above the river Anio, he was supplied with the necessaries of life by a monk, St. Roman. From this grotto, St. Benedict developed the concepts and organization of the Benedictine Order. He built twelve monasteries, including one at the grotto, and placed twelve monks in each. In 854 a record noted its renovation. In this year, Pope Leo IV is said to have consecrated an altar to Sts. Benedict and Scholastica and another to St. Sylvester. Another renovation took place in 1053 under Abbot Humbert of St. Scholastica. Abbot John V, created cardinal by Pope Gregory VII, made the grotto the terminus of a yearly procession, built a new road, and had the altars reconsecrated.\n\nIn 1200 there was a community of twelve, which Innocent III made a priory; John XXII in 1312 appointed a special abbot to the monks. A new road was built by the city in 1688. The sacred grotto is still a favourite pilgrimage. On October 27, 1909, Pius X granted a daily plenary indulgence to those who receive Holy Communion there and pray according to the intention of the Pope (Acta. Ap. Sedis, II, 405).\n\nThe Abbey of St. Scolastica, located about a mile and a half below the grotto, was built originally by St Benedict about 520, and endowed by the Roman patricians, Tertullus and Æquitius. The second abbot, St. Honoratus, changed the old monastery into a chapter room and built a new one, dedicating it to Sts. Cosmas and Damian. It was destroyed by the Lombards in 601 and abandoned for a century. By order of John VII, it was rebuilt by Abbot Stephen and consecrated to Saints Benedict and his sister, Scholastica. Demolished again in 840 by the Saracens and then in 981 by the Hungarians, it was rebuilt each time.\n\nBenedict VII consecrated the new church, and henceforth the abbey was dedicated to Santa Scholastica. In 1052, Leo IX came to Subiaco to settle various disputes and to correct abuses; a similar visit was made by Gregory VII. Special favour was shown by Paschal II, who took the abbey from the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Tivoli and made it an abbacy nullius. Its temporal welfare was also a care of the popes. Among others, Innocent III at his visit in 1203 increased the revenues of the abbey.\n\nWith the decline of religious fervor, strife and dissension arose to such an extent that Abbot Bartholomew in 1364, by command of the pope, had to dismiss some of the incorrigible monks and fill their places with religious from other monasteries. Numerous monks were brought in from Germany, and for many decades Subiaco was a center of German thrift, science, and art. Urban VI (1378–1389) abolished the abbots for life, took away from the monks the right of election, and gave the administration and revenues to a member of the Curia.\n\nThe assignment of German monks to Subiaco attracted other Germans. The printers Sweinheim and Pannartz established a printing press in Subiaco and printed \"Donatus pro parvulis\", \"Lactantius\" (1465) and \"De Civitate Dei\" (1467). Those were the first books to be printed in Italy.\n\nPope Callixtus III, in 1455, gave the abbey in commendam to a cardinal. The first of these was the Spanish Cardinal Juan de Torquemada and the second Roderigo Borgia (later Alexander VI), who remodeled the Castrum Sublacence, once the summer resort of the popes, and made it the residence of the commendatory abbot. Many of these abbots cared little for the religious life of the monks and looked only for revenue. As an example, Pompeo Colonna, Bishop of Rieti, commendatory abbot since 1506, squandered the goods of the abbey and gave the income to unworthy subjects. On complaint of the community, in 1510 Julius II readjusted matters and restored the monastic possessions. For spiritual benefit, a union had been made between Subiaco and the Abbey of Farfa, but it lasted a short time. In 1514, Subiaco joined the Congregation of Santa Justina, whose abbot-general was titular of St. Scholastica, while a cardinal remained commendatory abbot. Even after this union, there were quarrels between Subiaco and Farfa, Subiaco and Monte Cassino, essentially among the Germans and the Italians.\n\nAfter this little is known from historical records about the abbey and the city until the 19th century. In 1798-1799 and 1810-1814 French troops under Napoleon entered the city, plundering the monasteries and the churches. In 1849 and 1867 Giuseppe Garibaldi conquered the city in his plan to destroy the temporal rule of the Pope and unify Italy: in 1870 the city become definitively part of the Regno d'Italia.\n\nIn 1891, a Benedictine abbey founded earlier in western Arkansas, United States, changed its name to Subiaco as part of an effort to more closely align its teachings and practices to those of the famous abbeys of the Italian namesake.\n\nIn the first years of the 20th century, the area was improved by national investment in infrastructure, with the connection to a railway, a hydroelectric plant and an aqueduct. Electricity was brought to the houses and a hospital was built. In World War II, Subiaco was bombed by Allied planes.\n\nIn addition to the two abbeys, including Abbey of Santa Scolastica, also noteworthy are:\n\n\n"}

He was elected by the party's Executive Committee in January 1998, in place of Mike Hicks.\n\nGriffiths was born in Cardiff and grew up in the suburb of Llanrumney, where he attended Bryn Hafod primary school. Afterwards he attended Cardiff High School, and later went to the University of Bath to study economics. While at university he competed in boxing tournaments.\n\nHe joined Plaid Cymru in 1973, after being impressed by Emrys Roberts' campaign in the Merthyr Tydfil by-election. The following year in 1974, he began to work for Plaid Cymru as a parliamentary research officer. He stayed in the post until December 1979; it was a difficult year for the party, which had faced defeat in the Welsh devolution referendum and the loss of Gwynfor Evans' seat in the general election. With a reduced presence in Westminster the party had no need of a large parliamentary staff and Griffiths was made redundant.\n\nIn July 1979 he collaborated with Gareth Miles to publish \"Socialism for the Welsh People\", a pamphlet which was critical of Plaid Cymru for its \"opportunism\" and alleged subservience to the British state. The pamphlet called for the creation of a Welsh Socialist Republican Movement, which was founded by Griffiths, Miles and others in January 1980. Griffiths served as the organisation's secretary and wrote for its magazine 'the Arrow' ().\n\nDuring George Galloway's attempt to be selected as the Labour candidate for Rhondda in the 1983 general election, Griffiths brought him along to events and introduced him to local people. However, Galloway failed to win the selection, and instead Allan Rogers stood as the Labour candidate. Rogers became the seat's MP.\n\nThe was investigated by the police in relation to a bombing campaign and several of its members were arrested, including Robert Griffiths. However when the case was brought to trial in November 1983, Griffiths was found innocent of all charges. Partly as a result of these events, the Welsh Socialist Republican Movement dissolved. Griffiths joined the Communist Party of Great Britain shortly afterwards.\n\nHe has also previously served as Welsh president of the AUEW-TASS union.\n\nGriffiths was a speaker at the first Communist University in Wales, and he speaks regularly at national events of the Communist Party of Britain. He has also taken part in debates at the Oxford Union, Cambridge Union Society and Manchester Debating Union.\nIn February 2013, Griffiths was among those who gave their support to the People's Assembly in a letter published by \"The Guardian\" newspaper. He continues to be an active supporter of the People's Assembly nationally and is also active in his local People's Assembly in Cardiff.\n\nIn 2016, Griffiths was unveiled as the chair of \"Left Leave\", a campaign for the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union. The group is a coalition of political parties and organisations such as the Communist Party of Britain, the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers and the Respect Party.\n\nEuropean Parliament\n\nIn the 1994 election, he stood on behalf of the Communist Party in the single-member South Wales Central constituency, winning 1,073 votes or 0.6% of the total.

They practised their profession in the seaport of Aegeae, then in the Roman province of Syria.\n\nAccepting no payment for their services led to them being named \"anargyroi\" (from the Greek , 'the silverless' or 'unmercenaries'); it has been said that, by this, they attracted many to the Christian faith.\n\nNothing is known of their lives except that they suffered martyrdom in Syria during the persecution of the Emperor Diocletian. \nAccording to Christian traditions, the twin brothers were born in Arabia and became skilled doctors.\n\nSaladino d'Ascoli, a 15th century Italian physician, claims that the medieval electuary, a pasty mass consisting of a drug mixed with sugar and water or honey suitable for oral administration, known as opopira, a complex compound medicine used to treat diverse maladies including paralysis, was invented by Cosmas and Damian.\n\nDuring the persecution under Diocletian, Cosmas and Damian were arrested by order of the Prefect of Cilicia, one Lysias who is otherwise unknown, who ordered them under torture to recant. However, according to legend they stayed true to their faith, enduring being hung on a cross, stoned and shot by arrows and finally suffered execution by beheading. Anthimus, Leontius and Euprepius, their younger brothers, who were inseparable from them throughout life, shared in their martyrdom.\n\nThe veneration of Cosmas and Damian quickly spread beyond Constantinople; accounts of their martyrdom were rewritten by various authors such as Andrew of Crete, Peter of Argos, Theodore II Laskaris, and a certain Maximus around 1300. The legends are preserved also in Syriac, Coptic, Georgian, Armenian, and Latin.\n\nAs early as the 4th century, churches dedicated to the twin saints were established at Jerusalem, in Egypt and in Mesopotamia. Devotion to the two saints spread rapidly in both East and West. Theodoret records the division of their reputed relics. Their relics, deemed miraculous, were buried in the city of Cyrrus in Syria. Churches were built in their honor by Archbishop Proclus and by Emperor Justinian I (527–565), who sumptuously restored the city of Cyrus and dedicated it to the twins, but brought their purported relics to Constantinople; there, following his cure, ascribed to the intercession of Cosmas and Damian, Justinian, in gratitude also built and adorned their church at Constantinople, and it became a celebrated place of pilgrimage. At Rome Pope Felix IV (526–530) rededicated the Library of Peace (\"Bibliotheca Pacis\") as a basilica of Santi Cosma e Damiano in the Forum of Vespasian in their honour. The church is much rebuilt but still famed for its sixth-century mosaics illustrating the saints.\n\nWhat are said to be their skulls are venerated in the convent of the Clares in Madrid, where they have been since 1581, the gift of Maria, daughter of Emperor Charles V. They had previously been removed from Rome to Bremen in the tenth century, and thence to Bamberg. \nOther skulls said to be theirs were discovered in 1334 by Burchard Grelle, Archbishop of Bremen. He \"personally 'miraculously' retrieved the relics of the holy physicians Cosmas and Damian, which were allegedly immured and forgotten in the choir of the Bremen Cathedral. In celebration of the retrieval Archbishop and Chapter arranged a feast at Pentecost 1335, when the relics were translated from the wall to a more dignified place. Grelle claimed the relics were those Archbishop Adaldag brought from Rome in 965. The cathedral master-builder Johann Hemeling made a shrine for the relics, which was finished around 1420. The shrine, made from carved oak wood covered with gilt and rolled silver is considered an important mediaeval gold work. In 1649 Bremen's Chapter, Lutheran by this time, sold the shrine without the heads to Maximilian I of Bavaria. The two heads remained in Bremen and came into the possession of the small Roman Catholic community. They were shown from 1934 to 1968 in the Church of St. Johann and in 1994 they were buried in the crypt. The shrine is now shown in the Jesuit church of St Michael in Munich. At least since 1413 another supposed pair of skulls of the saints has been stored in St Stephens's Cathedral in Vienna. Other relics are claimed by the Church of San Giorgio Maggiore in Venice.\n\nThe martyr twins are invoked in the Canon of the Mass in the prayer known as the \"Communicantes\" (from the first Latin word of the prayer): \"In communion with the whole Church, they venerate above all others the memory of the glorious ever-virgin Mary, Mother of our God and Lord, Jesus Christ, then of blessed Joseph, husband of the Virgin, your blessed Apostles and Martyrs, Peter and Paul, Andrew, James, ...John and Paul, \"Cosmas and Damian\" and all your Saints: grant through their merits and prayers that in all things we may be defended by the help of your protection.\" They are also invoked in the Litany of the Saints, and in the older form of the Roman rite, in the Collect for Thursday in the Third Week of Lent, as the station church for this day is Santi Cosma e Damiano.\n\nTheir feast day in the General Roman Calendar, which had been on September 27, was moved in 1969 to September 26, because September 27 is the \"dies natalis\" (\"day of birth\" into Heaven) of Saint Vincent de Paul, now more widely venerated in the Latin Church. In Canada it has been moved to Sept. 25 (as Sept. 26 is the Feast of the Canadian Martyrs in Canada).\n\nSts Cosmas and Damian are regarded as the patrons of physicians, surgeons, and pharmacists and are sometimes represented with medical emblems.\n\nIn Brazil, the twin saints are regarded as protectors of children, and September 27 is commemorated, especially in Rio de Janeiro, by giving children bags of candy with the saints' effigy printed on them and throughout the entire state of Bahia where Catholics and adepts of Candomblé religion offer typical food such as caruru.\nThe ritual consists of first offering the food to seven children that are no older than seven years old and then having them feast while sitting on the floor and eating with their hands. Only after all children have finished can the guests enjoy the food that is being offered. The Church of Saints Cosmas and Damian, in Igarassu, Pernambuco is Brazil's oldest church, built in 1535.\n\nIn the UK St Damian is the dexter side supporter in the coat of arms of the British Dental Association.\n\nSts. Cosmas & Damian are venerated every year in Utica, New York at St. Anthony's Parish during the annual pilgrimage which takes place on the last weekend of September (close to the Sept. 27 feast day). There are thousands of pilgrims who come to honor the saints. Over 80 busloads come from Canada and other destinations. The 2-day festival includes music (La Banda Rosa), much Italian food, masses and processions through the streets of East Utica. It is one of the largest festivals honoring saints in the northeast USA.\n\nIn the Eastern Orthodox Church, Eastern Catholic Churches, and the Oriental Orthodox Churches, Saints Cosmas and Damian are venerated as a type of saint known as Unmercenary Physicians (, \"anargyroi,\" \"\"without money\"\"). This classification of saints is unique to the Eastern Church and refers to those who heal purely out of love for God and man, strictly observing the command of Jesus: \"Freely have you received, freely give.\" («Δωρεὰν ἐλάβετε, δωρεὰν δότε...» ) While each of the Unmercenaries has his own feast days, all are commemorated together on the first Sunday in November, in a feast known as the Synaxis of the Unmercenary Physicians.\n\nThe Orthodox celebrate no less than three different sets of saints by the name of Cosmas and Damian, each with their own distinct feast day:\n\n\nOrthodox icons of the saints depict them vested as laymen holding medicine boxes. Often each will also hold a spoon with which to dispense medicine. The handle of the spoon is normally shaped like a cross to indicate the importance of spiritual as well as physical healing, and that all cures come from God.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The division was created as part of the preparations for the Normandy invasion on 6 June 1944, D-Day. \n\nMajor-General Percy Hobart commanded the division and was in charge of the development of armoured vehicles that were solutions to problems of the amphibious landing on the defended French coastline; these unusual-looking tanks it developed and operated were known as \"Hobart's Funnies\". They included tanks that floated, could clear mines, destroy defences, carry and lay bridges, and roadways. The practical use of these specialist tanks was confirmed during the landings on the beaches. Its vehicles were distributed as small units across the divisions taking part in the landings and subsequent operations. The division remained in action during the North-west European Campaign, providing specialised support during assaults to the 21st Army Group and, occasionally, to American units outside 21st. Again they were of significant use during the Rhine crossings.\n\nThe division was formed as a standard armoured formation serving in the UK under Northern Command in August 1942. General Sir Alan Brooke, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, who foresaw the need for specialised armoured vehicles, offered command of the division to Major-General Percy Hobart in October 1942. \n\nInitially the division included infantry, artillery and engineers but the infantry unit, 185th, was removed in September 1942, its artillery regiments were all removed by April 1943 and its engineer units were generally removed by November 1943. \n\nHobart gave firm direction and the strange-looking tanks it developed and operated were known as Hobart's Funnies. They included tanks that floated, could clear mines, destroy defences, carry and lay bridges, and roadways - anything that would enable the invasion force to get ashore and break through the German defences. The division landed in France in June 1944. The division was further used during the Battle for Brest, the battle for the Scheldt estuary (Operation Infatuate), the battle for the Roer Triangle (Operation Blackcock), the Rhine crossings (Operation Plunder) and the Elbe crossing.\n\nThe 79th Armoured Division was disbanded on 20 August 1945. Hobart subsequently commanded the Specialized Armour Development Establishment (SADE), which was formed from elements of the 79th together with the Assault Training and Development Centre.\n\nThe equipment included the following:\n\n\nThe 79th Armoured Division was first raised as a conventional armoured division, with one Armoured Brigade, one Infantry Brigade and supporting arms.\n\n27th Armoured Brigade - Attached to the 79th Armoured Division from 8 September 1942 until 20 October 1943.\n\n185th Infantry Brigade - Transferred out to 3rd Infantry Division on 9 April 1943.\n\nHQ Royal Artillery – converted into 9th Army Group Royal Artillery on 1 May 1943\n\n30th Armoured Brigade - Transferred to the division on 17 October 1943.\n\n1st Assault Brigade and Assault Park Squadron RE - Formed on 1 November 1943\n\n\nThe division was under direct command of the 21st Army Group, portions being placed in support of the Second Army for Operation Overlord.\n\n1st Assault Brigade and Assault Park Squadron RE (AVRE)\n\n30th Armoured Brigade (Sherman Crab)\n\nThis is the order of battle on 17 September 1944, at the beginning of Operation Market Garden.

Weatherhead was noted for his preaching ministry at City Temple in London and for his books, including \"The Will of God\", \"The Christian Agnostic\", and \"Psychology, Religion, and Healing\".\n\nWeatherhead was born in London in 1893. He trained for the Methodist ministry at Richmond Theological College, in south-west London. The First World War cut short his training, and he became Methodist minister at Farnham, Surrey, in September 1915. After serving in India, Manchester, and Leeds, Weatherhead became the minister of the City Temple, a Congregational Church on Holborn Viaduct in London. He served there from 1936 until his retirement in 1960. From 1930 till 1939, Weatherhead was a member of Frank Buchman's Oxford Group and wrote several books reflecting the group's values, including \"Discipleship\" and \"The Will of God\". He often symbolised the \"head\" of the Oxford Group London.\n\nHis book \"This is the Victory\" was first printed in 1940 (preface dated November 1940) and reprinted in March 1942. In the period of time between these two editions, the City Temple was \"gutted by fire from incendiary bombs dropped from enemy aeroplanes\". He was able to continue his ministry thanks to the nearby St Sepulchre-without-Newgate church. After the war, Weatherhead raised the funds to rebuild the City Temple, largely from John D. Rockefeller. The City Temple stands to this day and is now a congregation of the United Reformed Church.\n\nDespite opposition, Weatherhead was elected as President of the Methodist Conference for 1955–1956. The re-built City Temple was opened in the presence of the Queen Mother in 1958. In 1960, Weatherhead retired to live at Bexhill-on-Sea. He died in 1976.\n\nThe three books of his sermons which Weatherhead considered his best were \"That Immortal Sea\", \"Over His Own Signature\" and \"Key Next Door\".\n\nThree biographies of Leslie Weatherhead have appeared: in 1960, for young people, \"Dr. Leslie Weatherhead of the City Temple\" by Christopher Maitland; in 1975 \"Leslie Weatherhead: A Personal Portrait\" by his son A. Kingsley Weatherhead, a professor of English; and most recently in 1999 \"Doctor of Souls: Leslie D. Weatherhead 1893–1976\" by John C. Travell.\n\nWeatherhead is identified as a liberal Christian. He believed in God, whom he felt most comfortable referring to as \"Father.\" Like most Christians, he felt that the Creator was higher on a scale of values, but that God must also be personal enough to interact in a direct relationship with people. Weatherhead understood that God cared for humankind but that some would find this difficult (since suffering exists in the world). If \"God is love\" it would be difficult to deny God's Providence.\n\nWeatherhead believed in the divinity of Christ, in that he (Jesus) stood in a special relationship with God and \"indeed an incarnation of God in a fuller sense than any other known Being.\" Weatherhead pointed out that the New Testament never refers to Jesus as God and neither did Jesus refer to himself in this way. Jesus called himself the Son of Man and the Word. To say that Jesus was the \"only begotten son\" of God would be an impossibility, as such information is not presently available. The virgin birth was not an issue for Weatherhead, having (in his view) never been a major tenet for being a follower of Christ. Moreover, the New Testament traces Jesus' lineage through his father Joseph, not Mary, to show that he descended from the house of David. Weatherhead notes that Jesus did not claim to be sinless. He comments on the fact that Jesus got angry, cursed a fig tree because it didn't produce fruit and rebuked Peter, one of his closest disciples, calling him Satan. Since Jesus was morally superior, many theologians assume him to be sinless, though Jesus never made that claim for himself. Weatherhead apparently agreed with Dr. Nathaniel Mickelm, whom he quoted regarding the blood sacrifice of Jesus as something that was unnecessary for forgiveness. For Mickelm (and subsequently for Weatherhead), it would be a perversion of God to suppose that \"God did not and could not forgive sins apart from the death of Christ.\" Yet that sacrifice revealed something of the nature of God that made one want to be forgiven. \nAs for the Holy Spirit, Weatherhead conceded agnosticism. \"Few Christians, whom I know, think of the Holy Spirit as a separate Person,\" he said. His view was that this would equate to worshiping two gods instead of one.\n\nHis view of the church was an idealistic one. The church on earth should be a photocopy of the divine original, in which all who loved Christ would be joined together to \"worship and move forward to the unimaginable unity with God which is his will.\"\n\nReformed minister Ian Paisley, later Lord Bannside, denounced Weatherhead in a 1969 sermon as \"the man that said that Jesus Christ was the bastard son of Zechariah (John the Baptist's father) – and Mary, who was a prostitute of the temple... That is about as vile a thing as anybody could say.\" He called Weatherhead \"an arch-apostate\", whose place was \"in hell\".\n\nIn his own view, Weatherhead had made every effort to present Mary as a very pure and sincere (if immature) young maiden—who had simply interpreted the Angel's Annunciation as a divine instruction to go and stay for three months with her cousin's husband, Zechariah—and that was when Jesus was conceived. Weatherhead regarded it as significant that the Gospels contain absolutely no record of Jesus mentioning that his mother had conceived him without a human father.\n\nWeatherhead's theory that Jesus was the son of Zechariah later became part of the teachings of Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church. Encountering it in Weatherhead's \"The Christian Agnostic\", Unificationist theologian Young Oon Kim adopted it as the best explanation of the birth of Jesus in her work \"Unification Theology\", a standard textbook of the church. Christian author Ruth A. Tucker comments in her book \"Another Gospel\": \"Kim's Christology is a prime example of liberal theology... By diminishing the role of Jesus, Kim paves the way for the exaltation of Sun Myung Moon.\"\n\nWeatherhead believed the Bible to be an inspired collection of works that progressively revealed man's search for and understanding of God, culminated in the best representation of God's true nature in Jesus Christ. He was, however, critical of many passages including some from Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy because they went against the nature of what Jesus taught, stating that \"some of the passages of Browning are of far superior spiritual value.\" Weatherhead insisted that one must reject anything in the Bible that did not coincide with the gospel of Christ, that is, anything that did not harmonise with the spirit of \"love, liberty, gaiety, forgiveness, joy and acceptance.\"\n\nWeatherhead was a highly controversial figure on account of his questioning of some of the central tenets of the Christian faith—he once said he regarded \"creeds and confessions of faith\" as \"museum specimens\"—and his incorporation into Christianity of elements from other religions and from spiritualism.\n\nIn the view of Professor David D. Larsen, of Trinity Evangelical Divinity School, \"Weatherhead jettisoned historical Christianity\". He denied the Atonement and the efficacy of the Blood of Christ in \"A Plain Man Looks at the Cross\", and the bodily Resurrection of Christ in \"The Manner of the Resurrection in the Light of Modern Science and Psychical Research\". He dismissed the virgin birth, was inclined to believe that Zechariah was the father of Jesus, thought that the \"legion\" of demons probably meant that the man had been molested as a child by Roman legionnaires, and regarded the Apostle Paul as hopelessly neurotic. Weatherhead regularly attended spiritist séances, at one of which John Wesley appeared to him. In 1957 he gave a lecture to the City Temple Literary Society on \"The Case for Reincarnation\". He continued to advocate reincarnation for the rest of his life in books like \"The Christian Agnostic\" and \"Life Begins at Death\".\n\nFor Professor Horton Davies, Weatherhead was \"unrivalled as a twentieth-century physician of souls and preacher of the integration of personality through Christ\". Professor Larsen, however, while agreeing that Weatherhead was \"a brilliant preacher\", judges his sermons to be theologically \"vacuous and empty\". Weatherhead, he writes, was perhaps the most striking example in the British Isles of \"the increasing horizontalization and psychologization of the sermon\", a tendency wittily characterised by E. Brooks Holifield as \"From Salvation to Self-Realization\". Weatherhead's scorn for theology—he claimed that poets had more insight than theologians—and penchant for \"preaching as psychotherapy\" made him, in Larsen's view, \"a tragic instance in which psychical research replaced 'sound doctrine'\". Even his psychology, which drew on fringe thinkers as well as more mainstream figures like Freud, is now \"severely dated. No one today talks about Odic force and the leakage of psychic energy. His 55 books are virtually unread today.\"\n\nJohn Taylor, reviewing \"Doctor of Souls\" states that \"[Weatherhead's] writings still have an impact on Churches today, and Christians read and re-read his works\". Nevertheless, though Weatherhead was a \"great man\", he \"remains an enigma... His name and ministry still enable passions to arise, depending how you see him.\" As Minister of \"a supra-denominational church\" like the City Temple, \"he was largely free to follow his own agenda\", which he did, \"not accepting the doctrine of the Virgin Birth, nor being comfortable with the doctrine of the Trinity\". He was \"a rebel, breaking out from the confines of Methodism\", and impossible to imagine \"in a traditional Congregational church\".\n\nWeatherhead wrote many books, including:\n\n\n\n"}

The Siberian region is rich in resources, including coal, oil and metal ores\n\nSiberia’s contribution to the Soviet economy in percent of national output was given in Soviet statistical yearbooks for 1973 (1940 in brackets) as: Coal 33% (23%), Coking coal 30% (17%), Oil 21% (1.6%), Natural gas 8.5% (from 1.5% in 1950), Electric power output 18% (6.6%), Iron ore 6.9% (1.6%), Pig iron 9.5% (10%), Crude steel 8.3% (10%), Rolled steel 10% (9.1%). But regional breakdowns were omitted in the yearbooks from 1973, except for a few 1975 figures.\n\nIn the important Chelyabinsk coalfields, production rose from 390,000 tonnes in 1925 to 3,519,000 tonnes in 1936. The total production for the East Urals was 8,080,000 tonnes in 1937. Reserves for the following coalfields are shown in millions of tonnes:\n\n\nThe development of the coal fields of Kuznetsk Basin, (sometimes called the \"Kuzbass\") transformed the Siberian steppe. The south sector of the Trans-Siberian Railway became a great industrial center because of the activity surrounding the coalfields. These ancient reserves of 13,000,000,000 tonnes grew to 450,658,000,000 tonnes. In 1937, the 50 mines in this area produced a total of 17,300,000 tonnes. The coal production of this zone was comparable with that of all of British India, and half of that produced by Japan. Kuznetsk coal was the best in the USSR, with high energy and low sulphur content. The total anthracite reserve was 54 million tonnes; and was used in the Ural-Kuznetsk Metallurgical Combine. Siberia is also the coldest winters to survive, this includes freezing temperature such as -50 degrees.\n\nAnother important reserve is at Karaganda near the Magnitogorsk (Magnet City) Higt Ovens. Production in 1937 was 3,937,200 tonnes. Other important coal deposits are: Minusinsk near Chernogorsk, which joins the mining zone of Chulym-Yenisei at the Yenisei river; the Kansk deposits north of Krasnoyarsk; the Irkutsk deposits, which yielded 3,000,000 tonnes from the Cheremkovo mine in 1937; the Lake Baikal deposits; the Lena sector; the Norilsk sector in Tunguska mining zone; the Sangar Khai founts in the Amur River and Bureya Rivers near Vladivostok, the Artem and Suchan mines with 1937 production of 2,110,000 tonnes and 590,000 tonnes respectively; and the Sakhalin coal deposits in the Pamir and Tian Shan mountains in central Asia.\n\nIn the Minusinsk area, the estimated reserves are 20,612,000,000 tonnes; the Chulym-Yenisei mine is estimated at 43,000,000,000 tonnes; the Kansk sources estimated at 42,000,000,000 tonnes; and Cheremkhovo estimated at 79,000,000,000 tonnes. The Kuznets area has excellent coal for coke, chemical and gas production. Production in 1913 was 774,000 tonnes. In 1927, these mines extracted about 2,600,000 tonnes to maintain one extraction of 16,800,000 tonnes. The modernized Prokopyevsk mine has an expected production capacity of about 3,200,000 tonnes. The other sources are in Stalinsk (Kuznets), Lenin-Kuznets, Kemerovo, Anzhero-Sudzhensk, Chernogorsk, and Cheremkhovo\n\nThe Siberian petroleum sources follow (in metric tonnes - 1 metric tonne of petroleum is equivalent to 5 or 10 barrels, or 42 gallons, depending on the density)\n\n\nTable of Total production (for 45 oil well areas)\n\nThe most important Siberian petroleum zones are the West Siberian petroleum basin, Central Urals, Sakhalin Island, Nordvyl on the Arctic Siberian coast, and the Kamchatka peninsula. From the Caspian Sea there is one oil pipeline, which continues to the petrol camps of Emba at Orsk and ends in Omsk, in western Siberia. Sakhalin Island has the most important oil reserves in the Russian Far East. In 1936, the Ohka oil wells extracted about 470,000 tonnes; one-third were obtained for Japanese concessionaires. In the Emba River area about 466,000 tonnes were extracted from about 20 pits of a total of 300 yaciments in 1937.\n\nTotal USSR oil production was 230,700,000 tonnes and there exist other reserves of 652,000,000 tonnes.\n\nThe third source of energy is hydro electricity. The region boasts large rivers capable of accommodating in-river hydro plants of 1000 MW and more per project. This potential was realised at an early stage, leading to investigations into the hydro potential of Pamir Tien-Shan and other East Siberian hydro resources. Today these hydro systems contribute roughly 40% of the electricity produced in Russia's Second Electricity Zone (Siberia) and helps to explain why the wholesale electricity prices in Zone 2 are structurally cheaper than in Zone 1 (European Russia). \n\nIn 2011, Russia's electricity consumption totalled 1022 TWh, of which Hydropower contributed 63TWh. These energy producing and disposes in 50% of time raised in about 280.690 gigawatts (GW), between of theirs based in one disposition of 95% stay 58 GW.\n\nTo increase output, studies were made of the Lena, Yenisei and Ob river systems. In the Lenin Program in 1920, proposed construction of power systems in the Urals, Yenisei, Angara River and Lake Baikal. Some of these projects are similar to the Grand Coulee Dam in the Columbia River.\n\nA major hydroelectric powerplant was constructed in 1932 on the Dnieper River, at a high latitude in Zaporozhe. But it was destroyed in 1941 by retreating Soviet forces during World War II. The plant had a production capacity of 900 MW, was about 2,500 feet long, and rose 125 feet above water level. In 1940 the total production capacity was 2.5 GW. The new plan proposed plants on a gigantic scale, on the Angara river. Planned output was 9 GW, with four other plants in high Yenisei producing about 4 GW more.\n\nSiberian iron sources were more assorted. They are at Magnitogorsk, Nizhni Tagil deposits in the south of Kuznetsk, the Angara River reserves, and Russian Far East mines.\n\nThe mines of the Urals have been known since 1702: Magnitogorsk\nwith annual extraction of 6,000,000 tonnes in 1931, minerals being \nmagnetite and secondarily martite, with 55% or 66% of iron content. The\nother and oldest center was in Ninshi-Tagil. The total Ural iron reserves were 1,390,670,000 tonnes, of which one-third are limonite\nand about 450,000,000 correspond directly at Magnitogorsk. When the deposits\nin Kuznets began to be exploited, in 1930 recent discovered the Mountainous Shoria iron deposits, with reserves calculated as 292,412,000\ntonnes, 45% iron content, and the Karaganda deposits. The other \nimportant founts stay in Petrovsk-Zabaikal near Baikal Lake, and\nthe Little Khingan Mountains in the Soviet side of the frontier.\n\nOther iron resources in East Siberia are the Angara and Ilim river areas northwest of Baikal Lake, with production of 420,850,000 tonnes. No less than 30% of USSR iron production in the USSR was obtained in the Kuznets zone in 1937.\n\nIron deposits:\n\n\nThe existence of coal, estimated at 400,000,000,000 tonnes, was about a quarter of the Asian total, or half of the European reserves. The principal coal mining valleys and basins are:\n\nDuring the interwar years, major production was in the Kuznetsk Basin; the Carboniferous Basin of Irkutsk extends joining\nat Transiberian railway, in 480 km, and the Maritime province near the Vladivostok area.\n\nPetrol is encounter on north section of Sakhalin island, and their exploitation are accord topic between Japanese and Russians. Other sources are in the Kamchatka or Ohkostk coasts, but the rest of Siberia did not promise much, with the exception of petrol pits in Central Asia or the Urals. These last (referring to the Turkestan zone) are one extension of Caucasian petrol zone and the mentioned Ural petrol sources.\n\nGold is often found in Siberia; currently the principal mining districts are in the Patom Highlands (Olekma-Vitim region of the Lena Valley). During the period 1910-1914, the Siberian gold mines extracted an average of 46,655 kg and employed 57,000 workers. Exploited deposits are of placer gold. The joint British Russian Company, Lena Gold Mining Joint Stock Company (Lenzoloto), owned and operated the \"Lena Goldfields\" -- much of the region's gold production. Their mistreatment of workers ultimately led to the Lena massacre which ignited the Russian Revolution; the British shareholders secured compensation from the Soviet government in 1935. Russia remains the second biggest gold producer in the world, while using modern workplace standards.\n\nEspecially important in the Kirguises Steppes, in the Altai ranges and the Yenisei river basin.\n\nZinc is a natural resource.\n\nStay more distributed and are exploited. The most important are Telbes Mine (Kuznetsk coal basin), Minusinsk, Yenisei\nvalley, Olga territory (Maritime Province) and the Irkutsk area.\n"}

{"id": "1845092", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1845092", "title": "Political geography", "text": "Political geography\n\nPolitical geography is concerned with the study of both the spatially uneven outcomes of political processes and the ways in which political processes are themselves affected by spatial structures. Conventionally, for the purposes of analysis, political geography adopts a three-scale structure with the study of the state at the centre, the study of international relations (or geopolitics) above it, and the study of localities below it. The primary concerns of the subdiscipline can be summarized as the inter-relationships between people, state, and territory.\n\nThe origins of political geography lie in the origins of human geography itself, and the early practitioners were concerned mainly with the military and political consequences of the relationships between physical geography, state territories, and state power. In particular there was a close association with both regional geography, with its focus on the unique characteristics of regions, and environmental determinism, with its emphasis on the influence of the physical environment on human activities. This association found expression in the work of the German geographer Friedrich Ratzel, who in 1897 in his book \"Politische Geographie\", developed the concept of Lebensraum (living space) which explicitly linked the cultural growth of a nation with territorial expansion, and which was later used to provide academic legitimisation for the imperialist expansion of the German Third Reich in the 1930s.\n\nThe British geographer Halford Mackinder was also heavily influenced by environmental determinism and in developing his concept of the 'geographical pivot of history' or the Heartland Theory (in 1904) he argued that the era of sea power was coming to an end and that land based powers were in the ascendant, and, in particular, that whoever controlled the heartland of 'Euro-Asia' would control the world. This theory involved concepts diametrically opposed to the ideas of Alfred Thayer Mahan about the significance of \"sea power\" in world conflict. The heartland theory hypothesized the possibility of a huge empire being created which didn't need to use coastal or transoceanic transport to supply its military–industrial complex, and that this empire could not be defeated by the rest of the world allied against it. This perspective proved influential throughout the period of the Cold War, underpinning military thinking about the creation of buffer states between East and West in central Europe.\n\nThe heartland theory depicted a world divided into a \"Heartland\" (Eastern Europe/Western Russia); \"World Island\" (Eurasia and Africa); \"Peripheral Islands\" (British Isles, Japan, Indonesia and Australia) and \"New World\" (The Americas). Mackinder argued that whoever controlled the Heartland would have control of the world. He used these ideas to politically influence events such as the Treaty of Versailles, where buffer states were created between the USSR and Germany, to prevent either of them controlling the Heartland. At the same time, Ratzel was creating a theory of states based around the concepts of Lebensraum and Social Darwinism. He argued that states were analogous to 'organisms' that needed sufficient room in which to live. Both of these writers created the idea of a political and geographical science, with an objective view of the world. Prior to World War II political geography was concerned largely with these issues of global power struggles and influencing state policy, and the above theories were taken on board by German geopoliticians (see Geopolitik) such as Karl Haushofer who - perhaps inadvertently - greatly influenced Nazi political theory, which was a form of politics seen to be legitimated by such 'scientific' theories.\n\nThe close association with environmental determinism and the freezing of political boundaries during the Cold War led to a significant decline in the perceived importance of political geography, which was described by Brian Berry in 1968 as a 'moribund backwater'. Although at this time in most other areas of human geography new approaches, including quantitative spatial science, behavioural studies, and structural Marxism, were invigorating academic research these were largely ignored by political geographers whose main point of reference remained the regional approach. As a result, most of the political geography texts produced during this period were descriptive, and it was not until 1976 that Richard Muir could argue that political geography was no longer a dead duck, but could in fact be a phoenix.\n\nFrom the late-1970s onwards, political geography has undergone a renaissance, and could fairly be described as one of the most dynamic of the sub-disciplines today. The revival was underpinned by the launch of the journal \"Political Geography Quarterly\" (and its expansion to bi-monthly production as \"Political Geography\"). In part this growth has been associated with the adoption by political geographers of the approaches taken up earlier in other areas of human geography, for example, Ron J. Johnston's (1979) work on electoral geography relied heavily on the adoption of quantitative spatial science, Robert Sack's (1986) work on territoriality was based on the behavioural approach, Henry Bakis (1987) showed the impact of information and telecommunications networks on political geography, and Peter Taylor's (e.g. 2007) work on World Systems Theory owed much to developments within structural Marxism. However, the recent growth in vitality and importance of this sub-discipline is also related to the changes in the world as a result of the end of the Cold War. With the emergence of a new world order (which as yet, is only poorly defined) and the development of new research agendas, such as the more recent focus on social movements and political struggles, going beyond the study of nationalism with its explicit territorial basis. There has also been increasing interest in the geography of green politics (see, for example, David Pepper's (1996) work), including the geopolitics of environmental protest, and in the capacity of our existing state apparatus and wider political institutions, to address any contemporary and future environmental problems competently.\n\nPolitical geography has extended the scope of traditional political science approaches by acknowledging that the exercise of power is not restricted to states and bureaucracies, but is part of everyday life. This has resulted in the concerns of political geography increasingly overlapping with those of other human geography sub-disciplines such as economic geography, and, particularly, with those of social and cultural geography in relation to the study of the politics of place (see, for example, the books by David Harvey (1996) and Joe Painter (1995)). Although contemporary political geography maintains many of its traditional concerns (see below) the multi-disciplinary expansion into related areas is part of a general process within human geography which involves the blurring of boundaries between formerly discrete areas of study, and through which the discipline as a whole is enriched.\n\nIn particular, contemporary political geography often considers:\n\nCritical political geography is mainly concerned with the criticism of traditional political geographies vis-a-vis modern trends. As with much of the move towards 'Critical geographies', the arguments have drawn largely from postmodern, post structural and postcolonial theories. Examples include:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1845099", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1845099", "title": "Torque tube", "text": "Torque tube\n\nA torque tube system is a power transmission and braking technology, that involves a stationary housing around the drive shaft, often used in automobiles with a front engine and rear drive, and rear brakes (with or without front brakes, which play no part in it). The torque tube consists of a large diameter stationary housing between the transmission and rear end that fully encloses a rotating tubular steel or small-diameter solid drive shaft that transmits the power of the engine to a regular or limited-slip differential. The purpose of a torque tube is to hold the rear end in place during acceleration and braking. Otherwise, the axle housing would suffer axle wrap, such that the front of the differential would lift up excessively during acceleration and sink down during braking. Its use is not as widespread in modern automobiles as is the Hotchkiss drive, which holds the rear end in place and prevents it from flipping up or down, during acceleration and braking, by anchoring the axle housings to the leaf springs using spring perches.\n\nThe \"torque\" that is referred to in the name is not that of the driveshaft, along the axis of the car, but that applied by the wheels. The engineering problem that the torque tube solves is how to get the traction forces generated by the wheels to the car frame. The torque moving the wheels and axles in a forward direction is met with an \"equal and opposite\" reaction of the axle housing and differential, making the differential want to spin in a reverse direction, in the same way that a cyclist \"pops a wheely\", lifting the bicycle in the air in the opposite direction from the turn of the wheel. The essential problem is how to keep the differential from rotating during acceleration and braking. The torque tube solves that problem by coupling the differential housing to the transmission housing and therefore propels the car forward by pushing up on the engine/transmission and then through the engine mounts to the car frame, with the reverse happening during braking. In contrast, the Hotchkiss drive transmits the traction forces to the car frame by using suspension components such as leaf springs or trailing arms.\n\nA type of ball and socket joint called a \"torque ball\" is used at one end of the torque tube to allow relative motion between the axle and transmission due to suspension travel. Later American Motors Rambler models (1962 through 1966) used a flange and cushion mount in place of the ball and socket. Since the torque tube does not constrain the car's body to the axle in the lateral (side-to-side) direction a panhard rod is often used for this purpose. The combination of the panhard rod and the torque tube allows the easy implementation of soft coil springs in the rear to give good ride quality, as in Buicks after 1937. Before 1937, Buicks used leaf springs, so the panhard rod was not used, though the torque tube allowed a cantilever spring suspension, which gives a softer ride than a center-mount axle on the leaf spring, as required by the Hotchkiss setup.\n\nIn addition to transmitting traction forces, the torque tube is hollow and contains the rotating driveshaft. Inside the hollow torque ball is the universal joint of the driveshaft that allows relative motion between the two ends of the driveshaft. In most applications the drive shaft uses a single universal joint which has the disadvantage that it causes speed fluctuations in the driveshaft when the shaft is not straight. The Hotchkiss drive uses two universal joints, which has the effect of canceling the speed fluctuations and gives a constant speed even when the shaft is no longer straight . V8-powered models of the 1963-1966 AMC Rambler used a double-Cardan constant velocity joint to eliminate driveshaft fluctuations, though six-cylinder and earlier V8 models used only one standard universal joint.\n\nThe torque tube design is typically heavier and securely ties the rear end together, thus providing for a rigid rear end and assuring good alignment under all conditions. However, because of the greater unsprung weight of the torque tube and radius rods, there may be a \"little hopping around of the rear end when cornering fast or on washboard roads\".\n\nExamples of the torque tube were the American cars of the Ford brand up through 1948, including over 19,000,000 Model Ts. Ford used the less expensive transverse springs that could not take forward thrust. For many of those years, Chevrolet used the torque tube, while Buick used it starting in 1906 (in the model D). The torque tube also allowed Buick, beginning in 1938, to use coil springs for a softer ride than traditional leaf springs, which can use a Hotchkiss drive, but coil springs cannot. Buick's use of a torque tube and coil springs became a Buick \"engineering trademark\", until it was dropped with the 1961 model year full-sized models. \nThe Nash 600 model adopted torque-tube drive in 1941 without an enclosed joint, but utilized a \"horizontal yoke at the front end of the torque tube is supported by rubber biscuits at each side.\"\n\nAfter the merger of Nash and Hudson in 1954, American Motors Corporation (AMC) continued to use the coil spring and torque tube rear suspension design on their large-sized cars (Rambler Classic and Ambassador) from the 1956 through the 1966 model year. The enclosed driveshaft made for more complicated gear swaps and hampered hot rodders. The discontinued torque-tube drive was replaced by a completely new open driveshaft and four-link axle-location system.\n\nThe Peugeot 403 and 404 models used a torque tube. The Peugeot 504, and Peugeot 505 estate/station wagons, as well as most export-market sedans also had torque tubes, while domestic and European-market sedan models had a transaxle and individual rear suspension.\n\nThe Chevrolet Chevette (1976-1988) and the similar Pontiac T-1000 used a torque tube and center bearing. This design was unlike any other Chevrolet model \"to isolate impacts to the rear wheels, cut down on road noise, and reduce engine vibration ... also allows a reduction in the height of the drive shaft and tunnel.\"\n\nThe continuing limited production of the Avanti switched to a new chassis in 1986 that utilized a torque tube along with an independent rear suspension.\n\nThe Mercedes SLS has a torque tube, but only to align the transaxle with the engine.\n\nSince 1996 the Chevrolet Corvette has used a torque tube since the introduction of the C5 version in the 1997 model year.\n"}

Young Petros attended Levon Vartuhiyan School in Topkapı, İstanbul and then the Bezaziyan and Getronagan schools. In October 1940 he was accepted as a seminarian in the Patriarchal Seminary of the St. James Brotherhood in Jerusalem.\n\nIn 1945 he was ordained a deacon and on January 22, 1950, he was elevated to the priesthood by Archbishop Mampre Sirounian, the Primate of Egypt.\n\nFrom 1946 to 1949, Father Karekin was the Assistant Dean of the Seminary of Jerusalem; he also taught at the Seminary as well as at the Tarkmançats School until 1951. For two years, he was the Chancellor of the Holy See of Jerusalem, the second Chairman of the General Assembly of the Brotherhood, and also a member of the Executive Council.\n\nResponding to an invitation by Archbishop Karekin Khachadourian, Patriarch of the Armenians in Turkey, Father Karekin returned to Istanbul in December 1951 to accept the position of Dean of the planned Holy Cross Seminary. Until the formal opening of the Seminary, which took place in January 1954, he taught at the Getronagan and Bezjian secondary schools and served as the Dean of classes for the preparation of priests at the Patriarchate. On the day of the opening of the Holy Cross Seminary, he received the rank of Dzayrakuyn Vartabed, supreme doctorate of Christian dogma, from Patriarch Karekin I.

His thesis for the rank of Dzayrakooyn Vartabed, was \"\"The Encyclicals of St. Nersess Shnorhali\"\", which he translated into modern Armenian with commentary. Bishop Karekin published religious and literary articles in several journals such as \"Dziadzan\", \"Sion\", \"Hayasdanyayts Yegeghetsi\", \"Nor Ashkharh\", and \"Marmara\".\n\nThrough his efforts, a beautiful Armenian church was built in Washington, D.C. in 1962.\n\nBishop Karekin was also instrumental in the construction of a new church in Sydney, Australia in 1972 and in Melbourne in 1976. During his tenure of office, a beautiful and magnificent building was purchased in Sydney to serve as headquarters of the Diocese of Australia. He exerted much effort to alleviate the mortgage on these buildings.\n\nFrom 1981 to September 5, 1990, he was the Grand Sacristan of the Holy See of Jerusalem.

Minor injuries can affect the second and third dorsal area in such a manner that the lymph patches concerned with coordination become either atrophic or relatively nonfunctioning. Tracheotomy can also cause aphonia.\n\nAny injury or condition that prevents the vocal cords, the paired bands of muscle tissue positioned over the trachea, from coming together and vibrating will have the potential to make a person unable to speak. When a person prepares to speak, the vocal folds come together over the trachea and vibrate due to the airflow from the lungs. This mechanism produces the sound of the voice. If the vocal folds cannot meet together to vibrate, sound will not be produced. Aphonia can also be caused by and is often accompanied by fear.\n\nPsychogenic aphonia is often seen in patients with underlying psychological problems. Laryngeal examination will usually show bowed vocal folds that fail to adduct to the midline during phonation. However, the vocal folds will adduct when the patient is asked to cough. Treatment should involve consultation and counseling with a speech pathologist and, if necessary, a psychologist.\n\nIn this case, the patient's history and the observed unilateral immobility rules out function aphonia.\n\n\n"}

The RAF Staff College, Andover was founded here in 1922, the first college to train officers in the administrative, staff and policy aspects of running an air force.\n\nRAF Andover saw action during the Second World War. Corporal Josephine Robins, one of only six members of the WAAF to win the Military Medal during the War, won her award for courage while rescuing people during an air-raid on the airfield in the Battle of Britain.\n\nThree squadrons of the Royal Canadian Air Force were formed at RAF Andover. Before and during the Battle of Normandy, RAF Andover was used by the United States Army Air Forces Ninth Air Force as an operational tactical fighter airfield. It was also known as USAAF Station 406, Pundit Code \"AV\". The code \"AV\" was broadcast in morse code by a mobile red light beacon at night, during the latter part of the War. The code was also painted on the airfield hangar nearest to the control tower, and remained visible until the hangars were demolished in 2001.\n\nThe site was redeveloped, and in 2009 part of it became Marlborough Lines, home to the Headquarters of the British Army.\n\nThe earliest known human activity on the site of Andover Airfield took place in the Bronze Age, according to archaeological evidence, which has uncovered significant Iron Age and later activity, including both an Anglo-Saxon and medieval cemeteries. Military activity on the site is certainly established with the construction during or shortly after 43 AD of the Portway (called on Andover Airfield \"Monxton Road\") Roman Road from Silchester (Calleva) to Old Sarum (Sorviodvnvm), which just north of the Airfield meets at East Anton Crossroads the Roman Road (Icknield Way) from Winchester (Venta) to Mildenhall (Cvnetio). The Andover sections of these roads were constructed by the Legio II Augusta Roman Legion.\n\nThe Royal Flying Corps (RFC) opened a station near Andover in August 1917 during the First World War. The station was mainly built by German prisoners of war, some of whom left their signatures in roof spaces of buildings on the station. It is close to the Armed Forces Chaplaincy Centre at Amport House and the Army Air Corps Centre at Middle Wallop.\n\nPlans for an RFC \"Training Depot Station\" on the airfield site had originally been made in 1912. The station motto was \"Vis et armis consilioque orta\" (). This is appropriate as the station was built as a Training Depot for aircrews, who had completed basic flying training, to learn to fly the Handley Page Type O and Airco D.H. 9 bombers. The first unit to occupy the station was No. 2 School of Navigation and Bomb Dropping. This unit took up residence while the station was still under construction.\n\nAmongst squadrons formed at Andover was 106 Squadron, formed on 30 September 1917, who were equipped with Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.8 reconnaissance aircraft for army co-operation duties, being posted to Ireland in May 1918. Also, from 24 December 1917 to 6 June 1918 Andover was host to a detachment of the 13th Aero Squadron of the Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps.\n\nIn early 1918 experiments were conducted with Handley Page Type O bombers, based at Andover and Cranwell, fitted with Radio Direction-Finding (RDF as it was called) equipment for night flying. The intention was to guide British bombers to and from Berlin, and early results led to 550 sets of RDF equipment being ordered by the United States Army Air Service, but the First World War ended before any attempts could be made to use the system operationally. This was the first attempt to develop a viable long-range electronic navigation system, of a kind that is today used routinely worldwide.\n\nBetween the wars, the airfield housed a number of RAF units, including from 1919 the RAF School of Navigation, as No. 2 School of Navigation and Bomb Dropping was retitled. The RAF Staff College was founded here on 1 April 1922, to provide staff training to selected officers, and eventually moved to the Bracknell in 1970. The formation of the Royal Air Forces Association followed a conversation in 1929 in the Sergeants’ Mess of RAF Andover.\n\nRAF Andover continued to be used for a variety of aeronautical research and flight testing. As part of this, several experimental military aircraft made their first flights from the airfield. Amongst them were: the \"Westland Yeovil\"; the \"Westland Witch\"; the \"Westland F.7/30\"; and all of the \"Westland-Hill Pterodactyl\" series of experimental flying wing aircraft.\n\nTwo experimental bomber squadrons were also based at RAF Andover in the late 1920s and early 1930s, No. 12 Squadron RAF and No. 101 Squadron RAF. 12 Squadron was based at RAF Andover from March 1924, operating Fairey Fawn light bombers. No. 13 Squadron was also based here for five years between 1924 and 1929, operating Armstrong Whitworth Atlas aircraft.\n\nThe Fairey Fox bombers of No. 12 Squadron was one of the two experimental bomber squadrons based on the station, these aircraft being significantly faster than all other contemporary fighters and bombers. To this day, 12 Squadron's official unit motto 'Leads the Field' and crest commemorates their time at RAF Andover by depicting the head of a Fox. The Fairey Fox was the first all metal aircraft in operational service and 12 Squadron was the only squadron to operate it. The aircraft was a private venture by Fairey, which had been demonstrated to the Squadron secretly during an 'At Home' at RAF Andover in 1925, when the Fox appeared in Royal Air Force markings and 12 Squadron colours. During the Air Defence of Great Britain exercise in 1928, the Squadron was tasked with the simulated bombing of London. To commemorate 12 Squadron's success in the exercise, the Commander in Chief of the Royal Air Force chose a Fox's face as the Squadron emblem.\n\nA typical annual training programme for 12 Squadron consisted of individual training in the autumn, working up to Squadron training in the summer consisting of bombing, formation flying, navigation exercises and gunnery. Experimental trials carried out included some limited night flying and the introduction into service and testing of parachutes for aircrew. This involved a number of practice jumps being performed by observers, who would climb out of the aircraft onto a small ladder and await a signal from the pilot as the aircraft flew over the airfield at 2000 ft. The observers carried no reserve parachutes, and the silk material from which the parachutes were constructed had a tendency to build up a static charge whilst in storage, such that when the ripcord was pulled, the silk stuck together. 12 Squadron was also tasked with further trials work, experimenting with oxygen systems, high altitude photography, and low temperature trials work, particularly in respect to lubricants. In addition, cloud flying in formation and pattern bombing techniques were tested.\n\nThe Foxes were replaced in January 1931 with the Hawker Hart, after which much work was put into formation flying in cloud, instrument flying, pattern bombing and aircraft icing trials. The purpose of these trials was to enable Royal Air Force aircraft to bomb an enemy ship successfully, regardless of weather. To this end, 12 Squadron dropped several practice bombs on an obsolete battleship, HMS \"Centurion\", which was a radio-controlled target off the south coast. On 6 July 1935, King George V performed the first Royal Review of the Royal Air Force, in which 12(B) Squadron led the Light Bomber Wing flypast at RAF Mildenhall. Several home-based squadrons, including 12 Squadron, were re-deployed in October 1935, to the Middle East and Aden in preparation for action being taken by the League of Nations against Italy for invading Abyssinia. 12 Squadron returned to RAF Andover in August 1936, and on its return took delivery of the Hawker Hind. It was around this time that the majority of B Flight were taken to form the nucleus of the newly formed No. 63 Squadron. In February 1938, the Squadron was re-equipped with Fairey Battles, the squadron leaving RAF Andover in May 1939.\n\nIn October 1929 No. 101 Squadron, the second experimental bomber squadron, was also posted to RAF Andover, to enable its Boulton-Paul Sidestrand bombers to work alongside 12 Squadron with its Fairey Fox light bombers. The high performance of the Sidestrand amazed crowds at the Hendon Air Pageants, where it flew mock combat aerobatics with the fighters of the day. 101 Squadron Sidestrands won a number of bombing and reconnaissance competitions and carried out trial anti-shipping strikes against Royal Navy battleships. In December 1934 the squadron left RAF Andover.\n\nDuring the Second World War, RAF Andover was the headquarters of RAF Maintenance Command. It was also used by several operational flying training units and as an operational fighter station by the United States Army Air Forces.\n\nThe Air Transport Auxiliary's (ATA) Central Ferry Control was also based at RAF Andover. A civilian organisation that unusually for the time included female pilots, the ATA ferried new, repaired and damaged military aircraft between factories, assembly plants, transatlantic delivery points, Maintenance Units (MUs), scrap yards, and active service squadrons and airfields. Central Ferry Control allocated the required flights to all ATA Ferry Pools.\n\nRAF Andover was one of four airfields in Hampshire to be given a decoy site in 1940, to deceive enemy aircraft into attacking a spurious target. Andover's decoy site was at Hurstbourne Tarrant, and was a type 'K' decoy site with fake aircraft and buildings. From September 1940, fake machine gun posts were added to Hurstbourne Tarrant.\n\nRAF Andover was attacked twice by the Luftwaffe during the Battle of Britain. At 1700 hours on 13 August 1940, approximately 12 high explosive bombs were dropped by Junkers Ju 88s of III Staffel, Lehrgeschwader 1, of Luftflotte 3, from Châteaudun in France. The Station Headquarters and officer's quarters were extensively damaged. One aircraft on the station was also damaged. Casualties were two killed. The following day, on 14 August 1940, RAF Andover was attacked again, about 15 high explosive bombs being dropped which destroyed a transmitting set in the centre of a group of radio masts, and killing a civilian radio operator.\n\nCorporal Josephine Robins, a Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF) telephone operator at RAF Andover was awarded the Military Medal for her courage during these raids. She was in a dug-out which received a direct hit, killing two men and injuring others. Despite dust and fumes filling the shelter, Cpl Robins calmly gave first aid to those injured and superintended their evacuation to safety. This was one of only six such awards to members of the WAAF in the entire Second World War.\n\nIt was thought at the time that these air raids were attempts to attack the important 11 Group Fighter Command Sector Station nearby at RAF Middle Wallop, but German records make it clear that RAF Andover was the intended target, as the Luftwaffe thought wrongly that it was an operational bomber station. In 1941 RAF Andover was attacked twice, causing heavy damage to one hangar, which had to be demolished.\n\nIn June 1941 No. 2 School of Army Co-operation at Andover was re-designated as No. 6 Operational Training Unit (OTU). It was equipped with Bristol Blenheims and operated within No. 17 Group, Coastal Command. Its task was to re-train Westland Lysander pilots onto Bristol Blenheim Mk. Vs used in the ground attack role, serving primarily in the used primarily in the Middle East and Far East. No 6 OTU was absorbed into No. 42 OTU on 18 July 1941, moving to RAF Ashbourne in October 1942.\nFrom February through July 1944, Andover was used by fighter squadrons (the 401st, 402nd, and 485th squadrons of the 370th Fighter Group) of the 71st Fighter Wing of the Ninth Air Force of the United States Army Air Forces, flying Lockheed P-38 Lightning aircraft. Flying from RAF Andover, the 370th dive-bombed radar installations and flak towers, and escorted bombers that attacked bridges and marshalling yards in France as the Allies prepared for the invasion of the Continent. The 370th also provided cover for Allied forces that crossed the English Channel on D-Day and flew armed reconnaissance missions over the Cotentin Peninsula until the end of the month. The 370th Fighter Group moved to their Advanced Landing Ground (ALG) at Cardonville, France (ALG A-3) on 20 July.\n\nThe USAAF lost a total of 31 P-38s from Andover before the move to France. \"(See weblink below to USAAF photos documenting RAF Andover's use as a fighter station, taken in 1944 by Cyril Bernard \"Cy\" Coenen of the 402nd Fighter Squadron).\"\n\nThree Canadian Army Air Observation Post (AOP) Squadrons of the Royal Canadian Air Force, No. 664 Squadron RCAF, No. 665 Squadron RCAF, and No. 666 Squadron RCAF were formed at RAF Andover between 9 December 1944 and 5 March 1945. The Canadian squadrons were equipped with Auster Mark IV and V aircraft. The pilots and observers in the squadrons were officers recruited from the Royal Canadian Artillery and O.R.s from the Royal Canadian Artillery and Royal Canadian Air Force. The pilots were trained to fly de Havilland Tiger Moth aircraft at No. 22 Elementary Flying Training School RAF (Cambridge); thereafter, successful candidates were further trained at No. 43 Operational Training Unit, the AOP School based at RAF Andover dedicated to training British and Commonwealth AOP flight-crews.\n\nLieutenant-Colonel Terry Willett, Royal Artillery, commanded No. 43 OTU at RAF Andover as the first officer to command the AOP training organisation. Among the Canadian students trained by No. 43 Operational Training Unit at RAF Andover for No. 666 Squadron RCAF was Captain James Doonan, who later achieved fame as an actor playing Chief Engineer Lieutenant Commander Scott. While under training he flew an Auster Mark IV between two telegraph poles on Salisbury Plain, to prove it could be done.\n\nBritish Army AOP training at RAF Andover, with Auster Mark V aircraft, continued until at least 1949. One of the three squadrons was re-established after the war as 665 Squadron, Army Air Corps, based in Northern Ireland.\nRAF Andover has a unique place in British history, as the first British military unit to be equipped with helicopters, the Helicopter Training School, was formed in January 1945 as part of 43 OTU under the command of Squadron Leader B.H. Arkell. This was also the first European helicopter flying-training school, however the first European military unit formed solely with helicopters was the Luftwaffe's \"Transportstaffel 40\" in 1944. The Helicopter Training School was equipped with nine Sikorsky R-4B Hoverfly I helicopters, and trained 100 British Army pilots for Air Observation Post duties, as well as pilots for the first RAF squadron to be equipped with helicopters, 529 Squadron, which carried our radar calibration duties. Radar calibration duties were later carried out by the Hawker Siddeley Andover and Air Observation Post duties are today carried out by the Army Air Corps.\n\nPost-war, RAF Andover continued to be used for helicopter flying training and operational research, C Flight of 657 Squadron, Army Air Corps, being renamed 1901 Flight in February 1947. The Flight used six Sikorsky R-6A Hoverfly 2 (an improved version of the Hoverfly I) helicopters, and Auster AOP.6 aircraft to train British Army and Royal Air Force pilots and carry out operational trials. The Hoverfly 2s had little effective operational capability, but gave the Army valuable experience in the helicopter's potential use. In addition to artillery direction, the Flight's experimental activities included photography, radar trials, air/ground communications, and fighter evasion. In January 1948, the Flight moved to Middle Wallop. It still exists today as 1 Flight, Army Air Corps.\n\nOn 14 September 1955, RAF Andover was honoured with the freedom of the Borough of Andover. No. 12 Squadron RAF took part in the ceremony with a flypast of its English Electric Canberra B Mk. 6 bombers, to mark the Squadron's pre-war association with RAF Andover.\n\nAndover continued its association with pioneering the use of helicopters in Britain when the Joint Helicopter Unit, which was a joint Royal Navy, Army Air Corps and Royal Air Force unit exploring operational helicopter roles, was based at the station from 1958 to 1959. The unit used Westland Whirlwind helicopters and was disbanded at the end of 1959 to form No. 225 Squadron RAF.\nThe station's association with aviation research continued, as trials of the Hawker P.1127, the Hawker Siddeley Kestrel FGA 1 (both were experimental vertical take-off aircraft), and the Hawker Siddeley Harrier partially took place on the station. The Harrier was the developed form of the P.1127 and Kestrel and was the world's first operational vertical/short take-off and landing aircraft.\n\nTrials of the Hawker Siddeley Andover (the second RAF aircraft of that name) were also partially carried out at RAF Andover. In commemoration of this, Hawker Siddeley presented the Borough of Andover with a framed photo of the aircraft, and the type was also named after RAF Andover. The Andover's main role in RAF service was tactical transport, for which its unique ability to \"kneel\" – to allow vehicle entry at a shallow angle via a rear ramp – was an asset. Other roles included aero-medical evacuation, STOL, and parachute and 1 ton container drops. The Andover could also be fitted with long-range ferry tanks, which enabled the short-range Andover to fly surprisingly long distances, such as across the Atlantic Ocean. Andovers were still in RAF service for the photo reconnaissance role under the Open Skies Treaty and for use by the Empire Test Pilots' School until 2012.\n\nRAF Andover was throughout the post-1945 period the home of a number of communications squadrons, the last one of which was No. 21 Squadron RAF, which used de Havilland Devon and Percival Pembroke aircraft. This was formed on 3 February 1969, when the Western Communication Squadron RAF was re-designated at RAF Andover. It provided transport for senior officers in the western part of the United Kingdom and was disbanded following defence cuts on 31 March 1976.\n\nThe RAF station was closed on 10 June 1977 and the airfield was handed over to the British Army. It is in use by Army Air Corps units based at Middle Wallop, as well as Defence Equipment & Support (formerly the Defence Logistics Organisation (DLO)). The last RAF personnel working in these units left in November 2009. However, the airfield still retains an RAF link through the presence of 1213 (Andover) Squadron, Air Training Corps.\n\nThe RAF Museum preserves a number of individual aircraft which were based at RAF Andover during their service lives: a Sikorsky R-4B Hoverfly I; an Avro Anson C. 19; a De Havilland Dove C. 1; a Percival Pembroke C. 2; and, unusually, two Luftwaffe aircraft captured in 1944, a Junkers Ju 87 G-2 dive bomber and a Messerschmitt Bf 110 G-4 night fighter. The National Museum of Flight in Scotland preserves RAF Andover's former gate guardian, a Supermarine Spitfire LF Mk. XVIE.\n\nThe following units were here at some point:\nThe RAF Staff College was founded at RAF Andover on 1 April 1922, to provide staff training to selected officers, usually of Flight Lieutenant or Squadron Leader rank to enable them to undertake staff officer duties at the Air Ministry, and Command or Group HQs. It was closed on the day that Britain declared war, 3 September 1939. But in November 1939, shortened courses were restarted until the College was placed under Care and Maintenance on 28 May 1940. The Staff College re-opened at Bulstrode Park in December 1941, the College returning to Andover in 1948. It was raised to Group status within Training Command on 1 June 1968 and eventually moved to Bracknell in 1970.\n\nIn 2007, the site of Andover Airfield became the focus of local controversy when developers submitted a planning proposal to build a large distribution centre for the Tesco supermarket company. According to the proposal, the main building would have been more than 85,000 sq metres (21 acres), which would make it one of the biggest buildings in Europe. Approval was granted in 2008 but the developer failed to reach agreement with Tesco; a regional distribution centre for the Co-op Group was built instead, and the rest of the site became a business park.\n\nFrom November 2009, a site on the former airfield was named Marlborough Lines and subsequently became home to the Army Headquarters.\n\n\n\n"}

Earlier attempts at a unifying definition of quantum groups using, for example, multiplicative unitaries have enjoyed some success but have also encountered several technical problems.\n\nOne of the main features distinguishing this new approach from its predecessors is the axiomatic existence of left and right invariant weights. This gives a noncommutative analogue of left and right Haar measures on a locally compact Hausdorff group.\n\nBefore we can even begin to properly define a locally compact quantum group, we first need to define a number of preliminary concepts and also state a few theorems.\n\nDefinition (weight).

If formula_96 is a state (i.e., a positive linear functional of norm formula_97) on formula_1, then we can uniquely extend formula_99 to a state formula_100 on formula_101.\n\nDefinition (Locally compact quantum group). A (C*-algebraic) locally compact quantum group is an ordered pair formula_102, where formula_1 is a C*-algebra and formula_104 is a \"non-degenerate\" *-homomorphism called the co-multiplication, that satisfies the following four conditions:\n\nFrom the definition of a locally compact quantum group, it can be shown that the right-invariant K.M.S. weight formula_114 is automatically faithful. Therefore, the faithfulness of formula_114 is a redundant condition and does not need to be postulated.\n\nThe category of locally compact quantum groups allows for a dual construction with which one can prove that the bi-dual of a locally compact quantum group is isomorphic to the original one. This result gives a far-reaching generalization of Pontryagin duality for locally compact Hausdorff abelian groups.\n\nThe theory has an equivalent formulation in terms of von Neumann algebras.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1845123", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1845123", "title": "Chain drive", "text": "Chain drive\n\nChain drive is a way of transmitting mechanical power from one place to another. It is often used to convey power to the wheels of a vehicle, particularly bicycles and motorcycles. It is also used in a wide variety of machines besides vehicles.\n\nMost often, the power is conveyed by a roller chain, known as the drive chain or transmission chain, passing over a sprocket gear, with the teeth of the gear meshing with the holes in the links of the chain. The gear is turned, and this pulls the chain putting mechanical force into the system. Another type of drive chain is the Morse chain, invented by the Morse Chain Company of Ithaca, New York, United States. This has inverted teeth.\n\nSometimes the power is output by simply rotating the chain, which can be used to lift or drag objects. In other situations, a second gear is placed and the power is recovered by attaching shafts or hubs to this gear. Though drive chains are often simple oval loops, they can also go around corners by placing more than two gears along the chain; gears that do not put power into the system or transmit it out are generally known as idler-wheels. By varying the diameter of the input and output gears with respect to each other, the gear ratio can be altered. For example, when the bicycle pedals' gear rotate once, it causes the gear that drives the wheels to rotate more than one revolution.\n\nThe oldest known application of a chain drive appears in the Polybolos, described by the Greek engineer Philon of Byzantium (3rd century BC). Two flat-linked chains were connected to a windlass, which by winding back and forth would automatically fire the machine's arrows until its magazine was empty. Although the device did not transmit power continuously since the chains \"did not transmit power from shaft to shaft, and hence they were not in the direct line of ancestry of the chain-drive proper\", the Greek design marks the beginning of the history of the chain drive since \"no earlier instance of such a cam is known, and none as complex is known until the 16th century.\" It is here that the flat-link chain, often attributed to Leonardo da Vinci, actually made its first appearance.\"\n\nThe first continuous and endless power-transmitting chain drive was depicted in the written horological treatise of the Song Dynasty by the medieval Chinese polymath mathematician and astronomer Su Song (1020-1101 AD), who used it to operate the armillary sphere of his astronomical clock tower as well as the clock jack figurines presenting the time of day by mechanically banging gongs and drums. The chain drive itself converted rotary to reclinear motion and was given power via the hydraulic works of Su's water clock tank and waterwheel, the latter which acted as a large gear.\n\nRoller chain and sprockets is a very efficient method of power transmission compared to (friction-drive) belts, with far less frictional loss.\n\nAlthough chains can be made stronger than belts, their greater mass increases drive train inertia.\n\nDrive chains are most often made of metal, while belts are often rubber, plastic, urethane, or other substances.\n\nDrive belts can slip unless they have teeth, which means that the output side may not rotate at a precise speed, and some work gets lost to the friction of the belt as it bends around the pulleys. Wear on rubber or plastic belts and their teeth is often easier to observe, and chains wear out faster than belts if not properly lubricated.\n\nOne problem with roller chains is the variation in speed, or surging, caused by the acceleration and deceleration of the chain as it goes around the sprocket link by link. It starts as soon as the pitch line of the chain contacts the first tooth of the sprocket. This contact occurs at a point below the pitch circle of the sprocket. As the sprocket rotates, the chain is raised up to the pitch circle and is then dropped down again as sprocket rotation continues. Because of the fixed pitch length, the pitch line of the link cuts across the chord between two pitch points on the sprocket, remaining in this position relative to the sprocket until the link exits the sprocket. This rising and falling of the pitch line is what causes chordal effect or speed variation.\n\nIn other words, conventional roller chain drives suffer the potential for vibration, as the effective radius of action in a chain and sprocket combination constantly changes during revolution (\"Chordal action\"). If the chain moves at constant speed, then the shafts must accelerate and decelerate constantly. If one sprocket rotates at a constant speed, then the chain (and probably all other sprockets that it drives) must accelerate and decelerate constantly. This is usually not an issue with many drive systems; however, most motorcycles are fitted with a rubber bushed rear wheel hub to virtually eliminate this vibration issue. Toothed belt drives are designed to limit this issue by operating at a constant pitch radius).\n\nChains are often narrower than belts, and this can make it easier to shift them to larger or smaller gears in order to vary the gear ratio. Multi-speed bicycles with derailleurs make use of this. Also, the more positive meshing of a chain can make it easier to build gears that can increase or shrink in diameter, again altering the gear ratio. However, some newer synchronous belts claim to have \"equivalent capacity to roller chain drives in the same width\". \n\nBoth can be used to move objects by attaching pockets, buckets, or frames to them; chains are often used to move things vertically by holding them in frames, as in industrial toasters, while belts are good at moving things horizontally in the form of conveyor belts. It is not unusual for the systems to be used in combination; for example the rollers that drive conveyor belts are themselves often driven by drive chains.\n\nDrive shafts are another common method used to move mechanical power around that is sometimes evaluated in comparison to chain drive; in particular belt drive vs chain drive vs shaft drive is a key design decision for most motorcycles. Drive shafts tend to be tougher and more reliable than chain drive, but the bevel gears have far more friction than a chain.\nFor this reason virtually all high-performance motorcycles use chain drive, with shaft-driven arrangements generally used for non-sporting machines. Toothed-belt drives are used for some (non-sporting) models.\n\nChain drive was the main feature which differentiated the safety bicycle introduced in 1885, with its two equal-sized wheels, from the direct-drive penny-farthing or \"high wheeler\" type of bicycle. The popularity of the chain-driven safety bicycle brought about the demise of the penny-farthing, and is still a basic feature of bicycle design today.\n\nChain drive was a popular power transmission system from the earliest days of the automobile. It gained prominence as an alternative to the \"Système Panhard\" with its rigid \"Hotchkiss\" driveshaft and universal joints.\n\nA chain-drive system uses one or more roller chains to transmit power from a differential to the rear axle. This system allowed for a great deal of vertical axle movement (for example, over bumps), and was simpler to design and build than a rigid driveshaft in a workable suspension. Also, it had less unsprung weight at the rear wheels than the Hotchkiss drive, which would have had half the weight of the driveshaft, and differential to carry as well. This meant that the vehicle would have a smoother ride. The lighter unsprung mass would allow the suspension to react to bumps more effectively.\n\nFrazer Nash were strong proponents of this system using one chain per gear selected by dog clutches. The Frazer Nash chain drive system, (designed for the GN Cyclecar Company by Archibald Frazer-Nash and Henry Ronald Godfrey) was very effective, allowing extremely fast gear selections. The Frazer Nash (or GN) transmission system provided the basis for many \"special\" racing cars of the 1920s and 1930s, the most famous being Basil Davenport's Spider which held the outright record at the Shelsley Walsh Speed Hill Climb in the 1920s.\n\nThe last popular chain drive automobile was the Honda S600 of the 1960s.\n\nInternal combustion engines often use a timing chain to drive the camshaft(s). This is an area in which chain drives frequently compete directly with timing belt drive systems, particularly when the engine has one or more overhead camshafts, and provides an excellent example of some of the differences and similarities between the two approaches. For this application, chains last longer, but are often harder to replace, as they must be enclosed in a space into which lubricating oil can be introduced. Being heavier, the chain robs more power, but is also less likely to fail. The camshaft of a four stroke engine rotates at half crankshaft speed, so the camshaft sprocket has twice as many teeth as the crankshaft sprocket. Less common alternatives to timing chain drives include spur gears or bevel gears combined with a shaft.\n\nToday, inverted tooth drive chains are commonly used in passenger car and light truck transfer cases.\n\nChain drive versus belt drive or use of a driveshaft is a fundamental design decision in motorcycle design; nearly all motorcycles use one of these three designs. See for more details.\n\n\n\n\n \n"}

It was used by the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) during the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Soviet–Japanese border conflicts and the Pacific War. Ever-greater thicknesses of armour on tanks rendered the Type 97 obsolete by about 1942.\n\nConcerned by reports of Chinese purchases of Vickers 6-Ton tanks and rising tensions with the Soviet Red Army along the Manchurian border, the IJA issued a requirement for an anti-tank rifle in 1935. The Nagoya Arsenal submitted a weapon derived from their copy of the Hotchkiss M1929 machine gun while the Kokura Arsenal submitted a new design using a 20×125mm cartridge. The first round of testing in March 1936 was not satisfactory and both guns were returned to their designers to rectify problems encountered during the trials. The Kokura Arsenal built eight prototypes for the second round of trials held at the Army Infantry School in 1937, after which the IJA rejected the Nagoya weapon. It identified several problems that needed to fixed and a batch of fifty guns was built for operational trials in 1938. After another round of trials in December at the infantry and cavalry schools, the weapon was accepted as the Type 97 Automatic Cannon. \n\nThe gun has a gas-operated delayed-blowback mechanism in which the barrel and receiver also recoiled to help steady the weapon. Despite reports that it can fire in full-automatic mode, the weapon lacks a selector switch to distinguish between single-shot and fully automatic modes. The Type 97 was the heaviest anti-tank rifle of World War II and weighs ready to fire, minus the gun shield, and including the shield and four carrying handles, handily exceeding its design weight of . It uses a seven-round removable box magazine mounted above the receiver. The gun can fire a dozen rounds per minute. It has an overall length of and the removable barrel, including the muzzle brake, was (53-calibers) long.\n\nThe Type 97 fired solid-steel armour-piercing-tracer (AP-T), high-explosive-tracer and high-explosive incendiary-tracer shells. The initial AP-T round was the Type 97 and it had a softer grade of steel than the later Type 100. The AP-T projectiles had a muzzle velocity of . Based on a captured Japanese ammunition table, the Type 97 round was credited with the ability to penetrate of armour at 90° at a range of . The same table credited it with the ability to penetrate of armour at .\n\nProduction of the Type 97 began in 1939 at the Kokura Arsenal with the first of 950 that were made through 1941. Production ceased that year, although a further 100 rifles were built by the \"Nihon Seikosho Company\" in the first half of 1943. Including prototypes, a total of 1,108 rifles were manufactured. The anti-tank rifle cost ¥6,400 at a time when a normal rifle cost ¥77. Beginning in 1940, the barrels were chrome-plated to extend their lives.\n\nThe Type 97 was assigned to IJA infantry battalions, normally on the basis of a single anti-tank platoon allocated to each infantry company. Each platoon had two 11-man sections each with a single Type 97. In addition to the section leader, there were four men assigned to carry the gun, four ammunition bearers and two horse-holders for the nine horses nominally assigned to the section. Over long distances, the Type 97 was broken down into three parts to be carried by the horses.\n\nThe weapon first saw combat during the Battles of Khalkhin Gol in 1939, where it reportedly disabled a number of the lightly-armoured vehicles used by the Soviets at that time. The Type 97 was not extensively deployed in China until the following year, by which time they were mostly used as infantry support weapons. Reflecting this change, most of the ammunition produced in 1941–1942 was high-explosive, not armour-piercing. The rifle was not widely deployed in the Southwest Pacific during World War II, although it was used by the Teishin Shudan paratroopers of the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force. The Type 97's 20 mm round was no longer effective against modern tanks after 1942. The Ho-1 and Ho-3 autocannon were developed from the Type 97 for use on aircraft.\n\n\n"}

The park is divided into two sections. One section of the park, the \"lower park,\" is headquartered in the village of Washington Crossing located in Upper Makefield Township in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. It marks the location of George Washington's crossing of the Delaware River during the American Revolutionary War.\n\nThe lower park includes 13 historic buildings including McConkey's Ferry Inn, where General George Washington and his aides ate dinner and made plans prior to the crossing. Among the historic buildings is a 20th-century barn that houses 5 replica Durham Boats. Durham boats were large, open boats that were used to transport pig iron along the Delaware River at the time of the Revolution and these boats, along with the ferries and others, were used to transport soldiers, horses, and equipment across the river on the night of December 25–26, 1776. The replica boats are used each year when the nighttime crossing is reenacted in the park.\n\nLocated 4.5 miles away in Solebury Township, Bucks County, Pennsylvania, is the park's northern section, the \"upper park.\" In its 100-acre area it contains (0.4 km²) Bowman's Hill Tower and the Thompson-Neely House, which was used as a military hospital during Washington's encampment in the area, and the graves of an estimated 40 to 60 soldiers who died there. The exact location of the graves is unknown, though they were partially unearthed during the construction of the nearby Delaware Canal in the early 19th century and during other nearby construction projects. Presently there are 23 memorial headstones as a reminder that the area is a gravesite.\n\nThe lower park contains a visitor's center, which was renovated from July 2011 to March 2013. The newly renovated visitor's center was opened March 10, 2013. It features a small exhibition with some Revolutionary war artifacts, and an original letter written by George Washington while in the McConkey's Ferry Inn. The park also has obtained a full size digital copy of Emanuel Leutze's 1851 painting, \"Washington Crossing the Delaware\", from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, that is hanging in the auditorium.\n\nThe park was created in 1917 and the Washington Crossing Park Commission was established in 1919 to administer and develop the park.\nThe park was formed to commemorate the famous \"Crossing\" as the \"Turning point of the American Revolution.\" The Commission's first objective was to develop the site as a historical shrine and its second objective was to preserve its natural beauty and develop its areas for recreational use. Bowman's Hill Tower was built to commemorate what may have been a lookout point for General George Washington's troops to watch the banks of the Delaware River for enemy activity. The park also contains the Bowman's Hill Wildflower Preserve and the surrounding area is the natural habitat for many native plants, trees, animals and birds. Today the park serves to preserve and interpret the site of the Washington's Crossing of the Delaware.\n\nThe park is administered by the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources(DCNR). Cuts in funding from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania forced the PHMC to reduce park staffing, which resulted in closing the park to the public in late November, 2009. In 2013, the Pennsylvania state budget and fiscal code mandated that the park transfer from PHMC to DCNR. The switch was finalized in early 2016. The Friends of Washington Crossing Park, a 501(c)(3) private, non-profit corporation, was incorporated in January 2010 to support the PHMC in operating Washington Crossing Historic Park, and the park re-opened to the public in the spring of that same year. The Friends of Washington Crossing Park re-opened the park's gift shop in December 2010. Current full-time, on-site staffing consists of 2 museum professionals and 2 maintenance personnel provided by the PHMC, who work in conjunction with the part-time staff of historical interpreters provided by the Friends of Washington Crossing Park. Washington Crossing Historic Park is open for guided tours Monday through Sundays from 10am – 4pm, April 1 – December 31. The recreational areas of the park, including the picnic pavilions, are open to the public from dawn to dusk all year. The park holds a reenactment of General Washington's nighttime crossing every year, plus other public programs on related themes throughout the year.\n\nThe park was included in the Washington's Crossing National Historic Landmark designation in 1961, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1966.\n\nOn the night of December 25–26, 1776, General George Washington and a small army of 2,400 men crossed the Delaware River at McConkey's Ferry, on their way to attack a Hessian garrison of 1,500 in Trenton, New Jersey. The crossing, made during a time when morale was at its lowest point during the American Revolution, renewed hope among the Continental Army, Congress and the general population. On the morning of December 26, at the Battle of Trenton, they were able to force the Hessian soldiers to surrender, without any American casualties.\n\nThe ferry was first established by Henry Baker in 1684. His grandson, Samuel Baker Jr., sold it to Samuel McConkey (also spelled McKonkey) on December 5, 1774. McConkey sold it to Benjamin Taylor on March 21, 1777. The corresponding ferry on the New Jersey side of the Delaware River was known as Johnson's Ferry.\n\n\n\n"}

Dick wrote in a letter: \"One day I saw a newspaper headline reporting that the President suggested that if Americans had to buy their bomb shelters, rather than being provided with them by the government, they'd take better care of them, an idea which made me furious.

Dick's Electric Dreams\".\n\nThe story takes place in 1971 where the vast majority of citizens own private bomb shelters and financially support nuclear war preparations for their town. New models of \"improved\" shelters are released and bought every year (much like vacuum cleaners or automobiles) because the Soviets supposedly develop new methods of attack on previously-developed shelters.\n\nThe story revolves around Mike Foster, the adolescent son of an \"anti-P,\" a movement of outsiders refusing to take part in these preparations because they argue the military industrial complex is only creating fear to sell more bomb shelters. Mike, however, lives in fear that he will not have access to a shelter when the war begins and is a social outcast because of his father's political positions.\n\nFinally, Foster's father gives up his resistance and buys a brand-new costly bomb shelter model. Foster luckily boards the new shelter. Soon afterward, news reports the Soviets developed a new anti-shelter technique leaving all recent models totally vulnerable, requiring a new \"adapter\" to make current models safe again.\n\nThen, Mike's Father is forced to sell the shelter back due to economic issues. Foster then runs and hides in the shelter, where he is pulled out by the marketers, and the story ends with a satirical note, a sign saying \"PEACE ON EARTH, GOOD WILL TO MEN, PUBLIC SHELTER, ADMISSION 50¢\n"}

In addition crypto-shredding suppresses the need to erase the data at the end of the disk's lifecycle.\n\nDisk encryption generally refers to wholesale encryption that operates on an entire volume mostly transparently to the user, the system, and applications. This is generally distinguished from file-level encryption that operates by user invocation on a single file or group of files, and which requires the user to decide which specific files should be encrypted. Disk encryption usually includes all aspects of the disk, including directories, so that an adversary cannot determine content, name or size of any file. It is well suited to portable devices such as laptop computers and thumb drives which are particularly susceptible to being lost or stolen. If used properly, someone finding a lost device cannot penetrate actual data, or even know what files might be present.\n\nThe disk's data is protected using symmetric cryptography with the key randomly generated when a disk's encryption is first established. This key is itself encrypted in some way using a password or pass-phrase known (ideally) only to the user. Thereafter, in order to access the disk's data, the user must supply the password to make the key available to the software. This must be done sometime after each operating system start-up before the encrypted data can be used.\n\nDone in software, disk encryption typically operates at a level between all applications and most system programs and the low-level device drivers by \"transparently\" (from a user's point of view) encrypting data after it is produced by a program but before it is physically written to the disk. Conversely, it decrypts data immediately after being read but before it is presented to a program. Properly done, programs are unaware of these cryptographic operations.\n\nSome disk encryption software (e.g., TrueCrypt or BestCrypt) provide features that generally cannot be accomplished with disk hardware encryption: the ability to mount \"container\" files as encrypted logical disks with their own file system; and encrypted logical \"inner\" volumes which are secretly hidden within the free space of the more obvious \"outer\" volumes. Such strategies provide plausible deniability.\n\nWell-known examples of disk encryption software include: BitLocker for Windows; FileVault for Apple OS/X; LUKS a standard free software mainly for Linux and TrueCrypt, a non-commercial freeware application, for Windows, OS/X and Linux.\n\n\nSome disk encryption systems, such as VeraCrypt, CipherShed (active open source forks of the discontinued TrueCrypt project), BestCrypt (proprietary trialware), offers levels of plausible deniability, which might be useful if a user is compelled to reveal the password of an encrypted volume.\n\nHidden volumes are a steganographic feature that allows a second, \"hidden\", volume to reside within the apparent free space of a visible \"container\" volume (sometimes known as \"outer\" volume). The hidden volume has its own separate file system, password, and encryption key distinct from the container volume.\n\nThe content of the hidden volume is encrypted and resides in the free space of the file system of the outer volume—space which would otherwise be filled with random values if the hidden volume did not exist. When the outer container is brought online thorough the disk encryption software, whether the inner or outer volume is mounted depends on the password provided. If the \"normal\" password/key of the outer volume proves valid, the outer volume is mounted; if the password/key of the hidden volume proves valid, then (and only then) can the existence of hidden volume even be detected, and it is mounted; otherwise if the password/key does not successfully decrypt either the inner or outer volume descriptors, then neither is mounted.\n\nOnce a hidden volume has been created inside the visible container volume, the user will store important-looking information (but which the user does not actually mind revealing) on the outer volume, whereas more sensitive information is stored within the hidden volume.\n\nIf the user is forced to reveal a password, the user can reveal the password to the outer volume, without disclosing the existence of the hidden volume. The hidden volume will not be compromised, if the user takes certain precautions in overwriting the free areas of the \"host\" disk.\n\nVolumes, be they stored in a file or a device/partition, may intentionally not contain any discernible \"signatures\" or unencrypted headers. As cipher algorithms are designed to be indistinguishable from a pseudorandom permutation without knowing the key, the presence of data on the encrypted volume is also undetectable unless there are known weaknesses in the cipher. This means that it is impossible to prove that any file or partition is an encrypted volume (rather than random data) without having the password to mount it. This characteristic also makes it impossible to determine if a volume contains another hidden volume.\n\nA file hosted volume (as opposed to partitions) may look out of place in some cases since it will be entirely random data placed in a file intentionally. However, a partition or device hosted volume will look no different from a partition or device that has been wiped with a common disk wiping tool such as Darik's Boot and Nuke. One can plausibly claim that such a device or partition has been wiped to clear personal data.\n\nPortable or \"traveller mode\" means the encryption software can be run without installation to the system hard drive. In this mode, the software typically installs a temporary driver from the portable media. Since it is installing a driver (albeit temporarily), administrative privileges are still required.\n\nSome disk encryption software allows encrypted volumes to be resized. Not many systems implement this fully, and resort to using \"sparse files\" to achieve this.\n\nEncrypted volumes contain \"header\" (or \"CDB\") data, which may be backed up. Overwriting these data will destroy the volume, so the ability to back them up is useful.\n\nRestoring the backup copy of these data may reset the volume's password to what it was when the backup was taken.\n\n\n"}

She was the last representative of the line of Masovian-Piast.\n\nShe was the second daughter of Konrad III of Masovia and Anna Radziwiłł. She was a sister of Dukes Janusz III of Masovia and Stanislaus of Masovia, and Sophia, who married Stephen VII Báthory.\n\nAfter the death of her brother Janusz III, a group of powerful nobles at the Masovian court attempted to maintain the separate legal status of Masovia and prevent its incorporation into the surrounding Kingdom of Poland. In 1526 this group proclaimed Anna as Duchess, the last representative of the family (however, her elder sister Sophia was still alive at the time). This resistance to the duchy's incorporation, which was largely caused by their fear of losing their significance, was also fuelled by political forces interested in maintaining the status of fiefdoms. In this state Masovia would be united in resistance against the Crown and would also have encouraged the House of Habsburg (in comparison with the Polish rivalry for influence in Moldova).\n\nIn 1536 Anna concluded a marriage with Stanisław Odrowąż. But the king refused to return their goods in return for 10 000 ducats. This caused conflict between the couple and Sigismund I the Old, who deprived the groom of his offices in Odrowaza. The dispute ended with the parliament in 1537, which forced Anna and her husband to take an oath before the king, and renounce the hereditary rights of Masovia and the estate for the benefit of the Crown.\n\nAfter leaving Masovia, Anna settled in Odrowąż. The rest of her life was spent mostly at the castle in Jarosław, where in approximately 1540 she had her only child, Sophia.\n\nAnna died and was buried in Jarosław.\n\nShe was the ancestor of Marie Leszczyńska who became Queen consort of France by her marriage to Louis XV of France.\n"}

Afghan Jewish communities now exist mostly in Israel, and the United States.\n\nThe Jews had formed a community of leather and karakul merchants, landowners and money lenders alike. The large Jewish families mostly lived in the border city of Herat, while the families' patriarchs traveled back and forth on trading trips across the mountains of Afghanistan on whose rocks their prayers were carved in Hebrew and sometimes even Aramaic, moving between the routes on the ancient silk road. Jews also settled in the capital city of Kabul.\n\nAs of 2019, only one known Jew, Zablon Simintov, remains residing in Afghanistan; he cares for a synagogue in Afghanistan's capital, Kabul.\n\nRecords of a Jewish population in Afghanistan go back to the 7th century. Afghan Jews claim ancestry to the Lost Israelite Tribes. Balkh was a main center for Jewish life in ancient Afghanistan. The city was said to have been the burial place of the Hebrew prophet Ezekiel, and the home of the prophet Jeremiah. The city of Herat was important in the silk route, and other trading routes. In modern times, ruins still exist, and harbor a Jewish cemetery. Muhammad al-Idrisi (died 1166) wrote that Kabul had a Jewish quarter. In the 18th century, Jews serving in the army of Nadir Shah settled in Kabul as his treasury guards. In 2011, so-called Afghan Geniza, an 11th-century collection of manuscript fragments in Hebrew, Aramaic, Judeo-Arabic and Judeo-Persian was found in Taliban caves in Afghanistan. Some 29 pages from the collection were bought by the National Library of Israel in 2013.\n\nBy the early 1930s, some 60,000 refugees had fled from Soviet territory to Afghanistan. In 1932, Muhammed Nadir Shah created a border treaty with the Soviet Union preventing asylum seekers from fleeing the border and into Afghanistan. Later that same year, Afghanistan began deporting refugees back to Soviet Union or specified Chinese territories. Soviet Jews already in Afghanistan, who were attempting to flee further south, were detained in the capital city of Kabul, while any Soviet Jews apprehend at the border were immediately deported. Soviet Jews were accused of espionage and the intent to disseminate radical Bolshevist propaganda.\n\nHowever, by 1933, non-refugee Afghani Jews, those who had lived there for decades if not centuries, were also targeted.  All Jews who were citizens of Afghanistan were ordered to relocate to their birthplace, which was most often Herat or Kabul. This was an attempt by the government to further enforce the policy that Jews were not natives of the Northern provinces of Afghanistan. After Muhammad Nadir Shah was assassinated in 1933, his son continued the harsh fate for the Jews. By the end of 1933, nearly all of the Jews in northern cities had been expelled, and returned to Central Afghanistan.\n\nIn 1935, a delegate to the Zionist Congress declared that an estimated 40,000 Bukharan Jews had been killed or starved.\n\nIn the summer of 1935, riots erupted in Herat, the Afghan city with the largest Jewish population, due to a dispute between two boys, one Jewish and one Muslim. The two boys got into a fight over unknown reasons, causing the Muslim boy to fall down the stairs. The Jewish boy, Aba Ben Simon, was blamed, and others began spreading rumors that he was trying to forcibly convert the other to Judaism. This incident caused Herat's Shiite Muslims to take up arms against the Jews and pillage their shops, homes and beatings at the hands of the mobs. Jewish women, regardless of their marital status, were subjected to being kidnapped and raped, and sometimes were forcibly converted and married off to their attackers. Some Jews fled Herat, and were never allowed to return.\n\nSome Jews tried to flee to British-controlled India. The British colonial government categorized them by passports: Iranian, Russian and Afghani. Those with Russian passports were once again accused of “Bolshevist ties” and denied entry. The British Raj tried to deport many Afghani and Russian Jews back to the Soviet Union under the guise of allegedly violating the “behavioral conduct” codes of British India (i.e., Peshawar Conspiracy Cases), when in fact the colonial government feared they would disseminate socialism among the populace of native Indian colonial subjects and lead them to revolt against oppressive colonial rule, adding to the then-growing Indian independence movement.\n\nThe Jewish Life in Kabul and Herat continued to worsen. Many Jews fled illegally into India during the 1940s. Thousands of Jews fled to Palestine, (and eventually Israel after it was established in 1948). Some Jews also made it all the way to the United States, settling mainly in New York City's borough of Queens.\n\nBy 1948, over 5,000 Jews existed in Afghanistan, and after they were allowed to emigrate in 1951, most of them moved to Israel and the United States. Afghanistan was the only Muslim country that allowed Jewish families to emigrate without revoking their citizenship first. Afghan Jews left the country en masse in the 1960s. Their resettlement in New York and Tel Aviv was motivated by a search for a better life, but not because of religious persecution. By 1969, some 300 remained, and most of these left after the Soviet invasion of 1979, leaving 10 Afghan Jews in 1996, most of them in Kabul. More than 10,000 Jews of Afghan descent presently live in Israel. Over 200 families of Afghan Jews live in New York City in the USA.\nOver 100 Jews of Afghan descent live in London.\n\nBy the end of 2004, only two Jews were left in Afghanistan, Zablon Simintov and Isaac Levy. Simintov ran a store selling carpets and jewelry until 2001. They lived at separate ends of the dilapidated Kabul synagogue. They kept denouncing each other to the authorities, and both spent time in Taliban jails. The Taliban also confiscated the Torah. \nThe contentious relationship between Simentov and Levy was dramatized in a play inspired by news reports of the two which appeared in international news media following the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan and the overthrow of the Taliban regime. The play, entitled \"The Last Two Jews of Kabul,\" was written by playwright Josh Greenfeld and was staged in New York City in 2002.\n\nIn January 2005, Levy died of natural causes. Simentov is now the last remaining Jew in Afghanistan. Simentov is trying to recover the confiscated Torah. Simentov, who does not speak Hebrew, claims that the man who stole his Torah is now in U.S. custody in Guantanamo Bay. Simentov has a wife and two daughters who live in Israel, and he said he was considering joining them. However, when asked during a recent interview whether he would go to Israel, Simentov retorted, \"Go to Israel? What business do I have there? Why should I leave?\"\n\nThere is also a disused Synagogue in Herat, in western Afghanistan, which contains most of its original characteristics although in a state of disrepair.\n\n\n"}

The Type 88 number was designated for the year the gun was accepted, 2588 in the Japanese imperial year calendar, or 1928 in the Gregorian calendar. It replaced the earlier Type 11 75 mm AA gun in front line combat service, and at the time was equal in performances to any of its contemporaries in western armies and was considered capable of handling any targets the Japanese army was likely to encounter on the Asian mainland. Although it was soon overtaken by improvements in aircraft technology and was largely obsolete by 1941, it continued to be used on many fronts until the end of the war.\n\nThe Type 88 75 mm AA gun was based on an exhaustive evaluation by the Army Technical Bureau of several existing overseas designs, amalgamating some of the best features from each design (especially from the World War I-vintage British Vickers QF 3 inch 20 cwt AA gun) into a new, Japanese design. The Type 88's number was designated for the year the gun was accepted, 2588 in the Japanese imperial year calendar, or 1928 in the Gregorian calendar. The Type 88 was superior to Type 11 in accuracy and range of fire.\n\nThe Type 88 75 mm AA gun entered service between 1927 and 1928, and was deployed to virtually every anti-aircraft field artillery unit as protection against medium level aircraft attacks. Although it was difficult and expensive weapon for Japan to produce with its limited industrial infrastructure and production technology, it was produced in larger numbers than any other medium anti-aircraft weapon in the Japanese inventory. Over 2000 units completed by the time of the surrender of Japan.\n\nIn the early phases of World War II, Allied military intelligence initially assumed that the Japanese Type 88 was a copy of the formidable German Flak 36/37 88 mm gun due to its name. However, there is no connection between the two weapons. The confusion arose from the Japanese Army's nomenclature system. “Type 88” corresponds to the year 2588 in the Japanese imperial year, and not to the caliber of the weapon.\n\nThe Type 88 75 mm AA gun had a single piece gun barrel with sliding breech, mounted on a central pedestal. The firing platform was supported by five legs, each of which (along with the central pedestal) had adjustable screwed foot for leveling. For transport each of the legs could be folded, and the barrel was also partially retractable.\n\nTactically employed in battle as a four-gun field battery, Japanese combat forces used the weapon during the invasion of Manchuria, Soviet-Japanese Border Wars and the Second Sino-Japanese War. They found the Type 88 gun's high velocity rounds were extremely effective anti-tank weapon when fired horizontally. The weapon was the standard Japanese mobile antiaircraft artillery weapon and used against Allied forces more than any other artillery weapon.\n\nDuring both the Battle of Iwo Jima and the Battle of Okinawa it was used effectively with armor-piercing rounds against American M4 Sherman tanks and as a coastal-defense gun. Against armor, it had the advantage of a 360 degree traverse, but it was not easily moved and so it was less effective when fired from ambush against tanks.\n\nTowards the end of the war many of the Type 88s were withdrawn from front line combat service and sent back to the home islands, to help reinforce Japan's homeland defenses against Allied air raids and to prepare for the threat of Allied invasion. It was assigned to civil defense units in major Japanese cities, but its maximum effective vertical range of meant it was ineffective against the USAAF B-29 Superfortress bombers, which could fly as high as .

His research interests were in quantum field theory, especially the interface between high-energy particle physics and cosmology. He is best known as one of the first to describe the Higgs mechanism, and for his research on topological defects. From the 1950s he was concerned about the nuclear arms race and from 1970 took leading roles in promoting the social responsibility of the scientist.\n\nKibble was born in Madras, in the Madras Presidency of British India, on 23 December 1932. He was the son of the statistician Walter F. Kibble, and the grandson of William Bannerman, an officer in the Indian Medical Service, and the author Helen Bannerman. He was educated at Doveton Corrie School in Madras and then in Edinburgh, Scotland, at Melville College and at the University of Edinburgh. He graduated from the University of Edinburgh with a BSc in 1955, MA in 1956 and a PhD in 1958.\n\nKibble worked on mechanisms of symmetry breaking, phase transitions and the topological defects (monopoles, cosmic strings or domain walls) that can be formed.\n\nHe is most noted for his co-discovery of the Higgs mechanism and Higgs boson with Gerald Guralnik and C. R. Hagen. As part of Physical Review Letters 50th anniversary celebration, the journal recognised this discovery as one of the milestone papers in PRL history. For this discovery Kibble was awarded the American Physical Society's 2010 J. J. Sakurai Prize for Theoretical Particle Physics. While Guralnik, Hagen, and Kibble are widely considered to have authored the most complete of the early papers on the Higgs theory, they were controversially not included in the 2013 Nobel Prize in Physics. In 2014, Nobel Laureate Peter Higgs expressed disappointment that Kibble had not been chosen to share the Nobel Prize with François Englert and himself.\n\nKibble pioneered the study of topological defect generation in the early universe. The paradigmatic mechanism of defect formation across a second-order phase transition is known as the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. His paper on cosmic strings introduced the phenomenon into modern cosmology.\n\nHe was one of the two co-chairs of an interdisciplinary research programme funded by the European Science Foundation (ESF) on Cosmology in the Laboratory (COSLAB) which ran from 2001 to 2005. He was previously the coordinator of an ESF Network on Topological Defects in Particle Physics, Condensed Matter & Cosmology (TOPDEF).\n\nKibble was an elected Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1980, of the Institute of Physics (1991), and of Imperial College London (2009). He was also a member of the American Physical Society (1958), the European Physical Society (1975) and the Academia Europaea (2000). In 2008, Kibble was named an Outstanding Referee by the American Physical Society.\n\nIn addition to the Sakurai Prize, Kibble has been awarded the Hughes Medal (1981) of the Royal Society, the Rutherford (1984) and Guthrie Medals (1993) of the Institute of Physics, the Dirac Medal (2013), the Albert Einstein Medal (2014) and the Royal Medal of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (2014). He was appointed a CBE in the 1998 Birthday Honours and was knighted in the 2014 Birthday Honours for services to physics.\n\nKibble was posthumously awarded the Isaac Newton Medal by the Institute of Physics for his outstanding lifelong commitment to the field.\n\nIn 1966 Kibble co-authored, with Frank H. Berkshire, a textbook, \"Classical Mechanics\", which as of 2016 is still in print and is now in its 5th edition.\n\nKibble was married to Anne Allan from 1957 until her death in 2005. Kibble had three children. \n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, Kibble became concerned about the nuclear arms race and from 1970 he took leading roles in several organisations promoting scientists' social responsibility. In the period 1970–1977, he was a national committee member, then treasurer, then chair of the British Society for Social Responsibility in Science; from 1976 he was a trustee of the Science and Society Trust; from 1981 to 1991 he was a national coordinating committee member, then vice-chair, then chair of Scientists against Nuclear Arms; he was a sponsor of Scientists for Global Responsibility; and from 1988 he was chair, and later a trustee, of the Martin Ryle Trust. He was chair of the organising committee of the Second International Scientists' Congress, held at Imperial College in 1988, and was a co-editor of the proceedings.\n\nIn retirement, Kibble chaired the Richmond branch of the Ramblers Association.\n\nHe died in London on 2 June 2016 at the age of 83.\n\n"}

He succeeded Augusto B. Leguía, from 1912 to 1914. Billinghurst was of part English descent. The surname Billinghurst is a locational name 'of Billinghurst' a parish in Sussex, England.\n\nDuring his presidency, Billinghurst became embroiled in an increasingly bitter series of conflicts with Congress, ranging from proposed advanced social legislation to settlement of the Tacna-Arica dispute.\n\nThis provoked a military uprising organized by civilian opponents to his regime who used the military to carry out a coup. As a result of the uprising, Billinghurst was sent into exile in Chile where he died shortly thereafter.\n\nBillinghurst belonged to the Civilistas group, which were then considered the architects of unprecedented political stability and economic growth in the country, but they also set in motion profound social changes that would, in time, alter the political panorama of Peru.\n\nAs First Vice President of Peru under the Piérola Administration (1895–1899), Billinghurst was involved in several attempts to solve the Tacna and Arica territorial dispute with Chile. On April 9, 1898, a memorandum was subscribed between the Chilean Minister of Foreign Affairs Raimundo Silva Cruz and Billinghurst. It established that before a plebiscite could be held between both countries, an arbitrage would first be requested to the Queen of Spain, María Cristina de Habsburgo-Lorena (1858–1929) to determine the conditions of the vote.\n\nSubsequent events led the \"Protocol of Billinghurst-Latorre\" not to be ratified by the Chilean Chamber of Deputies. A direct result of this setback was the break of diplomatic relations between Peru and Chile in 1901.\n\nBillinghurst served as the President of the Senate from 1896 to 1897.\n\nThe elections of 1912 were the most passionate ones of the so-called \"Aristocratic Republic\" (a term coined by Peruvians referring to those in power that were mostly from the social elite of the country). The \"Civilist Party\" rallied behind the candidacy of Antero Aspíllaga, one of the most prominent and conservative members of the Party. His opponents accused him of being a \"Chilean-born\" Peruvian unfit for office.\n\nThe Civilistas, however, were unable to manage the new social forces that their policies unleashed. This first became apparent in 1912 when the millionaire businessman Guillermo Billinghurst-–the reform-minded, populist former mayor of Lima-–was able to organize a general strike to block the election of the official Civilista presidential candidate and force his own election by Congress.\n\nOne of the main accomplishments of the Billinghurst administration was the establishment of important legislation that guaranteed the Eight-hour day in Peru.\n\nWhen Congress opened impeachment hearings against Billinghurst in 1914, he threatened to arm the workers and forcibly dissolve Congress.\n\nGuillermo Billinghurst was overthrown on February 4, 1914, in a military coup headed by colonel Oscar R. Benavides, Javier and Manuel Prado, and conservatives members of the Civilista Party. Later in exile, Billingshurst claimed the following:\n\"\"The young Prado, in an extense and pathetic speech, gave me the details and motives behind the coup: All of them (the mutineerered) recognised my patriotism, integrity and my capability to handle the government. However, the only and most serious mistake that I made was the course that my internal politics was doing to the country and, finally, I think the sons of former president Prado must «clean his fathers memory»\"\"\n\n"}

Due to the lack of raw materials available and the great damage by air raids to its industrial infrastructure, only 70 units were made. These units were retained for defense of the Japanese home islands during World War II.\n\nIn 1927, the Bofors company of Sweden had designed a new 75 mm AA gun which was purchased by the Royal Swedish Navy.

The aim of the texts was to give in 'a condensed form', a faithful and impartial description of each place. The firm of Samuel Lewis and Co. was based in London. Samuel Lewis the elder died in 1865. His son of the same name predeceased him in 1862.\n\nThis work contains every fact of importance tending to illustrate the local history of England. Arranged alphabetically by place (village, parish, town, etc.), it provides a faithful description of all English localities as they existed at the time of first publication (1831), showing exactly where a particular civil parish was located in relation to the nearest town or towns, the barony, county, and province in which it was situated, its principal landowners, the diocese in which it was situated, and—of novel importance—the Roman Catholic district in which the parish was located and the names of corresponding Catholic parishes. There were six subsequent editions, the last of which (1848-9) was in four volumes and an atlas.\n\nFirst published in 1833, there was a second edition in 1837, a third in 1843, and a fourth (in two volumes and an atlas) in 1849.\nThe title page of the first edition gives an indication of the ambitious scope of the work:\nThe work is in two large volumes with a folding map of Wales and separate county maps facing the entry for each individual county.\n\nThe 4th edition was transcribed and made available free-to-view online by the University of London.\n\nFirst published in 1837 in two volumes, with an accompanying atlas, it marked a new and significantly higher standard in such accounts of Ireland. Apart from \"The Parliamentary Gazetteer of Ireland\" published in 1845, it has not been superseded. The first edition is available online. A second edition was published in 1842.\n\nIn the 1837 preface, the editor noted that:\n\nLewis relied on the information provided by local contributors and on the earlier works published such as Coote's Statistical Survey (1801), Taylor and Skinner's Maps of the Road of Ireland (1777), Pigot's Trade Directory (1824) and other sources. He also used the various parliamentary reports and in particular the census of 1831 and the education returns of the 1820s and early 1830s. Local contributors were given the proof sheets for final comment and revision. The names of places are those in use prior to the publication of the Ordnance Survey Atlas in 1838.

{"id": "1845197", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1845197", "title": "Lethbridge Collegiate Institute", "text": "Lethbridge Collegiate Institute\n\nLethbridge Collegiate Institute (LCI) is a public high school in Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada, operated by Lethbridge School District No. 51 that serves grades nine through twelve. LCI was the first school in Lethbridge designated only for secondary students. It opened at its current location in 1950, but was founded in a smaller, adjacent building in 1928. Since its 1950 opening, several additions and layout changes have been made at the school. In August 2010, Chinook High School opened in West Lethbridge with over 700 students enrolled. Those that entered grade 11 in 2009 at LCI were permitted to complete their graduating year at LCI, but west Lethbridge students are now encouraged to attend the new high school, which was being built in conjunction with a western campus of Catholic Central High School, recreational facilities, and a public library.\nAs a result of Chinook's opening, LCI's enrollment decreased by a substantial 35% for the 2010–2011 school year and a further 11% to only 870 in 2011-2012; less than both Chinook and north Lethbridge's Winston Churchill High.\n\nA relatively extensive academic program is offered, including automotives, construction and communication technology, fashion studies, and four language studies programs. An Advanced Placement Program is offered in several key subject areas, including mathematics, language arts, and the sciences. Respected instrumental music, choir, and dance programs have helped LCI become well known in Southern Alberta for offering balanced opportunities to students in both academics and extracurricular activities. Athletic teams from LCI carry the names Rams, Clippers, Colts, and Schooners, although the latter two have fallen into disuse.\n\nIn the early 1900s, two schools near downtown Lethbridge were named with reference to their location. Built in 1891, fifteen years prior to the incorporation of the City of Lethbridge, the first was Central School. The small school was the only one that served secondary students in the Lethbridge area. In 1909, Central School closed and secondary education classes moved into a vacated building on 5 Avenue. The school became too crowded in the mid-1920s, and a struggle began between the school board and the city to have a new school constructed.\n\nIn February 1928, construction work began on Lethbridge Collegiate Institute at the corner of 4 Avenue and 15 Street South. The institution would become the city's first combined junior high and high school. The site had previously been used for aviation activities in the city, until the opening of Kenyon Field (now Lethbridge County Airport) south of Six-Mile Coulee in the summer of 1939. Construction of the school at the site finished in October 1928, but a fire in the spring of 1929 ravaged the new building. Classes had to be moved to other local schools until later that year.\n\nWhen LCI became too small for the city's growing population in 1950, a new building was constructed on the same block just east of the old one. Due to southern Alberta's booming population, twenty-one schools were constructed in Lethbridge between 1946 and 1965. Grades 10–12 were moved to the new building while grades 7–9 remained at their present location. The new junior high was renamed Lethbridge Junior High School, but kept the name for less than a year. In the latter part of 1950, the junior high adopted its new name, Hamilton Junior High School (named after a former teacher, principal, and superintendent, William Alfred Hamilton). The school kept the name for over half a century until its relocation to the rapidly expanding area of West Lethbridge as G.S. Lakie Middle School in 2003.\n\nNext door, classes commenced on November 22, 1950 at the new LCI. With increases in student population, new sections of the building were added in 1955, 1957, 1970, and 1986. Today, a section of Hamilton's old building houses Allan Watson High School. While the high school is not operated by district 51, the building is also being renovated to house the headquarters of Lethbridge School District 51.\n\nIn accordance with a grade reconfiguration in many public schools across Alberta, Grade 9 students began attending the school in the fall of 2003. Teachers, textbooks, and other classroom materials were brought in from local middle schools. The changes introduced a new term to the area: \"middle school\". With the middle school enrolling students for grades 6–8, the term \"high school\" was redefined to include grades 9–12. The changes created minor inconveniences for staff and other areas of the school. At LCI, it brought more students into a building already near capacity.\n\nCommunity members believed the restructuring by the government was targeted specifically at the City of Lethbridge, a move made to force the province to build an additional Lethbridge high school. Such a project had been anticipated for at least a decade. As expected, the announcement for the new school came in 2005. Enrollment at LCI exceeded 1,600 students. In an effort to reduce numbers, students living on the City's north side who attend LCI must be enrolled in a course not offered at Winston Churchill High School.\n\nLCI's enrollment peaked in 2005. The population of the city has steadily increased. The graduating class of 2007 was the first to complete all four years of learning at the school since its founding. The convocation in May, with the day's ceremonies at the ENMAX Centre, was centred around the a theme noting the historical fact that it was the first class to spend all four years of their secondary education at LCl.\n\nOn December 13, 2007, a note was found handwritten in a washroom stall.\n\nIts exact words were undisclosed, but school officials described it as \"a student's intention to shoot others, as well as possibly taking their own life, on December 20.\" A district official responded, \"at this point in time we're not planning to install metal detectors. We feel that we're taking the precautions by having a police presence.\" Extra staff members and local police officers patrolled the school's hallways for the week of December 17–21. Only days earlier, the words \"December 18, 2007 \" were found in a washroom at Paul Kane High School in St. Albert, Alberta. Officials at that school said \"extraordinary security measures\" were to be taken, but it was believed to be a hoax. It is unknown if the LCI incident was simply a copycat of the Paul Kane incident, but school officials in both cities requested that the perpetrators step forward; neither has done so. Both schools also made counseling staff available for any students who felt apprehensive about their safety.\nOn December 20, a similar note was found in a bathroom at W. R. Myers High School in nearby Taber, Alberta, indicating a student's intent to do harm on December 21. With a student attendance of roughly 20%, classes proceeded without incident. In 1999, a student opened fire at W. R. Myers, killing one student and seriously wounding another. In 2000, LCI was locked down after two youths were arrested and two firearms were seized.\n\nLCI is a maze of hallways that is split into different wings where various subjects are taught. The school building is land-locked and bounded by surrounding buildings. Victoria Park High School resides to the west of LCI. Businesses are to the north of the school. A church and residential homes are across the street to the south of the LCI building. The Catholic Central High School is across the street to the east.\n\nThe current layout has the campus divided into sections, seven of which are in the main building. The \"A\" wing, with the cafeteria, music rooms, and a small, secondary gymnasium, is the westernmost portion of the building. The \"B\" wing, a newer component of the building, contains mostly the English and Mathematics departments. The bottom floor of the large, southern \"C\" wing holds the library and two lecture theatres. The upper floors contain computer, biology, chemistry, and physics laboratories as well as several classrooms. The main \"D\" wing contains administrator offices, science, and social studies classrooms. The main gym and counselling department technically make up the \"E\" wing, though it is hardly referred to by that name. Construction technology, automotives, and the LCI Performing Arts Centre north of the main gym are the \"F\" wing, while a small, third floor section containing home economics is the \"H\" wing. Underneath the home economics area is a fitness centre housing various exercise equipment. The single-storey, peripheral \"G\" wing, a linear building separated by a 15-metre lane from the main building, houses a communication technology lab, electronic equipment, autobody, and an art room. The total floor area at LCI exceeds that of all the other schools in the district combined.\n\nA concession booth close to the main gymnasium provides various snacks that can be purchased during the day and at evening sporting events. The cafeteria at the west end of the building sells food for lunch. Students are also free to leave the campus for lunch as several fast food restaurants are within walking distance. In another effort to reduce congestion, LCI lunch period is almost entirely offset from that of nearby Catholic Central High School. The school also has problems with internal overcrowding. Hundreds of students are bussed from the city's west side daily.\n\nA lane north of the school is restricted to buses only. Students traverse the staff parking lot in the morning and afternoon to reach 13 busses, the majority of which carry students to and from West Lethbridge. Although a parking lot for staff with over 100 parking spaces is provided, no parking is officially designated for students. Competing with students from the other two area high schools also trying to park their vehicles, Lethbridge students must park their vehicles on 5 Avenue, or south on 17 Street or 18 Street.\n\nPacked on two city blocks with five other schools, the surrounding narrow streets are difficult to navigate for parents and students with cars during the morning and afternoon rush.\n\nFrom Monday to Thursday, the school operates from 7:55 in the morning to 3:00 in the afternoon with 77 minute classes. Grade ten, eleven and twelve students have four different modules with one doubled on each day of the week (e.g. module 3 is doubled on Wednesday). On Fridays, classes begin slightly later, running from 7:55 to 12:38 with four 62 minute classes and no lunch period. From Monday to Thursday, the lunch period begins at 11:49. The peculiar times are partly due to the district's school busses, which are also needed for elementary and middle schools which have later start and end times.\n\nIn preparation for Provincial Achievement Tests (PATs) at the end of the year, grade nine students operate on a similar system to that of the local middle schools. All courses run from September until June with the exception of option courses which are semestered. This is contrary to grades ten through twelve, where nearly all classes are semester long and students receive 5 credits per course. 100 credits are needed to graduate, per Alberta Learning requirements. Each credit signifies approximately 125 hours of classroom instruction. Of their final sixteen high school modules (4 in grade eleven and 4 in grade twelve), students are permitted to take three spare modules with a general restriction of one per year in grade eleven and one per semester in grade twelve.\n\nDue to the high enrollment, several teachers have had their classrooms segregated from their main department. In recent years, the teachers were left without classrooms and had to make use of whatever rooms were available during a particular module. As a result, the building is now much less departmentalized than was originally planned.\n\nNumerous scholarships are offered annually for students. For some students, applying for a scholarship is not necessary; grade 11 or 12 students with an overall average above 80% are eligible to receive $400 via Rutherford Scholarships. Entry into the National Honor Society is also offered to them, requiring students to complete a minimum of 10 hours community service over the course of the year. The Society participates in directing annual functions such as \"Parent-Teacher Evening\". In the community, the group assists at the Chinook Regional Hospital and at Salvation Army functions, such as bell ringing.\n\nLCI students are encouraged to remain within the city for their post-secondary students and attend the University of Lethbridge by representatives from that school. Accordingly, it is easier for local students to be rewarded with scholarships, and several are only available for students who attended high school in Southern Alberta. A high number of students also go on to attend the Universities of Calgary and Alberta, as well as Lethbridge College. In a 2009 Fraser Institute report, which was conducted from the previous school year, LCI was ranked 162nd among Alberta high school schools, down significantly from a rank of 102nd in the previous 5 years. More promising is the fact that the number of students dropping out of school before completion has steadily decreased, on average, provincewide. While data is not available for individual institutions, the number of students completing school has also increased districtwide.\n\nSimilar to a long-running program in place at Winston Churchill High School, an advisor program was introduced in the fall of 2006. The program consists of an 8-minute session between the first two periods during which students of all grades meet with a teacher to whom they were randomly assigned at the beginning of the year. More personal than that of the counselling department, the program offers the opportunity for students to seek advice from an influential adult. Administrative duties, such as public announcements and the handing out of report cards and newsletters, is done in sessions. Advisors also make mid-semester phone-home reports to parents. Most students do not have their advisor as a classroom instructor. In most circumstances, students will have the same advisor for all four years of high school.\n\nThe Student Council consists of a president, four vice presidents (one elected from each grade), a secretary, a treasurer, a Spirit Coordinator, and an Activity Coordinator. Members of the council perform administrative duties such as the organization of assemblies and school functions. The vice presidential positions are intended to provide student representation with a closer connection to the administration within respective grades, but they have been criticised for being simply symbolic.\n\nThe budget designated to the council is low. The activities, for which members through their campaign promises were initially voted to organize, seldom happen. The president, with help from other council members, will normally \"emcee\" pep rallies geared toward increasing school spirit and promoting the fine arts. Until 2006, elections for all positions were held in late September or early October. Now, elections for all positions (except for the grade nine vice-president) are held in June for the elected to take office in the following year.\n\nThe Advanced Placement Program (AP) at LCI was a program highly promoted at feeder schools, locally compared to the International Baccalaureate program (IB) offered at Winston Churchill. Advanced Placement classes are no longer offered at the school. In grade 8 classes at middle school, students had to achieve a final average above 80% to enter AP classes in grade 9. The program was intended to give students an opportunity to learn in subjects beyond the basic curriculum. Some graduates of the AP program have stated that the material learned was similar to first-year university courses. The program consists of advanced courses in mathematics, biology, physics, chemistry, English, and social studies.\n\nMore extracurricular activities and \"more peaceful\" classrooms are among the praises for the program. However, for the majority of the courses, little to no extra work is completed in the advanced stream versus the regular courses. Unlike the IB program, Alberta Learning states that students may not switch between the lowest streams and Advanced Placement in grades 11 and 12; but they can switch between the various streams in grades 9 and 10. Both AP and IB programs are presented based on their different strengths and weaknesses, and students are encouraged to select their high school based on other factors such as their location in Lethbridge. Annually, LCI students take provincial advanced placement exams in various subjects, including World History, literature and physics, in grade 12.\n\nThe main gymnasium has a large \"Wall of Champions\" along the east and south wall, timelining provincial athletic victories since the move to the new building. Several hallways are lined with framed photographs of past LCI athletic teams, choirs, and councils that date back to the early 1980s. The \"L.C.I. Wall of Distinction\" profiles dozens of notable graduates. Two or three members are inducted each year in a prominent school assembly, usually with the inductees, as well as the city's mayor, in attendance.\n\nLCI has an active Canadian football program that regularly produces future Canadian Football League as well as Division I players in the United States. The latest is Jon Gott, a 2004 graduate who went on to Boise State University. In 2008, the LCI football team did an exchange with Crestwood High School in Peterborough, Ontario.\n\nWith several members winning various awards at provincial competitions, the 2006–07 year was promising for the LCI wrestling team.\nElsewhere, a former LCI student and rugby union player, Ashley Patzer, was named CIS player of the year for 2006. She was also later named the University of Lethbridge Female Athlete of the Year. As of 2007, track and field, baseball, basketball, badminton, curling, golf, softball, volleyball, and girls slowpitch are also played at LCI.\n\nThe song is no longer used or promoted at school athletic events, mostly because of the elimination of cheerleading several years ago. Nonetheless, the song is as follows (sung to the tune of \"Anchors Aweigh\"):\n\nThe choral program at LCI is prominent, and is arguably the school's most successful extracurricular program. Choir is provided as an optional course at all grades. Auditions are also held annually for the school's three representative choirs:\n\nThe school has provisions for over 30 clubs. The most prominent of those that are active are 'Students Alive', 'Peer Support', the ‘Gay Straight Alliance’, and 'Travel Club'; the latter of which will travel to Italy in 2019. Also notable is a group called the Association to Kill Apathy (AKA), which does community as well as environmental work. On Remembrance Day of 2006, the group dedicated \"peace poles\", in association with the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, garnering local media attention.\nThe \"Collegian Column\" is a weekly school bulletin produced by faculty, which appeals primarily to older students interested in scholarship information. The \"LCI Journal\", the school newspaper, has not been active for a number of years. Concerning defunct clubs and media, the school leaves it to faculty to decide if a project is to be revived, pending student interest.\n\nLCI has its own small theatre, which had previously been a metal shop. The room has a sound system and some theatrical lighting; it also seats nearly 100 people. There is a fall theatrical production performed entirely by students at the Genevieve E. Yates Memorial Centre, located a few blocks to the west of the school. LCI has won several competitions in the local spring high school one act competition.\n\nLCI is well known for its student exchange programs. The most advertised is the exchange Japan; LCI regularly exchanges students with Sapporo Commercial High School, an institution which has also been informally twinned with LCI in a program implemented by Alberta Education. LCI students made the trip to Japan in early July 2007. In the 2006/07 year, the school also took part in an exchange program with a high school in Spain; several Spanish students arrived in the fall of 2006, and several LCI students departed for Spain in the spring of 2007.\n\nThe LCI dance program is rapidly expanding and features numerous styles, including jazz, modern, and hip hop. All programs are under the direction of Georden Olsen. Usually, sometimes several times a semester, professional dancers and choreographers from Calgary are offered residency to work at the school for as long as three weeks. The program's feature event, \"Summerdance\", is held in the spring at the Yates Memorial Centre.\n\nIn early April 2007, a group of LCI students travelled to Vimy Ridge with students from Winston Churchill and more than 3,600 students from across Canada. All of the students participate in events dedicated to the ninetieth anniversary of Canadian military victory during World War I.\n\n\n\n"}

The Type 14 number was designated for the year the gun was accepted, the 14th year of Emperor Taishō's reign, 1929 in the Gregorian calendar. Only a small number were produced, and it was superseded by the Type 88 75 mm AA gun in production before the start of World War II.\n\nDue to combat experience at the Battle of Tsingtao against the German Luftstreitkrafte’s fledgling squadron of combat aircraft, planners on the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff quickly realized that this new technology posed a threat which required countermeasures. This evaluation was further reinforced by reports from military observers on the European front in World War I.\n\nAfter the introduction of the Type 11 75 mm AA gun into front-line combat service, the Imperial Japanese Army quickly realized that it was underpowered and lacked the range necessary for civil defense of Japanese cities from enemy air raids. A larger version, designated the Type 14 10 cm AA gun was placed into production in 1925. However, it was expensive to produce and lacked accuracy. Only 70 units were completed before production was terminated.\n\nThe Type 14 10 cm AA gun had a single piece gun barrel with a horizontal sliding breechblock, and a hydro-pneumatic recoil system mounted on a central pedestal. The firing platform was supported by six legs, each of which (along with the central pedestal) had adjustable screwed foot for leveling.

{"id": "1845205", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1845205", "title": "Piedmont Avenue (Oakland, California)", "text": "Piedmont Avenue (Oakland, California)\n\nThe Piedmont Avenue neighborhood is a residential and commercial district in the North Oakland region of Oakland, California. It is named for Piedmont Avenue, a commercial street known for dining and retail. The neighborhood is roughly bounded by Temescal and Broadway on the west, Oakland Avenue and the City of Piedmont (a separate municipality, an enclave within Oakland) on the east, the Mountain View Cemetery on the north, and the on the south.\n\nThe Piedmont Avenue neighborhood was founded in the late 1800s. It developed after Mountain View Cemetery opened in 1863, bringing visitors and public transportation. The area was annexed into Oakland in 1897.\n\nAt the north end of Piedmont Avenue and Pleasant Valley Avenue is the hillside Mountain View Cemetery, which was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted and opened in 1863. It is known for Millionaire's Row, a section high on the hill lined with the ornate mausoleums of wealthy families, including those of Domingo Ghirardelli, Henry J. Kaiser, and Charles Crocker. Other notable people buried in the cemetery include civil rights activists Fred Korematsu and Bobby Hutton, poet Ina Coolbrith, and architect Julia Morgan, who also designed the nearby Chapel of the Chimes. The cemetery was featured prominently in the 2018 movie \"Blindspotting\".\n\nNear the center of the Piedmont Avenue commercial strip, at 4021 Piedmont Ave. is another Julia Morgan-designed building, originally built as the Fred C. Turner Stores. This 1916 red brick building hosts both restaurants and retail, and features glazed terra cotta in the style of the della Robbia family.\n\nNext door, at 4037 Piedmont Ave., is the location of the original Longs Drugs store, which opened in 1938. The building currently hosts a Posh Bagel.\n\nPiedmont Avenue also has \"the Bay Area's Book Row,\" with multiple independent bookstores concentrated within a six-block radius; the Piedmont Theatre, which is the oldest still-operating theater in Oakland (built in 1917); and the 1893 ice cream parlor Fentons Creamery, which was featured in Pixar's 2009 movie \"Up\".\n\nAt Piedmont Avenue and 41st Street are the Key Route Plaza and what is left of the Key System's C-line station, which was built in 1939. The former station is an angular building with a clock tower, which was restored by a group led by neighborhood activist Michael Lydon.

The company holds two royal warrants.\n\nHolland & Holland was founded by Harris Holland (1806–1896) in 1835.\nHarris Holland was born in 1806 in London. Although accounts of his background are somewhat sketchy, it is believed that his father was an organ builder, while Harris had a tobacco wholesale business in London. He was successful, and was often seen at various pigeon shoots at important London clubs, as well as leasing a grouse moor in Yorkshire.\n\nHaving no children of his own, he took on his nephew Henry Holland as an apprentice in 1861. In 1867 Henry became a partner and in 1876 the name changed to Holland & Holland. Although Henry was a full partner, Harris kept strict control and was the only one who could sign a cheque until he died in 1896.\n\nAt first, the guns bore the inscription H.Holland, without an address, and it is probable that these were built in the trade to his design. It is not known when Harris Holland started his own manufacturing, but it is estimated to be in the 1850s. This start makes him very unusual among the London Best makers, as others such as Purdey, Boss, Lang and Lancaster had apprenticed with Joseph Manton, while others such as Beesley, Grant and Atkin apprenticed with Purdey or Boss.\n\nIn 1883, Holland & Holland entered the trials organized by the magazine \"The Field\" and won all of the rifle categories. This set a new standard of excellence for the competition among English gunmakers. In 1885, patents were granted to Holland & Holland for their Paradox gun, a shotgun with rifling in the front two inches of the barrel.\n\nIn 1908, they patented the detachable lock feature with small lever, for sidelock shotguns. The last major development in the evolution of the sidelock side-by-side gun occurred in 1922, when the H&H assisted-opening mechanism was patented. This gun, the self-opening Royal side-by-side, has been hugely influential in gun-making throughout the world.\n\nIn the period after World War II under the leadership of new owner and Managing Director Malcolm Lyell, the company made sorties to India, where guns from the famous collections of the princes and maharajahs were bought back, developing an important market for second-hand pieces. In 1989, all remaining shares in H&H were bought by the French luxury group Chanel. Since then, the factory building, in use since 1898, has been extensively renovated and equipped with modern technology. Guns such as the Royal Over & Under or side-by-side double-barreled shotguns were improved and reintroduced, and they are available from 4 bore to .360 inch. A hand-built gun from H&H can cost around for a shotgun and close to for some rifles, with prices roughly doubling with luxury engraving, and there is a waiting period of 2–3 years between ordering and delivery.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Holland & Holland, along with other companies, fitted the telescopic sights to the Lee-Enfield No.4T sniper rifle.\n\nIn the 1990s, Holland & Holland started on a major expansion programme. The company has gunrooms in Dallas and Moscow. Its gun room in New York City closed in 2017. The company's London flagship store on Bruton Street has been completely renovated and expanded.\n\nCartridges developed by Holland & Holland:\n\n"}

The Type 5 number was designated for the year the gun was accepted, 2605 in the Japanese imperial year calendar, or 1945 in the Gregorian calendar. It was intended to replace the earlier Type 3 12 cm AA Gun as a defense against American air raids.\n\nIn order to address the shortcomings of the Type 88 75 mm AA gun, the Army Technical Bureau developed a larger version with superior range, designated the \"Type 3\". It was one of the few weapons in the Japanese inventory capable of reaching the USAAF B-29 Superfortress bombers that were attacking cities and other targets in the Japanese home islands. However, by late 1943 it became apparent that the B-29 was capable of flying at altitudes in excess of 10,000 meters, beyond the effective ceiling of the Type 3 12 cm gun.\n\nAn emergency project was initiated in December 1943, to address this issue. To save time, the existing Type 3 design was scaled up to 15 centimeters in caliber, with a corresponding increase in range and firepower. The project was completed relatively quickly, with test guns ready for firing 17 months after the project starting. However, by this point it was already too late — all major Japanese cities had been destroyed by the strategic bombing campaign against Japan, and American bombers were moving onto secondary targets. Japan lacked the raw materials and industrial infrastructure to follow through with mass production. Only two units of the powerful new Type 5 were completed before the surrender of Japan. One unit each was produced by the Army’s Osaka Arsenal and by Japan Steel Works.\n\nThe Type 5 15 cm AA gun had a single piece gun barrel with sliding breech, mounted on a central pedestal. The guns were not mobile, requiring deployment in fixed positions.\n\nComing into service at the end of the war, the two Type 5s completed were retained on the home islands as part of the bolstering of Japan's defenses against Allied air raids and against the perceived threat of Allied invasion. These two guns were deployed to Kugayama, Suginami ward in the outskirts of Tokyo. In a single engagement on 1 August 1945, they brought down two B-29 Superfortress bombers. American bombing raids, however, avoided Kugayama after the incident and as a result the guns had no subsequent chance to fire.\n\nA postwar American report evaluated the effectiveness of Japanese anti-aircraft fire. The report demonstrated that the Type 5 15 cm AA gun was more than five times more effective than the Type 3 12 cm AA gun, and that the engagement envelope was considerably larger.\nThe guns were deployed with a dedicated Type 2 electronic fire control system, with an above ground optical tracker and a targeting computer installed in a nearby bunker, this was linked electronically to the gun's fire control director, allowing precise target tracking.\n\n\n"}

Chono holds the record for most wins of the G1 Climax at 5, which has earned him the nicknames \"Mr. August\" and \"Mr. G1\". He is a former seven-time IWGP Tag Team Champion, and a former one-time IWGP Heavyweight Champion and a former one-time NWA Heavyweight Champion.\n\nChōno debuted in 1984 against Keiji Mutoh at a New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) event in Saitama, Japan. In 1987, he defeated Shinya Hashimoto to win the Young Lions Cup. After winning the tournament, he went on an excursion that started in Europe, wrestling for Otto Wanz's Catch Wrestling Association.\n\nAfter a while in Europe, Chono went on an excursion to North America, starting in the United States, where he wrestled in NWA territories in the Kansas City and Alabama areas. He would also later wrestle in the Canadian Maritimes and in Puerto Rico, where he, Hashimoto, and Mutoh formed The Three Musketeers.\n\nChono returned to NJPW part-time in July 1988. He came back to the United States later in October 1988 and teamed with Mike Davis in Continental Championship Wrestling (CCW), by then renamed the Continental Wrestling Federation (CWF), and won that company's tag titles as the Japanese Connection.\n\nIn April 1989, he took part in the IWGP Heavyweight Championship tournament, held at New Japan's very first show at the Tokyo Dome; he lost to eventual winner of the tournament and new champion Big Van Vader in the quarterfinals. During this time, he would return to the United States and have a brief run in Australia.\n\nUpon Chono's return to New Japan in October 1989, on February 10, 1990, he wrestled in the main-event of NJPW's second Tokyo Dome show, teaming with Shinya Hashimoto against Antonio Inoki and Seiji Sakaguchi, on April 27 he won the IWGP Tag Team Championship with Mutoh, and on December 26 he defeated his mentor, wrestling legend Lou Thesz, when Thesz came out of retirement for one last match. The next year, Chono solidified his main-event status with an amazing performance in the first G1 Climax tournament, winning the tournament in a thirty-minute final over Mutoh.\n\nHe won the tournament again in 1992, winning the NWA World Heavyweight Championship in the process. Since then, he has won the tournament on three more occasions. On September 23, 1992, Chono suffered a serious neck injury from a botched sitdown tombstone piledriver while defending the NWA World Heavyweight Championship against Steve Austin. On January 4, 1993, he lost the NWA World title to IWGP Heavyweight champion The Great Muta in a Title vs. Title match. Around 1993, he participated in his third G1 Climax tournament, losing to Hiroshi Hase in the semi-finals. In January 1994, he received a shot at the IWGP Heavyweight Championship against Shinya Hashimoto, though he would ultimately lose the match. In August 1994, he won his third G1 Climax tournament, defeating Power Warrior in the finals.\n\nA short time after winning his third G1 Climax, Chono underwent a change in attitude. Originally a clean-cut fan favorite during his NWA World title reign, he turned heel, angered that Power Warrior received a shot at the IWGP Heavyweight Championship before him, as he won the tournament. He also changed his image and adopted a yakuza gimmick, complete with sunglasses, menacing mannerisms and black coats and tights.\nChono's partnering with Hiroyoshi Tenzan and Hiro Saito as \"Team Wolf\" provided a foundation to NJPW's nWo Japan. Establishing himself as leader of its Japanese sister stable, Chono joined the American nWo in December 1996 as it was gaining momentum in World Championship Wrestling (WCW). He would also join its successor, Team 2000, which would eventually restructure again. In a match against WCW's Bill Goldberg, Chono supposedly \"shot\" the match (actually employing legitimate combat) and dislocated his shoulder.\n\nUpon returning to Japan, Chono rejoined NJPW, where he achieved much success. He won the IWGP Tag Team Titles on six occasions and also won the very prestigious IWGP Heavyweight Title in 1998. In 2002, Chono won his fourth G1 Climax tournament and had a brief, memorable feud with WWE's Chyna. He also became a booker for NJPW around this time. In 2003, Chono briefly joined Pro Wrestling NOAH for a handful of matches and was defeated by GHC Champion Kenta Kobashi on 2 May of that year. On October 13, he lost to Hulk Hogan.\n\nIn early 2004, Chono became the leader of the Black New Japan stable, which was the most dominating heel stable in NJPW until it was disbanded by Riki Choshu. As a reaction to this, Chono lead an \"Anti-Choshu Army\" with Hiroyoshi Tenzan and Black Strong Machine. Chono won the 2005 G1 Climax tournament, thus having achieved a record-setting five G1 victories. His success in the G1 has given him the nickname Mr. August.\n\nOn October 30, 2005, Masahiro Chono and Tenzan defeated the team of Shinsuke Nakamura and Hiroshi Tanahashi to win their fifth IWGP Tag Team Championship. The team went on to rename themselves Cho-Ten, a portmanteau of the members' names. They were stripped of the titles in late 2006 after they split up, and refused to defend them together. Masahiro Chono formed a stable with Shinsuke Nakamura in 2006 called Chono and Nakamura-gun, which began feuding with Tenzan's new group, GBH.\n\nChono continued to wrestle full-time in 2007, but also began working as a promoter, with New Japan permitting him to set up cards in different areas of Japan. Following the 2007 G1 Climax, it appears that Chono may be breaking away from his BLACK faction and formed the Legend stable, having sworn in wrestlers such as Riki Choshu, Jyushin Thunder Liger, Shiro Koshinaka, and AKIRA.\n\nOutside wrestling, Chono began appearing on Gaki no Tsukai's \"No Laughing Batsu Game\" as one of the attackers, usually giving Hōsei Tsukitei a slap to the face.\n\nIn January 2010 it was reported that Chono would be leaving New Japan and becoming a freelancer, after spending most of his career with the company.\n\nIn March 2010, Chono portrayed Nobunaga Oda in two matches during a Samurai Festival after leaving New Japan. Chono wrestled AKIRA, who portrayed Mitsuhide Akechi, on both days, winning the first match and losing the second. On August 15, 2010, Chono returned to New Japan to serve as the special ring announcer for the G1 Climax final match between Hiroshi Tanahashi and Satoshi Kojima. On November 5 and 6, Chono appeared in a series of shows in Taiwan for All Japan. On November 5, Chono and Mutoh defeated the Voodoo Murders (TARU and Rene Dupree). The following day, Chono teamed with Mutoh and Masakatsu Funaki to defeat the Voodoo Murders (Dupree, KENSO, and Joe Doering). In December 2010, Chono began working for Antonio Inoki's Inoki Genome Federation as a booker.\n\nOn March 6, 2011, Chono entered Pro Wrestling ZERO1 for their 10th Anniversary Show, where he defeated Daichi Hashimoto in his debut match. On April 17, 2011, Chono wrestled for Osaka Pro, where he teamed with Kuuga and Orochi in a losing effort against Shodai Tiger Mask, Billyken Kid, and Tsubasa. On August 14, 2011, Chono returned to Osaka Pro, teaming with TAJIRI and Zeus in a victory over JOKER (Kuuga, Orochi, and Tadasuke). On October 3, 2011, Chono returned to NJPW for a Team Wolf reunion match, teaming with Hiroyoshi Tenzan and Hiro Saito to defeat Osamu Nishimura, Koji Kanemoto, and Shinjiro Otani.\n\nIn January 2013, Chono signed with All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) as an advisor.\n\nOn August 25, 2013, Chono teamed with Joe Doering and defeated KENSO and AJPW President Nobuo Shiraishi in an exhibition tag team match.\n\nChono left AJPW in 2014.\n\nSince leaving AJPW, Chono has become a freelancer. His last match on record was on April 13, 2014, for Dotonbori Pro Wrestling, teaming with Daisuke Masaoka and Hayata in a loss to Super Delfin, HUB, and Gran Hamada.\n\nOn December 28, 1991, Chono married Martina Carlsbad, whom he met while on an excursion in Germany in 1987. Together they have one son (born July 4, 2006) and one daughter (born August 2009).\n\nIn late-June 1995, Chono's father died. His death forced Chono to miss an IWGP Tag Team title defense and take a hiatus, which forced him and Hiroyoshi Tenzan to vacate the title on July 7, 1995.\n\nChono appears as a gang member in the 2017 video game \"Yakuza Kiwami 2\", alongside Genichiro Tenryu, Keiji Mutoh, Riki Choshu and Tatsumi Fujinami. Besides appearing in numerous TV shows, he was the voice actor in the Japanese dubbed version of Blade 3 for Grimwood.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1845226", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1845226", "title": "Gift tax in the United States", "text": "Gift tax in the United States\n\nA gift tax is a tax imposed on the transfer of ownership of property during the giver's life. The United States Internal Revenue Service says that a gift is \"Any transfer to an individual, either directly or indirectly, where full compensation (measured in money or money's worth) is not received in return.\"\n\nWhen a taxable gift in the form of cash, stocks, real estate, or other tangible or intangible property is made, the tax is usually imposed on the donor (the giver) unless there is a retention of an interest which delays completion of the gift. A transfer is \"completely gratuitous\" when the donor receives nothing of value in exchange for the given property. A transfer is \"gratuitous in part\" when the donor receives some value but the value of the property received by the donor is substantially less than the value of the property given by the donor. In this case, the amount of the gift is the difference.\n\nIn the United States, the gift tax is governed by Chapter 12, Subtitle B of the Internal Revenue Code. The tax is imposed by section 2501 of the Code. For the purposes of taxable income, courts have defined a \"gift\" as the proceeds from a \"detached and disinterested generosity.\" Gifts are often given out of \"affection, respect, admiration, charity or like impulses.\"\n\nGenerally, if an interest in property is transferred during the giver's lifetime (often called an inter vivos gift), then the gift or transfer would not be subject to the estate tax. In 1976, Congress unified the gift and estate tax regimes, thereby limiting the giver's ability to circumvent the estate tax by giving during his or her lifetime. Some differences between estate and gift taxes remain, such as the effective tax rate, the amount of the credit available against tax, and the basis of the received property.\n\nThere are also types of gifts which will be included in a person's estate, such as certain gifts made within the three-year window before death and gifts in which the donor retains an interest such as gifts of remainder interests that are not either \"qualified\" remainder trusts or charitable remainder trusts. The remainder interest gift tax rules impose the tax on the transfer of the entire value of the trust by assigning a zero value to the interest retained by the donor.\n\nGenerally, the following gifts are not taxable gifts:\n\nThere are two levels of exemption from the gift tax. First, gifts of up to the annual exclusion ($14,000 per recipient for the years 2013 thru 2017 and $15,000 for 2018 thru 2020) incur no tax or filing requirement. By splitting their gifts, married couples can give up to twice this amount tax-free. Each giver and recipient pair has its own annual exclusion; a giver can give to any number of recipients and the exclusion is not affected by other gifts that recipient may have received from other givers.\n\nSecond, gifts in excess of the annual exclusion may still be tax-free up to the lifetime estate basic exclusion amount ($11.58 million for 2020). For estates over that amount, however, such gifts might result in an increase in estate taxes. Taxpayers that expect to have a taxable estate may sometimes prefer to pay gift taxes as they occur, rather than saving them up as part of the estate.\n\nFurthermore, transfers (whether by bequest, gift, or inheritance) in excess of $1 million may be subject to a generation-skipping transfer tax if certain other criteria are met.\n\nFor gift tax purposes, the test is different in determining who is a non-resident alien, compared to the one for income tax purposes (the inquiry centers around the decedent's domicile). This is a subjective test that looks primarily at intent. The test considers factors such as the length of stay in the United States; frequency of travel, size, and cost of home in the United States; location of family; participation in community activities; participation in U.S. business and ownership of assets in the United States; and voting. It is possible for a foreign citizen to be considered a U.S. resident for income tax purposes but not for gift tax purposes.\n\nIf a person is a non-resident alien for purposes of gift tax, taxation of gifts is determined in a different way. If the property is not located in the U.S., there is no gift tax. If it is intangible property, such as shares in U.S. corporations and interests in partnerships or LLCs, there is no gift tax.\n\nNon-resident alien donors are allowed the same annual gift tax exclusion as other taxpayers ($14,000 per year for 2013 through 2016). Non-resident alien donors do not have a lifetime unified credit. Non-resident alien donors are subject to the same rate schedule for gift taxes.\n\nU.S. citizens and residents must report gifts from a non-resident alien that are in excess of $100,000 on Form 3520.\n\nAccording to 26 USC section 2523(i), gifts to a non-U.S.-citizen spouse are not generally exempt from gift tax. Instead, they are exempt only up to a specified amount foreseen by 26 USC section 2503 (b) (that is, up to $155,000 for 2019 ).\n\nPursuant to 26 USC 102(c), the receipt of a gift, bequest, devise, or inheritance is not included in gross income. Thus, a taxpayer does not include the value of the gift when filing an income tax return. Although many items might appear to be gift, courts have held the most critical factor is the transferor's intent. The transferor must demonstrate a \"detached and disinterested generosity\" when giving the gift to exclude the value of the gift from the taxpayer's gross income. The courts have defined \"gift\" as proceeds from a \"detached and disinterested generosity.\"\n\n\"Gifts\" received from employers that benefit employees are not excluded from taxation. clearly states employers cannot exclude as a gift anything transferred to an employee that benefits the employee. Consequently, an employer cannot \"gift\" an employee's salary to avoid taxation.\n\nGifts from certain parties will always be taxed for U.S. Federal income tax purposes. Under Internal Revenue Code section 102(c), gifts transferred by or for an employer to, or for the benefit of, an employee cannot be excluded from the gross income of the employee for Federal income tax purposes. While there are some statutory exemptions under this rule for de minimis fringe amounts, and for achievement awards, the general rule is the employee must report a \"gift\" from the employer as income for Federal income tax purposes. The foundation for the preceding rule is the presumption that employers do not give employees items of value out of \"detached and disinterested generosity\" due to the existing employment relationship.\n\nUnder Internal Revenue Code section 102(b)(1), income subsequently derived from any property received as a gift is not excludable from the income taxed to the recipient. In addition, under Internal Revenue Code section 102(b)(2), a donor may not circumvent this requirement by giving only the income and not the property itself to the recipient. Thus, a gift of income is always income to the recipient. Permitting such an exclusion would allow the donor and the recipient to avoid paying taxes on the income received, a loophole Congress has chosen to eliminate.\n\nThe gift tax is a backstop to the United States estate tax. Without the gift tax, large estates could be reduced by simply giving the money away prior to death, and thus escape any potential estate tax. Gifts above the annual exemption amount act to reduce the lifetime gift tax exclusion. Congress initially passed the gift tax in 1932 at a much lower rate than the estate tax, a full 25% under the estate tax rate, while also providing a $50,000 exemption, separate from the $50,000 exemption under estate tax. The benefits were clear: a $10,000,000 gift would be taxed only $2,300,000, effectively only 23.0%, well below the estate tax rate.\n\nThe intention was to rapidly generate revenue in the Great Depression, effectively encouraging avoidance of the estate tax by doing so, while lawmakers at the same time publicly, and in both House and Senate, proclaimed the exact opposite objective. Moreover, this was directly at the expense of state tax revenues, as well as of future federal tax revenues. The primary beneficiaries were the wealthiest citizens, whom the estate tax was supposedly designed to target, since only they had enough money to freely make large gifts. This was the express intention.\n\n\n"}

It was one of the novels in the series which was adapted into the film \"Doctor Dolittle\".\n\nJohn Dolittle, MD, is a respected physician and quiet bachelor living with his spinster sister Sarah in the small English village of Puddleby-on-the-Marsh. His love of animals grows over the years and his household menagerie eventually scares off his human clientele, leading to loss of wealth. But after learning the secret of speaking to all animals from his parrot Polynesia, he takes up veterinary practice.\n\nHis fortunes rise and fall again after a crocodile takes up residence, leading to his sister leaving in disgust with the intention of getting married, but his fame in the animal kingdom spreads throughout the world. He is conscripted into voyaging to Africa to cure a monkey epidemic just as he faces bankruptcy. He has to borrow supplies and a ship, and sails with a crew of his favourite animals, but is shipwrecked upon arriving to Africa. On the way to the monkey kingdom, his band is arrested by the king of Jolliginki, a victim of European exploitation who wants no white men travelling in his country.\n\nThe band barely escapes by ruse, but makes it to the monkey kingdom where things are dire indeed as a result of the raging epidemic. He vaccinates the well monkeys and nurses the sick back to health. In appreciation, the monkeys find the pushmi-pullyu, a shy two-headed gazelle-unicorn cross, whose rarity may bring Dr. Dolittle money back home.\n\nOn the return trip, they again are captured in Jolliginki. This time they escape with the help of Prince Bumpo, who gives them a ship in exchange for Dolittle's bleaching Bumpo's face white, his greatest desire being to act as a European fairy-tale prince. Dolittle's crew then have a couple of run-ins with pirates, leading to Dolittle's winning a pirate ship loaded with treasures and rescuing a boy whose uncle was abandoned on a rock island.

Based on the novel of the same name by Howard Fast, it stars Jeff Daniels as George Washington. Also appearing in the film are Roger Rees as Hugh Mercer, Sebastian Roche as John Glover and Steven McCarthy as Alexander Hamilton.\n\nAfter repeated losses and defeats during the American Revolutionary War's campaign of 1776, the Continental Army retreats across New Jersey.\n\nAfter the army narrowly escapes across the river to the Pennsylvania shore, Washington meets with his officers. In the past six months, they have lost New York City and been chased through New Jersey by the British, and 90% of their troops have either been killed, taken prisoner, or deserted. In possession of the only boats of any use on that stretch of the Delaware River, the army has a reprieve from further pursuit until the river freezes and they must retreat again, leaving Philadelphia open to capture. Compounding their problems, Washington's closest friend, General Hugh Mercer (a physician in civilian life), reminds him that their supplies of food, medicine, ammunition and winter clothing are dangerously low. Realizing that something must be done or the Revolution will collapse, Washington conceives a plan to cross the river and conduct a surprise attack on the Hessian garrison at Trenton. The situation makes the plan appear all but impossible to Colonel John Glover, but due to his loyalty to Washington, he agrees to take the army across. When Washington proposes this operation to his staff, General Gates scoffs at its possibility, going over the line by calling Washington insane and unfit for command. Furious, Washington dismisses Gates from the camp at gunpoint, ordering him into silence. The rest of the staff laughs, but Washington and Glover silence them with the lack of advantages they have. On Christmas night, the Hessians will be feasting and drinking, so the morning after, hopefully still in darkness, the Continentals must take the fight to them while they are sluggish and hung over. The officers have only a few days to prepare their troops and weapons, and the soldiers, until it is time to cross, must be told no more than necessary.\n\nDespite their own fatigue and the winter weather, Washington manages to lift his weary soldiers' spirits, allowing the army to cross the river on the night of December 25–26, 1776. The crossing is done in one night, allowing the troops to attack Trenton at eight o' clock in the morning on December 26, 1776, and achieve a stunning victory, capturing almost all the Hessian garrison.\n\nThe film claims that none of Washington's men were killed or even wounded. However, the Army's standard military history textbook, ROTCM 145-20, \"American Military History 1607-1958,\" states on page 61 that in fact two were killed in action, two were wounded, and two men froze to death during the operation.\n\n\"The Crossing\" won a Peabody Award for excellence in 2000. Cinematographer Rene Ohashi also won the 2001 ASC Award for Outstanding Achievement in Cinematography in Movies of the Week/Mini-Series/Pilot, and the film's sound team was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Sound Editing for a Miniseries, Movie or a Special.\n\n"}

The ensemble cast includes Idris Elba, Oris Erhuero, Carole Karemera, and Debra Winger.\n\nThe story revolves around Augustin Muganza, a Hutu who struggles to find closure after bearing witness to the killing of close to a million people in 100 days while becoming divided by politics and losing some of their own family. The plot intersperses between the genocide in 1994, and April 2004, when Augustin is invited by his brother, Honoré Butera, to visit him as he stands trial for his involvement in the genocide.\n\nThe film depicts the attitudes and circumstances leading up to the outbreak of brutal violence, the intertwining stories of people struggling to survive the genocide, and the aftermath as the people try to find justice and reconciliation. The plot is also intercut with scenes of Prudence Bushnell, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs for American President Bill Clinton, and her failed attempts to stop the genocide and advise the American government and public to acknowledge the unfolding genocide.\n\nAugustin, a captain in the Rwandan Armed Forces, lives in Kigali with his wife Jeanne, a Tutsi hospital worker with whom they have two sons, Yves-André and Marcus, and a daughter, Anne-Marie, who is staying in an all-girls Catholic boarding school 150 kilometres from Kigali. Despite constant political disagreement, he remains in close contact with Honoré, a pro-Hutu Power radio personality working for Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines (RTLM). Augustin is also friends with Xavier Miango, a fellow Hutu officer and fiancé to Felicie, a Tutsi.\n\nBy April 1994, the power-sharing agreement between the Hutu-dominated Rwandan government and Paul Kagame's Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) is breaking down as President Juvénal Habyarimana is viewed by Hutus to be conceding too far in favor of the Tutsis. Augustin and Xavier gradually come to the distressing realization that the military is preparing for targeted killings of Tutsis and moderate Hutus on the behest of Hutu extremists in the government, but Augustin insists on taking the position of a moderate and remaining in the country to Jeanne's disapproval, despite history of anti-Tutsi violence by hardline Hutus earlier in the Rwandan Civil War and warnings from Honoré that violent action from Hutu extremists may recur. On the night of April 6, Habyarimana is killed when his plane is shot down, reigniting the civil war and signaling the start of mass killings of Tutsis and moderate Hutus by génocidaires comprising pro-Hutu government soldiers and militiamen backed by Hutu extremists, who were prior civilians, indoctrinated by Hutu Power propaganda; the following morning, Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana is assassinated by government soldiers. In response to the outbreak of violence, Xavier and Felicie seek refuge at Augustin's home.\n\nFearing danger to his family, Augustin calls on Honoré to use his influence in the community to safely transport his family and Felicie to the Hôtel des Mille Collines, which is harboring refugees, while confident that Anne-Marie is out of harm's way. As Augustin learns from Honoré that he is documented as a Tutsi sympathizer by the government, he elects to stay at home alongside Xavier until it is safe to head to the hotel. On route, Honoré manages to slip his passengers through génocidaire roadblocks, but is stopped at an unexpected military checkpoint, where the group is detained and a scuffle ensues.\n\nAfter a few days of hiding, Augustin and Xavier escape the house and trail a UNAMIR convoy evacuating expatriates, but are separated from the convoy at a militia roadblock when the officer in charge of the convoy refuses to help. Augustin's life is spared but Xavier is executed as he has been branded a traitor on the radio. Augustin eventually reaches the hotel but is unable to locate his family, and remains there for the rest of the genocide. Meanwhile, Jeanne awakens in shock without her sons at the Sainte-Famille Church over a week after the altercation at the checkpoint. Felicie is later seen lined up for execution by the church building.\n\nGénocidaires eventually breach the school Anne-Marie resides at to screen for Tutsi elements. Martine, a teacher at the school, shelters a group of students, including Anne-Marie, in a dormitory. The students rally behind Martine in solidarity as Martine refuses to divide them into Hutus and Tutsis, only for the group to be indiscriminately slaughtered by gunfire from government soldiers. Martine and Victorine, a fellow student, survive and find Anne-Marie alive but mortally wounded; as they escape, Anne-Marie eventually dies. The two soon find safety among the thick vegetation of the Kayumba swamps, where they are rescued by advancing RPF soldiers.\n\nTowards late-July, the RPF has scored massive territorial gains as members of the Hutu political and military elite and Hutu civilians flee the country out of fear of reprisal from the RPF, ending the civil war and the genocide. Augustin seeks out Anne-Marie at her school, only to find Martine and another woman tending to bodies in the dormitory where the massacre occurred. He grieves when Martine confirms that Anne-Marie is dead.\n\nHaunted by the events in 1994 and resigning to never learn of what had become of Jeanne and his sons, Augustin finds work as a school teacher and lives unmarried with Martine, who remains traumatized by her experience at her old school. Around the tenth anniversary of the start of the genocide, Augustin receives a letter from Honoré expressing interest to discuss in person the fates of Jeanne and his first sons. Honoré has been detained in Arusha, Tanzania, where he is tried by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda for his role at RTLM, after being on the run until his arrest in Italy in 1997.\n\nOn Martine's insistence, Augustin reluctantly flies to Tanzania to attend the trial hearings as a visitor, dithering to meet Honoré. Furious to learn that those charged for inciting the genocide live in relative luxury with ample medication and meals while his countrymen still struggle to survive, Augustin begins to question the point of his visit. His stance softens when he befriends Valentine, another genocide survivor. She invites him to listen to her testify in court as an anonymous witness, where he hears of the constant rape she endured in the hands of Interahamwe militiamen. Valentine is revealed to be mothering two sons.\n\nInspired by Valentine's courage to testify, Augustin is motivated to meet Honoré. At the meeting, Honoré recounts the events that unfolded at the checkpoint to the hotel in 1994: The soldiers were ordered to kill Jeanne, Yves-André and Marcus due to their Tutsi lineage. Augustin's sons were promptly shot dead, but in their excitement, the soldiers presumed Jeanne was also dead despite only being knocked unconscious by a rifle butt. Honoré hid Jeanne in a ditch, before carrying her to the safety of the church at night. For objecting to the kill order, Honoré was listed as a traitor and lost his privilege for safety, forcing him into exile and being unable to aid Jeanne any further. Honoré would later learn that while Jeanne was initially safe and pleaded to join Augustin at the hotel, she was raped by soldiers after the military began to probe the church for Tutsis. With the imminent threat of being killed, Jeanne sacrificed herself with a grenade to save a few rape victims and inflict injury on her aggressors.\n\nReflecting on Honoré's revelation, Augustin finally finds peace and returns to Rwanda to raise his new family with Martine, who is now expecting a son. The film closes with Martine laying flowers at the remains of the school dormitory before attending a nearby Gacaca court to recount her experiences in the genocide.\n\n\nAlthough this film originally aired on HBO, it was later broadcast by PBS and followed with a panel discussion by journalist Jeff Greenfield. Paul Bonerwitz is one of the speakers.\n\nIn contrast to \"Hotel Rwanda\", which was rated PG-13 and had most of the genocide violence subtly implied rather than explicitly shown, this film was noted for its more gruesome and graphic portrayal of the violence, which gave it a TV-MA rating. In addition, various scenes set in Rwanda were shot in location in and around Kigali, with prominent landmarks such as Hôtel des Mille Collines and the Sainte-Famille Church featured.\n\n\n"}

The gun crew worked from a raised platform with a modest amount of protection from the sides - the twin 20 mm gun fired through a large Gun shield gave further protection for the crew from that direction.\n\nIn November 1941, development began on an anti-aircraft version of the Type 98 with a 20 mm AA gun. During development of the AA gun tank, the Imperial Japanese Army experimented with various configurations.\n\nAn earlier produced single gun prototype was designated the Type 98 Ta-Se anti-aircraft tank in November 1941.

He graduated from Oberlin College in 1977.\n\n\"Wheeling Motel\" (Knopf, 2009), had selections put to music for the record \"Readings from Wheeling Motel\". Wright wrote the lyrics to and performs the Clem Snide song \"Encounter at 3AM\" on the album \"Hungry Bird\" (2009). Wright's most recent books include \"Kindertotenwald\" (Knopf, 2011), a collection of sixty-five prose poems concluding with a love poem to his wife, written while Wright had terminal lung cancer. The poem won \"Poetry\" magazine's premier annual literary prize for best work published in the magazine during 2011.

Once the context kicks in, you may find yourself trying to track down every word he's written.\"\n\nSome critics were less welcoming. According to \"New Criterion\" critic William Logan, with whom Wright would later publicly feud, \"[t]his poet is surprisingly vague about the specifics of his torment (most of his poems are shouts and curses in the dark). He was cruelly affected by the divorce of his parents, though perhaps after forty years there should be a statute of limitation... 'The Only Animal,' the most accomplished poem in the book, collapses into the same kitschy sanctimoniousness that puts nodding Jesus dolls on car dashboards.\" \"Wright offers the crude, unprocessed sewage of suffering\", he comments. \"He has drunk harder and drugged harder than any dozen poets in our health-conscious age, and paid the penalty in hospitals and mental wards.\"\n\nThe critical reception of Wright's 2011 collection, \"Kindertotenwald\" (Knopf), has been positive on the whole. Writing in the \"Washington Independent Book Review\", Grace Cavalieri speaks of the book as a departure from Wright's best known poems. \"The prose poems are intriguing thought patterns that show poetry as mental process... This is original material, and if a great poet cannot continue to be original, then he is really not all that great... In this text there is a joyfulness that energizes and makes us feel the writing as a purposeful surge. It is a life force. This is a good indicator of literary art... Memory and the past, mortality, longing, childhood, time, space, geography and loneliness, are all the poet's playthings. In these conversations with himself, Franz Wright shows how the mind works with his feelings and his brain's agility in its struggle with the heart.\"\n\nCultural critic for the \"Chicago Tribune\" Julia Keller says that \"Kindertotenwald\" is \"ultimately about joy and grace and the possibility of redemption, about coming out whole on the other side of emotional catastrophe.\" \"This collection, like all of Wright's book, combines familiar, colloquial phrases--the daily lingo you hear everywhere--with the sudden sharpness of a phrase you've never heard anywhere, but that sounds just as familiar, just as inevitable. These pieces are written in closely packed prose, like miniature short stories, but they have a fierce lilting beauty that marks them as poetry. Reading 'Kindertotenwald' is like walking through a plate-glass window on purpose. There is--predictably--pain, but once you've made it a few steps past the threshold, you realize it wasn't glass after all, only air, and that the shattering sound you heard was your own heart breaking. Healing, though, is possible. \"Soon, soon,\" the poet writes in \"Nude With Handgun and Rosary,\" \"between one instant and the next, you will be well.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

They may be organized by a national organization, such as the Canadian Owners and Pilots Association or the Experimental Aircraft Association, the airport owner or authority, a flying club, an aircraft type club or by a group of friends meeting perhaps for a barbecue and to socialize.\n\nThe term \"fly-in\" is not formally defined in the aviation legislation of many countries and it may refer to a range of events, while in others it has a specific legal meaning. For example, in Canada fly-ins may not legally include air displays or competitive flying.\n\nBoth fly-ins and airshows evolved out of the first aviation meets held in the pioneering days of flying, early in the twentieth century, before the First World War.\n\nAlthough there were some minor aviation meets in France earlier in 1909, at Port-Aviation south of Paris, in Douai and in Vichy, the first major international aviation meet was the Grande Semaine d'Aviation (English: \"Grand Week of Aviation\") held in Reims, France between 22–29 August 1909. The event attracted some of the world's foremost pilots of the day, including Louis Blériot, Henry Farman, Léon Delagrange, Hubert Latham, Charles de Lambert, Louis Paulhan, Roger Sommer, Claude Grahame-White and one American, Glenn Curtiss. The event was primarily a competition for record setting. Curtis set a speed record of flying a biplane he had designed, winning the first race for \"Gordon Bennett Coupe Internationale d'Aviation\". Henry Farman set a distance record of in just over three hours. Hubert Latham won the altitude contest by attaining . The event attracted large crowds of spectators including 3,000 from the United Kingdom and 2,000 from the United States. None of the aircraft were flown-in, but arrived via ground transport and assembled in place.\n\nThe first person to actually fly into an aviation meeting was Hubert Latham, who flew to the 1909 Konkurrenz-Fliegen Berlin at Johannisthal Air Field from the Tempelhof field on 27 September 1909, a distance of . This was one of the several meetings inspired by the Reims meeting. Latham's flight was the first cross-country flight in Germany.\n\nFlying to aviation meetings was sometimes discouraged. For example, Robert Martinet wanted to fly his plane to the June 1910 Angers aviation meeting, but was refused by the organizers, on the grounds that this potentially dangerous flight would put his appearance at the meeting at risk. The expression in English most commonly used for similar events in the pre-World War I era was \"aviation meeting\" (in Europe) or \"aviation meet\" (in the USA).\n\nThe first aviation meet located in the United Kingdom was held at Doncaster between 15–23 October 1909. It preceded the second UK event held at Blackpool by only three days. Both events competed for the honour of being the first of their type in the country and as a result neither drew the expected public interest. The Doncaster event attracted a dozen aircraft and pilots, but bad weather prevented much of the planned flying and many of the trophies were not awarded. The event lost a considerable amount of money.\n\nThe first major competitive aviation meet held in the United States was the Los Angeles \"Aviation Meet\", held 10–20 January 1910 at Dominguez Field. Again this was a competition-style meet with almost all the aircraft from France. Louis Paulhan set a height record of just under one mile (1.6 km) and also took the prize for endurance with a flight of 1:49:40 that covered .\n\nThe first African aviation meet was the \"Grande Semaine d'Aviation d'Egypt\" held at Heliopolis, east of Cairo, 6–13 February 1910. The event took advantage of the good winter weather found in that country and attracted fliers from all over Europe. The event was organized by the Aero Club of Egypt assisted by the Aero Club de France and was sponsored by Prince Pasha, uncle of the Khedive of Egypt. Pilots flew from an aerodrome that was staked out in the desert that had a landing and take-off surface that was by wide. Competitions were flown between the twelve pilots participating and 173,000 Francs in prize money was disbursed. One participant was \"Baroness\" Raymonde de Laroche, the first woman in the world to earn a pilot's licence, who won a 10,000 Franc prize for her flight of .\n\nThe People's Republic of China has been a difficult environment for general aviation, having had severe limits placed on it in the communist era, but by 2011 the government agreed to lift restrictions and to promote the use of business and personal aviation. China's first fly-in was to be held 20–24 September 2011 in Beijing as part of a five-day conference on general aviation, but the fly-in was \"postponed indefinitely\" due to a Beijing Police Department helicopter crash that raised safety concerns.\n\nSwitzerland's fly-ins include the one from La Côte, near Prangins, which was held each every 2 years since 2007, organized by the local air-club \"Club Aéronautique Swissair Genève\" (CASG).\n"}

Former Illinois Governor Frank Lowden and Kansas Senator Charles Curtis were candidates for the nomination but stood no chance against the popular and accomplished Hoover. Chicago Mayor William Hale Thompson considered himself a candidate, but without the support of Ruth Hanna McCormick, his candidacy was unsuccessful.\n\nHoover was nominated on the first ballot with 837 votes to 72 for Lowden and 64 for Curtis and the rest scattered. John L. McNab delivered Hoover's nomination address.\n\nIn his acceptance speech he said, \"We in America today are nearer to the final triumph over poverty ever before in the history of any land.\"\n\nThat and other optimistic remarks about the country's future were used against him in the 1932 election, which he lost to Franklin Roosevelt.\n\nThe platform praised the Coolidge administration for the prosperity of the mid-1920s, and also promised reduction of the national debt, tax reduction, retention of the protective tariff, opposition of cancellation of foreign debts, settlement of claims from World War I from foreign governments, continuation of the Coolidge foreign policy, support of arbitration treaties, civil service protection, a tariff for agricultural protection and continued farm exports, aid to the coal-mining industry, continued appropriations for highway construction, the right to collective bargaining, regulation of railroads, a continued independent American merchant marine, government supervision of radio facilities, construction of waterways to help transportation of bulk goods, support for war veterans, federal regulation of public utilities, conservation, vigorous law enforcement, honest government, continued reclamation of arid lands in the West, improvement of air-mail service, restricted immigration and naturalization of foreign immigrants in America, continued enforcement of the Washington Naval Treaty, continued status of territory status for Alaska and Hawaii and called for more women in public service, right of the President to draft defense material resources and services, creation of an Indian Commission, an Anti-Lynching Law and promised continued Home-Rule for the American Citizen.\n\nAfter Coolidge announced that he would not run for a second full term in August 1927, Hoover emerged as the frontrunner. Illinois Governor Frank Lowden, Vice President Charles Dawes, and Senators James Eli Watson of Indiana, Charles Curtis of Kansas, Guy D. Goff of West Virginia, and Frank Willis of Ohio also loomed as potential challengers to Hoover.\n\nHoover had won respect by many for his work in the Wilson, Harding, and Coolidge administrations, but many party regulars distrusted his loyalty to the party on issues of both policy and patronage. Some progressive Republicans, such as California Senator Hiram Johnson, also disliked Hoover, but others, such as Senator William E. Borah, favored Hoover's candidacy. Many party leaders pressured Secretary of the Treasury Andrew Mellon to run, but at 73, Mellon felt that he was too old to run in 1928. Mellon sought to convince former Secretary of State and 1916 Republican nominee Charles Evan Hughes to run, but Hughes refused to campaign for the nomination.\n\nWith no strong alternative, Hoover appeared to be the likely nominee at the start of the convention, but many in the party still opposed his candidacy. A \"draft Coolidge\" movement emerged, but the movement collapsed once it became clear that Coolidge would not run again. With Coolidge out of the running, Senate Majority Leader Charles Curtis tried to rally Hoover's rivals around his own candidacy. However, Hoover won the nomination on the first ballot.\n\n\nAt the start of the convention, Vice President Charles G. Dawes, former Kansas Governor Henry Justin Allen, New Jersey Senator Walter Edge, New Hampshire Senator George H. Moses, Connecticut Representative John Q. Tilson, and Ambassador Alanson B. Houghton were mentioned as potential running mates for Hoover. Kansas Senator Charles Curtis was also mentioned as a possibility, but he was not yet ready to concede the presidential nomination to Hoover. After Hoover won the presidential nomination, Moses, Illinois Senator Charles S. Deneen, and former Massachusetts Governor Channing Cox were named as the most likely vice-presidential nominees, with a re-nomination for Dawes also a possibility. Party leaders considered nominating Cox or Dawes, but Cox was vetoed by Utah Senator Reed Smoot, and Dawes was unacceptable to Hoover and Coolidge for supporting McNary-Haugen.\n\nCurtis, possibly with the support of Coolidge, was nominated by the party leaders, and the convention ratified the choice.\n\nThe balloting by states was as follows:\n\nEach of the four days of the convention opened with a lengthy invocation by a different clergymen—one Jewish, one Catholic, one Episcopalian, one Methodist. Together, these four religious groups formed a majority of Americans at the time.\n\nAll of the clergy were based in Missouri, where the convention was held. Each was listed among the convention officers as an official chaplain.\n\nOn June 12, the opening prayer was given by Bishop S. C. Partridge of the Episcopal Diocese of West Missouri. Speakers on the second through fourth days were Catholic Bishop Thomas F. Lillis of the Diocese of Kansas City, Rabbi Herman M. Cohen of Congregation Keneseth Israel-Beth Sholom, Kansas City, and Bishop E. L. Waldorf of the Methodist Episcopal Diocese of Kansas City.\n\n\n"}

In May 2003 Kodansha released \"Slut Girl +α\", a reprint with an extra chapter.\n\nSayoko Bizen is a buxom, cynical, shrewdly intelligent, and sexually uninhibited loner trying to move up in the world. Sayoko quits her executive secretary job after her boss fails to seduce her, and she exposes his affair with a co-worker. By chance, she meets a meek and outwardly unimpressive young man named Satoru Ichi (actual name: Yuichi Tsugaru), a virgin whom she initially tries to scam by coming to his apartment as a massage girl, who Satoru mistakenly believes is a call girl. When Satoru is distraught to learn that she is not a prostitute and has wasted hundreds of dollars, Sayoko takes pity on him and decides to have sex with him. She quickly discovers that Satoru is blessed with an incredible libido and a surprising ability to perform sexually, which she takes advantage of by staying with him until morning. Because she loses her job as a result, she moves in with him, agreeing to have sex with him in exchange for room and board, and for additional money that she subsequently persuades him to give her for various get-rich schemes of hers.\n\nSayoko also introduces Satoru to a collection of equally curvaceous women, all acquaintances of hers. These include Franco-Australian aspiring actress Neena Canberra, former co-worker and martial arts expert Takako Tosa, and incompetent nurse Emi Tanba, all of whom Satoru has sex with. Borrowing seed money from Satoru, Sayoko recruits all three of these women to aid her in her biggest get-rich-quick scheme: developing and selling the rights to a product that combines many popular fads, which works out very profitably. She then leaves Satoru with his cut of the profits, but with the promise that she may come back to him someday.\n\nIn the bonus chapter \"Slut Girl Alpha\" that concludes the story, Sayoko returns to stay with Satoru.\n\nDerek Guder gave the manga series a three-star review in \"\", praised for \"distinctive\" and \"expressive\" drawings, and the fact that not only are the manga's women well made, but also the recurrent humor: \"The story lines are played up for comedic payoff, and you can't help but laugh at the characters' facial expressions liven up otherwise boring sex scenes.\" Timothy Perper and Martha Cornog praise the expressive translation of the English edition, and describe Sayoko as a \"tsuya/yoen\" woman, a complex figure with \"voluptuous charm\" and \"bewitching beauty\". They describe the manga as being a satire on modern life, especially the role of women in the workplace, and a \"long-enduring glass ceiling\".\n"}

She then resumed cruising in search of English merchantmen.\n\n\"Nonsuch\" captured British schooner \"Sancho Panza\" in early April 1813 and took the cutter \"Caledonia\" (8 guns and 40 men), of Nassau, Hinson, master, following a bloody seven-minute fight on the 9th. \"Caledonia\" had an additional 11 guns, of various sizes, in her hold. She had three men killed, seven wounded (two dangerously), and three men missing; \"Nonsuch\" had one man dangerously wounded and two slightly wounded. A report stated that \"Caledonia\"s crew consisted primarily of blacks. \n\n\"Nonsuch\" continued her patrols out of Charleston into 1814. In June, off Charleston Bar, an enemy ship of superior force and speed chases \"Nonsuch\", forcing \"Nonsuch\" to throw 11 of her guns overboard in order to escape.\n\nFollowing the war, \"Nonsuch\" cruised in the West Indies. In 1819, she, with frigates and , sailed in a squadron under Captain Oliver Hazard Perry, for the Orinoco River, Venezuela, arriving 15 July. their mission was to discourage piracy while still maintaining friendly relations with Venezuela and the Republic of Buenos Aires. Shifting his flag to \"Nonsuch\", Commodore Perry sailed upriver to negotiate an anti-piracy agreement with President Simón Bolívar. A favorable treaty was signed on 11 August, but by the time \"Nonsuch\" started downriver, Perry and many of her crew had been stricken with yellow fever. Commodore Perry died on board the USS \"John Adams\" shortly its arrival at Trinidad on 23 August. He was buried at Trinidad with great honors while \"Nonsuch\"s crew acted as honor guard.\n\nReturning to the United States, \"Nonsuch\" operated off the East Coast and in the Caribbean against piracy and made a short deployment to the Mediterranean.\n\nThe U.S. schooner Nonsuch, which sailed from this port about three weeks since for the Mediterranean, has put into Newport in distress, having encountered a severe gale in the Gulf stream on the 18th ult and lost one of her masts, her rudder, and several spars.\n\n\"Nonsuch\" was placed in ordinary at Boston, Massachusetts, in December 1825. She was sold in 1826, and broken up the same year.\n\nNotes\n\nCitations\n\nReferences\n"}

At that time, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and the Kingdom of the Netherlands were in personal union in which both nations shared the same person as their respective head of state, though remaining as two distinct and independent nations. Although the order was legally a Luxembourgish honour, it was often used by William II and his successor, King-Grand Duke William III, as a house order of the Nassau dynasty to reward Dutch subjects, beyond the control of the Dutch government.\n\nWilliam II conferred membership of the order on fewer than 30 recipients. His successor, William III, liked the ability to confer membership of this order at his sole discretion, and awarded 300 decorations on the day of his investiture alone. In the following years, hundreds of additional awards of the order were made. Indeed, there were so many recipients in the Kingdom of the Netherlands itself that the order was widely (and falsely) regarded as a Dutch honour.\n\nMembership of the Order of the Oak Crown ceased to be awarded to Dutch subjects in 1890, when Queen Wilhelmina, as the only remaining member of the House of Orange-Nassau, succeeded her father as new Queen of the Netherlands. Since the \"Erneuter Erbverein\", the Salic Law-based house-treaty between the two branches of the House of Nassau (the junior branch of \"Orange-Nassau\" and the senior branch of \"Nassau-Weilburg\" (present-day \"Luxembourg-Nassau\")), did not allow women to succeed to the throne of Luxembourg as long as male heirs of the House of Nassau (in both branches) existed, the throne of Luxembourg went to a German relative of the new Dutch queen, also her maternal great-uncle Adolphe, Duke of Nassau, who became Grand Duke of Luxembourg at age 73. The Order of the Oak Crown remained a solely Luxembourgish honour; subsequently, the Netherlands established the Order of Orange-Nassau instead.\n\nSince the accession of Grand Duke Adolphe, the order has been primarily used as an award for Luxembourgish citizens, although membership has occasionally been conferred on foreigners, mainly on members of foreign royal families or on eminent foreigners with Luxembourgish ancestors.\n\nThe Grand Duke of Luxembourg is the Grand Master of the order.\n\nAfter the abdication of King-Grand Duke William I in 1841, his successor William II granted Luxembourg a written anti-liberal constitution (called \"the Charter\") in order to strengthen his authority over the country. At the same occasion, he established the Order of the Oak Crown with the idea to be able to reward loyal supporters of his regime in liberal-minded Luxembourg.\n\nThe badge, the ribbon, and the (then) four-class hierarchy of the order were inspired by the Russian Order of St. George. This was probably due to the fact that William II was married to a daughter of Emperor Paul I of Russia, and that he had received the Order of St. George for his meritorious command in the Battle of Waterloo.\n\nNowadays, the order consists of five grades:\n\n\nplus gilt, silver and bronze medals, who wear the medal on a chest ribbon on the left chest.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1845365", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1845365", "title": "Shikata ga nai", "text": "Shikata ga nai\n\n, , is a Japanese language phrase meaning \"it cannot be helped\" or \"nothing can be done about it\". , is an alternative.\n\nThe phrase has been used by many western writers to describe the ability of the Japanese people to maintain dignity in the face of an unavoidable tragedy or injustice, particularly when the circumstances are beyond their control, somewhat similar to \"c'est la vie\" in French. Historically, it has been applied to situations in which masses of Japanese people as a whole have been made to endure during World War II, including the Allied occupation of Japan and the internment of Japanese Americans and Japanese Canadians. Thus, when Emperor Shōwa (Hirohito) was asked, in his first ever press conference given in Tokyo in 1975, what he thought of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, he answered: \"It's very regrettable that nuclear bombs were dropped and I feel sorry for the citizens of Hiroshima but it couldn't be helped because that happened in wartime.\"\nIn \"Asian American Women: The \"Frontiers\" Reader\", author Debbie Storrs states:\nThe Japanese phrase \"shikata ga nai\", or \"it can't be helped,\" indicates cultural norms over which one has little control... This notion of suffering in part stems from \"shikata ga nai\": failing to follow cultural norms and social conventions led to a life of little choice but endurance of suffering.\n\nThe phrase also can have negative connotations, as some may perceive the lack of reaction to adversity as complacence, both to social and political forces. In a \"Business Week\" article, a Western businessman says of Japanese people:\nHe encourages Japanese not to succumb to the \"shikata ga nai\" mentality but to get angry and start behaving like citizens. 'Japanese people listen to me because I'm always pushing what the possibilities are and how things can change... to ensure positive economic and political prospects...'\n\nThe phrase appears as an important theme in a range of books relating to major events in the history of the Japanese people. Jeanne Wakatsuki Houston's \"Farewell to Manzanar\" devoted a chapter to the concept to explain why the Japanese Americans interned in the US during World War II did not put up more of a struggle against the restrictive conditions and policies put upon them. The historical manga \"Barefoot Gen\" shows many of the citizens in Hiroshima using the phrase \"Shikata ga nai\" to explain why they accept the military rule, and the acceptance of the below-poverty conditions that cause many of their citizens to starve. Similarly, John Hersey's \"Hiroshima\" applies the phrase after efforts to assist fatally injured \"hibakusha\" ceased.\n\nJames Clavell used the phrase in his novel \"Shōgun\". The Japanese characters explain it to the westerner who comes to see its wisdom. \n\nThe phrase is also introduced or explained by Japanese or Japanese-American characters in books such as David Guterson's \"Snow Falling on Cedars\".\n\nIn the book \"The Hostile Beaches\" by Gordon D. Shirreffs, the character Lieutenant Carney says the phrase. When asked what it means, he says it means \"Let's get to work\", not knowing its actual meaning. Later, Bob Dunbar says the words to confuse searching Japanese soldiers.\n\nThe Japan commentator Willard Price often made reference to the term in his dealings with the Japanese in the 1930s and 1940s.\n\nKim Stanley Robinson also includes the phrase in his book \"Red Mars\". The phrase is spoken by Hiroko early on in the Mars colonization: \"It was Hiroko who cut Arkady off, with what she said was a Japanese commonplace: 'Shikata ga nai,' meaning there is no choice\" (100). Pt 8, the final chapter of the book, is also called \"Shikata ga nai\".\n\nThe phrase has been adopted by the Metasploit framework as the name of a polymorphic XOR additive feedback encoder for X86 shellcode. The name is appropriate since the polymorphic encoding means there is no hope of antivirus products detecting malicious code encoded using this method.\n\n\"Shoganai\" is a track on King Crimson's 2002 mini-album \"Happy with What You Have to Be Happy With\".\n\n\"Shikata Ga Nai\" is a track on Van der Graaf Generator's 2016 album \"Do Not Disturb\".\n\nThe phrase appears in the lyrics of the song \"Kantori Ongaku\" by Devendra Banhart.\n\n"}

His mother has Irish ancestry, while his father is of Polish descent. He was raised Catholic in the Boston suburb of Newton, Massachusetts. Krasinski made his stage debut as Daddy Warbucks in a sixth-grade school production of the musical \"Annie\". Afterwards, he co-starred in a satirical play written and cast by his future \"The Office\" co-star B. J. Novak when they were high school seniors. Krasinski and Novak graduated from Newton South High School in 1997. Before entering college, Krasinski taught English as a foreign language in Costa Rica. From there, he went to Brown University to study English, and graduated in 2001 as a playwright with the honors thesis \"Contents Under Pressure\". During his time at Brown, he was a member of the sketch comedy group Out of Bounds. In college, he also helped coach youth basketball at the Gordon School in East Providence, Rhode Island. He then attended the National Theater Institute in Waterford, Connecticut. Besides training at the National Theater Institute, he also studied at the Royal Shakespeare Company in England and the Actors Center in New York.\n\nAfter graduating from Brown University, Krasinski moved to New York to pursue acting. He appeared in commercials and guest-starred on television shows, as well as doing readings of off-Broadway plays while working as a waiter. He starred in the play \"What the Eunuch Saw\", which was written and directed by his former college classmates Emily O'Dell and Isaac Robert Hurwitz. In 2000, Krasinski interned as a scriptwriter on the show \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\".\n\nKrasinski's breakthrough came when he was cast in 2004 in the NBC sitcom \"The Office\", a remake of the successful British TV series. In the series, a mockumentary about life at a mid-sized paper supply company, he played the role of Jim Halpert, an intelligent and mild-mannered sales representative and, in later seasons, co-manager of the paper distribution company Dunder Mifflin in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Krasinski and Jenna Fischer's characters also served as the central love interests of the series.\nTo prepare for his role, Krasinski visited Scranton for research and interviewed employees at actual paper companies. He also shot the footage of Scranton used in the opening credits. He appeared in every episode of the series and also directed several including \"Sabre\". For his work in the series (2005–2013), Krasinski earned approximately US$100,000 per episode of the third season of \"The Office\", four times his salary for the previous two seasons.\n\nIn 2006, Krasinski co-starred in Jason Carvey's independently produced, direct-to-DVD heist comedy \"A New Wave\" with Andrew Keegan and Lacey Chabert. In 2007, he co-starred with Anna Faris and Danny Masterson as Brevin in Gregg Araki's independent stoner comedy \"Smiley Face\" (2007). Reviews were largely positive for the film.

Krasinski guest-starred in a number of television series including \"\", \"Without a Trace\", \"Ed\", \"American Dad!\" and \"\". He also co-starred in films including \"Kinsey\", \"Duane Hopwood\", \"Jarhead\", \"The Holiday\" and \"Shrek the Third\", \"For Your Consideration\" and \"Dreamgirls\".\n\nIn 2008, Krasinski appeared alongside Renée Zellweger and George Clooney in the latter's directorial venture \"Leatherheads\" (2008), a period comedy about the early years of professional American football. He portrayed Carter \"the Bullet\" Rutherford, Princeton University's college football star and a decorated hero of the First World War. \"MTV.com\" praised his acting, describing him as \"an actor who's able to project both boyish warmth and intellectual concern\" while also stating that he \"manages the considerable feat of holding the screen opposite Clooney without melting in the heat of his trademark movie-star mega-wattage.\"\n\nIn 2009, Krasinski made his directorial debut in the comedy-drama film \"Brief Interviews with Hideous Men\". He wrote the screenplay for the film based on David Foster Wallace's collection of short stories, played a minor role in it and also served as producer. The film premiered on January 19, 2009 at the Sundance Film Festival and was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize and received mostly positive reviews. Film critic A.O. Scott wrote that \"though this experiment doesn't quite succeed, there's enough intelligence and insight in this movie to make it worth the attempt\" while Elizabeth Weitzman from \"New York Daily News\" felt that \"Krasinski deserves credit for having the ambition to adapt material as difficult as David Foster Wallace's short stories.\"\n\nThe same year, he starred in the comedy-drama \"Away We Go\" with Maya Rudolph, directed by Sam Mendes. It follows a couple searching North America for the perfect community in which to settle down and start a family. The film received positive reviews from critics.

Despite the film receiving negative reviews, his performance was widely praised. Krasinski was also one of the top candidates to play the role of Steve Rogers/Captain America in the superhero film \"\" (2011).\n\nKrasinski then starred with Drew Barrymore in the drama \"Big Miracle\" (2012), which covers Operation Breakthrough, the 1988 international effort to rescue gray whales from being trapped in ice near Point Barrow, Alaska. The film saw him play Adam Carlson, a news reporter . The same year, Krasinski starred in Ry Russo-Young's independent drama \"Nobody Walks\" with Olivia Thirlby and Rosemarie DeWitt. In the film, Krasinski plays Peter, a sound-designer, husband and father of two who starts developing romantic feelings for a young artist while collaborating on her first art film. His performance was praised by critics. Peter Debruge of Variety wrote: \"Krasinski is such an appealing actor that his likability serves to complicate Peter's behavior in interesting ways.\" \"Nobody Walks\" premiered in Competition at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival and won a special Jury Prize.\n\nNext, Krasinski starred in, co-produced and co-wrote the screenplay for the drama \"Promised Land\" with Matt Damon based on a story by Dave Eggers that released on December 28, 2012. The film follows two corporate salespeople who visit a rural town in an attempt to buy drilling rights from the local residents and was directed by Gus Van Sant. Krasinski came up with the film's premise and developed the idea with Eggers. They later pitched the idea to Damon. It received Special Mention Award at the 63rd Berlin International Film Festival in February 2013. He also narrated the documentary television series \"Head Games\" (2012) on the Discovery Channel.\n\nIn 2013, Krasinski founded the production company Sunday Night production with Allyson Seeger.

The show is a spin-off of a bit first introduced on \"Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.\" Merchant, Krasinski and Krasinski's wife, Emily Blunt, were brainstorming ideas for Krasinski's upcoming appearance on \"Late Night\" when the idea took shape. Jimmy Fallon then developed it into a recurring segment on his show. The show proved to be a major success for Spike; its series premiere was the highest-rated non-scripted premiere in Spike's history. In July 2016, the show received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination in the Outstanding Structured Reality Program category.\n\nIn 2014, Krasinski collaborated with his \"Promised Land\" co-star and co-writer Matt Damon on the critically acclaimed 2016 drama \"Manchester by the Sea\" which starred Casey Affleck and Michelle Williams. The film was written and directed by Kenneth Lonergan and is based on an original idea of Krasinski's. The film received six nominations at the 89th Academy Awards including Best Picture. Next, Krasinski co-starred in Cameron Crowe's romantic comedy-drama \"Aloha\" with Rachel McAdams, Bradley Cooper and Emma Stone. The film received a negative reaction and controversy from critics and audiences alike.\n\nIn 2016, Krasinski starred in Michael Bay's biographical war film \"\" based on Mitchell Zuckoff's 2014 book \"13 Hours\". The film follows six members of Annex Security Team who fought to defend the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya after waves of attacks by Islamic militants on September 11, 2012. Krasinski went through extensive physical training for the role and put on 25 pounds of muscle to play a former US Navy SEAL. That same year, he directed the comedy-drama \"The Hollars\". The film also marked the first feature film produced under his banner Sunday Night. Krasinski also starred in the film alongside an ensemble cast of Sharlto Copley, Charlie Day, Richard Jenkins, Anna Kendrick and Margo Martindale. The film had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on January 24, 2016. Peter Travers of \"Rolling Stone\" wrote that Krasinski \"tackles the most clichéd genre in the movie business – the dysfunctional family dramedy.\" and that \"he pulls it off with uncommon humor and compassion.\"\n\nKrasinski starred in the world premiere of the Off-Broadway play \"Dry Powder\" with Hank Azaria, Claire Danes, and Sanjit De Silva which was directed by Thomas Kail. The play ran from March to May 2016 at The Public Theater in New York City which sold out its run before opening. His performance was widely praised by critics and, later that year, he received the Theatre World Award for Outstanding Debut Performance.

The website's critical consensus reads, \"\"A Quiet Place\" artfully plays on elemental fears with a ruthlessly intelligent creature feature that's as original as it is scary – and establishes director John Krasinski as a rising talent.\" It also became a major box office hit, grossing over $340 million worldwide.\n\nKrasinski produces and stars as the title character in the television series \"Jack Ryan\", making him the fifth actor to portray the character after Alec Baldwin, Harrison Ford, Ben Affleck and Chris Pine from the film series. \"Jack Ryan\" premiered on Amazon Video on August 31, 2018.

{"id": "1845373", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1845373", "title": "White Heart", "text": "White Heart\n\nWhite Heart, also listed as Whiteheart, was an American contemporary Christian music pop-rock band which formed in 1982. White Heart's discography includes thirteen albums, the most recent of which was released in 1997. Original members Billy Smiley and Mark Gersmehl worked with a continually-changing cast of band-mates. In 1985, former roadie Rick Florian became the lead singer.\n\nSmiley started his own label, Cul-de-Sac Records. Gersmehl continues to write music and has released solo efforts. Florian is a real estate agent in the Franklin, Tennessee area and also continues to sing for various recording projects.\n\nWhite Heart formed in 1982 with two of its members coming from Bill Gaither's group. The first two albums were produced by Smiley and Huff, the two friends who formed the group and were listening to groups like Toto, Boz Scaggs, Journey, and Steely Dan at the time. The original lineup consisted of Billy Smiley (guitar, keyboards, and occasional lead vocals), Mark Gersmehl (keyboards and occasional lead vocals), Steve Green (lead vocals), Gary Lunn (bass), and brothers Dann and David Huff (guitars/vocals & drums respectively).\n\nWhiteheart was pursued by every major Christian label until Chris Christian heard their demo and signed them to Home Sweet Home Records and gave them their first record deal. By the time they released their third album, they were selling in excess of 250,000 albums. After their self-titled debut album was released in 1982, the band suffered its first lineup change. Green left the band, saying that rock was not his style. They went on to tour with David Meece and Farrell and Farrell for the next two years, building their fan base, with Scott Douglas as Green's replacement as lead vocalist. Green continued to sing background vocals on Vital Signs, and they had their first No. 1 single, We Are His Hands, with Douglas singing the lead, and Smiley and Green singing the harmonies.\n\nThe band released its second album, \"Vital Signs\", in 1984. Douglas was with the band for two years before being charged with aggravated sexual battery on June 30, 1985. He was sentenced to prison in March 1986.\n\nDann Huff left the band shortly after to pursue his dream of being a studio musician, and recommended his high school friend, Gordon Kennedy as his replacement for the WhiteHeart album, \"Hotline\". Later, in 1985, David Huff left the band to pursue other interests as well, including touring with Michael W. Smith. Eventually, he would join his brother Dann to form the hard rock band Giant.\n\nWith Douglas gone, the remaining band members began to audition singers. In 1985, they were surprised when they saw and heard their stage manager and roadie, Rick Florian, dancing around on the stage and \"karaoke\" singing along to the song \"Every Time You Go Away\", which the sound company used to sonically tune the room each night during soundcheck. A few weeks later, Florian came up to Smiley and asked if he could audition for the lead vocalist position, and he was later chosen as Douglas' replacement. He became a core member of the band and continued through the rest of White Heart's discography. Chris McHugh was also picked up to fill the drummer seat.\n\nWhite Heart's 1986 release, Don't Wait for the Movie, was released with their first major headlining tour and had major support from Sparrow Records and Billy Ray Hearn, who had personally come out to meet and hopefully sign the band. He hired Smiley as the producer for the record. It continues to be one of the band's most successful selling albums with three No. 1 song, and breaking all previous album sales. The band kept on touring and recording. Gary Lunn left the band to become a studio musician and was replaced with Tommy Sims.\n\nAfter \"Emergency Broadcast\" was released in 1987, White Heart made an important change with Brown Bannister coming on as producer for their next album. Bannister was known for working with Amy Grant, recording out at the Bennett House in Franklin, TN. Because of the fractured approach to having each member producing songs for \"Emergency Broadcast\", Smiley suggested getting an outside presence that every member would respect and respond to.\n\nThe band's album, 1989's \"Freedom\", featured a more original approach, with the band going to a rehearsal hall and working out all the material for three weeks before even going into the studio, and having Bannister help find the best songs, and pull the most out of each member both musically and vocally. \"Freedom\" has been hailed as one of White Heart's best ever. Songs like \"The River Will Flow\", \"Let The Kingdom Come\", \"Over Me\", \"Bye Bye Babylon\", and \"Sing Your Freedom\" would become live fan favorites for years to come. But stability remained elusive. The band reached the end of its contract with Sparrow Records and Brown Bannister. Also, Chris McHugh, Gordon Kennedy, and Tommy Sims left the band to become studio musicians.\n\nWhite Heart signed on with Star Song Records, and hired Brian Wooten (guitars), Anthony Sallee (bass), and Mark Nemer (drums) to fill the spots. With these pieces in place, the band released one of its best-known albums, \"Powerhouse\", in 1990. \"Desert Rose\", \"Independence Day\", and \"Powerhouse\" were No. 1 songs, and \"Desert Rose\" became one of their biggest anthems and career songs to date. Nemer left soon after and the band brought back former drummer Chris McHugh to do the drumming for \"Tales of Wonder\", with the exception of one song on which they used Jon Knox.\n\nThe band released \"Tales of Wonder\" in 1992 produced by Smiley and Gersmehl. They also brought back Brown Bannister as a production adviser for the project and announced Jon Knox as their new drummer.\n\nWhite Heart followed this success with \"Highlands\" in 1993, which also received critical and commercial praise. Touring non-stop from the \"Freedom\" through the \"Highlands\" release, this period was the most rewarding and captivating time of their touring career. Anthony Sallee left the band and John Thorn was hired to replace him for the Highlands Tour.\n\nIn 1994, the band released two compilation albums: \"\" and \"\", which included two new songs each and marked the end of the band's contract with Star Song.\n\nWhite Heart signed with a mainstream label, Curb Records, as the label's first foray into the Christian Music contemporary rock market. The band released \"Inside\" in 1995 and stylized their name as \"Whiteheart\". The album had mixed reviews from the Christian market, but was quite successful on the Christian radio charts and yielded several No. 1 singles in the Christian Radio Market: \"Inside\" and \"Even the Hardest Heart\" were both No. 1 songs. This album was notably produced and mixed by the legendary Ken Scott. This record marked an edgier sound and was also the band's launch through the newly created and now-defunct Warner Christian Distribution. The band's lineup continued to be a revolving door. Brian Wooten, John Thorn and Jon Knox all left to pursue other projects.\n\nThe remaining core members (Smiley, Gersmehl, Florian) regrouped to consider the band's future. They released their final Curb album, \"Redemption\", in 1997 using studio musician friends. It received critical praise for its depth and musical maturity.\n\nAfter \"Redemption\", Smiley, Gersmehl and Florian entered what they called \"a dormant or eternal sabbatical stage\". They have not officially broken up Whiteheart, but each of them is working on separate personal projects as well as Smiley producing full-time. Florian issued a statement in 1999 regarding the future of the band.\n\nOn August 25, 2006, White Heart received a Soul2Soul Honor award in New Albany, Indiana. Billy Smiley, Rick Florian, Mark Gersmehl, Tommy Sims, Jon Knox and Gordon Kennedy reunited to perform \"Over Me\" and \"Sing Your Freedom\". According to Florian, it was the first time in 17 years that particular combination of musicians had performed together, although Knox had never actually been in the band at the same time as Sims or Kennedy.\n\nIn July 2013 the band announced their first full concert since 1998 would be at Easterfest in Toowoomba, Australia on April 19, 2014.\n\nAfter Easterfest, a limited reunion US tour was announced, originally planned for late 2014. The tour was postponed to early 2015. Several venues were selected and tickets were sold, however, on January 13, 2015, the band announced the tour would have to be canceled due to circumstances beyond their control, and all tickets were refunded.\n\nFlorian, Gershmehl, Kennedy, McHugh, and Sims performed a benefit concert in celebration of the 30th anniversary of the release of \"Freedom\" on June 29, 2019, at the New Hope Community Church in Brentwood, Tennessee. Scott Bernard, who joined White Heart for the Australian Easterfest concert in 2014, handled Smiley's original album guitar parts. The album's producer, Brown Bannister, was also present, and vocalist Bart Millard of MercyMe acted as emcee for the evening.\n\nAlthough White Heart is considered one of the premier bands to ever play contemporary Christian music, and despite the many No. 1 hits and albums, they have never won a Dove Award. White Heart was inducted into the Christian Music Hall of Fame on November 6, 2010.\n\n\n\"Timeline\"\n\n"}

United States, 389 U.S. 347 (1967), was a landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in which the Court redefined what constitutes \"searches\" and \"seizures\" with regard to the protections of the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The decision expanded the Fourth Amendment's protections from the right of search and seizures of an individual's \"persons, houses, papers, and effects\", as defined in the Constitution, to include \"what [a person] seeks to preserve as private, even in an area accessible to the public\" as a constitutionally protected area. The case introduced the \"Katz\" test to determine a reasonable expectation of privacy, defined as a two-part test written in a concurrence by Justice John Marshall Harlan II. The \"Katz\" test has been used in thousands of cases, particularly with the advancement of technology that poses new questions on expectations of privacy.\n\nCharles Katz was a resident of Los Angeles, California, who had long been involved in sports betting. By the mid-1960s, he had become \"probably the preeminent college basketball handicapper in America.\" In February 1965, Katz on several occasions used a public telephone booth near his apartment on Sunset Boulevard to provide his gambling handicaps to bookmakers in Boston and Miami. Unbeknownst to him, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had begun investigating his gambling activities, and was recording his conversations via a covert listening device attached to the outside of the phone booth. After recording a number of his phone calls, FBI agents arrested Katz and charged him with eight counts of knowingly transmitting wagering information over telephone between U.S. states, which is a federal crime under .\n\nKatz was tried in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California. Katz's lawyer made a motion to have the court suppress the FBI's recordings as evidence, arguing that because the FBI agents did not have a search warrant allowing them to place their listening device, the recordings had been made in violation of the Fourth Amendment and should be inadmissible per the exclusionary rule. The judge denied his motion and ruled that the recordings were admissible, and Katz was convicted based on them. \n\nKatz appealed his conviction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. In November 1966, a three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit affirmed Katz's conviction, ruling that because the FBI's eavesdropping device did not physically penetrate the telephone booth's wall, no Fourth Amendment search occurred, and so the FBI did not need a search warrant to place the device. Katz then appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which agreed to hear his case and ordered \"certiorari\". The Supreme Court heard oral arguments on the case in October 1967, and took the unusual step of giving each party a full hour to argue their side.\n\nOn December 18, 1967, the Supreme Court issued a 7–1 decision in favor of Katz that invalidated the FBI's wiretap and overturned Katz's conviction. Newly-appointed Justice Thurgood Marshall recused himself from the case to avoid a conflict of interest because, as the previous U.S. Solicitor General, he had authored the U.S. government's brief in opposition to Katz prior to his appointment to the Supreme Court. \n\nSeven justices formed the majority and joined an opinion written by Justice Potter Stewart. \n\nThe Court began by dismissing the parties' characterization of the case in terms of traditional trespass-based analysis that hinged on, first, whether the public telephone booth Katz had used was a \"constitutionally protected area\" where he had a \"right of privacy\", and second, on whether the FBI had \"physically penetrated\" the protected area and thus violated the Fourth Amendment. Instead, the Court viewed the situation through the lens of how Katz's use of the phone booth would be perceived by himself and then objectively by others. In a now well-known passage, Stewart wrote:\nThe Court then briefly surveyed the history of American jurisprudence on governmental searches and seizures. It described how American courts had traditionally analyzed Fourth Amendment searches by analogizing them to the long-established doctrine of trespass. In their legal briefs, the parties had focused on the 1928 case \"Olmstead v. United States\", in which the Court had ruled that surveillance by wiretap without any trespass did not constitute a search for Fourth Amendment purposes. However, the Court stated that in later cases it had begun recognizing that the Fourth Amendment governed even recorded speech obtained without any physical trespassing, and that the law had evolved. The Court wrote:\nStewart then concluded the Court's opinion by ruling that even though the FBI knew there was a \"strong probability\" that Katz was breaking the law with the phone booth, their wiretap was an unconstitutional search because they did not obtain a search warrant before placing it.\n\nJustice John Marshall Harlan II filed a concurring opinion in \"Katz\" that has become more well-known than the majority opinion because of its importance to American courts' attempts to interpret and apply the legal principles in the \"Katz\" decision. It describes a two-part test which has come to be known as the \"\"Katz\" Test\".\n\nHarlan began his opinion by noting that he concurred with the majority's judgment, but then explained that he was writing separately to elaborate on the meaning of Stewart's majority opinion. Harlan explained that he interpreted Stewart's statements that \"the Fourth Amendment protects people, not places\" and \"what a person knowingly exposes to the public ... is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection\" to mean that the Fourth Amendment protects any time a person has an expectation of privacy that is both subjective and objectively reasonable in the eyes of society at large. He summarized his view of the law as comprising a two-part test:\n\nThe Supreme Court eventually adopted Harlan's two-part test as a formulation of the Fourth Amendment search analysis in the 1979 case \"Smith v. Maryland\".\n\nJustice Hugo Black was the only dissenter in the decision. He argued that the Fourth Amendment was only meant to protect \"things\" from physical search and seizure, and was not meant to protect personal privacy. Additionally, Black argued that the modern act of wiretapping was analogous to the act of eavesdropping, which was around even when the Bill of Rights was drafted. Black concluded that if the drafters of the Fourth Amendment had meant for it to protect against eavesdropping they would have included the proper language.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision in \"Katz\" significantly expanded the scope of the Fourth Amendment's protections, and represented an unprecedented shift in American search and seizure jurisprudence. Many law enforcement practices that previously were not \"within the view\" of the Fourth Amendmentsuch as wiretaps on public phone wiresare now covered by it and cannot be done without first obtaining a search warrant. \n\nHowever, \"Katz\" also created significantly more uncertainty surrounding the application of the Fourth Amendment. The \"Katz\" test of an objective \"reasonable expectation of privacy\", which has been widely adopted by U.S. courts, has proven much more difficult to apply than the traditional analysis of whether a physical intrusion into \"persons, houses, papers, and effects\" occurred. In a 2007 \"Stanford Law Review\" article, the American legal scholar Orin Kerr summarized:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1845389", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1845389", "title": "Doha Development Round", "text": "Doha Development Round\n\nThe Doha Development Round or Doha Development Agenda (DDA) is the trade-negotiation round of the World Trade Organization (WTO) which commenced in November 2001 under then director-general Mike Moore. Its objective was to lower trade barriers around the world, and thus facilitate increased global trade.\n\nThe Doha Round began with a ministerial-level meeting in Doha, Qatar in 2001. The aim was to put less developed countries' priorities at heart. The needs of the developing countries were the core reasons for the meeting. The major factors discussed include trade facilitation, services, rules of origin and dispute settlement. Special and differential treatment for the developing countries were also discussed as a major concern. Subsequent ministerial meetings took place in Cancún, Mexico (2003), and Hong Kong (2005). Related negotiations took place in Paris, France (2005), Potsdam, Germany (2007), and Geneva, Switzerland (2004, 2006, 2008). Progress in negotiations stalled after the breakdown of the July 2008 negotiations.\n\nThe most significant differences are between developed nations led by the European Union (EU), the United States (US), Canada, and Japan and the major developing countries led and represented mainly by India, Brazil, China, and South Africa. There is also considerable contention against and between the EU and the US over their maintenance of agricultural subsidies—seen to operate effectively as trade barriers. Since the breakdown of negotiations in 2008, there have been repeated attempts to revive the talks, so far without success. Intense negotiations, mostly between the US, China, and India, were held at the end of 2008 seeking agreement on negotiation modalities, an impasse which was not resolved. In April 2011, then director-general Pascal Lamy \"asked members to think hard about 'the consequences of throwing away ten years of solid multilateral work'.\" A report to the WTO General Council by Lamy in May 2012 advocated \"small steps, gradually moving forward the parts of the Doha Round which were mature, and re-thinking those where greater differences remained.\" Adoption of the Bali Ministerial Declaration on 7 December 2013 for the first time successfully addressed bureaucratic barriers to commerce—a small part of the Doha Round agenda. However, , the future of the Doha Round remains uncertain.\n\nDoha Round talks are overseen by the Trade Negotiations Committee (TNC), whose chair is the WTO’s director-general, currently Roberto Azevêdo. The negotiations are being held in five working groups and in other existing bodies of the WTO. Selected topics under negotiation are discussed below in five groups: market access, development issues, WTO rules, trade facilitation and other issues.\n\nBefore the Doha ministerial, negotiations had already been under way on trade in agriculture and trade in services. These ongoing negotiations had been required under the last round of multilateral trade negotiations (the Uruguay Round, 1986–1994). However, some countries, including the United States, wanted to expand the agriculture and services talks to allow trade-offs and thus achieve greater trade liberalization.\n\nThe first WTO ministerial conference, which was held in Singapore in 1996, established permanent working groups on four issues: transparency in government procurement, trade facilitation (customs issues), trade and investment, and trade and competition. These became known as the Singapore issues. These issues were pushed at successive ministerials by the European Union, Japan and Korea, and opposed by most developing countries. Since no agreement was reached, the developed nations pushed that any new trade negotiations must include the mentioned issues.\n\nThe negotiations were intended to start at the ministerial conference of 1999 in Seattle, and be called the Millennium Round but, due to several different events including protest activity outside the conference (the so-called \"Battle of Seattle\"), the negotiations were never started. Due to the failure of the Millennium Round, it was decided that negotiations would not start again until the next ministerial conference in 2001 in Doha, Qatar.\n\nJust months before the Doha ministerial, the United States had been attacked by terrorists on September 11th, 2001. Some government officials called for greater political cohesion and saw the trade negotiations as a means toward that end. Some officials thought that a new round of multilateral trade negotiations could help a world economy weakened by recession and terrorism-related uncertainty. According to the WTO, the year 2001 showed \"...the lowest growth in output in more than two decades,\" and world trade contracted that year.\n\nThe Doha round officially began in November 2001, committing all countries to negotiations opening agricultural and manufacturing markets, as well as trade-in-services (GATS) negotiations and expanded intellectual property regulation (TRIPS). The intent of the round, according to its proponents, was to make trade rules fairer for developing countries. However, by 2008, critics were charging that the round would expand a system of trade rules here were bad for development and interfered excessively with countries' domestic \"policy space\".\n\nThe 2001 ministerial declaration established an official deadline for concluding negotiations for the Doha round at 1 January 2005.\n\nThe 2003 Cancún talks—intended to forge concrete agreement on the Doha round objectives—collapsed after four days during which the members could not agree on a framework to continue negotiations. Low key talks continued since the ministerial meeting in Doha but progress was almost non-existent. This meeting was intended to create a framework for further negotiations.\n\nThe Cancún ministerial collapsed for several reasons. First, differences over the Singapore issues seemed incapable of resolution. The EU had retreated on few of its demands, but several developing countries refused any consideration of these issues at all. Second, it was questioned whether some countries had come to Cancún with a serious intention to negotiate. In the view of some observers, a few countries showed no flexibility in their positions and only repeated their demands rather than talk about trade-offs. Third, the wide difference between developing and developed countries across virtually all topics was a major obstacle. The US–EU agricultural proposal and that of the G20 developing nations, for example, show strikingly different approaches to special and differential treatment. Fourth, there was some criticism of procedure. Some claimed the agenda was too complicated. Also, Cancún ministerial chairman, Mexico’s Foreign Minister Luis Ernesto Derbez, was faulted for ending the meeting when he did, instead of trying to move the talks into areas where some progress could have been made.\n\nThe collapse seemed like a victory for the developing countries. The failure to advance the round resulted in a serious loss of momentum and brought into question whether 1 January 2005 deadline would be met. The North-South divide was most prominent on issues of agriculture. Developed countries' farm subsidies (both the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy and the US government agro-subsidies) became a major sticking point. The developing countries were seen as finally having the confidence to reject a deal that they viewed as unfavorable. This is reflected by the new trade bloc of developing and industrialized nations: the G20. Since its creation, the G20 has had fluctuating membership, but is spearheaded by the G4 (the People's Republic of China, India, Brazil, and South Africa). While the G20 presumes to negotiate on behalf of all of the developing world, many of the poorest nations continue to have little influence over the emerging WTO proposals.\nIn dispute resolution mechanism of the WTO regime, the collapse of the Doha Round talks at\nCancun in September 2003 has been attributed to Subsidies in agriculture and agricultural domestic support policies of developed nations\n\nThe aftermath of Cancún was one of standstill and stocktaking. Negotiations were suspended for the remainder of 2003. Starting in early 2004, US Trade Representative Robert Zoellick pushed for the resumption of negotiations by offering a proposal that would focus on market access, including an elimination of agricultural export subsidies. He also said that the Singapore issues could progress by negotiating on trade facilitation, considering further action on government procurement, and possibly dropping investment and competition. This intervention was credited at the time with reviving\ninterest in the negotiations, and negotiations resumed in March 2004.\n\nIn the months leading up to the talks in Geneva, the EU accepted the elimination of agricultural export subsidies \"by date certain\". The Singapore issues were moved off the Doha agenda. Compromise was also achieved over the negotiation of the Singapore issues as the EU and others decided. Developing countries too played an active part in negotiations this year, first by India and Brazil negotiating directly with the developed countries (as the so-called \"non-party of five\") on agriculture, and second by working toward acceptance of trade facilitation as a subject for negotiation.\n\nWith these issues pushed aside, the negotiators in Geneva were able to concentrate on moving forward with the Doha Round. After intense negotiations in late July 2004, WTO members reached what has become known as the Framework Agreement(sometimes called the July Package), which provides broad guidelines for completing the Doha round negotiations. The agreement contains a 4-page declaration, with four annexes (A–D) covering agriculture, non-agricultural market access, services, and trade facilitation, respectively. In addition, the agreement acknowledges the activities of other negotiating groups (such as those on rules, dispute settlement, and intellectual property) and exhorts them to fulfill their Doha round negotiating objectives. The agreement also abandoned the 1 January 2005 deadline for the negotiations and set December 2005 as the date for the 6th ministerial to be held in Hong Kong.\n\nTrade negotiators wanted to make tangible progress before the December 2005 WTO meeting in Hong Kong, and held a session of negotiations in Paris in May 2005.\n\nParis talks were hanging over a few issues: France protested moves to cut subsidies to farmers, while the US, Australia, the EU, Brazil and India failed to agree on issues relating to chicken, beef and rice. Most of the sticking points were small technical issues, making trade negotiators fear that agreement on large politically risky issues will be substantially harder.\n\nThe Sixth WTO Ministerial Conference took place in Hong Kong, 13 to 18 December 2005. Although a flurry of negotiations took place in the fall of 2005, WTO director-general Pascal Lamy announced in November 2005 that a comprehensive agreement on modalities would not be forthcoming in Hong Kong, and that the talks would \"take stock\" of the negotiations and would try to reach agreements in negotiating sectors where convergence was reported.\n\nTrade ministers representing most of the world's governments reached a deal that sets a deadline for eliminating subsidies of agricultural exports by 2013. The final declaration from the talks, which resolved several issues that have stood in the way of a global trade agreement, also requires industrialized countries to open their markets to goods from the world's poorest nations, a goal of the United Nations for many years. The declaration gave fresh impetus for negotiators to try to finish a comprehensive set of global free trade rules by the end of 2006. Director-general Pascal Lamy said, \"I now believe it is possible, which I did not a month ago.\"\n\nThe conference pushed back the expected completion of the round until the end of 2006.\n\nThe round had been planned for conclusion in December 2005—after two more ministerial conferences had produced a final draft declaration. The WTO pushed back its self-imposed deadline to slightly precede the expiration of the US President's Congressional Fast Track Trade Promotion Authority. Any declaration of the WTO must be ratified by the Congress to take effect in the United States. Trade Promotion Authority prevents Congress from amending the draft. It expired on 30 June 2007, and congressional leaders decided not to renew this authority for President George W Bush.\n\nThe July 2006 talks in Geneva failed to reach an agreement about reducing farming subsidies and lowering import taxes, and negotiations took months to resume. A successful outcome of the Doha round became increasingly unlikely, because the broad trade authority granted under the Trade Act of 2002 to President George W. Bush was due to expire in 2007. Any trade pact would then have to be approved by the Congress with the possibility of amendments, which would hinder the US negotiators and decrease the willingness of other countries to participate. Hong Kong offered to mediate the collapsed trade liberalisation talks. Director-general of Trade and Industry, Raymond Young, says the territory, which hosted the last round of Doha negotiations, has a \"moral high-ground\" on free trade that allows it to play the role of \"honest broker\".\n\nIn June 2007, negotiations within the Doha round broke down at a conference in Potsdam, as a major impasse occurred between the US, the EU, India and Brazil. The main disagreement was over opening up agricultural and industrial markets in various countries and how to cut rich nation farm subsidies.\n\nOn 21 July 2008, negotiations started again at the WTO's HQ in Geneva on the Doha round but stalled after nine days of negotiations over the refusal to compromise over the special safeguard mechanism. \"Developing country members receive special and differential treatment with respect to other members' safeguard measures, in the form of a \"de minimis\" import volume exemption. As users of safeguards, developing country members receive special and differential treatment with respect to applying their own such measures, with regard to permitted duration of extensions, and with respect to re-application of measures.\n\nNegotiations had continued since the last conference in June 2007. Director-general Pascal Lamy said before the start of the conference that the odds of success were over 50%. Around 40 ministers attended the negotiations, which were only expected to last five days but instead lasted nine days. Kamal Nath, India's Commerce Minister, was absent from the first few days of the conference due to a vote of confidence being conducted in\nIndia's Parliament. On the second day of the conference, U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab announced that the US would cap its farm subsidies at $15 billion a year, from $18.2 billion in 2006. The proposal was on the condition that countries such as Brazil and India drop their objections to various aspects of the round. The US and the EU also offered an increase in the number of temporary work visas for professional workers. After one week of negotiations, many considered agreement to be 'within reach'. However, there were disagreements on issues including special protection for Chinese and Indian farmers and African and Caribbean banana imports to the EU. India and China's hard stance regarding tariffs and subsidies was severely criticized by the United States. In response, India's Commerce Minister said \"I'm not risking the livelihood of millions of farmers.\"\n\nThe negotiations collapsed on 29 July over issues of agricultural trade between the United States, India, and China. In particular, there was insoluble disagreement between India and the United States over the special safeguard mechanism (SSM), a measure designed to protect poor farmers by allowing countries to impose a special tariff on certain agricultural goods in the event of an import surge or price fall.\n\nPascal Lamy said, \"Members have simply not been able to bridge their differences.\" He also said that out of a to-do list of 20 topics, 18 had seen positions converge but the gaps could not narrow on the 19th—the special safeguard mechanism for developing countries. However, the United States, China and India could not agree on the threshold that would allow the mechanism to be used, with the United States arguing that the threshold had been set too low.\nThe European Union Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson characterized the collapse as a \"collective failure\". On a more optimistic note, India's Commerce Minister, Kamal Nath, said \"I would only urge the director-general to treat this [failure of talks] as a pause, not a breakdown, to keep on the table what is there.\"\n\nSeveral countries blamed each other for the breakdown of the negotiations. The United States and some European Union members blamed India for the failure of the talks. India claimed that its position (i.e. that the US was sacrificing the world's poor for US/European commercial interests) was supported by over 100 countries. Brazil, one of the founding members of the G-20, broke away from the position held by India. Then-European Commissioner for Trade Peter Mandelson said that India and China should not be blamed for the failure of the Doha round. In his view, the agriculture talks had been harmed by the five-year program of agricultural subsidies recently passed by the U.S. Congress, which he said was \"one of the most reactionary farm bills in the history of the U.S.\".\n\nOn 19 December 2015, a WTO meeting in the Kenyan Capital led to an agreement for developed countries to end export subsidies immediately and developing countries to follow by the end of 2018.\n\nIn 2008, several countries called for negotiations to start again. Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, former president of Brazil, called several countries leaders to urge them to renew negotiations. The director-general and chair of the Trade Negotiations Committee Pascal Lamy visited India to discuss possible solutions to the impasse. A mini-ministerial meeting held in India on 3 and 4 September 2008 pledged to complete the round by the end of 2010. The declaration at the end of the G20 summit of world leaders in London in 2009 included a pledge to complete the Doha round. Although a WTO ministerial conference scheduled in November 2009 would not be a negotiating session, there would be several opportunities in 2009 to discuss the progress. The WTO is involved in several events every year that provide opportunities to discuss and advance trade negotiations at a conceptual level.\n\nIn early 2010, Brazil and Lamy focused on the role of the United States in overcoming the deadlock. President Lula urged Barack Obama to end a trade dispute between Brazil and the US over cotton subsidies after the WTO gave Brazil the formal go-ahead in 2009 to impose sanctions on imports of over 100 US goods. Lamy highlighted the difficulty of obtaining agreement from the US without the presidential fast-track authority and biennial elections. One of the consequences of the economic crisis of 2008–2009 is the desire of political leaders to shelter their constituents from the increasingly competitive market experienced during market contractions. Lamy hoped that the drop in trade of 12% in 2009, quoted as the largest annual drop since the Second World War, could be countered by successful conclusion of the Doha round.\n\nAt the 2011 annual conference of the World Economic Forum in Davos, British prime minister David Cameron called for the Doha talks to conclude by the end of the year, saying that \"We've been at this Doha round for far too long. It's frankly ridiculous that it has taken 10 years to do this deal.\" Peter Sutherland, a former WTO director-general, called for the talks to be concluded in December that year. That hope having failed to eventuate, Pascal Lamy \"reported to the General Council on 1 May 2012 that on the Doha Round, 'my conversations over the past few weeks with ministers and delegations have provided me with a sense that members wish to continue to explore any opportunities to gain the necessary traction and make tangible progress soon'.\"\n\nIn December 2013, under new director-general Roberto Azevêdo, negotiations of the Ninth Ministerial Conference held in Nusa Dua, Bali, Indonesia produced agreement on a \"Bali Package\", addressing a small portion of the Doha programme, principally bureaucratic \"red tape\". Because of the controversial nature of reforming laws on intellectual property, trade in services and subsidising crops for Food Security, the talks focused on trade facilitation, which means lowering cross-border tariffs and other regulations which impede international trade. However, there was still some controversy over this, with Cuba threatening to oppose any deal which did not affect the US embargo on Cuba. The trade facilitation measures agreed in Bali could cut the cost of shipping goods around the world by more than 10%, by one estimate, raising global output by over $400 billion a year, with benefits flowing disproportionately to poorer countries. It was claimed that the Bali Package, if implemented in full, could boost the global economy by US$1 trillion and create 21 million new jobs.\nThe Bali agreement included a 12-month deadline for the development of \"a clearly defined work programme\" on the remaining issues. The alternative to the WTO was seen as a proliferation of bilateral and regional agreements and, in the case of agriculture, the increased use of private standards.\n\nAgriculture has become the lynchpin of the agenda for both developing and developed countries.\nThree other issues have been important. The first, now resolved, pertained to compulsory licensing of medicines and patent protection. A second deals with a review of provisions giving special and differential treatment to developing countries; a third addresses problems that developing countries are having in implementing current trade obligations.\n\nAgriculture has become the most important and controversial issue. Agriculture is particularly important for developing countries, because around 75% of the population in developing countries live in rural areas, and the vast majority are dependent on agriculture for their livelihoods. The first proposal in Qatar, in 2001, called for the end agreement to commit to \"substantial improvements in market access; reductions of, with a view to phasing out, all forms of export subsidies; and substantial reductions in trade-distorting domestic support.\"\n\nThe United States is being asked by the Indians (EU) and the developing countries, led by Brazil and India, to make a more generous offer for reducing trade-distorting domestic support for agriculture. The United States is insisting that the EU and the developing countries agree to make more substantial reductions in tariffs and to limit the number of import-sensitive and special products that would be exempt from cuts. Import-sensitive products are of most concern to developed countries like the European Union, while developing countries are concerned with special products – those exempt from both tariff cuts and subsidy reductions because of development, food security, or livelihood considerations. Brazil has emphasized reductions in trade-distorting domestic subsidies, especially by the United States (some of which it successfully challenged in the WTO U.S.-Brazil cotton dispute), while India has insisted on a large number of special products that would not be exposed to wider market opening.\n\nA major topic at the Doha ministerial regarded the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). The issue involves the balance of interests between the pharmaceutical companies in developed countries that held patents on medicines and the public health needs in developing countries. Another issue concerns the protection of traditional medicinal knowledge and practices. Before the Doha meeting, the United States claimed that the current language in TRIPS was flexible enough to address public health emergencies, but other countries insisted on new language.\n\nOn 30 August 2003, WTO members reached agreement on the TRIPS and medicines issue. Voting in the General Council, member governments approved a decision that offered an interim waiver under the TRIPS Agreement allowing a member country to export pharmaceutical products made under compulsory licenses to least-developed and certain other members.\n\nIn the Doha Ministerial Declaration, the trade ministers reaffirmed special and differential (S&D) treatment for developing countries and agreed that all S&D treatment provisions \"...be reviewed with a view to strengthening them and making them more precise, effective and operational.\"\n\nThe negotiations have been split along a developing-country/developed-country divide. Developing countries wanted to negotiate on changes to S&D provisions, keep proposals together in the Committee on Trade and Development, and set shorter deadlines. Developed countries wanted to study S&D provisions, send some proposals to negotiating groups, and leave deadlines open. Developing countries claimed that the developed countries were not negotiating in good faith, while developed countries argued that the developing countries were unreasonable in their proposals. At the December 2005 Hong Kong ministerial, members agreed to five S&D provisions for least developed countries (LDCs), including the duty-free and quota-free access.\n\nResearch by the ODI sheds light on the priorities of the LDCs during the Doha round. It is argued that subsidies to agriculture, especially to cotton, unite developing countries in opposition more than SDT provisions and therefore have a greater consensus.\n\nDuty-free and quota-free access (DFQFA) currently discussed covers 97% of tariff lines and if the US alone were to implement the initiative, it would potentially increase Least Developed Countries' (LDCs) exports by 10% (or $1bn). Many major trading powers already provide preferential access to LDCs through initiatives such as the Everything but Arms (EBA) initiative and the African Growth and Opportunity Act.\n\nDeveloping countries claim that they have had problems with the implementation of the agreements reached in the earlier Uruguay Round because of limited capacity or lack of technical assistance. They also claim that they have not realized certain benefits that they expected from the Round, such as increased access for their textiles and apparel in developed-country markets. They seek a clarification of language relating to their interests in existing agreements.\n\nBefore the Doha ministerial, WTO members resolved a small number of these implementation issues. At the Doha meeting, the Ministerial Declaration directed a two-path approach for the large number of remaining issues: (a) where a specific negotiating mandate is provided, the relevant implementation issues will be addressed under that mandate; and (b) the other outstanding implementation issues will be addressed as a matter of priority by the relevant WTO bodies. Outstanding implementation issues are found in the area of market access, investment measures, safeguards, rules of origin, and subsidies and countervailing measures, among others.\n\nMost countries participating in the negotiations believe that there is some economic benefit in adopting the agreement; however, there is considerable disagreement of how much benefit the agreement would actually produce. A study by the University of Michigan found that if all trade barriers in agriculture, services, and manufactures were reduced by 33% as a result of the Doha Development Agenda, there would be an increase in global welfare of $574.0 billion. A 2008 study by World Bank Lead Economist Kym Anderson found that global income could increase by more than $3000 billion per year, $2500 billion of which would go to the developing world. Others had been predicting more modest outcomes, e.g. world net welfare gains ranging from $84 billion to $287 billion by the year 2015. Pascal Lamy has conservatively estimated that the deal will bring an increase of $130 billion.\n\nSeveral think tanks and public organizations assess that the conclusion of the trade round will result in a net gain. However, the restructuring and adjustment costs required to prevent the collapse of local industries, particularly in developing countries, is a global concern. For example, a late 2009 study by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), the United Nations Development Programme and the Kenyan Institute for Research and Policy Analysis found that Kenya would see gains in its exports of flowers, tea, coffee and oil seeds. It would concurrently lose in the tobacco and grains markets, as well as manufacturing of textiles and footwear, machinery and equipment.\n\nThe Copenhagen Consensus, which evaluates solutions for global problems regarding the cost-benefit ratio, in 2008 ranked the DDA as the second-best investment for global welfare, after the provision of vitamin supplements to the world's 140 million malnourished children.\n\n\n"}

The first team to bear the name Baltimore Colts, they were members of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) from 1947 to 1949 and then joined the National Football League (NFL) for one season before folding. They were one of the least successful teams in the AAFC and NFL both on and off the field, winning only 11 games in their history. In 1953, Baltimore was granted an expansion team that revived the Colts name; since , this team is now the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nThe Colts' origin is with the Miami Seahawks, one of the charter franchises of the AAFC. After playing a single disastrous season the Seahawks were confiscated by the league, and were purchased and reorganized by a group of businessmen as the Baltimore Colts. The new team struggled through the next three seasons, but managed to grow a sizable fan base in Baltimore. In 1949, the Colts were one of three AAFC teams, along with the San Francisco 49ers and the Cleveland Browns, to be brought into the NFL following the AAFC-NFL merger. They played only during the 1950 season before financial pressures forced them to fold.\n\nThe All-America Football Conference had initially intended to place a team in Baltimore in its opening 1946 season, but its prospective owner, retired boxer Gene Tunney, was unable to secure a stadium deal. Needing an eighth team to balance the schedule, AAFC officials granted a franchise to a group of Miami-based boosters, and the Miami Seahawks were born. \n\nFrom the first, the Seahawks were beset with problems. They were a weak team with a difficult schedule in the smallest market in the league. They drew little fan support and accumulated debts of up to $350,000, which owner Harvey Hester could not afford to repay. League commissioner Jim Crowley expropriated the franchise, and the AAFC covered its overdue travel and payroll costs.\n\nFive businessmen, led by Washington, D.C. attorney Robert D. Rodenburg, made a bid to purchase the Seahawks' assets and use them to start a new team in Baltimore. The AAFC quickly approved the deal, and the team was reorganized as the Baltimore Colts, a name chosen due to the city's long history of horse racing and breeding. Due to the club's inherited talent drought, the Colts were permitted to recruit a player from each of the AAFC's four strongest teams. Nevertheless, the Colts struggled financially through the 1947 season, leading the owners to walk away after the season. The team was little better on the field, winning only two games to finish in the Eastern Division basement. Sensing a crisis, the AAFC supplied its three weakest teams—the Colts, the Chicago Rockets and the Brooklyn Dodgers—with superior players. The team found new ownership, but its financial crisis was not resolved. Even with stronger players, the Colts were barely competitive on the field in 1948. However, the Eastern Division was extremely weak that year; none of its four teams tallied a winning record. The Colts tied for first with the Buffalo Bills with a 7–7 record, and lost the division championship game to the Bills. The team regressed in 1949, finishing dead last with a 1-11 record.\n\nIn 1948, both the AAFC and the NFL were struggling, and determined that the continued viability of professional football depended on a merger between the leagues. The leagues began negotiating a deal in which three AAFC teams would be brought into the NFL and the owners of others would be compensated for their interest. The Cleveland Browns and San Francisco 49ers, clearly the AAFC's strongest teams, were obvious choices. It initially appeared that the Bills would be the third team in the merger. However, the Colts' owners pressed to be included in the Bills' place, even though they were one of the weakest teams in the league. George Preston Marshall, owner of the Washington Redskins, initially refused to cooperate. He considered Baltimore to be part of his home territory, and believed the Colts would infringe on his rights. Marshall finally relented in exchange for the Colts paying him $150,000 for the infringement. With this obstacle overcome, the merger was finalized, and the Colts were brought into the NFL.\n\nThe Bills were arguably a better choice for entry into the NFL; they were in a more isolated market, had stronger attendance and performed better on the field. The newly merged league's owners scheduled a second vote to add the Bills in order to balance the schedule. However, in those days, adding a new team required a unanimous vote, and the Chicago Bears's George Halas and the Los Angeles Rams' Dan Reeves persuaded two other clubs to vote with them in blocking the merger. (The Bills were not the same as the modern Buffalo Bills franchise, which joined the NFL in 1970.) \n\nThe Colts were nominally part of the \"National Conference\" along with the other eastern teams in the merged league, but unlike the other twelve teams, Baltimore was scheduled as a \"swing team\" and played every team in the NFL over the course of the 1950 season. (The other twelve teams played a double round robin schedule in their conference plus one crossover game with the opposing conference and a game with Baltimore).\n\nDespite the addition of the Bills players, the Colts struggled through the 1950 season, ending with a record of 1–11–0. Facing a financial crisis, Colts owner Abraham Watner sold the team and its player contracts back to the NFL for $50,000, and the team officially folded. Still, however, fan support continued in many quarters; notably, the team's marching band and fan club remained intact after the team folded. Three years later another franchise, also named the Baltimore Colts, came to Baltimore. This team relocated to Indianapolis in 1984, and was renamed the Indianapolis Colts. The supporting groups, including the fan club and marching band remained, however, again working to revive a team in Baltimore. In 1996, the Baltimore Ravens were formed from the players and staff of the Cleveland Browns. The marching band (now known as Baltimore's Marching Ravens) and fan club became affiliated with the Ravens. The Baltimore Colts name was briefly revived in 1994 when the Canadian Football League created a Baltimore-based expansion team of that name; however, following a lawsuit from the NFL the name was changed to the Baltimore Stallions.\n\n!Totals || 11 || 40 || 1\n"}

Burleson was held at gunpoint against a wall by one of the terrorists, and told not to move or look at the hostages as they came through the parking lot. He is the last athlete who had any contact with the Israeli Olympians 45 minutes before they died.\n\nBurleson was also a member of the 1972 U.S. Olympic Basketball Team that lost a controversial gold medal game to the Soviet Union. The entire 1972 Olympic Basketball team believed they had been cheated and voted unanimously to not accept the silver.\n\nBefore the 1974 NBA draft, it appeared almost certain that Burleson would be taken by the Phoenix Suns. But because Seattle traded Dick Snyder to the Cleveland Cavaliers at the last minute, the Sonics gained the right to pick before the Suns, so the two teams vied for a contract with Burleson. After considering both offers, Burleson chose Seattle.\n\nDrafted by the Seattle SuperSonics as the third overall player in the 1974 NBA Draft, Burleson entered the league tied with Artis Gilmore and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as the tallest active NBA player at 7 feet 2 inches. Named to the 1974–75 NBA All-Rookie Team. Playing under coach Bill Russell, Burleson recorded strong playoff performances in both 1975 and 1976 for Seattle. For his playoff career, Burleson averaged 20.7 points, 10.2 rebounds, and 1.7 blocks per game in 15 career playoff games. His second season as a professional proved to be his best, as he averaged 15.6 points, 9.0 rebounds, and 1.8 blocks per game. Just as he began to come into his own in the NBA, he was injured breaking up a fight between his teammate and an opposing team member. The injury was instrumental in his steady decline over the next several years.\n\nBurleson was known throughout his amateur and pro career as a good shot blocker. He played seven seasons in the NBA with Seattle, the Kansas City Kings and the Atlanta Hawks.\n\nHe lives in Avery County, North Carolina with his wife Denise.

Major clients included:\n\nHawker Siddeley Canada headquarters was in Mississauga, Ontario. Its formation in 1962 saw the company acquire control of several A.V.

Consequently, Hawker Siddeley had two primary railcar manufacturing plants:\n\nHawker Siddeley forced its DOSCO subsidiary to close money-losing coal mines and steel mills, subsequently expropriated by the federal and Nova Scotia governments (see: Cape Breton Development Corporation and Sydney Steel Corporation).

Burroughs’ talent for utterly weird but comprehensible description, and the hardboiled stylings of Raymond Chandler or Elmore Leonard.\"\n\n\"Only an Alligator\" (2001), \"The Velocity Gospel\" (2002), \"Dummyland\" (2002), and \"Karloff's Circus\" (2004) are set in Accomplice, a suburb on a tropical peninsula in a perhaps nuclear-blasted future, underneath which live demons; Aylett says he is in the tradition of \"real satirists\" such as Voltaire, Jonathan Swift and Mark Twain. The four books are collected in \"The Complete Accomplice\" (2010).\n\n\"Lint\" (2005) is a satirical, Zelig-like biography of an imaginary author. The book traces Jeff Lint's career through thinly disguised satires on a number of well-known writers from the late 20th century, including Philip K. Dick, Hunter S. Thompson and Ken Kesey. As Paul Di Filippo remarks, Jeff Lint's work is sometimes not dissimilar to Aylett's. Jeff Lint is also a transmedial creation, incorporating a comic, \"The Caterer\" #3 (2008), purportedly written by Jeff Lint; a spoof Wikipedia page; a spoof collection of academic essays on Lint's work, \"And Your Point Is?\" (2014); and a mockumentary \"Lint: The Movie\" (2011), which features reminisces by \"[Alan] Moore, Stewart Lee, Robin Ince, Mikey Georgeson, Josie Long, D. Harlan Wilson, Bill [Ectric], and many others on Lint’s outrageous and irritating career.\"\n\nAylett has also written for comics, most notably the Jeff Lint title \"The Caterer\" (2008). Other projects include #27 of \"Tom Strong\" (2004), \"The Promissory\" for \"Arthur\" magazine’s \"mimeo\" line (2007), \"Get That Thing Away From Me\" (2014), and \"Johnny Viable\", which appeared in Alan Moore's print magazine \"Dodgem Logic\" and was collected and expanded as the standalone \"Johnny Viable & His Terse Friends\" (2014).\n\n\"Slaughtermatic\" was shortlisted for the 1998 Philip K. Dick Award.\nAylett was the recipient of the 2006 Jack Trevor Story Award.\n\nAylett left school at the age of seventeen and worked in a book warehouse, and later in law publishing. A synesthete, Aylett claims to have books appear in his brain in one visual \"glob\" which looks like a piece of gum.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

As of the 2006 census, its population was 67,078, in 14,681 families.\n\nBandar Imam Khomeini is a port city on the Persian Gulf in Khūzestān Province, Iran. Before the 1979 Iranian Revolution, it was known as Bandar Shahpur. It is named after Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.\n\nThe city is home to Petrochimi Bandar Imam basketball club, which plays in the Iranian Super League.\n\nThe port is located at the terminus of the Trans-Iranian Railway linking the Persian Gulf with Tehran and on to the Caspian Sea. Its is part of same nautical complex as the port of the adjacent city of Bandar-e Mahshahr. Both ports are accessible through the same channel.\n\nDuring World War II it consisted only of a jetty, two shipping berths, a railhead and warehouses and a civilian settlement some miles distant. The port was initially in German and Italian hands, but was stormed on August 25, 1941 by a combined British and Indian force supported by the Royal Navy.\nA flotilla led by the armed merchant cruiser HMS Kanimbla had sailed up the waterways and in the raid captured eight Axis vessels, two gunboats and the floating dock. It was at time that, among others, the German ship \"Hohenfels\" fell into British hands and became \"Empire Kamal\".\n\nThereafter it was administered by the US Army 482nd Port Battalion and served as a critical supply point for Allied military aid for Russia. The port facilities were also used for merchant and military vessel layup and repair. Three additional berths were built during the war.\n\nThe port of Bandar-e Emam Khomeyni is an Iranian National port operating under the authority of the Iranian Ports & Maritime Organization.it is the Iranian Northernmost port on the Persian Gulf .The Bandar Imam port is a transshipment point for containers, bulk and general cargo, with exclusive access to the facilities held by Iran Shipping Lines (IRISL). In 2005 the Iranian Government proposed direct container shipments between the port and western Europe, but negotiations with shipping lines for dedicated port facilities and access have not concluded.\n\nA dozen kilometers East of Bandar Khomeyni port is the port of Bandar-e Mahshahr which is specialized in exporting oil and petrochemical products produced by the national companies NIOC and NPC. Both ports are accessible through the same 'Khor Musa' channel, which is 42 miles long and about 20 meters deep.\n\nBandar-e Emam Khomeyni port is connected by rail and road, to the West with Abadan and Khorramshahr and their joint Arvand Free Zone , along the Iran - Iraq border line, and to the North to Ahvaz, Teheran and the Caspian Sea and the Caucasus countries.\n\nThe Port has seven terminals with 40 berths of about 6,500 metres frontage.\n\nThe terminals are supported by warehouses with a capacity of 171,000 m² and open storage areas covering 10.9 km².\n\n\n"}

He worked as a journalist while studying law at the University of La Plata, and joined Chacho Álvarez and other center-left Peronists supporting Antonio Cafiero in the APU. Alak taught Public Law at the university and established a private practice. He married Marita Scarpino and had three children. Alak joined the Justicialist Party in 1984.\n\nAlak became the President of the La Plata branch of the party in 1988, and was nominated its mayoral candidate in 1991. He won the election, narrowly defeating the incumbent UCR mayor, and held the post until the 2007 election.\n\nIn the 1990s, Alak pushed through the construction of a new stadium for La Plata, over the objections of the two major football clubs, which chose to remain in their home fields.\n\nConcurrently, Alak sponsored a minor club, \"La Plata FC\", which some claimed was part of an Alak patronage scheme. Significant sums were allegedly spent from the city budget for activities related to that club, which has virtually no following. For some time, it was thought that it would be the only side to play in the new stadium, which was used mainly for concerts.\n\nWhen a security regulation forbidding wooden stands came into effect in 2005, Estudiantes de La Plata relocated their home games to the \"Bosque\" (the field of rival side Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata), and later to the Quilmes stadium. The municipality has refused to allow Estudiantes an upgrade of their field, and ignored a court order that allowed its operation until a better solution was found. This behavior triggered animosity in the Estudiantes fan base.\n\nIn 2006, Gimnasia's stadium was banned as well, and their management transferred their games to the new stadium, over fans' objections. In April 2006, Alak intervened against a judicial order that would have allowed the re-opening of both fields. In August 2006, an agreement has been reached to allow remodeling Estudiantes' field, using newer technologies, to allow for a 20,000 sitting room capacity.\n\nCritics argue that while millions went into the construction of the stadium, which the city did not need, thousands of poor people live in its shadows without receiving proper municipal services.\n\nWhen Estudiantes obtained the 2006 \"Apertura\" title, Alak invited the team to an official ceremony but the players declined to attend, claiming that the pressure from the crowd would not allow them to reach his office; actually, the players were at the Cathedral, 200 m (650 ft) from City Hall, and so the refusal to attend was perceived as a rebuke of Alak.\n\nPrior to the 2007 provincial election, Alak signed Estudiantes legend Juan Ramón Verón to a post as children sports services coordinator. Estudiantes fans puzzled over the designation, which is perceived as cementing Alak's alignment with candidate Daniel Scioli and an attempt to heal the rift between Estudiantes and Alak's administration.\n\nLa Plata FC was dissolved only three months after Alak left office.\n\nInitial results of the October 28, 2007, election indicated that Alak finished behind opposition candidate Pablo Bruera who took 25% to Alak's 20%. Sensing defeat, Alak's campaign operators attempted to suggest a link between Bruera and the killing of three policemen in La Plata, which took place nine days before the election; all investigations were inconclusive as of voting day, however (three suspects were detained and subsequently released).\n\nAlak was named to the Board of Directors of Aerolíneas Argentinas, on February 14, 2008, as the Argentine Government's representative on the air carrier's board, and served as its CEO following the air carrier's July 2008 nationalization.\n\nFollowing the ruling Front for Victory's defeat in the 2009 mid-term elections, Alak was tapped to replace Attorney General Aníbal Fernández, who had been appointed the President's Cabinet Chief, effective July 8.\n\nJustice Minister Alak spearheaded more vigorous laws against terrorism, money laundering, and market manipulation during his tenure, as well as stepped up prosecutions of Dirty War perpetrators.\n"}

Filbert company, based in Baltimore, Maryland, developed the product in 1979 as a low-cost alternative to butter for the food service industry. The name originated from a comment by the husband of a company secretary as he sampled the product and it was first marketed to retail consumers in 1981. The company was acquired by Unilever in 1986, which then expanded sales of the product, previously only available primarily in the Washington, DC/Baltimore area, throughout the entire United States in 1988 and later to the United Kingdom, Canada and Mexico in 1991. The product was put on the market in Germany in 2011 and in Chile in 2012.\n\nIn addition to a regular and 'light' spread, Unilever also uses the brand name to market a liquid butter substitute contained in a spray-bottle. This product is an emulsion of vegetable oil in water formulated with a 'hint' of butter flavor (derived from buttermilk) and is marketed as having zero calories and zero fat content. In 2017, Unilever announced two new varieties, \"It's Vegan\" and \"It's Organic\".\n\nIt was reported in July 2005 (per research from the market research company Information Resources) that the product at that time led in product sales for its category of margarines, butter blends and spreads, with sales revenue standing at $244.7 million USD, summarized from 52 weeks up to July 10, 2005.\n\nBut by 2012, the situation had changed. It was reported in 2012 by Euromonitor International that while sales of butter and spreadable oil fell, margarine sales increased by 1.1 percent, but sales of I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter fell by 3.9 percent. 7 percent of sales at Unilever consists of spreads, with a significant amount consisting of butter substitutes, the sales of which are on the decline.\n\nIn 2016, there were $248.4 million in sales of I Can't Believe It's Not Butter and $47.7 million of I Can't Believe It's Not Butter Light.\n\nIn February 2017, Unilever rebranded the product as \"I Can't Believe It's So Good... For Everything!\" in the UK. The stated objective was to increase awareness of the product's versatility. The rebrand was greeted with puzzlement and some derision by many media commentators. Subsequently, the branding was simplified to \"I Can't Believe It's So Good...\". The original brand name made its relaunch on 28 Nov 2019. \n\n\n\n"}

Edmisten\n\nRufus Lige Edmisten (born July 12, 1941) is an American attorney who served as North Carolina Secretary of State, Attorney General, and was the Democratic nominee for Governor in 1984. He is currently a lawyer in private practice.\n\nRufus L. Edmisten was born and raised in Boone, North Carolina. He earned an undergraduate degree in political science with honors at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and a J.D. from the George Washington University Law Center in Washington, D.C., where he served on the Law Review. During law school, he joined the Capitol Hill staff of North Carolina Senator Sam Ervin, where he served as the Counsel to Senator Ervin's Judiciary Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights and as Chief Counsel and Staff Director of the Subcommittee on Separation of Powers. In 1973-1974, Edmisten was the Deputy Chief Counsel for the Senate Watergate Committee, which Ervin chaired. With Terry Lenzner, an assistant counsel on the Senate Watergate Committee, Edmisten served the subpoena to the White House for the Watergate tapes. It was the first time in history that a Congressional Committee served a subpoena on a sitting president. During his time working for Senator Ervin, Edmisten participated in important legislative initiatives, such as securing constitutional rights for American Indians and providing constitutional protections for military personnel. \nFollowing Senator Ervin's retirement in 1974, Edmisten returned to North Carolina. He was elected state attorney general in 1974 and served in that post for ten years. While attorney general, Edmisten engaged in a successful effort to prevent the damming of the scenic New River. He launched a variety of legislative efforts, such as securing victim's rights, enhancing the state's historic preservation laws, and setting new educational standards for the state's law enforcement personnel. Edmisten was the Democratic nominee for governor in 1984, losing to Republican James G. Martin, a loss attributed to Martin's endorsements by Edmisten's Democratic primary rivals.\n\nAfter his unsuccessful gubernatorial campaign, Edmisten practiced law with Reagan H. Weaver for four years. In the 1988 and 1992 elections, Edmisten won the office of Secretary of State. As Secretary of State he broadened securities oversight in an effort to protect investors, and worked with the General Assembly to craft a law to establish Limited Liability Corporations in North Carolina.\n\nIn 1996 Edmisten resigned from office after an audit of the Secretary of State's office led to a State Bureau of Investigations inquiry into several alleged abuses of office. The investigation, which involved more than 100 interviews and culminated in a 3000-page report, exonerated Edmisten and his staff from all the accusations. Edmisten maintained that his resignation had nothing to do with the investigation. After his resignation in 1996 Edmisten launched a legal practice that merged with that of former NC Department of Justice colleague and Deputy US attorney, Woody Webb, in 1998.\n\nEdmisten has filled key roles in several private organizations outside of his legal practice. He runs a charity in North Carolina called the Foundation for Good Business: Extra Special Super Kids. The Super Kids program provides college scholarships to underprivileged high school students who wish to pursue higher learning. Rufus has served on the N.C. Capitol Foundation for over 25 years, including a six-year stint (2000–2006) as president of the foundation. He is a member of the boards of directors of the Julia Crump Foundation and Project Enlightenment, both of which are charitable organizations that seek to enhance educational opportunities for disadvantaged youths. Rufus also served as a board member for the Raleigh region of Union Bank. Thirty years ago, Rufus, famous Jim Valvano, and Don Shea founded the Jim Valvano Kids Klassic Golf Tournament, which has raised several million dollars to seek a cure for children suffering from cancer at Duke University Hospital.\n\nRufus and his wife, Linda, live in a designated 1921 National Register and Raleigh Historic Landmark house.\n\nHe is a panelist on NC Spin, North Carolina's longest running political talk show, and he is a frequent guest on the Weekend Gardener, a 40-year-old popular garden show on WPTF Radio.

{"id": "1845497", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1845497", "title": "BitTorrent (software)", "text": "BitTorrent (software)\n\nBitTorrent is an ad-supported BitTorrent client developed by Bram Cohen and BitTorrent, Inc. used for uploading and downloading files via the BitTorrent protocol. BitTorrent was the first client written for the protocol. It is often nicknamed Mainline by developers denoting its official origins. Since version 6.0 the BitTorrent client has been a rebranded version of μTorrent. As a result, it is no longer open source. It is currently available for Microsoft Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS and Android.\n\nProgrammer Bram Cohen designed the protocol in April 2001 and released a first implementation of the BitTorrent client on 2 July 2001. It is now maintained by Cohen's company BitTorrent, Inc.\n\nPrior to version 6.0, BitTorrent was written in Python, and was free software. Very early versions released prior to December 30, 2001 were released into the public domain without a license. Versions up to and including 3.4.2 were distributed under the MIT license. The source code for versions 4.x and 5.x was released under the BitTorrent Open Source License, a modified version of the Jabber Open Source License. Versions 4.0 and 5.3 were relicensed under the GPL.\n\nVersion 4.20 of the client was dubbed \"Allegro\" by BitTorrent Inc., in reference to protocol extensions developed by the company to accelerate download performance and ISP manageability.\n\nVersion 5.30 of the client which is snapshotted at Internet Archive is the latest open source version.\n\nSince version 6.0, the BitTorrent client has been a rebranded version of μTorrent. It is no longer open source.\n\nThe BitTorrent client enables a user to search for and download torrent files using a built-in search box (\"Search for torrents\") in the main window, which opens the BitTorrent torrent search engine page with the search results in the user's default web browser.\n\nThe current client includes a range of features, including multiple parallel downloads. BitTorrent has several statistical, tabular and graphical views that allow a user to see what events are happening in the background. A host of views offer information on the peers and seeds to which the user is connected, including how much data is being downloaded from each and to how much data is being uploaded by each. It has an automatic recovery system that checks all data that has been handled after an improper shutdown. It also intermediates peering between itself, source file servers (\"trackers\") and other clients, thereby yielding distribution efficiencies. The client also enables users to create and share torrent files.\n\nBitTorrent DNA (\"BitTorrent Delivery Network Accelerator\") is a program designed to speed up the viewing of streaming video, downloading software (with or without the BitTorrent protocol) and playing online video games. It does so by distributing the end users' downloads between each other. In this way, the developers intend that content providers should take less load on their servers so the end users can receive the content faster. It runs in the background whenever the operating system is running.\n\nBitTorrent DNA is different from traditional BitTorrent in that it relies on publisher HTTP servers in order to provide publishers with guaranteed minimum data delivery rate, as well as give publishers control over content delivery (peers must connect to the origin server before they can reach other peers), and collect information about content delivery to share with the publisher. The quality of the file transfer is specified in terms of a long-term average bitrate for data and in terms of meeting deadlines when streaming. It also can give bandwidth to TCP and other traffic.\n\nDNA is also different from traditional BitTorrent in that it is a UDP-based protocol that has replaced regular TCP-based bandwidth throttling with a much more sensitive bandwidth management technique.\n\nApart from being installed by third party websites and software companies, the program for end users is also installed when the official BitTorrent client is installed (starting with the rebranded version 6.0). However, it can be independently uninstalled.\n\nThe first version of the DNA made it possible to keep the DNA application installed and yet temporarily stopped until the next system restart (through the system's control panel, in Windows XP). The DNA GUI was completely removed in the official BitTorrent version 6.1 and 6.1.1, but was re-introduced in version 6.1.2.\n\nSince October, 2007 BitTorrent DNA has been offered by BitTorrent, Inc. as a commercial service that content providers can purchase (for an undisclosed price) and as a free background program for end users. Company President Ashwin Navin launched the product claiming that \"Implementing BitTorrent DNA on top of legacy infrastructure has the profound impact of allowing our customers to deliver a better user experience, higher quality video, faster software downloads, all with the security and reliability of a managed service.\"\n\nNavin in a podcast interview claimed that he attempted to sell BitTorrent DNA in January 2005. After finding that BitTorrent's brand was too polarizing for potential customers, they delayed the launch until after partnering with nearly 50 media companies in the BitTorrent Entertainment Network. That provided the company enough public validation to finally launch BitTorrent DNA two and half years later.\n\nThe service's first customer was the company Brightcove, that chose to use it to distribute streaming video files.\n\nAs of May 2009, the Asus support website is using BitTorrent DNA as an additional download method of their larger files in addition to their multiple somewhat internationally distributed HTTP servers and content delivery mirrors and other redirection facilities Asus has been known to rely in the present and past for their data delivery needs. Currently, a separate \"P2P\" icon is being presented for the DNA style downloads next to the \"Global\" and \"Chinese\" located servers as an example.\n\n\n"}

Here he met a young Jacques Villeneuve who had been sent to the school following the death of his Formula One driver father Gilles. \n\nAfter leaving school Villeneuve pursued a career as a racing driver, following in his father's footsteps. Villeneuve entered Formula 3 with Prema Racing in Italy and had relatively poor results. The two men were brought back together by a chance meeting at the Suzuka circuit. Villeneuve was invited by a Japanese Photographer and fan of his late father to attend an event during the GP weekend. Pollock was attending on Honda related business. The meeting at the circuit led to 3 meetings in Switzerland when Villeneuve was pursuing the possibility of Pollock managing his career. Pollock accepted after the last meeting. Pollock's first initiative was to negotiate with Toyota Team Tom's in Japan and move Villenuve to Tokyo where he could have the chance to work on his pure talent as a driver. (1992). During this year Pollock was contacted by Jean-Claude Torchia working for Imperial Tobacco in Montreal to see if Villeneuve would accept driving in the Formula Atlantic are at Trois Riviers in Quebec. This opened the door for Pollock to commence future negotiations for Villeneuve's future career in the States. A 3 year deal was signed. \n\nIn 1993 Villeneuve raced in American Formula Atlantic before breaking into IndyCars in 1994. After winning a Road America (Elkhart lake) in his rookie season Villeneuve won the Indy car championship and prestigious Indianapolis 500 win in 1995. Pollock used this winning streak to negotiate Villeneuve's entry into F1 with the Williams F1 team where he won the championship in his second year (1997).\n\nDuring Villeneuve's final year in Indy Car Pollock had been working in the background to set up a new Formula One Team when he had been told by Reynard (Adrian Reynard) if he could get the funding, the Engine supply partner and the driver, he could count on Reynard to help.\n\nImperial Tobacco was taken over by BAT (British American Tobacco) and the door was open for pollock ago use his contacts from the Indy Car success. Pollock convinced BAT to invest in the project using his old contacts then working for BAT in the UK.\n\nIn 1998 Pollock purchased Tyrrell with his partners at the same time he was building BAR (British American Racing) from a Greenfield site, Pollock signed his close friend and driver to be team leader. Immediately a controversial figure, Pollock made numerous claims about how successful his team would be. These claim's were in reality made during the huge announcement event by his partner and technical director of the team Adrian Reynard when he announced in front of all the journalists (in a London based event) that \"Reynard\" had always obtained \"pole position\" in their first race then \"won\" the Championship in their second season. BAR was last in the championship in their first year.\n\nPollock spent the time working with the team to improve and was successful in his endeavour to sign Honda to return to F1 with his team. He was successful and Honda returned with BAR to become BAR Honda in 2000. BAR Honda finished 5th in the Championship (4th equal in points with Benneton).\n\nPollock managed Villeneuve through the end of his Formula career.\n\nFurther to Pollock leaving BAR he was contacted by Kevin Kalkhoven to enter Formula One and carried out a due diligence of the bankrupt Arrows Team but decided against it. Kalkhoven suggested that they enter the CART series and Pollock negotiated the purchase of the assets of PacWest Cart team and entered the CART championship for the 2003 series. Pollock managed this only for one season and requested that Kalkhoven purchase his shares to manage this team himself. During this period Pollock introduced Kalkhoven to an ex business partner Gerald Forsythe. From this introduction both Kalkhoven and Forsythe bought the series and Cosworth.\n\nPollock and Villeneuve ended their business relationship in January 2008.\n\nIn May 2011, Pollock announced his creation of Propulsion Universelle et Recuperation d'Energie (PURE), an engineering company which was set up to design and supply Power Units to F1 as an independent supplier. Pollock became to sole investor in PURE SA and ran out of funds in 2014. PURE SA was liquidated the same year.\n\n</ref> In July 2012, technical director Gilles Simon announced his departure from PURE in a general email sent out to suppliers and colleagues due to the financial difficulties the company was having.

{"id": "1845545", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1845545", "title": "Shiloh (Naylor novel)", "text": "Shiloh (Naylor novel)\n\nShiloh is a Newbery Medal-winning children's novel by Phyllis Reynolds Naylor published in 1991. The 65th book by Naylor, it is the first in a quartet about a young boy and the title character, an abused dog. Naylor decided to write \"Shiloh\" after an emotionally taxing experience in West Virginia where she encountered an abused dog.\n\nNarrator and protagonist Marty Preston lives in the hills of Friendly, West Virginia. After finding an abused beagle owned by his brutal neighbor Judd Travers, Marty defies his society's standards of not meddling with each other's business. Marty resolves to steal and hide the dog, naming him Shiloh and fabricating a web of lies to keep his secret. After his theft is discovered, Marty discovers Judd shooting a deer out of season and blackmails him into selling Shiloh to him. Because he lacks the money to buy Shiloh, Marty resolutely works for Judd doing numerous chores.\n\nPrimarily a \"Bildungsroman\" and adventure novel, the novel depicts the emotional tribulations and maturing of an 11-year-old boy. Some themes of the novel are ethics, consequentialism, religion and morality, and animal–human relationships. Marty learns that morality is confounding and must choose between two unpalatable choices: rescuing the abused Shiloh through stealing and lying or allowing Judd to keep abusing Shiloh.\n\nReviewers generally gave positive reviews of the book and were impressed by the novel's suspense and vernacular language. In addition to the Newbery Medal, \"Shiloh\" has received several state awards voted upon by children, including the Sequoyah Children's Book Award, the Mark Twain Readers Award, and the William Allen White Children's Book Award. In 1996, the book was adapted into a movie of the same name. The novel spawned three sequels, \"Shiloh Season\", \"Saving Shiloh\", and \"A Shiloh Christmas\" published in 1996, 1997, and 2015, respectively. \"Shiloh\" is taught in many elementary school courses in the United States.\n\nBorn in 1933 in Anderson, Indiana, Phyllis Reynolds Naylor was raised in Indiana and Illinois in the 1930s during the Great Depression. During her childhood she was hardly given any toys. Instead, with her parents reading to her every night, books formed a major part of her early years—\"the happiest part\". Her parents read a variety of literature to her, including Bible stories, \"The Wind in the Willows\", and Mark Twain's novels, until she was 14. After she became a parent, she read to her children in the mornings because of their evening activities. At 16, Naylor wrote a short story for a church magazine, and in her early thirties she published her first book. She has published over 100 books. When she wrote and published \"Shiloh\", her 65th novel, she was living in Bethesda, Maryland with her husband Rex, a speech pathologist whom she married in May 1960. She has two adult sons and four grandchildren.\n\nNaylor writes books for children, teens, and adults. Writing sporadically, Naylor typically takes several years to finish a book. With about 10 notebooks next to her workspace, she writes down story ideas and character traits when she thinks of them. She considered \"Shiloh\" to be a deviation from the norm because she finished the first draft in just eight weeks.\n\nEdited by Jonathan Lanman, \"Shiloh\" was published by Atheneum Books on September 30, 1991. The novel has been translated into at least 10 languages: Chinese, Dutch, French, German, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, and Swedish.\n\nThe novel is set in the small town of Shiloh West Virginia, where an eleven-year-old boy named Marty Preston finds a stray beagle named Shiloh wandering in the hills near his house. Shiloh follows him home. The dog's name is a tribute to a neighborhood schoolhouse. Shiloh's real owner is Judd Travers, who owns several hunting dogs. Fearing for the dog's safety because Judd drinks and treats his hunting dogs poorly, Marty does not want to return Shiloh. His father insists that Shiloh be returned to his rightful owner and they take the dog home to Judd.\n\nShiloh returns to Marty who hides him from his family. Concealing Shiloh in the woods in a wire pen he builds, Marty smuggles some of his dinner to the dog each evening. After his mother discovers Marty feeding the dog, he persuades her not to reveal the secret. That night, Shiloh is attacked by a German Shepherd Dog while in his makeshift cage and his family discovers Marty has been lying and hiding the dog. After taking the dog to the town doctor, the family must return Shiloh to his rightful owner by Sunday.\n\nBefore doing so, Marty travels up to Travers' house to try to convince Travers to allow him to keep Shiloh. Judd does not see Marty approaching, and shoots a doe out of season, which would mean a stiff fine Judd cannot afford. Marty lets Judd know he knows, and attempts to blackmail him out of Shiloh. Judd and Marty eventually negotiate a deal in which Marty will earn Shiloh for 40 dollars, paid with 20 hours of working for Judd. At the end of the first week, Judd says that he will not keep his end of the deal because the evidence of the dead doe has with the passage of time disappeared. Second, the contract that Marty had him sign is worthless in the state of West Virginia without the signature of a witness. Despite Judd's pointed disapproval of his work, Marty continues to work for him. They begin discussing dogs and Judd's father who began physically abusing Judd when he was four years old. In the end, Judd warms to Marty, repents, and lets him keep Shiloh.\nIn a 1992 interview about \"Shiloh\", Naylor said: \"Like a patchwork quilt, a novel is made up of things that have happened to me and things I have heard or read about, all mixed up with imaginings.\" Naylor's characters are frequently based on herself and her two sons. She penned the novel following an excursion with her husband, Rex, to visit their friends, Frank and Trudy Madden, in West Virginia. Naylor and Rex were strolling along a river when they discovered a dog in the grass following them. Dejected and frightened, the dog was \"the saddest, most mistreated-looking beagle I'd ever seen\", Naylor later said. Because the dog frequently shuddered and slunk forward on her belly, Naylor suspected she had been abused. On a whim, Naylor whistled and the dog rushed forward, lapping Naylor's face. Tailing them until they reached the Maddens' house, the beagle remained under a tree, her paws cushioning her head during the drizzly afternoon. Naylor cried during her and her husband's trip home that night.\n\nRex asked her if she would have a \"nervous breakdown\" or if she would \"do something about it\". That \"something\" referred to writing a book, which she did. She believed that someone had abused the dog and was confronted by a series of questions: \n\nThe Maddens resided near Shiloh, West Virginia, where Naylor found the abused dog in 1989, so she decided to name the book's dog Shiloh. Because the Maddens' post office address is in Friendly, West Virginia, Naylor chose the town as her book's setting. Trudy and Frank Madden adopted the abused dog Naylor had seen. Trudy Madden said in a 1997 interview that Naylor's description of Shiloh, West Virginia, was precise. By following the directions in \"Shiloh\" and its sequels, the town's houses, mill, and schoolhouse could be located easily.\n\n\"Shiloh\" is told in the first person in main character Marty Preston's voice. The prose has perceptible grammatical errors and a bucolic tone. Arlene Perly Rae of \"Toronto Star\" wrote that the novel is written in the \"uncomplicated style\" for which Naylor is distinguished. Jane Langton of \"The New York Times Book Review\" stated that the novel was written in a \"comfortable, down-home style\". Writing that the main story in \"Shiloh\" is Marty's struggle in his mind with morality, Langston noted that it is \"presented simply, in a way any third- or fourth-grade reader can understand\". Scholar Kathie Cerra praised the novel for its \"vivid sensory detail\", which enables readers to experience Marty's \"inner life of thought and feeling\". In Marty's \"teem[ing] with life\" first-person narrative, he shows how he feels when he tells lies to his parents and when he embraces the wriggling Shiloh.\n\nAcademic Leona W. Fisher wrote in \"Children's Literature Association Quarterly\" that the novel employs a seldom used yet ingenious literary technique: the story is told with \"the sustained internal monologue presented almost exclusively in the present tense\". The mores of his society and the actions of adults are strained through Marty's mind concurrently with his emotional agony and ethical judgments. The dialogue of the other characters tempers but does not counteract the \"exclusivity of his linguistic point of view\" because Marty is the sole narrator. \"Shiloh\" has a \"compacted time-frame, bounded by the past-tense opening and closing\". Fisher noted that because the novel's events are confined to several weeks in the summer, there is no need for a \"panoramic sweep\" of the actions. The reader can concentrate solely on Marty's ethical crisis. Conveying the mood of the novel is also mostly confined to Marty's thoughts and current action. Naylor uses the past-perfect verb \"had\" on several occasions to depict the tones of the scenes. This usage conveys turning-points in the story, transferring the reader from the \"immediate tension\" of the present to a growing cognizance.\n\nScholars Alethea Helbig and Agnes Perkins wrote that the \"Appalachian setting is well evoked, in both its beauty and its code of ethics that Marty must defy to save the dog\". Reviewer Ellen Mandel of \"Booklist\" wrote that the \"West Virginia dialect richly seasons the true-to-life dialogue\". Kenneth E. Kowen of \"School Library Journal\" perceived an incongruity in Naylor's depiction of Marty's family. He noted that Marty's father is a postman, one of the best paid jobs in suburban settings. In the novel, however, the family is poverty-stricken.\n\nReviewer Cecilia Goodnow noted that \"Shiloh\" is a \"Bildungsroman\" and adventure novel. Marty undergoes a physical and emotional transformation in his quest to save Shiloh. After confronting an abusive adult, he mentally grows, concluding: \"I saved Shiloh and opened my eyes some. Now that ain't bad for eleven.\" Salem Press's Carol Ann Gearhart has characterized the novel as domestic realism.\n\nPhysically abused as a child, Judd wants to keep Shiloh because he does not comprehend why people are so interested in rescuing the abused dog. No one cared to rescue Judd when he was harmed throughout his youth. Despite Judd's growing into a harsh man, reviewer Hary Sheehan noted, he preserves a glimmer of empathy. Journalist Kate Cavanaugh wrote that Judds' inability to love and cherish Shiloh is borne because of the love his family nurtured in him.\n\nAuthor Timothy Morris wrote that the plot and themes in \"Shiloh\" had many parallels to the 1940 novel \"Lassie Come-Home\" by Eric Knight. In both novels, boys fall in love with dogs owned by others. The dogs repeatedly return to the children in \"mirror imag[e] scenes\", while the ethical fathers try to convince them not to betray their morals and fall for the dogs.\n\nMorris wrote that Shiloh's faithfulness to Marty is portrayed in \"affective human terms\". In the secluded, bucolic West Virginia, Shiloh becomes the masculine friend Marty did not have. The beagle adopts the persona of the brother Marty never had. Marty doggedly believes that Shiloh and other animals are creatures with feelings. Attune with Marty's emotions, the beagle is considered by Marty to be a confidante. On the other hand, in pastoral West Virginia, some adults consider animals to bring only economic benefits to humans. Morris stated that children like Marty defy their rural culture and advance to an upper-class mindset.\n\nScholar Claudia Mills wrote that Marty's parents subscribe to the belief that because Shiloh is Judd's property, they should not be concerned with how Judd treats Shiloh. They tell Marty: \"You've got to go by the law. The law says that a man that pays money for a dog owns that dog.\" At odds with this philosophy, Marty strongly believes that love—not money—should determine ownership.\n\nIn \"Shiloh\", Naylor does not impart an explicit meaning of \"honesty\" to her juvenile readers, journalist Nancy Gilson observed. Instead, she conveys how \"confusing and unanswerable\" morality is using main character Marty's ethical predicaments and plot twists. To harbor Shiloh from the antagonist Judd and his principled parents, Marty must steal food and tell falsehoods. His dishonest actions serve as a contrast to his conscientious persona and his benevolent rescuing of the dog. Every night, Marty prays, \"Jesus ... which do you want me to do? Be one hundred percent honest and carry that dog back to Judd so that one of your creatures can be kicked and starved all over again, or keep him here and fatten him up to glorify your creation?\"\n\nAccording to Judith B. Rosenfeld of the \"Knoxville News-Sentinel\", Naylor makes the statement that children raised in healthy families make ethical choices and ultimately thrive. In a 1994 interview Naylor said: Naylor believes that there is much \"gray area between right and wrong\". Instead of following the straightforward correct path, Marty is forced to select between two unpalatable choices. Reviewer Matt Berman of \"The Times-Picayune\" believed that the book's main moral is that \"nothing is as simple as it seems\". \"Entertainment Weekly\" Michele Landsberg praised the novel, writing that \"Shiloh\" is a \"strongly persuasive story of moral growth, told without a hint of moralizing and with acute insight into a preadolescent's inner life\".\n\nIn the children's literature journal \"The ALAN Review\" published by The Assembly on Literature for Adolescents, Edgar H. Thompson, Connie B. Blevins, and Allison Fitzgerald argued that protagonist Marty \"consistently behaves\" at levels 5 and 6 of Kohlberg's stages of development. For instance, on his walk to Judd's house, he wonders: \"Easy as pie for Judd Travers to put a bullet hole in my head, say he didn't see me.\" Despite his fears, Marty continues walking to Judd's house, persistent on protecting Shiloh despite potential bodily harm and even death to himself. The authors brooded over whether an 11 year old could attain such an elevated level despite most adults' never being able to do so. Ultimately noting that the Newbery Committee and thousands of readers consider Marty to be realistic, they concluded that Marty is a positive role model for children to strive to be.\n\nIn her essay \"The Structure of the Moral Dilemma in Shiloh\" for \"Children's Literature\", Claudia Mills wrote that \"Shiloh\" deals with \"consequentialism pitted against deontological respect for moral duty\". Taught from his youth to be respectful to others and worship God, Marty is confounded by the injustice of Shiloh's being abused. He seeks to justify his unethical actions by thinking that \"[a] lie don't seem a lie anymore when it's meant to save a dog.\" Consequentionalists base the worthiness of a person's act on its result. Marty's act of saving Shiloh is worse for Shiloh's well-being. After Shiloh is concealed in the woods, a German shepherd attacks the beagle, causing to become permanently lame. Marty laments: \"Worst of all, I'd brought Shiloh here to keep him from being hurt, and what that German shepherd done to him was probably worse than anything Judd Travers would have brought himself to do, short of shootin' him, anyways.\"\n\nMills noted that consequentialism does not merely expect that the consequences to one entity is determined. It requires a review of the consequences to all. When Marty observes Judd's out-of-season shooting of a deer, he uses the incident to blackmail him to sell Shiloh to him. However, this places deer in the future in danger of Judd's hunting. Marty sadly reflects: \"By lettin' him get away with this, I'm putting other deer in danger. He kill this one out of season, he'll figure maybe he can kill some more. To save Shiloh, I'm making it harder for deer\". In essence, he selects the \"domestic love over the grander principle\".\n\nReviewers observed that religion plays an influential role in Marty's moral decisions. After Marty takes a forbidden bite from his sister Dara Lynn's chocolate Easter rabbit and refuses to own up, his mother is disappointed. She tells him: \"Dara Lynn don't know who ate the ear off her candy rabbit and I don't know who did it, but Jesus knows. And right this minute Jesus is looking down with the saddest eyes on the person who ate that chocolate.\" Marty's very religious mother teaches him that people should not sin or they will be \"separated forever from God's love.\"\n\nAcademic Claudia Mills wrote that Marty determines to save Shiloh in a scene that is reminiscent of Huckleberry Finn's well-known resolution to save Jim from slavery: \"All right, then, I'll go to hell.\" Thinking about the falsehoods he has told to save Shiloh, he believes he is bound for hell. He reflects: \n\nNear the novel's conclusion, Judd refuses to honor his agreement with Marty because there was no witness. When Marty asks his mother what a witness is, she responds: \"Somebody who knows the Lord Jesus and don't mind tellin' about it.\" Despite Judd's refusal to honor the agreement, Marty persistently maintains his part of it. He decides: \"I got no choice. All I can do is stick to my side of the deal and see what happens. All in the world I can do.\" After ultimately ceding Shiloh to Marty, Judd asks: \"What you going to do with that dog once he's yours?\" Marty's simple reply is: \"Love him.\" Scholar Claudia Mills noted that: \"The resolution of the stand-off comes when Marty, in essence, stands witness, in his mother's religious sense of witness, for an ethic of love, crystallized in his love for Shiloh.\"\n\n\"The News & Observer\"s Elizabeth Ward listed \"Shiloh\" as one of the best children's books in 1991. She called the book a \"heartstopping, but tough-as-steel story of a boy and an abused dog in the hardscrabble hill country of West Virginia\". Author Timothy Morris deemed \"Shiloh\" to be the \"most celebrated dog novel of the nineties\". Michele Landsberg of \"Entertainment Weekly\" called \"Shiloh\" a \"compelling read\" and rated the novel an A. Equating \"Shiloh\" to classics like \"Charlotte's Web\", author Laura Elliott praised the novel's \"voice, suspense, and layer of themes\".\n\nAfter \"Shiloh\" received the Newbery Award, Jane Langton wrote in \"The New York Times Book Review\": \"Did \"Shiloh\" really deserve the prize? Surely there must have been a book more important than this agreeable but slight story.\" Langton opined that \"Shiloh\" was \"a good book, not a great book\" and that there must have been few worthy children's books that year. \"The Sacramento Bee\"s Judy Green disagreed, believing that \"Shiloh\" was \"worthy of its award, which labels it the best fiction for children written last year\". Green lauded Naylor for her \"excellent portrayal of Marty's introspection and superb storytelling in the area's vernacular\".\n\nThe \"Booklist\"s Ellen Mandel extolled the novel for its \"moving and powerful look\" at the virtues and vices of human nature and the murky moral choices in conflicts of everyday life. In her favorable review of \"Shiloh\", Betsy Hearne of \"The Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books\" wrote that \"readers will be absorbed by the suspenseful plot, which will leave them with some memorable characterizations as well as several intriguing ethical questions\". K.B. Cartwright of \"The Reading Teacher\" also praised the novel for providing a \"gripping account of family conflict and honesty\". In a similarly positive review, \"Kirkus Reviews\" praised the book for being a \"gripping account of a mountain boy's love for a dog he's hiding from its owner\". Calling it \"unusually warm and moving\", Heather Vogel Frederick of \"The Christian Science Monitor\" praised the novel for being an \"excellent choice as a family read-aloud\".\n\nCensors have objected to the profanity in \"Shiloh\". Naylor received an angry letter from the parents of a 10-year-old boy, who were angered by the language in the book. The character Judd had sworn, \"dammit\". The author replied in an interview with \"The Virginian-Pilot\" that some people in the world \"speak crudely\" and \"you can't put your child in a glass bubble and protect him always\". Several West Virginian book reviewers have complained about the dialect in the novel, believing that West Virginians do not speak with a dialect. In one review, a newspaper writer said that when she read the book to her children, she chose not to read with the dialect.\n\nIn 1992, \"Shiloh\" received the John Newbery Medal. The annual award, bestowed by the children's librarians division of the American Library Association, is given for \"the most distinguished contribution to American literature for children\". \"Shiloh\" was a dark horse for the award. Ohio State University Professor Rudine Sims Bishop, a member of the 1992 Newbery committee, said in an interview that \"Shiloh\" was a \"sleeper\" that surfaced as a serious contender deep in their debate. After the January 27, 1992 announcement of \"Shiloh\"s winning the Newbery Medal, Naylor was flooded with numerous phone calls, requests for interviews, and mail. In an April 1992 interview, Naylor said: \"Frankly, to go the bathroom, I have had to take the phone off the hook.\" The book was also selected as an American Library Association Notable Children's Book.\n\nIn January 1994, over 60,000 third–sixth graders in the state of Oklahoma selected from \"Shiloh\" 23 nominees as the winner of the Sequoyah Children's Book Award. The Sequoyah Award was presented to Naylor in April 1994 during the yearly Oklahoma Library Association conference. On April 14, 1994, at the annual conference of the Missouri Association of School Librarians, \"Shiloh\" received that year's Mark Twain Readers Award. The Mark Twain Award is decided annually through a vote by fourth–eighth graders in the state of Missouri. On October 29, 1994, Naylor received the William Allen White Children's Book Award for \"Shiloh\". The award is decided through the tallying of over 55,000 children in the state of Kansas.\n\nIn 1997, \"The Virginian-Pilot\" chose \"Shiloh\" as the subject of a \"community-wide effort to get people of all ages reading and talking about books\". Beginning in October, the newspaper serialized \"Shiloh\", publishing two chapters every week until the end of November. It also created a book guide about \"Shiloh\" and printed 1,000 copies for parents and teachers. A chat room was created for children to direct questions and comments about \"Shiloh\". In 1999, \"Shiloh\" was selected as a recommended novel for children ages nine to twelve in the Read Across America initiative. In 2000, the \"Shiloh\" trilogy placed at number seven on the National Education Association's Children's Top 100 book list. Naylor was delighted that children had given her work such a high ranking. \"Shiloh\" is taught in many American elementary school courses.\n\n\"Shiloh\" has three sequels, \"Shiloh Season\", \"Saving Shiloh\", and \"A Shiloh Christmas\" published in 1996, 1997, and 2015 respectively. In \"Shiloh Season\", Naylor renews the strife by restoring Judd's hostility and aggravating it with a bout of drinking issues. Marty fears Judd will take back Shiloh and be faithless to the deal they made. Whereas in \"Shiloh\" Marty confronts the confusing and ambiguous concept of morality, in \"Shiloh Season\" he must face the notion of wickedness.\n\nIn the third book, \"Saving Shiloh\", Marty's parents persuade Marty that people who have wronged are worthy of forgiveness. In the midst of several robberies and a murder, the community hastily faults Judd. Willing to grant Judd a second chance, Marty attempts to help him. Meanwhile, Marty and his family must face the intricacies of life such as death, hostility, and sibling rivalry.\n\nPublished on September 22, 2015, the fourth book, \"A Shiloh Christmas\", was published by Atheneum, which printed 200,000 copies. A ferocious drought strikes Marty's community, and a new pastor joins blaming remorseless sinners for instigating it. Looking for a scapegoat, community members lie the responsibility squarely on people like Judd, an alcoholic and animal abuser who has reformed. A fire ravages multiple houses, including Judd's, prompting Marty and his family to help the homeowners reconstruct their homes. One day, Marty and a friend stumble upon Rachel, the pastor's daughter, confined to the pastor's toolshed. The incident forces Marty's parents to determine whether the disciplinary action has crossed the line from being disciplinary to being abusive. The book ends with characters who have vehemently differing views having a therapeutic Christmas meal together.\n\nNaylor penned the sequels in response to \"the surprising degree of hatred which children show toward Judd Travers\". Noting that Judd's life had been molded by the abuse he suffered as a child, she hoped that the novels would enable children to see Judd as a person like Marty who must make difficult moral choices.\n\nThe first three books in the quartet each were made into a movie: \"Shiloh\" in 1996, \"\" in 1999, and \"Saving Shiloh\" in 2006.\n\nIn 1996 Warner Bros. Pictures released \"Shiloh\", which was directed by Dale Rosenbloom. The first of Naylor's more than 100 juvenile and adult works to be adapted into a movie, it starred Blake Heron as Marty and Scott Wilson as Judd Travers. Budgeted at less than $2 million, \"Shiloh\" was filmed in 30 days in October 1996 at Topanga, California.\n\nRosenbloom's film differed from Naylor's novel in several key aspects. In the novel, Marty's family is poor and economic opportunities are limited. The family's four-room homestead is ancient and has not seen remodeling in decades. In the film, the family is wealthy and there are numerous economic opportunities. The family's two-story house is a \"stunning showplace of hardwoods, elegant color schemes, and tasteful appointments\". Marty makes money very quickly by doing various chores. By transforming Marty's family from being poor to being well off, Rosenbloom makes the conflict between Marty and Judd an emotional, instead of an economic one. In the novel, Marty and his family hunt animals, while in the film, his father does not hunt. Author Timothy Morris states that \"[t]he force of the film's ideology is to blur all distinctions between humans and animals\". Judd is transformed from a native in the novel into an interloper in the film who holds the contrarian view that humans and animals are different, that \"[a]nimals were put here for us. They ain' got no other purpose or feelin's.\"\n\nInstead of being about Marty's love for Shiloh, most of the novel occurs in Marty's thoughts such as when he ponders about telling falsehoods to his parents. Because the book was considered \"very internal\" by the major film studios, director Dale Rosenbloom labored over making the film more external. Rosenbloom added new characters and scenes to the story and faxed each change to the novel's author. Naylor was neither fearful of Rosenbloom's changes nor unhesitant at suggesting changes. After the film was released, Naylor said that Rosenbloom \"did a very good job\", and Rosenbloom said, \"We did do right by the book and her ... She lives by her code and if you honor it, she appreciates it.\" By June 1997, Naylor had seen the film six times. In an interview that month, she noted that she was always struck by the hush of the theater and by how the film entrances everyone, even the children.\n\nDespite an underwhelming performance in the movie theaters, the film received high video sales. Ranking \"Shiloh\" as one of his top 10 selections, Roger Ebert praised the film for being a \"remarkably mature and complex story about a boy who loves a dog and cannot bear to see it mistreated\", depicting \"the real world with all of its terrors and responsibilities\". \"Shiloh\" was honored with \"best film\" at the Chicago International Film Festival.\n\nThe audiobook version of \"Shiloh\" was released by Bantam Books in 1992. Performed by Peter MacNicol, the three-hour-long audiobook is unabridged. Author John Wynne praised MacNicol's delivery, writing that he \"does character voices well—both male and female—and creates a folksy atmosphere appropriate to the material\".\n\n"}

It agreed to divest parts of PacifiCare's commercial health insurance business in Tucson, Arizona and Boulder, Colorado to satisfy antitrust regulator concerns, and also agreed to end its network access agreement with Blue Shield of California. The Tucson business was sold to Cigna. The company acquired Prescription Solutions, another pharmacy benefit manager, as part of its acquisition of PacifiCare Health Systems. This business was later rebranded OptumRx.\n\nIn February 2006, the company acquired John Deere Health Care.\n\nIn February 2008, the company acquired Sierra Health Services for $2.6 billion. As part of the transaction, to obtain regulatory approval, 25,000 customers were sold to Humana.\n\nIn July 2009, UnitedHealth Group agreed to acquire Health Net's Northeast licensed subsidiaries for up to $570 million in payments spread out over two years.\n\nThrough 2010 and into 2011, senior executives of the company met monthly with executives of other health insurers to limit the effect of the health care reform law.\n\nIn July 2010, Ingenix acquired Picis, a health information provider for the high-acuity areas of hospitals.\n\nIn 2011, Logistics Health, Inc. of La Crosse, Wisconsin, was acquired by OptumHealth.

Prior to acquisition, in 2015, UnitedHealth supported Rally Health as a majority investor, and through enrolling 5 million UnitedHealth policy holders in Rally Health's flagship product, RallySM. The close relations between UnitedHealth, Audax Health and Rally Health follows a close personal relationship between Grant Vrestandig (Audax and Rally) and UnitedHealth's President and CFO at the time, David Wichmann.\n\nIn June 2019, UnitedHealth's Optum division acquired Davita Medical Group from DaVita Inc. for $4.3 billion.\n\nThe company also agreed to acquire Equian for $3.2 billion.\n\nOn June 19, 2019, UnitedHealth acquired the online patient community platform PatientsLikeMe for an undisclosed amount and it will be incorporated into UnitedHealth Group's research division.\n\nFor the fiscal year 2018, UnitedHealth Group reported earnings of US$11.98 billion, with an annual revenue of US$226.2 billion.\nIn 2010, UnitedHealth Group spent more than $1.8 million on lobbying activities to work to achieve favorable legislation, and hired seven different lobbying firms to work on its behalf. In addition, its corporate political action committee or PAC, called United for Health, spent an additional $1 million on lobbying activities in 2010.\n\nQSSI, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, is one of the 55 contractors hired by United States Department of Health and Human Services to work on the HealthCare.gov web site.\n\nIn 2006, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) began investigating the conduct of UnitedHealth Group's management and directors, for backdating of stock options. Investigations were also begun by the Internal Revenue Service and prosecutors in the U.S. attorney's office for the Southern District of New York, who subpoenaed documents from the company. The investigations came to light after a series of probing stories in the \"Wall Street Journal\" in May 2006, discussing apparent backdating of hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of stock options by UHC management. The backdating apparently occurred with the knowledge and approval of the directors, according to the \"Journal\". Major shareholders have filed lawsuits accusing former New Jersey governor Thomas Kean and UHC's other directors of failing in their fiduciary duty. On October 15, 2006, CEO William W. McGuire was forced to resign, and relinquish hundreds of millions of dollars in stock options. On December 6, 2007, the SEC announced a settlement under which McGuire will repay $468 million, as a partial settlement of the backdating prosecution. \n\nIn June 2006, the American Chiropractic Association filed a national class action lawsuit against the American Chiropractic Network (ACN), which is owned by UnitedHealth Group and administers chiropractic benefits, and against UnitedHealth Group itself, for alleged practices in violation of the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).\n\nIn February 2008, New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo announced an industry-wide investigation into a scheme by health insurers to defraud consumers by manipulating reasonable and customary rates. The announcement included a statement that Cuomo intended \"to file suit against Ingenix, Inc., its parent UnitedHealth Group, and three additional subsidiaries.\" Cuomo asserted that his investigation found that rates found in a database of health care charges maintained by Ingenix were lower than what he determined was the actual cost of certain medical expenses. Cuomo said this inappropriately allowed health insurance companies to deny a portion of provider claims, thereby pushing costs down to members.\nOn January 13, 2009, Ingenix announced an agreement with the New York State attorney settling the probe into the independence of the health pricing database. Under the settlement, UnitedHealth Group and Ingenix would pay $50 million to finance a new, non-profit entity that would develop a new health care pricing database. Ingenix would discontinue its medical pricing databases when the new entity makes its product available. The company acknowledged the appearance of a conflict of interest, but admitted no wrongdoing.\n\nOn January 15, 2009, UnitedHealth Group announced a $350 million settlement of three class action lawsuits filed in Federal court by the American Medical Association, UnitedHealth Group members, healthcare providers, and state medical societies for not paying out-of-network benefits. This settlement came two days after a similar settlement with Cuomo.\n\nOn October 27, 2009, Cuomo announced the creation of FAIR Health, the independent, non-profit organization that will develop a nationwide database for consumer reimbursement, as well as a website where consumers will be able to compare prices before they choose doctors. To fund FAIR Health, the Attorney General's office secured nearly $100 million from insurers such as Aetna, UnitedHealth Group, and Anthem Inc..\n\nIn 2006, the SEC began investigating the conduct of UnitedHealth Group's management and directors, including Dr. McGuire, as did the Internal Revenue Service and prosecutors in the U.S. attorney's office for the Southern District of New York, who have subpoenaed documents from the company.\n\nThe investigations came to light after a series of probing stories in \"The Wall Street Journal\" in March 2006, discussing the apparent backdating of hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of stock options—in a process called options backdating—by UnitedHealth Group management.\nThe backdating apparently occurred with the knowledge and approval of the directors, according to the \"Journal\". Major shareholders have filed lawsuits accusing former New Jersey governor Thomas Kean and UnitedHealth Group's other directors of failing in their fiduciary duty.\n\nOn October 15, 2006, it was announced that William W. McGuire would step down immediately as chairman and director of UnitedHealth Group, and step down as CEO on December 1, 2006, due to his involvement in the employee stock options scandal. Simultaneously, it was announced that he would be replaced as CEO by Stephen Hemsley, who has served as President and COO and is a member of the board of directors. McGuire's exit compensation from UnitedHealth, expected to be around $1.1 billion, would be the largest golden parachute in the history of corporate America.\n\nMcGuire's compensation became controversial again on May 21, 2009, when Elizabeth Edwards, speaking on \"The Daily Show\", used it to support her argument for a public alternative to commercial insurance. Edwards stressed the importance of restoring competition in health insurance markets noting that at one point, \"the President of UnitedHealth made so much money, that one of every $700 that was spent in this country on health care went to pay him.\" Since estimates of McGuire's 2005 compensation range from $59,625,444 to $124.8 million, and the revenue of UnitedHealth Group was then $71 billion, it is therefore possible that Mrs. Edwards may have meant that one of every $700 that was spent on UnitedHealth Group premiums went to pay McGuire.\n\nOn December 6, 2007, the SEC announced a settlement under which McGuire was to repay $468 million, including a $7 million civil penalty, as a partial settlement of the backdating prosecution. He was also barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for ten years. This was the first time in which the little-used \"clawback\" provision under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act was used against an individual by the SEC. The SEC continued its investigations even after it in 2008 settled legal actions against both UnitedHealth Group itself and its former general counsel.\n\nA whistleblower lawsuit, filed in 2011, charges UnitedHealth Group's data analytics division with assisting in defrauding Medicare by boosting risk adjustment scores from Medicare Advantage companies. The suit alleges that UnitedHealth Group subsidiary Ingenix (now OptumInsight) \"defrauded the United States of hundreds of millions — and likely billions — of dollars.\" Former UnitedHealth executive Benjamin Poehling brought the suit under the False Claims Act. The government said it would proceed on claims against two health care companies, UnitedHealth and its Texas subsidiary WellMed Medical Management. In February 2017, a federal judge unsealed the suit after the Department of Justice announced it would join the case.\n\nOn April 29, 2019, Judge Robert N. Scola Jr. of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, a cancer survivor, recused himself from a case against United Healthcare, stating that the company's denial of treatment was \"immoral and barbaric\", and that his opinions regarding the company would prevent him from \"deciding this case fairly and impartially.\"\n\nIn 2008, the California Department of Insurance took action against UnitedHealthcare's subsidiary PacifiCare Health Systems, acquired in 2005, ultimately fining UnitedHealthcare around $173 million for an estimated over 900,000 violations of the Unfair Insurance Practices Act; by 2019, the case was still being disputed in court, with the possibility of affirming $91 million in penalties.\n\nIn 2017, CMS fined UnitedHealthcare after discovering issues in Medicare Part D leading to delays or denials in a 2016 audit.\n\nThe New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance fined UnitedHealthcare $2.5 million due to various compliance issues; this was the largest fine against a licensee in nine years.\n\nUnited Health Care and United Behavioral Health are under investigation in two states for failing to pay millions of dollars of claims for mental health care and for substance abuse treatment. \n\nUnitedHealthcare assessed $1 million penalty for claims payment violations.\n\nUnited Behavioral Health sued over $5 million in denied claims.\n\nThe Lewin Group is a policy research and consulting firm that provides economic analysis of health care and human services issues and policies.\nThe organization has existed for about 40 years and has maintained a nonpartisan reputation through its many ownership changes that have occurred over that time.\nThe Lewin Group was purchased in 2007 by Ingenix, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, but alleges editorial and analytical \"independence\" from UnitedHealth Group, its parent company.\nThe Lewin Group discloses its ownership in its reports and on its web site. While the Lewin Group does not advocate for or against any legislation, both Democratic and Republican politicians frequently cite the firm's studies to argue for and against various U.S. healthcare reform proposals. For example, Democratic Senator Ron Wyden uses Lewin Group estimates to cite the feasibility of his Healthy Americans Act. Former U.S. Representative Eric Cantor, the former House Republican Whip, has referred to the organization as \"the nonpartisan Lewin Group\" in arguing against government-funded health insurance proposals.\n\nSeveral Lewin studies have been used to argue both for and against the inclusion of a public option in national health reform. Lewin clients who often cite its findings include The Commonwealth Fund which recently held up a Lewin study it commissioned to advocate for a public plan. The report showed that legislative proposals would achieve nearly universal coverage and \"estimated that a public plan could offer small businesses insurance that is at least 9 percent cheaper than current small-business policies.\"\n\nHowever, The Lewin Group has acknowledged that clients sometimes choose not to publicize the results of studies they have commissioned. Indeed, Lewin Group Vice President John Sheils told \"The Washington Post\" that \"sometimes studies come out that don't show exactly what the client wants to see. And in those instances, they have [the] option to bury the study.\"\n\nUnitedHealth Group has two foundations, the United Health Foundation and UnitedHealthcare Children’s Foundation which were formed in 1999. Since established by UnitedHealth Group in 1999 as a not for profit private foundation, the United Health Foundation has committed more than $170 million to improve health and health care.\n"}

As a young man he married Rosa Kotila of Ashtabula, with whom he had four children. The marriage ended when the children were young, and he left Ohio, having no further contact with Rosa or the children.\n\nHuhta worked briefly as a reporter for the daily \"News-Tribune\" in Duluth, Minnesota but resigned after an editor \"misquoted him and balled up his article\" about an Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) mass meeting. According to one account, this was when he joined the IWW or \"Wobblies\", as they are sometimes called. Huhta contributed numerous articles and songs to IWW publications over a period of twenty years and was widely regarded as one of the union's finest writers. He was a regular columnist for \"Industrial Solidarity\" and later wrote for the \"Industrial Worker\" and \"Industrialisti\".\n\nIn addition to his writing, Huhta supported himself in various ways. His experience working on docks and barges around the country had by the mid-1930s garnered him a position as barge captain in New York City. On May 15, 1942 Huhta's body was found floating in the Hudson River, where it appeared to have been for several days. The death was ruled an accidental drowning although the exact circumstances were unclear. There was no funeral, and in the end Huhta was buried in a potter's field on Hart Island.\n\nFollowing his death, T-Bone Slim became a source of inspiration for the emerging American surrealist movement, and during the 1960s there was renewed interest in his songs when they were sung by activists during the Civil Rights Movement. In an interview Noam Chomsky cited T-Bone Slim as one of his favorite Wobbly singers.\n\nA number of T-Bone Slim's songs can be found in the \"Little Red Songbook\". Among the best known are \"The Popular Wobbly\", \"Mysteries Of A Hobo's Life\", and \"The Lumberjack's Prayer\". First published by the IWW in 1909, the songbook has never gone out of print. The IWW brought out the 38th edition in 2010 and the Charles H. Kerr Publishing Company has other works by T-Bone Slim in its catalog. For a long time, there were no known photographs of T-Bone Slim, but the cartoon sketch at the head of his column was said to have been a good likeness. However, in 2019 photos of him resurfaced.\n\nThe first Finnish translation of T-Bone Slim's writings was published in 2013.\n\n\n\n\nImages\nLyrics\nVideos\nStreaming audio\nThe Internet Archive\n\nNewberry Library\n\n"}

It is found in the rainforest of southern Thailand and peninsular Malaysia, with the most famous population in the Khao Sok National Park. The local Thai names are Bua Phut (บัวผุด), Yan Kai Tom (ย่านไก่ต้ม) and Bua Tum (บัวตูม).\n\nThe red flowers typically have a diameter of and smell awfully of rotten meat to attract flies for pollination. This species has some claim to being the world's largest flower, for although the average size of R. arnoldi is greater than the average R. kerrii, there have been two recent specimens of exceptional size: One specimen found in the Lojing Highlands of peninsular Malaysia on April 7, 2004 by Prof. Mat-Salleh and Mat Ros measured in width, while another found in August 2007 in Kelantan State, peninsular Malaysia by Dr. Gan Canglin measured . The photograph of Dr Gan with the flower clearly shows that the coronal ring is in width; the largest \"corona\" ever reported anywhere. The plant is a parasite to the wild grapes of the genus \"Tetrastigma\" (\"T. leucostaphylum\", \"T. papillosum\" and \"T. quadrangulum\"), but only the flowers are visible. Small buds appear along the trunk and roots of the host, which after 9 months open the giant flowers. After just one week the flower dies. The species seems to be flowering seasonally, as flowers are only reported during the dry season, from January to March, and more rarely till July.\n\nThe flower is endangered. Though already naturally rare, tourists trying to get close to the flower for photos easily trample the host plant or young buds. Also the locals collect both buds and flowers both as a delicacy as well as for its claimed medical powers. A concoction of cooked buds or flowers is used as a general tonic, to help for fever or backache or even as a sexual stimulant. However, western medicine doesn't recognize any medical power of the flower.\n\nThe flower is the symbol flower of Surat Thani Province, which is the location of the Khao Sok NP.\n\nThe species is named after the Irish botanist A.F.G. Kerr (1877–1942), the first botanist to collect plants extensively in Thailand. It was Kerr who first collected a specimen of this species in 1927, and further three till 1929. The specimen later used as the type specimen was collected on February 3, 1929 at Khao Pho Ta Luang Kaeo near Ranong. It was scientifically collected several times afterwards, believed to be \"R. patma\". In 1984 Willem Meijer described it as a separate species.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1845590", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1845590", "title": "X-linked ichthyosis", "text": "X-linked ichthyosis\n\nX-linked ichthyosis (abbreviated \"XLI\") is a skin condition caused by the hereditary deficiency of the steroid sulfatase (STS) enzyme that affects 1 in 2000 to 1 in 6000 males. XLI manifests with dry, scaly skin and is due to deletions or mutations in the \"STS\" gene. XLI can also occur in the context of larger deletions causing contiguous gene syndromes. Treatment is largely aimed at alleviating the skin symptoms. The term is from the Ancient Greek 'ichthys' meaning 'fish'.\n\nThe major symptoms of XLI include scaling of the skin, particularly on the neck, trunk, and lower extremities. The extensor surfaces are typically the most severely affected areas. The >4 mm diameter scales adhere to the underlying skin and can be dark brown or gray in color. Symptoms may subside during the summer.\nAside from the skin scaling, XLI is not typically associated with other major medical problems. Atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter may affect up to 1 in 10 males with XLI Corneal opacities may be present but do not affect vision. Cryptorchidism is reported in some individuals. Individuals with XLI appear at increased risk of developmental disorders such as autism and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and some affected individuals exhibit mood problems Individuals with XLI can exhibit intellectual disability, although this is thought to be due to deletions encompassing neighboring genes in addition to \"STS\".\n\nFemale carriers generally do not experience any of these problems but can have difficulty during childbirth, as the STS expressed in the placenta plays a role in normal labor. Female carriers may also be at slightly increased risk of developing mental health problems following childbirth For these reasons carriers should ensure their obstetrician is aware of the condition.\n\nThe \"STS\" gene is located on the X chromosome at band Xp22.3. Thus, the syndrome is an X-linked condition, and it affects males and females differently. The 23rd pair of chromosomes is typically termed the \"sex chromosomes\". Females have two X chromosomes and males have one X and one Y chromosome. Therefore, in normal individuals, males carry a single copy of the \"STS\" gene and females carry two copies. This gene partially escapes X-inactivation and females normally express higher amounts of the STS enzyme than males.\n\nXLI can occur through new deletions or mutations of the \"STS\" gene but is more commonly inherited from a carrier mother. A hemizygous deletion or mutation of the \"STS\" gene in a male results in complete absence of enzyme activity, while a female carrier of a mutation or deletion is heterozygous and still has a normal copy of the \"STS\" gene. Female carriers of an \"STS\" deletion or mutation still express the STS enzyme, although with decreased enzyme activity.\n\nFor this reason, XLI most commonly affects males, although individuals with numeric abnormalities of the sex chromosomes (45,X and 47,XXY) who also carry \"STS\" deletions or mutations would be exceptions to this rule.\n\nIn addition, a female could be affected if she were the offspring of an affected male and a carrier female and inherited a deletion or mutation of the \"STS\" gene on both X chromosomes.\n\nSince the majority of cases appear to occur through transmission of an \"STS\" deletion from a carrier mother, enzyme testing or DNA testing should be performed in the mother of any newly diagnosed simplex case (i.e. the first case in a family). In the case of an extended family with many affected individuals, carrier status can often be assigned based on pedigree analysis.\n\n\nDue to random segregation of the chromosomes during gametogenesis, each pregnancy will be subject to the same probabilities, regardless of the number of previously affected or unaffected offspring. The above recurrence risks are based on the assumption that an affected male or carrier female will have children with an unaffected or non-carrier individual. The risks of having affected offspring would clearly increase in the case of a union between a male with XLI and a carrier female.\n\nThe STS enzyme (EC 3.1.6.2), also referred to as Arylsulfatase C, is expressed throughout the body, with highest expression in the skin, liver, lymph nodes, and placenta, and lower expression in breast tissue and brain STS catalyzes the hydrolysis of sulfated steroids, such as estrone sulfate and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), to non-sulfated steroids estradiol and androstenediol, respectively. Prenatally, the enzyme is involved in placental estrogen production. The enzyme is also involved in adrenal steroid production as well as conversion of sulfated steroids in other tissues.\n\nThere seems to be a particularly important role for the enzyme in skin. Deficiency of the enzyme leads to the characteristic dry and scaly skin seen in ichthyosis. Recent research indicates that the skin abnormalities seen in XLI may be due to accumulation of cholesterol sulfate in the outer epidermis, leading to abnormal barrier function and corneocyte retention.\n\nXLI can be suspected based on clinical findings, although symptoms can take varying amounts of time to become evident, from a few hours after birth, up to a year in milder cases. The diagnosis is usually made by a dermatologist, who also typically formulates the treatment plan (see below). STS enzyme deficiency is confirmed using a clinically available biochemical assay. Carrier detection can be performed in mothers of affected sons using this test (see Genetics, below). Molecular testing for DNA deletions or mutations is also offered, and can be particularly useful in the evaluation of individuals with associated medical conditions (see below). Prenatal diagnosis is possible using either biochemical or molecular tests. However, the use of prenatal diagnosis for genetic conditions that are considered to be generally benign raises serious ethical considerations and requires detailed genetic counseling.\n\nBecause XLI is caused by a gene mutation or deletion, there is no \"cure.\" One of the aims of treatment is to reduce scaling by removing the excess, flaky scales, and keep the skin hydrated. This can be achieved using a variety of topical creams. \n\nResearch is ongoing with regard to the use of gene therapy to treat XLI.\n\nIn the 1960s, recessive x-linked ichthyosis was distinguished clinically from other ichthyoses.\n\n"}

(Her reference to Margaret Thatcher in \"Nova\" magazine in 1973 as a 'possible future Prime Minister' is believed to have been the first suggestion of its kind in the media.) In January 1976 she wrote a deeply personal article for the Guardian newspaper about the experience of having a stillborn child. This article was to have far-reaching effects as it was the first time a journalist had written on the subject with such raw feeling, and it directly inspired a shift in the awareness of how to treat stillbirth. She was instrumental in the foundation of the Stillbirth Society, later to be known as Stillbirth and Neonatal Death Society. As well as her fiction (see below) Mooney has written many other books, including 'Bel Mooney's Somerset' (1989) and a memoir about love, loss, recovery – and dogs: 'Small Dogs Can Save Your Life' (2010).\n\nHaving made her name as a journalist, columnist, and a broadcaster, she turned her hand to writing fiction for adults and children. In 1985 she collaborated with Gerald Scarfe on a satire on Margaret Thatcher and her government, called \"Father Kissmas and Mother Claws.\" Mooney's novels for adults are \"The Windsurf Boy\" (1983), \"The Anderson Question\" (1985), \"The Fourth of July\" (1988), \"Lost Footsteps\" (1993), \"Intimate Letters\" (1993) and \"The Invasion of Sand\" (2005). She is the author of the best-selling \"Kitty and Friends\" series of stories for young girls, including \"I Don't Want To!\" and \"So What?\", which were inspired by her own daughter, Katherine. There were 13 volumes in all, published 1985–2002. She then went on to write a series of six books inspired by her small dog Bonnie, with titles like \"Big Dog Bonnie\" and \"Brave Dog Bonnie\". In all, she published 26 books for children and young people. In addition, Bel Mooney has written many short stories for magazines and collections. Published in France as \"Petula\", \"Big Dog Bonnie\" was shortlisted for the prestigious Prix Tam-Tam in France. Her fiction (adults and children) has been translated into twelve languages. Mooney has reviewed fiction and non-fiction for many newspapers including the Spectator, the Observer, the Times and the Times Literary Supplement. She has been a judge for the Whitbread (now Costa) Book of the Year (1986) and the Orange Prize (2008).\n\nShe was a regular broadcaster on BBC Radio 4 from 1982 until 2008, notably as presenter of \"Devout Sceptics\", a programme devoted to public figures' private beliefs – the participants were not necessarily agnostic or atheistic, as the title might suggest. She also made many series for Channel 4 (for example \"Mothers By Daughters\", 1983) and BBC2 (\"Grief\", 1994) and one-off documentaries on people including Ellen Wilkinson MP and Dora Russell. In the '90s Mooney was interviewed many times on radio and television in connection with environmental campaigning. In particular she was involved, like her former husband, in the campaign against the Batheaston Bypass in the 1993–95. During the '80s and '90s she wrote six novels and made many programmes for television and for Radio 4.\n\nIn June 2007 she began writing a weekly column for the Saturday edition of the \"Daily Mail\" (after two years in the same role at \"The Times\"), advising readers on emotional and relationship issues, and she contributes other comment articles to the paper as well as regular book reviews.\n\nShe was awarded the degree, Hon D.Litt., from the University of Bath in 1998 and appointed Honorary Fellow of Liverpool John Moores University in 2002 and is a Fellow of University College London. \"Devout Sceptics\" (BBC Radio 4) won a Sandford St Martin Trust award for religious broadcasting, and the children's novel \"The Voices of Silence\" won a New York Public Library Book of the Year citation and was shortlisted for a Gold Medal in the state of California. She has won special awards for journalism from charities including \"CRUSE\". In the '90s she was involved in the establishment of a new literary festival in Bath, and introduced the first ever 'performer', Ted Hughes, in 1996. From 2002 until 2011 she was involved in charitable fund-raising in Bath, as Chairman of the Egg Appeal (to built a dedicated theatre for young people), as President of the Royal United Hospital appeal to build a new NICU (Neonatal Intensive Care) unit, and as Chair of the 2010 appeal to refurbish the Theatre Royal, Bath, Somerset. She served on the board of directors of that theatre until 2015. Mooney is also Patron of National Family Mediation (NFM) and Relate. In 2018 she became Founder-Patron of the stillbirth charity SANDS, at its fortieth anniversary (https://www.sands.org.uk/about-sands/who-we-are/our-history).\n\nMooney was married to the television journalist Jonathan Dimbleby for thirty-five years. During their married life they maintained an organic farm. The couple separated in 2004 after Jonathan Dimbleby's affair with opera singer Susan Chilcott; they divorced in 2006. Mooney and Dimbleby have two adult children, Kitty (born 1980), a freelance journalist and charity consultant and Daniel (born 1974), a television producer/director. On 8 September 2007, Mooney married Robin Allison-Smith, formerly a freelance photographer, now a businessman, with whom she lives on the outskirts of Bath, Somerset.\n\n\n"}

Rubenstein\n\nRichard Lowell Rubenstein (born January 8, 1924 in New York City) is an educator in religion and a writer in the American Jewish community, noted particularly for his contributions to Holocaust theology. A Connecticut resident, he was married to art historian Betty Rogers Rubenstein (deceased 2013).\n\nRubenstein began his tertiary education at Hebrew Union College, an institution within the Reform Judaism tradition. He graduated from the University of Cincinnati with a B.A. degree. He then was awarded the Master of Hebrew Literature from the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (Conservative tradition) and was also ordained as a rabbi by that institution. He then studied at Harvard Divinity School and was awarded a Master of Sacred Theology degree. Finally, he pursued doctoral studies and received a Ph.D. from Harvard University, in 1960.\n\nRubenstein has two honorary doctorates: Doctor of Hebrew Letters (Jewish Theological Seminary) and Doctor of Humane Letters (Grand Valley State University).\n\nFollowing his ordination in 1952, Rubenstein was the rabbi of two Massachusetts congregations in succession, and then in 1956 became assistant director of the B'nai B'rith Hillel Foundation and chaplain to the Jewish students at Harvard University, Radcliffe and Wellesley, where he served until 1958. From 1958 to 1970 he was the director of the B'nai B'rith Hillel Foundation and chaplain to the Jewish students at the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie-Mellon University and Duquesne University. At the University of Pittsburgh he also taught an upper division course on French Existentialism. Rubenstein taught in religious studies at Florida State University from 1970 to 1995 and held the professorial chair. He then became president and professor of Religion at the University of Bridgeport, where he served from 1995 to 1999.\n\nRubenstein has also been a newspaper columnist for a Japanese newspaper and has written many books concerned with the Holocaust, theology, Jewish-Christian relations, ethics, and politics.\n\nRubenstein emerged in the 1960s as a significant writer on the meaning and impact of the Holocaust for Judaism. His first book, \"After Auschwitz\", explored radical theological frontiers in Jewish thought. Rubenstein argued that the experience of the Holocaust shattered the traditional Judaic concept of God, especially as the God of the covenant with Abraham, in which the God of Israel is the God of history. Rubenstein argued that Jews could no longer advocate the notion of an omnipotent God at work in history or espouse the election of Israel as the chosen people. In the wake of the Holocaust, he believed that Jews have lost hope and there is no ultimate meaning to life.\n\n[A]s children of the Earth, we are undeceived concerning our destiny. We have lost all hope, consolation and illusion.\n\nIn \"After Auschwitz\", Rubenstein argued that the covenant had died. He did not mean he was now an atheist, nor that religion had to be discarded as irrelevant. However, he believed not in a transcendent God, but in God as the ground of being:\n\nTerms like \"ground\" and \"source\" stand in contrast to the terms used for the transcendent biblical God of history who is known as a supreme king, a father, a creator, a judge, a maker. When he creates the world, he does so as do males, producing something external to himself. He remains essentially outside of and judges the creative processes he has initiated. As ground and source, God creates as does a mother, in and through her own very substance. As ground of being, God participates in all the joys and sorrows of the drama of creation which is, at the same time, the deepest expression of the divine life. God's unchanging unitary life and that of the cosmos' ever-changing, dynamic multiplicity ultimately reflect a single unitary reality.\n\nRubenstein explored what the nature and form of religious existence could possibly comprise after Auschwitz (e.g., after the experience of the Holocaust). He suggested that perhaps the way forward was to choose some form of paganism.\n\nWhen his work was released in 1966, it appeared at a time when a \"death of God\" movement was emerging in radical theological discussions among Protestant theologians such as Gabriel Vahanian, Paul Van Buren, William Hamilton, and Thomas J. J. Altizer. Among those Protestants, the discussions centred on modern secular unbelief, the collapse of the belief in any transcendent order to the universe, and their implications for Christianity. Theologians such as Altizer felt at the time that \"as 'Death of God' theologians we have now been joined by a distinguished Jewish theologian, Dr Richard Rubenstein.\"\n\nDuring the 1960s, the \"Death of God\" movement achieved considerable notoriety and was featured as the cover story of the April 8, 1966, edition of \"Time\" magazine. However, as a movement of thought among theologians in Protestant circles, it had dissipated from its novelty by the turn of the 1970s.\n\nRubenstein was a defender of the Unification Church and served on its advisory council, as well as on the board of directors of the church-owned \"Washington Times\" newspaper. In the 1990s, he served as president of the University of Bridgeport, which was then affiliated with the church. Rubenstein said about the church's founder Sun Myung Moon:\n\nI especially appreciated Rev. Moon's commitment to the fight against Communism. From his own first-hand, personal experience and out of his religious convictions, he understood how tragic a political and social blight that movement had been. I had been in East and West Berlin the week the Berlin Wall was erected in August 1961 and had visited communist Poland in 1965. Unfortunately, many of my liberal academic colleagues did not understand the full nature of the threat as did Rev. Moon. I was impressed with the sophistication of Rev. Moon's anti-communism. He understood communism's evil, but he also stood ready to meet with communist leaders such as Mikhail Gorbachev and Kim Il Sung in the hope of changing or moderating their views.\n\nRubenstein undertook a psychoanalytic study of Paul the Apostle in his book \"My Brother Paul\". He has continued with Holocaust themes in later writings and has adjusted some of his earlier views about God in light of the Kabbalah.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Like the appointment of drum major, the position is derived from British Army traditions. During the early twentieth century, the term sergeant piper was used instead. The pipe major is often assisted by a pipe sergeant, who has similar duties in the band and leads the band in the absence of the pipe major.\n\nIn a civilian band, the pipe major is generally the leader of the band both musically and administratively.\n\nSome pipe majors also compete in solo competitions.\n\nA pipe major's position is an appointment and not a rank. An appointee is required to have attained the rank of at least sergeant and to have successfully completed the pipe major's course at the Army School of Bagpipe Music and Highland Drumming, which is a 28-week long course. A pipe major may subsequently be promoted to staff sergeant/colour sergeant, warrant officer class 2, and rarely warrant officer class 1. A few WO1s later go on to be commissioned as director of music of the Army School of Bagpipe Music and Highland Drumming. Since the pipes and drums of an infantry regiment are typically assigned the military duties of a machine gun platoon, the pipe major is also responsible for:\n\n\nHe is customarily addressed and referred to as \"Pipe Major\", not by his service rank. The insignia of appointment is four point-up chevrons worn on a wrist-strap whilst in shirt-sleeve order, or four large point-up chevrons worn on the uniform sleeve, surmounted by a bagpipe badge. Staff sergeants/colour sergeants have a small crown above the bagpipes, whilst warrant officers class 2 have a larger crown and warrant officers class 1 wear the royal arms as usual.\n\nA pipe major in the Canadian military is also an appointment, not a service rank. Pipe majors are appointed by the commanding officer of a unit or formation. The insignia (a four-bar chevron with bagpipe badge) is usually surmounted by the service rank badge. Regular force personnel attend a year long course at the Canadian Forces School of Music - Pipes and Drums Wing to become qualified to as a pipe major. \n\nMost pipe majors in the Canadian forces are also responsible for regular force volunteer bands or primary reserve bands, and there are two pipe majors posted to regular force brass and reed bands, the Royal Canadian Air Force Band and the Royal Canadian Artillery Band, and one posted to the pipes and drums of the 2nd Battalion, Royal Canadian Regiment, Canada's only regular force army pipe band.\n"}

Russell also synonymized \"Struthiomimus ingens\" with \"Dromiceimimus brevitertius\". He renamed \"Ornithomimus samueli\" into a second \"Dromiceiomimus\" species: \"Dromiceiomimus samueli\". \"Dromiceiomimus\" was distinguished from \"Ornithomimus edmontonicus\" on the basis of the following characters: humerus shorter than scapula; ulna ~70% of femoral length; preacetabular process, tibia, metatarsus and pedal digit III longer compared to femur.\n\nIn a 1981 publication, however, Nicholls and Russell cast doubt on the validity of \"Dromiceiomimus\" and though keeping it distinct from \"Ornithomimus\" argued that the limb proportions might be insufficient to distinguish ornithomimid taxa from each other. In the second edition of the Dinosauria, Makovicky et al. claimed that there is no statistical support for the distinction of \"Dromiceiomimus\" from \"Ornithomimus\", and synonymized it with \"Ornithomimus edmontonicus\" Sternberg 1933.\n\nHowever, a few authors continued to treat \"Dromiceiomimus\" as valid, and Longrich (2008, 2014) treated ROM 840 (holotype of \"Struthiomimus samueli\") as a distinct species of ornithomimid related to \"Ornithomimus\".\n\nIn 2018, Ian McDonald and Philip John Currie rejected the conclusions by Makovicky and colleagues. They showed that the thighbone/shinbone ratio of specimen UALVP 16182, found in 1967 by Richard Fox and referred to \"Dromiceiomimus\", differed significantly from that of \"Ornithomimus edmontonicus\". They also pointed out that if both species were to be considered synonymous nevertheless, the specific name \"brevitertius\" would have priority.\n"}

{"id": "1845623", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1845623", "title": "Raloxifene", "text": "Raloxifene\n\nRaloxifene, sold under the brand name Evista among others, is a medication used to prevent and treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and those on glucocorticoids. For osteoporosis it is less preferred than bisphosphonates. It is also used to reduce the risk of breast cancer in those at high risk. It is taken by mouth.\nCommon side effects include hot flashes, leg cramps, swelling, and joint pain. Severe side effects may include blood clots and stroke. Use during pregnancy may harm the baby. The medication may worsen menstrual symptoms. Raloxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) and therefore a mixed agonist–antagonist of the estrogen receptor (ER). It has estrogenic effects in bone and antiestrogenic effects in the breasts and uterus.\nRaloxifene was approved for medical use in the United States in 1997. It is available as a generic medication. A month supply in the United Kingdom costs the NHS about 3.50 £ as of 2019. In the United States the wholesale cost of this amount is about $16. In 2016 it was the 294th most prescribed medication in the United States with more than a million prescriptions. In 2017, it was the 330th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with less than one million prescriptions.\n\nRaloxifene is used for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. It is used at a dosage of 60 mg/day for both the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. In the case of either osteoporosis prevention or treatment, supplemental calcium and vitamin D should be added to the diet if daily intake is inadequate.\n\nRaloxifene is used to reduce the risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women. It is used at a dosage of 60 mg/day for this indication. In the Multiple Outcomes of Raloxifene (MORE) clinical trial, raloxifene decreased the risk of all types of breast cancer by 62%, of invasive breast cancer by 72%, and of invasive estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer by 84%. Conversely, it does not reduce the risk of estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer. There were no obvious differences in effectiveness of raloxifene in the MORE trial for prevention of breast cancer at a dosage of 60 mg/m/day relative to 120 mg/m/day. In the Study of Tamoxifen and Raloxifene (STAR) trial, 60 mg/day raloxifene was 78% as effective as 20 mg/day tamoxifen in preventing non-invasive breast cancer. Women with undetectable levels of estradiol (<2.7 pg/mL) have a naturally low risk of breast cancer and, in contrast to women with detectable levels of estradiol, do not experience significant benefit from raloxifene in terms of reduction of breast cancer risk.\n\nRaloxifene is contraindicated in lactating women or women who are or who may become pregnant. It also may be of concern to women with active or past history of venous thromboembolic events, including deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and retinal vein thrombosis.\n\nCommon side effects of raloxifene include hot flashes (25–28% vs. 18–21% for placebo), vaginal dryness, and leg cramps (generally mild; 5.5% vs. 1.9% for placebo). Raloxifene does not cause breast tenderness, endometrial hyperplasia, menstrual bleeding, or endometrial cancer. It does not appear to affect cognition or memory. Raloxifene is a teratogen; i.e., it can cause developmental abnormalities such as birth defects.\n\nRaloxifene may infrequently cause serious blood clots to form in the legs, lungs, or eyes. Other reactions experienced include leg swelling/pain, trouble breathing, chest pain, and vision changes. Black box warnings were added to the label of raloxifene in 2007 warning of increased risk of death due to stroke for postmenopausal women with documented coronary heart disease or at increased risk for major coronary events, as well as increased risk for deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. The risk of venous thromboembolism with raloxifene is increased by several-fold in postmenopausal women ( = 3.1). Raloxifene has a lower risk of thromboembolism than tamoxifen. In the MORE trial, raloxifene caused a 40% decrease in risk of cardiovascular events in women who were at increased risk for coronary artery disease, although there was no decrease in cardiovascular events for the group as a whole.\n\nA report in September 2009 from Health and Human Services' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality suggests that tamoxifen and raloxifene, used to treat breast cancer, significantly reduce invasive breast cancer in midlife and older women, but also increase the risk of adverse side effects.\n\nA recent human case report in July 2016 suggests that raloxifene may in fact, at some point, also stimulate breast cancer growth leading to a reduction of advanced breast cancer disease upon the withdrawal of the drug.\n\nUnlike other SERMs, such as tamoxifen, raloxifene has no risk of uterine hyperplasia or endometrial cancer ( = 0.8).\n\nRaloxifene does not increase the incidence of breast pain or tenderness in postmenopausal women.\n\nRaloxifene has been studied in clinical trials across a dosage range of 30 to 600 mg/day, and was well-tolerated at all dosages.\n\nRaloxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) and hence is a mixed agonist and antagonist of the estrogen receptor (ER) in different tissues. It has estrogenic activity in some tissues, such as bone and the liver, and antiestrogenic activity in other tissues, such as the breasts and uterus. Its affinity (K) for the ERα is approximately 50 pM, which is similar to that of estradiol. Relative to estradiol, raloxifene has been reported to possess about 8 to 34% of the affinity for the ERα and 0.5 to 76% of the affinity for the ERβ. Raloxifene acts as a partial agonist of the ERα and as a pure antagonist of the ERβ. In contrast to the classical ERs, raloxifene is an agonist of the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) ( = 10–100 nM), a membrane estrogen receptor.\n\nRaloxifene has antiestrogenic effects in the mammary glands in preclinical studies. In accordance, raloxifene reduces breast density in postmenopausal women, a known risk factor for breast cancer. It does not stimulate the uterus in postmenopausal women, and results in no increase in risk of endometrial thickening, vaginal bleeding, endometrial hyperplasia, or endometrial cancer. At the same time, raloxifene has minimal antiestrogenic effect in the uterus in premenopausal women. This may possibly be due to inadequate tissue exposure of the uterus to raloxifene in these estrogen-rich individuals.\n\nIn premenopausal women, raloxifene increases levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol. Conversely, in postmenopausal women, raloxifene has been found to reduce levels of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and FSH, while not affecting levels of estradiol. Raloxifene also decreases prolactin levels in postmenopausal women. In men, raloxifene has been found to disinhibit the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis (HPG axis) and thereby increase total testosterone levels. Due to the simultaneous increase in sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels however, free testosterone levels often remain unchanged in men during therapy with raloxifene.\n\nRaloxifene has estrogenic effects on liver protein synthesis. It increases SHBG levels in both pre- and postmenopausal women as well as in men. The medication decreases levels of total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, C-reactive protein, apolipoprotein B, and homocysteine. Conversely, it has little effect on levels of triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Raloxifene has been shown to inhibit the oxidation of LDL cholesterol \"in vitro\". The medication has been found to decrease insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels in pre- and postmenopausal women as well as in men. It has also been found to increase insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) levels in pre- and postmenopausal women. Due to activation of estrogen receptors in the liver, raloxifene has procoagulatory effects, such as decreasing levels of fibrinogen and influencing levels of other coagulation factors. For these reasons, raloxifene increases the risk of thrombosis.\n\nRaloxifene increases bone mineral density in postmenopausal women but decreases it in premenopausal women. In the MORE trial, the risk of vertebral fractures was decreased by 30%, and bone mineral density was increased in the spine (by 2.1% at 60 mg, 2.4% at 120 mg) and femoral neck (2.6% at 60 mg, 2.7% at 120 mg). It has been found to possess estrogenic effects in adipose tissue in postmenopausal women, promoting a shift from an android fat distribution to a gynoid fat distribution. The medication has been found to increase levels of leptin, an adipokine.\n\nThe absorption of raloxifene is approximately 60%. However, due to extensive first-pass metabolism, the absolute bioavailability of raloxifene is only 2.0%. Raloxifene is rapidly absorbed from the intestines upon oral administration. Peak plasma levels of raloxifene occur 0.5 to 6 hours after an oral dose.\n\nRaloxifene is widely distributed throughout the body. There is extensive distribution of raloxifene into the liver, serum, lungs, and kidneys. The volume of distribution of raloxifene with a single 30 to 150 mg oral dose is approximately 2348 L. Both raloxifene and its metabolites show high plasma protein binding (>95%), including to both albumin and α acid glycoprotein, but not to sex hormone-binding globulin.\n\nRaloxifene is metabolized in the liver and undergoes enterohepatic recycling. It is metabolized exclusively by glucuronidation and is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system. Less than 1% of radiolabeled material in plasma comprises unconjugated raloxifene. The metabolites of raloxifene include several glucuronides. The elimination half-life of raloxifene after a single dose is 27.7 hours (1.2 days), whereas its half-life at steady state at a dosage of 60 mg/day is 15.8 to 86.6 hours (0.7–3.6 days), with an average of 32.5 hours (1.4 days). The extended half-life of raloxifene is attributed to enterohepatic recirculation and its high plasma protein binding. Raloxifene and its glucuronide conjugates are interconverted by reversible metabolism and enterohepatic recycling, which prolongs the elimination half-life of raloxifene with oral administration. The medication is deconjugated into its active form in a variety of tissues, including liver, lungs, spleen, bone, uterus, and kidneys.\n\nRaloxifene is mainly excreted in bile and is eliminated in feces. Less than 0.2% of a dose is excreted unchanged in urine and less than 6% of a dose is excreted in urine as glucuronide conjugates.\n\nRaloxifene hydrochloride has the empirical formula CHNOS•HCl, which corresponds to a molecular weight of 510.05 g/mol. Raloxifene hydrochloride is an off-white to pale-yellow solid that is slightly soluble in water.\n\nRaloxifene is a benzothiophene derivative and is structurally distinct from the triphenylethylene SERMs like tamoxifen, clomifene, and toremifene. It is the only benzothiophene SERM to have been marketed. A benzothiophene SERM that was not marketed is arzoxifene (LY-353381). Bazedoxifene (Duavee, Viviant) and pipendoxifene (ERA-923) are structurally related to raloxifene but are technically not benzothiophenes and instead are indoles.\n\nRaloxifene was approved in the United States for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis in 1997, the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in 1999, and to prevent or reduce the risk of breast cancer in certain postmenopausal women in 2007. It received orphan designation in 2005.\n\n\"Raloxifene\" is the generic name of the drug and its and , while \"raloxifène\" is its and \"raloxifene hydrochloride\" is its , , and . It has also been known by the name \"keoxifene\".\n\nRaloxifene is sold mainly under the brand name Evista and to a lesser extent the brand name Optruma. It is also sold under a variety of other brand names in various countries.\n\nRaloxifene is available widely throughout the world, including in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, elsewhere throughout Europe, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Latin America, Southern, Eastern, and Southeastern Asia, and elsewhere in the world such as in Israel and Egypt.\n\nRaloxifene is provided in the form of 60 mg oral tablets.\n\nAn editorial in Lancet Oncology criticized the way that research about the medication for breast cancer prevention was released.\n\nClinical studies of raloxifene for metastatic breast cancer in women have found little effectiveness at 60 mg/day in those previously treated with tamoxifen, but modest effectiveness has been observed at higher doses. In contrast to tamoxifen, raloxifene is not approved for the treatment of breast cancer.\n\nRaloxifene has been studied in men for a variety of uses, such as for treatment of schizophrenia, prostate cancer, and osteoporosis.

It is primarily about George Washington's leadership during the 1776 campaign of the American Revolutionary War, culminating with George Washington's crossing of the Delaware River and the subsequent campaign, with the Battle of Trenton, the Battle of the Assunpink Creek, and the Battle of Princeton.\n\nFischer discusses the historical context of the crossing, including the crossing's precursors, the intensity of effort required to make the crossing itself, and the effects upon the outcome of the American Revolutionary War made possible by the success of the crossing and the brilliant exploitation. He follows up with more than 180 pages, divided into appendices, source citations, and acknowledgements.\n\nUsing as his starting point, the famous painting \"Washington Crossing the Delaware\" by Emmanuel Leutze, Fischer continues through the shift in momentum resulting from this campaign. He shows that before the crossing, the British were intent upon attacking and defeating the revolutionaries. After the crossing and subsequent campaign, the British focused on being attacked.\n\nFischer proceeds through the aftermath and finishes with a discussion of how a new, American way of fighting developed during the campaign surrounding the crossing, including an entrepreneurial spirit and a policy of humanity. The goal-oriented spirit still guides America's warfare: to win the war and then to return to everyday life with all dispatch. The Americans' policy of humanity to their defeated opponents was so attractive that large numbers of the Hessian enemy stayed in America, and more returned with their families following the war.\n\nFischer's work is admired as one of the most comprehensive books on the critical and suspenseful turning point of the American War of Independence. The book was published in February 2004 and it won the 2005 Pulitzer Prize for History.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1845675", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1845675", "title": "Deductive-nomological model", "text": "Deductive-nomological model\n\nThe deductive-nomological model (DN model), also known as Hempel's model, the Hempel–Oppenheim model, the Popper–Hempel model, or the covering law model, is a formal view of scientifically answering questions asking, \"Why...?\". The DN model poses scientific explanation as a deductive structure—that is, one where truth of its premises entails truth of its conclusion—hinged on accurate prediction or postdiction of the phenomenon to be explained.\n\nBecause of problems concerning humans' ability to define, discover, and know causality, this was omitted in initial formulations of the DN model. Causality was thought to be incidentally approximated by realistic selection of premises that \"derive\" the phenomenon of interest from observed starting conditions plus general laws. Still, the DN model formally permitted causally irrelevant factors. Also, derivability from observations and laws sometimes yielded absurd answers.\n\nWhen logical empiricism fell out of favor in the 1960s, the DN model was widely seen as a flawed or greatly incomplete model of scientific explanation. Nonetheless, it remained an idealized version of scientific explanation, and one that was rather accurate when applied to modern physics. In the early 1980s, a revision to the DN model emphasized \"maximal specificity\" for relevance of the conditions and axioms stated. Together with Hempel's inductive-statistical model, the DN model forms scientific explanation's covering law model, which is also termed, from critical angle, subsumption theory.\n\nThe term \"deductive\" distinguishes the DN model's intended determinism from the probabilism of inductive inferences. The term \"nomological\" is derived from the Greek word \"νόμος\" or \"nomos\", meaning \"law\". The DN model holds to a view of scientific explanation whose \"conditions of adequacy\" (CA)—semiformal but stated classically—are \"derivability\" (CA1), \"lawlikeness\" (CA2), \"empirical content\" (CA3), and \"truth\" (CA4).\n\nIn the DN model, a law axiomatizes an unrestricted generalization from antecedent \"A\" to consequent \"B\" by conditional proposition—\"If A, then B\"—and has empirical content testable. A law differs from mere true regularity—for instance, \"George always carries only $1 bills in his wallet\"—by supporting counterfactual claims and thus suggesting what \"must\" be true, while following from a scientific theory's axiomatic structure.\n\nThe phenomenon to be explained is the explanandum—an event, law, or theory—whereas the premises to explain it are explanans, true or highly confirmed, containing at least one universal law, and entailing the explanandum. Thus, given the explanans as initial, specific conditions \"C, C . . . C\" plus general laws \"L, L . . . L\", the phenomenon \"E\" as explanandum is a deductive consequence, thereby scientifically explained.\n\nAristotle's scientific explanation in \"Physics\" resembles the DN model, an idealized form of scientific explanation. The framework of Aristotelian physics—Aristotelian metaphysics—reflected the perspective of this principally biologist, who, amid living entities' undeniable purposiveness, formalized vitalism and teleology, an intrinsic morality in nature. With emergence of Copernicanism, however, Descartes introduced mechanical philosophy, then Newton rigorously posed lawlike explanation, both Descartes and especially Newton shunning teleology within natural philosophy. At 1740, David Hume staked Hume's fork, highlighted the problem of induction, and found humans ignorant of either necessary or sufficient causality. Hume also highlighted the fact/value gap, as what \"is\" does not itself reveal what \"ought\".\n\nNear 1780, countering Hume's ostensibly radical empiricism, Immanuel Kant highlighted extreme rationalism—as by Descartes or Spinoza—and sought middle ground. Inferring the mind to arrange experience of the world into \"substance\", \"space\", and \"time\", Kant placed the mind as part of the causal constellation of experience and thereby found Newton's theory of motion universally true, yet knowledge of things in themselves impossible. Safeguarding science, then, Kant paradoxically stripped it of scientific realism. Aborting Francis Bacon's inductivist mission to dissolve the veil of appearance to uncover the \"noumena\"—metaphysical view of nature's ultimate truths—Kant's transcendental idealism tasked science with simply modeling patterns of \"phenomena\". Safeguarding metaphysics, too, it found the mind's constants holding also universal moral truths, and launched German idealism, increasingly speculative.\n\nAuguste Comte found the problem of induction rather irrelevant since enumerative induction is grounded on the empiricism available, while science's point is not metaphysical truth. Comte found human knowledge had evolved from theological to metaphysical to scientific—the ultimate stage—rejecting both theology and metaphysics as asking questions unanswerable and posing answers unverifiable. Comte in the 1830s expounded positivism—the first modern philosophy of science and simultaneously a political philosophy—rejecting conjectures about unobservables, thus rejecting search for \"causes\". Positivism predicts observations, confirms the predictions, and states a \"law\", thereupon applied to benefit human society. From late 19th century into the early 20th century, the influence of positivism spanned the globe. Meanwhile, evolutionary theory's natural selection brought the Copernican Revolution into biology and eventuated in the first conceptual alternative to vitalism and teleology.\n\nWhereas Comtean positivism posed science as \"description\", logical positivism emerged in the late 1920s and posed science as \"explanation\", perhaps to better unify empirical sciences by covering not only fundamental science—that is, fundamental physics—but special sciences, too, such as biology, psychology, economics, and anthropology. After defeat of National Socialism with World War II's close in 1945, logical positivism shifted to a milder variant, \"logical empiricism\". All variants of the movement, which lasted until 1965, are neopositivism, sharing the quest of verificationism.\n\nNeopositivists led emergence of the philosophy subdiscipline philosophy of science, researching such questions and aspects of scientific theory and knowledge. Scientific realism takes scientific theory's statements at face value, thus accorded either falsity or truth—probable or approximate or actual. Neopositivists held scientific antirealism as instrumentalism, holding scientific theory as simply a device to predict observations and their course, while statements on nature's unobservable aspects are elliptical at or metaphorical of its observable aspects, rather.\n\nDN model received its most detailed, influential statement by Carl G Hempel, first in his 1942 article \"The function of general laws in history\", and more explicitly with Paul Oppenheim in their 1948 article \"Studies in the logic of explanation\". Leading logical empiricist, Hempel embraced the Humean empiricist view that humans observe sequence of sensory events, not cause and effect, as causal relations and casual mechanisms are unobservables. DN model bypasses causality beyond mere constant conjunction: first an event like \"A\", then always an event like \"B\".\n\nHempel held natural laws—empirically confirmed regularities—as satisfactory, and if included realistically to approximate causality. In later articles, Hempel defended DN model and proposed probabilistic explanation by \"inductive-statistical model\" (IS model). DN model and IS model—whereby the probability must be high, such as at least 50%—together form \"covering law model\", as named by a critic, William Dray. Derivation of statistical laws from other statistical laws goes to the \"deductive-statistical model\" (DS model). Georg Henrik von Wright, another critic, named the totality \"subsumption theory\".\n\nAmid failure of neopositivism's fundamental tenets, Hempel in 1965 abandoned verificationism, signaling neopositivism's demise. From 1930 onward, Karl Popper had refuted any positivism by asserting falsificationism, which Popper claimed had killed positivism, although, paradoxically, Popper was commonly mistaken for a positivist. Even Popper's 1934 book embraces DN model, widely accepted as the model of scientific explanation for as long as physics remained the model of science examined by philosophers of science.\n\nIn the 1940s, filling the vast observational gap between cytology and biochemistry, cell biology arose and established existence of cell organelles besides the nucleus. Launched in the late 1930s, the molecular biology research program cracked a genetic code in the early 1960s and then converged with cell biology as \"cell and molecular biology\", its breakthroughs and discoveries defying DN model by arriving in quest not of lawlike explanation but of causal mechanisms. Biology became a new model of science, while special sciences were no longer thought defective by lacking universal laws, as borne by physics.\n\nIn 1948, when explicating DN model and stating scientific explanation's semiformal \"conditions of adequacy\", Hempel and Oppenheim acknowledged redundancy of the third, \"empirical content\", implied by the other three—\"derivability\", \"lawlikeness\", and \"truth\". In the early 1980s, upon widespread view that causality ensures the explanans' relevance, Wesley Salmon called for returning \"cause\" to \"because\", and along with James Fetzer helped replace CA3 \"empirical content\" with CA3' \"strict maximal specificity\".\n\nSalmon introduced \"causal mechanical\" explanation, never clarifying how it proceeds, yet reviving philosophers' interest in such. Via shortcomings of Hempel's inductive-statistical model (IS model), Salmon introduced \"statistical-relevance model\" (SR model). Although DN model remained an idealized form of scientific explanation, especially in applied sciences, most philosophers of science consider DN model flawed by excluding many types of explanations generally accepted as scientific.\n\nAs theory of knowledge, epistemology differs from ontology, which is a subbranch of metaphysics, theory of reality. Ontology poses which categories of being—what sorts of things exist—and so, although a scientific theory's ontological commitment can be modified in light of experience, an ontological commitment inevitably precedes empirical inquiry.\n\nNatural laws, so called, are statements of humans' observations, thus are epistemological—concerning human knowledge—the \"epistemic\". Causal mechanisms and structures existing putatively independently of minds exist, or would exist, in the natural world's structure itself, and thus are ontological, the \"ontic\". Blurring epistemic with ontic—as by incautiously presuming a natural law to refer to a causal mechanism, or to trace structures realistically during unobserved transitions, or to be true regularities always unvarying—tends to generate a \"category mistake\".\n\nDiscarding ontic commitments, including causality \"per se\", DN model permits a theory's laws to be reduced to—that is, subsumed by—a more fundamental theory's laws. The higher theory's laws are explained in DN model by the lower theory's laws. Thus, the epistemic success of Newtonian theory's law of universal gravitation is reduced to—thus explained by—Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, although Einstein's discards Newton's ontic claim that universal gravitation's epistemic success predicting Kepler's laws of planetary motion is through a causal mechanism of a straightly attractive force instantly traversing absolute space despite absolute time.\n\nCovering law model reflects neopositivism's vision of empirical science, a vision interpreting or presuming unity of science, whereby all empirical sciences are either fundamental science—that is, fundamental physics—or are special sciences, whether astrophysics, chemistry, biology, geology, psychology, economics, and so on. All special sciences would network via covering law model. And by stating \"boundary conditions\" while supplying \"bridge laws\", any special law would reduce to a lower special law, ultimately reducing—theoretically although generally not practically—to fundamental science. (\"Boundary conditions\" are specified conditions whereby the phenomena of interest occur. \"Bridge laws\" translate terms in one science to terms in another science.)\n\nBy DN model, if one asks, \"Why is that shadow 20 feet long?\", another can answer, \"Because that flagpole is 15 feet tall, the Sun is at \"x\" angle, and laws of electromagnetism\". Yet by problem of symmetry, if one instead asked, \"Why is that flagpole 15 feet tall?\", another could answer, \"Because that shadow is 20 feet long, the Sun is at \"x\" angle, and laws of electromagnetism\", likewise a deduction from observed conditions and scientific laws, but an answer clearly incorrect. By the problem of irrelevance, if one asks, \"Why did that man not get pregnant?\", one could in part answer, among the explanans, \"Because he took birth control pills\"—if he factually took them, and the law of their preventing pregnancy—as covering law model poses no restriction to bar that observation from the explanans.\n\nMany philosophers have concluded that causality is integral to scientific explanation. DN model offers a necessary condition of a causal explanation—successful prediction—but not sufficient conditions of causal explanation, as a universal regularity can include spurious relations or simple correlations, for instance \"Z\" always following \"Y\", but not \"Z\" because of \"Y\", instead \"Y\" and then \"Z\" as an effect of \"X\". By relating temperature, pressure, and volume of gas within a container, Boyle's law permits prediction of an unknown variable—volume, pressure, or temperature—but does not explain \"why\" to expect that unless one adds, perhaps, the kinetic theory of gases.\n\nScientific explanations increasingly pose not determinism's universal laws, but probabilism's chance, \"ceteris paribus\" laws. Smoking's contribution to lung cancer fails even the inductive-statistical model (IS model), requiring probability over 0.5 (50%). (Probability standardly ranges from 0 (0%) to 1 (100%).) An applied science that applies statistics seeking associations between events, epidemiology cannot show causality, but consistently found higher incidence of lung cancer in smokers versus otherwise similar nonsmokers, although the proportion of smokers who develop lung cancer is modest. Versus nonsmokers, however, smokers as a group showed over 20 times the risk of lung cancer, and in conjunction with basic research, consensus followed that smoking had been scientifically explained as \"a\" cause of lung cancer, responsible for some cases that without smoking would not have occurred, a probabilistic counterfactual causality.\n\nThrough lawlike explanation, fundamental physics—often perceived as fundamental science—has proceeded through intertheory relation and theory reduction, thereby resolving experimental paradoxes to great historical success, resembling covering law model. In early 20th century, Ernst Mach as well as Wilhelm Ostwald had resisted Ludwig Boltzmann's reduction of thermodynamics—and thereby Boyle's law—to statistical mechanics partly \"because\" it rested on kinetic theory of gas, hinging on atomic/molecular theory of matter. Mach as well as Ostwald viewed matter as a variant of energy, and molecules as mathematical illusions, as even Boltzmann thought possible.\n\nIn 1905, via statistical mechanics, Albert Einstein predicted the phenomenon Brownian motion—unexplained since reported in 1827 by botanist Robert Brown. Soon, most physicists accepted that atoms and molecules were unobservable yet real. Also in 1905, Einstein explained the electromagnetic field's energy as distributed in \"particles\", doubted until this helped resolve atomic theory in the 1910s and 1920s. Meanwhile, all known physical phenomena were gravitational or electromagnetic, whose two theories misaligned. Yet belief in aether as the source of all physical phenomena was virtually unanimous. At experimental paradoxes, physicists modified the aether's hypothetical properties.\n\nFinding the luminiferous aether a useless hypothesis, Einstein in 1905 \"a priori\" unified all inertial reference frames to state special \"principle\" of relativity, which, by omitting aether, converted space and time into \"relative\" phenomena whose relativity aligned electrodynamics with the Newtonian principle Galilean relativity or invariance. Originally epistemic or instrumental, this was interpreted as ontic or realist—that is, a causal mechanical explanation—and the \"principle\" became a \"theory\", refuting Newtonian gravitation. By predictive success in 1919, general relativity apparently overthrew Newton's theory, a revolution in science resisted by many yet fulfilled around 1930.\n\nIn 1925, Werner Heisenberg as well as Erwin Schrödinger independently formalized quantum mechanics (QM). Despite clashing explanations, the two theories made identical predictions. Paul Dirac's 1928 model of the electron was set to special relativity, launching QM into the first quantum field theory (QFT), quantum electrodynamics (QED). From it, Dirac interpreted and predicted the electron's antiparticle, soon discovered and termed \"positron\", but the QED failed electrodynamics at high energies. Elsewhere and otherwise, strong nuclear force and weak nuclear force were discovered.\n\nIn 1941, Richard Feynman introduced QM's path integral formalism, which if taken toward \"interpretation\" as a causal mechanical model clashes with Heisenberg's matrix formalism and with Schrödinger's wave formalism, although all three are empirically identical, sharing predictions. Next, working on QED, Feynman sought to model particles without fields and find the vacuum truly empty. As each known fundamental force is apparently an effect of a field, Feynman failed. Louis de Broglie's waveparticle duality had rendered atomism—indivisible particles in a void—untenable, and highlighted the very notion of discontinuous particles as selfcontradictory.\n\nMeeting in 1947, Freeman Dyson, Richard Feynman, Julian Schwinger, and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga soon introduced \"renormalization\", a procedure converting QED to physics' most predictively precise theory, subsuming chemistry, optics, and statistical mechanics. QED thus won physicists' general acceptance. Paul Dirac criticized its need for renormalization as showing its unnaturalness, and called for an aether. In 1947, Willis Lamb had found unexpected motion of electron orbitals, shifted since the vacuum is not truly empty. Yet \"emptiness\" was catchy, abolishing aether conceptually, and physics proceeded ostensibly without it, even suppressing it. Meanwhile, \"sickened by untidy math, most philosophers of physics tend to neglect QED\".\n\nPhysicists have feared even mentioning \"aether\", renamed \"vacuum\", which—as such—is nonexistent. General philosophers of science commonly believe that aether, rather, is fictitious, \"relegated to the dustbin of scientific history ever since\" 1905 brought special relativity. Einstein was noncommittal to aether's nonexistence, simply said it superfluous. Abolishing Newtonian motion for electrodynamic primacy, however, Einstein inadvertently reinforced aether, and to explain motion was led back to aether in general relativity. Yet resistance to relativity theory became associated with earlier theories of aether, whose word and concept became taboo. Einstein explained special relativity's compatibility with an aether, but Einstein aether, too, was opposed. Objects became conceived as pinned directly on space and time by abstract geometric relations lacking ghostly or fluid medium.\n\nBy 1970, QED along with weak nuclear field was reduced to electroweak theory (EWT), and the strong nuclear field was modeled as quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Comprised by EWT, QCD, and Higgs field, this Standard Model of particle physics is an \"effective theory\", not truly fundamental. As QCD's particles are considered nonexistent in the everyday world, QCD especially suggests an aether, routinely found by physics experiments to exist and to exhibit relativistic symmetry. Confirmation of the Higgs particle, modeled as a condensation within the Higgs field, corroborates aether, although physics need not state or even include aether. Organizing regularities of \"observations\"—as in the covering law model—physicists find superfluous the quest to discover \"aether\".\n\nIn 1905, from special relativity, Einstein deduced mass–energy equivalence, particles being variant forms of distributed energy, how particles colliding at vast speed experience that energy's transformation into mass, producing heavier particles, although physicists' talk promotes confusion. As \"the contemporary locus of metaphysical research\", QFTs pose particles not as existing individually, yet as \"excitation modes\" of fields, the particles and their masses being states of aether, apparently unifying all physical phenomena as the more fundamental causal reality, as long ago foreseen. Yet a \"quantum\" field is an intricate abstraction—a \"mathematical\" field—virtually inconceivable as a \"classical\" field's physical properties. Nature's deeper aspects, still unknown, might elude any possible field theory.\n\nThough discovery of causality is popularly thought science's aim, search for it was shunned by the Newtonian research program, even more Newtonian than was Isaac Newton. By now, most theoretical physicists infer that the four, known fundamental interactions would reduce to superstring theory, whereby atoms and molecules, after all, are energy vibrations holding mathematical, geometric forms. Given uncertainties of scientific realism, some conclude that the concept \"causality\" raises comprehensibility of scientific explanation and thus is key folk science, but compromises precision of scientific explanation and is dropped as a science matures. Even epidemiology is maturing to heed the severe difficulties with presumptions about causality. Covering law model is among Carl G Hempel's admired contributions to philosophy of science.\n\nTypes of inference\n\nRelated subjects\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1845685", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1845685", "title": "German Catholics (sect)", "text": "German Catholics (sect)\n\nThe German Catholics () were a schismatic sect formed in December 1844 by German dissidents from the Roman Catholic Church, under the leadership of Johannes Ronge. The movement originated in Breslau (now Wrocław). They were joined for a time by somewhat more conservative dissidents under the leadership of Johannes Czerski. This latter movement took the name of Christian Catholics and originated in Schneidemühl (now Piła).\n\nIn the 15 October 1844 issue of the \"Sächsische Vaterlandsblätter\", Johannes Ronge, a Roman Catholic priest in Silesia, published a vigorous attack upon Wilhelm Arnoldi, bishop of Trier since 1842, for having ordered (for the first time since 1810) the exposition of the alleged seamless robe of Jesus, an event that drew countless pilgrims to the cathedral. Bishop Arnoldi had proclaimed that the artifact had healing powers, and accompanied the exhibition of the holy coat by a promise of plenary indulgence to whoever should make a pilgrimage to Trier to honor it. Ronge denounced the projected pilgrimages as idolatry.\n\nRonge, who had formerly been chaplain at Grottkau, was then a schoolmaster at Laurahütte. He had already been suspended from his charge on account of his independent views. Ronge's article made a great sensation, and led to his excommunication by the chapter of Breslau in December 1844. The ex-priest received much public sympathy, and a dissenting congregation calling itself the \"New Catholics\" was soon formed at Breslau. They were later forced to change their name from \"New Catholics\" to \"German Catholics\".\n\nWithin less than a year, the German Catholics grew to over 8,000 members. Communities were formed at Leipzig, Dresden, Berlin, Offenbach am Main, Worms, Wiesbaden and several other locations. The movement garnered support from Robert Blum, a newspaper publisher in Leipzig. Blum published writings of the new movement and helped to organize it. Magdeburg was also prominent among the towns where congregations belonging to the new body were formed. There an instructor named Kote was a prominent worker.\n\nEven before the beginning of the agitation led by Ronge, another movement fundamentally distinct, though in some respects similar, had been originated at Schneidemuhl, Posen, under the guidance of Johannes Czerski, also a priest, who had come into collision with the church authorities on the then much discussed question of mixed marriages, and also on that of the celibacy of the clergy. The result had been his suspension from office in March 1844; his public withdrawal, along with twenty-four adherents, from the Roman communion in August; his excommunication; and the formation, in October, of a \"Christian Catholic\" congregation which, while rejecting clerical celibacy, the use of Latin in public worship, and the doctrines of purgatory and transubstantiation, retained the Nicene theology and the doctrine of the seven sacraments. Together Ronge and Czerski appealed to the lower grades of the clergy to unite in founding a National German Church independent of the Pope and governed by councils and synods.\n\nA council convened at Leipzig at Easter (March) 1845 to deliberate on the affairs of the body. Twenty-seven congregations were represented by delegates, of whom only two or at most three were in clerical orders. The council proceeded under the presidency of Professor Wigard to arrange a system of doctrine and practice which was to form the basis of union for the whole Church. The Bible was recognized as the sole standard of faith and its interpretation was left to reason, “penetrated and animated” by the Christian idea. Only two sacraments were admitted: baptism and the Lord's Supper. In matters of ritual, each congregation was left free to carry into practice its own views. Each congregation was to choose its own pastor and elders. Affairs of a general interest were entrusted to the management of a general council to meet every five years, but the decisions of this council were to be ratified by a majority of the congregations before they came valid. The authority of the Pope was not recognized.\n\nThe constitution of the new Church was thus democratic and Protestant, but in some respects the German Catholics went even further than the majority of Protestants in a liberal direction, inasmuch as they claimed for all complete religious liberty and declared their religion to be capable of development and modification with the progress of the human mind.\n\nThe confession of sins, indulgences, canonization and invocation of saints, use of the Latin language in divine service, prohibition of mixed marriages, the hierarchy of the clergy and the celibacy of the priests were abolished. Nothing was declared either for or against the subject of purgatory.\n\nCzerski was at some of the sittings of the council of Leipzig, but when a formula somewhat similar to that of Breslau had been adopted, he refused his signature because the divinity of Christ had been ignored, and he and his congregation continued to retain by preference the name of \"Christian Catholics\", which they had originally assumed.\n\nGerman Catholics adhered to a very simple creed, in which the chief beliefs were:\n\n\nMany of the German Catholics were involved in politics. Ronge himself was a foremost figure in the troubles of 1848.\n\nIn Austria, and ultimately also in Bavaria, the use of the name \"German Catholic\" was officially prohibited, with that of \"dissidents\" being substituted, while in Prussia, Baden and Saxony the adherents of the new creed were put under various disabilities, being suspected of both undermining religion and encouraging the revolutionary tendencies of the age.\n\nA second council in Leipzig, which met in May 1850, had to be transferred to Köthen on account of the interference of the police. It proposed an alliance with the Free Congregations, which had formed themselves by secession from the Protestant churches, and the election of a joint executive committee from both denominations, which was to act as a presiding board until the meeting of a triennial diet, which was appointed for 1852, but it did not meet. In June 1859, the representatives of the German Catholics and Free Congregations met at Gotha, where a union between the two parties was effected under the name of \"Bund freireligiöser Gemeinden\" (Confederation of free religious congregations). It was proposed that the confederation admit all free Protestant and even Jewish congregations.\n\nLegislation in the different states had become more tolerant, and the carrying out of the scheme of the council of Gotha seemed to be at least practicable. But the result proved otherwise. The confederation consisted of too heterogeneous elements. While some of the members receding further and further from orthodoxy proclaimed simple design as their religion and abolished baptism and the Lord's Supper, others on the contrary lost themselves in an exaggerated mysticism.\n\nMany of the congregations which were formed in 1844 and the years immediately following dissolved, including that of Schneidemühl itself, which ceased to exist in 1857. The majority of the German Catholics joined the national Protestant church. As of 1911, there were only about two thousand strict German Catholics, all in Saxony. The movement was superseded by the Old Catholic Church.\n\n\n\n"}

A childlike stalker calling himself \"The Avenger\" witnesses the incident and, enraged, begins to track down each culprit.\n\nCharacters in \"We All Fall Down\" are Jane Jerome, Buddy Walker, and The Avenger. After the vandalism, the book separates into three discrete storylines: one from Jane's point of view, which reveals how she and her family feel after the trashing; one from Buddy's point of view, which reveals his problems, family, and friends; and one from the Avenger's point of view, which reveals his cruel past and plans and cares.\n\nIn the novel, Jane Jerome, 16, is one of the main characters. She goes to high school and lives with her parents, her younger sister, Karen, and her younger brother, Artie, in a small town named Burnside.\n\nAfter the trashing early in the novel, Jane feels bad about arguing with her sister. A lot of thoughts come to her about her relationship with Karen. The incident in the house and Karen's coma make Jane’s behaviour change. She feels less comfortable in her home. Then she goes out with Buddy Walker. She allows him to kiss her, hug her, and caress her. She thinks that when she is with Buddy everything is wonderful and her troubles go away.\n\nBuddy Walker, 16, changes after his family has been broken into. In the beginning, he trashes the house of Jane Jerome and watches silently as Jane's sister Karen is assaulted and finally thrown down the stairs to the cellar, which results in a coma. Later on in the story, he starts noticing Jane and begins to fall for her and fills the empty hole with the love for Jane.\n\nHowever, while desperately trying to cope with the incident of his father moving out and him not telling Jane about the trashing, Buddy struggles to find comfort and support. For some time, it seems as though Buddy finds these things in groups of individuals, but they do not offer Walker true companionship. They instead offer him the temptation and consolation found with alcohol.\n\nMickey \"Looney\" or Mickey Stallings, a middle-aged man, has killed a bully at school and his grandfather. He is portrayed as 11 most of the story, until he abducts Jane Jerome. It is then revealed that Mickey committed those crimes 30 years ago and is planning to kill Jane for dating Buddy. He commits suicide at the end of the book as he is about to murder Jane.\n\nBecause of its frank language and adult themes, it is named one of the top 100 most challenged books from 1990 to 2000, by the American Library Association, and has been banned from some libraries. In 2003, it was in the top 10 most challenged books reported to the Office for Intellectual Freedom.\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding this novel, \"We All Fall Down\" received positive reviews from School Library Journal, The Horn Book Magazine, Kirkus Reviews, and Publishers Weekly.\n\nIn 1988, a parent in Simcoe County (ON) complained to their children’s school board about \"We All Fall Down\", because she believed the violence in the novel was inappropriate for children to read in school. The school board moved the novel from the primary schools to the high schools in that district, though the parent remained unsatisfied.\n\nIn November 2000, parents in Tamaqua, Pennsylvania, complained about \"We all Fall Down\" because of the violence in several scenes, as well as the description of suicide in the book. Officials in the school district created a new book selection policy in response to the parents' objections.\n\nIn March 2000, \"We All Fall Down\" was removed from the Carver Middle School in Leesburg, Florida, because parents of a sixth-grader who was studying the book were unhappy with the language used in the novel. The father of the student, said, “It’s not a book for school. It’s everything negative about society, like rape, vulgarity, alcohol abuse, murder and how to cover it up.” The principal of the middle school agreed, and the book was removed from the school library. The principal also held a faculty meeting to advise staff to look carefully at the books they are assigning to children. The principal even contacted other middle schools in the district to warn them of the challenged novel.\n\nOn March 17, 2000, an Arlington (Texas) Independent School District Superintendent ordered the library circulation of \"We All Fall Down\" to be restricted, requiring students to bring written permission from their parents in order to borrow it. The superintendent did this in response to a complaint from a parent regarding violence in the book. The book was not removed completely, because a panel of school librarians made a decision to retain it in middle and high schools.\n\nIn 1994, \"We All Fall Down\" won the California Young Reader Medal.\n"}

{"id": "1845708", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1845708", "title": "Variable-frequency drive", "text": "Variable-frequency drive\n\nA variable-frequency drive (VFD) or adjustable-frequency drive (AFD), variable-voltage/variable-frequency (VVVF) drive, variable speed drive (VSD), AC drive, micro drive or inverter drive is a type of adjustable-speed drive used in electro-mechanical drive systems to control AC motor speed and torque by varying motor input frequency and voltage.\n\nVFDs are used in applications ranging from small appliances to large compressors. About 25% of the world's electrical energy is consumed by electric motors in industrial applications. Systems using VFDs can be more efficient than those using throttling control of fluid flow, such as in systems with pumps and damper control for fans. However, the global market penetration for all applications of VFDs is relatively small. \nOver the last four decades, power electronics technology has reduced VFD cost and size and has improved performance through advances in semiconductor switching devices, drive topologies, simulation and control techniques, and control hardware and software.\n\nVFDs are made in a number of different low- and medium-voltage AC-AC and DC-AC topologies.\n\nA variable-frequency drive is a device used in a drive system consisting of the following three main sub-systems: AC motor, main drive controller assembly, and drive/operator interface.\n\nThe AC electric motor used in a VFD system is usually a three-phase induction motor. Some types of single-phase motors or synchronous motors can be advantageous in some situations, but generally three-phase induction motors are preferred as the most economical. Motors that are designed for fixed-speed operation are often used. Elevated-voltage stresses imposed on induction motors that are supplied by VFDs require that such motors be designed for definite-purpose inverter-fed duty in accordance with such requirements as Part 31 of NEMA Standard MG-1.\n\nThe VFD controller is a solid-state power electronics conversion system consisting of three distinct sub-systems: a rectifier bridge converter, a direct current (DC) link, and an inverter. Voltage-source inverter (VSI) drives (see 'Generic topologies' sub-section below) are by far the most common type of drives. Most drives are AC-AC drives in that they convert AC line input to AC inverter output. However, in some applications such as common DC bus or solar applications, drives are configured as DC-AC drives. The most basic rectifier converter for the VSI drive is configured as a three-phase, six-pulse, full-wave diode bridge. In a VSI drive, the DC link consists of a capacitor which smooths out the converter's DC output ripple and provides a stiff input to the inverter. This filtered DC voltage is converted to quasi-sinusoidal AC voltage output using the inverter's active switching elements. VSI drives provide higher power factor and lower harmonic distortion than phase-controlled current-source inverter (CSI) and load-commutated inverter (LCI) drives (see 'Generic topologies' sub-section below). The drive controller can also be configured as a phase converter having single-phase converter input and three-phase inverter output.\n\nController advances have exploited dramatic increases in the voltage and current ratings and switching frequency of solid-state power devices over the past six decades. Introduced in 1983, the insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) has in the past two decades come to dominate VFDs as an inverter switching device.\n\nIn variable-torque applications suited for Volts-per-Hertz (V/Hz) drive control, AC motor characteristics require that the voltage magnitude of the inverter's output to the motor be adjusted to match the required load torque in a linear V/Hz relationship. For example, for 460 V, 60 Hz motors, this linear V/Hz relationship is 460/60 = 7.67 V/Hz. While suitable in wide-ranging applications, V/Hz control is sub-optimal in high-performance applications involving low speed or demanding, dynamic speed regulation, positioning, and reversing load requirements. Some V/Hz control drives can also operate in quadratic V/Hz mode or can even be programmed to suit special multi-point V/Hz paths.\n\nThe two other drive control platforms, vector control and direct torque control (DTC), adjust the motor voltage magnitude, angle from reference, and frequency so as to precisely control the motor's magnetic flux and mechanical torque.\n\nAlthough space vector pulse-width modulation (SVPWM) is becoming increasingly popular, sinusoidal PWM (SPWM) is the most straightforward method used to vary drives' motor voltage (or current) and frequency. With SPWM control (see Fig. 1), quasi-sinusoidal, variable-pulse-width output is constructed from intersections of a saw-toothed carrier signal with a modulating sinusoidal signal which is variable in operating frequency as well as in voltage (or current).\n\nOperation of the motors above rated nameplate speed (base speed) is possible, but is limited to conditions that do not require more power than the nameplate rating of the motor. This is sometimes called \"field weakening\" and, for AC motors, means operating at less than rated V/Hz and above rated nameplate speed. Permanent magnet synchronous motors have quite limited field-weakening speed range due to the constant magnet flux linkage. Wound-rotor synchronous motors and induction motors have much wider speed range. For example, a 100 HP, 460 V, 60 Hz, 1775 RPM (4-pole) induction motor supplied with 460 V, 75 Hz (6.134 V/Hz), would be limited to 60/75 = 80% torque at 125% speed (2218.75 RPM) = 100% power. At higher speeds, the induction motor torque has to be limited further due to the lowering of the breakaway torque of the motor. Thus, rated power can be typically produced only up to 130-150% of the rated nameplate speed. Wound-rotor synchronous motors can be run at even higher speeds. In rolling mill drives, often 200-300% of the base speed is used. The mechanical strength of the rotor limits the maximum speed of the motor.\n\nAn embedded microprocessor governs the overall operation of the VFD controller. Basic programming of the microprocessor is provided as user-inaccessible firmware. User programming of display, variable, and function block parameters is provided to control, protect, and monitor the VFD, motor, and driven equipment.\n\nThe basic drive controller can be configured to selectively include such optional power components and accessories as follows: \n\nThe operator interface provides a means for an operator to start and stop the motor and adjust the operating speed. The VFD may also be controlled by a programmable logic controller through Modbus or another similar interface. Additional operator control functions might include reversing, and switching between manual speed adjustment and automatic control from an external process control signal. The operator interface often includes an alphanumeric display or indication lights and meters to provide information about the operation of the drive. An operator interface keypad and display unit is often provided on the front of the VFD controller as shown in the photograph above. The keypad display can often be cable-connected and mounted a short distance from the VFD controller. Most are also provided with input and output (I/O) terminals for connecting push buttons, switches, and other operator interface devices or control signals. A serial communications port is also often available to allow the VFD to be configured, adjusted, monitored, and controlled using a computer.\n\nThere are two main ways to control the speed of a VFD; networked or hardwired. Networked involves transmitting the intended speed over a communication protocol such as Modbus, Modbus/TCP, EtherNet/IP, or via a keypad using Display Serial Interface while hardwired involves a pure electrical means of communication. Typical means of hardwired communication are: 4-20mA, 0-10VDC, or using the internal 24VDC power supply with a potentiometer. Speed can also be controlled remotely and locally. Remote control instructs the VFD to ignore speed commands from the keypad while local control instructs the VFD to ignore external control and only abide by the keypad. On some drives the same pins are used for both 0-10VDC and 4-20mA and are selected via a jumper.\n\nDepending on the model a VFD's operating parameters can be programmed via: dedicated programming software, internal keypad, external keypad, or SD card. VFDs will often block out most programming changes while running. Typical parameters that need to be set include: motor nameplate information, speed reference source,on/off control source and braking control. It is also common for VFDs to provide debugging information such as fault codes and the states of the input signals.\n\nMost VFDs allow auto-starting to be enabled. Which will drive the output to a designated frequency after a power cycle, or after a fault has been cleared, or after the emergency stop signal has been restored (generally emergency stops are active low logic). One popular way to control a VFD is to enable auto-start and place L1, L2, and L3 into a contactor. Powering on the contactor thus turns on the drive and has it output to a designated speed. Depending on the sophistication of the drive multiple auto-starting behavior can be developed e.g. the drive auto-starts on power up but does not auto-start from clearing an emergency stop until a reset has been cycled.\n\nReferring to the accompanying chart, drive applications can be categorized as single-quadrant, two-quadrant, or four-quadrant; the chart's four quadrants are defined as follows: \n\nMost applications involve single-quadrant loads operating in quadrant I, such as in variable-torque (e.g. centrifugal pumps or fans) and certain constant-torque (e.g. extruders) loads.\n\nCertain applications involve two-quadrant loads operating in quadrant I and II where the speed is positive but the torque changes polarity as in case of a fan decelerating faster than natural mechanical losses. Some sources define two-quadrant drives as loads operating in quadrants I and III where the speed and torque is same (positive or negative) polarity in both directions.\n\nCertain high-performance applications involve four-quadrant loads (Quadrants I to IV) where the speed and torque can be in any direction such as in hoists, elevators, and hilly conveyors. Regeneration can occur only in the drive's DC link bus when inverter voltage is smaller in magnitude than the motor back-EMF and inverter voltage and back-EMF are the same polarity.\n\nIn starting a motor, a VFD initially applies a low frequency and voltage, thus avoiding high inrush current associated with direct-on-line starting. After the start of the VFD, the applied frequency and voltage are increased at a controlled rate or ramped up to accelerate the load. This starting method typically allows a motor to develop 150% of its rated torque while the VFD is drawing less than 50% of its rated current from the mains in the low-speed range. A VFD can be adjusted to produce a steady 150% starting torque from standstill right up to full speed. However, motor cooling deteriorates and can result in overheating as speed decreases such that prolonged low-speed operation with significant torque is not usually possible without separately motorized fan ventilation.\n\nWith a VFD, the stopping sequence is just the opposite as the starting sequence. The frequency and voltage applied to the motor are ramped down at a controlled rate. When the frequency approaches zero, the motor is shut off. A small amount of braking torque is available to help decelerate the load a little faster than it would stop if the motor were simply switched off and allowed to coast. Additional braking torque can be obtained by adding a braking circuit (resistor controlled by a transistor) to dissipate the braking energy. With a four-quadrant rectifier (active front-end), the VFD is able to brake the load by applying a reverse torque and injecting the energy back to the AC line.\n\nMany fixed-speed motor load applications that are supplied direct from AC line power can save energy when they are operated at variable speed by means of VFD. Such energy cost savings are especially pronounced in variable-torque centrifugal fan and pump applications, where the load's torque and power vary with the square and cube, respectively, of the speed. This change gives a large power reduction compared to fixed-speed operation for a relatively small reduction in speed. For example, at 63% speed a motor load consumes only 25% of its full-speed power. This reduction is in accordance with affinity laws that define the relationship between various centrifugal load variables.\n\nIn the United States, an estimated 60-65% of electrical energy is used to supply motors, 75% of which are variable-torque fan, pump, and compressor loads. Eighteen percent of the energy used in the 40 million motors in the U.S. could be saved by efficient energy improvement technologies such as VFDs.\n\nOnly about 3% of the total installed base of AC motors are provided with AC drives. However, it is estimated that drive technology is adopted in as many as 30-40% of all newly installed motors.<ref name=\"Motoring Ahead 1/11\"></ref>\n\nAn energy consumption breakdown of the global population of AC motor installations is as shown in the following table:\n\nAC drives are used to bring about process and quality improvements in industrial and commercial applications' acceleration, flow, monitoring, pressure, speed, temperature, tension, and torque.\n\nFixed-speed loads subject the motor to a high starting torque and to current surges that are up to eight times the full-load current. AC drives instead gradually ramp the motor up to operating speed to lessen mechanical and electrical stress, reducing maintenance and repair costs, and extending the life of the motor and the driven equipment.\n\nVariable-speed drives can also run a motor in specialized patterns to further minimize mechanical and electrical stress. For example, an S-curve pattern can be applied to a conveyor application for smoother deceleration and acceleration control, which reduces the backlash that can occur when a conveyor is accelerating or decelerating.\n\nPerformance factors tending to favor the use of DC drives over AC drives include such requirements as continuous operation at low speed, four-quadrant operation with regeneration, frequent acceleration and deceleration routines, and need for the motor to be protected for a hazardous area. The following table compares AC and DC drives according to certain key parameters: \n^ High-frequency injection\n\nAC drives can be classified according to the following generic topologies: \n\nMost drives use one or more of the following control platforms:\n\nVariable-frequency drives are also categorized by the following load torque and power characteristics:\n\nVFDs are available with voltage and current ratings covering a wide range of single-phase and multi-phase AC motors. Low-voltage (LV) drives are designed to operate at output voltages equal to or less than 690 V. While motor-application LV drives are available in ratings of up to the order of 5 or 6 MW, economic considerations typically favor medium-voltage (MV) drives with much lower power ratings. Different MV drive topologies (see Table 2) are configured in accordance with the voltage/current-combination ratings used in different drive controllers' switching devices such that any given voltage rating is greater than or equal to one to the following standard nominal motor voltage ratings: generally either .16 kV (60 Hz) or .6 kV (50 Hz), with one thyristor manufacturer rated for up to 12 kV switching. In some applications a step-up transformer is placed between a LV drive and a MV motor load. MV drives are typically rated for motor applications greater than between about . MV drives have historically required considerably more application design effort than required for LV drive applications. The power rating of MV drives can reach , a range of different drive topologies being involved for different rating, performance, power quality, and reliability requirements.\n\nIt is lastly useful to relate VFDs in terms of the following two classifications:\n\nNote of clarification:.\n\nWhile harmonics in the PWM output can easily be filtered by carrier-frequency-related filter inductance to supply near-sinusoidal currents to the motor load, the VFD's diode-bridge rectifier converts AC line voltage to DC voltage output by super-imposing non-linear half-phase current pulses thus creating harmonic current distortion, and hence voltage distortion, of the AC line input. When the VFD loads are relatively small in comparison to the large, stiff power system available from the electric power company, the effects of VFD harmonic distortion of the AC grid can often be within acceptable limits. Furthermore, in low-voltage networks, harmonics caused by single-phase equipment such as computers and TVs are partially cancelled by three-phase diode bridge harmonics because their 5th and 7th harmonics are in counterphase. However, when the proportion of VFD and other non-linear load compared to total load or of non-linear load compared to the stiffness at the AC power supply, or both, is relatively large enough, the load can have a negative impact on the AC power waveform available to other power company customers in the same grid.\n\nWhen the power company's voltage becomes distorted due to harmonics, losses in other loads such as normal fixed-speed AC motors are increased. This condition may lead to overheating and shorter operating life. Also, substation transformers and compensation capacitors are affected negatively. In particular, capacitors can cause resonance conditions that can unacceptably magnify harmonic levels. In order to limit the voltage distortion, owners of VFD load may be required to install filtering equipment to reduce harmonic distortion below acceptable limits. Alternatively, the utility may adopt a solution by installing filtering equipment of its own at substations affected by the large amount of VFD equipment being used. In high-power installations, harmonic distortion can be reduced by supplying multi-pulse rectifier-bridge VFDs from transformers with multiple phase-shifted windings.\n\nIt is also possible to replace the standard diode-bridge rectifier with a bi-directional IGBT switching device bridge mirroring the standard inverter which uses IGBT switching device output to the motor. Such rectifiers are referred to by various designations including active infeed converter (AIC), active rectifier, IGBT supply unit (ISU), active front end (AFE), or four-quadrant operation. With PWM control and a suitable input reactor, an AFE's AC line current waveform can be nearly sinusoidal. AFE inherently regenerates energy in four-quadrant mode from the DC side to the AC grid. Thus, no braking resistor is needed, and the efficiency of the drive is improved if the drive is frequently required to brake the motor.\n\nTwo other harmonics mitigation techniques exploit use of passive or active filters connected to a common bus with at least one VFD branch load on the bus. Passive filters involve the design of one or more low-pass LC filter traps, each trap being tuned as required to a harmonic frequency (5th, 7th, 11th, 13th, . . . kq+/-1, where k=integer, q=pulse number of converter).\n\nIt is very common practice for power companies or their customers to impose harmonic distortion limits based on IEC or IEEE standards. For example, IEEE Standard 519 limits at the customer's connection point call for the maximum individual frequency voltage harmonic to be no more than 3% of the fundamental and call for the voltage total harmonic distortion (THD) to be no more than 5% for a general AC power supply system.\n\nOne drive uses a default switching frequency setting of 4 kHz. Reducing the drive's switching frequency (the carrier-frequency) reduces the heat generated by the IGBTs.\n\nA carrier frequency of at least ten times the desired output frequency is used to establish the PWM switching intervals. A carrier frequency in the range of 2,000 to 16,000 Hz is common for LV [low voltage, under 600 Volts AC] VFDs. A higher carrier frequency produces a better sine wave approximation but incurs higher switching losses in the IGBT, decreasing the overall power conversion efficiency.\n\nSome drives have a noise smoothing feature that can be turned on to introduce a random variation to the switching frequency. This distributes the acoustic noise over a range of frequencies to lower the peak noise intensity.\n\nThe carrier-frequency pulsed output voltage of a PWM VFD causes rapid rise times in these pulses, the transmission line effects of which must be considered. Since the transmission-line impedance of the cable and motor are different, pulses tend to reflect back from the motor terminals into the cable. The resulting reflections can produce overvoltages equal to twice the DC bus voltage or up to 3.1 times the rated line voltage for long cable runs, putting high stress on the cable and motor windings, and eventual insulation failure. Insulation standards for three-phase motors rated 230 V or less adequately protect against such long-lead overvoltages. On 460 V or 575 V systems and inverters with 3rd-generation 0.1-microsecond-rise-time IGBTs, the maximum recommended cable distance between VFD and motor is about 50 m or 150 feet. For emerging SiC MOSFET powered drives, significant overvoltages have been observed at cable lengths as short as 3 meters. Solutions to overvoltages caused by long lead lengths include minimizing cable length, lowering carrier frequency, installing dV/dt filters, using inverter-duty-rated motors (that are rated 600 V to withstand pulse trains with rise time less than or equal to 0.1 microsecond, of 1,600 V peak magnitude), and installing LCR low-pass sine wave filters. Selection of optimum PWM carrier frequency for AC drives involves balancing noise, heat, motor insulation stress, common-mode voltage-induced motor bearing current damage, smooth motor operation, and other factors. Further harmonics attenuation can be obtained by using an LCR low-pass sine wave filter or dV/dt filter.\n\nCarrier frequencies above 5 kHz are likely to cause bearing damage unless protective measures are taken.\n\nPWM drives are inherently associated with high-frequency common-mode voltages and currents which may cause trouble with motor bearings. When these high-frequency voltages find a path to earth through a bearing, transfer of metal or electrical discharge machining (EDM) sparking occurs between the bearing's ball and the bearing's race. Over time, EDM-based sparking causes erosion in the bearing race that can be seen as a fluting pattern. In large motors, the stray capacitance of the windings provides paths for high-frequency currents that pass through the motor shaft ends, leading to a circulating type of bearing current. Poor grounding of motor stators can lead to shaft-to-ground bearing currents. Small motors with poorly grounded driven equipment are susceptible to high-frequency bearing currents.\n\nPrevention of high-frequency bearing current damage uses three approaches: good cabling and grounding practices, interruption of bearing currents, and filtering or damping of common-mode currents for example through soft magnetic cores, the so-called inductive absorbers. Good cabling and grounding practices can include use of shielded, symmetrical-geometry power cable to supply the motor, installation of shaft grounding brushes, and conductive bearing grease. Bearing currents can be interrupted by installation of insulated bearings and specially designed electrostatic-shielded induction motors. Filtering and damping high-frequency bearing can be done though inserting soft magnetic cores over the three phases giving a high frequency impedance against the common mode or motor bearing currents. Another approach is to use instead of standard 2-level inverter drives, using either 3-level inverter drives or matrix converters.\n\nSince inverter-fed motor cables' high-frequency current spikes can interfere with other cabling in facilities, such inverter-fed motor cables should not only be of shielded, symmetrical-geometry design but should also be routed at least 50 cm away from signal cables.\n\nTorque generated by the drive causes the induction motor to run at synchronous speed less the slip. If the load drives the motor faster than synchronous speed, the motor acts as a generator, converting mechanical power back to electrical power. This power is returned to the drive's DC link element (capacitor or reactor). A DC-link-connected electronic power switch or braking DC chopper controls dissipation of this power as heat in a set of resistors. Cooling fans may be used to prevent resistor overheating.\n\nDynamic braking wastes braking energy by transforming it to heat. By contrast, regenerative drives recover braking energy by injecting this energy into the AC line. The capital cost of regenerative drives is, however, relatively high.\n\nRegenerative AC drives have the capacity to recover the braking energy of a load moving faster than the designated motor speed (an \"overhauling\" load) and return it to the power system.\n\nCycloconverter, Scherbius, matrix, CSI, and LCI drives inherently allow return of energy from the load to the line, while voltage-source inverters require an additional converter to return energy to the supply.\n\nRegeneration is useful in VFDs only where the value of the recovered energy is large compared to the extra cost of a regenerative system, and if the system requires frequent braking and starting. Regenerative VFDs are widely used where speed control of overhauling loads is required.\nSome examples:\n\nBefore solid-state devices became available, variable-frequency drives used rotary machines and the General Electric Company obtained several patents for these in the early 20th century. One example is of 1910 which states: \"Such a generator finds a useful application in supplying current to induction motors for driving cars, locomotives, or other mechanism which are to be driven at variable speeds\". Another is British patent 7061 of 1911 by Brown, Boveri & Cie., now known as ABB.\n"}

Different countries also used differing encodings at various times: during the 1800s American Braille competed with English Braille, in the War of the Dots. As a result of the expanding need to represent technical symbolism, and divergence during the past 100 years across countries, braille users who desired to read or write a large range of material have needed to learn different sets of rules, depending on what kind of material they were reading at a given time. Rules for a particular type of material were often not compatible from one system to the next (the rule-sets for literary/mathematical/computerized encoding-areas were sometimes conflicting—and of course differing approaches to encoding mathematics were not compatible with each other), so the reader would need to be notified as the text in a book moved from computer braille code for programming to Nemeth Code for mathematics to standard literary braille. Moreover, the braille rule-set used for math and computer science topics, and even to an extent braille for literary purposes, differed among various English-speaking countries.\n\nUnified English Braille is intended to develop one set of rules, the same everywhere in the world, which could be applied across various types of English-language material. The notable exception to this unification is Music Braille, which UEB specifically does not encompass, because it is already well-standardized internationally. Unified English Braille is designed to be readily understood by people familiar with the literary braille (used in standard prose writing), while also including support for specialized math and science symbols, computer-related symbols (the @ sign as well as more specialised programming-language syntax), foreign alphabets, and visual effects (bullets, bold type, accent marks, and so on).\n\nAccording to the original 1991 specification for UEB, the goals were:\n\nSome goals were specially and explicitly called out as key objectives, not all of which are mentioned above:\n\nGoals that were specifically not part of the UEB upgrade process were the ability to handle languages outside the Roman alphabet (cf. the various national variants of ASCII in the ISO 8859 series versus the modern pan-universal Unicode standard, which governs how writing systems are encoded for computerized use).\n\nWork on UEB formally began in 1991, and preliminary draft standard was published in March 1995 (as UBC), then upgraded several times thereafter. Unified English Braille (UEB) was originally known as Unified Braille Code (UBC), with the English-specific nature being implied, but later the word \"English\" was formally incorporated into its name—Unified English Braille Code (UEBC)—and still more recently it has come to be called Unified English Braille (UEB). On April 2, 2004, the International Council on English Braille (ICEB) gave the go-ahead for the unification of various English braille codes. This decision was reached following 13 years of analysis, research, and debate. ICEB said that Unified English Braille was sufficiently complete for recognition as an international standard for English braille, which the seven ICEB member-countries could consider for adoption as their national code. South Africa adopted the UEB almost immediately (in May 2004). During the following year, the standard was adopted by Nigeria (February 5, 2005), Australia (May 14, 2005), and New Zealand (November 2005). On April 24, 2010, the Canadian Braille Authority (CBA) voted to adopt UEB, making Canada the fifth nation to adopt UEB officially. On October 21, 2011, the UK Association for Accessible Formats voted to adopt UEB as the preferred code in the UK. On November 2, 2012 the Braille Authority of North America (BANA) became the sixth of the seven member-countries of the ICEB to officially adopt the UEB.\n\nThe major criticism against UEB is that it fails to handle mathematics or computer science as compactly as codes designed to be optimal for those disciplines. Besides requiring more space to represent and more time to read and write, the verbosity of UEB can make learning mathematics more difficult. Nemeth Braille, officially used in the United States since 1952, and as of 2002 the de facto standard for teaching and doing mathematics in braille in the US, was specifically invented to correct the cumbersomeness of doing mathematics in braille. However, although the Nemeth encoding standard was officially adopted by the JUTC of the US and the UK in the 1950s, in practice only the USA switched their mathematical braille to the Nemeth system, whereas the UK continued to use the traditional Henry Martyn Taylor coding (not to be confused with Hudson Taylor who was involved with the use of Moon Type for the blind in China during the 1800s) for their braille mathematics. Programmers in the United States who write their programming codefiles in braille—as opposed to in ASCII text with use of a screenreader for example—tend to use Nemeth-syntax numerals, whereas programmers in the UK use yet another system (not Taylor-numerals and not literary-numerals). The key difference of Nemeth Braille compared to Taylor (and UEB which uses an upgraded version of the Taylor encoding for math) is that Nemeth uses \"down-shifted\" numerals from the fifth decade of the Braille alphabet (overwriting various punctuation characters), whereas UEB/Taylor uses the traditional 1800s approach with \"up-shifted\" numerals from the first decade of the (English) Braille alphabet (overwriting the first ten letters, namely ABCDEFGHIJ). Traditional 1800s Braille, and also UEB, require insertion of numeral-prefixes when speaking of numerals, which makes representing some mathematical equations 42% more verbose. As an alternative to UEB, there were proposals in 2001 and 2009, and most recently these were the subject of various technical workshops during 2012. Although UEB adopts some features of Nemeth, the final version of UEB mandates up-shifted numerals, which are the heart of the controversy. According to BANA, which adopted UEB in 2012, the official braille codes for the USA will be UEB and Nemeth Braille (as well as Music Braille for vocals and instrumentals plus IPA Braille for phonetic linguistics), despite the use of contradictory representation of numerals and arithmetical symbols in the UEB and Nemeth encodings. Thus, although UEB has officially been adopted in most English-speaking ICEB member-countries, in the USA (and possibly the UK where UEB is only the \"preferred\" system) the new encoding is not to be the sole encoding.\n\nAnother proposed braille-notation for encoding math is GS8/GS6, which was specifically invented in the early 1990s as an attempt to get rid of the \"up-shifted\" numerals used in UEB—see Gardner–Salinas Braille. GS6 implements \"extra-dot\" numerals from the fourth decade of the English Braille alphabet (overwriting various two-letter ligatures). GS8 expands the braille-cell from 2×3 dots to 2×4 dots, quadrupling the available codepoints from the traditional 64 up to 256, but in GS8 the numerals are still represented in the same way as in GS6 (albeit with a couple unused dot-positions at the bottom).\n\nAttempts to give the numerals their own distinct position in Braille are not new: the original 1829 specification by Louis Braille gave the numerals their own distinct symbols, with the modern digraph-based literary-braille approach mentioned as an optional fallback. However, after trying the system out in the classroom, the dashes used in the numerals—as well as several other rows of special characters—were found to be too difficult to distinguish from dot-pairs, and thus the typical digraph-based numerals became the official standard in 1837.\n\nAs of 2013, with the majority of English-speaking ICEB member-countries having officially adopted UEB, there remain barriers to implementation and deployment. Besides ICEB member-nations, there are also many other countries with blind citizens that teach and use English: India, Hong Kong/China, Pakistan, the Philippines, and so on. Many of these countries use non-UEB math notation, for English-speaking countries specifically, versions of the Nemeth Code were widespread by 1990 (in the United States, Western Samoa, Canada including Quebec, New Zealand, Israel, Greece, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Cambodia, Vietnam, and Lebanon) in contrast to the similar-to-UEB-but-not-identical Taylor notation in 1990 (used by the UK, Ireland, Australia, Nigeria, Hong Kong, Jordan, Kenya, Sierra Leone, Singapore, and Zimbabwe). Some countries in the Middle East used Nemeth and Taylor math-notations as of 1990, i.e. Iran and Saudi Arabia. As of 2013, it is unclear whether the English-using blind populations of various ICEB and non-ICEB nations will move to adopt the UEB, and if so, at what rate. Beyond official adoption rates in schools and by individuals, there are other difficulties. The vast majority of existing Braille materials, both printed and electronic, are in non-UEB encodings. Furthermore, other technologies that compete with braille are now ever-more-widely affordable (screen readers for electronic-text-to-speech, plus physical-pages-to-electronic-text software combined with high-resolution digital cameras and high-speed document scanners, and the increasing ubiquity of tablets/smartphones/PDAs/PCs). The percentage of blind children who are literate in braille is already declining—and even those who know some system tend not to know UEB, since that system is still very new. Still, as of 2012 many of the original goals for UEB have already been fully or partially accomplished:\n\n\n"}

Constructed with steel and concrete, the bridge is officially named for Neil R. Underwood. Its predecessor was constructed of wood by Wallace D. Lovell and was referred to as the Mile-Long Wooden Bridge. For a time in the early 1900s, Hampton Bridge earned the title of longest bridge in the United States.\n\nThe completion of the old bridge took almost a year and according to the \"Exeter Newsletter\" of July 5, 1901, was a \"great undertaking\". Long hours of manpower went into moving materials and building it. The bridge measured in length and in width. It was supported by 3,865 wooden piles driven deep into the bottom of the river. Moving the materials used to build the bridge presented a great challenge. A tugboat named the \"H.A. Mathes\" towed rafts full of lumber to the bridge site from Portsmouth. \"Other materials were floated downstream to the bridge from the railroad station at Hampton Falls.\"\n\nThe official opening of the \"Mile-long Bridge\" was May 14, 1901. Chester B. Jordan, the governor at the time, was among many political figures who attended the opening. As the end of the era of trolley cars rolled in, automobiles took over and the wooden bridge was not effective anymore. Lovell sold the bridge to the Eastern Massachusetts Street Railway. \"By 1930, the structure began to show the strain of the years of shifting sands, ice floes and heavy traffic.\" New Hampshire was faced with making plans for a modernized structure to replace the wooden bridge. The current bridge opened in 1949.\n"}

Originally built as the New Hampshire Main Line of the Boston & Lowell Railroad and later operated as part of the Boston & Maine Railroad's Southern Division, the line was one of the first railroads in North America and the first major one in Massachusetts.\n\nAll stations are accessible except for West Medford, Winchester Center, and Mishawum.\n\nThe Boston & Lowell Railroad started freight operations in 1835, with traffic from the Lowell mills to the Boston port. Demand for the express passenger service exceeded expectations, and in 1842 local service was added as well. \nThe line north of Lowell was first owned by the Boston, Concord & Montreal Railroad, which was chartered in 1844. Trackage was completed as far as Wells River, Vermont, in 1853. The Boston & Maine Railroad (B&M) acquired the railroad in 1895. The line served as the route for Boston to Montreal service during the Golden Age of Rail (roughly 1880 to 1930). The \"Ambassador\", the train from Boston's North Station to Montreal, ran through Concord, New Hampshire, along this line until 1966. This line, along with the \"New Englander\", via Concord, White River Junction, Montpelier, ran through the northwestern section of Vermont prior to entering Quebec, Canada. The \"Alouette\" and \"Red Wing\" trains travelled to Montreal via Concord, Wells River and Newport in northeastern Vermont prior to entering Quebec. (The route via Wells River, St. Johnsbury and Newport was the more direct route of the two itineraries.) For this itinerary the Montreal route was marketed as an Air-line railroad.\n\nB&M passenger service to Boston on the line was shortened from Concord, New Hampshire to Lowell in 1967.\n\nIn 1973, the MBTA bought the Lowell line, along with the Haverhill and all other local Greater Boston passenger lines. Along with the sale, the B&M contracted to run the passenger service on the Lowell line for the MBTA. After bankruptcy, the B&M continued to run and fulfill its commuter rail contract under the protection of the United States Bankruptcy Court, in the hopes that a reorganization could make it profitable again. It emerged from the court's protection when newly formed Guilford Transportation Industries (GTI) purchased it in 1983.\n\nFor approximately thirteen months in 1980-81, daily passenger service was provided to Concord. Two round-trips were operated on each weekday and one on weekend days. Originally, there were intermediate stops in Manchester and Nashua. A stop in Merrimack was added later. Service was discontinued when federal funding was withdrawn.\n\nAnderson Regional Transportation Center opened on April 28, 2001, replacing Mishawum as the Lowell Line's primary park-and-ride station for Route 128. Mishawum was reduced to limited reverse-peak service. On December 15, 2001, the Amtrak \"Downeaster\" began operating over the line south of Wilmington. In October 2006, the MBTA added four short turn round trips that terminated at Anderson RTC.\n\nThe line was shut down on weekends in July through September 2017 for the installation of Positive Train Control equipment in order to meet a 2020 federal deadline.\n\nAs of 2011, there is a current debate over whether or not to expand the Lowell line to Nashua, New Hampshire and include stations in North Chelmsford and Tyngsborough en route, for the sake of commuters in those towns. \n\nIn October 2010, the New Hampshire Department of Transportation received a $2.24 million federal grant to study an extension of the Lowell Line to Concord. In January 2011, a bill was introduced into the New Hampshire legislature to end the proposed extension and give up a potential $4.1 million grant into its planning. The MBTA acquired trackage rights from Pan Am in May 2011 as part of a larger transaction.\n\nThe MBTA is currently building the Green Line Extension through Somerville and part of Medford. One branch of the Extension will follow the right of way of the Lowell Line into Medford. Several stations once existed along that section of the line, but none are in operation any longer.\n\nNorth of Wilmington, the line is authorized for a maximum of . South of Wilmington, the line has an unusual asymmetrical speed limit. The northbound track supports up to where curvature allows, while the southbound track has a maximum of . Additional speed restrictions are in place at Wilmington, through the grade crossings in West Medford, and in the North Station terminal area.\n\nAmtrak's \"Downeaster\" service to Maine, along with some Haverhill Line express trains, run on the Lowell Line from North Station to Wilmington, then follow the Wildcat Branch to the Haverhill Line. This routing is used to avoid the inner Haverhill Line, which has a number of single-track sections.\n\nThe line is the designated freight clearance route into Boston from the north; all stations with high-level platforms must either have mini-high platforms or a freight passing track. Pan Am Railways runs freight on the line, including local freights based out of Lawrence Yard and DOBO (a Dover to Boston through freight).\n\n"}

The stave church was originally constructed just after the year 1168, which is known through dendrochronological dating of the ore-pine used in the construction. The logs were not completely dry when the construction took place.\n\nAn archeological excavation that took place during 1978 showed that the church was built on the remains of a previous church. It is thought to have been made with the use of embedded corner column technology at the beginning of the 11th century.\n\nChurches made during the 12th century were usually very small, often no more than 40 square meters, and were therefore often expanded, even during the Middle Ages and certainly just before and after the Reformation, which took place during 1537 in Norway.\n\nThe nave of the church was first expanded to the west during the Middle Ages, when the original apse of the chancel was also removed and the chancel itself elongated. Again, during that period, an extra center column was added. The chancel was torn down again in 1684, when a new and wider chancel was made, with the same width as the nave. Then, during the period 1721–1723, the church was made into a cruciform. A new ridge turret had to be made, to fit the new shape. Later, in 1819, a new vestry was added to the north wall of the chancel.\nThe exterior walls were paneled in 1760.\nBenches with ornately decorated sidewalls were added to the nave in 1624. The oldest part of the interior was probably richly ornately decorated by painting during 1656, the expansions during 1684 and 1723. Two scary halfmasks are quite visible on the poles of the chancel, and according to myth they were able to capture demons.\n\nThe church survives today as museum piece, owned by Fortidsminneforeningen, which also happens to own several other stave churches that survive. The church was taken out of use in 1893, but services still take place during the summer season. As of June 2016, photographing of the highly decorated interior (even with flash) was allowed. In the late nineties the local internet site Numedalsnett was allowed to shoot a short interior video with minimum equipment and lightning. The video clip is available on YouTube.\n\n"}

It was the site of one of the fiercest battles of the Six-Day War. Ammunition Hill is now a national memorial site.\n\nAmmunition Hill was located west of a police academy, with a fortified trench connecting them. The site was built by the British during their Mandatory Palestine in the 1930s, and was used to store the police academy's ammunition. The Jordanian Arab Legion seized control of the hill during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, severing the link between Mount Scopus and West Jerusalem. In the wake of the 1949 Armistice Agreements, parts of Mount Scopus remained an Israeli enclave in Jordanian-held territory, with the Jordanians blocking access to Hadassah Medical Center and the campus of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem on the hilltop.\n\nThe post consisted of tens of bunkers built along the three main trench systems surrounding the hill, with fortified gun emplacements covering each trench. The living quarters for the Jordanian defenders of the hill were in a large underground bunker. At the time of the Six-Day War, the post was defended by a reinforced Jordanian company of 150 soldiers of the El-Hussein regiment (number 2).\n\nA decision was taken by the Israeli Jerusalem Command, under General Uzi Narkis, to forgo an aerial attack on the hill due to its proximity to civilian areas. Instead an artillery barrage was to be focused on the police post, followed by a ground attack using an enlarged paratroop company.\n\nThe size of the Israeli assault force was based on incorrect intelligence, which detailed the hill as being defended by a single platoon. When the ground assault began, the police academy was discovered to be empty of Jordanian troops, as they had taken shelter from the barrage in the bunker system of the hill, thereby enlarging the force defending the hill to one equal in size to the assault force rather than 1/3 of its size, as had been anticipated by Israeli Central Command.\n\nThe fighting at the police academy and Ammunition Hill began on June 6, 1967, at 2:30 AM. The task of capturing the hill was given to the Israeli 3rd Company of the 66th Battalion, of the 55th Paratroopers Brigade, and during the battle, a force of the 2nd Company joined the fighting. The battle ended at 6:30 AM, although Israeli troops remained in the trenches due to sniper fire from Givat HaMivtar until the Harel Brigade overran that outpost in the afternoon. Thirty-six Israeli soldiers and 71 Jordanians were killed in the fighting.\n\nTen of the soldiers who fought in this battle were given citations by the Israeli Chief of General Staff. The commander of the Paratroopers Brigade was Mordechai Gur. The commander of the 66th Battalion was Yossi Yafe.\n\nIn 1975, a memorial site and museum were inaugurated on the hill, preserving a part of the old post and opening a museum in the bunker. In addition, 182 olive trees were planted on the hill, commemorating the 182 Israeli soldiers who fell in the battle for Jerusalem during the Six-Day War. In 1987, the site was declared a national memorial site. The main ceremony on Yom Yerushalayim (Jerusalem Day) is held here.\n\nAn estimated 200,000 visitors tour the site each year, including 80,000 soldiers. Ammunition Hill is also the main induction center for IDF paratroopers.\n\nThe song \"Ammunition Hill\" (Hebrew: גבעת התחמושת \"Givat Hatachmoshet\"), by Israeli song writer Yoram Taharlev, is one of many which struck a chord with the public due to its authentic description of the experience of the battle.\n\n"}

{"id": "1845795", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1845795", "title": "Grottaferrata", "text": "Grottaferrata\n\nGrottaferrata () is a small town and \"comune\" in the Metropolitan City of Rome, situated on the lower slopes of the Alban Hills, south east of Rome. It has grown up around the Abbey of Santa Maria di Grottaferrata, founded in 1004. Nearby communes include Frascati, Rocca di Papa, Marino and Rome.\n\nThe history of Grottaferrata identifies largely with that of the Basilian Monastery of Santa Maria, founded here in 1004 by Saint Nilus the Younger. The founding legend narrates that, at the spot where the abbey now stands, the Virgin Mary appeared and bade him found a church in her honour.\n\nFrom Gregory, the powerful Count of Tusculum, father of Popes Benedict VIII and John XIX, Nilus obtained the site, which had been a Roman villa, where among the ruins there remained a low edifice of \"opus quadratum\" that had been a sepulchral monument but had been converted to a Christian oratory in the fourth century. Its iron window grates gave the site the name, first of \"Cryptoferrata\" then of \"Grottaferrata\", commemorated in the coat-of-arms of the commune. From the site, a Roman bronze of a man and a cow attracted the antiquarian attention of Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, who had the group removed to Lucera.\n\nNilus died soon afterwards (26 December 1005) in the Sant' Agata monastery in Tusculum. The monastic building was carried out by his successors, especially the fourth abbot, Saint Bartholomew, who is usually considered the second founder. Building materials scavenged from the ruined villa were incorporated into the new structure, marble columns, sections of carved cornice, and blocks of the volcanic stone called \"peperino\". The sanctuary was complete enough in 1024 to be consecrated by the Tusculan Pope John XIX.\n\nThe high repute of the monks attracted many gifts; eleventh- and thirteenth-century mosaics remain, but of the ambitious ensemble of Cosmatesque inlay, only the polychrome stone paving remains. The abbey's possessions in lands were numerous and widespread, and in 1131 King Roger II of Sicily made the abbot Baron of Rossano with an extensive fief. Between the 12th and 15th centuries the monastery suffered from the continual strife of warring factions: Romans and Tusculans, Guelphs and Ghibellines, popes and antipopes, Colonna and Orsini. From 1163 till the destruction of Tusculum in 1191, the greater part of the monastic community sought refuge in a dependency of the abbey, the Benedictine \"protocaenobium\" of Subiaco.\n\nIn the middle of the 13th century the Emperor Frederick II made the abbey his headquarters during the siege of Rome, while in 1378 Breton and Gascon mercenaries held it for the antipope Clement VII. The fifteenth century saw the bloody feuds of the Colonna and the Orsini raging round the walls. According to the humanist Ambrogio Traversari, in 1432 the appearance of the abbey was that of a barracks rather than a monastery.\n\nIn 1462 began a line of non-resident abbots \"in commendam\", fifteen in number, of whom all but one were cardinals. The most distinguished were the Greek Bessarion, Giulio della Rovere (afterwards Julius II), and the last of the line, Cardinal Consalvi, secretary of state to Pius VII. Cardinal Bessarion, himself a Basilian monk, increased the scanty and impoverished community and restored the church. Cardinal Giulio della Rovere, for more selfish motives, erected the castle and surrounded the whole monastery with the imposing fortifications that still exist. Cardinal Alessandro Farnese replaced the ceiling. Gian Lorenzo Bernini was commissioned by Cardinal Francesco Barberini to provide the high altar, completed in 1665.\n\nTill 1608 the community was ruled by priors dependent on abbots \"in commendam\", but in that year Grottaferrata became a member of the Basilian congregation founded by Gregory XIII. The revenues of the community were separated from those of the commendatory abbots, and the first of a series of triennially appointed regular abbots was appointed. The triennial system survived the suppression of the \"commendam\" and lasted till the end of the nineteenth century, with one break from 1834 to 1870, when priors were appointed by the Holy See. In 1901, new constitutions came into force and Arsenio Pellegrini was installed as the first perpetual regular abbot since 1462.\n\nThe Greek Rite which was brought to Grottaferrata by St. Nilus had lost its native character by the end of the twelfth century, but was restored by order of Leo XIII in 1881. The Basilian abbey has always been a home of Greek learning, and Greek hymnography flourished there long after the art had died out within the Byzantine Empire. Monastic studies were revived under Cardinal Bessarion and again in 1608.\n\nOn 11 August 1901 the first electricity reached Grottaferrata from the hydroelectric plant in S. Bartholomew fall.\n\nIn 1937, the monastery was made a territorial abbacy of the Italo-Albanian Catholic Church.\nThe has several courts, which lead to the famous portico designed by Antonio da Sangallo the Younger, with an arcade of nine bays supported by slender columns with Renaissance capitals.\n\nOf the abbey church consecrated by John XIX in 1024, little can be seen in the interior except the mosaics in the narthex and over the triumphal arch, the medieval structures having been covered or destroyed during the \"restorations\" of various abbots \"in commendam\". Some fragmentary thirteenth-century frescoes were revealed in a partial restoration of the church in 1904 to commemorate its novecentennial, when it was made a Roman basilica. The mosaics portray the \"Twelve Apostles\" sitting beside an empty throne, evoking Christ's ascent to Heaven. Domenichino's frescoes, commissioned by Cardinal Odoardo Farnese in 1608, can be seen in the chapel of St. Nilus. Annibale Carracci executed the altarpiece of the \"Madonna with Child with St. Nilus and St. Bartholomew\".\n\nThe modern portico protects the ancient façade; the marble portal with a mosaic above it, an example of Italo-Byzantine art of the twelfth century. In the interior is a baptismal font supported on winged lions, of the tenth or eleventh centuries. Noteworthy also is the Romanesque campanile (twelfth century), with five storeys of tripartite arched windows.\n\nThe library of the Abbey, which contains some 50,000 volumes, has a paper conservation \"Laboratorio di Restauro\", which was entrusted with the conservation of Leonardo's Codex Atlanticus from the Biblioteca Ambrosiana; the library houses writings of St. Nilus and his pupils and a rare copy of Alvise Cadamosto's collected travel accounts, printed in the early sixteenth century.\n\nPope Benedict IX died and was buried in this abbey.\n\nGrottaferrata is twinned with:\n\n\nThe Köppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is \"Csa\" (Mediterranean Climate).\n\n\n<BR>\n"}

It is located in the village of Røldal. It is the church for the Røldal parish which is part of the Hardanger og Voss prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Bjørgvin. The brown, wooden stave church was built in around the year 1250 using designs by an unknown architect. The church seats about 130 people and is built in a long church style. The church is a preserved historic museum, but it is still a regularly-used parish church that holds regularly scheduled worship services twice a month.\n\nThe estimated construction date of the Church is generally suggested to be between 1200 and 1250. A baptismal font in the church is dated to the same period. A crucifix in the church dates from about 1250. The altarpiece dates to 1629. It was the design of German born painter Gottfried Hendtzschel from Breslau in Silesia.\n\nThe Church has a rectangular-shaped nave and chancel. The baptismal font is of soapstone and dated 1200-1300 century. The Bergen Museum holds a variety of building components and other artifacts from the medieval church. These include altar frontal and wooden sculptures of St. Olaf from about 1250, of the Virgin Mary with child from about 1250, and the Archangel Michael, dated about 1200. In the Middle Ages, Røldal Church received large donations from many of pilgrims who flocked to the church. As a result, the small village where the church is located, became quite prosperous. In the 17th century the walls inside the church were richly decorated with paintings.\n\nDuring reconstruction of the church in 1844, some of the history of the church was uncovered. This led to an investigation to determine how the church was built. The resulting belief is that Røldal Stave Church was quite different from other stave churches. Some controversy developed about whether this is in fact a stave church or rather an example of the assumed predecessor type, a post church.\n\nFrom 1913 to 1918, the church underwent an extensive renovation and restoration. Paneling from the 19th century was removed and the Renaissance interior was restored. A new gallery was also built around the church to protect the wall tables. The church reconstruction was led by Norwegian architect Jens Zetlitz Monrad Kielland (1866–1926), and the color restoration was performed by Norwegian painter Domenico Erdmann (1879–1940), who was assisted by Norwegian painter Alfred Obert Hagn (1882–1958), and Danish-Norwegian artist Ulrik Hendriksen (1891–1960).\n\n\n"}

Washburn\n\nWilliam Barrett Washburn (January 31, 1820 – October 5, 1887) was an American businessman and politician from Massachusetts. Washburn served several terms in the United States House of Representatives (1863–71) and as the 28th Governor of Massachusetts from 1872 to 1874, when he won election to the United States Senate in a special election to succeed the recently deceased Charles Sumner. A moderate Republican, Washburn only partially supported the Radical Republican agenda during the American Civil War and the Reconstruction Era that followed.\n\nA Yale graduate, Washburn parlayed early business success in furniture manufacture into banking and railroads, based in the Connecticut River valley town of Greenfield. He was a major proponent of railroads in northern and western Massachusetts, sitting on the board of the Connecticut River Railroad for many years, and playing an oversight role in the construction of the Hoosac Tunnel. He has been described as a latter-day \"Connecticut River God\" because of his role as a leading regional businessman and politician.\n\nWilliam Barrett Washburn was born on January 31, 1820 in Winchendon, Massachusetts, to Asa and Phoebe (Whitney) Washburn. His father was a hat maker from a family with deep colonial roots; Emory Washburn, who was Governor of Massachusetts in 1854, was a distant cousin. Asa Washburn died in 1823.\n\nWashburn was educated in the academies at Hancock and Westminster, and then attended Yale College, graduating in 1844. He was a member of the Skull and Bones Society. He was employed as a store clerk from 1844 to 1847 in the business of his uncle in Orange. He established a chair factory in Erving, operating it from 1847 to 1857 and parlaying a $10,000 ($ in dollars) investment into a wood products business whose annual production exceeded $150,000 ($). In 1849 he cofounded the Franklin County Trust Company, on whose board he sat until 1858. He moved to Greenfield in 1857, where he was elected president of the Greenfield Bank (later the First National Bank), a post he would hold for the rest of his life.\n\nIn 1847, Washburn married Hannah Sweetser of Athol; the couple had six children, with four surviving to adulthood.\n\nWashburn won election to the Massachusetts Senate in 1850 and served two years in the Massachusetts House of Representatives from 1853 to 1855. His elections to the state legislature were supported by proponents of the Hoosac Tunnel. In 1862 Washburn ran for Congress as a Republican, winning election to the 38th Congress against no opposition. He was reelected four times, winning each time by wide margins. He was viewed as relatively moderate, in comparison to the mostly Radical Republican Massachusetts delegation. He served as chairman of the Committee on Claims during the 41st Congress.\n\nIn 1871, Washburn ran for Governor of Massachusetts. The Republican Party was then dominant in state politics, and a number of well-known politicians vied for the party nomination to replace outgoing Governor William Claflin. Most prominent was the former Congressman and American Civil War general Benjamin F. Butler, who was disliked by the fiscally conservative state Republican establishment over his support for the continued issuance of greenbacks (currency not backed by silver or gold), and who frequently used populist tactics to upset convention proceedings. Butler's opponents eventually united behind Washburn to give him the nomination, and he won the general election by a 13,000 vote margin over John Quincy Adams II and a labor candidate. He was reelected to further terms in 1872 and 1873, the former despite dissension in Republican ranks that had resulted in the splitting off of the Liberal Republican Party, who fielded Francis W. Bird. The 1873 convention was particularly affected by the actions of Butler supporters, but Washburn prevailed and was again comfortably reelected. Washburn's three victories over Butler in these conventions marked a low point in the latter's career.\n\nThe major event of 1872 during Washburn's tenure as governor was the Great Boston Fire of 1872, which destroyed of prime commercial real estate in the city on November 9. The legislature was called into a special session to enable the provision of state assistance. Measures it passed included a bill simplifying the establishment of insurance companies, since several were bankrupted by the blaze, and a bill authorizing the city to issue bonds to speed the rebuilding effort. 1873 brought a new round of state funding in the amount of $200,000 to fund the final completion of the Hoosac Tunnel, a tightening of the state's alcohol prohibition laws, and the establishments of a new prison in Concord (now MCI Concord) and a mental hospital in Salem. In 1874, Washburn signed legislation establishing a women's reformatory. Although Washburn was a supporter of women's suffrage, the matter was not seriously considered by the legislature during his term. He also supported legislation reforming the state's child labor and education laws, which were widely flouted. He opposed enactment of a labor bill limiting work to ten hours per day, a subject of regular labor agitation during his tenure.\n\nWhen United States Senator Charles Sumner died in March 1874, the state senate, which then chose the state's US senators, met to choose his replacement. After a long and contentious debate involving thirty-three ballots, Washburn was chosen to succeed Sumner as a compromise candidate acceptable to supporters of Henry L. Dawes and George F. Hoar. Washburn then resigned the governorship, leaving Lieutenant Governor Thomas Talbot as Acting Governor. Washburn served from April 17, 1874 until the term ended on March 3, 1875, and refused to run for reelection.\n\nNot long after leaving the governorship, Washburn was appointed to a state commission established to investigate the finances and operations of the Hoosac Tunnel, whose construction, originally estimated at $2 million ($), had instead cost over $14 million ($) and the financing and involvement of the state to complete. This commission filed its report with the legislature in 1875.\n\nWashburn served at various times as a trustee of Yale, the Massachusetts Agricultural College (now UMass Amherst), Amherst College, and Smith College, whose Washburn House he funded. Harvard University conferred a law degree upon him in 1872. He was a member of a number of missionary societies, which were major beneficiaries of his estate. He was a benefactor of the Greenfield Public Library, funding the construction of its first building and endowing it with funds.\n\nWashburn died in Springfield, Massachusetts, on October 5, 1887, while attending a session of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM), of which he was a member. He was buried in Green River Cemetery in Greenfield.\n\n"}

He attended the Gymnasium in Landau, and, having completed his studies at the teaching seminary, served as a school teacher in Kaiserslautern from 1887. He married Luise Ackermann in 1892.\n\nBetween 1899 and 1904, Hoffmann was a member of the Kaiserslautern city council, seconded by the liberal German People's Party (DVP). In 1907, he joined the Social Democrats and was elected deputy of the Bavarian Landtag the next year; his candidacy earned him disciplinary proceedings and he finally had to quit public service. \n\nIn 1910 he returned into the Kaiserslautern city council and from 1912 he held the position of second mayor. In the same year, he was elected to the German Reichstag parliament. After the German Revolution of 1918–19 and the establishment of the People's State of Bavaria, he served as Bavarian Minister of Education under Minister-President Kurt Eisner. During his tenure as Minister of Education, he removed the Bavarian schooling system from the supervision of the Catholic Church. After Eisner's assassination he succeeded him as minister-president of the People's State of Bavaria on 17 March 1919 as the first freely elected Bavarian Minister President.\n\nOusted from Munich by the forces of the Bavarian Soviet Republic and the local worker's council led by Hoffmann's former party fellow Ernst Niekisch, the parliament and government evaded to Bamberg in April 1919, where Hoffmann took part in the working out of the Bavarian Constitution (\"Bamberg Constitution\"). After his government had Munich occupied by Reichswehr troops and paramilitary Freikorps units, Hoffmann and his cabinet were able to return in May 1919. However, on 14 March 1920, Hoffmann resigned and was succeeded by Gustav von Kahr, after he was forced out of office by the Bavarian Civil Guards and Freikorps forces.\n\nHoffmann returned to Kaiserslautern. After standing unsuccessfully for Mayor of Ludwigshafen, he again tried to pursue his teaching career. Nevertheless, he was dismissed on charges of collaboration during the Allied occupation of the Rhineland. At least, Hoffmann retained his Reichstag mandate until his death in 1930. All pension claims raised by his widow were denied by the Bavarian government.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1845855", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1845855", "title": "The Glass Lake", "text": "The Glass Lake\n\nThe Glass Lake is a 1994 novel by the Irish author Maeve Binchy. The action takes place in a rural Irish village as well as in London in the 1950s. It is notable as the last of Binchy's novels to be set in the 1950s. Binchy explores the roles of women in Irish society and inconstant lovers, and uses an operatic plot to hold the reader's attention.\n\nHelen McMahon disappears when her daughter Kit is 12 years old, and it is suspected that she drowned in the local lake. Kit finds a letter from her mother and burns it before reading it, fearing that a suicide note will prevent her from meriting a church burial. In fact, Helen has left her kindly but unexciting husband Martin and two children to run off to London to be with her dashing lover, and left the note to let them know that she would like to keep in touch with her children as they grow up.\n\nKit struggles to grow up without her mother and with the stigma of her mother's death. While Kit has many friends and mentors to help her grow, she forges a close relationship via a pen pal relationship with a woman named Lena Gray, who claims to have been a close friend of Helen. The story then traces the fallout of Kit finding out that her mother is not dead and is in fact Lena Gray. Other characters in the novel who play significant roles in Kit's life are her on-again, off-again friend Clio Kelly, the doting Philip O'Brien who has wanted to marry her all his life, Stevie Sullivan who owns the car garage across the street, and Sister Madeleine, a reclusive older woman who shares everyone's confidences.\n\nLike \"Tara Road\", in which Binchy introduces an American character to an Irish town, \"The Glass Lake\" offers readers a look at the lives of women in another country – namely, England, to which Lena escapes with her lover. This plot device plays up the \"Irishness\" of the other protagonists and reinforces the self-identity of Binchy's Irish women readers.\n\nPriests, brothers, and nuns are all featured in this and other early works by Binchy. In \"The Glass Lake\", Bincy creates the character of Sister Madeleine, an all-knowing, tolerant, and giving woman who lives as a hermit on the edge of town. Binchy's husband, Gordon Snell, asked her to \"tone down\" Sister Madeleine's goodness after reading the first draft and finding the character \"too soppy\" and \"too sentimental\". However, \"she remains the most wholly admirable person in the story\".\n\nThe \"Detroit Free Press\" notes that \"The Glass Lake\" differs from previous Binchy titles in being plot-driven rather than character-based. This review, which gave the book 2½ out of 4 stars, called the overlay of \"mystery and tragedy swirling around the main character\" unsettling, and accused Binchy of \"in some cases neglect[ing] the credibility of her characters\" in favor of the plot. The \"Star Tribune\", in contrast, felt the major characters were credible but reflected a strong gender bias:\nBinchy's women, once again, tend to be the \"good guys.\" They are capable and loving, ambitious and intelligent. They are disappointed in their relationships with men. Male characters, the \"bad guys\", lack motivation, discipline and commitment. They are, more often than not, the source of the women's problems.\n\nThis review suggests that the gender bias could be traced to Binchy's upbringing in Ireland's male-dominated society, and her coming-of-age during the women's liberation movement.\n\nThe \"South Florida Sun-Sentinel\" praised Binchy for writing \"strong and realistic female characters\" who possess an inner fortitude to survive the ups and downs of daily life. The \"Quad-City Times\" also lauded Binchy's eye and ear for describing the people, conversations, and settings of Ireland of the 1950s.\n\nAs of 1998, \"The Glass Lake\" was Ireland's best-selling book of all time.\n\n\"The Glass Lake\" was produced on an abridged audiobook with a running time of six hours.\n"}

The city was en route to Ilam and Anshan and subsequently to Lorestan, which made it strategically important until the late Sassanid era.\n\nDuring the Pahlavi dynasty era, Andimeshk received a great deal of modern development projects because of its location and resources. These included a railway, the Dokoohe military depot and an aluminum factory-silo, as well as many other industrial developments. The city had been connected along the Trans-Iranian Railway in 1929. During World War II a pipeline was also laid from Abadan, then the location of the world's largest refinery, to Andimeshk; from there the fuel was re-loaded onto trucks and transported to the Soviet Union. In 1955 the pipeline was extended from Andimeshk to Tehran.\n\nAccording to Tarikh-e-Tabari most of the people in this city are of Khuzi origin.\n\nNorth Khuzestan was home to some of the oldest civilizations in the world. The Choghamish hills have more than 8,000 years of treasures from different periods, and archaeologists have called on the city of dawn. Susa's Zanbil temple symbolizes the knowledge of the people who lived in this area over 3,000 years ago. Apadana palace is a symbol of the greatness of the Iranians. Shushtar waterfalls are a symbol of Iranian engineering and technology. Dezful's Old Bridge is a symbol of Persian authority.

The dam is not 127 m high rather 48 m and River Dez has the dam with 127m high and build by American multinational company. The karkhe dam damaged wild life down stream up to Shoush some 30 km south.\nThe dam is on the Karkheh River in the north-western province of Khuzestan, the closest city being Andimeshk to the east. It is 127 metres high and has a reservoir capacity of 5.9 billion cubic meters. The Karkheh Dam is designed to irrigate 320,000 hectares of land, produce 520 MW of hydro-electricity and prevent downstream floods. In 1956, studies began on the Karkheh Dam by the American company Development and Resources Corporation, which was headed by David E. Lilienthal, the former Chairman of the TVA. In 1990, the final studies were completed by Mahab Ghods Consulting Engineers. The engineering division of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) started construction on the Karkheh Dam in 1992 and the dam was complete in 2001. During construction, 120 contractual and over eight consultative companies worked on the dam. 5,000 workers constructed the dam and 40 died in the process.\n\nIt is also possible to visit the powerhouse which is located at the east side of the dam in the mountains. The powerhouse has eight vertical Francis turbines.\n\nThe dam's current problem is the annual loss of reservoir capacity due to the erosion of soil in upstream areas.\n\nAndimeshk sits close to the foothills of the Zagros Mountains on the main north-south highway from Tehran to Ahvaz, the provincial capital of Khuzestan. The main rail line from Tehran to the Persian Gulf is 15 km (9 mi) from Andimeshk..\nPersian Gulf is at least 200 km south.\n\nAndimeshk has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification \"BSh\") with extremely hot summers and mild winters. Rainfall is higher than most of southern Iran, but is almost exclusively confined to the period from November to April, though on occasions it can exceed per month or per year.\n\nAndimeshk Because Railway Station is the primary commercial center for northern Khuzestan and one of the main producers of agricultural products in Iran .

Not all are equivalent, and for legal purposes the effective definitions vary depending on the jurisdiction and the purposes for which the term is being used. Under European and other data protection regimes, which centre primarily around the General Data Protection Regulation, the term \"personal data\" is significantly broader, and determines the scope of the regulatory regime.\n\nNational Institute of Standards and Technology Special Publication 800-122 defines personally identifiable information as \"any information about an individual maintained by an agency, including (1) any information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, such as name, social security number, date and place of birth, mother's maiden name, or biometric records; and (2) any other information that is linked or linkable to an individual, such as medical, educational, financial, and employment information.\" So, for example, a user's IP address is not classed as PII on its own, but is classified as a linked PII. However, in the European Union, the IP address of an Internet subscriber may be classed as personal data.\n\nPersonal data is defined under the GDPR as \"any information which [is] related to an identified or identifiable natural person\". \n\nThe concept of PII has become prevalent as information technology and the Internet have made it easier to collect PII leading to a profitable market in collecting and reselling PII. PII can also be exploited by criminals to stalk or steal the identity of a person, or to aid in the planning of criminal acts. As a response to these threats, many website privacy policies specifically address the gathering of PII, and lawmakers such as the European Parliament have enacted a series of legislation such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to limit the distribution and accessibility of PII.\n\nImportant confusion arises around whether PII means information which is identifiable (that is, can be associated with a person) or identifying (that is, associated uniquely with a person, such that the PII \"identifies\" them). In prescriptive data privacy regimes such as HIPAA, PII items have been specifically defined. In broader data protection regimes such as the GDPR, personal data is defined in a non-prescriptive principles-based way. Information that might not count as PII under HIPAA can be personal data for the purposes of GDPR. For this reason, \"PII\" is typically deprecated internationally. \n\nThe U.S. government used the term \"personally identifiable\" in 2007 in a memorandum from the Executive Office of the President, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and that usage now appears in US standards such as the NIST \"Guide to Protecting the Confidentiality of Personally Identifiable Information\" (SP 800-122). The OMB memorandum defines PII as follows:\n\nA term similar to PII, \"personal data\" is defined in EU directive 95/46/EC, for the purposes of the directive:\n\nHowever, in the EU rules, there has been a clearer notion that the data subject can potentially be identified through additional processing of other attributes—quasi- or pseudo-identifiers. In the GDPR Personal Data is defined as:\n\n\"Any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ('data subject'); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person\"\n\nAnother term similar to PII, \"personal information\" is defined in a section of the California data breach notification law, SB1386:\n\nThe concept of information combination given in the SB1386 definition is key to correctly distinguishing PII, as defined by OMB, from \"personal information\", as defined by SB1386. Information, such as a name, that lacks context cannot be said to be SB1386 \"personal information\", but it must be said to be PII as defined by OMB. For example, the name John Smith has no meaning in the current context and is therefore not SB1386 \"personal information\", but it is PII. A Social Security Number (SSN) without a name or some other associated identity or context information is not SB1386 \"personal information\", but it is PII. For example, the SSN 078-05-1120 by itself is PII, but it is not SB1386 \"personal information\". However the combination of a valid name with the correct SSN is SB1386 \"personal information\".\n\nThe combination of a name with a context may also be considered PII; for example, if a person's name is on a list of patients for an HIV clinic. However, it is not necessary for the name to be combined with a context in order for it to be PII. The reason for this distinction is that bits of information such as names, although they may not be sufficient by themselves to make an identification, may later be combined with other information to identify persons and expose them to harm.\n\nAccording to the OMB, it is not always the case that PII is \"sensitive\", and context may be taken into account in deciding whether certain PII is or is not sensitive.\n\nIn Australia, the Privacy Act 1988 deals with the protection of individual privacy, using the OECD Privacy Principles from the 1980s to set up a broad, principles-based regulatory model (unlike in the US, where coverage is generally not based on broad principles but on specific technologies, business practices or data items). Section 6 has the relevant definition. The critical detail is that the definition of 'personal information' also applies to where the individual can be indirectly identified:\n\nThis raises the question of reasonableness: assume it is theoretically possible to identify a person from information which does not include a name or address, but does contain clues which could be pursued to find out who it relates to. How much extra effort does it take to make it unreasonable that such information could be identified? For instance, if the information involves an IP address, and the relevant ISP stores logs which could easily be inspected (if you had sufficient legal justification) to re-link the IP address to the account holder, can their identity be \"reasonably ascertained\"? If such linking used to be expensive, slow and difficult, but becomes easier, does this change the answer at some point?\n\nIt appears that this definition is significantly broader than the Californian example given above, and thus that Australian privacy law, while in some respects weakly enforced, may cover a broader category of data and information than in some US law.\n\nIn particular, online behavioral advertising businesses based in the US but surreptitiously collecting information from people in other countries in the form of cookies, bugs, trackers and the like may find that their preference to avoid the implications of wanting to build a psychographic profile of a particular person using the rubric of 'we don't collect personal information' may find that this does not make sense under a broader definition like that in the Australian Privacy Act.\n\nNote that the term \"PII\" is not used in Australian privacy law. \n\n\nEuropean data protection law does not utilize the concept of personally identifiable information, and its scope is instead determined by non-synonymous, wider concept of \"personal data\".\n\nFurther examples can be found on the EU privacy website.\n\n\nThe twelve Information Privacy Principles of the Privacy Act 1993 apply.\n\nThe Federal Act on Data Protection of 19 June 1992 (in force since 1993) has set up a strict protection of privacy by prohibiting virtually any processing of personal data which is not expressly authorized by the data subjects. The protection is subject to the authority of the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner.\n\nAdditionally, any person may ask in writing a company (managing data files) the correction or deletion of any personal data. The company must respond within thirty days.\n\nThe Privacy Act of 1974 (Pub.L. 93–579, 88 Stat. 1896, enacted 31 December 1974, 5 U.S.C. § 552a), a United States federal law, establishes a Code of Fair Information Practice that governs the collection, maintenance, use, and dissemination of personally identifiable information about individuals that is maintained in systems of records by federal agencies.\n\nOne of the primary focuses of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), is to protect a patient's Protected Health Information (PHI), which is similar to PII. The U.S. Senate proposed the Privacy Act of 2005, which attempted to strictly limit the display, purchase, or sale of PII without the person's consent. Similarly, the (proposed) Anti-Phishing Act of 2005 attempted to prevent the acquiring of PII through phishing.\n\nU.S. lawmakers have paid special attention to the social security number because it can be easily used to commit identity theft. The (proposed) Social Security Number Protection Act of 2005 and (proposed) Identity Theft Prevention Act of 2005 each sought to limit the distribution of an individual's social security number.\n\nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology is a physical sciences laboratory, and a non-regulatory agency of the United States Department of Commerce. Its mission is to promote innovation and industrial competitiveness\n\nThe following data, often used for the express purpose of distinguishing individual identity, clearly classify as personally identifiable information under the definition used by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (described in detail below):\n\n\nThe following are less often used to distinguish individual identity, because they are traits shared by many people.\nHowever, they are potentially PII, because they may be combined with other personal information to identify an individual.\n\n\nWhen a person wishes to remain anonymous, descriptions of them will often employ several of the above, such as \"a 34-year-old white male who works at Target\". Note that information can still be \"private\", in the sense that a person may not wish for it to become publicly known, without being personally identifiable. Moreover, sometimes multiple pieces of information, none sufficient by itself to uniquely identify an individual, may uniquely identify a person when combined; this is one reason that multiple pieces of evidence are usually presented at criminal trials. It has been shown that, in 1990, 87% of the population of the United States could be uniquely identified by gender, ZIP code, and full date of birth.\n\nIn hacker and Internet slang, the practice of finding and releasing such information is called \"doxing\". It is sometimes used to deter collaboration with law enforcement. On occasion, the doxing can trigger an arrest, particularly if law enforcement agencies suspect that the \"doxed\" individual may panic and disappear.\n\n\n\nIn forensics, particularly the identification and prosecution of criminals, personally identifiable information is critical in establishing evidence in criminal procedure. Criminals may go to great trouble to avoid leaving any PII, such as by:\n\n\n\nPersonal data is a key component of our Online identity and can be exploited by individuals. For instance, data can be altered and be used to create fake documents, hijack mail boxes and phone calls or harass people, like on the data breach from the EE Limited company.\n\nAnother key case can be referred as Financial Identity Theft\n\n, usually about bank account and credit card information being stolen, and then used or sold.\n\nPersonal data can also be used to create fake Online identity, including fake accounts and profiles (that can be referred as Identity Cloning\n\n, or Identity Fraud) for celebrities to gather data from other users more easily. Even individuals can be concerned, especially for personal purpose (this is more widely known as Sockpuppet).\n\nThe most critical information, such as password, date of birth, ID documents or Social Insurance Number, can be used to log in to different websites (See Password reuse and Account verification) to gather more information and access more content.\n\nAlso, several agencies ask for discretion on subject related to their work, for the safety of their employees. For this reason, the United States Department of Defense (DoD) has strict policies controlling release of personally identifiable information of DoD personnel. Many intelligence agencies have similar policies, sometimes to the point where employees do not disclose to their friends that they work for the agency.\n\nSimilar identity protection concerns exist for witness protection programs, women's shelters, and victims of domestic violence and other threats.\n\nDuring the second half of the 20th century, the digital revolution introduced \"privacy economics\", or the trade of personal data. The value of data can change over time and in different contexts. Disclosing data can reverse information asymmetry, though the costs of doing so can be unclear. In relation to companies, consumers often have \"imperfect information regarding when their data is collected, with what purposes, and with what consequences.\"\n\nWriting in 2015, Alessandro Acquisti, Curtis Taylor and Liad Wagman identified three \"waves\" in the trade of personal data:\n\n"}

Bhutto was appointed as a chief advisor to the Governor of Sind.\n\nIn preparation for the provincial elections in 1937, the Sind United Party was formed by Haji Abdullah Haroon and Bhutto joined it as the vice-chairman of the party. It was modeled after the Punjab Unionist Party and claimed to represent all Sindhis irrespective of religion. Nevertheless, Bhutto brought leading \"pirs\" (Sufi saints) to influence the voters 'religiously' to cast their votes in his favour. The Sind United Party emerged as the largest party in the elections, winning 21 out of 60 seats. However, both Harron and Bhutto failed to get elected. The Larkana seat, which Bhutto had contested, was won by Sheikh Abdul Majid Sindhi. The Governor invited Ghulam Hussain Hidayatullah, the leader of the Sind Muslim Party and a political rival of Bhutto in Sind, to form a government. Large scale defections took place in the Assembly, Bhutto resigned from the party and Haroon eventually merged his party into the All-India Muslim League.\nBhutto returned to Bombay to become the Chairman of the Bombay-Sind Public Service Commission.\n\nEarly in 1947, Bhutto joined the council of ministers of Muhammad Mahabat Khan III the Nawab of Junagadh in the modern-day province of Gujarat, becoming its Dewan, or prime minister in May.\n\nAt the time of the independence of India in 1947, the princely states were asked by the British to decide whether to join the newly independent states of India or Pakistan or to remain autonomous and outside them. The Constitutional Advisor to the Nawab, Nabi Baksh, indicated to Lord Mountbatten that he was recommending that the State should join India. However, the Nawab did not make a decision. Early in 1947, Bhutto was invited to join the Council of Ministers of the Nawab. In May, when the Dewan Abdul Khadir Muhammad Hussain went abroad for medical treatment, Bhutto was appointed as the Dewan. On 15 August 1947, the State announced that it had acceded to Pakistan. On 13 September 1947, the Government of Pakistan accepted the accession.\n\nHowever, the Hindu citizens of the State revolted, leading to several events and also a plebiscite, resulting in the integration of Junagadh into India. Nawab Muhammad Mahabat Khan III of Junagadh (erstwhile Babi Nawab dynasty of Junagadh) fled to Sindh, Pakistan. As Dewan of Junagarh; it was he who wrote and signed the letter addressed to Indian Government to come and take over the administration of the Junagadh state.\n\nShah Nawaz Bhutto moved to Larkana District, where his land-ownership made him among the wealthiest and most influential people in Sindh. Bhutto was a good friend of Governor General (later President) Iskander Mirza, who was a regular guest for the annual hunt in Larkana, staying at the Bhutto family home called \"Al-Murtaza\". In the winter of 1955-1956, Mirza brought General Ayub Khan with him to Larkana for the hunt.\n\nThe British imperial government awarded Bhutto the title of \"Khan Sahib\", subsequently raising it to \"Khan Bahadur\". Bhutto was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, Civil Division (OBE) in the 1920 New Year Honours list, with a further appointment as a Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire (CIE) in the 1925 New Year Honours list. In the 1930 New Year Honours, Bhutto was knighted, and was invested with his knighthood on 27 February 1930 at Viceroy's House in New Delhi by the Viceroy of India, the Lord Irwin.\n\n\nBhutto was a first cousin once removed of Wahid Baksh Bhutto, who in 1924 was made a sardar and in 1926 was elected to the Imperial Legislative Assembly from Sindh, a constituency of the Bombay Presidency, becoming the first member of the Bhutto family to be elected to public office.\n\nShah Nawaz Bhutto was married to Khursheed Begum, formerly Lakhi Bai, who was of a modest Hindu family. She converted from Hinduism to Islam before her marriage. Her brothers remained Hindu and eventually migrated to India.\n\nTheir children included Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the Prime Minister of Pakistan, and a daughter called Mumtaz, who married Brigadier Muhammad Mustafa Khan Bahadur of the Sidi clan. Their first child, Sikandar, died from pneumonia at the age of seven in 1914, and their second child, Imdad Ali, died of cirrhosis at the age of thirty-nine in 1953. Their son Zulfikar Ali was born in his parents' residence near Larkana, and was their third child.\n\n\n"}

He briefly attended Alexandria University, but dropped out and left Egypt altogether in 1981, moving to Germany. There, he later recalled he had lived a life \"of corruption - girls, drugs, you name it\".\n\nThe following year, Germany denied him political asylum, and he quickly married Renate Soika, a troubled German woman, which guaranteed he could remain in the country. He divorced Soika three years later, but shortly after he married another woman named Marianne Weber in a Muslim ceremony. He flew to Brooklyn with his new wife and after his American tourist visa expired, applied for amnesty claiming to be an agricultural worker and was accepted as a permanent resident under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986.\n\nHe worked as a New York City cabdriver for five years from 1986–1991, though he saw his license suspended ten times during that period, for failing to attend traffic court for cab violations including traffic violations and an attempt to overcharge a customer.\n\nIn his free time, Abouhalima worked long hours for a non-profit group in Brooklyn that raised money for the Afghan Mujahideen.\n\nAbouhalima travelled to Afghanistan in 1988, saying he wanted to prove he \"was a Muslim, not a sheep\", and received combat-training in Peshawar.\n\nAli Mohamed, a sergeant at Fort Bragg, provided United States Army manuals and other assistance to individuals at the al-Farouq Mosque, and some members including Abouhalima and El Sayyid Nosair practiced at the Calverton Shooting Range on Long Island, many of the group wearing t-shirts reading \"Help Each Other in Goodness and Piety...A Muslim to a Muslim is a Brick Wall\" with a map of Afghanistan emblazoned in the middle. Abouhalima wore an NRA cap during their practices. When Nosair assassinated Meir Kahane, Abouhalima was driving the purported getaway car, although Nosair accidentally jumped into another cab by mistake.\n\nHe was the subject of an FBI investigation through January 1993, at which point the investigation was called off, shortly before the World Trade Center bombing. On February 26, 1993, the day of the WTC bombing, he was seen by several witnesses with Mohammed A. Salameh at the Jersey City storage facility allegedly used to prepare the explosives.\n\nAbouhalima fled to Saudi Arabia, and then back to his native Egypt where he was captured by Egyptian police, tortured, and handed back to the United States, imprisoned in a cocoon of duct tape.\n\nIn March 1994, he received a sentence of 240 years in prison with no possibility of parole. After an appeal, the sentence was later reduced to 1,300 months. He is currently an inmate at ADX Florence in Florence, Colorado. His current release date as stated on the Bureau of Prisons website is 09-20-2087. His Federal Bureau of Prisons ID# is 28064-054.\n"}

They are governed by the Emirates Cricket Board (ECB) which became an Affiliate Member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 1989 and an Associate Member the following year. Since 2005, the ICC's headquarters have been located in Dubai.\n\nOne of the emerging One Day International (ODI) teams, the UAE won the ACC Trophy on four consecutive occasions between 2000 and 2006, and were runners-up in the other three times the tournament has been played in 1996, 1998 and 2008. They won the ICC Trophy in 1994, and played their first ODIs that year, later playing in the 1996 Cricket World Cup. Other ODI matches came in the 2004 and 2008 Asia Cups. At the 2014 World Cup Qualifier, the UAE placed second behind Scotland, qualifying for the 2015 World Cup and gaining ODI status until 2018.\n\nUAE made the group stage of the 2014 ICC World Twenty20. The team has qualified for the 2019 ICC T20 World Cup Qualifier as hosts. Following the demise of the World Cricket League (WCL), UAE will play in the 2019–22 ICC Cricket World Cup League 2 going forward.\n\nIn 1892, the United Kingdom took responsibility of the Sheikhdoms, and cricket was introduced by the British Army in what is now the UAE, but was then known as the \"Trucial States\". The game spread during World War II, as personnel from the British Royal Air Force and other Commonwealth forces (which included first-class and club cricketers from Australia and New Zealand) stationed in cities such as Ajman, Al Ain, Dubai and Sharjah, continued their favourite pastime. The pitches installed by them around the air base in Sharjah were used by British and other foreign nationals after the war ended.\n\nSharjah residents began playing the Dubai residents in the local derbies which were held in Dubai. The Garden city of Al Ain has the oldest cricket council in the whole of the UAE. The popularity of the game declined after independence in 1971; however, when South Asians began settling in the country, they brought with them a wish to play cricket. The local Arab population, educated in India and Pakistan, set up clubs and domestic tournaments began in the 1980s.\n\nThe first match was played by the UAE national side in February 1976 against Pakistan International Airlines in Sharjah. The visitors scored 345/5 from their 50 overs and the UAE were on 88/4 from 28 overs when the game was abandoned due to rain.\n\nWealthy locals began investing in the sport and an International standard cricket ground was constructed in Sharjah. The Sharjah Cricket Association Stadium hosted its first international event in 1984 when India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka contested the Asia Cup. The venue has gone on to host almost 200 ODIs and four Test matches, the Test matches having been held there due to security concerns in Pakistan.\n\nThe Emirates Cricket Board (ECB) was established in 1989 and gained affiliate membership of the ICC the same year. They were quickly promoted to associate member status the following year. Also in 1990 the national side returned to action, twice losing heavily to the Netherlands. These heavy defeats showed that much work needed to be done if the UAE were to be successful in the 1994 ICC Trophy and the ECB adopted a controversial policy.\n\nHoping to form a successful national side in time for the tournament in Kenya, the ECB attracted several players with first-class experience in India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka to take up employment in the country so that they could satisfy the residential requirements to represent the UAE in the tournament.\n\nWith just one native Arab selected in the shape of Sultan Zarawani, who captained the side, the UAE won the trophy and thus qualified for the 1996 World Cup. UAE had beaten Kenya in the final, and the Kenyan players and cricket board were very vocal in their anger at being defeated by what they and other observers described as a team of imported mercenaries.\n\nWhilst the ICC remained relatively silent on the controversy, the national team eligibility requirements were strongly tightened for all future ICC sanctioned tournaments.\n\nThe UAE played their first ODIs in 1994 when they played against India and Pakistan in the Austral-Asia Cup, which they also hosted. They finished last in a tri-series against Kenya and the Netherlands the same year and also finished last in a tournament against the A sides of India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka in 1995. They returned to ODI cricket in the 1996 World Cup where they lost all matches except the one against the Netherlands, which was the first ever ODI between two associate members of the ICC.\n\nLater in 1996 the UAE were runners-up to Bangladesh in the first ACC Trophy. The tightened eligibility rules meant that they were unable to repeat their 1994 success when they finished tenth in the 1997 ICC Trophy in Malaysia. They were beaten by Bangladesh in the semi-finals of the 1998 ACC Trophy.\n\nWith Bangladesh being promoted to ICC full membership, the UAE began to establish themselves as the top associate side in Asia, though they often fell short against the top associates in Europe and North America, a position that remains to this day. They won the ACC Trophy in 2000 and 2002, beating Hong Kong and Nepal in the respective finals, but finished fifth in the 2001 ICC Trophy in Canada.\n\nUAE hosted the 2004 ICC Six Nations Challenge and finished fifth, level on points with four other teams. The year was a busy one for the UAE cricketers as they played the first Intercontinental Cup match against Nepal, with Ali Asad taking nine wickets in the first innings. They beat Malaysia later in the tournament but lost to Canada in the semi-finals. They also won the ACC Trophy again, beating Oman in the final. They returned to ODI cricket, losing to India and Sri Lanka in the first round of the Asia Cup, and finished fourth in the Hong Kong Sixes, beating India and South Africa on the way.\n\nThey reached the semi-finals of the ICC Intercontinental Cup again in 2005, also playing a series against England A at Sharjah, losing all four matches. The 2005 ICC Trophy in Ireland saw them finish sixth. They beat Hong Kong in the final of the 2006 ACC Trophy, but began their 2006 ICC Intercontinental Cup campaign with an innings defeat by Namibia. The campaign continued with a draw against Scotland and a defeat by Ireland, again by an innings. They finished fourth in the first ACC Twenty20 Cup in 2007.\n\nTheir campaign in the 2007-08 ICC Intercontinental Cup was unsuccessful, with just one win against Bermuda in their seven matches. Things went better for them in Division Two of the World Cricket League in Windhoek in 2007, winning the tournament after beating Oman in the final.\n\nThey again played in the Asia Cup in 2008, losing to Bangladesh and Sri Lanka in the first round. Their 2008 ACC Trophy Elite began with a shock defeat by Saudi Arabia, their first ACC Trophy defeat since the 1998 semi-final. They lost to Hong Kong in the final, ending a run of four consecutive titles.\n\nThe UAE hosted and were runners-up at the 2009 ACC Twenty20 Cup, losing the final to Afghanistan, after winning four group matches and accounting for Oman in their semi-final.\n\nIn October 2010, the team announced that it had hired Kabir Khan to become its coach. Khan had great success with the Afghan team during his one-year stint as they became eligible to play ODIs. Kabir Khan also stated that his aim was to help UAE qualify for the 2012 ICC World Twenty20.\n\nIn April 2011, the UAE hosted and won Division Two of the World Cricket League without losing a match. In June/July 2011, they played Kenya at Nairobi for the first round of 2011–13 ICC Intercontinental Cup. In December, the UAE participated in the 2011 ACC Twenty20 Cup in Nepal. Then in 2013, they traveled to Scotland to compete in the 2013 Cricket World Cup Qualifier, the final event of the 2009–13 World Cricket League.\n\nUAE finished third in the 2013 ACC Twenty20 Cup which after defeating Hong Kong in the play-off for third place. In November, they hosted 2013 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier and finished fourth after losing to Nepal in the play-off for third place, and qualified for the 2014 ICC World Twenty20, defeating the Netherlands by 10 runs in the quarter-final.\n\nAfthab Muhammad Nisar is the captain of UAE's under 17 side\n\nUAE participated in the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 but were unsuccessful in the tournament, going without a win. UAE finished second in the 2014 ACC Premier League and qualified for the 2014 ACC Championship. They also qualified for 2015 Cricket World Cup in Australia and New Zealand.\n\nUAE qualified to play in the Cricket World Cup after a lapse of almost twenty years. Unlike other teams in the tournament, the squad of players mainly consisted of semi-professionals. The team registered their highest ODI total ever at the 2015 Cricket World Cup in a group stage match played against Zimbabwe in Nelson, New Zealand. However, they failed to register a win and were eliminated from the 2015 Cricket World Cup with 6 losses out of 6 matches in Pool B.\nThis was their first win against a full member side.\n\nUpdated 3 November 2016\n\nIn terms of infrastructure, the UAE have the best stadiums as compared to other Associate members: Sheikh Zayed Cricket Stadium in Abu Dhabi;\nDSC Cricket Stadium, Dubai and Sharjah Cricket Association Stadium, Sharjah, which has hosted around 200 ODIs and Test matches.\n\nInternational stadiums in Ajman and Al Ain are currently under development.\n\nThe following are the main cricket stadiums in UAE:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational match summary – United Arab Emirates\n\"Last updated 27 February 2020.\"\n\n\nMost ODI runs for the United Arab Emirates\n\nMost ODI wickets for the United Arab Emirates\n\nHighest individual innings in ODIs \n\nBest bowling figures in an innings in ODIs \n\nODI record versus other nations\n\"Last updated 9 January 2020.\"\n\n\nMost T20I runs for the United Arab Emirates\n\nMost T20I wickets for the United Arab Emirates\n\nT20I record versus other nations\n\"Records complete to T20I #1066.

It was founded in 1907 and now represents nearly three-quarter of a million members.\n\nThe Club was founded in 1907 as \"The Caravan Club of Great Britain and Ireland\". Its aim was to \"... bring together those interested in van life as a pastime...to improve and supply suitable vans and other appliances...to develop the pastime by collecting, publishing and supplying to members, books and periodicals and lists of camp sites etc... to arrange camping grounds...\".\n\nThe Club was renamed as \"The Caravan Club\" in 1959 and celebrated its centenary on 14 June 2007. The club's current name, the \"Caravan and Motorhome Club\" was adopted in February 2017.\n\nThe Caravan Club is a membership organisation. The Club is led by the Executive Committee, which airs policy issues with the Club Council. The council in turn is supported by the 10 Regional Councils. Their aim of the Regional Councils is to coordinate communications throughout The Club membership. Regional Councils provide a forum to discuss Club issues and to solve local and regional problems. Club members may also vote at the Annual Members Meeting.\n\nThe Club is a member of the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), an organisation that represents the interests of motoring organisations and motor car users.\n\nThe Club has over 900 staff and an annual turnover of around £100 million.\n\nThe Caravan and Motorhome Club has around 700,000 current Members.\n\nThe Club operates around 200 main Caravan Club sites and over 2,200 smaller certificated \"five-van\" sites, known as CLs (certificated locations).\n\nA certificated location (or 'CL') is an informal privately owned caravan site for up to 5 caravans in the United Kingdom. Visitors with caravans pay a small fee to the CL owner in order to pitch overnight. This is usually cheaper than larger commercial caravan sites. There are over 2200 CLs in the UK and they are for exclusive use by Caravan And Motorhome Club members. Each year the Caravan And Motorhome Club issues a certificate to those sites that continue to meet their standards, hence 'certificated locations'. Caravan And Motorhome Club members vote annually for the best CL in the 'CL of the Year' competition.\n\nMost CLs are in the countryside, they are individually owned and can be on a farm or smallholding, on spare land next to a pub, golf course or hotel or on land attached to the owner's house. CLs need no site licence or formal planning permission, but are covered by two Acts of Parliament: \n\nThe laws state that visitors with caravans must be members of The Caravan And Motorhome Club, who are required to act responsibly and to observe the Country Code and no more than 5 caravans may be accommodated on the site at any one time. Caravans may not stay for more than 28 days per visit and must be occupied overnight. CLs are for recreational purposes and only touring caravans, motor caravans or trailer tents are permitted – tents are not permitted, other than attached caravan awnings, toilet tents or small pup tents; and permanently sited (static) caravans are not permitted on the same landholding.\n\nThere are also a number of guidelines stated. For example, CLs should be fairly level and have at least ½ acre of land; and have safe access for caravans including 12 ft wide gateway and safe approach road. If the landowner has a caravan site licence from their Local Authority, the Caravan And Motorhome Club is unlikely to issue a Certificate, unless the CL is entirely separate from the landowner's other business activities.\n\nTo become a CL, owners should provide an emptying point for chemical closets; a safe drinking water supply; A bin for dry rubbish; and public liability insurance cover. Some owners provide optional extras such as electrical hook ups, showers and toilets. Although exempt from planning permission, CL owners are liable to pay business rates and income tax on their profits.\n\nEach year, the club holds a \"National Rally\" over the Spring Bank holiday at the end of May. The rally usually taking place in the grounds of a stately home and can attract up to 10,000 caravanners at a time.\n\nThe first National Rally was held at Leamington Spa in 1936 and attracting 100 caravans. In 2007, for the Club's Centenary year, the 80th National Rally was held in the grounds of Blenheim Palace, Oxfordshire from Friday 25th to Tuesday 29 May.\n\nThe club offers a variety of other services with the intention of supporting and improving the lifestyle and holidays of its members. They offer a variety of insurance products including caravan, motorhome, car, breakdown, holiday, home and pet coverage.\n\nThey also provide overseas ferry and pitch bookings for members looking to holiday overseas, as well as an extensive range of technical advice.\n\nThe club is also active in lobbying on behalf of its members.\n\nThe Caravan Club has developed alliances with a number of groups:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1845955", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1845955", "title": "Prague uprising", "text": "Prague uprising\n\nThe Prague uprising () of 1945 was a partially successful attempt by the Czech resistance to liberate the city of Prague from German occupation during World War II. The preceding six years of occupation had fuelled anti-German sentiment and the approach of the Soviet Red Army and the US Third Army offered a chance of success.\n\nOn 5 May 1945, in the last moments of the war in Europe, Czech citizens spontaneously attacked the German occupiers and Czech resistance leaders emerged from hiding to join the uprising. The Russian Liberation Army, which had been fighting for the Germans, defected and supported the Czechs. German troops counter-attacked, but their progress was slowed by barricades constructed by the Czech citizenry. On 8 May, the Czech and German leaders signed a ceasefire allowing the German forces to withdraw from the city, but not all Waffen-SS units obeyed. Fighting continued until 9 May, when the Red Army entered the nearly liberated city.\n\nThe uprising was brutal, with both sides committing war crimes. Violence against Germans, sanctioned by the Czechoslovak government, continued after the liberation, and was justified as revenge for the occupation or as a means to encourage Germans to flee. George Patton’s US Third Army was ordered by General Dwight Eisenhower not to come to the aid of the Czech insurgents, which undermined the credibility of the Western powers in postwar Czechoslovakia. Instead, the uprising was presented as a symbol of Czech resistance to Nazi rule, and the liberation by the Red Army was used by the Czechoslovak Communist Party to increase popular support for communism.\n\nIn 1938, the German Chancellor, Adolf Hitler, announced his intention to annex the Sudetenland, a region of Czechoslovakia with a high ethnic German population. As the previous appeasement of Hitler had shown, the governments of both France and Britain were intent on avoiding war. British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and French Prime Minister Édouard Daladier negotiated with Hitler and ultimately acquiesced to his demands at the Munich Agreement, in exchange for guarantees from Nazi Germany that no additional lands would be annexed. No Czechoslovak representatives were present at the negotiations. Five months later, when the Slovak Diet declared the independence of Slovakia, Hitler summoned Czechoslovak President Emil Hácha to Berlin and forced him to accept the German occupation of the Czech rump state and its re-organisation into the German-dominated Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. Germany promptly invaded and occupied the remaining Czech territories. Although France had a defensive alliance with Czechoslovakia, neither the French nor British intervened militarily.\n\nThe Nazis considered many Czechs to be ethnically Aryan, and therefore suitable for Germanisation. As a consequence, the German occupation was less harsh than in other Slavic nations. Wartime living standards were actually higher in the occupied region than in Germany itself. However, freedom of speech was curtailed and 400,000 Czechs were conscripted for forced labour in the Reich. During the six-year occupation, more than 20,000 Czechs were executed and thousands more died in concentration camps. In 1941, the Nazi Reinhard Heydrich was made Deputy Protector of Bohemia and Moravia and began enforcing the occupation more harshly. Within five days of Heydrich's arrival, 142 people were executed. His brutality led to the Allies ordering his assassination the following year, but the Germans killed more than a thousand Czechs in reprisal, including the entire villages of Lidice and Ležáky. While the general violence of the occupation was much less severe than in Eastern Europe, it nevertheless incited violent anti-German sentiment in many Czechs.\n\nDuring the spring of 1945, partisan forces in Bohemia and Moravia totalled about 120 groups, with a combined strength of around 7,500 people. Partisans disrupted the railway and highway transportation by sabotaging track and bridges and attacking trains and stations. Some railways could not be used at night or on some days, and trains were forced to travel at a slower speed. Waffen-SS units retreating from the Red Army's advance into Moravia burned down entire villages as a reprisal. Despite losing much of their leadership to a March 1945 purge by the Gestapo, Communist groups in Prague distributed propaganda leaflets calling for an insurrection. German soldiers and civilians became increasingly worried and prepared to flee violent retaliation for the occupation. In an attempt to reassert German authority, SS police general Karl Hermann Frank broadcast a message over the radio threatening to destroy Prague and drown any opposition in blood.\n\nIn early 1945, former Czechoslovak Army officers set up the commanded by General to oversee fighting inside Prague, and the under General to direct insurgent units in the suburbs. Meanwhile, the Czech National Council , with representatives from various Czech political parties, formed to take over political leadership after the overthrow of the Nazi and collaborationist authorities. Military leaders planning an uprising within Prague counted on the loyalty of ethnically Czech members of the police and the Government Army of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, as well as employees of key civil services, such as transport workers and the fire brigade. The Russian Liberation Army (ROA), composed of Soviet POWs that had agreed to fight for Nazi Germany, was stationed outside of Prague. Hoping that the ROA could be persuaded to switch sides in order to avoid accusations of collaboration, the Czech military command sent an envoy to General Sergei Bunyachenko, commander of the 1st ROA Infantry Division (600th German Infantry Division). Bunyachenko agreed to help the Czechs.\n\nOn 4 May, the US Third Army under General George S. Patton entered Czechoslovakia. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill was the only political leader to advocate the liberation of Prague by the Western Allies. In a telegram to General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, Churchill said that \"the liberation of Prague...by US troops might make the whole difference to the postwar situation of Czechoslovakia and might well influence that in nearby countries.\" Joseph Stalin, leader of the Soviet Union, also wanted his forces to liberate the city, and asked that the Americans stop at Plzeň, 50 miles to the west. The Red Army was planning a major offensive into the Protectorate, due to start 7 May. Eisenhower, disinclined to accept American casualties or risk antagonising the Soviet Union, acquiesced to the Soviet demands that the Red Army enter Prague.\n\nStaff of Czech Radio opposed to the occupation began the morning by broadcasting in the banned Czech language. The Bartoš Command and Communist groups met separately and both scheduled the armed uprising to begin 7 May. Czech citizens gathered in the streets, vandalised German inscriptions, and tore down German flags. Czechoslovak flags appeared openly in windows and on jacket lapels. Tram operators refused to accept Reichmarks or to give the stops in German, as was required by the occupiers. Some German soldiers were surrounded and killed. In response to growing popular agitation, Frank threatened to shoot Czechs gathering in the streets, and increased armed German patrols. Some German soldiers began to fire into the crowds.\n\nAround noon, the radio broadcast a series of appeals to the police and gendarmerie requesting aid in fighting SS guards inside the radio building. A detachment of Government Army policemen responded to the call, and met stiff resistance as they retook the building. During the entire time, the radio continued to broadcast. Although not directed at the populace, the appeal ignited fighting all over the city, concentrated in the downtown districts. Crowds of unarmed civilians, mostly young men with no military training, overwhelmed German garrisons and stores. Many casualties were inflicted by German soldiers and civilians sniping from strong-points or rooftops; in response, Czech forces began to intern Germans and suspected collaborators. Czech noncombatants assisted by setting up makeshift hospitals for the wounded and bringing food, water, and other necessities to the barricades, while German forces were often resorted to looting to obtain essential supplies. Czech forces seized thousands of firearms, hundreds of Panzerfausts, and five armoured vehicles, but still suffered a shortage of weapons.\n\nBy the end of the day, the resistance had seized most of the city east of the Vltava River. The insurgents held many important buildings, including the radio, the telephone exchange, most railway stations, and ten of twelve bridges. Three thousand prisoners were liberated from Pankrác Prison. By controlling the telephone exchange, resistance fighters were able to sever communication between German units and commanders. German forces held most of the territory to the west of the river, including an airfield at Ruzyně, northwest of the city, and various surrounded garrisons such as the Gestapo Headquarters.\n\nAt the orders of Field Marshal Ferdinand Schörner, in command of Axis forces in Bohemia, Waffen-SS units were pulled from fighting the Red Army and sent into Prague. The SS was relatively well-equipped with tanks, armoured carriers, weaponry and motorised units. Information on this force movement reached insurgent headquarters late in the day. The radio broadcast appeals in English and Russian for an air attack on the tanks.\n\nHearing of events in Prague, Patton asked for permission to advance to the Vltava in order to aid the Czech resistance, but Eisenhower refused. The Red Army was ordered to advance the launch of its offensive to 6 May.\n\nLate in the evening on 5 May, the radio broadcast an appeal to the people in the streets of Prague to build barricades in order to slow the anticipated German attack. Despite poor weather, tens of thousands of civilians worked overnight to construct over 1,600 barricades by morning. A total of 2,049 were constructed by the end of the uprising. \n\nSS General Carl Friedrich von Pückler-Burghauss ordered the Luftwaffe to firebomb Prague, but the attack had to be scaled back due to lack of fuel. The first strike was made by two Messerschmitt Me 262A jet fighter-bombers from elements of KG 51 at Ruzyně. One of their targets was the radio building, which was hit by a 250-kg bomb that disabled the transmitter. However, the radio continued to broadcast from alternate locations. In successive attacks, the Luftwaffe bombed barricades and hit apartment buildings with incendiary bombs, causing many civilian casualties.\n\nAt midday, the First Battalion of the ROA entered Prague and attacked the Germans; during its time in Prague, it disarmed around 10,000 German soldiers. An American reconnaissance patrol met with an ROA officer as well as Czech leaders. This was when the Czechs learnt of the demarcation line agreement and that the Third Army was not coming to liberate Prague. As a consequence, the Czech National Council, which had not been involved in negotiations with Bunyachenko, denounced the ROA. A Soviet liberation meant that they could not politically afford to endorse the ROA, whom Stalin considered traitors. Despite the rejection of the ROA, their aid to Prague became a point of friction between Moscow and Czechoslovakia after the war.\n\nUnder the terms of the provisional unconditional surrender, signed in the early hours of 7 May, German forces had a forty-eight-hour grace period to cease offensive operations. Eisenhower hoped that the capitulation would put an end to the fighting in Prague and therefore obviate American intervention. However, the German leadership was determined to use the grace period to move as many soldiers as possible westward to surrender to the Americans. Schörner denounced the rumours of a ceasefire in Prague and said that the truce did not apply to German forces fighting the Red Army or Czech insurgents. \n\nIn order to gain control of Prague's transportation network, the Germans launched their strongest attack of the uprising. Waffen-SS armoured and artillery units arriving in Prague gradually punched through the barricades with several tank attacks. Intense fighting was accompanied with the SS use of Czech civilians as human shields and damage to the Old Town Hall and other historic buildings. When the Bartoš Command learnt of the Rheims surrender, it ordered an immediate ceasefire for Czech forces. This caused some confusion among the defenders, who were also suffering from desertion due to the worsening military situation. The ROA played a decisive role in slowing the progress of the Germans, but withdrew from Prague over the afternoon and evening in order to surrender to the US Army. Only a few ROA units stayed in the city, departing late on 8 May. With the bulk of the ROA gone, the poorly armed and untrained Czech insurgents fared badly against the reinforced German forces. By the end of the day, German forces had taken much of the rebel-held territory east of the Vltava, with the resistance only holding a salient in the Vinohrady-Strašnice area. ROA forces captured the Luftwaffe airfield at Ruzyně, destroying several aircraft.\nIn the morning, the Germans made an air and artillery bombardment followed by a renewed infantry attack. The fighting was almost as intense as the previous day. One particularly fierce battle took place at the Masaryk train station. At 10 am, SS troops captured the station and murdered around 50 surrendered resistance fighters and noncombatants . In one of the last battles of the uprising, Czech insurgents regained the train station at 2 am on 9 May and photographed the victims' bodies.\n\nFaced with military collapse, no arriving Allied help, and threats to destroy the city, the Czech National Council agreed to negotiate with Wehrmacht General Rudolf Toussaint. Toussaint, running out of time to evacuate Wehrmacht units westward, was in an equally desperate position. After several hours of negotiations, it was agreed that on the morning of 9 May, the Czechs would allow German soldiers to pass westward through Prague, and in exchange German forces leaving the city would surrender their arms. A ceasefire was finally agreed to around midnight. However, some pockets of German forces were unaware of or disobeyed the ceasefire, and civilians feared a continuation of the German atrocities which had intensified over the previous two days. Late in the evening, reports reached Prague of the liberation of Theresienstadt concentration camp, northwest of the city, and the advance of the Red Army into other areas north of Prague.\n\nThe last of the German forces to escape Prague left in the early hours of the morning. At 4:00, elements of the 1st Ukrainian Front reached the suburbs of Prague. Fighting was mostly with isolated SS units that had been prevented from withdrawing by Czech insurgents. Over the next few hours, the Red Army quickly overcame the remaining German forces. Because most of the Germans had already left, the 1st Ukrainian Front avoided the house-to-house fighting that had occurred in the capture of Budapest and Vienna. The Red Army lost only ten soldiers in what has been described as their \"easiest victory\" of the war. At 8:00 am, the tanks reached the centre city and the radio announced the arrival of the Soviet forces. Czechs poured out into the streets to welcome the Red Army.\n\nGerman forces committed war crimes against Czech civilians throughout the uprising. Many people were killed in summary executions, and the SS used Czech civilians as human shields, forced them to clear barricades at gunpoint, and threatened to shoot hostages in revenge for German soldiers killed in action. When tanks were halted by barricades, they were known to fire into surrounding houses. After violently evicting or murdering the inhabitants, German soldiers looted and burned Czech houses and apartment buildings. On several occasions, more than twenty people were killed at once; most of the massacres occurred on 7 and 8 May. Among those killed were pregnant women and young children, and some of the dead were found mutilated. After the uprising, a Czech police report described war crimes committed by the SS:\n\nMost of the German war crimes were committed by the Waffen-SS. However, Luftwaffe soldiers, along with the SA, participated in the torture and murder of prisoners held at the Na Pražačce school.\n\nThe Czechoslovak government-in-exile planned to expel the German minority of Czechoslovakia in order to create an ethnically pure Czech-Slovak nation-state. Throughout the occupation, Czech politicians had broadcast messages from London calling for violence against German civilians and suspected Czech collaborators. President Edvard Beneš believed that vigilante justice would be less divisive than trials, and that encouraging Germans to flee would spare the effort of deporting them later. Before he arrived in Czechoslovakia, he broadcast that \"everyone who deserves death should be totally liquidated... in the popular storm\" and urged the resistance to avenge Nazi crimes \"a thousand times over.\" Minister of Justice asked resistance leaders to make liberation \"bloody\" for the Germans and to drive them out with violence. Communist leaders also supported the violence. Military leaders not only overlooked anti-German massacres and failed to punish the perpetrators, but actively encouraged them. The Czech Radio likely played a role in inciting the violence by passing on the anti-German messages of these political leaders, as well as broadcasting anti-German messages on its own initiative. Almost no one was prosecuted for violence against Germans, and a bill was proposed in the postwar parliament that would have retroactively legalised it.\n\nIn Prague, Czech insurgents murdered surrendered German soldiers and German civilians both before and after the arrival of the Red Army. Historian argues that there was no clear-cut distinction between the end of the uprising and the beginning of the expulsions. Some captured German soldiers were hung from lampposts and burned to death, or otherwise tortured and mutilated. Czech rioters also assaulted, raped, and robbed German civilians. Not all those killed or affected by anti-German violence were actually German or collaborators, as perpetrators frequently acted on suspicion, or exploited the chaos to settle personal grudges. In one massacre at Bořislavka on 10 May, forty German civilians were murdered. During and after the uprising, thousands of German civilians and surrendered soldiers were interned in makeshift camps where food and hygiene were poor. Survivors claimed that beatings and rape were commonplace. The violence against German civilians continued throughout the summer, culminating in the expulsion of Sudeten Germans. About three million Czechoslovak citizens of German ethnicity were stripped of their citizenship and property and forcibly deported.\n\nAs \"the greatest military action of the Czechs for freedom and national independence fought on their own territory,\" in the words of journalist , the Prague uprising became a national myth of the new Czechoslovak republic and the subject of much literature. \n\nThe Western Allies' failure to liberate Prague was seen as emblematic of their lack of concern for Czechoslovakia, first demonstrated by the Munich Agreement. It also served as a blow to democratic forces within the country who opposed Czechoslovakia's drift towards communism in the years after the war. It was not forgotten that Stalin had opposed the Munich Agreement, and Prague's liberation by the Red Army turned public opinion in favour of communism. Few Czechs were aware of the demarcation line agreement between the Western Allied and Soviet forces, allowing communists to accuse the American forces of \"having remained a cowardly or cynical onlooker while Prague was struggling for life,\" in the words of Hungarian historian Stephen Kertesz. According to British diplomat Sir Orme Sargent, the Prague uprising was the moment that \"Czechoslovakia was now definitely lost to the West.\"\n\nIn 1948, the democratic government of Czechoslovakia was toppled by a Communist coup d'état. Following the coup, Czechoslovakia became a communist state aligned with the Soviet Union until the Velvet Revolution in 1989. The Communist government attempted to discredit the Czech resistance, which was considered a threat to Communist legitimacy, by purging or arresting former resistance leaders, and distorting history, for instance overstating the role of the working class in the uprising and inflating the number of Red Army soldiers killed in Prague.\n\n\n"}

Harris has criticized this theory noting that it was never mentioned in any pre-modern source before. Instead, he notes that all the biographical information known about him- like his Turkic name \"Aydamir\", places of residence and native language- would make sense only when set against a Mamluk background.

The story is set in England as Sharpe looks for the missing Second Battalion of the South Essex Regiment needed in Spain to fight in the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nThe South Essex Regiment is in need of recruits so Nairn grants Sharpe permission to return to England to find if the regiment's second battalion has the men needed. Sharpe heads to the battalion headquarters with Harper, D'Alembord and Price and finds only a few wounded men but is told battalion recruiting parties have been seen, yet no-one knows where the recruits go.\n\nSharpe is then summoned before the Prince Regent where he meets Lord Simon Fenner, the secretary of state for war. Fenner has his mistress, Lady Anne Comoynes, seduce Sharpe to find out what he knows, and then sends two soldiers to kill him. Sharpe kills the two assassins and Sharpe's friend Maggie Joyce makes it look as though the bodies are those of Sharpe and Harper. They then join a South Essex recruiting party under assumed names. They are taken to a secret and brutal training camp in Foulness Island, run by the second battalion's commanding officer Lieutenant-Colonel Girdwood and the regiment's disgraced founder Sir Henry Simmerson. Sharpe learns that Fenner, Simmerson and Girdwood are secretly selling the recruits to other regiments after training them.\n\nHarper is sentenced to be hunted to death after he tries to prevent a would-be deserter being killed in cold blood. Sharpe rescues him and, with help from Simmerson's niece Jane Gibbons, they escape to London. Sharpe reports his findings to his former commander Sir William Lawford but Lawford tries to do a deal with Fenner which will see the matter covered up and Sharpe paid off with command of a regiment in the American wars. Lady Anne, who has been forced to prostitute herself to Fenner to pay off her late husband's debts, informs Sharpe. Sharpe and his friends take charge of the training camp from Girdwood but are unable to find evidence of the illegal sales. Instead, Sharpe takes the second battalion to London and presents them to the Prince Regent at Hyde Park, proving they exist.\n\nFenner and Simmerson attempt to have Sharpe court-martialled but are foiled when Lady Anne arrives, having found the incriminating ledgers. Fenner is forced to cancel Lady Anne's debts and give in to Sharpe's demands: A proper second battalion and training camp will be set up, while Sharpe will take the recruited soldiers, including Girdwood, back to Spain with him. He also takes Jane and marries her. At the Battle of the Nivelle, Girdwood, the regiment's nominal commander, suffers a complete nervous breakdown after his first experience of battle, leaving Sharpe in command until a new colonel is appointed.\n\nThe novel was adapted as the opening episode of the fourth season of the \"Sharpe\" television series.

He was restored to his unit on 2 May 1931. Lord Ashley was promoted to captain on 26 June 1937, and to major on 5 March 1938. On 5 January 1940, he was removed from the Wiltshire Yeomanry and placed on the general list of Yeomanry officers.\n\nMajor Lord Ashley was transferred to the Intelligence Corps on 22 July 1940, having requested to serve as a captain during World War II. He served with the Auxiliary Units, which were highly covert Resistance groups trained to engage and counteract the expected invasion of the United Kingdom by Nazi Germany. Members of the Auxiliary Unit were stationed in covert hidden bunkers scattered throughout Great Britain. While Major Lord Ashley was trained at Coleshill House near Highworth, Wiltshire, specific details regarding his assignments and operational base remain classified.\n\nOn 18 December 1941, he was transferred to the Territorial Army reserve of officers for the Royal Armoured Corps, Royal Tank Regiment. He was posthumously awarded the Efficiency Decoration.\n\nOn 24 December 1943, Lord Ashley was appointed an Officer of the Order of St John (OStJ).\n"}

His life was devoted to the study of geometry and reforming advanced mathematical teaching in Italy. His reputation mainly rests on his \"Introduzione ad una teoria geometrica delle curve piane\". He notably enriched our knowledge of algebraic curves and algebraic surfaces.\n\nLuigi Cremona was born in Pavia (Lombardy), then part of the Austrian-controlled Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia. His youngest brother was the painter Tranquillo Cremona.\n\nIn 1848, when Milan and Venice rose against Austria, Cremona, then only seventeen, joined the ranks of the Italian volunteers. He remained with them, fighting on behalf of his country's freedom, until, in 1849, the capitulation of Venice put an end to the campaign.\n\nHe then returned to Pavia, where he pursued his studies at the university under Francesco Brioschi, and determined to seek a career as teacher of mathematics. He graduated in 1853 as \"dottore negli studi di ingegnere civile e architetto\".\n\nCremona is noted for the important role he played in bringing about the great geometrical advances in Italy. While, at the beginning of the nineteenth century, Italy had very little mathematical standing, the end of the century found Italy in the lead along geometric lines, largely as a result of the work of Cremona. He was very influential in bringing about reforms in the secondary schools of Italy and became a leader in questions of mathematical pedagogy as well as in those relating to the advancement of knowledge. The mathematical advances which Italy made since the middle of the nineteenth century were largely guided by Cremona, Brioschi, and Beltrami. \n\nHis first appointment was as elementary mathematical master at the gymnasium and lyceum of Cremona, and he afterwards obtained a similar post at Milan. In 1860 he was appointed to the professorship of higher geometry at the University of Bologna, and in 1866 to that of higher geometry and graphical statics at the higher technical college of Milan. In this same year he competed for the Steiner Prize of the Berlin Academy, with a treatise entitled \"Memoria sulle superfici del terzo ordine\", and shared the award with J. C. F. Sturm. Two years later the same prize was conferred on him without competition.\n\nAs early as 1856 Cremona had begun to contribute to the \"Annali di scienze matematiche e fisiche\", and to the \"Annali di matematica\", of which he became afterwards joint editor. Papers by him appeared in the mathematical journals of Italy, France, Germany and England, and he published several important works, many of which have been translated into other languages. His manual \"Graphical Statics\" and his \"Elements of Projective Geometry\" (translated by Thomas Hudson Beare and C. Leudesdorf respectively) were published in English by the Clarendon Press.\n\nIn 1873 he was called to Rome to organize the Royal College of Engineering, and was also appointed professor of higher mathematics at the university. Cremona's reputation had now become European, and in 1879 he was elected a corresponding member of the Royal Society. In the same year he was made a senator of the Kingdom of Italy. In 1898 he was briefly Minister for Education. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences elected Cremona as member in 1901. The following year, he was awarded the German Pour le Mérite for Sciences and Arts.\n\nHe died in Rome in 1903.\n\n\n\n"}

His older brother, the late Vernon Bellecourt, was also active. Clyde was the seventh of 12 children born to his parents (Charles and Angeline) on the White Earth Indian Reservation in northern Minnesota.\n\nHis Ojibwe name is Nee-gon-we-way-we-dun which means \"Thunder Before the Storm.\"\n\nBellecourt's birthplace is occupied by the largest and poorest of northern Minnesota's Ojibwe bands.\n\nIn his youth, Clyde fought against the forces of authority, because he did not think they respected his family and other Indians. As a child, he could hear his parents speaking in low tones late at night in a language he did not understand. When he asked what they were saying, he was told to think about his education and do as well as he could. The years in school were not pleasant. As a boy, he attended a reservation mission school run strictly by Benedictine nuns.\n\nAfter the Bellecourt family moved to Minneapolis Twin Cities, the boy Clyde continued to act up in school, receiving detentions. He ultimately incurred more serious charges, resulting in a conviction and sentence to the adult correctional facility at St. Cloud. Clyde was arrested for a succession of offenses—including burglary and robbery. On his 25th birthday, he was transferred to Stillwater Prison in Stillwater, where he served out the remainder of his sentence.\n\nBellecourt helped found AIM in July 1968 with Dennis Banks and George Mitchell of the Leech Lake Reservation during a meeting. in Minneapolis. The meeting was held with the intention of raising awareness to issues American Indians faced in the Twins Cities and to discuss ideas how to solve those problems. Some of the issues discussed included police harassment, discrimination by employers, discrimination in school, poor housing, and unemployment. Bellecourt was elected the group's first chairman, Dennis Banks field director, and Charles Deegan vice chairman. They began to monitor arrests of American Indians made by the local police department to ensure their civil rights and treatment with dignity and respect.\n\nIn August 1972, Rosebud Reservation tribal chairman Robert Burnette brought forth the idea of a peaceful march on Washington, D.C., which became known as the Trail of Broken Treaties, in order to demand new legislation to remove the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) as an agency of the Department of the Interior. The group involved supported establishing a Federal Indian Commission, reporting directly to the president, in order to ensure that Indian interests were considered in all aspects. Organizers originally planned a peaceful tour of Washington landmarks and meeting with leading government officials to present their \"20 points,\" as a list of their grievances. The activists ended up storming and occupying the BIA Headquarters before beginning negotiations for their 20 points. They called for ending the corruption and mismanagement of the BIA. Bellecourt, along with other AIM leaders, led the negotiations with the federal government \n\nIn 1973 AIM activists were invited to the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota by its local civil rights organization to aid in securing better treatment from law enforcement in the border towns, which had been slow to prosecute attacks against Lakota. Protesting discrimination against the Lakota in border towns and the failed impeachment of the elected tribal chairman, Richard Wilson, AIM led an occupation of the Town of Wounded Knee, within the reservation. They were also protesting the poor living conditions on that reservation. FBI agents and U.S. Marshals soon surrounded the town. Bellecourt became a negotiator. Eventually, he, Russell Means, and Carter Camp held a meeting with a representative for the US President. They negotiated an audit of Wilson's operation of tribal finances and an investigation of abuses by his private militia, the Guardians of the Oglala Nation (GOONs).\n\nAfter leaving Pine Ridge, Bellecourt and Means were arrested in Pierre, South Dakota, with a bond set at $25,000. They were served a restraining order against approaching closer than five miles to the town of Wounded Knee. After being released on bond, Bellecourt went on a fundraising tour across the United States, trying to raise money for the activists still occupying Wounded Knee.\n\nAfter the occupation of Wounded Knee ended, Bellecourt hosted seminars and other public appearances. He claimed that, \"the seminar represents the beginning of an educational effort by AIM and a turning point for the organization, which hopes to avoid violent confrontations in the future.\" Throughout the rest of his speaking tour about Wounded Knee and the BIA takeover, Bellecourt would maintain that Christianity, the Office of Education, and the Federal Government were enemies to Indians. He defended AIM actions at the BIA and Wounded Knee, saying, \"We are the landlords of the country, it is the end of the month, the rent is due, and AIM is going to collect.\"\n\nIn January 1986, Bellecourt met with an undercover agent in a laundry room at Little Earth of United Tribes, a south Minneapolis housing development, and sold her LSD. Bellecourt was arrested, along with a group of Indian and non-Indian associates, in possession of an estimated $125,000 worth (5000 \"hits\") of LSD and other \"hard\" drugs (cocaine). Charged on eight counts of being a major drug distributor, each compounded by a conspiracy charge, Bellecourt accepted a plea bargain arrangement and confessed, entering a guilty plea to lesser felonies shortly thereafter. Federal District Judge Paul Magnuson sentenced him to only five years imprisonment (of which he served less than two).\n\nBellecourt lives in South Minneapolis. He continues to direct national and international AIM activities, is a coordinator of the National Coalition on Racism in Sports and the Media, and leads Heart of the Earth, Inc., an Interpretive Center located behind AIM's 40-year school site in Minneapolis.\n\nBellecourt founded the Heart of the Earth Survival School in 1972, which was approved for 501(c)(3) status in 1974. The passage of the American Indian Education Act provided possible yearly funding on a competitive basis, which Heart of the Earth was successful in winning for 24 years. It created a pre-school to grade 12 school. In the 1980s, it added adult learning and prison programs. Heart of the Earth has coordinated a national law education program.\n\nWhen it developed into an independent charter school in 1999, Heart of the Earth became the property owner. It continued to offer a wide variety of independent cultural programs, awarded scholarships to Indian students, and developed indigenous language research. The charter was revoked in 2008. The school ceased to exist after serious financial irregularities were discovered, including embezzlement. In all, over 10,000 students attended the school in its 40-year history.\n\nOther organizations founded in part by Bellecourt include the Elaine M. Stately Peacemaker Center for Indian youth; the AIM Patrol, which provides security for the Minneapolis Indian community; the Legal Rights Center; MIGIZI Communications, Inc.; the Native American Community Clinic; Women of Nations Eagle Nest Shelter; and Board of American Indian OIC (Opportunities Industrialization Center), a job program to help Native Americans get full-time jobs.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1846017", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1846017", "title": "Autopass", "text": "Autopass\n\nAutopass (stylized autoPASS) is an electronic toll collection system used in Norway. It allows collecting road tolls automatically from cars. It uses electronic radio transmitters and receivers operating at 5.8 GHz (MD5885) originally supplied by the Norwegian companies Q-Free and Fenrits. Since 2013 Kapsch and supplied the transponders. In 2016 the Norwegian Public Roads Administration revealed that they had chosen Norbit and Q-Free as suppliers of Autopass-transponders the next four years.\n\nWith an AutoPASS contract it is also possible to use the tag in Denmark and Sweden on ferries and bridges through the EasyGo partnership.\n\nIn 2019 more and more ferry crossings are also using Autopass as a payment option through the \"AutoPass for ferry\" concept. A few crossings are automatic, but most are still manual. If you have a tag you pay only for the vehicle at fully automatic crossings with a 10% discount. If you apply for an Autopass ferry account, which is prepaid, you get a 50%(40% corporate) discount for vehicle, and 17% for passengers at manual payment crossings. See https://www.autopassferje.no for more information. \n\nThe system involves the installation of a DSRC based radio transponder on the windscreen of a vehicle, and to sign an agreement with one of the toll collection companies in Norway. Tolls are charged at toll plazas and cars can drive past in over . The system is administrated by the Norwegian Public Roads Administration. All public toll roads but one in Norway use the system, in addition to tests for use of the system on some car ferries. The primary reason that some projects don't support Autopass is that they charge both for the car and for passengers, which the system cannot support. All projects using Autopass can only charge per car. The only manual toll road left is the Atlantic Ocean Tunnel.\n\nEach Autopass unit contains a microcontroller which will process requests from the road side, and respond with the proper information to the road side.\n\nThere are 5 generations of cryptographic key pairs inside each Autopass unit, which are unique for each unit. The cryptographic keys are used for authenticating the unit when passing a toll plaza, thus making it difficult to make fraudulent copies of an Autopass unit. Unlike similar DSRC based tolling systems used in many countries, there is no access control in the Norwegian system, the unique ID within the unit being available for those who have the proper DSRC equipment.\n\nThere is an internal storage space for 100 log entries, which are normally updated each time a vehicle owner is charged when passing a toll plaza. This is a collection of receipt entries which includes the time, date, and the station identity of the toll plaza which did the tolling transaction.\n\nEach Autopass unit features a move detect mechanism. When the unit is removed from the windscreen, an electrical switch will be activated, causing a flag to be set in a processor within the Autopass unit. This flag will be registered when doing a tolling transaction the next time the unit passes a toll plaza.\n\nAs of 1 January 2015 it is compulsory for all vehicles over which are registered to an enterprise, state, county, or municipal administration, or which are otherwise primarily used for business purposes, to have an electronic toll payment tag when driving in Norway. The provision has its legal basis in regulations that were adopted on 10 October 2014. It applies to all above-mentioned Norwegian and foreign vehicles on the entire public road network. Failure to carry a toll payment tag will result in a fine of 8,000 NOK. Failure to pay within three weeks means that the penalty charge will be increased to 12,000 NOK. If you are stopped twice without a tag within a period of two years, you will be fined 16,000 NOK.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1846022", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1846022", "title": "Rivers of Babylon", "text": "Rivers of Babylon\n\n\"Rivers of Babylon\" is a Rastafari song written and recorded by Brent Dowe and Trevor McNaughton of the Jamaican reggae group The Melodians in 1970. The lyrics are adapted from the texts of Psalms 19 and 137 in the Hebrew Bible. The Melodians' original version of the song appeared on the soundtrack album for the 1972 movie \"The Harder They Come\", which made it internationally known.\n\nThe song was re-popularised in Europe by the 1978 Boney M. cover version, which was awarded a platinum disc and is one of the top-ten all-time best-selling singles in the UK. The B-side of the single, \"Brown Girl in the Ring\", also became a hit.\n\nThe song is based on the Biblical Psalm 137:1-4, a hymn expressing the lamentations of the Jewish people in exile following the Babylonian conquest of Jerusalem in 586 BC: Previously the Kingdom of Judah, after being united under Kings David and Solomon, had been split in two, with the Kingdom of Israel in the north, conquered by the Assyrians in 722 BC which caused the dispersion of 10 of the 12 tribes of Israel. The southern Kingdom of Judah (hence the name Jews), home of the tribe of Judah and part of the tribe of Levi, was free from foreign domination until the Babylonian conquest to which Rivers of Babylon refers.\n\nThe namesake rivers of Babylon (in present-day Iraq) are the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. The song also has words from :\n\nIt is one of a few pop songs whose lyrics come directly from the Bible (See also \"Turn! Turn! Turn!\" by Pete Seeger, \"40\" by U2, and \"The Lord's Prayer\" by Sister Janet Mead). The melody bears a strong resemblance to \"How Dry I Am\".\n\nIn the Rastafarian faith, the term \"Babylon\" is used for any governmental system which is either oppressive or unjust. In Jamaica, Rastafarians also use \"Babylon\" to refer to the police, often seen as a source of oppression because they arrest members for the use of marijuana (which is sacramental for Rastafarians). Therefore, \"By the rivers of Babylon\" refers to living in a repressive society and the longing for freedom, just like the Israelites in captivity. Rastafarians also identify themselves as belonging to the Twelve Tribes of Israel. The original version specifically refers to Rastafarian belief in Haile Selassie, by changing references to \"the Lord\" in the Biblical text to \"Far-I\" and \"King Alpha\". Both terms refer to Selassie (Selassie's wife Menen Asfaw is known as \"Queen Omega\"). In addition, the term \"the wicked\" replaces the neutral \"they\" of Psalm 137 in the line \"they that carried us away captive required of us a song...\". According to David Stowe,\n\nBrent Dowe, the lead singer of the Melodians, told Kenneth Bilby that he had adapted Psalm 137 to the new reggae style because he wanted to increase the public's consciousness of the growing Rastafarian movement and its calls for black liberation and social justice. Like the Afro-Protestant Revival services, traditional Rastafarian worship often included psalm singing and hymn singing, and Rastas typically modified the words to fit their own spiritual conceptions; Psalm 137 was among their sacred chants.\n\nAfter its release in 1970, the song quickly became well known in Jamaica. According to Brent Dowe, the song was initially banned by the Jamaican government because \"its overt Rastafarian references ('King Alpha' and 'O Far-I') were considered subversive and potentially inflammatory\". Leslie Kong, the group's producer, attacked the government for banning a song with words taken almost entirely from the Bible, stating that the Psalms had been \"sung by Jamaican Christians since time immemorial\". The government lifted the ban. After that, it took only three weeks to become a number-one hit in the Jamaican charts.\n\nIt reached an international audience thanks to the soundtrack album of the 1972 film \"The Harder They Come\", which is credited with having \"brought reggae to the world\". The song was later used in the 1999 Nicolas Cage movie \"Bringing Out the Dead\" and the 2010 Philip Seymour Hoffman film \"Jack Goes Boating\".\n\nAn early reggae classic, \"Rivers of Babylon\" was remixed in 1970 in typical Jamaican dub fashion. One variation of the recording became \"Sound of Babylon\", another reggae classic featuring DJ/rapper Samuel The First, one of the Jamaican deejays who pioneered rap as early as the 1950s. \"Sound of Babylon\" includes several samples of the Melodians' original vocal as well as overdubbed mystical Rastafarian comments by Samuel The First. His version can be found on the 1988 CD \"Jamaican Deejay Music 1969-1973 – Keep On Coming Through the Door…\" (Trojan CDTRL255).\n\n\"Rivers of Babylon\" was covered in 1978 by Germany-based disco band Boney M., with a version that was released as a single. Boney M.'s release stayed at the no. 1 position in the UK for five weeks and was also the group's only significant US chart entry, peaking at no. 30 in the Pop charts. Boney M.'s version of the song remains one of the top ten all-time best-selling singles in the UK, where it is one of only seven songs to have sold over 2 million copies. In Canada, the song was a top 25 hit on the \"RPM\" magazine's Top 100 singles chart and reached no. 9 on the Adult Contemporary chart. The song also reached No. 1 on the South African Springbok chart, where it remained for a total of 11 weeks, making it the No. 1 song on that country's year end charts. The song was the first single from the band's equally successful 1978 album, \"Nightflight to Venus\". Some controversy arose when the first single pressings only credited Frank Farian and Reyam (aka Hans-Jörg Mayer) of Boney M.; after an agreement with Dowe and McNaughton, these two were also credited on later pressings.\n\nThe Rastafarian language was excised from the lyrics for the Boney M. version. Although the group performed an early mix of the song on a German TV show and sang \"How can we sing King Alpha's song\" as in the Melodians version, it was changed to \"the Lord's song\", restoring the original, biblical words, in the versions that were to be released. To fit the meter, \"O Far-I\" became \"here tonight\" rather than the original, biblical \"O Lord\".\n\nAlong with \"Ma Baker\", \"Rivers of Babylon\" helped establish what was to become a habit of Boney M. singles – namely that the original pressings featured an early version that was soon replaced by a more widely available mix.\n\nThe initial single mix of \"Rivers of Babylon\" is most notable for lead singer Liz Mitchell's ad-libs (\"Dark tears of Babylon, you got to sing a song, sing a song of love, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah\") between the two verses. On subsequent single pressings, only the 'yeah's were retained. However, the full ad-libs re-emerged in the US-only 12\" version.\n\nThe single mix differs from the album version by having Liz Mitchell singing all of the verse \"\"Let the words of our mouth ...\"\" with Frank Farian; on the LP, Farian sings the first half of this as a solo part. Additionally, the single version edits out the instrumental passage before the last \"humming\" part and fades out a little later (\"\"Oooooh, have the power... yeah yeah yeah yeah\"\" can only be heard in full in the single mix) despite being slightly shorter overall.\n\nThe single's B-side, \"Brown Girl in the Ring\", was a traditional Caribbean nursery rhyme. When \"Rivers of Babylon\" had slipped to no. 20 in the UK charts, radio stations suddenly flipped the single, causing \"Brown Girl in the Ring\" to go all the way to no. 2 and become a hit in its own right. Early single pressings feature the full-length, 4:18 version, whose final chorus has a section that was later edited out. The single mix is also slightly different from the album version in that the latter features steel drums on the outro riff of the song, while the single mix doesn't.\n\n\"Brown Girl in the Ring\" was also issued separately in Canada as an A-side in the summer of 1979. It reached no. 8 on the Canadian AC chart in July 1979, becoming the third Boney M. song to reach the top 10 on that chart after \"Rivers of Babylon\" and \"Rasputin\". On \"RPM\"'s Top 100 singles chart, the song stalled at no. 79.\n\nLiz Mitchell had previously recorded \"Brown Girl in the Ring\" in 1975 with the group Malcolm's Locks, which had her ex-boyfriend Malcolm Magaron as the lead singer. Arranger Peter Herbolzheimer accused Frank Farian of stealing his arrangement for the song. The court case ran for more than 20 years in Germany.\n\n\"Rivers of Babylon\" / \"Mary's Boy Child\" / \"Oh My Lord\" was a 1988 remix single issued to launch the group's reunion. (Boney M. had split up in 1986, their 10th anniversary.) The double-A-side single contained new mixes of the band's two most successful single releases ever. Although the remix album from which both sides of the single were taken sold well, the single failed to chart.\n\nThe song was parodied by The Barron Knights in their UK comedy hit \"A Taste of Aggro\" (1978), in which the lyrics are changed to \"There's a dentist in Birmingham, he fixed my crown / And as I slept, he filled my mouth with iron.\" The song was their biggest hit, reaching no. 3 in the UK charts.\n\nThe Unitarian Universalist Association has included the song in their supplemental hymnal \"Singing the Journey\" (Hymn #1042). On 19 November 1978, a cover version with lyrics in Swedish, \"Kommer du ihåg Babylon?\" (\"Do you remember Babylon?\"), performed by Swedish dansband Schytts entered the first place on Svensktoppen. where it stayed for 10 weeks up to 14 January 1979.\n\nOn 30 September 1979, \"Rivers of Babylon\" was sung by an estimated crowd of 280,000 people attending the papal visit of John Paul II in Galway near Limerick, Ireland.\n\nThe song features prominently in the 2009 Kazakh film \"Tulpan\".\n\n"}

The optical shop at Mount Wilson Observatory manufactured the first one during World War II as part of their research into optical designs for the military. As in the Schmidt camera, this design uses a spherical primary mirror and a Schmidt corrector plate to correct for spherical aberration. In this Cassegrain configuration the convex secondary mirror acts as a field flattener and relays the image through the perforated primary mirror to a final focal plane located behind the primary. Some designs include additional optical elements (such as field flatteners) near the focal plane. The first large telescope to use the design was the James Gregory Telescope of 1962 at the University of St Andrews.\n\nAs of 2018, the James Gregory Telescope is also recognised as the largest Schmidt-Cassegrain. The telescope is noted for its large field of view, up 60 times a full moon. \nThe Schmidt–Cassegrain design is very popular with consumer telescope manufacturers because it combines easy-to-manufacture spherical optical surfaces to create an instrument with the long focal length of a refracting telescope with the lower cost per aperture of a reflecting telescope. The compact design makes it very portable for its given aperture, which adds to its marketability. Their high f-ratio means they are not a wide-field telescope like their Schmidt camera predecessor, but they are good for more narrow-field deep sky and planetary viewing.\n\nWhile there are many variations, (both mirrors spherical, both mirrors aspherical, or one of each) they can be divided into two principal design forms: compact and non-compact. In the compact form, the corrector plate is located at or near the focus of the primary mirror. In the non-compact, the corrector plate remains at or near the center of curvature (twice the focal length) of the primary mirror. Typical examples of the compact design are Celestron and Meade Instruments commercial instruments, combining a fast primary mirror and a small, strongly curved secondary. This yields a very short tube length, at the expense of field curvature. Most compact designs from Meade and Celestron have a primary mirror with a focal ratio of f/2 and a secondary with a focal ratio of f/5 yielding a system focal ratio of f/10. One notable exception is the Celestron C9.25, which has a primary focal ratio of f/2.3 and a secondary focal ratio of f/4.3, the result being a slightly flatter field and a slightly longer tube aspect ratio than most other compact designs.\n\nNon-compact designs keep the corrector at the center of curvature of the primary mirror. One very well-corrected design example would be the concentric (or monocentric) Schmidt–Cassegrain, where all the mirror surfaces and the focal surface are concentric to a single point: the center of curvature of the primary. Optically, non-compact designs often yield better aberration correction and a flatter field than a compact design, but at the expense of longer tube length.\n\n"}

She is recognized as a saint by the Catholic Church, and is inscribed in the General Roman Calendar, for optional celebration throughout the Roman Rite as a memorial, on November 16.\n\nLittle is known of the early life of Gertrude. Gertrude was born on the Feast of the Epiphany, January 6, 1256, in Eisleben, Thuringia (within the Holy Roman Empire). At the age of four, she entered the monastery school at the monastery of St. Mary at Helfta (with much debate having occurred as to whether this monastery is best described as Benedictine or Cistercian), under the direction of its abbess, Gertrude of Hackeborn. It is speculated that she was offered as a child oblate to the Church by devout parents. Given that Gertrude implies in the \"Herald\" that her parents were long dead at the time of writing, however, it is also possible that she entered the monastery school as an orphan.\n\nGertrude was confided to the care of Mechtilde, younger sister of the Abbess Gertrude, and joined the monastic community in 1266. It is clear from her own writings that she received a thorough education in a range of subjects. She, and the nun who authored Books 1 and 3-5 of the \"Herald\", are thoroughly familiar with scripture, the Church Fathers such as Augustine and Gregory the Great, and also in more contemporary spiritual writers such as Richard and Hugh of St Victor, William of St Thierry, and Bernard of Clairvaux. Moreover, Gertrude's writing demonstrates that she was well-versed in rhetoric, and her Latin is very fluent.\n\nIn 1281, at the age of 25, she experienced the first of a series of visions that continued throughout her life, and which changed the course of her life. Her priorities shifted away from secular knowledge and toward the study of Scripture and theology. Gertrude devoted herself strongly to personal prayer and meditation, and began writing spiritual treatises for the benefit of her monastic sisters. Gertrude became one of the great mystics of the 13th century. Together with her friend and teacher Mechtild, she practiced a spirituality called \"nuptial mysticism,\" that is, she came to see herself as the bride of Christ.\n\nGertrude died at Helfta, near Eisleben, Saxony, around 1302. Her feast day is celebrated on November 16, but the exact date of her death is unknown; the November date stems from a confusion with Abbess Gertrude of Hackeborn.\n\nGertrude produced numerous writings, though only some survive today. The longest survival is the \"Legatus Memorialis Abundantiae Divinae Pietatis \"(known in English today as \"The Herald of Divine Love \"or \"The Herald of God's Loving-Kindness\", and sometimes previously known as \"Life and Revelations\"), partly written by other nuns. There also remains her collection of \"Spiritual Exercises. \"A work known as \"Preces Gertrudianae \"(\"Gertrudian Prayers\") is a later compilation, made up partly of extracts from the writings of Gertrude and partly of prayers composed in her style. It is also very possible that Gertrude was the author of a part of the revelations of Mechthild of Hackeborn, the \"Book of Special Grace\".\n\nThe \"Herald\" is composed of five books. Book 2 forms the core of the work, and was written by Gertrude herself; she states that she began the work on Maundy Thursday 1289. Books 3, 4, and 5 were written by another nun, or possibly more than one, during Gertrude's lifetime and probably at least in part at her dictation. Book 1 was written shortly before or after Gertrude's death as an introduction to the whole collection; it is possible it was written by Gertrude's confessor, but far more like that the author was another Helfta nun.\n\nThe importance of the \"Spiritual Exercises\" extends to the present day because they are grounded in the themes and rites of Catholic Liturgy for occasions of Baptism, conversion, commitment, discipleship, union with God, praise of God, and preparation for death. Gertrude's \"Spiritual Exercises\" can still be used by anyone who seeks to deepen spirituality through prayer and meditation.\n\nOne of the most esteemed woman saints of the Christian West, she was a notable early devotee of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. Book 2 of the \"Herald of Divine Love\" is notable within the history of Christian devotion because its vivid descriptions of Gertrude's visions show a considerable elaboration on the long-standing but ill-defined veneration of Christ's Heart. This veneration was present in the belief that Christ's Heart poured forth a redemptive Fountain through the Wound in His side; an image culminating in its most famous articulation by Bernard of Clairvaux in his commentary on the Song of Songs. The women of Helfta—Gertrude foremost, who surely knew Bernard's commentary, and to a somewhat lesser extent the two Mechthilds - Mechthild of Magdeburg and Mechthild of Hackeborn — made this devotion central to their mystical visions. Gertrude had a vision on the Feast of John the Evangelist. She was resting her head near the Wound in the Savior's Side and hearing the Beating of the Divine Heart. She asked John if on the night of the Last Supper, he had felt these Pulsations, why he had never spoken of the fact. John replied that this revelation had been reserved for subsequent ages when the world, having grown cold, would have need of it to rekindle its love.\n\nAfter her death, Gertrude's works seem to have vanished almost without trace. Only five manuscripts of the \"Herald\" have survived, the earliest one being written in 1412, and only two of these manuscripts are complete. With the invention of printing, Gertrude became far more prominent, with Latin, Italian and German editions being published in the sixteenth century. She was popular in seventeenth-century France, where her trust in and burning love for God were potent antidotes to Jansenism.\n\nPhilip Neri and Francis de Sales both used her prayers and recommended them to others.\n\nIn Spain, Bishop Diego of Tarragona, the confessor to Philip II, read the revelations of Gertrude aloud to the king as he lay dying in the Escorial.\n\nHer works were also popular with the Discalced Carmelites in the sixteenth century. Francisco Ribera, the confessor to Teresa of Ávila, recommended her to take Gertrude as spiritual mistress and guide.\n\nMore recently, Dom Prosper Guéranger, the restorer of Benedictine monasticism in France, was influenced by Gertrude. His Congregation of Solesmes was responsible for most of the work done on Gertrude in the nineteenth century.\n\nGertrude was never formally canonized, but a liturgical office of prayer, readings, and hymns in her honor was approved by Rome in 1606. The Feast of St. Gertrude was extended to the Catholic Church by Clement XII and today is celebrated on November 16, the date of her death. Some religious communities, including the Benedictines, celebrate her feast on November 17. Pope Benedict XIV gave her the title \"the Great\" to distinguish her from Abbess Gertrude of Hackeborn and to recognize the depth of her spiritual and theological insight.\n\nGertrude showed \"tender sympathy towards the souls in purgatory\" and urged prayers for them. She is therefore invoked for suffering souls in purgatory. The following prayer is attributed to St. Gertrude, and is often depicted on her Prayer card:\n\nPerhaps for that reason, her name has been attached to a prayer that, according to a legend of uncertain origin and date (neither are found in the \"Revelations of Saint Gertrude the Great\"), Christ promised to release a thousand souls from purgatory each time it was said; despite the fact that practices relative to alleged promises to free one or more souls from purgatory by the recitation of some prayer were prohibited by Pope Leo XIII. Nonetheless, the material that is found in her \"Revelations,\" such as the celebration of Gregorian Masses for the departed, is well in line with the devotions approved by the Catholic Church.\n\nIn compliance with a petition from King Philip IV of Spain she was declared Patroness of the West Indies; in Peru her feast is celebrated with great pomp, and in New Mexico the town Santa Gertrudis de lo de Mora was built in her honor and bears her name.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Ettlingen is the second largest town in the district of Karlsruhe, after Bruchsal.\n\nEttlingen is situated at the northern edge of the Black Forest on the Upper Rhine Plain. The Alb River arises in the hills of the Black Forest and flows through Ettlingen before emptying into the Rhine at Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen, making Ettlingen a central feature of the \"Albtal\", the Alb Valley. Central Ettlingen and its largest constituent communities (Bruchhausen, Ettlingenweier, Oberweier) lie on the plain itself, but some of the villages (Spessart, Schöllbronn, and Schluttenbach) are nestled among the northernmost foothills of the Black Forest.\n\nThe municipality of Ettlingen is bordered by the following communities, clockwise from the north: Karlsruhe, Waldbronn, Karlsbad (Baden), Marxzell, Malsch, and Rheinstetten, all of which belong to the district of Karlsruhe, except for the independent city of Karlsruhe itself.\n\nSince the major communal reforms enacted by Baden-Württemberg in the early 1970s, the municipality of Ettlingen has consisted of the town of Ettlingen itself and the communities of Bruchhausen, Ettlingenweier, Oberweier, Schluttenbach, Schöllbronn, and Spessart.\n\nEttlingen was an important crossroads during Roman times, when the region was part of the province of Germania Superior. This is demonstrated by the many artifacts found in the area, including the \"Neptune Stone,\" which commemorates a flood of the Rhine, and the remains of a Roman bath excavated beneath St. Martin's Church. The town was first mentioned in 788 as \"Ediningom\" in a deed of donation belonging to Weissenburg Abbey in Alsace (now in France). In 965, the village of Ettlingen (\"Ediningom\") received market rights (\"Marktrecht\") from Emperor Otto the Great. In 1192, Emperor Henry VI, one of Frederick Barbarossa's sons. Margrave Herman V of Baden-Baden became Ettlingen's feudal lord in 1219. In the following centuries, Ettlingen developed into an important administrative centre within the Margraviate of Baden-Baden.\n\nEttlingen gave its name to a line of defensive earthworks known as the Ettlingen Line built to deter French aggression.\nDuring the Nine Years' War the town was nearly completely burned to the ground by the troops of Louis XIV, but was nevertheless rebuilt in the following decades under Margravine Sibylle Auguste. After the Catholic line of Baden-Baden died out in 1771, Ettlingen passed to the Protestant Margraviate of Baden-Durlach, which would become the reunited Margraviate of Baden. During the French Revolutionary Wars, Ettlingen was the site of a battle between elements of the French Army of the Rhine and Moselle and the Habsburg Army of the Upper Rhine on 9 July 1796. In the period of Napoleon's activities in Germany, Margrave Karl Friedrich of Baden was made Elector in 1806 and Grand Duke in 1806.\n\nEttlingen remained an independent town until 1937, when it was incorporated into the administrative unit that would become the district of Karlsruhe in 1939. Ettlingen and its surrounding villages and land continue to be part of this district.\n\nIn 1966, Ettlingen passed the 20,000 population mark and raised to the status of \"Große Kreisstadt\" by the state government of Baden-Württemberg. During the communal reforms of the early 1970s, several smaller communities were incorporated into Ettlingen, raising the population to over 30,000. Ettlingen's renowned open-air theater series, the \"Schlossfestspiele\" first took the stage in the Baroque inner courtyard of Ettlingen Palace in 1979.\n\nEttlingen was originally a part of the ancient Diocese of Speyer and was under the pastoral care of the Archdeacon of St. German and Moritz in Speyer. The town originally belonged to the deanery of Durlach but was itself made archdeaconate in the 16th century. The Protestant Reformation made gains in Ettlingen as early as 1520, but the town remained mostly Catholic, and the town's Catholic majority was supported by the Catholic line of Baden-Baden; later, starting in 1624, the Jesuits played an active role in converting many of the town's inhabitants back to the Catholic faith. By the beginning of the 19th century, Protestants were a small minority. \nDuring the period of secularization following the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire, Ettlingen was part of the ordinariate of Bruchsal. In 1821, it became part of the newly founded Archdiocese of Freiburg, and the town was made the seat of a deanery, which included not only the parishes within Ettlingen proper, but also those in surrounding villages and neighboring municipalities. Today, Ettlingen belongs to the deanery of Karlsruhe, with the various parishes organized into pastoral units (\"Seelsorgeeinheiten\"). These include Ettlingen Stadt, with the parishes Herz Jesu (Sacred Heart), Liebfrauen (Our Lady), and St. Martin's, the town's oldest church; Ettlingen South, with St. Dionysius' in Ettlingenweier, St. Wendelin's in Oberweier, and St. Joseph's in Bruchhausen; and Ettlingen Heights, with St. George's in Völkersbach, St. Boniface's in Schöllbronn, and St. Anthony's in Spessart, although Völkersbach belongs politically to the municipality of Malsch.\n\nJewish families lived in Ettlingen since at least the 17th century. They lived primarily in Färbergasse ('Dyers' Alley), which was formerly known as \"Judengasse\" (Jews' Alley). Ettlingen's first synagogue was built on Albstraße in 1849, only to be torn down again when a new synagogue was built on Pforzheimerstraße and dedicated in 1889. The \"New Synagogue\" was itself destroyed during the infamous \"Kristallnacht\" pogrom of November 1938. Most of the remaining Jewish citizens of Ettlingen were deported soon thereafter as part of the Nazi \"Final Solution.\"\n\nProtestants (Lutherans), most of whom had moved to Ettlingen since the early 19th century, were first administered from Rüppurr, but in 1848 they received their own clergyman, and in 1869 their own parish (\"Johannesgemeinde\" - Congregation of St. John), which soon got its own church, the oldest Protestant church in Ettlingen. The \"Johannesgemeinde\" belonged to the city deanery of Karlsruhe at first, but was later transferred over to the deanery of Alb-Pfinz with its seat in Pfinztal. The congregation continued to grow and was eventually divided in 1951, creating the \"Paulusgemeinde\" (Congregation of St. Paul). The \"Paulusgemeinde\" had a parish hall built in 1953, adding a bell tower in 1965. The \"Paulusgemeinde\" was split up in 1972 to create the \"Luthergemeinde\" (Luther Congregation), which caters to the Protestants of Ettlingen West, Bruchhausen, Ettlingenweier, and Oberweier. From 1969 to 2003, Ettlingen was the seat of the Evangelical (Lutheran) Church in Baden's district of Central Baden. However, in the wake of efforts to save money, this district was dissolved and Ettlingen incorporated into the district of North Baden.\n\nAlongside the two major churches, there are also a few free churches and congregations, including a Free Evangelical congregation and the Liebenzell Congregation. The Jehovah's Witnesses, the New Apostolic Church, and a small Jewish community are also represented in Ettlingen.\n\nEttlingen is twinned with:\n\n\nEttlingen is the location of Rheinland Kaserne. Formerly a German Army base, for many years after World War II Rheinland Kaserne was the home of several U.S. Army units and many Americans. In the mid-nineties, the U.S. Army handed the barracks back to Germany. It is now home to a private school, medical offices, a vehicle registration centre, new housing and the \"Kulisse\" movie theatre.\n\nAmong the U.S. Army units based in Rheinland Kaserne were the 78th Engineer Battalion and 44th Signal Battalion.\n\nTrains on lines S1 and S11 of the Stadtbahn Karlsruhe call at the stops Ettlingen Erbprinz/Schloss, Ettlingen Wasen and Ettlingen Stadt. These lines operated over the Alb Valley Railway, an electric railway that links Karlsruhe to Bad Herrenalb (S1) and Ittersbach (S11). The town is also served by several buses run by the Karlsruher Verkehrsverbund, with routes serving various neighbourhoods of Ettlingen, as well as more distant destinations like Durlach.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The scope of the novel is vast; it is divided into six parts and the illustrations are also more sophisticated. It won the Newbery Medal for 1923.\n\nIt was one of the novels in the series that was adapted into the film \"Doctor Dolittle\".\n\nThe novel begins when Tommy Stubbins, the narrator of the story, finds a squirrel injured by a hawk. Matthew Mugg, the cat's meat man, informs him to get help from Doctor Dolittle, who can speak the language of animals. The Doctor is away on a voyage, but when he returns, he attends to the squirrel. Tommy is introduced to some of the strange animals in Dolittle's care, such as the Wiff-Waff fish, and those who care for his household, such as Dab-Dab the duck, and Jip the dog. Polynesia the parrot arrives in Puddleby from Africa informs the Doctor that Bumpo is studying in Bullford. Tommy begins his studies with Doolittle, or rather with Polynesia who teaches Tommy the language of animals. Chee-Chee comes from Africa disguised as a lady and tells about his voyage to Puddleby. The Doctor acquires The Curlew and is thinking of taking Tommy, Polynesia, and Luke the Hermit. They find out from the hermit's dog, Bob, that he was sent to prison for murder but Bob is a witness so when the court is in the process the Doctor proves to the judge that he\ncan talk to animals when this is settled he translates Bob's story to English.

The Doctor, Tommy, Bumpo, and Polynesia start the voyage across the sea but on the way they discover some stowaways and drop them off at Penzance. Their first stop is in the Capa Blanca islands of Spain; the Doctor makes a deal with the bullfighters that if he can beat them in a fight they would stop bullfighting. Bumpo makes a side bet of 3000 pesetas that the Doctor will win. The Doctor talks to the bulls and they agreed to stick to the plan to make everyone think that he outwitted them. When the fight is over and the doctor wins against the other bullfighters, the crew set off again the Doctor shows Tommy he has\ncaught a fidgit that talks English so he consults it and realizes that if he goes deeper, he will find the Great Glass Sea Snail.\n\nAfterwards there is a storm that wrecks the ship leaving Tommy alone; the Purple Bird of Paradise tells him that his friends are on Spider Monkey Island so with the help of the porpoises Tommy reaches the island and the crew. Doolittle finds out from catching a Jabizri, a rare beetle, that Long Arrow is stuck inside Hawk's Head Mountain so they try to find an opening but fail so they use the Jabizri to locate it. When they find a slab in the mountain they dig under it until it collapses and Long Arrow is free.

The album, along with the single of the same name, established the band as an internationally successful act, and was influential in originating the musical style known as folk rock. The term was, in fact, first coined by the American music press to describe the band's sound in mid-1965, around the same time as the \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" single reached the top of the \"Billboard\" chart. The single and album also represented the first effective American challenge to the dominance of the Beatles and the British Invasion during the mid-1960s.\n\nThe album peaked at number six on the \"Billboard\" Top LPs chart and reached number seven in the United Kingdom. The Bob Dylan penned \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" single was released ahead of the album in April 1965, reaching number one on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart. The second single \"All I Really Want to Do\", also a Dylan cover, was moderately successful in the US, but fared better in the UK, where it reached the top ten.\n\nPrior to forming the Byrds in 1964, most of the members of the band had come from a folk and roots music background, rather than a rock and roll one. Lead guitarist Jim McGuinn had been a solo folk singer and sideman with various professional folk groups, as had singer and songwriter Gene Clark. Clark and McGuinn first met in early 1964 at The Troubadour folk club in Los Angeles and, after discovering a mutual love of the Beatles, formed a Peter and Gordon-style duo, playing Beatles' covers, Beatlesque renditions of traditional folk songs, and some self-penned material. The duo soon added another folk singer, David Crosby, to the line-up and named themselves the Jet Set. Over the coming months, bass player Chris Hillman, whose musical background was more oriented towards bluegrass music than folk, and drummer Michael Clarke were both added to the group. The Jet Set were signed to Columbia Records on November 10, 1964, and changed their name to the Byrds over Thanksgiving that year. \n\nOn January 20, 1965, the band, along with a group of L.A. session musicians later known as the Wrecking Crew, entered Columbia Recording Studios in Hollywood to record the Bob Dylan song \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" as their debut single. Released in April 1965, with the Clark-penned song \"I Knew I'd Want You\" on its B-side, the single was an immediate hit, reaching number 1 on both the U.S. \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart and the UK Singles Chart. In addition, the electric rock band treatment that the Byrds and producer Terry Melcher had given \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" effectively created the template for the musical subgenre of folk rock. \n\nAlthough the band's musicianship improved following the recording of their debut single, it was assumed by both Columbia and the band's management that their entire debut album would be recorded with session musicians. The band, however, had other ideas and insisted that they be allowed to perform the album's instrumental accompaniment themselves. By the start of recording sessions for the album, Melcher felt satisfied that the group had polished their sound enough to be able to produce professional sounding backing tracks and the Byrds were allowed to record the rest of the \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" album without any help from session musicians. However, a persistent and widely circulated rumor about the album is that all of the playing on it was done by session musicians. This misconception is likely due to confusion between the \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" single and the album of the same name. Hillman has stated that the contrast between the more polished sound of the two tracks featuring session musicians (\"Mr. Tambourine Man\" and \"I Knew I'd Want You\") and the sound of the rest of the album is quite noticeable. Recording was completed on April 22, 1965.\n\nFor the most part, \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" consisted of two types of songs: band originals, primarily penned by Clark, who was the group's main songwriter during its first eighteen months of existence, and covers of modern folk songs, composed primarily by Dylan. The album opens with its Dylan-penned title track, which had been a big international hit for the group, prior to the album's release. Band biographer Johnny Rogan has commented that the two most distinctive features of the Byrds' rendition of \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" are the vocal harmonies of Clark, McGuinn and Crosby, and McGuinn's jangling twelve-string Rickenbacker guitar playing (which complemented the phrase \"jingle jangle morning\" found in the song's lyric). This combination of 12-string guitar work and complex harmony singing became the band's signature sound during their early period. Music critic Richie Unterberger has also remarked that the success of the Byrds version of \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" saw an explosion of Byrds imitators and emulators having hits on the American and British charts during 1965 and 1966.\n\nAnother Dylan cover, \"All I Really Want to Do\", was the first song to be recorded for the album, following the \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" and \"I Knew I'd Want You\" session. Melcher felt confident that the band's then-unissued debut single would be, at the very least, a regional hit and so he brought the Byrds back into the studio on March 8, 1965 to record a follow-up. This March 8 recording session yielded the version of \"All I Really Want to Do\" that appears on the album, but the song was re-recorded on April 14, and it was this later take that graced the A-side of the band's second Columbia single release.\n\nThe abundance of Dylan material on the album—with three songs taken from the \"Another Side of Bob Dylan\" album alone—led to accusations of the band being too reliant on his material. However, the Dylan covers, including \"Chimes of Freedom\", \"All I Really Want to Do\", and \"Spanish Harlem Incident\", in addition to the title track, remain among the Byrds' best-known recordings.\n\nAnother cover which stressed the band's folk music roots was Idris Davies and Pete Seeger's \"The Bells of Rhymney\". The song, which told the sorrowful tale of a coal mining disaster in Wales, was a relative newcomer to the band's repertoire at the time of recording, having only been worked up in March 1965, during the Byrds' residency at Ciro's nightclub on the Sunset Strip. Although the song had a somewhat sombre theme, it became one of the band's most popular numbers during their residency at Ciro's. The band's cover of \"The Bells of Rhymney\" was also influential on the Beatles, particularly George Harrison, who co-opted McGuinn's guitar riff and incorporated it into his composition \"If I Needed Someone\" from the \"Rubber Soul\" album.\nOf the band originals, three were penned solely by Clark. \"I'll Feel a Whole Lot Better\" is an uptempo song, with pounding tambourine, jangling Rickenbacker and criss-crossing vocals, featuring Clark singing lead, while McGuinn and Crosby provided backing vocals. The song bore a passing resemblance to the Searchers' 1963 hit \"Needles and Pins\" and has, since its release, become a rock music standard, inspiring a number of cover versions over the years.\n\nClark's melancholy, mid-tempo ballad \"Here Without You\" details a bittersweet trip through the city, in which every landmark and physical object reminds the singer of an absent lover, while the aforementioned \"I Knew I'd Want You\" is a Beatlesque, minor key 6/8 shuffle, recounting of the first flushes of romance. Although \"I Knew I'd Want You\" had been recorded as the intended B-side of the Byrds' debut single, Rogan notes that, had the band failed to secure permission to release their version of \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" from Dylan and his manager Albert Grossman, \"I Knew I'd Want You\" might well have been issued as the group's first Columbia A-side. Another two songs on the album were co-written by Clark and McGuinn: \"You Won't Have to Cry\", which featured a lyric concerned with a woman who has been wronged in love, and \"It's No Use\", which anticipated the harder-edged, psychedelic sound that the band would begin to explore towards the end of 1965 and throughout 1966.\n\nThe band also covered two non-folk songs on the album: \"Don't Doubt Yourself, Babe\" by Jackie DeShannon, who was an early supporter of the band, and Vera Lynn's World War II era standard, \"We'll Meet Again\". Rogan has stated his opinion that the band gave the latter a very sardonic reading, influenced by the song's appearance in the final scene of Stanley Kubrick's movie \"Dr. Strangelove\". This treatment of \"We'll Meet Again\", sequenced at the end of the album, began a tradition of closing the Byrds' albums with a tongue-in-cheek or unusual track, a policy that would be repeated on several subsequent LPs.\n\nThe album's distinctive front cover fisheye lens photograph of the band was taken by Barry Feinstein at the bird sanctuary in Griffith Park. According to author Christopher Hjort, it has become an acknowledged classic since its release. The back cover featured liner notes, written in the form of an open letter to a friend, by Columbia Records' publicist Billy James. In addition, the back cover also featured a black and white photograph, taken by the Byrds' manager Jim Dickson, of the band on stage with Bob Dylan at Ciro's nightclub in L.A.\n\n\"Mr. Tambourine Man\" was released on June 21, 1965 in the United States (catalogue item CL 2372 in mono, CS 9172 in stereo) and August 20, 1965 in the UK (catalogue item BPG 62571 in mono, SBPG 62571 in stereo). It peaked at number 6 on the \"Billboard\" Top LPs chart, during a chart stay of 38 weeks, and reached number 7 in the United Kingdom, spending a total of 12 weeks on the UK albums chart. The preceding single of the same name was released on April 12, 1965 in the U.S. and May 15, 1965 in the UK, reaching number 1 on both the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart. A second single taken from the album, \"All I Really Want to Do\", peaked at number 40 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, but fared better in the United Kingdom, where it reached number 4.\n\nUpon release, critical reaction to the album was almost universally positive, with \"Billboard\" magazine noting \"the group has successfully combined folk material with pop-dance beat arrangements. Pete Seeger's \"The Bells Of Rhymney\" is a prime example of the new interpretations of folklore.\" In its July 1965 issue, \"Time\" magazine praised the album by stating, \"To make folk music the music of today's folk, this quintet has blended Beatle beats with Lead Belly laments, created a halfway school of folk-rock that scores at the cash box if not with the folk purists.\" In the UK, the \"NME\" described the band and its debut album by noting, \"They look like a rock group but are really a fine folk unit. They play their stringed instruments with great skill and invention against the rock-steady drumming. Their voices merge well ... As the first group to bridge the gap between beat and folk, they deserve to be winners.\" The UK publication \"Music Echo\" was also enthusiastic about the album's contents, concluding that the record was \"an album which easily lives up to the promise of their great knock-out singles.\"\n\nHowever, not all reviews of the album were positive: \"Record Mirror\" in the UK awarded the album two stars out of five, deriding it as, \"The same nothingy vocals, the same jangly guitar, the same plodding beat on almost every track. The Byrds really must try to get some different sounds.\" \n\nIn more recent years, Richie Unterberger, writing for the AllMusic website, has called the album \"One of the greatest debuts in the history of rock, Mr. Tambourine Man was nothing less than a significant step in the evolution of rock & roll itself, demonstrating that intelligent lyrical content could be wedded to compelling electric guitar riffs and a solid backbeat.\"\n\nThe \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" single and album instantly established the band on both sides of the Atlantic, challenging the dominance of the Beatles and the rest of the British Invasion. The releases also introduced the new genre of folk rock, with the U.S. music press first using the term to describe the Byrds' blend of beat music and folk at roughly the same time as the band's debut single peaked at number 1. A number of critics have opined that, although the roots of folk rock were to be found in the American folk music revival of the early 1960s, the Animals' recording of \"The House of the Rising Sun\", and the twelve-string guitar jangle of the Searchers and the Beatles, it was the Byrds who first melded these elements into a unified whole. \n\nIn the months following the release of the \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" album, many acts began to imitate the Byrds' hybrid of a British Invasion beat, jangly guitar playing and poetic or socially conscious lyrics. The band's influence can be heard in many recordings released by American acts in 1965 and 1966, including the Turtles, Simon & Garfunkel, the Lovin' Spoonful, Barry McGuire, the Mamas & the Papas, Jefferson Airplane, We Five, Love, and Sonny & Cher. This jangly, folk rock sound that was pioneered by the Byrds on \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" has also been influential on successive generations of rock and pop musicians, including such acts as Big Star, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, R.E.M., the Church, Hüsker Dü, the Long Ryders, the Smiths, the Bangles, the Stone Roses, The La's, Teenage Fanclub, the Bluetones, Wilco, and Delays among others.\n\n\"Mr. Tambourine Man\" was remastered at 20-bit resolution and partially remixed as part of the Columbia/Legacy Byrds series. It was reissued in an expanded form on April 30, 1996, with six bonus tracks, including three alternate versions of songs found on the original album, the outtakes \"She Has a Way\" and \"You and Me\", and the single version of \"All I Really Want to Do\".\n\nIn 2003, the album was selected by \"Rolling Stone\" magazine as number 232 on their list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\", and 233 in a 2012 revised list. It was also included in Robert Dimery's book, \"1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die\". It was voted number 267 in Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums 3rd Edition (2000). \n\n\nAdapted from the CD liner notes and \"So You Want To Be A Rock 'n' Roll Star: The Byrds Day-By-Day (1965-1973)\". Track numbers refer to CD and digital releases of the album.\n\nThe Byrds\n\nAdditional Personnel\n\n\"Mr. Tambourine Man\" was one of four Byrds albums that were partially remixed as part of their re-release on Columbia/Legacy. The reason for the remix was explained by Bob Irwin (who produced these re-issues for compact disc) during an interview:\n\nHe further stated:\n\nIrwin's assertions that no liberties were taken have been proven false in many instances. There is a short section of \"Chimes of Freedom\" that exists in the stereo remix that didn't appear in the original mix. The song \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" appears in a radically different, super-wide stereo remix, whereas the original stereo mix was so narrow as to almost be mono. The fades are different on almost every song as well.\n\nMany fans enjoy the remixed album because it's very close to the original mix in most cases and offers noticeably better sound quality. However, there are also a lot of fans who dismiss the remix as revisionist history and prefer to listen to the original mix on vinyl or on the pre-1996 CD releases.\n\na.Roger McGuinn was born James Joseph McGuinn III but changed his name during his involvement with Subud, an international spiritual movement.\n\nb. The 1974 Embassy Records reissue erroneously misspells Gene Clark's name as \"H.Clark\", on self penned compositions co-written with McGuinn; \"You Won't Have to Cry\" and \"It's No Use\". The H could possibly allude to Harold, which was Clark's first name (he was born Harold Eugene Clark).\nBibliography\n\n"}

{"id": "1846075", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1846075", "title": "Metabolic equivalent of task", "text": "Metabolic equivalent of task\n\nThe metabolic equivalent of task (MET) is the objective measure of the ratio of the rate at which a person expends energy, relative to the mass of that person, while performing some specific physical activity compared to a reference, set by convention at 3.5 mL of oxygen per kilogram per minute, which is roughly equivalent to the energy expended when sitting quietly.\n\nThe original definition of metabolic equivalent of task is the oxygen used by a person in milliliters per minute per kilogram body mass divided by 3.5.\n\nOther definitions which roughly produce the same numbers have been devised, such as:\n\nwhere\n\n\nStill another definition of 1 MET is 58.2 W/m (18.4 Btu/h·ft), which is equal to the rate of energy produced per unit surface area of an average person seated at rest. The surface area of an average person is 1.8 m (19 ft). Metabolic rate is usually expressed in terms of unit area of the total body surface (ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55).\n\nOriginally, 1 MET was considered as the resting metabolic rate (RMR) obtained during quiet sitting. \n\nAlthough the RMR of any person may deviate from the reference value, MET can be thought of as an index of the intensity of activities: for example, an activity with a MET value of 2, such as walking at a slow pace (e.g., 3 km/h) would require twice the energy that an average person consumes at rest (e.g., sitting quietly).\n\nMET: The ratio of the work metabolic rate to the resting metabolic rate. One MET is defined as 1 kcal/kg/hour and is roughly equivalent to the energy cost of sitting quietly. A MET also is defined as oxygen uptake in ml/kg/min with one MET equal to the oxygen cost of sitting quietly, equivalent to 3.5 ml/kg/min. The MET concept was primarily designed to be used in epidemiological surveys, where survey respondents answer the amount of time they spend for specific physical activities.\nMET is used to provide general medical thresholds and guidelines to a population. A MET is the ratio of the rate of energy expended during an activity to the rate of energy expended at rest. For example, 1 MET is the rate of energy expenditure while at rest. A 4 MET activity expends 4 times the energy used by the body at rest. If a person does a 4 MET activity for 30 minutes, he or she has done 4 x 30 = 120 MET-minutes (or 2.0 MET-hours) of physical activity. A person could also achieve 120 MET-minutes by doing an 8 MET activity for 15 minutes.\n\nIn a systematic review of physical activity and major chronic diseases, a meta‐analysis of 11.25 MET h/week increase in physical activity yielded: 23% lower risk of cardiovascular disease mortality (RR=0.77, 95% Confidence interval 0.71-0.84), and 26% lower risk of type 2 diabetes (0.74 RR, 95% CI, 0.77–0.72).\n\nThe American College of Sports Medicine and American Heart Association guidelines count periods of at least 10 minutes of moderate MET level activity towards their recommended daily amounts of exercise. For healthy adults aged 18 to 65, the guidelines recommend moderate exercise for 30 minutes five days a week, or vigorous aerobic exercise for 20 minutes three days a week.\n\nThe definition of MET is problematic when used for specific persons. By convention, 1 MET is considered equivalent to the consumption of 3.5 ml O·kg·min (or 3.5 ml of oxygen per kilogram of body mass per minute) and is roughly equivalent to the expenditure of 1 kcal per kilogram of body weight per hour. This value was first experimentally derived from the resting oxygen consumption of a particular subject (a healthy 40-year-old, 70 kg man) and must therefore be treated as a convention. Since the RMR of a person depends mainly on lean body mass (and not total weight) and other physiological factors such as health status, age, etc., actual RMR (and thus 1-MET energy equivalents) may vary significantly from the kcal/(kg·h) rule of thumb. RMR measurements by calorimetry in medical surveys have shown that the conventional 1-MET value overestimates the actual resting O consumption and energy expenditures by about 20% to 30% on the average, whereas body composition (ratio of body fat to lean body mass) accounted for most of the variance.\n\nThe \"Compendium of Physical Activities\" was developed for use in epidemiologic studies to standardize the assignment of MET intensities in physical activity questionnaires. Dr. Bill Haskell from Stanford University conceptualized the compendium and developed a prototype for the document. The compendium was used first in the \"Survey of Activity, Fitness, and Exercise\" (SAFE study – 1987 to 1989) to code and score physical activity records. Since then, the compendium has been used in studies worldwide to assign intensity units to physical activity questionnaires and to develop innovative ways to assess energy expenditure in physical activity studies. The compendium was published in 1993 and updated in 2000 and 2011.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1846076", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1846076", "title": "Palmaria palmata", "text": "Palmaria palmata\n\nPalmaria palmata, also called dulse, dillisk or dilsk (from Irish/Scottish Gaelic '/'), red dulse, sea lettuce flakes, or creathnach, is a red alga (Rhodophyta) previously referred to as \"Rhodymenia palmata\". It grows on the northern coasts of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. It is a well-known snack food. In Iceland, where it is known as \"\", it has been an important source of dietary fiber throughout the centuries.\n\nThe earliest record of this species is on the island of Iona, Scotland where Christian monks harvested it over 1,400 years ago.\n\nThe erect frond of dulse grows attached by its discoid holdfast and a short inconspicuous stipe epiphytically on to the stipe of \"Laminaria\" or to rocks. The fronds are variable in shape and colour from deep rose to reddish purple and are rather leathery in texture. The flat foliose blade gradually expands and divides into broad segments ranging in size to long and in width which can bear flat, wedge-shaped proliferations from the edge. The blade consists of an outer cortex of small cells enclosing a medulla of larger cells up to 0.35 thick.\n\nThe reference to \"Rhodymenia palmata\" var. \"mollis\" in Abbott and Hollenberg (1976), is now considered to refer to a different species: \"Palmaria mollis\" (Setchel et Gardner) van der Meer et Bird.\n\nDulse is similar to another seaweed, \"Dilsea carnosa\", but \"Dilsea\" is more leathery with blades up to long and wide. Unlike \"P. palmata\", it is not branched and does not have proliferations or branches from the edge of the frond, although the older blades may split.\n\nThe full life history was not fully explained until 1980. There are two phases in the life-history, that is it is dioecious, male and female plants grow separately. The large plants are male or have sporangia. The female plants are minute, less than 1 mm) and become overgrown after fertilization by the diploid plant. Tetraspores occur in scattered patches sori (spores) on the mature blade, diploid blade. Spermatial sori occur scattered over most of the frond of the haploid (single cell) male plant. The female gametophyte is very small stunted or encrusted, the carpogonia, the female nucleus, apparently occurring as single cells in the young plants. The male plants are blade-like and produce spermatia which fertilize the carpogonia of the female crust. The adult tetrasporophyte produces tetraspores meiotically in fours.\n\n\"P. palmata\" is to be found growing from mid-tide of the intertidal zone (the area between the high tide and low tide) to depths of 20 m or more in sheltered and exposed shores.\n\nDulse is commonly used as food and medicine in Ireland, Iceland, Atlantic Canada, and the Northeastern United States. It can be found in many health food stores or fish markets and can be ordered directly from local distributors. It is also used as fodder for animals in some countries.\n\nDulse is a good source of minerals and vitamins compared with other vegetables, contains all trace elements needed by humans, and has a high protein content. Dulse contains iodine, which prevents goitre.\n\nIt is commonly found from June to September and can be picked by hand when the tide is out. When picked, small snails, shell pieces, and other small particles can be washed or shaken off the plant, which is then spread to dry. Some gatherers may turn it once and roll it into large bales to be packaged later. \n\nFresh dulse can be eaten directly off the rocks before sun-drying. Sun-dried dulse is eaten as is or is ground to flakes or a powder. When used in cooking, dulse's properties are similar to those of a flavour-enhancer. In Iceland, the tradition is to eat it with butter. It can be pan-fried quickly into chips, baked in the oven covered with cheese, with salsa, or simply microwaved briefly. It can be used in soups, chowders, sandwiches, and salads, or added to bread or pizza dough. Finely diced, it can be used as a flavour enhancer in meat dishes, such as chili, in place of monosodium glutamate.\n\nIn Ireland dulse can be used to make \"White Soda Bread\". In Ballycastle, Northern Ireland, it is traditionally sold at the Ould Lammas Fair. It is particularly popular along the Causeway Coast. Although a fast-dying tradition, many gather their own dulse. Along the Ulster coastline from County Down to County Donegal, it is eaten dried and uncooked as a snack. It is commonly referred to as dillisk on the west coast of Ireland. Dillisk is usually dried and sold as a snack food from stalls in seaside towns by periwinkle sellers.\nResearchers at Oregon State University's Hatfield Marine Science Center have selected a fast-growing strain of Pacific dulse (\"P. mollis\"). Originally intended as a feed for abalone farming, they claim their strain of the seaweed tastes like bacon when fried.\n\n\"P. palmata\" is the only species of \"Palmaria\" found on the coast of Atlantic Europe. It can be found from Portugal to the Baltic coasts and on the coasts of Iceland and the Faroe Islands. It also grows on the shores of Arctic Russia, Arctic Canada, Atlantic Canada, Alaska, Japan, and Korea. Records of \"P. palmaria\" from California are actually of \"Palmaria mollis\".\n\nGalls, possibly produced by parasitic nematodes, copepods, or bacteria, are known to infect these plants. They were recorded as \"outgrowths of tissue produced by the presence...of an animal.\"\n\n\n"}
