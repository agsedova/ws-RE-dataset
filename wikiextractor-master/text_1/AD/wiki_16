She won a Tony Award in 1987, and represented the United Kingdom in the 1994 Eurovision Song Contest with the song \"Lonely Symphony (We Will Be Free)\", finishing 10th. The song became a UK Top 30 hit.\n\nIn 1984, Ruffelle starred as Dinah in the original West End production of \"Starlight Express\". From 1985, she was the original Éponine in the first English-language productions of \"Les Misérables\" in the West End and on Broadway, winning the 1987 Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Musical. Other stage roles include Yonah in \"Children of Eden\" (1991), Roxie Hart in \"Chicago\" (2003–04, 2007), the title role in \"Piaf\" (2013), Bella in \"The A to Z of Mrs. P\" (2014), and Queenie in \"The Wild Party\". Her albums include \"Fragile\" (1994), \"Frances Ruffelle\" (1998), \"Showgirl\" (2004), \"Imperfectly Me\" (2010), and \"I Say Yeh-Yeh\" (2015).\n\nAs well as her later stage work, Ruffelle has also gained success on the screen. Her film credits include roles in \"The Wildcats of St Trinian's\" (1980), \"P'tang, Yang, Kipperbang\" (1982), \"Secrets & Lies\" (1996), \"The Road to Ithaca\" (1999), \"Les Misérables\" (2012), \"Devil's Tower\" (2014), and \"Long Forgotten Fields\" (2014).\n\nRuffelle's first West End appearance was as Louisa in Terence Rattigan's \"The Sleeping Prince\". In 1984, she took on the principal role of Dinah in Andrew Lloyd Webber's \"Starlight Express\" in the original London cast. A year later, she had left \"Starlight\" and joined the original London cast of \"Les Misérables\" as Éponine. Though virtually an unknown outside of the West End, she and Colm Wilkinson were invited to reprise their roles for the Broadway launch. Ruffelle won multiple awards (including the Tony) for her role. She returned to the role she originated in 1997 in the West End of London. Her subsequent work on stage included the Ian Dury musical \"Apples\" in 1989 and Stephen Schwartz's \"Children of Eden\" in 1990, featuring on the cast albums of both. She has also starred as the female lead Roxie Hart in \"Chicago\", as well as appearing in \"Lucky Stiff\",\n\nThe creative team behind \"Les Misérables\", Claude-Michel Schönberg and Alain Boublil, also used Ruffelle's vocals as Kim while writing \"Miss Saigon\". She also workshopped Andrew Lloyd Webber's \"Sunset Boulevard\" and \"Whistle Down the Wind\".\n\nRuffelle, who previously played Roxie Hart in Chicago in the West End from September 2003 to June 2004, reprised the role for the show's 10th anniversary in 2007 and stayed with the production through into 2008. Her return to Chicago marked the first time she has performed in the show in the Cambridge Theatre, having only appeared in it when it was on at the Adelphi Theatre.\n\nRuffelle was set to appear in a revival of the Sherman Brothers musical \"Over Here!\" in January 2007, alongside Donna McKechnie, Diane Langton and Richard Fleeshman, however it was postponed, and was scheduled to open in Toronto in 2009.\n\nIn 2006, she performed in a musical based on the works of Stephen Schwartz, \"Schwartz Stories\". In March 2008, she commenced a limited five-week season in the musical, \"Make Me A Song\". She played the title role in \"Mathilde\" at the Edinburgh festival in 2008.\n\nRuffelle appeared as series regular Dawn Daniel-Spears in Sky's \"Dream Team\", and series regular Kitty in Headless, for which she also composed the music.\n\nOther television credits include playing Olivia in Warner Bros' \"New Adventures of Robin Hood\", Denise in Alan Bennett's \"Objects of Affection\" for the BBC and Susan in \"SWALK\" for Thames Television. She has starred in \"The Bill\" (Thames Television), \"Strangers\" (ITV), \"The Equaliser\" (Universal) and \"The Hard Word\" (Thames Television).\n\nIn 1994, Ruffelle was chosen to represent the United Kingdom at the Eurovision Song Contest. She sang all eight (8) songs at the pre-selection, and British televoters chose \"Lonely Symphony\" to represent the UK, by televoting. It went on to come in 10th at the contest in Dublin. When asked about her motivations for joining the competition, she jokingly replied that since none of the four constituent nations of the UK (Wales, Scotland, England and Northern Ireland) had qualified for that year's football World Cup finals, it was her responsibility to try to restore some national pride.\n\nIn 2010, she appeared in the 25th Anniversary Concert of \"Les Misérables\" at the O2 Arena as part of the original London cast and in 2011 starred as meddling Essex mother Fastrada at the Menier Theatre's production of \"Pippin\".\n\nShe opened in the title role of Piaf in Pam Gems' \"Piaf\" in February 2013 and received a UK Theatre award nomination for Best Actor and in 2014 created the role of Bella in \"The A-Z of Mrs P\" at Southwark Playhouse. Frances also performs her critically acclaimed solo shows, \"Paris Original\" and \"Beneath the Dress\", in London and New York.\n\nIn 2015, Ruffelle played the role of Naomi Green in the ITV sitcom \"Birds of a Feather\". She appeared in three episodes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Lonely Symphony\" was released as a single in the UK, as well as in other countries, and also appeared on her first solo album, \"Fragile\". It reached number 25 in the UK Singles Chart in April 1994.\n\nRuffelle's second album, \"Frances Ruffelle\", came out in 1998, on the small Dress Circle label. It was a change in direction, featuring stripped-down arrangements of mostly musical theatre songs, as well as a couple of classics, original songs and covers. In 2004, she released \"Showgirl\" on her own label, a return to fuller arrangements, but far from a pop sound. Ruffelle also collaborated with Sam Bonner in the group, paTala, making an album called \"Purify\", featuring \"a fusion of traditional Sanskrit chants with unique arrangements of contemporary Western beats\". A new solo album, \"Imperfectly Me\", was released in September 2010.\n\nRuffelle was born in Redbridge district of Ilford in London, England, UK. Her father is a phone company engineer and manager. Her mother is Sylvia Young, the founder of the famous theatre school at which Frances trained.\n\nFrances married director John Caird in 1990. They have two children: a daughter, Eliza Doolittle, and a son.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

This is the third studio album from Fear Factory since guitarist Dino Cazares rejoined the band in 2009, and their first and only studio album to feature drummer Mike Heller. \"Genexus\" is also Fear Factory's first release through Nuclear Blast. Upon its release, \"Genexus\" received very positive reviews from critics.\n\nA lyric video for the song \"Soul Hacker\" was released on June 17. A lyric video for the song \"Protomech\" was released on July 11. A full music video for the song \"Dielectric\" was released on August 7, the same day as the album release, and a music video for \"Expiration Date\" was released on April 12, 2016.\n\nRegarding the drums on \"Genexus\", Burton C. Bell stated: \"...This time we are gonna use a live drummer, we're gonna use Mike Heller to record a few of the songs, not all of them, but a few to get that live feel, because some of these songs require a live feel, and so we’re gonna go with that.\"\n\nLike its predecessor, The Industrialist as well as the (at the time) 20 year old \"Demanufacture\", \"Genexus\" is a concept album. The themes in the album include war, climate change, religion and mortality.\n\n\"Genexus\" received a very positive response by critics, praising the album for its extremely brutal and abrasive sound. Ray Van Horn, Jr. of BlabberMouth said that \"the key and industrial supplements gives \"Genexus\" a busier and heartier personality, lighting up the album's prospectus of mankind transitioning toward a more mechanized state of being.\" Trey Spencer of Sputnik Music surmised that \"this album is more melodic and accessible, Dino Cazares and Burton C. Bell prove that they still have what it takes to make a visceral Fear Factory album.\" James Christopher Monger of Allmusic commented that \"more melody-driven than prior outings, \"Genexus\" nevertheless retains the band's penchant for pairing bleak science fiction imagery with piston-like, palm-muted guitar riffs and explosive percussion.\"\n\nBetween the end of August and the middle of September in 2015, the ensemble had toured the southern, midwestern and southwestern United States along with Once Human, Los Angeles metal band Before the Mourning and Chicago rock/metal band The Bloodline.\n\n\n"}

It was released by Arista Records on August 27, 1988, as the first single from the compilation album, \"\", the soundtrack to the games. The song was Houston's third number one in the UK Singles Chart, and reached number five on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100. The song was later included on the second disc of her first greatest hits \"\" and also on \"The Ultimate Collection\" and on the second disc of \"\".\n\nThe song's melody was inspired by the timeless figure of Elvis Presley, with Hammond imagining it as being sung by Presley at the opening of the Olympics. It appeared on the album \"\", produced in conjunction with NBC Sports' coverage of the Seoul games and which, in addition to Whitney Houston who sang it live at the main ceremony, also featured artists such as: The Four Tops, The Bee Gees, Eric Carmen, Taylor Dayne and the film composer John Williams. The track is an anthem for believing in yourself against all odds as Houston asks for \"One moment in time/when I'm racing with destiny/Then, in that one moment of time, I will feel eternity.\"\n\nThe video for the song does not show Houston performing the song but is a basic collage of clips from previous Olympic ceremonies. It opens with footage of Olympic games from 1924 and 1964 until the lighting of the cauldron from the 1988 games is shown which fades from black and white to color. As the song plays throughout, footage from the games in 1988 and 1984 are shown. When the chorus is sung for the last time, midway through it, scenes of the awarding from 1984 and 1988 are shown. The song video ends with the 1988 Olympic Cauldron blazing.\n\n\"One Moment in Time\" was released by Arista Records on August 27, 1988, as the first single from \"1988 Summer Olympics Album: One Moment in Time\", the soundtrack to the Games in Seoul, South Korea. The song debuted at number 57 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, the issue dated September 10, 1988. Nine weeks later, it peaked at number five on the chart, the issue date of November 12, 1988, becoming Houston's tenth top 10 hit on the Hot 100, and spent 17 weeks on the chart. It also debuted on the \"Billboard\" Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs (formerly \"Hot Black Singles\") at number 78, the issue dated September 17, 1988, and six weeks later reached a peak of 22, her lowest position on the R&B chart at the time. On the issue date of November 5, 1988, the single peaked at number one on the \"Billboard\" Hot Adult Contemporary chart, making it her seventh number-one single on the chart, and stayed on the top for two weeks. It ranked number 89 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 Year-End chart of 1988.\n\nWorldwide, it was a big hit. In the United Kingdom, the song entered the UK Singles Chart at number 24, the week ending date of September 24, 1988, and within four weeks of its release reached the top position, a peak it maintained for two weeks, becoming Houston's third UK number-one single. The single was certified Silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for shipments of 200,000 copies on October 1, 1988. According to The Official Charts Company, the single has sold 400,000 copies in the country. In Germany, it debuted at number 58 on the Media Control Top 100 Singles chart, the week dated September 26, 1988, and the following week went straight into the top ten. On October 24, 1988, the fifth week of its release, the song reached number one on the chart and stayed there for two weeks, making it her second German number-one hit. The single was certified Gold for shipments of 250,000 copies or more by the Bundesverband Musikindustrie (BVMI) in 1988. Across Europe, \"One Moment in Time\" was successful, topping the European Hot 100 Singles chart for five weeks. It peaked inside the top five in Austria, Belgium, Finland, Iceland, Italy, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland, and reached top ten in France and the Netherlands. But the single became a minor hit in Oceania region, peaking at number 53 and 34 on the singles chart, in Australia and New Zealand, respectively. The song re-entered the UK Singles Chart for week ending February 18, 2012 following Houston's death.\n\nAlso following Houston's death, \"Entertainment Weekly\" published a list of her 25 best songs and ranked it #14 because: \"The Seoul Olympics needed an anthem, and Houston rose to meet the challenge with this majestic carpe diem chest-thumper. The song, a staple of sports montages, yielded one of Houston's all-time best performances at the 1989 Grammys ceremony.\"\n\n\nThe British pop group the Shadows did an instrumental version on their 1989 album, \"Steppin' to the Shadows: 16 Great Tracks As Only the Shadows Can Play Them\".\n\nThe song was played during a montage of highlights at the end of NBC Sports' coverage of the 1988 World Series after the Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Oakland Athletics four games to one. The song was also played during the 1995 Baltimore Orioles game when Cal Ripken broke Lou Gehrig's consecutive played games record.\n\nAppropriately for the song's origins as an Olympic anthem, British Olympic gold medal-winning heptathlete Denise Lewis selected the song as one of her eight recordings on the BBC’s \"Desert Island Discs\" in February 2012. That same month, the song featured at the beginning of the 2012 Brit Awards at London's O2 Arena in tribute to Houston who had died earlier in the month by playing the song accompanied with a 30-second-video montage of her music videos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1998, Diva Jane McDonald sang Houston's version of that song from the album Jane McDonald.\n\n\"One Moment in Time\" was performed live by Teodora Sava (11 years old at that time) in the auditions of the first edition of the Romanian kids talent show Next Star 2013. Her performance gathered praise and positive reactions from all of the judges (who were seeing her for the first time) and online, and had 2.65 million combined Youtube views, making her well-known to a wider audience in Romania and abroad. Soon after, she proceeded with recording the song in studio.\n\nDana Winner sings the song live in a powerful rendition of the song which are garnered above 13 million views in YouTube \n\n\n"}

{"id": "2204216", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2204216", "title": "Anglo-Métis", "text": "Anglo-Métis\n\nA 19th century community of the Métis people of Canada, the Anglo-Métis, more commonly known as Countryborn, were children of fur traders; they typically had Scots (Orcadian, mainland Scottish), or English fathers and Aboriginal mothers. They were also known as \"English halfbreeds.\" Some Anglo-Metis still identify by this name. Their first languages were generally those of their mothers: Cree, Saulteaux, Assiniboine, etc. and English. Some of their fathers spoke Gaelic or Scots, leading to the development of the creole language known as \"Bungee\". Some scholars have started spelling Métis as \"Metis\" to acknowledge the presence and contributions of the Anglo-Métis and the complex history of the Métis people overall.\n\nThe Anglo-Métis, like their francophone cousins, did not just live in the Prairies or the area adjacent to the Red River Colony. They also lived in fur trading and military settlements in Ontario along the Great Lakes and James Bay. There also some records of Anglo-Métis families descending from relationships between British soldiers and Indigenous women of various tribes. They tended to identify more with the politically and economically dominant British culture of Canada at this time. If they were descended from Scottish fur traders and Indigenous women, they were often baptized as part of the Presbyterian church if their fathers chose to acknowledge their existence. Case studies have been done on the birth and baptism registers at the St. Gabriel Street Presbyterian Church in Montreal because it provides a good example of how Métis children adjusted to staying temporarily or living in an urban environment that was considerably foreign compared to the remote, rural fur trading settlements or Indigenous camps where they were born. Thus, most Anglo-Métis were the result of relationships, officially recognized by the Church or not, between English and Scottish fur traders and Indigenous women. The ethnicity of their fathers also determined which of the competing fur trading companies they might end up working for as adults. If they were descended from English fur traders, they generally worked for the Hudson's Bay Company. If they were descended from Scottish fur traders, they generally worked for the North West Company, also known as \"Nor'Westers.\" Additionally, the Anglo-Métis / Countryborn had a more sedentary lifestyle of farming than the francophone Métis community, whose men were generally hunters and trappers. The French-speaking Métis were somewhat more nomadic, due to their reliance upon hunting as a trade and food resource. The Anglo-Métis played a role in both the Red River Rebellion (or \"Red River Uprising\") of 1869 and the Northwest Rebellion (or \"Northwest Uprising\") of 1885, as they suffered from similar issues of racial discrimination and land problems as their francophone brethren.\n\nBy the 19th century the English-speaking and French-speaking Métis had become culturally quite similar, moving closer to each other in opposition to the British-Canadian majority. Their musical traditions, especially in the case of fiddle music, was derived from both British Isles and French origins, as was the Métis traditional dance referred to as \"jigging\", or the \"Red River Jig\". In complexion they ranged from fair skinned, blond and blue eyed through dark skinned, with dark hair and dark eyes. Métis elders say that no distinctions were made between individuals based upon complexion within the community. Family, culture, and strong identification with their Christian faith were the unifying bond amongst them. The two communities' primary differences lay in their languages and Christian religious affiliations; the French speakers were generally Roman Catholic and those of British descent were Protestant. Most Countryborn were Anglican or Presbyterian. They were involved in a mixed economy of subsistence farming and bison hunting throughout most of the 19th century; they also found employment with the Hudson's Bay Company and the North West Company. \n\nThe Countryborn were often known in the 19th century as \"mixed-bloods\", \"Black Scots\", \"Native English\" or \"halfbreeds\" (a term now considered pejorative). The French-speaking Metis referred to them simply as \"les métis anglais\" or \"les autres métis\". Anglo-Metis gradually came to see themselves as little different from the French-speaking Métis. \n\nToday, the two groups are no longer politically distinct, and are commonly known on the Canadian Prairies simply as Métis. \n\nProminent Anglo-Métis / Countryborn include James Isbister, Thomas McKay and John Norquay, the Premier of Manitoba from 1878 to 1887.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2204223", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2204223", "title": "Avobenzone", "text": "Avobenzone\n\nAvobenzone (trade names Parsol 1789, Milestab 1789, Eusolex 9020, Escalol 517, Neo Heliopan 357 and others, INCI Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane) is an oil-soluble ingredient used in sunscreen products to absorb the full spectrum of UVA rays.\n\nAvobenzone was patented in 1973 and was approved in the EU in 1978. It was approved by the FDA in 1988. Its use is approved worldwide.\n\nPure avobenzone is a whitish to yellowish crystalline powder with a weak odor, dissolving in isopropanol, decyl oleate, capric acid/caprylic acid triglycerides and other oils.\n\nAvobenzone is a dibenzoylmethane derivative. Avobenzone exists in the ground state as a mixture of the enol and keto forms, favoring the chelated enol. This enol form is stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen-bonding within the β-diketone. Its ability to absorb ultraviolet light over a wider range of wavelengths than many other sunscreen agents has led to its use in many commercial preparations marketed as \"broad spectrum\" sunscreens. Avobenzone has an absorption maximum of 357 nm.\n\nIt is subject to keto-enol tautomerism and exists predominantly enol:\n\nAvobenzone is sensitive to the properties of the solvent, being relatively stable in polar protic solvents and unstable in nonpolar environments. Also, when it is irradiated with UVA light, it generates a triplet excited state in the keto form which can either cause the avobenzone to degrade or it can transfer energy to biological targets and cause deleterious effects.\n\nAvobenzone has been shown to degrade significantly in light, resulting in less protection over time. The UV-A light in a day of sunlight in a temperate climate is sufficient to break down most of the compound. Data presented to the Food and Drug Administration by the Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association indicates a -36% change in avobenzone's UV absorbance following one hour of exposure to sunlight. This degradation can be reduced by using a photostabilizer, like octocrylene. Other photostabilizers include:\n\nComplexing avobenzone with cyclodextrins may also increase its photostability. Formulations of avobenzone with hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin have shown significant reduction in photo-induced degradation, as well as increased transdermal penetration of the UV absorber.\n\nAccording to some studies, \"the most effective sunscreens contain avobenzone and titanium dioxide.\" Avobenzone can degrade faster in light in combination with mineral UV absorbers like zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, though with the right coating of the mineral particles this reaction can be reduced. A manganese doped titanium dioxide may be better than undoped titanium dioxide to improve avobenzone's stability.\n\nAs an enolate, avobenzone forms with heavy metal ions (such as Fe) colored complexes, and chelating agents can be added to suppress them. Stearates, aluminum, magnesium and zinc salts can lead to poorly soluble precipitates. Manufacturers also recommend to avoid the inclusion of iron and ferric salts, heavy metals, formaldehyde donors and PABA and PABA esters. The makers of Coppertone advise that avobenzone binds iron and can cause staining of clothes washed in iron-rich water. The staining properties of sunblock made with avobenzone are particularly noticeable on fiberglass boats with white gelcoat.\n\nAvobenzone also reacts with boron trifluoride to form a stable crystalline complex that is highly fluorescent under UV irradiation. The emission color of the crystals depends on the molecular packing of the boron avobenzone complex. The photoluminescence may also be altered by mechanical force in the solid state, resulting in a phenomenon called \"mechanochromic luminescence\". The altered emission color recovers itself slowly at room temperature or more swiftly at higher temperatures.\n\nThe compound is prepared by reacting 4-tert-butylbenzoic methyl ester (from 4-tert-butylbenzoic acid by esterification with methanol) with 4-methoxyacetophenone in toluene in the presence of sodium amide via Claisen condensation.\n\nAccording to a recent patent application, yields of up to 95% are obtained with the same starting materials in toluene in the presence of potassium methoxide.\n\nAlthough avobenzone is considered safe, disintegration products may have significant health impacts and persist in the environment. A recent study at Lomonosov Moscow State University found that chlorinated water and ultraviolet light can cause avobenzone to disintegrate into various other organic compounds, including; aromatic acids, aldehydes, phenols, and acetophenones which may have adverse health effects.\n\n"}

Altogether it has hosted cultural touchstones from Iceland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Greenland, Åland, Faroe Islands, German-speaking Europe and the Netherlands.\nThe festival was founded in 1978 by former North Dakota senator and mayor of Minot, Chester Reiten (1923-2013), and a group of friends who shared his interest in celebrating their Nordic heritage. The festival is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization that raises funds to preserve, improve and share Scandinavian culture, heritage and educational programs.\n\nIn 2020, due to the COVID-19 global pandemic, Norsk Høstfest cancelled its annual event for the first time ever.\n\nHighlights of the fall festival include announcing the annual Scandinavian-American Hall of Fame inductees. The Hall of Fame is an enduring means of honoring those persons of Scandinavian descent in North America who have achieved greatness in their fields of endeavor and/or whose efforts have contributed significantly to the betterment of mankind.\n\nOther remarkable honors include the selection of the annual Miss Norsk Høstfest and naming of the Chester Award, which recognizes festival excellence in five categories: artisan, exhibitor, food concessionaire, volunteer and chairman.\n\nNorsk Høstfest features a number of Nordic exhibits with internationally recognized artisans, craftsmen and chefs participating. The cuisine as well as the clothes, art and jewelry are authentic, fine quality and exquisitely Nordic.\n\nDuring Høstfest week (end of September through first few days of October), presenters associated with the festival travel to the surrounding area where they introduce Nordic heritage and culture to students in an effort named \"Høstfest In The Schools\". Additionally, Scandinavian Youth Camp is held the weekend prior to Høstfest. Children participating in the camps also perform at Høstfest in scheduled events such as the Troll beauty contest, Norwegian Folk dance, Swedish Maypole dancers, and the Troll parade.\n\nThere are several headliner acts booked each night of the event, not limited to the event's Scandinavian theme. Headliners in the past have included performers from the United States, Canada and Europe.\n\n\n"}

This riot was a series of racially charged violent disturbances that occurred in Plainfield, New Jersey, which mirrored the 1967 Newark riots in nearby Newark.\n\nTwo days after some African Americans began protesting and rioting in Newark in 1967, the Plainfield riots began. Plainfield is located about 18 miles southwest of Newark, and about a third of Plainfield's 48,000 citizen were African Americans then. Tensions remained high that summer through the night of Friday, July 14 when a fight broke out at a local diner, The White Star. Afterwards, about 40 young black men left the diner and marched back to their housing project in the West End section of Plainfield. They vented their anger along the way by smashing store windows and throwing rocks at police cars. When the local police showed up in force, the group dispersed.\n\nThe White Star Diner, which still stands today, was depicted by artist Casey Ruble in 2015.\n\nOn Saturday night trouble started again. Many long time residents of Plainfield claimed that \"outside agitators\" who did not live in Plainfield came into the city to provoke violence and to \"rile up\" the community. Some were white men and some were black men and the hatred they fanned was infectious. Rioting and looting increased and Molotov cocktails were thrown at fire trucks responding to calls. Police from surrounding jurisdictions were called in and the crowds finally dispersed when a heavy rain started to fall early Sunday morning.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon several hundred people gathered at Green Brook Park to hear the local Director of Human Relations talk about the situation in the city. The Union County, New Jersey Park Police, who had jurisdiction over the park, declared the meeting unlawful and ordered the crowd to disperse. Some reported that the police dismissively referred to the gatherers as \"boys\" in urging them to leave the park, which was taken as racially inflammatory and may have led to anger. \n\nThe crowd broke up and reformed in the West End section of Plainfield where widespread rioting started again. The city police were caught off guard and did not respond quickly enough to quell the disorder.\n\nLater that evening a white police officer, John Gleason, was manning a checkpoint. Members of the white motorcycle gang known as the Pagans entered the area and a confrontation between a large group of young black men and the white members of the Pagans was brewing. Police Officer John Gleason placed himself between the two groups and the Pagan motorcycle gang left. The remaining crowd refused to disperse and Officer Gleason became surrounded by the crowd which began to threaten him and close in on him. Officer Gleason fired a shot and wounded Bobby Lee Williams. When the officer tried to leave the area to get help, he was overtaken by a mob and was beaten with a steel grocery store cart, stomped and eventually shot and killed with his own service revolver.\n\nThat same night in nearby Middlesex an arms factory was broken into and 46 automatic weapons were stolen. The Plainfield Machine Company was a small manufacturing company owned by William Haas and William Stork that, among other things, produced M1 carbines for the civilian market. The stolen guns were passed out to the men on the streets of Plainfield that very night. The police were anxious because of the large number of guns now on the streets and the Plainfield Fire Department Station was under constant gunfire for five hours. The bullet holes in the brick facade of the building remain to this day. Finally, New Jersey National Guardsmen, in armored personnel carriers relieved the station. \n\nPolice tried to arrange a truce and have residents turn in the stolen carbines. Black residents felt that having the guns in the community kept the police at bay and that they now had power over the police. When none of the stolen firearms were returned, the area was cordoned off and 300 heavily armed New Jersey State Police and National Guardsmen started a house-to-house search for the stolen weapons. After about an hour and a half, with 66 homes searched, the operation was called off. The police felt that since Governor Hughes had declared a State of Emergency, no search warrants were needed.\n\nBy July 21, things had calmed down to the point where National Guard troops and state police could be pulled out of the city.\n\nDozens of black residents later filed suit against the government claiming that their constitutional rights had been violated during the search for the stolen carbines.\nEven several weeks after the riot, the local police and FBI were still looking for the stolen weapons. No arrests had been made in the theft and only a few of the guns had been recovered.\n\nMore than 100 people had been arrested for looting and rioting during the disturbance. Officer Gleason was the only person killed during the riot and in December 1968, a jury convicted two people, a man and a woman, of murder in his death. They were both sentenced to life imprisonment. Seven others were acquitted and one case was declared a mistrial because of a deadlocked jury.\n\nLike many cities, Plainfield suffered a decline from the stigma of the riots, and many of the burned and looted businesses remained vacant for over four decades. Several residents decamped for neighboring towns like Edison, Scotch Plains, Watchung, Warren, Westfield and Bridgewater. Many residents abandoned their houses after leaving, as the massive number of people selling their property resulted in people being unable to sell them (or at massively reduced prices). After leaving, since the owners did not want to live there anymore but could not sell, they sometimes let them fall into foreclosure. After a while many of them ended up derelict. Many of the houses were also turned into multi family homes. It remains one of the poorest urban areas in the state with a 16 percent poverty rate including over 7 percent having an income less than 50 percent of poverty level.\n\nAuthor and Plainfield native Isaiah Tremaine published the book \"Insurrection\" in 2017 as an accounting of the Plainfield riots from his perspective as a black teenager living in the city at the time.\n\nIn July 2017, the Plainfield Anti-Violence Coalition held a memorial event to discuss and commemorate the 50th anniversary of the rebellion.\n\n\n"}

He was born in Dirranbandi, and lived there until he was involved in a pub fight, when the local police officer told him to leave before investigators from Brisbane could arrive when he was identified as a person of interest in a subsequent murder investigation. He moved to Sydney, and ended up living in Bondi, working as a bouncer in an illegal casino in Kings Cross. In later books it turns from an illegal casino to a bridge club, as the club's owner Price Galese has further trouble bribing Police and Government officials to ignore the casino's presence. Les' career provides many opportunities for training, fighting, sex, dancing, photography, reflection and the odd mystery solving.\n\nLes played rugby league for Easts during his early days in Sydney. He drives around in an old 1968 Ford Falcon in the early stories. In later stories he drives a late model Holden Commodore Berlina that belonged to a man who was murdered in the car.

{"id": "2204261", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2204261", "title": "Cohiba (cigar brand)", "text": "Cohiba (cigar brand)\n\nCohiba is a brand for two kinds of premium cigar, one produced in Cuba for Habanos S.A., the Cuban state-owned tobacco company, and the other produced in the Dominican Republic for US-based General Cigar Company. The name \"cohíba\" derives from the Taíno word for \"tobacco\".\n\nThe Cuban brand is filled with tobacco that comes from the Vuelta Abajo region of Cuba which has undergone an extra fermentation process. Cuban Cohiba was established in 1966 as a limited production private brand supplied exclusively to Fidel Castro and high-level officials in the Communist Party of Cuba and Cuban government. Often given as diplomatic gifts, the Cohiba brand gradually developed a \"cult\" status. It was first released commercially for sale to the public in 1982. The Cohiba Siglo VI has received some of the highest scores in the line from blind reviews, including a 93 from \"Cigar Aficionado\" and a 90 from Blind Man's Puff.\n\nThe US Cohiba brand name was registered in the United States by the General Cigar Company in 1978 and cigars using that trademark have been produced for the American market in the Dominican Republic on a large scale from 1997. This Cohiba is related to the Cuban product in name only, containing no Cuban tobacco, and thus is the only \"Cohiba\" that can be sold legally in the United States.\n\nCuban Cohiba's origins trace back to the middle 1960s, when a bodyguard of Fidel Castro shared some of his private supply of cigars made by a local artisan named Eduardo Ribera. These cigars pleased Castro so much that a special production of the unbranded blend, produced under tight security, was made for Castro and other top government officials.\n\nAs Castro himself recalled the tale in 1994:\n\"I used to see the man smoking a very aromatic, very nice cigar, and I asked him what brand he was smoking. He told me that it was a special blend, but that it came from a friend who makes cigars and he gave them to him. I said, let's find this man. I tried the cigar, and I found it so good that we got in touch with him and asked him how he made it. Then we set up the house [the El Laguito factory], and he explained the blend of tobacco he used. He told which leaves he used from which tobacco plantations. He also told us about the wrappers he used and other things. We found a group of cigar makers. We gave them the material and that is how the factory was founded. Now Cohiba is known all over the world.\"\n\nThe production of special cigars for top officials under conditions of tight security was given extra impetus by fears of ongoing CIA assassination efforts against Fidel and Raul Castro and Che Guevara. The technical services department of the agency is now in fact known to have worked on the development of exploding cigars as a means of assassination from the early 1960s.\n\nThe Cuban Cohiba brand was formally launched in 1968 at the direction of Cubatabaco, the Cuban state tobacco marketing bureau. The head of Cubatabaco asked Avelino Lara, head of the El Laguito factory, to create a new super-premium blend which differed from all previously existing Cuban cigars. During the first few years of production only a few thousand boxes were produced annually, reserved for the use of high government officials and frequently given away as diplomatic gifts.\n\nThe Cuban Cohiba brand was launched as a premium cigar brand into markets outside of the US in 1982 in conjunction with the 1982 World Cup held in Spain. At the time of its first public launch, the Cohiba marque consisted of just three \"vitolas\" (sizes): the Panetela, the Corona Especial, and the Lancero. In 1989 three more \"vitolas\" were added: the Robusto, the Exquisito, and the Espléndido. These first six are now collectively known as the company's \"Línea Clásica\" (classic line).\n\nIn 1992 Habanos SA launched the first sizes in what it calls the \"Línea 1492\", commemorating Christopher Columbus and his voyage to the Americas, with each size named for a century since Columbus' discovery. The initial launch included the Siglo I, Siglo II, Siglo III, Siglo IV, and Siglo V, with a Siglo VI added in 2002.\n\nBesides regular production, Habanos SA regularly releases limited release Cohíba cigars for such events as the annual Habanos Festival, brand anniversaries, and their annual \"Edición Limitada\" (limited edition) release of special sizes of their various cigar brands wrapped in a darker vintage leaf. In 2007, Habanos released a new line of maduro-wrapped Cohibas, called \"Maduro 5,\" in three sizes.\n\nThe Cuban Cohiba brand also carries two machine-made extensions cigarillos: the Mini and the Club.\n\nHabanos SA have used their Cohiba brand name for non-cigar products, manufacturing Cohiba cigarettes since 1987 and Extra Cohiba Cognac since 1999.\n\nIn 1992 approximately 3.4 million cigars were produced in Cuba bearing the Cohiba label, out of a total Cuban cigar export production of approximately 60 million pieces.\n\nCuban Cohibas have historically been known to use some of the finest cigar tobacco available in Cuba. The tobacco for Cohiba is selected from the finest \"Vegas Finas de Primera\" (first-class tobacco fields) in the San Luis and San Juan y Martinez zones of the Vuelta Abajo region of Pinar del Río Province. In 1992 just 10 carefully selected fields totaling about 700 acres were used for production of the Cohiba brand, their exact location a carefully guarded trade secret. The production of these fields is further selected for quality, with the output of just five of these fields used in Cohiba production in an average year.\n\nThe tobacco used to fill the cigars is unique among Cuban brands owing to a special third fermentation in wooden barrels at the El Laguito factory, aimed at producing a smoother flavor than other cigars. Originally all Cohibas were made at the El Laguito factory, a mansion located on the outskirts of Havana converted into a cigar-rolling school for women in 1961. Production of some Cohiba vitolas was later expanded to the Partagas factory in Havana, which manufactures its Cohiba product from pre-blended tobacco received from El Laguito.\n\nCohiba cigars tend to be medium to full-bodied in flavor.\n\nThe following list of \"vitolas de salida\" (commercial vitolas) within the Cohiba marque lists their size and ring gauge in Imperial (and Metric), their \"vitolas de galera\" (factory vitolas), and their common name in American cigar slang.\n\n\"The La Línea Clásica Series\"\n\"The La Línea 1492 Series\"\n\"The Maduro 5 Series\"\n\"The Behike Series\"\n\"Edición Limitada Releases\"\n\"Special Releases\"\n\nWith the nationalization of the Cuban tobacco industry along with other businesses after the Cuban Revolution, many cigar makers fled the island and began growing tobacco in the Dominican Republic, Honduras, and Nicaragua, taking the brand names of their cigars with them. The Cuban industry contended that the brand names were the property of the nation, however, and parallel use of the same brand name resulted. Additionally, post-revolutionary trademark uncertainty and a US embargo against all Cuban goods made possible the relaunch of other Cuban brand names by private companies in other countries.\n\nThe General Cigar Company, a private firm having no relation whatsoever to the Cuban cigar industry, first registered the name Cohiba in the United States in 1978 and subsequently began selling cigars under the Cohiba brand in that country in the 1980s. Manufacture and sales of General Cigar's brand was significantly expanded during the 1990s cigar boom, with General Cigar's product known colloquially as \"Red Dot Cohiba,\" owing to the red dot in the middle of the \"O\" in \"Cohiba\" on its bands and boxes.\n\nIn response to General Cigar's use of the Cohiba name, Cubatabaco, the government-run company in charge of cigars, and half-owner of Habanos SA along with Altadis SA, launched a long-running legal campaign to have General Cigar's trademark revoked.\n\nThese legal fisticuffs were resolved on June 19, 2006, when the U. S. Supreme Court [ denied] Cubatabaco's petition. As a result, the February 2005 decision of the U. S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals (Docket #04-2527), which confirmed General Cigar Company’s exclusive ownership of the Cohiba trademark in the United States, is final. The General Cigar-made Cohiba cigars now have a disclaimer on boxes that they are not affiliated in any way with the Cuban brand.\n\nHowever, the United States government, in an \"amicus curiae\" brief filed in the Supreme Court, acknowledged that Cubatabaco could request U.S. government permission for judicial protection of the brand from the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, which administers the U.S. embargo. Cubatabaco has stated that they intend to pursue this course of action.\n\nIn a November 1992 interview, director of Cubatabaco Francisco Padrón indicated that in the event the American embargo of Cuban products were ended, return of the Cohiba brand name to Cubatabaco would be a prerequisite for any future distribution agreement with General Cigar Co. \"The first condition is that they must pass the brand name to us. This is the first condition. Immediately. If not, forget about it,\" Padrón declared.\n\nUS Supreme Court hands Cuba a victory over its cigars February 25, 2015\n\nThe US Supreme Court declined to intervene in a long-running battle between a US and Cuban company over the Cohiba cigar trademark. By refusing to hear an appeal, the country's highest court leaves intact a ruling in favor of the Cuban firm.\n\nDue to a US trade embargo with Cuba, Cubatabaco cannot sell its Cohiba cigars in the United States while they are sold worldwide and in Cuba. US company General Cigar sells its Dominican Republic-produced Cohiba cigars in the US. The legal dispute is over whether the Cuban company has to the right to challenge General Cigar’s trademark in the US, despite the embargo, as reported by Agence France Presse.\n\nGeneral Cigar obtained a US registration for Cohiba in 1981 and a second registration in 1995. Cubatabaco had the trademark registered in Cuba in 1972. In the late 70s, it began registering the logo outside Cuba – in 115 countries – but was prohibited from selling merchandise in the US by the Cuban Assets Control Regulation (CACR). \nIn the case, Cubatabaco argued the CACR not only prevented the company from selling in the US, but also prevented it from challenging General Cigar's registrations.\n\nIn June 2014, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in favor of the Cuban company by giving it standing to seek a cancelation of the registrations that block its own ability to register trademarks. The case will now move forward to the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board.\n\nThe challenge comes two months after President Obama announced in December that he planned to loosen some of the US-Cuba restrictions, including the easing of the decades-long trade embargo.\n\nUnder an easing of travel restrictions between the US and Cuba, American visitors will be able to buy and take home as many as 100 cigars.\n\n\n\n"}

When the \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV\" (DSM-IV) was published, survivor guilt was removed as a recognized specific diagnosis, and redefined as a significant symptom of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It may be found among survivors of combat, epidemics, murder, natural disasters, rape, terrorism, among the friends and family of those who have died by suicide, and in non-mortal situations.\n\nSurvivor guilt was first identified during the 1960s. Several therapists recognized similar if not identical conditions among Holocaust survivors. Similar signs and symptoms have been recognized in survivors of traumatic situations including combat, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, air-crashes and wide-ranging job layoffs. A variant form has been found among rescue and emergency services personnel who blame themselves for doing too little to help those in danger, and among therapists, who may feel a form of guilt in the face of their patients' suffering.\n\nStephen Joseph, a psychologist at the University of Warwick, has studied the survivors of the capsizing of the MS \"Herald of Free Enterprise\" which killed 193 of the 459 passengers. His studies showed that 60 percent of the survivors suffered from survivor guilt. Joseph went on to say: \"There were three types: first, there was guilt about staying alive while others died; second, there was guilt about the things they failed to do – these people often suffered post-traumatic 'intrusions' as they relived the event again and again; third, there were feelings of guilt about what they did do, such as scrambling over others to escape. These people usually wanted to avoid thinking about the catastrophe. They didn't want to be reminded of what really happened.\"\n\nSufferers sometimes blame themselves for the deaths of others, including those who died while rescuing the survivor or whom the survivor tried unsuccessfully to save.\n\n\"Survivor syndrome\", also known as \"concentration camp syndrome\" (or \"KZ syndrome\" on account of the German term \"\"), are terms which have been used to describe the reactions and behaviors of people who have survived massive and adverse events, such as the Holocaust, the Rape of Nanking, and the HIV/AIDS epidemic. \n\nIn 1949, Eddy de Wind, a Dutch psychiatrist and survivor of Auschwitz concentration camp introduced the term \"concentration camp syndrome\" regarding the psychological consequences of persecution, describing the \"pathological after-effects\" unique to former prisoners of Nazi concentration and extermination camps. The subsequently well-documented syndrome among Holocaust survivors includes anxiety and depression, intellectual impairment, social withdrawal, sleep disturbance and nightmares, physical complaints and mood swings with loss of drive. Several studies have examined the \"chronic and progressive\" nature of the condition, with symptoms increasing in intensity as survivors age. \n\nCommonly such survivors feel guilty that they have survived the trauma and others – such as their family, friends, and colleagues – did not.\n\nBoth conditions, along with other descriptive syndromes covering a range of traumatic events are now subsumed under posttraumatic stress disorder.\n\nAIDS survivor syndrome refers to the psychological effects of living with the long-term trajectory of the AIDS epidemic and includes survivor's guilt, depression, and feelings of being forgotten in contemporary discussions concerning HIV. While AIDS survivor syndrome has not been recognized as a pathologizable illness by the NIH (as of December 2017), scientific research and publications are available that address this issue.\n\nHolocaust survivor Primo Levi was haunted by his experiences in Auschwitz and explored his survivor's guilt extensively in his autobiographical books, notably in \"I sommersi e i salvati (The Drowned and the Saved)\". Towards the end of his life he suffered from depression, and his death may have been suicide.\n\nIn an interview on Lifetime TV's \"Unsolved Mysteries\", Lawrence \"Larry\" Geller, one of Elvis Presley's closest friends, reported that Elvis, as a \"twinless twin\", was plagued by guilt over the death of his brother, Jesse Garon, who was stillborn. Elvis had confided to Geller about his concerns that maybe he had absorbed more than his share of the nutrients while he was developing inside his mother's womb, causing his twin brother to starve to death before he was born. Elvis had also related to Geller about how his mother had tried to comfort her son by assuring him that \"they would all meet in Heaven\" after their lives on Earth were completed.\n\nWaylon Jennings was a guitarist for Buddy Holly's band and initially had a seat on the ill-fated aircraft on The Day the Music Died on February 3, 1959. But Jennings gave up his seat to the sick J.P. \"Big Bopper\" Richardson, only to learn later of the plane's crash. When Holly learned that Jennings was not going to fly, he said, \"Well, I hope your ol' bus freezes up.\" Jennings responded, \"Well, I hope your ol' plane crashes.\" This exchange of words, though made in jest at the time, haunted Jennings for the rest of his life.\n\nSydney Aiello survived the 2018 Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, in which her close friend was killed. Aiello subsequently struggled with survivor's guilt, and she had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. On March 17, 2019, Aiello died by suicide at the age of 19. A week later, on March 24, 2019, Coral Springs police announced that a juvenile male student from Stoneman Douglas High School had been found dead as a result of an apparent suicide.\n\n\n\n"}

It is the largest station in the BART system, being the only one with four platform tracks. Service through MacArthur is timed for cross-platform transfers between the southbound lines that pass through the station. MacArthur station is in North Oakland, in the median of Route 24 just north of its interchange with I-580 and perpendicular to 40th Street and MacArthur Boulevard. The surrounding neighborhood is mostly low-density residential, making MacArthur station primarily a commuting hub.\n\nMacArthur station opened on September 11, 1972, as the northern terminus of the inaugural BART line, which ran to Fremont. Upon the opening of the Transbay Tube in 1974, the station began to serve Transbay trains to San Francisco. The station included several pieces of public art: an abstract mural by Mark Adams over a staircase (which Adams later replaced with two murals after the stairs were removed), and tile mosaics by Adams and Alfonso Pardiñas in the fare lobby.\n\nNia Wilson was killed at the station on July 22, 2018. Sunday-only service to the station on the Dublin/Pleasanton line was operated from February 11, 2019 to February 10, 2020.\n\nBecause of MacArthur's importance as an interchange and its location in the center of the East Bay, BART has conducted a number of feasibility studies about the prospects of creating transit-oriented development around the station. These studies have resulted in a plan for the \"MacArthur Transit Village,\" a mixed-use development on the eastern side of Route 24 bounded by 40th Street, Telegraph Avenue, and West MacArthur Boulevard. The current plan calls for 624 residential units as well as of retail space. MacArthur Commons occupies Parcel A and Parcel C of the Village, providing 385 apartment units. The groundbreaking for the project was held in May 2011 with the start of construction for a new 450-space parking garage for BART. BART opened a parking garage as part of the project in September 2014. As of 2018, the village is under construction and will include around 850 units and a tower tall.\n\nMacArthur station was built with cross-platform interchanges in mind. There are two island platforms and four tracks. Platforms 1 and 2 serve the Richmond-Fremont line and the Richmond-Daly City/Millbrae line; Platform 1 goes Northbound towards Richmond, and Platform 2 goes Southbound towards Fremont and Daly City/Millbrae. Platforms 3 and 4 serve the Antioch–SFO/Millbrae line; Platform 3 goes Northbound toward Pittsburg/Bay Point, and Platform 4 goes Southbound toward SFO/Millbrae. Connections between the lines are timed for Southbound passengers between Platforms 2 and 4. This is not the case for Northbound passengers, as a timed transfer point already exists further south at 19th Street Station. MacArthur tends to be crowded in the morning due to high transfer volume between two lines where only a few people get off while many are trying to board. Southbound trains converge to single track towards downtown Oakland, and San Francisco bound trains are given priority when departing in that direction.\nConnecting AC Transit transit lines at this station include Line 57 to Foothill Square and Emeryville and Line C to Piedmont and San Francisco. The free Kaiser Shuttle to Oakland Medical Center and another shuttle to Children's Hospital Oakland as well as shuttles to Alta Bates campuses also serve the station in addition to the free Emery-Go-Round bus system to Emeryville.\n\n\n"}

The Esplanade Riel illustrated is located in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. This bridge is intended for pedestrian use only and has a restaurant in its base.\n\nIn the example below the cable paths are aligned with the bridge centerline, so that structurally it differs only in the transfer of stresses through the tower to the foundation.\nThe side-spar principle is not limited to a straight bridge, however. The tower could be offset and the bridge deck wrap around the spar in an arc, e.g., Chords Bridge in Jerusalem. Such a bridge would be particularly suited for use in the confines of a canyon, where the road is brought in the upstream direction down one side, crosses a stream, and turns back to a downstream direction on the other side. By placing a large portion of the turn on the bridge, rather than on the approaches, the turn may be made more gentle, allowing faster traffic. This would require more torsional (twisting) rigidity in the roadbed than would a straight bridge. A bridge of this type (supported by a spar), traveling through a much smaller arc, was one of the original proposals for the eastern span replacement of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge. Similar bridges, without the spar, could be supported by cables anchored in the canyon walls (where conditions are suitable).\n\nThis subtype should not be confused with an asymmetrical single tower cable-stayed bridge, which possesses a single tower on one side of the gap to be crossed (see Rama VIII Bridge), nor with the cantilever spar cable-stayed bridge, which has span supporting cables on only one side of the tower along the direction of the roadbed.\n\n"}

Because the Xbox uses a digital signature system to prevent the public from running unsigned code, one must either use a modchip, or a softmod. Originally, modchips were the only option; however, it was later demonstrated that the TSOP chip on which the Xbox's BIOS is held may be reflashed. This way, one may flash on the \"Cromwell\" BIOS, which was developed legally by the Xbox Linux project. Catalyzed by a large cash prize for the first team to provide the possibility of booting Linux on an Xbox without the need of a hardware hack, numerous software-only hacks were also found. For example, a buffer overflow was found in the game \"\" that allowed the booting of a Linux loader (\"xbeboot\") straight from a save game.\n\nThe Xbox is essentially a PC with a custom 733 MHz Intel Pentium III processor, a 10 GB hard drive (8 GB of which is accessible to the user), 64MB of RAM (although on all earlier boxes this is upgradable to 128MB), and 4 USB ports. (The controller ports are actually USB 1.1 ports with a modified connector.) These specifications are enough to run several readily available Linux distributions.\n\nFrom the Xbox-Linux home page:\n\" The Xbox is a legacy-free PC by Microsoft that consists of an Intel Celeron 733 MHz CPU, an nVidia GeForce 3MX, 64 MB of RAM, a 8/10 GB hard disk, a DVD drive and 10/100 Ethernet. As on every PC, you can run Linux on it. \"\n\n\" An Xbox with Linux can be a full desktop computer with mouse and keyboard, a web/email box connected to TV, a server or router or a node in a cluster. You can either dual-boot or use Linux only; in the latter case, you can replace both IDE devices. And yes, you can connect the Xbox to a VGA monitor. \"\nAn Xbox with Linux installed can act as a full desktop computer with mouse and keyboard, a web/email box connected to a television, a server, router or a node in a cluster. One can either dual-boot or use Linux only; in the latter case, one can replace both IDE devices. One can also connect the Xbox to a VGA monitor. A converter is needed to use keyboards/mice in the controller ports; however this is not difficult, as the Xbox uses standard USB with a proprietary port.\n\nCurrently only a few distributions of Xbox Linux will run on the version 1.6 Xbox (the third newest version, including 1.6b). Xboxes with modchips and the Cromwell bios installed can run more distributions than those with only a softmod. This is mainly due to issues with the video chip used in version 1.6 Xboxes that was developed exclusively by Microsoft and which has no source code available at this time. This can cause significant overscan on all four sides of the screen when a different kernel than the original is loaded.\n\nOne of the more popular ways of installing Xbox Linux is through a softmod, which does not require a modchip to use. The Xbox Linux softmod utilizes a save exploit found in the original run of \"MechAssault\", \"Splinter Cell\", \"\", and \"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4\". The method involves loading a hacked save file transferred to the Xbox's Hard Drive. When the save file is loaded, the \"MechInstaller\" is initiated. The Xbox Live option on the dashboard is replaced with the new Linux option after rebooting the system. Another softmod that can be used is the hotswap exploit which will unlock the Xbox hard drive long enough to allow one to modify it.\n\nThere is also a way to completely replace the Xbox's stock BIOS with a \"Cromwell\" BIOS, which is completely legal and is solely for Linux on the Xbox. However, once the TSOP (BIOS chip) is flashed with \"Cromwell\", the Xbox can no longer play Xbox games or run native Xbox executables (.xbe files, akin to .exe for Windows).\n\nThere are several distributions of Xbox Linux, most of which are based on PC Linux distributions.\n\n\n"}

He is a contributing editor of \"The New Republic\" and a member of the editorial board of \"Dissent\". He has been awarded fellowships from the MacArthur and Guggenheim foundations and from the Cullman Center for Scholars & Writers at the New York Public Library. He was a Regents' Lecturer at the University of California, Irvine, and a Distinguished Writer in Residence at New York University. He is also an Advisory Editor at \"Fathom: For a deeper understanding of Israel and the region\".\n\nIn \"Terror and Liberalism\", Berman offers a theory of totalitarianism. In his interpretation, totalitarian movements of the right and the left arose in Europe in the aftermath of the First World War as a reaction to the successes and failures of liberal civilization. The ideologies promoted mythologies of world events that were paranoid, apocalyptic, utopian, obsessed with purity, and ultimately nihilist. The totalitarian movements were, in Berman's account, mass mobilizations for unattainable aims.\n\nBerman tries to trace the influence of these European movements upon the modern Muslim world. He identifies two principal totalitarian tendencies in the Muslim countries, Baathism and radical Islamism – mutually hostile movements whose doctrines, in his interpretation, overlap and have allowed for alliances. Berman regards suicide terror and the cult of martyrdom as a re-emergence of totalitarianism's nihilist strand.\n\nBerman draws a distinction between the ancient religion of Islam and the political movement of radical Islamism. In July 2010, he wrote in the \"Wall Street Journal\" that \"Islamism is a modern, instead of an ancient, political tendency, which arose in a spirit of fraternal harmony with the fascists of Europe in the 1930s and '40s.\"\n\nIn Berman's interpretation, observers relying on modern liberal values have sometimes found it difficult to identify the anti-liberal and anti-rational quality of totalitarian movements. Berman proposed this argument and offered an explanation based on the concept of \"rationalist naiveté\" in \"Terror and Liberalism\". He developed the argument further in \"The Flight of the Intellectuals.\"\n\nBerman's ideas have influenced writers such as Martin Amis and Bernard-Henri Lévy, helping to shape debates about the concept of the \"post-left\" in Britain. Amis invokes Berman's argument in the opening paragraph of his book on 9/11, \"The Second Plane\" (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2008), p. ix. Regarding Lévy, see p. 269 of his book \"American Vertigo\" (NY: Random House, 2006) and an article in \"The American Interest.\" The British journalist Nick Cohen, in explaining his switch to support for the wider war on terror, cited \"Terror and Liberalism\" as a major influence: \"The only time I realised I was charging up a blind alley was when I read Paul Berman's \"Terror and Liberalism\". I didn't see a blinding light or hear a thunder clap or cry 'Eureka!' If I was going to cry anything it would have been 'Oh bloody hell!' ... I was going to have to turn it round and see the world afresh. The labour would involve reconsidering everything I'd written since 11 September, arguing with people I took to be friends and finding myself on the same side as people I took to be enemies. All because of Berman.\"\n\nBerman's approach has not been without its critics. A writer in \"The Nation\" magazine, Anatol Lieven, labeled Berman a \"Philosopher king\" of the liberal hawks and criticized him for \"[promoting] and [justifying] the most dangerous aspect of the Bush Administration's approach to the war on terrorism: the lumping together of radically different elements in the Muslim world into one homogeneous enemy camp.\" Berman has also been criticized in books by the liberal sociologist, Alan Wolfe, and the neo-Marxist political theorist, Robert Meister.\n\nBerman argued that the NATO war in the former Yugoslavia in 1999 was justified by the doctrine of \"liberal interventionism\": an intervention intended to rescue endangered populations from extreme oppression and to promote liberal and democratic freedom. He looked on the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan and the 2003 invasion of Iraq in the same light. In the run-up to the invasion of Iraq, he declined to endorse the Bush administration's policy and warned that it was likely to fail: \"we are wielding power without liberalism, which will turn out to be no power at all.\"\n\nOnce the invasion had begun, he nonetheless called on the liberal left to support the war on humanitarian and anti-totalitarian grounds, even while continuing to elaborate his criticism of the larger Bush Doctrine. His pro-war and anti-Bush positions confused some, as they managed to irk people on each side of the American political spectrum. His argument corresponded, however, to the views of the political tendency that is sometimes described as the anti-totalitarian left. He was one of the American signatories of the Euston Manifesto in 2006, a British document which expressed that tendency. Berman is also sometimes associated with the \"New Philosophers\" movement in France.\n\nReflecting on the Iraq war in 2007, Berman wrote in \"The New York Review of Books\", \"I approved on principle the overthrow of Saddam. I never did approve of Bush's way of going about it. In the run-up to the war, I became, on practical grounds, ever more fearful that, in his blindness to liberal principles, Bush was leading us over a cliff… It is true and it is a matter of satisfaction to me that, in the years since then, I have not made a career of saying 'I told you so.'\"\n\nSpeaking of Israel in an interview, Berman commented of anti-Zionism that its \"true origin ... is anti-Semitism, the assumption that the Jews are the center of the world and therefore the center of the world's evil.\"\n\nBerman's \"A Tale of Two Utopias\" and \"Power and the Idealists\" are the first two parts of a history of the so-called Generation of 1968 (of which he was a member). He argues that packaged together with the liberal ideals in this movement were decidedly disturbing elements. Joschka Fischer, for example, the 1968 activist who would later become a leading figure in the German Green Party and Foreign Minister, decided that there was in fact the presence of anti-Semitic impulses in this movement when he saw the Revolutionary Cells participate in the Entebbe hijacking. The hijackers split the passengers by ethnicity, with Jews on the one side and non-Jews on the other, with the intention to kill all of the former.\n\nAlso, Berman tracks major figures like Bernard Kouchner—the later founder of Doctors Without Borders—a member of the 1968 Generation who would later marry active improvement of human rights to established political goals.\n\nAt the close of the book, Berman considers the effect of the war in Iraq on these graduates of '68. He suggests that the war split the movement greatly, with many now deeply aware of the dramatic excesses of the regime of Saddam Hussein, as well as the potential negative consequences if such a dictator remained in power. Nonetheless, they were deeply concerned by the arguments offered by the Bush Administration.\n\nIn 1986, Michael Moore became the editor of \"Mother Jones\" magazine and was fired a few months later partly for refusing to print an article by Berman that was critical of the Sandinista human rights record in Nicaragua. Moore stated that he would not run the article because he believed it to be inaccurate. \"The article was flatly wrong and the worst kind of patronizing bullshit. You would scarcely know from it that the United States had been at war with Nicaragua for the last five years\". When asked about the incident, Berman described Moore as a \"very ideological guy and not a very well-educated guy.\" Moore sued for wrongful dismissal and the case was settled out of court for $58,000, providing Moore with seed money for his first film, \"Roger & Me\". Moore returned to the attack in 2011 in his book \"Here Comes Trouble,\" by humorously describing Berman as a \"neo-nudnik\".\n\nBerman predicted that if fair elections were held in Nicaragua in 1990, the Sandinistas would be voted out of office. Berman's other principal articles on Nicaragua appeared in \"The New Republic\", \"The New Yorker\", and \"Dissent.\" (The opponent of the Sandinistas, Violeta Chamorro, won the elections in that year.) His journalism on Latin American arts and politics beyond Nicaragua has appeared in many publications—such as \"The New York Times Magazine\", August 2, 1998, and July 2, 2000; \"The New York Review of Books\", October 18, 2001; \"Slate\", September 24, 2004; \"Slate\", September 10, 2007; \"The New York Times Book Review\", June 7, 2009; and \"Hispanic New York\", ed. by Claudio Ivan Remeisera (New York: Columbia University Press, 2010).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2204330", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2204330", "title": "Hepatorenal syndrome", "text": "Hepatorenal syndrome\n\nHepatorenal syndrome (often abbreviated HRS) is a life-threatening medical condition that consists of rapid deterioration in kidney function in individuals with cirrhosis or fulminant liver failure. HRS is usually fatal unless a liver transplant is performed, although various treatments, such as dialysis, can prevent advancement of the condition.\n\nHRS can affect individuals with cirrhosis, severe alcoholic hepatitis, or liver failure, and usually occurs when liver function deteriorates rapidly because of a sudden insult such as an infection, bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract, or overuse of diuretic medications. HRS is a relatively common complication of cirrhosis, occurring in 18% of people within one year of their diagnosis, and in 39% within five years of their diagnosis. Deteriorating liver function is believed to cause changes in the circulation that supplies the intestines, altering blood flow and blood vessel tone in the kidneys. The kidney failure of HRS is a consequence of these changes in blood flow, rather than direct damage to the kidney. The diagnosis of hepatorenal syndrome is based on laboratory tests of individuals susceptible to the condition. Two forms of hepatorenal syndrome have been defined: Type 1 HRS entails a rapidly progressive decline in kidney function, while type 2 HRS is associated with ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdomen) that does not improve with standard diuretic medications.\n\nThe risk of death in hepatorenal syndrome is very high; the mortality of individuals with type 1 HRS is over 50% over the short term, as determined by historical case series. The only long-term treatment option for the condition is liver transplantation. While awaiting transplantation, people with HRS often receive other treatments that improve the abnormalities in blood vessel tone, including supportive care with medications, or the insertion of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), which is a small shunt placed to reduce blood pressure in the portal vein. Some patients may require hemodialysis to support kidney function, or a newer technique called liver dialysis which uses a dialysis circuit with albumin-bound membranes to bind and remove toxins normally cleared by the liver, providing a means of extracorporeal liver support until transplantation can be performed.\n\nHepatorenal syndrome is a particular and common type of kidney failure that affects individuals with liver cirrhosis or, less commonly, with fulminant liver failure. The syndrome involves constriction of the blood vessels of the kidneys and dilation of blood vessels in the splanchnic circulation, which supplies the intestines. The classification of hepatorenal syndrome identifies two categories of kidney failure, termed \"type 1\" and \"type 2\" HRS, which both occur in individuals with either cirrhosis or fulminant liver failure. In both categories, the deterioration in kidney function is quantified either by an elevation in creatinine level in the blood, or by decreased clearance of creatinine in the urine.\n\nType 1 HRS is characterized by rapidly progressive kidney failure, with a doubling of serum creatinine to a level greater than 221 μmol/L (2.5 mg/dL) or a halving of the creatinine clearance to less than 20 mL/min over a period of less than two weeks. The prognosis of individuals with type 1 HRS is particularly grim, with a mortality rate exceeding 50% after one month. Patients with type 1 HRS are usually ill, may have low blood pressure, and may require therapy with drugs to improve the strength of heart muscle contraction (inotropes) or other drugs to maintain blood pressure (vasopressors). Unlike type II, in type I hepatorenal syndrome the kidney failure improves with treatment and stabilizes. Vasoconstrictors and volume expanders are the mainstay of treatment.\n\nIn contrast, type 2 HRS is slower in onset and progression, and is not associated with an inciting event. It is defined by an increase in serum creatinine level to >133 μmol/L (1.5 mg/dL) or a creatinine clearance of less than 40 mL/min, and a urine sodium < 10 μmol/L. It also carries a poor outlook, with a median survival of approximately six months unless the affected individual undergoes liver transplantation. Type 2 HRS is thought to be part of a spectrum of illness associated with increased pressures in the portal vein circulation, which begins with the development of fluid in the abdomen (ascites). The spectrum continues with \"diuretic-resistant ascites\", where the kidneys are unable to excrete sufficient sodium to clear the fluid even with the use of diuretic medications. Most individuals with type 2 HRS have diuretic-resistant ascites before they develop deterioration in kidney function.\n\nBoth types of hepatorenal syndrome share three major components: altered liver function, abnormalities in circulation, and kidney failure. As these phenomena may not necessarily produce symptoms until late in their course, individuals with hepatorenal syndrome are typically diagnosed with the condition on the basis of altered laboratory tests. Most people who develop HRS have cirrhosis, and may have signs and symptoms of the same, which can include jaundice, altered mental status, evidence of decreased nutrition, and the presence of ascites. Specifically, the production of ascites that is resistant to the use of diuretic medications is characteristic of type 2 HRS. Oliguria, which is a decrease in urine volume, may occur as a consequence of kidney failure; however, some individuals with HRS continue to produce a normal amount of urine. As these signs and symptoms may not necessarily occur in HRS, they are not included in the major and minor criteria for making a diagnosis of this condition; instead HRS is diagnosed in an individual at risk for the condition on the basis of the results of laboratory tests, and the exclusion of other causes.\n\nHepatorenal syndrome usually affects individuals with cirrhosis and elevated pressures in the portal vein system (termed portal hypertension). While HRS may develop in any type of cirrhosis, it is most common in individuals with alcoholic cirrhosis, particularly if there is concomitant alcoholic hepatitis identifiable on liver biopsies. HRS can also occur in individuals without cirrhosis, but with acute onset of liver failure, termed fulminant liver failure.\n\nCertain precipitants of HRS have been identified in vulnerable individuals with cirrhosis or fulminant liver failure. These include bacterial infection, acute alcoholic hepatitis, or bleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, which is the infection of ascites fluid, is the most common precipitant of HRS in cirrhotic individuals. HRS can sometimes be triggered by treatments for complications of liver disease: iatrogenic precipitants of HRS include the aggressive use of diuretic medications or the removal of large volumes of ascitic fluid by paracentesis from the abdominal cavity without compensating for fluid losses by intravenous replacement.\n\nThere can be many causes of kidney failure in individuals with cirrhosis or fulminant liver failure. Consequently, it is a challenge to distinguish hepatorenal syndrome from other entities that cause kidney failure in the setting of advanced liver disease. As a result, additional major and minor criteria have been developed to assist in the diagnosis of hepatorenal syndrome.\n\nThe major criteria include liver disease with portal hypertension; kidney failure; the absence of shock, infection, recent treatment with medications that affect the function of the kidney (nephrotoxins), and fluid losses; the absence of sustained improvement in kidney function despite treatment with 1.5 litres of intravenous normal saline; the absence of proteinuria (protein in the urine); and, the absence of kidney disease or obstruction of kidney outflow as seen on ultrasound.\n\nThe minor criteria are the following: a low urine volume (less than per day), low sodium concentration in the urine, a urine osmolality that is greater than that in the blood, the absence of red blood cells in the urine, and a serum sodium concentration of less than 130 mmol/L.\n\nMany other diseases of the kidney are associated with liver disease and must be excluded before making a diagnosis of hepatorenal syndrome. Individuals with pre-renal kidney failure do not have damage to the kidneys, but as in individuals with HRS, have kidney dysfunction due to decreased blood flow to the kidneys. Also, similarly to HRS, pre-renal kidney failure causes the formation of urine that has a very low sodium concentration. In contrast to HRS, however, pre-renal kidney failure usually responds to treatment with intravenous fluids, resulting in reduction in serum creatinine and increased excretion of sodium. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) involves damage to the tubules of the kidney, and can be a complication in individuals with cirrhosis, because of exposure to toxic medications or the development of decreased blood pressure. Because of the damage to the tubules, ATN affected kidneys usually are unable to maximally resorb sodium from the urine. As a result, ATN can be distinguished from HRS on the basis of laboratory testing, as individuals with ATN will have urine sodium measurements that are much higher than in HRS; however, this may not always be the case in cirrhotics. Individuals with ATN also may have evidence of hyaline casts or muddy-brown casts in the urine on microscopy, whereas the urine of individuals with HRS is typically devoid of cellular material, as the kidneys have not been directly injured. Some viral infections of the liver, including hepatitis B and hepatitis C can also lead to inflammation of the glomerulus of the kidney. Other causes of kidney failure in individuals with liver disease include drug toxicity (notably, the antibiotic gentamicin) or contrast nephropathy, caused by intravenous administration of contrast agents used for medical imaging tests.\n\nThe kidney failure in hepatorenal syndrome is believed to arise from abnormalities in blood vessel tone in the kidneys. The predominant theory (termed the \"underfill\" theory) is that blood vessels in the kidney circulation are constricted because of the dilation of blood vessels in the splanchnic circulation (which supplies the intestines), which is mediated by factors released by liver disease. Nitric oxide, prostaglandins, and other vasoactive substances have been hypothesized as powerful mediators of splanchnic vasodilation in cirrhosis. The consequence of this phenomenon is a decrease in the \"effective\" volume of blood sensed by the juxtaglomerular apparatus, leading to the secretion of renin and the activation of the renin–angiotensin system, which results in the vasoconstriction of vessels systemically and in the kidney specifically. However, the effect of this is insufficient to counteract the mediators of vasodilation in the splanchnic circulation, leading to persistent \"underfilling\" of the kidney circulation and worsening kidney vasoconstriction, leading to kidney failure.\n\nStudies to quantify this theory have shown that there is an overall decreased systemic vascular resistance in hepatorenal syndrome, but that the measured femoral and kidney fractions of cardiac output are respectively increased and reduced, suggesting that splanchnic vasodilation is implicated in the kidney failure. Many vasoactive chemicals have been hypothesized as being involved in mediating the systemic hemodynamic changes, including atrial natriuretic factor, prostacyclin, thromboxane A2, and endotoxin. In addition to this, it has been observed that the administration of medications to counteract splanchnic vasodilation (such as ornipressin, terlipressin, and octreotide) leads to improvement in glomerular filtration rate (which is a quantitative measure of kidney function) in patients with hepatorenal syndrome, providing further evidence that splanchnic vasodilation is a key feature of its pathogenesis.\n\nThe underfill theory involves activation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system, which leads to an increase in absorption of sodium from the kidney tubule (termed \"renal sodium avidity\") mediated by aldosterone, which acts on mineralocorticoid receptors in the distal convoluted tubule. This is believed to be a key step in the pathogenesis of ascites in cirrhotics as well. It has been hypothesized that the progression from ascites to hepatorenal syndrome is a spectrum where splanchnic vasodilation defines both resistance to diuretic medications in ascites (which is commonly seen in type 2 HRS) and the onset of kidney vasoconstriction (as described above) leading to hepatorenal syndrome.\n\nThe risk of death in hepatorenal syndrome is very high; consequently, there is a significant emphasis on the identification of patients who are at risk for HRS, and prevention of triggers for onset of HRS. As infection (specifically spontaneous bacterial peritonitis) and gastrointestinal hemorrhage are both complications in individuals with cirrhosis, and are common triggers for HRS, specific care is made in early identification and treatment of cirrhotics with these complications to prevent HRS. Some of the triggers for HRS are induced by treatment of ascites and can be preventable. The aggressive use of diuretic medications should be avoided. In addition, many medications that are either used to treat cirrhotic complications (such as some antibiotics) or other conditions may cause sufficient impairment in kidney function in the cirrhotic to lead to HRS. Also, large volume paracentesis—which is the removal of ascites fluid from the abdomen using a needle or catheter in order to relieve discomfort—may cause enough alteration in hemodynamics to precipitate HRS, and should be avoided in individuals at risk. The concomitant infusion of albumin can avert the circulatory dysfunction that occurs after large-volume paracentesis and may prevent HRS. Conversely, in individuals with very tense ascites, it has been hypothesized that removal of ascitic fluid may improve kidney function if it decreases the pressure on the renal veins.\n\nIndividuals with ascites that have become infected spontaneously (termed spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or SBP) are at an especially high risk for the development of HRS. In individuals with SBP, one randomized controlled trial found that the administration of intravenous albumin on the day of admission and on the third day in hospital reduced both the rate of kidney insufficiency and the mortality rate.\n\nThe definitive treatment for hepatorenal syndrome is liver transplantation, and all other therapies can best be described as bridges to transplantation. While liver transplantation is by far the best available management option for HRS, the mortality of individuals with HRS has been shown to be as high as 25% within the first month after transplantation. Individuals with HRS and evidence of greater hepatic dysfunction (quantified as MELD scores above 36) have been found to be at greatest risk of early mortality after liver transplantation. A further deterioration of kidney function even after liver transplantation in individuals with HRS has been demonstrated in several studies; however, this is transient and thought to be due to the use of medications with toxicity to the kidneys, and specifically the introduction of immunosuppressants such as tacrolimus and cyclosporine that are known to worsen kidney function. Over the long-term, however, individuals with HRS who are the recipients of liver transplants almost universally recover kidney function, and studies show that their survival rates at three years are similar to those who have received liver transplants for reasons other than HRS.\n\nIn anticipation of liver transplantation (which may be associated with considerable in-hospital delay), several other strategies have been found to be beneficial in preserving kidney function. These include the use of intravenous albumin infusion, medications (for which the best evidence is for analogues of vasopressin, which causes splanchnic vasoconstriction), radiological shunts to decrease pressure in the portal vein, dialysis, and a specialized albumin-bound membrane dialysis system termed molecular adsorbents recirculation system (MARS) or liver dialysis.\n\nMany major studies showing improvement in kidney function in patients with hepatorenal syndrome have involved expansion of the volume of the plasma with albumin given intravenously. The quantity of albumin administered intravenously varies: one cited regimen is 1 gram of albumin per kilogram of body weight intravenously on the first day, followed by 20 to 40 grams daily. Notably, studies have shown that treatment with albumin alone is inferior to treatment with other medications in conjunction with albumin; most studies evaluating pre-transplant therapies for HRS involve the use of albumin in conjunction with other medical or procedural treatment.\n\nMidodrine is an alpha-agonist and octreotide is an analogue of somatostatin, a hormone involved in regulation of blood vessel tone in the gastrointestinal tract. The medications are respectively systemic vasoconstrictors and inhibitors of splanchnic vasodilation, and were not found to be useful when used individually in treatment of hepatorenal syndrome. However, one study of 13 patients with hepatorenal syndrome showed significant improvement in kidney function when the two were used together (with midodrine given orally, octreotide given subcutaneously and both dosed according to blood pressure), with three patients surviving to discharge. Another nonrandomized, observational study of individuals with HRS treated with subcutaneous octreotide and oral midodrine showed that there was increased survival at 30 days.\n\nThe vasopressin analogue ornipressin was found in a number of studies to be useful in improvement of kidney function in patients with hepatorenal syndrome, but has been limited in its use, as it can cause severe ischemia to major organs. Terlipressin is a vasopressin analogue that has been found in one large study to be useful for improving kidney function in patients with hepatorenal syndrome with a lesser incidence of ischemia but is not available in the United States. A key criticism of all of these medical therapies has been heterogeneity in the populations investigated and the use of kidney function, instead of mortality, as an outcome measure.\n\nOther agents that have been investigated for use in treatment of HRS include pentoxifylline, acetylcysteine, and misoprostol. The evidence for all of these therapies is based on either case series, or in the case of pentoxifylline, extrapolated from a subset of patients treated for alcoholic hepatitis.\n\nA transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) involves the decompression of the high pressures in the portal circulation by placing a small stent between a portal and hepatic vein. This is done through radiologically guided catheters which are passed into the hepatic vein either through the internal jugular vein or the femoral vein. Theoretically, a decrease in portal pressures is thought to reverse the hemodynamic phenomena that ultimately lead to the development of hepatorenal syndrome. TIPS has been shown to improve kidney function in patients with hepatorenal syndrome. Complications of TIPS for treatment of HRS include the worsening of hepatic encephalopathy (as the procedure involves the forced creation of a porto-systemic shunt, effectively bypassing the ability of the liver to clear toxins), inability to achieve adequate reduction in portal pressure, and bleeding.\n\nLiver dialysis involves extracorporeal dialysis to remove toxins from the circulation, usually through the addition of a second dialysis circuit that contains an albumin-bound membrane. The molecular adsorbents recirculation system (MARS) has shown some utility as a bridge to transplantation in patients with hepatorenal syndrome, yet the technique is still nascent.\n\nRenal replacement therapy may be required to bridge individuals with hepatorenal syndrome to liver transplantation, although the condition of the patient may dictate the modality used. The use of dialysis, however, does not lead to recuperation or preservation of kidney function in patients with HRS, and is essentially only used to avoid complications of kidney failure until transplantation can take place. In patients who undergo hemodialysis, there may even be an increased risk of mortality due to low blood pressure in patients with HRS, although appropriate studies have yet to be performed. As a result, the role of renal replacement therapy in patients with HRS remains unclear.\n\nAs the majority of individuals with hepatorenal syndrome have cirrhosis, much of the epidemiological data on HRS comes from the cirrhotic population. The condition is quite common: approximately 10% of individuals admitted to hospital with ascites have HRS. A retrospective case series of cirrhotic patients treated with terlipressin suggested that 20.0% of acute kidney failure in cirrhotics was due to type 1 HRS, and 6.6% was due to type 2 HRS. It is estimated that 18% of individuals with cirrhosis and ascites will develop HRS within one year of their diagnosis with cirrhosis, and 39% of these individuals will develop HRS within five years of diagnosis. Three independent risk factors for the development of HRS in cirrhotics have been identified: liver size, plasma renin activity, and serum sodium concentration.\n\nThe prognosis of these patients is grim with untreated patients having an extremely short survival. The severity of liver disease (as evidenced by the MELD score) has been shown to be a determinant of outcome. Some patients without cirrhosis develop HRS, with an incidence of about 20% seen in one study of ill patients with alcoholic hepatitis.\n\nThe first reports of kidney failure occurring in individuals with chronic liver diseases were from the late 19th century by Frerichs and Flint. However, the hepatorenal syndrome was first defined as acute kidney failure that occurred in the setting of biliary surgery. The syndrome was soon re-associated with advanced liver disease, and, in the 1950s, was clinically defined by Sherlock, Hecker, Papper and Vessin as being associated with systemic hemodynamic abnormalities and high mortality. Hecker and Sherlock specifically identified that individuals with HRS had low urinary output, very low sodium in the urine, and no protein in the urine. Murray Epstein was the first to characterize splanchnic vasodilation and kidney vasoconstriction as the key alterations in hemodynamics in patients with the syndrome. The functional nature of the kidney impairment in HRS was crystallized by studies demonstrating that kidneys transplanted from patients with hepatorenal syndrome returned to function in the new host, leading to the hypothesis that hepatorenal syndrome was a systemic condition and not a kidney disease. The first systematic attempt to define hepatorenal syndrome was made in 1994 by the International Ascites Club, a group of liver specialists. The more recent history of HRS has involved elucidation of the various vasoactive mediators that cause the splanchnic and kidney blood flow abnormalities of the condition.\n"}

Brahms composed the work during the summer of 1880 as a tribute to the University of Breslau, which had notified him that it would award him an honorary doctorate in philosophy.\n\nInitially, Brahms had contented himself with sending a simple handwritten note of acknowledgment to the University, since he loathed the public fanfare of celebrity. However, the conductor Bernard Scholz, who had nominated him for the degree, convinced him that protocol required him to make a grander gesture of gratitude. The University expected nothing less than a musical offering from the composer. \"Compose a fine symphony for us!\" he wrote to Brahms. \"But well orchestrated, old boy, not too uniformly thick!\"\n\nBrahms, who was known to be an ironic joker, filled his quota by creating a \"very boisterous potpourri of student drinking songs à la Suppé\" in an intricately designed structure made to appear loose and episodic, thus drawing on the \"academic\" for both his sources and their treatment.\n\nThe work sparkles with some of the finest virtues of Brahms's orchestral technique, sometimes applied for comic effect, such as the bassoons that inflate the light subject of \"\"Fuchslied\"\" (\"Was kommt dort von der Höh?\"). The inventive treatment includes tunes appropriated from the student ditties \"\"Fuchslied\"\", \"\"Wir hatten gebauet ein stattliches Haus\"\", \"\"Hört, ich sing das Lied der Lieder\"\", and most memorably, the broad, triumphant finale on \"\"Gaudeamus igitur\"\", which succinctly engages Brahms's sophisticated mastery of counterpoint, further fulfilling the \"academic\" aspect of his program, cheekily applied to the well-worn melody. Brahms manages to evoke ravishing euphoria without sacrificing his commitment to classical balance.\n\nThe blend of orchestral colors is carefully planned and highlighted in the piece, which, in spite of Scholz's request, calls for one of the largest ensembles for any of his compositions: piccolo, two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets (both doubling in B and C clarinets), two bassoons, contrabassoon, four horns (two in C and two in E), three C trumpets, three trombones, one tuba, timpani, bass drum, cymbals, triangle, and strings.\n\nThe Overture consists of four continuous sections:\n\nThe composer himself conducted the premiere of the overture, and received his honorary degree, at a special convocation held by the University on January 4, 1881. To the chagrin (or mischievous delight) of many of the academics in the audience, there was an \"ironic\" contrast between the mood of the student drinking songs and the seriousness of a ceremony.\n\nBecause of its easily grasped structure, its lyrical warmth, and its excitement and humor, the work has remained a staple of today's concert-hall repertoire. A typical performance lasts around ten minutes.\n\nCary Grant in his role as Dr. Noah Praetorius conducts the Overture at the beginning and end of the 1951 Joseph L. Mankiewicz/Darryl F. Zanuck film, \"People Will Talk\", and part of the piece can also be heard in the opening theme of the 1978 film, \"National Lampoon's Animal House\", an ironic gesture given that the classic music was originally based on German fraternity drinking songs. In the 1967 film \"Bedazzled\", Dudley Moore, as a pretentious pseudo-intellectual Welsh student, and Eleanor Bron lie on the floor listening to the beginning of the Overture on an LP until the record begins to skip (thanks to a scratch deliberately made in the LP by Peter Cook as the Devil earlier in the film).\nThe song Catch a Falling Star, made famous by Perry Como was based on the third melody in just before the Gaudeamus Igitur.\n\n"}

The title was taken from the name of one of Mitchell’s albums, which in turn took it from the French title of the movie \"The Last Picture Show\".\n\nHe is also the voice of Dylan (Flappy) in the French version of the 2005 film of \"The Magic Roundabout\", as well as the voice of Chanticleer in the French version of \"Rock-a-Doodle\".\n\n\nEddy Mitchell recorded many albums mainly in the U.K. and in the United States, in the following locations:\n\n\n\n"}

The series follows Adrian Monk (Tony Shalhoub), a private detective with obsessive–compulsive disorder and multiple phobias, and his assistant Sharona Flemming (Bitty Schram). In this episode, Monk travels to New York City in an attempt to discover his wife's killer, but may solve the case of the death of the Latvian ambassador.\n\nWritten by Andy Breckman and directed by Randall Zisk, \"Mr. Monk Takes Manhattan\" was shot in New York. When the episode first aired in the United States on USA Network on June 18, 2004, it was watched by 5.5 million viewers. The episode garnered a mixed reaction from critics, praising the comedy obtained through putting Monk in a scenario that would arouse his fears while criticizing Monk's exaggerated reactions to the setting.\n\nDetective Adrian Monk (Tony Shalhoub) flies to New York City to find criminal Warrick Tennyson (Frank Collison). In the preceding episode, criminal Dale \"The Whale\" Biederbeck (Tim Curry) told Monk that Tennyson was involved in the murder of Monk's wife, Trudy. On the trip, Monk is accompanied by his nurse Sharona Fleming (Bitty Schram), and police officers Captain Stottlemeyer (Ted Levine) and Lieutenant Disher (Jason Gray-Stanford). They stay at the same hotel as the Latvian ambassador, who is subsequently discovered shot to death along with his two bodyguards. Police Captain Walter Cage (Mykelti Williamson) asks for Monk's help in solving the murder. Monk notices the ambassador's coat is damp, even though it had been dry minutes before the murder.\n\nThe four retrace the ambassador's movements that day, discovering that he had stopped at a bar before arriving at the hotel. Then, Stottlemeyer and Disher go back to the precinct to try to get a bead on Tennyson's location while Monk and Sharona discover that the ambassador's final words meant \"This is not my coat\". Stottlemeyer breaks into Cage's office to discover that Tennyson is dying in a hospital and has days left to live. Stottlemeyer confronts Cage, who says the only way he will allow access to Tennyson is if Monk solves the ambassador's murder.\n\nMonk is briefly separated from the group after accidentally boarding the wrong train at Hoyt–Schermerhorn Streets. While reuniting with his partners he notices Steven Leight (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) being interviewed on a TV screen in Times Square about the recent murder of his wife. Noticing Leight eating a mint from the same bar the ambassador had last been seen, Monk insists Steven Leight is the ambassador's murderer, despite the lack of supporting evidence. To support his theory, Monk proposes that Leight stole his wife's jewelry to stage a robbery, then proceeded to the bar before calling the police. He asserts Leight and the ambassador were wearing essentially identical coats, and that they must have been switched accidentally at the bar. As rain falls, Leight locates the ambassador's hotel room, and subsequently kills both him and his bodyguards, and switches the newly wet coat with his own.\n\nSubsequently, a ballistics report confirms that Leight killed his wife and the ambassador with the same gun and Leight is arrested. Having solved the case, Monk is allowed to visit Tennyson who remembers being hired by a man who had six fingers on his right hand. Tennyson asks for forgiveness, but Monk cannot bring himself to give it. He turns off Tennyson's morphine drip saying, \"This is me, turning off your morphine;\" but a few moments later, he says, \"This is Trudy, the woman you killed, turning it back on,\" and does.\n\nThe foursome prepares to leave New York, having gotten a step further in solving Monk's most important case.\n\n\"Mr. Monk Takes Manhattan\" was written by Andy Breckman and directed by Randall Zisk. Series creator and executive producer Breckman was credited for the script for the fifth time in the series, while it was the sixth time Zisk worked on a \"Monk\" episode. While \"Monk's\" second season was entirely filmed and produced in Los Angeles, \"Mr. Monk Takes Manhattan\" was shot in New York City in March 2004.\n\nIn the series' plot, Trudy was killed years prior to its first episode, which led Monk to develop obsessive–compulsive disorder and to be discharged from the San Francisco Police Department. At the beginning of the third season, executive producer and co-creator David Hoberman said the staff felt it was a good idea to explore Trudy's death. They were, however, careful about the manner in which they mentioned her death and Monk's desire to find the culprit. This was out of concern that they would \"burden\" the series with it.\n\n\"Mr. Monk Takes Manhattan\" was first broadcast in the United States on the USA Network at 9 pm EST on June 18, 2004. According to Nielsen Media Research, the episode was viewed by an estimated number of 5.9 million viewers. It was the third most watched program on cable television that week with a 3.6 percent household rating and a household audience of 3.9 million.\n\nCurrentFilm.com and MovieFreak.com's Dennis Landmann qualified it as one of the best episodes of the season. \"Seattle Post-Intelligencer\"s Melanie McFarland said although it is \"a fecund opportunity for cheap laughs\", Shalhoub was able to keep the \"balance between Monk's power and helplessness without caving into lower comedic impulses.\" McFarland praised its writing and Shalhoub, saying \"It would begin to look like shoddy choreography\" if they were not good. \"A welcome return\" was how it was described by Robert Lloyd from the \"Los Angeles Times\" who asserted its \"pleasures are all in the predictable eccentricities of its characters, and the fact that it's clearly being staged for our benefit.\" Ted Cox of the Chicago-area \"Daily Herald\" praised the scene when Monk forgives Tennyson dubbing it \"great TV.\" Chris Hicks of \"Deseret News\" deemed it as \"a terrific example of how the writers come up with simple situations that throw Monk into turmoil but also allow us to identify with him: Monk in Manhattan. The crowds, the noise, the confusion. Perfect.\"\n\nNot all reviews were positive. David Bianculli, writing in the \"New York Daily News\", stated that the idea of putting Monk in New York \"sound[ed] great\" on paper but it did not take advantage of what could be \"a delightful study in contrasts.\" Bianculli called it a \"misstep\", criticizing its premise and how it was not able to keep the balance between comedy and drama that made it \"too outrageous.\" A review for \"The Beaver County Times\" considered it a \"stunt episode\" and its humor \"uncharacteristically forced\", saying it \"really doesn't do justice to the show's considerable charms.\" Steve Johnson of the \"Chicago Tribune\" affirmed that while the premise is funny, \"the writers go out of their way to play the city against his condition.\" He continued by saying it \"wouldn't be so bad\" if he went to solve crimes \"but Friday's first case is a real stretch.\" Although excited for the episode's premise prior to its broadcast, Austin Smith of the \"New York Post\" was very critical of it. Smith said in this episode \"the producers have him [Monk] crossing that fine line between genius and insanity, transforming our hero into a full-blown mental patient.\" He also criticized the \"Mr. Monk vs. the City of New York\" scenes as they do not further the episode's plot. Smith's co-worker, Linda Stasi also panned the episode, considering Monk's reactions \"caricature[d]\". Stasi wrote, \"It's one thing to be an obsessive/compulsive ex-detective who lines up the pins on the murder map and it's another to act like you've got a pin in your brain.\" As did Smith, Kay McFadden of \"The Seattle Times\" called the jokes \"predictable\" and said, \"If you aren't a \"Monk\" fan, these devices may strike you as altogether shopworn.\"\n\n"}

HIMSS is a US 501(c)6 organization.\n\nHIMSS was organized in 1961 as the Hospital Management Systems Society (HMSS), an independent, unincorporated, nonprofit association of individuals. The society was co-founded by Edward J. Gerner and Harold E. Smalley. In late 1961, the constitution of the HIMSS was drafted and approved, and in 1962, the first national convention was held in Baltimore. In 1963, the second national HIMSS convention was held in Chicago, and the following year the HIMSS national headquarters were moved there. In 1967, the Bylaws, Rules and Regulations of HIMSS were written and approved. By 1982, HIMSS had 15 affiliated chapters (14 in the US and 1 in Australia). In 1986, the HIMSS was renamed to include \"Information\" in the title. By 1996, membership had grown to 7,500. , HIMSS has more than 80,000 individual members.

He succeeded H. Stephen Lieber, who had served in those positions since 2000.\n\nHIMSS' Electronic Medical Record Adoption Model is the most widely used assessment of digital excellence in healthcare internationally. The model goes from Stage 0 to Stage 7 and describes the adoption and use of electronic health records by hospitals. Stage 7 includes no use of paper charts and computerized provider order entry and clinical decision support systems are used in over 90% of the hospital. HIMSS Stage 7 remains an uncommon achievement. In 2018, 6% of hospitals in the US had achieved HIMSS Stage 7.

He is best known for his appearances with the World Wrestling Federation under the ring names The Tonga Kid and Tama and with World Championship Wrestling as The Samoan Savage.\n\nFatu debuted as a professional wrestler in 1983, after being trained by the Wild Samoans. Shortly after debuting he joined the World Wrestling Federation as \"Samoan No. 4,\" wrestling at untelevised house shows before making his television debut in the fall of 1983 as the Tonga Kid. Billed as the cousin of Superfly Jimmy Snuka, he entered into his first major feud with Snuka's rival Roddy Piper.\n\nIn late 1986, he teamed with Tonga Fifita, who was wrestling under the name King Tonga. Fatu was renamed to Tama, while Fifita was renamed to Haku. Together, they were christened The Islanders. The Islanders gained several key victories, including a tag team battle royal victory over Big John Studd and King Kong Bundy, but ultimately failed to gain the interest of fans. The two were eventually repackaged as villains in April 1987 after attacking The Can-Am Connection during a match; the team was now managed by Bobby Heenan, and used an aggressive, savage style of wrestling as opposed to a scientific style.\n\nIn the fall of 1987, they began a feud with Strike Force, and while the two teams generally traded victories during the early part of the feud, once Strike Force won the WWF Tag Team Championship, the Islanders began finding themselves on the losing end, despite having several attempts. In early December 1987, the Islanders were disqualified from a match with the British Bulldogs when they kidnapped the Bulldogs' dog, Matilda. The Islanders were indefinitely suspended in the storyline until Matilda was found. From late January 1988 until early February, the Islanders were consistently beaten by the British Bulldogs.\n\nAt a \"Saturday Night's Main Event XV\" on March 7, they beat the Killer Bees, a tag team consisting of Brian Blair and Jim Brunzell. At Wrestlemania 4, the Islanders, with Bobby Heenan, defeated the Bulldogs and Koko B. Ware, with Matilda. On April 21, Heenan introduced Siva Afi as the newest member of the group, but Afi never made another appearance with the Islanders. Fatu then left the WWF.\n\nAfter leaving the WWF, Fatu began performing for the World Wrestling Council in Puerto Rico as \"Tama\". On January 6, 1989, he and Dan Kroffat defeated The Batten Twins to win the WWC World Tag Team Championship. The Batten Twins regained the championship on March 4, 1989.\n\nIn 1989, Fatu joined World Championship Wrestling, where he adopted the ring name \"The Samoan Savage\" and began teaming with his brother Fatu and his cousin Samu as The Samoan SWAT Team. The trio were managed by \"The Big Kahuna\" Oliver Humperdink. In late 1989, Samu withdrew from in-ring competition and The Samoan SWAT Team was renamed \"The New Wild Samoans\". At Starrcade in December 1989, The New Wild Samoans competed in the Iron Team round-robin tournament, placing third.\n\nThe New Wild Samoans left WCW in the summer of 1990.\n\nAfter leaving WCW, Fatu (wrestling as \"The Samoan Savage\") journeyed to Mexico to perform for the Universal Wrestling Association along with his brother Fatu and his cousin, The Great Kokina. Billed as \"The Hawaiian Beasts\", the trio won the UWA World Trios Championship from Los Villanos on April 7, 1991. Los Villanos regained the championship on May 31, 1991.\nFatu competed on the independent circuit until retiring in 2011. In 2005 and 2006, he wrestled in Italy with the Nu Wrestling Evolution promotion.\n\nFatu appeared as \"The Tonga Kid\" in the opening scene of the 1986 film \"Highlander\", where he was involved in a six-man tag team match with Greg Gagne and Jim Brunzell against The Fabulous Freebirds at the Meadowlands Arena. He also starred as \"Tonga Tom\" in the 1987 wrestling film \"Body Slam\", along with Dirk Benedict and Roddy Piper.\n\nFatu was featured in an April 2020 documentary for Vice's \"Dark Side of the Ring\" series, revealing new information on the May 1983 homicide of Nancy Argentino.\n\nFatu is a member of the famous Anoaʻi family. He is the nephew of Sika Anoaʻi and Afa Anoaʻi, known as the Wild Samoans. He is the twin brother of Solofa Fatu Jr. (Headshrinker Fatu/Rikishi). Samuel is the father of Jacob Fatu, who currently wrestles for Major League Wrestling (MLW). In November 2008, Fatu's wife, Theresa Fuavai-Fatu, went into cardiac arrest while giving birth. Her heart stopped completely before the twins, Marley and Myracle, could be delivered by Caesarean section, but she was spontaneously revived and eventually recovered. This type of incident is very rare, with one of the cardiac surgeons who was working on Theresa saying that he had never seen surviving mothers or babies. Sam is the older brother of Eddie Fatu (Umaga/Jamal), who died of a heart attack on December 4, 2009.\n\nOther members of the family in professional wrestling include Solafa's twin sons, Jonathan and Joshua Samuel, who currently wrestle in WWE as Jimmy Uso and Jey Uso, and his cousins in wrestling are Rodney Anoaʻi (Yokozuna), Samula Anoaʻi (Headshrinker Samu), Matt Anoaʻi (Rosey), Leati Anoaʻi (Roman Reigns), Reno Anoaʻi (Black Pearl), Afa Anoaʻi Jr. (Manu), and Lloyd Anoaʻi (L.A.

It was first published in 1987. It is the fourth book to be published after the death of René Goscinny and is thus both written and drawn by Albert Uderzo alone.\n\nThe full original French title was \"Astérix chez Rahàzade ou Le compte des mille et une heures\" (\"Asterix meets Orinjade or the 1001 Hours Countdown\"), a reference to Queen Scheherazade who tells the famous 1001 Arabian Nights collection of stories.\n\nFollowing the rebuilding of the Gaulish village after Brutus' attack in the previous story, Chief Vitalstatistix is trying to give a speech, when he is interrupted by the bard Cacofonix, whose song causes rain. This introduces Watziznehm the fakir, who falls from his flying carpet. Watziznehm explains he was searching for the village because he needs to make it rain in his country, a kingdom in the Ganges Valley, within the following 1001 hours, otherwise Princess Orinjade, daughter of Rajah Wotzit, will be sacrificed to the gods. This prophecy is part of an evil scheme by Grand Vizier Hoodunnit, to seize the throne.\n\nVitalstatistix agrees to send the rain-making Cacofonix to India, accompanied by Asterix, Obelix, and Dogmatix. All five mount the flying carpet; but their journey is often interrupted either by Obelix's insistence on stopping for food, by Cacofonix's attempts to sing, and once by a lightning strike which forces them to replace the carpet. The Gauls eventually arrive in India with exactly 30 hours, 30 minutes, and 30 seconds to save Orinjade; but Cacofonix has lost his voice during the journey, and Rajah Wotzit's doctors proclaim that to regain his voice, Cacofonix must take an overnight bath in a combination of elephant milk, dung and hair. Accordingly, the Gauls and Watziznehm take Cacofonix to elephant-trainer Howdoo and set up the bath; but Hoodunnit sends his henchmen to kidnap the bard and take him to an elephants' graveyard to be trampled by the wild elephant herd.\n\nWatziznehm, Asterix and Obelix set out to rescue the bard, but they are stopped by Owzat, Hoodunnit's fakir sidekick. While Watziznehm and Owzat curse each other, Asterix and Obelix escape to Howdoo, with whom they embark to the elephants' graveyard. After delays by tigers, monkeys, a rhinoceros and Hoodunnit's henchmen, they find Cacofonix alive and well, his smell having placated the elephants. Meanwhile, Watziznehm defeats Owzat and recovers the Gauls on his flying carpet.\n\nAt the execution grounds, Asterix saves Orinjade, while Watziznehm intercepts Hoodunnit. Cacofonix recovers his voice after a dose of magic potion, and sings, causing rain. At the victory feast in the palace, Obelix surmises that his fellow villagers might be having their customary banquet, this time without him. This is proven true; and at the banquet, some of the Gauls begin to express a desire to retrieve the bard, in fear of a drought, and Fulliautomatix the blacksmith, Cacofonix's habitual menace, appears to be missing him.\n\n\n\n\nOn Goodreads, it has a score of 3.91 out of 5. \n\n"}

The difference between a street elbow and a regular elbow is the gender of its two connections.\n\nA regular elbow has a hub or female-threaded connection on each end, so it can join two male pipes. Instead, a street elbow has a female fitting on one end and a male fitting on the other. The advantage of the street elbow is that it can be connected directly to another fitting without having to use an additional short connecting piece (a pipe nipple).\nStreet elbows are available with bend angles of 90°, 45°, and 22.5°. They can be used in many plumbing applications, including water supply, drainage, sewers, vents, central vacuum systems, compressed air and gas lines, HVAC, sump pump drains, and other locations where plumbing fittings would be used to join sections of pipe.\n\nPlumbing codes regulate the use of street elbows. For example, Canada's national plumbing code prohibits them in natural gas and propane installations:\nStreet elbows and tees are not permitted because these fittings have both male and female threaded ends. This makes alignment of the piping difficult since the direction of the piping does not always correspond with the fully seated position of the fitting. When the connection is backed off to align the piping, leakage may result.\n\n"}

It contains exhibit rooms and an observation deck, and since 1919, has also housed the official Central Park weather station.\n\nBelvedere Castle was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux in 1867–1869. An architectural hybrid of Gothic and Romanesque styles, Vaux's design called for a Manhattan schist and granite structure with a corner tower with conical cap, with the existing lookout over parapet walls between them. Its name comes from belvedere, which means \"beautiful view\" in Italian.\n\nBelvedere Castle was originally built as a shell with open doorway and window openings. The main tower was given a more medieval design, with a weather antenna on top, but during the castle's 1983 renovation, the tower was restored to a German style with a flag, a weather vane, and an anemometer on top. The two fanciful wooden pavilions deteriorated without painting and upkeep and were removed before 1900.\n\nStarting in 1919, Belvedere Castle housed the New York Meteorological Observatory, which had been taken over by the United States Weather Bureau in 1912. The current weather station in Central Park, an Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS), is located immediately south of the castle, though wind equipment is still located on the main tower.\n\nThe castle caps Vista Rock, a outcropping of schist and the park's second-highest natural elevation. (Summit Rock, at 83rd Street overlooking Central Park West, is higher at .) Constructed of Manhattan schist quarried in the park and dressed with gray granite, it tops the natural-looking woodlands of The Ramble, as seen from the formal Bethesda Terrace. The natural rock was tunneled through for the innovative sunken transverse roadway that still carries commercial and other traffic unobtrusively through the park. \n\nThe castle serves now as a visitor center and gift shop. Free family and community programs hosted at Belvedere Castle include birding and other Central Park Conservancy discovery programs for families as well as a variety of history and natural history programs led by NYC Urban Park Rangers, including stargazing/astronomy and wildlife-education events.\n\nThe eastern elevation formerly faced a rectangular receiving reservoir that was part of the Croton Aqueduct system. The reservoir was filled in with city building rubble, beginning with spoil from construction of the New York City Subway's IND Eighth Avenue Line (now carrying the ) in the 1930s. Today, the eastern elevation overlooks the Great Lawn and Turtle Pond, which occupies the former site of the receiving reservoir.\n\nThe castle was designed by the architects Calvert Vaux and Jacob Wrey Mould as an additional feature of the Greensward Plan, created by Vaux and Frederick Law Olmsted. Olmsted and Vaux were re-hired to their positions in mid-1865 after quitting abruptly several years before. In 1867, Vaux decided to develop this area by building Belvedere Castle on the top of the rock, overlooking the Croton Reservoir. The site already held a fire tower under the control of the Croton Aqueduct board, and so the fire tower was demolished.\n\nThe original plans for Belvedere Castle called for two turreted stone towers: a larger structure on the eastern elevation and a smaller structure on the west side. To reduce costs it was revised in November 1870 under the Tammany Hall regime, which had taken over construction by this time, and completed as an open painted-wood pavilion. The eastern structure was completed by 1871, while the western structure was never built. As the plantings matured, the castle has been obscured from its original intended viewpoint. Its turret is the highest point in the park.\n\nAfter the New York Meteorological Observatory automated its equipment and moved its offices to Rockefeller Center in the 1960s, Belvedere Castle was closed to the public and became an object of much vandalism, neglect and deterioration. The Central Park Conservancy launched a restoration effort and reopened the structure on May 1, 1983. The original turret was replaced, the pavilions were rebuilt, and the castle was converted into a visitor center. In 1995, the Conservancy's Historic Preservation Crew replaced the painted wooden loggia of the castle, working from Vaux's designs, on the granite piers and walls that had survived. The same year, a $340,000 grant was distributed toward restoring the castle as the Henry Luce Nature Center. That restoration was completed in 1996.\n\nIn 2018, the Central Park Conservancy conducted a second renovation of Belvedere Castle. Plans included replacing existing doors and windows with double paned glass. In addition the Conservancy proposed to construct a new access path to ADA standards from the East Drive. The access path − actually an elevated ramp with parapets − has been criticized as creating an unnecessary barrier in the otherwise naturalistic park. Following the $12 million renovation, the castle reopened on June 28, 2019.\n\nIn the 1970s, its facade was used for exterior shots of the castle where Count von Count lived on the children's television series \"Sesame Street\". \n\nSoon after its 1983 restoration, the building was used as a filming location for Merchant-Ivory's 1984 film \"The Bostonians\", starring Christopher Reeve and Vanessa Redgrave. \n\nThe castle is depicted in animated form in the season 2 episode \"High Noon\" of the American animated series \"Gargoyles\" when the site is chosen as the location of the episode's climax.\n\nIt is also featured in the 1998 film \"Stepmom\", as a photography location for Julia Roberts' character.\n\nThe castle was also used in the 2011 film \"The Smurfs\" where it served as both the hiding place of the evil sorcerer Gargamel and the location of the film's final battle. \n\nIn the \"DeathSpeaker Codex\" series by Sonya Bateman, the castle is prominent in many of the books as a place where the protagonist, Gideon, goes back to time and time again for various paranormal reasons.\n\n"}

For this reason it has been called the Ellis Island of Trinidad and Tobago.\n\nAt Nelson Island the Indian immigrants and the ship, food and stores were inspected by the Protector of Immigrants. Their bundles and blankets were fumigated and they were quarantined and allowed to recover and regain strength. This measure was designed to prevent the spread of diseases which might have been transported from India. Special effort was made to stop the spread of smallpox and measles. At Nelson Island, the immigrants were examined by a medical doctor and then transported by small boats to Port of Spain. The healthy ones were immediately sent to estates, the sick ones went to the Colonial Hospital in Port of Spain and those who only needed rest were kept at the Depot in Port of Spain.\n\nIn the 1930s Nelson Island was used as a detention center for prisoners, among them Tubal Uriah Butler. During World War II, the Americans built a gun emplacement at the eastern end of the island and a causeway to Rock Island to the west. Nelson Island became a detention center again in 1970 following the Black Power Revolution. Among those who were detained there were Oilfields Workers' Trade Union president George Weekes, National Joint Action Committee leader Geddes Granger, Apoesho Mutope, Winston Suite and Clive Nunez.\n\n"}

Like the closely related true woodcreepers, it is a member of the South American bird family Furnariidae.\n\nThe streaked xenops is typically 4.8 in (12.2 cm) long, weighs 0.44 oz (12.6 g), and has a stubby wedge-shaped bill. The head is dark brown with a whitish supercilium and malar stripe. The upperparts are brown, becoming rufous on the tail and rump, and there is a buff bar on the darker brown wings. The underparts are white-streaked olive brown. Males and females looks alike. Visually inconspicuous, it is easier located by its chattering call, a series of 5 or 6 metallic \"zeet\" notes.\n\nIt is found in wet forests in foothills and mountains between 2,000-7,200 ft (600-2,200 m) ASL, and will utilize secondary forests and opened-up growth. The streaked xenops is often difficult to see as it forages on bark, rotting stumps or bare twigs; it moves in all directions on the trunk like a treecreeper, but does not use its tail as a prop. It feeds on arthropods such as the larvae of wood-boring beetles, but can also catch flying termites in mid-air. It joins mixed-species feeding flocks on a more or less regular basis depending on location, usually moving through the middle levels of the forest.\n\nThe streaked xenops builds its nest by simply placing a few stems and roots in a hole 5–15 ft (1.5-4.5 m) high in a tree. The normal clutch is two white eggs, incubated by both sexes.\n\n\n"}

The route follows Rancho Drive, a major arterial connecting downtown Las Vegas to the northwest part of the city. Much of SR 599 was previously designated as U.S. Route 95 (US 95) prior to completion of the Las Vegas Expressway. The route is also designated as U.S. Route 95 Business (US 95 Bus.).\n\nSR 599 begins at the intersection of Rancho Drive and Redondo Avenue in the city of Las Vegas. From there, the route heads north along Rancho Drive to intersect the US 95 freeway (at exit 77). The highway continues heading northwest for several miles, briefly skirting the western edge of North Las Vegas and providing access to the North Las Vegas Airport. The route reaches its northern terminus at the end of Rancho Drive, at the interchange with US 95 north and Ann Road (at exits 90 and 91).\n\nUS 95 freeway signs for Rancho Drive designate the route as U.S. Route 95 Business, a distinction noted on many maps (including those published by the Nevada Department of Transportation (NDOT)). However, no business route signs are posted along the highway itself and relatively few SR 599 shields can be found on the route.\n\nRancho Drive originally carried State Route 5 from Bonanza Road (present–day State Route 579) northwest out of Las Vegas towards Tonopah—this destination contributed to the road's alternate name of \"Tonopah Highway\". When US 95 was extended into Nevada in 1940, it was routed concurrently with SR 5 on Rancho Drive. The U.S. route remained on Rancho Drive until it was relocated onto the completed Las Vegas Expressway in the early 1980s.

Founded in 1893 as part of the University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire, it is the older of the two medical schools in Wales.\n\nIt is one of the largest medical schools in the United Kingdom, employing nearly 500 academic and 300 support staff; and with over 1000 undergraduate and 1100 postgraduate students enrolled on medical and scientific courses. The school has an annual financial turnover of over £50 million, of which nearly half comes from competitive external research funding. The school is based at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff.\n\nThe medical school was founded as \"Cardiff Medical School\" in 1893 when the Departments of Anatomy, Physiology and Pharmacology were established at University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire (now Cardiff University). \n\nThe opening ceremony took place on 14 February 1894 at the College buildings on Dumfries Place and was conducted by John Viriamu Jones, Principal of the College, and Richard Quain, President of the General Medical Council. During the ceremony professors of the new medical school encouraged it to emulate the recent advances in medical education at the University of Heidelberg. The first Dean of the school was Alfred W. Hughes of Corris.\nA department of Pathology and Bacteriology was added in 1910. Students finishing their preclinical studies at Cardiff went on to other medical schools for their clinical studies, many going to University College Hospital in London, part of University College London.\n\nIn 1921 it became a clinical and pre-clinical medical school with the name of the \"Welsh National School of Medicine\", and in 1931 it became an independent institution of the University of Wales. The name was further changed in 1984, to \"University of Wales College of Medicine\".\n\nIn 2002, ideas were floated to re-merge Cardiff with the University of Wales College of Medicine (UWCM) following the publication of the Welsh Assembly Government's review of higher education in Wales. This merger became effective on 1 August 2004, on which date Cardiff University ceased to be a constituent institution of the University of Wales and became an independent \"link institution\" affiliated to the federal University. The process of the merger was completed on 1 December 2004 when the Act of Parliament transferring UWCM's assets to Cardiff University received Royal Assent. On 17 December it was announced that the Privy Council had given approval to the new Supplemental Charter and had granted university status to Cardiff, legally changing the name of the institution to Cardiff University. Cardiff awarded University of Wales degrees to students admitted before 2005, but these have been replaced by Cardiff degrees. Medicine, dentistry and other health-related areas began to admit students for Cardiff degrees in 2006.\n\nIn 2004, Cardiff University and the Swansea University entered a partnership to provide a four-year graduate-entry medical degree. An annual intake of around 70 post-graduate students undertook an accelerated version of the Cardiff course at the Swansea University for the first two years before joining undergraduate students at Cardiff for the final two years. However, from September 2010 Swansea University began independently providing medical education in a revised 4-yr Graduate Entry Degree.\n\nIn 2005, The Wales College of Medicine, which is part of the University, launched the North Wales Clinical School in Wrexham in collaboration with the North East Wales Institute of Higher Education in Wrexham and Bangor University, previously University of Wales, Bangor, and with the National Health Service in Wales. This has been funded with £12.5 million from the Welsh Assembly and will lead to the trebling of the number of trainee doctors in clinical training in Wales over a four-year period.\n\nBy 2008 the medical school it had an intake of some 305 British medical students per year and an additional 25 students from overseas.\n\nIn November 2011 Cardiff University’s School of Medicine officially opened the Cochrane Building, a health education centre offering students the latest teaching, library and simulation facilities. The Centre's facilities include a Clinical Skills Centre, a high-technology medical simulation centre and a new library. The Cochrane Building provides teaching and learning facilities for all healthcare schools based on the Heath Park Campus and is named after the University’s medical pioneer, Archie Cochrane.\n\nIn 2012, Cardiff University’s School of Medicine and 'Meducation' hosted the Wales Medical Undergraduate Conference, the first national undergraduate medical conference held in Wales, with over 100 posters, and 15 oral presentations taking place and attendees from throughout Europe.\n\nThe school’s major undergraduate programme is the MBBCh in Medicine.\n\nClinical placements occurs in partnership with over a dozen NHS Trusts and over 150 general practices, covering the whole of Wales.\n\nC21 Curriculum\n\nIn 2013, Cardiff School of Medicine launched a major redevelopment of its undergraduate medical education programme. C21 resulted from a comprehensive review of the undergraduate curriculum, its delivery and the supporting structures, mechanisms and processes and improve the quality of the medical education delivered at Cardiff University.\nLed by the Division of Medical Education, and in partnership with colleagues from across the University, student and patient representatives, the NHS and Welsh Assembly Government, C21 consisted of 5 coordinated projects.\n\nIntercalated programmes\n\nSome undergraduate students have the opportunity to undertake an intercalated year at the end of Year 3 or Year 4 of the course.\n\nPost-graduate taught (PGT) schemes\n\nA wide range of post-graduate taught (PGT) schemes is also offered. The school is the largest provider of medically related PGT courses in the UK. These include both conventional and distance learning courses. Many courses are aimed specifically at qualified doctors and health care professionals, such as the Diploma in Practical Dermatology and the MSc in Psychiatry.\n\nAcross the school, five institutes lead research that covers a spectrum from basic laboratory science to bedside practice. These are the Institute of Psychological Medicine and Clinical Neurosciences, the Institute of Infection & Immunity, the Institute of Primary Care & Public Health, the Institute of Cancer & Genetics, and the Institute of Molecular & Experimental Medicine.\nAlongside these research Institutes, core functions of the school are provided by the Institute of Medical Education and the Institute of Translation, Innovation, Methodology & Engagement (TIME).\n\nResearch facilities have recently been enhanced with the £11m Henry Wellcome Building for Biomedical Research in Wales. The building includes 4500 square metres of laboratories and equipment for research into Infection & Immunity, Cancer Biology and Psychiatric Genetics, adjacent to a purpose-built Clinical Research Facility. The Henry Wellcome Building is the largest development of its kind ever undertaken in Wales.\n\nNotable recent successes include the establishment of a Medical Research Council-funded translational research collaboration with Bristol University (called SARTRE), and the award of an MRC Centre in Neuropsychiatric Genetics and Genomics– the first MRC Centre in Wales and the first aimed specifically at harnessing the genetics revolution for research in mental disorders.\n\nThe school also houses the Institute of Medical Genetics, winner of a 2007 Queen's Anniversary Prize.\n\nCardiff University medical students are able to join both all the Cardiff University clubs and societies, and also clubs and societies run specifically for students studying medicine, and in some cases other healthcare sciences. These clubs and societies are run by Cardiff Medsoc which is the Medsoc within Cardiff University Students' Union.\n\nThere are many distinguished alumni of the Cardiff University School of Medicine. These include;\n\n\nAlumni have also gone onto success in professional sports, such as Wales international rugby union players Jamie Roberts, Hallam Amos, and Gwyn Jones (the latter captained Wales whilst at medical school). \n\nCardiff has two Nobel Laureates on its staff, Sir Martin Evans and Robert Huber. A number of Cardiff University staff have been elected as Fellows of the Royal Society, these include Graham Hutchings, professor of Physical Chemistry and Director of the Cardiff Catalysis Institute, School of Chemistry and Ole Holger Petersen, director of Cardiff School of Biosciences.\n\nIn August 2009, the General Medical Council asked the School of Medicine to carry out a full investigation after serious errors were made in the qualifying Final MB Examination. One student, who was told he/she had failed was found to have passed after an appeal. The appeals process revealed that 4 students had been told they had passed the examination but, in fact, had failed. The 4 had already gone through the graduation process and had been registered as doctors by the General Medical Council. They were subsequently suspended from practice. This was said to be due to a \"clerical error\".\n\nFollowing allegations of research misconduct in 2012, a formal investigation was launched into the laboratory of the dean of medicine, Paul Morgan. The formal investigation panel, after a six-month investigation, cleared the dean and his colleagues of the charges, though four allegations of image manipulation against a former member of staff were upheld. Two retractions were published on 7 November 2013 in the journal \"\"Cancer Research\"\". A retraction of another paper was published in the\" Journal of Immunology\" in 2011. A 2014 retraction, the 4th, has been published in the journal \"Molecular Immunology\".\n\nIn June 2016, a complaint was received by the School of Medicine regarding a student comedy revue, entitled \"Anaphylaxis\". An investigation was carried out by the former President of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, Dinesh Bhugra, and subsequently reported that a number of students had been involved in an impersonation of a lecturer at the school through 'Black face', which was both racist and homophobic in nature. \n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2204538", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2204538", "title": "Arkham Horror", "text": "Arkham Horror\n\nArkham Horror is a cooperative adventure board game designed by Richard Launius, originally published in 1987 by Chaosium. The game is based on Chaosium's roleplaying game \"Call of Cthulhu\", which is set in the Cthulhu mythos of H.P. Lovecraft and other horror writers. The game's second edition was released by Fantasy Flight Games in 2005, with a third edition in 2019.\n\nThe game board is set in Lovecraft's fictional Massachusetts town of Arkham in 1926. Street, building and outdoor locations are featured. Gates to other planes open throughout the town (represented by tokens placed on the board.) Players take on the role of investigators, represented by a character card. Each investigator has several attributes (such as \"sanity\"), and cards representing items, spells, and other things. The investigators travel through the city, avoiding or fighting the monsters that enter through the gates, visiting city locations to acquire tools, and ultimately entering the gates. After traveling to the other world and returning, the investigator can try to close the gate. While exploring city locations or other worlds, the investigators face random events which may benefit or harm them. As gates open, a \"Doom Track\" advances; if the track reaches its end, a powerful horrific creature known as the Ancient One breaks through into Arkham. In the 1987 edition of the game, this ends the game, and all players lose. In the second edition, when the doom track fills, this typically begins a final opportunity for the players to directly defeat the creature and win; otherwise they lose.\n\n\"Arkham Horror\" was originally submitted to Chaosium Inc. by Richard Launius as \"Call of Cthulhu: The Board Game\", a new strategic game based on their \"Call of Cthulhu\" role-playing game. It was edited in-house by Chaosium, who added such features as the Doom Track, a method to track progress toward the total failure of the players, and was published in 1987 as \"Arkham Horror\". The game won the \"Best Fantasy or Science Fiction Boardgame of 1987\" award in the Origins Awards, becoming the first Lovecraft themed board game to achieve significant popularity.\n\n\"Arkham Horror\" was one of several Lovecraft-based board games submitted by Launius, with other designs from the same period including 'The Trail of the Brotherhood', 'DreamQuests', and 'Imprisoned with the Pharaohs'. \"Arkham Horror\" was the only of these games to see professional publication.\n\nThe original printing of \"Arkham Horror\" sold out. Chaosium announced reprints several times, but they never occurred, and Chaosium discontinued production of the game in 1991.\n\nIn 2004 online game company Skotos acquired the rights to \"Arkham Horror\" from Richard Launius, and later arranged publication with Fantasy Flight Games. The game underwent several revisions in this process. Skotos reorganized many of the elements in the game for improved cohesion and arranged for it to more carefully follow the maps of Arkham created by Chaosium and used in their own \"\" online game. Launius added several new elements, including clue tokens and some rearrangements to the decks of cards. Finally, Kevin Wilson at Fantasy Flight massively revamped the game, throwing out a roll-and-move system as well as other concepts and also expanding much of the gameplay. The 2005 edition shares art and other elements with Fantasy Flight Games' other Cthulhu Mythos-based game: \"Call of Cthulhu Collectible Card Game\".\n\nThe new edition was released in July 2005 and sold out, with a second reprinting also being released in 2005.\n\nIn early 2011, Fantasy Flight released \"Elder Sign\", a game based on \"Arkham Horror\" but which provides a much faster paced alternative. By streamlining many of \"Arkham Horror’s\" mechanics and using dice to solve encounters, games of \"Elder Sign\" lasts 90 minutes on average, rather than 2–4 hours.\n\nIn 2016 at Arkham Nights, a celebration of Cthulhu games by Fantasy Flight Games, the original designer Richard Launius returned to host a special event using a modified version of the original game. Multiple games were held over the course of the weekend.\n\nThe 1987 version of \"Arkham Horror\" has the following game components: a board map of the town of Arkham; 99 playing cards with various events; 50 monster counters; two 4-page investigator rules sheets; eight investigator cards; eight pawns; and markers. The cards and tokens are illustrated with black and white drawings and silhouettes. The map of Arkham consists of a set of intertwined routes with a large number of spaces. There are several locations off the routes, such as Miskatonic University or Dark's Carnival, where a player's investigator may have encounters, or where a gate to another world may appear. The other worlds themselves are in a row at the top of the game board. Encounter events in Arkham are determined by rolling a die and consulting a table for that location.\n\nInvestigators usually move a random number of spaces based on the roll of two six-sided dice. The investigator cards are pre-made, with four fixed attributes: Fast Talk, Fight, Knowledge, and Sneak. To successfully use an attribute, the player rolls one six-sided die to get a value equal or below the attribute's value. Paperclips are used to track two numbers that frequently change: Sanity and Strength.\n\nThe turns of the investigators are preceded by the \"Mythos Phase\", where a gate and monsters may appear. Monsters that appear move throughout the town, attacking any investigators they happen upon; seeing some monsters results in a sanity loss. In true Lovecraft fashion, if an investigator in the town loses all Sanity or Strength, they are ignored by the monsters. The collapsed investigator is transported to the Sanitarium or Hospital, as appropriate, for treatment. Such vital losses in the other worlds result in the death of the investigator, and the player must start a new one.\n\nFor each new gate that opens, the Doom Counter increases by one; the \"Doom of Arkham\" occurs if the Doom Counter reaches 14. If this happens, all players lose.\n\nVictory is achieved by closing all of the gates that have opened. Closing a gate requires passing into it to another world, and taking two encounters there; upon return to Arkham, the investigator must attack the gate successfully to close it. Closing a gate reduces the Doom Counter by one.\n\nIn the April 1991 edition of \"Dragon\" (Issue 168), Ken Rolston called the game his \"first choice for a board game with [fantasy role-playing game] feel. It has everything I want in this respect.\" Rolston was saddened that Chaosium had just discontinued production, saying, \"If you see a copy of this gem, buy it. Period.\"\n\nEach player selects an investigator character that is provided with the game. These characters have three pairs of statistics to represent their strengths and weaknesses, and the ability to \"slide\" their current focus on each scale towards either extreme or keep it relatively average. For example, \"Lore\" and \"Luck\" is one pair - if you maximize your character's Lore, you simultaneously minimize his or her Luck. Characters are further defined by a starting inventory and special abilities. Most importantly, each character has the stats of \"Sanity\" and \"Stamina\". These respectively measure the character's mental stability and physical health (i.e. hit points). The back of each card includes a brief history for the character, in case players wish to add an element of roleplaying to the game.\n\nEach player's character is placed on the game board at the location specified on their card. They are given any items specified as well as their starting Sanity and Stamina tokens. At this time, the players should also pick which Ancient One they will be attempting to defeat. This is usually done by randomly drawing the Ancient One's card, but can also be selected intentionally if the players choose to do so.\n\nThe basic resolution mechanic is to roll a number of six-sided dice equal to the statistic, plus any modifiers. Results of a five or a six on a die is considered a success. Most checks only require a single success, with the general exception of Combat rolls when fighting monsters. For instance, a card may require a Lore -1 roll. If the character has a Lore stat of 4, they would roll three dice and if at least one die lands on a five or six the character has passed the roll (and may gain a benefit), otherwise he or she has failed (and may suffer a consequence).\n\nCharacters may also become Blessed, which allows them to succeed on a four or higher; or Cursed, which means they can only succeed on a roll of six. Throughout the game, characters collect Clue tokens; a Clue token can be spent to get a bonus die during a roll (after the original roll fails to produce enough successes). There are Skill cards that can be acquired, increasing a statistic by one as well as granting an extra bonus die when you spend a Clue token on that particular type of roll.\n\nEach turn, the players move their characters on the board and either have Encounters at a location (by drawing cards specific to that board location) or fight monsters. They may also purchase items at some locations, or take advantage of other special features. For example, characters who spend a turn at Arkham Asylum will regain a point to their sanity score, or they may spend $2 in-game to regain their maximum sanity. Either way, it takes the place of their normal Encounter card draw for that turn.\n\nCharacters who encounter monsters have the option to sneak past them or fight them. Fighting a monster first involves a Sanity check, needing only a single success but losing Sanity tokens indicated on the monster if the roll fails. After that check, the character may cast spells or use weapons to affect the combat. If the monster is not immediately destroyed or removed from the board, they then roll Fight plus any bonuses from weapons, items or spells. Some monsters only require a single success, while others may require several to destroy.\n\nAt the end of each turn, the first player draws a card from the Mythos deck. This causes a gate to another world to open, as well as releasing new monsters onto the board, causing existing monsters to move on the board and often adding a new effect to gameplay. If enough monsters appear on the board, they are recycled, and the terror level of Arkham increases, indicating that Arkham is slowly being completely overrun by monsters. If the terror level rises high enough, stores begin to close and potential allies flee, and the Ancient One will awaken even faster once Arkham becomes completely infested. Weather may make it more difficult to move through the streets or a rumor might require investigators to complete an action in a certain number of turns to prevent even worse effects from happening. After the Mythos card is resolved, play passes clockwise to the next player to start a new turn.\n\nCertain events add tokens to the Ancient One's card, representing how close it is to awakening. Typically, when a new gate opens a token goes onto the Ancient One's card. Gates may be closed by investigators through a die roll. Alternately, a gate may be sealed by spending Clue tokens, or with an Elder Sign item. Sealing a gate prevents another gate from opening in that location again, and using an Elder Sign removes a token from the Ancient One.\n\nIf the Ancient One's card reaches a specified number, it awakens and investigators must immediately deal with the threat. Combat against an Ancient One varies, but typically involves making rolls to remove tokens from it, while the Ancient One lowers their stats each turn or takes certain tokens from them. Investigators who lose all of that token type are immediately devoured and removed from the game. If the Ancient One is defeated, the players win; otherwise, the game is over and they have lost.\n\nAn expansion entitled \"Curse of the Dark Pharaoh\" was released in June, 2006, with a revised version released in 2011. This expansion added many new cards to the game, including items and encounters. The theme was that a travelling museum exhibit from Egypt has arrived in Arkham, bringing with it accursed artifacts and strange happenings. Heavy emphasis is placed on Nyarlathotep, one of Lovecraft's iconic Outer Gods.\n\nThe second expansion entitled \"Dunwich Horror\" was released during Gen Con 2006. Based on Lovecraft's short story \"The Dunwich Horror\", it includes a new board that is placed against the original Arkham Horror board. This new board features locations in the town of Dunwich. Investigators may visit Dunwich by travelling through the Train Station in Arkham or using certain vehicle items. In addition, the game includes new Encounter, Mythos and item cards as well as new mechanics, such as the stalking monster movement, and new Great Old Ones. When a character loses their last point of Sanity, they may take a Madness card which imposes restrictions on the character and restores their maximum Sanity, instead of losing half of their items and clues. A similar Injury deck is provided for investigators who reach zero Stamina. Plus, a new monster, the Dunwich Horror itself, is provided as a special monster whose powers vary from combat to combat.\n\nA third expansion, \"The King in Yellow\", was confirmed in October 2006 and released in June 2007. Like \"Curse of the Dark Pharaoh\", it is a card-only expansion, which this time focuses on a mysterious play that is being performed in Arkham. Based on the Robert W. Chambers story \"The King in Yellow\", this expansion introduces the mechanic of the Herald — a special card that permanently alters the game rules. The first Herald is The King in Yellow himself, which causes the Doom track to increase every time the Terror track does unless you take a permanent penalty. Support for The Dark Pharaoh has since been added on the \"Fantasy Flight Games\" website as a Herald for the \"Curse of the Dark Pharaoh\" expansion. A third Herald has also been added on the Fantasy Flight Games website for the \"Dunwich Horror\" expansion.\n\nA fourth expansion, \"Kingsport Horror\", was released in June 2008. It is similar to Dunwich Horror in that it is board-based rather than card-based. This expansion adds the additional locations of Kingsport, a new game element of Dimensional Rifts, and aquatic monsters that may move to any other \"aquatic\" location instead of following normal routes. The expansion also includes new Ancient Ones, new Investigators, new Heralds and introduces Guardians which assist the players much the way Heralds hinder them.\n\nA fifth expansion, \"Black Goat of the Woods\", was released at Gen Con in August 2008. Another cards-only expansion, the set adds another Herald, a new membership similar to the Silver Twilight Lodge, a new element called Corruption, and difficulty cards that allow you to make the game optionally easier or harder. In addition, the expansion includes additional Mythos, Gate, Encounter, Spell, Skill, and Unique and Common item cards to be incorporated into the original game.\n\nA sixth expansion, \"Innsmouth Horror\", was announced on the Fantasy Flight Games Website in February 2009 and released in May 2009. The third board expansion adds the town of Innsmouth as well as 16 new investigators, 8 new Ancient Ones, and two new Heralds. Also included are new personal stories cards for investigators, monsters, and encounter cards.\n\nA seventh expansion, \"The Lurker at the Threshold\" was announced in February 2010. It was released by Fantasy Flight Games in July 2010. This is a small expansion, including a new herald sheet along with over 100 location cards, new Mythos, Gate cards, spells, etc. This expansion includes 18 Gate Markers, designed to replace original ones, and introduces new challenges for investigators trying to seal them. In addition new special Relationship cards were included, which describe how the investigator to your left is related to you and grants some benefit. Also, a new mechanic of making pacts with the Lurker itself were introduced.\n\nAn eighth expansion, \"Miskatonic Horror\" was announced in February 2011 and released in July 2011. The eighth expansion adds nearly 450 new cards, including new Skill, Gate, and Mythos cards. This expansion adds mostly to the other Arkham Horror expansions apart from the main game. Also, new player reference sheets as well as a new Institution variant has been added.\n\nBen Kuchera reviewed the game for \"Ars Technica\", and noted that in a game with 700 tokens \"brevity is not one of its strengths... A short game is still measured in hours, and learning to play the game smoothly takes some time. Even with seasoned players, simply setting everything up can take a while, and once you begin adding expansions, the amount of space you need to enjoy the game is increased.\" He concluded that this may not be a game for new players, or players not used to complicated rules systems, saying, \"it's a big, long, complicated game. It's only fun if you have a regular group of gaming friends who get don't mind learning something that's not immediately intuitive. But if you have the space, the time, and the friends... it's worth the investment.\"\n\nA third edition of \"Arkham horror\" was released by Fantasy Flight Games on November 1, 2018. This version incorporates design elements from \"Eldritch Horror\" and \"\".\n\n"}

Between 1828 and 1899, the canal's barges carried anthracite coal from the mines of Northeastern Pennsylvania to the Hudson River and thence to market in New York City.\n\nConstruction of the canal involved some major feats of civil engineering, and led to the development of some new technologies, particularly in rail transport. Its operation stimulated the city's growth and encouraged settlement in the sparsely populated region. Unlike many other canals of that era, the canal remained a profitable private operation for most of its existence.\n\nFor these reasons, the canal was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1968.\n\nThe canal was abandoned in the early 20th century, and much of it was subsequently drained and filled. A few fragments remain in New York and Pennsylvania, and are in use as parks and historic sites.\n\nIn the early 19th century, Philadelphia businessman William Wurts often would leave his affairs aside for weeks at a time to explore the then-sparsely populated northeastern region of the state. He began noticing, mapping, and researching blackish rock outcroppings, becoming the first explorer of the anthracite fields that have since become known as the Coal Region. He believed they could be a valuable energy source, and brought samples back to Philadelphia for testing.\n\nEventually, he convinced his brothers Charles and Maurice to come along with him and see for themselves. Starting in 1812, they began buying and mining large tracts of inexpensive land. They were able to extract several tons of anthracite at a time, but lost most of what they tried to bring back to Philadelphia due to the treacherous waterways that were the main method of transportation in the interior. While the southern reaches of the Coal Region were already beginning to supply Philadelphia, they realized that the areas they had been exploring and mining were well-positioned to deliver coal to New York City, which had experienced an energy crunch after the War of 1812, when restrictions were placed on the import of British coal. Inspired by the new and successful Erie Canal, they envisioned a canal of their own from Pennsylvania to New York, through the narrow valley between the Shawangunk Ridge and the Catskill Mountains, to the Hudson River near Kingston, a route followed by the Old Mine Road, America's first long-distance transportation route.\nAfter several years of lobbying by the Wurtses, the Delaware and Hudson Canal Company was chartered by separate laws in the state of New York and commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1823, allowing William Wurts and his brother Maurice to construct the Delaware and Hudson Canal. The New York law, passed April 23, 1823, incorporated \"The President, Managers and Company of the Delaware and Hudson Canal Company\", and the Pennsylvania law, passed March 13 of the same year, authorized the company \"To Improve the Navigation of the Lackawaxen River\". The company hired Benjamin Wright, who had engineered the Erie Canal, and his assistant John B. Jervis to survey and plan a route. A primary challenge was the 600-foot (183 m) elevation difference between the Delaware River at Lackawaxen and the Hudson at Rondout. Wright's initial estimated cost of $1.2 million was later revised to $1.6 million (in 1825 dollars).\n\nTo attract investment, the brothers arranged for a demonstration of anthracite at a Wall Street coffeehouse in January 1825. The reaction was enthusiastic, and the stock oversubscribed within hours.\n\nGround was broken on July 13 of that year. After three years of labor by 2,500 men, the canal was opened to navigation in October 1828. It began at Rondout Creek at an area later known as Creeklocks, between Kingston (where the creek fed into the Hudson River) and Rosendale. From there it proceeded southwest alongside Rondout Creek to Ellenville, continuing through the valley of the Sandburg Creek, Homowack Kill, Basha Kill and Neversink River to Port Jervis on the Delaware River. From there the canal ran northwest on the New York side of the Delaware River, crossing into Pennsylvania at Lackawaxen and running on the north bank of the Lackawaxen River to Honesdale.\n\nTo get the anthracite from the Wurts' mine in the Moosic Mountains near Carbondale to the canal at Honesdale, the canal company built the Delaware and Hudson Gravity Railroad. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania authorized its construction on April 8, 1826. On August 8, 1829, the D&H's first locomotive, the \"Stourbridge Lion\", made history as the first locomotive to run on rails in the United States.\n\nBusiness took off as the Wurtses had anticipated, and in 1832 the canal carried 90,000 tons (81,000 tonnes) of coal and three million board-feet (7,080 m³) of lumber. The company invested the profits in improving the canal, making it deeper so larger barges could be used.\n\nIn 1850, the Pennsylvania Coal Company constructed its own gravity railroad from the coal fields to the port at Hawley and the canal enjoyed increased traffic, carrying over 300,000 tons of PCC coal in the first season. However, the relationship between the two companies soured after the canal attempted to raise tolls under the argument that canal improvements had reduced costs for the PCC. The dispute led to the courts and was decided in 1863, but by that time the Erie Railroad constructed its extension to Hawley and the PCC moved its shipments to the railroad.\n\nThe D&H was also developing railroads, a technology that was continuing to improve and supplant canal transportation at the time, to extend its reach into other Northeastern markets. The D&H also extended its gravity railroad from Carbondale deeper into the coal fields and expanded its capacity. By the time Maurice Wurts died in 1854, the company was reporting profits of 10-24% annually and had paid off its original debt to both states.\n\nThe completion of the Erie Railroad through the Delaware Valley in 1848 and its branch to Hawley in 1863 began the end of the canal's days, although it continued to be very successful through the 1870s and '80s. Throughout the rest of the century, canals were perceived as quaint relics of pre-industrial times and began yielding to rail across the country. In 1898, the Delaware and Hudson finally joined them, carrying its last loads from Honesdale to Kingston, as rail could now carry coal more directly to the city, across New Jersey rather than via Kingston. The following year the company dropped the \"Canal\" from its name, the states authorizing it to abandon the canal if it deemed it suitable and concentrate on its rail interests, which it did.\n\nAfter the end of the 1898 season, the company opened all the waste weirs and drained the canal. Catskill rail magnate Samuel Coykendall purchased the canal the next summer, reportedly to benefit the Ramapo Water Company for use as a water supply resource But that never came to pass. Instead, Coykendall used the northernmost section, from Rondout to Kingston, to transport Rosendale cement and other general merchandise to the river until abandoning that business in 1904. The canal was never used again.\n\nAs the 20th century began, the company used some of the canal right-of-way for its expanding rail operations; some of the rest was sold to various private companies, mainly other, smaller railroads. Developing communities along the route also filled it in as necessary to expand their own neighborhoods, or for safety reasons as when a Port Jervis man supposedly drowned in 1900.\n\nIn the early 21st century residents of the town of Deerpark, north of Port Jervis, complained that the canal had been leaking water and causing flooding in the neighborhoods near Cuddebackville in recent years. Orange County, which maintains it in that area, met with town officials and local residents to discuss possible solutions.\n\nThe ruins of the canal and its associated structures remained standing. The Delaware & Hudson Canal Historical Society was formed in 1967; its museum has an extensive education program and hosts hundreds of area students each season. The Neversink Valley Area Museum was formed in Orange County New York in 1968 and the National Park Service recognized the canal site in Orange County as a National Historic Landmark. In 1969, New York's Sullivan County bought a portion to develop as a park. Many other buildings and sites associated with the canal have been added to the National Register of Historic Places and state and local landmark lists.\n\nThe finished canal ran 108 miles (174 km), from Honesdale to Kingston (counting the tidewater portions of the Rondout where the canal joined the creek at Eddyville). Its 108 locks took it over elevation changes totaling 1,075 feet (328 m), more than the Erie Canal's 675 feet (206 m). The channel was four feet (122 cm) deep (eventually increased to six feet (2 m)) by 32 feet (10 m) wide. It was crossed by 137 bridges and had 26 dams, basins and reservoirs. Originally it crossed the four rivers along its course — the Lackawaxen, Delaware, Neversink and Rondout Creek — via slackwater dams. Aqueducts were built over the rivers to replace them by John Roebling in the 1840s, cutting a few days from canal travel time and reducing accidents that were occurring at the Delaware crossing with loggers rafting their harvest downstream.\n\nBarges were pulled by mules along the adjacent towpath, a power source employed even after the development of steam engines, since the bow wave from a faster steamboat would have damaged the channel. Children were often hired to lead the mules at first; in the canal's later years grown men were employed. They had to walk 15–20 miles (24–32 km) a day, pump out the barges and tend the animals. For this they were paid about $3 a month.\n\nThe canal was divided into three sections for operational purposes: the Lackawaxen, from Honesdale to the Delaware; the Delaware, along the river from there to Port Jervis; and then the Neversink, from Port Jervis to Kingston. A trip along its length took, initially, a week. It was closed on Sundays, and would suspend operations each winter when the canal froze up or was likely to.\n\nIts primary business was the transport of coal and lumber from the interior to the river. There was little traffic to Pennsylvania other than empty barges. The company tried offering passenger service at one point, and Washington Irving, a friend of Hone's, made the trip in the 1840s, but it was ultimately given up as unprofitable.\n\nBesides its historical firsts, the canal's most significant impact was to stimulate the growth of New York City along with the other anthracite canals. Fueled by the cheap and plentiful coal barged up the canal and down the river, the city was able to develop and industrialize at the same pace as other Eastern cities. There would be other benefits to the city as well. The company's first president, Philip Hone, served a term as the city's mayor during the canal's construction. Later, John Roebling's experience building the canal served him well in designing the Brooklyn Bridge.\n\nOn the Pennsylvania end, the interior anthracite regions were able to grow and develop from the rough wilderness they had been when William Wurts traveled them and mapped the coal deposits. The viability of its anthracite led to other markets opening up, sustaining the region economically well into the 20th century.\n\nAlong its route, the canal created many small boomtowns at frequent stops. Many towns took their names from canal executives. Honesdale took its name from Philip Hone, the company's first president. The village of Peenpack, New York, renamed itself Port Jervis after the engineer shortly after incorporating in 1853. Further along, the Wurtses are remembered by Wurtsboro, New York. A number of other New York communities with \"port\" in their name (Phillipsport, Port Orange and Port Jackson, now Accord) reflect their origins as canal towns. Summitville in turn takes its name from being the highest easterly point along the canal route.\n\nAs automobiles began to displace the railroads that had once done the same to the canal, its corridor and towpath saw new life as highway routes. US 6 and PA 590 follow part of the route between Honesdale and Hawley, with 590 running along the towpath and now-dry bed as it continues east along the Lackawaxen. The New York section of US 209 links the same communities in that state as the canal did, and intersects or runs closely parallel to its remnants in several areas. Within towns, Canal Street follows the route in Port Jervis, as does Towpath Road in Ellenville and the Town of Wawarsing.\n\nThe canal led to improvements in other technologies as well. The Rosendale cement discovered while excavating the canal bed near that town in 1825 would not only provide the canal itself with a cheap building material but created an industry that sustained the region for some time. Jervis turned his expertise to designing locomotives, and the 4-2-0 type is commonly called the \"Jervis\" in his honor.\n\nFollowing its National Historic Landmark designation, interest grew in preserving what remained of the canal in the late 1960s. The canal, its infrastructure and associated buildings survive in many areas along its length.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is a parody of the song \"I'm Looking Over a Four Leaf Clover\". The UCLA Band arrangement opens with \"There'll Be a Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight\". Following the opening, the band then plays the chorus to \"I'm Looking Over a Four Leaf Clover\". The band and students sing the lyrics, then the band plays the chorus again.\n\nThe song \"I'm Looking Over a Four Leaf Clover\" was popularized in 1948 by Art Mooney. It was written in 1927 with words by Mort Dixon, and music by Harry M. Woods. \"There'll Be a Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight'\" was written in 1886 with original lyrics by Joe Hayden and music by Theodore Metz, band leader of the McIntyre and Heath Minstrels. The UCLA Band arrangement is titled \"Stanford Game (1954)\", implying that it was originally played during the halftime of that football game by the UCLA Band.\n\nThe current song originated in the late 1960s, when a band student wrote the parody lyrics to the tune of \"I'm Looking Over a Four Leaf Clover\" during a football game.

Now, \"Rover\" is played after all UCLA athletic victories immediately following the alma mater. The lyric \"scattered all over the court\" is changed to \"scattered all over the field\" when at a football or soccer match. Also, after the band sings the lyric \"and in his head there's a great big dent\" they jump off their seats or benches simultaneously and continue singing.\n\nThe lyrics to the song are as follows:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2204566", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2204566", "title": "Preemption (computing)", "text": "Preemption (computing)\n\nIn computing, preemption is the act of temporarily interrupting a task being carried out by a computer system, without requiring its cooperation, and with the intention of resuming the task at a later time. Such changes of the executed task are known as context switches. It is normally carried out by a privileged task or part of the system known as a preemptive scheduler, which has the power to preempt, or interrupt, and later resume, other tasks in the system.\n\nIn any given system design, some operations performed by the system may not be preemptible. This usually applies to kernel functions and service interrupts which, if not permitted to run to completion, would tend to produce race conditions resulting in deadlock. Barring the scheduler from preempting tasks while they are processing kernel functions simplifies the kernel design at the expense of system responsiveness. The distinction between user mode and kernel mode, which determines privilege level within the system, may also be used to distinguish whether a task is currently preemptible.\n\nMost modern systems have preemptive kernels, designed to permit tasks to be preempted even when in kernel mode. Examples of such systems are Solaris 2.0/SunOS 5.0, Windows NT, Linux kernel (2.6.x and newer), AIX and some BSD systems (NetBSD, since version 5).\n\nThe term preemptive multitasking is used to distinguish a multitasking operating system, which permits preemption of tasks, from a cooperative multitasking system wherein processes or tasks must be explicitly programmed to yield when they do not need system resources.\n\nIn simple terms: Preemptive multitasking involves the use of an interrupt mechanism which suspends the currently executing process and invokes a scheduler to determine which process should execute next. Therefore, all processes will get some amount of CPU time at any given time.\n\nIn preemptive multitasking, the operating system kernel can also initiate a context switch to satisfy the scheduling policy's priority constraint, thus preempting the active task. In general, preemption means \"prior seizure of\". When the high priority task at that instance seizes the currently running task, it is known as preemptive scheduling.\n\nThe term \"preemptive multitasking\" is sometimes mistakenly used when the intended meaning is more specific, referring instead to the class of scheduling policies known as \"time-shared scheduling\", or \"time-sharing\".\n\nPreemptive multitasking allows the computer system to more reliably guarantee each process a regular \"slice\" of operating time. It also allows the system to rapidly deal with important external events like incoming data, which might require the immediate attention of one or another process.\n\nAt any specific time, processes can be grouped into two categories: those that are waiting for input or output (called \"I/O bound\"), and those that are fully utilizing the CPU (\"CPU bound\"). In early systems, processes would often \"poll\", or \"busywait\" while waiting for requested input (such as disk, keyboard or network input). During this time, the process was not performing useful work, but still maintained complete control of the CPU. With the advent of interrupts and preemptive multitasking, these I/O bound processes could be \"blocked\", or put on hold, pending the arrival of the necessary data, allowing other processes to utilize the CPU. As the arrival of the requested data would generate an interrupt, blocked processes could be guaranteed a timely return to execution.\n\nAlthough multitasking techniques were originally developed to allow multiple users to share a single machine, it soon became apparent that multitasking was useful regardless of the number of users. Many operating systems, from mainframes down to single-user personal computers and no-user control systems (like those in robotic spacecraft), have recognized the usefulness of multitasking support for a variety of reasons. Multitasking makes it possible for a single user to run multiple applications at the same time, or to run \"background\" processes while retaining control of the computer.\n\nThe period of time for which a process is allowed to run in a preemptive multitasking system is generally called the \"time slice\" or \"quantum\". The scheduler is run once every time slice to choose the next process to run. The length of each time slice can be critical to balancing system performance vs process responsiveness - if the time slice is too short then the scheduler will consume too much processing time, but if the time slice is too long, processes will take longer to respond to input.\n\nAn interrupt is scheduled to allow the operating system kernel to switch between processes when their time slices expire, effectively allowing the processor's time to be shared between a number of tasks, giving the illusion that it is dealing with these tasks in parallel (simultaneously). The operating system which controls such a design is called a multi-tasking system.\n\nToday, nearly all operating systems support preemptive multitasking, including the current versions of Windows, macOS, Linux (including Android) and iOS.\n\nSome of the earliest operating systems available to home users featuring preemptive multitasking were Sinclair QDOS (1984) and Amiga OS (1985). These both ran on Motorola 68000-family microprocessors without memory management. Amiga OS used dynamic loading of relocatable code blocks (\"hunks\" in Amiga jargon) to multitask preemptively all processes in the same flat address space.\n\nEarly PC operating systems such as MS-DOS and PC DOS, did not support multitasking at all, however alternative operating systems such as MP/M-86 (1981) and Concurrent CP/M-86 did support preemptive multitasking. Other Unix-like systems including MINIX and Coherent provided preemptive multitasking on 1980s-era personal computers.\n\nLater DOS versions natively supporting preemptive multitasking/multithreading include Concurrent DOS, Multiuser DOS, Novell DOS (later called Caldera OpenDOS and DR-DOS 7.02 and higher). Since Concurrent DOS 386, they could also run multiple DOS programs concurrently in virtual DOS machines.\n\nThe earliest version of Windows to support a limited form of preemptive multitasking was Windows 2.1x, which used the Intel 80386's Virtual 8086 mode to run DOS applications in virtual 8086 machines, commonly known as \"DOS boxes\", which could be preempted. In Windows 95, 98 and Me, 32-bit applications were made preemptive by running each one in a separate address space, but 16-bit applications remained cooperative for backward compatibility. In Windows 3.1x (protected mode), the kernel and virtual device drivers ran preemptively, but all 16-bit applications were non-preemptive and shared the same address space.\n\nPreemptive multitasking has always been supported by Windows NT (all versions), OS/2 (native applications), Unix and Unix-like systems (such as Linux, BSD and macOS), VMS, OS/360, and many other operating systems designed for use in the academic and medium-to-large business markets.\n\nAlthough there were plans to upgrade the cooperative multitasking found in the classic Mac OS to a preemptive model (and a preemptive API did exist in Mac OS 9, although in a limited sense), these were abandoned in favor of Mac OS X (now called macOS) that, as a hybrid of the old Mac System style and NeXTSTEP, is an operating system based on the Mach kernel and derived in part from BSD, which had always provided Unix-like preemptive multitasking.\n\n"}

He is a flanker for Bristol Bears, though he is more known for his 12 years (2000–10,13) at the ACT Brumbies in Super Rugby, earning 142 caps.\n\nHe made his test debut in 2000 against France in Paris and earning 111 caps for Australia, 110 before retiring from international rugby on 5 February 2010 and one final cap against the British and Irish Lions on 6 July 2013. He is the second most capped Wallaby forward behind Nathan Sharpe, and is the second most capped flanker in rugby union behind Richie McCaw. He holds the world record as the youngest player to have played 100 test matches at 29 years and 4 days.\n\nSmith was born in Manly, Sydney. He began playing rugby with the Manly Roos/Warringah Roos, before moving on to play the majority of his junior career with the Manly Vikings, and Tupou College in Tonga, playing a year above his age group in the Sydney junior rugby competition. Once that team had reached its age limit (18 years old) and moved on to the colts competition, Smith remained in the Sydney junior rugby competition, this time lining up in his correct age group for the Seaforth-Balgowlah Raiders.\nHe then progressed to playing in the Manly 1st grade Colts side who also won a premiership in 1999. It was during that season that Smith made his first grade debut at Nepean Rugby Park against The Penrith Emus. During his junior career he was selected for many representative teams, including Manly, Sydney, Northern Zone, NSW, and Australian Under 16s.\nSmith also had a successful school career, first at Balgowlah Boys High School, then at Cromer High School, where, along with Tongan international John Payne, he won the Australian Schools Championship. He played for the Australian Schoolboys team in 1998.\n\nHe was signed to the ACT Brumbies by Eddie Jones in 1999. He made his Super 12 debut in just his first year of professional rugby in 2000, playing against the Sharks, and he scored a try in the Brumbies Super 12 final loss to the Canterbury Crusaders. In a remarkable year, Smith was also capped for the first time in the Wallabies end of season tour against France.\n\nSmith was a key player for the Wallabies from 2000–09.\nHe was often voted Players' Player of the Year, awarded for fair-play by his teammates and officials. He has recently been chosen as a member of the Wallaby Team of the Decade, a remarkable feat considering his age and one of only three current players picked. In 2002, he was the first recipient of the John Eales Medal, awarded by the Australian Rugby Union and the Rugby Union Players' Association to their Player of the Year.\n\nHe won Australian Super 14 Player of the Year four years in a row between 2006 and 2009.\n\nIn 2007 the breakdown specialist capped off another remarkable season claiming awards including: the Brett Robinson Award as the Brumbies' Players' Player for the fifth consecutive year; Super 14 Player of the Year; and the Rugby Union Players' Association 'Rugby Medal for Excellence'. These recognitions underlined his position as one of rugby's most respected players, reinforced further when he became the Wallabies 75th captain, against Canada at the 2007 Rugby World Cup.\n\n2008 was a big year for Smith. He captained the Brumbies and the Wallabies and became the first player to win the \"John Eales Medal\", twice. In addition, Smith won the \"Super 14 Player of the Year Award\", for the third consecutive year and the Brett Robinson Award as the Brumbies' Players' Player of the year for the sixth consecutive year.\n\nHe also reached a personal milestone during the season, when he made his 100th Super Rugby appearance against the Cheetahs in round six. In a memorable double for the Smith family, George's younger brother, Brumbies teammate Tyrone, was named rookie of the year. In the international arena, the older Smith also became both the most capped flanker and the most capped forward – the latter being previously held by John Eales.\n\nOn 5 February 2010, Smith announced his retirement from international rugby. 2010 was expected to be his last in Super Rugby. Smith celebrated with the achievement of his 9th Brumbies Players' Player of the Year, with eight of those awards being consecutive.\n\nIn June 2010, Smith signed a one-year contract with French Top 14 club Toulon. His RC Toulonnais teammates included former Highlander and All Black prop Carl Hayman, and former Brumbies' scrum-half Matt Henjak. Later in 2010 he was selected in the French Barbarians to play at blindside flanker (number 6) against Tonga.\n\nSmith played for the Australia XV team alongside fellow Tongan, Lisiate Tafa, in the Southern Hemisphere Charity Fundraiser in March 2011 against the Pacific Barbarians. In the following month Smith become the highest paid Australian rugby player by signing with Japanese club, Suntory Sungoliath, on a $3.3 million three-year deal.\n\nHe joined Stade Français in 2012 on a short-term contract for the end of their Top 14 and European Challenge Cup seasons.\n\nIn early 2013 the Brumbies announced tha Smith would return to Australia on a short term contract for the 2013 Super Rugby season. This followed Ita Vaea's season-ending injury. Smith gained the approval of his Japanese club Sungoliath for his 12-week stint back in Australia.\n\nSmith was recalled to the Australian squad in June that year for the series against the British and Irish Lions, after recovering from a knee injury. After being overlooked for the second test, Smith was named as the starting open side flanker for the third and deciding test in Sydney. It was his first test since retiring from international rugby in February 2010 and broke Colin Meads' record of 4382 days between his first test against the Lions, and his last.\n\nAfter leaving French club Lyon on their relegation to the Pro D2, Smith made a move to England to sign for Wasps in the Aviva Premiership from the 2015–16 season. During his season with Wasps, Smith won a number of awards; including Wasps' Players' Player of the Year, Wasps' Player of the Year, Aviva Premiership Players' Player of the Year and Green Flag Forward of the Season. During his spell in England, Smith was also involved in the England coaching setup during the 2016 Six Nations Championship\n\nIn mid 2016 it was confirmed that Smith would leave Wasps in England to return to Japanese club Suntory Sungoliath, and that he would also play for the Queensland Reds in the 2017 and 2018 Super Rugby seasons.\n\nOn 13 July 2018, Smith played his final home game for Queensland Reds, having initially been ruled out with a knee injury. This was his final professional game in Australia.\n\nSmith joined the Bristol Bears in England for their 2018–19 Premiership Rugby season. He retired from professional rugby at the end of that season.\n\nSmith, who is of Tongan background, is the older brother of fellow Brumbies player and Tongan rugby league international Tyrone Smith.\n\nHe was easily recognised on the field by his dreadlocked hair style until late 2006 – when he decided to sell his dreadlocks for charity. They were given to a charity for younger people with cancer.\n\nSmith was the face of the Australian version of Electronic Arts' video game \"Rugby 2005\".\n\nHe was made a Member of the Order of Australia in 2012.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2204613", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2204613", "title": "Battle of Mount Gaurus", "text": "Battle of Mount Gaurus\n\nThe Battle of Mount Gaurus, 343 BC, was the first battle of the First Samnite War and also the first battle fought between the Roman Republic and the Samnites. The battle is described by the Roman historian Livy (59 BC – AD 17) as part of of his history of Rome, Ab Urbe Condita where he narrates how the Roman consul Marcus Valerius Corvus won a hard-fought battle against the Samnites at Mount Gaurus, near Cumae, in Campania. Modern historians however believe that most, if not all, of the detail in Livy's description has been invented by him or his sources.\n\nAccording to Livy the First Samnite War started because the Samnites attacked the Sidicini, a tribe living north of Campania. The Campani, led by the city-state of Capua, sent an army to help the Sidicini, but were beaten in battle by the Samnites. The Samnites then invaded Campania and won a second battle on the plain near Capua. Facing defeat, the Campani appealed to Rome for aid. The Romans, despite having a treaty with the Samnites, agreed to help and declared war against the Samnites.\n\nThe two Roman consuls for 343, Marcus Valerius Corvus and Aulus Cornelius Cossus, marched each their armies against the Samnites. Valerius led his into Campania and Cornelius his into Samnium.\n\nValerius camped his army at Mount Gaurus. The Samnites had moved into Campania in force, believing this would be the main theatre of war, and were eager to fight. After testing his enemy's strength for a few days with skirmishers, Valerius prepared the Roman army for battle. The Romans marched out of camp and a battle ensued. The battle went on for some time, with the two sides evenly matched neither could gain the upper hand. Valerius therefore ordered a cavalry charge in an attempt to break the Samnite lines. The charge failed and the Roman cavalry had to pull back. With the Roman cavalry retreated, a dismounted Valerius decided to lead an infantry assault in person, but once again the Samnite lines did not break despite taking dreadful losses. The battle had now lasted a long time and daylight was fading. The Romans, weary but fuelled by rage and disappointment, made one last mad attack. At last the Samnites fled, and not many would have survived if nightfall had not put an end to the pursuit. When asked why in the end they had fled, the Samnites answered it was \"\"the eyes of the Romans, which seemed to them to blaze, along with their furious expression and frenzied glare\"\". During the night the Samnites departed and left the Romans to take possession of their camp on the next day. All the Campani came out to congratulate the Romans with their victory.\n\nLivy records two more Roman victories against the Samnites in 343, a victory by the other consul, Cornelius Cossus, at the Battle of Saticula, and a second victory by Valerius Corvus at the Battle of Suessula. At the end of the campaign season both consuls were rewarded at Rome with a triumph. The Carthaginians, with whom the Romans had concluded a treaty of friendship in 348, congratulated Rome for her victories by sending a golden crown weighing twenty-five pounds for the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus. According to the \"Fasti Triumphales\", Valerius and Cornelius celebrated their triumphs over the Samnites on 21 September and 22 September respectively. For the two next years little fighting is recorded and the First Samnite War ended in 341 with Rome and the Samnites renewing their treaty and the Samnites accepting the Roman alliance with the Campani.\n\nModern historians believe little, if any, of the detail provided by Livy for this battle derive from authentic records. Livy's battle-scenes for this time period are mostly free reconstructions by him and his sources, and as the historic first battle between Romans and Samnites the Battle of Mount Gaurus would be particularly susceptible to such inventions. Samnite losses have clearly been exaggerated. The role of Valerius Corvus in the events of the First Samnite War might have been exaggerated as well, especially, if as Salmon(1967) held, Valerius Antias was Livy's chief source for this part of his work, but other historians than Antias were capable of exaggerating the Valerii as well. Salmon(1967) suspected Valerius' victories in 343 could be doublets of Roman operations against Hannibal in the same area in 215, he also doubted the location of the battle at Mount Gaurus, close to Cumae, but far from Capua. Since the testimony of the \"Fasti Triumphales\" require some degree of Roman success in 343 and arguing that in this time period the Romans were more likely to defeat the Samnites on level than mountainous ground, Salmon(1967) therefore proposed that there was only one battle in 343 which was fought on the outskirts of Capua near the shrine of Juno Gaura, which Livy or his source has then confused with Mount Gaurus. This would explain Livy's description of the Capuans coming out to congratulate the Romans. The battle might not have been such a total rout of the Samnites as Livy describes. Fighting interrupted by nightfall was often used by Roman historians to hide Roman failures. This reconstruction is rejected by Oakley(1998) who does not believe there are any doublets in Livy's account for 343. The Samnites would have gained significant ground in Campania by the time the Romans arrived and Valerius' two victories could be the outcome of twin Samnite attacks on Capua and Cumae.\n\n\n\n"}

He then worked in Paris as a sound engineer at studio +XXX (\"plus thirty\") where he met Philippe Zdar of Cassius, with whom he worked as Motorbass for the album \"Pansoul\", a preview of what would be his first solo album, \"Super Discount\", released in 1996, with Air, Alex Gopher and other French artists on Solid. Étienne de Crécy has been involved in various music projects where he worked as a producer.\n\n\"Super Discount\" was Étienne de Crécy's first release, including the well known singles \"Tout doit disparaître\" (Everything must go) and \"Prix Choc\" (Shock Price). \"Super Discount\" is considered by many as the first album of what is called the French touch. \"Super Discount\" received very favourable reviews and sold over 200,000 copies.\n\nFour years after \"Super Discount\", Étienne de Crécy released \"Tempovision\". Unlike \"Super Discount\", which was perfectly adapted for the radio, \"Tempovision\" is a mature album, a deep reflection on the electronic music of this time. In Étienne de Crécy's opinion it was a blues album, differing from some of his earlier and more recent work.\n\nThe \"Tempovision\" track \"Am I Wrong\" used a sample of Millie Jackson's voice singing \"Am I wrong to hunger...\", from the song \"(If Loving You Is Wrong) I Don't Want to Be Right\". \"Am I Wrong\" peaked at No. 44 in the UK Singles Chart in January 2001.\n\nThe three 3D animated videos to accompany singles from the \"Tempovision\" album were directed by Étienne's brother, Geoffroy de Crécy.\n\nEight years after the first \"Super Discount\" album, came \"Super Discount 2\" with the original team, and the addition of Cassius. For this album, he used only old analog instruments, for example a TB303, and produced twelve electro-house-pop-new wave songs designed for clubs, in the continuity of the first \"Super Discount\". Pursuing the 'discount' concept of the first album, all the tracks are named after peer-to-peer clients: \"Overnet\", \"Napster\", and so on. Étienne de Crécy, talking about the concept for the third album, said: “you have to be autistic in working in the music industry not to realize that something happens through the MP3 exchanges. It’s not discount anymore! It’s free!” and added “what the music industry doesn’t understand, is that young people will not build their own music culture if they don’t have free access to the music.” \n\nÉtienne de Crécy's more recent tracks have focused more on an electronic sound. They have also begun to be released on the Pixadelic label.\n\nThe discography of Étienne de Crécy consists of four studio albums, one live album, three compilation albums, eighteen extended plays and fifteen singles.\n\n\n\n\n"}

During the late 1980s, as the papers were being organized and catalogued, the staff of the project discovered that King's doctoral dissertation at Boston University, titled \"A Comparison of the Conception of God in the Thinking of Paul Tillich and Henry Nelson Wieman\", included large sections from a dissertation written by another student (Jack Boozer) three years earlier at Boston University.\n\nAs Clayborne Carson, director of the King Papers Project at Stanford University, has written, \"instances of textual appropriation can be seen in his earliest extant writings as well as his dissertation. The pattern is also noticeable in his speeches and sermons throughout his career.\"\n\nBoston University, where King received his Ph.D. in systematic theology, conducted an investigation that found he appropriated and plagiarized major portions of his doctoral thesis from various other authors who wrote about the topic.\n\nAccording to civil rights historian Ralph Luker, who worked on the King Papers Project directing the research on King's early life, King's paper \"The Chief Characteristics and Doctrines of Mahayana Buddhism\"\nwas taken almost entirely from secondary sources.\nHe writes:\n\nThe incident was first reported in the December 3, 1989, edition of the \"Sunday Telegraph\" by Frank Johnson, titled \"Martin Luther KingWas He a Plagiarist?\" The incident was then reported in U.S. in the November 9, 1990, edition of the \"Wall Street Journal\", under the title of \"To Their Dismay, King Scholars Find a Troubling Pattern\". Several other newspapers then followed with stories, including the \"Boston Globe\" and the \"New York Times\". Although Carson believed King had acted unintentionally, he also stated that King had been sufficiently well acquainted with academic principles and procedures to have understood the need for extensive footnotes, and he was at a loss to explain why King had not used them.\n\nBoston University decided not to revoke his doctorate, saying that although King acted improperly, his dissertation still \"makes an intelligent contribution to scholarship.\" The committee also dismissed allegations that King plagiarized writings which he used to develop his organization and chapter headings. However, a letter is now attached to King's dissertation in the university library, noting that numerous passages were included without the appropriate quotations and citations of sources.\n\nRalph Luker questioned whether King's professors at the Crozer Theological Seminary held him to lower standards because he was an African-American, citing as evidence the fact that King received lower marks (a C+ average) at the historically black Morehouse College than at Crozer, where he was a minority being graded mostly by white teachers and received an A− average.\nBoston University has denied that King received any special treatment.\n\nThe Martin Luther King Jr. Papers Project addresses authorship issues on pp. 25–26 of Volume II of The Papers of Martin Luther King Jr., entitled \"Rediscovering Precious Values, July 1951 – November 1955\", Clayborne Carson, Senior Editor. Following is an excerpt from these pages:\n\nThe readers of King's dissertation, L. Harold DeWolf and S. Paul Schilling, a professor of systematic theology who had recently arrived at Boston University, failed to notice King's problematic use of sources. After reading a draft of the dissertation, DeWolf criticized him for failing to make explicit \"presuppositions and norms employed in the critical evaluation,\" but his comments were largely positive. He commended King for his handling of a \"difficult\" topic \"with broad learning, impressive ability and convincing mastery of the works immediately involved.\" Schilling found two problems with King's citation practices while reading the draft, but dismissed these as anomalous and praised the dissertation in his Second Reader's report...\n\nAs was true of King's other academic papers, the plagiaries in his dissertation escaped detection in his lifetime. His professors at Boston University, like those at Crozer, saw King as an earnest and even gifted student who presented consistent, though evolving, theological identity in his essays, exams and classroom comments... Although the extent of King's plagiaries suggest he knew that he was at least skirting academic norms, the extant documents offer no direct evidence in this matter. Thus he may have simply become convinced, on the basis of his grades at Crozer and Boston, that his papers were sufficiently competent to withstand critical scrutiny. Moreover, King's actions during his early adulthood indicate that he increasingly saw himself as a preacher appropriating theological scholarship rather than as an academic producing such scholarship.\n\nOn page 340, it was stated that: \n\nKing's faulty citation practices were rooted in the notecards he created while conducted research on Tillich and Wieman. Large sections of the expository chapters are verbatim transcriptions of these notecards in which errors he had made while creating his notes are perpetuated. In one case, although King had properly quoted Tillich on the notecard, he used a section of the quotation in his dissertation without quotation marks. Some of the notecards were adequately paraphrased from Tillich and Weiman, but many others were nearly identical to the source. King rarely noted down proper citations as he took notes.\n\nKing delivered his \"I Have a Dream\" speech at the 1963 Washington D.C. Civil Rights March. Approaching the end of his prepared speech, King departed from his prepared text\nfor a partly improvised peroration on the theme of \"I have a dream\", possibly prompted by Mahalia Jackson's repeated cry, \"Tell them about the dream, Martin!\"\n\nIn September 1962, SNCC activist Prathia Hall had spoken at a service commemorating Mount Olive Baptist Church in Terrell County, Georgia, which had been burned to the ground by the Ku Klux Klan. The service was attended by King and SCLCs strategist James Bevel. As Hall prayed, according to Bevel, \"she spontaneously uttered and rhythmically repeated an inspiring phrase that captured her vision for the future-'I have a dream'\". Bevel claimed that her use of this memorable phrase is what inspired King to begin to use it as a fixture in his sermons.\n\nThis closing section also partially resembles Archibald Carey Jr.'s address to the 1952 Republican National Convention. The similarity is that both speeches end with a recitation of the first verse of Samuel Francis Smith's popular patriotic hymn \"America\" (\"My Country, 'Tis of Thee\"), and the speeches refer to famous, iconic American mountain ranges, but only Stone Mountain of Georgia specifically appears in both speeches.\n\nKing and Carey had corresponded in the years between the two speeches.\nAs early as 1956, King had given addresses elaborating on the lines from the song,\nand according to Clayborne Carson, by 1957 this theme had become part of King's oratorical repertoire.\n\nKeith Miller, in \"Voice of Deliverance: The Language of Martin Luther King Jr. and Its Sources\" and elsewhere,\nargues that \"voice merging\", using the words of scripture, sacred text, and prior preachers follows in a long tradition of preaching, particularly in the African-American church, and should not be termed plagiarism. On the contrary, he views King's skillful combination of language from different sources as a major oratorical skill.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2204630", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2204630", "title": "Lemon of Troy", "text": "Lemon of Troy\n\n\"Lemon of Troy\" is the 24th episode of \"The Simpsons\" sixth season. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 14, 1995. In the episode, the children of Springfield try to retrieve their beloved lemon tree after it is stolen by the children of Shelbyville.\n\nThe episode was written by Brent Forrester and directed by Jim Reardon. For this episode, the animators designed a non-polluted version of Springfield. It features cultural references to the 1984 song \"When Doves Cry\", the 1981 film \"Mad Max 2\", and the 1968 song \"What a Wonderful World\". The episode's title is a play on the name \"Helen of Troy\" from Greek mythology. The episode acquired a Nielsen rating of 8.1. The episode has garnered universal acclaim and is regarded as a classic episode of the show.\n\nMarge lectures Bart on the importance of town pride after he writes his name in wet cement. Soon he realizes the joys of living in Springfield and is upset by anti-Springfield taunts coming from neighboring Shelbyville. Grampa explains this rivalry can be traced to the establishment of the two towns: Jebediah Springfield wanted a town which promoted chastity and abstinence, but Shelbyville Manhattan was a proponent of cousin marriage.\n\nThe next day, Springfield's lemon tree is stolen by a gang of boys from Shelbyville. Bart leads Milhouse, Nelson, Martin, Todd and Database to Shelbyville to find the tree and return it to Springfield. Bart's posse locates the tree in an impound lot where the leader of the gang that stole the tree lives.\nUsing Ned Flanders' RV, Homer leads the boys' fathers to their sons in Shelbyville. The fathers and sons demand their tree be returned, but the owner of the impound lot taunts them and refuses to surrender it.\n\nUsing a Trojan Horse strategy, Bart parks the RV outside a hospital, where it is impounded to the lot. When night falls, the Springfield men and boys emerge from the RV and tie the lemon tree to its top. The lot owner catches them but they manage to escape and return the tree to Springfield.\n\nIn the aftermath, the town elders of Springfield and Shelbyville provide their own endings to the tale. In Springfield, Grandpa lauds the triumphant return of the tree by the \"heroes of Springfield\"; Bart and Milhouse celebrate with a glass of lemonade made from a few drops of lemon juice (and a large amount of sugar). In Shelbyville, an old man contrives a story about the tree being haunted to hide the embarrassment of losing it to their Springfield rivals. The Shelbyville kids drink turnip juice instead, much to their disgust.\n\nBrent Forrester wrote \"Lemon of Troy\", his second episode of \"The Simpsons\". Jim Reardon directed it. Early on in the production stage, the writers decided that the leader of the Shelbyville children, Shelby, and his father should be modeled after Bart and Homer. Shelby's voice was provided by Tress MacNeille, and Shelby's father was voiced by Hank Azaria, who based his performance on Walter Matthau as Dan Castellaneta originally based his performance of Homer on Matthau.\n\nThe writers wanted to have the Springfield children find an area of Springfield that was not decimated, and the animators designed a version of Springfield that was very idyllic. They drew several scenes of the children running through non-polluted streams and woodlands. The animators gave Shelbyville's nature a more dark feeling in comparison to Springfield.\n\nIn the episode, Milhouse recites a slightly paraphrased line from Prince's 1984 song \"When Doves Cry\". In a scene referencing \"The Lady, or the Tiger?\" Bart identifies the number seven in Roman numerals by referring to a nonexistent sequel of the Rocky film series, \"Rocky VII: Adrian's Revenge\". The scene with Bart and his team sitting on a hill above the enemy camp and looking down at the captured tree being circled by children on bicycles bears a resemblance to an early scene in \"Mad Max 2\".\nThe overall plot structure of Springfield residents attacking their neighboring rivals after they steal their prize possession is a reference to the legend of the Trojan War, in which the incentive for the Greeks declaring war on their Trojan neighbors is the abduction of their most famous and beautiful female citizen, Helen. The title of the episode is a play on her name. The method of recovery of the tree is an echo of the Trojan Horse. Homer complains that \"Nobody cared when Bogart defaced that sidewalk in Hollywood\", referring to when Humphrey Bogart was honoured in a ceremony at Grauman's Chinese Theater to record his hand and footprints in cement in 1946.\n\nIn its original broadcast, \"Lemon of Troy\" finished 55th in the ratings for the week of May 11 to May 17, 1995, with a Nielsen rating of 8.1. The episode was the sixth highest rated show on the Fox network that week.\n\nSince airing, it has received many positive reviews from fans and television critics. Matt Groening, creator of \"The Simpsons\", called the episode a \"classic\" and said it is one of his favorites from the show. Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, the authors of the book \"I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide\", said there was \"some nice ideas in this episode—Bart and his chums all have near-doubles in Shelbyville—but this is a strangely pedestrian outing, and seems hidden away—wisely—at this point in the season.\" In a DVD review of the sixth season, DVD Verdict's Ryan Keefer said the episode \"easily [is] one of the best of the season\" and that it has \"gotten more enjoyable since it first aired\". He added that the episode is \"full of everything that makes the show successful\" and gave it an A rating. Entertainment.ie named it among the 10 greatest \"Simpsons\" episodes of all time. Nashville Scene named it the \"perfect episode.\"\n\n"}

He was then taken to Abu Ghraib prison before eventually ending up in Camp Cropper, where he spent the remainder of his incarceration in solitary confinement. According to the ACLU, he had been permitted three phone calls and a visit from the ICRC.\n\nOn July 6, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a petition for habeas corpus on Kar's behalf. On July 10, he was released from military custody.\n\nOn an August 24, 2005 segment on the Nightline television show Kar described painful and humiliating abuse from US personnel, while in custody in Iraq.\n\nOn July 7, 2006 Kar sued Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and other military officials, calling the government's detention policies unconstitutional.\nHe also claimed that he was hooded, threatened, taunted and insulted by US soldiers. The lawsuit said his detention violated his Civil rights, Geneva conventions as well as International law. \"Human rights monitors note that the vast majority of the over 15,000 detainees in U.S. military custody in Iraq have never been charged, tried, provided counsel, or allowed to challenge their detention in court, and over one-fifth of them have been detained for over a year in this manner,\" the suit states. \"Mr. Kar was imprisoned by the United States military in Iraq without the slightest hint of legal authority,\" said Mark Rosenbaum, a spokesman for the American Civil Liberties Union, which is filing the lawsuit on his behalf. \"Saddam Hussein has had more due process than Cyrus Kar; this is a detention policy that was drafted by Kafka.\" The lawsuit was voluntarily dismissed in July, 2008 after the US Army Field Manual FM 3-24 adopted Common Article 3 of the Geneva Convention governing U.S. detention operations.\n\n"}

{"id": "2204714", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2204714", "title": "Australian Stock Horse", "text": "Australian Stock Horse\n\nThe Australian Stock Horse (or Stockhorse), has been especially bred for Australian conditions. It is a hardy breed of horse noted for endurance, agility, and good temperament. Its ancestry dates to the arrival of the first horses in Australia, brought from Europe, Africa, and Asia. It is used today in a wide variety of disciplines, and is still valued as a working horse by stockmen and stockwomen throughout Australia.\n\nThe roots of the Australian Stock Horse date back to the earliest importation of nine horses to Australia, with the arrival of the First Fleet in Botany Bay in January, 1788. Some of the original horse breeds in these early imports included the Thoroughbred, Cape of Good Hope Horse (largely descended from the Barb and Spanish horse), Arabian, Timor Pony, and Welsh Mountain pony.\n\nHorses in Australia were bred for their stamina and strength, with weaker animals culled and only the strongest allowed to breed. In the 1830s, additional Thoroughbreds were imported into Australia to improve the local strains, and the mid-20th century had infusions from the American Quarter Horse.\n\nThe Australian Stock Horse and the Waler horse come from similar roots, though today they are separate breeds. The \"station horse\" that was an ancestor of both breeds was used by the Australian Army in the First World War and was renowned for its toughness and endurance.\n\nHowever, the modern Australian Stock Horse differs from the Waler Horse in that it is not as big. The horses shipped abroad to fight in war and kept at home to be bred on as Walers were the larger animals, as they were required to carry a rider with the considerable extra weight of weapons and a full pack. Some of the heaviest animals were also required pull water carts and carriages. However, the characteristics of toughness and endurance remain with the Australian Stock Horse of today.\n\nFormal recognition of Australian Stock Horses as a distinct breed began in June 1971, when over 100 campdrafters and horse breeders met in Tamworth, New South Wales, to form the Australian Stock Horse Society. Many of these people bred stock horses using bloodlines tracing back to native stock, along with some Arabians, Thoroughbreds, and a few ponies of outstanding merit. Most of the early ASH registrations were of horses bred with bloodlines that excelled at both campdrafting and cattle work in the rugged Great Dividing Range.\n\nInitially, horses were inspected for registration by three classifiers, who assessed them for conformation, breeding, and athletic ability. The best were accepted for inclusion in the Stud Book, some were approved for the registry appendix, and those not meeting the criteria for registration were rejected.\n\nFourteen specific foundation sires are responsible for most of the bloodlines accepted into the Society Australia-wide, and most well-bred Australian Stock Horses trace to one of these foundation sires. These included horses bred from colonial stock: Saladin, Cecil and his son Radium, Medlow, and Bobbie Bruce. The others were Thoroughbreds; Rivoli, Commandant, Panzer, Midstream, Young Valais, Gibbergunyah, Bushfire, Silvius, and Deo Juvante also exerted considerable influence. Since then Rivoli Ray, Blue Moon Mystic, Eliotts Creek Cadet, Warrenbri Romeo, and some American Quarter Horses have also had a large influence on the breed.\n\nThe use of Quarter Horse bloodlines is somewhat controversial, with some breeders preferring to stay with older lines. Those who wish to bring in outside blood are required to pay very high fees to the society, thus providing an incentive for breeders to only bring in worthwhile horses.\n\nThe Australian Stock Horse is bred for intelligence, courage, toughness, and stamina. The horse will be sound, agile and quick moving with a sure-footed walk. It will have a calm, responsive temperament. All colours are acceptable. Height ranges from .\n\nThe ideal Australian Stock Horse is well proportioned in all respects according to its size. Desired traits include a finely cut, expressive head with large eyes and a broad forehead. The neck is long and arched, with the head well set on. The withers should be well defined. Overall conformation is well-muscled, but not bulky, with correct conformation that includes a deep chest, well-sprung ribs, a strong and broad back, and powerful hindquarters. The hooves are hard and well-conformed.\n\nAround 190,000 Australian Stock Horses are registered or foals recorded with the Australian Stock Horse Society. The Stock Horse is used in many competitive disciplines, including polo, polocrosse, dressage, campdrafting, show jumping, eventing, and endurance riding. It is also used for stockman challenges, Pony Club activities, general hacking, and stock work on cattle stations.\n\nWhile horses are now often being replaced in the flatter Outback and Top End by motorcycles and helicopters, they are still necessary today for mustering (roundups) in rugged mountain terrain.\n\nA tribute to the Australian Stock Horse was held during the 2000 Sydney Olympics Opening Ceremony when an Australian Stock Horse reared and then another 120 Stock Horses were ridden into the stadium and performed intricate manoeuvres to the music of the specially written Olympics version of the main theme of the film \"The Man from Snowy River\" by Australian composer Bruce Rowland. The Australian Stock Horse Crown Law has represented Australia in World Championship and Olympic dressage competition.\n\n, the Australian Outback Spectacular used 42 Australian Stock Horses in its show on the Gold Coast, Queensland, 31 of which were used in a show on a rotational basis.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2204744", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2204744", "title": "Michelle Obama", "text": "Michelle Obama\n\nMichelle LaVaughn Robinson Obama (\"née\" Robinson; born January 17, 1964) is an American lawyer and author who was the first lady of the United States from 2009 to 2017. She is married to the 44th President of the United States Barack Obama. She is the first African-American First Lady of the United States.\n\nRaised on the South Side of Chicago, Illinois, Obama is a graduate of Princeton University and Harvard Law School. In her early legal career, she worked at the law firm Sidley Austin where she met Barack Obama. She subsequently worked in non-profits and as the associate dean of Student Services at the University of Chicago as well as the vice president for Community and External Affairs of the University of Chicago Medical Center. Michelle married Barack in 1992, and they have two daughters.\n\nObama campaigned for her husband's presidential bid throughout 2007 and 2008, delivering a keynote address at the 2008 Democratic National Convention. She returned to speak for him at the 2012 Democratic National Convention. During the 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, she delivered a speech in support of the Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, a former first lady.\n\nAs first lady, Obama served as a role model for women and worked as an advocate for poverty awareness, education, nutrition, physical activity, and healthy eating. She supported American designers and was considered a fashion icon.\n\nMichelle LaVaughn Robinson was born on January 17, 1964, in Chicago, Illinois, to Fraser Robinson III (1935–1991), a city water plant employee and Democratic precinct captain, and Marian Shields Robinson (b. July 30, 1937), a secretary at Spiegel's catalog store. Her mother was a full-time homemaker until Michelle entered high school.\n\nThe Robinson and Shields families trace their roots to pre-Civil War African Americans in the American South. On her father's side, she is descended from the Gullah people of South Carolina's Low Country region. Her paternal great-great grandfather, Jim Robinson, was born into slavery in 1850 on Friendfield Plantation, near Georgetown, South Carolina. He became a freedman at age 15 after the war. Some of Obama's paternal family still reside in the Georgetown area. Her grandfather Fraser Robinson, Jr. built his own house in South Carolina. He and his wife LaVaughn (née Johnson) returned to the Low Country from Chicago after retirement.\n\nAmong her maternal ancestors was her great-great-great-grandmother, Melvinia Shields, born into slavery in South Carolina but sold to Henry Walls Shields, who had a 200-acre farm in Clayton County, Georgia near Atlanta. Melvinia's first son, Dolphus T. Shields, was biracial and born into slavery around 1860. Based on DNA and other evidence, in 2012 researchers said his father was likely 20-year-old Charles Marion Shields, son of Melvinia's master. They may have had a continuing relationship, as she had two more mixed-race children and lived near Shields after emancipation, taking his surname (she later changed her surname).\n\nAs was often the case, Melvinia did not talk to relatives about Dolphus's father. Dolphus Shields, with his wife Alice, moved to Birmingham, Alabama after the Civil War. They were great-great-grandparents of Michelle Robinson, whose grandparents had moved to Chicago. Other of their children's lines migrated to Cleveland, Ohio in the 20th century.\n\nAll four of Robinson's grandparents had multiracial ancestors, reflecting the complex history of the U.S. Her extended family has said that people did not talk about the era of slavery when they were growing up. Her distant ancestry includes Irish, English, and Native American roots. Among her contemporary extended family is Rabbi Capers Funnye; born in Georgetown, South Carolina. Funnye is the son of her grandfather Robinson's sister and her husband, and he is about 12 years older than Michelle. Funnye converted to Judaism after college. He is a paternal first cousin once-removed.\n\nRobinson's childhood home was on the upper floor of 7436 South Euclid Avenue in Chicago's South Shore community area, which her parents rented from her great-aunt, who had the first floor. She was raised in what she describes as a \"conventional\" home, with \"the mother at home, the father works, you have dinner around the table\". Her elementary school was down the street. She and her family enjoyed playing games such as Monopoly, reading, and frequently saw extended family on both sides. She played piano, learning from her great-aunt who was a piano teacher. The Robinsons attended services at nearby South Shore United Methodist Church. They used to vacation in a rustic cabin in White Cloud, Michigan. She and her 21-month older brother, Craig, skipped the second grade.\n\nHer father suffered from multiple sclerosis, which had a profound emotional effect on her as she was growing up. She was determined to stay out of trouble and be a good student, which was what her father wanted for her. By sixth grade, Michelle joined a gifted class at Bryn Mawr Elementary School (later renamed Bouchet Academy). She attended Whitney Young High School, Chicago's first magnet high school, established as a selective enrollment school, where she was a classmate of Jesse Jackson's daughter Santita. The round-trip commute from the Robinsons' South Side home to the Near West Side, where the school was located, took three hours. Michelle recalled being fearful of how others would perceive her, but disregarded any negativity around her and used it \"to fuel me, to keep me going\". She recalled facing gender discrimination growing up, saying, for example, that rather than asking her for her opinion on a given subject, people commonly tended to ask what her older brother thought. She was on the honor roll for four years, took advanced placement classes, was a member of the National Honor Society, and served as student council treasurer. She graduated in 1981 as the salutatorian of her class.\n\nRobinson was inspired to follow her brother to Princeton University, which she entered in 1981. \nShe majored in sociology and minored in African-American studies, graduat \"cum laude\" with a Bachelor of Arts in 1985 after completing a 99-page senior thesis titled \"Princeton Educated Blacks and the Black Community\" under the supervision of Walter Wallace.\n\nRobinson recalls that some of her teachers in high school tried to dissuade her from applying, and that she had been warned against \"setting my sights too high\". She believed that her brother's status as an alumnus — he graduated in 1983, before being hired as a basketball coach at Oregon State University and Brown University — may have helped her during the admission process, but she was resolved to demonstrate her own worth. She has stated that she was overwhelmed during her first year, attributing this to the fact that neither of her parents had graduated from college, and that she had never spent time on a college campus.\n\nThe mother of a white roommate reportedly tried (unsuccessfully) to get her daughter reassigned because of Michelle's race. Robinson said that being at Princeton was the first time she became more aware of her ethnicity and, despite the willingness of her classmates and teachers to reach out to her, she still felt \"like a visitor on campus\". There were also issues of economic class. \"I remember being shocked\", she says, \"by college students who drove BMWs. I didn't even know parents who drove BMWs.\"\n\nWhile at Princeton, Robinson became involved with the Third World Center (now known as the Carl A. Fields Center), an academic and cultural group that supported minority students. She ran their daycare center, which also offered after school tutoring for older children. She challenged the teaching methodology for French because she felt that it should be more conversational. As part of her requirements for graduation, she wrote a sociology thesis, entitled \"Princeton-Educated Blacks and the Black Community\". She researched her thesis by sending a questionnaire to African-American graduates, asking that they specify when and how comfortable they were with their race prior to their enrollment at Princeton and how they felt about it when they were a student and since then. Of the 400 alumni to whom she sent the survey, fewer than 90 responded. Her findings did not support her hope that the black alumni would still identify with the African-American community, even though they had attended an elite university and had the advantages that accrue to its graduates.\n\nRobinson pursued professional study, earning her Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree from Harvard Law School in 1988. By the time she applied for Harvard Law, biographer Bond wrote, her confidence had increased: \"This time around, there was no doubt in her mind that she had earned her place\". Her faculty mentor at Harvard Law was Charles Ogletree, who has said that she had answered the question that had plagued her throughout Princeton by the time she arrived at Harvard Law: whether she would remain the product of her parents or keep the identity she had acquired at Princeton; she had concluded she could be \"both brilliant and black\".\n\nAt Harvard, Robinson participated in demonstrations advocating the hiring of professors who were members of minority groups. She worked for the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau, assisting low-income tenants with housing cases. She is the third First Lady with a postgraduate degree, after her two immediate predecessors, Hillary Clinton and Laura Bush. She later said that her education gave her opportunities beyond what she had ever imagined.\n\nRobinson's father, Fraser C. Robinson III, died from complications from his illness in March 1991. She would later say that although he was the \"hole in my heart\" and \"loss in my scar\", the memory of her father has motivated her each day since. Her friend Suzanne Alele died from cancer around this time as well. These losses made her think of her contributions toward society and how well she was influencing the world from her law firm, in her first job after law school. She considered this a turning point.\n\nRobinson met Barack Obama when they were among the few African Americans at their law firm, Sidley Austin LLP (she has sometimes said only two, although others have noted that there were others in different departments). She was assigned to mentor him while he was a summer associate. Their relationship started with a business lunch and then a community organization meeting where he first impressed her.\n\nBefore meeting Obama, Michelle had told her mother she intended to focus solely on her career. The couple's first date was to Spike Lee's movie \"Do the Right Thing\" (1989). Barack Obama has said that the couple had an \"opposites attract\" scenario in their initial interest in each other, since Michelle had stability from her two-parent home while he was \"adventurous\". They married on October 3, 1992. After suffering a miscarriage, Michelle underwent in vitro fertilisation to conceive their daughters Malia Ann (born 1998) and Natasha (known as Sasha, born 2001). \nThe Obama family lived on Chicago's South Side, where Barack taught at the University of Chicago Law School. He was elected to the state senate in 1996, and to the US Senate in 2004. They chose to keep their residence in Chicago after Barack's election rather than to move to Washington, DC, as they felt it was better for their daughters. Throughout her husband's 2008 campaign for US President, Michelle Obama made a \"commitment to be away overnight only once a week – to campaign only two days a week and be home by the end of the second day\" for their two daughters.\nShe once requested that her then-fiancé meet her prospective boss, Valerie Jarrett, when considering her first career move; Jarrett became one of her husband's closest advisors. The marital relationship has had its ebbs and flows; the combination of an evolving family life and beginning political career led to many arguments about balancing work and family. Barack Obama wrote in his second book, \"\", that \"Tired and stressed, we had little time for conversation, much less romance.\" Despite their family obligations and careers, they continued to try to schedule \"date nights\" while they lived in Chicago.\n\nThe Obamas' daughters attended the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, a private school. As a member of the school's board, Michelle fought to maintain diversity in the school when other board members connected with the University of Chicago tried to reserve more slots for children of the university faculty. This resulted in a plan to expand the school to increase enrollment. In Washington, DC, Malia and Sasha attended Sidwell Friends School, after also considering Georgetown Day School. In 2008 Michelle said in an interview on \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\" that they did not intend to have any more children. The Obamas received advice from past first ladies Laura Bush, Rosalynn Carter and Hillary Clinton about raising children in the White House. Marian Robinson, Michelle's mother, moved into the White House to assist with child care.\n\nMichelle Obama was raised United Methodist and joined the Trinity United Church of Christ, a mostly black congregation of the Reformed denomination known as the United Church of Christ. She and Barack Obama were married there by Rev. Jeremiah Wright. On May 31, 2008, Barack and Michelle Obama announced that they had withdrawn their membership in Trinity United Church of Christ saying: \"Our relations with Trinity have been strained by the divisive statements of Reverend Wright, which sharply conflict with our own views.\"\n\nThe Obama family attended several different Protestant churches after moving to Washington D.C. in 2009, including Shiloh Baptist Church and St. John's Episcopal Church on Lafayette Square, known as the Presidents' Church. At the 49th African Methodist Episcopal Church's general conference, Michelle Obama encouraged the attendees to advocate for political awareness, saying, \"To anyone who says that church is no place to talk about these issues, you tell them there is no place better – no place better, because ultimately, these are not just political issues – they are moral issues, they're issues that have to do with human dignity and human potential, and the future we want for our kids and our grandkids.\"\n\nFollowing law school, Obama became an associate at the Chicago office of the law firm Sidley & Austin, where she met her future husband Barack. At the firm, she worked on marketing and intellectual property law. She continues to hold her law license, but as she no longer needs it for her work, she has kept it on a voluntary inactive status since 1993.\n\nIn 1991, she held public sector positions in the Chicago city government as an Assistant to the Mayor, and as Assistant Commissioner of Planning and Development. In 1993, she became Executive Director for the Chicago office of Public Allies, a non-profit organization encouraging young people to work on social issues in nonprofit groups and government agencies. She worked there nearly four years and set fundraising records for the organization that still stood 12 years after she left. Obama later said that she had never been happier in her life prior to working \"to build Public Allies\".\n\nIn 1996, Obama served as the Associate Dean of Student Services at the University of Chicago, where she developed the University's Community Service Center. In 2002, she began working for the University of Chicago Hospitals, first as executive director for community affairs and, beginning May 2005, as Vice President for Community and External Affairs.\n\nShe continued to hold the University of Chicago Hospitals position during the primary campaign of 2008, but cut back to part-time in order to spend time with her daughters as well as work for her husband's election. She subsequently took a leave of absence from her job.\n\nAccording to the couple's 2006 income tax return, her salary was $273,618 from the University of Chicago Hospitals, while her husband had a salary of $157,082 from the United States Senate. The Obamas' total income was $991,296, which included $51,200 she earned as a member of the board of directors of TreeHouse Foods, and investments and royalties from his books.\n\nObama served as a salaried board member of TreeHouse Foods, Inc. (), a major Wal-Mart supplier from shortly after her husband was seated in the Senate until she cut ties shortly after her husband announced his candidacy for the presidency; he criticized Wal-Mart labor policies at an AFL-CIO forum in Trenton, New Jersey, on May 14, 2007. She also served on the board of directors of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs.\n\nDuring an interview in 1996, Michelle Obama acknowledged there was a \"strong possibility\" her husband would begin a political career, but said she was \"wary\" of the process. She knew it meant their lives would be subject to scrutiny and she was intensely private.\n\nAlthough she campaigned on her husband's behalf since early in his political career by handshaking and fund-raising, she did not relish the activity at first. When she campaigned during her husband's 2000 run for United States House of Representatives, her boss at the University of Chicago asked if there was any single thing about campaigning that she enjoyed; after some thought, she replied that visiting so many living rooms had given her some new decorating ideas. Obama opposed her husband's run for the congressional seat, and, after his defeat, she preferred he tend to the financial needs of the family in what she deemed a more practical way.\n\nAt first, Obama had reservations about her husband's presidential campaign, due to fears about a possible negative effect on their daughters. She says that she negotiated an agreement in which her husband was to quit smoking in exchange for her support of his decision to run. About her role in her husband's presidential campaign she has said: \"My job is not a senior adviser\". During the campaign, she discussed race and education by using motherhood as a framework.\n\nIn May 2007, three months after her husband declared his presidential candidacy, Obama reduced her professional responsibilities by 80 percent to support his presidential campaign. Early in the campaign, she had limited involvement in which she traveled to political events only two days a week and rarely traveled overnight; by early February 2008 her participation had increased significantly. She attended thirty-three events in eight days. She made several campaign appearances with Oprah Winfrey. She wrote her own stump speeches for her husband's presidential campaign and generally spoke without notes.\n\nDuring the campaign, columnist Cal Thomas on Fox News described Michelle Obama as an \"Angry Black Woman\" and some web sites attempted to promote this image. Obama said: \"Barack and I have been in the public eye for many years now, and we've developed a thick skin along the way. When you're out campaigning, there will always be criticism. I just take it in stride, and at the end of the day, I know that it comes with the territory.\"\n\nBy the time of the 2008 Democratic National Convention in August, media outlets observed that her presence on the campaign trail had grown softer than at the start of the race, focusing on soliciting concerns and empathizing with the audience rather than throwing down challenges to them, and giving interviews to shows such as \"The View\" and publications like \"Ladies' Home Journal\" rather than appearing on news programs. The change was reflected in her fashion choices, as she wore clothes that were more informal clothes than her earlier designer pieces. Partly intended to help soften her public image, her appearance on \"The View\" was widely covered in the press.\n\nThe presidential campaign was Obama's first exposure to the national political scene; she was considered the least famous of the candidates' spouses. Early in the campaign, she told anecdotes about Obama family life; however, as the press began to emphasize her sarcasm, she toned it down.\n\n\"New York Times\" op-ed columnist Maureen Dowd wrote: \nOn the first night of the 2008 Democratic National Convention, Craig Robinson introduced his younger sister. She delivered her speech, during which she sought to portray herself and her family as the embodiment of the American Dream. Obama said she and her husband believe \"that you work hard for what you want in life, that your word is your bond, and you do what you say you're going to do, that you treat people with dignity and respect, even if you don't know them, and even if you don't agree with them.\" She also emphasized loving her country, likely responding to criticism for having said that she felt 'proud of her country for the first time'. The first statement was seen as a gaffe. Her keynote address was largely well-received and drew mostly positive reviews. A Rasmussen Reports poll found that her favorability among Americans reached 55%, the highest for her.\n\nOn an October 6, 2008 broadcast, Larry King asked Obama if the American electorate was past the Bradley effect. She said that her husband's winning the nomination was a fairly strong indicator that it was. The same night she was interviewed by Jon Stewart on \"The Daily Show\", where she deflected criticism of her husband and his campaign. On Fox News' \"America's Pulse\", E. D. Hill referred to the fist bump shared by the Obamas on the night that he clinched the Democratic presidential nomination, describing it as a \"terrorist fist jab\". Hill was taken off air and the show was cancelled.\n\nObama campaigned for her husband's re-election in 2012. Beginning in 2011, Obama became more politically active than she had been since the 2008 election, though avoided discussions about the re-election bid. By the time of the election cycle, she had developed a more open public image. Some commentators viewed her as the most popular member of the Obama administration, noting that her poll approval numbers had not dropped below 60% since she entered the White House. An Obama senior campaign official said she was \"the most popular political figure in America\". The positive assessment was reasoned to have contributed to her active role in the re-election campaign, but it was noted that the challenge for the Obama campaign was to use her without tarnishing her popularity.\n\nObama was considered a polarizing figure, having aroused both \"sharp enmity and deep loyalty\" from Americans, but she was also seen as having improved her image since 2008 when her husband first ran for the presidency. Isabel Wilkinson of \"The Daily Beast\" said that Obama's fashion style changed over the course of the campaign to be sensitive and economical.\n\nPrior to the first debate of the election cycle, Obama expressed confidence in her husband's debating skills. He was later criticized for appearing detached and for looking down when addressing Romney. The consensus among uncommitted voters was that the latter 'won' the debate. After Obama's speech at the 2012 Democratic National Convention, the First Lady was found through a CBS News/\"New York Times\" poll conducted in September to have a 61% favorably rating with registered voters, the highest percentage she had polled since April 2009.\n\nObama aimed to humanize her husband by relating stories about him, attempting to appeal to female voters in swing states. Paul Harris of \"The Guardian\" said that the same tactic was being used by Ann Romney, wife of 2012 Republican candidate Mitt Romney. Polls in October showed their husbands tied at 47% for the female vote. However, Michelle Obama's favorability ratings remained higher than Ann Romney's at 69% to 52%. Despite Obama's higher poll numbers, comparisons between Obama and Romney were repeatedly made by the media until the election. But, as Michelle Cottle of \"Newsweek\" wrote, \"...nobody votes for first lady.\"\n\nDuring her early months as First Lady, Obama visited homeless shelters and soup kitchens. She also sent representatives to schools and advocated public service.\n\nObama advocated for her husband's policy priorities by promoting bills that support it. She hosted a White House reception for women's rights advocates in celebration of the enactment of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 Pay equity law. She supported the economic stimulus bill in visits to the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development and United States Department of Education. Some observers looked favorably upon her legislative activities, while others said that she should be less involved in politics. According to her representatives, she intended to visit all United States Cabinet-level agencies in order to get acquainted with Washington.\n\nOn June 5, 2009, the White House announced that Michelle Obama was replacing her then chief of staff, Jackie Norris, with Susan Sher, a longtime friend and adviser. Norris became a senior adviser to the Corporation for National and Community Service. Another key aide, Spelman College alumna Kristen Jarvis, served from 2008 until 2015, when she left to become chief of staff to the Ford Foundation president Darren Walker.\n\nIn 2009, Obama was named Barbara Walters' Most Fascinating Person of the year.\n\nIn her memoir, \"Becoming\", Obama describes her four primary initiatives as First Lady: Let's Move!, Reach Higher, Let Girls Learn, and Joining Forces. Some initiatives of First Lady Michelle Obama included advocating on behalf of military families, helping working women balance career and family, encouraging national service, and promoting the arts and arts education. Obama made supporting military families and spouses a personal mission and increasingly bonded with military families. According to her aides, stories of the sacrifice these families make moved her to tears. In April 2012, Obama and her husband were awarded the Jerald Washington Memorial Founders' Award by the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans (NCHV). The award is the highest honor given to homeless veteran advocates.\nObama was again honored with the award in May 2015, accepting with Jill Biden.\n\nIn November 2013, a \"Politico\" article by Michelle Cottle accusing Obama of being a \"feminist nightmare\" for not using her position and education to advocate for women's issues was sharply criticized across the political spectrum. Cottle quoted Linda Hirshman saying of Obama's trendy styles, promotion of gardening and healthy eating, and support of military families that \"She essentially became the English lady of themanor, Tory Party, circa 1830s.\" A prominent critic of Cottle was MSNBC host Melissa Harris-Perry, who rhetorically asked \"Are you serious?\" Supporters of Obama note that the First Lady had been one of the only people in the administration to address obesity, through promoting good eating habits, which is one of the leading U.S. public health crises.\n\nIn May 2014, Obama joined the campaign to bring back school girls who had been kidnapped in Nigeria. The First Lady tweeted a picture of herself holding a poster with the #bringbackourgirls campaign hashtag. Obama writes in her book about enlisting help for her initiative Let Girls Learn to produce and sing the song \"This is for My Girls\".\n\nOver the course of the Obama presidency, particularly during the second term, Michelle Obama was subject to speculation over whether she would run for the presidency herself, similarly to predecessor Hillary Clinton. A potential Michelle Obama candidacy was supported by both Samuel L. Jackson and James Clyburn. On April 6, 2009, CNN did a poll on whether she should run for the presidency in 2020, 83% of responders being opposed to the idea. A May 2015 Rasmussen poll found Obama had 22% of support to Clinton's 56% of winning the Democratic nomination, higher than that of potential candidates Elizabeth Warren, Martin O'Malley and Bernie Sanders. Another poll from that month found 71% of Americans believed that Obama should not run for the presidency, only 14% approving. On January 14, 2016, during a town-hall meeting, President Obama was asked if the First Lady could be talked into running. He responded, \"There are three things that are certain in life: death, taxes, and Michelle is not running for president. That I can tell you.\" On March 16, 2016, while speaking in Austin, Texas, Obama denied that she would ever run for the office, citing a desire to \"impact as many people as possible in an unbiased way\". In the epilogue to \"Becoming\", Obama writes, \"I have no intention of running for office, ever,\" recognizing that \"politics can be a means for positive change, but this arena is just not for me.\"\n\nObama's predecessors Hillary Clinton and Laura Bush supported the organic movement by instructing the White House kitchens to buy organic food. Obama extended their support of healthy eating by planting the White House Kitchen Garden, an organic garden, the first White House vegetable garden since Eleanor Roosevelt served as First Lady. She also had bee hives installed on the South Lawn of the White House. The garden supplied organic produce and honey for the meals of the First Family and for state dinners and other official gatherings.\n\nIn January 2010, Obama undertook her first lead role in an administration-wide initiative, which she named \"\"Let's Move!\"\", to make progress in reversing the 21st-century trend of childhood obesity. On February 9, 2010, the First Lady announced \"Let's Move!\" and President Barack Obama created the Task Force on Childhood Obesity to review all current programs and create a national plan for change.\n\nMichelle Obama said that her goal was to make this effort her legacy: \"I want to leave something behind that we can say, 'Because of this time that this person spent here, this thing has changed.' And my hope is that that's going to be in the area of childhood obesity.\" Her 2012 book \"\" is based on her experiences with the garden and promotes healthy eating. Her call for action on healthy eating was repeated by the United States Department of Defense, which has been facing an ever-expanding problem of obesity among recruits.\n\nSeveral Republicans have critiqued or lampooned Obama's initiative. In October 2014, senator Rand Paul linked to Michelle Obama's Twitter account when announcing on the website that he was going to Dunkin' Donuts.\nIn January 2016, Chris Christie, Republican Governor of New Jersey and presidential candidate, criticized the First Lady's involvement with healthy eating while he was campaigning in Iowa, arguing that she was using the government to exercise her views on eating. Obama had previously cited Christie as an example of an adult who struggled with obesity, a demographic she sought to diminish by targeting children since \"Let's Move!\" was \"working with kids when they're young, so that they don't have these direct challenges when they get older.\" In February, Senator Ted Cruz said that he would end Obama's health policies and return french fries to school cafeterias if his wife was First Lady.\n\nIn the 2008 US presidential campaign, Obama boasted to gay Democratic groups of her husband's record on LGBT rights: his support of the Illinois Human Rights Act, the Illinois gender violence act, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, repealing Don't Ask Don't Tell, and full repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act, civil unions; along with hate crimes protection for sexual orientation and gender identity and renewed effort to fight HIV and AIDS. They have both opposed amendments proposed to ban same-sex marriage in the federal, California, and Florida constitutions. She said that the US Supreme Court delivered justice in the \"Lawrence v. Texas\" case and drew a connection between the struggles for gay rights and civil rights by saying, \"We are all only here because of those who marched and bled and died, from Selma to Stonewall, in the pursuit of a more perfect union.\"\n\nAfter the repeal of Don't Ask Don't Tell on September 20, 2011, Obama included openly gay service members in her national military families initiative. On May 9, 2012, Barack and Michelle Obama came out publicly in favor of same-sex marriage. Prior to this, Michelle Obama had never publicly stated her position on this issue. Senior White House officials said that Michelle Obama and Senior Adviser Valerie Jarrett had been the two most consistent advocates for same-sex marriage in Barack Obama's life. Michelle said:\nThis is an important issue for millions of Americans, and for Barack and me, it really comes down to the values of fairness and equality we want to pass down to our girls. These are basic values that kids learn at a very young age and that we encourage them to apply in all areas of their lives. And in a country where we teach our children that everyone is equal under the law, discriminating against same-sex couples just isn't right. It's as simple as that.\n\nAt the 2012 DNC, Michelle said, \"Barack knows the American Dream because he's lived it ... and he wants everyone in this country to have that same opportunity, no matter who we are, or where we're from, or what we look like, or who we love.\"\n\nIn May 2009, Obama delivered the commencement speech at a graduating ceremony at UC Merced in Merced County, California, the address being praised afterward by students who found her relatable. Kevin Fagan of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" wrote that there was chemistry between Obama and the students.\n\nIn August 2013, Obama attended the 50th anniversary ceremony for the March on Washington at the Lincoln Memorial. Positive attention was brought to Obama's attire, a black sleeveless dress with red flowers, designed by Tracy Reese. Reese reacted by releasing a public statement that she was honored the First Lady \"would choose to wear one of our designs during the celebration of such a deeply significant historical moment\".\n\nIn March 2015, Obama traveled to Selma, Alabama, with her family to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the Selma to Montgomery marches. After President Obama's remarks there, the Obamas joined original marchers in crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge.\n\nIn July 2015, Obama journeyed to Coachella Valley while coming to Los Angeles for that year's Special Olympics World Games.\n\nIn October 2015, Obama was joined by Jill Biden and Prince Harry in visiting a military base in Fort Belvoir, Virginia, in an attempt on the prince's part to raise awareness to programs supporting harmed service members. In December 2015, Obama traveled with her husband to San Bernardino, California, to meet with families of the victims of a terrorist attack that occurred two weeks earlier.\n\nOn April 1, 2009, Obama met with Queen Elizabeth II in Buckingham Palace, Obama embracing her before attending an event with world leaders. Obama praised her, though the hug generated controversy for being out of protocol when greeting Elizabeth.\n\nIn April 2010, Obama traveled to Mexico, her first solo visit to a nation. In Mexico, Obama spoke to students, encouraging them to take responsibility for their futures. Referring to the underprivileged children, Obama argued that \"potential can be found in some of the most unlikely places\", citing herself and her husband as examples.\n\nObama traveled to Africa for the second official trip in June 2011, touring Johannesburg, Cape Town and Botswana and meeting with Graça Machel. Obama was also involved with community events in the foreign countries. It was commented by White House staff that her trip to Africa would advance the foreign policy of her husband.\n\nIn March 2014, Obama visited China along with her two daughters Malia and Sasha, and her mother Marian Robinson. She met with Peng Liyuan, the wife of Chinese President Xi Jinping, visited historic and cultural sites, as well as a university and two high schools. Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said that the visit and intent in Obama journeying there was to symbolize \"the relationship between the United States and China is not just between leaders, it's a relationship between peoples\".\n\nIn January 2015, Obama traveled to Saudi Arabia alongside her husband, following the death of King Abdullah. She received criticism for not covering her head in a nation where women are forbidden from publicly not doing so, though Obama was defended for being a foreigner and thus not having to submit to Saudi Arabia's customs, even being praised in some corners. Obama was neither greeted nor acknowledged by King Salman during the encounter.\n\nIn June 2015, Obama undertook a weeklong trip to London and three Italian cities. In London, she spoke with students about international education for adolescent girls and met with both British Prime Minister David Cameron and Prince Harry. She was joined by her two daughters and mother. In November, she spent a week in Qatar, her first official visit to the Middle East. She continued advancing her initiative for international education for women by speaking at the 2015 World Innovation Summit for Education for her \"Let Girls Learn\" initiative in Doha, Qatar and touring a school in Amman, Jordan, where she met with female students. During the Qatar trip, Obama had intended to visit Jordan as well, but the trip was canceled due to weather conditions. In Jordan, Obama had intended to visit an Amman school, which had been constructed with assistance from U.S. funds.\n\nIn March 2016, Obama accompanied her husband and children to Cuba in a trip that was seen by the administration as having the possibility of positively impacting relations between the country and America. Later that month, the First Couple and their daughters traveled to Argentina, meeting with Argentine President Mauricio Macri.\n\nObama campaigned for Democratic candidates in the 2010 midterm elections, making her debut on the campaign trail in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\nBy the time she began campaigning, Obama's approval rating was 20 percentage points higher than her husband's.\nThough Obama indicated in January 2010 that a consensus had not been made about whether she would campaign, speculation of her involvement came from her large approval rating as well as reports that she had been invited to speak at events with Democrats such as Barbara Boxer, Mary Jo Kilroy and Joe Sestak.\nShe toured seven states in two weeks within October 2010. Though viewed as essential by the White House, aides reported that she would not become deeply involved with political discussions nor engage Republicans in public disputes. After the elections took place, only six of the thirteen Democratic candidates Obama had campaigned for won. The \"Los Angeles Times\" concluded that while Obama was indeed more popular than her husband, her \"election scorecard proved no better than his, particularly in her home state\".\nObama was a participant in the 2014 midterm elections, held at a time where her popularity superseded her husband's to such an extent that it was theorized that she would receive a much larger outpour of support in campaigning. Reporting her travel to Denver, Colorado, David Lightman wrote that while Democrats did not want President Obama to campaign for them, \"the first lady is very popular\". In May 2014, Obama was found to have a 61% favorable approval rating from a CNN poll, her husband coming in at 43%. In a video released in July, as part of an effort to encourage voter turnout, she called on voters to be \"hungry as you were back in 2008 and 2012\". Obama appeared at a fundraiser in Georgia in September for Democratic senate candidate Michelle Nunn. Obama's approach to campaigning in Georgia strayed from discussing current events and instead broadly stressed the importance of registering to vote and turning out during the elections. Obama's infrequent appearances came from her dislike of being away from her children and Washington politics as well as her distaste for the opposition by Republicans to her husband's agenda and her view that Democrats in the U.S. Senate had not sufficiently been supporters of her initiatives to end childhood obesity. Obama raised her profile in October, touring three states in four days. Obama called the elections her husband's \"last campaign\".\n\nObama endorsed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and made several high-profile speeches in favor of her, including an address at the 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. She also appeared multiple times on the campaign trail in either solo or joint appearances with Clinton. On October 13, 2016, Obama heavily criticized Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump for the statements he made in a 2005 audio recording while at a Clinton rally in Manchester, New Hampshire. A week later, Trump attempted to revive past comments Obama made in regards to Clinton during the 2008 presidential election.\n\nWith the ascent of her husband as a prominent national politician, Obama became a part of popular culture. In May 2006, \"Essence\" listed her among \"25 of the World's Most Inspiring Women\". In July 2007, \"Vanity Fair\" listed her among \"10 of the World's Best Dressed People\". She was an honorary guest at Oprah Winfrey's Legends Ball as a \"young'un\" paying tribute to the \"Legends\" who helped pave the way for African-American women. In September 2007, \"02138\" magazine listed her 58th of 'The Harvard 100'; a list of the prior year's most influential . Her husband was ranked fourth. In July 2008, she made a repeat appearance on the \"Vanity Fair\" international best dressed list. She also appeared on the 2008 \"People\" list of best-dressed women and was praised by the magazine for her \"classic and confident\" look.\n\nAt the time of her husband's election, some sources anticipated that as a high-profile African-American woman in a stable marriage Obama would be a positive role model who would influence the view the world has of African-Americans. Her fashion choices were part of the 2009 Fashion week, but Obama's influence in the field did not have the impact on the paucity of African-American models who participate, that some thought it might.\n\nObama's public support grew in her early months as First Lady, as she was accepted as a role model. On her first trip abroad in April 2009, she toured a cancer ward with Sarah Brown, wife of British Prime Minister Gordon Brown. \"Newsweek\" described her first trip abroad as an exhibition of her so-called \"star power\" and MSN described it as a display of sartorial elegance. Questions were raised by some in the American and British media regarding protocol when the Obamas met Queen Elizabeth II and Michelle reciprocated a touch on her back by the Queen during a reception, purportedly against traditional royal etiquette. Palace sources denied that any breach in etiquette had occurred.\n\nObama has been compared to Jacqueline Kennedy due to her sense of style, and also to Barbara Bush for her discipline and decorum. Obama's style has been described as \"fashion populist\". In 2010, she wore clothes, many high end, from more than 50 design companies with less expensive pieces from J.Crew and Target, and the same year a study found that her patronage was worth an average of 14 million to a company. She became a fashion trendsetter, in particular favoring sleeveless dresses, including her first-term official portrait in a dress by Michael Kors, and her ball gowns designed by Jason Wu for both inaugurals. She has also been known for wearing clothes by African designers such as Mimi Plange, Duro Olowu, Maki Oh, and Osei Duro, and styles such as the Adire fabric.\n\nObama appeared on the cover and in a photo spread in the March 2009 issue of \"Vogue\". Every First Lady since Lou Hoover (except Bess Truman) has been in \"Vogue\", but only Hillary Clinton had previously appeared on the cover. Obama later appeared two more times on the cover of \"Vogue\", while First Lady, the last time in December 2016, with photographs by Annie Leibovitz. In August 2011, she became the first woman ever to appear on the cover of \"Better Homes and Gardens\" magazine, and the first person in 48 years. In 2013, during the 85th Academy Awards, she became the first First Lady to announce the winner of an Oscar (Best Picture which went to \"Argo\"). In March 2020, \"Time\" magazine included Obama's name on its list of 100 Women of the Year. She was chosen as the Woman of the Year 2008 for her role in her husband's presidential campaign and her subsequent efforts in tackling social issues.\n\nThe media have been criticized for focusing more on the First Lady's fashion sense than her serious contributions. She said after the 2008 election that she would like to focus attention as First Lady on issues of concern to military and working families. In 2008 \"U.S. News & World Report\" blogger, PBS host and Scripps Howard columnist Bonnie Erbé argued that Obama's own publicists seemed to be feeding the emphasis on style over substance, and stated that Obama was miscasting herself by overemphasizing style.\nIn May 2017, during an appearance at the Partnership for a Healthier America conference, Obama rebuked the Trump administration for its delay of a federal requirement designed to increase the nutritional standards for school lunches. In June, while attending the WWDC in Silicon Valley, California, Obama called for tech companies to add women for the diversifying of their ranks. In July, Obama honored Eunice Shriver at the 2017 ESPY Awards. In September, Obama delivered an address at the tech conference in Utah charging the Trump administration with having a fearful White House, appeared in a video for the Global Citizens Festival advocating more attention to giving young girls an education, and attended the Inbound 2017 conference in Boston. During an October 3 appearance at the Philadelphia Conference for Women, Obama cited a lack of diversity in politics with contributing to lawmakers being distrusted by other groups. In November, Obama discussed gender disparity in attitudes with Elizabeth Alexander while attending the Obama Foundation Summit in Chicago, and spoke at the Bushnell Center for the Performing Arts in Hartford, Connecticut.\n\nObama's memoir, \"Becoming\" was released in November 2018. It had sold 10 million copies by late March 2019.\n\nDespite speculation that she would be running for president in 2020, Barack Obama stated during a campaign rally in Nevada that Michelle would not be running for president in 2020. She has previously stated that she has no passion for politics.\n\nIn an April 27, 2020 Instagram post, Obama announced the forthcoming release of a Netflix documentary about her \"Becoming\" book tour.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2204751", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2204751", "title": "L. Heisler Ball", "text": "L. Heisler Ball\n\nLewis Heisler Ball (September 21, 1861 – October 18, 1932) was an American physician and politician from Mill Creek Hundred, New Castle County, Delaware. He was a member of the Republican Party and served as U.S. Representative from Delaware and two terms as U.S. Senator from Delaware. He was known by his middle name.\n\nBall was born in Mill Creek Hundred, New Castle County, Delaware, the son of John Ball and Sarah (Baldwin) Ball. He attended the Rugby Academy at Wilmington, Delaware, and graduated from the Delaware College at Newark, Delaware in 1882. He received his medical degree from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in Philadelphia in 1885 and began the practice of medicine at Brandywine Springs, near Wilmington in 1887. He married Katherine Springer Justis on November 14, 1893.\n\nAt the turn of the twentieth century, Delaware was going through a political transformation. Most obvious to the public was the bitter division in the Republican Party caused, in part, by the ambitions of J. Edward Addicks for a seat in the U.S. Senate. A gas company industrialist, he spent vast amounts of his own fortune to build a Republican Party, with that purpose in mind. Largely successful in heavily Democratic Kent County and Sussex County, he financed the organization of a faction that came to be known as \"Union Republicans\". Meanwhile, he was making bitter enemies of the New Castle County \"Regular Republicans\", many of whom considered him nothing more than a carpetbagger from Philadelphia.\n\nBall was a \"Regular Republican\", and an outspoken opponent of Addicks. As such he was elected State Treasurer of Delaware from 1899 to 1901. He was then elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1900. and served with the Republican majority in the 57th Congress from March 4, 1901, until March 3, 1903, during the administrations of U.S. Presidents William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt.\n\nIn 1899 one of the U.S. Senate seats for Delaware became vacant and the Union Republicans in the Delaware General Assembly attempted to electing Addicks. Although they did not have enough votes to do so, the Union Republicans were able to block the election of any other candidate. Because of this deadlock, the seat remained vacant for four years. When the other Senate seat came open in 1901, it too was left vacant due to the deadlock. Finally, in 1903, the matter became national news and too much of an embarrassment. Addicks relented and allowed Ball to be elected to the remaining two years left on the first seat and Addicks' lieutenant, J. Frank Allee was elected to the second seat.\n\nBall was elected to the U.S. Senate on March 2, 1903, and served the remaining two years of the term with the Republican majority in the 58th Congress. In 1905, when Ball's term ended, the General Assembly again deadlocked and took another two years to fill the seat. The repeated inability of the Delaware General Assembly to fulfill this constitutional duty contributed strong evidence throughout the nation of the need for the Seventeenth Amendment providing for the popular election of U.S. Senators.\n\nIn 1918, Ball was elected to the U.S. Senate in the second popular election of a U.S. Senator in Delaware, defeating incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator Willard Saulsbury, Jr.. During this term, Ball served with the Republican majority in the 66th, 67th and 68th U.S. Congress. In the 66th Congress, he was chairman of the Committee on Enrolled Bills and in the 67th and 68th Congress, he was a member of the Committee on the District of Columbia. He was also appointed as a member of the rent commission of Washington. Ball's actions with the rent commission angered some people. In August 1921, a shot was fired at Ball as he drove in an automobile, although he was not injured. The senator had received a threatening letter the day of the assault.\n\nIn June 1919 he cast his vote in favor of the Nineteenth Amendment providing for Women's suffrage.\n\nBall was never considered an especially effective U.S. Senator in terms of gaining patronage for Delaware. He became a rival of T. Coleman du Pont, the former President of E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company and the effective leader of the Republican Party in Delaware. Du Pont had hoped to be the Republican candidate for U.S. President in 1920, but his efforts began to collapse when Ball deserted him after the first ballot at the 1920 Republican National Convention. Then, in 1922, Ball failed to support du Pont as he sought a full term in the U.S. Senate himself. By 1924 du Pont thought he had a score to settle and defeated Ball for their party’s nomination for a full term in 1924.\n\nBall died at Faulkland, near Wilmington, and is buried in the St. James Episcopal Church Cemetery near Stanton, Delaware.\n\n\n\n"}

According to one source, his father was a Barbadian “of full African blood” and his mother was “entirely or largely” Spanish or Portuguese. Other sources state that Fortes was born in Barbados. After leaving his homeland in his mid-teens, he worked in Britain for several years. In 1884 he sailed around Cape Horn from Liverpool on the \"Robert Kerr\", arriving in Burrard Inlet, a coastal fjord in southwestern British Columbia, in September 1885. His name occurs repeatedly in the ship's log as Seraphim Fortes.\n\nMaking his home at English Bay, he lived in a tent on the beach during the milder months of the year. After the start of the 20th century, he moved into a cottage at the foot of Bidwell Street on the shore-side of Beach Avenue. His little house was later moved to the other side of the street, just east of Alexandra Park.\n\nJoe Fortes devoted all of his free time to teaching children to swim and to patrolling the beach. The self-appointed unpaid guard continued to support himself by working odd jobs until, in 1900, the City appointed him its first official lifeguard.\n\nHis contemporaries referred to him respectfully and lovingly as \"Old Black Joe\" or \"English Bay Joe\". The stocky, dark-skinned man was a friend and teacher to the children, a guard for the bathers and a hero to people in distress. He has been officially credited with saving 29 lives, yet it is believed that the real number is considerably higher.\n\nIn 1910 the City honoured Joe Fortes for his many years of service to the public by presenting him with a gold watch, a cheque and an illuminated address.\n\nWhen Joe Fortes died on February 4, 1922, Vancouver held a record-breaking funeral procession for him. Mourners crowded into Holy Rosary Cathedral to bid farewell to a brave, kind and modest friend. Fortes was buried in Mountain View Cemetery. A flat stone marks his grave, simply inscribed: \"JOE\".\n\nIn June 1927 the citizens of Vancouver dedicated a monument to Joe Fortes. The fountain in Alexandra Park by sculptor Charles Marega bears the inscription: LITTLE CHILDREN LOVED HIM.\n\nHe is still remembered today.

While flying at , they reported surface-to-air fire. The fire was actually from a Canadian Forces anti-tank and machine-gun exercise, which was taking place on a former Taliban firing range.\n\nMaj Schmidt descended a few thousand feet to take a closer look, and asked for permission to \"lay down some 20 mike-mike\", or spray the area with 20-millimeter cannon fire, but was told to stand by. Major Umbach cautioned his wing man to wait, as well. \"Let's just make sure that it's, that it's not friendlies, is all\", he said.\n\nAt 9:25, the pilots' AWACS controller ordered them to \"hold fire\" and asked Major Schmidt for more information on the surface-to-air fire. However, a minute later, after seeing another firing plume from an antitank weapon, Major Schmidt reported seeing \"some men on a road, and it looks like a piece of artillery firing at us.\"\n\n\"I am rolling in in self-defense\", he said.\n\nAfter Major Umbach reminded him to unlock his weapons, Major Schmidt called \"bombs away\". Twenty-two seconds later, he reported a direct hit. Ten seconds later, the controller ordered the pilots to disengage, saying the forces on the ground were \"friendlies Kandahar\".\n\nMajor Schmidt's testimony at his \"Article 32\" hearing was that he believed his flight leader, Major Umbach, was under attack. The radio logs show that Major Schmidt requested permission from flight control to fire his 20 mm cannons at what he said to be an anti-aircraft or Multiple Launch Rocket System below.\n\nThe soldiers who were killed were:\n\nThe eight wounded men include:\n\nTwo Boards of Inquiry, one Canadian and one American, were held simultaneously. The two boards shared personnel information. Canadian Brigadier-General M.J. Dumais was specialist advisor to the Canadian board and co-chair of the American board. The findings of the four-member Canadian Tarnak Farm Board of Inquiry, chaired by General Maurice Baril, were released on June 28, 2002. The Board found that the Canadian troops engaged in the night live-fire exercise had conducted their operations as authorized and in accordance with the established range procedures for the types of weapons fire. The Board concluded that the American F-16 pilots contravened established procedures and were the cause of the incident. The Board further concluded that correcting deficiencies in air coordination and control and tactical planning might have prevented the accident:\n\n\"... as much as the F-16 pilots bear final responsibility for the fratricide incident, there existed other systemic shortcomings in air coordination and control procedures, as well as mission planning practices by the tactical flying units, that may have prevented the accident had they been corrected.\"\n\nIn his official apology to the family and friends of the dead and injured Canadians, Schmidt stated:\n\nDuring the Article 32 hearing, five F-16 pilots testified, including one who had led the US Board of Inquiry. All five pilots agreed under oath that the dropping of the bomb by Schmidt was not an unreasonable action. Michael Friscolanti summarized their comments in his book \"Friendly Fire\":\n\nOne of the issues highlighted by the Inquiry related to the use of amphetamines in combat. In testimony it was revealed that Schmidt and Umbach were told by their superiors to use \"go pills\" on their missions, and the airmen blamed the incident on the drugs. This was a significant part of the defense of the two pilots. Schmidt's defense also blamed the fog of war.\n\nAnother issue that was evident, but remained largely in the background, was the quality of communications between the various coalition forces in Afghanistan.\n\nOn September 11, 2002, William Umbach and Harry Schmidt were officially charged with four counts of negligent manslaughter, eight counts of aggravated assault, and one count of dereliction of duty. Umbach's charges were later dismissed. Schmidt's charges were reduced on June 30, 2003, to just the dereliction of duty charge.\n\nOn July 6, 2004, Umbach was reprimanded for leadership failures and allowed to retire. U.S. Lt.-Gen. Bruce Carlson found Schmidt guilty of dereliction of duty in what the U.S. military calls a \"non-judicial hearing\" before a senior officer. He was fined nearly $5,700 in pay and reprimanded. The reprimand, written by Lt. Gen. Carlson said Schmidt had \"flagrantly disregarded a direct order\", \"exercised a total lack of basic flight discipline\", and \"blatantly ignored the applicable rules of engagement\".\n\nHere is an excerpt from the letter of reprimand given to Schmidt:\n\nIn April 2006, Schmidt sued the USAF, saying that the military violated the federal Privacy Act by disclosing parts of his military record without his permission and by doing so ruined his reputation. On September 22, 2007, U.S. District Judge Jeanne Scott ruled against Schmidt, stating, \"The release of Schmidt's reprimand gave the public ... insight into the way in which the United States government was holding its pilot accountable. Thus considering all of the circumstances, the disclosures at issue were clearly warranted.\"\n\nThis was the most serious case of fratricide or friendly fire to have been experienced by the Canadian Forces (CF) in Coalition operations since the Korean War.\n\nPrivate Green's mother, Doreen Coolen, was chosen by the Royal Canadian Legion to be the Silver Cross Mother for the Remembrance Day ceremony in Ottawa in 2002.\n\nPrivate Smith's mother, Charlotte Lynn Smith, was named the Silver Cross Mother in 2003. Camp Nathan Smith in Afghanistan was named after him.\n\nCorporal Dyer's mother, Agatha Dyer, was chosen as the Silver Cross Mother in 2004. Ainsworth Dyer Memorial Bridge in Rundle Park, Edmonton, was named in his memory.\n\nSergeant Léger's mother, Claire Léger, was chosen as the Silver Cross Mother in 2005.

The line descended from Alexander, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg. Like all of the secondary lines from the Sonderburg branch, the heads of the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg were first known as Dukes of Schleswig-Holstein and Dukes of Sonderburg. The family took its name from its ancestral home, Augustenborg Palace in Augustenborg, Denmark.\n\nThe branch originated from Ernest Günther, a member of the ducal house of Schleswig-Holstein (its branch of Sønderborg) and a cadet of the royal house of Denmark. He was the third son of Alexander, 2nd Duke of Sonderborg (1573–1627), and thus a grandson of John the Younger (1545–1622), the first duke, who was a son of King Christian III of Denmark.\n\nErnest Günther had a castle built in the years after 1651, which received the name of Augustenborg in honor of his wife, Auguste. She was also from a branch of the Dukes of Schleswig-Holstein as a daughter of Philip (1584–1663), Duke of Glücksburg. As that castle became the chief seat of their line, the family eventually used the name of Augustenborg as its branch name. As they were agnates of the ducal house, the title of duke belonged to every one of them (as is the Germanic custom).\n\nThe Dukes of Augustenborg were not sovereign rulers—they held their lands in fief to their dynastically-senior kinsmen, the sovereign Dukes of Schleswig and Holstein—who were the Oldenburg Kings of Denmark.\n\nLater, a Danish king made the head of that line specifically Duke of Augustenborg. In the late 18th century, since 1764, the branch of Schleswig-Holsten-Sønderborg-Augustenborg was genealogically the next senior branch immediately after the main line of Danish kings. King Frederick VI of Denmark (or, rather, his chief adviser Andreas Peter Bernstorff), made his only sister Louise Auguste of Denmark marry the then Hereditary Prince Christian of Augustenborg.\n\nIn 1764, Sønderborg castle, the seat of that elder Schleswig-Holstein branch, passed upon its owners' extinction into the hands of the Duke of Augustenborg, but against expectations it did not became a residence (they remained at Augustenborg). Instead it was rented out as a warehouse. The penultimate Duke of Augustenborg, also named Ernst Günther, allowed Sønderborg County Museum to move into a part of the castle in 1920. The next year the Danish state bought the castle from the Duke.\n\nIn 1810, a younger scion of the family, Prince Christian August, was chosen as the Crown Prince of Sweden, and adopted by king Charles XIII of Sweden. An Augustenborg dynasty on a royal throne was however not to be, as Prince Christian August died a couple of months after his arrival in Sweden.\n\nIn the early 19th century, the Danish royal line started to go extinct. The Duke of Augustenborg was the next male-line heir to the royal house, though not descended in male line from Frederick III of Denmark and Norway. This made the duke a player in the convoluted Schleswig-Holstein Question, as well as a candidate in the Danish succession. Frederik August of Augustenborg attempted to proclaim himself reigning Duke Frederick VIII of Schleswig-Holstein in 1864, upon the final extinction of the senior branch of the Danish kings. His daughter, Augusta Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein, became German Empress as consort of Wilhelm II.\n\nThe ducal line died out in 1931. In November 1920, its penultimate head had adopted Prince Johann Georg of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg and his sister Princess Marie Luise, children of Prince Albrecht of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg. After Augustenborg's extinction in 1931, seniority fell to the line of the Dukes of Glücksburg, heads of the second line of Holstein, known in German as \"Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg\" and in Danish as Slesvig-Holsten-Sønderborg-Lyksborg.\n\n\nLike the kings of the earlier Oldenburg line, of which the House of Glücksburg is a cadet branch, monarchs of the Glücksburg dynasty in Denmark also bore the titles of Dukes of Schleswig and Holstein. Margrethe II of Denmark abandoned this tradition upon ascending the Danish throne in 1972.\n"}
{"id": "2204768", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2204768", "title": "Renninger negative-result experiment", "text": "Renninger negative-result experiment\n\nIn quantum mechanics, the Renninger negative-result experiment is a thought experiment that illustrates some of the difficulties of understanding the nature of wave function collapse and measurement in quantum mechanics. The statement is that a particle need not be detected in order for a quantum measurement to occur, and that the lack of a particle detection can also constitute a measurement. The thought experiment was first posed in 1953 by Mauritius Renninger. It can be understood to be a refinement of the paradox presented in the Mott problem. \n\nThe Mott problem concerns the paradox of reconciling the spherical wave function describing the emission of an alpha ray by a radioactive nucleus, with the linear tracks seen in a cloud chamber. Formulated in 1929 by Sir Nevill Francis Mott and Werner Heisenberg, it was resolved by a calculation done by Mott that showed that the correct quantum mechanical system must include the wave functions for the atoms in the cloud chamber as well as that for the alpha ray. The calculation showed that the resulting probability is non-zero only on straight lines raying out from the decayed atom; that is, once the measurement is performed, the wave-function becomes non-vanishing only near the classical trajectory of a particle.\n\nIn the Renninger formulation, the cloud chamber is replaced by a pair of hemispherical particle detectors, completely surrounding a radioactive atom at the center that is about to decay by emitting an alpha ray. For the purposes of the thought experiment, the detectors are assumed to be 100% efficient, so that the emitted alpha ray is always detected.\n\nBy consideration of the normal process of quantum measurement, it is clear that if one detector registers the decay, then the other will not: a single particle cannot be detected by both detectors. The core observation is that the non-observation of a particle on one of the shells is just as good a measurement as detecting it on the other.\n\nThe strength of the paradox can be heightened by considering the two hemispheres to be of different diameters; with the outer shell a good distance farther away. In this case, after the non-observation of the alpha ray on the inner shell, one is led to conclude that the (originally spherical) wave function has \"collapsed\" to a hemisphere shape, and (because the outer shell is distant) is still in the process of propagating to the outer shell, where it is guaranteed to eventually be detected.\n\nIn the standard quantum-mechanical formulation, the statement is that the wave-function has partially collapsed, and has taken on a hemispherical shape. The full collapse of the wave function, down to a single point, does not occur until it interacts with the outer hemisphere. The conundrum of this thought experiment lies in the idea that the wave function interacted with the inner shell, causing a partial collapse of the wave function, without actually triggering any of the detectors on the inner shell. This illustrates that wave function collapse can occur even in the absence of particle detection.\n\nThere are a number of common objections to the standard interpretation of the experiment. Some of these objections, and standard rebuttals, are listed below.\n\nIt is sometimes noted that the time of the decay of the nucleus cannot be controlled, and that the finite half-life invalidates the result. This objection can be dispelled by sizing the hemispheres appropriately with regards to the half-life of the nucleus. The radii are chosen so that the more distant hemisphere is much farther away than the half-life of the decaying nucleus, times the flight-time of the alpha ray. \n\nTo lend concreteness to the example, assume that the half-life of the decaying nucleus is 0.01 microsecond (most elementary particle decay half-lives are much shorter; most nuclear decay half-lives are much longer; some atomic electromagnetic excitations have a half-life about this long). If one were to wait 0.4 microseconds, then the probability that the particle will have decayed will be formula_1; that is, the probability will be very very close to one. The outer hemisphere is then placed at (speed of light) times (0.4 microseconds) away: that is, at about 120 meters away. The inner hemisphere is taken to be much closer, say at 1 meter.\n\nIf, after (for example) 0.3 microseconds, one has not seen the decay product on the inner, closer, hemisphere, one can conclude that the particle has decayed with almost absolute certainty, but is still in-flight to the outer hemisphere. The paradox then concerns the correct description of the wave function in such a scenario.\n\nAnother common objection states that the decay particle was always travelling in a straight line, and that only the probability of the distribution is spherical. This, however, is a mis-interpretation of the Mott problem, and is false. The wave function was truly spherical, and is not the incoherent superposition (mixed state) of a large number of plane waves. The distinction between mixed and pure states is illustrated more clearly in a different context, in the debate comparing the ideas behind local hidden variables and their refutation by means of the Bell inequalities.\n\nA true quantum-mechanical wave would diffract from the inner hemisphere, leaving a diffraction pattern to be observed on the outer hemisphere. This is not really an objection, but rather an affirmation that a partial collapse of the wave function has occurred. If a diffraction pattern were not observed, one would be forced to conclude that the particle had collapsed down to a ray, and stayed that way, as it passed the inner hemisphere; this is clearly at odds with standard quantum mechanics. Diffraction from the inner hemisphere is expected.\n\nIn this objection, it is noted that in real life, a decay product is either spin-1/2 (a fermion) or a photon (spin-1). This is taken to mean that the decay is not truly sphere symmetric, but rather has some other distribution, such as a p-wave. However, on closer examination, one sees this has no bearing on the spherical symmetry of the wave-function. Even if the initial state could be polarized; for example, by placing it in a magnetic field, the non-spherical decay pattern is still properly described by quantum mechanics.\n\nThe above formulation is inherently phrased in a non-relativistic language; and it is noted that elementary particles have relativistic decay products. This objection only serves to confuse the issue. The experiment can be reformulated so that the decay product is slow-moving. At any rate, special relativity is not in conflict with quantum mechanics.\n\nThis objection states that in real life, particle detectors are imperfect, and sometimes neither the detectors on the one hemisphere, nor the other, will go off. This argument only serves to confuse the issue, and has no bearing on the fundamental nature of the wave-function.\n\n\n"}

In its 80+ years it has changed considerably. It was the first commercial station to begin broadcasting in South Australia.\n\nRadio 5DN began operating as an experimental station in 1924 on a wavelength of \"about 200 metres\" (1500 kHz), with official services beginning on 24 February 1925. It began as the hobby of businessman and industrialist Ernest James Hume, a brother of Walter Reginald Hume, but soon grew to absorb the time and energy of the Hume family.\n\nHume bought his transmitter, and some other equipment from radio pioneer Lance C. Jones, who ran station 5BQ in Westbourne Park. The purchase included the original call sign: \"5Don N\", which had been allocated to Jones in 1923. The origin of that call sign has been lost in the mists of time, but it may be the result of an early spelling alphabet (A for Arthur, C for Charlie, D for Don, etc.).\n\nThe transmitter and studios were set up in the Hume family mansion, Peltonga, on Park Terrace (now Greenhill Road), in the suburb of Parkside. Hume installed landlines from the Elder Conservatorium and Adelaide University, allowing live broadcasts of concerts and lectures.\n\nThe original voice of 5Don N was E.J. Hume's wife Stella. As well as being an announcer, she also acted as program organiser, studio director, technical operator, pianist and producer. Their eldest son, Ernest Jeremy Hume took over as technical operator from Jones.\n\nInitially, 5DN broadcast only a few hours a day, three days a week, but as the number of listeners grew, broadcasting hours were extended until it became a full-time 24 hours a day radio station. By 1928, transmissions from 5DN were accessed in almost every country.\n\n5DN was one of the original members of the Macquarie Broadcasting Network, which provided programming and advertising sales services to its stations. Among the Macquarie stars to feature on 5DN in the early years were Australia's first real radio \"star\", Jack Davey, and Roy Rene and his character \"Mo\", after whom Australia's entertainment awards, the Mo Awards, are named.\n\nBig local names of 5DN in the 40s and 50s included long time Breakfast announcer, Mel Cameron, Vic Braham, Ron Sullivan, Phyllis Pullman, Alan Sanders and Barry Hall. Cameron was on the air at 5DN for more than 35 years, making him one of South Australia's best known radio voices.\n\nOne of the station's most popular locally produced programs of the late 1940s and 50s was \"Under the Stars\", written for 20 years by 5DN's chief scriptwriter, Merv Hill. He also single-handedly wrote the scripts for \"Radio Canteen\". Begun as an experiment in Saturday night live entertainment, the show ran for 13 years, featuring virtually every leading entertainer in South Australia.\n\nOther shows heard on 5DN around the same time included \"Quiz Kids\", the \"Cashmere Bouquet Show\", \"Doctor Mac\" and \"Music While You Work\", many of them originating from the Macquarie Network production studios in Sydney.\n\nDuring the late 30s 5DN kept its listeners informed, with regular news broadcasts, establishing South Australia's first independent radio news service in 1938. It continued its news service during the war years, and in the 1950s continued its own local news service, with the backing of Macquarie National News, which became the largest radio news network in Australia.\n\nSport has also played a large part in 5DN's programming. The station became the first in South Australia to introduce \"ball by ball\" commentaries on cricket, in 1930. The station also covered motor racing in the 1930s, with live broadcasts from the Lobethal Circuit. In later years, football commentary, horse and greyhound racing were also major elements of 5DN's sports coverage.\n\nIn 1969, 5DN introduced Adelaide's first Open Line talkback programme, beginning the move to the News/Talk format that saw the station dominate the ratings in the 1970s and 80s. The pioneer of the format on 5DN was the Reverend Neil Adcock, on his daytime talkback show.\n\nJeremy Cordeaux joined the station in 1976 to host the daytime show, with Neil Adcock moving to a Sunday night spot. But for a long time 5DN's ratings record was held by late night Open Line host, Roger Mac. His ratings often exceeded the figures other stations recorded for their prime time programs.\n\nIn 1983/84 5DN scratched the races and broadcasts were moved to Beautiful Music station FIVEaa which had been bought by the TAB for this purpose.\n\nLed by Paul Linkson as General Manager other broadcasters who featured on 5DN 972 from 1980 include Leigh Hatcher, Vincent Smith, Murray Nicoll, Gary Rivett, Kevin Crease, Ken Dickin, Judith Barr, Ken Cunningham, Gary Bau, David Hookes, Trevor Ford, Bob Byrne, Noel Yeates, Geoff Jay, Alex Zastera, Gerard Stone, Dave Waterman, Joan Hanger, Ray Fewings, Andrew Pearce, Chris Glenn, Dom Rinaldo, Murray \"Buzzard\" Olds, Terry Clark, Nan Witcomb and Jeff Medwell. Australia Overnight emanated from 2GB in Sydney and was hosted by Owen Delaney (M-F) and Les Solomon at weekends.\n\nUntil the sale of the Macquarie Radio Network by Warwick Fairfax and the station's affiliation with 2UE, Macquarie National News – 2GB, 3AW, 4BH, 5DN and 6PR – was provided by Colin Tyrus (News Director), Murray Olds (News Director and later breakfast personality), Mark Smith (News Director), Kevin Donnellan, Verity Webb, Simon Francis, Graham Warburton, Neil Wiese, Tim Sauer, Jim Snedden, Eric Wisgard, Craig Middleton, Shaun Fewings, Shane Sody, Graham Cairns, Anne Fulwood, Amanda Bachmann, Michelle Weidenhofer, Alan Murrell, Heidi Koch and Narelle Hill.\n\nSport was provided by Kim Anderson and Jonathan Rivett.\n\n5DN's 972AM frequency is today utilised by ABC NewsRadio.\n\nIn 1990, 5DN moved to FM, and changed its on-air identity to Radio 102 FM. The high rating News/Talk/Sport format was dropped, staff were made redundant and the station changed to a Classic Hits music format managed and programmed by the same people who had overseen 5DN.\n\n'Radio 102FM – Sounds Like Adelaide to Me' was not a success in Adelaide. Poor ratings led the station change its position to compete with SAFM, the market dominator at the time. The station then changed to an adult rock format in early 1992 and adopted the on air identifier X102.\n\nX102 failed to derail the dominant SAFM and continued to operate at a financial loss. Later 1323 5AD became available for sale and was purchased by Montclair Investments. The owners of Montclair, which included former 5DN personality and First Radio Limited investor Jeremy Cordeaux and former 5DN Station Manager Sue Fraser, subsequently made an offer to the by now defeated owners of the 102.3 FM frequency. The transaction proceeded and 5AD was immediately simulcast on the FM frequency from December 1992. It proved to be an instant success in both ratings and advertising terms with the station continuing to simulcast on the AM frequency.\n\n5AD dominated the ratings during the simulcast period but was eventually instructed to end the simulcast by the regulatory authorities. This left the owners with a 'spare' commercial licence on the AM band but, as the 5AD brand name had moved to FM, the AM station was without an identity. So Radio 1323 was launched with a format featuring old 5DN personalities and a mixture of talk and Easy Listening music in July 1993.\n\nRadio 1323 was then subsequently rebranded as 5DN and returned to a mostly talk format but despite the name change it could and would never retain its former leadership position as South Australia's number one choice for news, talk and sport. Behind the scenes the station was literally a shell of its once proud former self with only a small number of people technically employed by 5DN with the remainder (management, news, technical, sales) employed by 5ADFM.\n\nFIVEaa and 891 ABC Adelaide became the dominant news/talk stations in Adelaide after 5DN converted to FM in 1990 and few listeners were convinced to return to 5DN on 5AD's old frequency.\n\nThe holding company for the two stations was later bought by the Australian Radio Network (ARN). However the reincarnation failed to recapture the glory days of the late 1970s and '80s and the Australian Radio Network closed it down in December 2004, leasing the licence to Melbourne based broadcaster SEN, the Sports and Entertainment Network.\n\nThe radio listener share of 1323 AM dropped from 6.7% in December 2004 to almost Nil in May 2005. SEN encountered financial difficulties, and relinquished control of the licence, handing it back to ARN. After regaining control, ARN began a simulcast of its FM station, now rebranded as Mix 102.3.\n\nIn November 2005 the AM frequency was again separated from the FM program and was rebranded as Cruise 1323, playing easy listening music. The first Adelaide ratings survey of 2006 gave Cruise 1323 8th place and a 5.2% share of the total audience. By the first survey of 2007, Cruise had moved to 6th place and 7.8% of the total audience overtaking the National youth station Triple J and commercial FM Rock station Triple M Adelaide. In March 2012 the station joined the Classic Hits Network alongside 101.7 WSFM Sydney, Gold 104.3 Melbourne and 4KQ Brisbane.\n\nAt September 2019 the Cruise 1323 Weekdays On-Air Line Up is:\n\n6am-10am John Dean\n\n10am-1pm Dom Rinaldo\n\n1pm-4pm Craig Huggins\n\n4pm-7pm Mark Elliston\n\n\n"}

The player assumes the role of Garrett as he unravels a conspiracy related to a new religious sect. Garrett takes on missions such as burglaries and frameups, while trying to avoid detection by guards and automated security.\n\n\"Thief II\" was designed to build on the foundation of its predecessor. In response to feedback from players of \"Thief\", the team placed a heavy focus on urban stealth in the sequel, and they minimized the use of monsters and maze-like levels. The game was made with the third iteration of the Dark Engine, which had been used previously to develop \"Thief\" and \"System Shock 2\". \"Thief II\" was announced at the 1999 Electronic Entertainment Expo, as part of an extended contract between Looking Glass and Eidos to release games in the \"Thief\" series. Looking Glass neared bankruptcy as the game was developed, and the company was kept running by advances from Eidos.\n\n\"Thief II\" received positive reviews from critics, and its initial sales were stronger than those of its predecessor.

The player seeks to complete mission objectives and to evade the notice of opponents such as guards. The player must minimize the visibility and audibility of the player character, Garrett, to escape detection. Players try to avoid lit areas and loud flooring in favor of shadows and quiet flooring. A light monitor on the heads-up display (HUD) indicates the player character's visibility. While it is possible for the player character to engage in direct combat, he is easily defeated.\n\nThe game's 15 missions take place in large levels that can be confronted in multiple ways. Guards may be knocked out with a blackjack or killed with a bow or sword, and their fallen bodies may be picked up and hidden. In addition to human enemies, the game features security automatons and surveillance cameras. While completing objectives such as frameups and blackmail, the player steals valuables that may be used to purchase thieving gear between missions. The player's main tools are specialized arrows, including water arrows to douse lights, moss arrows to dampen the player character's footsteps and rope arrows to reach higher ground.\n\n\"Thief II\" is designed to be played methodically, and the player plans ahead by scouting, reading the game's map and observing patrol patterns. The player character has a zooming mechanical eye, which connects to throwable \"Scouting Orb\" cameras. One Scouting Orb may be deployed at a time; when it lands, the player views the game world from its perspective until normal play is resumed. The player listens for noises, such as footsteps and humming, to determine the locations of enemies. On the highest of the game's three difficulty levels, killing humans results in a game over, and in certain missions the player must not knock out any guards.\nLike its predecessor \"\", \"Thief II\" is set in a steampunk metropolis called the City, whose appearance resembles that of both medieval and Victorian era cities. Magic and steam technology exist side by side, and three factions—the manipulative and enigmatic Keepers, the technology-focused Hammerites and the \"pagan\" worshippers of the Pan-like Trickster god—are in operation. \"Thief II\" takes place one year after the first game. In the aftermath of the Trickster's defeat and the failure of his plan to revert the world to a wild, primitive state, a schism in the Hammerite religion spawns the \"Mechanist\" sect, which fanatically values technological progress. The new inventions of the Mechanists are used by a resurgent police force to crack down on crime. The pagans are in disarray, and have been driven into the wilderness beyond the City. From there, they engage in guerrilla warfare against the Mechanists. The Keeper faction is dormant as the game begins.\n\nThe game continues the story of Garrett (voiced by Stephen Russell), the cynical master thief who defeated the Trickster. Pursuing Garrett is the new sheriff, Gorman Truart (voiced by Sam Babbitt), who has imposed a zero tolerance policy on crime. Viktoria (voiced by Terri Brosius), the former ally of the Trickster, eventually joins with Garrett to combat the Mechanists. The game's primary antagonist is the founder of the Mechanists, Father Karras (also voiced by Russell), a mentally unstable inventor who despises the natural world.\n\nThe game begins as Garrett continues his life as a thief. However, he is betrayed by his fence and ambushed after an early mission, and he determines that Truart, the local sheriff, is hunting him. Keepers take Garrett to hear a prophecy about the \"Metal Age\", which he ignores. As Garrett leaves, one of the Keepers informs him that Truart had been hired to kill him, and he gives Garrett a letter that directs him to eavesdrop on a Mechanist meeting. There, Garrett overhears Truart and Father Karras discussing the conversion of street people into mindless \"Servants\", who wear masks that emit a red vapor capable of reducing themselves and nearby humans to rust. Truart promises to provide Karras with twenty victims for the Servant project, not realizing that Karras is recording his words for use in blackmail. Garrett steals the recording from a safe deposit box, in order to coerce Truart into revealing his employer.\n\nHowever, Garrett finds Truart murdered at his estate. Evidence at the crime scene leads him to spy on the police officer Lt. Mosley. Garrett sees Mosley deliver a suspicious letter, which is carried through a portal by a wounded pagan. Garrett enters the portal and finds himself outside the City, and he follows the pagan's trail of blood to Viktoria, who persuades Garrett to join her against the Mechanists. On a lead from Viktoria, he infiltrates Karras' office to learn about the \"Cetus Project\", and inadvertently discovers that Karras is giving Servants to the City's nobles. Garrett travels to a Mechanist base to find out more about the Cetus Project, which is revealed to be a submarine. In order to locate and kidnap a high-ranking Mechanist named Brother Cavador, Garrett stows away in the vehicle.\n\nAfter delivering Cavador to Viktoria, Garrett steals a Servant mask to learn about a Mechanist technology called a \"Cultivator\". Meanwhile, Karras hides inside the Mechanist cathedral in preparation for his plan. Garrett and Viktoria learn that it is the Cultivators inside Servant masks which emit red vapor, or \"rust gas\". Karras had provided Servants to nobles with gardens in order to set off an apocalyptic chain reaction. Viktoria plans to lure the Servants into the hermetically sealed Mechanist cathedral before Karras activates their masks, but Garrett believes this to be too dangerous and leaves. Viktoria goes to the cathedral alone and dies while filling it with plants, and Garrett completes her plan, killing Karras in the rust gas. Afterward, Garrett is approached by a Keeper who explains that Karras' scheme and Viktoria's death had been prophesied. Garrett demands to know the rest of the Keepers' prophecies as the game ends.\n\nLooking Glass Studios began designing \"Thief II\" in January 1999. The team's goal was to build on the foundation of \"Thief: The Dark Project\", a game that \"Thief II\" project director Steve Pearsall later said was an experiment. He explained that the team had played it safe by including certain \"exploration ... or adventure oriented\" missions with \"jumping and climbing puzzles\" in \"Thief\", and that the new game was significantly more focused on stealth. Combat was given less prominence than in the original. Based on feedback from players and reviewers of \"Thief\", the team decided to scale back the use of maze-like levels and monsters such as zombies in favor of urban environments and human enemies. Pearsall stated that \"Thief\"s monsters were negatively received because, unlike the game's human enemies, they did not clearly indicate when they noticed the player. The team sought to remedy this problem by improving the audio cues given by non-human enemies in the sequel.\n\nProduction of \"Thief II\" commenced in February. Looking Glass chose to compose the game's team of \"half the original designers and half new blood\", according to executive producer James Poole. The company tried to select people who meshed well both personally and creatively, in an attempt to guarantee a smooth development cycle. Adrenaline Vault editor-in-chief Emil Pagliarulo was hired as a junior designer, in part because of his positive review of \"Thief\". Rich \"zdim\" Carlson and Iikka Keränen joined from Ion Storm's \"Daikatana\" team, and Looking Glass contractor Terri Brosius was hired as a full-time designer. One-third of the team was female, which Pearsall believed contributed to a strong group dynamic. As was typical at Looking Glass, the \"Thief II\" team worked in a wall-less space called a \"pit\", which allowed them to converse easily. Describing the work environment at the time, writer Laura Baldwin noted that \"conversations dash madly about the room, [and] when someone is demonstrating something interesting everyone gravitates over to look.\"\n\nDuring the first months of development, the team regularly gathered to watch films pertinent to Garrett's character and to the game's visual design, such as \"The Third Man\", \"The Castle of Cagliostro\", \"M\" and \"Metropolis\". Pearsall said that the latter two films were \"Thief II\"s \"biggest aesthetic influences\", while the main inspiration for its plot was Umberto Eco's novel \"The Name of the Rose\". The team also drew influence from Fritz Leiber's \"Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser\". The game's story was written in the three-act structure: Garrett was intended to transition from his \"cynical self\" in the first act to a private investigator in the second, and to a character similar to James Bond in the third. The City's technology and architecture were influenced by the appearance of Victorian London, and certain areas were given an Art Deco theme to provide \"sort of a \"Batman\" feel\", in reference to the 1989 film. Lead artist Mark Lizotte captured over two-thousand photographs during his vacation in Europe, and these were the basis for many of the game's textures.\n\n\"Thief II\" was built with the third iteration of the Dark Engine, which had been used previously for \"Thief\" and \"System Shock 2\". According to Pearsall, the Dark Engine had become \"a very well understood development environment\", which made for an easier production process. Engine updates created for \"System Shock 2\", such as support for 16-bit color, were carried over to \"Thief II\". The average character model in \"Thief II\" was given close to double the polygons of the average model in \"Thief\", with much of the added detail focused on characters' heads. This was an attempt to give the characters a \"more organic\" look. Certain artificial intelligence (AI) routines written into the Dark Engine, which allowed enemies to notice changes in the environment such as open doors, had not been used in \"Thief\" or in \"System Shock 2 \"but were implemented in \"Thief II\". Weather effects such as fog and rain were added, and technology from \"Flight Unlimited III\" was used to generate the sky and clouds.\n\n\"Thief II\" was announced during the Electronic Entertainment Expo on May 13, 1999, as part of a contract between Looking Glass and Eidos Interactive to release four new games in the \"Thief\" series, beginning with \"Thief Gold\". The deal had been signed on May 7, roughly three months after \"Thief II\" entered production. A tech demo of the game, which Bruce Geryk of Games Domain described as \"about three rooms with some Mages\", was displayed on the show floor. The demo was used to showcase the updated Dark Engine, which featured support for colored lighting, higher polygon models and larger environments. The team revealed their intention to include more levels with human enemies, and announced a projected release date of spring 2000. Plans to include a cooperative multiplayer mode were also detailed at the show. IGN's Jason Bates noted that the \"Thief II\" display attracted \"a bit of a buzz and a small crowd of dedicated onlookers\".\n\nBy July, the team had begun initial construction of the game's levels. \"Thief II\"s increased focus on stealth necessitated new level design concepts: the most stealth-based missions in \"Thief\" had centered on urban burglary, but Pearsall explained that this \"would get tired pretty fast\" if repeated in every level. The team diversified \"Thief II\" by designing missions with such objectives as kidnapping, blackmail and eavesdropping. The first two levels were designed to seamlessly introduce new players to the core game mechanics, without a tutorial mission that might lose the interest of experienced players. When creating a mission, the team would often begin by deciding on the player's objective, after which they would produce a rough level design. The mission would then undergo a peer review to determine if it should be added to the game. Each of the game's levels was a team effort rather than the work of a single designer. Designer Randy Smith explained that, while \"Thief\"s levels had been designed to fit a pre-existing story, the \"Thief II\" team \"tried to think of really good missions first\" and then adjusted the plot to suit them. He noted that it was highly difficult to harmonize the two.\n\nThe game's sound team was composed of Kemal Amarasingham, Damin Djawadi and audio director Eric Brosius. According to Brosius, each member of the audio department did \"everything\", without clear demarcations between roles. Like \"Thief\", \"Thief II\" features a sound engine that simulates propagation in real-time. To achieve this effect, each level's geometry was input both to the level editor and to a \"separate [sound] database\", which mapped how sound would realistically propagate based on \"the physical room characteristics [... and] how all the different rooms and areas are connected together\". For example, noise travels freely through an open door but is blocked when the door is closed. The team used the new \"occlusion\" feature in EAX 2.0 to make \"Thief II\"s sound environment more realistic and to allow the player to listen through doors. The game features more sound effects, music and speech than the original \"Thief\". \"Thief II\"s score, as with that of its predecessor, was designed to \"blur ambient [sound] and music\" together. However, Brosius later stated that, while \"Thief\"s soundtrack is composed of \"simple and hypnotic\" loops only a few seconds in length, \"Thief II\" features longer and \"more thoughtfully\" constructed pieces. He believed that this method had positive aspects, but that it resulted in a less immersive audio environment.\n\nArtist Dan Thron returned to create the game's cutscenes, with assistance from Jennifer Hrabota-Lesser. Thron later called Hrabota-Lesser \"one of the greatest artists I've ever seen\". The cutscenes, which \"Computer Games Magazine\" called \"unique\", feature multiple layers of artwork and footage of live actors filmed against a green screen. These components were combined and animated in Adobe After Effects. The technique had been developed for the original \"Thief\", as an evolution of designer Ken Levine's suggestion to use motion comic cutscenes. David Lynch's films \"Eraserhead\" and \"The Elephant Man\" were important influences on their style.\n\nBy October 1999, the team had cut the game's multiplayer feature. Pearsall explained that Looking Glass did not \"have the resources to do a new kind of multiplayer and ship a finely tuned single-player game\". Plans were announced in January 2000 to release a multiplayer-only \"Thief\" game shortly after the completion of \"Thief II\". As \"Thief II\"s development continued, Looking Glass experienced extreme financial troubles. The company's Marc LeBlanc later said that \"Eidos was writing a check every week to cover our burn rate\" during the last months of the project. The game's final cost was roughly $2.5 million. According to company head Paul Neurath, Eidos informed Looking Glass that \"it was not an option\" for \"Thief II\" to miss its release date, and that there would be \"dire consequences if [we] missed by even a day\". An anonymous Looking Glass staffer later told Salon.com that Eidos \"told us basically to ship [\"Thief II\"] by their fiscal quarter or die\".\n\nBy January, Pearsall confirmed that the game had reached beta, and that most of the team's energy was being spent \"tuning, polishing, and fixing bugs\". He noted in early February that \"Thief II\" had been produced almost entirely on schedule. The company slipped behind near the end of the project and entered crunch time to make up the loss. On February 24, \"Thief II\" producer Michael McHale announced that the game had reached \"feature freeze\", and that the team was in \"super crunch mode\". Numerous game testers from Eidos joined the project. However, McHale said that the team was energized and that \"spirits [were] high\". Certain employees slept in the office and avoided bathing so that the game could reach its March deadline. LeBlanc later stated his belief that the game was rushed, and that its quality suffered as a result. Nevertheless, the team met their goal, and the game was released on March 23, 2000. Eidos expedited the company's payment for completing the game.\n\n\"Thief 2\" debuted high on the bestsellers list for computer games, and its initial sales were better than those of its commercially successful predecessor. By November 2000, its global sales had surpassed 220,000 copies; \"PC Zone\" described these figures as \"commercial acclaim.\" The United States alone accounted for 67,084 sales by the end of 2000, which drew in revenues of $2.37 million. The game later received a \"Silver\" sales award by the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom. \"Thief II\" also received positive reviews from critics, with an aggregate score of 87/100 on Metacritic and 89% on GameRankings.\n\n\"Computer Gaming World\"s Thomas L. McDonald wrote that \"everything in \"Thief II\" is bigger, sharper, better, and more effective\" than in its predecessor. He enjoyed its story and called its levels \"vast and intricate\", with \"astonishingly complex and often beautiful\" architecture; but he found the game's graphics to be somewhat lackluster. McDonald summarized \"Thief II\" as a unique \"gamer's game\". Jim Preston of \"PC Gamer US\" considered the game to be \"more focused and polished than the original\", and he praised the removal of \"zombie battles\". While he faulted its graphics, he summarized it as \"one hell of a good game\".\n\nJasen Torres of \"GameFan\" wrote, \"If you liked \"Thief\", you'll love \"Thief 2: The Metal Age\"; it's more of the stuff that made \"Thief\" great, with less of the annoying stuff\". He applauded the removal of \"zombie killer\" missions and believed the game's sound to be \"superior to any other game\". He considered its story to be \"good\" but \"nothing great\" and its graphics to be \"decent\"; but he commented that the game was \"really all about the gameplay\", which he praised as \"quite compelling and fun\". Benjamin E. Sones of \"Computer Games Magazine\" considered the game's story to be \"quite good\", but he faulted Looking Glass for failing to detail the events of the first game for new players. He wrote that \"Thief II\"s graphics were passable but that its sound design was \"phenomenal\". Sones praised its missions as \"very well crafted\", and noted that they gave the impression of being in \"a living, breathing world.\" He summarized, \"It may not be perfect, but \"Thief 2\" has got it where it counts\".\n\nCharles Harold of \"The New York Times\" called the game a \"refreshing alternative to games that glorify violence\". He found its story to be \"slight\", but he lauded its world as \"amazingly alive\" and its AI as a \"remarkable impersonation of real intelligence\". Writing for \"GamePro\", Barry Brenesal commented that \"Thief II\" \"provides a solid gaming experience\" but \"doesn't startle like its predecessor\". He wrote that its missions featured a \"great deal of variety\", and he praised their \"ability to casually suggest a much larger world\", but he complained that they were linear. He considered the game's writing to be \"among the best in the business\". While Brenesal enjoyed the game's textures and lighting, he noted the low detail of the game's human models, whose animations he found to be \"arthritic\". \"PC Zone\"s Paul Presley wrote that the game's levels were larger but easier than those of \"Thief\", and he considered their objectives to be somewhat linear. He found \"Thief II\"s graphics to be dated and wrote that its lack of real-time lighting \"tends to give each environment a sort of 'false' quality\". However, he believed that the game \"still has enough atmosphere to immerse you\", and he praised its sound design. Presley considered the game to be a straightforward rehash of its predecessor, and he finished, \"A more clear-cut case of sequel-itis there has never been.\"\n\nJim Preston reviewed the PC version of the game for \"Next Generation\", rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \"Great, skulking gameplay, useful new tools, and clever level design make \"Thief II\" an excellent first-person 'sneaker.'\"\n\nWhile \"Thief II\" performed well commercially, Looking Glass was not set to receive royalties for several months. The company had struggled financially since the commercial failures of its self-published games \"\" and \"British Open Championship Golf\". Looking Glass's \"Flight Unlimited III\" had flopped at retail, and the development of \"Jane's Attack Squadron\" had gone over budget and fallen behind schedule. A deal to co-develop the stealth game \"Deep Cover\" with Irrational Games had recently collapsed. According to Looking Glass's Tim Stellmach, the delay in \"Thief II\" royalties \"faced [us] with the prospect of running out of money.\" Looking Glass management signed a deal in which Eidos Interactive would acquire the company, but Eidos fell into a sudden financial crisis, in part because of the failure of Ion Storm's $40 million game \"Daikatana\". These factors led to the closure of Looking Glass on May 24, 2000, with the planned \"Thief II\" successors \"Thief II Gold\" and \"Thief III\" cancelled.\n\nThe \"Thief\" series had been planned as a trilogy, and work on \"Thief III\" was \"in a fairly advanced stage\" when Looking Glass closed, according to \"PC Zone\"s Keith Pullin. Randy Smith and Terri Brosius were appointed as lead designers, and they developed the game's concept over several months. In an open letter published after the company's bankruptcy, Smith wrote that the third game would have taken place in an \"open-ended, self-directed city\", and that its plot would have centered on the Keepers. Brosius suggested that \"Thief III\" would have seen Garrett \"accept[ing] that there are consequences to his actions\", and that he would likely have become \"ready to give, rather than always take.\" The player would have uncovered the game's story gradually, while exploring a free-roam environment. Serious plans had been made to include co-operative multiplayer, and a new engine, Siege, had been in production. When Looking Glass closed, its assets were liquidated and the \"Thief\" intellectual property was sold at auction. This raised doubts that the \"Thief\" trilogy would be completed, a situation that Salon.com writer Wagner James Au compared to Lucasfilm closing after the release of \"The Empire Strikes Back\". However, following rumors, Eidos announced on August 9, 2000 that it had purchased the rights to \"Thief\".\n\nDevelopment of \"Thief III\" was delegated to the Warren Spector-supervised Ion Storm, which had recently completed \"Deus Ex\". According to Spector, \"Thief III\" would have been given to Core Design or Crystal Dynamics had he not accepted it. The game was announced for Windows and the PlayStation 2. On August 10, Spector commented that Ion Storm's first goal was to assemble a core team, composed in part of former Looking Glass employees, to design and plot the game. \"Thief II\" team members Randy Smith, Lulu Lamer, Emil Pagliarulo and Terri Brosius were hired to begin the project. On August 16, Ion Storm announced its hires, and stated that concept work on \"Thief III\" would begin in September. The team planned to \"wrap up [the] loose ends\" of the series, and they built directly upon the \"Thief III\" concept work done at Looking Glass. \"Thief III\" was eventually renamed \"\", and it was released for Windows and the Xbox on May 25, 2004.\n\nIn May 2009, after several months of rumors, a fourth game in the \"Thief\" series was announced by \"\" developer Eidos Montréal. It was unveiled in the April 2013 issue of \"Game Informer\". The game, entitled \"Thief\", is a reboot of the \"Thief\" series; and it does not feature the Hammerites, pagans or Keepers. Its plot follows Garrett (voiced by Romano Orzari in place of Stephen Russell) in the aftermath of an accident that leaves his protégé, Erin, missing. Garrett has amnesia after this incident, and the City is beset by a plague called the Gloom. The game was released for Windows and the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Xbox One and PlayStation 4 in February 2014.\n\nSoon after the bankruptcy of Looking Glass, a fan group called the Dark Engineering Guild began developing an expansion mod to \"Thief II\", entitled \"Thief 2X: Shadows of the Metal Age\". Initially, they hoped to fill the void left by the cancellation of \"Thief III\", but they continued to work on the mod after the announcement and release of \"Thief: Deadly Shadows\". Released in 2005 after five years in development, the mod follows Zaya, a young woman who is robbed while visiting the City and who then seeks revenge. She is mentored by a pagan hermit named Malak, who trains her as a thief but who has ulterior motives. The team designed Zaya to be physically capable and to have a \"middle-eastern/north-african look\", but made an effort to avoid similarities to Mulan. Chronologically, the story starts near the end of \"Thief\" and ends in the middle of \"Thief II\", thereby depicting the rise of Gorman Truart and the early days of the Mechanists. \"Thief 2X\" features 13 missions, with new animated cutscenes and roughly 3,000 new lines of recorded dialogue.\n\nThe mod was praised by critics and by the \"Thief\" fan community. Brett Todd of \"PC Gamer US\" awarded it \"Mod of the Month\" and wrote: \"It doesn't quite have the mysterious allure of the original games, but it's awfully close\". A writer for Jolt Online Gaming praised the mod's visuals and considered its missions to be \"incredibly well designed\". While the writer commented that \"Thief 2X\" did not perfectly follow the series' tone and that its voice acting was \"not the best\", they finished by saying that fans of the \"Thief\" series had \"no excuse not to play \"T2X\"\". \"PC Gamer UK\"s Kieron Gillen wrote that he had expected the mod to be cancelled, given that the \"web is full of [...] five-percent finished masterworks from people who aimed far, far too high\". After \"Thief 2X\"s release, he lauded it as the best \"Thief\" fan work and as \"one of the most impressive achievements of any fan community for any game\".\n\n"}

{"id": "2204797", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2204797", "title": "College of Saint Rose", "text": "College of Saint Rose\n\nThe College of Saint Rose is a private college in Albany, New York. It was founded in 1920 by the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet and is sponsored by the Sisters of St. Joseph. \n\nThe college is broadly divided into four schools: the School of Arts and Humanities (which includes the Music, Art, and Communications Departments), the School of Mathematics and Sciences, the Huether School of Business, and the Thelma P. Lally School of Education. These schools offer a combined total of over 100 degrees at the certificate, undergraduate, and graduate levels.\n\nThe idea for The College of Saint Rose was conceived by Monsignor Joseph A. Delaney, the vicar general of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Albany in 1920. He aimed to create a Catholic college for women in the area between the two nearest Catholic colleges in New York City and Buffalo. With this in mind, Delaney contacted Sr. Blanche Rooney, a member of the local chapter of the Sisters of Saint Joseph of Carondelet, located in the Provincial House on Eighth Street in Troy, New York. Rooney and her sisters were receptive to the idea and, with the permission and support of Bishop of Albany Edmund F. Gibbons and Sr. Rooney, Monsignor Delaney purchased the William Keeler estate at 979 Madison Avenue. Upon granting of a provisional charter from the Board of Regents, The College of Saint Rose was established as a college for women with a liberal arts curriculum in Albany, New York on June 28, 1920.\n\nIts founders selected the name of Saint Rose to honor the first canonized saint in the Americas, Saint Rose of Lima. Initially, emphasis was placed on the professional training of teachers, but it quickly expanded to include preparation for business and other professions.\n\nAs needs in the Albany area increased, the college expanded and revised its programs to meet those needs. An evening division was developed in 1946 to serve World War II veterans and was re-instituted in 1974 to respond to continuing education needs. In 1949, a graduate school was added to provide master's degree programs.\n\nMen were admitted to both the original evening and graduate divisions, and in 1969 the college became fully co-educational. Housing for men became available in the 1970s.\n\nIn 1970, the board of trustees was expanded to nineteen members, adding ten laypersons in addition to the president and eight Sisters of Saint Joseph. With the transfer of control to this board, The College of Saint Rose became an independent college sponsored by the Sisters of Saint Joseph of Carondelet.\n\nIn December 2015, the college announced plans to eliminate 27 academic programs and 23 faculty positions. The School of Arts and Humanities and the School of Education were hit the hardest, with undergraduate programs like art education and religious studies and graduate programs like history/political science and educational technology being cut from the college. The eliminated programs enrolled just four percent of the student body and 12 programs enrolled none. The move allowed the college to invest in its more popular programs like accounting, communication sciences, music, computer science, criminal justice and forensics, among others. Although the college described the cuts as a necessity to ensure the college's future viability and a \"reprioritization of academic programs to meet the changing needs of students, increase enrollment and secure the college’s financial future,\" faculty protested the plan. Two months later, the faculty passed a \"no confidence\" motion in regard to college President Carolyn J. Stefanco, who remained in her post.\nAn investigatory committee of the American Association of University Professors concluded that the layoffs \"violated shared governance and undermined tenure and academic freedom\" and that they \"violated the association’s principles and standards\".\n\nThe main campus of The College of Saint Rose is located in the Pine Hills neighborhood of Albany, the capital city of New York. The 46-acre campus is bounded by Western Avenue to the north, Partridge Street to the east, Morris Street to the south, and Main Avenue to the west, although there is college property north of Western and east of Partridge. Because of the College's urban location all new expansion of the main Pine Hills campus' footprint occurs either through acquisition of existing structures or demolition and construction of new structures. Over the years the College has gradually acquired many of the Victorian-era homes adjacent to the main campus. Many of these structures, most of which are located on Partridge Street and Western and Madison avenues, have been converted into offices and student housing. The slow expansion of the College into the surrounding neighborhood has occasionally led to conflict with local neighborhood and historic conservation associations. Some of this conflict is due to the College's status as a not-for-profit organization in New York State which, as such, is exempt from paying property taxes in the city of Albany.\n\nThe first college building was 979 Madison Avenue, a large Victorian-era house that was acquired by the College in 1920 and served as the only College building during the 1920–1921 academic year. The house was known as Saint Rose Hall up until 1970, when the name was changed to Moran Hall in honor of Sister John Joseph Moran. The building is currently occupied by the Alumni Relations office and faculty offices of the History and Political Science Department.\n\nAlbertus Hall, at 432 Western Avenue, is one of the major academic facilities on the campus, housing many of the classes during the academic year. The brick, steel and stone building was designed by Frank J. Morgan with the aim of creating classroom, laboratory and administrative space for the College. Construction of the building commenced in 1932 and finished in 1933. Renovations in 2006 gave the building its current interior and also added seven new classrooms among other changes. It is connected to the Science Center (993 Madison Avenue) through shared hallways.\n\nSt. Joseph Hall is a four-story English brick building with limestone trim fronted by six Corinthian columns. It is located at 985 Madison Avenue between the Science Center to the west and Moran Hall to the east. The structure was built in 1922 at a cost of half a million dollars due to a need for classroom and dining space to house the growing student body. As the first academic building constructed specifically for the College, St. Joseph Hall originally included an auditorium, classrooms, chapel, dormitory, a dining area and kitchens in the basement. \n\nThe primary social, dining and restaurant center on the Saint Rose campus is the Events and Athletics Center (EAC), located at 420 Western Avenue. The eastern side of the EAC houses athletic facilities including the Daniel P. Nolan Gymnasium, the Robert Bellizzi Fitness Center, locker rooms, and a four lane swimming pool. The western side contains social and dining facilities such as the Main Dining Room, the Camelot Room, a Starbucks, the Commuter Lounge, the Campus Book Store, the Mail Room and Copy Center, as well as the Offices of Student Affairs, Physical Education, Athletics, Dining Services, the Student Association (SA), and the Student Events Board (SEB).\n\nThe Massry Center for the Arts features the Kathleen McManus Picotte Recital Hall, the Esther Massry Gallery, and the William Randolph Hearst Music Wing. This building serves as the primary venue for concerts and exhibitions by the College’s students and faculty, and a performance and exhibition space for artists, musicians, vocalists and orchestras. The Massry Center is one of the college's most recent and major attempts at building green. Some of the green features of the Massry Center are:\n\n\nThe Massry Center has received a LEED gold award being titled one of the most energy-efficient buildings in the Capital Region.\n\nThe school's Christian Plumeri Sports Complex was constructed at a cost of $4.7 million which included a $1 million challenge contribution from Joe Plumeri, Chairman and CEO of Willis Group Holdings and the college's 2006 commencement speaker. The complex was named in honor of Plumeri's deceased son.\nLocated at the complex, Bellizzi Field was named in honor of former coach Bob Bellizzi.\n\nThe College's Art and Design program is almost entirely housed in Picotte Hall. Picotte Hall is located at 324 State Street in downtown Albany and, as such, is one of the few buildings owned by the College that are not adjacent to the main campus. The interior of Picotte Hall contains facilities supporting the College's programs in printmaking, sculpture, painting, photography, and graphic design. There are also several general use classrooms. The building was donated by Kathleen McManus Picotte ('34) in 1976 and her husband, Bernard Picotte.\n\nSaint Rose is a not-for-profit organization governed by a 36-member Board of Trustees, the Chair of which is Daniel P. Nolan. Per the College By-Laws the Board is composed of two-thirds laypersons, and one third Sisters of Saint Joseph. There are presently eleven Sisters on the Board. Many current and former trustees are or have been notable local business-people, including present members George Randolph Hearst III, vice-president of the \"Times Union\" newspaper in Albany, NY, and Norman Massry, Secretary of the Board of Trustees and owner of TriCity Rentals, a rental agency focused on high-end apartments in and around the Albany, Buffalo, and Rochester areas. Dr. Carolyn J. Stefanco became the eleventh College president on July 1, 2014.\n\nThe academic program at the College of Saint Rose consists of four schools: the School of Arts and Humanities (which includes the Music, Art, and Communications Departments), the School of Mathematics and Sciences, the School of Business, and the School of Education. The College operates on a semester schedule. The College offers bachelor's degrees, post-bachelor's certificates, master's degrees, and post-masters's certificates. There are 66 bachelor's degree programs offered at Saint Rose, 45 master's degrees, and 12 graduate certificates.\n\nThe College of Saint Rose is a Division II member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), offering 18 varsity intercollegiate sports at the NCAA Division II level. Shortly before 2000, Saint Rose became a member of the Northeast-10 Conference (NE-10). The school's primary colors are white and gold, but black and gold are used for marketing purposes. The school's NCAA Division II sports teams are referred to as the Golden Knights. This led to controversy when the Vegas Golden Knights joined the National Hockey League in 2017, when the College of Saint Rose raised objections that led to Vegas's trademark application being initially denied, though it was later approved on appeal.\n\nIn 2009, Saint Rose women's soccer became the third team in Northeast-10 Conference history (1985) to win three consecutive postseason league titles. The team's season record was 24–1, and it was ranked fourth in the United States at season's end.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2204806", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2204806", "title": "Wayside Chapel", "text": "Wayside Chapel\n\nThe Wayside Chapel is a charity and Parish Mission of the Uniting Church in Australia in the Potts Point area of Sydney. Situated near Sydney's most prominent red-light district in Kings Cross, the Wayside Chapel offers programs and services which attempt to ensure access to health, welfare, social and recreation services. The centre assists homeless people and others on the margins of society.\n\nThe Wayside Chapel's mission is described as 'creating a community with no 'us' and 'them'. Their motto, developed during the leadership of Rev Graham Long is that of 'Love Over Hate'.\n\nRev. Graham Long described The Wayside Chapel's approach in a 2014 interview as not having \"any interest at all in solving problems\". Rather, The Wayside Chapel characterises its approach in the following way:\"I don’t want you to be a problem that I have to fix. I want you to be a person that I can meet. And I think if we meet you’ll change and so will I. You’ll move towards health and so will I. That’s how it works.\"\n\nThe Wayside Chapel was established in the Kings Cross area of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia in 1964. Ted Noffs was the founder of the Wayside Chapel, which was at the time a Methodist ministry (Uniting Church from 1977). At that time, it was only a single room with a dozen chairs in a block of flats at 29 Hughes Street, Potts Point. Within twelve months of his arrival, Noffs had transformed it into a chapel, coffee shop drop-in and community resource centre. The expectations of the church hierarchy—that Noffs's experiment would fail and become obscure and irrelevant—were not realised.\n\nThe centre grew until it occupied the entire building at No. 29. Later it grew still further and occupied the block of flats adjacent to the first block. A crisis centre was established in 1971 to handle crises which might arise at any time of day or night, including drug overdoses and possible suicides. More conventional church activities such as weddings were also carried out and the Wayside Chapel became one of the most popular wedding venues in Sydney, along with St Mark's at Darling Point.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Pastor Ray Richmond and others established a \"Tolerance Room\", where people who inject drugs were able to do so in a supervised environment, as an act of civil disobedience. This eventually led to the creation of the legal Medically Supervised Injecting Centre in Kings Cross.\n\nFrom 2004-2017 the Pastor of Wayside Chapel was Graham Long.\n\nThe current Pastor and CEO of Wayside Chapel is Jon Owen, who has served in the position since July 2018.\n\nIn July 2009, the Wayside Chapel received a grant of $2 million from the state government for the purpose of rebuilding its physical facilities. An additional grant from the federal government for $3 million was received in late 2009. The balance of funds were raised by private donation. Graham Long said that rainwater had been penetrating the brick walls and causing bricks to fall out. Forty per cent of the existing buildings had already been condemned, but moves were afoot to start a renovation and rebuilding worth $7.5 million.\n\nOn Saturday 19 May 2012 Wayside held the Grand Opening of its newly redeveloped building, designed by Environa Studio. The product of an $8.2million investment, five years of fundraising and 22 months of construction. The purpose-built facility features a community service centre, café, dedicated program space for The Aboriginal Project and Day-to-Day Living (a program for\npeople with long-term mental health issues), community hall, offices and meeting spaces for groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous. The new building also includes a rooftop garden with over 50 varieties of vegetables, fruit, flowers and herbs, along with a bee hive, worm farm and compost.\n\nTed Noffs intended the Wayside Chapel to be a place where action came before preaching and engagement with the community was more important than going to church on Sunday. Successive ministers have endeavored to uphold this tradition. Noffs pioneered a number of far-reaching and innovative developments in social welfare at The Wayside Chapel:\n\nRaymond Richmond was responsible for:\n\nGraham Long attempted to develop the mission of 'creating community with no 'us and them'. Long described his approach as telling people they are not 'problems' to be solved but rather 'people' to be met. Under Long's leadership the following programs have been implemented:\n\n\n"}

Hellberg has worked with a variety of Swedish bands and artists in different genres, both as a permanent member and as guest or session member.\n\nHellbergs career started when his band Nymphet Noodlers was discovered and later produced by Ebbot from The Soundtrack of our Lives. Wayne Kramer of the MC5 once said that the Nymphet Noddlers was one of his favorite bands. Nymphet Noodlers broke up in 1996, but was reunited for a concert at Way out West August 2011. Former Nymphet colleagues Hederos and Hellberg recorded 8 cover songs meant to be a demo to get gigs in bars in 1996. Old friend Niclas Stenholm released the songs on the album M. Hederos M. Hellberg in 2000. Hederos & Hellberg turned out to be a totally unexpected success. Ryan Adams discovered the duo when he was playing his first concert in Gothenburg, and he brought them with him on a European tour as Hederos & Hellberg's second album, \"Together in the darkness\" was released in 2001. January 2003 they did a last performance in a sold out Gothenburg Concert House. After Dregen's departure from The Hellacopters Hellberg was drafted as a live member before Robert Dahlqvist joined as a full-time guitarist. Hellberg later worked with Hellacopters front man Nick Royale and Scott Morgan's soul band The Solution and guitarist Robert Dahlqvist solo effort Thunder Express. When the legendary Swedish progg band Nationalteatern reunited in the 1990s Hellberg was brought on board as their new vocalist. He also performed live with the band's former vocalist Totta Näslund as a backup due to Näslund's health problems. In 2000 the band Kanzeon was formed the band release a self-titled album in 2007 with a number of guest vocalists.

The term is more prevalent among Sephardi Jews, but it is also widely used by Ashkenazi Haredi Jews.\n\nIt is an Aramaic word used frequently in the Talmud, which means 'our master' (, \"\", 'our master'). Most often, as the translation indicates, it is given to rabbis who are considered influential teachers and leaders.\n\nThe most common use of the term is in reference to \"Maran Beth Yosef\", Yosef Karo. In fact, when used without further qualification, Maran usually refers to Karo. Amongst contemporary rabbis, Yosef Shalom Eliashiv and Ovadia Yosef are most closely associated with the honorific.\n\nIn contemporary parlance Maran is often attributed to Rabbis who serve as founding heads of a particular ideological/cultural movement. This use is usually limited to communication within that particular movement. For example, within their respective communities Elazar Shach (\"Maran HaRav Shach\") and Joel Teitelbaum often receive the title.\n\nAs with most honorifics, this title precedes the name: for example, one might say \"Maran Rabbi Ovadia Yosef\". Similarly to honorifics like doctor, it can also be used for direct addressing by itself when there is no ambiguity. When used with a name, it will almost always be followed by the (technically redundant) \"Rabbi\", as in the above example. It is never preceded by \"the\" in correct usage, though some journalists will make that mistake.\n\n"}
{"id": "2204816", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2204816", "title": "Octobass", "text": "Octobass\n\nThe octobass is an extremely large and rare bowed string instrument that was first built around 1850 in Paris by the French luthier Jean-Baptiste Vuillaume (1798–1875). It has three strings and is essentially a larger version of the double bass - the specimen in the collection of the Musée de la Musique in Paris measures in length, whereas a full-size double bass is generally approximately in length. \n\nBecause of the extreme fingerboard length and string thickness, the musician plays it using a system of levers and pedals. The levers serve to engage metal clamps that are positioned above the neck at specific positions. These clamps act as fretting devices when the performer presses the levers. It has never been produced on a large scale or used much by composers (though Hector Berlioz wrote favorably about the instrument and proposed its widespread adoption). \n\nThe only known work from the Nineteenth Century that specifically calls for the Octobass is Charles Gounod's Messe solennelle de Sainte-Cécile. In this work, the Octobass only appears in the \"Benedictus\" and the \"Agnus Dei.\" It typically plays one octave below the Double Bass. \n\nIn addition to the Paris instrument, octobasses exist in the collections of the Musical Instrument Museum in Phoenix, Arizona and the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. In October 2016, the Quebec company Canimex donated an octobass to the Montreal Symphony Orchestra, which is now the only orchestra in the world to own one. This instrument was made by the luthier Jean-Jacques Pagès of Mirecourt, France in 2010.\n\nAccording to Berlioz, the three open strings were tuned C, G, and C. This tuning gave it a low range one octave below the cello and equal to the modern double bass with low C extension. However, at the time when the octobass was invented, the double bass lacked this extension and could descend only to E or G. The mechanism enabled each string to chromatically cover the range of a perfect fifth and gave the instrument a high range to G. The instrument at the Musée de la Musique in Paris, which uses period-accurate gut strings, is tuned thus (though on at least some recordings the overall tuning is a half-step flat).\nThe instrument at the Musical Instrument Museum in Phoenix, which uses modern wound metal strings, is tuned C, G, D. This tuning gives it a low range two octaves below the cello and one octave below the modern double bass with low C extension. Berlioz specifically noted this tuning in his orchestration treatise, but considered it erroneous. As on the Paris instrument, the mechanism allows each string to cover a perfect fifth, giving it a high range to A. The fundamental frequencies of the lowest notes in this tuning lie below 20 Hz — the commonly-stated lower bound of human hearing range — but these notes are nevertheless audible due to the overtones they produce. (An organ's 32′ stop also exceeds the supposed 20 Hz limit.)\nThe Montreal Symphony Orchestra octobass uses gut strings, is tuned A, E, B and has a high range to F.\n\n"}

She is the only rhythmic gymnast who has competed in four Olympic finals.\n\nShe became the first Spanish gymnast in history to have competed in two Olympic finals, Atlanta and Sydney, and she is the only rhythmic gymnast to make the finals at four consecutive Olympic Games: Atlanta 1996, Sydney 2000, Athens 2004 and Beijing 2008\n\nShe also won the gold medal in the XVth Mediterranean Games Almería 2005 and she has been awarded many other national and international recognitions; among others, the gold medal in the Royal Order of Sports Merit in 2009, which is a Spanish civil Order of Merit intended to recognise yearly activities in the fields of sport and physical education.\n\nIn June 2001, the Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique announced that Almudena's \"body-apparatus relationship\" with the ball was approved by the Rhythmic Gymnastics Technical Committee. As the code describes the Cid Tostado element:\"Starting position: on one knee, leg forward, ball held with the foot. large roll of the ball on both legs. Originality 0.10 (§ 2.6.5.)\"After a career lasting 21 years, she retired from rhythmic gymnastics on 23 August 2008. Currently, she is working as a sports commentator for rhythmic gymnastics competitions. Since 2014, she has also been writing Olympia, a children’s collection of stories in which she talks about her sporting life.\n\nShe started practising rhythmic gymnastics at the age of 7. She first went to Arabatxo club and then to Beti Aurrera club in Vitoria, in which other important gymnasts such as Tania Lamarca and Estíbaliz Martínez were trained. Her coaches there were Aurora Fernández del Valle and Iratxe Aurrekoetxea. One of Almudena’s first sports references, as she named them because she doesn't like to call them idols, was the Russian gymnast Oxana Kostina.\n\nIn May 1994, at the age of 13, she took part in the first international competition, in which she received three medals (one gold medal and two bronze medals). In November of the same year, she was asked by Emilia Boneva to start being part of the Spanish national individual team in Madrid, where she trained an average of 8 hours a day in the gym Gimnasio Moscardó.\n\nAt the 1995 Spanish Individual Championships, Almudena took the lead at a national level for the first time. In June 1995 she got the 12th position at the Final European Cup in Telford (England).\n\nSince she started her sporting career, she has been awarded many recognitions, apart from the ones obtained at the Olympic Games.\n\nIn 1996, she went to her first Olympic Games in Atlanta, where she participated for the individual team, along with her colleague Alba Caride. She achieved the fifth position in the preliminary round and the ninth position in the semi-final. Finally, she got the ninth position in the Olympics final, being the youngest participant in the competition.\n\nDue to her good marks at the European Championship in Zaragoza, she was selected in order to represent Spain at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Again she got the ninth position.\n\nIn her home town, Vitoria, she met her former trainer Iratxe, who motivated Almudena’s sporting life. They both moved to Barcelona and started working again together.\n\nIn 2004, the Spanish Gymnastics Federation decided that Almudena Cid and Jennifer Colino had to compete against each other in order to choose who would represent Spain at the 2004 Athens Olympics. The competition was at a very high level - nearly at Olympic level - causing mental and physical weariness and increasing the risk of injury before the Olympic Games. After obtaining the best marks, Almudena went to the 2004 Athens Olympics.\nIn these Games she reached her third olympic final, something that no other rhythmic gymnastic had gotten until then. In the final, that took place on 29 August, she got the eighth position, along with the Olympic diploma. And she earned a trophy of Rio of Janeiro\n\nOnce again, Almudena was selected to represent Spain at 2008 Beijing Olympics, her fourth and last Olympic Games.\n\nOn 23 August 2008, she put an end to her sporting career. It coincided with the very last day of the Olympics finals in Beijing, in which she got the eighth position, along with the Olympic diploma. Her last exercise was with ribbon, accompanied by an adaptation of “Nessun dorma”, which is an aria by Giacomo Puccini. As a final gesture as a gymnast, she drew the shape of a heart on the mat and she kissed it.\n\nSome years later, Almudena explained in an interview about her retirement and legacy in the field of rhythmic gymnastics:“It was hard to decide when to retire, but I chose the moment that I wanted [...]. I’ve been trying for 8 years to avoid the idea that I was already too old to practise this sport. At the age of 28, I managed to show the world that I could be on top [...]. If it’s a sport in which judges evaluates also your facial expressions and how you use the apparatus, because people tend to think that rhythmic gymnastics only have to do with flexibility, but the apparatus is also very important. It’s an art and it is something that comes along with maturity [...]. I didn’t really get what it was about, and I therefore wondered: why do rhythmic gymnasts retire so soon? Because it is the society that retires you from it. I fought against all that.”\n\nIn 2007, Christian Gálvez met Cid in \"Pasapalabra\", they dated for three years and were married on 7 August 2010 in Torrelodones, Madrid, by the mayor of Móstoles.\n\n"}

It is owned and operated by the Yale New Haven Health System. YNHH includes the 168-bed Smilow Cancer Hospital at Yale New Haven, the 201-bed Yale New Haven Children's Hospital, and the 76-bed Yale New Haven Psychiatric Hospital, making it one of the largest hospitals in the world and the largest in Connecticut. It is the primary teaching hospital for Yale School of Medicine and Yale School of Nursing.\n\nThe hospital is a Magnet hospital and is accredited by the Joint Commission. It is also a Level I trauma center for adult and pediatric patients. It operates a pediatric critical care transport team including registered nurses, respiratory therapists, and physicians who transfer pediatric patients from smaller community hospitals to Yale New Haven Children's Hospital. YNHH is ranked as the 20th best hospital in the nation by \"U.S. News & World Report\".\n\nIn 2018, the hospital had more than 1,488,549 outpatient and emergency visits and 74,307 inpatient discharges. YNHH is the second largest employer in New Haven, Connecticut, with 13,306 employees.\n\nThe history of Yale New Haven Hospital extends back to 1826 when the General Hospital Society of Connecticut was chartered as the first hospital in Connecticut and the fourth voluntary hospital in the nation. The hospital rented temporary quarters and raised US$5,000 toward the purchase of land and construction. A new 13-bed hospital opened in 1833 on seven and a half acres of land bordered by Cedar Street and Howard, Davenport, and Congress avenues. The original building, called the State Hospital, was designed by prominent New Haven architect Ithiel Town and cost US$13,000. In 1862, the State Hospital was converted to a military hospital to care for Union soldiers during the American Civil War. The hospital was renamed to the Knight United States Army General Hospital in honor of Jonathan Knight, the president of the board of trustees. Some attending physicians moved with the civilian patients to temporary quarters on Whitney Avenue. After the Civil War, the hospital was turned over to the General Society of Connecticut in 1865. The hospital converted back to its original name of State Hospital. The Connecticut Training School, the third training school for nurses in the United States, was opened by the hospital in 1873. In 1884, the hospital's name was changed to New Haven Hospital to reflect the name that was widely being used by the residents of New Haven.\n\nYale School of Medicine and New Haven Hospital formalized their relationship in 1913. U.S. medical education, which had begun as a simple apprenticeship system, evolved to become a formal educational plan based on alliances between medical schools and hospitals. This was the start of what is now known as the Yale New Haven Medical Center. Their first motorized ambulance was purchased by New Haven Hospital in 1914.\n\nIn 1945, the hospital changed its name to Grace-New Haven Hospital after it affiliated itself with nearby Grace Hospital. On July 6, 1946, U.S. President George W. Bush was born at the hospital. In 1951, the New Haven Dispensary formally merged with Grace-New Haven Hospital. The New Haven Dispensary had opened in 1871 as the city's first outpatient clinic. In 1965, a more formal agreement with the Yale School of Medicine resulted in another name change to Yale–New Haven Hospital. 1993 saw the opening of the Yale New Haven Children's Hospital becoming the first full-service children's hospital in Connecticut, including the first children's emergency department. The Yale New Haven Psychiatric Hospital was opened in 2000, after the purchase of the Yale Psychiatric Institute.\n\nIn 2003, a scandal over the hospital's treatment of poor patients severely tarnished its image. In March 2003, \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported on the case of Quinton White, a retiree, whom the hospital had sued. It had seized his bank account and put a lien on his house because White was in arrears in paying off his late wife's cancer treatment. Subsequent reporting indicated that the hospital had a practice of aggressively suing poor patients despite its status as a tax-exempt charitable organization. Public protests ensued, and state attorney general Richard Blumenthal sued the hospital for keeping money that was intended to help poor patients.\n\nIn response, the hospital forgave the debt of tens of thousands of patients, replaced its executives, and changed its billing practices. It also established community outreach programs that helped YNHH win the 2017 American Hospital Association's Foster G. McGaw Prize for Excellence in Community Service.\n\nOn September 12, 2012, YNHH acquired the assets of the Hospital of Saint Raphael (HSR), making it a single hospital with two main campuses.\n\nThe main patient campus of Yale New Haven Hospital comprises four inpatient pavilions bounded by South Frontage Road, Park Street, Howard Avenue, and York Street. The East Pavilion, originally called the Memorial Unit, was opened in 1952 (designed by Douglas Orr). Originally 8 stories tall, it was expanded to ten floors in 1972. The South Pavilion was opened in 1982 and followed by the Yale New Haven Children's Hospital (West Pavilion) in 1993. In 2009, YNHH saw the opening of the Smilow Cancer Hospital (North Pavilion). All four pavilions are connected by a central atrium. In 2000, Yale New Haven Hospital acquired the nearby Yale Psychiatric Institute (designed by architect Frank Gehry in 1989) and opened Yale New Haven Psychiatric Hospital. In 2004, the Yale New Haven Shoreline Medical Center in Guilford, Connecticut, was opened. The New Haven Pavilion houses outpatient clinics, clinical laboratories, and administration, among other departments. Located across the street from the inpatient pavilions, it occupies land that the original hospital was built on in 1833. The New Haven Pavilion connects directly to facilities of the Yale School of Medicine. In 2012, Yale New Haven Hospital acquired the assets of Hospital of Saint Raphael, located on Chapel Street in New Haven, which established Yale New Haven Hospital Saint Raphael Campus.\n\nIn October 2009, Yale New Haven Hospital opened the 14-story Smilow Cancer Hospital at Yale New Haven. Smilow Cancer Hospital is affiliated with Yale Cancer Center, southern New England's only designated Comprehensive Cancer Center and one of 41 such centers in the United States. Smilow Cancer Hospital integrates all oncology patient services at the Hospital and Yale School of Medicine in one building specifically designed for the delivery of cancer care.\n\nWhile construction was scheduled to begin in September 2005, the project was delayed by disputes with unions and the city. On March 22, 2006, the unions and the hospital reached an agreement. Construction on the new Yale–New Haven Cancer Hospital started on May 18, 2006, with the demolition of the Grace Building and site preparation. Groundbreaking occurred on Wednesday, September 6, 2006.\n\nThe Cancer Center building was named Smilow Cancer Hospital in honor of Joel E. and Joan Smilow's large gift to the cancer hospital. Joel E. Smilow is an alumnus of Yale University class of '54 and the former chair, chief executive officer, and president of Playtex Products Inc. Smilow Cancer Hospital is connected to the other facilities via the atrium. \n\nThe project includes an adjacent six-story building at 55 Park Street. The building was designed by Barry Svigals of Svigals + Partners and Behnisch Architekten. The 55 Park building houses a large atrium connecting the main parking garage with the Smilow Cancer Hospital as well as clinical laboratories, the main hospital pharmacy, and other support functions for the hospital. The City of New Haven approved 55 Park on November 15, 2007.\n\n"}

A member of the famed Du Pont family, he graduated first in his class from West Point shortly after the beginning of the American Civil War and served in the U.S. Army, earning the Medal of Honor for his actions during the Battle of Cedar Creek in October 1864.\n\nAfter retiring from the Army in 1875, he was president of the Wilmington and Northern Railroad Company for 20 years, until 1899. An active member of the Republican Party, he was elected by the state legislature as a U.S. Senator from Delaware, serving most of two terms (June 13, 1906 to March 4, 1917).\n\nDu Pont was born July 30, 1838, at Eleutherian Mills, near Greenville, Delaware, son of Henry and Louisa Gerhard du Pont and grandson of Eleuthère Irénée du Pont, the founder of E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company and the family in the United States.\n\nHe attended the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, and graduated first in his class from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York in 1861, after the beginning of the American Civil War.\n\nDu Pont was commissioned a 2nd Lieutenant of Engineers upon his graduation from West Point on May 6, 1861. Soon after he was promoted to 1st Lieutenant in the 5th Regiment, U.S. Artillery with date of rank of May 14, 1861. He served as a light artillery officer in the Union Army during the war, initially assigned to the defenses of Washington and New York Harbor. From July 6, 1861 to March 24, 1864, he served as regimental adjutant (administrative officer) until he was promoted to captain. He subsequently became chief of artillery in the Army of West Virginia.\n\nDu Pont was part of General Philip Sheridan's army in the Shenandoah Valley of northern Virginia. He received the Medal of Honor for his handling of a retreat at the Battle of Cedar Creek, allowing Sheridan to win a victory in the battle. During the war, du Pont received two brevets (honorary promotions). The first was to the rank of major, dated September 19, 1864, for gallant service in the battles of Opequon and Fisher's Hill. The second brevet was to the rank of lieutenant colonel, dated October 19, 1864, for distinguished service at the Battle of Cedar Creek, Virginia.\n\nAfter the war, du Pont continued as a career officer until resigning on March 1, 1875. In the postwar years, he became a companion of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States (MOLLUS), an organization for former officers of the Union Army and their descendants. Assigned to the U.S. capital, du Pont was a member of the District of Columbia Commandery, assigned MOLLUS insignia number 10418.\n\nAt the age of 36, du Pont married Mary Pauline Foster in 1874. They had two children, Henry Francis du Pont and Louise Evelina du Pont. They lived on his estate, Winterthur, near Greenville, Delaware. The family were members of Christ Episcopal Church in Christiana Hundred.\n\nIn 1875 du Pont returned full-time to Delaware. Within a few years, he became president and general manager of the Wilmington & Northern Railroad Company, serving from 1879 until 1899. During that time, and for the remainder of his life, he also operated an experimental farm on his estate.

He is one of the Mahatmas who inspired the founding of the Theosophical Society and was engaged in a correspondence with two English Theosophists living in India, A. P. Sinnett and A. O. Hume. The correspondence was published in 1923 by A. Trevor Barker, in the book The Mahatma Letters to A. P. Sinnett.\n\nH. P. Blavatsky, originally described the existence of a spiritual master whom she considered her guru, and who went by, among other names, Morya. Blavatsky said that Morya and another master, Koot Hoomi, were her primary guides in establishing the Theosophical Society. Blavatsky also wrote that Masters Morya and Koot Hoomi belonged to a group of highly developed humans known to some as the Great White Brotherhood or the White Lodge (though this is not how they described themselves). Master Morya's personality has been depicted in some detail by various theosophical authors. A man \"living on the earth, but possessed of developed senses that laughed at time and space.\" On the other hand, author P. Jenkins challenges that there is little evidence that Blavatsky's Masters, including Morya, ever existed. Author K. Paul Johnson wrote that Blavatsky gave conflicting versions of her meeting with Morya and suggests Blavatsky fictionalized the story, basing it on her encounter with an Italian political activist. Blavatsky's published works have been praised by New York papers as exhibiting immense research, in referring to her book Isis Unveiled the New York Sun writes, \"the strange part of this is, as I and many others can testify as eye witnesses to the production of the book, that the writer had no library in which to make researches and possessed no notes of investigation or reading previously done. All was written straight out of hand. And yet it is full of references to books in the British Museum and other great libraries, and every reference is correct. Either, then, we have, as to that book [referring to Isis Unveiled], a woman who was capable of storing in her memory a mass of facts, dates, numbers, titles, and subjects such as no other human being ever was capable of, or her claim to help from unseen beings is just.\"\n\nAfter Blavatsky's death, theosophists and others continued claiming to have met Morya or to have received communications from him. William Quan Judge, the leader of the American Section of the Theosophical Society, stated privately that he had received letters from Morya and other Adepts. Annie Besant, head of the European Section and co-head of the Esoteric Section with Judge, made public statements supporting the genuineness of those letters; but she later accused Judge of falsifying them, asserting that her suspicions of him were confirmed by the visitation of a Mahatma, presumably Master Morya, to whom she was linked. The ensuing controversy led to the break-up of the Society in 1895, but leaders in the increasingly fragmented movement continued making claims about having received communications and visitations from the Masters connected with the cause. Theosophical writings offered vivid descriptions of Morya, his role in the Brotherhood, and his past lives.\n\nMorya's earliest notable claimed incarnation is recorded by Annie Besant and C.W. Leadbeater (from, the source states, their research into the \"akashic records\" at the Theosophical Society headquarters in Adyar (Tamil Nadu), India conducted in the summer of 1910) as having been the Emperor of Atlantis in 220,000 BC, ruling from his palace in the capital city, the \"City of the Golden Gates\".\n\nAccording to the Ascended Masters teachings, some of the later incarnations that Morya is said to have had include: Recent incarnation being with Osho along with K.H(Devaraj)\n\n\nStudents of Ascended Master Activities believe that Morya ascended in 1898, becoming an Ascended Master and Chohan of the First Ray, and that his spiritual retreat is located at Darjeeling, India.\n\n\nKoot Hoomi\n\n"}

He turned professional in 1973, showing a cultured pedaling style. But his powerful build meant he wasn’t a gifted climber. His 273 road victories puts him behind Eddy Merckx (525) and Rik Van Looy (379), but ahead of Rik Van Steenbergen (270) and Roger De Vlaeminck (255). He was also an accomplished track rider, riding up to six Six-Day races almost each winter throughout his career. He rode 35, 14 of which with René Pijnen, winning 15.\n\nA nephew, Moreno Moser, (born 25 December 1990) is an Italian professional racer, and Francesco's son Ignazio Moser enjoyed success at the junior and amateur levels before retiring at the age of 22.\n\nAfter finishing second in 1974 behind Roger De Vlaeminck and in 1976 behind Marc Demeyer of Belgium, Moser finally won Paris–Roubaix, his favorite race, three consecutive times. Moser had seven podium finishes in Paris–Roubaix; only De Vlaeminck, with nine, has more. In 1978, he beat De Vlaeminck and Jan Raas of the Netherlands; in 1979, he beat De Vlaeminck and Hennie Kuiper of the Netherlands; and in 1980, he beat Gilbert Duclos-Lassalle of France and the German, Dietrich Thurau. Moser came in third in 1981 behind Bernard Hinault and Roger De Vlaeminck, and was also third in 1983 behind Hennie Kuiper and Gilbert Duclos-Lassalle. He rode Paris–Roubaix in his final season as a cyclist in 1987. Other victories include the 1975 and 1978 Giro di Lombardia and the 1984 Milan–San Remo.\n\nMoser won the 1974 Paris–Tours, the 1977 Züri-Metzgete, the 1979 Gent–Wevelgem, and the 1977 Flèche Wallonne.\n\nMoser had some success in the three-week grand tours. He rode the Tour de France in 1975, and although he won two stages, led the race for seven days and won the young rider competition, he never rode the Tour again; the mountains did not suit him. However, he won the 1984 Giro d'Italia, in front of Laurent Fignon of France and Moreno Argentin of Italy. Taking advantage of an unusually flat course, Moser used time-trialing ability to overcome what others had gained in the mountains. He also won the points classification in the Giro d'Italia in 1976, 1977, 1978 and 1982.\n\nHe competed in the individual road race and team time trial events at the 1972 Summer Olympics.\n\nMoser won the 1977 world road racing championship in San Cristobal, Venezuela, in front of Thurau and Franco Bitossi. Moser was also silver medallist in 1976, behind Freddy Maertens of Belgium and second in 1978 to Gerrie Knetemann of the Netherlands.\n\nOn 19 January 1984, in Mexico City, Moser broke the 1972 hour record of Eddy Merckx. He rode 50.808 kilometers, on an aerodynamic bike with full disc wheels more advanced than the conventional bike Merckx used in 1972. As a result, in 1997 the Union Cycliste Internationale banned hour records set on bikes featuring technological advantages. Under the new rules, Merckx's record wasn't broken until 2000. Moser auctioned his bicycle to benefit UNICEF.\n\nHe was a member of the Regional Council of Trentino-Alto Adige from 1993 until 1998.\n\nMoser's biggest rival was Giuseppe Saronni.\n\nMoser started a bike company, Moser Cicli, constructing race bikes in a workshop in Trento. Production is 2,000-3,000 frames annually. \n\nHe was the first chairman of the CPA (Cyclistes Professionels Associés), a union for professional riders of TT/I and TT/II league of teams (now UCI WorldTeams and UCI Professional Continental Teams, respectively). He held the position from 1999 until 2007.\n\nMoser also became a viticulturist, cultivating different varieties of grapes.

Governor Tucker said that the proposed policy would encourage women on welfare to use state-provided birth control rather than conceive, and it would save the state of Arkansas one-million dollars per year. Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families opposed the governor's proposed policy, saying it would punish children and their mothers.\n\nIn 1994, Governor Tucker proposed expanding the number of crimes for which 14- and 15-year-olds could be tried as adults. Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families opposed the proposed policy, saying it would do nothing beneficial, and it would send more juveniles into the overburdened adult judicial system.\n\nThe Arkansas House of Representatives debated a bill that would allow police officers to stop, arrest, and interrogate children without notifying their parents in 1994. Prosecutors were in favor of the bill, saying it was necessary for police at crime scenes to question children who might be witnesses or suspects. The Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families said the bill was clearly unconstitutional because minors lack the legal understanding to waive their constitutional rights without consulting an adult adviser such as their parents.\n\nIn 1997, Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families advocated for increasing the number of eligible children participating in the summer lunch program. The group said that just six percent of eligible children participate in the summer lunch program, a rate much lower than any other state.

It is a coastal plain in the Odisha state of eastern India. It includes the delta of the Mahanadi River, Brahmani River, Baitarani River. The most prominent physiographic feature of this plain is the Chilka Lake. It is the biggest lake in the country and its area varies between 780 sq km in winter to 1,144 sq km in the monsoon months.\n\nUtkal Plains, coastal plains in eastern Orissa state, eastern India. Extending over about 16,000 square miles (41,400 square km), the plains are bounded by the Lower Ganges (Ganga) Plain to the north, the Bay of Bengal to the east, the Tamilnad Plains to the south, and the Eastern Ghats to the west. The Utkal Plains are coastal lowlands consisting chiefly of Mahanadi delta deposits and marine sediments, and they merge with the Eastern Ghats at an elevation of about 250 feet (76 metres). The plains have a nearly straight shoreline.\n\nPaleogene and Neogene alluvium (from about 65 to 2.6 million years ago) with patches of ancient Archean gneiss and sandstone (from about 4 billion to 2.5 billion years ago), the plains are widest in the deltaic regions. Sand dunes of decomposed granites and zircon, created mainly by the action of wind at low tide, and lagoons are found along the Bay of Bengal. Chilka, the largest lake in the region (in the southwest), is salty; Samang and Sur (north and northeast of Puri, respectively) are freshwater lakes. Littoral forests are found along the coast of the Cuttack and Balasore areas, and tropical moist deciduous forests are found inland throughout the regions near Puri and Cuttack. The Mahanadi, Brahmani, Baitarani, and Subarnarekha rivers are often subject to heavy flooding; the combined outflow of these rivers has formed the Mahanadi delta in the northern part of the plains. The region has fertile red and black soils.\n\nAgriculture is the main occupation, and rice is the principal crop; pulses (legumes) and oilseeds are also grown. Major irrigation projects located in the plains permit double-cropping. Industry, centred in Cuttack, Bhubaneshwar, and Puri along the Kolkata-Chennai (Calcutta-Madras) railway, includes paper mills, refrigerator plants, and the production of ceramics, glass, refractories, textiles, and galvanized pipe. The plains have a network of roads and railways, inland waterways in Cuttack, and an airfield at Bhubaneshwar.\n\nBuddhism flourished in the Utkal Plains in the 3rd century ce under the Mauryan emperor Ashoka, and the region is described in the rock edicts of Dhauli as forming part of the ancient Kalinga territory. Successive ancient dynasties including the Satavahanas, Karas, and Eastern Gangas ruled the region until, in the latter half of the 16th century, it passed to the Muslims and later to the Marathas.

{"id": "2204862", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2204862", "title": "Viscosity index", "text": "Viscosity index\n\nThe viscosity index (VI) is an arbitrary, unit-less measure of a fluids change in viscosity relative to temperature change. It is mostly used to characterize the viscosity-temperature behavior of lubricating oils. The lower the VI, the more the viscosity is affected by changes in temperature. The higher the VI, the more stable the viscosity remains over temperature fluctuations. The VI was originally measured on a scale from 0 to 100; however, advancements in lubrication science have led to the development of oils with much higher VIs.\n\nThe viscosity of a lubricant is closely related to its ability to reduce friction in solid body contacts. Generally, the least viscous lubricant which still forces the two moving surfaces apart to achieve \"fluid bearing\" conditions is desired. If the lubricant is too viscous, it will require a large amount of energy to move (as in honey); if it is too thin, the surfaces will come in contact and friction will increase.\n\nMany lubricant applications require the lubricant to perform across a wide range of conditions, for example, automotive lubricants are required to reduce friction between engine components when the engine is started from cold (relative to the engine's operating temperatures) up to when it is running. The best oils with the highest VI will remain stable and not vary much in viscosity over the temperature range. This allows for consistent engine performance within the normal working conditions. Historically, there were two different oil types recommended for usage in different weather conditions. As an example, with winter oils and cold starting the engines, and with temperature ranges from, say, -30*C to 0*C, a 5 weight oil would be pumpable at the very low temperatures and the generally cooler engine operating temperatures. However, in hot climates where temperatures range from 30*C to 45*C, a 50 weight oil would be necessary so it would remain thick enough to hold up an oil film between the moving hot parts.\n\nThus the issue of multigrade oils came into being, where with variable temperatures of, say, minus -10*C during the cold nights and 20*C during the days, a 5 weight oil would be good as the oil would be pumpable in a cold engine and as the engine came up to running temperature, and the day warmed up, the characteristics of a 30 weight oil would be ideal. Thus the 5W-30W or 5-30W oils were introduced, rather than the fixed and temperature limiting grades — where the thin oils became too thin when hot and the thicker oils became too thick when cold. \n\nThis effects of temperature on a single viscosity oil can be demonstrated by pouring a small amount of vegetable oil into a pot or pan and then either cooling it in a freezer or heating it on a cooking stove. When oils get cold enough in a deep freezer, they will solidify into a block of \"wax\" like oil that cannot be pumped around inside an engine's lubrication system. However when a spoonful of very cold oil is put into a pan on a stove and it is slowly heated and swirled around, the oil will gradually warm up, and there is a definite temperature range where the oil is warm and very \"oily\" or quite lubricating. However as the oil is heated further, the oil becomes thinner and thinner until it is nearly smoking and it is almost as thin as water — and thus it has almost no capacity to keep moving parts separated — resulting in metal to metal contact and damage of the components that are supposed to be kept apart with a thin film of oil. \n\nThus the multigrade oils are recommended for use based on the ambient temperature ranges of the season or environment.\n\nAdditionally, there are the issues of oil temperature maintenance, such as oil or engine heaters that enable easy starting and shorter warm up period in very cold climates, and oil coolers to dump enough heat from the oil, and thus the engine, gearbox, or hydraulic oil circuit, so as to keep the oil's upper temperature to within a specified upper working limit.\n\nIt is wise to follow the manufacturers recommendation as to what grades of oil or types of lubricants should be used in or on any equipment relative to the seasonal temperature ranges of the environment that the equipment is used in. \n\nDespite all the neurosis generating literature of the advertising industry, a fairly simple oil viscosity and temperature chart does fulfill the educational needs of the user and the enquipment, the latter being reasonably typical of all owner manuals and combustion engine manufacturers. As stipulated earlier, always follow the specifications of your equipment manufacturer.\n\nTypical Engine Oil Temperature Viscosity Chart\n\nThe VI scale was set up by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE). The temperatures chosen arbitrarily for reference are . The scale was originally interpolated between 0 for a naphthenic Texas Gulf crude and 100 for a paraffinnic Pennsylvania crude. Since the inception of the scale better oils have also been produced, leading to VIs greater than 100 (see below).\n\nVI improving additives and higher quality base oils are widely used nowadays which increase the VIs attainable beyond the value of 100. The Viscosity Index of synthetic oils ranges from 80 to over 400.\n\nThe viscosity index can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nwhere \"U\" is the oil's kinematic viscosity at , and \"L\" and \"H\" are values based on the oil's kinematic viscosity at . \"L\" and \"H\" are the values of viscosity at 40°C for oils of VI 0 and 100 respectively, having the same viscosity at 100°C as the oil whose VI we are trying to determine. These \"L\" and \"H\" values can be found in ASTM D2270.\n\nhttps://xenum.com/en/engine-oil-viscosity-index/\n\nhttps://www.lubricants.total.com/what-motor-oil-vi\n"}

The tower anchors the new facility, which includes 233,613 square feet of inpatient beds, emergency care, diagnostic services and clinical space.\nWal-Mart and the Wal-Mart Foundation invested $8 million in the project], while J.B. Hunt gave $5 million toward the construction.\n\nArkansas Children's Hospital (ACH) is a pediatric hospital with a Level I Pediatric Trauma Center, that's located in Little Rock, Arkansas. It is among the largest pediatric hospitals in the United States, and serves children from birth to age 21. ACH is affiliated with the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences and is a teaching hospital with the UAMS College of Medicine's Department of Pediatrics. The hospital also features a burn unit which is one of two in the United States (other being Akron Children's) that treats both pediatric and adult burn patients. The hospital also features the only level 4 NICU in the state, which means they can care for newborns with the most complex health requirements.\n\nU.S. News & World Report ranked Arkansas Children's Hospital as one of the Best Children's Hospitals in four specialties in 2017-18 – Pediatric Cardiology & Heart Surgery, Neonatology, Pediatric Pulmonary and Pediatric Urology.\n\nIn 2017, Arkansas Children's Hospital achieved Magnet® recognition from the American Nurses Credentialing Center. Arkansas Children's was also recognized by the Cribs for Kids® National Safe Sleep Hospital certification program as a Gold Certified Safe Sleep Champion.

Her case became national news because she is one of only two known survivors of this disease, which she contracted after swimming in a warm-water lake park. Physicians at Arkansas Children's Hospital credit Kali's mother Traci with acting swiftly to get her child to the Emergency Department, saving her life. A team of laboratory staff, infectious disease physicians, critical care specialists and rehabilitation medicine experts worked with Kali for weeks to help her overcome the devastating illness. Anti-fungal medications and antibiotics were used. Physicians also contacted the CDC to get permission to use an experimental anti-amoeba drug that had to be shipped from the Atlanta headquarters. Arkansas Department of Health officials said 99 percent of people who contract the naegleria fowleri parasite die. Kali spent 22 days in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit at ACH, followed by several weeks on the hospital's rehabilitation floor before going home.\n\nIn 2007 ACH treated the case of 20-month-old Jacob Esses, which spurred the recall of the Aqua Dots toy. After swallowing a number of the toy beads, 1,4-Butanediol coating the beads was metabolized to Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid (GHB, a recreational anesthetic). The drug has been shown to cause unconsciousness, drowsiness, seizures, coma, or death.\n\nACH has been profiled a number of times on the Discovery Health Channel. In the fall of 2007, the program “Surgery Saved My Life” examined how three physicians in the Arkansas Children's Hospital Vascular Anomalies Center of Excellence handled patients’ potentially fatal vascular tumors.

One patient featured in the profile was a 12-year-old girl who was born in Shanghai with what is believed to be the largest vascular tumor ever seen; Chinese surgeons had been reluctant to operate on the tumor.\n\nDiscovery Health's \"Extreme Surgery\" has also featured the hospital.\n\nACH holds accreditation with the following agencies:\n\nACH holds membership in the following organizations:\n"}
{"id": "2204872", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2204872", "title": "Benton Fraser", "text": "Benton Fraser\n\nBenton Fraser (born 1962) is a fictional character in the television series \"Due South\". He is a constable of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police who works in the American city of Chicago, Illinois as Deputy Liaison Officer in the Canadian consulate. He lives in a dangerous neighbourhood at the fictional address of apartment 3J at 221 East Racine, and later at the consulate itself, after his apartment building was burnt down. The character is portrayed by Canadian actor Paul Gross. Fraser's seemingly strange habits, such as tasting evidence and holding the door for anyone and everyone, add hilarity and whimsy to the show.\n\nAs Fraser often explains; \"\"I first came to Chicago on the trail of the killers of my father, and for reasons that don't need exploring at this juncture I have remained, attached as liaison with the Canadian Consulate\".\" Fraser is a strait-laced Canadian, and his faith in the honour and goodness of others tends to lead to interesting and humorous moments. Described as an \"\"outdoors Sherlock Holmes\"\", his behaviour often leads to the frustration of his de facto partner, Chicago detective Raymond Vecchio, played by David Marciano. His other \"best friend,\" a deaf half-wolf, Diefenbaker, named after the Canadian Prime Minister, John Diefenbaker, reads lips in both English and Inuktitut, and often assists in the capture of criminals. In the third and fourth seasons of the show, Fraser teamed up with Detective Stanley Raymond Kowalski, after Ray Vecchio went undercover in the Las Vegas Mafia.\n\nHe is usually called \"Fraser\" by his friends and colleagues - some old friends will call him \"Benton\" or \"Ben\" at times. Ray calls him \"Benny\" or \"Fraser\", (often mispronouncing it \"Fray-sure\" as in the NBC sitcom \"Frasier\").\n\nBenton Fraser was conceived in an igloo, (according to his father), and was born out in a field, and grew up in Inuvik, Northwest Territories; and Tuktoyaktuk, Northwest Territories. After his mother was killed when he was still young, Benton was raised by his paternal grandparents, who were traveling librarians. His mother, Caroline, was killed when he was an 8-year-old boy, and his father, Bob Fraser, (played by Canadian actor Gordon Pinsent), was murdered in the pilot episode, at this point, Benton had been with the RCMP for 13 years. Bob, or \"Fraser Sr.,\" as he is sometimes known, was a legendarily effective officer in the RCMP and often appears to his son as a ghost throughout the series to offer help and advice. Other relatives include an Uncle Tiberius, (who died wrapped in Cabbage leaves, which the family assumes to have been a freak accident, first mentioned in \"The Gift of the Wheelman\" in season 1,) and an Aunt Winnie, (mentioned only in \"Perfect Strangers\", in season 3).\n\nAccording to best friend, Ray Vecchio, in \"An Eye for a Eye\", Benton's problem is that \"\"if [he] sees a problem, [he's] gotta fix it, [he] can't even go to the mens room without stopping to tell some simple, stupid, charmingly-witty Inuit story, that inspires people to take on the world's social ills.\"\" In \"The Blue Line\", in season 1, it is revealed that Benton is a fan of Ice hockey, and that he used to play it as a child; and in \"Asylum\", in season 3, it is shown that Benton is also a fan of curling. \nFraser has had an unfortunate recurring relationship with Victoria Metcalf, a bank robber with whom he became infatuated after pursuing her into and then helping her survive a lengthy winter storm. After the storm was over, Fraser turned Victoria in to the authorities and she was sent to prison. This encounter is first outlined in episode 14 of series 1, \"You must remember this\"; during a stake-out Fraser comes the closest to 'baring his soul' before turning to find Vecchio asleep. That episode fades with Fraser looking at a slightly crumpled black-and-white photo of her. She later resurfaced in Chicago, blackmailing Fraser into helping her use the money from the bank robbery to buy jewels on the black market, threatening to have Ray Vecchio framed for corruption. She left Chicago soon after her plot unraveled, and was not seen again.\n\nHaving little experience with romantic matters, Fraser appears to have suppressed his emotions, often for comic effect in the series, and buried himself in the masculine pursuits of law enforcement and campcraft. His super-human detective abilities provide humorous contrast with his inability to interact with women. His fixation upon the criminal Metcalf, and later, his superior officer, Margaret Thatcher, (no relation to the British prime minister), was unreasonable, and he may have used his attraction to an unavailable woman as a mechanism for avoiding change in his own life.\n\nIn the ITV documentary \"South Bound\" co-star David Marciano said it was vital that the character of Fraser be both innocent but also unemotional. Actor Daniel Kash, (Detective Louis Gardino in the series), in the same documentary observed about Fraser that 'You'll never see that character cry. You'll sense that he'll be crying inside but you'll never see tears going down his face. He's just too buffed for that, and too reserved.'\n\nIn the episode \"Bounty Hunter\", Fraser meets a woman who seems very compatible with him, but his father warns Benton off. Fraser Sr tries to get his son to understand that the woman is not the one who is vulnerable, but Benton. For all of his son's physical self-reliance, the young constable needs emotional maturing.\n\nFraser eventually discovered he had a half-sister, Maggie MacKenzie, in the season four episode \"Hunting Season\". Because Bob Fraser is her father, she can also see his ghost. Just like her father and half-brother, Maggie is a member of the RCMP. She arrived in Chicago pursuing the killers of her husband, under circumstances similar to Fraser's own arrival in the city, though she soon returned to Canada, unlike Fraser, who remained in Chicago for some time.\n\nFraser wears his uniform stetson hat both in uniform and out. When he loses it, he seems to get into trouble. Fans of the show have thus nicknamed it the \"Stetson of Invulnerability\". Fraser carries his paper money inside his hat. He frequently only has Canadian currency with him as it is \"regulation\" to be paid in that currency.\n\nFraser's apartment is at 221 East Racine. The neighbourhood is dangerous, but Fraser liked the apartment for its close proximity to his workplace.\n\nFraser would eventually return to Canada and, along with Stanley Kowalski, set out on an adventure to find the hand of Sir John Franklin, an explorer who disappeared while trying to discover the Northwest Passage. (The soundtrack for that segment was Stan Rogers's song \"Northwest Passage\".) As the series ended with the beginning of their expedition, it is unknown what has happened to Fraser or Kowalski since then. His closing remarks: \"\"If we find it...we'll let you know\".\"\n\nThe ITV documentary, made nine years after the series ended, concludes with Paul Gross saying \"\"We never did photograph it, but I can tell you that we, (Benton and Stanley,) found it\".\"\n\n"}

He is remembered for an eloquent letter he wrote to his wife Sarah, one week before he was killed in the First Battle of Bull Run.\n\nBallou was born the son of Hiram (1802–1833) and Emeline (Bowen) Ballou, a distinguished Huguenot family in Smithfield, Rhode Island. He lost his father at a young age. In spite of this, he attended boarding school at Nichols Academy in Dudley, Massachusetts and Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. After graduation from Phillips, he attended Brown University, where he was a member of Delta Phi, and went on to study law at the National Law School, in Ballston, New York. He was admitted to the bar in Rhode Island and began practice in 1853.\n\nBallou married Sarah Hart Shumway on October 15, 1855. They had two sons, Edgar and William.\n\nBallou was active in public affairs. In 1854, soon after beginning his law practice, he was elected to the Rhode Island House of Representatives. He was chosen as Clerk of the House, and later as the Speaker. He was a staunch Republican and supporter of Abraham Lincoln.\n\nAfter the bombardment of Fort Sumter in April 1861, President Lincoln called on the states to provide 75,000 militia troops to put down the rebellion.\n\nBallou promptly volunteered, and encouraged others to do so as well. He was commissioned a major in the 2nd Rhode Island Infantry Regiment. He was third in command of the Regiment, after Colonel John Slocum and Lieutenant Colonel Frank Wheaton. He was also appointed judge advocate of the Rhode Island militia.\n\nThe 2nd Rhode Island soon moved to Washington, and joined the Union Army of Northeastern Virginia. On July 21, 1861 the regiment took part in the First Battle of Bull Run.\n\nAs a senior officer, Ballou went in front on horseback to better direct his men. He was hit by a cannonball from a Confederate six-pounder cannon, which tore off part of his right leg and killed his horse. He was carried off the field, and the remainder of his leg was amputated. The Union Army was defeated and retreated to Washington, and Ballou was left behind.\n\nBallou died from his wound a week after the battle, and was buried in the graveyard of nearby Sudley Church. He was one of 94 men of the 2nd Rhode Island killed or mortally wounded at Bull Run. He was 32 at the time of his death; his wife Sarah was 24.\n\nThe battle area was occupied by Confederate forces, and Ballou's body was allegedly exhumed, decapitated, and further desecrated by Confederate troops (though most historians attribute this story to Northern wartime propaganda); his body was never recovered. In place of his body, charred ash and bone believed to be his remains were reburied in Swan Point Cemetery in Providence.\n\nSarah remained a widow and never remarried. She later moved to New Jersey to live with her son, William. She died at age 82 in 1917; her remains are buried beside her husband's.\n\nIn his now famous letter to his wife, Ballou endeavored to express the emotions he was feeling: worry, fear, guilt, sadness, and the pull between his love for her and his sense of duty to the nation. \n\nThe letter was featured prominently in the Ken Burns documentary \"The Civil War\", where a shortened version of it was paired with Jay Ungar's musical piece \"Ashokan Farewell\" and read by Paul Roebling. The documentary excluded many of Ballou's personal references to his family and his upbringing. \n\nThe letter may never have been mailed; it was found in Ballou's trunk after he died. It was reclaimed and delivered to Ballou's widow by Governor William Sprague, either after Sprague had traveled to Virginia to reclaim the effects of dead Rhode Island soldiers, or from Camp Sprague in Washington, D.C.\n\nhttps://www.nps.gov/resources/story.htm%3Fid%3D253\n\n"}

The ship was commissioned by the then Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Western Naval Command Vice Admiral Arun Prakash at St. Petersburg, Russia on 25 June 2003. It has a complement of 32 officers and 228 sailors. In contrast to the lead ship INS \"Talwar\", the sea trials of \"Trishul\" were considerably shortened as the ship performed well. \"Trishul\" arrived in Mumbai on 23 September 2003.\n\n\"Trishul\" belongs to the \"Talwar\"-class of frigates. The \"Talwar\"-class guided missile frigates are modified Krivak III-class frigates built by Russia. These ships use stealth technologies and a special hull design to ensure a reduced radar cross section. Much of the equipment on the ship is Russian-made, but a significant number of systems of Indian origin have also been incorporated.\n\nThe surface to air weapons systems include one single-rail MS-196 launcher that can launch the long range Shtil-1 (NATO: SA-17) surface-to-air missile. Eight Igla-1E (NATO: SA-16) portable air defence missiles are on board for short-range threats. \"Trishul\" became the second Indian warship to incorporate an eight cell KBSM 3S-14NE Vertical Launcher and was the first to upload the new Indian/Russian designed missile, the supersonic BrahMos PJ-10 ASCM (anti-sub/ship/surface cruise missile). \"Trishul\"s VLS can launch the Indian designed 3M-54E Klub-N (NATO: SS-N-27) subsonic ASCM. \"Trishul\" has one 100 mm A-190 (E) dual purpose gun mount for surface and air targets. Its rate of fire is 60 rounds a minute at a range of 15 km.\n\nTwo Kashtan Air Defence Gun/Missile mounts are \"Trishul\"s Close-In Weapons System (CIWS). The Kashtan CIWS has two GSh-30k 30 mm Gatling guns per mount firing 5,000 rounds a minute, along with eight 9M-311 Grison missiles (NATO: SA-N-11) with a range of . There are 64 Grison reloads (32 each mount) with a package of four missile taking less than 2 minutes to load. Forward of \"Trishul\"s bridge and aft of the VLS is one 12-round RBU-6000 anti-submarine warfare rocket launch that can fire either Splav-90R rockets or RGB-60 depth charges. Two pairs of fixed 533 mm DTA-53 torpedo tubes are located port and starboard midships. Both can launch either SET-65E anti-sub and 53-65KE antiship torpedoes.\n\nIn December 2005, \"Trishul\" collided with a commercial ship, \"Ambuja Laxmi\", outside the Mumbai harbour, while returning from a training mission. Radar systems installed by the port authorities and those on board \"Ambuja Laxmi\" were unable to detect \"Trishul\", and were unable to prevent the side-on collision.\n\nIn the later part of 2017, \"Trishul\" was deployed on a four-month long anti piracy mission in the region of Gulf of Aden.

Valencia won the 2003–04 La Liga title and in the same year became UEFA Cup champions, during which Sissoko played nine matches. The following year, Benítez left to manage Liverpool and was replaced by Claudio Ranieri.\n\nSissoko moved from Valencia to Liverpool for £5.6 million in the summer of 2005. His first appearance was against Kaunas on 26 July 2005 in the UEFA Champions League qualifiers. In February 2006, he suffered serious eye injury after collision with Benfica's midfielder Beto.\n\nSissoko was part of the FA Cup winning side in 2006 and played an integral role for the team. In the summer of 2007, Sissoko rejected offers from Barcelona, CSKA Moscow and Juventus to stay on Merseyside. His only goal for Liverpool came on 25 August 2007, a low shot from twenty yards out against Sunderland in a 2–0 away win.\n\nIn January 2008 Sissoko transferred to Italian club Juventus, where he would team up with former coach Claudio Ranieri, for a fee of €11 million. He made his first appearance for the club in February 2008, coming in as a 67th minute substitution for Tiago in a Serie A fixture versus Cagliari Calcio. Sissoko scored his first goal for Juventus on 2 March 2008, the equaliser against Fiorentina. During the first half of the 2008–09 season, he regularly featured in the starting line-up, forming a partnership with youngster Claudio Marchisio as the centre midfield pair in Claudio Ranieri's 4–4–2 formation. His season ended early after he broke his foot in March 2009 ruling him out for the rest of that season and into the start of the 2009–10 season.\n\nSissoko's injury problems continued throughout the rest of the 2009–10 season and into 2010–11 season, as he suffered thigh strains, a leg strain, Achilles tendon inflammation, and finally season-ending knee surgery in March 2011.\n\nOn 28 July 2011, Sissoko moved to Ligue 1 side Paris Saint-Germain for a transfer fee of €7 million, plus €1 million if they qualified for the Group Stage of the UEFA Champions League before September 2013. Sissoko scored his first goal for PSG in November, when he headed in a cross from Nenê, in a 1–1 draw against Bordeaux at the Stade Chaban Delmas. In April 2012 he captained the squad against rivals Olympique de Marseille in Le Classique, but was sent off in the 86th minute for two bookable offences in a game that finished 2–1 to the Parisian club.\n\nOn 30 January 2013, Sissoko joined Fiorentina on loan.\nOn 3 September 2013 Sissoko left PSG by mutual consent.\n\nOn 30 January 2014, Sissoko joined La Liga side Levante on a six-month deal after spending nearly five months without a club. On 25 June 2015, he was transferred to Chinese Super League side Shanghai Shenhua, and was released on 21 February 2016.\n\nOn 1 October 2016, he joined Indian Super League franchise FC Pune City as a marquee player. On 17 February 2017, he joined Italian club Ternana Calcio on a six-month contract, but terminated his contract just 25 days later.\nOn 13 April 2017, he joined Indonesian club side Mitra Kukar on a one-year contract. On 2 December 2017, Sissoko switched to Mexican club Atlético San Luis.\n\nOn 4 July 2018. Sissoko moved to Hong Kong Premier League club Kitchee on a one-year deal. Less than four months later, he terminated his contract in order to care for his father in France.\n\nOn 16 January 2019, he signed a six-month contract with FC Sochaux-Montbéliard.\n\nIn January 2020, Sissoko announced his retirement as a player.\n\nBorn in Mont-Saint-Aignan, France, Sissoko was eligible to play for the French national football team but opted to play international football for his ancestral country, Mali. Sissoko obtained his first international call-up in 2004, and has appeared for his country in almost all African Cup of Nations qualifiers and tournaments since then. He has also featured in FIFA World Cup qualifiers for both 2006 and 2010. Sissoko has made 34 official appearances for Mali, and has scored 2 goals. With the Mali national football team, he finished fourth in the 2004 African Cup of Nations, and third in the 2013 African Cup of Nations.\n\nA large, quick, combative, and physically strong defensive midfielder, Sissoko excels as a ball winner, a role which allows him to support his more offensive midfield teammates defensively by laying off the ball to them after winning back possession. Due to his tenacious tackling, stamina, work-rate, and tactical intelligence, he has been compared to former French midfielder Patrick Vieira, also earning the nickname \"La Piovra\" (the octopus) during his time with Juventus, due to his long limbs and energetic style of play. In addition to his ball-winning abilities, and his physical and athletic attributes, he is also known for his powerful striking ability from distance.\n\nSissoko is the nephew of former African Footballer of the Year Salif Keïta, who, like Sissoko, played for Mali and Valencia CF. Salif Keita is also the uncle of former FC Barcelona midfielder Seydou Keita. Both Sissoko and Seydou Keita play similar roles as hard-tackling defensive midfielders. Sissoko is sometimes referred to as \"the Black Ninja\" for his tenacious tackling and work rate. He has no relation to football player Moussa Sissoko, but is the elder brother of Abdou Sissoko.\n\nSissoko has said \"I am proud of being a Muslim and I follow Ramadan even during the football tournament,\" on the Dubai-based Arab TV network, Al Arabiya.\n\nValencia\n\nLiverpool\n\nParis Saint-Germain\n\nMali\n\nIndividual\n\n"}

In the United Kingdom and Australia, after the Second World War, it was commonly used for tractors until diesel engines became commonplace. In Australian English it was known as power kerosene.\n\nTVO existed for at least fifteen years before it became widely used. A 1920 publication mentions it as a product of British Petroleum. But it was not until the late 1930s that it first became widely used. The post war Ferguson TE20 tractor, a carefully researched and near-ideal tractor for use on British farms, was designed around a petrol (gasoline) engine, the Standard inline-four. Although there was a campaign for the reintroduction of agricultural Road Duty (tax)-free petrol, which had been curtailed during the war, this was not forthcoming. Perkins Engines supplied some conversions into diesel engines which could use untaxed red diesel.\n\nOn the early Fordson model N, the tap which changed over from petrol to TVO was marked G for gasoline and K for kerosene, reflecting that these tractors had their design origin in the USA. In the UK tractor vaporising oil was usually called TVO.\n\nAs a substitute for petrol, TVO was developed. Paraffin (kerosene) was commonly used as a domestic heating fuel and was untaxed. Paraffin has a low octane rating and would damage an engine built for petrol. The manufacture of paraffin involves the removal of aromatic hydrocarbons from what is now sold as heating oil. These aromatics have an octane rating, so adding some of that otherwise waste product material back in a controlled manner into paraffin gave TVO. The resulting octane rating of TVO was somewhere between 55 and 70. \n\n\n\nThe words paraffin and kerosene are often used interchangeably but the tables suggest that this is incorrect because they have different octane ratings. However, kerosene and heating oil have similar octane ratings. Paraffin, kerosene and petrol (gasoline) are all rather loosely defined. For example, gasoline may have an octane rating between 88 and 102.\n\nBecause TVO has a lower octane rating than petrol, the engine needs a lower compression ratio. On the TVO version of the Ferguson TE20 tractor, the cylinder head was re-designed to reduce the compression ratio to 4.5:1. This reduced the power output, so the cylinder bore was increased to 85 mm to restore the power. The petrol version had a compression ratio of 5.77:1 and a cylinder bore of 80 mm on early versions..\n\nIn practice TVO had most of the properties of paraffin, including the need for heating to encourage vapourisation. As a result, the exhaust and inlet manifolds were adapted so that more heat from the former warmed the latter. Such a setup was called a vaporiser. To get the tractor to start from cold, a small second fuel tank was added that contained petrol. The tractor was started on the expensive petrol, then – once the engine was warm – the fuel supply switched over to TVO or paraffin. So long as the engine was working hard, as when ploughing or pulling a load, the TVO would burn well. Under light conditions, such as travelling unloaded on the highway, the engine was better on petrol.\n\nSome tractor designs included a radiator \"blind\" that would restrict the flow of air over the radiator which led to the engine running hotter, which could help with starting. If the radiator blind was left shut, though, there was a risk of engine damage, especially in warm weather.\n\nThe phrase petrol-paraffin engine is often used to describe an engine that uses TVO. This can be interpreted either as \n\nTVO was withdrawn from sale by UK suppliers in 1974. An approximation to the correct specification can be made from petrol and heating oil (burning oil). In the UK there is an exception that permits the use of rebated kerosene and fuel oils in vintage vehicles.\n"}

Born in Kirk Sandall, Yorkshire, Mallender was a right-arm fast-medium bowler and a right-hand lower order batsman who improved as his career progressed. He played first-class cricket in England for Northamptonshire (1980–1986 and 1995–1996) and for Somerset (1987–1994). He also played for Otago (1983–84 to 1992–93), captaining the side in 1990–91 and 1991–92.\n\nMallender was born in Kirk Sandall in Yorkshire, but spent the early part of his childhood in Somerset, before moving to Lincolnshire, where he attended Bourne Grammar School, showing himself as a natural sportsman in cricket and football. During this time, he gained representative honours at schoolboy level for county and country, captaining England youth on a tour of the West Indies.\n\nAfter school, he was courted by several counties, including his birth county of Yorkshire, but began his first-class career for Northamptonshire in 1980, having impressed on a tour of the West Indies with England Young Cricketers. A right-arm fast-medium bowler, and an increasingly useful lower-order batsman, he was capable of bowling at a sharp pace, operating within himself and using the conditions expertly. He won his county cap in 1984, but moved to Somerset in 1987. He was an important part of the rebuilding process at Taunton, and soon became popular with members and players alike.\n\nHe had come close to selection twice for England, when the touring side were struggling with injuries in 1983-84 and 1991-92 as England searched for replacements to injury-hit squads during England tours to New Zealand, but he did not make his Test debut until 1992, in the home series against Pakistan at Headingley in July 1992, as his style was thought to be particularly suited to the Headingley pitch.\n\nMallender proved to be a good selection, bowling with controlled swing and pace and able to lure the Pakistan batsmen, unfamiliar with the conditions, into rash strokes. He returned 5 for 50 in the second innings and 8 for 122 in the match to help England square the series 1–1. He retained his place for the fifth Test at The Oval, where he opened the bowling, but took only two lower-order wickets in the match, which Pakistan won decisively. He was then not selected for the winter tour to Sri Lanka and India, and never played Test cricket again. He had a Test bowling average of 10 wickets at 21.50.\n\nMallender spent ten consecutive seasons (1983-84 to 1992-93) playing for Otago in New Zealand, for whom he became something of a local. He captained the side for two years (1990–91, 1991–92) and generally revelled in the New Zealand conditions, always featuring near the top of the bowling averages. He took over 250 first-class wickets, at a touch over 20 apiece, as well as scoring his only first-class century in 1991-92 against Central Districts. His efforts helped Otago (traditionally one of New Zealand domestic cricket’s bridesmaids) win the Shell Trophy twice during his stay. As a consequence Mallender was awarded the rare honour, to a foreigner, of a testimonial.\n\nAlways whole-hearted and sometimes inspired, he left Somerset after a richly deserved benefit season in 1994 to return to Northamptonshire. But the length of time between injuries became ever shorter, and the body could clearly take no more. He called it a day in 1996 with 937 first-class wickets, and nearly 5,000 runs.\n\nHe later became an international umpire, officiating in three Tests in 2003-4, and twenty two ODIs between 2001 and 2003. He was appointed to the Elite Panel of ICC Umpires in 2004 , but chose to turn down the appointment due to family reasons .\n\n"}

He also competed in the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Qatar, during 18 seasons overall.\n\nNicknamed \"Neku\", and widely regarded as one of Asia's greatest footballers, Nekounam represented the Iran national team a record of 151 times, playing several major tournaments including two World Cups and four Asian Cups.\n\nNekounam was born in Rey. Having played for Pas Tehran F.C. for several years, appearing in the AFC Champions League with the team, he signed a five-month contract with Al-Wahda F.C. in the United Arab Emirates for US$1 million, in 2005.\n\nIn January 2006, Nekounam joined Al Sharjah SC, although some European clubs such as 1. FC Kaiserslautern and Tottenham Hotspur had previously shown interest in him.\n\nAfter his performance at the 2006 World Cup Nekounam was linked to the likes of Hertha BSC of the Bundesliga and Ligue 1's Olympique Lyonnais, but he eventually joined CA Osasuna on a two-year contract, with an option to a third year and a €5 million minimum release-fee clause on his contract – he thus became the first Iranian player to be signed by a Spanish club. On 22 February 2007, he scored in the 120th minute of the match against FC Girondins de Bordeaux for the knockout stages of the UEFA Cup to help to a 1–0 home win and aggregate score, and after a particularly successful first season began to attract interest from other European sides, notably Scotland's Rangers who had a £1 million pound offer rejected.\n\nOn 14 August 2007, Nekounam suffered an anterior cruciate ligament rupture in his right knee and, after undergoing a successful surgery in Augsburg, Germany, missed eight months of action. His number 24 was given to new signing Jaroslav Plašil, as he recovered from his injury.\n\nOn 24 November 2007, Osasuna showed faith in Nekounam signing a three-year contract extension on his existing contract that was set to end on 30 June of the following year, with a €5 million buy-out clause for the first two seasons and €2.5M for the last. In February of the following year he made his first training appearance since the injury – incidentally, a week later, Xavier Margairaz suffered a similar injury, missing an estimate period that could amount to one year, on 27 April he made his return against Valencia CF, replacing Francisco Puñal in the 70th minute of a 0–3 away loss.\n\nOn 31 August 2008, Nekounam scored Osasuna's first goal of the season, from the penalty spot in a 1–1 home draw against Villarreal CF. In November/December he also netted, but the Navarrese failed to win at Málaga CF (2–4) and with Real Valladolid (3–3), also scoring the opener against Real Madrid, in a 1–3 away loss on 18 January 2009.\n\nOn 22 March 2009, Nekounam netted a last-minute goal against RCD Espanyol for a 1–0 home win, and finished the season as the team's second goalscorer behind Walter Pandiani, scoring eight times in the league (a career-best in Spain). In summer 2009 he received offers from both Espanyol and Villarreal, with the latter in particular being ready to pay the buy-out clause in Nekounam's contract; however, the player repeatedly insisted to be \"happy at the club\", waiting until he \"hears some better deals\".\n\nNekounam was again a regular starter for Osasuna in the 2010–11 campaign, but also spent one month at the 2011 AFC Asian Cup with his national team. On 20 February 2011, in the second game upon his return from Qatar, he scored twice in a 4–0 home win against Espanyol, and eventually finished the campaign with six goals in 26 appearances in another escape from relegation.\n\nOn 21 May 2011, Nekounam renewed his contract with Osasuna for another two seasons, with the option of an annual renewal of his link. In July of the following year, amidst interest from Iranian powerhouse Esteghlal F.C. and unnamed Turkish and Qatari clubs, it was reported that he would only remain with the \"Rojillos\" if he accepted a salary reduction – he was the highest-paid player.\n\nOn 21 July 2012, aged almost 32, Nekounam returned to his country and signed a two-year contract with Esteghlal for a record fee of US$1,500,000, which made him the most expensive player in the Iran Pro League history. He scored his first goal for his new club in a 2–3 loss against Foolad F.C. on 28 November, through a penalty.\n\nOn 5 May 2013, against the same opponent, he also found the net, helping his team secure its 28th league title and winning his second national championship.\n\nOn 14 January 2014, Nekounam agreed to a four-month deal with Kuwait SC. He scored his first goal for the club on 2 February, netting the only in an AFC Champions League qualifier against Al Shorta SC.\n\nNekounam scored three goals in the 2014 edition of the AFC Cup, and also won the season's Kuwait Emir Cup.\n\nOn 4 August 2014, Nekounam returned to Osasuna by signing a two-year contract. He scored in his first game upon his return, a 1–3 Segunda División loss against Deportivo Alavés on 6 September; on 2 November he added another, helping to a 3–2 home success over Real Betis.\n\nNekounam returned to Iran and its Persian Gulf Pro League on 6 July 2015, joining Saipa F.C. on a one-year deal. He scored his first competitive goal for his new team on 6 August, netting the second in a 2–0 win at Rah Ahan Yazdan FC.\n\nOn 21 January 2016, Nekounam moved to Qatari club Al-Arabi SC on a four-month contract with an option to extend for a further year. In his first match, at home against Qatar SC, he assisted countryman Ashkan Dejagah in an eventual 1–1 draw.\n\nNekounam left the team on 30 June 2016, and the 35-year-old announced his retirement two weeks later.\n\nNekounam received his first call-up to Iran in May 2000. He became a starter for the national side during the 2002 FIFA World Cup qualifiers and, already a key midfield element, played in two of the national team's matches during the 2006 World Cup in Germany, being suspended for the final group game against Angola after his second yellow card against Portugal.\n\nAdditionally, Nekounam helped Iran win the 2002 Asian Games and the 2004 West Asian Football Federation Championship, and also represented the country in the 2004, 2007 and 2011 AFC Asian Cups. He was \"Team Melli\"'s leading goalscorer in its successful 2014 World Cup qualifying campaign and, on 1 June 2014, he was called up as captain by Carlos Queiroz for the finals in Brazil, where he captained the nation in an eventual group stage exit.\n\nNekounam was also selected for the 2015 Asian Cup squad, on 30 December 2014. In March 2015, he hinted that a friendly against Sweden on the 31st – five days earlier, against Chile, he had become his country's most capped player after surpassing Ali Daei– might be his last international, but later went back on that statement only to confirm it the following day and subsequently send an emotional open letter to fans; he scored 39 goals for his country, and shortly after retiring was named Queiroz's assistant.\n\nMidway through the 2017–18 season, Nekounam became the manager of F.C. Nassaji Mazandaran. His team won 23 points from his nine games in charge, and were promoted to the Persian Gulf Pro League after a 24-year absence.\n\nPas\n\nEsteghlal\n\nAl-Kuwait\n\nIran\n\n\n\n"}

There were huge wooden tables. The design was formulated by Amanda Wilmott in February 1994. This followed the lead of existing female-friendly bar chains such as Pitcher & Piano and Slug and Lettuce. Wilmott, a former director of Slug & Lettuce, designed a similar chain for Yates Brothers Wine Lodges called Ha! Ha! Bar & Canteen, which first opened in February 1998 in Bristol; Mitchells & Butlers bought the brand's 22 pubs for £19m from Bay Restaurant Group in September 2010, converting some of them to All Bar One pubs. Bass Leisure Retail opened another chain, Edward's, in the late 1990s that was similar.\n\nIn October 1994, Wilmott found Mary-Jane Brook and Nelly Benstead to run the first outlet. The first bar was opened in December 1994 in Sutton, London, town centre by Bass Taverns, run by Sir Ian Prosser, who also owned Fork and Pitcher and Harvester. Bass bought Harvester in 1994. In its style, many pub chains have followed where All Bar One led.\n\nFive outlets opened in 1995 (including Islington, Wimbledon and Richmond in London). By 1996, Bass had 15 All Bar One pubs, 69 O'Neill's pubs and 102 Harvesters. By 1999 there were 46 in the chain. Jeremy Spencer, a friend of gastropub-inventor Mike Belben, was responsible for creating the brand of pub. In 1999, Jeremy Spencer was replaced by Karen Forrester (who previously ran O'Neills, and who now runs T.G.I.

It premiered, under Hans Richter, on 26 December 1880 in Vienna. Eight days later, it was repeated at the University of Breslau on a program with the premiere of the Academic Festival Overture. Most performances last between twelve and fifteen minutes.\n\nBrahms chose the title \"tragic\" to emphasize the turbulent, tormented character of the piece, in essence a free-standing symphonic movement, in contrast to the mirthful ebullience of a companion piece he wrote the same year, the \"Academic Festival Overture\". Despite its name, the \"Tragic Overture\" does not follow any specific dramatic program. Brahms summed up the effective difference in character between the two overtures when he declared \"one laughs while the other cries.\" Brahms quotes some material from the last movement of the Second Symphony in this overture. \n\nThe \"Tragic Overture\" comprises three main sections, all in the key of D minor.\n\nTheorists have disagreed in analyzing the form of the piece: Jackson finds Webster's multifarious description rather obscurist and prefers to label the work's form as a \"reversed sonata design\" in which the second group is recapitulated before the first, with Beethoven's \"Coriolan Overture\" as a possible formal model.\n\nThe work is scored for piccolo, two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, four horns, two trumpets, three trombones, tuba, timpani, and strings.\n\n"}

He also made it to the national team while playing for Foolad, immediately becoming the number one keeper for his country. One of his most memorable moments came when he scored a goal on rival goalkeeper Armenak Petrosyan, off a goal kick. He was the captain of the team which won the 2004–2005 IPL championship. He also played in AFC Champions League for Foolad. After World Cup 2006, despite rumors linking him to CD Nacional and Saipa, he signed a one-year contract with Foolad's rival, Esteghlal Ahvaz.\n\nHe was seriously injured after only four appearances for Esteghlal Ahvaz, an injury that kept him out of play for fourteen months. He made his first appearance for his new club Steel Azin in a Hazfi Cup match against Shirin Faraz in November 2007.\n\nThen, for the 2008–09 season he joined Saipa. He started the season with being a regular player but he could not keep this and only played in 16 matches. He mentioned that he wants to stay with Saipa. He second season was more successful where he was able to play more matches and was even called up to Team Melli.\n\nHe joined Paykan in the summer of 2010 but after the club's relegation to the Azadegan League, he left the club and joined Shahrdari Tabriz for the next season but had a serious injury towards the end of the season and did not finish the season. He joined the first division team Sang Ahan for the next season and played 16 matches. Mirazpour retired from professional football in 2013.\n\nEbrahim Mirzapour's introduction to the Iranian football squad certainly raised a few eyebrows in Iran when the ex-national team coach, the Croat Miroslav Blazevic preferred him to some more experienced goal keepers. Although Mirzapour started nervously, his solid performance in friendly games and against the odds made Blazevic to have enough confidence in him and install him as the fixed starter in the World Cup 2002 qualification matches. Mirzapour did not disappoint either as his towering presence and agility against the best of the competition certainly increased his popularity and his fan base. Although he was faulted in one or two occasions during the qualifying rounds, he was also credited for many saves and for preventing defeats in matches, by his solid and strong performance. Iran eventually did not make it to the 2002 World Cup, due to their 2–1 aggregate loss to the Republic of Ireland in the playoffs.\n\nEbrahim Mirzapour was able to keep his starting position in the national team coached by Branko Ivankovic. He was the starting goalkeeper in Iran's successful run of victories, attaining a number of clean sheets throughout the 2006 World Cup qualifying matches. Iran together with Japan were the first nations to qualify for the 2006 World Cup, where Mirzapour played in all three of Iran's matches.\n\nAlthough his outstanding reflexes and agility are noted, Mirzapour has a habit of suffering from lapses in concentration and is prone to make mistakes especially on goal kicks. He played a great game in Iran's second World Cup match vs. Portugal, although they lost 2–0.\n\nAfter the world cup and the criticism on him, he was invited to Team Melli again for the match against South Korea in 2007 AFC Asian Cup qualification match under the new coach Amir Ghalenoei. After about two years he was invited to Team Melli again on May 2008 under Ali Daei and played for Team Melli in West Asian Football Federation Championship 2008 after about 2 years and won this cup but he got injured in the match against Qatar. He featured in West Asian Football Federation Championship 2010 and was part of the squad in 2011 Asian Cup under Afshin Ghotbi.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2204969", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2204969", "title": "Critical literacy", "text": "Critical literacy\n\nCritical literacy is defined as the ability to take apart various texts in media or writing to find any possible discrimination that the author might have embedded in his or her presentation of the world since authors have social and political influence. This is done by analyzing the messages promoting prejudiced power relationships found naturally in media and written material that go unnoticed otherwise by reading beyond the author's words and examining the manner in which the author has conveyed his or her ideas about society's norms to determine whether these ideas contain racial or gender inequality.\n\nCritical literacy can be illustrated by examining the first sentence in this article. It narrows the definition by referring to \"possible discrimination\" so excludes the use of the term to refer to other kinds of bias such as Eurocentrism, Americentrism and Whiggism. The use of the expression \"his or her\" reveals the authors' binary view of gender. A broader critical reading of the general construction of the sentence, particularly the expression \"since authors have social and political influence\", suggests the authors' may not have English as a first language.\n\nCritical literacy is an instructional approach, stemming from Marxist critical pedagogy, that advocates the adoption of \"critical\" perspectives toward text. Critical literacy encourages readers to actively analyze texts and offers strategies for what proponents describe as uncovering underlying messages. There are several different theoretical perspectives on critical literacy that have produced different pedagogical approaches to teaching and learning. All of these approaches share the basic premise that literacy requires the literate consumers of text to adopt a critical and questioning approach\n\nWhen students examine the writer's message for bias, they are practicing critical literacy. This skill of actively engaging with the text can be used to help students become more perceptive and societally aware citizens who do not receive the messages around them from media, books, and images without first taking apart the text and relating its messages back to their own personal life experiences. Thus by getting students to question the power structures in their society, critical literacy teaches them how to dispute these written and oral views regarding issues of equality so that they may combat the social injustices against marginalized groups in their communities.\n\nAccording to proponents of critical literacy, the practice is not simply a means of attaining literacy in the sense of improving the ability to decode words, syntax, etc. In fact, the ability to read words on paper is not necessarily required in order to engage in a critical discussion of \"texts,\" which can include television, movies, web pages, music, art and other means of expression. The important thing is being able to have a discussion with others about the different meanings a text might have and teaching the potentially critically literate learner how to think flexibly about it\n\nCritical literacy has become a popular approach to teaching English to students in some English speaking-countries, including Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the UK\n\nFor post-structuralist practitioners of critical literacy, the definition of this literacy practice can be quite malleable, but usually involves a search for discourses and reasons why certain discourses are included or left out of a text. \n\nTwo major theoretical perspectives within the field of critical literacy are the Neo-Marxist/Freirean and the Australian. These approaches overlap in many ways and they do not necessarily represent competing views, but they do approach the subject matter differently\n\nWhile critical literacy and critical thinking involve similar steps and may overlap, they are not interchangeable. Critical thinking is done when one troubleshoots problems and solves them through a process involving logic and mental analysis. This is because critical thinking focuses on ensuring that one's arguments are sufficiently supported by evidence and void of unclear or deceptive presentation. Thus, critical thinking attempts to understand the outside world and recognize that there are other arguments beyond one's own by evaluating their reasoning for such arguments, but critical thinking does not go further beyond revealing a loaded claim.\n\nTo make sense of the biases embedded within these claims first uncovered by critical thinking, critical literacy goes beyond identifying the problem to also analyzing the power dynamics that create the written or oral texts of society and then questioning their claims. Therefore, critical literacy examines the language and wording of politics within these texts and how politics uses certain aspects of grammar to convey its intended meaning. Practicing critical literacy lets students challenge both the author of the text in addition to the social and historical contexts in which the text was produced.\n\nIn addition to print sources, critical literacy also evaluates media and technology by looking at who owns these forms of information as well as to whom they are writing and their goal in creating these various texts. Students will look at the underlying information being communicated in literature, popular and online media, and journalism in the hopes of taking social action.\n\nCritical literacy practices grew out of the social justice pedagogy of Brazilian educator and theorist Paulo Freire, as first described in \"Education as the Practice of Freedom\" published in 1967 and his most famous book \"Pedagogy of the Oppressed\", published in 1968. Freirean critical literacy is conceived as a means of empowering disempowered populations against oppression and coercion, frequently seen as enacted by corporate and/or government entities. Freirean critical literacy starts with the desire to balance social inequities and address societal problems caused by abuse of power. It proceeds from this philosophical basis to examine, analyze, and deconstruct texts.\n\nCritical literacy was later established more prominently with Donaldo Macedo in 1987. In his 1968 book, \"Pedagogy of the Oppressed\", Paulo Freire writes that individuals who are oppressed by those in positions of power are initially afraid to have freedom since they have internalized the rules of their oppressors and the consequences of not abiding by these rules. Thus, despite their internal desire for freedom, they continue to live in what Freire calls the “fear of freedom,” instead choosing to follow a pre-set prescription of behaviors that meet their oppressors’ approval. In order to understand the actual nature of their oppression, however, Freire states that their education must teach them to understand that their reality can be changed and with it, their oppression.\n\nThis perspective is reflected in the works of Peter McLaren, Henry Giroux, and Jean Anyon, among many others. The Freirean perspective on critical literacy is strongly represented in critical pedagogy.\n\nCritical pedagogy seeks to end the unjust oppression of humans by advocating change in the way schools pass on information. From this emerges critical literacy, which states that by working to comprehend the manner in which texts are written and presented, one may understand the political, social, and economic environments in which the text was formed as well as be able to identify hidden ideologies existing within such texts.\n\nOther philosophical approaches to critical literacy, while sharing many of the ideas of Neo-Marxist/Freirean critical literacy, may be viewed as a less overtly politicized expansion on these ideas. Critical literacy helps teachers as well as students to explore the relationship between theoretical framework and its practical implications.\n\nFreire includes several basic factors in his formation of critical literacy. The first step of critical literacy involves bringing awareness, or “consciousness” as Freire terms it, to those who are mistreated and to those who bring about this mistreatment through promoting unfair ideologies via politics and other positions of power, such as schools and government. This is because Freire and Macedo hold that written texts also represent information that has been built on previous schemas about the world since the mistreated often are not conscious that they are oppressed, viewing their poverty or marginalization as a natural part of life. Thus accepting their unjust hardship, they do not know the necessary steps they can take to change their circumstances and as a result, remain in their oppression.\n\nHowever, the second factor of critical literacy combats this by seeking to transform the way in which the school system transmits information since schools are frequently the primary carriers of information in a society. In the 1999 fall volume of the \"Journal of Pedagogy, Pluralism, and Practice\", Ira Shor writes that critical literacy can be used to reveal one's subjective beliefs about the world by causing them to question their personal assumptions through using words. Able to be tailored to work with diverse ideas relating to feminism or neo-Marxism, critical literacy presents students with different ways of thinking about their self-development by challenging them to consider differing perspectives about issues rather than settle with the cultural norms and status quo. The goal of this is to lead students to promote social action within their community to change unjust structures.\n\nIt is accomplished through advocating honest dialogue between the teacher and students in which both parties learn together through critical discussion of important issues rather than follow a banking model of education, which is a traditional method of teaching that treats students as empty containers, or banks, to be filled by teachers whose primary roles are to lecture and pass on information that students must receive and recite during tests. Freire was not a proponent of the banking model because he believed rather than creating conscious knowledge within students, this model instead allowed schools to continue perpetuating belief systems that justified unequal dynamics of power and as a result, caused marginalization of groups to resume.\n\nYet when teachers facilitate discussion between students regarding the controversial issues that pertain to them and their society, this honest dialogue acts as a bridge to allow students to question the social inequalities in their own communities and the underlying hierarchies that govern these prejudices. Honest dialogue between instructor and student leads students to the third factor: critical reflection of how they can apply the knowledge they have discovered through dialogue to their own life situations in order to take concrete actions to change society and right injustices.\n\nBy teaching critical literacy, teachers can help students take action by expanding their mindsets to better understanding the perspectives of other overlooked groups in society and thus, grow in appreciation for those who have a different culture and language than they do.\n\nThere are numerous ways teachers can encourage the development of critical literacy. Teachers can adapt the teaching of critical literacy to their individual classrooms by encouraging students to analytically read literature, movies, and magazines to challenge the social norms found within these texts rather than simply accept the author's message without fair questioning and testing of his or her ideas. After students read these texts, they can form their own ideas to dispute the text and write a response to oppose its claims.\n\nAnother technique that teachers can use to teach critical literacy is letting students conduct research on a topic relating to social justice that they are interested in. Allowing students to investigate social issues relating their own lives can also lead them to taking personal responsibility for social change in their communities. Having students dissect different texts from various sources and authors in order to uncover the authors’ biases resulting from his or her ingrained ideas of norms is another method for developing the skill of critical literacy as well as having students rewrite passages they read but from the viewpoints and circumstances of oppressed minority groups. Reading a multitude of different texts or additional readings that accompany the text can also help students practice critical literacy.\n\nTeaching critical literacy can also develop certain skills. First, teaching critical literacy allows students to develop their ability to understand the messages found in online articles and other sources of media such as news stations or journalism through careful analysis of the text and how the text is presented.\n\nSecond, critical literacy teaches them how to identify discrimination within institutions of power and then to question these power dynamics when they appear in written and oral texts so that students may comprehend why certain topics such as racial slurs are controversial in society. Teachers help foster students’ higher order thinking through in-class discussions about these social topics in what is known as a dialogic environment. Here, the traditional banking model of teaching is replaced by teachers giving students a chance to openly express their ideas and thoughts on the issues being taught in class.\n\nThirdly, critical literacy aids the growth of reading skills by allowing students to actively relate various texts to other texts to determine if the overall messages promote or discourages the marginalization of minority groups. Younger children can also learn to practice critical literacy by having a teacher read picture books out loud to them as the children learn to examine what messages the images and paragraphs in the picture books convey. By encouraging students to find ways these social issues relate to their own personal lives, students’ minds are expanded to see cultural and racial differences as a positive thing.\n\nLastly, critical literacy prepares students to recognize the importance of language in the formation of politics, social hierarchy, race, and power because the way in which phrases are worded can impact the overall message. This also appears in the realm of education as schools and teachers must determine whether they will teach and request that students use only the standard academic dialect in class or allow them to continue using the dialect they learned in the home. Critical literacy causes students to rethink which variation of language they speak since the standard dialect is the prevalent one and contains more power.\n\nLankshear, C. & McLaren, P. (Eds.)

Along with Zeng Guofan, Li Hongzhang and Zuo Zongtang, Zhang Zhidong was one of the four most famous officials of the late Qing dynasty. Known for advocating controlled reform, he served as the Governor of Shanxi Province and Viceroy of Huguang, Liangguang and Liangjiang, and also as a member of the Grand Council. He took a leading role in the abolition of the Imperial examination system in 1905. The Red Guards destroyed his tomb in 1966 during the Cultural Revolution. His remains were rediscovered in 2007 and reburied with honors.\n\nZhang Zhidong was also known by other names. An older Wade–Giles form was Chang Chih-tung. His courtesy name was Xiaoda () or Xiangtao (). His pseudonyms were Xiangyan (), Hugong (), Wujing Jushi () and Baobing (). The posthumous name given to him by the Qing government was Wenxiang ().\n\nZhang was born in Xingyi Prefecture (), Guizhou Province, but his ancestral roots were in Nanpi, Tianjin, Zhili Province. He was the cousin of Zhang Zhiwan. In 1852, he sat for the provincial-level imperial examination in Shuntian Prefecture (present-day Beijing) and achieved the top position as \"jieyuan\" () in the \"juren\" class. In 1863, he sat for the palace-level examination and emerged as \"tanhua\" (), the third highest-ranked candidate of the \"jinshi\" class. He was then admitted to the Hanlin Academy as a \"bianxiu\" (編修; editor) before taking up other positions, including \"jiaoxi\" (), \"shidu\" () and \"shijiang\" (). In 1881, he was appointed as the \"xunfu\" (provincial governor) of Shanxi Province. Empress Dowager Cixi promoted him to Viceroy of Huguang in August 1889.\n\nDuring the Dungan Revolt of 1862–1877, the Russian Empire occupied the Ili region in Xinjiang. After Qing imperial forces successfully crushed the Dungan Revolt, they demanded that the Russians withdraw from Ili, which led to the Ili Crisis.\n\nAfter the incompetent negotiator Chonghou, who was bribed by the Russians, without permission from the Qing government, signed a treaty granting Russia extraterritorial rights, consulates, control over trade, and an indemnity, a massive uproar by the Chinese literati ensued, some of them calling for Chonghou's death. Zhang demanded for Chonghou's execution and urged the Qing government to stand up to Russia and declare the treaty invalid. He said, \"The Russians must be considered extremely covetous and truculent in making the demands and Chonghou extremely stupid and absurd in accepting them... If we insist on changing the treaty, there may not be trouble; if we do not, we are unworthy to be called a state.\" The Chinese literati demanded the Qing government mobilise their armed forces against the Russians. The Qing government allocated important posts to officers from the Xiang Army, while British military officer Charles George Gordon advised the Chinese.\n\nZhang became involved in the First Sino-Japanese War, although not on the frontline. He initially advocated foreign aid from European forces near Tianjin in fighting the Japanese. In October 1894, he telegraphed Li Hongzhang, the Viceroy of Zhili, proposing the purchase of naval equipment, and loans from foreign banks. He further advocated this, and in addition the purchase of arms, alliance with European powers, and the \"clear division of rewards and punishments\" for troops, once the Japanese crossed the Yalu River into China in late October, threatening the northeastern provinces. In early 1895, the Japanese had begun an assault on Shandong, and Zhang telegraphed the governor Li Bingheng in an emergency that suggested fast civil recruitments, the building of strong forts, and the use of landmines, to prevent further Japanese advance. He had also sent arms and munitions to aid the campaign.\n\nZhang held on a strong opinion on the issue of ceding Taiwan to the Japanese, per the 1895 Treaty of Shimonoseki that ended the First Sino-Japanese War. In late February 1895, he made his stance clear to the Qing government, and even offered ideas on how to prevent the loss of Taiwan. He suggested that they take huge loans from the British, who would in turn send their navy to defend Taiwan from the Japanese. In addition, he proposed giving mining rights to the British on Taiwan for about 10 to 20 years. In May 1895, the Qing government ordered all civil and military officials to evacuate Taiwan. Zhang also refused to provide aid to the remaining Qing forces in Taiwan, especially after the fall of Keelung and with Taipei as the sole remaining Qing stronghold in Taiwan. On 19 October 1895, the last of the Qing forces in Taiwan, led by Liu Yongfu, withdrew to Xiamen.\n\nZhang created the Guangdong Naval and Military Officers Academy and the Guangdong Victorious Army (), a regional militia, before 1894. He also established the Hubei Military Academy () in 1896, where he employed instructors from the Guangdong Academy. The majority of the staff were Chinese. He also hired some German officers as instructors.\n\nWhile serving as the governor of Nanjing in 1894, Zhang invited a German training regiment of 12 officers and 24 warrant officers to train the local garrison into a modern military force. In 1896, acting under an imperial decree, Zhang moved to Wuchang to serve as the Viceroy of Huguang, an area comprising Hubei and Hunan provinces. Zhang drew on his experience in Nanjing to modernise the military forces under his command in Huguang.\n\nIn Wuchang, Zhang effectively trained and equipped modern units of sappers, engineers, cavalry, police, artillery and infantry. Of the 60,000 men under his command, 20,000 men were directly trained by foreign officers, and a military academy was established in Wuchang in order to train future generations of soldiers. Zhang armed the troops with German Mauser rifles and other modern equipment. Foreign observers reported that, when their training was complete, the troops stationed in the Wuchang garrison were the equal of contemporary European forces.\n\nDuring the Boxer Rebellion, Zhang, along with some other regional governors who commanded substantial modernised armies, refused to participate in the central government's declaration of war against the Eight-Nation Alliance, Zhang assured the foreigners during negotiations that he would do nothing to help the central government. He told this to Everard Fraser. This clique was known as The Mutual Protection of Southeast China.\n\nZhang's troops later became involved in politics. In 1911, the Wuchang garrison led the Wuchang Uprising, a coup against the local government that catalysed the nationwide Xinhai Revolution. The Xinhai Revolution led to the collapse of the Qing dynasty and its replacement by the Republic of China.\n\nIn 1898, Zhang published his work, \"Exhortation to Study\" (勸學篇). He insisted on a method of relatively conservative reform, summarized in his phrase \"Chinese Learning as Substance, Western Learning for Application\" (中學為體，西學為用). In 1900, he advocated the suppression of the Boxer Rebellion. When the Eight-Nation Alliance entered Beijing, Zhang, along with Li Hongzhang and others, participated in The Mutual Protection of Southeast China. He quelled local revolts and defeated the rebel army of Tang Caichang. He succeeded Liu Kunyi as Viceroy of Liangjiang in 1901, and moved to Nanjing, where he laid the foundations for the modern University of Nanjing. He was appointed the Minister of Military Affairs in 1906, and worked in Beijing for the central government.\n\nHe was aware that a change in Chinese affairs was necessary, and at the same time realized that the Chinese officials and people clung with unyielding tenacity to their ancient ideas and institutions and penned his ideas in a book: \"China's only hope: An Appeal\". The book was distributed to the Grand Council of State, Viceroys, Governors and Literary Examiners of China.\n\nZhang Zhidong's sons were Zhang Yanqing and Zhang Renli.\n\nZhang died of illness in 1909 in Beijing.\n\n"}

He is of Luxembourgish, German, and to an extent Polish, Finnish, and Swedish ancestry. Kartheiser attended Apple Valley High School in Apple Valley, Minnesota, but dropped out at age 15 because he \"wanted to make money.\"\n\nSome of Kartheiser's first acting experiences were on stage of Children's Theatre Company in Minneapolis, including roles in \"Pippi Longstocking\", \"Our Town\", \"Dr. Seuss' The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins\", and \"Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm\".\n\nHe made his screen debut with a bit role in the 1993 film \"Untamed Heart\". Kartheiser found himself cast in mostly family fare, including \"The Indian in the Cupboard\" (1995) and a starring role in the film \"Alaska\" (1996). The film led to Kartheiser getting the lead role in \"Masterminds\" the following year.\n\nHe was next cast as Bobby, a drug-addicted, homeless street urchin in Larry Clark's \"Another Day in Paradise\". He had two explicit sex scenes with Natasha Gregson, one of which was cut from the film in order to avoid an NC-17 rating. The film earned the young actor significant accolades, and he went on to appear in \"Strike!\" (later retitled \"All I Wanna Do\") and \"Crime and Punishment in Suburbia\".\n\nScreened at the 2000 Sundance Film Festival, \"Crime and Punishment in Suburbia\" was a moody, updated take on Dostoyevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\", set in a modern high school.

{"id": "2204977", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2204977", "title": "Sacagawea dollar", "text": "Sacagawea dollar\n\nThe Sacagawea dollar (also known as the \"golden dollar\") is a United States dollar coin first minted in 2000, although not minted for general circulation from 2002 to 2008 and again from 2012 onward due to its general unpopularity with the public and low business demand for the coin. These coins have a copper core clad by manganese brass, giving them a distinctive golden color. The coin features an obverse by Glenna Goodacre. From 2000 to 2008, the reverse featured an eagle design by Thomas D. Rogers. Since 2009, the reverse of the Sacagawea dollar has been changed yearly, with each design in the series depicting a different aspect of Native American cultures. These coins are marketed as \"Native American dollars\".\n\nThe coin was introduced as a replacement for the Susan B. Anthony dollar, which proved useful for vending machine operators and mass transit systems despite being unpopular with the public. The Statue of Liberty was originally proposed as the design subject, but Sacagawea, the Shoshone guide of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, was eventually chosen.\n\nThe new dollar coin was heavily marketed by the Mint in a series of print, radio, and television advertisements, as well as Mint partnerships with Walmart and Cheerios. However, the Sacagawea dollar did not prove popular with the public, and mintage dropped sharply in the second year of production. Production of Sacagawea dollars continued, from 2007 to 2016 in parallel with the U.S. Presidential dollars. In 2012, mintage numbers were reduced by over 90%, in line with a similar reduction for the even more unpopular Presidential Dollars, due to large stockpiles of unused coins from that series.\n\nThe Mint planned to issue the Sacagawea design in 22-karat gold as well, but this idea was quickly abandoned after the Mint's authority to strike the coins was questioned, and the Mint has retained ownership of the few such coins produced. Soon after initial production of the dollar, it was noticed that a few of the dollar coins were erroneously struck with the obverse of a state quarter and the normal reverse.\n\nDue to the limited circulation of the cumbersome Eisenhower dollar, it was decided in 1977 that a smaller dollar coin might see improved circulation and prove more useful to the public. On September 26, 1978, Congress approved legislation to provide for a smaller dollar coin to be minted, which would depict Susan B. Anthony, a prominent American suffragette. These new dollars also proved unpopular, due in large part to their similarity in size and metallic composition to the quarter-dollar. Since there was little interest in the coin as a circulating medium, most were placed in United States Mint and Federal Reserve vaults throughout the country, and mintage ceased after 1981.\n\nDespite their initial lack of popularity, by the mid 1990s the Treasury's supply of Anthony dollars began to dwindle due to their widespread use in vending machines (including more than 9,000 stamp machines situated in post offices across the United States) and increasing usage in mass transit systems throughout the country. Beginning in 1997, several bills were introduced to Congress with the intent of resuming mintage of small-sized dollar coins to keep up with demand. On March 20 of that year, Arizona Republican Representative Jim Kolbe introduced legislation calling for more dollar coins to be minted. Four months later, on July 24, Republican Representative Michael Castle of Delaware, a member of the House Subcommittee on Domestic and International Monetary Policy, also introduced legislation, calling for the Statue of Liberty to be the subject of the design. On October 21, Minnesota Republican Rod Grams introduced a bill in the Senate, also calling for the mintage of a newly designed dollar coin. The final legislation authorizing the design and production of a new dollar coin was based on Grams' bill. Also on October 21, in a hearing before the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Domestic and International Monetary Policy, Trade, and Technology, Treasury Department officials gave their support for a new dollar coin, recommending that it be gold-colored with a distinctive edge, to make it easily distinguishable from the quarter-dollar. During this hearing, Philip N. Diehl, then Director of the Mint, estimated that it would take thirty months to begin production of the new coin.\n\nThe United States Senate approved the necessary legislation on November 9, 1997, and the House of Representatives did the same on November 13. On December 1 President Bill Clinton signed the 50 States Commemorative Coin Program Act, which became Public Law 105–124. Section four of the act, which is entitled \"United States $1 Coin Act of 1997\", provided for a new dollar coin to be struck, stating in part: \"The dollar coin shall be golden in color, have a distinctive edge, have tactile and visual features that make the denomination of the coin readily discernible\". The act also gave authority to the Secretary of the Treasury to resume production of the Susan B. Anthony dollar to fill the demand for dollar coins until production could begin on the newly designed golden dollar. In total, more than 41 million Susan B. Anthony dollars were struck bearing the date 1999.\n\nThough the United States $1 Coin Act of 1997 required a change in composition and edge, it did not dictate what was to appear on the coin. To determine this, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin appointed a nine-member Dollar Coin Design Advisory Committee. Rubin, who had the authority to select the coin's design as Secretary of the Treasury, specified that the coin should depict a representation of one or more women and could not depict a living person. The committee was chaired by Philip N. Diehl, a role that did not include a vote on the designs. They met in Philadelphia in June 1998, listening to seventeen concepts submitted by members of the public, and reviewing many more suggestions received by telephone, mail and email. On June 9, 1998, the committee recommended Sacagawea, the Shoshone guide of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, for the design of the new coin. Despite the committee's choice of Sacagawea, Castle advocated that the Statue of Liberty be depicted, as per his earlier legislation. In a letter to the House of Representatives, Castle explained his objection, stating that the \"goal in creating a new dollar coin is to make it more distinctive with a popular design that would encourage its wider use by the public.\" Between November 18 and 22, 1998, the General Accounting Office conducted a poll on behalf of Castle. The object of the poll was to determine which design the public would find more desirable. In total, 65 percent preferred the Statue of Liberty, 27 percent preferred Sacagawea, two percent believed that either was acceptable, three percent said neither was acceptable, and an additional three percent had no opinion. Despite Castle's objection, Sacagawea was ultimately chosen as the subject of the coin.\n\nInvitations were sent to 23 artists with guidelines as to what their designs should depict. The obverse was to depict a representation of Sacagawea, and the reverse an eagle symbolizing peace and freedom. Another guideline requested artists \"be sensitive to cultural authenticity, and try to avoid creating a representation of a classical European face in Native American headdress.\" In November and December 1998, members of the Native American community, teachers, numismatists, historians, members of Congress, various government officials and others were invited by the United States Mint to review the submitted proposed designs. Six obverse and seven reverse designs were originally selected for further consideration.\n\nAfter the Mint conducted a series of polls and focus groups, three obverse and four reverse designs were selected as finalists. The Mint received approximately 90,000 e-mails in reference to the design selection process. In response to the large amount of feedback generated, Diehl stated that the internet has \"allowed us to conduct a public outreach program of unprecedented scope to measure opinions of the designs.\" All seven of the selected designs were forwarded to the United States Commission of Fine Arts; the Commission chose an obverse design depicting Sacagawea with her infant son, Jean Baptiste Charbonneau, as designed by sculptor Glenna Goodacre. Goodacre chose Randy'L He-dow Teton to model for Sacagawea, of whom there are no known contemporary portraits, to help the artist capture the features of a young Native American woman. The depiction of infant Jean Baptiste Charbonneau was partially modeled after one-year-old Adam Scholz, with assistance from his father, Peter Scholz. The chosen reverse, designed by Mint sculptor-engraver Thomas D. Rogers, depicted a soaring eagle.\n\nOn September 20, 2007, , known as the Native American $1 Coin Act, was signed by president George W. Bush. The act specified in part that the one dollar coin shall depict \"images celebrating the important contributions made by Indian tribes and individual Native Americans to the development of the United States and the history of the United States.\" The act also called for the removal of the date from the obverse and \"\" from the reverse of the coin, opting instead to add them to the edge. At this time the mintmark was also moved to the edge.\n\nThe program requires that the reverse of the dollar depict a new design every year. In order to determine which design to depict on the coins, officials from the United States Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, the Native American Caucus and the National Congress of American Indians, the consulting organizations for the program, appoint a liaison to the United States Mint. Between twelve and fifteen themes are selected after consultation with the National Museum of the American Indian and the Smithsonian Institution. At this point, the consulting organizations supply the Mint with written comments regarding the themes. The suggestions are then sent to the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee, where a theme is recommended. After reviewing the recommendations and input from the contributing organizations, the selected theme is finalized, at which point designs are produced that represent the theme. Once designs are created, the consulting organizations and the National Museum of the Native American are consulted, and the designs are sent to the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee for approval. Based on all comments and recommendations received, the Mint selects a final design that is recommended to the Secretary of the Treasury for approval.\n\nThe first coin in the Native American series, issued in 2009, was designed by Mint sculptor-engraver Norman E. Nemeth, the subject being the spread of Three Sisters Agriculture. It depicts a Native American woman planting seeds in a field populated with corn, beans and squash. Above the woman is the inscription \"\", and below is \"\".\n\nThe design selected for the 2010 reverse was designed by Artistic Infusion Program artist Thomas Cleveland and depicts the Hiawatha belt surrounding five stone-tipped arrows, along with the inscriptions \"\", \"\", \"\" and \"\". The subject of the design is the \"Great Tree of Peace\".\n\nThe reverse of the 2011 dollar depicts the hands of the Supreme Sachem Ousamequin and Plymouth Colony Governor John Carver holding a ceremonial pipe, along with the inscriptions \"\", \"\", and \"\". The coin was designed by Artistic Infusion Program artist Richard Masters and engraved by Mint sculptor–engraver Joseph Menna. The design subject is treaties with tribal nations.\n\nThe theme for the reverse of the 2012 dollar is \"Trade Routes of the 17th Century\" and the design depicts the profile of a Native American man and a horse in the foreground and a group of galloping horses in the background. This reverse design was created by Thomas Cleveland as part of the Artistic Infusion Program and engraved by Mint sculptor–engraver Phebe Hemphill.\n\nThe 2013 dollar commemorates the Treaty with the Lenape in 1778, the first formal treaty between the United States and a Native American tribe. The coin depicts a turkey, a howling wolf, and a turtle—symbols of the Lenape. Its design was created by Susan Gamble as part of the Artistic Infusion Program, and engraved by Phebe Hemphill.\n\nThe 2014 dollar depicts a Native American man clasping a ceremonial pipe while his wife holds a plate of provisions, including fish, corn, roots and gourds. In the background is the stylized image of the face of William Clark's compass, displaying \"NW\" for \"northwest.\" It bears the inscriptions \"\" and \"\", as required by law.\n\nThe reverse design of the 2015 dollar depicts Mohawk ironworkers. According to the U.S. Mint, the coin commemorates Kahnawake and Akwesasne Mohawk ironworkers who contributed to the building of New York City skyscrapers. The inscriptions on the reverse read \"\", \"\" and \".\" It was designed by artist Ronald D. Sanders.\n\nAccording to an August 29, 2014, U.S. Mint press release, the design selected for use on the 2016 coins commemorates Code talkers from World Wars I and II. Designed by Thomas D. Rogers, it includes the inscriptions \", \"\", \"\" and \"\" and depicts two helmets used by American fighting forces in the 20th century — the Brodie helmet of World War I, and the M1 helmet of World War II — along with two feathers which combine to form a V, \"symbolizing victory, unity, and the important role that these code talkers played.\"\n\nOn October 7, 2015, the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee (CCAC) recommended new designs for 2017 and 2018. These were, respectively, Sequoyah and Jim Thorpe.\n\nThe 2019 dollar's theme is \"American Indians in the space program\", depicting Mary G. Ross and John Herrington.\n\nThe 2020 dollar design commemorated the 75th anniversary of Alaska's Anti-Discrimination Act of 1945 and featured the image of Alaskan civil rights advocate and member of the Tlingit Nation Elizabeth Peratrovich.\n\nIn March 2018, the CCAC recommended design themes through 2024. The 2021 dollar's theme will be American Indians in the U.S. military service, 2022 will honor Ely Samuel Parker, 2023 will honor Charles Alexander Eastman, and 2024 will commemorate the 100th anniversary of Indian Citizenship Act of 1924, (also known as the Snyder Act).\n\nAfter her obverse design was approved, Goodacre visited the Philadelphia Mint engraving department six times in order to finalize the designs. Rogers' reverse design was also modified before production began. In his original proposal, mountainous scenery was depicted beneath the flying eagle; this was removed and the positions of other reverse design features were altered before Rubin gave final approval. The composition selected for the new coin included a cladding of manganese brass (containing about 77% copper, 12% zinc, 7% manganese, and 4% nickel) over a pure copper core. This composition was chosen because it would give the coin a distinctive golden color while being electromagnetically identical to its predecessor, the copper-nickel Susan B. Anthony dollar. The first official striking of the Sacagawea dollar took place on November 18, 1999, during a ceremony in which dignitaries and other invited guests each struck individual examples of the coins. Because the coins were struck before 2000, it was not legal to release them during the first strike ceremonies. Instead, the coins were saved and later sent to the dignitaries who struck them. Full-scale production began shortly after the ceremonial strikings.\n\nFor her work creating the obverse of the Sacagawea dollar, Goodacre received a $5,000 commission; she requested that it be paid in dollar coins. The 2000-P dollars paid to Goodacre were struck on specially burnished blanks to give them a finish unique to that striking. Diehl and other Mint dignitaries personally delivered the coins to Goodacre on April 5, 2000. A similar specially burnished finish was used on the 75,000 2000-D dollars included in the Millennium Coin & Currency sets. Soon after release of the new coins, it was discovered that they tarnished quickly once in circulation. In April 2001 the Mint began testing an experimental rinse that would inhibit the tarnishing; however, the rinse was used only in that year.\n\nThe act authorizing the dollar coin also provided for the Secretary of the Treasury to \"adopt a program to promote the use of such coins by commercial enterprises, mass transit authorities, and Federal, State, and local government agencies.\" The Mint's initial advertising campaign, consisting of an estimated 1,600 television, radio and print advertisements and partnerships with the national retail chain Wal-Mart and the General Mills company, cost approximately $41 million. The television ads consisted of the head of George Washington superimposed upon a body, voiced by actor Michael Keaton, discussing the merits of the new dollar coin.\n\nBeginning in January 2000, the Mint began sending dollar coins to Wal-Mart and Sam's Club stores across the United States in order to help promote and circulate the coins. In total, $100 million worth of the dollars were shipped to the stores as part of the promotion. Some store owners criticized the Mint's partnership with Wal-Mart and Sam's Club as being unfair to smaller retailers. In response, Diehl noted that \"every retailer and commercial establishment has the right to carry the Golden Dollar. The Mint's agreement with Wal-Mart is designed to encourage all retailers and commercial businesses in the nation to use the new Golden Dollar in everyday transactions.\"\n\nDuring this time, the Mint began a partnership with the General Mills company, in which 10,000,000 boxes of Cheerios cereal would contain a 2000-dated Lincoln cent as a prize, one in every 2,000 boxes would contain a new Sacagawea dollar and one in every 4,400 would hold a certificate redeemable for 100 Sacagawea dollars. It was later discovered that the dollars included in every 2,000 boxes were in fact early strikes, differing from those ultimately issued for circulation by the number of tail feathers on the eagle. Approximately 5,500 of the coins were included in the boxes of cereal. Far less of these dollars are known, since many may have been spent and entered circulation. Later analysis also showed that an unknown number of them had the normal \"Reverse of 2000\" rather than what collectors called the enhanced tail feathers \"Reverse of 1999\". Thus the fact that a coin came from the cereal box does not guarantee that it is the rare variety.\n\nIn 1999, the Mint struck a number of Sacagawea dollars in .9167 fine (22-karat) gold. During the initial production of the coins, they were denominated at five dollars in order to help the public distinguish them from their circulating counterparts. The plan was to sell gold versions of the coins to collectors. On March 20, this plan was halted when some Congressmen questioned the authority of Mint officials to strike the coins in a composition different from what had already been authorized. Full-scale coin production never took place even though the Mint maintained that it did have authority to do so, as the coins would be considered numismatic items and not regular-issue coins. Similar gold coins were also struck, this time bearing the denomination of one dollar and a \"W\" mint mark of the West Point Mint (although they were actually struck at Philadelphia). In total, 39 such coins were struck, twelve of which were found to be of adequate quality, while the rest were eventually destroyed. Unlike those denominated at five dollars, the one dollar pieces were \"struck to commemorate the historic flight of the Space Shuttle \"Columbia\" in July 1999\", according to Former Mint Director Ed Moy. The twelve surviving gold dollars were sent into space aboard \"Columbia\" on mission STS-93 in July 1999. Following the return of the shuttle, the coins were placed in storage at Fort Knox, where they remained until 2007, when they were exhibited at the American Numismatic Association World's Fair of Money in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. After the event, the coins were returned to Fort Knox; however, the Mint is currently planning to loan the coins to various museums throughout the country.\n\nIn May 2000, an error coin bearing the George Washington obverse design of a U.S. state quarter and the eagle reverse of a Sacagawea dollar was discovered in a roll of dollar coins purchased from a bank in Mountain Home, Arkansas. The undated coin, known as a double-denomination mule, was the first of eleven discovered and authenticated. Mint officials estimate that the coins, which bear the 'P' mint mark for Philadelphia, were struck from late April to early May 2000. They were produced on dollar-coin planchets clad with manganese bronze, not quarter planchets with copper-nickel cladding.\n\nFollowing the initial discovery, a bin containing several thousand of the error coins was impounded at the Philadelphia Mint, and all such coins within it were ordered melted. Some of the coins that had been released were eventually tracked back to a coin-wrapping facility near Philadelphia. Employees at the wrapping facility were instructed to watch for any of the coins; those discovered were turned over to the Mint.\n\nA subsequent federal investigation into the incident found that the error coins had been struck accidentally, but two former Mint employees were guilty of selling some of the dollars, resulting in imprisonment and fines for both individuals. In 2002, Mint officials announced that two of the ten coins then reported had entered circulation through legal channels, but the other eight were of dubious origins and might be seized. However, as of 2011, the federal government has not attempted to seize the eight examples considered of dubious origin.\n\nAs of August 2011, eight of the eleven error coins, including the one initially discovered in Arkansas, are owned by a New Mexico collector who purchased them between 2000 and 2003, paying as high as $75,000 for a single specimen. Of the other three documented mules, one is owned by its discoverer, a Missouri collector, another was purchased by an unnamed collector, and the third, first reported in 2011, was purchased in 2011 by a Chicago dealer from an individual who had owned the coin for about ten years. Sale prices as high as $200,000 have been reported. Three different die combinations have been identified among the eleven available error coins.\n\nThe coin received mixed reviews from the nation's senators. In an interview with Associated Press columnist Suzanne Gamboa, Republican Senator Phil Gramm of Texas described United States currency as \"crummy\". Gramm, who was one of the senators who voted for the bill containing the legislation that authorized it, praised the design of the Sacagawea dollar as being an improvement over the other coin designs then in production. Despite his praise of the design, Gramm condemned the Mint's approach to marketing the coin, stating that if the United States Mint were the Franklin Mint, they would be \"sued for deceptive advertisement.\" He also noted his belief that the Mint had repeated the earlier mistakes of the Susan B. Anthony dollar by issuing a coin that was tailored to the requests of the vending machine industry rather than the average consumer. Texas Republican Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison criticized both the Sacagawea design as well the coin's size in relation to the other coins in circulation at the time. Hutchison felt that the new coin lacked the necessary heft to easily distinguish it from the lower denominations, and that the dollar, as well as the other coins and currency then in circulation \"looks like play money.\" Senators Mike DeWine of Ohio and Byron Dorgan of North Dakota, Republican and Democrat respectively, praised the design and the distinctiveness of the golden color.\n\nThe series proved unpopular in everyday commerce. Mintage dropped by 90% the following year. From 2002 through 2008, Sacagawea dollars were only struck for sale to collectors. The Federal Reserve Bank ordered none of the Native American series after their issuance beginning in 2009. In December 2009, it was noted by a Federal Reserve official that there were currently 857,000,000-dollar coins (including Presidential dollars) in government storage vaults, an amount estimated to satisfy the demand for twelve years. In 2009, with the introduction of the Native American reverse designs, the coins were re-introduced to circulation; however, they again proved unpopular in commerce and following the 2011 issue, treasury secretary Timothy F. Geithner announced that all future dollar coin production would be for numismatic (collecting) purposes only.\n\nIn 2020, after eight years, the Sacagawea dollar will be placed into circulation again. In March 2020, Alaska Governor Mike Dunleavy will sign into law a resolution passed by the state legislature seeking 5 million dollar coins for circulation release in the state in honor of Elizabeth Peratrovich, a native Alaskan activist.\n\nDespite their unpopularity in the United States, the coins have proven popular for commerce in El Salvador and Ecuador, nations that use the United States dollar.\n\nBesides the annual proof and uncirculated sets, Sacagawea dollars with special finishes have also been inserted into several mint packages. These include the following:\n\n"}

It was the last silver coin of that denomination to be struck before passage of the Coinage Act of 1873, which temporarily ended production of the silver dollar for American commerce. The coin's obverse is based on that of the Gobrecht dollar, which had been minted experimentally from 1836 to 1839. However, the soaring eagle used on the reverse of the Gobrecht dollar was not used; instead, the United States Mint (Mint) used a heraldic eagle, based on a design by late Mint Chief Engraver John Reich first utilized on coins in 1807.\n\nSeated Liberty dollars were initially struck only at the Philadelphia Mint; in 1846, production began at the New Orleans facility. In the late 1840s, the price of silver increased relative to gold because of an increase in supply of the latter caused by the California Gold Rush; this led to the hoarding, export, and melting of American silver coins. The Coinage Act of 1853 decreased the weight of all silver coins of five cents or higher, except for the dollar, but also required a supplemental payment from those wishing their bullion struck into dollar coins. As little silver was being presented to the US Mint at the time, production remained low. In the final years of the series, there was more silver produced in the US, and mintages increased.\n\nIn 1866, \"In God We Trust\" was added to the dollar following its introduction to United States coinage earlier in the decade. Seated Liberty dollar production was halted by the Coinage Act of 1873, which authorized the trade dollar for use in foreign commerce. Representatives of silver interests were unhappy when the metal's price dropped again in the mid-1870s; they advocated the resumption of the free coinage of silver into legal tender, and after the passage of the Bland–Allison Act in 1878, production resumed with the Morgan dollar.\n\nThe Mint Act of 1792 made both gold and silver legal tender; specified weights of each was equal to a dollar. The United States Mint struck gold and silver only when depositors supplied metal, which was returned in the form of coin. The fluctuation of market prices for commodities meant that either precious metal would likely be overvalued in terms of the other, leading to hoarding and melting; in the decades after 1792, it was usually silver coins which met that fate. In 1806, President Thomas Jefferson officially ordered all silver dollar mintage halted, though production had not occurred since 1804. This was done in part to prevent the coins from being exported to foreign nations for melting, causing a strain on the fledgling Mint for little gain. Over the next quarter century, the silver coin usually struck for bullion depositors was the half dollar. In 1831, Mint Director Samuel Moore requested that President Andrew Jackson lift the restriction against dollar coin production; the president obliged in April of that year. Despite the approval to strike the coins, no silver dollars were minted until 1836.\n\nThe Bureau of the Mint in the 1830s was undergoing a period of significant change, as new technologies were adopted. In 1828, the Mint, whose authorization had been subject to periodic renewal by Congress since its inception in 1792, was given permanent status. A new building to house the Philadelphia Mint was authorized by Congress, and opened in 1832. Congress adjusted the precious-metal content of US coins in 1834 and 1837, and was able to achieve a balance whereby US coins remained in circulation alongside those of foreign nations (mostly Spanish colonial pieces). In 1836, the first steam machinery was introduced at the Mint; previously coins had been struck by muscle power. Congress had in 1835 authorized branch mints at Dahlonega in Georgia, Charlotte in North Carolina, and at New Orleans in Louisiana. The Charlotte and Dahlonega mints only struck gold, catering to miners in the South who sought to deposit that metal, but the New Orleans facility would also strike silver coins, including the Seated Liberty dollar.\n\nIn mid-1835, newly appointed Mint Director Robert M. Patterson engaged artists Titian Peale and Thomas Sully to create new designs for American coinage. In an August 1, 1835, letter, Patterson proposed that Sully create an obverse design consisting of Liberty seated on a boulder, holding a \"liberty pole\" in her right hand topped by a \"pileus\", the headgear given by the Romans to an emancipated slave. He also asked Sully to create a reverse design consisting of an \"eagle flying, and rising in flight, amidst the constellation irregularly dispersed of twenty-four stars\". Patterson requested that the bird appear natural; he criticized the eagle designs then in use on the nation's coinage as being unnatural primarily because of the shield placed on the eagle's breast. Mint Chief Engraver William Kneass prepared a sketch based on Patterson's conception, but suffered a stroke, leaving him partially paralyzed. Later in 1835, Christian Gobrecht was hired at the Mint as a draftsman, die sinker, and assistant engraver to Kneass. Although nominally a subordinate, Gobrecht would perform much of the engraving work for the Mint until Kneass' death in 1840, when Gobrecht was appointed chief engraver.\n\nSully prepared sketches of the artwork, which Gobrecht used as a guide in engraving copper plates. The plates were approved by various government officials, and the production of trial strikes began. The design was not free from controversy; former Mint Director Samuel Moore had deprecated the use of the \"pileus\". Quoting former president Thomas Jefferson, Moore had written to Secretary of the Treasury Levi Woodbury, \"We are not emancipated slaves.\"\n\nFollowing a series of trial strikes and modifications through 1836, the first of what would come to be known as the Gobrecht dollars were minted in December of that year. The dollars of 1836 were minted with a silver fineness of .892 (89.2%) silver, a specification set forth in the 1792 act. The mandated fineness of US silver coins was changed from .892 to .900 (90%) by the Coinage Act of 1837, passed on January 18, 1837; subsequent Gobrecht dollars were struck in .900 silver. Beginning in 1837, an adaptation of the obverse of the Gobrecht dollar, depicting a seated Liberty, was used on the smaller silver coins (from half dime to half dollar), with Gobrecht's modification of Reich's heraldic eagle on the reverse of the quarter and half dollar. Except on the half dime, abolished in 1873, the designs would remain on those coins for over 50 years.\n\nCoinage continued in small amounts until 1839, when official production of the Gobrecht dollar ceased. The coins had been struck as a trial to gauge public acceptance. The Mint acquired a portrait lathe in 1837, which allowed Gobrecht to work in large models for the later versions of the Gobrecht dollar, and for the Seated Liberty dollar. The lathe, a pantograph-like device, mechanically reduced the design from the model to a coin-size hub, from which working dies could be produced. Prior to 1837, the engraver had to cut the design onto the die face by hand.\n\nPrior to full-scale production of a dollar coin in 1840, Patterson reviewed the designs then in use, including the Gobrecht dollar's. The director opted to replace Gobrecht's soaring eagle reverse with a left-facing bald eagle based on a design by former Mint engraver John Reich, a design first used on silver and gold coinage in 1807. Although the reverse for the dollar was probably selected to match that of the quarter and half dollar, it is not known why the flying eagle design was not used for the lower denominations in the first place. Numismatic historian Walter Breen speculates that a Treasury official might have preferred the Reich design.\n\nThe obverse of the Gobrecht dollar was in high relief, but Mint officials felt that this should be lowered for the new coin, which was to be struck in much larger quantities. Patterson hired Robert Ball Hughes, a Philadelphia artist, to modify the design. As part of Hughes' modifications, Liberty's head was enlarged, the drapery was thickened, and the relief was lowered overall. Thirteen stars were also included on the obverse. On the Gobrecht dollar, with its high relief, the depiction of Liberty appears like a statue on a plinth; the flatter Seated Liberty decreased relief appears more like an engraving.\n\nArt historian Cornelius Vermeule tied the appearance of the obverse to neoclassicism, noting the resemblance of Gobrecht's Liberty to the marble statues of ancient Rome. The neoclassical school was popular in the first half of the 19th century, and not only among official artists; Vermeule noted, \"it becomes almost painfully evident that similar sources were consulted both by the engravers of United States coins in Philadelphia and by the cutters of tombstones from Maine to Illinois\". The reverse retained the shield upon the eagle's breast. Art historian Vermeule described it as \"the same old unnatural, unartistic eagle with shield on his stomach, like a baseball umpire's protector ... to clutch branch and olives in one foot, arrows of war in the other oversized set of claws\". According to numismatic historian David Lange, the Reich-Gobrecht reverse design is known among some coin collectors as the \"sandwich-board eagle\". Breen, in his comprehensive volume on US coins, complains of \"the 'improvements' inflicted by [Hughes] on a hapless Ms. Liberty. Compared with the original Sully-Gobrecht conception of 1836–39, this is a sorry mess indeed.\"\n\nA small production run of 12,500 was minted in July 1840 to allow bullion depositors to become familiar with the new coins before having their silver struck into dollars. The process of bringing the new coin to public hands was made easier by a congressional authorization in 1837 for a fund that allowed the Mint a \"float\", permitting it to give depositors payment in coin without waiting for their metal to go through the minting process. Bullion producers began depositing the silver required to initiate heavier production later in 1840; 41,000 pieces were minted in November, followed by a mintage of 7,505 in December. Deposits increased the following year, which saw a mintage of 173,000 pieces. All coins were produced at the Philadelphia Mint until 1846, when 59,000 were struck at the Mint at New Orleans.\n\nFollowing the discovery of gold in California, a large amount of gold coins began appearing in American commercial channels. The influx caused the price of gold relative to silver to decrease, making silver coins worth more as bullion than as currency. They were exported abroad, or else melted locally for their bullion value. As it was profitable to export silver, little was presented at the Mint, which resulted in low mintage numbers for the silver dollar; 1,300 and 1,100 were struck in 1851 and 1852 respectively. The rarity of these dates was recognized by the late 1850s; Mint employees made surreptitious restrikes to sell to collectors.\n\nCongress passed the Coinage Act of 1853 in February of that year. The act lowered the silver weight of the coins ranging from the half dime to half dollar by 6.9%, though the dollar remained unaffected. The 1853 act eliminated the practice of depositing silver bullion to be struck into coin, except into the dollar for which a coining charge of .5% was imposed. According to the Senate report filed with the bill which became the Coinage Act, these changes were intended as a temporary expedient, with the free coinage of silver to be restored when bullion prices became stable. Sources vary in their explanation as to why Congress chose to exempt the dollar from the silver coinage overhaul: numismatic historian R.W. Julian suggests that it was done due to its status as the \"flagship\" of American coins. According to Don Taxay in his history of the Mint and coinage, \"the silver dollar, which it [the act] left unchanged to preserve a bi-metallic currency, continued to be exported and was rarely used in commerce. Without realizing it, the country had entered onto the gold standard.\" Julian agreed, noting that the act instituted a de facto gold standard in the United States, because it required silver coinage to be paid for in gold. The silver dollar continued to circulate little; quantities were sent west beginning in 1854 to serve as \"small change\" in California. Silver prices remained high into the 1860s, and little silver bullion was presented for striking into dollars. To serve collectors, individual specimens were made available to the public by the Mint at a cost of $1.08.\n\nNumismatist and coin dealer Q. David Bowers believes that most Seated Liberty dollars produced after 1853 were shipped to China to pay for luxury goods, including tea and silk. R. W. Julian argued to the contrary, that continued production of the dollar had little to do with trade with the Orient (where goods were paid for in silver), suggesting instead that the coins were sent to the West for use there. However, although the Mint's Engraving Department sent dies for the dollar to the San Francisco facility repeatedly from 1858 on, the California mint used them only once before 1870, striking 20,000 dollars in 1859, a year in which 255,700 were struck at Philadelphia and 360,000 at New Orleans. Production at New Orleans was disrupted after 1860 by the Civil War; it did not strike silver dollars again until 1879, after the end of the Seated Liberty series. After the outbreak of the war in 1861, inflationary greenbacks were introduced, and precious-metal coins vanished from circulation. In April 1863, new Mint Director James Pollock argued that the silver dollar be eliminated, noting in a letter that the coin \"no longer enters into our monetary system. The few pieces made are for Asiatic and other foreign trade and are not seen in circulation.\"\n\nIn November 1861, Reverend M. R. Watkinson suggested in a letter that some sort of religious motto should be placed on American coinage to reflect the increasing religiosity of United States citizens following the outbreak of the Civil War. In an October 21, 1863, report to Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Chase, Pollock expressed his own desire to emblazon American coins with a religious motto. The Mint began producing patterns bearing various mottoes, including \"God Our Trust\" and \"In God We Trust\"; the latter was ultimately selected, and its first use was on the two-cent piece in 1864.The following year, a law was passed allowing the Treasury to place the motto upon any coin at its discretion. The motto was placed on the silver dollar, as well as various other silver, gold and base metal coins, in 1866.\n\nThe coin shortage continued after the end of the Civil War, due largely to the large war debt incurred by the federal government. As a result, silver coinage began to trade at a significant premium to the now ubiquitous greenbacks. Accordingly, the government was reluctant to issue silver coins. Nevertheless, the Mint continued striking silver, to be stored in vaults until such time as they could enter the marketplace. The Seated Liberty dollar was the first coin to be struck at the Carson City Mint; the first to be issued were 2,303 pieces paid to a Mr. A. Wright on February 11, 1870. The dollar was struck at Carson City from 1870 to 1873, with the largest mintage, 11,758, in 1870. The largest quantity struck at any mint was in 1872 at Philadelphia: 1,105,500, though the mintage in 1871 had also exceeded a million.\n\nBeginning in 1859, large quantities of silver were found in Nevada Territory and elsewhere in the American West. In 1869, Director of the Mint Henry Linderman began advocating the end of the acceptance of silver bullion deposits to be struck into dollars. Although silver dollars were not coined in large numbers, Linderman saw that mining in the West would increase after the completion of the transcontinental railroad, which it did, as US silver production increased from 10 million troy ounces in 1867 to more than 22 million five years later. Linderman foresaw that these activities would increase the supply of silver, causing its price to drop below the $1.2929 per ounce at which the precious metal in the standard silver dollar is worth $1.00. He anticipated that silver suppliers would turn to the Mint to dispose of their product by striking it into dollars. The monetization of that cheap silver, Linderman feared, would inflate the currency and drive gold from commerce because of Gresham's law. Although silver advocates later called the resulting law the \"Crime of '73\" and claimed that it had been passed in a deceitful manner, the bill was discussed during five different sessions of Congress, read in full by both the House of Representatives and the Senate and printed in full on multiple occasions. Once it passed both houses of Congress, it was signed into law by President Ulysses S. Grant on February 12, 1873.\n\nThe Coinage Act of 1873 ended production of the standard silver dollar and authorized creation of the Trade dollar, thus concluding the Seated Liberty dollar series. The Trade dollar was slightly heavier than the standard dollar and was intended for use in payments in silver to merchants in China. Although not meant for use in the United States, a last-minute rider gave it legal tender status there up to $5. When silver prices plummeted in the mid-1870s, millions appeared in circulation, at first in the West and then throughout the United States, causing problems in commerce when banks insisted on the $5 legal tender limit. Other abuses followed, such as purchase by companies for bullion value (by then about $0.80) for use in pay packets. Workers had little option but to accept them as dollars. In response to complaints, Congress ended any status as legal tender in 1876, halted production of the Trade dollar (except for collectors) in 1878, and agreed to redeem any which had not been chopmarked in 1887.\n\nThe 1873 act eliminated the provisions allowing depositors of silver bullion to have their metal struck into standard silver dollars; they could now only receive Trade dollars, which were not legal tender beyond $5. As the price of silver then was about $1.30 per ounce, there was no outcry from silver producers. Beginning in 1874, however, the price dropped; silver would not again sell for $1.2929 or more on the open market in the United States until 1963. Advocates of silver both sought a market for the commodity and believed that \"free silver\" or bimetallism would boost the economy and make it easy for farmers to repay debts. Many in Congress agreed, and the first battle over the issue resulted in a partial victory for silver forces, as the 1878 Bland–Allison Act required the Mint to purchase large quantities of silver on the open market and strike the bullion into dollar coins. The Mint did so, using a new design by Assistant Engraver George T. Morgan, which came to be known as the Morgan dollar. The issue of what monetary standard would be used occupied the nation for the rest of the 19th century, becoming most acute in the 1896 presidential election. In that election, the unsuccessful Democratic candidate, William Jennings Bryan, campaigned on \"free silver\", having electrified the Democratic National Convention with his Cross of Gold speech, decrying the gold standard. The issue was settled for the time by the Gold Standard Act of 1900, making that standard the law of the land.\n\nConsiderable private melting in the early years of the series makes many dates rare; more melting took place when large quantities that had accumulated at the New York Sub-Treasury were sent to Philadelphia in 1861 and 1862 for restriking into smaller denominations. R. S. Yeoman's 2014 edition of \"A Guide Book of United States Coins\" lists no Seated Liberty dollar in collectable condition (very good or better) at less than $280.\n\nThe key dates of the series include the 1866 variety which lacks the motto \"In God We Trust\", of which only two are known; one sold at auction in 2005 for $1,207,500. Another rarity is the 1870 struck at San Francisco (1870-S), of which the mintage is not known as their striking was not recorded in that mint's records. Those records indicate that in May 1870, the San Francisco Mint returned two dollar reverse dies to Philadelphia as mistakenly sent without mint mark, and received two proper replacements. There is no record of any 1870-dated obverse dies for the dollar being sent to San Francisco; nevertheless, the coins exist. Breen, writing in 1988, lists twelve examples known, which he speculates may have been presentation pieces, meant to be inserted in a cornerstone. One sold at auction for $1,092,500 in 2003. A similar mystery attends the 1873-S, which despite the stated mintage of 700, is not known to exist. Two of the pieces were routinely sent to Philadelphia for examination at the 1874 meeting of the United States Assay Commission, but apparently were not preserved. Breen suggests that the remaining mintage may have been melted along with obsolete silver coins.\n\n"}

Vinylon was first developed in Japan in 1939 by Ichiro Sakurada, Ri Sung Gi, and H. Kawakami. Trial production began in 1954 and in 1961 the massive February 8 Vinylon Complex was built in Hamhung, North Korea. Vinylon's widespread usage in North Korea is often pointed to as an example of the implementation of the \"juche\" philosophy, and it is known as the \"juche\" fiber.\n\nVinylon is the national fiber of North Korea and is used for the majority of textiles, outstripping fiber such as cotton or nylon, which is produced only in small amounts in North Korea. Other than clothing, vinylon is also used for shoes, ropes, and quilt wadding.\n\nJapanese-Canadian textile artist Toshiko MacAdam used vinylon in her early works, as it was more economical than nylon.\n\nVinylon is resistant to heat and chemicals but has several disadvantages: being stiff, having a relatively high manufacturing cost, and being difficult to dye.\n\nBetween the years 1910 to 1945, Korea was ruled as a Japanese colony. This fact forced the integration of Korea into the Japanese empire's economic and political spheres. Thus, after the Second Sino-Japanese War began in 1937, Korea was integrated into the Japanese war effort. It was amid Japan's efforts towards creating a more scientific and technologically advanced country for the war when a team of researchers worked to fabricate Vinylon. \n\nThe first successful creation of Vinylon was in 1939, by a Kyoto University research team in Japan. However, Vinylon was later brought to North Korea by Ri Sung-Gi, one of the researchers of the Kyoto University team, amid North Korean campaign aimed at the recruitment of scientists and engineers from South Korea in the period following Korea's liberation from Japan in 1945. He was working as a professor at Seoul National University at the time. During the Korean war, when Seoul was occupied by the Democratic People's Army, Ri was offered a research position in North Korea. Ri Sung-Gi accepted and defected to the North.\n\nAfter the liberation of Korea in 1945, North Korea was under Soviet occupation and thus provided with aid by the Soviets as a means to stabilize the country. Beginning at the end of the Korean War in 1953, the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries began actively providing foreign aid to North Korea. Therefore, the North Korean economy heavily depended on aid from other socialist countries. \n\nHowever, in the 1960s, the aid from the Soviet Union decreased. North Korea was no longer receiving aid in the form of grants, but loans. Hence, the North Korean leadership decided to accelerate efforts towards developing a self-sufficient economy. This resulted in the full mobilization of domestic resources. Beginning in 1961, North Korea launched its First Seven-Year Economic Development Plan, which focused on technological innovations, cultural revolution, improvement of living standards, modernization of the economy, and the facilitation of trade and international economic cooperation. As a result, the North Korean government decided to develop the vinylon industry and build Vinylon City.\n\nIn the early stages of North Korea's history, the government under Kim Il Sung and the official \"juche\" (self-reliance) ideology promoted the idea that the only way to reach the goal of economic independence was through heavy machine industry. The manufacturing of vinylon was therefore taken as a step towards developing North Korea as a modern industrial state. With such an appeal to nationalism, the North Korean government mobilized its citizens for constructing and supporting a new vinylon factory, called Vinylon City.\n\nIn 1961, Vinylon City, the factory compound for producing vinylon, was built in the northeastern industrial city of Hungnam. The construction of the factory took fourteen months, which was quite fast considering that fifty buildings made up Vinylon City. Vinylon City had a total floor space of , 15,000 production machines, 1,700 container tanks, and of piping. The tallest building in Vinylon City measured in height with a smokestack, was the acetic acid shop. The spinning shop, which was responsible of creating the vinylon fiber and shipping, was the largest building — long and wide, with floor space.\n\nVinylon City became the pride of North Korea, being touted as having been built without foreign assistance. The success of Vinylon City demonstrated independence from the Soviet Union and China and appeared to reflect the juche ideology. Even though workers had to complete dangerous tasks and some ultimately lost their lives for the sake of demonstrating the country's capabilities, vinylon thus served as a reinforcement of the party's ideological command and the Kim family's rule.\n\nThe city began with a goal of producing enough fiber to supply the entire country with clothing, shoes, and other necessities, a goal that appears to have been met for several decades. The fiber produced from Vinylon City was considered so important that during the annual commemoration of Kim Il-sung's birthday, the people were given gifts of vinylon clothing. However, the North Korean economy eventually collapsed, and fuel shortages forced the city to close down in 1994. Vinylon City remained closed for sixteen years, until its re-opening in 2010.\n\nOn February 8, 2010, Kim Jong-il visited the former Vinylon City complex in Hamhung to celebrate its reopening. Kim was accompanied by high-ranking officers of the party, such as the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly Kim Yong-nam, Defense Minister Kim Young-chun and Korean Workers’ Party secretaries Kim Ki-nam and Choi Tae-bok. This was the first documented time he ever attended an industrial mass rally. While his attendance, and that of the most important party members, could signify the importance of the vinylon complex and its role in advancing the economic policies of Kim Jong-il, there is evidence that the facility could play a role in the North Korean nuclear weapons program. Based on an analysis of satellite imagery, information from Ko Chong-song (a North Korean official who had defected), and a number of North Korean technical documents, there is speculation that the Hamhung plant is manufacturing unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine, a rocket fuel that is used in North Korean long-range missiles.\n\nAlthough vinylon was initially used to help develop the North Korean economy as a home-grown product, it also became intertwined with juche nationalism. As a result, vinylon became a firm part of the North Korean national identity.\n\n"}

Williamson usually writes and performs songs that relate to the history and culture of Australia, particularly the outback, in a similar vein to Slim Dusty and Buddy Williams before him. Williamson has released over fifty albums, ten videos, five DVDs, and two lyric books and has sold more than 4,000,000 albums in Australia. His best known hit is \"True Blue\". On Australia Day (26 January) in 1992 Williamson was made a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) with the citation: \"for service to Australian country music and in stimulating awareness of conservation issues\". He has received twenty-six Golden Guitar trophies at the Country Music Awards of Australia, he has won three ARIA Music Awards for Best Country Album and, in 2010, was inducted into the related Hall of Fame.\n\nJohn Robert Williamson was born on 1 November 1945 at Kerang Bush Nursing Hospital to Keith Williamson and Shirley Ellen (née Manuel). He grew up in Quambatook, in the Mallee district of north-western Victoria. His parents farmed wheat crops on various small land lots in the region and were both amateur performing artists: singing in local Gilbert and Sullivan productions. Williamson is the oldest of five sons with Robin as the third oldest.\n\nWilliamson's performance style originates from his 'farmland, not city bitumen' lifestyle, and his upbringing is referred to by the nickname, 'The Mallee Boy'. His early musical influences were Roger Miller and Rolf Harris, both of whom provided inspirational elements for his first hit, namely using a vocal imitation from Miller's \"Dang Me\" and replacing Rolf's wobble board with a Jaw's Harp. From the age of seven he learned to play the ukulele from his father, before proceeding when he was twelve to guitar and taught himself to play harmonica. For the last four years of secondary schooling Williamson attended Scotch College in Melbourne. In the early 1960s, while still at college, he formed a folk music group. After schooling Williamson returned home to become a farmer and, in 1965, the family moved to Croppa Creek, near Moree, where Williamson began performing at a local restaurant.\n\nIn 1969 John Williamson wrote a novelty song, \"Old Man Emu\", and early the following year he performed the track on TV talent quest, \"New Faces\", winning first place. He later reflected on his songwriting process, and the importance of his guitar, \"no matter where I go I'll have one with me, in case I come up with a song, I've got to have the guitar straight away. I always write the words and the music together\". In early 1970 he signed a recording contract with Fable Records owner and \"New Faces\"s judge, Ron Tudor. In May \"Old Man Emu\" was released as a single on Tudor's label, which peaked at No. 3 on the \"Go-Set\" National Top 60. It was awarded a gold certification and was listed at No. 14 on \"Go-Set\"s Top Records for the Year of 1970. His self-titled debut album followed in mid-year and, although it featured \"Old Man Emu\", it had little commercial success: only selling two-thousand copies. Since \"Old Man Emu\" was his only hit he had to perform it two or three times per gig. Williamson's follow-up single, \"Under the Bridge\" was issued in November. It was pressed with its A and B sides reversed. By February 1971 the album's third single, \"Beautiful Sydney\", appeared. A string of non-album singles followed including, in March 1972, \"Misery Farm\" with Lumpy Pumpkin.\n\nIn 1973 Williamson hosted a country music TV series, \"Travlin' Out West\", which ran for two years, broadcast by NBN-3, Newcastle. He performed with two regular acts, Ricky & Tammy, and Emma Hannah. The program provided two albums for the regulars, \"Travlin' Out West in Concert\" (1973) and \"From Travlin' Out West\" (1974) issued by Reg Grundy Productions. In 1976 he issued his second album, \"The Comic Strip Cowboy\", but it failed to chart. In early 1978, Williamson released his first compilation album under the \"Country Greats\" series. This was followed later in the year by his third album, \"Road to Town\", with contributions by other musicians including Tommy Emmanuel on guitar. Also that year Williamson formed a country music band, Crow, which performed on the pub and club circuit across Australia. In 1980 Crow were renamed as Sydney Radio, to play rock music with a reggae influence. The members used face paint, with Williamson disguised as the clown, Ludwig Leichhardt. Williamson penned rock and reggae numbers for the band some of which were recorded but never released. Since 1970 Williamson has had a friendship with radio presenter, John Laws, who calls Williamson his 'little brother'. In 1977, Williamson recorded and released a single, \"It's a Grab It While It's Goin' Kind of Life\", which is a musical tribute to Laws. Up until Laws' first retirement on 25 June 2007, Williamson wrote and performed a series of jingles for Laws' morning show on 2UE, and his final jingle was \"Hey good on ya Lawsie, you pulled the plug at last\". Laws made a successful comeback to radio broadcasting in February 2011, this time at 2SM, part of the Super Radio Network, and Williamson's jingles for his programme resumed.\n\nIn early 1981 John Williamson's rock group, Sydney Radio, disbanded and he began playing solo in pubs, which attracted more new fans. He recorded a tribute song for ANZACs, \"Diggers of the ANZAC (This Is Gallipoli)\", which was well received and issued as a single. Williamson met Pixie Jenkins, a fiddle player, and the two toured together for several years. In April 1981 Williamson issued a single, \"The Breaker\", featuring narrated vocals by Charles 'Bud' Tingwell, which was inspired by the movie, \"Breaker Morant\" (1980) (which had Tingwell as a supporting actor). \"The Breaker\" enabled Williamson to cast off the \"Old Man Emu\" novelty tag and \"[h]is long apprenticeship flowed into an apparently endless set of songs charming Australians with stories and images about themselves and their country\". In 1982, he recorded a new track, \"True Blue\", which was included on a compilation album, \"True Blue: The Best of John Williamson\". Later that year, he issued \"Fair Dinkum J.W.\", featuring traditional Australian ballads, \"With My Swag upon My Shoulder\", \"Botany Bay\" and \"Brisbane Ladies\"; as well as originals, \"Country Football\", \"Kill the Night\", \"Wrinkles\" and \"(You've Gotta Be) Fair Dinkum\", a duet with Karen Johns.\n\nIn 1983 Williamson released his first solo live album, \"Singing in the Suburbs\" and another live album, \"The Smell of Gum Leaves\", in September 1984. It featured another comic track, \"I'm Fair Dinkum\". Williamson then launched his merchandise business, The Fair Dinkum Road Company, in Sydney. The album included his cover version of Spectrum's 1971 single, \"I'll Be Gone\", which he played using only guitar and harmonica. At the start of 1985 he founded an independent record label, Gumleaf Recordings. At the Country Music Awards of Australia in January that year, he won 'Song of the Year' for \"Queen in the Sport of Kings\". He then issued a new compilation, \"Humble Beginnings\", featuring tracks from his first three studio albums. He released another studio album that year, \"Road Thru the Heart\". At the Country Music Awards of Australia in January 1986, he won 'Album of the Year' for \"Road Thru the Heart\" and 'Male Vocalist of the Year' for \"You and My Guitar\". In July 1986, Williamson released another compilation, \"All the Best!\" which contained eighteen of his most-requested tracks both from studio and live works. As a bonus, Williamson collaborated with both of his daughters, Ami and Georgie, and with Australian folk group Bullamakanka on \"Goodbye Blinky Bill\" – highlighting the comic koala character of the same name. When issued as a single, the purchase price included an A$1.00 donation to the Koala Preservation Society in Port Macquarie. At the Country Music Awards of Australia in January 1986, he won 'Album of the Year' for \"Road Thru the Heart\" and 'Male Vocalist of the Year' for \"You and My Guitar\".\n\nIn November 1986 Williamson's Gumleaf Recordings distributed his breakthrough album, \"Mallee Boy\", which peaked in the Top 10 on the Kent Music Report Albums Chart. It remained in the top 50 for a year-and-a-half, and was awarded a triple platinum certificate. It was \"filled with storytelling that spanned from his own beginnings on that farm in the Victorian Mallee to every corner of the nation\". At the ARIA Music Awards of 1987, \"Mallee Boy\" was named the inaugural winner of Best Country Album. At the Country Music Awards of Australia in January 1987, he won 'Album of the Year' for \"Mallee Boy\" and 'Male Vocalist of the Year' for \"True Blue\". Popular tracks include the title song, \"Galleries of Pink Galahs\" (see Galah), \"Raining on the Rock\" (see Uluru) and \"Cootamundra Wattle\" (see \"Acacia baileyana\"). The album had a re-recorded version of \"True Blue\" which was released as a single in September. Williamson was asked by the Australian Made Campaign whether they could use \"True Blue\" for their TV and radio ads. It became a career highlight and was adopted as a theme by the Australia national cricket team. To support \"Mallee Boy\" Williamson performed his concerts in a camp fire setting and since that time he commences many of his shows with its title track. At the Country Music Awards of Australia in January 1988, he won 'Top Selling Album' for \"Mallee Boy\".\n\nIn April 1988 Williamson issued his seventh studio album, \"Boomerang Café\", which peaked at No. 10 on the Kent Music Report. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1989, \"Boomerang Café\" won his second award for Best Country Album. At the Country Music Awards of Australia in January 1989, he won 'Top Selling Album' and 'Album of the Year' for \"Boomerang Café\". Despite the title song's lyrics, Williamson has told concert audiences that he did not actually meet his future wife, Mary-Kay, in The Boomerang Cafe but actually by a water tank. Williamson performed at the opening of the New Parliament House. In September 1989, he issued \"Warragul\" (meaning dingo in the Wiradjuri language), which became his first number-one album the following month. That same year Variety Club named him 'Entertainer of the Year'.\n\nAt the Country Music Awards of Australia for 1990, John Williamson won 'Top Selling Album' and 'Album of the Year' for \"Warragul\", and 'Heritage Award' for \"Drover's Boy\". At the ARIA Music Awards of 1990, \"Warragul\" earned his third Best Country Album award. In October 1990 Williamson released \"JW's Family Album\" which reached No. 21. In 1990 a new version of \"Old Man Emu\" appeared as a single, with a new lyric added: \"He can run the pants off a dingo too\". In September 1992 his next album, \"Waratah St\", was released it reached No. 14 on the ARIA Albums Chart, and had received a gold certificate on pre-sale orders. At the Country Music Awards of Australia in January 1992, he won 'Top Selling Album' for \"JW's Family Album\".\n\nLate in 1991 he combined with other country musicians, Slim Dusty, Joy McKean, Phil Matthews and Max Ellis to organise the founding of the Country Music Association of Australia (CMAA), which \"would fight for the interests of the Australian country music industry particularly in regard to the Awards\". It was launched in January 1992 with Dusty as inaugural chairman and Williamson as vice-chairman and later that year CMAA took over the organisation of the Country Music Awards of Australia – established in 1973 – from radio station, 2TM based in Tamworth. Williamson's compilation, \"Australia Calling – All the Best Vol 2\", was released in October, which peaked at number 32 and was certified platinum. Its lead single, \"Australia Calling\", was also released while another new track was the studio recording of \"I'll Be Gone\", and was used to raise awareness for homeless youth. At the beginning of 1993, Williamson issued \"Love is a Good Woman\", a compilation of his love songs, with new tracks \"Good Woman\" and \"Misty Blue\". In September that year, after watching the TV announcement that Sydney had won the bid to host the 2000 Summer Olympics, Williamson wrote \"Sydney 2000\" and was invited to perform it on the steps of the Sydney Opera House. A year later, it was recorded for his next album, \"Mulga to Mangoes\", which peaked at No. 14. Associated singles were \"Seven Year Itch\", \"River Crying Out\" and \"Tropical Fever\".\n\nAt the Country Music Awards of Australia in January 1995, he won 'Video Track of the Year' for \"Tropical Fever\" – directed by Mark Jago. During the year he celebrated twenty-five years in the Australian music industry with a new compilation, \"True Blue – The Very Best of John Williamson\", which reached the top 30. It included two new tracks, \"Bush Town (The Lawnmower Song)\" and \"No-one Loves Brisbane Like Jesus\". At that time, he published his book, \"True Blue: Stories and Songs of Australia\", which contains the lyrics of his songs and explanations of their composition. Williamson was surprised at the book's launch by Mike Munro as part of the TV documentary series, \"This is Your Life\". He appeared on the series again in 2000 when Slim Dusty was the subject of an episode. At the Country Music Awards of Australia in January 1996, Williamson won 'Top Selling Album' for \"Mulga to Mangoes\". He released \"Family Album No.2\" in September 1996.\n\nIn January the following year he was inducted to the Country Music Association of Australia's Roll of Renown. Williamson's thirteenth studio album \"Pipe Dream\" was released in August 1997 and peaked at No. 6. At the Country Music Awards of Australia for 1998 he won 'Top Selling Album' for \"Pipe Dream\". \"Sir Don\", his tribute to cricketer Donald Bradman, is on the album. Williamson performed \"Raining on the Rock\" as a duet with Warren H Williams. The following year, at the Australian Country Music Awards, the pair won 'Collaboration of the Year'. Williamson soon took part in his short-lived television series on the Seven Network called \"The Bush Telegraph\". Following this for a moderate period, Williamson continued touring Australia and was also releasing a series of compilations. In July 1999 his fourteenth studio album, \"The Way It Is\" was released and peaked at No. 10, it went gold after eight weeks. At the end of 1999, he published his first calendar, by using photography from Steve Parish.\n\nAt the Country Music Awards of Australia for 2000 John Williamson won 'Top Selling Album' for \"The Way It Is\", 'Heritage Song of the Year' for \"Campfire on the Road\" and 'Bush Ballad of the Year' for \"Three Sons\". He released his next compilation album, \"Anthems – A Celebration of Australia\" in August 2000, which peaked at No. 16. A new single, \"This Ancient Land\", was recorded with country music veteran, Jimmy Little, for Corroboree that year. Other anthem tracks include \"A Number on My Back\" for the national rugby union team, Wallabies, and \"The Baggy Green\" with vocals by national cricket captain Steve Waugh. Also on the album are \"Waltzing Matilda 2000\" and a studio recording of \"Advance Australia Fair\" for the first time. He was invited to perform at the opening ceremony of the Sydney 2000 Summer Olympics.\n\nWilliamson performed \"Sir Don\" at Bradman's Memorial Service in Adelaide in 2001. The original scraps of paper he used to compose the track are displayed in the Bradman Museum, Bowral. He also represented Australia when performing at the Opening Ceremony of Winterlude in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. In April 2002, Williamson released his fifteenth studio album, \"Gunyah\", which in the traditional Aboriginal language means 'home'. The opening track \"Sing You the Outback\" revealed how important the Australian outback has been in the past and how invaluable it will be into the future. The next two tracks, \"Frangipani Bay\" and \"Cape York Peninsula\", were written during a road trip to Australia's most northern point. The lyrics in \"The Devil's Boots\" relate to the bushranger, Ned Kelly. \"Buried in Her Bedclothes\" was written after Williamson and Mary-Kay, his spouse of the time, met an elderly woman on an Indian Pacific rail trip. Her husband had died six months earlier and she had refused to get out of bed for three months. Her family suggested the train trip as a remedy – she shared her memories with the Williamsons and said that the train 'had done the job'.\n\nWilliamson referred to 2003 as his 'most True Blue year ever'. He was elected President of the CMAA after Dusty retired. He then released the sequel to the 1995 compilation \"True Blue Two\", which reached No. 8. It featured his hit songs up to the \"Gunyah\" album and exclusively including five new tracks. On 12 October, Williamson was asked by the Prime Minister, John Howard, to perform \"Waltzing Matilda\" at the Memorial Service for the first Anniversary of the 2002 Bali bombings.\n\nAt the Country Music Awards of Australia for 2004 Williamson and Sara Storer won 'Vocal Collaboration of the Year' and 'Single of the Year' for \"Raining on the Plains\", and the track won 'Song of the Year' which was shared with Storer and her co-writers, Garth Porter and Doug Storer. The track is on Storer's 2002 album, \"Beautiful Circle\". With regard to new arrangements of John's songs, having recorded a cover version of Stan Coster's \"Wobbly Boot Hotel\" on \"Waratah St\" in 1991, he re-recorded it in 2004 as a duet with Coster's daughter Tracy on \"Coster Country\", her tribute album to him. 2005 was a productive year for John in terms of recording and touring; he re-recorded \"Wrinkles\" as a duet with John Stephan, issued a twenty-track compilation of Queensland-themed songs, called \"From Bulldust to Bitumen\", available only to RACQ members, and in August, \"Chandelier of Stars\" was released, which reached No. 11 on the ARIA Albums Chart. At the Country Music Awards of Australia for 2006 he won 'Album of the Year' and 'Top Selling Album' for \"Chandelier of Stars\", and the track \"Bells in a Bushman's Ear\" won 'Bush Ballad of the Year'.\n\nIn discussing John's wife of the time, the opening track, \"Little Girl from the Dryland\", describes Mary-Kay and her childhood in Tulloona Bore, south of Boggabilla, from her point of view. \"Chandelier of Stars\" is a description of the night sky before sunrise. \"Bells in a Bushman's Ear\" is a tribute to Australia's country music forefathers, and \"The Camel Boy\" is about the life of indigenous artist, Albert Namatjira, who is Warren H Williams' great uncle. \"Keeper of the Stones\", which first appeared on Williamson's live album and DVD of 2004, \"Mates on the Road\", was dedicated to indigenous Australians of The Stolen Generation. \"Desert Child\", another duet with Williams is a bush lullaby for Aboriginal children. Also on \"Chandelier of Stars\" is \"A Country Balladeer\" which is a duet with Chad Morgan, and \"Flower on the Water\" is a tribute to the victims of the Bali bombings. The first four lines are inspired by words on a photo of a deceased victim: \"To hear your voice, to see you smile / To sit and talk to you awhile / To be together the same old way / That would be our greatest wish today\". Williamson found the author and started a friendship.\n\nThe following November, Williamson released the new song \"We Love This Country\" on a compilation of the same name with his favourite holiday songs to promote Australian tourism with caravans – it became a jingle for Jayco commercials. He promoted the aforementioned projects of 2005 together with Pixie Jenkins and Warren H. Williams as part of their True Blue Reunion Tour. In August 2006, \"The Platinum Collection\", a three-disc set of Williamson's hits from 1970 - 2005 was released. In September, Williamson was devastated after hearing of the death of fellow wildlife conservationist and friend, Steve Irwin. In reaction to the news, he wrote a tribute tune, \"Wildlife Warriors: It's Time\". He was evidently emotional while performing both \"Home Among the Gum Trees\" and \"True Blue\" at Irwin's memorial service inside the arena of his Australia Zoo Crocoseum. The service was filmed live-to-air and later released on DVD. \"Wildlife Warriors\" was additionally released in November 2006 on a compilation album of the same name, along with twelve of Williamson's favourite conservation awareness tracks and his two live performances from Irwin's memorial.\n\nAt the beginning of 2008 Williamson decided to put together a musical. Based on his music and lyrics, the book by Simon Heath and directed by Bernie Zelvis, Williamson named it \"Quambatook – The Musical\". On 7 February 2008, the musical was premiered at the EVAN Theater in Penrith to positive reviews, making it a major highlight in the history of Australian musical theatre.\n\nThe album \"Hillbilly Road\" was released in August 2008. The lyrics for the album were inspired by his home in Springbrook. Subsequent singles that followed were \"Cydi\", \"Drink a Little Love\", \"Australia Is Another Word for Free\" as a trio with Williams and Amos Morris, and \"Better Than a Picture\". \"The Joy Is in the Journey\" was a special bonus addition to finish the album, previously appearing on the Quambatook Musical soundtrack. The \"Hillbilly Road\" album was promoted everywhere around Australia until early the next year when Williams decided to move on and pursue other musical projects, leaving Williamson to perform the rest of the tour solo. At the Country Music Awards of Australia for 2009 he won 'Bush Ballad of the Year' for \"Australia Is Another Word for Free\", performed by Williamson, Williams and Morris.\n\nBy late 2009 Williamson got together with fellow country star Adam Harvey and recorded their cover to Roger Miller's \"King of the Road\", issued both as a single and on Harvey's duets album \"Both Sides Now\". Williamson then made his Carols By Candlelight debut at the Sidney Myer Music Bowl.\n\nOn 26 January (Australia Day) 2010 Williamson released a new Australian anthem called \"Island of Oceans\" as a duet with Shannon Noll. Williamson released a new double-CD compilation album \"\" commemorating this milestone. At a press conference for the album in Tamworth on 21 January hosted by the then Governor-General Quentin Bryce, in his acceptance speech, John expressed his gratitude for the longevity of his career up to that point, in the process thanking his fans, friends and family, including his first wife, Mary-Kay.\n\nOn 28 January 2011 Williamson released a recording of a concert with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra at the Sydney Opera House. At the Australian Country Music Awards in Tamworth that same month John presented Jimmy Little with the Lifetime Achievement\nAward.\n\nIn January 2012, Williamson released \"The Big Red\". The first two singles lifted from the work are \"Hang My Hat in Queensland\" and the title track. Early in 2013 \"Prairie Hotel Parachilna\" was released. In 2013, a new two-disc set of John's hits, \"Hell of a Career\" was released. In 2014, Williamson released his fiftieth album (including compilations) called \"Honest People\", as well as writing his autobiography, issued by Penguin. Both were released on 25 July 2014. As well as this, he made his debut as an exhibitionist painter. In 2014, it was announced by John via \"A Current Affair\" that he has been diagnosed with prostate cancer.\n\nIn April 2016, he released an EP called \"Looking for a Story\", a new ANZAC tribute and six other sets of previously issued lyrics. John released his twentieth studio album \"Butcherbird\" in August 2018.\n\n\nOn Australia Day 1992 John Williamson was made a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) with the citation: \"for service to Australian country music and in stimulating awareness of conservation issues\". In the 2006 book, \"1001 Australians You Should Know\", music journalists, Toby Creswell and Samantha Chenoweth describe him as \"[o]ne of the most popular songwriters in Australia ... [h]e has been a voice for the people of the bush and he has been a voice of dissent, openly criticising the woodchip industry\". He is also a Protect Our Coral Sea Ambassador.\n\nIn mid-2015, Williamson was nominated for the 2015 Sounds of Australia competition by veteran Australian TV presenter and journalist Steve Liebmann.\n\nThese annual awards were established by Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) in 1982 to honour the achievements of songwriters and music composers, and to recognise their songwriting skills, sales and airplay performance, by its members annually. John Williamson has won three APRA Music Awards, in the allied categories 'Most Performed Australasian Country Work' and 'Most Performed Country Work'.\n\nThe ARIA Music Awards are presented annually from 1987 by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA). John Williamson has won four awards from twelve nominations, including his induction into the ARIA Hall of Fame on 27 October 2010. He has won the 'Best Country Album' category three times, including the inaugural award in 1987, from six nominations.\n\nThese annual awards have been presented since 1973 and have been organised by Country Music Association of Australia (CMAA) from 1993, to \"encourage, promote and recognise excellence in Australian country music recording\". From that time the recipient's trophy has been a Golden Guitar. John Williamson has won twenty-seven Country Music Awards of Australia, including induction into their Roll of Renown in 1997.\nIn the early 1970s John was living in Leichhardt and met Mary-Kay Price. Her parents had farmed on Tulloona Plain between Moree and Goondiwindi, and her father was a World War II soldier-settler. In 1973, Williamson married Mary-Kay on her parents' farm. The couple have two daughters, Ami and Georgie. Ami recalled \"[w]hen Dad was away, he was really away\". Over his career Williamson has written some love songs for Mary-Kay including \"Little Girl from the Dryland\". On 23 April 2007, after more than 30 years of marriage, Williamson and Mary-Kay divorced. Williamson admitted that he preferred Springbrook in south-east Queensland to unwind and get inspiration for new material.\n\nFollowing his marriage break-up, Williamson formed a relationship with a new partner, Meg Doyle, who organises some of his activities. The couple divide their time living together between Springbrook and their Sydney apartment and were married in March 2013. His daughter, Ami, is also a musician, who has toured with Williamson. In early 2008, she toured Australian Defence Force bases in Iraq and Afghanistan to play to troops: she appeared on two episodes, \"Show of Force\", on \"Australian Story\" (May 2008) describing the tour. Williamson also appeared on the same episodes he had advised his daughter \"to sing stuff that's going to be good for the boys\". Ami explained her motivation for going \"I've got, you know, a history of entertainers in my family ... [who] have performed for the military, my dad has, so I feel like I've taken the baton, which is cool\".\n\nIn terms of his political views, Williamson is a republican.\n\nWilliamson has stated in interviews that he does not like cats because of their lazy, selfish and sometimes destructive behaviour. \"Bill the Cat\" from \"Warragul\" is a humorous presentation of a serious message that points out the damage that feral cats do to wildlife.\n\nHis middle brother Robin died of cancer in 1999. Williamson's 2002 album \"\"Gunyah\"\", in particular the track \"Salisbury Street\", was dedicated to Robin. Salisbury Street was the location of their second home in Quambatook.\n\n\"Call Me Blue\" from the nineteenth album, \"Honest People\", was written in reaction to the verbal abuse that Williamson received after resigning as president of the CMAA. He gave up the position of his own volition, unhappy with the \"growing influence of American music\".\n\nJohn Williamson has written or co-written the following:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2205052", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2205052", "title": "Eleotridae", "text": "Eleotridae\n\nEleotridae is a family of fish commonly known as sleeper gobies, with about 34 genera and 180 species. Most species are found in the tropical Indo-Pacific region, but there are also species in subtropical and temperate regions, warmer parts of the Americas and near the Atlantic coast in Africa. While many eleotrids pass through a planktonic stage in the sea and some spend their entire lives in the sea; as adults, the majority live in freshwater streams and brackish water. One of its genera, \"Caecieleotris\", is troglobitic. They are especially important as predators in the freshwater stream ecosystems on oceanic islands such as New Zealand and Hawaii that otherwise lack the predatory fish families typical of nearby continents, such as catfish. Anatomically, they are similar to the gobies (Gobiidae), though unlike the majority of gobies, they do not have a pelvic sucker.\n\nLike the true gobies, they are generally small fish that live on the substrate, often amongst vegetation, in burrows, or in crevices within rocks and coral reefs. Although goby-like in many ways, sleeper gobies lack the pelvic fin sucker and that, together with other morphological differences, is used to distinguish the two families. The Gobiidae and Eleotridae likely share a common ancestor and they are both placed in the order Gobiiformes, along with a few other small families containing goby-like fishes.\n\n\"Dormitator\" and \"Eleotris\", two of the most widespread and typical genera, include a variety of species that inhabit marine, estuarine and freshwater habitats. Among the largest members of the family are predatory species such as the bigmouth sleeper (\"Gobiomorus dormitor\") at up to from freshwater near the West Atlantic region and the fat sleeper (\"Dormitator maculatus\"), which grows to and is widely found in fresh to brackish and shallow marine waters of the southeastern United States and Mexico, However, most are much smaller, such as the fresh- and brackish-water species from Australia and New Guinea, including \"Hypseleotris\", known locally as gudgeons (not to be confused with the Eurasian freshwater cyprinid \"Gobio gobio\", also known as the gudgeon and after which the Australian sleeper gobies were likely named). A few of these, such as the empire gudgeon (\"H. compressa\") and peacock gudgeon (\"Tateurndina ocellicauda\"), are sometimes kept in aquariums. The smallest in the family are the Amazonian \"Leptophilypnion\" with a standard length of less than .\n\nThe family has been divided into three subfamilies: Butinae, Eleotrinae and Milyeringinae. However, because of the deep divergence between the three, some authorities have recommended splitting them into separate families: Butidae, Eleotridae and Milyeringidae. The 5th edition of Fishes of the World follows this classification and this means that the following genera are currently included within the Eleotridae. However, the family Xenisthmidae is regarded as a synonym of the Eleotridae, according to the 5th Edition of Fishes of the World.\n\n"}

It was also sponsored by the Bendix home appliance division of Avco early in its run, and Clorets and Chicken of the Sea tuna midway through its run. The show's second run sponsor, Ralston Purina, also sponsored \"Ethel and Albert\", the program that replaced \"The Name's the Same\" on the ABC schedule.\n\nRobert Q. Lewis was the original host and moderator from December 5, 1951 to August 31, 1954. During three separate personal vacation breaks, in 1953 and 1954, Conrad Nagel, Brian Aherne and Clifton Fadiman substituted for Lewis. After Lewis' final show, where he implied the show's future was in doubt, \"The Name's the Same\" went on hiatus, giving Lewis more time to devote to his daytime variety shows on CBS which Swanson decided to sponsor in place of this show. (Announcer Lee Vines continued with Lewis on CBS.)\n\n\"The Name's the Same\" returned on October 25 with a new set and Ralston Purina joined as the sponsor. During this 39-week run the moderators changed thrice. Dennis James hosted for 18 weeks, through April 4; Bob and Ray shared the moderators duties for 10 weeks, from April 11 to June 21; Clifton Fadiman returned to the emcee's chair on June 28, hosting for 11 weeks through the final episode on October 7.\n\nThe only panelist to remain for the shows entire run was New York-based actress and socialite Joan Alexander. The original two co-panelists with Alexander were comic Abe Burrows and composer Meredith Willson. Burrows left the show in November 1952, a victim of the Red Scare and comedian Jerry Lester took his seat, followed by comedian Carl Reiner on April 14, 1953. Willson stayed on until July 1953, and his place on the panel was taken by ABC sportscaster Bill Stern. On September 15, 1953, Reiner left and Alexander and Stern were joined by New York radio personality Gene Rayburn.\n\nOn February 9, 1954, the panels makeup was adjusted and Bess Myerson, Miss America 1945, was added to the panel to replace Bill Stern and a fourth panelist was added to the game. That fourth panelist was originally Sherlock Holmes portrayer Basil Rathbone, but he left on April 6 and was replaced by \"Texaco Star Theater\" regular Arnold Stang. Stang then left on May 18 and was replaced by humorist Roger Price, who stayed on until the final episode.\n\nIn January 1955, Rayburn and Meyerson left the panel and were replaced by \"The Jackie Gleason Show\"'s Audrey Meadows and \"New York Herald Tribune\" columnist and future \"To Tell The Truth\" regular Hy Gardner. Gardner was replaced by actor Walter Slezak in March 1955, who in turn left in July due to a time slot switch. Mike Wallace, then a fledgling journalist, took over as the last permanent panelist.\n\nMany familiar faces of the era were guest panelists, including Bill Cullen, Morey Amsterdam, Dane Clark and Hans Conried and Cliff Norton.\n\nEach standard round featured a contestant who had a \"famous name\": the contestants full name was the same as either an actual person (\"Jane Russell,\" \"Abraham Lincoln,\" \"Napoleon Bonaparte\"), a place (\"Virginia Beach,\" \"Monte Carlo\"), a thing (\"A. Lap,\" \"A. Table,\" \"Ruby Lips\", “A. Mattress”), or an action (\"I. Draw\", \"Will Kiss\").\n\nIt was always made clear that the names used on the show were authentic. The shows legal experts would check birth certificates, hospital records and other forms of verification to affirm the names authenticity.\n\nThe contestant was introduced and referred to throughout the game as \"Mr. X\" (or \"Mrs./Miss/Master X\"). A small curtain was opened to the audience, showing a placard with the contestants name, along with a drawing depicting the namesake; famous people were often caricatured.\n\nThe panelists were allocated 10 questions each, with the number remaining denoted in running tally on the wall behind them. The questions had to be \"yes or no\" questions, and were posed to the contestant as if they \"were\" the person, place, or thing their name represented with the contestant answering as their namesake.\n\nThe panel could pass to save some of their questions for later on in the game. Any member of the panel who failed to identify the contestants name wrote the contestant a check for $25, meaning each contestant won either $50 if their name was guessed by a panelist, or $75 if it was not. When a fourth panelist was added in early 1954, the check amounts were decreased to $20 per panelist, making the prizes $60 for a correct guess and $80 if the panel was stumped.\n\nMany of the contestants names lent themselves to comedy. Robert Q. Lewis would always call on Carl Reiner first when the mystery name was a thing: Reiner's innocent questions always took on funny meanings, followed by Joan Alexander straying even farther away, to the studio audiences delight. For \"A. Harem,\" Reiner asked, \"Is this thing used for recreational purposes?\" and Alexander pursued this: \"Do fat men use this to reduce their weight?\" Lewis would enjoy these detours as much as the audience. It was then left to Bill Stern, a veteran reporter, to zero in on the actual name with serious, shrewd questioning.\n\nSometimes a contestants celebrity namesake was brought out at the end of the round to surprise the contestant; other times, a celebrity was the guest without pretext. The celebrity then played a special round called \"I'd Like To Be...\" in which the panel tried to guess, in the same fashion as with civilians, who the celebrity would like to be if they could be anyone else. In late 1953, \"I'd Like To Be...\" was replaced with \"Secret Wish\", in which the panel attempted to guess something that the guest would secretly like to do or have happen (for example, Kirk Douglas wished to coach the Vassar lacrosse team, and Van Johnson wanted Marilyn Monroe to sit on his lap). The celebrity's winnings ($50/$75, later $60/$80) went to his or her favorite charity.\n\nA few times near the end of the run, host Clifton Fadiman would welcome the panel, then reveal the episode's guest to the studio and home audience. The curtain would pull back with the guest standing behind it in place of the usual caricature.\n\nA typical episode contained four rounds - two standard rounds, the celebrity round, and then a final standard round; some episodes would feature one less or one more standard round. At the end of each episode, each panelist would tell how much money they \"lost\" followed by a good-night.\n\nFor most of the shows run, the theme for \"The Name's the Same\" was a busy string arrangement called \"Shooting Star\" by Sidney Torch. This was used until the program's last 11 episodes, when an instrumental version of \"Meet Me in St. Louis, Louis\" by Kerry Mills was used (Ralston Purina of St. Louis was the show's sponsor).\n\nA UK version was made for radio (BBC Home Service) and TV (BBC Television) with British namesakes of famous people, buildings and things. It ran on TV from 1954 to 1955 with Bernard Braden as the original host, later replaced by Peter Martyn.\n\nA one-off revival edition was produced for BBC Four in 2005 as part of a season of programs detailing the \"lost decade\".\n\nAt least some episodes with all four regular hosts were saved as kinescope films. Most recently, the show aired in reruns on GSN at 3:30 AM ET every morning following \"What's My Line?\" in GSN's \"Black & White Overnight\" block. The latest run began on July 14, 2008, with an episode from August 6, 1952, and ended on December 2 with the series finale. Episodes hosted by Lewis were added to the Buzzr schedule in January 2018.\n\nSeveral episodes rerun by GSN are available in their original, uncut form (e.g., with commercials and uncrunched credits) in the collectors' trading circuit, as well as from \"public-domain\" dealers like Shokus Video. One of these is from April 25, 1955, in which famous clown Emmett Kelly fulfills his \"Secret Wish\" – painting co-host Ray Goulding's face like that of a clown.\n\nAs verified on December 29, 2018, the UCLA Film and Television Archive no longer has over 40 episodes of the program from 1953–1955, including the aforementioned Emmett Kelly episode.\n\n"}

Raunkiær\n\nChristen Christensen Raunkiær (29 March 1860 – 11 March 1938) was a Danish botanist, who was a pioneer of plant ecology. He is mainly remembered for his scheme of plant strategies to survive an unfavourable season (\"life forms\") and his demonstration that the relative abundance of strategies in floras largely corresponded to the Earth's climatic zones. This scheme, the Raunkiær system, is still widely used today and may be seen as a precursor of modern plant strategy schemes, e.g. J. Philip Grime's CSR system.\n\nHe was born on a small heathland farm, named Raunkiær, in Lyhne parish in western Jutland, Denmark. He later took his surname after it. He succeeded Eugen Warming as professor in botany at the University of Copenhagen and the director of the Copenhagen Botanical Garden, a position he held from 1912 to 1923. He was married to the author and artist Ingeborg Raunkiær (1863–1921), who accompanied him on journeys to the West Indies and the Mediterranean and made line drawings for his botanical works. They divorced in 1915, the same year as their only son Barclay Raunkiær died. Raunkiær later married the botanist Agnete Seidelin (1874–1956).\n\nRaunkiær's research axiom was that everything countable in nature should be subjected to numerical analysis, e.g. the number of male and female catkins in monecious plants and the number of male and female individuals in dioecious plants. Raunkiær also was an early student of apomixis in flowering plants and hybrid swarms. In addition, he studied the effect of soil pH on plants and plants on soil pH, a work his apprentice Carsten Olsen continued.\n\nAfter his retirement, C. Raunkiær made numerical studies of plants and flora in the literature (\"The flora and the heathland poets\", \"The dandelion in Danish poetry\", \"Plants in the psalms\"). In these studies, he applied strict quantitative criteria, like in his ecological studies. For example, he defined a poet as a person who has written 1,000 or more lines of verse.\n\nRaunkiær devised a system for categorising plants by life-form as a way of ecologically meaningful comparison of species and vegetation in regions having different floras.\n\nRaunkiær compared statistically local life form spectra (relative abundance) with the world average, which he called \"the normal spectrum\" (Raunkiær 1918 – see below). Thereby, he devised the first null model in the history of ecology. Raunkiær was a keen naturalist, who described the flora and funga of Denmark, the Virgin Islands, Tunisia, and other countries. In contrast to many contemporary naturalist, however, he strongly promoted quantitative and numerical approaches and experimentation. He devised a method to quantify the abundance of plants in vegetation as frequency in subplots and used it for quantitative studies of a range of plant communities.\n\nWhen plotting the number of species in a plant community that fell in each 20-percentile frequency class from very frequent, i.e. numerically dominant, to very infrequent, Raunkiær discovered that most species were either very common or very rare. This came to be known as \"Raunkiær's law\" and is related to R. A. Fisher's logseries distribution and to Frank W. Preston's lognormal distribution of the number of individuals of each species in a community. The significance of his idea was, however, disputed already by some of his contemporaries.\n\nAs a further experiment in characterizing plant communities, Raunkiaer devised a numerical scheme based on leaf size classes and leaf type (simple or compound) that was extended by L. J. Webb and is used as a way to classify forest types more simply than by lists of component species.\n\nFarley Mowat, in his book, Never Cry Wolf, described using a Raunkiær's Circle in making a “cover degree” study to determine the ratios of various plants one to the other. He spoke of it as \"a device designed in hell.\"\n\n\n\n"}

The original version of the magazine, \"Première\", was established in France in 1976 and continues to be published there.\n\nThe magazine originally had offices in New York City and Los Angeles and was published by Rupert Murdoch. The founding editor was Susan Lyne. Among those working for the magazine was Peter Biskind, who spent a decade at the magazine as executive editor, later writing the film history \"Easy Riders, Raging Bulls\". He said that, early on, the magazine \"gave us a lot of freedom to do hard-hitting, in-depth reporting.\"\n\nAnother former editor, Chris Connelly, subsequently worked as a correspondent for ESPN and as a contributing correspondent for ABC's \"20/20\"; he also provided backstage commentary during the Academy Awards. News Corporation sold the magazine to K-III (later Primedia) in 1991, and Hachette reacquired the magazine in 1995.\n\nAfter Lyne left the magazine, Connelly became editor-in-chief in early 1996, while Nancy Griffin served as deputy editor. Both editors resigned suddenly in May of the same year after publisher Hachette Filipacchi's then president and chief executive, David Pecker, told Connelly to not publish a column about Planet Hollywood because of its ties to billionaire Revlon owner Ronald Perelman, who was also half-owner of \"Premiere\".\n\n\"Premiere\" was released ten times a year, with issues dated February, March, April, May, June, July/August, September, October, November, and December/January. It sold all over the United States, Canada, Australia, Britain, and France.\n\nEach issue of \"Premiere\" included regular features, such as:\n\n\n\"Premiere's\" editor, Peter Herbst, was appointed senior vice president and group editorial director for Hachette Filipacchi Media U.S. in 2002. In addition to serving as editor-in-chief of \"Premiere\", Herbst also served as head of editorial direction for magazines such as \"Car and Driver\", \"Road & Track\", \"Cycle World\", \"Road & Track Road Gear\", \"Road & Track Speed\", and \"Sound & Vision\". From 1995 to 2000, Herbst was editor-in-chief of \"Family Life\" magazine. Prior to his position at \"Family Life\", Herbst worked for \"People\", \"Marie Claire\", \"New York magazine\", the \"New York Daily News\", and \"Rolling Stone\".\n\nOn March 5, 2007, publisher Hachette Filipacchi Media U.S. announced that it was shutting down the U.S. print edition of \"Premiere\" and that the magazine would survive as an online-only publication. The print editions in other countries — the Czech Republic, France, Poland, Portugal and Spain — were unaffected by this announcement. The Portuguese edition was canceled in October 2007. The last issue of the Czech edition was released in June 2009.\n\nThe last published issue was released in April 2007 and featured \"Blades of Glory\" star Will Ferrell on its cover. The final issue gave readers no warning that it would be the last. In late April, subscribers were mailed postcards advising them of the magazine's demise and telling them the balance of their subscriptions would be fulfilled with issues of the tabloid gossip magazine \"Us Weekly\". Unhappy subscribers responded to the offer by posting negative comments on the magazine website's forum pages, and it was later announced that a cash refund would be made available for those who preferred one.\n\nThe online version only lasted for a few years, as the magazine's subscribers showed little interest in its new incarnation, and the magazine ceased all operations in 2010.\n\n"}
{"id": "2205083", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2205083", "title": "Samson Raphaelson", "text": "Samson Raphaelson\n\nSamson Raphaelson (March 30, 1894 – July 16, 1983) was a leading American playwright, screenwriter and fiction writer.\n\nWhile working as an advertising executive in New York, he wrote a short story based on the early life of Al Jolson, called \"The Day of Atonement\", which he then converted into a play, \"The Jazz Singer\". This would become the first talking picture, with Jolson as its star. He then worked as a screenwriter with Ernst Lubitsch on sophisticated comedies like \"Trouble in Paradise,\" \"The Shop Around the Corner\", and \"Heaven Can Wait\" and with Alfred Hitchcock on \"Suspicion\". His short stories appeared in \"The Saturday Evening Post\" and other leading magazines, and he taught creative writing at the University of Illinois.\n\nRaphaelson was born in New York. After graduating from the University of Illinois, he lived for varying periods in Chicago, San Francisco, and New York, working as a journalist and an advertising writer, while trying to establish himself as writer of short stories. He had become a successful advertising executive in New York when his secretary encouraged him to convert his short story “The Day of Atonement” into a play. Showing him the manuscript of a play, she pointed out how few words were on each page, adding that he had dictated more than that in two hours the previous afternoon. She volunteered to take dictation over the weekend. The result, by Sunday evening, was a complete draft of \"The Jazz Singer\".\n\nRaphaelson's second play, \"Young Love\", was banned in Boston when authorities found it too racy. It starred Dorothy Gish, one of the leading actresses of the day.\n\nThree of his subsequent six plays produced on Broadway were chosen for publication in the annual \"Ten Best Plays of the Season\", compiled by Burns Mantle, the widely read critic of the \"New York Daily News\", at the time the largest circulation daily in the U.S. They were \"Accent On Youth\" (1934), \"Skylark\" (1939) and \"Jason\" (1941).\n\n\"Accent On Youth\" was a critical and popular success both on Broadway and in London's West End, where the young Greer Garson played the leading role. \"Skylark\", another substantial hit, starred Gertrude Lawrence. \"Jason\" was less successful commercially but won high praise from the New York critics. One called it “the best play of the season” and added that it contained “some of the finest writing to grace a stage in several years.” Another, commenting on one main character inspired by the colorful writer William Saroyan, wrote: “Many authors have tried to put into their plays characters that possess the picturesque qualities attributed to Saroyan, but Mr. Raphaelson is the first to do the thing successfully.”\n\nIn 1948, Raphaelson taught a master class in “creative writing with an emphasis on the drama” at the University of Illinois. He recorded the experience in a book, \"The Human Nature of Playwriting.\" The introduction expresses Raphaelson's deep regard for language so visible in his writing:\n\nThis course does not aim directly to teach writing. Whether you write or not after you finish school means nothing to me as a teacher. In fact, I don’t think it is important from any viewpoint. But whether you live or not is important; and how you live. You may become businessmen or women, office workers, farmers, or wives, and as such you will be, whether you know it or not, deeply related to the culture of your age. That culture is largely expressed by creative writers through the written word. And if from this course you get a notion of how that written word comes into being, of the connection between a writer and his own life and between his life and all lives, then this course will be successful indeed.\n\nIn the 1940s many Raphaelson short stories appeared in \"Ladies Home Journal,\" \"Good Housekeeping,\" and \"The Saturday Evening Post,\" in that period the nation's highest-paying publishers of short fiction.\n\nIn later years, as a result of Raphaelson's newly found passion for photography, he wrote a variety of articles for the leading photographic magazines. Some of his thousands of photos ran in the magazines, both as accompaniments to his articles and independent of them.\n\nIn 1983, the University of Wisconsin Press published \"Three Screen Comedies by Samson Raphaelson\" with an introduction by Pauline Kael. All directed by Lubitsch, the three were \"Trouble in Paradise,\" \"Heaven Can Wait,\" and Raphaelson's favorite, \"The Shop Around the Corner;\" this last had starred James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan, and Pauline Kael, the eminent film critic of \"The New Yorker,\" called it “as close to perfection as a movie made by mortals is ever likely to be; it couldn’t be the airy wonder it was without the structure Raphaelson built into it.” (The story was remade in 1998 as \"You've Got Mail\", with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.) Of his screenplays in general, Kael declared:Raphaelson took the giddiest inspirations and then polished his dialogue until it had the gleam of appliquéd butterfly wings on a Ziegfeld girl’s toque, but the skeletal strength of his screenplays was what made it possible for the ideas and the words to take flight.\n\n\"Three Screen Comedies\" also included a reprint of \"Freundschaft,\" Raphaelson's wry and affectionate reflection on his working relationship with Lubitsch that had originally appeared in \"The New Yorker\" in 1982.\n\nIn 1977, Raphaelson received the Laurel Award for lifetime achievement in screenwriting from the Writers Guild of America.\n\nIn an interview series entitled \"Creativity with Bill Moyers,\" an episode that aired in 1982 profiled Raphaelson's career and included an extended interview with him by Moyers. This program is among the extras included on the Criterion Collection DVD of \"Heaven Can Wait.\"\n\nIn his seventies and early eighties Raphaelson became an adjunct professor at Columbia University in New York, where he taught a course in screenwriting. In 1976 Columbia awarded him an honorary degree.\n\nRaphaelson died on July 16, 1983, at the age of eighty-nine.\n\nHis first wife was Rayna Simon from Chicago, who also studied at the University of Illinois. She became a legendary figure, Rayna Prohme, thanks to Vincent Sheean's bestselling book \"Personal History\" in the 1930s. She played a role in the Chinese Revolution, and died in Moscow in 1927.\n\nRaphaelson was married for 56 years to Dorothy Wegman, known to friends and family as Dorshka. The name was given to her by her friend Marion Benda, a fellow dancer in the Ziegfeld Follies in the early 1920s. Dorshka Raphaelson published two novels: \"Glorified\", an account of her life in the Follies, and \"Morning Song\", a highly praised story about growing up in New York's Washington Heights.\n\nRaphaelson's son, Joel (born 1928), became a senior ad executive and close associate of advertising legend David Ogilvy. Joel edited \"The Unpublished David Ogilvy: His Secrets of Management, Creativity, and Success - from Private Papers and Public Fulminations\", prized reading for advertising professionals. Joel also co-wrote (with Kenneth Roman) \"Writing that Works\". Photographer Paul Raphaelson is Joel's son.\n\nSamson's daughter, Naomi (1930–2009), was a newspaper reporter and columnist in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Samson's nephew, Bob Rafelson, directed several films from the 1960s through the 2000s, including \"Five Easy Pieces\".\n\nSamson Raphaelson died in July 1983, at the age of 89. Dorshka Raphaelson died in November 2005, just 22 days short of her 101st birthday. At her death \"The New York Times\" reported that she had been one of the last two living Ziegfeld girls.\n\n\n"}

The base of the pillar is approximately .\n\nThe pillar features an abundance of Native American petroglyphs, as well as the signature of William Clark, co-leader of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Clark's inscription is the only remaining physical evidence found along the route that was followed by the expedition.\n\nThe inscription consists of his signature and the date, July 25, 1806. Clark wrote that he climbed the sandstone pillar and \"had a most extensive view in every direction on the Northerly Side of the river\". He named the outcropping after Jean Baptiste Charbonneau—the son of expedition member Sacagawea—whom he nicknamed \"Pompy\".

Archeological evidence suggests that the outcropping has been witness to 11,000 years of human involvement in the area. Consequently, in addition to the pictographs and the signature of William Clark, hundreds of other people have carved their initials into the rock, including early pioneers to the area.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2205101", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2205101", "title": "Pratapgad", "text": "Pratapgad\n\nPratapgad (Marathi: प्रतापगड) literally 'Valour Fort' is a large fort located in Satara district, in the Western Indian state of Maharashtra. Significant as the site of the Battle of Pratapgad, the fort is now a popular tourist destination.\n\nPratapgad fort is located from Poladpur and west of Mahabaleshwar, a popular hill station in the area. The fort stands above sea level and is built on a spur which overlooks the road between the villages of Par and Kinesvar.\n\nThe Maratha king Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj commissioned Moropant Trimbak Pingle, his prime minister, to undertake the construction of this fort in order to defend the banks of the Nira and the Koyna rivers, and to defend the Par pass. It was completed in 1656. The Battle of Pratapgad between Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and Afzal Khan was fought below the ramparts of this fort on 10 November 1659. This was the first major test of the fledgling kingdom's army, and set the stage of the establishment of the Maratha empire. Pratapgad continued to be involved in regional politics. Sakharam Bapu, a well-known minister of Pune, was confined by his rival Nana Phadnis in Pratapgad in 1778. He was later moved from fort to fort until he died at Raigad. In 1796, Nana Phadnis, while escaping from the intrigues of Daulatrao Shinde and his minister Baloba, assembled a strong garrison in Pratapgad before heading to Mahad. In 1818, as part of the Third Anglo-Maratha War, Pratapgad surrendered by private negotiation. This was a great loss to the Maratha forces, as Pratapgad was an important stronghold, had a large garrison, and could suppress much of the country around Wai. A 17 feet high equestrian bronze statue of Shivaji was unveiled by Jawaharlal Nehru, then Prime Minister of India, on 30 November 1957, the same year a road was constructed by the Public Works Department from Kumbhrosi village up to fort. A guest house and a national park were built inside the fort in 1960. The fort is currently owned by Udayanraje Bhosale, the heir to the former Satara princely state.\n\nThe fort can be divided into the lower fort and upper fort.\n\nThe upper fort was built upon the crest of the hill. It is roughly square, 180m long on each side. It has several permanent buildings, including a temple to the god Mahadev. It is located at the northwest of the fort, and is surrounded by sheer cliffs with drops of up to 250m.\n\nThe lower fort is around 320m long and 110m wide. It is located at the southeast of the fort, and is defended by towers and bastions ten to twelve metres high.\n\nThe Afzal tower extends out from the fort proper and defends the approach to the fort. It is said to have been constructed after the Battle of Pratapgad, and Afzal Khan's body is said to be buried under the tower.\n\nIn 1661, Shivaji Maharaj was unable to visit the temple of the goddess Bhavani at Tuljapur. He decided to dedicate a temple to the goddess at this fort itself. This temple is on the eastern side of the lower fort. The hall has been rebuilt since the original construction, and consists of wooden pillars about 50' long, 30' broad and 12' high. The shrine is made of stone, and contains a clothed black stone image of the goddess. The roof of the temple is flat inside, but covered in lead covering put up by the Satara Raja Pratapsinha (1818–1839). A small spire or \"shikhar\" covers the shrine.The temple also has the sword of Maratha General Hambirao Mohite adorned with 6 diamond stones signifying that he had killed 600 soldiers in the battle. There is also a spatikha linga being worshipped inside the temple.The armors used in the battle during that period by the infantry soldiers are also on display just outside the temple\n\nA dargah of Afzal Khan is located a short while away from the fort to the south-east.\n\nPratapgad is usually visited as a day-trip from the hill station of Mahabaleshwar, a popular tourist destination located 25 kilometres away. ST bus service have run daily excursion services to places around Mahabaleshwar including Pratapgad for decades. Many schools also arrange educational trips to the fort. \nThe fort is also on many trekking routes of the area.\n\n"}

Such explicit formulae have been applied also to questions on bounding the discriminant of an algebraic number field, and the conductor of a number field. \n\nIn his 1859 paper \"On the Number of Primes Less Than a Given Magnitude\" Riemann sketched an explicit formula (it was not fully proven until 1895 by von Mangoldt, see below) for the normalized prime-counting function (\"x\") which is related to the prime-counting function (\"x\") by\nwhich takes the arithmetic mean of the limit from the left and the limit from the right at discontinuities. His formula was given in terms of the related function\nin which a prime power \"p\" counts as 1/\"n\" of a prime. The normalized prime-counting function can be recovered from this function by\nwhere \"μ\"(\"n\") is the Möbius function. Riemann's formula is then\n\ninvolving a sum over the non-trivial zeros ρ of the Riemann zeta function. The sum is not absolutely convergent, but may be evaluated by taking the zeros in order of the absolute value of their imaginary part. The function li occurring in the first term is the (unoffset) logarithmic integral function given by the Cauchy principal value of the divergent integral\nThe terms li(\"x\") involving the zeros of the zeta function need some care in their definition as li has branch points at 0 and 1, and are defined by analytic continuation in the complex variable ρ in the region \"x\" > 1 and Re(\"ρ\") > 0. The other terms also correspond to zeros: the dominant term li(\"x\") comes from the pole at \"s\" = 1, considered as a zero of multiplicity −1, and the remaining small terms come from the trivial zeros. This formula says that the zeros of the Riemann zeta function control the oscillations of primes around their \"expected\" positions. (For graphs of the sums of the first few terms of this series see .)\n\nThe first rigorous proof of the aforementioned formula was given by von Mangoldt in 1895: it started with a proof of the following formula for the Chebyshev's function ψ \nwhere the LHS is an inverse Mellin transform with formula_7, formula_8, and \nformula_9 and the RHS is obtained from the residue theorem, and then converting it into the formula that Riemann himself actually sketched.\n\nThis series is also conditionally convergent and the sum over zeroes should again be taken in increasing order of imaginary part : formula_10 where formula_11. The error involved in truncating the sum to \"S\"(\"x\",\"T\") is always smaller than ln(\"x\") in absolute value, and when divided by the natural logarithm of \"x\", has absolute value smaller than \"x\"/\"T\" divided by the distance from \"x\" to the nearest prime power.\n\nThere are several slightly different ways to state the explicit formula. André Weil's form of the explicit formula states\n\nwhere\n\nRoughly speaking, the explicit formula says the Fourier transform of the zeros of the zeta function is the set of prime powers plus some elementary factors. Once this is said, the formula comes from the fact that the Fourier transform is an unitary operator, so that a scalar product in time domain is equal to the scalar product of the Fourier transforms in the frequency domain.\n\nThe terms in the formula arise in the following way.\n\nWeil's explicit formula can be understood like this. The target is to be able to write that :\n\nSo that the Fourier transform of the non trivial zeros is equal to the primes power symmetrized plus a minor term. Of course, the sum involved are not convergent, but the trick is to use the unitary property of Fourier transform which is that it preserves scalar product :\n\nwhere formula_21 are the Fourier transforms of formula_22. \nAt a first look, it seems to be a formula for functions only, but in fact in many cases it also works when formula_23 is a distribution. Hence, by setting formula_24 (where formula_25 is the Dirac delta) and carefully choosing a function formula_26 and its Fourier transform, we get the formula above.\n\nRiemann-Weyl formula can be generalized to other arithmetical functions and not only for the Von-Mangoldt function, for example for the Möbius function we have\n\nAlso for the Liouville function we have\n\nFor the Euler-Phi function the explicit formula reads\n\nin all cases the sum is related to the imaginary part of the Riemann zeros formula_30 and the test function \"f\" and \"g\" are related by a Fourier transform formula_31\n\nfor the divisor function of zeroth order formula_32\n\nThe Riemann zeta function can be replaced by a Dirichlet L-function of a Dirichlet character χ. The sum over prime powers then gets extra\nfactors of \"χ\"(\"p\"), and the terms Φ(1) and Φ(0) disappear because the L-series has no poles.\n\nMore generally, the Riemann zeta function and the L-series can be replaced by the Dedekind zeta function of an algebraic number field or a Hecke L-series. The sum over primes then gets replaced by a sum over prime ideals.\n\nRiemann's original use of the explicit formula was to give an exact formula for the number of primes less than a given number. To do this, take \"F\"(log(\"y\")) to be \"y\"/log(\"y\") for 0 ≤ \"y\" ≤ \"x\" and 0 elsewhere. Then the main term of the sum on the right is the number of primes less than \"x\". The main term on the left is \"Φ\"(1); which turns out to be the dominant terms of the prime number theorem, and the main correction is the sum over non-trivial zeros of the zeta function. (There is a minor technical problem in using this case, in that the function \"F\" does not satisfy the smoothness condition.)\n\nAccording to the Hilbert–Pólya conjecture, the complex zeroes \"ρ\" should be the eigenvalues of some linear operator \"T\". The sum over the zeros of the explicit formula is then (at least formally) given by a trace:\n\nDevelopment of the explicit formulae for a wide class of L-functions was given by , who first extended the idea to local zeta-functions, and formulated a version of a generalized Riemann hypothesis in this setting, as a positivity statement for a generalized function on a topological group. More recent work by Alain Connes has gone much further into the functional-analytic background, providing a trace formula the validity of which is equivalent to such a generalized Riemann hypothesis. A slightly different point of view was given by , who derived the explicit formula of Weil via harmonic analysis on adelic spaces.\n\n\n\n"}

The Desperate Bicycles pioneered the do-it-yourself ethic of punk, adopting a proselytising role exemplified by their ardent exhortation: \"it was easy, it was cheap – go and do it!\". The group have been described as \"DIY's most fervent evangelists\".\n\nThe Desperate Bicycles formed in March 1977 \"specifically for the purpose of recording and releasing a single on their own label\". The band initially consisted of Nicky Stephens (keyboards), Roger Stephens (bass), Danny Wigley (vocals), Mel Oxer, (drums) and Paul LeClerc (guitar). The band's name derives from a passage in J. B. Priestley’s 1930 novel \"Angel Pavement\": In October 1978 vocalist Danny Wigley expressed the motivation driving the Desperate Bicycles' independent stance: \"The biggest hurdle is just \"believing\" you’ve still got some control over your life, that you \"can\" go out and do it\".\n\nVocalist Dan Wigley stands at 6 feet 8 inches tall. Making him the tallest member of any punk band until the 6'10\" Tobin Balwinkel formed Flatfoot 56 in 2000.\n\nIn March 1977 the Desperate Bicycles booked a studio at Dalston in East London to record their first single. The band possessed only an amp and a bass-guitar and the studio supplied the other instruments and equipment; \"with a lot of courage and a little rehearsal\" they recorded two songs, \"Smokescreen\" and \"Handlebars\". The first record was released in August 1977 as an edition of 500 pressings on the band’s own Refill Records label. The records cost £153 to produce, which comprised the three hours studio time, the price of pressing and the sleeves. The record was unusual in that it featured the same tracks on both sides and was a mono recording. The song \"Handlebars\" ends with the Desperate Bicycles' strident DIY rallying cry \"it was easy, it was cheap - go and do it!\". Roger Stephens and Danny Wrigley hawked the \"Smokescreen\" single around the small independent record shops, and distributors such as Virgin and Rough Trade. The first pressing sold out within four months resulting in a profit to the band of £210. Using this money a second pressing of 1,000 was made, which sold out in a fortnight. The profit from that was used to finance the pressings of the Desperate Bicycles' second single.\n\nThe drummer and guitarist had left the band soon after the recording of the \"Smokescreen\" single, with the drummer being replaced by Dave Papworth, then aged 14 years. The new line-up went back to the studio in June 1977 and recorded another two songs, \"The Medium was Tedium\" and \"Don't Back the Front\". The second single was released in February 1978 in a pressing of 1,000 and sold out in a week. \"The Medium was Tedium\" incorporates \"it was easy, it was cheap - go and do it!\" as a refrain, urging others to follow the band’s example. \"Don't Back the Front\" contains the lines: \"cut it, press it, distribute it / Xerox music's here at last\". For the Desperate Bicycles 'do-it-yourself' \"meant the overthrow of the establishment music industry through people seizing the means of production, making their own entertainment, and selling it to other creative and autonomous spirits\". With the profit from their second single the group pressed a further 2,500 copies of each of their singles, and also purchased some more equipment.\n\nIn the second half of 1977, with a single in the market-place, the Desperate Bicycles were invited to perform at Eric's Club in Liverpool. The band were unprepared for a live gig – \"Our first purpose was just to make and sell records\". But with characteristic enthusiasm and persistence they re-learnt the songs they had recorded and wrote a batch of new ones. They set up a rehearsal room at 106 Erlanger Rd, New Cross in South London in order to practice the new material. This was in the basement and sound proofed with cardboard eggboxes. On New Year’s Eve 1977 the Desperate Bicycles hired a van and drove to Liverpool for their first gig at Eric’s Club. The \"New Cross, New Cross\" EP, consisting of six of the additional songs they had written, was released in May 1978.\n\nThe Desperate Bicycles performed sporadically in 1978, including a Rock Against Racism benefit with Sham 69. In July that year they released another single.\n\nBy October 1979 Roger Stephens and Dave Papworth were replaced by Dan 'Electro'/Driscoll (guitar) and Geoff Titley (drums), with Nicky Stephens taking up the bass-guitar. The \"Remorse Code\" album was released in February 1980, reaching number 10 on the UK Indie Chart. The Desperate Bicycles disbanded in 1981.\n\nDanny Wigley and Jeff Titley, with Dennis Burns and Cameron Allan, recorded (as?) Lusty Ghosts on the Refill label.\n\nThe music of the Desperate Bicycles has been described as: \"Spindly, fuzzy, guttural guitars through puny amplifiers, reedy, wheezy organs, out of tune electric pianos, cardboard box drums and monotonous declamatory yet somehow utterly reasonable sounding vocals\". Another reviewer described them as \"a shambling wreck of a psychedelic post-punk band\". The writer Simon Reynolds states that the group's music \"was almost puritan in its unadorned simplicity, its guitar sound frugal to the point of emaciation\".\nFor the Desperate Bicycles, it was as though sloppiness and scrawniness became signs of membership in the true punk elect. The very deficiency of traditional rock virtues (tightness, feel) stood as tokens of the group's authenticity and purity of intent.\n\nThe Desperate Bicycles were a group of amateur musicians who remained determinedly independent. Their enjoyment of the creative and technical processes of making music is revealed in their recordings. The example they set, their energy and enthusiasm and the simple message of \"go and do it!\", inspired a generation of punk and post-punk bands to follow in their footsteps, in both the UK and further afield. In the years since their dissolution, the bandmembers have remained true to their principles, declining offers for interviews and having their music re-issued.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2205127", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2205127", "title": "Giovanni Battista Gaulli", "text": "Giovanni Battista Gaulli\n\nGiovanni Battista Gaulli (8 May 1639 – 2 April 1709), also known as Baciccio or Baciccia (Genoese nicknames for \"Giovanni Battista\"), was an Italian artist working in the High Baroque and early Rococo periods. He is best known for his grand illusionistic vault frescos in the Church of the Gesù in Rome, Italy. His work was influenced by Gian Lorenzo Bernini.\n\nGaulli was born in Genoa, where his parents died from the plague of 1654. He initially apprenticed with Luciano Borzone. In the mid-17th century, Gaulli's Genoa was a cosmopolitan Italian artistic center open to both commercial and artistic enterprises from north European countries, including countries with non-Catholic populations such as England and the Dutch provinces. Painters such as Peter Paul Rubens and Anthony van Dyck stayed in Genoa for a few years. Gaulli's earliest influences would have come from an eclectic mix of these foreign painters and other local artists including Valerio Castello, Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione, and Bernardo Strozzi, whose warm palette Gaulli adopted. In the 1660s, he experimented with the cooler palette and linear style of Bolognese classicism.\n\nHe was first noticed by the Genoese merchant of artworks, Pellegrino Peri, who was living in Rome. Peri introduced him to Gianlorenzo Bernini, who promoted him. He found patrons among the Genoese Giovanni Paolo Oliva, a prominent Jesuit. In 1662, he was accepted into the Roman artists' guild, the Accademia di San Luca (Academy of Saint Luke), where he was to later hold several offices. The next year, he received his first public commission for an altarpiece, in the church of San Rocco, Rome. He received many private commissions for mythological and religious works.\n\nFrom 1669, however, after a visit to Parma, Correggio's frescoed dome-ceiling in the cathedral of Parma, Gaulli's painting took on a more painterly (less linear) aspect, and the composition, organized \"di sotto in su\" (\"from below looking up\"), would influence his later masterpiece. At his height, Gaulli was one of Rome's most esteemed portrait painters. Gaulli is not well known for any other medium but paint, though many drawings in many media have survived. All are studies for paintings. Gaulli died in Rome, shortly after 26 March 1709, probably 2 April.\n\nBy the first half of the 17th century, the extensive interior decoration had been completed for the two generally contemporaneous \"mother\" churches, (Sant'Andrea and the Chiesa Nuova), of two major counter-reformation orders, the Theatines and Oratorians. This was not true for the two large Jesuit churches in Rome, which, while rich in marble and stone, remained artistically barren by the mid-17th century. This void would have been particularly evident for Il Gesù with its cavernous blank plaster nave ceiling. Funding and inertia stalled its decoration.\n\nIn 1661, the election of a new General of the Jesuit order, Gian Paolo Oliva, advanced the decoration. A new inductee into the order, the French Jacques Courtois (also known as Giacomo Borgognone) had become a respected painter and was the main candidate for its decoration. Oliva and the leader of the main patron family, the Duke of Parma, Ranuccio II Farnese whose uncle Cardinal Alessandro Farnese had endowed the construction of the church, began negotiating whether Borgognone should decorate the vault. Oliva wanted his fellow Jesuit for the commission, yet other prominent names such as Maratta, Ferri, and Giacinto Brandi were suggested. Ultimately, with Bernini's persuasive support and likely strong guidance thereafter, Oliva awarded the prestigious commission to the mere 22-year-old Gaulli. This choice may have been somewhat controversial, since Gaulli's naked figures recently frescoed in the pendentives for Sant'Agnese in Agone had offended some eyes, and, as had happened to Michelangelo's Sistine chapel altar frescoes, had required repainting to impose painted clothes.\nGaulli decorated the entire dome including lantern and pendentives, central vault, window recesses, and transepts' ceilings. The original contract stipulated the dome was to be completed in two years, and the remainder by the end of ten years. If it met the approval of a panel, Gaulli was to be paid 14,000 scudi plus expenses. Gaulli's main vault fresco was unveiled on Christmas Eve, 1679. After this, he continued frescoing of the vaults of the tribune and other areas in the church until 1685.\n\nGaulli's program for the nave was likely heavily overseen by Oliva and Bernini; though it is not clear how much all three contributed and whether they all shared the same philosophy. During this time, Bernini supposedly espoused some quietist teachings of the Spanish priest Miguel de Molinos, who was later condemned as heretical in no small part due to Jesuit efforts. Molinos proposed that God was accessible internally through an individual experience, while the Jesuits saw the church and clergy as an essential intermediary for access to Christ's salvation. Thus Oliva would have likely asked Gaulli to memorialize the role of frequently-martyred Jesuits as the apostolic shock troops in heretical and pagan societies, leading the charge of the papal Counter-Reformation. Ultimately, just as Bernini approved of the intermixing fresco and plaster in this new plastic conception, Gaulli blends these ideas in a fashion ultimately acceptable to his patron.\n\nGaulli's nave masterpiece, the \"Triumph of the Name of Jesus\" (also known as the \"Worship\", \"Adoration\", or \"Triumph of the Holy Name of Jesus\"), is an allegory of the work of the Jesuits that envelops worshippers (or observers) below into the whirlwind of devotion. Swirling figures in the dark distal (entry) border of the composition frame base the open sky, ever rising upward toward a celestial vision of infinite depth. The light from Jesus' name - IHS - and symbol of the Jesuit order is gathered by patrons and saints above the clouds; while in the darkness below, a fusillade of brilliance scatters heretics, as if smitten by blasts of the Last Judgment. The great theatrical effect here inspired and developed under his mentor, prompted critics to label Gaulli a \"Bernini in paint\" or a \"mouthpiece of Bernini's ideas\".\n\nGaulli's frescoes were a tour-de-force in illusionary painting, depicting the church's roof opens up above the viewer (and that the panorama is viewed in true perspective di sotto in su, similar to Correggio's frescoed dome ceiling depicting the \"Assumption of the Virgin\" or to Cortona's grand allegory at the Palazzo Barberini. Gaulli's ceiling is a masterpiece of \"quadratura\" (architectural illusionism) combining stuccoed and painted figures and architecture. Bernini's pupil Antonio Raggi provided the stucco figures, and from the nave floor, it is difficult to distinguish painted from stucco angels. The figural composition spill over the frame's edges which only heightens the illusion of the faithful rising miraculously toward the light above.\n\nA series of such ceilings were painted in the naves of Roman churches during the last three decades of the 17th century, including Andrea Pozzo's massive allegory at the other Roman Jesuit church, Sant'Ignazio, as well as Domenico Maria Canuti's and Enrico Haffner's \"Apotheosis\" at Santi Domenico e Sisto. In the 18th century, Tiepolo and others continued quadratura in the grand manner. But as the High Baroque movement evolved into the more playful Rococo, the popularity of this style dwindled. In his later works, Gaulli too moved in this direction. Thus, in contrast to the grandeur of his composition at Il Gesù, we see Gaulli gradually adopting less intense colours, and more delicate compositions after 1685—all hallmarks of the Rococo.\n\nGaulli accumulated a large number of pupils, among them Ludovico Mazzanti, Giovanni Odazzi, and Giovanni Battista Brughi (died 1730 in Rome). He was described as \"easy to mount a rage; but ready to recover, where reason was satisfied... generous, liberal of mind, and charitable, specially towards the poor\".\n\n\n\n"}

In 1943 he became the first New Zealander to serve as the Chief of the Air Staff of the Royal New Zealand Air Force, a post he held until 1946. At the close of World War II, Isitt was the New Zealand signatory to the Japanese Instrument of Surrender. After the war, following retirement from the Air Force, he worked as chairman of Tasman Empire Airways.\n\nLeonard Monk Isitt was born on 27 July 1891 in Christchurch, New Zealand, the son of the Methodist minister, member of parliament and prohibitionist Leonard Monk Isitt and Agnes Martha Caverhill. Leonard Monk Isitt junior was educated at Mostyn House, Cheshire, England and Christchurch Boys' High School. He had one brother, Willard Whitmore Isitt (1894–1916), who was a Rifleman in the New Zealand Rifle Brigade in World War I and was killed in France on 31 October 1916.\n\nFollowing the outbreak of World War I he enlisted in April 1915 in the New Zealand Army and was assigned to the New Zealand Rifle Brigade. After service in Egypt he then moved to the Western Front where he was wounded in the head during the New Zealand Division's participation in the Battle of Flers–Courcelette. The scalp wound resulted in him being sent to England to recover, where he was discharged from the NZEF in March 1917. \n\nOn 10 May 1917 he was granted a probationary commission in the Royal Flying Corps as a second lieutenant, which was confirmed a month later. \nHe was assigned as a pilot to a reconnaissance squadron with most of his duties involving artillery cooperation. During his period he shot down a single enemy aircraft, before being transferred back to England to serve as a flying instructor. After volunteering for frontline service he was assigned to 98 squadron in October 1917, flying the DH.9 on bombing missions. Based at Abscon airfield he flew his first mission on 9 October when 10 aircraft attacked Mons railway station. During the raid they were attacked by 15 Fokkers and Pfalzes. Two other major raids followed on 14 and 23 October. The later raid, was on the Hirson railway station, which saw two aircraft of the squadron shot down. In addition to these bombing flights he was also undertaking aerial reconnaissance. \nIn 1918 he was transferred to the Royal Air Force.\n\nAt the close of World War I, New Zealand had no military air organisation of any sort. On the request of the New Zealand government, the British Air Ministry sent Colonel (later Group Captain) A. V. Bettington to New Zealand to advise on the establishment of an air service. Bettington brought four aircraft with him and they were based at Sockburn airfield (later to become RNZAF Station Wigram). It was to this embryonic state of affairs that Isitt was to return. In 1919 Isitt, then a captain, was posted back to New Zealand where he was sent to Sockburn airfield to take care of the four aircraft and serve as commanding officer. Additionally Isitt served as the liaison officer to the Canterbury Aviation Company on behalf of the government.\n\nBetween the wars, one of Isitt's responsibilities was pilot flight training and he served in the Air Ministry, the New Zealand Permanent Air Force (NZPAF) and the RNZAF. In 1937, the RNZAF was made independent of the New Zealand Army and at that time Isitt was promoted to wing commander and appointed as the Air Member for Personnel. In the pre-World War II build up this was a key post and Isitt was soon promoted again to group captain.\n\nContinuing as Air Member for Personnel at the start of World War II, in March 1940 Isitt went to Canada as he had been appointed as New Zealand's representative on the board of Empire Air Training Scheme, a massive aviation training programme. In May 1942 Isitt was sent to London to establish the RNZAF's Overseas Headquarters, receiving a promotion to air commodore at the same time. Having accomplished his task, under a year later Isitt was back in New Zealand and in March 1943 Isitt became the New Zealand's Deputy Chief of Air Staff working under the then Chief of the Air Staff, Air Commodore Victor Goddard, a British officer on secondment. Around four months later on 19 July 1943 Isitt was appointed Chief of Air Staff of the Royal New Zealand Air Force in the rank of air vice-marshal. He was the first New Zealander to hold his Service's senior appointment and the first to hold one of the air marshal ranks. In addition to securing a significant role for his Air Force in the South Pacific, Isitt represented New Zealand at conferences in London, Washington and Ottawa during World War II. \n\nHe was the New Zealand signatory to the Japanese Instrument of Surrender on the USS Missouri marking the formal surrender of Japanese forces, so ending World War II.\n\nIsitt retired in 1946 as Chief of the Air Staff and he became chairman of Tasman Empire Airways (TEAL) in 1947. He continued as TEAL chairman until 1963 when he was succeeded by Sir Andrew McKee.\n\nFollowing his retirement as chairman of NAC and TEAL he served as chairman of Standard–Triumph New Zealand, Motor Assemblies Limited and then Leyland Motors of New Zealand until his final retirement in 1966. \n\nTogether with Ronald Bannerman and Keith Caldwell he was instrumental in establishing the New Zealand 1914–1918 Airmen's Association in 1960.\n\nHe died at Lower Hutt on 21 January 1976.\n\nIsitt married Elsie Gladys Caverhill (1896–1970) at Wellington on 26 April 1920. They had two daughters.\n\nIn 1935, he was awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal. He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1940 and a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1946 New Year Honours. His medals are held at the Air Force Museum of New Zealand.\n\n\n \n"}

Raunkiær's life-form system may be useful in researching the transformations of biotas and the genesis of some groups of phytophagous animals.\n\nThe subdivisions of the Raunkiær system are premised on the location of the bud of a plant during seasons with adverse conditions, i. e. cold seasons and dry seasons:\n\nThese plants, normally woody perennials, grow stems into the air, with their resting buds being more than 50 cm above the soil surface, e.g. trees and shrubs, and also epiphytes, which Raunkiær later separated as a distinct class (see below).\n\nRaunkiær further divided the phanerophytes according to height as\nFurther division was premised on the characters of duration of foliage, i. e. evergreen or deciduous, and presence of covering bracts on buds, for 8 classes. 3 further divisions were made to increase the total of classes to 12:\n\nEpiphytes were originally included in the phanerophytes (see above) but then separated because they do not grow in soil, so the soil location is irrelevant in classifying them.\n\nThese plants have buds on persistent shoots near the soil surface; woody plants with perennating buds borne close to the soil surface, a maximum of 25 cm above the soil surface, e.g., bilberry and periwinkle.\n\nThese plants have buds at or near the soil surface, e.g. common daisy and dandelion, and are divided into:\n\nThese plants have subterranean or under water resting buds, and are divided into:\n\nThese are annual plants that complete their lives rapidly in favorable conditions and survive the unfavorable cold or dry season in the form of seeds. Many desert plants are by necessity therophytes.\n\nAerophytes were a later addition to the system. These are plants that obtain moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. They usually grow on other plants yet are not parasitic on them. These are perennial plants whose roots atrophy. Some can live on mobile sand dunes. Like epiphytes and hemicryptophytes, their buds are near the soil surface. Some \"Tillandsia\" species are classified as aerophytes.\n\nFarley Mowat, in his book, Never Cry Wolf, described using a Raunkiær's Circle in making a “cover degree” study to determine the ratios of various plants one to the other. He spoke of it as \"a device designed in hell.\"\n"}

She is one of the most decorated rhythmic gymnast of her generation. She is a two-time Olympic bronze medalist (2004 and 2008); a five-time medalist in the all-around competition of the World Championships: gold in 2007, silver in 2003 and 2005, bronze in 2001 and 2009; a four-time medalist in the all-around competition of the European Championships: silver in 2004 and 2008, bronze in 2002 and 2006; and a four-time medalist in the all-around competition of the Grand Prix Final: gold in 2003, silver in 2002 and 2005, bronze in 2004.\n\nBessonova's father is the \"Dynamo Kyiv\" football player Vladimir Bessonov. Her mother, Viktoria, is a former two-time World champion group rhythmic gymnast. She is the one that introduced her daughter to the sport.\n\nToday, Bessonova coaches girls at the Deriugins School.\n\nBessonova began training in rhythmic gymnastics at age five. Her mother preferred to see her daughter on the ballet stage; however, Bessonova decided on rhythmic gymnastics. She was coached by Albina Deriugina and her daughter Irina Deriugina at the Deriugins School in Kiev. She is 1.74m (5'9\").\n\nIn 2001, Bessonova was the youngest in the Ukrainian team during the 2001 World Championships in Osaka, Japan, yet she made such a good impression that the RG specialists wrote her name immediately as a future top gymnast. In the 2001 World Championships, Alina Kabaeva and her teammate Irina Tchachina who originally won gold and silver medal in all-around respectively tested positive to a banned diuretic (furosemide) and were stripped of their medals. Ukraine's Tamara Yerofeeva who originally won bronze was awarded the gold with Bulgaria's Simona Peycheva from 4th to taking the silver and Bessonova from 5th was awarded the bronze medal.\n\nIn 2002, Bessonova tested positive for norephedrine, a banned stimulant in March during a competition in France and was banned for two months. Bessonova briefly competed as member of the Ukrainian Group. She and the Ukrainian Group won the gold medal in five Ribbons in New Orleans. She dominated the 2002 World Cup Final in Stuttgart in November, by winning the first place on the hoop, the rope and the clubs. After that Bessonova (aged 18) became a leader of the Ukrainian national team.\n\nIn 2003 in Budapest she won two World titles — the hoop event final edging out Alina Kabaeva (performing to music from Swan Lake) and the clubs final where she beat Irina Tchachina for the gold. Bessonova was very close to the all-around title but finished with the silver medal behind Russia's Alina Kabaeva after a drop during her ball routine. In 2003, she won three European gold medals — in hoop, clubs and ribbon event finals. She won three of four finals in the 2003 Grand Prix tournament in Kiev.\n\nIn 2004, Bessonova won the all-around silver medal at the 2004 European Championships. She made her Olympic debut and won the bronze individual all-around medals at the 2004 Athens Olympics with a total score of 106.700 (ribbon 26.725, clubs 26.950, ball 26.525, hoop 26.500) behind two Russians, silver medalist Irina Tchachina and gold medalist Alina Kabaeva.\n\nIn 2005, Bessonova became a six-time silver medalist during 2005 World Championships in all-around, rope, ball, clubs and ribbon finals. She took four gold medals at the 2005 Universiade in Izmir, winning the all-around, rope, ball and clubs. She won the all-around bronze at the 2006 European Championships.\n\nIn 2007, Bessonova competed in a number of Grand Prix and World Cup Series. The year would also mark the start of a new challenge for Bessonova with rise of new Russian gymnast Evgenia Kanaeva. At the 2007 Corbeil-Essonnes World Cup, she won the silver medal behind Evgenia Kanaeva. She won all the gold medals in 2007 Summer Universiade beating Sessina and Kapranova. She became World champion at the 2007 World Championship in Patras, winning the all-around gold medal defeating Russians Vera Sessina and Olga Kapranova.\n\nIn 2008, Bessonova won all-around golds at the LA Lights, Deriugina Cup (Kiev World Cup) and Miss Valentine Competitions, as well as the all-around silver at the European Championships in Torino behind Russian star Evgenia Kanaeva. At the 2008 World Cup events, Bessonova accumulated 15 medals. The year culminated in her all-around bronze medal at the 2008 Beijing Olympics with Kanaeva winning the gold medal and Belarus' Inna Zhukova taking the silver medal.\n\nIn 2009, Bessonova placed first in the all-around at the Kiev World Cup and Deriugina Cup events, and also won bronze in the World and European Championships behind reigning Olympic champion Evgenia Kanaeva and Daria Kondakova. She competed at the 2009 Universiade in Belgrade and won four silver medals again behind Kanaeva. Bessonova finally completed her career in 2010 at the Deriugina Cup in Kiev.\n\nIn 2013 Bessonova performed at the opening ceremony of the 2013 World Championships, in Kiev, Ukraine.\n\nAfter completing her career in professional sports, Bessonova appeared in Ukrainian television projects. During the UEFA Euro 2012, she was a TV presenter, a commentator and a special correspondent in a Ukrainian sports TV channel.\nBack in 2009 Bessonova took part in «Dancing for You» TV show, becoming the winner (partnered with Olexander Leshchenko).\nAfter some time, she was a chief editor of Ukrainian edition of Pink magazine. Bessonova is also known as an active promoter of sports and healthy lifestyle among young people in Ukraine. She participated in numerous charity projects.\n\nAnna's early years are described in the book \"National Olympic Committee of Ukraine for Rhythmic Gymnastics and Iryna Deriugina, Olexandra Tymoshenko, Olena Vitrychenko, Kateryna Serebryanska, Anna Bessonova\" (in Ukrainian) (Національний олімпійський комітет України про художню гімнастику та Ірину Дерюгіну, Олександру Тимошенко, Олену Вітриченко, Катерину Серебрянську, Анну Безсонову / текст: Григорія Палія та Олександра Мащенка; відповідальний редактор Олена Мовчан. — Київ : Грані-Т, 2010. — 112 с. — ).\n\nAnother story based on real events from Anna Bessonova's childhood is \"Absolute champion\" by Oles Ilchenko (in Ukrainian) (Ільченко, О.

A. K. Pataudi (16 March 1910 – 5 January 1952) was the 8th Nawab of Pataudi and the captain of the India national cricket team for the tour to England in 1946. His son Mansoor, known as the Nawab of Pataudi Jr., also later served as captain of the India cricket team.\n\nHe also played Test cricket for the England team in 1932 and 1934, making him one of the few cricketers to have played Test cricket for two countries and the only Test cricketer to have played for both India and England. He played in six Tests in all, three as captain of India and three for England.\n\nIftikhar Ali Khan was born at Pataudi House in Delhi, into the family of the Nawabs of Pataudi, a small () non-salute princely state near Delhi, located in the present-day Indian state of Haryana. The Pataudi family traces their origin to Faiz Talab Khan, an ethnic Pashtun from the Barech tribe of Kandahar, Afghanistan, who became the first Nawab of the Pataudi State in 1804. Iftikhar Ali Khan was the elder son of Nawab Muhammad Ibrahim Ali Khan of Pataudi and his wife Shahar Bano Begum, daughter of Amiruddin Ahmad Khan, the Nawab of Loharu. Thus he was related to great Urdu poet Mirza Ghalib as well as later day Pakistan prime minister, Liaqat Ali Khan. He became Nawab on his father's death in 1917 and was formally installed as ruler in December 1931. His state became part of the newly independent India in 1948. After Indian independence, he was employed in the Indian Foreign Office till the time of his death.\n\nEducated at Chiefs' College (later renamed Aitchison College), Lahore, and at Balliol College, Oxford, Iftikhar married Begum Sajida Sultan, second daughter of Hamidullah Khan, last ruling Nawab of Bhopal, in 1939. Hamidullah Khan was to have been succeeded in the titles and privileges associated with the ruling house of Bhopal by his eldest daughter Abida Sultan, She emigrated to Pakistan in the aftermath of the partition of India. His voluntary accession of his state to India by going to Delhi has been recounted in V P Menon's book \"The story of Integration of Indian States\". V P Menon remembered him as \"Great Patriot who unfortunately died young\". Sajida therefore succeeded her father and was recognised by the government of India as Begum of Bhopal in 1961. Upon her demise in 1995, her son Mansoor succeeded to the estates and titles associated with the Nawabs of Bhopal.\n\nIftikhar Ali Khan was coached at school in India by Oxford cricketer M. G. Slater and then in England by Frank Woolley. He went to Oxford in 1927. It was two years before he won a blue; this was for a 106 and 84 that saved a match against Cambridge. In the 1931 season, he scored 1,307 runs for Oxford and finished with a batting average of 93, heading the Oxford averages. In the University Match that year, Alan Ratcliffe scored 201 for Cambridge, a new record. Pataudi declared that he would beat it, and hit 238* on the very next day. This stood as a record for the University Match until 2005. Pataudi qualified to play for Worcestershire in 1932 but played only three matches and scored just 65 runs in six innings. However, his slaughter of Tich Freeman with marvellous footwork during an innings of 165 for the Gentlemen at Lord's in July 1932 gained him a place on the Ashes tour for that winter. He was selected as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1932.\n\nHe was selected for the first Test of the 1932–33 Ashes series, Pataudi followed in the footsteps of Ranjitsinhji by scoring a century (102) on his Test debut in Sydney, which England won by 10 wickets. He nonetheless incurred the ire of his captain Douglas Jardine by dissenting against Jardine's bodyline tactics. Upon Pataudi's refusal to take his place in a bodyline leg-side field, Jardine retorted, \"I see His Highness is a conscientious objector.\" He was dropped after the second Test in Melbourne, in which he scored 15 and 5, and did not play again that series. Towards the end of the tour, Pataudi said of Jardine: \"I am told he has his good points. In three months I have yet to see them.\"\n\n1933 was Pataudi's only full season of county cricket, and he batted marvellously, again slaughtering Freeman at Worcester and scoring two other double-hundreds. He finished with 1749 runs at an average of 49, but after more brilliant batting early in 1934 his health broke down and he played just ten games, although recording a batting average of 91.33. He played in his third and last Test for England in June 1934, against Australia at Trent Bridge, scoring 12 and 10. Pataudi did not play at all in 1935 and 1936 and only five times altogether in 1937 and 1938. Nonetheless, in these games he batted so well that Worcestershire, weak in batting, were always regretting he could not play more often.\n\nHe has been considered as a possible captain for the India team in its first Test match in 1932, at Lord's, but withdrew his name from consideration. He was actually appointed captain for the India tour of England in 1936, but withdrew at the last moment, ostensibly on health grounds. He finally played for India when he captained the tour to England in 1946. Despite averaging 46.71 on the tour, his scored only 55 runs in 5 Test innings, and his captaincy was also criticised. He was Indian Cricketer of the Year in 1946/47. He planned a return to play for Worcestershire for the 1952 county cricket season, but died in India before he came back.\n\nIftikhar Ali Khan was also a fine hockey and billiards player and an accomplished speaker. In 2007, in commemoration of the 75th anniversary of India's Test debut, the Marylebone Cricket Club commissioned a trophy in Pataudi's name, to be competed for in the Test series between India and England .\n\nIn addition to their son, Iftikhar and Sajida were also the parents of three daughters. Iftikhar died at Delhi with a heart attack while playing polo on 5 January 1952, also his son's eleventh birthday. His son succeeded him as the 9th Nawab of Pataudi, and later also served as captain of the Indian cricket team. Iftikhar was also the grandfather of Bollywood actors Saif Ali Khan and Soha Ali Khan.\n\n\n"}

Stawell was the first Attorney-General of Victoria, serving from 1851 to 1856 as an appointed official sitting in the Victorian Legislative Council, and from 1856 until 1857, as an elected politician, representing Melbourne.\n\nStawell was born in Old Court, County Cork, Ireland the second son of ten children of Jonas Stawell, and his wife Anna, second daughter of the Right Reverend William Foster, bishop of Clogher.\n\nStawell was admitted to the Port Phillip District bar in 1843. He engaged extensively in pastoral pursuits, and had sheep stations at Natte Yallock, Victoria, on the banks of the Avoca River, and in the neighbourhood of Lake Wallace, near the South Australian border. When Charles Perry came to Australia as first bishop of Melbourne, Stawell helped him to form a constitution for the newly created diocese. His first cousins and fellow Anglo-Irish, the brothers William and Leopold de Salis also went to Australia in the 1840s.\n\nFor many years Stawell enjoyed the leading practice at the local bar, and when the Port Phillip district of New South Wales was separated from the parent colony, and entered upon an independent existence as the Colony of Victoria, Stawell accepted the position of Attorney-General on 15 July 1851 and became a member of the Executive Council and the Legislative Council.\n\nA few weeks after Stawell's appointment gold was discovered in Victoria; the duty of creating a system of government which could cope adequately with the situation fell to him. Stawell had to establish a police force, frame regulations for the government of the goldfields, appoint magistrates and officials of every grade, and protect life and property against the perceived threat of the hordes of gold rush adventurers who arrived in Victoria, first from the neighbouring colonies, and later from Europe and America. Much was owed to the firm administration of Stawell that, at a time when the government was weak, and many of the newcomers impatient of control, lynch law was never resorted to.\n\nRather than export duty on gold, Stawell supported a miners' licensing system, which was one of the major grievances leading to the Eureka Rebellion in Ballarat in 1854. Referring to the miners as \"wandering vagabonds\" and \"vagrants\", Stawell was the prosecutor in the unsuccessful case against the rebel leaders charged with high treason.\n\nStawell had very little assistance for some time from any of his colleagues, and until the Executive Council was strengthened by the admission of Captain Andrew Clarke and Hugh Culling Childers, Stawell was the brains as well as the body of the administration. The success of his policy was upon the whole remarkable. In the legislature he was sometimes opposed, and at other times assisted, by John O'Shanassy, who was the leader of the popular party, and between them they managed to pass a number of statutes which added greatly to the prosperity of the colony. A political contemporary, Henry Samuel Chapman, spoke of him as “almost the only efficient man connected with the government.”\n\nStawell was indefatigable in the discharge of his duties, and extraordinary stories are told of the long journeys on horseback to visit distant outposts which he would take after being all day long in the law courts or in the council chamber. Stawell bore an active part in drafting the Constitution Act which gave to Victoria representative institutions and a responsible ministry, instead of an executive appointed and removable by the governor and a legislature in which one-third of the members were chosen by the Crown.\n\nAt the first general election after the new constitution in 1856 Stawell was returned as one of the Members for Melbourne, and became the attorney-general of the first responsible ministry. In 1857, on the resignation of the chief justice, Sir William à Beckett, he succeeded to the vacant post, and was created a knight bachelor. He administered the government of Victoria in 1873, 1875–1876, and 1884.\n\nStawell did not leave Australia from his arrival in 1843 until 1872, when he paid short visits to the neighbouring colonies and New Zealand, and 1873, when he returned to Europe on two years’ leave of absence. Stawell took a very deep interest in the proceedings of the Church of England, and was a member of the synod. On his retirement from the bench in 1886 he was created . Stawell died at Naples, Italy on 12 March 1889.\n\nThe family house D'Estaville, built in 1859, still stands in the inner Melbourne suburb of Kew.\n\nThe town of Stawell, Victoria was named in his honour.\n\nIn 1856 Stawell married Mary Frances Elizabeth Greene, only daughter of W.P. Greene, RN;\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2205196", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2205196", "title": "Secret Six (comics)", "text": "Secret Six (comics)\n\nThe Secret Six is the name of three different fictional comic book teams in the , plus an alternate universe's fourth team. Each team has had six members, led by a mysterious figure named Mockingbird, whom the characters assume to be one of the other five members. The third, villainous incarnation of the Secret Six was rated by IGN as the fourth Best Comic Run of the Decade in 2012.\n\nThe Secret Six first appeared during the Silver Age of comics in the initial team's seven-issue title \"Secret Six\" (May 1968 – May 1969).\n\nUnusually, the premiere issue's story began on the cover, and continued on the interior's page one. This strike team of covert operatives consisted of August Durant, Lili de Neuve, Carlo di Rienzi, Mike Tempest, Crimson Dawn and King Savage.\n\nCreated by writer E. Nelson Bridwell and artist Frank Springer, the ongoing series ceased publication with the identity of Mockingbird unrevealed. The first two issues were reprinted in \"The Brave and the Bold\" #117 and #120 (March and July 1975).\n\nWriter Martin Pasko and artist Dan Spiegle introduced an updated version of the team as an eight-page feature in the omnibus title \"Action Comics Weekly\" #601 (May 24, 1988).\n\nThey revealed Mockingbird as Durant, who now reunited the team after twenty years while also assembling a new team consisting of Mitch Hoberman, Ladonna Jameal, Tony Mantegna, Luke McKendrick, Vic Sommers and Dr. Maria Verdugo. The following issue saw the entire first team, including Durant, die. The feature ran through \"Action Comics Weekly\" #612 (August 9, 1988), with DiRienzi succeeding Durant as Mockingbird.\n\nA second arc of this team, by writer Pasko and original Silver Age artist Springer, ran in \"Action Comics Weekly\" #619–630 (September 27 – December 13, 1988). DiRienzi died, and his son Rafael disappeared amid intimations that he may be the successor Mockingbird.\n\nThe next version of the team was introduced in \"Villains United\" #1 (July 2005). Unlike previous versions of the team, the new Secret Six consists mainly of villainous characters who undertake missions of dubious moral quality and often resulting in a high body count. The team consists of the pre-existing DC characters Catman, Deadshot, and Cheshire, and the newly created Rag Doll, Scandal Savage, and a Parademon. Another member, the Fiddler, is killed by Deadshot on order of Mockingbird. Later, the Parademon is killed and Cheshire betrays the group to the Society, and was shot by the Society's Deathstroke, who does not trust her for being a traitor (Cheshire eventually turns up alive and plotting revenge). The Mockingbird for this version of the team is eventually revealed to be Lex Luthor.\n\nIn the 2006 \"Secret Six\" limited series, (written by Gail Simone with art by Brad Walker and Jimmy Palmiotti), Knockout, who was revealed as a mole infiltrating the Society in \"Villains United\", has officially joined the group to be with her lover, Scandal. At the end of issue #1, Catman asks the Mad Hatter to be the sixth member of the group. While Catman meets with the Mad Hatter, Doctor Psycho orchestrates a series of attacks designed to wipe out the Six. Hatter is literally kicked off the team by Rag Doll, who says that one eccentric fop in the group is enough. His replacement is Harley Quinn, who later quits.\n\nIn \"Birds of Prey\" issues #104–108, the Secret Six face off against Oracle's Birds of Prey in Russia for the soul of Tora (Ice). After Harley Quinn quit the team, they disbanded. Subsequently, in \"Birds of Prey\" #109, Knockout was attacked and killed by the same assassin who had been stalking the New Gods and killing them off, one by one. Earlier in the issue, Knockout comments in passing that Catman was going soft, and Deadshot had returned to the Suicide Squad. Harley Quinn is reformed in \"Countdown\" #43. Scandal Savage, Rag Doll and Catman were later seen in \"Salvation Run\".\n\nDC launched a new \"Secret Six\" series in September 2008, reuniting Catman, Deadshot, Scandal, and Rag Doll, and adding Bane (hinted at by Simone months earlier as \"an A-list Batman villain\") and an original character named Jeannette, who appeared in the third issue. The Six have been hired to retrieve Tarantula from Alcatraz Island, and find a card which she stole from \"Junior\", a mysterious villain who supposedly runs the entire West Coast mob. This Junior has practically the entire villain community at her beck and call, all afraid of her, even those in Arkham Asylum. The Six later learn that the card in question was made by Neron, and says \"Get Out of Hell Free\". Soon, the Six are attacked by a small army of supervillains, all wanting to recover the card and collect the reward of $20 million for each of the Six, under the orders of Junior, who captures and tortures Bane, whose strong principles and moral convictions, paired with his fatherly fondness of Scandal, keep him from betraying his new team. It is later revealed that Junior is in fact Rag Doll's sister and daughter of the first Rag Doll. She has the ghastly appearance of an old clown, with sliced skin and eyes stitched wide open to give the appearance of a clown. The Six escape and head for Gotham City, with Deadshot seemingly betraying them and leaving with Tarantula. The Six manage to catch up to Deadshot, and was attacked by Junior, the supervillains, and the Mad Hatter, who is revealed to be the one who hired them, simply so they would be killed. Tarantula sacrifices herself by pulling herself and Junior in front of the supervillains' combined attack, seemingly destroying the card along with them. However, it is later shown that Scandal is now in possession of it.\n\nAlthough the current incarnation of the Secret Six are technically supervillains, several members of the team are treated sympathetically and come across as heroic, if only on the virtue of the team encountering individuals who are even more bloodthirsty and villainous.\n\nIn a new storyline starting with issue #10 titled \"Depths\", the Six have been hired by a new villain named Mr. Smyth, a slave trader. He is building what he hopes will be the world's biggest and only prison. He is also holding the Amazon Artemis of Bana-Mighdall prisoner. Jeannette breaks her out and was met with opposition from the rest of the team, who in the middle of battling with each other are interrupted by Wonder Woman. The Six one-by-one turn on Smyth and free all the slaves he possessed on his Devil's Island, ending with Deadshot killing Smyth in cold blood. Disappointed in the repetitive failed progress the team's missions have had since joining, Bane decides to take over as team leader with the approval of half the team. His first directive was to remove Scandal Savage as a team member and replace her with Black Alice. After Catman flees to find the murderers of his son, he is followed by Rag Doll, Alice, Deadshot, and Scandal. Bane and Jeanette replace them with King Shark, Dwarfstar, Lady Vic, and Giganta.\n\nJohn Ostrander guest-wrote \"Secret Six\" vol. 3 #15 (January 2010), featuring Deadshot, and #23 (September 2010), a super-powered version take on \"The Most Dangerous Game\".\n\nThe series has also had three crossovers with other DC titles. In 2010, Simone teamed with John Ostrander for \"Danse Macabre\", a crossover with Ostrander's acclaimed 1980s \"Suicide Squad\" title, which had been \"resurrected\" and given one additional issue as part of DC's company-wide \"Blackest Night\" event. The crossover involved the Six being hired by an anonymous party (in reality Amanda Waller) to break into Belle Reve prison in order to rescue an inmate, only to discover that the mission was a trap set in place so that the Suicide Squad could apprehend the team and kidnap Deadshot. The crossover began in \"Suicide Squad\" #67 and subsequently ran through \"Secret Six\" vol. 3 #17 and #18, and eventually reached a climax where both teams were forced to work together to fight off a Black Lantern invasion. In January 2011, Simone collaborated with Paul Cornell on a two-part crossover which began \"Action Comics\" #896 and ended in \"Secret Six\" vol. 3 #29, which saw the Six being hired by Lex Luthor to assassinate Scandal's father Vandal Savage. In February of the same year, Simone took part in another two-issue crossover, this time with Keith Giffen's \"Doom Patrol\" for a storyline entitled \"Suicide Roulette\". The crossover, which took place in \"Secret Six\" vol. 3 #30, and \"Doom Patrol\" vol. 5 #19, saw the Secret Six come into conflict with the Doom Patrol after being hired to forcibly take over the team's home country of Oolong Island.\n\nThe book's final storyline featured Bane leading the Secret Six on an ill-fated mission to Gotham City, where they plan to kill Catwoman, Red Robin, Batgirl and Azrael. However, upon their arrival the team is met by a veritable army of superheroes ranging from Green Lantern and Huntress to the Justice League and Teen Titans. Despite the overwhelming odds, the members of the Secret Six make one last stand, and were defeated and incarcerated.\n\nIn September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Secret Six was relaunched in December 2014 with Gail Simone returning as the writer. The series features a completely new line-up, save Catman and Black Alice, including Strix, Ventriloquist (Shauna Belzer), Ralph Dibny under the alias of Big Shot and a new character named Porcelain. In the third issue of the series the Riddler was revealed to be the Mockingbird, while Big Shot was revealed to be Riddler's mole on the team. In the next issue, Scandal Savage, Ragdoll and Jeannette appear acting as operatives of Mockingbird, tracking down the team but later the three characters become allies to the Secret Six and turn on the Riddler.\n\nIn the 2019 \"Batman/Superman\" series, The Batman Who Laughs uses Joker toxin-laced Batarangs to create dark and twisted versions of six individuals necessary to open a portal to the Dark Multiverse, whom include Commissioner Gordon, Blue Beetle, Shazam, Donna Troy, Hawkman, and Supergirl. After the portal is closed due to the combined efforts of Batman and Superman, the team (minus Gordon, who was apprehended shortly afterwards) does battle with Lex Luthor in the \"Year of the Villain: Hell Arisen\" miniseries. The team is disbanded when the Batman Who Laughs is injected with a cure for his serum, causing the Six to return to normal and turn on him before they are interrupted by Lex teleporting him to the Godhead.\n\nA version of the Secret Six appeared in DC's alternate-universe imprint Tangent Comics, in the one-shot \"Secret Six\" #1 (December 1997), by writer Chuck Dixon and artist Tom Grummett. This team consists of the Atom (Adam Thompson), the Flash, the Joker, the Spectre (Taylor Pike), Plastic Man (Gunther Ganz), and Manhunter. The group also appear in the \"Tangent: Superman's Reign\" miniseries (2008).\n\nBane, Ragdoll, Jeanette, Scandal Savage, Catman, and Deadshot appear as the Secret Six soccer team, coached by Lobo. They are shown to be very good at the sport, but they are no match for Pantha of the Birds of Prey team.\n\nIn the \"Flashpoint\" reality, a version of the Secret Six called the Secret Seven appears; they are a secret organization of magic users. It consists of Shade, the Changing Man; Abra Kadabra; Amethyst; Enchantress (revealed to be a spy for the Amazons); Mindwarp; Raven and Zatanna. A three-issue miniseries documents Enchantress' manipulating of Shade into dismantling the Seven. This leads to Abra Kadabra denouncing the group publicly, and the deaths of Amethyst, Raven, Mindwarp and Zatanna.\n\nThe stories have been collected into trade paperbacks.\n\n\n\n"}

These agents are governed by the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Standard for Clean Agent Fire Extinguishing Systems – NFPA 2001 in the US, with different standards and regulations elsewhere. The system typically consists of the agent, agent storage containers, agent release valves, fire detectors, fire detection system (wiring control panel, actuation signaling), agent delivery piping, and agent dispersion nozzles. Less typically, the agent may be delivered by means of solid propellant gas generators that produce either inert or chemically active gas.\n\nThere are four means used by the agents to extinguish a fire. They act on the \"fire tetrahedron\":\n\n\nBroadly speaking, there are two methods for applying an extinguishing agent: total flooding and local application:\n\n\nIn the context of automatic extinguishing systems, local application generally refers to the use of systems that have been emplaced some time prior to their usage rather than the use of manually operated wheeled or portable fire extinguishers, although the nature of the agent delivery is similar and many automatic systems may also be activated manually. The lines are blurred somewhat with portable automatic extinguishing systems, although these are not common.\n\nAn extinguishing system which is primarily based on inert gases in enclosed spaces presents a risk of suffocation. Some incidents have occurred where individuals in these spaces have been killed by carbon dioxide agent release (only in the case of CO carbon dioxide systems). When installed according to fire codes the systems have an excellent safety record. To prevent such occurrences, additional life safety systems are typically installed with a warning alarm that precedes the agent release. The warning, usually an audible and visible alert, advises the immediate evacuation of the enclosed space. After a preset time, the agent starts to discharge. Accidents have also occurred during maintenance of these systems, so proper safety precautions must be taken beforehand.\n\nBarotrauma is physical damage to body tissues caused by a difference in pressure between a gas space inside, or in contact with the body, and the surrounding environment. The positive pressure caused by these gases may be sufficient to break windows and walls. Humans and structures must be adequately protected and ventilation/blow-off must be considered when designing the system.\n\n\n"}

They were dated 1854 and were dedicated to his friend Julius Otto Grimm. Their composition coincided with the beginning of the composer's lifelong affection for Clara Schumann, the wife of Robert Schumann, who was helping Brahms launch his career. Frédéric Chopin had written the last of his famous ballades only 12 years earlier, but Brahms approached the genre differently from Chopin, choosing to take its origin in narrative poetry more literally.\n\nBrahms's ballades are arranged in two pairs of two, the members of each pair being in parallel keys. The first ballade was inspired by a Scottish poem \"Edward\" found in a collection \"Stimmen der Völker in ihren Liedern\" compiled by Johann Gottfried Herder. It is also one of the best examples of Brahms's bardic or Ossianic style; its open fifths, octaves, and simple triadic harmonies are supposed to evoke the sense of a mythological past. \n\n\nThe tonal center of each ballade conveys an interconnectedness between the four pieces: the first three each include the key signature of the ballade that follows it somewhere as a tonal center, and the fourth ends in the key signature of D major/B minor despite cadencing in B major. \n\nBrahms returned to the wordless ballade form in writing the third of the Six Pieces for Piano, Op. 118. His Op. 75 vocal duets titled \"Ballads and Romances\" include a setting of the poem \"Edward\"—the same that inspired Op. 10, No. 1.\n\nA number of famous pianists have played some or all of the Ballades, including Grigory Sokolov, Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli, Artur Rubinstein, Emil Gilels, Sviatoslav Richter, Glenn Gould, Wilhelm Kempff, Idil Biret, Julius Katchen, Krystian Zimerman and Claudio Arrau.\n\n"}

Most of the KPP's leaders and activists perished in the Soviet Union during Joseph Stalin's Great Purge in the 1930s, and the party was abolished by the Communist International (Comintern) in 1938.\n\nIn 1939, World War II began and Poland was conquered by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. The government of the Polish Republic went into exile. In 1942, Polish communists in German-occupied Poland established a new Polish communist party, the Polish Workers' Party (\"Polska Partia Robotnicza\", PPR). Władysław Gomułka soon became its leader. But in the Soviet Union, Stalin and Wanda Wasilewska created the Union of Polish Patriots as a communist organization under Soviet control. As Germany was being defeated, the Polish communists cooperated with the Soviet Union, in opposition to the Polish government-in-exile, to establish a Soviet-dependent Polish state. This led to the creation of the Polish People's Republic. The PPR merged with the Polish Socialist Party (\"Polska Partia Socjalistyczna\", PPS), to form the Polish United Workers' Party (\"Polska Zjednoczona Partia Robotnicza\", PZPR), which ruled Poland until 1989. In post-World War II Poland, the communists initially enjoyed significant popular support due to the land reform, a mass scale rebuilding program and progressive social policies. The popular support eroded because of repressions, economic difficulties, and the lack of freedoms, but the PZPR was kept in power for four decades under the Soviet influence. \n\nDuring this period, some Polish academics and philosophers, including Leszek Kołakowski, Tadeusz Kotarbiński, Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz, and Stanisław Ossowski, tried to develop a form of \"Polish Marxism\", as part of the revisionist Marxist movement. These efforts to create a bridge between Poland's history and Marxist ideology were mildly successful, especially in comparison to similar attempts elsewhere in the Eastern Bloc. But they were stifled by the regime's unwillingness to risk stepping too far in the reformist direction.\n\nIn post-1989 democratic Poland, declared communists have had a minimal impact on the political and economical life of the country. However, former communists, including members of the Politburo of the PZPR, remained active on the political scene after the transition to democracy. Some were democratically elected to top national leadership positions (e.g. Aleksander Kwaśniewski, who was a two-term president of the Polish Republic). Their center-left party, the Democratic Left Alliance (\"Sojusz Lewicy Demokratycznej\", SLD), was one of the major political parties in Poland and was represented in the \"Sejm\" (Polish national parliament) until 2015. The influence of the so-called post-communists on the formation of the present democratic Constitution of Poland was essential.\n\n\n\n"}

Founded in 1976, it is the second oldest of the TASIS Schools, a Swiss group of American international boarding schools. \n\nLocated in Thorpe, Runnymeade, in the County of Surrey, the school enrolls approximately 650 pupils, from around the world.\n\nTASIS stands for The American School in Switzerland. TASIS England was originally set up as a branch of that school based in Surrey, England. Its relationship to the Swiss base of TASIS (other than common ownership) is that of a sister school. TASIS England was founded in 1976 by Mary Crist Fleming by way of expansion. TASIS England is the second oldest of five American schools in England.\n\nTASIS England's teacher student ratio is 1:8. The Upper School is college preparatory and currently operates on a block schedule.\n\nThe Lower and Middle Schools teach the American Core Knowledge curriculum. The Upper School since 2005-2006 offers the International Baccalaureate together with the traditional American AP system.\n\nTASIS offers is an Academic Travel Program. During October break, Upper School students travel, if they wish, to various countries throughout the world.\n\nThe Fleming Theatre offers rehearsal and performance spaces. The Fleming Gallery has rotating displays that showcase student work. The Visual Arts is centered around the Fine Arts Center, with purpose-built Photography, Drawing & Painting, Ceramics, Sculpture and Printmaking spaces.\n\nTASIS England offers competitive soccer, volleyball, cross country, basketball, rugby, cheerleading, tennis and lacrosse at the varsity and junior varsity levels. Students travel throughout England and Europe for tournaments. TASIS is a member of the International Schools Sports Tournament (ISST) conference.\n\nThe 46-acre school campus is in two halves. The North site, separated by a public lane, has modern buildings set behind its largely administrative 17th century rebuilding of Thorpe manor house (with Georgian front elevation). The South site centers on the grand early 19th-century convent built in the grounds of Thorpe manor house, built in yellow brick featuring a two-storey splay sided bay with sash windows in splays and French windows. James Lander wrote an extensive history of the school and surrounding area in \"The Heart of Thorpe\".\n\nThe school is divided into North and South Campuses, separated by Coldharbour Lane. The Lower and Middle Schools form the North campus. Several dormatories, Thorpe House, Upper School cafeteria and Student Center (including a Starbucks area) are on the South campus.\n\nThe Council of International Schools (CIS), the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC), and the International Baccalaureate Organisation have all accredited TASIS England. The school is also inspected by Ofsted, the Office for Standards in Education of the UK government. An Ofsted inspection carried out in May 2016, rated the school as \"inadequate\" in eight of ten categories assessed. While a follow-up Ofsted inspection carried out in December 2016 found some improvements, the school still did not meet all of the independent school standards and national minimum standards for residential provision that were checked during this inspection. A further Ofsted inspection in September 2017 found that the school had improved and was meeting all of the independent school standards and national minimum standards for residential provision.\n\nCIS and NEASC inspected TASIS England in March 2016, and their report lists areas needing improvement, while also calling the school \"a forward-thinking school, developing new programs to meet the demands of a 21st century education and … [the School] benefits from strong and collaborative leadership.\"\n\n \n\n\n"}

In 1859 he was appointed director of Kew Observatory. He was elected professor of physics at Owens College, Manchester, and retained that chair until his death, which happened near Drogheda, in Ireland, on 19 December 1887. He was the author of several successful science textbooks, and also of the article on \"Terrestrial Magnetism\" in the ninth edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica.\n\nStewart was born on 1 November 1828 at 1 London Row in Leith (north of Edinburgh), the son of William Stewart a tea-merchant, and his wife, Jane Clouston. His father was involved in business in Great Britain and Australia.\n\nHe was educated at Dundee. He then studied Physics at the University of St Andrews, and the University of Edinburgh. Following his studies of physics at Edinburgh, he became assistant to James David Forbes in 1856. Forbes was especially interested in questions of heat, meteorology, and terrestrial magnetism, and it was to these that Stewart also mainly devoted himself.\n\nRadiant heat first claimed his attention, and by 1858 he had completed his first investigations into the subject. These yielded a remarkable extension of Pierre Prévost's \"Law of Exchanges,\" and enabled him to establish the fact that radiation is not a surface phenomenon, but takes place throughout the interior of the radiating body, and that the radiative and absorptive powers of a substance must be equal, not only for the radiation as a whole, but also for every constituent of it.\n\nIn recognition of this work he received in 1868 the Rumford Medal of the Royal Society, into which he had been elected six years before. Of other papers in which he dealt with this and kindred branches of physics may be mentioned \"Observations with a Rigid Spectroscope,\" \"Heating of a Disc by Rapid Motion in Vacuo,\" \"Thermal Equilibrium in an Enclosure Containing Matter in Visible Motion,\" and \"Internal Radiation in Uniaxal Crystals.\"\n\nIn 1859 he was appointed director of Kew Observatory, and there naturally became interested in problems of meteorology and terrestrial magnetism. In 1870, the year in which he was very seriously injured in a railway accident, he was elected professor of physics at Owens College, Manchester, and retained that chair until his death, which happened near Drogheda, in Ireland, on 19 December 1887.\n\nHe was the author of several successful textbooks of science, and also of the article on \"Terrestrial Magnetism\" in the ninth edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica. In conjunction with Professor P. G. Tait he wrote \"The Unseen Universe\", at first published anonymously, which was intended to combat the common notion of the incompatibility of science and religion.\n\nA devoted churchman, Stewart was prominently identified with the Society for Psychical Research. It was in his 1875 review of \"The Unseen Universe\", that William James first put forth his Will to Believe Doctrine.\n\nBalfour Stewart recorded remarkable geomagnetic disturbances on the evening of 28 August 1859 and the morning of 2 September 1859, at the Kew Observatory, and presented his findings in a paper presented to the Royal Society on 21 November 1861. \nHe noted that while \"magnetic disturbances of unusual violence and very wide extent\" were recorded in various places around the world, the Kew Observatory had the benefit of self-recording magnetographs, which allowed \"the means of obtaining a continuous photographic register of the state of the three elements of the earth’s magnetic force—namely, the declination, and the horizontal and vertical intensity.\"\n\nStewart went on the make the following observation.\n\nI now proceed to notice some of the peculiarities of this magnetic storm.\n\nIt appears that we have two distinct well-marked disturbances, each commencing abruptly and ending gradually, the first of which began on the evening of August 28 and the second on the early morning of September 2. These two great disturbances correspond therefore in point of time to the two great auroral displays already alluded to.\n\nThe second disturbance resulted from what is now known as the Carrington Super Flare, while the first disturbance is unnamed. As Stewart recorded and described this disturbance, this event will be referred to as the Stewart Super Flare in this discussion.\n\nAt the 11 November 1859 meeting of the Royal Astronomical Society, Richard Carrington presented a paper describing his observations of the super flare that occurred on 1 September, at 11:18 GMT and later named in his honor. In what appears to be an editorial addition made after the meeting the follow observation was appended in parenthesis.\n\nFrom this addendum, it is clear that Richard Carrington was not willing to commit professionally to connecting the magnetic disturbance with the event he had observed on the surface of the sun even though they occurred at nearly identical times.\nHe had indeed displayed the magnetographs at the Royal Astronomical Society meeting. The time of 11:20 GMT is good agreement with other reports but the time of 4:00 GMT on 2 September 1859 for the commencement of the magnetic storm is an hour earlier than reported by Stewart.\n\nStewart also reported on the magnetic disturbance that occurred at the same time as the event observed by Richard Carrington.\n\nBut, beside these two remarkable disturbances into which it divided itself, this great storm comprehends a minor disturbance, not approaching these two in extent, but yet possessing an interest peculiar to itself, which entitles it to be mentioned.\n\nOn September 1, a little before noon, Mr. R.C. Carrington happened to be observing, by means of a telescope, a large spot which might then be seen on the surface of our luminary, when a remarkable appearance presented itself, which he described in a communications to the Royal Astronomical Society.\n\nOn calling at Kew Observatory a day or two afterwards, Mr. Carrington learned that at the very moment when he had observed this phenomena the three magnetic elements at Kew were simultaneously disturbed. If no connexion had been known to subsist between these two classes of phenomena, it would, perhaps, be wrong to consider this in any other light than a casual coincidence; but since General Sabine has proved that a relation subsists between magnetic disturbances and sun spots, it is not impossible to suppose that in this case our luminary was taken \"in the act\".\n\nThis disturbance occurred as nearly as possible at 11 15 Greenwich mean time, on September 1, 1859, affecting all the elements simultaneously, and commencing quite abruptly.\n\nBy citing the previous research of Edward Sabine, which established a correlation between sunspots and magnetic storms, Stewart was able to correctly advance the theory that the event observed by Richard Carrington and the magnetic disturbance that was recorded at the same time were in fact connected. The magnetic phenomena that occurred at about 11:18 GMT on 1 September 1859 are now known as a Solar Flare Effect (SFE) or a Magnetic Crochet, but the connection would not be proven for another 80 years. The SFE is a sudden ionosphere disturbances caused by soft X-rays and Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) driven enhancement of the ionosphere current vortices responsible for the regular daily variation observed on magnetometer traces. SFE are mostly observed in locations close to the sub-solar point (i.e. the point on earth when the sun is overhead) and can only be observed from stations in the sunlit hemisphere at the time of the solar flare. Using Stewart's times, the magnetic storm associated with the Carrington Super Flare took 17 hours and 45 minutes to reach the Earth.\n\nStewart reported that the magnetic storm from the Stewart Super Flare, began at 22:30 GMT on the evening of 28 August 1859 as recorded by self-recording magnetographs at the Kew Observatory. Assuming that the transit time for the first super flare was the same as the second or 17 hours and 45 minutes, the Stewart Super Flare occurred at about 04:45 GMT on the morning of 28 August 1859. As the Solar Flare Effect can only be observed from the sunlit hemisphere the question becomes, what time was sunrise at the Kew Observatory on the morning of 28 August 1859?\n\nThe coordinates for Kew Observatory are (51°29'N, 0°17'W). Using the US Naval Observatory \"Sun or Moon Rise/Set Table for One Year\" calculator, sunrise on the morning of 28 August 1859 sunrise was 05:06GMT. The Kew Observatory was still 21 minutes from sunrise and the Solar Flare Effect would not have been registered by the self-recording magnetographs at the Kew Observatory.\n\nStewart did not publish the magnetograph records for the morning of 28 August 1859. While it is extremely unlikely, the original magnetograph records for that date should be inspected to determine if any disturbance was recorded because of the uncertainties in timings and the nearness of sunrise.\n\nIn the time zone at GMT+7 it would have been 15 minutes to high noon on 28 August. Any observatory situated at plus or minus two time zones would have been in an excellent position to observe the super flare and record the magnetic signature of Solar Flare Effect. Unfortunately in 1859 the Kew Observatory had the only self-recording magnetographs. Other magnetic observatories were manually operated and typically only took readings at hourly intervals unless there was a magnetic storm, in which case readings were taken at 15-minute intervals. One such magnetic observatory was the Colaba Observatory on the Island of Colaba which is now part of Mumbai (Bombay), India at GMT+5.5. In a 2003 paper the manually recorded magnetic readings from the Colaba Observatory for 1 September, through 2 September 1859 were recalibrated and evaluated. No mention is made in this paper of reading before 1 September or any visual observations of the sun. After 150 years it is very unlikely that any additional data will surface but any reports of strange events about noon Asian time on 28 August 1859 would be of interest.\n\n\n"}

The station has an English language news/talk radio format and identifies itself on-air as \"CJAD 800\". Owned and operated by Bell Media, it has a daytime power of 50,000 watts but reduces power to 10,000 watts at night to avoid interfering with other stations on AM 800. The transmitter is located near Saint-Edouard, while studios and offices are located on Rene-Levesque Boulevard East in Downtown Montreal. CJAD can be heard across Canada on Bell TV channel 953.\n\nLocal hosts are heard throughout the day and evening with a few syndicated shows also carried: \"Coast to Coast AM\" with George Noory. Affiliated with CBS Radio for many years, in 2018 the station, along with many other Bell-owned talk radio stations in Canada, switched to NBC Radio and 24/7 News for U.S. and international news.\n\nCJAD and co-owned 690 CKGM are currently the only two full-time commercial English-language stations in Quebec on the AM dial.\n\nCJAD was founded by J. Arthur Dupont in 1945, basing the call sign on his initials. CJAD is often called Montreal's heritage anglophone station, particularly since the demise of the city's oldest anglophone station, CINW (successor to CFCF, Canada's first radio station). CJAD signed on the air on December 8, 1945. In its first years, CJAD had its studios and offices on Rue de la Montagne (Mountain Street) in Montreal, now the site of O'Sullivan College.\n\nIn 1961, CJAD was purchased by Standard Broadcasting. In 1978, control of Standard Broadcasting was purchased by Conrad Black via Hollinger Inc. In 1985, Standard was purchased by Slaight Communications, a privately held company owned by J. Allan Slaight.\n\nIn 1962, sister station 95.9 CJFM was launched, with programming always separate from CJAD.\n\nFor most of its history, CJAD had a full service format. The music was mainly middle of the road songs in the 1960s and 70s, switching to an adult contemporary sound by the 1980s. Two specialized shows were heard on weekends: \"The Bandstand\" with Dick Irvin Jr., and \"Starlight Concert\" with Rod Dewar. In 1995, CJAD shifted its format to full-time news/talk, dropping all music and entertainment, save for the Sunday morning Trivia Show and the CJAD Comedy Show, also heard on Sundays.\n\nStarting in 1992, almost all of CJAD's programming was simulcast on Corus Entertainment-owned AM 900 CKTS in Sherbrooke. On November 19, 2006, CKTS ceased broadcasting, signing off the transmitter and surrendering its licence to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC). According to Corus, this was because of high ongoing maintenance costs that neither Corus nor Standard were willing to cover.\n\nIn April 2007, Astral Media and Standard Broadcasting announced that Standard had agreed to sell CJAD and its other Montreal stations to Astral. On March 16, 2012, Bell Media announced that it had entered in an agreement to acquire Astral Media for an estimated value at $3.38 billion, with the deal including CJAD and its sister radio stations in Montreal.\n\nOn Labour Day Weekend, 2012, CJAD, as well as its sister stations previously owned by Astral, moved from 1411 Fort Street to new facilities in the Bell Media Radio building on Rene-Levesque Boulevard East at Papineau Avenue.\n\nIn January 1998, all four of CJAD's broadcast towers toppled during The Ice Storm. CJAD's first attempt to get back on the air was to use CKGM's former AM 980 transmitter, re-tuned to the 800 frequency. This, however, turned out to be impossible as the 980 site was damaged by ice as well. CJAD then made arrangements to broadcast on CFMB's former 1410 transmitter, but the signal was poor to the west. CJAD management then reached an agreement with CHUM Limited to use their CKGM transmitter on 990 kHz until new towers were erected.\n\nA large part of CJAD800's daily programs are talk shows discussing local and international news. CJAD800 broadcasts newscasts every 30 minutes, except overnights when newscasts are delivered every hour, on the hour. Live @ Five is a half-hour news program broadcast at 5 a.m. on weekdays. Traffic updates air every 15 minutes during the day and every 30 minutes late nights.\n\nOn weekdays, veteran anchors Andrew Peplowski and Trudie Mason deliver morning newscasts, with Jason Mayoff and Richard Deschamps taking over in the afternoons. Kelly Lapare is the evening weekday anchor on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays, with Luciano Pipia delivering newscasts on Thursday and Friday evenings (Pipia is also CJAD's weekend afternoon anchor). Shawn Dearn serves as anchor on weekend mornings, and Benson Cook takes over from Pipia on Saturday and Sunday evenings.\n\nOvernight news is read during the week by James Foster, who is also a frequent fill-in at the morning anchor's desk. Longtime anchor and reporter Tom Armour retired in 2015.\n\nSince October 2019, CJAD 800's daytime reporters are Elizabeth Zogalis and Shuyee Lee, with Lee also serving as the station's assignment editor. Weekend anchor Benson Cook also frequently does reporting work for the station.\n\nSome of the station's notable former reporters include Patrick Lejtenyi, Angelica Montgomery, Tina Tenneriello, Matthew Gilmour, Michel Boyer, Natalie Nanowski, Taylor C. Noakes, Andrew Brennan and Emily Campbell.\n\nCJAD is the exclusive English radio broadcaster of the CFL's Montreal Alouettes. Some game broadcasts are simulcast on sister station CHOM 97.7 FM. CJAD was the longtime English radio home of the Montreal Canadiens hockey team, until the 2010-11 season. In June 2010 it was announced that Canadiens broadcasts would switch to sports radio station CKGM, now on AM 690 and co-owned with CJAD.\n\nIn July 2012, Bell Media, owners of CKGM, announced that English-language rights to the Canadiens could return to CJAD following its proposed acquisition of Astral Media, if its conversion of CKGM to a French-language sports station (which would have been done to satisfy ownership limits preventing the merged company from owning both CJAD and CKGM if they both broadcast in English) were approved by the CRTC. On October 18, 2012, the CRTC rejected Bell's proposal to acquire Astral Media; since the application to convert CKGM into a French station was contingent on the approval of the Astral merger, it too was rejected.\n\nOn March 5, 2012, it was announced that CJAD would be the exclusive English language radio broadcaster of Montreal Impact soccer team for the next two years.\n\nBeginning in September 2013, CKGM (TSN 690) staffers began providing sports updates for co-owned CJAD. Until recently, Rick Moffat did the weekday morning sports, Mitch Gallo does the weekday afternoon sports, and Amanda Stein does the weekend morning sports for CJAD as well as TSN 690.\n\nCJAD broadcasts with 50,000 watts in the daytime, the maximum power permitted for Canadian AM stations. At night, power drops to 10,000 watts to avoid interfering with other stations using the 800 frequency, such as the country music-formatted CJBQ in Belleville, Ontario, the now-dark CHRC in Quebec City (which is approximately 250 miles [160 km] away and was shut down in September 2012), and CKLW in Windsor, Ontario. CJAD must also protect the Class A station on AM 800, XEROK in Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, Mexico. CJAD's antenna is a four-tower array, located near Saint-Edouard, using two different directional patterns for day and night.\n\n\n\n"}

The band derives its name from Preservation Hall in the French Quarter. In 2005, the Hall's doors were closed for a period of time due to Hurricane Katrina, but the band continued to tour.\n\nIn the 1950s Larry Borenstein, an art dealer from Milwaukee, managed Preservation Hall in the French Quarter as an art gallery. To attract customers, he invited local New Orleans jazz musicians to play. After their honeymoon in 1961, Allan Jaffe and his wife Sandra visited to hear some traditional New Orleans jazz. The Jaffes were from Pennsylvania. Allan Jaffe was a tuba player who had graduated from the Wharton School of Business in Philadelphia, while his wife had been employed at an advertising agency. They attended concerts, grew to love the French Quarter, and stayed longer than they had intended. Borenstein asked if they wanted to manage Preservation Hall, and they agreed.\n\nAllan Jaffe hired local musicians whose ages ranged from the 60s to the 90s. Many were struggling with poverty, racism, and illness. At first the Jaffes served no alcohol, used no amplification, and didn't advertise. In 1963, Allan Jaffe began to tour with bands in the U.S. and in other countries. These tours included such popular figures as pianist Sweet Emma Barrett, trumpeter Kid Thomas Valentine, brothers Percy Humphrey and Willie Humphrey, trumpeter De De Pierce and his wife, pianist Billie Pierce. The most popular was clarinetist George Lewis, whose reputation preceded the Hall. Fans from all over the world came to New Orleans to hear traditional jazz.\n\nBarrett's health began to decline in the 1970s, which forced her to stop touring. She was replaced as leader by brothers Percy Humphrey (trumpet) and Willie Humphrey (clarinet). The lineup included Frank Demond (trombone), James Prevost (bass), James \"Sing\" Miller (piano), Cie Frazier (drums), Jim Robinson (trombone), Narvin Kimball (banjo), and Allan Jaffe (tuba).\n\nDuring the late 1960s and early 1970s, many of the touring members were hired by Harold Dejan for his Olympia Brass Band. This band became not only a staple at Preservation Hall, but also influenced the Preservation Hall Jazz Band and future Preservation Hall musicians.\n\nDejan's regular sidemen included Andy Anderson (trumpet), Milton Batiste (trumpet), Kid Sheik Cola (trumpet), Paul Crawford (trombone) Gerald Joseph (trombone), Emanuel Paul (tenor saxophone), Andrew Jefferson (snare), John Smith, Henry \"Booker T\" Glass, Nowell \"Papa\" Glass. Cag Cagnolatti, Kid Thomas Valentine, Louis Nelson, Louis Cottrell, Jr., Cié Frazier, Emanuel Sayles, and Allan Jaffe on tuba were among those who played with the group. During the Olympia years, a young Harry Connick Jr. performed with Barrett and the band at Preservation Hall.\n\nIn 1977, Jaffe and Arthur Hall and his Afro-American Dance Ensemble released \"Fat Tuesday and All That Jazz! A Mardi Gras Dance Musical\". The world premiere of the dance musical was on February 19, 1977, and was followed by a tour in the United States. Dejan's Olympia Brass Band was featured in \"Fat Tuesday and All That Jazz\", in addition to the Arthur Hall Afro-American Dance Ensemble of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\nIn 1987 Allan Jaffe died of cancer at the age of fifty-one. After his son Ben graduated from Oberlin College, he became artistic director in 1993. Ben Jaffe toured with the Preservation Hall Jazz Band, playing double bass and tuba. He began the educational initiatives that his father developed.\n\n\"As many as 20 different bands, drawn from a pool of about 150 local musicians, had played at Preservation Hall in the 1960s, but by 1999 virtually all of the older generation of musicians had died and the band members were a mixture of younger African-American players and white musicians from overseas. Most notable among the former were Michael White (ii), Wendell Brunious (who gradually took over the leadership of Valentine's band in the elder trumpeter's final years, as well as the touring band), Freddie Lonzo, and the tuba player Walter Payton; Europeans included the Swedish pianist Lars Edegran, the English trumpeter Clive Wilson, Orange Kellin, and Jacques Gauthé\" (Hazeldine, Kernfeld).\n\nThe Preservation Hall Jazz Band continued to tour nationally and internationally. The band was led by trumpeter Wendell Brunious, later replaced by his older brother, John Brunious.\n\nIn 2006, the Preservation Hall Jazz Band was awarded the National Medal of Arts, the nation's highest honor for artistic excellence. The award was presented Benjamin Jaffe and co-founder of Preservation Hall, Sandra Jaffe, who accepted the award from President and Mrs. Laura Bush in an Oval Office ceremony on November 9, 2006. The citations read: \"With enormous talent and pride, this ageless ensemble has toured the world displaying the unbreakable spirit of New Orleans and sharing the joy of New Orleans jazz with us all.\"\n\nNearing Preservation Hall's 45th anniversary, the band collaborated with musicians from other genres, such as Blind Boys of Alabama on their Grammy Award winning album, \"Down in New Orleans\".

It is privately owned but open to the public.\nAlthough the site's use by the College students dates back to at least the 1860s, the Arboretum began in 1922 when Mr. and Mrs. George A. Slayton donated 14 acres (5.7 hectares) to Hillsdale College. By 1924, the first donated plantings were in place, led by Professor Bertram A. Barber. A pond was excavated in 1928, and a field station, a hillside rock garden, waterfall, and pump house were added in 1929. In the early 1930s two bridges were added, and an amphitheater built in the late 1930s on the site of a former gravel pit.\n\nOn October 17, 1999 the Arboretum was the site of a suicide or murder when Lissa Jackson Roche, the managing editor of Hillsdale College Press, was found dead of a gunshot wound after claiming that she and her father-in-law, the college's president, had been involved in a nineteen-year extramarital affair.\n\nThe initial period of development of Slayton Arboretum under Professor Barber resulted in an intimate botanical garden much loved by students and alumni of Hillsdale College as well as the residents of Hillsdale. It was the focal point for student outdoor activity in biology and ecology. The rock gardens, waterfalls, gazebos, amphitheater and rustic cement bridges have survived virtually intact. The arboretum occupies the site of a disused gravel pit, and it is the distinct topography of the site along with the coniferous trees planted during Barber's directorship that provide the garden with its special charm. These original plantings matured over forty years of benign neglect following the demise of Professor Barber.\n\nIn the early 1990s the arboretum was re-discovered as an important asset to the college and recovery of the site was begun under the direction of Dr. David Crabtree. Alumni and student support for the renewal of plantings and the conservation of the original structural elements was important in the restoration of the gardens during this time period. Today the gardens are notable for stately mature trees, semi-natural settings, and collections of conifers, magnolia, viburnum, witchhazel, mountain ash, maple, oak, and hickory as well as several genera of hardy deciduous shrubs.\n\nThe site is of considerable interest to ecologists in that several species of exotic woody shrubs have naturalized in the area to the exclusion of the native woody flora. The exotic shrubs that have become rampant are common buckthorn and common privet. Preferential deer herbivory of native species seems to be the primary cause of this invasion, and a deer exclusion has been attempted. The arboretum also has heavy and repeated infestation with Japanese beetle and this may also play a role in the dynamics of the shrub community which has developed in the garden over the last seventy years. The arboretum is currently directed by Dr. Ranessa Cooper and hosts art programs and children's programs during the summer.\n\nAs of late 2013 the arboretum underwent a renovation. The college has added a waterfall and the arboretum is open to the public once again.\n\n\n"}

It advocated Breton nationalism through \"direct action\" and published a secret manual aimed at instructing readers in terrorism. The phrase \"Gwenn ha du\" is the nickname for the Breton flag, which is in these colours.\n\nIn July 1932, Gwenn ha Du decided to destroy a monument it found particularly offensive: a statue created by Jean Boucher marking the union of Brittany and France in 1532. Its unveiling some twenty years earlier triggered the first protest by Breton Nationalists. Célestin Lainé made a bomb in his bedroom, consisting of a condensed milk carton filled with nitroglycerine. In the early hours of August 7, he set the bomb behind the head of the King of France's statue in the facade opposite the mayor's office. At 4:00 a.m., the bomb detonated, shattering the bronze statue and all glass within 100 metres. On August 7, the group claimed responsibility for the attack, which was intended to coincide with the 400th anniversary celebration of the union, taking place in Vannes under the guidance of French prime minister Édouard Herriot. \"L'Humanité\", the French Communist Party newspaper, spoke out the day after, protesting that Herriot didn't mention that all Celtic civilisation was wiped out, the refusal to acknowledge the Breton language and culture. The authorities arrested six militants on August 11; the six remained imprisoned for fifty days.\n\nThe Gwenn ha du, which presented itself as the unofficial military wing of the Parti National Breton, followed up with a few months of action. On November 20, Gwenn ha du members detonated a bomb on the railway line between Ingrandes and Champtocé, not long before Édouard Herriot's arrival there. The train stopped in front of the damaged rails. However, Herriot eventually got to Nantes in time to celebrate the act of the Union between Brittany and France. Three more attacks followed: April 13, 1936, with arson in four préfectures; December 18, 1938, with the blowing up of a monument (the Monument de la Fédération bretonne-angevine in Pontivy); and the attack in the préfecture of Quimper on February 28, 1939.\n\nA last attack was suspected on 13th of May 1941 against Carhaix gendarmerie station after a statement was sent to members of the National Council in Vichy, threatening more attacks if the borders of the traditional province of Brittany were not recognised. After this the group ceased to function, its members becoming part of various milice groups working with the German occupying forces. Lainé himself led the Bezen Perrot militia, which included former Gwenn ha du activists. After the war, surviving members were either captured or fled France. Some were later associated with the Liberation Front of Brittany, which was active in the 1960s.\n\n"}

It has a population of 16,332.\nSierre is nicknamed City of the Sun () for its average of 300 days of sunshine a year.\n\nIt is the last official French speaking city in Valais before the French–German language border of the canton located at the forêt de Finges, few kilometres after the town. A German-speaking minority lives in Sierre, as it counts around 8% of the population.\n\nSierre is first mentioned about 800 as \"Sidrium\", though a 12th-century document refers to the village being founded in 515. In 1179 it was mentioned as \"Sirro\" and in 1393 as \"Syder\".\n\nThe area around the modern town, especially Gerunden hill, was settled very early. Archeological sites on Gerunden hill have produced neolithic objects and grave goods (including a polished stone ax), Bronze Age weapons and jewelry, Early Iron Age objects and Roman era inscriptions, jars, jewelry and coins. A soapstone pot from the Early Middle Ages and a gold signet ring with the name Graifarius from the 6th century have also been found. Other sites on nearby hills and near the chapel of Saint-Ginier, the Château de Villa, the churches of Sainte-Croix, Grands-Prés, Muraz, Glarey and Bernunes have yielded up graves originating from the Bronze Age to the Carolingian era. In Grands-Prés there is a fire pit from the beginning of the Late Iron Age (5th–6th century BC).\n\nDuring the Roman era it appears that there was no major population center, but rather several scattered groupings of separate, upper class dwellings. Under the chapel of Saint-Ginier, the remains of a Roman era house or estate have been discovered. Other Roman ruins have been found near the Château de Villa, in the church of Sainte-Croix (small terraced bath), in Grands-Prés by Muraz another house and in Gerunden the remains of buttress reinforced masonry indicate that a public or government building once stood there. Five altars were found in Saint-Ginier, along with another two in the scattered settlements, one of which was dedicated to Mercury. During the early imperial period, the \"duumvir\" or mayor of the \"Civitas Vallensium\", Caius Cominus Chiu, lived in Sierre. In the late imperial period, the family of the senator of Vinelia Modestina also lived in the area.\n\nThe chapel of Saint-Félix was built in the 5th or the beginning of the 6th century on Gerunden hill.\n\nIn 515 the estate at Sierre was given by the King of Burgundy Sigismund to the Abbey of Saint-Maurice to hold as a fief. By the 11th century, the fief of Sierre was owned by the Bishop of Sion. The aristocratic families and the residents of the fief lived on the Gerunden, Vieux-Sierre and Plantzette hills. On each of these hills there was a castle that served as the residence for the Bishop's representatives and as a refuge for the population. The castles were razed in the mid-14th century when the noble families stood with the Bishop in his war with the Zenden of the Upper Valais and Counts of Savoy. The demolished castles and villages were abandoned and most residents settled farther north, in plan-Sierre. The only castle that survived the wars of the 14th century was Goubing Castle, southeast of Sierre, which belonged to the lords of Granges.\n\nThe Contrée of Sierre was originally a group the managed the commons. As vassals of the Bishop, they had the right to assemble twice a year to regulate the management of the common lands and the affairs of the local police. In the 14th and 15th century this cooperative adopted a larger political role as they started to administer more of the daily affairs in the villages and acquired the right to appoint their own judges. Eventually this grew into the Noble Contrée which then formed the core of Sierre Zenden from which the city of Sierre later developed. The town of Plan-Sierre soon took over the leadership role in the Noble Contrée. Until 1798, the Noble Contrée was appointed by a council of village representatives, under the leadership of the Bishop's representative. In 1559, Plan-Sierre divided into four quarters Villa, Monderèche, La Salla and Glarey. In 1620, the town hall was built.\n\nAs the capital of a Zenden, Sierre fought the French in the 1798–99 invasion. In 1799, the city was occupied by French and Vaudois troops. The French set up their headquarters in Sierre.\n\nIn the conflicts between the conservative Upper Valais and the liberal Lower Valais, Sierre served as the seat of government in 1839–40. After 1848, the villages of the Noble Contrée became municipalities under the Valais cantonal constitution. The Zenden of Sierre became the District of Sierre with Sierre as the capital. The new city executive council had nine members, while of the General Council (legislature) had 60. Initially, the majority of the power was held by the Conservatives (now the Christian Democrats). In 1913, they were joined by the Liberals, in 1945 the Social Democrats and in 2004 the Greens.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, Sierre became economically important as very early aluminium smelting is enabled by its access to hydroelectricity. Today the aluminium industry Novelis and Alcan employs 1,200 workers in Chippis and Sierre.\n\nIn 2007, the agglomeration of Sierre/Crans-Montana was formed to address created to common problems, especially in the fields of tourism and transportation.\n\nSierre has an area, , of .

He played his last match in Serie A on 15 April 1934, in a 2–1 win over Brescia. In total Combi played for 13 seasons with Juventus, totaling 348 Serie A matches and another 16 games in the Central European Cup, an international competition for clubs where Juventus played four consecutive semi-finals from 1932 to 1935 to claim the record for most appearances by a goalkeeper for the club (370), a record he held for more than 40 years until Dino Zoff overtook him in the 1970s (476 matches), followed by Stefano Tacconi in the 1980s (377 matches), and subsequently Gianluigi Buffon.\n\nCombi's first match for the Italian national team was in Budapest, at the age of 21, on 6 April 1924 in a 7–1 loss against Hungary. He returned in \"Azzurro\" a year and seven games later when the Technical Commission, made up of Rangone, Giuseppe Milano and Baccani selected him to play against France in Turin on 22 March 1925. This match was played in \"Corso Marsiglia\" Stadium and this time the large score was in favor of the \"Azzurri\", a victory of 7–0. After this match Combi never looked back and for the next ten years it was extremely rare to see another goalkeeper defending the Italian posts.\n\nThe 1928 Olympic Games were held in Amsterdam and this time Combi formed part of the squad and defended the Italian squad for the rest of the tournament: Quarter Final against Spain 1–1 after extra time, Quarter Final Replay against Spain 7–1, Semi Final against Uruguay 2–3 and 3rd Place Final against Egypt 11–3. With this result on 10 June 1928 in the Olympisch Stadion of Amsterdam, the \"Azzurri\" won their first honour: the Bronze Medal of the 9th edition of the Olympic games.\n\nOther triumphs followed, the next being the winning of the inaugural Central European International Cup, a predecessor cup of the European Nations Cup held between the National teams of Central Europe. In these matches Italy lost against Matěj Šindelář's Austria 0–3 in Vienna but won all the others, against Switzerland 3–2 in Zurich, against Czechoslovakia 4–2 in Bologna and the last match against Hungary on 11 May 1930.\n\nCombi made his debut as the Italian captain in his 33rd game on 15 November 1931.\n\nAround the beginning of 1934, 31-year-old Gianpiero Combi was preparing to retire from football. In this season he was on the way to winning his fifth Italian championship (a record fourth in a row) with Juventus and he had played more than 40 games for the national team. A new promising young goalkeeper was emerging: Carlo Ceresoli, who played for Inter. On his debut Ceresoli had helped the national team to qualify for the 1934 World Cup which was held in Italy that summer, by eliminating Greece in Milano by a 4–0 win. But the National Coach Vittorio Pozzo included Combi in the Italian squad - he was also one of the \"Nazio-Juve\" members - and was asked by Pozzo to postpone his retirement until the end of the tournament as his experience might be a great help. During a training session a few weeks before the beginning of the tournament, a shot by Pietro Arcari broke one of Ceresoli's forearms. This forced him to miss the World Cup and Combi again found himself the top goalkeeper in Italy, with the responsibility of leading the \"Azzurri\" to their debut in football's premier competition.\n\nThe first match was on 27 May 1934 when Italy played the first round of the World Cup in the Stadio Nazionale of the P.N.F. in Rome against the United States. The \"Azzurri\" beat their opponents 7–1, a victory provided by a hat trick from Angelo Schiavio, a \"double\" from Raimundo Orsi and a goal each from Giovanni Ferrari and Meazza. In the Quarter-finals the Italians met Spain, who were led by another great goalkeeper of the time, Ricardo Zamora. The game was played on 31 May 1934 in the Stadio Comunale \"Giovanni Berta\" of Florence. The game against the Spanish team was a very difficult one, dominated by the speed and force used by both teams and finished in a 1–1 draw after extra time. A replay had to be played the next day, in which Italy changed four players and Spain seven. Italy won 1–0 with a goal by Meazza.\nTheir semi-final opponents were the Austrian \"Wunderteam\", the squad who had beaten the Italians 4–2 in Turin four months earlier. The match was played in Milano's Stadio Calcistico San Siro on 3 June and the \"Azzurri\" won 1–0 with a goal by Enrico Guaita. Combi was also decisive when he made two miraculous saves to keep the score in favor of Italy until the end. The final was held in Rome on 10 June 1934 against Czechoslovakia. The first half finished without a goal but in the 71st minute, against all odds, Antonin Puč managed to beat the Italian goalkeeper. Ten minutes later Orsi equalized and the game went to extra-time. With the help of a noisy support, so great that the rival coach Pozzo had to continually run along the pitch so that the players could hear his instructions, Italy won the match through a goal by Schiavio and the Italian team were crowned World Champions. Gianpiero Combi, who played 510 minutes and conceded three goals as captain of the squad, received the Jules Rimet trophy from the Italian Dictator Benito Mussolini.\n\nA year later, in November 1935, Combi played only five of the eight matches in the International Cup and in his absence the Italian team won the trophy. He totalled 47 caps for the Italian team, 5 of which were as captain.\n\nAlthough he had stopped playing football, his passion for the sport remained all his life and he still held a number of unofficial positions with Juventus. He offered advice to the technical staff and also served as a scout. In 1951 the Italian Football Federation offered him the job of technical commissioner for the Italian national team with Carlino Beretta and Toni Busini. They led the National Team for seven months, from 8 April to 25 November 1951 in which time the Italian squad played 5 games without any losses. They won 4–1 against Portugal and France, and drew against Yugoslavia (0–0), Sweden (1–1) and Switzerland (1–1) - the only competitive game of the five.\n\nHe died in Imperia on 12 August 1956, aged 53.\n\nDespite his relatively small stature for a player in his position, Combi was a commanding keeper, who possessed notable strength, which he combined with his elegance, agility, intelligence, shot-stopping ability, positional sense, and excellent technique; throughout his career, he stood out in particular due to his consistency, efficient goalkeeping style, and composure, rather than flamboyance, even though he was capable of producing spectacular diving saves when necessary. He is regarded as one of the greatest goalkeepers of all time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n"}
{"id": "2205324", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2205324", "title": "South African Institute of Chartered Accountants", "text": "South African Institute of Chartered Accountants\n\nThe South African Institute of Chartered Accountants (SAICA), is a professional accountancy body in South Africa.\n\nAs of August 2013, the institute has over 36 000 members. \"SAICA\" provides support, advice and services to its CAs throughout their professional lives. \"SAICA\" members are business advisors, business leaders and entrepreneurs. SAICA members can use the CA(SA) designation.\n\nTo become a student and a member of South African Institute of Chartered Accountants the candidate needs to enroll for a BCom Accounting degree or an equivalent CA(SA) undergraduate qualification at a SAICA accredited university.\nOnce the degree is completed the student is required to complete his Certificate in the Theory of Accounting (CTA). This course focuses on accounting, auditing, taxation and financial management. The course takes a minimum of one year and must be completed at a SAICA accredited university.\nUpon completion of CTA, the candidates are eligible to enter into a 3-year learnership with a Registered Training Office (RTO) (to specialise in auditing) or an Approved Training Organisation (ATO) (to specialise in financial management)\n\nSAICA is constituted of four local regional offices as well as two international representative offices, which serve members based in those respective regions. The regions are as follows;\n\n\nSAICA members serve on international accounting bodies including; the trustees of the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation (IFRS Foundation), the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) and the Council of the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC).\n\nInternational contact and co-operation is fundamental to the standing and image of SAICA. Hence, the institute plays an influential role in the Eastern, Central & Southern African Federation of Accountants (ECSAFA). ECSAFA coordinates the development of the accountancy profession and promotes internationally recognised standards of professional competence and conduct in Eastern, Central and Southern Africa.\nSAICA was a charter member of the Pan African Federation of Accountants, which was inaugurated on 5 May 2011.\n\nSAICA is also a member of the Global Accounting Alliance (GAA) – an alliance of the world’s leading professional accountancy bodies, which was formed in 2005. The GAA is intended to promote quality services, share information and collaborate on important international issues. It works with national regulators, governments and stakeholders, through member-body collaboration, articulation of consensus views, and working in collaboration, where possible with other international bodies, especially IFAC.\n\nThe first professional institute for accountants in South Africa was the Institute of Accountants and Auditors, formed in the South African Republic in Johannesburg in 1894 with 65 members. A year later the Institute of Accountants in Natal was established. The need to regulate the profession lead to the further establishment of various provincial institutes. In a move towards standardization, the first articles of clerkship were instituted in 1905 and the first journal was published in 1909. Although it did not become a regular publication till 1954, the journal was the sole communication vehicle aimed directly at members and indicated a need for unification. Between 1905 and 1907 accounting societies were established naming Cape Colony, The Orange River Colony and Natal. By the end of 1907, the Transvaal Society of Accountants (which represented more than a half of the registered accountants in South Africa) had grown to 522 members. From the earliest times attempts were made to form a national body. The first meaningful step took place on 6 May 1921 when the South African Accounting Societies' General Examining Board was formed to conduct the examination process on behalf of the societies. The second major milestone on the road to unification occurred in 1927, when the Chartered Accountants Designation (Private) Act was passed by parliament. The Act provided protection for the CA(SA) allowing only members of the then provincial societies to use it.\n\nBut world and local politics at the time hampered efforts towards forming a national body and it was only in 1945 that the Joint Council of the Societies of Chartered Accountants (SA), which provided a forum for co-operation between the societies, was formed.\nIn 1950 all theoretical teaching and examining was handed over to universities, but the profession retained the right to set the qualifying examination. The first CTA examinations were held in 1951. The Public Accountants and Auditors Act was also promulgated in 1951 and it brought into place the regulation of accountants and auditors in public practice. The General Examining Board continued to set the qualifying examination until 1957 when it was taken over by the Public Accountants' and Auditors' Board (PAAB).\n\nIn 1966 The National Council of Chartered Accountants came into being with its own small secretariat – a further step in the process for unification which was finally achieved in 1980 when the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants was formed with 9012 members.\n1973 saw the enactment of a new Companies Act and with it the requirement of companies to present financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting practice. The profession, together with chambers of commerce and the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, formed the Accounting Practices Board to issue statements of Generally Accepted Accounting Practice.\n\nWith the beginnings of globalization, the profession internationally felt the need to work more closely together. This led to the creation of IFAC in 1977 and South Africa was one of the founder members. Although the first woman CA(SA), Miss Elizabeth Kruger, qualified in 1917, it was not until 1977 that Wiseman Nkuhlu was admitted as the first black African CA(SA).\n\nThe 1980s proved to be an era of change. While SAICA established numerous committees to improve its service to members and to set standards, the profession recognised the need to open the doors to more black and female CAs(SA). A committee, under the chairmanship of Brian Hawksworth, began to promote this initiative. In 1987 the CAs' Eden Trust came into being as a joint effort between SAICA, the PAAB and the Association for the Advancement of Black Accountants (ABASA) to provide bursaries and grow the number of black CAs(SA). The Eden Trust assisted over 100 black accountants to qualify. In 2002 its name was changed to the Thuthuka Bursary Fund and it was fully incorporated into the institute's transformation and growth strategy.\n\nIn 1999 SAICA took over the role of setting the Part 1 of the Qualifying Examination (QE I) from the PAAB (the predecessor of the IRBA), while the PAAB took over the responsibility for setting auditing standards, and with this came more clearly defined roles for both bodies.\n\nThe profession began a long process to revise the PAA Act in the early 1990s and this process will came to fruition in 2005 when the Auditing Profession Act (Act 26 of 2005) was promulgated (the Act commenced on 1 April 2006). The process has been upset by a spate of international and local corporate failures, with the result that governments worldwide saw the need for regulation of auditors to be tightened up and became more involved in the process.\nAnother issue that still requires the profession and SAICA's contribution is that of Transformation. The Thuthuka project, an initiative by SAICA to promote skills development and transformation in the CA profession, was launched in the Eastern Cape in 2002 and it was expanded to Limpopo and Kwazulu-Natal in 2004. This programme is providing education support to African learners and students, and seeks to uplift communities while benefiting the CA profession. To regulate SAICA’s efforts going forward, the Institute has now implemented a system whereby leadership issues are identified by the SAICA Board and delegated to the secretariat, so that each day SAICA adds a little more to its history.\nConfusion often arises regarding the differing roles and responsibilities of SAICA and the IRBA [previously the Public Accountants and Auditors Board (PAAB)]. It is important to understand the roles of the two bodies.\n\nSAICA is a non-profit, voluntary body that provides a wide range of services to its members and associates. It is controlled by a Board, elected by members through regional committees, and by bodies representing the Institute's other key constituencies such as members in business (commerce and industry), large practices, small practices and ABASA. The IRBA is the statutory body controlling that part of the accountancy profession involved with public accountancy in the Republic of South Africa.\n\nIt is important to stress that all entrants to the accountancy profession are subject to consistent requirements. Following qualification, chartered accountants entering public practice are required to register with the IRBA, whilst keeping their SAICA membership, and are governed by its regulations. Those qualified chartered accountants practicing outside of public practice are not subject to the jurisdiction of the IRBA, but are subject to the jurisdiction of SAICA. The IRBA functions in terms of the Auditing Profession Act, 2005 (Act 26 of 2005). Its members are appointed by the Minister of Finance and not more than 40% of the members of the IRBA Board may be registered auditors.\n\nThe IRBA is partly funded by fees and levies payable by registered auditors and partly by the National Treasury. The IRBA reports annually to the Minister of Finance, who then tables the report in Parliament.\n\nThe mission of the IRBA, on the other hand, is to protect the financial interest of the South African public and international investors in South Africa, through the effective regulation of audits conducted by registered auditors and accountants, and in accordance with internationally recognised standards and processes. This is achieved by providing the means and the regulatory framework for the education and training of adequate numbers of competent and disciplined accountants and auditors, to serve the needs of South Africa. The Board strives constantly towards the maintenance and improvement of standards of registered auditors. It protects the public who rely on the services of registered auditors and supports registered auditors who carry out their duties competently, fearlessly and in good faith.\n\nIn order to ensure that all members, associates and trainees comply with the high professional standards set, SAICA provides technical support, continuing professional development (lifelong learning), disseminates and communicates the latest information on technical developments and business trends to its constituencies.\n\nOne of SAICA's major objectives is to ensure that membership of the accountancy profession better reflects the population demographics of South Africa. To this end, the Institute has a number of initiatives in place designed to increase the number of CAs(SA) from previously disadvantaged communities.\n\nThe responsibility for training prospective CAs(SA) is a shared one. SAICA is responsible for the registration of trainees and management of their training contracts, either in public practice or outside public practice. Trainees who do not wish to follow the public practice route may specialise in financial management. The Institute sets and adjudicates the Part I (QE 1) and the Part II in financial management examination (QE 2), for those trainees who have opted to take the financial management route. The IRBA exercises a monitoring role over the SAICA public practice training and QE I examination processes.\n\nThe IRBA is also responsible for setting and marking the Public Practice Examination (PPE) for those trainees choosing the public practice route. Trainees may only write QE 2 or PPE after they have passed QE 1 and upon the completion of a minimum of 18 months of a three-year training contract. After completing their training contract and passing both QE 1 and QE 2 or PPE, candidates are required to register with SAICA in order to use the Chartered Accountant [CA(SA)] designation.\n\nThe IRBA conducts practice reviews, investigations and disciplinary processes for registered auditors and accountants. Generally, an individual registered with the IRBA is also a CA(SA) registered with SAICA and therefore must comply with the Codes of Professional Conduct of both bodies. According to the Constitution and By-laws of SAICA, any alleged misconduct by a person who is a member of both bodies is dealt with by the IRBA, in the first instance. SAICA accepts the findings of the IRBA disciplinary process and imposes its own disciplinary sentences on those found guilty. Disciplinary matters relating to members not registered with the IRBA, and associates, are dealt with by the SAICA ethics and disciplinary process.\n\nMembers of SAICA are entitled to use CA(SA) designation after their names. The designation is associated with someone who has considerable expertise in the theory and practice of accountancy. The requirements for qualification as a Chartered Accountant are:\n\n\nAn AGA (SA) is a highly skilled accountant who has completed both a SAICA-accredited BCom degree and SAICA accredited training programme.\nAGAs operate in a broad range of varied work activities, most of which are complex and non-routine.\n\nCore areas include:\n\nThe AAT qualification is offered through the Association of Accounting Technicians. The range of an AAT's work will vary widely. Generally AATs work in support positions and some of their key functions include:\nAAT trainees are required to complete a training contract of at least two years and must pass an examination before they are entitled to use the AAT (SA) designation. See .\n\nA South African Chartered Accountant, or CA(SA), is the equivalent of a United States CPA (Certified Public Accountant). However, the CPA designation also exists in South Africa. This qualification was previously designated CFA (Certified Financial Accountant). South African CPAs perform only accounting and tax work, usually for smaller entities, and may not perform auditing work.\n\nA recent legal battle between SAICA and the CPA governing body: SAICA requested that the CPA designation be changed back to CFA (Certified Financial Accountant) because the \"CPA\" designation might create confusion to Americans who might believe that CPAs can act as auditors. Using the term CPA is also a contravention of the Audit Profession Act which states that only CAs may use the term \"Public Accountant\" or \"Registered Auditor\".\n\nThe eventual outcome of this dispute was that the CPA governing body changed its name to SAIPA, the South African Institute of Professional Accountants, and its members designation changed to Professional Accountant (SA) without a corresponding acronym.\n\nThe requirements to earn the designation are:\n\n"}
{"id": "2205325", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2205325", "title": "Zinc–carbon battery", "text": "Zinc–carbon battery\n\nA zinc–carbon battery is a dry cell primary battery that delivers about 1.5 volts of direct current from the electrochemical reaction between zinc and manganese dioxide. A carbon rod collects the current from the manganese dioxide electrode, giving the name to the cell. A dry cell is usually made from zinc, which serves as the anode with a negative electrical polarity, while the inert carbon rod is the positive electrical pole cathode. General-purpose batteries may use an aqueous paste of ammonium chloride as electrolyte, possibly mixed with some zinc chloride solution. \"Heavy-duty\" types use a paste primarily composed of zinc chloride.\n\nZinc–carbon batteries were the first commercial dry batteries, developed from the technology of the wet Leclanché cell. They made flashlights and other portable devices possible, because the battery can function in any orientation. They are still useful in low drain or intermittent use devices such as remote controls, flashlights, clocks or transistor radios. Zinc–carbon dry cells are single-use primary cells.\n\nBy 1876, the wet Leclanché cell was made with a compressed block of manganese dioxide. In 1886, Carl Gassner patented a \"dry\" version by using a zinc cup as the anode and a paste of plaster of Paris (and later, wheat flour) to jellify the electrolyte and to immobilize it.\n\nIn 1898, Conrad Hubert used consumer batteries manufactured by W. H. Lawrence to power what was the first flashlight, and subsequently the two formed the Eveready Battery Company. In 1900, Gassner demonstrated dry cells for portable lighting at the World's Fair in Paris. Continual improvements were made to the stability and capacity of zinc–carbon cells throughout the 20th century; by the end of the century the capacities had increased fourfold over the 1910 equivalent. Improvements include the use of purer grades of manganese dioxide, better sealing, and purer zinc for the negative electrode. Zinc-chloride cells (usually marketed as \"heavy duty\" batteries) use a paste primarily composed of zinc chloride, which gives a longer life and steadier voltage output compared with ammonium chloride electrolyte. \n\nSide reactions due to impurities in the zinc anode increase self-discharge and corrosion of the cell. Formerly, the zinc was coated with mercury to form an amalgam, protecting it. Since this is an environmental hazard, current production batteries no longer use mercury. Manufacturers must now use more highly purified zinc to prevent local action and self-discharge.\n\nAs of 2011, zinc–carbon batteries accounted for 20% of all portable batteries in the UK and 18% in the EU. In Japan they account for 6% of primary battery sales.\n\nThe container of the zinc–carbon dry cell is a zinc can. The can contains a layer of NHCl or ZnCl aqueous paste impregnating a paper layer that separates the zinc can from a mixture of powdered carbon (usually graphite powder) and manganese (IV) oxide (MnO), which is packed around a carbon rod. Carbon is the only practical conductor material because every common metal quickly corrodes in the positive electrode in salt-based electrolyte.\n\nEarly types, and low-cost cells, use a separator consisting of a layer of starch or flour. A layer of starch-coated paper is used in modern cells, which is thinner and allows more manganese dioxide to be used. Originally cells were sealed with a layer of asphalt to prevent drying out of the electrolyte; more recently a thermoplastic washer sealant is used. The carbon rod is slightly porous, which allows accumulated hydrogen gas to escape, while retaining the aqueous electrolyte. The ratio of manganese dioxide and carbon powder in the cathode paste affects the characteristics of the cell: more carbon powder lowers internal resistance, while more manganese dioxide improves storage capacity.\n\nFlat cells are made for assembly into batteries with higher voltages, up to about 450 volts. Flat cells are stacked and the whole assembly is coated in wax to prevent electrolyte evaporation.\n\nIn a zinc–carbon dry cell, the outer zinc container is the negatively charged terminal. The zinc is oxidised by the charge carrier, chloride (Cl) via the following half reactions:\n\nAnode (oxidation reaction, marked −)\n\nCathode (reduction reaction, marked +)\n\nOther side reactions are possible, but the overall reaction in a zinc–carbon cell can be represented as\n\nIf zinc chloride is substituted for ammonium chloride as the electrolyte, the anode reaction remains the same:\n\nand the cathode reaction produces zinc hydroxide instead of ammonium hydroxide:\n\ngiving the overall reaction\n\nThe battery has an electromotive force (e.m.f.) of about 1.5 V. The approximate nature of the e.m.f is related to the complexity of the cathode reaction. The anode (zinc) reaction is comparatively simple with a known potential. Side reactions and depletion of the active chemicals increases the internal resistance of the battery, which causes the terminal voltage to drop under load.\n\nThe zinc-chloride cell, frequently referred to as a \"heavy-duty\", \"extra-heavy-duty\", or even \"super-heavy-duty\" battery, is an improvement on the original zinc–carbon cell, using purer chemicals and giving a longer service life and steadier voltage output as it is used and offering about twice the service life of general-purpose zinc–carbon cells, or up to four times in continuous-use or high-drain applications. This is still a fraction of the output of an alkaline cell, however.\n\nAlkaline batteries offer up to eight times the battery life of zinc–carbon batteries, especially in continuous-use or high-drain applications.\n\nManufacturers recommend storage of zinc–carbon batteries at room temperature; storage at higher temperatures reduces the expected service life. Zinc–carbon batteries may be frozen without damage; manufacturers recommend that they be returned to normal room temperature before use, and that condensation on the battery jacket must be avoided. By the end of the 20th century, the storage life of zinc–carbon cells had improved fourfold over expected life in 1910.\n\nZinc–carbon cells have a short shelf life, as the zinc is attacked by ammonium chloride. The zinc container becomes thinner as the cell is used, because zinc metal is oxidized to zinc ions. When the zinc case thins enough, zinc chloride begins to leak out of the battery. The old dry cell is not leak-proof and becomes very sticky as the paste leaks through the holes in the zinc case. The zinc casing in the dry cell gets thinner even when the cell is not being used, because the ammonium chloride inside the battery reacts with the zinc. An \"inside-out\" form with a carbon cup and zinc vanes on the interior, while more leak-resistant, has not been made since the 1960s.\nThis picture shows the zinc container of fresh batteries at (a), and discharged batteries at (b) and (c). The battery shown at (c) had a polyethylene protection film (mostly removed in the photo) to keep the zinc oxide inside the casing.\n\nThousands of tons of zinc–carbon batteries are discarded every year around the world and are often not recycled.\n\nDisposal varies by jurisdiction. For example, in the U.S, the state of California considers all batteries as hazardous waste when discarded, and has banned the disposal of batteries with other domestic waste. In Europe, battery disposal is controlled by the WEEE Directive and Battery Directive regulations, and as such zinc–carbon batteries must not be thrown out with domestic waste. In the EU, most stores that sell batteries are required by law to accept old batteries for recycling.\n\n\n"}

The islands are important as a breeding site for seabirds, and they attract divers, who come to visit the numerous shipwrecks. The Skerries Lighthouse sits atop the highest point in the islands.\n\nThe islands can be visited by charter boat from Holyhead. The individual islets are accessible from one another at low tide and by small bridges.\n\nThe name \"Skerry\" is the Scottish diminutive of the Old Norse \"sker\", and means a small rocky reef or island. The Welsh name for these islands, 'Ynysoedd y Moelrhoniaid', means \"Islands of the Seals\". An alternative name provided by some English-language sources is 'St Daniel's Isle'.\n\nThe islands have a seabird colony, which is particularly important for the Arctic tern, numbers of which are nationally important; the roseate tern breeds occasionally in very small numbers. In 2018 two roseate tern chicks fledged here for the first time in a decade. The following species also breed: Atlantic puffin, black-legged kittiwake, common tern, herring gull and lesser black-backed gull.\n\nBecause of these birds, in particular the terns, the island has been designated as part of the Ynys Feurig, Cemlyn Bay and The Skerries Special Protection Area along with two other nearby sites, Cemlyn Bay and Ynys Feurig, and all three are also classed by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area. The Skerries have also been designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest.\n\nTerns interchange regularly between all three sites, and form part of a larger Irish Sea tern population together with birds at sites in Ireland such as Rockabill Island. The islands are wardened by the RSPB during the tern breeding season, and management measures they have undertaken here include control of introduced tree mallow (\"Lavatera arborea\") and provision of nestboxes; these measures as aimed particularly at helping to increase the attractiveness of the site to breeding roseate terns, although it is accepted that the future number of pairs of this species here is primarily dependent on the overall health of the Irish Sea population.\n\nThe site came to national attention among birders briefly in July 2005 when it attracted a sooty tern, a species which only a very small number of birders had previously seen in Britain.\n\nThe area between the islands and mainland Anglesey is the site of the planned Skerries Tidal Stream Array, being developed by Marine Current Turbines and RWE npower.\n\n"}

Over the course of his life, Kalecki worked at the London School of Economics, University of Cambridge, University of Oxford and Warsaw School of Economics and was an economic advisor to the governments of Poland, France, Cuba, Israel, Mexico and India. He also served as the deputy director of the United Nations Economic Department in New York City.\n\nKalecki has been called \"one of the most distinguished economists of the 20th century\" and \"likely the most original one\". It is often claimed that he developed many of the same ideas as John Maynard Keynes before Keynes, but he remains much less known to the English-speaking world. He offered a synthesis that integrated Marxist class analysis and the new literature on oligopoly theory, and his work had a significant influence on both the neo-Marxian (\"Monopoly Capital\") and post-Keynesian schools of economic thought. He was one of the first macroeconomists to apply mathematical models and statistical data to economic questions. Being also a political economist and a person of leftist convictions, Kalecki emphasized the social aspects and consequences of economic policies.\n\nKalecki made major theoretical and practical contributions in the areas of the business cycle, growth, full employment, income distribution, the political boom cycle, the oligopolistic economy, and risk. Among his other significant interests were monetary issues, economic development, finance, interest, and inflation. In 1970 Kalecki was nominated for the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics, but he died the same year.\n\nMichał Kalecki was born on 22 June 1899 in Łódź, Congress Poland, then a part of the Russian Empire. Information about his early years is very sparse, part of it being lost during the Nazi occupation, but he grew up in a major labor-turbulent industrial center, which affected his future views. In 1917 Kalecki enrolled at Warsaw Polytechnic to study civil engineering. He was a very able student and he formalized a generalization of Pascal's theorem, concerning a hexagon drawn within a second-degree curve. Kalecki generalized this for a polygon of 2n sides.\n\nBecause his father lost a small textile workshop, Kalecki had to obtain a job as an accountant; during his first year in Warsaw he continued working sporadic jobs. After finishing his first year of engineering, he had to interrupt his studies from 1918 to 1921 to complete military service. Upon leaving the military he joined Gdańsk Polytechnic, where he stayed until 1923, but because of the family financial situation had to leave the institution just before graduating.\n\nDuring these years he first approached economics, although informally. He read mostly \"unorthodox\" works, particularly those of Mikhail Tugan-Baranovsky and Rosa Luxemburg. Years later they influenced some of his writings related to the potential growth of a capitalist system.\n\nHaving to enter the job market full-time, Kalecki abandoned his formal studies for good. His first job was to collect data on companies seeking credit. In this same period he tried unsuccessfully to start a newspaper, but instead ended up writing articles for two existing periodicals, \"Polska gospodarcza\" ('Economic Poland') and \"Przegląd gospodarczy\" ('The Economic Review'). Probably when writing these articles he began to acquire skills in obtaining and analyzing empirical information, which he later used in his professional works.\n\nIn 1929 Kalecki applied for work at the Institute of Research on Business Cycles and Prices (\"Instytut Badania Koniunktur Gospodarczych i Cen\") in Warsaw and obtained a job there because of his ability to use statistics. He stayed there for seven years. On 18 June 1930 he married Ada Szternfeld. At the Institute he met Ludwik Landau, whose knowledge of statistics influenced Kalecki's work. His first publications were of a practical character and were concerned with establishing relationships between macro-magnitudes. The first article that anticipated many subsequent contributions was published in 1932 in \"Przegląd socjalistyczny\" ('The Socialist Review') magazine, under the pseudonym Henryk Braun. The article dealt with the impact of wage cuts during an economic downturn.\n\nIn 1933 Kalecki wrote \"Próba teorii koniunktury\" ('An Attempt at the Theory of the Business Cycle'), an essay that brought together many of the issues that dominated his thought for the rest of his life. In the essay Kalecki for the first time developed a comprehensive theory of business cycles. The foundations of his macroeconomic theory of effective demand presented in the paper anticipated similar ideas published three years later by John Maynard Keynes in \"The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money\". According to Lawrence Klein (1951), Kalecki \"created a system that contains everything of importance in the Keynesian system, in addition to other contributions\". In an introduction to the essay's 1966 English translation, Joan Robinson wrote: \"Its sharp and concentrated statement provides a better introduction to the general theory of employment, interest and money than any that has yet been produced.\"\n\nExcept for a small number of economists (in particular econometrists) familiar with his work, Kalecki's contributions, originally in Polish, failed to gain recognition. In October 1933 he read his essay to the International Econometrics Association in Leiden and in 1935 published it in two major journals: \"Revue d'Economie Politique\" and \"Econometrica\". Readers of neither journal were particularly impressed, but the article received favourable comments from such leading economists as Ragnar Frisch and Jan Tinbergen.\n\nIn 1936 Kalecki protested the politically motivated actions taken by the Institute of Research against his colleagues, including Landau. Kalecki resigned, and having been granted a Rockefeller Foundation's Traveling Fellowship, proceeded to work abroad. Had he not received the fellowship, the war would have caught Kalecki in Poland.\n\nThe scholarship enabled Kalecki to travel with his wife to Sweden, where followers of Knut Wicksell were trying to formalize a theory similar to Kalecki's. In Sweden in 1936 he learnt of the publication of Keynes's \"General Theory\". Kalecki was working on a comprehensive elaboration of the economic ideas he had previously developed, but having found in Keynes's book much of what he was going to say, he interrupted his work and traveled to England. He first visited the London School of Economics and afterward went to Cambridge. Thus began his friendships with Richard Kahn, Joan Robinson and Piero Sraffa, which left an indelible mark on all of them. In 1937 Kalecki met Keynes. The meeting was cool and Keynes kept aloof. Although the conclusions they had reached in their work were very similar, their characters could not have been more different. Kalecki graciously neglected to mention that he had a priority of publication. As Joan Robinson stated:\nLater Kalecki always acknowledged that the \"Keynesian Revolution\" was an appropriate name for the movement in economics, as he realized the importance of Keynes's established position, the recognition Keynes enjoyed and his decisive role in the promotion and causing eventual acceptance of the ideas that Kalecki pioneered.\n\nIn 1939 Kalecki wrote one of his most important works, \"Essays in the Theory of Economic Fluctuations\". Although his conception changed through the years, all the essential elements of Kaleckian economics were already present in this work: in a sense his subsequent publications would consist of mere elaborations on the ideas propounded here.\n\nWhile Kalecki was generally enthusiastic about the Keynesian Revolution, in his article \"Political Aspects of Full Employment\", which Anatole Kaletsky called one of the most prescient economic papers ever published, he predicted it would not endure. Kalecki believed that the full employment delivered by Keynesian policy would eventually lead to a more assertive working class and weakening of the social position of business leaders, causing the elite to react to the erosion of their political power and force a displacement of that policy, in spite of profits being higher than under a \"laissez-faire\" system.\n\nKalecki was hired by the Oxford Institute of Statistics (OIS) early in 1940. His job there consisted mainly of writing statistical and economic analysis for the British government of the management of war economy. Occasionally he gave lectures at Oxford University. The elaborate reports Kalecki prepared for the government were chiefly about the rationing of goods, and the scheme he developed was very close to the policies adopted later when rationing was introduced. According to George Feiwel, \"Kalecki's work of the war period is far less known than it deserves to be\".\n\nSeveral of Kalecki's wartime articles were devoted to the subject of inflation. He argued, on economic grounds, against the government's efforts to suppress inflation by official regulation of prices and by government wage stabilization (freezing of wages), recommending in each case economic rationing instead (especially the full rationing system rather than the wage stabilization program).\n\nSome of Kalecki's major works were written during this period. In 1943 he produced two articles, one dealing with new additions to the traditional business cycle theory, and one presenting his completely original theory of business cycles caused by political events. The latter was published in 1944 and was based on the premise of full employment. It was a compilation of studies by Kalecki and his colleagues at the OIS, who were strongly influenced by Kalecki'.\n\nIn 1945 Kalecki left the OIS because he felt his talents were insufficiently appreciated. He displayed great modesty about his work and did not expect a high salary, but was offended at being discriminated against on account of his immigrant status. One reason he was not appointed to a more senior position was that he had not applied to become a British subject.\n\nKalecki went to París for a while, then moved to Montreal, where he stayed for fifteen months working at the International Labour Office. In July 1946 he accepted the Polish government's invitation to head the Central Planning Office of the Ministry of Economics, but he left some months later. By the end of 1946, he assumed the job of Deputy Director in the Department of Economic Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat in New York. He remained there until 1955, mainly preparing the World Economic Reports. Kalecki resigned that position as a result of McCarthyist pressures. It was argued that he was punished on political grounds (a non-merited economic planner stance was attributed to him). He became depressed by Senator Joseph McCarthy's witch-hunt, as many of his close friends were directly affected. Denounced in the US Senate as a supporter of communism, Kalecki ultimately failed to achieve professional success in the US (although he influenced the future post-Keynesians there), unlike in England, where he had a large following and was supported especially by his friend Joan Robinson.\n\nIn 1955 Kalecki returned to Poland, never to work abroad for any extended period again. Hopeful for an opportunity to participate there in reforms that were socially advantageous, he believed that socialism would avoid the miseries brought by capitalist policies. He became economic advisor to the Office of the Council of Ministers. In 1957, he was appointed chairman of the Central Commission for Perspective Planning. The perspective plan had a time horizon of 1961 to 1975 and basically meant a practical implementation of Kalecki's theories of growth in socialist economies. However, the final plan developed by Kalecki was dismissed by board members as defeatist. Then things got worse, as related by Feiwel:\nStill holding some of his government appointments, Kalecki spent much of the rest of his professional life in teaching and research, as a university professor from 1956 (Central School of Planning and Statistics and the University of Warsaw) and member of the Polish Academy of Sciences from 1957. In 1959, he began directing a seminar on socioeconomic problems of the Third World, along with Oskar R. Lange and Czesław Bobrowski. He was instrumental in the establishment and functioning of the Department of Economic Problems in Developing Countries, operated jointly by Warsaw University and the School of Planning and Statistics.\n\nWhen the 1968 Polish political crisis unfolded, Kalecki retired in protest against the wave of antisemitic dismissals and firings that affected many of his colleagues.\n\nHe also devoted this period to the study of mathematics. In part this was a continuation of the interest he had when he was young and generalized Pascal's theorem. His investigations now centered on number theory and probability. Kalecki's engagement in mathematics helped him to relieve the extreme disappointment caused by the lack of power to help his country in economic policy.\n\nKalecki kept writing research articles. During his last visit to Cambridge in 1969, his seventieth birthday was celebrated. Kalecki gave a University Lecture on the theories of growth under various social systems, after which he was greatly applauded for the soundness of his arguments as well as for the overall trajectory of his life.\n\nKeynes had said that knowledge of the laws governing capitalist economy would make people more prosperous, happy and more responsible regarding economic decisions taken. Kalecki contested this view, arguing that the idea of political business cycle (governments can force situations to their advantage) seems to point in the opposite direction. As he grew older, Kalecki was ever more convinced of this, and his view of humanity was getting increasingly pessimistic.\n\nMichał Kalecki died on 18 April 1970 at the age of 70, and although he was bitterly disappointed with political developments, he lived long enough to see the recognition of the value of his many original contributions to economics. Feiwel wrote the following summary of Kalecki's life:\n\nDespite the fact that Kalecki authored many theoretical economic constructs, his interest in economics was more practical than academic and resulted from his work in engineering, journalism, credit investigation, use of statistics and observation of business operations. Full-time university teaching, for which he did not have formal qualifications (a degree), he did only during the last thirteen years of his career. He was contemptuous of abstract research and declined Keynes's invitation to undertake a critique of Jan Tinbergen's econometric business cycle work, for which he would also lack an in-depth knowledge of statistical theory.\n\nKalecki stressed that the predominant economic growth models were built on the assumption of an idealized \"laissez-faire\" capitalism and did not properly take into account the crucial and empirically demonstrable role of the government sector, the state's intervention and the interaction between the state and private sectors.\n\nIn 1943 Kalecki wrote: '... \"discipline in the factories\" and \"political stability\" are more appreciated by the business leaders than are profits. Their class instinct tells them that lasting full employment is unsound from their point of view and that unemployment is an integral part of the normal capitalist system.' The capitalists therefore want to limit government intervention and spending as disruptions to \"laissez-faire\" that reduce their \"state of confidence\" in the overall economic performance, with the notable exception of armament spending and policies that lead to increased armament spending (the last point Kalecki emphasized again in 1967).\n\nThe economics of Kalecki was based, more explicitly and systematically than that of Keynes, on the principle of the circular flow of income that goes back to the Physiocrat François Quesnay. According to that principle, income is determined by expenditure decisions, not by the exchange of resources (capital or labor). Kalecki and Keynes claimed that in capitalist economy, production and employment levels (economic equilibrium) are determined foremost by the magnitude of investment by business enterprises (the crucial \"driver of the business cycle\"), not by price and wage flexibility. Savings are determined by investments, not the other way around. Contrary to the Ricardian, Marxian and Neoclassical economics, Kalecki asserted that higher wages lead to fuller employment. His monetary theory was rooted in the business cycle theory of Knut Wicksell. Quesnay's circular flow of income fell into disrepute in the political economy of the 19th century, when the idea that prices integrate exchange decisions gained ground, but was revived by Joseph Schumpeter, who pointed out the necessity of considering the circular flow of income (recognition of the economic cycle) as an integrating factor in order to gain a comprehensive understanding of the total economic process in a given period. The principle was discarded again with the arrival of neoliberal domination in economics and its main current defined by prices of economic equilibrium. Economist Jan Toporowski said that Kalecki's theory of the business cycle remains \"the most serious challenge to general equilibrium macroeconomics\", which has prevailed since the late 19th century. More than Keynes, Kalecki was skeptical about government's ability to sustain fiscal and monetary stimulus policies or of business support for full employment.\n\nLike Keynes, Kalecki was concerned with demand management. Kalecki distinguished three ways of stimulating demand: through the government improving conditions for private investment (a time-consuming and burdensome for the populace process of which he was skeptical), through redistribution of income from profits to wages, and through public investment that increases employment and demand automatically.\n\nKalecki was engaged in the problems of developing countries. He argued that their industrialization depended on land reform and taxation of land owners and the middle classes. He was skeptical about a positive role of foreign direct investment in stimulating economic modernization. Polish economist Oskar Lange, who worked with Kalecki also on centrally planned socialist economies of the Soviet Bloc, characterized him as a \"leftist Keynesian\".\n\nAccording to Toporowski, Kalecki's monetary theory is of particular significance. Unlike Keynes, Kalecki regarded credit as a fundamental system of financial reckoning in capitalist economy, not just as clearing of payments between commercial banks and a central bank. He saw monetary policy as endogenous to the business cycle, dependent on business investment rather than on interest rate and credit policy of central bankers. Unlike Keynes, who followed the partial equilibrium approach, for Kalecki economic dynamics was synonymous with the business cycle, where \"the circular flow of income generates cumulative changes from one period to the next\". Kalecki and Lange stressed the necessity of analysis of actually-functioning capitalism in both the advanced and developing countries, before economic theories could be built or courses of action prescribed. Kalecki's studies of capitalist enterprises included their finances, investment patterns and factors that influence investment, such as the development of financial markets, microeconomic conditions, and governmental fiscal interventions.\n\nThe volume of economic literature written by Kalecki during his life was very large. Although in most of his articles he returned to the same subjects (business cycles, determinants of investment, socialist planning), he often did it from a slightly unusual perspective and with original contributions.\n\nKalecki's most famous contribution is his profit equation. Kalecki, whose early influences came from Marxian economists, thought that the volume of profits and their sharing in a capitalist society were vital points to be treated. This followed from Karl Marx's work on relationships such as the rate of surplus value or the organic composition of capital (and even a forecast about the overall trend of profits). However, Marx was not able to make a meaningful statement about the total volume of profits in a given period.\n\nKalecki derived this relationship in an extremely concise, elegant and intuitive way. He starts by making simplifications which he later progressively eliminates. These assumptions are:\n\nWith these assumptions Kalecki derives the following accounting identity:\n\nwhere formula_1 is the volume of gross profits (profits plus depreciation), formula_2 is the volume of total wages, formula_3 is capitalists' consumption, formula_4 is workers' consumption and formula_5 is the gross investment that has been made in the economy. Since we have supposed workers who do not save (that is formula_6 in the preceding equation), we can simplify the two terms and arrive at:\n\nThis is the famous profits equation, which says that profits are equal to the sum of investment and capitalists' consumption.\n\nAt this point, Kalecki goes on to determine the causal link between the two sides of the equation: does capitalists' consumption and investment determine profits or profits instead determine capitalists' consumption and investment? Kalecki says,\n\nFor someone who has not seen the preceding relationship before, it might, upon examination, seem somewhat paradoxical. If the capitalists consume more, obviously the amount of funds which they have at the end of the year should be less. However, this reasoning, obvious to the individual entrepreneur, is not true for the business class as a whole, as the consumption of one capitalist becomes part of the profits of another. In a way, \"they are masters of their fate\".\n\nIf in the preceding equation we move capitalists' consumption to the left, the equation becomes:\n\nsince profits minus capitalists' consumption are the total saving (formula_7) in the economy, because the workers do not save. The previous causal relationship still applies, and goes from investment to saving. That is to say, total savings are determined once investment has been determined. Therefore, in some way, investment generates sufficient resources. \"Investment finances itself\", so that equality between savings and investment is not caused by any interest rate mechanism as earlier economists thought.\nFinally, we can eliminate the assumptions of the original equation: the economy can be open, there may be a government sector and we can let workers save something. The resulting equation is:\n\nIn this model total profits (net taxes this time) are the sum of capitalists' consumption, investment, public deficit, net external surplus (exports minus imports) minus workers' savings.\nBefore trying to explain income distribution, Kalecki introduces some behavioural assumptions in his simplified equation of profits. For him, investment is determined by a combination of many factors difficult to explain, which are considered given, exogenous. Regarding capitalists' consumption, he considers that a simplified form is the following equation:\n\nThat is, capitalists' consumption depends on a fixed part (independent part), the term formula_8, and a proportional share of profits, the term formula_9, which is called the marginal propensity to consume of the capitalists. If this consumption function is substituted into the profit equation, we have:\n\nExpressed in terms of formula_10, this gives:\n\nThe advantage of the above manipulation is that we have reduced the two earnings determinants (capitalists' consumption and investment) to only one (investment).\n\nIncome distribution is the other pillar of Kalecki's efforts to build a business cycle theory. To do this, Kalecki assumes that industries compete in imperfectly competitive markets, more particularly in oligopolistic markets where firms set a mark-up on their variable average costs (raw materials, wages of employees on the shop floor that are supposed to be variable) in order to cover their overhead costs (salaries to senior management and administration), to obtain a certain amount of profit. The mark-up fixed by firms is higher or lower depending on the degree of monopoly, or the ease with which firms can raise price without causing reduction in the quantity demanded.\nThis can be summarized in the following equation:\n\nwhere formula_11 and formula_12 are profits and wages, formula_13 is the average mark-up for the whole economy, formula_14 is the cost of raw materials and formula_15 is the total amount of salaries (which must be distinguished from wages, represented by variables, while salaries are considered fixed). The equation allows us to derive the wage share in the national income. If we add to both members formula_12, and pass one to the other side, we have:\n\nIf we multiply each side by formula_12, and pass to the other term, we have:\n\nor:\n\nwhere formula_18 is the wage share in the national income and formula_19 is the relation between the cost of raw materials and wages. It follows that the wage share in the national income depends negatively on mark-up and on the relationship of raw material costs to wages.\nAt this point Kalecki's interest is in finding out what happens to the wage share during the business cycle. During recessions, firms collaborate among themselves to cope with the fall of profits, so the degree of monopoly increases and this increases the mark-up. The formula_20 parameter goes up. Nonetheless, the lack of demand during recessions causes a fall in the price of raw materials, so the formula_19 parameter goes down. The argument is symmetrical during the boom: prices of raw materials rise (formula_19 parameter increases) while the strength of unions due to increased employment level causes the degree of monopoly and thereby the mark-up level, to fall. The conclusion is that the α parameter is roughly constant over the business cycle.\n\nFinally, we need an equation that determines the total product of an economy:\n\nwhich is to say that the share of profits and salaries are the complement of the share of wages. Solving for formula_23 gives:\n\nNow we have the three components necessary to determine total product: an equation of profits, a theory of income distribution and an equation that links the product with profits and income distribution. It remains only to substitute the expression for formula_1 which we obtained before:\n\nThe preceding equation shows the determination of income in a closed system without public sector. It shows that output is completely determined by investment. How will output change from one period to the next? Insofar as we have assumed that formula_25 and formula_26 are constants, the above formula comes down to the multiplier:\n\nThe problem of the change in output and hence the business cycle is therefore due to changes in the volume of investment. It follows that it is in investment where we must find the reasons for the fluctuations of a capitalist economy.\n\nThe above argument demonstrates the crucial role played by investment in a capitalist system. Finding a well-specified investment function would facilitate resolution of many problems in the capitalist economy. This subject had been treated for an extended period by Kalecki, and he was never completely satisfied with his solutions. This is because the factors that determine investment decisions are multiple and not always clear.\nWhat follows is the solution Kalecki gave in one of his books.\n\nKalecki's investment function in the study of business cycles is the following:\n\nwhere formula_27 is the amount of investment decisions in fixed capital, formula_28, formula_29 and formula_30 are parameters that specify a linear relation, formula_31 is a constant which can vary in the long-run, formula_1 are profits, formula_7 is the gross saving generated by the firm, and formula_34 is the stock of fixed capital. The equation shows that investment decisions depend positively on savings generated by the firm, the rate of change of profits, a constant which is subject to long-term changes, and negatively on the increase of fixed capital.\n\nThe above equation is able to generate cycles by itself. During booms, firms are able to generate more cash flow and enjoy increases in profits. However, the increase in orders for capital investment increases the stock of capital, until it becomes unprofitable to make more investments. Ultimately, the variations in the level of investment generate the business cycles. As Kalecki would say:\n\nIn the first half of the 1990s, Oxford University Press published 7 volumes of \"Collected Works of Michal Kalecki\", referring to him as \"one of the most distinguished economists of the 20th century.\" Many of his works were translated into English for the first time in this collection.\n\nKalecki's work has inspired the Cambridge (UK) post-Keynesians, especially Joan Robinson, Nicholas Kaldor and Richard M. Goodwin, as well as the modern American post-Keynesian economists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"a.\" British economist Jan Toporowski spoke of \"the inability of capitalism to secure the rational use of resources because of the blocking political, social and financial power of the capitalist class\", a phenomenon expounded by Kalecki in carefully reasoned analysis, without resorting to the presently commonly practiced accusations of partiality, injustice or bad faith.\n\n\"b.\"According to Toporowski, the economic profession is now divided into schools of thought which identify themselves with doctrines, sets of \"a priori\" principles they do not question. Toporowski said that in the 21st century we urgently need to recover Kalecki's concepts and the rule of the circular flow of income as an integrating factor of macroeconomic analysis. Lacking these, the economists have regressed toward Victorian values that praise the supposed virtue of thrift of the wealthy. We must return to the vision of Kalecki and Oskar Lange regarding economic development of traditional societies, vision that stressed the role of such development as changing social structures, not as just augmenting the potential of individuals.\n\n\n\n"}

They both date from after the 1856 death of Robert Schumann when Brahms was residing in Detmold and had access to an orchestra.\n\nBrahms had a goal of reaching Ludwig van Beethoven's level in writing symphonies, and worked long and hard on his first symphony, completing it only in 1876 when he was 43 years old. As preliminary steps in composing for orchestra, he chose early on to write some lighter orchestral pieces, these Serenades. The second was first sent to Clara Schumann, who was delighted by it. \n\nThe first serenade was completed in 1858. At that time, Brahms was also working on his Piano Concerto No. 1. Originally scored for wind and string octet and then expanded into a longer work for chamber nonet, the serenade was later adapted for orchestra; Brahms completed the final version for large orchestra in December 1859. In the orchestration of the Concerto Brahms had solicited and got a great deal of advice from his good friend Joseph Joachim. For this Serenade Joachim also gave advice, although to a lesser extent. The first performance of the Serenade, in Hanover on 3 March 1860, \"did not go very well\" in Brahms's opinion, but evidently the unusually large audience of 1,200 did not notice any mistake during the performance. At the end, applause \"persisted until I came out and down in front.\" After every piece in the concert \"the audience was shouting.\" This was a vastly better reception than the Piano Concerto had in either of its first two performances. But at its third performance, 24 March, also in Hamburg, it had been a success, perhaps not to the same degree as the Serenade. \n\nThe Serenade consists of six movements and lasts around 45 minutes.\n\nThe second serenade was written in 1859 and dedicated to Clara Schumann. The first public performance was in Hamburg on 10 February 1860. It was revised in 1875. It is scored for a chamber orchestra, including double woodwinds but omitting violins, trumpets, trombones, and percussion. The five movements take approximately thirty minutes to perform.\n\n"}

It takes only 30 minutes to reach Pataudi and is only 27 Kilometers from Gurgaon city.\n\nPataudi was founded during the rule of Jalal-ud-din Khailji the Sultan of Delhi, (between 1290–1296) by a Mewati chieftain, Pata, who called it Patodhi.\n\nThe town was part of Pataudi State which was formed in 1804 by British East India Company by 40 villages and Pataudi town as reward to Faiz Talab Khan a Pashtun of the Barech tribe for aiding the Company against the Maratha Empire during the Second Anglo-Maratha War. Thus Faiz Talab Khan is known as Nawab of Pataudi.\n\nPataudi became the part of Dominion of India later Republic of India in 1947 when British Raj ended. Former India cricket team captain Iftikhar Ali Khan Pataudi or Nawab of Pataudi Sr. remained ruler until 1952 then was succeeded by his son Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi also former India cricket team captain until 1971 when 26th amendment to the Constitution of India, the Government of India abolished all official symbols of princely India, including titles, privileges, and remuneration. Their home Pataudi Palace is now a heritage hotel. Nearby Akbar Manzil, built after 1857 as the official residence of the then Nawab, was later converted into a kachehri (judicial complex), and is now used as a godown (store).\n\nIn 1984, a mob under the guidance of Indian National Congress' leader Lalit Maken set fire to Pataudi's Gurdwara which created a panic in the city. This came after Prime Minister of India Indira Gandhi was shot by her two Sikh bodyguards.\n\nPataudi is located at . It has an average elevation of 240 metres (787 feet).\n\n India census, Pataudi had a population of 16,064. Males constitute 53% of the population and females 47%. Pataudi has an average literacy rate of 57%, lower than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy is 65%, and female literacy is 48%. In Pataudi, 17% of the population is under 6 years of age. Their main occupation is farming. Rao Kanwar Singh Yadav ( father of Krishan Lal Yadav and Ram Avtar Yadav ) the famous freedom fighter of Quni Daultabad village is also from Pataudi.\n\nThe Backward Classes and the Scheduled Castes constitute about 70,000 of the votes. The Rajputs constitute 12,000 with about equal number of Jats.\n\nPataudi Road is now is in the vicinity of three major highways like National Highway 8 (India) and the upcoming Kundli–Manesar–Palwal Expressway and the proposed Dwarka Expressway. Manesar is just four kilometers from Pataudi Road. Several residential units coming up on the Pataudi Road, the logistics park, Special Economic Zones (SEZs) by Reliance, Raheja Engineering SEZ and a commercial sector.\n\nAdding to this are the government's plans to upgrade infrastructure facilities along the belt. As per the new Gurgaon-Manesar Master Plan 2021, the availability of land for development has opened up huge possibilities, mainly in the new sectors along Pataudi Road, slated to emerge as a growth corridor in the near future. A draft development plan for Pataudi town, too, is being prepared. It is expected to have about 4-5 sectors.\n\nPataudi Road is proposed to be widened to 135 meters. The sectors roads too would be at least 60 meters wide. Land Acquisition for creation of Residential Sectors ( Sector-1 Part-1 Pataudi )\n\nThe Gurgaon Urban Estates Department had on 31 December 2013, issued notifications under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, to acquire land for a proposed university in Sector 68, Gurgaon (660 acre), Sector-1 Part-I, Pataudi (379 acre), Sector-1, Farrukhnagar (448.75 acre) and for public utilities from Sector 68 to 74 and Sector 99 to 115 (138.93 acre) and several acres for sector roads. Around 300 landowners were sent notices under Section 4 of the law expressing the intent to take over the land by the Bhupinder Singh Hooda government under this law, just a day before the new land acquisition act came into force.\n\nThe New Bharatiya Janata Party government headed by Manohar Lal Khattar decided to go ahead with the process. The 363 acres of land are spread across four villages.\n\nSurely the farmers are opposing the acquisition process and registered the same with the Chief Minister. However, the acquisition process has the backing of Gurgaon MP and a minister in Narendra Modi government, Rao Inderjit Singh who said \"The acquisition will not be withdrawn as the process has already started. The state will develop residential sectors in this area. As far as the issue of Section 4 notices on the last day is concerned, it was legally tenable. There was nothing wrong.\"\n\nNoticeable is the fact that The previous Hooda led Congress government-initiated land acquisition under a law which was due to be replaced the very next day. Landowners got notices dated 31 December 2013 whereas the Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 came into effect on 1 January 2014.\n\nThe new law, the landowners said, will make them eligible for compensation of around Rs 2 crore per acre and 20% of the developed land. On the other hand, the British-era law granted nearly half of the compensation and no rights in developed land whatsoever. So basically, landowners are not outright against land acquisition --- they are ready to part with their land, albeit at a higher price.\n\nThe Administrator of Haryana Urban Development Authority Gurgaon P.C. Meena, however, said that the rights of the landowners and farmers will be protected even if the notifications for land acquisition were issued under the old law and they would be given compensation at the enhanced rates as per the provisions of the new law.\n\nBJP Government chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar announced a new city adjoining Gurgaon in June 2018. In this, the area from Manesar towards Rewari and the area around Pataudi will be incorporated. The new city is likely to be spread across at least 50,000 hectares, which is larger than Chandigarh (11,400 hectares) but smaller than Gurgaon (73,200 hectares). The city will come up in PPP mode. The other aspects of developing the city in a planned manner will be prepared by the consultant in the detailed master plan.” The proposed city will be well connected to neighbouring urban centres through national and state highways, the Kundli-Manesar-Palwal (KMP) Expressway and other major districts roads. The consultant is also expected to suggest the road network plan, metro rail plan, required rail and road linkages and public transportation for the proposed city and assess the proposed social, economic and physical infrastructure.\n\nNorthern Peripheral Road commonly known as Dwarka Expressway road is being developed under the public-private partnership (PPP) model. This stretch will connect Dwarka with National Highway 8 at Kherki Dhaula and will pass Pataudi Road. The NPR stretch has been planned as an alternate link road between Delhi and Gurgaon, and is expected to ease the traffic situation on the Delhi Gurgaon Expressway. The road will also provide connectivity to the much-touted Reliance-HSIIDC SEZ besides the Garhi Harsaru dry depot.\n\nMuch like Delhi, Gurgaon too will have a BRT corridor to decongest traffic on the Northern Peripheral Road. In several sections, the NPR will have provisions for the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) corridor to ensure smooth flow of traffic. The road will be fully developed in March 2012.\n\nDelhi Western Peripheral Expressway or Kundli–Manesar–Palwal (KMP) Expressway is long Expressway being constructed in the Indian state of Haryana. The KMP Expressway is the driving force behind the rise of Gurgaon-Pataudi Road.\n\nA new link road has been made by HUDA connecting Manesar with Patuadi road near Wazirpur village. The length of the road is 3.5 km.\n\nPataudi Road railway station operated by Northern Railway of Indian Railways. The station is located between Haileymandi and Jatauli village, approximately 3 km from Pataudi and that forms a part of the larger Indian railways network, where trains connect Rewari to Delhi via Gurgaon and other important cities in India like Jaipur, Ajmer, Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, Ahmadabad and Mumbai.\n\nkhandewla-Khawaspur-Jamalpur-Ghoshgarh(Kera)\nBabra Bakipur - Balewa - Bapas - Baraheri Rehnwa - Bas Padamka - Bhokhraka - Bhora Kalan - Bhora Khurd - Bhudhka - Bilaspur kalan - Brahmanwas - Brijpura - Chandla Durngarwas - Chhawan - Chhilarki - Dadawas - Darapur - Quni Daultabad - Devla Was - Dinokri - Fakarpur - Fazilwas - Gadaipur -Gawalier - Ghilnawas - Goriawas - Gudhana - Hakdarpur - Haliaki - Hausanka - Heraheri - Inchhapuri - Janaula - Jasat - Jatauli-Jauri Khurd- Khalilpur - Khanpur - Khetiawas - khor - Kukrola - Langra - Lohchab - Lokera - Lokri - Mahniawas - Malikpur - Mangwaki - Mau - Mirzapur - Mozabad - Mujaffara- Mumtazpur - Nanu Khurd - Nanukalan - Narhera - Nurgarh - Nurpur - Pahari - Parasoli - Pathredi - Rajpura - Rampur - Ransika - Rathiwas - Saiad Shah Pur - Shahpur Jat - Sherpur - Sidhrawali - Sluts - Tatarpur - Telpuri - Turkapur -Uncha Majra, Mangwaki(Noorgarh) )Darapur)\n\n"}

A weir at the western (Bryn Aber) end of the beach regulates the lagoon's water level.\n\nThe site was designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest in 1957, and is currently part of the Anglesey Heritage Coast and the Isle of Anglesey Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The Cemlyn estate is owned by the National Trust; the lagoon and its immediate surrounds comprise Cemlyn Nature Reserve (25.2 ha in extent, set up in 1971 and leased by the North Wales Wildlife Trust). The Anglesey Coastal Path passes through it.\n\nOn islands at the western end of the lagoon, there is an important tern colony, with the only breeding Sandwich terns in Wales. The numbers of breeding Sandwich terns have increased to around 1,500 pairs in recent years, making Cemlyn the third-largest colony in the United Kingdom. Arctic and common terns breed here regularly in smaller numbers but roseate tern now only occasionally. For this reason Cemlyn has been designated as part of the Ynys Feurig, Cemlyn Bay and The Skerries Special Protection Area along with two other nearby sites, Ynys Feurig and The Skerries, and all three are also classed by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area. Birds interchange regularly between all three sites, and form part of a larger Irish Sea tern population together with birds at sites in Ireland such as Rockabill Island. The tern colony is wardened from May to August.\n\nOther breeding birds found at Cemlyn include black-headed gull, ringed plover, oystercatcher and shelduck. The site is locally important for wintering wildfowl, with wigeon, shoveler and teal.\n\nCemlyn has attracted a number of vagrant birds. It is most famous among twitchers as the site where a bridled tern spent several weeks in July 1988, and where the similarly rare (in a British context) sooty tern was present on and off in July 2005. Both species had at these times been seen by only a very small number of birders in Britain. Also at Cemlyn in 2005 were an American golden plover in May and a Terek sandpiper in June. In 1998, an isabelline shrike was present for most of the month of July.\n\nThe shingle ridge supports a maritime plant community; species present here include sea kale, sea beet, sea campion, thrift and yellow horned poppy. Around the edges of the lagoon, saltmarsh plant communities are present, with species such as sea aster, sea purslane, Danish scurvygrass and saltmarsh oraches. Grey mullet are found in the lagoon.\n\n"}

{"id": "2205400", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2205400", "title": "Red lionfish", "text": "Red lionfish\n\nThe red lionfish (\"Pterois volitans\") is a venomous coral reef fish in the family Scorpaenidae, order Scorpaeniformes. \"P. volitans\" is native to the Indo-Pacific region, but has become an invasive species in the Caribbean Sea, as well as along the East Coast of the United States and East Mediterranean. This and a similar species, \"Pterois miles\", have both been deemed invasive species. Red lionfish are clad in white stripes alternated with red/maroon/brown stripes. Adults in this species can grow as large as 47 cm (18.5 in) in length, making it one of the largest species of lionfish in the ocean, while juveniles are typically shorter than . The average red lionfish lives around 10 years. As with many species within the family Scopaenidae, it has large, venomous spines that protrude from the body, similar to a mane, giving it the common name lionfish. The venomous spines make the fish inedible or deter most potential predators. Lionfish reproduce monthly and are able to quickly disperse during their larval stage for expansion of their invasive region. No definitive predators of the lionfish are known, and many organizations are promoting the harvest and consumption of lionfish in efforts to prevent further increases in the already high population densities.\n\n\"P. volitans\" is native to the Indo-Pacific region, including the western and central Pacific and off the coast of western Australia. However, the species has been accidentally introduced into the Western Atlantic, becoming an invasive species there and in the northern Gulf of Mexico as well.\n\nThey are mainly a solitary species and courting is the only time they aggregate, generally one male with several females. Both \"P. volitans\" and \"P. miles\" are gonochoristic, only showing sexual dimorphism during reproduction. Similar courtship behaviors are observed in all \"Pterois\" species, including circling, sidewinding, following, and leading. The lionfish are mostly nocturnal, leading to the behaviors typically around nightfall and continuing through the night. After courtship, the female releases two egg masses, fertilized by the male before floating to the surface. The embryos secrete an adhesive mucous allowing them to attach to nearby intertidal rocks and corals before hatching. During one mating session, females can lay up to 30,000 eggs. However, it has been observed that females will lay more eggs in the warmer months.\n\nAlthough little is known about the larval stage of the lionfish, some traits of the larvae include a large head, a long, triangular snout, long, serrated head spines, a large pelvic spine, and coloration only in the pelvic fins. Larvae hatch 36 hours after fertilization. They are good swimmers and can eat small ciliates just four days after conception. The larval stage is the shortest stage of the lionfish's life, with a duration of about one month.\n\nLionfish venomous dorsal spines are used purely for defense. When threatened, the fish often faces its attacker in an upside-down posture which brings its spines to bear. However, its sting is usually not fatal to humans. Envenomed humans will experience extreme pain, and possibly headaches, vomiting, and breathing difficulties. A common treatment is soaking the afflicted area in hot water, as very few hospitals carry specific treatments. However, immediate emergency, medical attention is strongly recommended, as some people are more sensitive to the venom than others.\n\nTwo of the 15 species of \"Pterois\", \"P. volitans\" and \"P. miles\", have established themselves as significant invasive species off the East Coast of the United States and in the Caribbean. About 93% of the invasive lionfish population is the red lionfish. The red lionfish was likely first introduced off the Florida coast in the early to mid-1980s, almost certainly from the aquarium trade. Adult lionfish specimens are now found along the East Coast from Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, to Florida, and in Bermuda, the Bahamas, and throughout the Caribbean, including the Turks and Caicos, Haiti, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Guadeloupe, Puerto Rico, St. Croix, Belize, Honduras, Aruba, Cayman Islands, Colombia and Mexico.\n\nIn its invasive range, few predators of the lionfish have been documented. Most larger Atlantic and Caribbean fish and sharks that should be able to eat the lionfish have not recognized them as prey, likely due to the novelty of the fish in the invaded areas. Lionfish have, however, been found in the stomachs of Nassau and tiger groupers in the Bahamas, but the former is critically endangered and therefore highly unlikely to provide significant predation. In its native range, two species of moray eels were found preying on lionfish. The Bobbit worm, an ambush predator, has been filmed preying upon lionfish in Indonesia; similar species inhabit the Caribbean. <br>The lionfish themselves are voracious feeders and have outcompeted and filled the niche of the overfished snapper and grouper. When hunting, they corner prey using their large fins, then use their quick reflexes to swallow the prey whole. They hunt primarily from late afternoon to dawn. High rates of prey consumption, a wide variety of prey, and increasing abundance of the fish lead to concerns the fish may have a very active role in the already declining trend of fish densities. As the fish become more abundant, they are becoming a threat to the fragile ecosystems they have invaded. Between outcompeting similar fish and having a varied diet, the lionfish is drastically changing and disrupting the food chains holding the marine ecosystems together. As these chains are disrupted, declining densities of other fish populations are found, as well as declines in the overall diversity of coral reef areas.\n\n"}

This was followed by Babylon Zoo's \"Spaceman\", which had been used in an advert for Levi's. The single was quite different from the version used in the advert, which had been sped up and re-arranged. It stayed at #1 for five weeks, sold over a million copies, and Jas Mann, the man behind Babylon Zoo, became the first solo male to make their chart debut at number 1.\n\nAfter five years, the boy band Take That announced that they were splitting up, resulting in such distress for their many fans that a telephone helpline had to be set up. Their final number 1 came in March, a cover of the Bee Gees song \"How Deep Is Your Love\". Several of the members went on to start a solo career, with Gary Barlow the first to hit #1 with \"Forever Love\" in July. However, it would be Robbie Williams who would go on to score the most success as a solo artist.\n\nAfter George Michael scored another number 1 with \"Fastlove\" in April, Gina G reached the top spot with \"Ooh Aah... Just a Little Bit\" in May. This song was the UK's entry to the 1996 Eurovision Song Contest, and originally reached #6 when it was released at the beginning of April. It hovered around the top 5 for the next few weeks, before moving up to 1 in the week of the contest. Although it failed to win, it still became the first Eurovision song to hit #1 since Nicole's \"A Little Peace\", which won the contest in 1982.\n\nThe next number 1 was also influenced by media events: \"Three Lions\", released by comedians David Baddiel and Frank Skinner and the band The Lightning Seeds, was the official song of the 1996 European Football Championship (Euro '96), which was being held in England. A rewritten version of the song (\"Three Lions '98\") would reach number 1 two years later, coinciding with the Football World Cup 1998 (France '98).\n\nThe Fugees had the biggest selling single of the year, with a cover of Roberta Flack's \"Killing Me Softly With His Song\". It sold over a million copies.\n\nHowever, by far the most successful act of the year was the Spice Girls, who kickstarted their career with three number 1 singles – the million-selling \"Wannabe\" in July, which was one of the longest No 1 stints by any girl group (7 weeks); (Shakespears Sister's \"Stay\" is the longest girl group No 1, with 8 weeks), and remains the biggest-selling single by a girl group; \"Say You'll Be There\" in October; and \"2 Become 1\" in December, also a million seller, the year's Christmas number one single and the UK's fastest selling single of 1996. The Spice Girls debut album \"Spice\" was the fastest selling album of 1996, shifting over 1.8 million copies in just 7 weeks. It was also the Number 1 album for Christmas 1996 and the second best-selling album of the year.\n\nOasis smashed the record for most weeks in the singles chart (previously held by Adam and the Ants in 1981) with 134 weeks, thanks to mass waves of re-entries of songs from their back catalogue throughout the year.\n\n1996 is also grimly notable for having the drummers of two popular bands, Mathew Fletcher of Heavenly, on 14 June, and Chris Acland of Lush, on 17 October, commit suicide. Lush had at the time been in the final stages of planning an American tour, which his devastated bandmates cancelled; they then disbanded.\n\nProlific classical composer Peter Maxwell Davies produced the tenth of his Strathclyde Concertos, an orchestral work which was first performed in Glasgow in October by the Scottish Chamber Orchestra, under the composer's baton. In June, his new opera, \"The Doctor of Myddfai\", was premièred in Cardiff. Other British composers who produced new works were Michael Berkeley (Viola Concerto) and John Tavener (\"Innocence\"). Andrew Lloyd Webber's new musical, \"Whistle Down the Wind\" opened in Washington D.C. in December, to poor reviews, but its score would go on to provide Boyzone with one of the best-selling singles of the decade in the form of \"No Matter What\"; the show did not appear in the West End until 1998.\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 1996 BRIT Awards winners were:\n\n\nThe 1996 Mercury Music Prize was awarded to Pulp – \"Different Class\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2205410", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2205410", "title": "Blepharoplasty", "text": "Blepharoplasty\n\nBlepharoplasty (Greek: blepharon, \"eyelid\" + plassein \"to form\") is the plastic surgery operation for correcting defects, deformities, and disfigurations of the eyelids; and for aesthetically modifying the eye region of the face. With the excision and the removal, or the repositioning (or both) of excess tissues, such as skin and adipocyte fat, and the reinforcement of the corresponding muscle and tendon tissues, the blepharoplasty procedure resolves functional and cosmetic problems of the periorbita, which is the area from the eyebrow to the upper portion of the cheek. The procedure is more common among women, who accounted for approximately 85% of blepharoplasty procedures in 2014 in the US and 88% of such procedures in the UK.\n\nThe operative goals of a blepharoplastic procedure are the restoration of the correct functioning to the affected eyelid(s) and the restoration of the aesthetics of the eye-region of the face, which are achieved by eliminating excess skin from the eyelid(s), smoothing the underlying eye muscles, tightening the supporting structures, and resecting and re-draping the excess fat of the retroseptal area of the eye, in order to produce a smooth anatomic transition from the lower eyelid to the cheek.\n\nIn an eye surgery procedure, the usual correction or modification (or both) is of the upper and the lower eyelids, and of the surrounding tissues of the eyebrows, the upper nasal-bridge area, and the upper portions of the cheeks, which are achieved by modifying the periosteal coverings of the facial bones that form the orbit (eye socket). The periosteum comprises two-layer connective tissues that cover the bones of the human body:\n\nThe Oriental blepharoplasty procedure differs from the classic blepharoplasty. In younger patients the goal of the surgery is to create a supratarsal fold (\"double eyelid surgery\") whereas in older patients the goals are to create or elevate the supratarsal fold and to resect surplus eyelid skin (\"Asian bleparoplasty\").\n\nThe thorough pre-operative medical and surgical histories, and the physical examination of the patient's periorbital area (eyebrow-to-cheek-to-nose), determine if the patient can safely undergo a blepharoplasty procedure to feasibly resolve (correct or modify, or both) the functional and aesthetic indications presented by the patient. Sequentially, lower eyelid blepharoplasty can successfully address the anatomic matters of excess eyelid skin, slackness of the eye-muscles and of the orbital septum (palpebral ligament), excess orbital fat, malposition of the lower eyelid, and prominence of the nasojugal groove, where the orbit (eye socket) meets the slope of the nose.\n\nConcerning the upper eyelid, a blepharoplasty procedure can resolve the loss of peripheral vision, caused by the slackness of the upper-eyelid skin draping over the eyelashes; the outer and the upper portions of the field of vision of the patient are affected and cause him or her difficulty in performing mundane activities such as driving an automobile and reading a book.\n\nIn many Asian countries, double eyelid surgery is the most popular surgery, especially in Korea. Depending on the methods, directing doctors' experience, and the difficulty of the individual case, this surgery can cost from between about $2000 and $4000 US Dollars. The procedure is famous for producing double-eyelid for patients in the most natural way for the long-term. This kind of operation normally takes about 30 minutes to an hour and patients are not required to stay hospitalized afterward. The stitches removal day is about 5 to 7 days after the surgery. Because of how common and simple the operation is, numerous foreigners come to South Korea each year to get their eyelids done.\n\nA blepharoplasty procedure usually is performed through external surgical incisions made along the natural skin lines (creases) of the upper and the lower eyelids, which then hide the surgical scars from view, especially when effected in the skin creases below the eyelashes of the lower eyelid. The incisions can also be made from the conjunctiva, the interior surface of the lower eyelid, as in the case of a transconjunctival blepharoplasty.\n\nTransconjunctival lower blepharoplasty technique was pioneered by Clinical Professor of Surgery at the University of Chicago Medicine, Dr. Anthony J. Geroulis and introduced to medical trial in 1998. Transconjunctival Technique has become the norm in the plastic surgery field with most surgeons preferring it over the external surgical incisions. This technique is particularly useful for patients with darker skin tones where standard external incision often leaves a visible white scar.\n\nTransconjunctival blepharoplasty technique permits the excision (cutting and removal) of the lower-eyelid adipose tissue without leaving a visible scar, but, the transconjunctival blepharoplasty technique does not allow the removal of excess eyelid-skin.\n\nA blepharoplasty operation usually requires 1–3 hours to complete. Post-operatively, the initial swelling and bruising consequent to the surgery will subside and resolve with 1–2 weeks; the final, stable results of the blepharoplastic correction will become apparent after several months. The results of a blepharoplasty procedure are best appreciated by comparing pre- and post-operative (before-and-after) photographs of the eye region of the patient.\n\nAfter the procedure, a type of stitch known as a canthopexy is placed near the outer corner of the lower eyelid, which is inside the tissue. This allows the eyelid's position to remain fixed during the healing process. The canthopexy is dissolved after four to six weeks of use. For particular patients, a mid-face elevation may be required to rejuvenate the lower eyelid-cheek complex.\n\nThe anatomic condition of the eyelids, the \"wear-and-tear\" quality of the patient's skin, his or her age, and the general condition of the adjacent tissues, consequent to the anatomic conditions of the patient, affect the functional and aesthetic results achieved with the eyelid surgery. Additional to the anatomic conditions of the eye region of the patient, the occurrence, or not, of medical complications is determined by factors such as:\n\nAs techniques began developing the ancient Greeks and Romans began writing down and collecting everything they knew involving these procedures. Aulus Cornelius Celsus, a first-century Roman, described making an excision in the skin to relax the eyelids in his book \"De Medicina\".\n\nKarl Ferdinand von Gräfe coined the phrase blepharoplasty in 1818 when the technique was used for repairing deformities caused by cancer in the eyelids.\n\nLaser blepharoplasty is the performance of eyelid surgery using a laser instead of a scalpel. Laser blepharoplasty is often combined with laser eyelid rejuvenation, as the two procedures can be performed in conjunction.\n\nHistorically there has been some contention as to the categorization of laser treatment on upper or lower eyelids as blepharoplasty, which is itself by definition surgical. The statutory definition of surgery and that supported by the American College of Surgeons states that surgery is the \"treatment ... by any instrument causing localized alteration or transportation of live human tissue, which include lasers..\".\n\n\nWhat is Blepharoplasty?"}

They are also known by the English name \"Starvation Island\". The islets are accessible from the mainland at mid-to low tide. The clipper \"Norman Court\" ran aground nearby, in Cymyran Bay.\n\nThe islands are important for their tern colony, in particular for roseate tern, for which this is the most regular breeding site on Anglesey, although numbers of breeding pairs are low currently (2005) compared with the past. Because of this the island has been designated as part of the Ynys Feurig, Cemlyn Bay and The Skerries Special Protection Area along with two other nearby sites, Cemlyn Bay and The Skerries, and all three are also classed by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area.\n\nYnys Feurig is also a Site of Special Scientific Interest. Birds interchange regularly between all three sites, and form part of a larger Irish Sea tern population together with birds at sites in Ireland such as Rockabill Island. The major threat to the terns here is predation by rats; in 1978 rats killed 17 adult terns including 14 roseate terns, as well as taking all the eggs and young of that year. The RSPB warden the site to protect the terns; management measures they have undertaken here to help increase the roseate tern population include small-scale control of vegetation and provision of nestboxes, although it is thought that the number of breeding pairs at this site is primarily dependent on the overall health of the Irish Sea population.\n\nThe site first came to national attention among birders in July 2005 when a sooty tern paid a very brief visit, before relocating to The Skerries and Cemlyn.\n"}

Its lead designer, Julian Gollop, previously designed the \"X-COM\" series and the original \"Laser Squad\".\n\n\"Laser Squad Nemesis\" is a game of turn-based isometric combat, where players issue orders to a squad of soldiers or aliens. Each turn, the player gives orders to their troops, previews probable effects of those orders, and submits them to the \"LSN\" server via the web interface, or through email. Orders are resolved simultaneously after both players have submitted their orders, and the consequences of the round are sent back to both players. The result of the previous turn is viewed in a real time ten-second video, with pause, slow motion and rewind (multiple turns) options.\n\nThere are four species that can be played in the game: the Marines, the Machina, the Spawn and the Greys. Marines are armoured foot soldiers that rely on their mobility and firepower to stay alive. Machina are slower, durable mechanical units with strong firepower. Spawn are an alien race that rely on numbers. They are mostly melee units and must get close to the opponent to engage them, though they do possess some ranged units. Greys are the stereotypical alien race with expensive weapons, mind-control technology and energy shields to protect their fragile bodies. Each race is distinct from the others and requires different tactics to be used efficiently.\n\nA number of enthusiasts run their own tournaments, where participants can play as part of a team or individually. There is also an automated tournament system that enables the game server to start games between players as necessary. Some of the more enterprising players have set up their own competitions using this system, and it is also used for the official Codo tournaments.\n\nAccording to the official purchasing web page, the purchaser owns the Single player campaigns outright, and can also play unlimited Hotseat games with another person, but must maintain a paid subscription in order to play online multiplayer games.

The game was released for the Game Boy Advance on December 18, 2003 in Japan; August 18, 2004 in North America; and February 18, 2005 in Europe. The game is based on Osamu Tezuka's manga and anime franchise \"Astro Boy\". However, it also features characters and plotlines from the artist's entire canon of work.\n\nWhile \"Astro Boy\" had been well known for decades in Japan, the North American release was delayed to coincide with the premiere of the \"Astro Boy\" TV series in 2004. During this delay, Treasure made some game improvements to the North American version of the game. The game received positive reviews from critics, with strong praise focused on the game's visuals, and limited criticism on level design. In 2010, the game was included as one of the titles in the book \"1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die\".\n\n\"Omega Factor\" is a beat 'em up game starring Astro Boy, the main character of the \"Astro Boy\" media franchise. Astro attacks enemies using high-powered punches and kicks, which can also knock enemies into other ones and destroy them as well. Doing some damage to the enemies will slowly fill the EX gauge at the top of the screen. Once the gauge is filled, Astro is able to perform a special attack; rather than simply helping the player, these are required in some situations. Astro is also able to fly using rocket power, which is also sometimes necessary.\n\nEvery non-player character the player meets scores a point that can be used to improve one of Astro's stats, such as strength or flight speed. This is generally not necessary to beat the game, but the incremental stat increases can make the game easier, as well as allowing the player to find hidden areas in levels. The game features two difficulty levels in the Japanese version, and three in the North American and European versions.\n\n\"Omega Factor\" features elements from \"Astro Boy\"s different incarnations. The concept of robot rights, Dr. Tenma's ultimate plan for Astro and the robot city of Robotonia in Antarctica are lifted from the \"Astro Boy\" 2003 TV series. Plotlines from other Tezuka series include a time travel plot lifted from \"\", a journey to the lost continent of Mu, and a subplot involving Duke Red's daughter and her role in the \"Death Mask\" orbital platform. The game is divided into two episodes: Birth and Rebirth. The Birth episode follows Astro's adventures and other characters he interacts with, and ends with robots being destroyed by a device called Death Mask, after it determines that the robots are too dangerous to be left alive, leaving Sharaku able to conquer the Earth. In Rebirth, Astro is revived by a being called Phoenix, and has Astro go back to the beginning of the story and try to stop the Death Mask, giving him the ability to go back and forward in time to do so.\n\nThe story includes characters from Tezuka's entire canon of work. The characters are listed in the \"Omega Factor\", an in-game encyclopedia of the \"Astro Boy\" fictional universe, which provides a detailed character biography, including each character's appearances and roles in Tezuka's works.\n\n\"Omega Factor\" was developed by Treasure and Hitmaker, and published by Sega. It was produced in conjunction with the PlayStation 2 game \"Astro Boy\" and the new \"Astro Boy\" TV series. Sega waited until the North American premiere of the TV series before releasing the games in North America. During this six-month wait, Treasure took the opportunity to rework some aspects of the North American version of the game. Some level layouts were filled with more enemies, and some enemies were given different attacks. In addition, Treasure somewhat improved the issue of framerate slowdown, and added a new third difficulty level. The game received a rating of \"E\" (Everyone) from the ESRB and 3+ from PEGI.\n\n\"Omega Factor\" received positive reviews, with aggregate scores of 85 out of 100 from Metacritic and 86.72% from GameRankings. GameSpot's Frank Provo stated that \"[e]veryone, regardless of age, simply must own and play \"Astro Boy: Omega Factor\" – because it is one of the best action games on the Game Boy Advance.\" GameSpy writer Benjamin Turner listed it as one of the best Game Boy Advance games of the year.\n\nThe game was highly praised for its visuals. Provo called the game, overall, \"a delight for the senses,\" and praised the detail and lavish animation of the background and character sprites. Geoffrey Winter of Nintendojo stated that the environments are \"beautiful and look as if they were built to be admired, not just walked through.\" He went on to say that \"Omega Factor\" has more seductively detailed visuals than any other Game Boy Advance game. IGN's Craig Harris called it a \"technical marvel,\" especially praising the fluid animation of the bosses, and reserving criticism for the game's occasional framerate slowdown. \"The New York Times\" Charles Herold called it a \"memorable experience\".\n\nThe few instances of criticism the game received were mainly directed at the repetitiveness of the levels. Turner listed this repetitiveness, specifically for the shooter stages, as one of the game's \"cons.\" Harris stated that some of the levels \"are the absolute pits and feel completely out of place because of their slapped-together feel.\" 1UP.com's Sam Kennedy stated that the levels are \"more of a formality than anything – you casually battle a set of enemies until you reach a boss, which is where the real gameplay begins.\"\n\n\"Nintendo Power\" named this their 38th best game of all time in their final issue, saying that it \"captures the essence of Astro Boy perfectly and melds it with developer Treasure's trademark brand of pulse-pounding action.\" In 2013, \"Game Informer\" listed \"Omega Factor\" as one of the \"Best Anime and Manga-Based Games\" released in English.\n\n"}

In addition to being active in the music business, Lampa and her siblings run an organization called People Loving Nashville, whose mission is to feed and clothe the homeless of Nashville. Her parents both still live in Colorado. Lampa began singing as a toddler and learned to sing perfect harmony by the time she was four years of age. During her childhood, she was actively involved in performing throughout Colorado, winning competitions and singing the National Anthem at the major sports events. She was raised in a Catholic home and had a strong faith foundation as a child.\n\nAt age 14, she was discovered by Word Records A&R and producer, Brent Bourgeois, while attending (but not competing in) the Music in the Rockies, a Christian music conference in Colorado. This led to a bidding war among the Christian labels in Nashville, but she ultimately signed at the then-Sony-owned Word Records.\n\nLampa released her debut album \"Live for You\" in August 2000. The album became a huge hit spawning four number one singles and winning a Dove Award for the number one hit \"Blessed\". She made several appearances to promote the album including an appearance on \"The Tonight Show\" \"The View\" as well as features on \"USA Today\", \"Billboard\", \"People Magazine\", & \"Seventeen\". She was even invited to sing at World Youth Day in Rome with Luis Fonsi, a song she originally recorded as a duet with Aaron Neville for his record. She has also toured with Stacie Orrico, as well as artists such as Amy Grant, Vincle Gill, Destiny's Child, Boyz To Men, Michael W. Smith, Switchfoot, TobyMac, among others. Her song \"If You Believe\" was part of the soundtrack to \"A Walk to Remember\", which was released in early 2002. In March 2002, she released her second album, \"Kaleidoscope\". It also got positive reviews. Three of singles released made it to the top five on the charts. The first single, \"No Greater Love\", made it to No. 2 on the CCM charts. \"I'm All Yours\" made it to the top five on the CCM Charts. The fourth single was \"Brand New Life\". In October 2002 she released a remix album \"Blur\", featuring remixes of her hit songs, as well as personal favorites.\n\nIn July 2004, Lampa released her third studio album, \"Rachael Lampa\" produced by Tommy Sims. The album received praise among the critics for its diverse styles, which included contemporary, retro, acoustic, soul, R&B, and even ska. It was also the first time that Lampa had written or co-written on every track. She served as executive producer for the album. Guest artists on the album included Robert Randolph, and Christian rapper T-Bone. Three singles were released from the album. \"When I Fall\" was the album's first single, reaching number seven on the Christian music charts. She toured most of the year for promotion.\n\nIn October 2005, she appeared on the album \"The Message\", where she wrote and sang the song \"Flag (Psalm 57 and 108)\". In May 2006, Word Records released a greatest hits collection, titled, \"Blessed: The Best of Rachael Lampa\". It features a seventeen-song collection of her best and favorite songs, from her four albums. On October 6, 2006, \"Hidden Secrets\", a film touted as the Christian version of \"The Big Chill\" debuted with Lampa starring as \"Sally\". Her co-stars included John Schneider from the television series \"The Dukes of Hazzard\". Lampa performed four songs for the film: \"When I Fall\", \"The Good Life\", \"No Other One\" and \"The Art\". On June 5, 2007, Lampa revealed in a blog that she was writing and recording new songs for a new album. She also revealed on her blog that she was looking for a new label. Lampa appeared in Christian rapper T-Bone's video for the song \"Name Droppin\" the first single of his album \"Bone-Appetit!\".\n\nIn December 2009, Lampa released a Christmas EP, \"Three Songs for Christmas\", exclusively to her website. Lampa released her first extended play \"Human\" independently on January 5, 2010.\n\nRachael also spent most of 2009 on tour as a background singer for Jordin Sparks on The Jonas Brothers Tour and the Britney Spears Tour.\n\nIn 2011, Lampa and Tyler Ward, produced a cover of \"Rocketeer\" by Far East Movement. She signed with Universal Music Christian Group and later released her fifth studio album, \"All We Need\", on September 27, 2011. The lead single, \"Remedy\", was released on July 26, 2011.\n\nStarting in August 2011, Lampa took part with vocal group made up of fellow friends and musicians from Nashville called \"The Collective\" during the third season of the NBC musical reality show \"The Sing-Off\". The Collective made it up to week six of the show before being eliminated from the series. On January 15, 2013, Lampa was featured on a music video with recording artist Jonathan Thulin. The song \"Bombs Away\" was co-written and stars Lampa. The video received critical and fan praise for its unique approach to the gospel. In June 2014, she provided special guest vocals on \"Infinite\", a single by Kevin Max.\n\nIn 2015, she began working as a backing vocalist for Irish singer/musician, Hozier. They toured extensively and internationally. Appeared on Saturday Night Live, Jimmy Fallon, Ellen , Jimmy Kimmel, and Seth Myers, among others. They also appeared on the Grammy's singing a collaboration with Annie Lennox, American Music Awards, and performed at the Glastonbury Music Festival.\n\nIn 2017, she began posting about working on new music. She released a cover of the hymn, \"Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus\", late in the year and made it available on all major streaming platforms, and filmed a visual for the track.\n\nIn 2019, she released a new single, \"Side of my Heart\".\n\nLampa graduated from Monarch High School in May 2003. While in high school she was a starting point guard for the girls basketball team. She married Brendan McCarthy on March 27, 2010. Lampa and singer, Stacie Orrico, are close friends. Lampa resides in Nashville. She has dipped in and out of recording and touring, both as the artist and the support. She has said that the periods of silence were for personal searching, for identity checks, and to maintain a true and authentic Christian faith. \"There have been some trying moments, but I knew eventually I needed to stop distracting myself and really lean into it.\" After almost two years on the road with Hozier, Lampa returned home and announced that she was expecting her first child. Her son, Jackson, was born on September 18, 2016.\n\nCompilations\n\n\n\n"}

They are best known for their songs \"January\", \"Magic\" and \"Just A Smile\".\n\nBoth Paton and Lyall had briefly been substitute members of the Bay City Rollers before that band's breakthrough. Joined by drummer Stuart Tosh, the band recorded several demos during 1972 and 1974. They were signed to a management contract with Nick Heath and Tim Heath, sons of British bandleader Ted Heath, and John Cavanagh. In due course they signed to a worldwide recording deal with EMI Records. After the recording of their debut album, \"From the Album of the Same Name\", guitarist Ian Bairnson (who had played on the album as a session musician) joined the band permanently.\n\nThe 1974 single \"Magic\" from their first album, produced by Alan Parsons and written by Paton, was a No. 11 UK and No. 5 US success. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc by the R.I.A.A. in August 1975. The song \"January\" gave them their greatest success in the UK, securing the number one spot in the UK Singles Chart on 1 February 1975. It stayed at number one for three weeks. (It also went to number one in Australia where it stayed up top for eight weeks; in the United States, it reached the lower end of the Hot 100.) However, the group failed to make the Top 30 again. The arranger of \"January\", Andrew Powell, went on to record Kate Bush, and both Paton and Bairnson played on her debut album, \"The Kick Inside\", which included \"Wuthering Heights\". Paton and Bairnson also played on Kate Bush's second album \"Lionheart\" (1978).\n\nThe band's other singles chart successes were \"Call Me Round\" and \"Just a Smile\" (both 1975), which each hit the top 40 in the UK and nowhere else. By 1977, only Paton and Bairnson were left from the original foursome, and they recorded Pilot's final album (the aptly titled \"Two's a Crowd\") with session musicians.\n\nBy 1978, all of Pilot's members had begun other projects, notably Tosh, Paton and Bairnson becoming members of the Alan Parsons Project, and Tosh also working with 10cc.\n\nLyall died of AIDS-related causes in 1989.\n\nPaton and Bairnson reconvened in 2002, to re-record the original Pilot album \"Two's a Crowd\". The subsequent issue was entitled \"Blue Yonder\".\n\nIn 2003 and 2006, the band co-wrote the Irish pop band Westlife's singles \"Obvious\" and \"Amazing\", which peaked at No. 3 and No. 4 respectively in the UK Singles Chart. Both were released as the third singles from their number one studio albums, \"Turnaround, and Face to Face\".\n\nAs they approached the 40th anniversary of Pilot's debut album, Paton, Bairnson, and Tosh reunited as Pilot. They released \"A Pilot Project\" in August 2014 as an homage to The Alan Parsons Project singer Eric Woolfson.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2205503", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2205503", "title": "Cartellverband", "text": "Cartellverband\n\nThe Union of Catholic German Student Fraternities ( or \"Cartellverband\" (CV)) is a German umbrella organization of Catholic male student fraternities (Studentenverbindung).\n\nDuring the period of 19th century in Germany called the Kulturkampf, the Prussian state tried to reduce the influence of the Catholic Church. As a result of this, many Catholic organizations were founded in order to withstand this pressure by forming a single front.\n\nCatholic students of several universities in Germany, Austria and Switzerland formed Catholic fraternities. These Catholic fraternities were the successors of informal Catholic clubs, founded by students of theology. They were formed according to the historic examples of the already existing fraternities, like wearing couleur, rules of behaviour, lifelong membership and democratic organization, but added as main principle the foundation upon the Catholic faith.\n\nIn 1851 in Munich a fraternity called \"Aenania München\" was founded. This fraternity tried to establish connections to other Catholic fraternities on other universities. On 6 December 1856, Aenania München formed an alliance with the newly founded \"Winfridia Breslau\". This formal alliance was the birth of the Cartellverband. Both fraternities shared the same principles, \"religio, scientia et amicitia\".\n\nIn 1864 \"Guestfalia Tübingen\" and \"Austria Innsbruck\" entered the Cartellverband. Later \"Bavaria Bonn\" founded in 1844, entered. In 1871 \"Alsatia Münster\", renamed Saxonia Münster, and \"Markomannia Würzburg\", \"Hercynia Freiburg im Breisgau\" in 1873, \"Suevia Berlin\" in 1876, \"Rhenania Marburg\" and \"Burgundia Leipzig\", both in 1880 followed.\n\nThese new Catholic fraternities, called Studentenverbindungen, faced strong resistance of the older Corps and Burschenschaften and of the administrations of the universities as well. They were forbidden to wear their colors and one, Alsatia Münster even was forced to temporary suspend itself. Nevertheless the Cartellverband showed a solid growth of membership.\n\nIn 1907 a fourth principle, \"patria\", was added to the other three. Patria did not mean a limitation of membership to people of German, Austrian or Swiss origin, as several members from other countries, as Belgium, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom show. For example, on 28 February 1905 the first American, Irville Charles LeCompte , later a professor at Yale, was accepted as a member of AV Rappoltstein, then in Strasbourg, now in Cologne (KDStV Rappoltstein).\n\nSince its foundation, the Cartellverband only accepted into its structure one fraternity from every university, called the principle of singularity. Those fraternities, which were denied membership founded other umbrella organisations, like the \"Katholische Deutsche Verband farbentragender Studentenkorporationen (KDV)\", sharing the same principles as the CV. In 1907 the principle of singularity was abolished. Now the former members of these umbrella organisations could join the Cartellverband, which structure and membership exploded.\n\nDuring the first years the member fraternities of the Cartellverband were forbidden to accept members without a certificate of having passed the Abitur, the German equivalent of a university entrance qualification. In these times this Abitur was not necessary to study on a technical university. The fraternities of these universities accepted such students. Those fraternities founded their own organizations because they could not gain membership in the Cartellverband. Because it abolished the precondition of Abitur in 1904, those fraternities could also join the Cartellverband. Shortly before World War I, former fraternities of the \"Unitas-Verband\", like \"Alania Bonn\" and \"Cheruskia Tübingen\" also entered the Cartellverband.\n\nSeveral small organizations, like the \"Österreichischer Cartellverband\", the \"Cartell katholischer Verbindungen an Tierärztlichen Hochschulen\", the \"Verband Katholischer Studentenvereine\" and the \"Cartell katholischer Verbindungen an Landwirtschaftlichen Hochschulen\" followed. Thus the Cartellverband became the largest organisation representing Catholic academics in Germany and Austria.\n\nThe Catholic fraternities always faced reproaches to endanger the academic liberty with their Catholic faith, because as avowing Catholics they would be Ultramontanists, following orders from the other side of the mountain, which means from the Vatican on the other side of the Alps. Therefore they were declared enemies of the Empire. During the Kulturkampf (1872–1887) the few fraternities of the CV could not ply a significant part. During the academic Kulturkampf of 1903–1908 the situation had changed. Now the Catholic fraternities were a main target of the attacks of nationalistic and liberal fraternities.\n\n7199 members of the CV served in World War I. 1282 of them, more than 10% of the whole members died. After World War I the CV was spread on seven states, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, France, Poland, Czechoslovakia and Romania, but soon the fraternities of Strasbourg had to leave Alsace. Having shared the bloodshed of World War I the catholic and non confessional fraternities put an end to their quarrels by signature of the Erlangener Verbände- und Ehrenabkommen (Treaty of honour between academic organizations of Erlangen) in 1921. Now all fraternities treated each other as equals.\n\nThe so-called White Ring was an organisation within the CV, existing from 1908 until 1923. The members were the fraternities Bavaria Bonn, Burgundia München, Ripuaria Freiburg im Breisgau, and Zollern Münster. Some other fraternities sympathized with them, for example Guestfalia Tübingen, Rheno-Palatia Breslau, Rheno-Franconia München and Marco-Danubia Wien.\n\nWhen in 1912 the CV decided that all Cartellbrüder (Members of different fraternities of the CV) had to call each other \"Du\" (an address used in families and among close friends), a treatment comparable to call someone by first name, these fraternities rejected the request. Because they were denied to use the \"Sie\" (a formal address, directed to strangers, especially superior persons) to address a \"Cartellbruder\", they decided to call the Bundesbrüder, the members of the own fraternity, Sie. The formal sign of the white ring was a white carnation. This was terminated by the Cartellversammlung of 1923, where these doings were forbidden.\n\nThe Cartellversammlung of 1932 forbade the members of the CV fraternities to be member of the NSDAP as well, because the German bishops opposed the NSDAP. One year later, the relations between the German state and the Vatican were cleared by the Reichskonkordat. Now there was no more reason to deny membership in a party the Holy See had relations with. The same day members already wore uniforms of the SA and the SS. \nBeginning in 1933 there was a process of Gleichschaltung (alignment). The fraternities had to develop a principle of leadership similar to the party organizations of the NSDAP and connection to the national socialist student community. \nAs a reaction to these proceedings, the Austrian fraternities and those in Czechoslovakia split off. They founded the Österreichischen Cartellverband der katholischen deutschen Studentenverbindungen (ÖCV) on 10 July 1933, and the Sudetendeutscher Cartellverband der farbentragenden katholischen deutschen Studentenverbindungen (SCV) on 14 June 1933. They were to never reunite.\n\nOn 31 January 1934 the leadership of the CV declared the Catholic orientation of the CV to be terminated. On 27 October 1935 the Cartellversammlung decided to close the CV. Now only the fraternity Teutonia Fribourg in Switzerland survived. On 20 June 1938 the remaining structures of the CV were eliminated by order of Heinrich Himmler, the leader of the SS. All property of the former fraternities was confiscated. Although the fraternities did not exist any more, many of the former members tried to find informal ways to live their academic traditions. There was no unitary attitudes. Among the members of the CV were culprits and victims of the National Socialism alike.\n\nAfter the war, the fraternities tried to re-establish themselves. This was a difficult and very painful process. Victims of the Nazi tyranny met those who destroyed their fraternities or even participated in crimes. In 1950 the CV was re-established, but it had changed. The fraternities in Austria did not return, those in the German Democratic Republic, Poland, Czechoslovakia and Ukraine had to search for a new location within Western Germany or Austria.\n\nThe CV and the ÖCV, the organization of the Austrian Fraternities and the Student organization of Switzerland formed friendship with a contract on 10 February 1963 at Innsbruck. The CV is a founding member of the European Federation of Christian Students' Associations in 1975. It is also member of the consortium of Catholic Organizations (AGV), of the Pax Romana - International Catholic Movement for Intellectual and Cultural Affairs and the Catholic of Germany and several other organizations.\n\nToday the German (CV) and Austrian (ÖCV) Cartellverband together unite more than 177 active and 12 inactive German student fraternities in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium, France, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Poland, Slovakia and Syria. Today they represent 42,000 academics throughout the world. For example of member fraternities, see K.A.V. Lovania Leuven or Catholic German student corporation Saarland (Saarbrücken) Jena.\n\nThe Cartellverband is a confederation of individual fraternities with equal principals, in a subsidiary relation, which means that the fraternities have the greatest possible autonomy, within the framework of the basic principles of the Cartellverband.\n\nAll the member fraternities share equal rights and duties, especially equal voting rights. Only in matters of protocol, a distinction is made on the basis of the historic date of membership of the Cartellverband. Individual persons can not become a member of the Cartellverband.\n\nAll the Aktivitates (an Aktivitas is the entirety of the members of a single fraternity, still member of the university) of the single fraternities together form the Studentenbund, the Altherrenschaft (Altherrenschaft is the entirety of the members of a fraternity who finished their studies) together form the Altherrenbund.\n\nIf there are several member fraternities in a town, these are to form Ortsverbände, local divisions of the CV to coordinate their connections and their exterior view. For example there are Ortsverbände at Aachen (7 Fraternities), Darmstadt (3), Freiburg im Breisgau (6), Hannover (3), Köln (7), München-Freising-Weihenstephan (10), Münster (7), Würzburg (6,) Mainz, (3), Frankfurt am Main (4), Heidelberg (2), Berlin (4) Bonn (8) and Erlangen-Nürnberg (3).\n\nTo see the member fraternities please watch List of member fraternities of the Cartellverband\n\nThe development of membership:\n\nBefore the split off of 1933\n\nAfter the split off without the members of the ÖCV \n\nIn about 247 locations in Germany and Austria, and in Brussels, Luxembourg, Paris and New York there are regional groups of individual members of fraternities of the Cartellverband called \"Zirkel\". These offer the regular possibility for individual members, living far from their fraternity, to keep contact to other members who live nearby.\n\nThe oldest Zirkel, founded 1876 in Koblenz is called \"Confluentia Koblenz\".\n\nThe supreme legislative institution is the \"Cartellversammlung (C.V.)\", the assembly of all the member fraternities of the Cartellverband. It is composed of two chambers, the \"Studentenbund\" and the \"Altherrenbund\", representing students and alumni. Each fraternity has one vote. In addition to the meetings, the programme during a Cartellversammlung consists of a ball, a Kommers and a Holy Mass on Sunday. For spouses of members and girlfriends, there is a parallel cultural program.\n\nSuperior executive institution is the CV-Rat (CV Council). Chairman is the chairman of the executive committee of the Altherrenbund. The other Members are the Vorortspräsident (the chairman of the Aktive) and two elected members, one elected by the Alte Herren, one elected by the Aktive. There are several other institutions as the department of pastoral care, the department of treasure, the department of academic education and the legal department.\n\nEvery year another fraternity or local group of fraternities presides the CV. They form the Vorortspräsidium (executive committee of the Ative), consisting of the president the vice president and heads of the divisions social policy, press and publicity, foreign contacts and finance. This Vorort also represents the whole Cartellverband. The executive committee of the Altherrenbund, a president, and several heads of regional divisions is elected for therms of four years.\n\nThe Cartellverband has its own courts on fraternity, regional and national level. These function as an honorary Senate.\n\nDer Cartellverband is publisher of a magazine, called \"Academia\", which is published five times a year. This magazine was founded in 1888.\n\n\nNearly every fraternity of the Cartellverband is founded upon four guiding principles: \n\nThe fraternities of the Cartellverband historically do not practise academic fencing (Mensur) because it was forbidden by the Roman Catholic Church. Academic fencing is common with the more liberal student fraternities that already existed in German-speaking countries. Owing to this restriction, Catholic students had to organize themselves in separate fraternities. The fraternities only accept men into the organization.\n\nThe motto of CV : In necessariis unitas, in dubiis libertas, in omnibus caritas (\"In essentials, unity; in doubtful matters, liberty; in all things, charity.\").\n\nThis was a phrase used by Christian Irenics, and has been traced to Rupert Melden in \"Paraenesis votiva pro Pace Ecclesiae ad Theologos Augustanae Confessionis, Auctore Ruperto Meldenio Theologo\", 62 pp. in 4to, without date and place of publication. It probably appeared in 1627 at Frankfort-on-the-Oder, which was at that time the seat of theological moderation. Melden was a Lutheran, but the motto has also been used by the catholic Church, such as in John XXIII's first encyclical, \"Ad Petri Cathedram\" of 1959. The English version is also frequently used by British Freemasons.\n\nThe coat of arms was designed in 1921 by Dr. Joseph Weiß and Philipp Schumacher. It shows a shield, parted; on gold a black eagle with a white shield on his breast, the old sign of Christ, Chi-Rho, within; on red a green hill with a white tower and a golden star on each side.\n\nA Helmet with a medieval student on top, in a green coat, doubled gold and yellow, a sword on his right side. In the left hand, he has a flag with a golden cross on a red shield containing the letters C and V surrounded by a green wreath. In the left hand he has a red book. The manteling is made in the colors green, dubbled silver on the left side, dubbled red and gold on the right side. in the manteling is a white ribbon with the motto.\n\n\nThe Cartellverband has an official anthem, called \"Laßt ihr buntbemützten Scharen\". The text was written by Heinrich Gassert, a member of Hercynia Freiburg im Breisgau, in 1885, the melody was adopted from the former popular song \"Strömt herbei ihr Völkerscharen\", composed by Peter Johannes Peters in 1867. It has six strophes, which are following:\n\n1.Laßt Ihr buntbemützten Scharen schallen euren Festgesang, aus dem Liede der Scholaren töne laut der Freiheit Klang! Singet deutscher Art zum Preise drum ein rechtes Burschenlied, durch des´ Wort und durch des´ Weise frisch der Hauch der Freiheit zieht.\n\n2.Singt zum Preise Eurer Farben, die der Schönheit Glanz verklärt! Was die Neider dran verdarben, nicht des Scheltens ist es wert. Unsre Farben, die wir tragen, schmücken unsrer Ehre Schild. Sind nach außen drum geschlagen, weil´s ihn blank zu halten gilt.\n\n3. Greift die Freundschaft hoch zu preisen, in die Saiten tief und voll, Freundschaft muß die Losung heißen, wenn der Bund bestehen soll. Deutsche Freundschaft sich bewähret, sie ist treu bis in den Tod, und die Liebe sie verkläret, wie den Fels das Abendrot.\n\n4.Auf das Auge zu den Sternen, auf den Blick zum Himmelszelt, wo ein Gott in heil´gen Fernen Eures Bundes Banner hält. Auf zum heil´gen Fahneneide, hebt die Bruderhand und schwört, daß dem Gott im Sternenkleide ewig Euer Herz gehört!\n\n5.Tretet her, Ihr Musensöhne, an des Wissens heil'gen Born; Schöpft das Gute, trinkt das Schöne aus der Weisheit Wunderhorn. Bringt der Schönheit Eure Liebe als ein reines Opfer dar, legt des Herzens beste Triebe auf der Wahrheit Hochaltar.\n\n6.Reicht die Hand Euch, Ihr vom Rheine, Ihr vom Neckar, Ihr vom Main, Ihr vom schroffen Alpenstein, ihr vom grünen Eichenhain. Euer Burschenwort zum Pfande, laßt es schallen himmelwärts: Unserm deutschen Vaterlande, unsre Hand und unser Herz.\n\nOnly fraternities are members of the Cartellverband, in the strict sense of the word.

Dysplasias on mainly microscopic scale include epithelial dysplasia and fibrous dysplasia of bone. Dysplasias on mainly macroscopic scale include hip dysplasia, myelodysplastic syndrome and multicystic dysplastic kidney.\n\nEpithelial dysplasia consists of an expansion of immature cells (such as cells of the ectoderm), with a corresponding decrease in the number and location of mature cells. Dysplasia is often indicative of an early neoplastic process. The term dysplasia is typically used when the cellular abnormality is restricted to the originating tissue, as in the case of an early, \"in-situ\" neoplasm. \nDysplasia, in which cell maturation and differentiation are delayed, can be contrasted with metaplasia, in which cells of one mature, differentiated type are replaced by cells of another mature, differentiated type.\n\n\"Myelodysplastic syndromes\" (\"MDS\") are a group of cancers in which immature blood cells in the bone marrow do not mature and therefore do not become healthy blood cells. Problems with blood cell formation result in some combination of low red blood cells, low platelets, and low white blood cells. Some types have an increase in immature blood cells, called blasts, in the bone marrow or blood.\n\nFibrous dysplasia of bone is a disorder where normal bone and marrow is replaced with fibrous tissue, resulting in formation of bone that is weak and prone to expansion. As a result, most complications result from fracture, deformity, functional impairment and pain.\n\n\"Hip dysplasia\" is an abnormality of the hip joint where the socket portion does not fully cover the ball portion, resulting in an increased risk for joint dislocation. Hip dysplasia may occur at birth or develop in early life. Regardless, it does not typically produce symptoms in babies less than a year old. Occasionally one leg may be shorter than the other. The left hip is more often affected than the right. Complications without treatment can include arthritis, limping, and low back pain.\n\n\"Multicystic dysplastic kidney\" (\"MCDK\") is a condition that results from the malformation of the kidney during fetal development. The kidney consists of irregular cysts of varying sizes. Multicystic dysplastic kidney is a common type of renal cystic disease, and it is a cause of an abdominal mass in infants.\n\n\n"}
