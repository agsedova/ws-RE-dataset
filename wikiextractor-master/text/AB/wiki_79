With the molecular formula AuCl, the name gold trichloride is a simplification, referring to the empirical formula, AuCl. The Roman numerals in the name indicate that the gold has an oxidation state of +3, which is common for gold compounds. There is also another related chloride of gold, gold(I) chloride (AuCl). Chloroauric acid, HAuCl, the product formed when gold dissolves in aqua regia, is sometimes referred to as \"gold chloride\" or \"acid gold trichloride\". Gold(III) chloride is very hygroscopic and highly soluble in water as well as ethanol. It decomposes above 160 °C or in light.\n\nAuCl exists as a chloride-bridged both as a solid and as a vapour, at least at low temperatures. Gold(III) bromide behaves analogously. The structure is similar to that of iodine(III) chloride.\n\nIn gold(III) chloride, each gold center is square planar, which is typical of a metal complex with a d electron count. The bonding in AuCl is considered somewhat covalent. \n\nGold(III) chloride is most often prepared by passing chlorine gas over gold powder at 180 °C: \n\nAnother method of preparation is by reacting Au species with chloride to produce tetrachloroaurate. Its acid, chloroauric acid, is then heated to eliminate hydrogen chloride gas. Reaction with aqua regia produces gold(III) chloride:\n\nOn contact with water, forms acidic hydrates and the conjugate base . It may be reduced by causing elemental gold to be precipitated from solution.\n\nAnhydrous AuCl begins to decompose to AuCl at around 160 °C; however, this in turn undergoes disproportionation at higher temperatures to give gold metal and AuCl.\n\nAuCl is Lewis acidic and readily forms complexes. For example, it reacts with hydrochloric acid to form chloroauric acid ():\n\nOther chloride sources, such as KCl, also convert AuCl into . Aqueous solutions of AuCl react with aqueous base such as sodium hydroxide to form a precipitate of Au(OH), which will dissolve in excess NaOH to form sodium aurate (NaAuO). If gently heated, Au(OH) decomposes to gold(III) oxide, AuO, and then to gold metal.\n\nGold(III) chloride is the starting point for the synthesis of many other gold compounds. For example, reaction with potassium cyanide produces the water-soluble complex, K[Au(CN)]:\n\nAuCl has attracted the interest of organic chemists as a mild acid catalyst for a variety of reactions, although no transformations have been commercialized. Gold(III) salts, especially Na[AuCl] (prepared from AuCl + NaCl), provide an alternative to mercury(II) salts as catalysts for reactions involving alkynes. An illustrative reaction is the hydration of terminal alkynes to produce acetyl compounds.\n\nSome alkynes undergo amination in the presence of gold(III) catalysts. Gold catalyses the alkylation of certain aromatic rings and a conversion of furans to phenols. For example, a mixture of acetonitrile and gold(III) chloride catalyses the alkylation of 2-methylfuran by methyl vinyl ketone at the 5-position:\n\nThe efficiency of this organogold reaction is noteworthy because both the furan and the ketone are sensitive to side-reactions such as polymerisation under acidic conditions. In some cases where alkynes are present, phenols sometimes form (Ts=tosyl):\n\nThis reaction involves a rearrangement that gives a new aromatic ring.\n\nAs a stoichiometric reagent, auric chloride reacts with benzene (and a variety of other arenes) under extremely mild conditions (minutes at room temperature) to afford the dimeric phenylgold(III) dichloride:PhH + ½AuCl → ½[PhAuCl] + HCl\n"}
{"id": "2015575", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2015575", "title": "Metadata (CLI)", "text": "Metadata (CLI)\n\nMetadata, in the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI), refers to certain data structures embedded within the Common Intermediate Language (CIL) code that describes the high-level structure of the code. Metadata describes all classes and class members that are defined in the assembly, and the classes and class members that the current assembly will call from another assembly. The metadata for a method contains the complete description of the method, including the class (and the assembly that contains the class), the return type and all of the method parameters. \n\nA CLI language compiler will generate the metadata and store this in the assembly containing the CIL. When the run-time executes CIL it will check to make sure that the metadata of the called method is the same as the metadata that is stored in the calling method. This ensures that a method can only be called with exactly the right number of parameters and exactly the right parameter types.\n\nThe Windows Runtime application platform, present in Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8, makes use of the CLI metadata format to describe component interfaces for code written in any of the supported programming languages. A difference in use within the Common Language Runtime is that an assembly typically does not contain any CIL instructions.\n\nDevelopers can add metadata to their code through \"attributes\". There are two types of attributes, custom and pseudo custom attributes, and to the developer these have the same syntax. Attributes in code are messages to the compiler to generate metadata. In CIL, metadata such as inheritance modifiers, scope modifiers, and almost anything that isn't either opcodes or streams, are also referred to as attributes. \n\nA custom attribute is a regular class that inherits from the codice_1 class. A custom attribute can be used on any method, property, class or entire assembly with the syntax: codice_2 as in:\nCustom attributes are used by CLI extensively. Windows Communication Framework uses attributes to define service contracts, ASP.NET uses these to expose methods as web services, LINQ to SQL uses them to define the mapping of classes to the underlying relational schema, Visual Studio uses them to group together properties of an object, the class developer indicates the category for the object's class by applying the codice_3 custom attribute. Custom attributes are interpreted by application code and not the CLR. When the compiler sees a custom attribute it will generate custom metadata that is not recognised by the CLR. The developer has to provide code to read the metadata and act on it. As an example, the attribute shown in the example can be handled by the code:\nclass CustomAttribute : Attribute\n\nThe name of the class is mapped to the attribute name. The Visual C# compiler automatically adds the string \"codice_1\" at the end of any attribute name. Consequently, every attribute class name should end with this string, but it is legal to define an attribute without the codice_1-suffix. When affixing an attribute to an item, the compiler will look for both the literal name and the name with codice_1 added to the end, i. e. if you were to write codice_7 the compiler would look for both codice_8 and codice_9. If both exist, the compiler fails. The attribute can be prefixed with \"codice_10\" if you don't want to risk ambiguity, so writing codice_11 will not match codice_9. Using the attribute invokes the constructor of the class. Overloaded constructors are supported. Name-Value pairs are mapped to properties, the name denotes the name of the property and the value supplied is set by the property.\n\nSometimes there is ambiguity concerning to what you are affixing the attribute. Consider the following code:\n[Orange]\npublic int ExampleMethod(string input)\n\nWhat has been marked as orange? Is it the codice_13, its return value, or perhaps the entire assembly? In this case, the compiler will default, and treat the attribute as being affixed to the method. If this is not what was intended, or if the author wishes to clarify their code, an \"attribute target\" may be specified. Writing codice_14 will mark the return value as orange, codice_15 will mark the entire assembly. The valid targets are codice_16, codice_17, codice_18, codice_19, codice_20, codice_21, codice_22, codice_23 and codice_24.\n\nA pseudo-custom attribute is used just like regular custom attributes but they do not have a custom handler; rather the compiler has intrinsic awareness of the attributes and handles the code marked with such attributes differently. Attributes such as codice_25 and codice_26 are implemented as pseudo-custom attributes. Pseudo-custom attributes should never be used by ILASM, as it has adequate syntax to describe the metadata.\nAssemblies contain tables of metadata. These tables are described by the CIL specification. The metadata tables will have zero or more entries and the position of an entry determines its index. When CIL code uses metadata it does so through a metadata token. This is a 32-bit value where the top 8 bits identify the appropriate metadata table, and the remaining 24 bits give the index of the metadata in the table. The Framework SDK contains a sample called metainfo that will list the metadata tables in an assembly, however, this information is rarely of use to a developer. Metadata in an assembly may be viewed using the ILDASM tool provided by the .NET Framework SDK.\n\nReflection is the API used to read CLI metadata. The reflection API provides a logical view of metadata rather than the literal view provided by tools like metainfo. Reflection in version 1.1 of the .NET framework can be used to inspect the descriptions of classes and their members, and invoke methods. However, it does not allow runtime access to the CIL for a method. Version 2.0 of the framework allows the CIL for a method to be obtained.\n\nBesides the SystemReflection namespace, other tools are also available that can be used to handle metadata. The Microsoft .NET Framework ships a CLR metadata manipulation library that is implemented in native code. Third-party tools to retrieve and manipulate metadata include PostSharp and Mono Cecil can also be used.\n\n"}
{"id": "2015577", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2015577", "title": "Cleopatra Selene II", "text": "Cleopatra Selene II\n\nCleopatra Selene II (Greek: Κλεοπάτρα Σελήνη; summer 40 BC – BC; the numeration is modern) was a Ptolemaic princess and Queen of Mauretania. She was the most important royal woman in the early Augustan age.\n\nCleopatra Selene was the only daughter of Greek Ptolemaic Queen Cleopatra VII of Egypt and Roman Triumvir Mark Antony. In the Donations of Antioch and of Alexandria, she was made ruler of Cyrenaica and Libya. After Antony and Cleopatra's defeat at Actium and their suicides in Egypt in 30 BC, Selene and her brothers were brought to Rome and placed in the household of Octavian's sister, Octavia the Younger, a former wife of her father.\n\nSelene eventually married Juba II of Numidia and Mauretania. She had great influence in Mauretania's government decisions, especially regarding trade and construction projects. During their reign, the country became extremely wealthy. The couple had a son and successor, Ptolemy of Mauretania. Through their granddaughter Drusilla, the Ptolemaic line intermarried into Roman nobility for many generations.\n\nCleopatra Selene was born in approximately 40 BC in Egypt, as Pharaoh Cleopatra VII's only daughter. Her second name (\"moon\" in ancient Greek) opposes the second name of her twin brother, Alexander Helios (\"sun\" in ancient Greeek). She was raised and highly educated in Alexandria in a manner appropriate for a princess. The twins were formally acknowledged by their father, Triumvir Mark Antony, during a political meeting with their mother in 37 BC. Their younger brother, Ptolemy Philadelphos, was born a year later. Their mother most likely planned for Selene to marry her older half-brother Caesarion, possibly the only biological son of Julius Caesar, after whom he was named.\n\nOver the next two years, Antony bestowed a great deal of land on Cleopatra and their children under his triumvoral authority. In 34 BC, during the Donations of Alexandria, huge crowds assembled to witness the couple sit on golden thrones on a silver platform with Caesarion, Cleopatra Selene, Alexander Helios, and Ptolemy Philadelphus sitting on smaller ones below them. Antony declared Cleopatra to be Queen of Kings, Caesarion to be the true son of Julius Caesar and King of Egypt, and proceeded to bestow kingdoms of their own upon Selene and her brothers. She was made ruler of Cyrenaica and Libya. Neither of the children were old enough to assume control of their lands, but it was clear that their parents intended they should do so in the future. This event, along with Antony's marriage to Cleopatra and divorce of Octavia Minor, older sister of Octavian (future Roman Emperor Caesar Augustus), marked a turning point that led to the Final War of the Roman Republic.\n\nBy the time Octavian arrived in Egypt in the summer of 30 BC, Antony and Cleopatra had sent the children away. Caesarion went to India, but en route he was betrayed by his tutor, intercepted by Roman forces and executed. Selene, Alexander, and Ptolemy Philadelphos went south to Thebes. In 31 BC. during a naval battle at Actium, their parents were defeated by Octavian. In 30 BC, they committed suicide as Octavian and his army invaded Egypt. The deaths of their mother and Caesarion left Selene and Alexander nominally in charge of Egypt until the kingdom was officially annexed by the Roman Empire two weeks later.\n\nOctavian captured Selene and her brothers, and took them to Rome. During his triumph, he paraded the twins dressed as the moon and the sun in heavy golden chains, behind an effigy of their mother clutching an asp to her arm. The chains were so heavy that the children were unable to walk in them, eliciting unexpected sympathy from many of the Roman onlookers.\n\nOnce Egypt had ceased to exist as an independent kingdom, there remained the question of what to do with Selene and her brothers. In the absence of any surviving relative, responsibility for the children passed to Augustus, who in turn gave the siblings to Octavia to be raised in her household on the Palatine Hill. They were members of an extended family that included their half-brother Iullus Antonius (their father's son with his late wife Fulvia), their half-sisters, both called Antonia (daughters of their father with Octavia), and Octavia's older children from a previous marriage, Marcus Claudius Marcellus and his two sisters called Marcella. Between 26 and 20 BC, Cleopatra Selene is the only known surviving member of the Ptolemaic dynasty. Her brothers are not recorded in any known historical account and are presumed to have died, possibly from either illness or assassination.\n\nOctavia arranged for Cleopatra to marry the intellectual King Juba II of Numidia, whose father had committed suicide in 46 BC. He was sent to be raised in Caesar's household; on Caesar's death in 44 BC custody passed to Octavian, the future Augustus. The marriage likely took place in 25 BC and was commemorated in an epigram that survives in its entirety:\nThe couple had two children:\n\nA hoard of Selene's coins has been dated at 17 AD. It is traditionally believed that she was alive to mint them, but this would mean that her husband married Princess Glaphyra of Cappadocia during Selene's lifetime. Historians generally assume that Juba wouldn't have taken a second wife as a thoroughly Romanized king, arguing that if he married Glaphyra before 4 AD, then his first wife must have already been dead. However, even contemporary client kings with Roman citizenship took multiple wives. It is possible that Selene and Juba separated for a time, but that their rift was mended after Juba's divorce from Glaphyra.\n\nIn 25 BC, Augustus decided to confer on Juba and Selene the newly created client kingdom of Mauretania as Numidia had been turned into the Roman province of Africa Nova in 46 BC. The young rulers renamed their new capital \"Caesarea\" (modern Cherchell, Algeria), in honor of the Emperor.\n\nMauretania was a vast territory, but lacked organization. Cleopatra Selene is said to have exercised great influence on the policies which Juba promoted. She imported many important advisers, scholars, and artists from her mother's royal court in Alexandria to serve in Caesarea. Through the couple's influence, the Mauretanian kingdom flourished.\n\nCleopatra supported Mauretanian trade. The kingdom developed a significant export throughout the Mediterranean region, particularly with Spain and Italy. Their products included fish, grapes, pearls, figs, grain, wooden furniture and purple dye harvested from shellfish. Tingis (modern Tangier), a town at the Pillars of Hercules (modern Strait of Gibraltar), became a major trade centre. The value and quality of Mauretanian coins became recognised throughout the Roman Empire.\n\nCleopatra's promotion of architecture marks a transition between the Hellenistic style and Roman. The construction and sculptural projects at Caesarea and Volubilis display a mixture of Ancient Egyptian, Greek and Roman architectural styles. These buildings included a lighthouse in the style of Pharos of Alexandria in the harbour, a royal palace situated in the seafront, and numerous temples dedicated to Roman and Egyptian deities. Her vigorous promotion of her mother's legacy stood in sharp contrast to the negative image being disseminated in contemporary Augustan poetry.\n\nThe couple ruled Mauretania for almost two decades until Cleopatra's death at the age of 35. Controversy surrounds her exact date of death. The following epigram by Greek epigrammatist Crinagoras of Mytilene is considered to be her eulogy:\nIf this poem isn't simply literary license, Selene's death seems to have ironically coincided with a lunar eclipse. If so stronomical correlation then can be used to help pinpoint the date of her death: Lunar eclipses occurred in 9, 8, 5 and 1 BC and in AD 3, 7, 10, 11 and 14. The event in 5 BC most closely resembles the description given in the eulogy. However, the date of her death is not ascertainable with any certainty. Zahi Hawass, former Director of Egyptian Antiquities, believes Cleopatra died in 8 AD.\n\nSelene was placed in the Royal Mausoleum of Mauretania in modern Algeria, built by her and Juba east of Caesarea and still visible. Juba died in 23 AD and was buried in the same tomb. There is a fragmentary inscription dedicated to the couple as the \"King and Queen of Mauretania\". Their remains have not been found at the site, perhaps due to tomb raids, possibly shortly after the mausoleum's construction; or because the structure was meant to serve as a memorial and not as a place of burial.\n\nCleopatra was survived by her husband and their son Ptolemy, who ruled Mauretania together until Juba's death in AD 23. Ptolemy then reigned until 40, when he was executed by Emperor Caligula, his mother's great nephew, who was probably jealous of Mauretania's wealth. Caligula's successor, Emperor Claudius, took advantage of Ptolemy's lack of heirs and assumed control of Mauretania, turning it into the Roman provinces of Mauretania Caesariensis and Mauretania Tingitana. Thereafter, Cleopatra, Juba and Ptolemy were mostly forgotten.\n\nOne of the two satellites of the asteroid (216) Kleopatra was named Cleoselene in her honor.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The national drink is the rakia . \n\nWith Serbia being located on the crossroads between East and West, its cuisine has gathered elements from different cooking styles across the Middle East and Europe to develop its own hearty gastronomy with an intricate balance of rich meats, vegetables, breads, cheese, fresh pastries and desserts. It has much in common with the cuisines of neighboring Balkan countries. Its flavours are mild, fresh and natural. Seasonings are usually salt, black pepper and paprika, while ingredients are fresh and of good quality. Eating seasonal food is very important, and many dishes are strongly associated with a specific time of the year.\n\nMost people in Serbia will have three meals a day , breakfast, lunch and dinner, lunch being the largest. However, traditionally, only lunch and dinner existed, with breakfast being introduced in the second half of the 19th century.\n\nA number of foods which are usually bought in the West are often made at home in Serbia.

Food preparation is a strong part of the Serbian family tradition.\n\nWilliam, archbishop of Tyre, who visited Constantinople in 1179, described the Serbs: \"\"They are rich in herds and flocks and unusually well supplied with milk, cheese, butter, meat, honey and wax\"\".\n\nThe first published cookbook in Serbia is The Big Serbian Cookbook (\"Велики српски кувар\"), written by Katarina Popović-Midzina in 1877.\n\nThe best known Serbian cookbook is Pata's Cookbook (\"Патин кувар\"), written by Spasenija Pata Marković in 1907; the book remains in publication even today.\n\nAn old Serbian legend says that during the time of the 14th-century Serbian Empire, under the rule of Stefan Uroš IV Dušan, meals in the Serbian palace were eaten with golden spoons and forks. Historians say that mediaeval Serbian cuisine mainly consisted of milk, dairy produce and vegetables. Not a lot of bread was eaten, but when it was, the rich ate bread made from wheat and the poor ate bread made from oats and rye. The only meat consumed was game, with cattle kept for agricultural use.\n\nBreakfast in Serbia is an early but hearty meal, rich in calories and carbohydrates, meant to provide one with enough energy to start the day well. Bread is frequently eaten, served with butter, jam, yogurt, sour cream or cheese, accompanied by bacon, sausages, salami, eggs or kajmak. Many people would stop by a bakery in the morning to enjoy fresh pastries, such as pogačice, paštete, kifle (which in Serbian usage may or may not be crescent-shaped and may be sweet, but may also be sprinkled with salt crystals), kiflice, perece, buhtle, pletenice, štapići, zemičke, djevreci, mekike and uštipci. Other common breakfast dishes include burek, kačamak and cicvara (types of polenta), popara, proja (cornbread) and čalabrca. Before breakfast most people usually have a cup of coffee, or perhaps espresso. With the breakfast itself either a tea, milk, milk coffee, or chocolate milk is served.\n\nMeze is an assortment of small dishes and appetizers, though, unlike the Middle Eastern meze, it does not usually include cooked dishes, and is therefore more similar to Italian antipasto. A Serbian meze typically includes slices of cured meats and sausages, cheeses, olives, fresh vegetables and zimnica. Meze is served either to accompany alcoholic drinks or as a starter before a soup on bigger meals.\n\nSoups are eaten as an entrée at almost every lunch. They are considered to be very important for good health. There are two types of soups in Serbian cuisine: thin soups called \"supa\", and thicker soups with roux or eggs called \"čorba\". The most common ones are simple pottages made of beef or poultry with added noodles. Lamb, veal and fish soups are considered delicacies.\n\nThe main course is most commonly a meat dish. Besides \"roštilj\" (barbecue) which is very popular, braising, stewing and roasting in an oven are the most common cooking methods. \nGrilling is very popular in Serbia. Grilled meats are the primary main course dishes offered in restaurants. They are commonly served as mixed grill on large oval plates. They are often also eaten as fast food. The cities of Leskovac and Novi Pazar are especially famous for their barbecue.\n\nBread is the staple of Serbian meals and it is often treated almost ritually. A traditional Serbian welcoming is to offer the guest with bread and salt; bread also plays an important role in religious rituals. Many people believe that it is sinful to throw away bread regardless of how old it is. Although pasta, rice, potato and similar side dishes did enter the everyday cuisine over time, many Serbs still eat bread with meals.\n\nIn most bakeries and shops, white wheat bread loafs (typically 0.5 kg) are sold. In modern times, black bread and various graham bread variations regain popularity. In many rural households, bread is still baked in ovens, usually in bigger loafs.\n\nIn Serbia, salads are eaten as a side dish with the main course. The simplest of salads are made of sliced lettuce, cabbage, tomato, cucumber or carrot, olives with oil, vinegar salt and spices.\n\nDairy products are an important part of the Serbian diet. Fermented products such as sour milk, kajmak, yogurt and pavlaka are common breakfast foods, consumed daily. White cheese, called \"sir\" are much more common in Serbia than yellow cheeses. There are numerous varieties, some of which have been awarded for their quality, such as the white cheese with walnuts from Babine, which won the 2012 \"best autochtonic cheese\" award. Serbian Pule cheese, made from donkey milk, is the most expensive cheese in the world. Although less common, several yellow cheese are locally produced.\n\nEvery autumn or early winter, on an event called \"svinjokolj\" pigs are slaughtered and meat is dried in the cold air, cured and preserved for winter. Cured meats, bacon, salo, čvarci, Sausages such as krvavica and kulen are produced. Offal and cheaper cutts of meat are utilized as well, made into processed products such as švargla.\n\nIn Serbia, pies are very popular. They are eaten either for breakfast, dinner, or as a snack. Most commonly they are made with thin layers of phyllo dough. There are several preparation methods and numerous types of fillings, both sweet and savory. Usually, pies are named after either the preparation method, or the filling.\n\nOne pie variety that is not made with phyllo is the \"štrudla\", which, in turn, isn't similar to strudel, but rather to a nut roll.\n\nSweets are served at the end of meals. Sweets and desserts enjoyed in Serbia include both typically Middle Eastern and typically European ones, as well as some authentically Serbian ones. Besides the ones mentioned here, pies with sweet fruit fillings are also commonly eaten as desserts.\n\nDomestic coffee (or Serbian coffee) is the most commonly consumed non-alcoholic beverage in Serbia. It is mostly prepared at home, rather than bought in coffee shops, and preferably consumed in the company of friends or family. Slatko, ratluk and raki may be served alongside coffee. The majority of the Serbian population starts a day with a cup of coffee in the morning. Herbal teas are consumed as a medication, rather than a beverage. Yogurt and kefir are commonly consumed dairy beverages. They frequently accompany savory pastries. A beverage made from maize, called boza or kvas, used to be popular in the past. Today it is rarely consumed.\n\nA number of fruit juice and mineral water brands are produced locally. The Knjaz Milos mineral water is considered a national brand.\n\nRakija/Raki is a general term for distilled beverages made from fruits. There are numerous varieties, which are usually named after the type of fruit they are made from. Comparatively many people brew their own rakija. Loza, made from grapes, is considered the national drink.\n\nBeer has become recently popular and is enjoyed in Serbia, event outpacing the traditional raki and wine. The largest brewery in the country is Apatinska pivara.\n\nThere are nearly 110,000 hectares of vineyards in Serbia, producing about 645,000 tons of grapes annually, with South Serbia producing the most. Because of that, Serbia has great international recognition as a wine producer.\n\n\n"}

He was regarded as the premier choreographer of Hollywood sword-fighting, and during his career he coached many actors in swordsmanship, including Errol Flynn, Sean Connery, Antonio Banderas, Viggo Mortensen, Adrian Paul, and Johnny Depp. He also appeared as a stunt double for Darth Vader's lightsaber battles in \"The Empire Strikes Back\" and \"Return of the Jedi\".\n\nAnderson was educated at The Royal Hospital School, in Raleigh House. It was here that he began to fence. Anderson joined the Royal Marines and won several combined services titles in the sport of fencing. He served in the Mediterranean during the Second World War.\n\nAs a competitive fencer, he represented Great Britain at the Helsinki 1952 Summer Olympic Games, and the World Championships in 1950 and 1953 in the sabre event. He finished tied for fifth in the team sabre event at Helsinki in 1952.\n\nAfter his retirement from fencing competition, he studied under Prof. Roger Crosnier and was appointed the first official British National Coach, in charge of the National Training System, the day he was awarded his full Professorship. He succeeded Prof. Crosnier as President of the British Academy of Fencing. During the late 1950s to the 1970s he travelled around Britain, and between fencing courses he combined his official duties with television and film work. Eventually emigrating to Canada, he went on to become technical director of the Canadian Fencing Association in Ottawa. During the 1960s and 1970s he was also the president of the British Academy of Fencing.\n\nAnderson's cinema career began in 1953 when he choreographed fights for and coached Errol Flynn in \"The Master of Ballantrae\". During rehearsal for a scene he accidentally slashed Flynn on his thigh, leading to notoriety in Hollywood as \"the man who stabbed Errol Flynn\". He went on to work as a stunt performer and/or fight choreographer in films such as \"The Guns of Navarone\" and the Bond films \"From Russia With Love\" and \"Casino Royale\". His stature in Hollywood was cemented when he was selected by Stanley Kubrick in 1974 to act as the sword master for \"Barry Lyndon\".\n\nAnderson subsequently went on to be involved in all three of the original \"Star Wars\" films. Anderson did not receive much recognition for his work for years after their initial release. Mark Hamill in 1983 revealed, \"Bob Anderson was the man who actually did Vader's fighting. It was always supposed to be a secret, but I finally told George I didn't think it was fair any more. Bob worked so bloody hard that he deserves some recognition. It's ridiculous to preserve the myth that it's all done by \"one\" man.\" Anderson in 1994 specified that for \"The Empire Strikes Back\" and \"Return of the Jedi\" he staged the lightsaber duels and also wore the Vader costume in fight scenes. David Prowse, who played Vader, said he did his own swordplay in the first \"Star Wars\" film but afterward, \"having one of the principals do his own stunts made [the filmmakers] very weird from an insurance point of view.\"\n\nAnderson continued to work in cinema for the next 30 years, and was responsible for the swordsmanship in many films, including \"Highlander\", \"The Princess Bride\", \"The Three Musketeers\", \"The Mask of Zorro\", \"\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\" film trilogy. Shortly before his death he was working on \"The Hobbit\". He had a reputation for being a perfectionist, with director Martin Campbell giving him the nickname \"Grumpy Bob\". Anderson was interviewed at length for the 2009 documentary on cinematic sword-fighting, \"Reclaiming the Blade\", where he commented, \"I never took up the sword, I think the sword took me up.\"\n\nAnderson died on New Year's Day, 2012 in a West Sussex hospital at the age of 89.\n\nAfter his death his widow, Pearl, and daughter, Simone, visited the Royal Hospital School and donated Anderson's swords, medals and movie footage to a museum.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The Japanese DVD was released by video game publisher Atlus on March 25, 2005.\n\nIt is based on a far futuristic planet where four mercenaries band together to try and unlock the power of the ultimate weapon which can either save humanity or destroy it. Against mechas and strange races, they sweep the vast planet to reach their goal.\n\nAqualoid was a prosperous planet, but an attack from a mysterious life force, the Inorganics, transforms it into a post-apocalyptic shell of its former self. When Nam finds a mysterious sword, he is suddenly the object of a planet-wide chase. With the Inorganics closing in, will Nam and his friends discover the secret of the sword and save their world? Or will they destroy Aqualoid in favor of a new Birth?\n\nYoshinori Kanada acted as one of the OVA's key animators. Another noteworthy animator on \"Birth\" was a young Hideaki Anno, who would go on to direct \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\".\n\nTwo English dubs of \"Birth\" exist. The first was licensed in 1987 by Harmony Gold and released by Streamline Pictures in North America and the United Kingdom under the title \"The World of the Talisman\". According to \"New Straits Times\", it briefly aired in Malaysia in late 1987. The OVA was later retitled yet again to \"Planet Busters\". Harmony Gold's version changes some of the character names, tones down some of the more surreal Japanese humour to appeal to a younger audience, and contains more American-style dialogue, alternate music composed by Randy Miller and additional voice-overs. The second dub by ADV Films, released on DVD on July 13, 2004, is much more faithful to the original Japanese version.\n\nIn order of appearance - ADV (2004) / Streamline (1992, 1987) / Japanese (1984)\n\n"}
{"id": "2015619", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2015619", "title": "M.K. 22", "text": "M.K. 22\n\nM.K. 22 (Hebrew: מ.ק. 22 - Mem Qoph 22) is an Israeli animated sitcom, revolving around the adventures of soldiers in a fictional IDF military base hosting the so-called \"Israeli doomsday weapon\". The show was created for the cable channel Bip and debuted in March 2004, becoming the first prime time animated series in Israeli television,\nand was later rebroadcast partly censored on Channel 2. The show won the Israeli Television Academy Award for Best Comedy Series\nand is considered by many a milestone in the history of Israeli animation.\nDespite gaining popularity and critical acclaim, the negotiations for a second season seem to have failed, making the first 10-episode season the only one thus far.\n\n\n\"M.K. 22\" satirically deals with Israel Defense Forces manners and culture, and with general issues of Israeli society and current events in Israel. It is situated in the fictional top-secret logistics military base M.K. 22, in the south of Israel, storing the country's so-called nuclear missiles. Two of the show's creators, Yaron Niski and Doron Tzur, actually served together as logistics soldiers in an Israeli military base and the show is influenced by their experiences there.\n\nThe show's initial goal was \"to combine the style of \"South Park\" with local cult such as \"Giv'at Halfon\"\".\nDirector Assaf Harel claimed that the fact that the show was created for a cable network made it possible to use a blacker and more extreme type of humor, which he compared to that of \"South Park\".\nIn general, \"South Park\" is widely considered the show's biggest influence by Israeli critics and fans. Obvious similarities to \"South Park\" include the crude style of animation, the use of live-action (the episode \"One of Us\" showed parts of the 1989 Israeli film of the same name, which the episode parodied), and a tongue-in-cheek disclaimer similar to that of \"South Park\".\n\nM.K. stands for \"machane keva\", Hebrew for \"permanent [military] camp\", while the words \"Mem Qoph 22\" might sound like \"milkud 22\", the Hebrew translation for the idiom catch-22.\n\nThe show's themes included, among others, the tensions between Haredi Jews and homosexuals, the media attention given to Ilan Ramon (prior to his death), the aliyah from Ethiopia, the West Bank barrier and the Split broadcast incident. The show also parodied several films, TV shows, politicians and celebrities.\n\nAccording to Harel, the show's style of animation was influenced by \"South Park\", although \"M.K. 22\" uses more 3D computer graphics and more complicated backgrounds. The show's characters and backgrounds are made to appear deliberately crude, though not as if they're made of cut-out pieces of paper. There is only one round shape in the entire series, one of the soldiers' helmet, whereas other naturally round shapes look quadrilateral or polygonal. The Sun for instance, is a plain yellow square in the sky.\n\nIn 2005, when it was decided to broadcast the show on Channel 2, the show's straightforward treatment of delicate Israeli issues caused Keshet to censor parts of it. One of the episodes, \"Robo Rabbi\", was completely censored. It has been suggested that the background for the episode's censorship was the upcoming expiration of the Channel 2 tender.\nThe episode parodied the threats of violence of Haredi Jews towards the pride parade, and spoofed the film \"Yossi & Jagger\".\n\n\n"}

It is based on the story of Francesca da Rimini in the fifth canto of Dante's epic poem \"The Inferno\" (the first part of the \"Divine Comedy\"). The fifth canto is the part about the Second Circle of Hell (Lust). Rachmaninoff had composed the love duet for Francesca and Paolo in 1900, but did not resume work on the opera until 1904. The first performance was on 24 January (O.S. 11 January) 1906 at the Bolshoi Theatre, Moscow, with the composer himself conducting, in a double-bill performance with another Rachmaninoff opera written contemporaneously, \"The Miserly Knight\".\n\n\"The setting is the Malatesta castle around the end of the 13th century\"\n\nThe ghost of Virgil leads the poet Dante to the edge of the first circle of the Inferno.

The daughter of Ptolemy VIII and Cleopatra III of Egypt, Cleopatra Selene was favoured by her mother and became a pawn in Cleopatra III's political manoeuvres. In 115 BC, Cleopatra III forced her son Ptolemy IX to divorce his sister-wife Cleopatra IV, and chose Cleopatra Selene as the new queen consort of Egypt. Tension between the king and his mother grew and ended with his expulsion from Egypt, leaving Cleopatra Selene behind; she probably then married the new king, her other brother Ptolemy X.\n\nFollowing the marriage of the Syrian Seleucid princess Cleopatra I to Ptolemy V of Egypt, dynastic marriages between the two kingdoms became common. In 102 BC, Cleopatra III decided to establish an alliance with her nephew Antiochus VIII of Syria; Cleopatra Selene was sent as his bride. After his assassination in 96 BC, she married his brother and rival Antiochus IX. Cleopatra Selene lost her new husband in 95 BC and married a final time to Antiochus IX's son Antiochus X, who disappeared from the records and is presumed to have died in 92 BC, but may have remained in power until 89/88 BC (224 SE (Seleucid year)). Cleopatra Selene then hid somewhere in the kingdom with her children. Eventually, Syria split between the sons of Antiochus VIII with Philip I ruling in the Syrian capital Antioch and Antiochus XII in the southern city Damascus.\n\nCleopatra Selene had many children by several husbands. Probably following the death of Antiochus XII in 230 SE (83/82 BC), she declared Antiochus XIII, her son by Antiochus X, king, and seems to have declared herself co-ruler; they claimed Antioch following Philip I's death. But the people of Antioch and the governor of Damascus, exhausted by the Seleucids' civil wars, invited foreign monarchs to rule them: Tigranes II of Armenia took Antioch, while Aretas III of Nabataea took Damascus. Cleopatra Selene controlled several coastal towns until Tigranes II besieged her in 69 BC in Ptolemais; the Armenian king captured the queen and later executed her.\n\nBy the second century BC, the Seleucid Empire and the Ptolemaic Kingdom were weakened by dynastic feuds, constant wars against each other (known as the Syrian Wars), and Roman interference. To ease the tension, the two dynasties intermarried. Cleopatra I of Syria married Ptolemy V of Egypt in 193 BC, and her granddaughter Cleopatra Thea married three Syrian kings in succession starting in 150 BC. Those intermarriages helped Egypt destabilize Syria which was especially fragmented between different claimants to the throne; brothers fought between themselves and Egypt interfered by supporting one claimant against the other.\n\nCleopatra Selene was born between 135 and 130 BC to Ptolemy VIII and Cleopatra III. Cleopatra Selene had many siblings, including Ptolemy IX, Ptolemy X, and Cleopatra IV. Ancient writers, such as Cicero and Appian, mention that the queen's name is Selene, and Strabo clarified that she was surnamed \"Cleopatra\". On the other hand, modern scholars, such as Arthur Houghton and Catharine Lorber, believed that Selene was actually an epithet. The archaeologist Nicholas L. Wright suggested that she assumed the epithet \"Selene\" when she became queen of Egypt and that it is a divinising epithet, indicating that Cleopatra Selene presented herself as the manifestation of the moon goddess on earth. Coins struck in her name record her as Cleopatra Selene. Selene was the name of the Greek moon goddess and it is connected to the word selas (σέλας), meaning \"light\". \"Cleopatra\" was a Ptolemaic dynastic name; it means \"famous in her father\" or \"renowned in her ancestry\". As a queen of Syria, she was the second to rule with the name 'Cleopatra'. Hence, she is termed \"Cleopatra II Selene\" to differentiate her from her predecessor and aunt Cleopatra I Thea, who was the mother of Cleopatra Selene's husbands Antiochus VIII and Antiochus IX. Classicist Grace Macurdy numbered Cleopatra Selene as \"Cleopatra V\" within the Ptolemaic dynasty and many historians have used this convention.\n\nSibling marriage was known in ancient Egypt and, although it was not a general practice, it was acceptable for the Egyptians; the Ptolemies practised it, perhaps to consolidate the dynasty. In 116 BC, Ptolemy VIII died and his will left Cleopatra III to rule alongside a co-ruler of her choice from between her two sons; she wanted to choose Ptolemy X but the people of Alexandria (the capital of Egypt) opposed this, forcing her to accept Ptolemy IX's ascension to the throne. Shortly after his elevation, Cleopatra III forced Ptolemy IX to divorce Cleopatra IV, his sister whom he had married before their father's death; the 2nd-century historian Justin implied that Cleopatra III made this a condition of accepting him as co-ruler. Cleopatra Selene, favoured by her mother Cleopatra III, was chosen as the new queen consort in 115 BC. In 107 BC, the relationship between Ptolemy IX and his mother deteriorated; Cleopatra III forced him out of Egypt, and he left his wife and children behind.\n\nThe same year, 107 BC, Cleopatra Selene was probably married off to the new king, her younger brother, Ptolemy X. In 103 BC, Ptolemy IX was fighting in Judea. The queen mother feared an alliance against her between Ptolemy IX and his friend Antiochus IX of Syria, who was fighting a civil war with his brother Antiochus VIII; this led her to send troops to Syria. Cleopatra III and Ptolemy X conquered Ptolemais, and according to Justin, the king, shocked by his mother's cruelty, abandoned her and ran away; Cleopatra III then decided to marry Cleopatra Selene to Antiochus VIII, as a step to bring Antiochus VIII to her side in order to counter an alliance between Ptolemy IX and Antiochus IX. If it is accepted that Cleopatra Selene married Ptolemy X, then Cleopatra III divorced her from him after he deserted.\n\nThe marriage of Cleopatra Selene and Antiochus VIII took place c. 102 BC; historian Leo Kadman suggested that Cleopatra III gave her daughter to the Syrian king in Ptolemais before she retreated to Egypt, and that Cleopatra Selene kept that city as her main base until the end of her life. Details of Cleopatra Selene's life with Antiochus VIII are not clear; no known offspring resulted from the marriage, though six of Antiochus VIII's children from his previous marriage are known. In 96 BC, Herakleon of Beroia, a general of Antiochus VIII, assassinated his monarch and tried to usurp the throne, but failed and retreated to his home-town Beroia. The capital of Syria, Antioch, was part of Antiochus VIII's realm at the time of his assassination; Cleopatra Selene probably resided there.\n\nThe queen held out in the capital for a while before marrying Antiochus IX. The manner in which Antiochus IX took control of Antioch and his new wife in 95 BC is not clear; he could have taken the city by force or it could be that Cleopatra Selene herself opened the gates for him. In the view of historian Auguste Bouché-Leclercq, Cleopatra Selene had little reason to trust the five sons of her previous husband; the queen needed an ally who would help her control the capital while Antiochus IX needed a wife and Cleopatra Selene's influence over the city's garrison and her late husband's officials. It is unlikely that this marriage was received well by Antiochus VIII's sons. The first of them to act was Seleucus VI who was established in Cilicia. Within a year of his marriage to Cleopatra Selene, Antiochus IX marched against his nephew but was defeated and killed. Soon afterwards, Seleucus entered the capital. Cleopatra Selene probably fled before the new king's arrival. Alternatively, she might have been sent to Arados by Antiochus IX for protection before he marched against Seleucus.\n\nIn 218 SE (95/94 BC), Antiochus X, the son of Antiochus IX, proclaimed himself king in Arados, and married Cleopatra Selene. The Seleucid dynasty had a precedent of a son marrying his stepmother: Antiochus I had married his stepmother Stratonice, and this might have made it easier for Cleopatra Selene. Yet, the marriage was scandalous. Appian wrote an anecdote concerning the epithet of Antiochus X, \"\"Eusebes\"\" (\"the pious\"): the Syrians gave it to him to mock his show of loyalty to his father by bedding his widow. The rationale for the marriage might have been pragmatic: Antiochus X sought to be king, but had little resources and needed a queen. Cleopatra Selene was in her forties and could not simply marry a foreign king. Antiochus X pushed Seleucus VI out of Antioch in 94 BC and ruled northern Syria and Cilicia, while Seleucus VI's brothers Philip I and Demetrius III ruled Beroea and Damascus respectively. The last evidence for the reign of Antiochus X is dated to 92 BC; he is generally assumed to have died at around this date. Ancient sources contain contradictory accounts and dates, and the numismatist Oliver D. Hoover suggested the date of 224 SE (89/88 BC) for Antiochus X's demise. Antioch was taken by Demetrius III then Philip I.\n\nCleopatra Selene's location during the reign of Antiochus X's successors in Antioch is unknown. She evidently took shelter with her children somewhere in the kingdom, and possibly fled to Cilicia or Coele-Syria, probably the city of Ptolemais, which she held until her death. Antiochus XII, another son of Antiochus VIII who was ruling in Damascus, died in 230 SE (83/82 BC). With the throne of Antiochus XII vacant, Cleopatra Selene declared her son Antiochus XIII king.\n\nBased on the evidence of the coins depicting her alongside her ruling son, it appears that Cleopatra Selene acted as the regent. Many of those coins have been found, and they depict Antiochus XIII in the background and herself in the foreground, in the style of a queen regnant, where Cleopatra Selene's name is written before that of the king's. When she declared her son king, Cleopatra Selene controlled lands in Cilicia or Phoenicia or both. The archaeologist Alfred Bellinger suggested that she was in control of several coastal Syrian cities from a base in Cilicia; she certainly controlled Ptolemais and probably Seleucia Pieria. The 1st-century historian Josephus wrote of \"Selene ... who ruled in Syria\", indicating her continued influence despite her never controlling the capital Antioch. Her children probably remained in Cilicia or somewhere else in Asia Minor for protection, which would explain Antiochus XIII's nickname, \"\"Asiaticus\"\".\n\nAccording to Josephus, \"those that held Damascus\" invited Aretas III, King of the Nabataeans, to rule them because they feared Ptolemy (son of Mennaeus), king of the Iturea. Damascus' history between the death of Antiochus XII and 241 SE (72/71 BC), when the Armenian king Tigranes II took the city, is obscure. Based on her jugate coins which depict her alongside Antiochus XIII, Hoover suggested that Selene operated from Damascus; those coins used a broken-bar Alpha, cursive Epsilon and squared Sigma. This typography appeared in the Damascene coins of Demetrius III and Antiochus XII and is otherwise rare in the Hellenistic world. If her currency was minted in Damascus, then it dates to the period between the death of Antiochus XII and Tigranes II's occupation of the city. Two scenarios are possible:\n\n\nIn the north, Philip I ruled until his death, after which Cleopatra Selene claimed the rights of her children with Antiochus X to the vacant throne. The queen's claims of authority were not generally accepted by the Syrians, and the people of Antioch invited Tigranes II to rule Syria, being frustrated by the Seleucids' constant civil wars. The year in which this event took place is debated; 83 BC is, without any proof, commonly accepted as Philip I's year of death by the majority of scholars who count on the account of Appian, who assigned a reign of fourteen years for Tigranes II, which ended in 69 BC. Oliver D. Hoover suggested that Tigranes II invaded Syria only in 74 BC, with Philip I ruling until 75 BC in Northern Syria, allowing Cleopatra Selene and Antiochus XIII to claim the country unopposed for a while. An argument in favour of Cleopatra Selene and her son being the sole claimants of Syria in 75 BC is a statement by Cicero: the Roman statesman wrote that Antiochus XIII and his brother were sent to Rome by their mother in 75 BC. They returned to Syria in 240 SE (73/72 BC); the brothers claimed the throne of Egypt based on their mother's birthright. To impress the Roman Senate, the queen endowed her children with sufficient assets, which included a jewelled candelabrum that was dedicated to the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus. The Senate refused to hear their petition for the Egyptian throne, but, according to Cicero, their \"de jure\" right to the Syrian throne which they had inherited from their ancestors was already acknowledged.\n\nThe statement of Cicero indicates that in 75 BC, Tigranes II was still not in control of Syria, for if he were, Antiochus XIII would have asked the Roman Senate for support to regain Syria, since Tigranes II was the son-in-law of Rome's enemy, Mithridates VI of Pontus. Likewise, Philip I could not have been alive since Antiochus XIII went to Rome without having to assert his right to Syria. In a paper presented at the 131st annual meeting of the American Historical Association, Nikolaus Overtoom, based on Hoover's chronology, suggested that Cleopatra Selene was in control of the south while Philip I ruled the north until 75 BC; his death meant that Cleopatra Selene's son was the strongest candidate to the throne, but Philip I's faction, being opposed to Cleopatra Selene, offered the crown to Tigranes II who invaded and conquered the country in 74 BC.\n\nThe regency of Cleopatra Selene probably ended in 75 BC as the journey of Antiochus XIII to Rome indicates that he had already reached his majority or was close to it. Tigranes II, whose invasion probably took place during Antiochus XIII's absence, never controlled the entire country and took Damascus only in 72 BC. Cleopatra Selene resisted the Armenians in Ptolemais while Antiochus XIII probably took shelter in Cilicia. In 69 BC, Tigranes II besieged Ptolemais; the city fell according to Josephus, but Tigranes II had to move north fast as the Romans started attacking Armenia. According to Strabo, Tigranes II imprisoned the queen in Seleucia and later had her killed. Those accounts seem to contradict each other, but in the view of the seventeenth century historian William Whiston, they do not, since Josephus does not mention that Tigranes II captured the queen in Ptolemais. Historian John D. Grainger explained Tigranes II's action as a consequence of Cleopatra Selene's political importance; she was a winning card in the hands of her husbands, and Tigranes II sought to deny other ambitious men from acquiring influence through her. Others see Cleopatra Selene as a pawn in political schemes who later evolved into a schemer in her own right, one who decided her actions effectively based on her own benefit.\n\nCleopatra Selene's long career, as the wife of three successive Syrian monarchs, and the mother of one and a ruler in her own right, in addition to her divine status, turned her into a symbol of Seleucid continuity. The ancient Near East was ruled by successive dynasties whose monarchs claimed the title of Great King, i.e. imperial overlord. When the Romans ended the Seleucid dynasty in 64 BC, they attempted to simply replace the Syrian monarchs as an imperial authority, but the political reality of Rome as a republic meant that its legitimacy in the East was questioned. The Seleucid diadem was considered a symbol of legitimacy even after the fall of the Seleucid dynasty, and many eastern kings, such as the Parthian monarch Mithridates II, used Seleucid royal iconography to gain the local nobility's support in their domains. The Ptolemaic rulers of Egypt were the closest relatives of the Seleucids and their legitimate successors; Cleopatra VII of Egypt used the name of Cleopatra Selene for her daughter Cleopatra Selene of Mauretania, born 40 BC; this can be viewed in the context of Cleopatra VII's attempts to claim the Seleucid succession rights in the East.\n\n\nPtolemy X's son, Ptolemy XI, might have been the child of Cleopatra IV. Following Cleopatra IV's expulsion from Egypt in 115 BC, she went to Cyprus where Ptolemy X resided, but she departed quickly to Syria and married Antiochus IX; if Ptolemy XI was her son, then her abandonment of Cyprus is hard to explain, and her son would not have been considered legitimate, while the legitimacy of Ptolemy XI was unquestioned. Berenice III was mentioned as a mother of Ptolemy XI in a Demotic text, but the Egyptian word used to denote a \"son\" can also mean a step son, which is the meaning preferred by most scholars for the word in the text mentioning Berenice III as a mother of Ptolemy XI. Cleopatra Selene is the most suitable candidate; among several arguments in favor of Cleopatra Selene, Bennett noted that Berenice III was called by Cicero a sister of Ptolemy XI. If Ptolemy XI and Berenice III were both children of Cleopatra Selene, then the statement of Cicero can be taken literally. Cleopatra Selene's maternity of Ptolemy XI can not be confirmed, and which of Ptolemy X's wives bore Ptolemy XI remains unknown.\n\nIdentifying Antiochus X and Cleopatra Selene's children is problematic; Cicero wrote that the queen had two sons, one of them named Antiochus. More children, perhaps a daughter, might have resulted from the marriage, but it can not be confirmed; according to Plutarch, Tigranes II \"put to death the successors of Seleucus, and [carried] off their wives and daughters into captivity\". Thus, it is possible that Cleopatra Selene had a daughter captured by Tigranes II.\n\n\n\n\n"}

She is currently a professor at the School of Philosophy, Birkbeck, University of London. She is well known for her opposition to orthodoxy in current analytic philosophy of mind, and for her use of J. L. Austin's Speech Act Theory to look at the effects of pornography.\n\nHornsby earned her PhD from the University of Cambridge under the direction of Bernard Williams. She also earned a BA and MPhil from Oxford and London, respectively. She taught at the University of Oxford for 17 years before moving to Birkbeck College, London. She was president of the Aristotelian Society from 1996 to 1997.\n\nHornsby's work focuses primarily on the philosophies of mind, action, language, and feminist philosophy.\n\nHornsby's action theory is significantly influenced by the philosophy of Donald Davidson. In her book \"Actions\" (1980), she argues that actions are events occurring beneath the surface of the skin. The argument for this turns on an ambiguity in the slogan \"all actions are bodily movements\". The ambiguity stems from the fact that 'move' is one of a class of verbs that can occur either transitively or intransitively. Nominal expressions containing such verbs are therefore ambiguous: for example, 'the movement of the flag' can refer either to the action of someone's moving the flag or to the resultant movement of the flag. As we only ever answer a question about what someone did by using transitive verbs --- e.g. 'Jack moved his arm', not 'Jack's arm moved' (unless the latter is taken to imply that the former is true) --- the slogan \"all actions are bodily movements\" is only true if 'movement' is read transitively. This ambiguity noted, Hornsby then points out that if A V-s B, then A caused B to V ('' and '' serving to distinguish between transitive and intransitive uses of the relevant verbs). If Jack raised the flag, Jack caused the flag to rise. As causes and effects must be distinct, we must therefore also distinguish between Jack's raising his arm from Jack's arm's rising, the former causing the latter. So actions are bodily movements, which cause bodily movements. The final move is to claim that we know from physiology that the causes of bodily movements are events that occur beneath the surface of the skin. Therefore, actions occur beneath the surface of the skin.\n\nThis claim is combined with another: that the most basic description, in the causal sense of 'basic', of an action is as a trying. This arises from accepting a coarse-grained account of the individuation of events, according to which events are particulars that can be described in many different ways. The descriptions are distinguished by the effects of the described event in terms of which they are picked out. For example, the event of my slamming the door may be identical to the event of my waking the cat. The first description picks out the event by reference to the event of the door's being slammed. The second description picks out the event by reference to the event of the cat's waking. The question then is, Is there a description of the events which are actions that picks them out without reference to any effects? Hornsby's answer is that we can describe actions as tryings. I can try to raise my arm and, if successful, my arm will rise. (Note, though, that not all tryings are actions, only the successful ones.)\n\nHornsby is a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters. In July 2017, she was elected a Fellow of the British Academy (FBA), the United Kingdom's national academy for the humanities and social sciences.

Originally constructed in 1914 as New Athletic Field, it is the second-oldest stadium in the Football Bowl Subdivision behind Georgia Tech's Bobby Dodd Stadium, and the fourth oldest in all of college football behind Penn's Franklin Field, Harvard Stadium, and Bobby Dodd Stadium. As of 2016, it has a seating capacity of 61,337 people.\n\nThe stadium was built in 1914, as a replacement for Hardy Field, and was called New Athletic Field. The first game it hosted was a Mississippi State win over Marion (Ala.) Military Institute, 54-0, on Oct. 3, 1914. In 1920 the student body adopted a resolution to name the field Scott Field in honor of Donald Scott, an Olympic middle-distance runner and one of the University's football stars from 1915-16. Prior to the 2001 season the stadium was named Davis Wade Stadium in honor of longtime MSU supporter Floyd Davis Wade Sr., co-founder of Aflac, because of a large financial contribution he made toward stadium expansion. The playing surface retained the name Scott Field and the official name of the facility is \"Davis Wade Stadium at Scott Field\".\n\nIn 1928 permanent seating for 3,000 was built on the west side—the lower level of the current facility's west grandstand. In addition, there were portable stands with a similar capacity bringing the seating total to around 6,000. In 1936, with the use of WPA labor, concrete stands seating 8,000 people were added to the west sidelines and steel bleachers were built on the east sideline and end zones. This brought the total capacity to 20,000. 1948 saw the stadium enlarged once again with the expansion of the west sideline structure and the addition of 12,000 concrete seats and stands in both end zones to bring the total capacity to 35,000. In 1983, the end zone seating was removed, reducing the capacity to 32,000. A 1986 expansion costing $7.2 million, raised without state budget appropriations, added almost 9,000 seats, consisting primarily of a 5,500-seat upper deck as well as permanent lighting and a computerized scoreboard which was replaced in 1997 with a Sony JumboTron.

Seal, Sr., a 2-year letter winner at State, it is a meeting place for the letterman organization, the M-Club.\n\nIn 1999, the Turman Fieldhouse underwent numerous changes, including remodeled dressing rooms for both teams, and an all-new recruiting lounge, and the stadium began a $50 million expansion and renovation partially funded by Floyd Davis Wade, Sr.. The expansion was completed in 2002 bringing the total capacity to 55,082, including 50 skyboxes, 1,700 club-level seats and a second upper deck seating 7,000.\n\nIn the fall of 2008 construction was completed on an all-new $6.1 million wide by tall HD video display board in the south end zone above the Leo Seal M-Club Center. The LED video system is the tenth largest high-definition video board in college football. The new board was used for the first time on November 1, 2008, during the Mississippi State Bulldogs vs. Kentucky Wildcats football game. The main video display is complemented with two HD LED advertising boards on each side of the main board, as well as a HD LED \"ribbon ticker\" which spans the width of the structure below the main board. Therefore, the total video board square footage (on one structure) is . To complement the all-new video system, a new state-of-the-art sound system has been installed by Pro Sound, headquartered in Miami, Florida.\n\nA $75 million expansion, completed in August 2014, increased the capacity of the stadium to 61,337, created new concessions and restrooms, and created a new west side concourse. Part of the expansion included sealing off the north end zone and installing a large HD video board, similar to the one in the south end zone which replaced the JumboTron that was installed there in 1997.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2015663", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2015663", "title": "Walker (mobility)", "text": "Walker (mobility)\n\nA walker or walking frame is a tool for disabled people, who need additional support to maintain balance or stability while walking, most commonly due to age-related physical restrictions. In the United Kingdom, a common equivalent term for a walker is Zimmer frame, a genericised trademark from Zimmer Holdings, a major manufacturer of such devices and joint replacement parts.\n\nWalkers started appearing in the early 1950s. The first US patent was awarded in 1953 to William Cribbes Robb, of Stretford, UK, for a device called \"walking aid\", which had been filed with the British patent office in August 1949. Two variants with wheels were both awarded US patents in May 1957, and the first non-wheeled design that was called a \"walker\" was patented in 1965 by Elmer F. Ries of Cincinnati, Ohio. The first walker to resemble modern walkers was patented in 1970 by Alfred A. Smith of Van Nuys, California.\n\nThe basic design consists of a lightweight frame that is about waist high, approximately 12 inches (30 cm) deep and slightly wider than the user. Walkers are also available in other sizes such as pediatric (for children) or bariatric (for obese persons). Modern walkers are height adjustable and should be set at a height that is comfortable for the user, but will allow the user to maintain a slight bend in their arms. This bend is needed to allow for proper blood circulation through the arms as the walker is used. The front two legs of the walker may or may not have wheels attached, depending on the strength and abilities of the person using it. It is also common to see caster wheels or glides on the back legs of a walker with wheels on the front; additionally felt products adapted to glide with the legs such as adhesive feet, along with tennis balls with holes cut into them to place them onto the legs are also utilized on surfaces such as hardwood, epoxy and linoleum flooring common to institutions.\n\nThe person walks with the frame surrounding their front and sides and their hands provide additional support by holding on to the top of the sides of the frame. Traditionally, a walker is picked up and placed a short distance ahead of the user. The user then walks to it and repeats the process. With the use of wheels and glides, the user may push the walker ahead as opposed to picking it up. This makes for easier use of the walker, as it does not require the user to use their arms to lift the walker. This is beneficial for those with little arm strength.\n\nA walker is often used by those who are recuperating from leg or back injuries. It is also commonly used by persons having problems with walking or with mild balance problems.\n\nAlso related is a hemi-walker, a walker about half the size of a traditional walker which is intended for use by persons whose dexterity is limited or non-existent in one hand or arm. These walkers are more stable than a quad cane (a cane with four points that touch the ground, as opposed to one), but are not recommended as highly as a traditional walker for those who can use it.\n\nA walker cane hybrid was introduced in 2012 designed to bridge the gap between an assistive cane and a walker. The hybrid has two legs which provide lateral (side-to-side) support which a cane does not. It can be used with two hands in front of the user, similar to a walker, and provides an increased level of support compared with a cane. It can be adjusted for use with either one or two hands, at the front and at the side, as well as a stair climbing assistant. The hybrid is not designed to replace a walker which normally has four legs and provides four-way support using both hands.\n\nA different approach to the walker is the rollator, also called wheeled walker, invented by the Swede Aina Wifalk in 1978, herself a polio sufferer. Although originally a brand name, \"rollator\" has become a genericized trademark for wheeled walkers in many countries, and is also the most common type of walker in several European countries.\n\nThe rollator consists of a frame with three or four large wheels, handlebars and a built-in seat, which allows the user to stop and rest when needed. Rollators are also often equipped with a shopping basket. Rollators are typically more sophisticated than conventional walkers with wheels. They are adjustable in height and are light-weight, yet sturdier than conventional walkers. The handlebars are equipped with hand brakes that can be lifted or pushed downward to instantly stop the rollator. The brakes can also be used in maneuvering the rollator; by braking one side while turning the rollator towards that side a much tighter turning radius can be achieved.\n\nA study in the 2000s found an increase in the use of rollators by young people \"usually in their thirties who are setting a new standard for walking among young people\". The researchers conclude that this might be helpful in alleviating the stigma that using a rollator currently carries.\n\nA Norwegian-made version of Wifalk's rollator won the 2011 Red Dot Design Award in the \"Life science and medicine\" class.\nThe European norm for walking aids EN ISO 11199-2:2005 applies to rollators and walking frames.\n\nThis type of walker provides support and stability to the dogs, while allowing them to rely partly on their hind legs and continue using them.\nIt is suitable for dogs with mobility problems with hind legs (or unstable). It also helps them to exercise their back legs and can help maintaining any partial mobility they may have left or, in some cases, help to improve it.\n\nThe Zimmer frame was invented by Norman Metcalfe. It was aimed to help the disabled walk more easily. It is an improvement of the classic walking aids. Zimmer frames have two wheels in the front.\n\n\n"}

It contains roles for five male singers, but no females. The composer decided essentially to set the Pushkin text as written, and had Feodor Chaliapin in mind for the role of the Baron, however, Chaliapin withdrew from the production over artistic differences.\n\nThe first performance was on 24 January (11 January OS) 1906 at the Bolshoi Theatre, Moscow, with the composer himself conducting, in a double-bill performance with another Rachmaninoff opera written contemporaneously, \"Francesca da Rimini\". The director was Vasiliy Shkafer.\n\nProductions of the opera have been rare. In addition, the characterization of the moneylender, who is identified in the story as being Jewish, has been criticized as anti-Semitic.\n\nAlbert is a young knight who devotes himself to jousting and courtly pleasures, but is now deeply in debt as a result. His father, a very wealthy but equally frugal baron, refuses to support his son's lifestyle. Albert's ability to maneuver in society is now limited, and he tries to obtain a loan from outside his family. A money-lender denies Albert a loan, but instead offers Albert poison, to allow Albert to murder his father. Albert is appalled at such a suggestion. He resolves then to go to the Duke to make his appeal.\n\nThe Baron descends to his cellars, exultant now because he has accumulated enough gold to fill his sixth and final storage chest, and gloats before them. However, he realizes that if he died soon, his son Albert could then claim the fortune and fritter it away on his sensual pleasures. \n\nAlbert has appealed to the Duke for help in obtaining money from his father. Albert hides, as the Duke summons the Baron to a meeting. The Duke asks the Baron to support his son, but the Baron accuses Albert of wanting to steal from him. Albert then angrily reveals his presence and accuses his own father of lying. The Baron challenges Albert to a duel, and Albert accepts. The duke rebukes the father, and banishes the son from his court. However, stressed by this confrontation, the baron collapses fatally. As the Baron dies, his last request is not for his son, but the keys to his chests of gold.\n\nAudio\nVideo\n\n"}

The territory corresponds with the southeastern part of the present-day states of Lower Saxony, western Saxony-Anhalt and northern Thuringia. Together with Westphalia, central Angria and Nordalbingia it was one of the four main Saxon administrative regions. It should not be confused with East Westphalia (\"Ostwestfalen\").\n\nThe name \"Ostfalen\" probably means \"east plain\". \"Falen\" is a Germanic word meaning \"flat\", \"level\" and \"plain\" and is related to the Old Swedish word \"fala\", found today in place names such as Falbygden and Falun, as well as in the northern German town of Fallstedt. The North German Plain of Eastphalia and Westphalia, divided by the Weser river, stands in contrast to the hilly region to the south, the Central Uplands of Franconia and Thuringia. Unlike the name Westphalia, which was perpetuated by the Duchy of Westphalia held by the archbishop-electors of Cologne, the name Eastphalia gradually fell out of use when the Saxon stem duchy dissolved upon the deposition of Duke Henry the Lion in 1180.\n\nGerman linguists reintroduced the term in the 19th century in the course of researching the Eastphalian language as a West Low German dialect. With the rise of racial studies in the 19th and early 20th century, mention began to be made – notably by Hans F. K. Günther – of a \"Phalian\" subtype (\"fälische Rasse\") of an \"Aryan race\" according to the occult concept of Helena Blavatsky and her Ariosophic followers.\n\nWith Charlemagne's defeat and baptism of Duke Widukind in 785 during the Saxon Wars, his lands were integrated into the Frankish Empire and the Saxons were increasingly converted to Christianity. The bishoprics of Halberstadt and Hildesheim were established in eastern Saxony, bounded by the Oker river, in 804 and 815 respectively. The medieval Duchy of Saxony was divided between the districts of Eastphalia (\"Ostfalahi\"), Westphalia and Engern.\n\nThe Eastphalian territory at the Harz mountain range was the hereditary lands of Henry the Fowler, the first Saxon duke to become King of the Romans in 919, and his descendants of the Ottonian dynasty. They left several Romanesque abbeys and castles, a cultural landscape that today encompasses three World Heritage Sites with the medieval town of Goslar and Quedlinburg, as well as St. Mary's Cathedral and St. Michael's Church at Hildesheim. As the Eastphalian territory bordered on the lands of the Polabian Slavs beyond the Elbe and Saale rivers, it became the starting point of the German \"Ostsiedlung\", started by the invasions of King Henry and continued by the Saxon margraves.\n\nAfter the Welf duke Henry the Lion was placed under Imperial ban in 1180, Eastphalia was increasingly subdivided into smaller states, foremost the Welf Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg and the counties of Anhalt, Wernigerode and Blankenburg as well as the Imperial city of Goslar, but also the ecclesiastical territories of the Archbishopric of Magdeburg, the prince-bishoprics of Hildesheim and Halberstadt and Quedlinburg Abbey. The Saxon tradition was perpetuated by the Ascanian dukes of Saxe-Wittenberg, who secured for themselves the electoral dignity and later established the Electorate of Saxony on the upper Elbe.\n\nEastphalia consisted of several \"Gaue\". The exact list is not known for sure and differs among authorities. From North to South, the \"Gaue\" were (where available, modernized names are used): \n"}

The stadium currently has a capacity of 51,900 people, but is not an all-seater venue.\n\nVarious sports teams currently use the stadium as their home base, including:\n\nTenants Stormers finished in first place in the 2012 Super Rugby season for the first time in their history. Western Province also use the venue for home games. The city's soccer clubs Ajax Cape Town, Santos and the dissolved club Vasco da Gama have in the past occasionally hosted matches at the Newlands Stadium.\n\nThe decision to buy the ground the stadium stands on was made by the Western Province Rugby and Football Union in 1888. The first official match at Newlands took place on 31 May 1890 when Stellenbosch defeated Villagers there in front of a crowd of about 2,400 people. The following year the stadium hosted its first rugby test when the British Lions toured South Africa.\n\nIt was not until 1919 that the first permanent concrete stands were erected on the grounds. Later, in 1927, the new grandstand was erected and the field layout was changed to run from north–south. Yet more changes came in 1931 when the South stand was also enlarged.\n\nIn the 1950s parts of a new grandstand as well as South stand were completed, facilities such as lifts and a Presidential room were added, a fourth bay was added to the grandstand, and an extension was added to the lower gallery.\n\nThe 1970s saw the stadium change once again as the headquarters of SA Rugby moved to Newlands, and several stands were built or renovated, while the 1980s saw private suites and function rooms erected on top of the North stands as well as demolition of the old South stand and inauguration of the new Danie Craven stand (also with private suites and function rooms). The 1980s also saw 10,253 seats added to the stadium.\n\nBetween 1990 and 1995 the stadium was under constant renovation, adding technology, increasing capacity, and upgrading facilities, as part of a 3-phase redevelopment plan in anticipation of the 1995 Rugby World Cup, when Newlands hosted the opening match of the tournament.\n\nAfter the World Cup, development continued with several redevelopment and expansion projects to make the stadium more modern and increase capacity. Currently there are four main stands at Newlands: the all-seated Grandstand and Railway stands along both sidelines, and the Danie Craven and Jan Pickard stands behind the goals. Both of the end stands feature many of the ground's corporate boxes: the Craven stand also has a large standing terrace area, while the alcohol-free Pickard stand is mostly seating while also playing home to the stadium's video screen.\n\nThe stadium's name was changed several times by various sponsors, first from Newlands to Norwich Park Newlands in 1996, then to Fedsure Park Newlands in 2000 due to a merger between Fedsure and Norwich, and finally back to simply Newlands by Investec when they became the main sponsor in 2002. In late 2005, Vodacom became the stadium's main sponsor, but followed Investec's precedent and kept the stadium name as Newlands. However, since 2011 the ground has been known as DHL Newlands after Western Province and the Stormers changed sponsors.\n\nIn 1995 the stadium was one of the host venues for the Rugby World Cup held in South Africa. The stadium hosted two pool games in Pool A. The stadium also hosted one quarter final with England defeating Australia 25–22. The stadium was then used for the semi final between England and New Zealand, with England losing 29–45.\n\nIt was speculated that WP rugby would sell Newlands, and that the Stormers and Western Province would play their home matches at the newly built Cape Town Stadium for their home games. However, the Western Province Rugby Union have decided that they will not be using the stadium, but will rather remain at Newlands.\nThis changed in 2020 when it was confirmed that the stadium would be sold to Investec and demolished in 2021 for residential and retail developments to be built.\n\n"}

His father was a Captain in the border patrol of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. \n\nDue to his father's reassignments, the family moved frequently and his education was sporadic until he entered the Cadet School at Karlovac in 1874. After graduation, in 1882, he was assigned to the 78th Osijek infantry regiment under Baron Josip Šokčević. He moved up in the ranks quickly, becoming a full Lieutenant in 1886, but resigned the following year because he refused to help support Károly Khuen-Héderváry's policy of Magyarization.\n\nDespite having shown no particular aptitude for art, he enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna, where he studied with Julius Victor Berger. While there he received two gold medals, in 1889 and 1891, for scenes depicting ancient history. In 1891, he also enrolled in a special course in Orientalist painting taught by Leopold Müller.\n\nAfter Müller's death in 1892, he returned to Zagreb and participated in decorating the \"Pompeian Room\" at the local offices of the \"Department of Education and Religious Affairs\" (now occupied by the \"\"). His work there was supervised by the head of the department, Izidor Kršnjavi, who would become his patron and mentor. The first thing Kršnjavi did was send him on a study trip to Venice with Robert Frangeš-Mihanović and Ferdo Kovačević. This was followed by studies at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich with Wilhelm Lindenschmit. \n\nHe got married there, to his cousin Justine, then embarked on another study trip to Italy. This was followed by more studies in Munich, with Carl von Marr, after which he settled in Zagreb, joining the circle of painters who gathered around Vlaho Bukovac. His mentor, Kršnjavi, was not happy about that, believing that Bukovac was a bad influence. This led to a conflict that caused him to leave Zagreb, in 1895, taking a job as a drawing teacher in Ogulin. A year later, he was back in Zagreb, with his own studio and reconciled with Kršnjavi.\nIn 1902, he left Zagreb again; this time largely for economic reasons, and travelled to America with fellow painter Robert Auer. After a mostly unsuccessful year, he came back and opened a private art school, together with Menci Klement Crnčić. Four years later he, Crnčić, Auer, Frangeš-Mihanović, , Oton Iveković and Branko Šenoa would join together to help create the \"Royal College for Arts and Crafts\" (now the Academy of Fine Arts at the University of Zagreb).\n\nIn his later years he became increasingly withdrawn.

It has a capacity of 50,000. Despite its name, the stadium has never hosted an Olympic Games.\n\nConstruction on the National Sports Complex started in 1963 and was completed in 1964. Designer Vann Molyvann made use of massive earthworks to create the stadium, digging up 500,000 cubic meters of earth to shape the grounds.\n\nThe stadium might have been built to host the 1963 Southeast Asian Peninsular Games, but the games were cancelled due to political problems in Cambodia. There was also the short-lived GANEFO games, that were held in Phnom Penh, Cambodia in November 25~December 6, 1966 and were named 'First Asian GANEFO'. The stadium did play host to appearances by visiting dignitaries and state occasions, and was the home of Cambodia's national athletics teams.\n\nThe stadium played a small but integral part in the 1966 FIFA World Cup, when North Korea faced Australia in a qualifier as the two remaining Asia/Oceania zone teams: as North Korea lacked diplomatic relations with most countries and did not have a FIFA-standard venue at the time, while the Australian immigration laws in force meant the North Korean team would be unlikely to receive visas to enter the country, finding a suitable venue for the match proved difficult until Head of State Norodom Sihanouk, an ally of Kim Il-sung, informed FIFA the matches could be held in Phnom Penh.\n\nThe matches attracted 60,000 and 40,000 fans, with Sihounouk decreeing half would cheer for Australia, while the other half cheered the North Koreans. The matches were held on 21 November 1965 and on 24 November 1965, with North Korea winning both (6–1 and 3–1). Because all African teams had withdrawn to protest FIFA declining to allocate them a place in the final tournament, North Korea automatically qualified for the final tournament, where they reached the quarter-finals.\n\nAmong the facilities are Olympic-size pools for swimming and diving and an indoor volleyball court with a capacity of up to 8,000, now known as the Olympic Stadium Indoor Arena. The diving boards and swimming pools were restored in 2017 after years of disuse, and are now enjoyed daily by the general public.\n\nDuring the Khmer Rouge era, the stadium was used as an execution site where officials of the Khmer Republic formerly led by Lon Nol were killed.\n\nIn the decades following the Khmer Rouge era, the stadium facilities fell into disrepair. In 2000, the stadium complex was redeveloped by a Taiwanese firm, the Yuanta Group, which refurbished the stadium but also redeveloped parcels of the complex into condominiums and commercial properties.\n\nThe stadium has come to be a popular attraction for Phnom Penh residents, who attend daily exercise sessions, as well as football games and other activities.\n\nIn May 2007, the Irish singer Ronan Keating performed in concert in the stadium's Indoor Arena, the first concert by a major international act in Cambodia.\n\nIn November–December 2007, the World Organization Volleyball for Disabled held its world cup in the stadium's Indoor Arena, the first major international sporting event in Cambodia in more than 40 years. Cambodia, seeded fourth in the world, finished third.\n\nIn 2010, the stadium hosted all the football matches for the Cambodian Premier League, known for sponsorship purposes as the Metfone C-League.\n\nIn 2015, the stadium's grass pitch was replaced with artificial turf.\n\nThe 2023 Southeast Asian Games will not be held at the Olympic Stadium, but at a new stadium under construction in another part of Phnom Penh, to be known as the Morodok Techo National Sports Complex.\n\n"}

His opera \"Esmeralda\" (libretto by composer, based on Victor Hugo's \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\") was composed in 1839 (performed 1847), and his \"Rusalka\" was performed in 1856; but he had little success or recognition either at home or abroad, except in Belgium, until the 1860s, when he became the elder statesman, but not a member, of The Five.\n\nHis last opera, \"The Stone Guest\", is his most famous work, known as a pioneering effort in melodic recitative. With the orchestration and the end of the first scene left incomplete at his death, it was finished by César Cui and Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, and was much prized by The Five for what was perceived as its progressive approach to operatic expression. It was premiered in 1872, but never became a lasting standard operatic repertoire item.\n\nDargomyzhsky also left some unfinished opera projects, among them an attempted setting of Pushkin's \"Poltava\", from which a duet survives. Besides operas, his other compositions include numerous songs, piano pieces, and some orchestral works.\n\nHe died in Saint Petersburg in 1869, aged 55.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2015744", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2015744", "title": "Phra Lak Phra Ram", "text": "Phra Lak Phra Ram\n\nPhra Lak Phra Ram (ພຣະລັກພຣະຣາມ, pʰrāʔ lāk pʰrāʔ ráːm) is the national epic of the Lao people, and is adapted from Valmiki's Hindu epic, the \"Ramayana.\" Ramayana reached Laos much later than Cambodia and Thailand (Siam) which caused the loss of its original Hindu influence and affected local adaptation. Similar to some Malay versions of the \"Hikayat Seri Rama\", the epic has lost the association with Hinduism and is instead considered a Jataka Story, a previous lifetime of the Buddha. It is also very popular in some parts of Northeastern Thailand, or Isan, a region of Thailand populated by many Lao-speaking people and formerly part of Lanxang.\n\n\"Phra Lak Phra Ram\" is named after two principal characters, the brothers \"Phra Lak\", or Lakshaman, and \"Phra Ram\", or Rama. Since \"Phra Ram\" is considered the hero, it is believed the altered name was chosen for euphony. Veteran dance performers of Luang Prabang, however, say that \"Phra Lak\" comes first in deference to his voluntary assistance of \"Phra Ram,\" whose actions were obligatory to his kingship. Since it also considered a Jataka tale, it is referred to as \"Phra Ram Xadôk\" (ພຣະຣາມຊາດົກ, pʰrāʔ ráːm sáː dók). It was also called \"Rammakien\" (ຣາມມະກຽນ, Ráːm māʔ kian), but this the name for this other regional varieties in the \"Ramayana\" in general.\n\nLao legends attribute to the introduction of the \"Phra Ram Xadôk\" via the first king of Lane Xang, Chao Fa Ngoum, who arrived with his soldiers, artists, dancers, concubines, poets from musicians from Angkor who would have been familiar with the Reamker. Yet Indic civilizations knew of what is now Yunnan in China, as \"Gandhara\" no later than the second century B.C. Hindu culture, language and religion spread into that part of the world incident to the cultural achievements of the Sahavahanas (230 BC–AD 220.) Though definitive dates cannot be established for the gradual Tai inland migration from China, transmission of the epic likely occurred much sooner than the traditional date. Tai tribes definitely settled on the fringes of highly Indianized kingdoms of the Mon and Khmer culture, adopting much of Indic learning and knowledge. As those kingdoms receded, the Lao came to venerate the earlier Hindu temples, often decorated in Ramayana and the Mahabharata motifs, such as at Vat Phou in Champassak.\n\nEarlier versions remained somewhat similar to other versions, but by the 18th century, the versions are completely localised. Although Theravada Buddhism was known to the Mekong River Tai tribes as early as the 7th or 8th century B.C., it wasn't until the 14th or 15th centuries that a re-invigorated Theravada Buddhism supplanted earlier animist, Hindu, or Mahayana Buddhist loyalties. This would have also seen introduction of the Dasaratha Jataka, an ancient Buddhist crystallisation of the story. By the 18th century, the manuscripts are completely adapted to Lao culture and Theravada Buddhist religion.\n\nAlthough the Hindu nature of the \"Ramayana\" epic was lost in Laos, it was not completely erased. Indra, Shiva, and Brahma are present in the \"Phra Ram Xadôk.\" Lao culture has always been oral and visual, and oral tales were often codified into elaborate dance-dramas by the royal courts. Great influence in dance came from Khmer, Thai, and even Javanese culture, with a slight native flair. In \"khône\" and \"lakhone\" dance-dramas, the symbolism, costumes, and story are also more attuned to and influenced by Hindu Khmer, Thai, and even Javanese traditions.\n\nSome versions explicitly announce that it is a Jataka tale, while others are generally assumed to be so. Phra Lak and Phra Ram are the epitome of moral leadership, ethics, selflessness, and living true to dharma. Pha Ram is associated with a previous life of Siddartha Gautama, while his cousin Hapmanasouane (Ravanna) is often compared to Buddha's cousin \"Phra Thevathat\" or Buddha's final impasse to enlightenment, \"Phra Man\". The parallels include their religious knowledge and generally moral superiority but also their ruin by greed and desire. Hampanasouane as Mara, the personification of worldly desires who tried to tempt the Buddha during meditation, can be seen in both their searches for lust, power, and material gain. The cosmology and some elements are taken from the Tripitaka, such as the greater role of Indra vis-à-vis Shiva, and Indra asking riddles of religion and Buddhist thought to a young Hapmanasouane. Although important, religiously, it is subordinate to the greater and more chronologically recent Jataka tales of Phra Vet and the annals of the lifetime of Siddhartha Gautama.\n\nAnimistic elements are not as apparent in the \"Phra Lak Phra Ram\", but it is noteworthy to point out that the scenery takes place along the Mekong River. She is a great goddess and ancestral spirit that is as sacred and quintessentially 'theirs' as the Ganges is to India and a personification of water, bounty, and life. It was also the King of the Nagas that suggested Phra Ram's father move the capital from Maha Thani Si Pan Phao (modern-day Nong Khai, Thailand) across the bank to Chantaboury Sri Sattanak (modern-day Vientiane). Like most animistic elements, the Nāga is seen in both Buddhist and Hindu-influenced contexts, but worship of nagas predates Indian influence in the region, and are common in folktales of Laos and Isan. A unique version of the \"Phra Lak Phra Ram\", the \"Khwai Thoraphi\" focuses very much on Sankhip and Palichane's fight with the water buffalo. It was often read at temple, probably in Buddhism's attempt to replace Lao spirit propitiation ceremonies that involved water buffalo sacrifice.\n\nThe importance of \"Phra Lak Phra Ram\" to Lao culture can be seen in how ubiquitous it is. It is a mainstay of dance and drama, song, painting, sculpture, religious texts, and manuscripts. It is also seen in the more common arts, such as classical morlam, folklore, and village dances. Scenes from court dancers were performed on Lao New Year celebrations, and other Buddhist holidays. The texts are commonly read during sermons. And the tales themselves have been deeply interwoven into local folklore, myth, and legend. Sculpture, lacquerware, carvings, and paintings adorn temples and palaces. The chapters have been intricately crafted into song and dance and accompanying music. Through the Buddhist elements, Lao beliefs of morality and karma are re-affirmed. The first half of Lao versions also establish the mythology for the creation of the Lao polities, land features, and waterways, and it serves as a transmission of culture.\n\n\n\"Phra Ram\" (ພຣະຣາມ, pʰrāʔ ráːm) \n\"Phra Lak\" (ພຣະລັກ, pʰrāʔ lāk)\n\"Nang Sida\" (ນາງສີດາ, náːŋ sǐː daː)\n\"Thôtsakane\" or \"Hapmanasouane\" (ທົດສະກັນ, tʰōt sáʔ kan; ຮາບມະນາສວນ, hȃːp māʔ naː sŭaːn)\n\n\nDivine parentage makes these monkeys special. The more formal term for this class of humanoid simians is \"vanone\" (ວານອນ, váː nɔ́ːn). Because of this the male ones take the noble title \"Thao\" (ທ້າວ, tʰȃːo).\n\nDue to the fragile nature of organic matter in hot, humid weather, most of these texts have been mostly lost or destroyed. Nevertheless, several texts have been uncovered at Vat Phra Kèo in Vientiane, Vat Kang Tha in Ban Bo Ô, Ban Naxone Tay, Ban Hom, and Vat Nong Bon, in Laos; Roi Et in Thailand, now housed in Bangkok; and a manuscript of the Vientiane version in Phnom Penh. Of these, only Ban Hom and Ban Naxone Tay have complete versions preserved.\n\nOnly two modern printed editions exist. The most noted is Sachchidanda Sahai's version, mostly based on the Vat Phra Kèo version. It was printed in 1973 by the patronage of the Indian Embassy in Vientiane. Vietnamese scholar Vo Thu Tinh also published a 1972 version adapted from the manuscript of Vat Kang Tha, and is depicted at Vat Oup Muong in Vientiane. This version has been criticised for being too simplified.\n\nIn addition to the Phra Lak Phra Ram, other similar stories are known from Laos.\n\n- In a version of the Tai Lu people preserved in Louang Phrabang, Sita is born as Indra's wife Sujata, who is raped by Ravana and reborn as Ravana's daughter On Hi Slap.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2015774", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2015774", "title": "Twin Ring Motegi", "text": "Twin Ring Motegi\n\n The oval course is the only one of its kind in Japan, and currently is used only once a year for racing. It is a low-banked, 1.549-mile-long (2.493 km) egg-shaped course, with turns three and four being much tighter than turns one and two. On March 28, 1998, CART held the inaugural race at Twin Ring Motegi Speedway. The race was won by Mexican driver Adrián Fernández. CART continued racing at Twin Ring Motegi Speedway from 1998–2002. In 2003, Honda entered the Indy Racing League and the race became a part of the IRL schedule. In addition to Indycar racing, the track has also hosted a single NASCAR exhibition race in 1998.\n\nHonda, which had built the oval for the express purpose of developing its oval-racing program for Indy car racing, did not win a race at the track for its first six years of operation. In 2004, Dan Wheldon took the first win for Honda on the oval. In 2008, the Motegi oval gained additional publicity when Danica Patrick became the first woman to win an Indycar race, beating Hélio Castroneves for her first and only Indycar victory.\n\nThe 2011 season was the last season of Indycar in Motegi. It had been dropped from the calendar as organizers looked to maximize viewing audiences. The road course, rather than the super speedway, was used for the 2011 race due to damage to the oval track resulting from the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake.\n\n\"For race results, see Indy Japan 300\"\n\nThe track length is disputed by series that run at Twin Ring Motegi. The NASCAR timing and scoring use a length of . This length was used by CART in their races between 1998 and 2002, too. The IRL measured in 2003 a length of . This length was also used in the following races till 2010.\n\nMike Skinner won the only NASCAR Cup Series exhibition race held at the track in 1998, the Coca-Cola 500. Skinner won driving the No.31 Chevrolet for Richard Childress Racing. The race was most noted for being the first oval track NASCAR race in Japan as well as being the first in which Dale Earnhardt and his son, Dale Earnhardt Jr., competed with one another, driving No.3 and No.1 Coca-Cola Chevrolets, respectively. The track also held the NASCAR K&N Pro Series West in 1999 with Kevin Richards getting the win.\n\nThe road course is 4.8 kilometers long and is unique in sharing garage and grandstand facilities with the oval course, but being entirely separate otherwise. Although they are separate tracks, it is impossible for races to occur simultaneously on the two courses; to access the oval track, teams must cross the road course pit and front straight. The road course also runs in the opposite direction from the oval; clockwise, rather than counter-clockwise.\n\nThe course itself is built in a stop-start straight-hairpin style, which flows differently than many similarly-sized tracks. By Japanese standards the circuit is exceptionally flat, with only a slight elevation rise towards the hairpin turn. The road course is much busier than the oval track, with Formula Nippon visiting twice, Super GT and Super Taikyu cars once each, and local events almost every weekend. The road course can be used in three ways: the full course, or two \"short courses\" can be made, using connecting roadways. These short courses are usually used for junior formula events, such as Formula 4 and FJ1600.\n\nThe road course is also a popular motorcycle racing track, with the MotoGP usually visiting once a year, as well as several Japanese national bike racing series. It has hosted the Pacific motorcycle Grand Prix from 2000 to 2003 and the Japanese motorcycle Grand Prix since 2004.\n\nIn addition to the main racing complex, Twin Ring Motegi features a second road course (called the \"North Short Course\") for karting and Formula 4 events, as well as a 1/4 mile dirt track for modified and sprint car racing. In addition, the FIM Trials series visits the track every year for the world trials championship. Therefore, an outdoor trials course exists on the facility.\n\nOutside of racing, Twin Ring has the Honda Collection Hall, which features historic Honda racing and production cars and motorcycles, and Honda Fan Fun Lab, which features Honda's next generation technologies such as robotics, fuel-cell vehicles and aviation. Honda also operates a technology demonstration center on the site, as well as educational centers.\n\nIn 2009, a cafe opened which was named after the \"Gran Turismo\" video games.\n\nTwin Ring is a separate-but-combined road-and-oval track (as opposed to the \"roval\" tracks common in the United States), and the decision to include a full road course contained largely within the oval necessitated design compromises. For spectators, sightlines can be extremely poor for road course races, as the grandstands are much further back than usual. The oval course blocks the view of much of the road course, including the best passing point on the track , and several large-screen televisions are needed. Seating outside the grandstand is limited to areas of the infield and along the 750-metre backstraight of the road course.\n\nTrack access is a major concern, with only two entry and exit points by a two-lane public road. Motegi is not a particularly large town, and accommodation is virtually non-existent close to the track, except for the on-site hotel. Train links to the area are extremely limited (the major regional lines, JR East and Tobu Railway do not service the area), nor has a planned superhighway been completed. Thus the stated track capacity (about 65,000) is dictated largely by traffic flow, not by actual seating capacity (estimated to be nearly 100,000 for road-course events, 80,000 for the oval).\n\nIn 2011 Casey Stoner and Jorge Lorenzo proposed to boycott the MotoGP race out of fears for their health from radiation from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant even though all the independent scientific experts including the World Health Organization and Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency had stated that it is safe to live permanently 80 km or more from the plant. Motegi is more than 120 km from Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. In the end, all the teams showed up for the race.\n\nAs a large recently constructed Japanese circuit, Twin Ring Motegi has and continues to be utilised virtually in a large number of electronic video games, both in arcade machines and in PC and console games for home use.\n\n\n"}

He also studied at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, earning a doctorate in sacred theology in 1993.\n\nAfter completing his seminary studies in the American College of Louvain (Leuven), he was ordained to the presbyterate for the diocese of Honolulu at Saint John Vianney Church in Kailua on October 18, 1985 where he served as a parochial vicar. From 1987 until 1990 he served as an associate director for adult religious education/catechesis for the Diocese of Honolulu, with an office at Saint Stephen Diocesan Center. In 1989, he was appointed interim pastor for the topside parishes on the island of Molokai. He created one of the first clustered parishes by combining these communities into the Molokai Catholic Community, where he served until 1990. After his doctoral studies in Rome, he returned to Hawaii in 1993 to be appointed diocesan theologian and director of the diocesan lay ministry training program called Servant Leadership. He became founding executive director of the Hawaii Catholic Conference, the public policy arm of the Roman Catholic Church in the State of Hawaii, from 1994 until 1999. In 1998, Bishop Francis DiLorenzo appointed him as pastor of Sacred Heart Church and Maryknoll School in Punahou. This also included the Korean Catholic Community. In 1999 he was subsequently also appointed as pastor of Saint Pius X Church in Manoa. The two parishes were clustered and have since been called the Manoa-Punahou Catholic Community. Since his public policy days, Alexander has testified on legislation addressing homelessness, housing (including the rental housing trust fund), same-sex marriage, euthanasia/assisted suicide and domestic violence. As vicar general he led major initiatives in strategic planning (the first ever plan for the diocese won the 2008 American Planning Association Hawaii Chapter's Donald Wolbrink Chapter Achievement award), the diocesan capital campaign (which raised gifts and pledges over $57 million on a $30 million goal), and restructuring the central administration of the diocese. Bishop Clarence Silva appointed Father Alexander to the office of vicar general for the Diocese of Honolulu effective February 1, 2006. Bishop Silva appointed Father Alexander as his moderator of the curia, on May 5, 2006. Alexander has also served as vice-president and chief executive officer of The Augustine Educational Foundation. Alexander resigned as the Homeless Coordinator for the Hawaii Governor's Office in January 2012 due to an affair with a woman while he was an ordained Catholic Priest.\n\nhttp://www.snapnetwork.org/_caldwell_appoints_marc_alexander_to_lead_honolulu_housing_office_victims_respond\n\n\n"}

It is centered at approximately 19th Street and Baltimore Avenue, directly south of the Downtown Loop and north of Crown Center. It is the city's main art gallery district and center for the visual arts. Dozens of galleries are located in its renovated warehouses and industrial buildings. It is also home to numerous restaurants, housewares shops, architects, designers, an advertising agency, and other visual artists. The district also has several live music venues.\n\nNumerous buildings in the neighborhood are listed on the National Register of Historic Places, including the TWA Corporate Headquarters Building, Western Auto Building, and Firestone Building. There are two historic groups of buildings also on the Register—Working Class Hotels at 19th & Main Streets (Midwest Hotel, Monroe Hotel, and Rieger Hotel) and Crossroads Historic Freight District (industrial buildings clustered along the tracks north of Union Station).\n\nThe Crossroads district is also home to one of the county's largest remaining examples of a Film Row district. The Film Row district consists of 17 buildings. Following the demolition of a Film Row building, the Film Row district was placed on Missouri Preservation's 2013 list of \"watched properties.\"\n\nThe \"Kansas City Star\" and \"The Pitch\" maintain offices in the neighborhood, along with HOK and Barkley. The Belger Arts Center is also located in the district.\n\nArt galleries generally open new shows on the first Friday of each month from 6 to 9 pm. This has become one of the region's most popular regular events as thousands of people flock to the Crossroads for gallery \"open houses\" amidst the Crossroads's unique atmosphere.\n\nThere are more than 60 galleries in the Crossroads district, making it one of the five largest arts districts in the US.\n\nFirst held in late August 2005, the Crossroads Music Festival is an annual event organized by Spice of Life Productions, which features local music artists. The 2005 event was held at Grinder's Sculpture Park (CrossroadsKC) at 18th Street and Locust Street. In addition to concert performances, offerings include short films by local independent filmmakers and booths offering apparel by local designers, local independent print media, and carnival games.\n\nIn 2007, one of Kansas City's development agencies began a program to allow property tax abatements for art-related business who would otherwise be priced out of the neighborhood by fast-rising property values. Neighborhood leaders lobbied for the program to prevent the \"Soho Effect\" of gentrification. Tax abatements had been granted to developers to attract new residents to the neighborhood with high-end condominiums and lofts next to the galleries.\n\n\n"}

Although he wrote a range of works, he had his greatest success as a historical novelist, particularly with \"Eclipse of the Crescent Moon\" and \"Slave of the Huns\".\n\nGárdonyi was born in Agárdpuszta, Kingdom of Hungary, the son of a machinist on the estate of an aristocrat in Western Hungary. He graduated at a college for teachers and worked for some years as a teacher and Catholic cantor. He married Mária Molnár in 1885, but their marriage was unhappy and they separated in 1892.\n\nGárdonyi's career as a writer started off when he began writing for magazines and newspapers in the mid-1880s. His first successes were the satirical \"Göre Gábor\" letters on rural life, works which he later repudiated. Around the turn of the century, he started to tackle historical themes in writing, which resulted in a series of fine novels.\n\nHe moved to Eger (today's northern Hungary) in 1897 with his mother and lived there until his death. He is also buried there, with his tomb bearing the inscription \"Csak a teste\" (\"Only his body\"). The house where he lived and did most of his writing is now preserved as a museum.\n\nGárdonyi's most famous novel \"Egri csillagok\" was published in 1899. The title translates literally as \"Stars of Eger\", but it was published in English as \"Eclipse of the Crescent Moon\". It is set around a famous siege of the town of Eger in Hungary by the Ottomans in the year 1552. In 2005 this book was voted \"the most popular novel of Hungary\" by viewers of the television programme \"Big Read\" (\"A Nagy Könyv\").\n\nIn the opinion of some people his best work was \"A láthatatlan ember\", published in 1901. The title translates literally as \"The Invisible Man\", but it was published in English as \"Slave of the Huns\". It is set around the time of Attila the Hun.\n\nAlthough these two novels are very well known in Hungary, translations into English and other European languages only became widely published in the late 20th century.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2015799", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2015799", "title": "Telus Mobility", "text": "Telus Mobility\n\nTELUS Mobility is a division of Telus which sells wireless services in Canada on its numerous networks. It operates networks using HSPA+, and LTE on its mainstream networks. As of Q2 2019, Telus Mobility is Canada's third-largest cellphone provider with a subscriber base of 9.9 million\n\nSince 2008, Telus has operated a flanker brand named Koodo Mobile, which is targeted at high school, college and university students.\n\nIn 1983, AGT Mobility was formed by Alberta Government Telephones (the predecessor to Telus) to provide a 1G analogue mobile network for Alberta's natural resources industries. It was the first mobile phone network in Canada. Analogue services became available to the general public in 1986.\n\nIn 1992, AGT launched North America's first digital mobile network. Following the merger of Telus with BC Tel in 1999, Telus Mobility expanded its coverage to British Columbia. The company's website went online on October 14, 1999. The following year, Telus acquired Clearnet Communications and QuébecTel to expand its coverage to the central provinces. All these acquisitions, along with a tower-sharing agreement with then-primarily Eastern Canada based Bell Mobility, allowed Telus Mobility offer its CDMA network in all Canadian provinces. Bell and Telus continued their partnership for future network construction.\n\nIn 2007, Telus Mobility launched mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) Amp'd Mobile Canada, but replaced it in 2008 with Koodo Mobile\n\nIn February 2008, Telus Mobility discontinued its AMPS analog network, and launched its HSPA+ network in November 2009. Telus offered landlines to customers affected by the AMPS network's shutdown in rural areas, as digital signals are less reliable than analog ones in such areas. Following both events, Telus began a slow phasing out of CDMA devices, especially those that support both AMPS and CDMA technologies.\n\nIn February 2012, Telus launched its LTE network and it stopped selling CDMA devices, except those on clearance.\n\nIn 2013, Telus was approved by the Canadian government to purchase independent wireless carrier Public Mobile.\n\nOn August 8, 2014, Telus shut down Public Mobile's CDMA network after informing customers that they would need to buy phones compatible with Telus' network.\n\nOn March 31, 2015, Telus shut down its pager network.\n\nOn January 29, 2016, Telus shut down its Mike iDEN network.\n\nOn May 31, 2017, Telus shut down its CDMA network.\n\nTelus Mobility partners with Bell Mobility to operate three different kinds of nationwide networks in Canada. These networks include an HSPA+ network and an LTE network.\n\nOn November 5, 2009, Telus launched HSPA+ services the day after Bell launched the services on their network; much of the 3G infrastructure is shared between the two carriers. This network operates on the frequencies of 850/1900 MHz.\n\nTelus' single-channel 21 Mbit/s HSPA+ network is available to 97% of the Canadian population. About 70% of the Canadian population are located in Telus' 42 Mbit/s dual-channel coverage areas.\n\nTelus' HSPA+ network coverage is in portions of all Canadian provinces and territories, but it is not possible to drive in Canada between the Pacific coast and the Atlantic coast without going through areas without any cellular coverage, as there are gaps in cellular coverage in British Columbia and Ontario.\n\nLTE service for Telus launched on February 10, 2012 through a partnership with Bell. Telus advertises this network as having download speeds of up to 110 Mbit/s and its LTE Advanced network as having download speeds up to 225 Mbit/s.\n\nAs of August 2016, LTE coverage reaches most of Canada's population, but there are gaps in coverage in smaller communities and between communities, where TELUS' HSPA+ network is available, but its LTE network is not available. Steinbach, MB (population 13,500) is the largest Canadian community without LTE coverage from TELUS. Except near Canada's largest metropolitan areas, contiguous LTE coverage does not exist between communities.\n\nBell Mobility, which shares towers and coverage with Telus, intends to expand LTE coverage to 98% of the Canadian population by the end of 2016. As a consequence, Telus' coverage will similarly expand. In April 2015, Telus announced that all of its wireless sites in British Columbia and Alberta will be upgraded to LTE. According to Telus, as of March 31, 2016, it had LTE coverage available 97% of the Canadian population and LTE Advance coverage available to 50% of the Canadian population.\n\nIn May 2016, Telus announced that by the end of the year, it would expand its coverage to 99% of British Columbians and expand its LTE coverage to 98% of British Columbians, expand its LTE coverage to 99% of Albertans, and expand its LTE coverage to 99% of Ontarians.\n\nOn April 18, 2016, Telus launched Voice over LTE (VoLTE). VoLTE is supported throughout Canada, except in Saskatchewan and parts of Manitoba.\n\nTelus' product lineup mainly consists of smartphones but also includes a few feature phones. As of July 2017, smartphones are currently sold with one of operating systems preloaded: Android or iOS.\n\nTelus also sells several mobile broadband modems for use with its mobile broadband service. All modems currently sold support HSPA+ and LTE, and can connect to a personal computer via a Universal Serial Bus (USB) port, while some also provide Internet access to multiple devices via Wi-Fi and thus do not require a wired connection.\n\nIn many areas of Alberta and British Columbia, Telus offers an LTE/HSPA+ internet service for stationary use in homes or businesses in rural areas where wired service is unavailable. This service uses an LTE router which provides WIFI and LAN connectivity. The router can be purchased outright, or it can be paid for with 24 equal payments added to the bill over two years. The payments which would be over $11.00 are rounded down to $10 per month.\n\nTelus Mobility sells a variety of voice plans. These include a fixed number of minutes plus unlimited calling on weeknights, weekends and with up to four other Telus lines on the same account. Caller ID and a basic voicemail for up to three messages are also included as calling features, although airtime is charged for accessing the latter. All voice plans except for the least expensive one also allow the choice of one additional feature: double minutes, five favourite numbers or unlimited Canada-wide SMS/MMS messaging. For the five favourite numbers, unlimited calling is available in either local or Canada-wide options while messaging to these numbers is Canada-wide.\n\nPartners Skype and Telehop offer long distance services for Telus Mobility customers. The first service uses Voice over IP (VoIP) and requires a mobile broadband connection, while the latter uses traditional telephony through the dialing code No. 100. The Telehop service, which deducts minutes when used during weekdays, cannot be use for calls terminating in Canada or the United States.\n\nTelus offers several Internet-only and smartphone plans and add-ons for customers wishing to access mobile broadband. Only one plan can be added per device, and certain plans are only available for certain devices.\n\nTelus Mobility postpaid customers with a compatible smartphone can subscribe to Skype (and formerly also Rdio) and be billed for the service on their monthly bill. Use of either service on the Telus Mobility network requires a subscription to one of the provider's data plans or add-ons.\n\nIn 2007, Telus Mobility began selling in-house pay-per-download pornographic entertainment, including explicit pictures and videos, via its phones. Industry analysts described the action, the first by a North American wireless company, as a landmark move. However, the company later discontinued sales of such content in response to objections from religious groups.\n\nIn July 2008, Telus Mobility and Bell Mobility simultaneously introduced charges of 15¢ for every incoming text message received by all customers not subscribed to a text messaging plan. Critics were quick to point out that there is no way of blocking incoming message fees and suggested Telus and Bell were price fixing as both had announced the fees simultaneously. Both companies have been sued by frustrated consumers and subscribers, as they demand change in text charges. Many customers were frustrated because this fee also applies to existing customers with ongoing contracts. As of 2014, the only plans in which Telus and Bell charge per message (either outgoing or incoming) are pay-per-use prepaid plans. All monthly rate plans include at least unlimited text messaging to numbers within Canada. Additionally, in a 2014 press release Telus stated that charges elicited from unwanted spam text messages can be waived at the customer's request.\n\nFrom 2008 to 2011 inclusively, Telus Mobility sold pink BlackBerry phones where a portion of each sale would support breast cancer research. This included the BlackBerry Curve and the BlackBerry Pearl consumer models. In 2012, Telus introduced a new campaign entitled \"$25 for Free the Children\" to replace the breast cancer campaign. For every purchase of the Samsung Galaxy S III or the Samsung Galaxy Ace Q, TELUS will donate $25 to Free the Children, up to a maximum of $650,000. Both phones include a We Day-themed gel skin to fit the respective phone purchased.\n\nTelus Mobility has its own corporate retail stores and also allows third parties to become exclusive dealers. Best Buy, Walmart and selected Loblaws stores in Canada provide Telus products, prepaid and/or postpaid services.\n\nThe Loblaws PC Telecom mobile virtual network operator repackages a mix of Bell prepaid and Telus postpaid services; some stores also offer handsets and prepaid minutes under the original network banners.\n\n\n"}

Its most prestigious meeting is the Cheltenham Festival, held in March, which features several Grade I races including the Cheltenham Gold Cup, Champion Hurdle, Queen Mother Champion Chase, Ryanair Chase and the Stayers' Hurdle.\n\nThe racecourse has a scenic location in a natural amphitheatre, just below the escarpment of the Cotswold Hills at Cleeve Hill, with a capacity of 67,500 spectators. Cheltenham Racecourse railway station no longer connects to the national rail network, but is the southern terminus of the preserved Gloucestershire Warwickshire Railway.\nThe main racecourse has two separate courses alongside each other, the Old Course and the New Course. The New Course has a tricky downhill fence and a longer run-in for steeplechases than the Old Course. Hurdle races over two miles on the New Course also have a slight peculiarity in that most of the hurdles are jumped early on in the race with only two hurdles being jumped in the last seven furlongs. There is also a cross-country course which is laid out inside the main racecourse and is used for cross-country steeplechases.\n\nThe racecourse is the home of The Centaur, one of the largest auditoria in the South West of England. This multiple-use complex seats over 2,000 people for conferences and around 4,000 standing for concerts. It is also home to the Steeplechasing Hall of Fame. From 1999 to 2013, the racecourse was the venue for the annual Greenbelt festival and remains the venue for the Wychwood Music Festival. The University of Gloucestershire holds its graduation ceremony and summer ball at the racecourse.\n\nFrom 2008, the racecourse and The Jockey Club were in talks with Cheltenham Town F.C. about a possible move to the racecourse. This would have meant the building of a new stadium with a double-sided stand, one side in the stadium and the other for watching the races. In 2011, Cheltenham Town F.C. decided against the move for financial reasons.\n\nIn 2015, Cheltenham Racecourse opened the £45m 6,500-capacity Princess Royal Stand, which completed the redevelopment of the course.\n\n\n"}

He was also the leader of All Ethiopian Unity Party from 1996 to 2013. He died at age of 80 on October 6, 2016, while receiving treatment at a hospital in Bangkok, Thailand.\n\nHailu was born in Northern Shewa, Ethiopia. He attended elementary and high school in Addis Ababa at Dagmawi Minilik School. At the age of 18 he moved to the United States to pursue higher education and enrolled at Wayne State University. He did both his bachelor's and master's degree in Civil Engineering and returned to Ethiopia in 1960 soon after his graduation.\n\nHe was married to Almaz Zewde whom he met at his friend's wedding. They had six children together.\n\nAfter returning to Ethiopia, Hailu started his career as a research engineer at Abay Gorge by working with the team who has been studying about the gorge in a project funded by the US government. Following that he worked for 13 years in the different managerial positions at Shell international.\n\nIn 1973–1974 at the height of the Ethiopian student movement, Hailu was appointed as head of Ethiopian Transportation Authority and served for three years. Following the Somalia invasion on Ethiopia in 1977 he was called for national service and participated in designing an aircraft for the Ethiopian air force.\n\nAfter the Somali war was ended by Ethiopian victory, Hailu was appointed general manager of Ethiopian Sugar Corporation and managing director of Wonji Sugar Company and Metehara Sugar Company and then Minister for State Farms Development of Ethiopia. At the height of Qey Shibir or Red Terror Hailu spent his time squabbling and fighting with Derge officials in objection to their political and development policies.\n\nIn mid-1978, 24 hours away from being killed for helping an EPRP operative escape, Hailu left the country in exile to the United States. In 1983 Hailu formed a successful company, Shawel Consultancy inc, which is now run by his economist son Dr. Shawel Hailu. Until his return to Ethiopia to join politics He was general manager of Shawl Consultancy which conducted construction work in cooperation with international institutions such as UN, and African Development Bank.\n\nHailu Shawul joined politics by succeeding Professor Asrat Woldeyes as the head of the All-Amhara People's Organization (AAPO). However, some sources dispute his presidency and show that the AAPO's split into two factions - the All Ethiopian Unity Party (AEUP) and the United Ethiopian Democratic Party-Medhin - was due to Hailu Shawel not gaining the presidency and thus creating his own party. Many believe that the division was tactically mediated by the EPRDF government interference.\n\nLate in 2004, a year before 2005 general election, a series of negotiations started among Hailu shawel, Lidetu Ayalew, leader of Ethiopian Democratic Party, Berhanu Nega, the then leader of , and Chekol Getahun, the leader of Ethiopian Democratic League, which led to the formation of Coalition for Unity and Democracy. Hailu was elected leader of the CUD to challenge the ruling EPRDF party on 2005 general election.\n\nDuring 2005 Ethiopian general election, the CUD under Hailu's leadership was able to win 137 out of 138 seats of the Addis Ababa city council and 109 seats in the federal parliament. The result was disputed both by the ruling EPRDF and CUD. Following the dispute and alleged voting irregularities Observers from the European Union assessed that closing and counting processes negatively in almost half of urban polling stations, counting was slow, a remarkably high number of ballots were ruled invalid, and there was a lack of transparency in the results. The situation deteriorated further as the negotiation between EPRDF and CUD fall apart and finally on late October 2005, protest erupted across the country against the ruling party.\n\nAs a result of the protests, the government placed Hailu Shawul and other high-ranking leaders under house arrest for weeks. When the CUD held an initially peaceful protest the highly armed government security forces augmented the situation by using excessive force which turned it violent, leading to the deaths of more than 200 peaceful demonstrators in the capital alone and an unknown number in the countryside in October 2005. The government claimed the death of four police officers. Hailu Shawel and 23 other CUD leaders were arrested and imprisoned on charges of treason and genocide[Wenedesen S].\n\nWhile in imprisoned, on December 2005, Hailu Shawul with other CUD prisoners went on a hunger strike, which has aggravated his diabetes and threatens his vision. As a result of the hunger strike, Hailu Shawul has lost much of his sight, and gained access to medical care only after being visited by foreign diplomats.\n\nOn December 2007 the Federal Supreme Court of Ethiopia pardoned all twenty-four of the CUD members after they pleaded guilty and made public apologies; his fellow CUD member, Birtukan Mideksa, who was imprisoned and pardoned with him, claims that their pleas and apologies were coerced.\n\nAfter being freed from prison, Hailu Shawul traveled to America in January 2008 to get medical care for his diabetes. In mid-2013 he resigned from his tenure as leader of All Ethiopian Unity Party due to his deteriorating health condition.\n\nFrom 2014 to 2016 he spent his time abroad receiving medical treatment. On October 6, 2016, Hailu died while receiving treatment at a hospital in Bangkok, Thailand.\n\nWenedesen S.\n\n"}
{"id": "2015811", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2015811", "title": "Land Day", "text": "Land Day\n\nLand Day (, \"Yawm al-ʾArḍ\"; , \"Yom HaAdama\"), March 30, is a day of commemoration for Arab citizens of Israel and Palestinians of the events of that date in 1976 in Israel.\n\nIn 1976, in response to the Israeli government's announcement of a plan to expropriate thousands of dunams of land for state purposes, a general strike and marches were organized in Arab towns from the Galilee to the Negev. In the ensuing confrontations with the Israeli army and police, six unarmed Arab citizens were killed, about one hundred were wounded, and hundreds of others arrested.\n\nScholarship on the Israeli–Palestinian conflict recognizes Land Day as a pivotal event in the struggle over land and in the relationship of Arab citizens to the Israeli state and body politic. It is significant in that it was the first time since 1948 that Arabs in Israel organized a response to Israeli policies as a Palestinian national collective. An important annual day of commemoration in the Palestinian national political calendar ever since, it is marked not only by Arab citizens of Israel, but also by Palestinians all over the world.\n\nThe Arabs of Mandatory Palestine were a largely agrarian people, 75% of whom made their living off the land before the establishment of the Israeli state. After the Palestinian exodus and the effects of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, land continued to play an important role in the lives of the 156,000 Palestinian Arabs who remained inside what became the state of Israel, serving as the source of communal identity, honor, and purpose.\n\nThe Israeli government adopted in 1950 the Law of Return to facilitate Jewish immigration to Israel and the absorption of Jewish refugees. Israel's Absentees' Property Law of March 1950 transferred the property rights of absentee owners to a government-appointed Custodian of Absentee Property. It was also used to confiscate the lands of Arab citizens of Israel who \"are present inside the state, yet classified in law as 'absent'.\" The number of \"present-absentees\" or internally displaced Palestinians from among the 1.2 million Arab citizens of Israel is estimated (in 2001) to be 200,000, or some 20% of the total Palestinian Arab population in Israel. Salman Abu-Sitta estimates that between 1948 and 2003 more than of land was expropriated from Arab citizens of Israel (present-absentees and otherwise).\n\nAccording to Oren Yiftachel, public protest against state policies and practices from among the Arabs in Israel was rare prior to the mid-1970s, owing to a combination of factors including military rule over their localities, poverty, isolation, fragmentation, and their peripheral position in the new Israeli state. Those protests that did take place against land expropriations and the restrictions Arab citizens were subject to under military rule (1948–1966) are described by Shany Payes as \"sporadic\" and \"limited\", due to restrictions on rights to freedom of movement, expression and assembly characteristic of that period. While the political movement Al-Ard (\"The Land\") was active for about a decade, it was declared illegal in 1964, and the most notable antigovernment occasions otherwise were the May Day protests staged annually by the Communist party.\n\nThe government of Israel declared its intention to expropriate lands in the Galilee for official use, affecting some 20,000 dunams of land between the Arab villages of Sakhnin and Arraba, of which 6,300 dunams was Arab-owned. On March 11, 1976, the government published the expropriation plan.\n\nYiftachel writes that the land confiscations and expansion of Jewish settlements in the northern Galilee formed part of the government's continuing strategy aimed at the Judaization of the Galilee which itself constituted both a response to and catalyst for \"Palestinian resistance\", culminating in the events of Land Day. According to Nayef Hawatmeh, leader of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP), the land was to be used to construct \"[...] eight Jewish industrial villages, in implementation of the so-called Galilee Development Plan of 1975. In hailing this plan, the Ministry of Agriculture openly declared that its primary purpose was to alter the demographic nature of Galilee in order to create a Jewish majority in the area.\" Orly Helpern of \"The Jerusalem Post\" writes that the lands were confiscated by the government for security purposes, and that they were subsequently used to build a military training camp, as well as new Jewish settlements.\n\nYifat Holzman-Gazit places the 1976 announcement within the framework of a larger plan devised in 1975. Some 1900 dunams of privately owned Arab land were to be expropriated to expand the Jewish town of Carmiel. Additionally, the plan envisaged the establishment between 1977 and 1981 of 50 new Jewish settlements known as \"mitzpim\" (singular: \"mitzpe\") which would consist of fewer than 20 families each. The plan called for these to be located between clusters of Arab villages in the central Galilee affecting some 20,000 dunams (30% of which were to be expropriated from Arabs, 15% from Jews, with the remainder constituting state-owned land). David McDowall identifies the resumption of land seizures in the Galilee and the acceleration of land expropriations in the West Bank in the mid-1970s as the immediate catalyst for both the Land Day demonstration and similar demonstrations that were taking place contemporaneously in the West Bank. He writes: \"Nothing served to bring the two Palestinian communities together politically more than the question of land.\"\n\nThe government decision to confiscate the land was accompanied by the declaration of a curfew to be imposed on the villages of Sakhnin, Arraba, Deir Hanna, Tur'an, Tamra, and Kabul, effective from 5 p.m. on March 29, 1976. Local Arab leaders from the Rakah party, such as Tawfiq Ziad, who also served as the mayor of Nazareth, responded by calling for a day of general strikes and protests against the confiscation of lands to be held on March 30. On March 18 the heads of the local Arab councils, members of the Labour Party, met in Shefa-'Amr and voted against supporting the day of action. When news of the decision became public a demonstration developed outside the municipal buildings and was dispersed with tear gas. The government declared all demonstrations illegal and threatened to fire 'agitators', such as schoolteachers who encouraged their students to participate, from their jobs. The threats were not effective, however, and many teachers led their students out of the classrooms to join the general strike and marches that took place throughout the Arab towns in Israel, from the Galilee in the north to the Negev in south. Solidarity strikes were also held almost simultaneously in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and in most of the Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon.\n\nThe events of the day were unprecedented. According to the International Jewish Peace Union, \"To preempt incidents inside Israel on Land Day, about 4,000 policemen, including a helicopter-borne tactical unit and army units, were deployed in the Galilee [...]\" During the protests, four unarmed demonstrators were shot dead by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and two more by police. Nahla Abdo and Ronit Lentin write that three of the dead were women, and that, \"the army was allowed to drive armoured vehicles and tanks along the unpaved roads of various villages of the Galilee.\" About 100 Arabs were wounded and hundreds of others were arrested.\n\nThe \"New York Times\" reports that the killings were carried out by police during \"riots in the Galilee region to protest over Israeli expropriation of Arab land.\" In \"Arutz Sheva\", Ezra HaLevi writes that the riots started the night before, \"with Israeli-Arabs throwing rocks and firebombs at police and soldiers. The riots continued the next day and intensified, resulting in many wounded members of Israeli security forces and the death of the six Arab rioters.\" Yosef Goell, writing in \"The Jerusalem Post\", says that, \"What actually set off the rioting that led to the deaths was a wild attack by hundreds of inflamed young Arabs on an unsuspecting IDF convoy driving on the road by the villages of Sakhnin, Arrabe and Deir Hanna. There was no prior provocation on the part of that IDF convoy, unless one insists on seeing a provocation in the very presence of an Israeli army unit in the heart of Israeli Galilee.\"\n\nA 2003 Israeli government document notes that, \"Arab public figures tried to limit the protests, but lost control over the events. The protestors burnt tires, blocked roads, and threw rocks and molotov cocktails.\" Placing the six fatalities within the context of \"severe clashes\" between protestors and security forces, it is also noted that there were many injuries on both sides. Baruch Kimmerling and Joel S. Migdal write that Land Day differed from the Kafr Qasim massacre in that the Palestinians in Israel exhibited a \"[...] daring confidence and political awareness totally lacking in 1956; this time Arab citizens were not passive and submissive. Instead they initiated and coordinated political activity at the national level, responding to police brutality with their own violence.\"\n\nDuring the Land Day events, a new sense of national pride, together with anger toward the state and police and sorrow over the dead protesters, developed among the Arab community in Israel. A split erupted between the Arab political parties of Rakah and Abnaa al-Balad. Committed to a two-state solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, Rakah held major reservations about the involvement of Palestinians from the West Bank. Conversely, Abnaa al-Balad's commitment to the establishment a single democratic Palestine saw the issues of land, equality, the refugees and the occupation as \"a comprehensive, integral and indivisible whole.\" While Rakah remained committed to a two-state solution, it charted a delicate balance, expressing a Palestinian identity more clearly so as to be more in tune with community sentiment. For example, shortly after Land Day, Tawfiq Ziad declared that, \"From now on there will be no communities and religious groups but only a single Arab minority, part of the Palestinian nation.\"\n\nLand Day also resulted in the Arabs gaining a presence in Israeli politics in that they could no longer be ignored. Arab civil society in Israel began coordinating with one another more and protests against government policies became more frequent with a focus on three major issues: land and planning policies, socioeconomic conditions, and Palestinian national rights.\n\nThe protest did little to stop the 1975 land expropriation plan. The number of \"mitzpim\" established reached 26 in 1981 and 52 in 1988. These \"mitzpim\" and the \"development towns\" of Upper Nazareth, Ma'alot, Migdal Ha'emeq and Carmiel significantly altered the demographic composition of the Galilee. While Arabs had comprised 92% of the population of the Galilee in the years following Israel's establishment, by 1994, that number was reduced to 72% out of a regional population of 680,000, with Jews making up the remaining 28%. Large-scale expropriations of land in the Galilee have generally been avoided by Israeli governments since the 1980s.\n\nIsraeli media coverage of Land Day has been analyzed and critiqued by Israeli academics. Alina Koren's 1994 study of seven major Israeli newspapers found that coverage of the preparations and outcome of the day was extensive in March–April 1976, with reports relying almost entirely on statements from official Israeli information sources such as ministers, advisers or \"experts on Arabs.\" Hardly any space was devoted to the voices of Arab organizers and participants. All of the newspapers examined, whatever their ideological differences, minimized the causes, emphasizing instead two main themes: portraying the demonstrations as the work of a marginal and unrepresentative minority and describing them as a potential threat to state security and law and order. Daniel Bar-Tal and Yona Teichman write: \"Of special importance is the finding that all the newspapers delegitimized the participants, as communists, nationalists, extremists, agitators, inciters, enemies or violent people.\"\n\nBar-Tal and Teichman also cite a 2000 study by professors Gadi Wolfsfeld, Eli Avraham and Issam Aburaiya that analyzed coverage by \"Haaretz\" and \"Yediot Aharonot\" of the annual commemorations between 1977 and 1997 and found that reports prior to the event each year also relied heavily on news items from the police and military sources. The focus was on security preparations, with reports on Arabs limited to the agitation and incitement put forward by their leadership. Information on the reasons for the protest was provided in between 6% to 7% of the stories published. Almost all of the reporters were Jewish, and only Haaretz had a reporter specially assigned to cover the Arab population. The event was framed within the context of the Arab–Israeli conflict with Arab demonstrators defined as enemies, rather than citizens making demands of their government. A March 22, 1997 editorial in \"Yediot Ahronoth\" for example read: \"The right to protest does not include the right to run riot, to close roads, to throw stones at passing vehicles. ... Again, it has to be made clear to Israeli Arabs that most of their Israeliness is based on their loyalty that they owe to their country and its laws. If they don't want these laws no one is preventing them from leaving.\"\n\nFor Palestinians, Land Day has since become a day of commemoration and tribute to those who have fallen in the struggle to hold onto their land and identity. Often serving as a day for the expression of political discontent for Arab citizens of Israel, particularly surrounding issues of equal land and citizenship rights, in 1988, they declared that Land Day should serve as \"a Palestinian-Israeli civil national day of commemoration and a day of identification with Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza, to be marked by yearly demonstrations and general strikes.\"\n\nNot only did Land Day work to forge political solidarity among Arab citizens of Israel, but it also worked \"[...] in cementing the acceptance of the \"1948 Arabs\" back into the larger Palestinian world and into the heart of mainstream Palestinian nationalism.\" The day is commemorated annually by Palestinians in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, East Jerusalem, and further afield in refugee camps and among the Palestinian diaspora worldwide. In 2007, the Press Center of the Palestinian National Authority described it \"...as a remarkable day in the history of the Palestinian people's struggle, as the Palestinians in such a particular day embrace the land of their ancestors, their identity and their existence.\" However, in recent years, many observers have noted that the Arab population inside Israel seems less enthusiastic about the protests, despite the organizers' efforts to promote hype. Many see this as a sign of growing reconciliation on the grass-roots level.\n\nAn Israeli judiciary study reports that the general strike and marches carried out in Israel during the annual commemoration of 2000 generally proceeded peacefully, with the exception of the protest in Sakhnin. There, hundreds of youth gathered and moved towards the Israeli military base adjacent to the village to the west. Uprooting the fences, they penetrated the base, and waved the Palestinian flag inside. Arab public figures who were there to make speeches attempted to subdue them, but were met with hostility and even beatings. Border police forces who arrived to reinforce the base were stoned by the protestors, some of whom were wearing masks and set fires in the woods. Tear gas and rubber bullets were used to push the protestors back towards the main road where clashes continued. Muhammad Zidan, Head of the Arab Higher Followup Committee, was among those wounded in the clashes, and a 72-year-old woman from Sakhnin was reported to have died in the hospital after injuries sustained from tear gas inhalation. A 2006 report in \"The Jerusalem Post\" states that in annual commemorations of the day by Arab citizens today, Israeli security forces are on alert but do not interfere in the protests.\n\nDuring the Second Intifada in 2001, on the 25th anniversary of Land Day, which fell on a Friday, the weekly \"Day of Rage\", Palestinians were called upon to demonstrate. Tens of thousands of Arab citizens, joined by some Jews, demonstrated in peaceful marches inside Israel, carrying Palestinian flags. During demonstrations in the West Bank, four Palestinians were killed and 36 wounded in Nablus when Israeli forces used live ammunition against protesters throwing stones and molotov cocktails. In Ramallah, one Palestinian was shot dead and 11 others injured when soldiers clashed with 2,000 demonstrators who burned pictures of Ariel Sharon and waved Iraqi and Palestinian flags; Palestinian gunmen also joined the clashes after an hour, drawing heavy Israeli fire from tank-mounted machine guns. There were also demonstrations in the Gaza Strip and in the Palestinian refugee camp of Ain al-Hilweh in Lebanon.\n\nIn the Land Day demonstrations of 2002, Arab citizens of Israel expressed their solidarity with Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, speaking out against the \"Israeli siege of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's headquarters.\" The 2005 Land Day commemorations were dedicated to the plight of the unrecognized villages in the Negev, where organizers said 80,000 Arab citizens live without access to basic amenities and 30,000 homes have received demolition orders. Marches in 2008 included one organized in Jaffa where 1,000 Arab citizens used the Land Day commemorations to bring attention to what they described as an acceleration in land confiscations in the city, with many complaining that they were facing evictions and demolition orders designed to force them out of their homes in order to settle Jews from abroad in their place.\n\nCalls to launch non-violent resistance actions to protest against ongoing land confiscations regularly occur on Land Day. For example, the BADIL Resource Center for Palestinian Residency and Refugee Rights issued a press release for Land Day 2006, calling for \"boycott, divestment, and sanctions against Israel\" and an end to \"racial discrimination, occupation, and colonization.\" During the commemorations for Land Day in 2009, a group of 50 Palestinian women singing Palestinian nationalist songs by Marcel Khleifi and some internationals gathered at the Damascus Gate of the Old City of Jerusalem, to hand out posters and T-shirts calling for a boycott of Israeli products.\n\nAlso in 2009, thousands of Arab citizens, some carrying Palestinian flags, marched through the towns of Arrabe and Sakhnin, under the banner, \"We are all united under Israeli fascism and racism.\" Arab Knesset member Talab el-Sana called upon the government, \"to put a stop to the racist plans of Judaizing the Galilee and Negev and adopt development policies for all the Galilee and Negev's residents\". Ynet reported that protests by Palestinians were planned in locations worldwide, including the US, Canada, Germany, Finland, France and Belgium, and that the World Social Forum (WSF) announced the launching of a campaign calling on all of its affiliates to excommunicate Israel. Land Day was also commemorated in Sabra and the Shatila refugee camp via an art exhibition and musical event, and in the Palestinian territories, where Palestinians demonstrated and threw stones near the Israeli West Bank barrier in Naalin and Jayyous.\n\nIn anticipation of Land Day protests of 2012, Israel sealed off the West Bank (but the restrictions did not apply to Israeli settlers). The protests were held in Gaza Strip and the West Bank. In the Gaza Strip, Israeli forces fired at protestors who tried to cross the security fence, resulting in one man killed and 37 injured. At the Qalandia checkpoint, rock-throwing Palestinian youths clashed with Israeli soldiers firing rubber bullets and stun grenades, resulting in 39 Palestinians being injured. In Jordan, 15,000 people, including Palestinians joined in a peaceful sit-in. Palestinian refugees also held demonstrations near Beaufort Castle, Lebanon.\n\nDuring the 2018 Land Day protests, 17 Palestinians were killed, including five Hamas members, and more than 1,400 were injured in shootings by the Israeli army during a march calling for the Palestinian right of return at the borders with Gaza.\n\n\n"}

To be sure, many human beings have conducted their ante-mortem lives in such a way as to become anti-social persons. Almost none of us dies with all the virtues needed to be fit for heaven. Traditional doctrines of hell suppose that God lacks the will or the patience or the resourcefulness to civilize each and all of us, to rear each and all of us up into the household of God.

He met his future wife, Miep Gies, in 1933 when he was a bookkeeper and she an office worker at a local textile company. It was not until after they'd gone their separate ways - Jan into the Dutch Social Services and Miep to Otto Frank's company, Opekta - that they met each other again socially in 1936. They married in Amsterdam on 16 July 1941, when Miep was threatened with deportation back to Vienna after she refused to join a Nazi women's group. Their wedding was attended by Otto and Anne Frank, Hermann van Pels and his wife Auguste van Pels, and Miep's colleagues Victor Kugler, Bep Voskuijl, and Johannes Kleiman. Later that year, Gies was appointed the nominal director of Otto Frank's company after Frank was forced to resign from the board under the newly introduced Nazi laws which forbade Jews to hold directorships, and from then on, the company traded under the name Gies & Co.\n\nAs the persecution of Amsterdam's Jewish population intensified, he dedicated himself to assisting Jews and others escape by obtaining illegal ration cards for food, finding them hiding places, and securing British newspapers free from Nazi propaganda. Gies aided the Frank family's escape to their hiding place at the Gies & Co premises at 263 Prinsengracht. He visited frequently during their two-year confinement and with his wife, spent a night in the secret annex to experience the terror there for themselves.\n\nIn addition to their concealment of the Frank and van Pels families and of Fritz Pfeffer at the Prinsengracht, Miep and Jan also took in a student, who had refused to sign a Nazi oath. Following the arrest and deportation of the hidden families in August 1944, Miep rescued the diaries and other manuscripts of Anne Frank from the hiding place before it was ransacked by the Dutch secret police. Of the eight people she and Jan had assisted to hide, Otto Frank was the sole survivor. Upon Frank's return to Amsterdam in June 1945, he moved in with them and stayed with them for seven years before he emigrated to Switzerland to be close to his mother.\n\nAfter the publication of Anne Frank's diary, under the title \"Het Achterhuis\" (\"The Backhouse\"; often translated as \"The Secret Annex\") in 1947, Jan and Miep found themselves the subjects of media attention, particularly after the diary was translated into English as \"The Diary of a Young Girl\" and adapted for the stage and screen. They attended memorial ceremonies and gave lectures about Anne Frank and the importance of resisting fascism.\n\nIn 1993, Jan Gies died peacefully at home from diabetes, aged 87. He was survived by his wife, Hermine \"Miep\" Gies, who died at the age of 100 in 2010 and his son, Paul Gies, who was born in 1950, daughter-in-law Lucie, and three grandchildren, Erwin, Jeanine, and David.\n\n\n Jan Gies - Find A Grave\n"}
{"id": "2015833", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2015833", "title": "Samba school", "text": "Samba school\n\nA samba school () is a dancing, marching, and drumming (Samba Enredo) club. They practice and often perform in a huge square-compounds (\"quadras de samba\") and are devoted to practicing and exhibiting samba, an African-Brazilian dance and drumming style. Although the word \"school\" is in the name, samba schools do not offer instruction. Samba schools have a strong community basis and are traditionally associated with a particular neighborhood. They are often seen to affirm the cultural validity of the Afro-Brazilian heritage in contrast to the mainstream education system, and have evolved often in contrast to authoritarian development. The phrase \"escola de samba\" is popularly held to derive from the schoolyard location of the first group's early rehearsals. In Rio de Janeiro especially, they are mostly associated with poor neighborhoods (\"favelas\"). Samba and the samba school can be deeply interwoven with the daily lives of the shanty-town dwellers. Throughout the year the samba schools have various happenings and events, most important of which are rehearsals for the main event which is the yearly carnival parade. Each of the main schools spend many months each year designing the theme, holding a competition for their song, building the floats and rehearsing. It is overseen by a \"carnavalesco\" or carnival director. From 2005, some fourteen of the top samba schools in Rio have used a specially designed warehouse complex, the size of ten football pitches, called Samba City (Cidade do Samba) to build and house the elaborate floats. Each school's parade may consist of about 3,000 performers or more, and the preparations, especially producing the many different costumes, provide work for thousands of the poorest in Brazilian society. The resulting competition is a major economic and media event, with tens of thousands in the live audience and screened live to millions across South America.\n\nThe formal parades (\"desfiles\") during carnival, are a showcase of each main \"escola\" enhanced by the participation of celebrities, fans and guests who often pay large sums of money for their elaborate costumes. In Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo and Porto Alegre, the formal parades are held in specially constructed arenas called Sambadromes (Sambadrome Marquês de Sapucaí in Rio, the Anhembi Sambadrome in São Paulo) designed by influential architect, Oscar Niemeyer, the Sambadromo Complexo Cultural Porto Seco in Porto Alegre and the Sambadromo de Uruguaiana in Uruguaiana where \"escolar de samba\" from Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina participate. Sambadromes are designed to accommodate all social classes, with VIP lounges, tourist sections, and various types of seating right down to cheapest seats for poorest sections of the community. Those who choose to only watch the parade may also be charged for the best seats.\n\nEach school displays glamour in colorful costumes and floats with special effects and is organized into different segments or \"alas\" (\"wings\"). The \"alas\" represent different components of the school's theme, or \"enredo\", as they act out a homage to a myth, historic event or figure, or express their view on a social, environmental, or international issue. The \"alas\" display distinct costumes or \"fantasias\" and also reflect traditional samba school roles developed years ago. Thus, each samba school parade has the \"comissão de frente\"; individuals who open the parade by walking in social attires, saluting the crowds; the \"ala das Baianas\", or the traditional segment of Bahian African-Brazilian ladies with impressive round dresses spinning through the avenue; the \"puxadores\" (lead singers) singing the \"samba-enredo\" or theme-song while they play the \"cavaquinho\" or other string instruments; the \"velha guarda\", or veterans who made history in the school; the \"bateria\", or samba band with drums, \"cuicas\" and other instruments, preceded by the \"madrinha da bateria\", or band godmother who is often a sexy female celebrity. The \"porta-bandeira\", or the female flag holder, and the \"mestre-sala\", or male cortsy, display and honor the school's flag, as they dance and strive to show harmony and samba expertise, while their performance is carefully observed and scored by the judges.\n\n\"Cariocas\", the Rio natives, and \"Paulistanos\", São Paulo natives, are overtaken with emotion while performing or watching their favorite school, much more so in Rio, where a carnival samba school culture has been developed since the 1930s and samba rehearsals, costume making, and planning is a year-round event. It is often said that a samba school slum dweller may not have a job or food on the table the whole year, but they will make sure they have the money for their costume to show their \"samba no pe'\" or dancing skills expertise.\nAs samba schools originated in Rio de Janeiro, they are today the most famous ones and, arguably, produce the most spectacular parades or (as it is often said) the \"greatest show on Earth\". The city of São Paulo also has a number of samba schools with some tradition that is linked to an interesting mixture of African-Brazilian display of pride, immigrant or working class activism, and soccer team fondness, as schools such as \"Gaviões da Fiel\", \"Mancha Verde\" began as a singing/dancing group that cheered and rooted during matches in São Paulo stadiums. Nearly all Brazilian states have samba schools, but states such as Bahia and Pernambuco tend to have floats that lead a crowd composed of general people, without the need for membership, rehearsals, or even a special attire. Some groups do charge a certain amount of money for the \"abadás\", or colorful T-shirts that display affiliation to a specific group, or \"bloco\".\n\nA significant majority of the samba schools, mainly in Rio de Janeiro, have in their name the words \"Grêmio Recreativo Escola de Samba\" (Recreative Guild Samba School), represented by the acronym GRES, before the name itself. In São Paulo there is a common variation \"Grêmio Recreativo Cultural e Escola de Samba\" (Recreative Cultural Guild and Samba School). There are exceptions, such as the \"Sociedade Rosas de Ouro\" (Golden Rose Society) and the traditional \"Agremiação Recreativa Cultural e Escola de Samba Vizinha Faladeira\" (\"grêmio\" and \"agremiação\" in Portuguese are synonyms). The standardization of the classifications of entities emerged in 1935 when the Rio carnival associations were required to take a charter to the \"Delegacia de Costumes e Diversões\" (Delegation of Customs and Entertainment) to be able to parade. In an effort to show a modicum of decency and organization, the delegate owner, Dulcídio Gonçalves, refused to grant the permit to associations with \"inappropriate\" names, which is why the GRES Portela had to change to the current name, instead of the previous \"Vai Como Pode\" (Come as You Will).\n\nThe samba school system seems to be unique to Brazil. Unlike parades such as the Rose Parade in California, for instance, the samba schools' organizations consist almost entirely of community volunteer work. More than just musical groups, the schools are the neighborhood associations that cover a variety of community needs, such as educational resources and medical care. There are often political and commercial interests involved as well, even from abroad, especially when the samba school honors the literature, music and dance, or a myth, historic figure or event from another country. Drug lords who control trafficking in the Rio favelas as well as illicit gambling (Jogo do Bicho) are also said to contribute financially to schools, as many of them are guardians and controllers of shanty town life.\n\nThe origins of samba schools are linked to the history of carnival in Rio itself, as well as the creation of the modern samba. The first parades, or \"cortumes\", as Luso-Brazilians called them, were more exclusive events and used to have white revelers, rather than mostly African-Brazilians like nowadays. The rhythms were often the \"marchinhas\", with a more Portuguese or European flair. Samba players from a group called Estácio were the pioneers of present-day samba schools, with the founding of \"Deixa Falar\", or Let Me Speak in 1928. Ismael Silva seems to have been the first to have come up with idea of creating \"blocos de Carnaval\" in which groups could dance and move to the samba rhythms and sounds.\n\nThe first samba school contests began in 1928 and were held at the home of Zé Espinguela, where his Conjunto Oswaldo Cruz won and Mangueira and Deixa Falar also competed for the title. Some consider this as the starting point leading to the development of present-day samba schools.\n\nHowever, between 1930 and 1932, these were only considered a variation of the \"blocos\", local street parade celebration, and in 1932 the owner of Mundo Sportivo, Mário Filho, decided to sponsor the first Parade of Samba Schools in Praça Onze. Composers such as Antônio Nassar, Armando Reis and Orestes Barbosa) had the idea of organizing a Carnival parade which was supported by local newspapers. Newspaper owners and journalists such as Mário Filho and his brother Nélson Rodrigues, who did not have much to write about after the end of the soccer season, joined journalist Carlos Pimentel, who was connected to samba personalities in holding a parade at Praca XI square.\n\nAt the invitation of \"Sports World\", 19 schools attended. The newspaper established the criteria for judging the participating schools and nowadays news networks still have some say on the parades as they strive for fairness and high quality, especially because so much money is invested on TV networks that have broadcasting rights for the parades. Newspapers and magazines also make huge profitsl. The traditional \"ala das Baianas\" was a prerequisite to compete, and the schools, all with more than one hundred members, should present sambas unpublished and not use pipe instruments, among other requirements.\n\nThe winning school was Mangueira, while the second group had the \"Conjunto Osvaldo Cruz\", or Portela. The officials assured the success of the contest remained up in Praca XI Square in 1941. Over time, the samba schools took many elements brought by ranches, such as the plot, the pair of mestre-sala cortsy and flag holder and the opening committee, elements with which Ismael Silva disagreed.\nWith the rise of populist dictator Getúlio Vargas and the foundation of the General Union of Samba Schools in 1934, the marginalization of samba persisted for some time. Then, it regained power and began to expand and gain importance in the Rio carnival, supplanting the ranches carnival. It did not take long for the samba schools to expand to other states, with the foundation in 1935 of the \"Primeira São Paulo\" (First of São Paulo), the first school of samba de São Paulo. The official competitions of the samba schools in São Paulo only started in 1950 with the victory of Lavapés, but before that there were other minor tournaments at the municipal and state levels. In the early 1960s some organized soccer support fan groups, like the Vai-Vai (Go-Go) and the Camisa Verde e Branco (Green and White Jersey) became samba schools.\n\nDue to the large number of schools, in 1952, the access league \"Grupo de Acesso\" was created in order to allow news schools in and promote them to the \"premier league\" only if they aboded by certain rules of excellence. That year, the parade of the access league (Group 2, current Group RJ-1) went seamlessly, but the parade of the main group (Group 1, currently the Special Group) was carried out under heavy rain. The judging results were canceled and all schools belonging to the access league were promoted to the \"premier league\".\n\nIn 1953 UGESB and FBES in AESCRJ, merged as LIESA, an association of samba schools from the premier league which became known in Portuguese as Grupo Especial. In 2008, LESGA was created, representing schools from the access league. LIESA inspired the creation of similar bodies in other cities, such as LIGA-SP.\n\nIn 1984, Rio de Janeiro governor Leonel Brizola dedicated the Sambadrome, a special space for the parading of samba schools. Years later, in São Paulo, Mayor Luiza Erundina did the same, creating the Anhembi Sambadrome.\n\nToday, many other cities throughout the country also have their Sambadromes, including Manaus and in 1993 its parade was broadcast for the first time.\n\nNatural associations are almost always local, largely from poor communities or the suburbs, forming samba schools that usually represent in a district, sub-district or set of districts. A parade which usually has local character, whereas the main schools of the city gather to compete among themselves for the best of the year. In this show, conducted over two nights, they are evaluated by a committee of judges chosen in advance by their leaders or by the representative.\n\nThe judges consider each of the judging categories, giving points to each. On the day that the results are announced, the final assessment of the panel can be affected by certain penalties for breaking certain rules, such as the requirement to parade within specific time limits, parading with the minimum components, and avoiding total nudity.\n\nIn major cities, the parade of each samba school currently takes about an hour, with some variations according to the rules imposed by the organization of the carnival in the city. For each of the Special Group in the city of Rio de Janeiro, the parade has a maximum time of one hour and twenty minutes, while in São Paulo is the maximum of 1 hour and five minutes. Along the parade ground, stop watches mark the period of time.\n\nThis is the time and place occupied by the schools while waiting their turn to enter the parade in the Sambadrome.\n\nAfter the end of a parade, the narrator announces the school next to perform, and the sounds from the microphone, restricted to only a part of sambadrome, are released so that people can hear in the bleachers. Then the opening cries are heard, after which the parade itself begins, and the timer starts to run.\n\nSeveral elements are part of the characterization of a parade of the samba school, and some areas to which the jury should assign notes. Others, like the wing of Bahia, however, are not considered as items, but can cause loss of points for the body anyway, if not shown.\n\nThis is the first group of parade participants to perform, and consists of about ten to fifteen people who execute a choreography to introduce the theme. Apart from the Front Commission, there is no other rule regarding the order of the elements during the parade of samba schools.\n\nFunctioning as a sort of master of ceremonies of the show by welcoming the public and presenting the school, the front commission of the samba schools has undergone many changes over time. In its early years, it was formed by a group of men, the general directors of the college, who came in front of the school wearing their best clothes and welcomed the public. Sometimes they carried sticks in their hands, whose prime objective was \"to defend the group against rivals\".\n\nThe Portela samba school developed a more refined front commission, where its performers paraded with elegant clothes, even occasionally with tails and top hat, a model which soon came to be copied by other schools. That was the policy of its most illustrious member, Paulo da Portela, which meant that Sambistas should always go well dressed, in order to dispel the negative image of them held by the upper class. In the less formal blocos, predecessors of the schools, they had a reputation of being supporters of street fights and street riot.\n\nOne of the judging categories is the allegorical floats, filled with sculptures of wood, plastic, Styrofoam and other materials, decorated to represent the elements of the plot. In the Special Group performance of Rio de Janeiro, floats currently may not exceed eight meters and fifty centimeters wide and nine meters and eighty centimeters tall.\n\nThe first float of the parade often includes a stylised depiction of the school. Some schools, such as Portela for example, always bring their winged eagle symbol, regardless of plot. The greatest floats can reach up to 13 meters high and 60 meters in length, which sometimes affects their entry into the parade ground. These floats are propelled by hand with people who are below or behind the float. No float can be moved by an engine (during the 1990s, it was to prevent the risk of fire.\n\nThe progression or evolution of the school's parade as it develops its story is of great importance to the judges. Anyone watching should have the impression that the school is a single body, a continuous row. There is no requirement that the components perform samba, but they must move with a degree of unison and good timing. Schools that suffer dramatic changes in its parade speed, parading sometimes very quickly, sometimes slowly, are usually penalized.\n\nSchools where the participants do not sing the samba, or sing badly, may receiving lower points.\n\nAs a feature of the parades, the plot, usually chosen some time after the previous carnival, will occupy the school for the following year. Meanwhile, from the main theme, a synopsis is drawn, which will guide the design and manufacture of costumes, floats and samba-song. Judges will decide whether the school explained the theme during the parade.\n\nJudges assess whether the samba has a good melody and lyrics with interesting features, musically rich, reflecting the theme, and without bias or errors of language. The samba of each school is chosen after an internal competition at the school, where Sambistas or groups create their sambas, based on the previously agreed theme. The competition takes place over several weekends, some entries are eliminated, until only there is a winning song which the school then adopts. In Rio de Janeiro, the competition usually takes place in August. In October, a CD of the Special Group is recorded with chosen sambas from each school\n\nUntil 2007, the Special Group schools of São Paulo, the samba song would be considered twice, once for lyrics and once for melody of music, with equal points for each.\n\nThe mestre-sala (literally, \"The Master of the Room\") and porta-bandeira (\"she who carries the flag\") display the flag of the school to the audience. The porta-bandeira carries the flag, and the mestre-sala pays tribute and draws attention to both the flag and the porta-bandeira. Her dance is not a samba, but she spins and swirls her way ahead. The mestre-sala dances around her. All their moves are regulated in a set of rules, and at one point during the parade they are evaluated by the judges. The slightest mistake may result in their scores being lowered. For example: it is forbidden that the two turn their backs to each other at the same time, and errors such as the drop of a hat or other slips will result in lower scores. Their costumes are similar to the gala costumes typical of the eighteenth century, but \"carnavalized\", i.e. with an exaggerated amount of colors and decorations.\n\nCurrently, at least since the 1990s, the schools of the Special Group of Rio and São Paulo parade usually with three or four pairs of mestre-salas and porta-bandeira, but only the first is evaluated, the other being merely decorative, and optional. Normally, they are there to represent the school in some events when the main couple is unable to.\n\nThe \"mestre-sala\" seems to reflect the carnival dances of the nineteenth century, in which there was a professional organization responsible for the hall that was called \"master of room\" or \"master-room.\" With respect to the porta-bandeira, the name was a natural adaptation of the old flag-bearer character, usually male, who carried the heavy banners of Brazilian carnival groups The visual aspect of the mestre-sala has also been compared to the Zé Pilintra of ethnic Afro-Brazilian traditions.\n\nThe drumming wing, or \"bateria\", is a kind of orchestra of percussion instruments. They accompany the singer and lead the pace of the parade. The faster and stronger the pace of the bateria, the faster members usually parade. Each school has, currently, an average 250 to 300 musicians. Every bateria is evaluated on \"the regular maintenance and support of the cadence ... in accordance with the Samba Theme: the perfect combination of sounds emitted by various tools, and the creativity and versatility of the bateria.\"\n\nThe following instruments usually form part of a bateria of the samba school: Surdo de primera, surdo de segunda, surdo de terceira, caixa de guerra, repinique, chocalho, tambourim, cuíca, agogô, reco-reco, and frigedeira. There are variations in composition, for example, the samba-school Mangueira, does not use the surdo de segunda, only surdo de primeira and terceira, while the samba-school Empire Serrano emphasizes the agogô.\n\nIn the 1960s came the \"Paradinha\" (\"little stop\") of Mestre André, a famous director of the Mocidade Independente de Padre Miguel. André was the creator of the musical effect in which the bateria suddenly stop playing during a parade, leaving only the cavaquinho (a small string instrument) and voice components for a moment. When the music returns, the effect is of surprise and excitement. The expected effect, considered beautiful by the critics, is also risky because it increases the chances that the samba song can mistakenly be taken up again at the wrong moment.\n\nAs a whole orchestra, the percussionists of the samba school also has a conductor, also called master of bateria.\n\nThe queen of the drums section and related roles: godmother, muse, and princess are positions of honor occupied by distinguished members of the community and sometimes by celebrities. The queen of the drums section dances ahead of the drummers group and sometimes interacts with them.\n\nThe figure of the queen of the drums section appeared in the 1970s when the famous mulatto Adele Fatima led the Youth Independent Drums Section, an unprecedent fact, and gained popularity in the following decade. Today it is one of the most celebrated roles in samba schools. Monique Evans, in Mocidade, Luma de Oliveira, in Tradição and Soninha Capeta, in Beija-Flor, were some notable queens of drum sections. Some schools also introduced the figure of a King of the drums section.\n\nThe godmother of the drumming section is similar to the queen, and the two often get confused. Many schools use the two roles to pay tribute to more women. In the 1980s, many schools began to choose famous TV actresses instead of girls from the community, raising controversy in the media. In theory, the position of godmother should be offered to women of importance in the history of the school or in daily life, on a lifelong basis, which does not change every year, as the position of queen, but this is often not the case and the godmother only a queen with another name.\n\nThe \"ala das baianas\" is considered one of the most important wings of a samba school parade, and preferably composed of ladies dressed in clothes that refer to old aunts of the first groups of Bahia samba of the early twentieth century. It is mandatory for all competition parades of samba schools, although not official. In the years 1940 to 1950, it was common for men to parade dressed in this way.\n\nThe traditional clothing of Bahia consists of torso, coat, cloth and skirt round the coast. However, often we can see Bahia with the most unusual costumes, such as brides, statues of liberty, space beings, globe (pictured) or oil wells.\n\nThe old guard (in Portuguese \"Velha Guarda\") is a group of samba dancers older, often already quite old, often the founders of schools that no longer hold positions within the hierarchy of the party, but as a separate department, and occupy the Carnival parade in positions of honor, dressed in carnival costumes typical of samba, such zoot suits in school colors and Panama-style hats.\n\nThe singer, also known as the performer or puller is responsible for the professional performance of the samba-plot during the parade, and usually aided by a group of supporting singers. Using a microphone, and usually more powerful than the supporting singers, his voice stands out over the other members of the school, taking the lead on how fast the song is sung by the school's parade.\n\nThe samba during the parade should not be interpreted by one or just a few people, but sung by the entire school: the music should only be \"pulled\" (initiated) by the minority group. Moreover, many believe that the handle would be a special category of performer, able not only to interpret a samba, but also encourage and arouse the audience.\nFrom the 1990s, Jamelão, the long time singer from the Mangueira school, criticized the traditional term, seeking to replace it with a new terminology: Interpreter/Singer of the Samba-Enredo. In the words of Jamelão, one who would handle \"smoke pull, pull cart, pull-bag\" (in original \"puxa fuma fumo, puxa carro, puxa saco\"; in Rio de Janeiro's giria, \"smoke marijuana, steals vehicle, yes-man\") which in his opinion, a derogatory term. From this, many commentators and TV stations began to replace the first by the second term, which however, still remains.\n\nAnother controversy that is still common for interpreters is the question whether or not it is unethical for the official interpreter at a school to participate in the internal dispute of their own college. Some schools prohibit this, but release their professionals to participate in tryouts for other schools.\n\nThis is the professional responsible for design and development of the plot to be submitted by a school of samba as well as the design, development and construction of floats and costumes related to the proposed plot. In some cases, the carnavalesco develops the plot from a topic proposed by the direction of the samba school. In others, he suggests the theme of an idea from its original. The carnavalesco is usually a single person, but the Beija-Flor school of Rio de Janeiro now use a team of carnavalescos. The carnavalescos may or may not be university-trained for the profession, and may even have a team of researchers working with them to develop the school's theme. Many have a strong carnaval connection or background in the visual arts, performing arts, theater or dance.\n\nThis is the name by which may be called the president, the president of honor and patron of the school. One can also use this to include carnival directors, producers and other crew members. A director of carnival is a director of the samba school that heads up the guidelines and philosophy of their carnival college, taking part in the selection of members of various sectors, even sometimes the plot, coordinating also the shed or warehouse where the floats are made, the purchase of equipment, payments and the development of the entire project of the school. It is not uncommon for directors of Carnival to be paid professionals. Many also include the executive directors of the samba school, such as Laíla, of Beija-Flor.\n\nThe results of the carnival competition are announced on the afternoon of Ash Wednesday in Rio, and on the afternoon of Tuesday of carnival in São Paulo. In both cities, there is a ceremony where long lines are set up in the Sambódromo site. Tents are set up where the representatives of each samba school will annotate the scores as they are being disseminated, making the calculations. The chairman of the league makes the final considerations about the carnival that year, reads the possible loss of points given to each samba school, and then reads the scores.\n\nThe bleachers are open to the public, and the charge for entry is typically one kilogram of non-perishable food. Both in Rio and in São Paulo the event is transmitted live on television; television cameras in real time are used to broadcast the movement of blocks within the main school, the title favorite, where members and fans that Sambódromo were not to gather to watch the event from there.\n\nThe scores typically range between 7 and 10 in Rio and São Paulo, and the points are further subdivided into decimal fractions in Rio and 25 hundredths in São Paulo. In Rio, all the marks given by all the jurors are valid, while in São Paulo the lowest note of each item is eliminated .\n\nThe scoring system has changed several times in both cities. In Rio and São Paulo, until the early 2000s, the division was more than half a point, and there have been years when there was also the elimination of major score given to each school, the very removal of the lower scores have also and has ceased to be part of the rule several times. In Rio de Janeiro, the lowest score in the same period was 5, and note the 0 (zero) allowed only in case of failure of the plot.\n\nOften the scores given by the jurors are questioned, both by fans, as by members of schools who are harmed, causing many complaints after the show. Some results have been controversial stop in court. In the case of the school of samba Acadêmicos de Santa Cruz that the dark parade carnival in 1991 because of a blackout and was not evaluated. However, in recent years in São Paulo has been the climate of acceptance of the outcome, when in 2007 the president of Tobias Go-Go Live congratulate the Youth Alegre, being greeted by members of the Lemon school the following year.\n\nStarted in the 1980s, the Parade of Champions is an event during which the top 5 schools of the Special Group and the winner of Group A repeat their parades in the Sambadrome. It takes place on the Saturday following Ash Wednesday. This parade has no competitive character; it is a celebratory festival to crown the year's best schools that gives the parade participants (AKA foliões) a chance to be more carefree and enjoy themselves.\n\nIn São Paulo, the parade of champions is the night between Friday night and after the carnival on Saturday. Already the parade in Rio is the night of Saturday to the early hours of Sunday. In Rio de Janeiro, until the 1990s, participated in the parade of champions also promoted the schools of the Group to access, something that remains in São Paulo. Tradition was considered also in the participation of society Rio carnival hundred Italian Carnevale D'Italia. In 1985, an event that is considered integral to the history of Nene de Vila Matilde, was when the school was invited to join the parade of champions Rio, in an era where the Carnival Paulistano was much less popular and have not had a proper space.\n\nNot always, however, the parade of champions was a moment of pure celebration: many schools have taken the day to protest against the outcome of the championship. Fifth-placed in 2005, the Vai-Vai had no parade that year. The Viradouro already the champions parade on Saturday with members using the clown nose and banners of protest.\n\n\n"}

This unique public-private partnership promotes international scientific and technical collaboration through grants, technical resources, and training. CRDF Global was originally named the U.S. Civilian Research and Development Foundation for the Independent States of the Former Soviet Union (CRDF).\n\n\nCRDF Global is based in Arlington, Virginia, and has offices in Moscow and Saint Petersburg, Russia; Kiev, Ukraine; Almaty, Kazakhstan; and Amman, Jordan.\n\nBetween 1995 - 2010, CRDF Global awarded nearly 3,000 grants to more than 13,000 scientists—including 2,500 former weapons researchers—and has committed more than $105 million in total support. In addition to its own funds, CRDF Global has been able to leverage more than $42 million in additional support from foreign governments; as well as cash and in-kind contributions from participating American businesses. In addition to its grantmaking, CRDF Global has a very popular service it provides to organizations seeking to conduct research collaborations abroad, called CRDF Solutions (formerly GAP.) Through this service, CRDF Global has facilitated more than 1,100 individual projects, valued at over $195 million, on behalf of more than 180 business and industry, education and government clients.\n\nThe Soviet Union employed an estimated 50,000-60,000 nuclear experts, 65,000 bioweapons experts, and 6,000 chemical weapons experts. When the Soviet Union collapsed, many of these once-privileged scientists, engineers, and technicians became unemployed, underemployed, or unpaid. To prevent weapons experts from selling their knowledge to unfriendly states, the US government established or co-established several programs and organizations to provide scientists with civilian employment in their home countries. These “scientist redirection” and “scientist engagement” initiatives include the International Science and Technology Center, the Science and Technology Center in Ukraine, the State Department’s Global Threat Reduction programs (formerly Nonproliferation of WMD Expertise), the Department of Energy’s Initiatives for Proliferation Prevention and now-defunct Nuclear Cities Initiative, and CRDF.\n\nIn the FREEDOM Support Act of 1992, Congress established a “Research and Development Foundation” for the following purposes:\n\n\nThe initial funding for the foundation was $5 million from the US Department of Defense and a matching donation from philanthropist George Soros. The National Science Foundation provided $300,000 for start-up activities.\n\nCRDF Global has supported nonproliferation programs in the Departments of Defense, State, and Energy. These programs have frequently chosen to implement projects through CRDF because the foundation has some tax-free privileges, implementing agreements with foreign governments, and less bureaucracy. Typically, CRDF makes payments, imports equipment, and provides project oversight in exchange for a percentage fee.\n\nBeginning in 2003, CRDF Global expanded its activities beyond the former Soviet Union and amended its original purpose to its current mission statement. The organization now works in Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, the Middle East and North Africa, and the FSU. Since its establishment, CRDF has received funding from many US government agencies, along with foreign governments and organizations, and private US organizations such as the Ford Foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nCRDF Global's Board of Directors is co-chaired by Dr. William Wulf, president emeritus of the National Academy of Engineering, and Ms. Dona L.

{"id": "2015840", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2015840", "title": "Andy Cunningham (actor)", "text": "Andy Cunningham (actor)\n\nAndrew Cunningham (13 May 1950 – 5 June 2017) was an English actor, puppeteer, ventriloquist and writer. He was best known as the creator and main writer of the children's BBC television series, \"Bodger & Badger\", in which he acted as the likeable but accident prone Simon Bodger and his pet, Badger.\n\nCunningham studied at the University of Cambridge, where he read English. He dropped out of this course at the end of the second of its three years, citing academic pressures as the reason for doing so, but later completed his degree at the University of Reading. By the mid-1990s, he was in a long-term relationship with co-star Jane Bassett who played Mousey in \"Bodger & Badger\". They later separated but remained good friends. He also had a daughter, Phoebe, to a relationship prior to his one with Jane Bassett.\n\nBefore entering the acting profession and entertainment industry, he was an English teacher, then a social worker before, in the early 1970s, he decided to become a comedy magician. Andy had a lifelong interest in puppetry and magic that started when he was a child, watching such TV programmes as The Sooty Show and Muffin the Mule. When he was aged 8 his younger sister, journalist Tessa Cunningham, was born and he said he enjoyed entertaining her so much when she was young that in his early 20s, he decided to become a comedy magician. He began his craft by borrowing magic trick books from libraries, visited magic shops in the London area and after he spotted an advertising card in a newsagent's shop window for a ventriloquist's dummy, he took the opportunity to try learning ventriloquism. After picking it up - an unwanted Christmas present for a young boy - he began to teach himself ventriloquism, beginning with reading books on how to practice it. He found it quite natural to split himself in two and operate the puppet while doing something else, however, he was not happy with feeling that there was something very creepy about operating a human character, instead finding an animal character much less disturbing.\n\nAfter a while Andy began to explore magic conventions and it was at one in Brighton where - after spending a considerable amount of time having trouble getting past the doorman - he ordered by mail order a puppet called \"Benji the Adorable Puppy\" (which he named \"China\" after the Cockney slang \"china plate\", meaning \"mate\" - later to be used as China the Dog in Bodger and Badger). When this puppet arrived, he found himself being able to operate the puppet dog naturally and was able to ad-lib routines and comments in a way that he wasn't comfortable with doing with the ventriloquist's doll (which he named Douglas). Soon after, he gave up his day job to turn this hobby into a full-time job, alongside his work with the Covent Garden Community Theatre (with whom he held various positions, including acting). It was while working as a director here that he gave comedian Julian Clary his first big break. His work as Andiamo the Magician then as The Mighty Sardini (both routines adopting a cod-Italian accent) was used for both children's party entertainment and at magic shows, where he found that audiences were more appreciative of his puppet routines with China than of magic tricks.\n\nAfter this, he commissioned a friend of his called Deidre McArdle, who was good with making things out of textiles, to make him a puppet rat, as he thought it a good idea to have a puppet of an animal that people don't usually like. Unlike China, this puppet would talk (using a voice that was similar to that of Badger), and would be reserved for adult audiences where the rat (called Magritte) could be foul-mouthed, whereas China would be used in the presence of children. His decision to begin to phase out the magic act was taken when one night at a magic show, the person on stage before him did exactly the same magic tricks that he himself was about to do, so in a hurry he decided to drop his magic act for that night and ad-lib a puppet act with Magritte, extending the previously rehearsed act over the entire duration of his time on stage. He observed that the audience enjoyed this more than they usually did for his magic tricks, and after leaving the stage he found out part of the reason why was that they were laughing at the poor quality of his ventriloquism. As a result of this, instead of trying to improve his standard of ventriloquism (thinking he could never get to the standard of Ray Alan), he decided to shorten the puppet's sentences to a few words at a time, so that by the time people would look at his lips to see if his mouth was moving, the puppet would have stopped talking anyway.\n\nAnother act he developed was of a three-headed man named \"Freeman, Hardy and Willis\", after the footwear retailer, with Andy's head being the middle, and the two others either side being hand-operated puppets on top of an extra-wide suit. This act was used in public open spaces and especially at festivals, where Andy took great delight in embarrassing people in front of their friends by frightening them as a prank.\n\nBy the early 1980s, Andy had a regular income to supplement his magician and Community Theatre Group work as a handyman at a West London school, a job which he admitted himself he was entirely unsuitable for. This was to become the inspiration for the character of Mr Bodger and, in turn, the setting for the second and third series of Bodger and Badger. He began to adapt the Mighty Sardini act for touring shows and children's parties to that of a hapless Charlie Chaplin-esque character called Mr Bodger, including dropping the cod-Italian accent.\n\nIn 1986, Andy wrote a children's book featuring Mr Bodger and Magritte the rat entitled \"Mr Bodger's Jumping Hat\". Also during this time, Roland Rat became popular on TV-am's breakfast television ITV franchise and many people in London who knew Andy because of his work with Magritte either began thinking that Andy had stolen the idea of a badly behaving talking rat puppet from Roland Rat or confused Magritte with Roland, thinking Andy was Roland's puppeteer. It was also during this period when Andy made his only (uncredited) big-screen film performances in when someone from the casting team saw him perform an act in a pub show when he was wearing a very cumbersome costume that gave the impression of one person giving another a piggyback. It was from here that he was cast in two roles in that Star Wars film, one as Ephant Mon and another in an unnamed alien costume.\n\nAfter seeing the success of a badly behaved rodent puppet on television, around 1987 Andy began to explore the idea of adopting an act for TV himself. After wanting to have an act where both characters shared similar names, with one of those names being Bodger (and the other, by default through a lack of any other similar-sounding animal name, Badger), he commissioned his friend Deirdre McArdle, who had made Magritte, to make a puppet badger for him, wearing similarly eccentric clothing as Magritte. Badger would adopt a low, booming, voice similar to that of Magritte (and of boxer Frank Bruno) and would enjoy throwing food around. With a next-door neighbour he made two audition videotapes with him and Badger presenting a faux cookery programme where they made a recipe that coincidentally included mashed potato. The first performance was straight-laced and not very funny but the second, with Badger misbehaving and getting out of control throwing food everywhere, was much funnier. It is from here that Andy got the inspiration for Badger loving mashed potato, as he realised its potential for use in slapstick comedy (adapted from the traditional custard pie routine) while still being a very original and left-of-field idea. It was this second performance that he sent off to the BBC and several ITV regional franchisees. The ITV companies all gave him written appraisals but turned him down, however he received more positive news from Christopher Pilkington, an executive producer at the BBC within their Children's Programmes department. After this, he received no more positive news for months, occasionally calling up Chris Pilkington who would reply with encouragement.\n\nIn 1988, Andy received a phone call from Chris inviting him to make two pre-recorded appearances on the BBC's current Saturday morning BBC1 children's magazine programme On the Waterfront, both to test Andy out on broadcast television (as many stars who have performed in front of real audiences for many years have struggled to transfer to film or broadcast media) and to test how the act as it was at that time would fare with a children's TV audience. The results from both were encouraging for both Chris and Andy. However, Andy heard nothing again from Chris for months after this, continuing the routine of occasional phone calls to Chris with encouragement being received back.\n\nEarly in 1989, Andy received a call back from Chris giving the approval for a full series of programmes of Andy's act. However, Christopher had decided to change the idea from a series of 5-minute comedy cookery programmes into a fully-fledged sitcom with supporting characters and to make the episodes of the series 15-minutes in length. It was Chris who also suggested the idea of the setting for the first series, the kitchen of a \"greasy spoon\" cafe-cum-restaurant called \"Troff's Nosherama\" which, due to Badger's love of it, served themed meals all based around mashed potato and also specialised in cakes (a remaining feature of the two Saturday morning TV appearances the year before, which was to cease with the end of the first series). Andy wrote all the scripts for the first series based on this premise and the episodes were recorded in studio 7 of BBC Television Centre during the summer of 1989.\n\nAfter the first series was broadcast, Chris phoned Andy stating that both he and Andy had created some of the best Children's BBC comedy in years and that he would like to commission another Bodger and Badger series. Confident with the future success of the programme, Chris gave Bodger and Badger a bigger budget and Andy more creative freedom over the series from the second series onwards.\n\nDuring the run of the programme, Andy became very well known amongst his programme's intended audience and their parents, some of whom claimed that Badger's behaviour was a bad influence on its audience. He guest-starred (in character, with Badger) in various TV shows, events, theatre shows and children's parties off the back of the sudden success of his TV programme. Even after his programme stopped being shown on TV, he was a regular fixture in the \"Kidz tent\" at Glastonbury every year and performed more adult-themed nights at student unions up and down the country, who were children when Bodger and Badger was being shown on TV.\n\nCunningham died of duodenal cancer on 5 June 2017 at Royal Sussex County Hospital with his former partner and his family around him. He didn't regain consciousness after undergoing emergency stomach surgery, related to his cancer.\n"}

Millikan has spent most of her career at the University of Connecticut, where she is now Professor Emerita of Philosophy.\n\nMillikan earned her AB from Oberlin College in 1955. At Yale University she studied under Wilfrid Sellars. Although W. Sellars left for the University of Pittsburgh midway through Millikan's doctorate, she stayed at Yale and earned her PhD in 1969. She and Paul Churchland are often considered leading proponents of \"right wing\" (i.e., individualistic) Sellarsianism.\n\nMillikan taught half-time at Berea College from 1969-1972, Two-thirds time at The University of Western Michigan from 1972-1973, half-time at the University of Michigan from 1993-1996, but otherwise spent her entire career at the University of Connecticut, where she is now professor emerita. She is married to American psychologist and cognitive scientist Donald Shankweiler.\n\nShe was awarded the Jean Nicod Prize and gave the \"Jean Nicod Lectures\" in Paris in 2002. She was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2014. In 2017, she received both the Nicholas Rescher Prize for Systematic Philosophy from the University of Pittsburgh and the Rolf Schock Prize in Logic and Philosophy.\n\nMillikan is most famous for the view which, in her 1989 paper of the same name, she refers to as \"biosemantics\". Biosemantics is a theory about something philosophers often refer to as \"intentionality\". Intentionality is the phenomenon of things being 'about' other things, paradigm cases being thoughts and sentences. A belief of mine that you will do my chores for me, for example, is about you and about my chores. The same is true of a corresponding desire, intention or spoken or written command.\n\nIn general, the goal of a theory of intentionality is to explain the phenomenon – things being 'about' other things – in other, more informative, terms. Such a theory aims to give an account of what this 'aboutness' consists in. Just as chemistry offers the claim \"Water is H2O\" as a theory of what water consists in, so biosemantics aims for a constitutive account of intentionality. Such an account, Millikan stresses, must deal adequately with such hallmarks of mentality as error, confusion, and what looks like standing in a relation (the 'aboutness' relation) to something that doesn't exist. For example: one 'sees' the stick is bent, but realizes otherwise after pulling it from the water; the inexperienced prospector thinks he's struck it rich, but he's holding a lump of pyrite (\"fool's gold\"); the field marshal thinks about the next day's battle, the child wants to ride a unicorn, and the phrase \"the greatest prime\" is somehow 'about' a number that cannot possibly exist (there's a simple proof for this).\n\nAs the name hints, Millikan's theory explains intentionality in terms that are broadly 'biological' or teleological. Specifically, she explains intentionality using the explanatory resources of natural selection: what thoughts and sentences and desires are 'about' is ultimately elucidated by reference to what has been selected and what it has been selected for (i.e., what advantage it conferred on ancestors who possessed it). Where this selection is non-intentional, then what it is for is its 'proper function'.\n\nEqually important is what might be called the co-evolution of producer-mechanisms and consumer-mechanisms. Millikan refers to the intertwined selection histories of these mechanisms to explain the hallmarks of mentality and to offer a wide range of positions on various matters of dispute in the philosophy of mind and language.\n\nIn her article \"Naturalist Reflections on Knowledge\", Millikan defends the position that the justification of true beliefs through an explanation in accordance with evolution constitutes knowledge.\n\n\nNote: the 1993, 2005 and 2012 books are collections of papers.\n\nMillikan has also published many articles, many of which are listed and available here.\n\n\n"}

It is written in the Latin script, having an official alphabet.\n\nWith 650 speakers, it is the second largest of all Sámi languages. It is reported that the number of native speakers is in sharp decline among the younger generations. The language has, however, been standardised in 1983 and elaborately cultivated ever since.\n\nSome analyses of Lule Sámi phonology may include preaspirated stops and affricates (, , , , ) and pre-stopped or pre-glottalised nasals (voiceless , , , and voiced , , , ). However, these can be treated as clusters for the purpose of phonology, since they are clearly composed of two segments and only the first of these lengthens in quantity 3. The terms \"preaspirated\" and \"pre-stopped\" will be used in this article to describe these combinations for convenience.\n\n\nLule Sámi possesses the following vowels:\n\n\nConsonants, including clusters, that occur after a stressed syllable can occur in multiple distinctive length types, or quantities. These are conventionally labelled quantity 1, 2 and 3 or Q1, Q2 and Q3 for short. The consonants of a word alternate in a process known as consonant gradation, where consonants appear in different quantities depending on the specific grammatical form. Normally, one of the possibilities is named the \"strong grade\", while the other is named \"weak grade\". The consonants of a weak grade are normally quantity 1 or 2, while the consonants of a strong grade are normally quantity 2 or 3.\n\n\nThroughout this article and related articles, consonants that are part of different syllables are written with two consonant letters in IPA, while the lengthening of consonants in quantity 3 is indicated with an IPA length mark ().\n\nNot all consonants can occur in every quantity type. The following limitations exist:\n\nWhen a consonant can occur in all three quantities, quantity 3 is termed \"overlong\".\n\nUmlaut is a process whereby a diphthong in a stressed syllable changes depending on the vowel in the next syllable.\n\nThe first type of umlaut, causes an alternation between and in words whose stems end with unstressed . For such words, these two diphthongs can be considered variants of each other, while in words whose stems end with another vowel, these vowels remain distinct. The following table shows the different patterns that occur with different following vowels:\n\nThe second type of umlaut, called \"diphthong simplification\" or \"monophthongization\", is similar to its Northern Sami counterpart, but works differently. The diphthongs and become and respectively, if:\nThe diphthongs and are unaffected. The reverse process also occurs, turning the long vowels back into diphthongs if the consonant becomes quantity 3 or the vowel in the next syllable becomes long.\n\nThe third type of umlaut, progressive umlaut, works in the other direction. It causes the \"unstressed\" vowels and to be rounded to and respectively, if the preceding \"stressed\" vowel is short .\n\nIf a stressed syllable contains a short vowel followed by a single (quantity 1) consonant, then a short vowel in the following syllable is lengthened.\n\nSammallahti divides Lule Sámi dialects as follows:\n\n\nFeatures of the northern dialects of Lule Sámi are:\n\nFeatures of the southern dialects of Lule Sámi are:\n\nThe orthography used for Lule Sámi is written using an extended form of the Latin script.\n\nTraditionally, the character n-acute (Ń/ń) has been used to represent the sound, found, for example, in the English word \"song\". In place of n-acute (available in Unicode and mechanical type writers, but not in Latin-1 or traditional Nordic keyboards), many have used ñ or even ng. In modern orthography, such as in the official publications of the Swedish government and the recently published translation of the New Testament, it is usually replaced with ŋ, in accordance with the orthography of many other Sámi languages.\n\nLule Sámi has seven cases:\n\nLike the other Uralic languages, the nominative singular is unmarked and indicates the subject of a predicate.\nThe nominative plural is also unmarked and is always formally the same as the genitive singular.\n\nThe \"genitive\" singular is unmarked and looks the same as the nominative plural. The genitive plural is marked by an \"-j\". The genitive is used:\n\n\nThe accusative is the direct object case and it is marked with \"-v\" in the singular. In the plural, its marker is \"-t\", which is preceded by the plural marker \"-j\".\n\nThe inessive marker is \"-n\" in the singular and the plural, when it is then preceded by the plural marker \"-j\". This case is used to indicate:\n\n\nThe illative marker is \"-j\" in the singular and \"-da\" in the plural, which is preceded by the plural marker \"-i\", making it look the same as the plural accusative. This case is used to indicate:\n\n\nThe elative marker is \"-s\" in the singular and the plural, when it is then preceded by the plural marker \"-j\". This case is used to indicate:\n\n\nThe comitative marker in the singular is \"-jn\" and \"-j\" in the plural, which means that it looks like the genitive plural. The comitative is used to state \"with whom or what\" something was done.\n\nThe personal pronouns have three numbers - singular, plural and dual. The following table contains personal pronouns in the nominative and genitive/accusative cases.\n\nThe next table demonstrates the declension of a personal pronoun \"he/she\" (no gender distinction) in various cases:\n\nLule Sámi verbs conjugate for three grammatical persons:\n\n\nLule Sámi has five grammatical moods:\n\n\nLule Sámi verbs conjugate for three grammatical numbers:\n\n\nLule Sámi verbs have two simple tenses:\n\n\nand two compound tenses:\n\n\nLule Sámi, like Finnish, the other Sámi languages, and some Estonian dialects, has a negative verb. In Lule Sámi, the negative verb conjugates according to tense (past and non-past), mood (indicative, imperative and optative), person (1st, 2nd and 3rd) and number (singular, dual and plural).\n\n\n"}

The stadium is under the control of the Sports Department Uttar Pradesh. It is the only international cricket stadium in Uttar Pradesh that has regularly hosted international cricket matches in both Test and One Day format. The stadium hosted the 500th test played by the Indian team. It also organized four Vivo IPL matches, on 19 and 21 May 2016 and 10 and 13 May 2017. As of 19 August 2017 it has hosted 22 Tests, 14 ODIs and 1 T20I. It is situated near the river Ganges.\n\nIt was named after British lady Madam Green who used to come here for horse riding. The stadium is nicknamed as 'Billiards Table', and is also nicknamed as 'Woolmer's turf' in the memory of late cricket coach and player Bob Woolmer who was born in McRobert Hospital opposite to the stadium.\n\nThe Green Park Stadium is named after Madam Green who used to practice horse riding here in the 1940s. It is located in the Civil Lines area in the north east part of Kanpur city near the banks of the river Ganges, which flows just behind the stadium.\n\nThis is the only stadium in India where a students gallery is available. Green Park has the largest manually operated scoreboard in the world. It also has video screens which are used during international matches.\n\nIndia's first Test win over Australia in December 1959 was at the Green Park ground. This was also the first match to be played on a turf wicket here. Off-spinner Jasubhai Patel's 14 wickets were instrumental in ensuring India's win.\n\nIn 1958/9 Subhash Gupte took nine West Indian wickets in an inning for 102 runs, and had Lance Gibbs – the only batsman he missed – dropped by wicket keeper Naren Tamhane.\n\nSince 1957 India has lost only twice at Kanpur, to the West Indies on both occasions, when Subhash Gupte's dream spell was overshadowed by Wes Hall's 10 wickets in 1958 and later when India's 1983 world cup euphoria was cut short by Malcolm Marshall's fearsome bowling. The most runs scored were by Gundappa Vishwanath (776), Sunil Gavaskar (629) and Mohammed Azharuddin (543). The most wickets taken were by Kapil Dev (25), Anil Kumble (21) and Harbhajan Singh (20).\n\nThe ends are known as the Mill Pavilion End and the Hostel End.

It is situated to the north of St Thomas and to the east of St Mary in Surrey County. It is one of the rural areas of Jamaica, containing part of the Blue Mountains, where the Jamaican Maroon communities of Moore Town and Charles Town, Jamaica are located.\n\nThe parish is situated at latitude 18°10' N and longitude 75°27'W. It extends from the highest peaks of the Blue Mountains, above sea level, down to the north coast, and is noted for its fertile soil, scenery, and beaches. The parish lies in the direct path of the northeast trade winds, and the Blue Mountain ridge to its south traps the moisture. This parish has the highest rainfall in the island. Port Antonio, its chief town and capital, has two harbours, the western one being sheltered by a small islet, Navy Island. Portland covers an area of 814 square kilometers, making it Jamaica's seventh-largest parish.\n\nThe parish has a variety of complex landforms; the entire coastline is dotted with caves, bays, rivers, waterfalls and hills. There are fourteen caves, which include those at Buff Bay, Orange Bay, Hope Bay, Port Antonio, Boston Bay, Long Bay, Innis Bay and Nonsuch. There are also 17 rivers which form a network throughout the parish. The largest are the Rio Grande, Buff Bay and Hectors rivers.\n\nThe population of Portland is an estimated 82,183, 15,000 of whom live in the capital town. Its people are 89.8% black, 1.2% white, 5.3% Asians, 2.6% mixed race, and 1.1% other. It includes the separate Maroon communities of Charles Town, Jamaica and Moore Town.\n\nThe parish is a leading producer of bananas, coconuts, breadfruits, coffee, mangoes and ackee which are grown for export as well as local consumption. Portland has very rich land on its coastal strips that is suitable for any kind of cultivation, so many domestic crops are grown. Manufacturing is a small sector of the economy, with about 18 factories. They also do farming.\n\nA number of tourist facilities exist in the area, including Trident Villas and Hotel, Jamaica Palace, Dragon Bay Villas, Goblin Hill Hotel, Jamaica Crest, Fern Hill Club, and Mocking Bird Hill.\n\nBecause of its natural environment, tourism has often flourished in the parish. It is noted for its beaches, such as Frenchman's Cove, Boston Beach, Winifred, and Dragon Bay. The Blue Mountains are also located in Portland; two Maroon communities are located there. The internationally known Blue Lagoon is in this parish; it is believed to be the crater of an extinct volcano. The lagoon is an almost landlocked cove with approximately 55 m (180 ft) of water. Rafting on the Rio Grande is also a tourist attraction.\n\nBoston Jerk Centre in Portland is an area well known for its \"jerked\" foods, including chicken, fish and pork. Jerked foods are foods made with Jamaican jerk spice and traditional technique.\n\nSince the early 1950s, more than 782 film or screen productions have been shot in Portland. Two of the most popular are \"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea\", by Walt Disney (USA) in 1954 and \"The Harder They Come\" by Vista Productions (Jamaica) in 1972. Scenes from the film \"Cocktail,\" starring Tom Cruise, were shot at the bar on the beach at the Dragon Bay resort. An early film edition of the 1963 version of \"Lord of the Flies\" was largely shot at Frenchman's Cove; the 1990 remake by Harry Hook was filmed at Frenchman's Cove and Snow Hill. The singer Rihanna filmed the video for her song \"Man Down\" in various locations throughout the parish in April/May 2011.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2015865", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2015865", "title": "Downtown Kansas City", "text": "Downtown Kansas City\n\nDowntown Kansas City is the central business district (CBD) of Kansas City, Missouri and accounts for 4.0% of the Kansas City metropolitan area employment as of 2010. It is between the Missouri River in the north, to 31st Street in the south; and from the Kansas–Missouri state line east to Bruce R. Watkins Drive as defined by the Downtown Council of Kansas City; the 2010 Greater Downtown Area Plan formulated by the City of Kansas City defines the Greater Downtown Area to be the city limits of North Kansas City and Missouri to the north, the Kansas–Missouri state line to the west, 31st Street to the south and Woodland Avenue to the east. However, the definition used by the Downtown Council is the most commonly accepted.\n\nIn March 2012, Downtown Kansas City was selected as one of America's Best downtowns by \"Forbes\" magazine for its rich culture in arts, numerous fountains, upscale shopping, and various local cuisine – most notably barbecue.\n\nAccording to the Downtown Council of Kansas City, as of 2013, the Downtown area has a population of 19,899 residents with 11,790 housing units and a median household income of $61,491. Also as of 2013, Downtown has 137 units under construction and 1,326 in the planning stages.\n\nThe United States Census in 2010 suggests Downtown has a population of 22,576, though this may include land outside the district boundaries defined by the Downtown Council of Kansas City.\n\nIn 2000, the population may have been as low as 10,000 people with 7,330 units. In 2005, Downtown Kansas City had a population density of approximately in its area. According to Local Market reports, Downtown houses approximately of office space. However, the vacancy of this space is at about 15%. There are also about of Class A&B office space in Downtown, with a vacancy rate of 15.9%. There are over 100,000 employees working in the Downtown area. Downtown has a total of 5,606 hotel rooms, accounting for 22.5% of the total amount of hotel rooms in the metropolitan area. The average occupancy of these rooms is about 56.5%. As of 2007, about of office space are under construction in Downtown Kansas City. Current investments into downtown redevelopment have exceeded $6 billion.\n\n\nIn recent years, Downtown Kansas City has been undergoing a massive \"boom\" in renovations and new construction. Since 2000, the estimated cost of these projects has totaled over $5.5 billion.\n\nThe Power & Light District, also known as the \"Entertainment District\", is a nine-block area to the immediate south of the Central Business District. Originally to be named \"Kansas City Live\", Cordish, Inc. of Baltimore, Maryland – which developed the area – decided to name the district after the historic art deco Power & Light Building. The present headquarters of the Kansas City Power & Light Company, a subsidiary of Great Plains Energy, is also on the district's northern side. Instead, a one-block area near the new H&R Block headquarters tower – devoted to live music venues – was named Kansas City \"Live!\".\n\nThe H&R Block building, which opened in the summer of 2006, has a prominent oval shape in its design, mixed with blue-green reflective glass, making for an architectural transition between the Central Business District's skyscrapers and the south loop's older buildings. This ties together a theme of new, glass-walled buildings in the area, also including the Sprint Center and the \"Kansas City Star\" printing press across I-670.\n\nCordish also will build four residential towers as part of the project, which include a 25-floor residential tower (One Light), lying to the immediate north of the H&R Block headquarters on a lot once occupied by the flagship store of the Jones Store Company. Groundbreaking on the complex began in March 2006. The Entertainment District practically shares a border with I-670. Enclosed between the residential towers and H&R Block's new building will be many shops and restaurants new to the Kansas City area. The new district has become a major attraction for residents and visitors to the Kansas City area, and has had a civic impact on Downtown similar to that experienced by other municipalities, such as Baltimore and San Antonio.\n\nThe Sprint Center, an 18,500-seat arena, is a project that was announced shortly after the Power & Light District. In 2004, a ballot initiative to fund the proposed arena through a tax on car rentals and hotels was effectively passed by area voters. The project raised some controversy as Enterprise Rent-A-Car, whose owner is known for supporting a possible NBA franchise in the company's headquarters of St. Louis, lobbied against the tax and tried to sway public opinion against the arena. Some city officials, as well as those who did not desire to pay the increased tax, also fought against the project. One of the most prominent of these individuals was Sandra McFadden-Weaver, a member of the City Council of Kansas City, Missouri. Despite the outcry from a few dissenters, the arena vote passed decidedly.\n\nConstruction began on the Sprint Center in late 2004. Before this, however, and even before the vote, the city sent out requests to local and national architectural firms – including HOK Sports, Ellerbe Beckett, 360 Architecture, Rafael Architects Inc. and the world-renowned Frank Gehry – to bid on the project. The first four of the aforementioned firms, however, collaborated to form the \"Downtown Arena Design Team,\" and won the contract over Gehry's bid, with the city citing the companies had completed a variety of sports-related projects and were based locally as the reason for their selection. Since construction began, many local minority leaders have protested the construction company and contractors for not putting enough minorities in the construction and contracting teams. The contractors, however, assert they have complied with state and federal requirements and continue to meet the requests of local citizens.\n\nThe Sprint Center opened in 2007; as of June 2011, the arena does not have an NBA or NHL tenant. However, the arena has served as the venue for events such as concerts and since March 2008, the Big 12 Basketball Tournament.\n\nThe Kansas City Convention Center consists of several buildings, either connected to or adjacent to each other: Bartle Hall, the Grand Ballroom, the Conference Center, Meeting Rooms, and Barney Allis Plaza. The facilities put together encompass more than 800,000 square feet.\n\nBartle Hall was opened in 1976, in time for the Republican National Convention. As time passed, the need for more room grew. In 1994, Kansas City-based HNTB and BNIM designed an expansion that spanned over I-670 through downtown. After the project's completion, 388,800 square feet were available for the exhibition hall. The expansion also included a grand ballroom, conference center, and meeting rooms.\n\nThe facilities also include Municipal Auditorium, an Art Deco venue built in 1934. It features an arena that seats 10,700; a music hall that seats 2,400; and a little theater suited for more private events. The auditorium connects via parking garage and skywalk to the rest of the convention center.\n\nThe Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts is on the northern edge of the Crossroads Arts District, just south of the Bartle Hall ballroom. Construction began on October 6, 2006, and the facility opened to the public in September 2011. It was designed by architect Moshe Safdie.\n\nThe 316,000 square foot performing arts center consists of the Muriel McBrien Kauffman Theater, Helzberg Hall, and the Brandmeyer Great Hall. Three resident companies call the center home: the Kansas City Symphony, Kansas City Ballet and Kansas City Lyric Opera. By May 2015, more than 1.5 million people had experienced an event at the center.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City is a 16-story office tower with a two-story operations center designed by Henry N. Cobb of Pei Cobb Freed & Partners. It is at Penn Valley Park on the southern edge of Downtown, to the immediate west of Crown Center on a site formerly occupied by Trinity Lutheran and St. Mary's Hospitals. The bank was based out of a 21-story tower in the Downtown Loop until the Penn Valley Park facility opened in 2008.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has its Kansas City offices just west of Crown Center, which houses up to 6,000 employees. Presumably because of the threat of terrorism, the IRS selected the site as it is in a low-lying area and the development has low-rise buildings. The plan called for a $200 million facility with 5,500 parking spaces in its accompanying garage, and over of office space. Construction began in 2004 and the building was completed in the summer of 2006. The IRS was also to occupy the nearby Kansas City Main Post Office building (the Post Office having moved across the street to a building next to Union Station).\n\nThe historic Freight House building in the Crossroads Arts District was built in the 1880s; it was renovated in the late 1990s, and it is now home to Grunauer, Lidia's Kansas City, and Fiorella's Jack Stack Barbecue. The original plan for the redevelopment included a 21-story hotel and garage; however, the hotel portion of the plan did not materialize because of uncertainty about the future redevelopment of downtown.\n\nIn August 2007, developer Dan Clothier announced he wanted to complete his original plan by adding an 18-story hotel tower atop a three-level garage. The $38 million project calls for the structure to house 200 hotel rooms or a combination of 160 rooms along with some residential units.\n\nIn November, 2006, Barkley Inc., an advertising and public relations firm formerly known as Barkley Evergreen & Partners, moved its 350+ employees to the former TWA world headquarters at the district's southern edge. The building had been empty for two decades and cost over $30 million to renovate. Barkley also reconstructed the famous Walt Disney-designed three-story rocket ship that stood atop the building during TWA's tenure. The Moonliner signified one-time TWA majority shareholder Howard Hughes' desire to guide the airline into space travel. Other renovations included a theater, grass-lined rooftop observation deck, open floor plan, and gallery space featuring art from local and national artists. Barkley adopted the rocket ship as its new logo shortly before moving into the renovated TWA space. BNIM Architects moved to the building's third floor in 2014.\n\nThe Commerce Bank Tower at 9th and Main Streets housed Kansas City's largest bank until it was recently renovated into a multi-use property of apartments, child care center, and Park University school. H&R Block, Commerce Bancshares, UMB Bank, Kansas City Southern, BNIM, Great Plains Energy, Aquila, DST Systems, J.E. Dunn Construction Group and HNTB are also among the companies headquartered in Downtown Kansas City.\n\n\nThe Loop is the north central section of Downtown Kansas City; it is the most dense section of the city, and is surrounded on all four sides by the downtown freeway loop. Altogether, the Loop has an area of nearly one square mile. In 2006, the Downtown Loop had nearly 8,000 residents. The Downtown Loop encompasses Quality Hill, the Central Business District, the Entertainment District, and the Government District.\n\nDistricts in The Loop are:\n\nThe Crossroads District, formerly a warehouse district from I-670 in the north up to Union Station in the south, is going through a period of revitalization, like much of the city. Buildings are being redeveloped for office and residential uses. Several restaurants and art galleries are now within the district, and the area has a monthly event known as First Fridays. They feature pop-up art galleries, food trucks, live music, and shopping deals.\n\nCrown Center is a district developed by Hallmark. Within Crown Center, families can enjoy an aquarium, Legoland, and Kaleidoscope. There are several mid to upscale stores, and visitors can stay at the Sheraton Crown Center or the Westin Crown Center. The district is a short walk from Liberty Memorial (which features a world-class World War One museum). Visitors can connect to Union Station and the rest of Crown Center via a skywalk called the Link.\n\nThe River Market is Kansas City's original neighborhood on the Missouri River. The district contains one of the country's largest and longest lasting public farmers' markets. There are several unique shops and restaurants in the area. Steamboat Arabia Museum is next to the City Market. Residents and visitors traveling by foot or bike can take the Town of Kansas Bridge connection to get to the Riverfront Heritage Trail which leads to Berkley Riverfront Park, which is operated by Port KC.\n\nLaunched by the Kansas City Area Transportation Authority (KCATA) in July 2005, \"MAX\" (Metro Area Express) is a bus rapid transit line extending from downtown through the Country Club Plaza to Waldo. The MAX buses include GPS to transmit real-time data on the next pickup time to each station where the line stops; all buses have dedicated lanes during rush hour and stoplights can automatically change in their favor, if needed, if buses are behind schedule.\n\nA second MAX route opened on January 1, 2011 (Troost Avenue MAX, or \"Green Line\"), which shares some downtown stops with what is now called Main Street MAX (or \"Orange Line\"). Most other KCATA routes have stops throughout downtown, centered on the Transit Plaza at 10th & Main Streets and Grand Avenue between 11th and 12th Streets.\n\nOn December 12, 2012, a ballot initiative to construct a $102 million, two-mile streetcar, which will stretch from River Market to Crown Center, was approved by local voters. Construction on the line began in 2013, and the line became operational in May 2016. A new non-profit corporation made up of private sector stakeholders and city appointees – the Kansas City Streetcar Authority – operates and maintains the system. Unlike many similar systems around the U.S., there will be no fare charged. The city is planning to add multiple extensions to the starter line.\n\nIn 2015, the KCATA, Unified Government Transit, Johnson County Transit, and IndeBus (all separate metro services) began merging into one coordinated transit service for the Kansas City region, called RideKC. The buses and other transit options will be branded as: RideKC Bus, RideKC MAX, RideKC Streetcar, and RideKC Bridj. RideKC Bridj is a micro transit service partnership between Ford Bridj and KCATA that began on March 7, 2016. Users download the Bridj app and use the service much like a taxi service. The merger and full coordination is expected to be complete by 2019.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2015873", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2015873", "title": "Hypoallergenic dog breed", "text": "Hypoallergenic dog breed\n\nA hypoallergenic dog breed is a dog breed (or crossbreed) that is purportedly more compatible with allergic people than are other breeds. However, prominent allergen researchers have claimed that there is no basis to the claims that certain breeds are hypoallergenic and, while allergen levels vary among individual dogs, the breed is not a significant factor.\nThough some studies suggest the possible existence of hypoallergenic dog breeds, there is too much variability to conclude that such a breed exists. According to researchers, claims about the existence of hypoallergenic dog breeds may have been fueled by unsubstantiated articles on the internet. In a recent interview, Christine Cole Johnson, Senior Staff Scientist at the Henry Ford Hospital & Health System, referring to the findings of her article in the July 2011 issue of the \"American Journal of Rhinology and Allergy\", explained that it was unclear where the name hypoallergenic dog breed came from, and asserted that the existence of such a breed was just a myth. The significant allergens are proteins found in the dog's saliva and dander. Some studies have suggested that the production of the allergen, and therefore human allergenic reaction, varies by breed, yet more recent scientific findings indicate that there are no significant differences between breeds in the generation of these allergens. One study found hypoallergenic breeds to have significantly more allergen in their coats than non-hypoallergenic breeds although there was no differences in the allergen levels in the air or on the floor.\n\nBreeds that shed less are more likely to be hypoallergenic, since the dog's dander and saliva stick to the hair and are not released into the environment. However, protein expression levels play a major role and amount of shedding alone does not determine degree of allergic reaction. \"Even if you get a hairless dog, it's still going to produce the allergen,\" Dr. Wanda Phipatanakul, chair of the Indoor Allergen Committee for the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology is quoted in the newsmagazine U.S. News & World Report as saying. How hypoallergenic a particular dog is for a particular person may vary with the individual dog and the individual person.\n\nIf a person is allergic, they may be best able to tolerate a specific dog, possibly of one of the hypoallergenic breeds. Dr. Thomas A. Platts-Mills, head of the Asthma and Allergic Disease Center at the University of Virginia, explained that there are cases in which a specific dog (not breed) might be better tolerated by a specific person, for unknown reasons. \"We think there really are differences in protein production between dogs that may help one patient and not another,\" Dr. Platts-Mills said.\n\nAll dogs shed, and all dogs produce dander and saliva in some degree. As noted above, the amount of the allergenic protein present on the dander and in saliva varies by breed. Also, the amount of the allergen can be reduced or eliminated in individual dogs by treatments such as bathing. But for most breeds, when not regularly bathed, even a dog who sheds very little or has little dander can trigger a reaction in a sensitive person.\n\nSize may be a factor in determining hypoallergenicity. It is possible that the total body surface area of the dog is more indicative of reduced production of allergens than its breed.\n\nSmaller dogs will also leave fewer environmental pollutants containing dog dander and dog allergens (reduced fecal matter, urine and saliva). Small hairless dogs may be less likely to cause allergic reactions \"because it's so easy to bathe them and the dander falls off them.\" Dogs may leave behind urine, saliva and fecal matter as allergen sources. Dogs with access to the outdoors may introduce outdoor allergens such as mold and pollen with larger animals tracking in more of these allergens. It is well established that most individuals with dog allergy also suffer with additional environmental allergies. Individuals with dog allergy may also be at increased risk for human protein hypersensitivity with cross-reactivity of dog dander allergen and human seminal fluid.\n\nResearchers have shown that frequently bathing dogs reduces the amount of allergen related protein on the fur or hair of the dog and the amount of airborne allergen. Bathing a dog at least twice a week will minimize or even eliminate the reaction of an allergic person to a dog.\n\nFrequent cleaning and vacuuming of the home, using air filters, restricting the dog to certain rooms, and adopting a small dog that can easily be given frequent baths are all recommended by the Humane Society of the United States to control allergens. Scientific research has repeatedly shown that good cleaning practices in the home remove allergens from the environment.\n\nMany allergists suggest that a dog not be introduced to the environment of a dog allergic individual. While \"allergy shots\" can reduce many individuals' dog-allergic reactions, the most common approach remains avoidance.\n\nThere have been recent studies suggesting early introduction of pets to home may reduce the likelihood of developing sensitization. There are reports of individuals who will become less sensitive with continued exposure to a pet in the environment. But allergists warn that pet owners cannot rely on a breed being non-allergenic just because a particular allergic pet owner can tolerate a specific dog of that breed.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2015882", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2015882", "title": "Fairchild 24", "text": "Fairchild 24\n\nThe Fairchild Model 24, also called the Fairchild Model 24 Argus/UC-61 Forwarder or Fairchild Model 24 Argus, is a four-seat, single-engine monoplane light transport aircraft designed by the Fairchild Aviation Corporation in the 1930s. It was adopted by the United States Army Air Corps as UC-61 and also by the Royal Air Force. The Model 24 was itself a development of previous Fairchild models and became a successful civil and military utility aircraft.\n\nFairchild-Aircraft was hit hard by the Great Depression in the early 1930s as airline purchases disappeared. Consequently, the company attention turned to developing a reliable and rugged small aircraft for personal and business use. The Fairchild 22 became somewhat of a hit and led directly to the new and much improved Model 24 which gained rapid popularity in the early 1930s, noted for its pleasant handling characteristics and roomy interior. Having adapted many components from the automotive industry (expansion-shoe brakes and roll-down cabin windows), the aircraft was also affordable and easy to maintain. In production continuously from 1932 to 1948 the aircraft remained essentially unchanged aerodynamically and internally, with the simple addition of extra passenger seating and optional equipment. The first models were equipped with only two seats, but in 1933 a third seat was installed and by 1938 a fourth was added. The interior was first created for the Model 24 in 1937 by noted American industrial designer Raymond Loewy. A minor airframe revision was made in 1938 with the redesign of the vertical fin and redesignation from C8 to F24G onwards.\n\nAs an innovative concept, the aircraft was available with two powerplants, Warner's reliable Scarab and Fairchild's in-house 200 hp Ranger series in the F24 C8D, E and F. Initially the 1932 model Fairchild 24 C8B used a reliable and popular Warner 125 hp radial engine, and the Fairchild 24 C8C used the Warner 145 hp radial. American Cirrus III and Menasco Pirate inline engines were also occasionally used in some earlier Fairchild 24s. Later models such as the popular 24Ws upgraded to the 165 hp Warner Super Scarab.\n\nDesigned for operations from relatively unimproved grass airfields, the sturdy undercarriage construction used a vertical oil dampened cylinder above the wheel with a pivoting strut attached to the lower fuselage. The result was a complex but undeniably solid undercarriage that could absorb large amounts of shock and was also adapted for the fitting of twin floats for water-based operations.\n\nThe sturdiness of construction of the aircraft has ensured many have survived to this day. Some suggest the massive spruce main spars can be loaded up to 10g, and while that figure is unproved, all prewar utility category aircraft were designed to withstand at least 4.1g as opposed to the 3.8g postwar design limit standard.\n\nThe Fairchild 24 built by Kreider-Reisner Aircraft, Hagerstown, Maryland, a division of Fairchild Aviation Corporation, remained in production from 1932 to 1948, essentially the same airframe but with various powerplant and configuration enhancements. In all, Fairchild constructed over 1500 Model 24s, with an additional 280 being constructed by the Texas Engineering & Manufacturing Company (TEMCO) in Dallas when that company purchased the manufacturing rights after World War II.\n\nIn civil use, the aircraft was a quick sales success, with prominent businessmen and Hollywood actors purchasing the aircraft. In 1936, the US Navy ordered Model 24s designated as GK-1 research and instrument trainers. The type was also used by the US Army as a light transport and by the Coast Guard, with the designation J2K-1. The Civil Air Patrol operated many Fairchild UC-61/24s, and some aircraft were fitted with two 100-pound bombs for what became successful missions against German U-boats off the east coast of the United States in the early stages of the Second World War. The UC-61 was also procured by the US Navy as the GK-1 and by the British Royal Air Force as the Fairchild Argus.\n\nIn 1941, the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) placed an initial order for 163 Fairchild C-61s; however, via Lend-Lease, 161 of these were shipped abroad. Under the auspices of this program, the majority of the 525 Warner Scarab Fairchild 24s/C-61s went to Great Britain. Most of these aircraft saw service as Argus Is and improved Argus IIs and were allocated to a newly formed adjunct of the Royal Air Force (RAF), the Air Transport Auxiliary (ATA). An additional 306 Ranger-powered Argus IIIs were also used by the ATA. In British service, the majority of the Argus type operated with the ATA ferrying their aircrew to collect or deliver aircraft to and from manufacturers, Maintenance Units (MU)s and operational bases.\n\nThe Argus I was a Warner Scarab-equipped aircraft identified by its wind-driven generator located on the starboard struts, and was equipped with a black-painted propeller. The Argus II was also a Scarab-powered aircraft, usually with a transparent cabin roof. This mark was certified for heavier operational weight than the Mark I and was identified by its yellow propeller. The Argus III was equipped with the six-cylinder inverted inline Ranger engine.\n\nThe aircraft was used by small air charter operators for short-distance taxi work and many were acquired by private pilot owners. It served with military forces as diverse as Finland, Thailand, Israel, Canada, the United States and Australia.\n\nThe last \"new\" Fairchild 24 was assembled in 1948 from a large inventory of leftover parts in Winfield, KS.\n\nTen Fairchild F24R aircraft operated for Comair (South Africa) during the period after the Second World War.\n\n\n\n\n\nConverted military aircraft became popular postwar as personal transports and many survive to this day. Extremely solidly built, the aircraft survives in reasonably large numbers. Primarily, this popularity is probably due to affordability. Prices for low-hour examples of the aircraft typically range between US$50,000 and 90,000 (2006 values) and some of the most pristine examples can be seen annually at the Experimental Aircraft Association fly-in at Oshkosh, Wisconsin.\n\nAircraft museums worldwide are restoring examples for display (such as \"G-AIZE\" at the Royal Air Force Museum at RAF Cosford).\n\n\nToronto Maple Leafs NHL Hockey player Bill Barilko and his dentist Henry Hudson disappeared on August 26, 1951, aboard Hudson's Fairchild 24 floatplane, flying from Seal River, Quebec. On June 6, 1962, helicopter pilot Ron Boyd discovered the wreckage about 100 kilometres (62 mi) north of Cochrane, Ontario, about 35 miles off course. The cause of the crash was deemed to have been a combination of pilot inexperience, poor weather and overloaded cargo.\n\nAlaskan missionary Harold L. Wood (1890-1944) died in his Fairchild 24 floatplane while landing near a logging camp at Kasaan Bay (30 miles northwest of Ketchikan, Alaska) on 24 February 1944. The cause of the crash was deemed to have been a pilot's health problem.\n"}

{"id": "2015895", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2015895", "title": "Newmarket Racecourse", "text": "Newmarket Racecourse\n\nNewmarket Racecourse is a British Thoroughbred horse racing venue in Newmarket, Suffolk, comprising two individual racecourses: the Rowley Mile and the July Course. Newmarket is often referred to as the headquarters of British horseracing and is home to the largest cluster of training yards in the country and many key horse racing organisations, including Tattersalls, the National Horseracing Museum and the National Stud. Newmarket hosts two of the country's five Classic Races - the 1,000 Guineas and 2,000 Guineas, and numerous other Group races. In total, it hosts 9 of British racing's 36 annual Group 1 races.\n\nRacing in Newmarket was recorded in the time of James I. Charles II was known to attend races on Newmarket Heath with his brother, the future James II. The first recorded race was a match for £100 between horses owned by Lord Salisbury and Marquess of Buckingham in 1622. The racecourse itself was founded in 1636. Around 1665, Charles inaugurated the Newmarket Town Plate and in 1671 became the first and only reigning monarch to ride a winner.\nUp until 1744, the two most valuable races run at the course were the King's Plate and the Town Plate. Two more Plate races were added in that year, paid for by local traders, both worth 50 guineas - one was a race for five-year-olds carrying 9 stone, one was an open age race in four mile heats. Another paid for by landowners was a four-year-old race over four miles, each carrying 8 stone 7 lbs. At that time, formal races at Newmarket only took place twice a year - once in April, once in October. A second Spring meeting was added in 1753.\n\nBy 1840, there were seven annual meetings:\n\n\nNewmarket Racecourse is made up of two courses - the Rowley Mile Course (named after Old Rowley the favourite racehorse of King Charles II) and the July Course. Both are wide, galloping tracks used for Flat racing only, each with a capacity just over 20,000, though this is rarely met.\n\n\nTechnically, there is also a third course, the Round Course, but this is only used once a year for the Newmarket Town Plate, a race of great historical significance, but limited importance in modern day racing.\n\nThe Rowley Mile is used for racing in the Spring and Autumn, and hosts the majority of the Group 1 races staged at Newmarket, including the 2000 & 1000 Guineas. Up until 2010, it was the home of the Champion Stakes, Pride Stakes and Jockey Club Cup, which are now run as the Champion Stakes, British Champions Fillies' and Mares' Stakes and British Champions Long Distance Cup at Ascot on British Champions Day. The wide nature of the track means it is able to host races such as the Cambridgeshire Handicap and the Cesarewitch Handicap , which both have a maximum field size of 35, making them the largest fields for races in the UK after the Grand National. In 2005, the Rowley Mile hosted the now defunct Ascot Festival, the premier race of which was the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes, whilst the new grandstand at Ascot was being constructed.\n\nThe July Course is used in Summer, and hosts 2 Group 1 races, the July Cup and the Falmouth Stakes, both of which are run at the July Festival, the premier meeting staged at the July Course. The course is also used for several evening meetings a year, with live music after racing - these often draw a sellout crowd and are typically the highest attended of any meetings held at Newmarket throughout the year. In 1999 the entire Newmarket programme was moved to the July Course whilst the new Millennium Grandstand at the Rowley Mile was being constructed. In 2008, due to waterlogging at York, several races from the Ebor Festival were staged at the July Course, including three Group 1 races - the Yorkshire Oaks, the Nunthorpe and the Juddmonte International.\n\nBoth courses have grass airstrips for use by light aircraft, and it was taking off from one of these in June 2000 that a Piper Seneca plane carrying jockeys Ray Cochrane and Frankie Dettori crashed, killing the pilot and injuring both jockeys. The plane was headed for Goodwood in Sussex. Cochrane received the Queen's Commendation for Bravery in 2002 for saving Dettori's life. The airstrips on the Rowley Mile were used during the Second World War by the Royal Air Force (RAF) as RAF Newmarket- the most important races were moved to the July Course during this period, which was the only racecourse in the UK that remained operational throughout the war.\n\nThe Devil's Dyke runs past the edge of the July course. About half of the racecourse complex, including the July and Cesarewitch/Beacon courses, is actually in the neighbouring county of Cambridgeshire.\n\nHistorically, there are various names that have been given to courses or parts of courses at Newmarket, and some are still in use today to describe particular race distances. Whyte's History of the British Turf (1840), for instance, lists the Beacon Course, Round Course, Audley End Course, Clermont Course, Ancaster Mile, Rowley Mile, Abingdon Mile, Bunbury Mile, Ditch Mile and Yearling Course.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th Century Newmarket also had a National Hunt course. The Links Gallops uses the course today and some of the buildings still stand adjacent to the Gallops and nearby road.\n\nThe King's Plate (or Queen's Plate) was a major race run between 1634 and 1765.\n\n (Location of Carpark)\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2015897", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2015897", "title": "The Stone Guest (Dargomyzhsky)", "text": "The Stone Guest (Dargomyzhsky)\n\nThe Stone Guest (\"Каменный гость\" in Cyrillic, \"Kamennyj gost' \" in transliteration) is an opera in three acts by Alexander Dargomyzhsky from a libretto taken almost verbatim from Alexander Pushkin's 1830 play of the same name which had been written in blank verse and which forms part of his collection \"Little Tragedies\".\n\nIt was first performed at the Mariinsky Theatre, Saint Petersburg, 16 February 1872 (Old Style).\n\nAccording to the composer's wishes, the last few lines of tableau 1 were composed by César Cui, and the whole was orchestrated by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. Many years later, Rimsky-Korsakov revised his own orchestration of the opera, rewrote a few of Dargomyzhsky's own original passages, and added an orchestral prelude. This version, completed in 1903 and first performed in 1907 at the Bolshoi Theatre, is now considered the standard version.\n\nThe United States premiere of the opera was presented by the Chamber Opera Theater of New York at the Marymount Manhattan Theater in New York City in 1986 with Ron Gentry as Don Juan, Randolf Messing as Don Carlos, Sally Stevens as Donna Anna, and Vladimir Kin conducting.\n\nAs an opera, \"The Stone Guest\" is notable for having its text taken almost word-for-word from the literary stage work which inspired it, rather than being set to a libretto adapted from the source in order to accommodate opera audiences which would have expected to hear arias, duets, and choruses. Consequently, the resulting musical drama consists almost entirely of solos given in turn by each character, as in a spoken play.\n\nThis procedure amounted to a radical statement about the demands of spoken and musical drama and was seen by some as a devaluation of the musical genre of opera, and distinct from the literary genre of spoken drama. Tchaikovsky in particular was critical of the idea; in response to Dargomyzhky's statement that \"I want sound directly to express the word. I want truth\", he wrote in his private correspondence that nothing could be so \"hateful and false\" as the attempt to present as musical drama something that was not.\n\nThe opera was written at the time of the formation of realism in art, and \"The Stone Guest\" corresponded to this genre. Dargomyzhsky used the ideas of the society of The Five.\n\nThe great innovations of this opera are seen in its style. It was written without arias and ensembles (not counting two small romances sung by Laura) and it is entirely built on the \"melodic recitative\" of the human voice put to music. This was immediately noted by Russian musical specialists César Cui and Alexander Serov.\n\nOpera has been greatly important in the formation of Russian musical culture which, built entirely on European music, found its place in the world's musical culture.\n\nThe innovations begun by Dargomyzhsky were continued by other composers. Firstly, they were taken up and developed by Modest Mussorgsky who called Dargomyzhsky \"the teacher of musical truth\". Later the principles of Dargomyzhsky’s art were embodied by Mussorgsky in his operas \"Boris Godunov\" and \"Khovanshchina\"; Mussorgsky continued and strengthened this new musical tradition. Other Russians operas have also incorporated the same stylistic elements. These include \"Mozart and Salieri\" by Rimsky-Korsakov in 1898; \"Feast in Time of Plague\" by Cesar Cui in 1901; and \"The Miserly Knight\" by Sergei Rachmaninov in 1904.\n\nThe modern Russian music critic Viktor Korshikov thus summed up:\n\nConsequently, certain musical novelties of \"The Stone Guest\" stem from the above basic premise of composition. For instance, there is little recurrence of whole sections of music in the course of the work; like the verse itself, the resulting music is primarily through-composed. (Rimsky-Korsakov's orchestral introduction to the opera, however, draws on themes from the music that Dargomyzhsky composed.) As if to emphasize this feature, the composer wrote the entire opera without key signatures, even though it would be possible (and practical) to re-notate the work with key signatures to reflect the various tonalities through which it passes.\n\nIn addition, the opera was novel for its time in its use of dissonance and whole-tone scales. Dargomyzhky's attempts at realism and faithfulness to the text resulted in what has been referred to as a \"studied ugliness\" in the music, apparently intended to reflect the actual ugliness in the story. Cui termed the stylistic practice of the work as \"melodic recitative\" for its balance between the lyric and the naturalistic.\n\nAudio\n\nVideo\n\nNotes\nFurther reading\n\n"}

Originally translated by Oliver Latsch, \"Dragon Rider\" was published in 2004 by The Chicken House in the UK and Scholastic Inc. in the US, using a translation by Anthea Bell. \"Dragon Rider\" follows the exploits of a silver dragon named Firedrake, the Brownie Sorrel, and Ben, a human boy, in their search for the mythical part of the Himalayas mountain range called the Rim of Heaven to find a safe place for Firedrake's kin to live when the dragon finds out that humans intend to flood the valley where he and his fellow dragons live. This book has 523 pages and is well-suited to readers aged nine to thirteen.\n\nFiredrake is a young dragon who lives in a hidden valley outside of London with other dragons. After realizing that humans intend to flood the valley and the dragons living there are no longer safe, Firedrake sets off with the guidance from the eldest member of his clan (Slatebeard) to avoid the \"Golden One\" and to find the Rim of Heaven, a legendary location that is a safe heaven for all dragons.\n\nFiredrake travels to Hamburg with his friend Sorrel, a forest brownie, to find Gilbert Graytail, a rat who specializes in making maps. Not long after landing at the docks of Hamburg, Firedrake saves an orphan human Ben from dockworkers. Ben, in repayment for this, then provides Sorrel with human clothes so she may go in disguise to find Gilbert while Firedrake stays hidden. After finding Gilbert and providing payment, Gilbert hands over a map leading to the Himalayas, marking dangerous areas along the way. Only able to fly at night, Firedrake wastes no time wanting to leave. He and Sorrel also decide to bring Ben along with them. After Ben and Sorrel argue about turning East too soon or not, the three end up in a mountain range full of dwarves. Firedrake sleeps while the sun is up and the dwarves wait for him to wake up. While he rests however, one of the dwarves, Gravelbeard, runs to the castle in that same mountain range, revealing Nettlebrand, the Golden One, a fearsome dragon-like monster whose only purpose in life is to hunt, kill and eat dragons and his servant, Twigleg the Homunculus. After hearing of the trio, Nettlebrand decides to follow them, hoping to hunt down and kill the last of the dragons where he failed decades before.\n\nFiredrake, Sorrel and Ben fly onward, but are soon swept off course by a storm, arriving on the shore of Egypt. Encountering a basilisk and a band of zealous archaeologists, the party eventually befriends a kindly scientist named Professor Greenbloom. Sorrel is initially suspicious but soon warms up to him. Professor Greenbloom gives Ben one of two freezing-cold metallic scales he has, which unknown to the humans, once belonged to Nettlebrand. Twigleg relays the news to Nettlebrand, who immediately makes his way to the dig site to find Professor Greenbloom and recover the scales. Meanwhile, the three searchers set out on the advice of the professor to seek the advice of a Djinn, whose thousand eyes can see everything. Ben succeeds in fulfilling the Djinn's arcane requirements with the question: \"Where does the Rim of Heaven lie?\" The answer to the question appears in two of the Djinn's thousand eyes; it is a path, marked by the Indus River, by a mountain range, and by a monastery. Beyond this monastery is the Rim of Heaven. In the monastery, Ben must break the moonlight on the stone dragon's head. The Djinn also gives them a prophecy: \"When that day comes, twenty fingers will point the way to the Rim of Heaven, and silver will be worth more than gold.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Nettlebrand tracks down Greenbloom, who managed to escape him. Twigleg is discovered but is allowed to stay due to his almost-perfect ability to understand and translate any language. He has grown to be very attached to Ben, and he begins relaying false information to his master, sending him into the middle of a desert where he got attacked by the sandmans, who the monster eventually escapes from. While flying over the ocean, a lunar eclipse occurs and Firedrake (who lives off of moonlight), cannot fly. He falls and lands on the back of an initially frightening but amiable sea serpent. She agrees to take the friends to Pakistan, where they will rendezvous with a Dracologist, Zubeida Ghalib. She alone knows a way to help Firedrake fly without moonlight. Along the way, the Serpent tells them (among other things) about Nettlebrand and his army of red-eyed Ravens. As the peaceful voyage atop Serpent-back continues, they are spotted by one of Nettlebrand's raven spies. Annoyed, Sorrel throws a stone which she has smeared her adhesive saliva. The stone sticks to the Raven's wing and sends him panicking to shore. In Pakistan, the friends enter a village where Zubeida the Dracologist is living and also find Professor Greenbloom. His wife and daughter, Guinevere, have joined him on account of the incident with Nettlebrand. Deeply worried, the two parties compare their findings, which all point to a single grim fact—Nettlebrand is hunting the Dragons who live in the Rim of Heaven, and expects Firedrake to find them for him.\n\nDr. Ghalib reveals a legend of a Dragon Rider who once lived in the village. Ben is his reincarnation, and his destiny is to save the silver dragons from a terrible enemy. No sooner have they heard the legend than two more of Nettlebrand's ravens descend on them. Sorrel attempts the saliva trick again, with one variation: a few sparks of Dragon-fire are added to the mix. The stones do not adhere, but the Ravens are indeed changed before the eyes of all, into a few crabs. This new strangeness on the part of Nettlebrand disturbs the searchers, ultimately inducing Twigleg to reveal his original intentions as Nettlebrand's spy. He also reveals Nettlebrand's origin—an alchemist created Nettlebrand as a dragon killing machine to obtain the Dragons' horns which he used in his experiments to create gold. Twigleg, and his eleven other Homunculus brothers, were made as Nettlebrand's caretakers. When the Silver Dragons went into hiding, Nettlebrand killed the alchemist and eventually ate all of Twigleg's brothers, then went hunting on his own.\n\nZubeida showed Firedrake not only the tomb of the original Dragon Rider, but also a specie of flower which collects moonlight in the form of dewdrops on its leaves. Having drunk this \"moon-dew\", Firedrake is able to fly even if there's no moon at all. The two parties split up to lose Nettlebrand's pursuit in the mountains. After a hazardous encounter with a Roc, they are forced off course and must take refuge in a valley. Nettlebrand continues tailing a boat wherein are Professor Greenbloom and his family, knowing they will lead him to Firedrake, but is seen by Guinevere.\n\nIn the valley, help comes to Firedrake and company in the form of Lola Graytail, Gilbert's niece. Lola had been cartographing the country for her uncle and she guides them to the monastery. There, they are welcomed by the monks, who look on Firedrake as a bringer of good fortune. Also it is here that Ben \"breaks the moonlight\"--- actually a moonstone kept by the monks for this purpose. Ben shatters the moonstone and summons the aid of a four-armed brownie, named Burr-Burr-Chan. He agrees to guide Firedrake, Sorrel, Twigleg, and Ben to the Rim of Heaven. He warns, however, that Firedrake's kin have degenerated into earthbound cowards as a result of hiding from Nettlebrand. Whilst waiting for the moment of departure, the company discover Gravelbeard (who was threatened by Nettlebrand into becoming another spy) but fail to catch him. They fly on their way swiftly, with Nettlebrand in pursuit. To Twigleg's dismay, in the center of the Rim of Heaven is a great lake, a perfect gateway for Nettlebrand, who can travel instantaneously by water. To make sure that he is right, Lola takes Twigleg in her miniature airplane to investigate and distract Nettlebrand, while above the others seek the Dragons' cave. There, they meet with a she-Dragon, Maia. She is the only living dragon there, as the other twenty-two have since turned into stone through lack of moonlight.\n\nOutside, Lola and Twigleg found Gravelbeard. In the struggle that follows, the Dwarf's hat (which functions as an altitude compensator), is taken by Twigleg. Promptly Gravelbeard is struck with mountain sickness, allowing himself to be taken a prisoner. Nettlebrand, who now knows their location, is coming. No one knows how they could ever stop him since he is twenty times as strong as one dragon as well as immune to other dragons' firepower. In disgust, Sorrel spits on the golden scale which the Professor gave to Ben. Inspired by his success with the Ravens, Firedrake breathes fire on it and reduces it to gold paint. Twigleg comes up with a plan. He pretends to be still loyal to Nettelbrand and frees Gravelbeard then sent him back to Nettlebrand. The Golden One, elated by upcoming success, orders the Dwarf to polish his armor. Unfortunately for Nettlebrand, the armor polish has been replaced with Brownie spits. When Nettlebrand enters the cave, he was at once dive-bombed by Firedrake, Maia, and Lola in her plane. At last, the Dragons came together and set Nettlebrand afire. The Brownie spits reacted at once, dissolving Nettlebrand's armor and destroying him. Nettlebrand melts to reveal nothing but a toad underneath. As the company stare in wonder at this transformation, Gravelbeard enters. He has seen the marvelous gemstones and rock formations in the cave, and wishes to enhance them with his own skill, revealing that doing so will bring the petrified dragons back to life. Within a few days, all the silver dragons are awakened again. Firedrake and Maia went flying with Sorrel and Burr-Burr-Chan to bring the other members of their species back home. Ben and Twigleg went to live with Professor Greenbloom and his family. Two months later, news reached the humans that Firedrake has convinced the silver dragons to come with him to the Rim of Heaven. Eager to see their friends again, Ben and Guinevere occupy their time with other investigations of \"imaginary\" creatures until they can visit the silver dragons again.\n\n\"Dragon Rider\" ranked #21 of the New York Times children's books bestseller list in September 2004.\n\nIn late 2015, Cornelia Funke divulged details on a sequel to \"Dragon Rider\", titled \"A Griffin's Feather\". The sequel would be set two years following the first book, with Ben living with the Greenblooms at a creature refuge founded in Norway. The book was published in Germany under the title \"Drachenreiter: Die Feder eines Greifs\" on 23 September 2016, with the hopes of releasing it in English the following year in 2017. \"Dragon Rider: The Griffin's Feather\" was published on 5 July 2017. Funke also announced plans for a third book, tentatively titled \"The Volcano Adventure\", which would be told like a graphic novel, along with mobile phone interaction.\n\nOn 31 October 2016, Cornelia Funke posted on social medias that she was meeting with a director for an animated adaptation of \"Dragon Rider\". \"Dragon Rider\" is being produced by Constantin Film and Rise Pictures. Release is scheduled for summer 2019.\n"}

{"id": "2015914", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2015914", "title": "Darko Rundek", "text": "Darko Rundek\n\nDarko Rundek (born 30 January 1956) is a Croatian rock singer, songwriter, poet, and actor. His music career started in the early 1980s, as the frontman of the world music influenced rock band Haustor. He emigrated to France after the Balkan war started in 1991, and has recorded five albums with various musicians from different parts of the world: \"Apokalipso\", \"U širokom svijetu\", \"Ruke\", \"MHM A-HA OH YEAH DA-DA\" and \"Plavi avion\".\n\nIn 1979, Srđan Sacher (bass) and Darko Rundek (guitar and vocals) formed Haustor with Zoran Perišić (drums) and Ozren Štiglić (guitar). Damir Prica (saxophone), Nikola Santro (trombone), and Zoran Vuletić (keyboards) completed the original Haustor line-up. They were open to reggae, Latin American music and African music influences and were one of the top bands of the rock scene in Yugoslavia, performing numerous concerts to thousands of spectators.\n\nThe band released four studio-recorded albums during the 80's: \"Haustor\" in 1981, \"Treći Svijet\" (Third world) in 1984, \"Bolero\" in 1985 and \"Tajni Grad\" (Secret Town) in 1988; three singles: 'Moja prva ljubav' (My first love) in 1980, 'Zima' (Winter) in 1981 and 'Radio' in 1982. The live album \"Ulje je na vodi\" (Oil on the water) was recorded in 1982 and released in 1995, and \"81–'88\" (a 'Best of' compilation) was released in 1995.\n\nIn 1982, Rundek obtained his diploma in theatre directing from the Academy of Dramatic Arts in Zagreb with his graduation performance of America Hurray! by J.C. Van Italie. He went on to direct a number of plays (They say the Owl Once Was the Baker's Daughter; Three Slaps, Satires from Hekuba, No, Ballads of Petrica Kerempuh...), and also appeared occasionally as an actor. Darko's principal role in the theatre remains that of composer, with more than 30 productions to his credit, ranging from intimate children's theatre to international touring performances.\n\nSince 1991, he has been living in France. In 1995, Rundek started his solo career at the Croatian music festival Fiju Briju in front of an audience of 10,000 people. He presented new musical material which was to be developed during the following series of concerts throughout Croatia.\n\nIn 1997 the album \"Apokalipso\" (apocalypse+calypso) was recorded with a multitude of instruments and musicians and with strong support from the record company Jabukaton. The album was stylistically very diverse, viewing the post-communist era with irony and poetry. Apokalipso was the music event of 1997 in Croatia. It won 5 Porins (song of the year, hit of the year, best male singer, best video clip, best vocal collaboration), and 4 Black Cats (song of the year for Apokalipso, best rock singer, best rock collaboration, best video clip).\n\nThe album \"U širokom svijetu\" turned more towards folkloric influences. Mandolin, bag pipes and tin whistle enhanced the eclectic style of the songs. The atmosphere became intimate and more introspective. The band became more stable and toured in Croatia and other ex-Yugoslavian countries.\n\nThe project initially stemmed from Darko Rundek's song.It grew out of the need to develop ideas in collaboration with other musicians through improvisation and exchange. Isabel, Đani Pervan, Dušan Vranić and Vedran Peternel started working on Darko Rundek's new songs; Isabel's mill in Burgundy in France, with her collection of exotic instruments, provided the working environment. They also incorporate a musical tradition with a potential for accepting diverse influences, firstly Balkan music, Central European music and Mediterranean, then reggae, Latin American, eastern and African music. Isabel (Swiss violinist), Đani Pervan (percussionist), Dušan Vranić (pianist), Vedran Peternel (sound-designer) and Darko, undertook a ten-day improvisation session in Isabel's converted watermill on the outskirts of a small Burgundian village. When they finally laid down their instruments, they had the basis of the album Ruke (documented by the camera of Biljana Tutorov, whose video projections have become a feature of Cargo Orkestar's concerts). Trumpetist Igor Pavlica (Darko's old collaborator from the Haustor and solo periods), Emmanuel Ferraz (trombone player), and the bass player Bruno Arnal, joined Cargo Orkestar for the promotional tour in 2002. In 2004 \"Ruke\" was published by Piranha Musik – Berlin, and distributed in 25 countries. \n\nIn 2004, the live album \"Zagrebačka magla\" was released under the Menart-Zagreb label, and \"Mhm A-Ha Oh Yeah Da-Da\" was published in 2006 by German record label Piranha. For the concerts, Cargo mixes new and old from the rich repertoire of Rundek songs. The informal and open feel is as remarkable in small concert halls as it is in large stadiums.\nOne year later, the album was recorded and simultaneously released by record labels Menart in Croatia and Metropolis in Serbia. Some songs are co-signed by different members of the group. On the promotion tour the band was completed with three more musicians and gradually developed into Darko Rundek & Cargo Orkestar.\n\nRundek has written and produced film music, and occasionally appeared as an actor (Doctor Kljaić in A View from Eiffel Tower), by N. Vukčević; Karlo in \"100 minuta Slave\", by D. Matanić; Youngster in The Eagle (Orao), by Z. Tadić, Marjan film). He played Herman in J. Burgerfor's film Ruins (Ruševine), for which he was awarded best male film actor in Slovenia.\n\nBetween 1982 and 1991, Darko Rundek directed around 50 radio-plays and documentaries for the drama department of radio Zagreb, for which he also wrote the music. Some of these represented radio Zagreb at various international festivals: Prix Italia, Premios Ondas and Prix Futura.\n\n"}

From 1924 to 1927, he attended Lafayette High School, where he was taught by art instructor Elizabeth Weiffenbach, who later (1936-1939) also influenced the style of science-fiction cover artist Kelly Freas. Shanks began his employment with the \"Buffalo Evening News\" as a copy boy. His first cartoons appeared in the sports pages.\n\nOne character created by Shanks was Olaf Fub, a name derived from \"Buffalo\" spelled backward.

It was first featured as the segment \"The Night\" on the album \"Days of Future Passed\". When first released as a single in 1967, it reached number 19 on the UK Singles Chart and number 103 in the United States in 1968. It was the first significant chart entry by the band since \"Go Now\" and its recent lineup change, in which Denny Laine and Clint Warwick had resigned and both Hayward and John Lodge had joined.\n\nWhen reissued in 1972, in the United States the single hit number two – for two weeks – on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 (behind \"I Can See Clearly Now\" by Johnny Nash) and hit number one on the \"Cash Box\" Top 100. It earned a gold certification for sales of over a million U.S. copies. It also hit number one in Canada. After two weeks at #2, it was replaced by \"I'd Love You to Want Me\" by Lobo. It reached its highest UK position this year at number 9. The song again charted in the UK in 1979 reaching number 14. \n\nThe song charted again in 2010, reaching number 51 in the British Official Singles Charts.\n\nBand member Justin Hayward wrote and composed the song at age 19 in Swindon, and titled the song after a girlfriend gave him a gift of satin bedsheets. The song itself was a tale of a yearning love from afar, which leads many aficionados to term it as a tale of unrequited love endured by Hayward. Hayward said of the song, \"It was just another song I was writing and I thought it was very powerful. It was a very personal song and every note, every word in it means something to me and I found that a lot of other people have felt that very same way about it.\"\n\nThe London Festival Orchestra provided the orchestral accompaniment for the introduction, the final rendition of the chorus, and the \"final lament\" section, all of which were in the original album version. The \"orchestral\" sounds in the main body of the song were actually produced by Mike Pinder's Mellotron keyboard device, which would come to define the \"Moody (Blues)'s signature sound\".\n\nThe song is written in the key of E minor and features the Neapolitan chord (F).\n\nThe two single versions of the song were both stripped of the orchestral and \"Late Lament\" poetry sections of the LP version. The first edited version, with the songwriter's credit shown as \"Redwave\", was a hasty-sounding 3:06 version of the LP recording with very noticeable chopped parts. However, many versions of the single are listed on the labels at 3:06, but in fact are closer to the later version of 4:26.\n\nSome versions, instead of ending cold as most do, segue briefly into the symphonic second half (\"Late Lament\") and, in fact, run for 4:33 (but are also listed on the label as 3:06). For the second edited version (with the song's writing credited to Hayward), the early parts of the song were kept intact, ending early at 4:26. Most single versions were backed with a non-LP B-side, \"Cities\".\n\nAlthough it only had limited commercial success on its first release, the song has since garnered much critical acclaim, ranking number 36 in BBC Radio 2's \"Sold on Song Top 100\" list.\n\nThe spoken-word poem heard near the six-minute mark of the album version of the song is called \"Late Lament\". Drummer Graeme Edge wrote the verses, which were recited by keyboardist Mike Pinder. On \"Days of Future Passed,\" the poem's last five lines bracket the album and also appear at the end of track 1 (\"The Day Begins\").\n\nWhile it has been commonly known as part of \"Nights in White Satin\" with no separate credit on the original LP, \"Late Lament\" was given its own listing on the two-LP compilation \"This Is The Moody Blues\" in 1974 and again in 1987 (without its parent song) on another compilation, \"Prelude.\" Both compilations feature the track in a slightly different form than on \"Days of Future Passed,\" giving both spoken and instrumental tracks an echo effect. The orchestral ending is kept intact, but mastering engineers edited out the gong (struck by Mike Pinder) that closes the track on the original LP.\n\nFrom 1992 through the early 2000s, the Moody Blues toured with shows backed by live orchestras. When with orchestral accompaniment, they often took the opportunity to include \"Late Lament\" in the performance of \"Nights in White Satin\". On these occasions, Edge recited it himself, since Pinder was no longer in the band at that time.\n\n\n\nThe work was reinterpreted as the focus of , a dark ride at the Hard Rock Park theme park in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, U.S.A. The attraction, which included 3D-black light and fiber-optic lighting effects and purpose-made films, was developed by Sally Corporation and Jon Binkowski of Hard Rock Park. Riders entered through a bead curtain and were provided with 3D glasses.\n\nThe attraction operated as \"The Trip\" for the single 2008 season the park operated as Hard Rock Park, but was rethemed as \"Monstars of Rock\" with the sale and retitling of the park as Freestyle Music Park; \"park officials said the experience will be similar but the presentation will be changed.\" Freestyle Music Park would cease operations after its only season as such in 2009.\n\n\"Nights in White Satin\" was the title of a 1987 film directed by Michael Barnard, and starring Kip Gilman and Priscilla Harris. The Moody Blues recording of the song was featured prominently in the soundtrack, particularly during a rooftop dance sequence.\n\nLos Angeles punk rock band the Dickies recorded a speedy cover of the song for their 1979 LP Dawn of the Dickies (A&M Records). Released as a single, it charted in the top 40 on the UK singles charts.\n\nA pop-rock cover version was performed by the German singer Sandra. The song appeared on Sandra's sixth studio album \"Fading Shades\" (1995).\n\nIt was produced by Michael Cretu and received mixed reception from music critics. The song was released as the lead single in the spring of 1995 (see 1995 in music), although it failed to match the success of Sandra's previous singles. The song peaked at #1 in Israel (spending two weeks at the top), #17 in Finland, and #34 in New Zealand (Sandra's only charting hit there).\nIn Germany it only peaked at #86, becoming her least successful lead single in that country to date. In the United Kingdom, it failed to enter the chart.\n\nThe music video, directed by Angel Hart, showed only close ups of Sandra's face as she was pregnant at the time. She even had to sit during the recording sessions of the album. (Note that the \"Fading Shades\" album cover was taken from the music video.)\n\n"}

In 1887, he argued that Islam had been more successful than Christianity in \"civilizing\" Africa and ridding the \"Dark Continent\" of cannibalism, devil worship, human sacrifice, witchcraft, infanticide, and bad hygiene. Cheers followed not Taylor's lecture—made to a British audience primarily of Anglican missionary supporters—but the remarks made by the speakers who followed him and denounced his theories. In the same address, delivered to the Wolverhampton Church Congress in 1887, Taylor argued that \"Islam, above all, is the most powerful total abstinence society in the world; whereas the extension of European trade means the extension of drunkenness and vice, and the degradation of the people.\" Ultimately, Taylor's comments were made based upon the racist assumptions of Islamicist controversialists, including the famous traveller and writer Richard Burton that the lower races were better adapted to respond to the message of Islam than that of Christianity.\n\nIn 1890, Taylor published \"Origin of the Aryans\", in which he proposed the \"round-head theory,\" in which he argued that European Russia was the homeland of all of the Indo-European peoples, in opposition to the assertion of Max Müller, who had argued for Central Asia. Taylor believed that the Celts (tall stature, round heads), a branch of the ancient Finns, were the only true Aryans who had \"Aryanized\" the Iberians (short stature, long heads), the Scandinavians (tall stature, long heads), and the Ligurians (short stature, round heads).\n\nIn regards to the origin of the Basques, Taylor believed that they were direct descendants of the Etruscans. Taylor’s theories on the Etruscans, though now obsolete, caused great interest at the time that they were presented. He believed that the Etruscan language belonged to the Altaic language group, and that Etruscan mythology was fundamental to that presented in the Kalevala, the great Finnish epic.\n\nIn his \"Names and Their Histories\" (1898), Taylor presented an impressive survey of local, foreign, and national names. Though many of his toponymic theories have been discounted, he laid the groundwork for future research in this then-new discipline.\n\n"}

{"id": "2015980", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2015980", "title": "Indian logic", "text": "Indian logic\n\nThe development of Indian logic dates back to the \"anviksiki\" of Medhatithi Gautama (c. 6th century BCE); the Sanskrit grammar rules of Pāṇini (c. 5th century BCE); the Vaisheshika school's analysis of atomism (c. 6th century BCE to 2nd century BCE); the analysis of inference by Gotama (c. 6th century BC to 2nd century CE), founder of the Nyaya school of Hindu philosophy; and the tetralemma of Nagarjuna (c. 2nd century CE). \n\nIndian logic stands as one of the three original traditions of logic, alongside the Greek and the Chinese logic. The Indian tradition continued to develop through early to modern times, in the form of the Navya-Nyāya school of logic.\n\nThe Nasadiya Sukta of the \"Rigveda\" (RV 10.129) contains ontological speculation in terms of various logical divisions that were later recast formally as the four circles of \"catuskoti\": \"A\", \"not A\", \"A and 'not A'\", and \"not A and not not A\".\n\nMedhatithi Gautama (c. 6th century BCE) founded the \"anviksiki\" school of logic. The \"Mahabharata\" (12.173.45), around the 4th century BCE to 4th century CE, refers to the \"anviksiki\" and \"tarka\" schools of logic. (c. 5th century BCE) developed a form of logic (to which Boolean logic has some similarities) for his formulation of Sanskrit grammar. Logic is described by Chanakya (c. 350-283 BCE) in his \"Arthashastra\" as an independent field of inquiry \"anviksiki\".\n\nVaisheshika, also Vaisesika, (Sanskrit: वैशेषिक) is one of the six Hindu schools of Indian philosophy. It came to be closely associated with the Hindu school of logic, Nyaya. Vaisheshika espouses a form of atomism and postulates that all objects in the physical universe are reducible to a finite number of atoms. Originally proposed by Kanāda (or Kana-bhuk, literally, atom-eater) from around the 2nd century BCE.\n\nIn the 2nd century, the Buddhist philosopher Nagarjuna refined the \"Catuskoti\" form of logic. The Catuskoti is also often glossed \"Tetralemma\" (Greek) which is the name for a largely comparable, but not equatable, 'four corner argument' within the tradition of Classical logic.\n\n\"Nyāya\" (\"ni-āyá\", literally \"recursion\", used in the sense of \"syllogism, inference\") is the name given to one of the six orthodox or \"astika\" schools of Hindu philosophy — specifically the school of logic.\n\nThe Nyaya school of philosophical speculation is based on texts known as the \"Nyaya Sutras\", which were written by Gotama in around the 2nd century CE. The most important contribution made by the Nyaya school to modern Hindu thought is its methodology. This methodology is based on a system of logic that has subsequently been adopted by most of the other Indian schools (orthodox or not), much in the same way that Western philosophy can be said to be largely based on Aristotelian logic.\n\nFollowers of Nyaya believed that obtaining valid knowledge was the only way to obtain release from suffering. They therefore took great pains to identify valid sources of knowledge and to distinguish these from mere false opinions. According to the Nyaya school, there are exactly four sources of knowledge (pramanas): perception, inference, comparison and testimony. Knowledge obtained through each of these can, of course, still be either valid or invalid. As a result, Nyaya scholars again went to great pains to identify, in each case, what it took to make knowledge valid, in the process creating a number of explanatory schemes. In this sense, Nyaya is probably the closest Indian equivalent to contemporary analytic philosophy.\n\nJainism made its own unique contribution to this mainstream development of logic by also occupying itself with the basic epistemological issues, namely, with those concerning the nature of knowledge, how knowledge is derived, and in what way knowledge can be said to be reliable. Jain logic developed and flourished from 6th century BCE to 17th century CE. According to Jains, the ultimate principle should always be logical and no principle can be devoid of logic or reason. Thus one finds in the , deliberative exhortations on any subject in all its facts, may they be constructive or obstructive, inferential or analytical, enlightening or destructive. The Jains have doctrines of relativity used for logic and reasoning:\n\nThese Jain philosophical concepts made most important contributions to the ancient Indian philosophy, especially in the areas of skepticism and relativity.\n\nFollowing is the list of Jain philosophers who contributed to Jain Logic:\n\nIndian Buddhist logic (called Pramana) flourished from about 500 CE up to 1300 CE. The three main authors of Buddhist logic are Vasubandhu (400–800 CE), Dignāga (480–540 CE), and Dharmakīrti (600–660 CE). The most important theoretical achievements are the doctrine of Trairūpya (Skrt. त्रैरूप्य) and the highly formal scheme of the Hetucakra (Skrt. हेतुचक्र) (\"Wheel of Reasons\") given by Dignāga. There is a still living tradition of Buddhist logic in the Tibetan Buddhist traditions, where logic is an important part of the education of monks.\n\nThe Navya-Nyāya or Neo-Logical darśana (school) of Indian philosophy was founded in the 13th century CE by the philosopher Gangesha Upadhyaya of Mithila. It was a development of the classical Nyāya darśana. Other influences on Navya-Nyāya were the work of earlier philosophers Vācaspati Miśra (900–980 CE) and Udayana (late 10th century).\n\nGangeśa's book Tattvacintāmaṇi (\"Thought-Jewel of Reality\") was written partly in response to Śrīharśa's Khandanakhandakhādya, a defence of Advaita Vedānta, which had offered a set of thorough criticisms of Nyāya theories of thought and language. In his book, Gangeśa both addressed some of those criticisms and – more importantly – critically examined the Nyāya darśana himself. He held that, while Śrīharśa had failed successfully to challenge the Nyāya realist ontology, his and Gangeśa's own criticisms brought out a need to improve and refine the logical and linguistic tools of Nyāya thought, to make them more rigorous and precise.\n\nTattvacintāmani dealt with all the important aspects of Indian philosophy, logic, set theory, and especially epistemology, which Gangeśa examined rigorously, developing and improving the Nyāya scheme, and offering examples. The results, especially his analysis of cognition, were taken up and used by other darśanas.\n\nNavya-Nyāya developed a sophisticated language and conceptual scheme that allowed it to raise, analyse, and solve problems in logic and epistemology. It systematised all the Nyāya concepts into four main categories: sense or perception (pratyakşa), inference (anumāna), comparison or similarity (upamāna), and testimony (sound or word; śabda).\n\nThis later school began around eastern India and Bengal, and developed theories resembling modern logic, such as Gottlob Frege's \"distinction between sense and reference of proper names\" and his \"definition of number,\" as well as the Navya-Nyaya theory of \"restrictive conditions for universals\" anticipating some of the developments in modern set theory. Udayana in particular developed theories on \"restrictive conditions for universals\" and \"infinite regress\" that anticipated aspects of modern set theory. According to Kisor Kumar Chakrabarti:\n\nIn the late 18th-century British scholars began to take an interest in Indian philosophy and discovered the sophistication of the Indian study of inference. This process culminated in Henry T. Colebrooke's \"The Philosophy of the Hindus: On the Nyaya and Vaisesika Systems\" in 1824, which provided an analysis of inference and comparison to the received Aristotelian logic, resulting in the observation that the Aristotelian syllogism could not account for the Indian syllogism. Max Mueller contributed an appendix to the 1853 edition of Thomson's \"Outline of the Laws of Thought\", in which he placed Greek and Indian logic on the same plane: \"The sciences of Logic and Grammar were, as far as history allows us to judge, invented or originally conceived by two nations only, by Hindus and Greeks.\"\n\nJonardon Ganeri has observed that this period saw George Boole (1815-1864) and Augustus De Morgan (1806-1871) make their pioneering applications of algebraic ideas to the formulation of logic (such as algebraic logic and Boolean logic), and has suggested that these figures were likely to be aware of these studies in xeno-logic, and further that their acquired awareness of the shortcomings of propositional logic are likely to have stimulated their willingness to look outside the system.\n\nIndian logic attracted the attention of many Western scholars, and had an influence on pioneering 19th-century logicians such as Charles Babbage (1791-1871), Augustus De Morgan, and particularly George Boole, as confirmed by Boole's wife Mary Everest Boole in an \"open letter to Dr Bose\" titled \"Indian Thought and Western Science in the Nineteenth Century\" written in 1901:\n\nDe Morgan himself wrote in 1860 of the significance of Indian logic: \"The two races which have founded the mathematics, those of the Sanscrit and Greek languages, have been the two which have independently formed systems of logic.\"\n\nMathematicians became aware of the influence of Indian mathematics on the European. For example, Hermann Weyl wrote: \"Occidental mathematics has in past centuries broken away from the Greek view and followed a course which seems to have originated in India and which has been transmitted, with additions, to us by the Arabs; in it the concept of number appears as logically prior to the concepts of geometry. [...] But the present trend in mathematics is clearly in the direction of a return to the Greek standpoint; we now look upon each branch of mathematics as determining its own characteristic domain of quantities.\"\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2015982", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2015982", "title": "Ignition coil", "text": "Ignition coil\n\nAn ignition coil (also called a spark coil) is an induction coil in an automobile's ignition system that transforms the battery's low voltage to the thousands of volts needed to create an electric spark in the spark plugs to ignite the fuel. Some coils have an internal resistor, while others rely on a resistor wire or an external resistor to limit the current flowing into the coil from the car's 12-volt supply. The wire that goes from the ignition coil to the distributor and the high voltage wires that go from the distributor to each of the spark plugs are called spark plug wires or high tension leads. Originally, every ignition coil system required mechanical contact breaker points and a capacitor (condenser). More recent electronic ignition systems use a power transistor to provide pulses to the ignition coil. A modern passenger automobile may use one ignition coil for each engine cylinder (or pair of cylinders), eliminating fault-prone spark plug cables and a distributor to route the high voltage pulses. \n\nIgnition systems are not required for diesel engines which rely on compression to ignite the fuel/air mixture.\n\nAn ignition coil consists of a laminated iron core surrounded by two coils of copper wire. Unlike a power transformer, an ignition coil has an open magnetic circuit — the iron core does not form a closed loop around the windings. The energy that is stored in the magnetic field of the core is the energy that is transferred to the spark plug. \n\nThe primary winding has relatively few turns of heavy wire. The secondary winding consists of thousands of turns of smaller wire, insulated from the high voltage by enamel on the wires and layers of oiled paper insulation. The coil is usually inserted into a metal can or plastic case with insulated terminals for the high voltage and low voltage connections. When the contact breaker closes, it allows current from the battery to flow through the primary winding of the ignition coil. The current does not flow instantly because of the inductance of the coil. Current flowing in the coil produces a magnetic field in the core and in the air surrounding the core. The current must flow long enough to store enough energy in the field for the spark. Once the current has built up to its full level, the contact breaker opens. Since it has a capacitor connected across it, the primary winding and the capacitor form a tuned circuit, and as the stored energy oscillates between the inductor formed by the coil and the capacitor, the changing magnetic field in the core of the coil induces a much larger voltage in the secondary of the coil. More modern electronic ignition systems operate on exactly the same principle, but some rely on charging the capacitor to around 400 volts rather than charging the inductance of the coil. The timing of the opening of the contacts (or switching of the transistor) must be matched to the position of the piston in the cylinder so that the spark may be timed to ignite the air/fuel mixture to extract the most angular momentum possible. This is usually several degrees before the piston reaches top dead center. The contacts are driven off a shaft that is driven by the engine camshaft, or, if electronic ignition is used, a sensor on the engine shaft controls the timing of the pulses.\n\nThe amount of energy in the spark required to ignite the air-fuel mixture varies depending on the pressure and composition of the mixture, and on the speed of the engine. Under laboratory conditions as little as 1 millijoule is required in each spark, but practical coils must deliver much more energy than this to allow for higher pressure, rich or lean mixtures, losses in ignition wiring, and plug fouling and leakage. When gas velocity is high in the spark gap, the arc between the terminals is blown away from the terminals, making the arc longer and requiring more energy in each spark. Between 30 and 70 milli-joules are delivered in each spark.\n\nFormerly, ignition coils were made with varnish and paper insulated high-voltage windings, inserted into a drawn-steel can and filled with oil or asphalt for insulation and moisture protection. Coils on modern automobiles are cast in filled epoxy resins which penetrate any voids within the winding. \n\nA modern single-spark system has one coil per spark plug. To prevent premature sparking at the start of the primary pulse, a diode or secondary spark gap is installed in the coil to block the reverse pulse that would otherwise form. \n\nIn a coil meant for a wasted spark system, the secondary winding has two terminals isolated from the primary, and each terminal connects to a spark plug. With this system, no extra diode is needed since there would be no fuel-air mixture present at the inactive spark plug.\n\nIn a low-inductance coil, fewer primary turns are used, so primary current is higher. This is not compatible with the capacity of mechanical breaker points, so solid-state switching is used.\n\nEarly gasoline (petrol) internal combustion engines used a magneto ignition system, since no battery was fitted to the vehicle; magnetos are still used in piston-engine aircraft to keep the engine running in the event of an electrical failure. The voltage produced by a magneto is dependent on the speed of the engine, making starting difficult. A battery-operated coil can provide a high-voltage spark even at low speeds, making starting easier. When batteries became common in automobiles for cranking and lighting, the ignition coil system displaced magneto ignition. \n\nIn older vehicles, a single coil would serve all the spark plugs via the ignition distributor. Notable exceptions are the Saab 92, some Volkswagens, and the Wartburg 353 which have one ignition coil per cylinder. The flat twin cylinder 1948 Citroën 2CV used one double ended coil without a distributor, and just contact breakers, in a wasted spark system.\n\nIn modern systems, the distributor is omitted and ignition is instead electronically controlled. Much smaller coils are used with one coil for each spark plug or one coil serving two spark plugs (for example two coils in a four-cylinder engine, or three coils in a six-cylinder engine). A large ignition coil puts out about 40 kV, and a small one such as from a lawn mower puts out about 15 kV. These coils may be remotely mounted or they may be placed on top of the spark plug, known as direct ignition (DI) or coil-on-plug. Where one coil serves two spark plugs (in two cylinders), it is through the wasted spark system. In this arrangement, the coil generates two sparks per cycle to both cylinders. The fuel in the cylinder that is nearing the end of its compression stroke is ignited, whereas the spark in its companion that is nearing the end of its exhaust stroke has no effect. The wasted spark system is more reliable than a single coil system with a distributor and less expensive than coil-on-plug.\n\nWhere coils are individually applied per cylinder, they may all be contained in a single molded block with multiple high-tension terminals. This is commonly called a coil-pack.\n\nA bad coil pack may cause a misfire, bad fuel consumption or loss of power.\n\n\n\n\nHow to check Ignition Coil Failure\n"}

The invasion ended the Pagan Empire, which disintegrated into several small kingdoms.\n\nThe battle was initiated by the Mongol Yuan dynasty, which sensed opportunity in the political turmoil caused by their successful 1283 invasion of the Pagan Empire in the Battle of Bhamo. After Bhamo, the Mongol army penetrated the Irrawaddy River valley and established garrisons there. The political turmoil of these events tempted Kublai Khan's grandson Esen-Temür, who was stationed in Yunnan, into action. Temür led a large army down the Irrawaddy river valley and captured the capital city Pagan, also sending military parties across the country to ensure submission.\n\nThe Burmese king Narathihapate fled Pagan to Lower Burma prior to the battle, and the Burmese defense collapsed. The king is remembered in Burmese history as \"Tayokpyemin\" (lit. \"the king who ran away from the Chinese\"). In Lower Burma, the king was promptly assassinated by one of his sons, Thihathu of Prome.\n\nThe 250-year-old Pagan Empire now disintegrated. The kingdom was fractured into several small power centers as the Mongols did not fill the power vacuum in the searing Irrawaddy valley. The Mongol army instead stayed farther north in Tagaung (present-day northern Mandalay Region).\n\nIn central Burma, another son of Narathihapate, Kyawswa, was installed as king by dowager queen Saw. But Kyawswa controlled only the immediate surrounding area of Pagan. Even in central Burma, the real power rested with three Pagan military commanders who through their small but well-disciplined army controlled the Kyaukse district, the most important granary of Pagan. Kyawswa had no choice but to recognize them as lords of Kyaukse. The brothers increasingly acted like sovereigns. Nearly ten years after the fall of Pagan, Kyawswa decided to become a Mongol vassal in January 1297. He received official Mongol recognition as the ruler of Burma in March 1298. Unsatisfied with their reduced status, the brothers dethroned Kyawswa in December 1298, and founded the Myinsaing Kingdom, officially ending the Pagan Kingdom. The Mongol army's effort to install their new nominee, one of Kyawswa's sons, to the Pagan throne in 1301 was unsuccessful. Two years later, in 1303, the Yuan court decided to withdraw completely from Upper Burma, and the Mongol army left Tagaung.\n\n"}
{"id": "2015999", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2015999", "title": "Georgia Railroad and Banking Company", "text": "Georgia Railroad and Banking Company\n\nThe Georgia Railroad and Banking Company also seen as \"GARR\", was a historic railroad and banking company that operated in the U.S. state of Georgia. In 1967 it reported 833 million revenue-ton-miles of freight and 3 million passenger-miles; at the end of the year it operated of road and of track.\n\nThe company was chartered in 1833 in Augusta, Georgia. In 1835, the charter was amended to include banking. Originally the line was chartered to build a railroad from Augusta to Athens, with a branch to Madison. It was converted to in 1886.\n\nThe gauge railroad opened in 1845 with J. Edgar Thomson as its Chief Engineer and Richard Peters as its first Superintendent.\n\nAt that time the rates were as follows:\n\nSeveral other railroads were then under construction: \n\nThe Georgia Railroad decided to extend the Madison branch to Terminus (Atlanta) and thereby compete with the Central Railroad and Banking Company of Georgia (later the Central of Georgia Railroad), which together with the Macon & Western Railroad, was competing for traffic through Charleston's rival port of Savannah, Georgia. By 1850, this railroad had built of track and was up to by 1860. At the time, goods from the Mississippi and Ohio valleys had to go by riverboat to New Orleans and then via coastal steamships around the Florida Keys, to get to the big population centers in the Northeast. Shipping cross-country by rail to the ports of Charleston and Savannah made perfect economic sense.\n\nThe banking side of the business was quickly more successful than the railroad side. The Georgia Railroad & Banking Company was perhaps the strongest bank in Georgia for many years. The bankers used some of their wealth to buy controlling interests in the Atlanta & West Point Railroad (A&WP) and the Western Railway of Alabama (WofA), which provided a continuous line from Atlanta to Montgomery, Alabama, although the WofA was standard gauge, while all the other lines in the South were broad gauge.\n\nDuring the American Civil War, the Confederate States of America maintained a gunpowder factory in Augusta. Carloads of gunpowder would be transported on the Georgia Railroad to various battlefields in the \"Western Campaign.\"\n\nAlthough the Civil War saw heavy damage to railroads such as the Georgia Railroad, management used their considerable resources to restore operation as quickly as possible. The Georgia Railroad even resorted to temporarily abandoning the Athens branch to secure enough rail to reopen its main line. Returning Confederate soldiers were given free rides home, to the extent that the company's limited rail network would allow.\n\nThey also honored all Confederate scrip issued by their bank. No depositor lost their savings even if Confederate money had no value. It helped that the Georgia Railroad and Banking Company had the financial strength to honor those promises. At that time, most Southern banks were repudiating any obligations related to Confederate currency. This helped to solidify the bank's reputation as one of the premier banks in the southeastern United States, well into the 20th century.\n\nThe Georgia Railroad Freight Depot, designed by architect Max Corput, was completed in 1869 and is the oldest building in Downtown Atlanta. The company was later re-chartered as the Georgia Railroad Bank, then a subsidiary of the First Railroad and Banking Company, which eventually opened banks in Atlanta under the name of First Georgia Bank. The banking operations were merged with First Union in 1986 and First Union subsequently merged with Wachovia Corporation (now Wells Fargo).\n\nThe Georgia Railroad Bank entered the insurance business using subsidiaries such as First of Georgia, however these were subsequently sold, at considerable profit to the company.\n\nIn 1881, Colonel William M. Wadley, Central Railroad and Banking Company of Georgia president, leased the railroad properties of the Georgia Railroad and Banking Company, including the A&WP and WofA. Wadley assigned half of the lease to his company and half to the L&N. Following the Panic of 1896, the Central went into receivership and its portion of the lease lapsed, whereupon it was eventually reassigned to the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad (ACL). In 1902, the ACL acquired controlling interest in the L&N; thus the Georgia, A&WP, and WofA became non-operating subsidiaries of the Atlantic Coast Line. In 1909, white firemen of the Georgia Railroad, organized under the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen, went on a mass strike.\n\nWith the building of the Savannah and Atlanta Railroad, which connected with the Georgia Railroad at Warrenton, the Georgia Railroad now competed with the Central of Georgia Railroad for traffic to and from Savannah. Soon the ACL came to dominate the Augusta interchange traffic, through its Charleston and Western Carolina Railway subsidiary and via the ACL's spur from its main line at Florence, South Carolina, in order that the Georgia Railroad could compete with the Seaboard Air Line Railroad and Southern Railway for traffic from Atlanta up the Eastern seaboard.\nBy the opening of the 1960s, passenger service was reduced to an overnight through-train from Atlanta to Augusta, continuing as an Atlantic Coast Line Railroad train to Wilmington, North Carolina, and a day train from Atlanta, making connections at Augusta with an ACL train bound for Florence, South Carolina.\n\nA unique feature of the Georgia Railroad and Banking Company charter was that the state legislature gave the corporation large tax breaks, which were legally challenged on several occasions. The charter also called for daily-except-Sunday passenger service. The lawyers advised management to maintain passenger service on all lines, so as to not violate the charter. The Georgia was perhaps the last railroad to operate both freight and passenger trains in the \"Lower 48\" states, into the Amtrak era.\n\nThe Georgia Railroad originally fell under common management with the Atlanta & West Point Railroad and the Western Railway of Alabama, commonly known as \"the West Point Route.\"\n\nIn 1967, ACL merged with the Seaboard Air Line Railroad to form the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad (SCL). SCL continued to operate the Georgia Railroad as a subsidiary alongside the Louisville & Nashville Railroad and the Clinchfield Railroad. These were known collectively as the \"Family Lines System.\" SCL continued to operate the Georgia Railroad under its initial charter; the Georgia Railroad was maintained as a separate company, with SCL leasing the rail properties. Two years later, the Georgia Railroad ended its traditional passenger service, though it continued to operate a bare-bones mixed train service between Atlanta (Atlanta Union Station) and Augusta (Augusta Union Station).\n\nIn 1980, SCL merged with Chessie System to form CSX Corporation. In 1982, SCL and L&N merged to form the Seaboard System Railroad, beginning what would be a process in which the CSX operating companies would be merged into a single railroad. The Georgia Railroad was the first to be merged away. The railroad properties of the Georgia Railroad and Banking Company, which had been operated under a lease for 90 years by CSX and its predecessors, were formally merged into Seaboard System Railroad. The mixed train service also ended that year. \n\nIn 1986, Seaboard System Railroad renamed itself CSX Transportation. The same year, Georgia Railroad Bank was acquired by First Union; most former branches are now part of Wells Fargo. A year later, Chessie System merged into CSX Transportation.\n\nAfter a period of somewhat heavy use during the CSX ownership, most through traffic has been diverted from the former Georgia Railroad mainline. As of October 2018, only a single through train in each direction daily uses the line. Despite its seeming strategic value as a route for intermodal traffic to Charleston and Savannah, rumors continue to swirl that CSX will ultimately divest the line to a shortline operator.\n\nTrains departed from Atlanta at 8:55AM and 7:15PM and arrived in Augusta at 6:00PM and 10:05AM.\n\n\n"}

Their 11th single, , topped the charts in 1996.\n\nIn 1997, the band held an audition on the evening show \"ASAYAN\" to find a new female vocalist. While the audition eventually yielded winner Michiyo Heike, the competition would be the impetus for the formation of Morning Musume. Runners-up Yuko Nakazawa, Natsumi Abe, Kaori Iida, Aya Ishiguro, and Asuka Fukuda took up Tsunku's offer after the competition to form a group he would personally produce if they could sell 50,000 copies of their debut independent single \"Ai no Tane\" in five days. The mission was accomplished in four.\n\nAfter the 2000 release of , the band went on hiatus. During this period, Tsunku focused on establishing Morning Musume's career and the formation of Hello! Project stable. Makoto would frequently act as an emcee during these concerts.\n\nDuring the end of 2006 and early 2007, Hakate, Makoto, and Taisei would frequently appear on the short music show Uta Doki! to play their respective instruments in support of the guest vocalist.\n\nSharam Q became active again in 2006, having released a new single entitled in November 2006. Tsunku originally wrote and composed the song for Morning Musume, who debuted their recording two weeks before Sharam Q's rendition.\n\nIn March 2014, Tsunku announced on his blog that he had laryngeal cancer, which he found out after having throat surgery due to an unspecified condition. On April 4, 2015, Tsunku revealed that he had his vocal cords removed as part of his cancer treatment, and Sharam Q's activities then ceased.\n\n\n"}

After the United States' entry into World War II, it was built in large numbers for the United States Navy and also served various roles in the United States Army Air Forces.\n\nThe Howard Aircraft Company (later Howard Aircraft Corporation) was formed in 1936 to build commercial derivatives of the Howard DGA-6 (named \"Mister Mulligan\"), a successful four-seat racing aircraft which had won both the Bendix and the Thompson Trophies in 1935, the only aircraft ever to win both races. These successes did indeed bring the DGA series much attention, and Howard produced a series of closely related models differing mainly in the engine type, consisting of the DGA-7, -8, -9, -11 and -12. Offering high performance and being comprehensively equipped, despite a high purchase price (with the DGA-11 selling for $17,865), these became coveted aircraft owned by corporations, wealthy individuals, and movie stars, such as Wallace Beery, who was himself a pilot. (In the movie \"Bugsy\", Warren Beatty, playing the title role, is flown from Los Angeles to Las Vegas in a red Howard DGA-15.)\n\nIn 1939, the Howard Aircraft Corporation produced a new development of the basic design, the DGA-15. Like its predecessors, the DGA-15 was a single-engined high-winged monoplane with a wooden wing and a steel-tube-truss fuselage, but it was distinguished by a deeper and wider fuselage, allowing five people to be seated in comfort. It was available in several versions, differing in the engine fitted. The DGA-15P was powered by a Pratt & Whitney Wasp Junior radial engine, while the DGA-15J used a Jacobs L6MB and the DGA-15W a Wright R-760-E2 Whirlwind. In an era when airlines were flying Douglas DC-3s, the Howards cruising at 160 to 170 mph could match their speed, range and comfort with the rear seat leg room exceeding airline standards with limousine-like capaciousness, and high wing loading allowing the Howards to ride through most turbulence comfortably.\n\nPrior to the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, about 80 DGA-8 through -15 aircraft had been built at the Howard Aircraft Corporation factory on the south side of Chicago Municipal Airport. With America's entry into World War II, most of the civilian Howards were commandeered by the military. The Army used them as officer transports and as air ambulances, with the designation UC-70. The Navy, in particular, much liked the aircraft and contracted Howard Aircraft Corporation to build hundreds of DGA-15Ps to its own specifications. They were used variously under several designations as an officers' utility transport (GH-1, GH-3), aerial ambulance (GH-2), and for instrument training (NH-1). A second factory was opened at Dupage County airport, west of Chicago, and about 520 DGA-15s were eventually completed.\n\nIn their vintage years, Howards DGA series are prized more for their utility than for their clean lines. Contemporary cabin aircraft have already become antiques, living pampered lives as show pieces rather than working aircraft. In the 1960s a modification was offered by the Jobmaster company of Renton, Washington, including additional seating, windows, and float installation making Howard DGA-15s attractive to bush operators, and the large cabin proved popular with sky-divers as low-capital-outlay, low-operating-cost jumping platforms.\n\nWith most of the working Howard DGAs retired from active commercial service, they have become popular as restoration subjects and as alternatives to more modern equivalents with higher cost of ownership. Almost 100 of the Howard variants are still flying, mostly DGA-15s. A few of the DGA-11s also still fly, including one out of Santa Paula, California, which is probably the world headquarters for Howards, with at least five flying out of that field.\n\nSuperb travelling airplanes with much better visibility, headroom, and shoulder room than some contemporary cabin aircraft, they have very long \"legs\" with a fuel capacity of 151 gallons in 3 belly-mounted tanks, giving an endurance of more than 7 hours, for a range, at normal cruise (130 kn, 150 mph), of over 1,000 statute miles. With modern avionics, the Howard can compete in many respects with many contemporary light aircraft, due to its combination of room, comfort, speed, range and carrying capacity. A DGA-15P competed in the 1971 London (England) to Victoria (British Columbia, Canada) air race.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2016007", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2016007", "title": "Turkana people", "text": "Turkana people\n\nThe Turkana are a Nilotic people native to the Turkana County in northwest Kenya, a semi-arid climate region bordering Lake Turkana in the east, Pokot, Rendille and Samburu people to the south, Uganda to the west, and South Sudan and Ethiopia to the north. They refer to their land as Turkan.\n\nAccording to the 2019 Kenyan census, Turkana number 1,016,174, or 2.14% of the Kenyan population, making the Turkana the third largest Nilotic ethnic group in Kenya, after the Kalenjin and the Luo, slightly more numerous than the Maasai, and the tenth largest ethnicity in all of Kenya. Although this figure was initially controversial and rejected as too large by Planning Minister Wycliffe Oparanya, a court ruling (Feb 7, 2012) by Justice Mohammed Warsame stated that the Kenyan government accepts the 2009 census figures for Turkana.\n\nThe language of the Turkana, an Eastern Nilotic language, is also called Turkana; their own name for it is \"ŋaTurkana\" or \"aŋajep a ŋiTurkana\".\n\nThe Turkana people call themselves ŋiTurkana (The Turkana). The name means the people of Turkan. They are mainly semi-nomadic pastoralists.\n\nThe Turkana are noted for raising camels and weaving baskets. In their oral traditions, they designate themselves \"the people of the grey bull\", after the Zebu, the domestication of which played an important role in their history. In recent years, development aid programs have aimed at introducing fishing among the Turkana (a taboo in some sections of The Turkana society) with very limited success.\n\nFamous Turkana include Paul Ereng, the 1988 800M Olympic Champion and 800M former indoor world record holder, supermodel Ajuma Nasenyana; and key Kenyan government officials, including: Kenyan Ambassador to Thailand, H.E. Dr. Richard Titus Ekai; Minister of Labour, Hon. John Kiyonga Munyes - MP; and Hon. Ekwee Ethuro, current Speaker of the Senate and former MP for Turkana Central.\n\nThe Turkana refer to themselves as \"Ngiturkan\" and their land as \"Eturkan\". The Turkana ethnic group as a whole is composed of two major divisions, each composed of territorial sections. The major divisions are: the Ngimonia, divided into Ngissir and non-Ngissir sections; and the Ngichoro, divided into Ngilukumong, Ngiwoyakwara, Ngigamatak, Ngibelai, and Ngibotok.\n\nThe Turkana entered Turkana basin from the north as one unit of the Ateker confederation. This cluster split as a result of internal differences, leading to the emergence of distinct independent groups. The Turkana people emerged as a victorious group in the subsequent conflict, which led to enmity between the Turkana and other Ateker cluster groups, who formed military alliances against the Turkana. The Turkana emerged victorious again by co-opting young people from conquered groups. The military power and wealth of the Turkana increased in what is now the northern plains of Turkana. Turkana tradition often states that the cultivation of Zebu cattle and the rise of the diviners(\"ngimurok)\" allowed the Turkana to accrue such wealth and power. Both Zebu and the ngimurok continue play an important role in Turkana culture today.\n\nThe establishment of the Turkana people developed as a distinct group which expanded southwards conquering ethnic nations south of its borders. The Turkana people easily conquered groups it came in contact with by employing superior tactics of war, better weapons and military organization. By the 1600s, the Turkana basin had been fully occupied by the Turkana and their allies.\n\nThere was a relative long period of peace among indigenous ethnic communities around Turkana until the onset of European colonization of Africa. Sporadic conflicts involved Turkana fights against Arab, Swahili and Abyssinian slave raiders and ivory traders.\n\nEuropean colonization brought a new dimension to conflict with Turkana putting up a lasting resistance to a complex enemy, the British. The Turkana put up and maintained active resistance to British colonial advances leading to a passive presence of colonial administration. By the outbreak of World War I, few parts of Turkana had been put under colonial administration.\n\nFrom World War I through to the end of World War II, Turkana actively participated in the wars as allies of Britain against invading Italy. Turkana was used as the launching pad for the war against invading Italian forces leading to the liberation of Abyssinia.\n\nAfter World War II, the British led disarmament and pacification campaigns in Turkana, leading to massive disruptions and dispossession of Turkana pastoralists. The colonial administration practiced a policy of deliberate segregation of Turkana people by categorizing Turkana Province as a closed district. This led to marginalization and underdevelopment in the lead up to Kenya's independence.\n\nTraditionally, both men and women wear wraps made of rectangular woven materials and animal skins. Today, these cloths are normally purchased, having been manufactured in Nairobi or elsewhere in Kenya. Often, men wear their wraps similar to tunics, with one end connected with the other end over the right shoulder, and carry wrist knives made of steel and goat hide. Men also carry stools (known as \"ekicholong\") and will use these for simple chairs rather than sitting on the hot midday sand. These stools also double as headrests, keeping one's head elevated from the sand, and protecting any ceremonial head decorations from being damaged. It is also not uncommon for men to carry several staves; one is used for walking and balance when carrying loads; the other, usually slimmer and longer, is used to prod livestock during herding activities. Women will customarily wear necklaces, and will shave their hair completely which often has beads attached to the loose ends of hair. Men wear their hair shaved. Women wear two pieces of cloth, one being wrapped around the waist while the other covers the top. Traditionally leather wraps covered with ostrich egg shell beads were the norm for women's undergarments, though these are now uncommon in many areas.\n\nThe Turkana people have elaborate clothing and adornment styles. Clothing is used to distinguish between age groups, development stages, occasions and status of individuals or groups in the Turkana community.\n\nToday, many Turkana have adopted western-style clothing. This is especially prominent among both men and women who live in town centers throughout Turkana.\n\nThe Turkana rely on several rivers, such as the Turkwel River and Kerio River. When these rivers flood, new sediment and water extend onto the river plain that is cultivated after heavy rainstorms, which occur infrequently. When the rivers dry up, open-pit wells are dug in the riverbed; these are used for providing water to the livestock and also for human consumption. There are few, if any, developed wells for community and livestock drinking water, and often families must travel several hours searching for water for their livestock and themselves.\n\nLivestock is an important aspect of Turkana culture. Goats, camels, donkeys and zebu are the primary herd stock utilized by the Turkana people. In this society, livestock functions not only as a milk and meat producer, but as form of currency used for bride-price negotiations and dowries. Often, a young man will be given a single goat with which to start a herd, and he will accumulate more via animal husbandry. In turn, once he has accumulated sufficient livestock, these animals will be used to negotiate for wives. It is not uncommon for Turkana men to lead polygynous lifestyles, since livestock wealth will determine the number of wives each can negotiate for and support.\n\nLivestock also plays an important part in interactions between the Turkana and other neighboring groups, and is an important aspect of warfare in the region. Raids are not unusual in Turkana society and most of the time raids are conducted it is to steal cattle from neighboring groups such as the Taposa and the Pokot. In some cases, such raids have led to intense conflict in which dozens or even hundreds of people are injured or killed. In his book, \"Cattle bring us to our enemies: Turkana ecology, politics, and raiding in a disequilibrium system,\" J. Terrence McCabe cites several incidents in which raiding caused several deaths. McCabe notes that such raids often occur between the Turkana and the Pokot and that raiding seems to have increased in intensity over the last few years.\n\nTurkana rely on their animals for milk, meat and blood. Wild fruits are gathered by women from the bushes and cooked for 12 hours. Slaughtered goats are roasted on a fire. Roasting meat is their favorite way of consuming meat. The Turkana often trade with the Pokots for maize, beans and vegetables and Marakwet for tobacco. The Turkana buy tea from the towns and make milk tea. In the morning, people eat maize porridge with milk, while for lunch and dinner they eat plain maize porridge (nang'aria) with a stew. Zebu are only eaten during festivals, while goat is consumed more frequently. Fish is taboo for some of the Turkana clans (or brands, \"ngimacharin\"). After the hunt, men go out again to gather honey, which is the only natural sweetener available in traditional diets.\n\nWhile the Turkana mainly rely on pastoralism they also cultivate some of their food. Multiple studies have made note of sorghum cultivation in Turkana society. One such study, \"Sorghum Gardens in South Turkana: Cultivation among a Nomadic Pastoral People,\" notes that while sorghum cultivation is quite productive it is more limited by environmental factors than pastoralism. The Jie, a long time ally of the Turkana, have sometimes been know to gift sorghum to the Turkana.\n\nHouses are constructed over a wooden framework of domed saplings on which fronds of the Doum Palm tree Hyphaene thebaica, hides or skins, are thatched and lashed on. The house is large enough to house a family of six. Usually, during the wet season, they are elongated and covered with cowdung. Animals are kept in a brush wood pen. Due to changes in the climatic conditions, most Turkana have started changing from the traditional method of herding cattle to agro-pastoralism.\n\nA clear boundary is not drawn between the sacred and the profane in Turkana society. In this regard, Turkana traditional religion is undifferentiated from Turkana social structure or epistemological reality—the religion and the culture are one. The Turkana are pastoralists whose lives are shaped by the extreme climate in which they live. Each day, one must seek to find the blessings of life—water, food, livestock, wives, children—in a manner that appeases the ancestral spirits and is in harmony with the peace within the community. Properly following the traditions (ngitalio) in daily life will certainly lead to blessing. Blessings are understood to be an increase in wealth, whether livestock, children, wives or even food. It is only through proper relationships with God (Akuj) and the ancestors, proper protection from evil, and participation in the moral economy of the community that one can be blessed.\n\nEssentially, Turkana believe in the reality of a Supreme Being named Akuj. Not much is known about Akuj other than the fact that he alone created the world and is in control of the blessings of life. There is also a belief in the existence of ancestors, ngipean or ngikaram, yet these are seen to be malevolent, requiring animal sacrifices to be appeased when angry. When angered or troubled, the ancestors will possess people in the family in order to verbally communicate with their family. There is also the recognition of “The Ancestor”, Ekipe, who is seen as much more active in the everyday lives of people, yet only in negative ways. There is much concern over protecting one’s family and oneself from the evil of the Ekipe. Turkana Christians and missionaries equate ekipe with the biblical character of Devil or Satan and this has shifted more traditional understandings of ekipe away from “an evil spirit” to “The Evil one”. Turkana religious specialists, ngimurok, continue to act as intermediaries between living people and ancestors and also help in problem solving in communities.The Arabs also brought Islam to the people and hence the men wear the cap weather they are Muslims or not.\n\nAs in most African traditional religions, traditional religious specialists in Turkana are present and play an active role in almost every community event. Ngimurok help to identify both the source of evil, sickness or other problems that present themselves, and the solution or specific cure or sacrifice that needs to take place in order to restore abundant life in the family and the community. There are various types of diviners differentiated by the emuron’s source of revelation. According to Barrett, the “true diviners,” also known as the “diviners of God”, are the most respected of the ngimurok because they receive revelations directly from Akuj, normally through dreams. These “true diviners” follow in the pattern of the most famous Turkana ngimurok, Lokerio and Lokorijem. The latter regularly received dreams from Akuj informing him of the location of the British Army during early 20th century colonial struggles, and the former is said to have used the power and knowledge of God to divide Lake Turkana so that warriors could walk across the lake to steal camels.\n\nThese ngimurok of God can still be found throughout Turkana, each in their own territory, alongside specialized ngimurok who have received specific abilities to read tea leaves, tobacco, intestines, shoes, stones and string. There are also hidden evil specialists, ngikasubak, who use objects in secret to work against people in the community, and ngikapilak, who specialize in pronouncing very strong curses employing the use of body parts from those recently deceased, but these are not included in the term emuron. Ngimurok are the people that Akuj and the Fathers speaks to in dreams; they are also the ones who can communicate with the ancestors to discern what sort of animal sacrifice is needed to restore peace, bring rain, find a remedy for a child’s illness, or who can properly bless the families at a wedding.\n\nThe ngimurok in each area receive direct revelations from Akuj, who is still directly active and concerned with the creation. These ngimurok do not speak or receive messages through an intermediary god or spirit through possession. While ancestor possessions are common in Turkana, they normally occur among younger people at the home, so that the ancestor can communicate their message to those in the home. The emuron would then be consulted as to what should be done. Ngimurok are not known as people who are normally possessed.\nApart from the ngimurok, there are also important clan rituals in Turkana that represent the acknowledgement and transitions of life force. The most important rituals are the birth rituals (akidoun), male and female initiation rituals that do not include circumcision (asapan and akinyonyo), marriage rituals (Akuuta), annual blessing sacrifices (Apiaret an awi), and death rituals (Akinuuk). Each of these rituals is overseen by the elders of the clan, both men and women. The elders also oversee the community-wide wedding rituals, but an emuron normally plays a role in blessing the marriage.\n\n\nWood bowls, containers, cow bells and head rests from the Turkana people. http://www.douglasyaney.com/tribes-turkana.html\n\n\n"}

The libretto, in Russian, was by the composer and Mira Mendelson (his companion in later life), after Richard Brinsley Sheridan's ballad opera libretto for Thomas Linley the younger's \"The Duenna\".\n\nProkofiev began the work in 1940, and it was in rehearsal that year, but World War II halted production of the opera. The composer revised the score in Almaty in 1943. The first performance did not occur until 3 November 1946 at the Kirov Theatre with Boris Khaikin conducting. The producer was I. Shlepianov.\n\nCommentators have noted that, given the context of its creation in the 1940s in the Soviet Union, this opera lacks any particular political or social comment, except perhaps for a scene involving drunken monks.\n\nIn recent years, the opera has been performed in 1989 at the Wexford Festival, in 2006 at the Glyndebourne Festival and at the Palau de les Arts in Valencia, Spain in 2008, at Staatsoper Berlin, in 2019.\n\nDon Jerome intends his daughter Louisa to marry the vain, wealthy and ugly fish merchant Mendoza. However, she loves instead Antonio, who is poor, though noble in spirit. Furthermore, Don Ferdinand, son of Don Jerome and prone to fits of jealousy, wants to marry Clara d'Almanza, who is a virtual prisoner of her stepmother.\n\nDon Jerome locks up Louisa in her room to force her to marry Mendoza. Louisa's nurse (the Duenna) provokes the fury of Don Jerome by pretending to be a messenger between Antonio and Louisa. Jerome dismisses her - but the Duenna exchanges clothes with Louisa who makes her escape in this disguise. \n\nBy the quayside - where fisherwomen are praising the quality of the fish caught in Mendoza's boats - Louisa encounters her friend Clara, who has also run away from home and intends to seek sanctuary at the nunnery. Louisa asks to borrow Clara's name for a day - Clara assents. Enter Mendoza and his courtly friend Don Carlos. Mendoza is recognized by Louisa but he has never seen her. She therefore approaches Mendoza claiming to be Clara and asks him to take her under his protection and find Antonio with whom she is in love. Mendoza is attracted by this idea as a means to rid himself of his rival Antonio by marrying him off to 'Clara'. Don Carlos escorts 'Clara' to Mendoza's house.\n\nMendoza visits the house of Don Jerome to meet 'Louisa' (the Duenna in disguise); whilst 'Louisa' is not as young and beautiful as Mendoza had been led to believe, her dowry is sufficient attraction. they agree to elope that evening.\n\nThe mystified Antonio arrives at Mendoza's house; while he is offstage meeting 'Clara', Mendoza and don Carlos congratulate themselves on their cunning. Still unwitting, they agree to help the pair get married. \n\nDon Jerome is rehearsing some amateur musicians (A trio of trumpet, clarinet and bass drum). He receives two messages- one from Mendoza saying he has eloped with Louisa, which delights him, and another from the real Louisa who asks for his blessing on her marriage, which he neglects to read carefully. He sends back his consent with both messengers and arranges for a great feast later that evening to celebrate.\n\nAt the monastery, Clara meets with Antonio and Luisa and laments her apparent loss of Ferdinand. Enter Ferdinand, who mistaking Clara for a nun exclaims that he is chasing his false friend Antonio who has run off with his beloved Clara. Clara is secretly overjoyed at this demonstration of Ferdinand's passion.\n\nThe act opens with a drinking song for the monks in the monastery where the marriages are to be performed. The monks then switch to a hymn that extols fasting and abstinence, to a tune that is a slower variant of the earlier drinking song. Enter Mendoza and Antonio who by lavish bribery gain the monks consent to marry them to their loves. Enter Ferdinand who challenges Antonio to a duel, but the genuine Clara arrives and Ferdinand now understands the true situation. The three marriages are agreed.\n\nAt Don Jerome's feast, the host is increasingly amazed, exasperated and infuriated as the successive arrival of the newly-weds makes it clear that his plans have gone completely awry. He is slightly compensated by the likely size of Clara's dowry. He sings a drinking song, accompanying himself on a set of tuned glasses.\n\nRecordings include:\n\n\"Summer Night\" (Op. 123) is an orchestral suite with music drawn from \"Betrothal in a Monastery\".\n\nThe suite, lasting around 20 minutes, consists of five movements:\n\nRecent recordings include:\n\n"}

He began working in the railroad business as a clerk at the age of 17 and quickly rose through the ranks of management to become the General Manager of the Wabash, St. Louis and Pacific Railway. He became Vice-President of that company in 1889 and remained as such until 1896 when he became General Manager of the Grand Trunk Railway (GTR) of Canada.\n\nHays left GTR for a short time to serve as the President of the Southern Pacific Railway Company but returned to GTR after one year. As Vice-President and General Manager of GTR he is credited with keeping the company from bankruptcy. In 1909, he became the president of GTR and all its consolidated lines, subsidiary railroads, and steamship companies. He was known for his philanthropy and received the Order of the Rising Sun, third class, from the Emperor of Japan in 1907.\n\nHays is credited with the formation of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway (GTP), a dream he had to create a second transcontinental railroad within the borders of Canada. He is also blamed for the insolvency of both the GTR and the GTP. He died before his dream was complete as he perished at sea in the sinking of the RMS \"Titanic\". Before the ship collided with an iceberg, Hays made a statement that was prophetic of the disaster. His body was recovered, and he was buried in Montreal. He was survived by his wife and four daughters.\n\nCharles Melville Hays was born in Rock Island, Illinois, on May 16, 1856. His family moved to St. Louis, Missouri, when he was a child.\n\nIn 1873, at the age of 17, he began his career in the railroad business working for the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad in St. Louis. From 1877 to 1884, Hays was Secretary to the General Manager of the Missouri Pacific Railroad. Beginning in 1884, he held the same position with the Wabash, St. Louis and Pacific Railway until 1886, when he became that company's General Manager. In 1889, he became Vice-President of the Wasbash Railroad and remained as such until 1896, when he became General Manager of the Grand Trunk Railway (GTR) of Canada.\n\nIn 1901, Hays left GTR to serve as the President of the Southern Pacific Railway Company but returned to the company in January 1902 as Vice-President and General Manager. In October 1909, he was appointed president of GTR, which also gave him control of its subsidiary railroad and steamship companies. These included the Central Vermont Railway, the Grand Trunk Western Railway, the Grand Haven and Milwaukee Railway, the Detroit and Toledo Shoreline Railroad, the Toledo, Saginaw and Muskegon Railway, the Southern New England Railway Company, the Canadian Express Company, and several others. In addition, he was sought after to help manage several philanthropies. He was Governor of the Royal Victoria Hospital, Montreal, Montreal General Hospital and McGill University. He received the Order of the Rising Sun, third class, from the Emperor of Japan in 1907 for assistance he gave the Imperial Government Railways.\n\nWhen Hays became General Manager of GTR in 1896, it was near bankruptcy and under-performing its rival, the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR). On the advice of American financier J. Pierpont Morgan, the GTR board selected Hays as General Manager to bring more aggressive, \"American\" business practices to the company. He reorganized the management of the company and successfully negotiated running rights with CPR. He also brought more efficiency to the handling of accounts, built new track and ordered more powerful locomotives. These changes produced an era of greater success for the railroad.\n\nAt the time, the western prairies were being rapidly settled. Hays wanted to capitalize on the trend by constructing a transcontinental railroad, within the borders of Canada, to run 3,600 miles from Moncton, New Brunswick, to Prince Rupert, British Columbia. In 1900, he introduced a proposal to extend the lines of the Grand Trunk Western, an American subsidiary, from Chicago to Winnipeg, \"and thence to the Pacific.\" However, he was turned down by the railroad's directors in London. Later that year, Hays left GTR to work for Southern Pacific, but a change in ownership there lead to his resignation. He returned to the GTR to find that the president, Sir Charles Rivers Wilson, had convinced the Board of Directors to pursue the transcontinental railway. Meanwhile, the government, under Sir Wilfrid Laurier, had also decided to back the project. Plans to construct the transcontinental line were announced on November 24, 1902.\n\nHays' plan involved the creation of a subsidiary line from Winnipeg to Prince Rupert, with the government building the line from New Brunswick to Winnipeg. The cabinet became weary of Hays' demands for subsidies, but after negotiations between the government and Hays, aided by the railroad's president Rivers Wilson, the National Transcontinental Railway Act was passed in 1903. It enabled the incorporation of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway (GTP). The government's portion of the line would be called the National Transcontinental Railway (NTR).\n\nThere were problems with some of Hays' policies regarding the GTP. \n\nHays made the construction of the mainline his priority, failing to develop feeder lines. CNoR and CPR joined forces to gain control of the prairie traffic. The competition among the three railroads led to Canada's ending up with three transcontinental railways instead of one. This was to result in the GTP's being starved of traffic; even though it was arguably the best of the three, it ultimately failed to attract enough freight to make it profitable.\n\nAfter construction on the GTP began in 1905, Hays started the Grand Trunk Pacific Development Company in order to purchase thousands of acres of land on which he established town sites along the route of the railway, including Melville, Saskatchewan, which was named after him. Hays' vision went beyond the building of the railway. He also had plans for a fleet of ocean liners and a string of resort hotels across the Rocky Mountains. He hired the famed architect Francis Rattenbury from CPR to design a grand hotel, the Château Prince Rupert, at the westernmost stop on the railway. In 1909, only 3000 people lived in Prince Rupert, but anticipation of the railroad caused it to grow rapidly, despite the rapidly rising cost of property and the muddy environs. The city was incorporated in 1910.\n\nAfter Rivers Wilson retired as the railroad's president in 1909, Hays was appointed to fill the position. By 1910, Grand Trunk union workers were demanding wages on par with those of railroad workers in the United States. A strike put a stop to construction. Hays finally gave into the workers' demands but failed to re-hire 250 previously-fired strikers despite promising to do so. He also denied workers their pensions, causing one member of Parliament to describe him as \"heartless, cruel, and tyrannical.\"\n\nBy 1912, the cost of constructing the railway was increasing, with rising wages and price increases on materials, while the government refused to allow a rate increase. Another reason for the mounting costs was Hays' insistence on \"building to the very highest standards\". Meanwhile, CNoR and CPR monopolized the traffic in the west. In addition, Grand Trunk, which would be leasing the NTR from the government, was responsible for paying back the construction cost of that line. Hays began to fear insolvency.\n\nIn April 1912, Hays was in London soliciting financial support for the GTP. He was anxious to get back to Canada for the opening of the Château Laurier in Ottawa, Ontario, named after Prime Minister Laurier. The gala opening of this hotel was set for April 25, 1912. Hays had also received news that his daughter Louise was having difficulty with her pregnancy.\n\nAdditionally, he might have had business with J. Bruce Ismay, chairman of the White Star Line; in any case, Ismay had invited Hays to join him on the RMS \"Titanic\". Hays, his wife, Clara, his daughter, Orian (see source note), his son-in-law, Thornton Davidson (son of Charles Peers Davidson), his secretary, Mr. Vivian Payne, and a maid, Miss Mary Anne Perreault, shared a deluxe suite (cabin B69) on B Deck, also known as the Bridge Deck.\n\nAt 11:40 pm on April 14, 1912, \"Titanic\" struck an iceberg. Hays helped the women in his party into one of the ship's 20 lifeboats, but he, his son-in-law, and his secretary remained and perished when the ship sank, along with 1,500 other \"Titanic\" passengers and crew. Hays was reported to have made a prophetic remark on the evening of the disaster; deploring the way the steamship lines were competing to win passengers with ever-faster vessels, he is said to have commented, \"The time will come soon when this trend will be checked by some appalling disaster.\"\n\nOne source, Hacking, names the daughter with Hays on the \"Titanic\" as \"Margaret,\" but it was his daughter, Orian, who was traveling with her husband, Thorton Davidson. That source does not mention Orian as a passenger on the ship. There was a 24-year-old woman, Margaret Bechstein Hays, on the \"Titanic\", but she was staying in a different compartment from the C.M. Hays party with another group of people. She escaped via lifeboat No. 7 (with her Pomeranian, \"Lady\"), while the other Hays women boarded lifeboat No. 3. Early newspaper reports said that Clara and Margaret Hays, and Mrs. Thornton [Orian] Davidson disembarked the rescue ship in New York City together and boarded a train for Montreal, but other sources say that Margaret Hays lived in New York and took care of two young child survivors (Edmond and Michael Navratil), who were unclaimed immediately following the disaster. Margaret (Hays) Easton's 1913 wedding announcement says her father, Frank Hays, walked her down the aisle. Finally, Orian's death notice lists Marjorie (Mrs. George Hall), not Margaret Easton, as a predeceased sister.\n\nHays' body was recovered from the waters of the North Atlantic by the \"Minia\", and he was buried at Mount Royal Cemetery in Montreal. Two funerals were held for him on May 8, one at the American Presbyterian Church in Montreal, the other in London at the Church of St Edmund, King and Martyr.\nHays died before he could see the GTP completed. He was eulogized as one of the greatest railwaymen in Canada, and work on the GTR was stopped for five minutes, on April 25, 1912, in his memory. The period in which Hays led the GTR was its most prosperous era.\n\nHowever, his policies led to the GTP's collapse in 1919. The company was placed in receivership, and the government seized GTR's stock. It was later alleged that Hays had deceived the company's London directors in 1903 by committing them to conditions in the railway's agreements with the Canadian government for the building of the GTP to which they did not agree. That scheme was blamed for the company's collapse.\n\nThe railroad car in which his body was transported back to Montreal is preserved at the Canadian Railway Museum, near Delson, Quebec. There is a statue of him in Prince Rupert, and the city of Melville, Saskatchewan, is named after him, as is the village of Haysport, British Columbia.\nMount Hays, south of Prince Rupert, British Columbia is named for him. \n\nHe was survived by his wife, Clara Jennings (née Gregg), whom he married in St. Louis, Missouri on October 13, 1881. They had four daughters: Orian (Mrs. Thornton Davidson, Mrs. Robert N. Hickson), Clara (Mrs. Hope Scott), Marjorie (Mrs. George Hall), and Louise (Mrs. Grier).\n"}

The class is used by other sanctioning bodies with compatible rules, such as the International Conference of Sports Car Clubs.\n\nThe classifications within the Improved Touring group define cars that will run together competitively in a road race. While cars in different classifications may be on the track simultaneously, the only positioning that matters is between cars of the same classification.\n\nThe rules for the class include the General Competition Rules (GCR), a section of the SCCA rulebook that defines the basic setup and preparation for cars in any class of SCCA racing. Improved Touring cars are also subject to the rules in the Improved Touring Category Section (ITCS) of the rulebook, which define the specific classes and provide the class-specific rules.\n\nThe rules from the GCR applying to Improved Touring cars mostly involve safety and basic setup. The GCR specifies the construction, fabrication, and material used in installing a roll-cage, for example. It also explains the rules of the road during racing events, including the flags and right of way rules for passing maneuvers.\n\nImproved Touring is intended to provide a low barrier to entry by using a set of rules which limit modification of the cars while keeping the cars safe for competition. To this end, the cars are production-based models built after 1964 with a reasonable amount of limited modifications. The cars are run as-built by the manufacturer, except for modifications specifically allowed by the GCR or the ITCS.\n\nThe Improved Touring category is broken into five classes based on the performance potential of the car. Those classes are Improved Touring A (ITA), Improved Touring B (ITB), Improved Touring C (ITC), Improved Touring S (ITS) and Improved Touring R (ITR).\n\nThese basic rules make Improved Touring a popular class, since familiar and modern cars race together in groups which maximize the chances for a close finish.\n\nThis section is not an exhaustive set of rules; it is intended to give the reader an idea of the preparation level of the cars in this class.\n\nThe ITCS specifies that cars may remove almost all of their interior components, as a safe race car has few flammable features inside and drivers do not want to worry about projectiles from inside their own cars during a race.\n\nFor most cars, air induction to the point where the air meets either the carburetor or mass air flow sensor is unrestricted by the rules, so cars may be prepared with improved air intakes. Exhaust systems are also unrestricted, so exhaust systems including headers may be modified. Cars may have to remain under a maximum noise level, so mufflers might still be needed.\n\nStock brake calipers and rotors must be used, but pad material is unrestricted.\n\nNo internal engine modifications are allowed short of rebuilding to factory \"blue print\" specifications, though the car's ECU may be modified or replaced with an aftermarket unit.\n\n\"Bolt-on\" suspension modifications are allowed, including most coil-over shock–strut systems. Relocation, reinforcement, or custom fabrication of mounting points is not allowed.\n\nDOT-approved tires are required, so full race tires may not be used. There are however some very high quality \"DOT\" tires available that perform very well at the track but are not actually intended for street use. Lightweight racing wheels may be used, but the sizes are limited by the rules.\n\nWhile the ITA, ITB, ITC, ITS and ITR classes allow different model cars in competition, the classes all use the same basic rules. The cars are grouped into the different classes based on their potential for performance. A sampling of popular cars and model years in each class includes:\n\n\n\n"}

She is best known for chairing an inquiry whose report formed the basis of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990. She served as Mistress of Girton College, Cambridge from 1984 to 1991.\n\nWarnock was born Helen Mary Wilson on 14 April 1924 in Winchester, England, and was the youngest of seven children. Her mother Ethel was the daughter of the successful banker and financier Felix Schuster. Her father Archibald Edward Wilson (1875-1923) was a housemaster and German teacher at Winchester College and died before her birth. Her mother did not marry again.\n\nWarnock was brought up by her mother and a nanny. She never knew her eldest brother, Malcolm (1907–1969), who had autism and was cared for in a nursing home, spending his last days in a Dorset hospital. Another brother died when very young. Her other brother, Duncan Wilson (1911–1983), was a British diplomat who became Ambassador to the Soviet Union before taking up an appointment as master of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. When Warnock was seven months old the family moved to Kelso House, a three-floor Victorian house, now the music centre at Peter Symonds College. She and her sister Stefana were cared for primarily by the family nanny. Warnock was educated as a boarder at St Swithun's School, Winchester, followed by Prior's Field School in the town of Guildford in Surrey.\n\nWarnock said that when she was a child she was embarrassed by her mother, who looked different from most people, often by wearing long flowing dark red clothes and walking with turned out feet. However, when Warnock was about 15 years old, she began to admire her mother's eccentricity and independent thinking.\n\nThe family's inherited wealth offered Warnock a privileged education; starting in 1942 she studied classics at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford. Her studies were interrupted during the war whilst she taught for two years at Sherborne School for Girls in Dorset. She returned to Oxford and graduated in 1948.\n\nFrom 1949–66, Warnock was a fellow and tutor in philosophy at St Hugh's College, Oxford. In addition to her husband Geoffrey Warnock, then a fellow of Magdalen College, her circle during this period included the philosophers Isaiah Berlin, Stuart Hampshire, David Pears and Peter Strawson, as well the authors Kingsley Amis and David Cecil. She participated in radio debates on philosophy broadcast on the Third Programme. She was invited to write on contemporary ethics for a series published by Oxford University Press, which led her to study Sartre and Existentialism, resulting in three books published between 1963 and 1970.\n\nShe was Talbot Research Fellow at Lady Margaret Hall from 1972 until 1976. She published a book entitled \"Imagination\" in 1976. From 1976–84, she was a senior research fellow at St Hugh's College, and was made an honorary fellow of the college in 1985. She served as mistress of Girton College, Cambridge frorm 1984–1991. She retired in 1992, but continued to serve on public committees and to write and edit books, including \"The Uses of Philosophy\" (1992), \"Imagination and Time\" (1994) and \"An Intelligent Person's Guide to Ethics\" (1998). She delivered the Gifford Lectures, entitled \"Imagination and Understanding,\" at the University of Glasgow in 1992. In 2000, she was a visiting professor of rhetoric at Gresham College, London.\n\nWarnock wrote extensively on ethics, existentialism, and philosophy of mind.\n\nIn the early 1960s, whilst still teaching at St Hugh's College, Warnock took a seat on the Oxfordshire Local Education Authority. From 1966 to 1972, she was Headmistress at the Oxford High School for Girls, giving up the position when her husband was appointed principal of Hertford College, Oxford. In the late 1970s, she published three books on the topic of education. In the 1980s and 1990s, she wrote a column for the \"Times Educational Supplement\", as well as a pamphlet \"Universities: Knowing Our Minds\", and gave the Richard Dimbleby Lecture in 1985 on the topic, \"Teacher Teach Thyself\".\n\nWarnock was a member of the Independent Broadcasting Authority from 1972–83. In 1980, she was considered for the post of Chair of the Board of Governors of the BBC.\n\nBecause of her background as an educationalist, Warnock was appointed in 1974 to chair a UK inquiry on special education. Her report, published in 1978, brought radical change in the field, by placing emphasis on the teaching of learning-disabled children in mainstream schools and introducing a system of \"statementing\" children in order for them to gain entitlement to special educational support. Warnock subsequently expressed dissatisfaction with the system that she helped to create, calling it \"appalling\" because of the expense of its administration and its tendency to deny support to mildly disadvantaged children. She recommended the establishment of a new inquiry.\n\nFrom 1979–84, she sat on a Royal Commission on environmental pollution. From 1982–84, she chaired the Committee of Inquiry into Human Fertilisation and Embryology. Her report on this occasion gave rise to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990, which governs human fertility treatment and experiments using human embryos. Its effect has been to require licensing for procedures such as in vitro fertilisation and to ban research using human embryos more than 14 days old. According to Dame Susan Leather, a former chair of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, \"perhaps the greatest achievement of the Warnock committee is that it managed to get an ethical consensus that people understood as well as shared\".\n\nFrom 1984 to 1989, Warnock chaired a Home Office Committee on animal experimentation; she was a member of the Government advisory panel on spoliation from 1998. In 2008, Warnock, a committed advocate of euthanasia, caused controversy with an opinion that people with dementia should be allowed to elect to die if they felt they were \"a burden to their family or the state\". Aged 90, Warnock took part enthusiastically in a review of her public life as documented by BBC Sound Archives (12 July 2014).\n\nWarnock was the President of Listening Books, a charity providing audiobooks for people who struggle to read due to an illness, disability, learning difficulty or mental health issue. She was a patron of The Iris Project, a charity that promotes the teaching of classics.\n\nIn the 1984 New Year Honours she was appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE). Warnock was created a life peer on 6 February 1985, taking the title Baroness Warnock, of Weeke, in the City of Winchester. She sat in the House of Lords as a crossbencher until her retirement from the House on 1 June 2015. Warnock was appointed a member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH) in the 2017 New Year Honours for services to charity and to children with special education needs.\n\nWarnock was elected an honorary Fellow of the British Academy (FBA) in 2000 and an Honorary Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences (FMedSci) in 2011. She was awarded an honorary D.Litt. degree by the University of Bath in 1987. She was made an Honorary Fellow of Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford in 1984, and of Hertford College, Oxford in 1997.\n\nIn 2018, she was named as one of the TES ten most influential people in education, in recognition of her work on special educational needs.\n\nWarnock married Geoffrey Warnock, later vice-chancellor of Oxford University, in 1949. They had two sons and three daughters; he died in 1995. She died aged 94 on 20 March 2019.\n\nShe was often described as an “atheist Anglican”.\n\nAs chair of committees of inquiry:\n\nAs author:\n\nAs editor:\n\n\n"}

It tells the story of an ambitious young woman trying to gain an education in Afghanistan after the defeat of the Taliban. The title comes from a Federico García Lorca poem and is a tale of flourishing against the odds.\n\nThe film premiered In Competition at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival and was awarded the Jury Prize and the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury.\n\nNogreh, a Pakistani immigrant in Kabul, Afghanistan begins covertly attending an all girls school against her father's wishes. Nogreh is one of the few girls at the school who dreams of one day becoming president. While searching for water one day after school she comes across several truckloads of Pakistani refugees and helps them resettle in the ruins she calls home. However the number of refugees overwhelms the shelter where her family have been living and they are eventually forced out by several other families. They manage to find shelter in an abandoned airplane but this too is eventually overcrowded by refugees.\n\nNogreh meets a refugee among the ruins who is a poet. She asks him if he knows whether the president of Pakistan is a man or a woman and he, like everyone else, does not know. However, after befriending Nogreh and learning of her ambitions to be president he helps procure political speeches and goes with her to a photographer to get photos of her that she can use to campaign.\n\nNogreh's father learns from some of the Pakistan refugees that his son has died. Unwilling to tell his daughter-in-law he moves the family further into the desert where his grandson dies of starvation and malnourishment.\n\nIn the desert they meet an old man who is waiting by his donkey who is dying of hunger and thirst. The man had been trying to get to the city to speak on behalf of Osama Bin Laden to try to prevent him from being given to the Americans. Nogreh's father informs him he is too late and that the Americans have already invaded. After Nogreh's father buries his grandson the family continues on into the desert.\n\n\"At Five in the Afternoon\" was the first film to be shot in Kabul after the NATO invasion. It was an international co-production between the Iranian company Makhmalbaf Productions and the French companies Bac Films and Wild Bunch.\n\nMakhmalbaf had difficulty finding an actress willing to play the lead character.

{"id": "2016067", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2016067", "title": "Petrochemistry", "text": "Petrochemistry\n\nPetrochemistry is a branch of chemistry that studies the transformation of crude oil (petroleum) and natural gas into products or raw materials. These petrochemicals have become a major part of the chemical industry today.\n\nIt may be possible to make petroleum from any kind of organic matter under suitable conditions. The concentration of organic matter is not very high in the original deposits, but petroleum and natural gas evolved in places that favored retention, such as sealed-off porous sandstones. Petroleum, produced over millions of years by natural changes in organic materials, accumulates beneath the earth's surface in extremely large quantities.\n\nThe first commercial oil well was set up in 1859, two years after which the first oil refinery was set up. The industry grew in the late 1940s. Demand for products from the petrochemical industry grew during the World War II. The demand for synthetic materials increased, and this rising demand was met by replacing costly and sometimes less efficient products with these synthetic materials. This caused petrochemical processing to develop into a major industry.\n\nBefore this, petrochemical industry was a tentative sector where various experiments could be carried out. The industry used basic materials: synthetic rubbers in the 1900s, Bakelite, the first petrochemical-derived plastic in 1907, the first petrochemical solvents in the 1920s, polystyrene in the 1930s. After that period, the industry produced materials for a large variety of areas—from household goods (kitchen appliances, textile, furniture) to medicine (heart pacemakers, transfusion bags), from leisure (running shoes, computers) to highly specialized fields like archaeology and crime detection.\n\nCrude oils are compounds that mainly consist of many different hydrocarbon compounds that vary in appearance and composition. Average crude oil composition is 84% carbon, 14% hydrogen, 1%-3% sulphur, and less than 1% each of nitrogen, oxygen, metals and salts.\n\nCrude oils are distinguished as \"sweet\" or \"sour,\" depending upon the sulphur content present. Crude oils with a high sulfur content, which may be in the form hydrogen sulphides, are called \"sour,\" and those with less sulphur are called \"sweet.\"\n\nA process called fractional distillation separates crude oil into various segments. Fractions at the top have a lower boiling points than fractions at the bottom. The bottom fractions are heavy, and are thus \"cracked\" into lighter and more useful products.\n\nDirectly from the well, raw or unprocessed (\"crude\") oil is not useful. Though light sweet oil has been used directly as a burner fuel, these lighter fragments form explosive vapors in fuel tanks, and thus are dangerous. The oil must be separated into various parts and refined before used in fuels and lubricants, and before some of the byproducts form materials such as plastics, detergents, solvents, elastomers, and fibers such as nylon and polyesters.\n\nCrude oil and natural gas are extracted from the ground, on land or under the oceans, with oil wells. Ships, trains, and pipelines transport extracted oils and gasses to refineries.\n\nRefineries then execute processes that cause various physical and chemical changes in the crude oil and natural gas. This involves extremely specialized manufacturing processes. One of the important process is distillation, i.e., separation of heavy crude oil into lighter groups (called fractions) of hydrocarbons. There are two processes of distillation: CDU process and VDU process. The objective of the CDU process is to distill and separate valuable distillates (naphtha, kerosene, diesel) and atmospheric gas oil (AGO) from the crude feedstock. The technique used to carry out the above process is called complex distillation. On the other hand, the objective of the VDU process is to recover valuable gas oils from reduced crude via vacuum distillation. Two of the fractions of distillation are fuel oil and naphtha, which are familiar to consumers. Fuel oil, is used for heating for diesel fuel in automotive applications. Naphtha is used in gasoline and also used as the primary source for petrochemicals.\n\nRefining is the processing of one complex mixture of hydrocarbons into a number of other complex mixtures of hydrocarbons. Refining is where the job of oil industry stops and that of petrochemical industry starts. The raw materials used in the petrochemistry industry are known as feedstocks. These are obtained from the refinery:naphtha, components of natural gas such as butane, and some of the by-products of oil refining processes, such as ethane and propane. These feedstocks then undergo processing through an operation called cracking.\nCracking is defined as the process of breaking down heavy oil molecules into lighter, more valuable fractions. There are two kinds: steam cracking and catalytic cracking. In steam cracking, high temperatures are used. Catalytic cracking is when a catalyst is being used. The plant where these operations are conducted is called a 'cracker'.\nOnce these operations complete, new products are obtained that serve as building blocks of the petrochemical industry: olefins, i.e., mainly ethylene, propylene, and the so-called C4 derivatives, including butadiene—and aromatics, so called because of their distinctive perfumed smell, i.e., mainly benzene, toluene and the xylenes.\n\nThen petrochemicals go through various processes that eventually contribute to the final output of products like plastics, soaps and detergents, healthcare products like aspirin, synthetic fibres for clothes and furniture, rubbers, paints, insulating materials etc.\n"}
{"id": "2016069", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2016069", "title": "Autoantibody", "text": "Autoantibody\n\nAn autoantibody is an antibody (a type of protein) produced by the immune system that is directed against one or more of the individual's own proteins. Many autoimmune diseases (notably lupus erythematosus) are caused by such autoantibodies.\n\nAntibodies are produced by B cells in two ways: (i) randomly, and (ii) in response to a foreign protein or substance within the body. Initially, one B cell produces one specific kind of antibody. In either case, the B cell is allowed to proliferate or is killed off through a process called clonal deletion. Normally, the immune system is able to recognize and ignore the body's own healthy proteins, cells, and tissues, and to not overreact to non-threatening substances in the environment, such as foods. Sometimes, the immune system ceases to recognize one or more of the body's normal constituents as \"self,\" leading to production of pathological autoantibodies. Autoantibodies may also play a nonpathological role; for instance they may help the body to destroy cancers and to eliminate waste products. The role of autoantibodies in normal immune function is also a subject of scientific research.\n\nThe causes of autoantibody production are varied and not well understood. It is thought that some autoantibody production is due to a genetic predisposition combined with an environmental trigger, such as a viral illness or a prolonged exposure to certain toxic chemicals. There is generally not a direct genetic link however.\nWhile families may be susceptible to autoimmune conditions, individual family members may have different autoimmune disorders, or may never develop an autoimmune condition. Researchers believe that there may also be a hormonal component as many of the autoimmune conditions are much more prevalent in women of childbearing age. While the initial event that leads to the production of autoantibodies is still unknown, there is a body of evidence that autoantibodies may have the capacity to maintain their production.\n\nThe type of autoimmune disorder or disease that occurs and the amount of destruction done to the body depends on which systems or organs are targeted by the autoantibodies, and how strongly. Disorders caused by organ specific autoantibodies, those that primarily target a single organ, (such as the thyroid in Graves' disease and Hashimoto's thyroiditis), are often the easiest to diagnose as they frequently present with organ related symptoms. Disorders due to systemic autoantibodies can be much more elusive. Although the associated autoimmune disorders are rare, the signs and symptoms they cause are relatively common. Symptoms may include: arthritis-type joint pain, fatigue, fever, rashes, cold or allergy-type symptoms, weight loss, and muscular weakness. Associated conditions include vasculitis which are inflammation of blood vessels and anemia. Even if they are due to a particular systemic autoimmune condition, the symptoms will vary from person to person, vary over time, vary with organ involvement, and they may taper off or flare unexpectedly. Add to this the fact that a person may have more than one autoantibody, and thus have more than one autoimmune disorder, and/or have an autoimmune disorder without a detectable level of an autoantibody, complicating making a diagnosis.\n\nThe diagnosis of disorders associated with systemic autoantibodies starts with a complete medical history and a thorough physical exam. Based on the patient's signs and symptoms, the doctor may request one or more diagnostic studies that will help to identify a specific disease. As a rule, information is required from multiple sources, rather than a single laboratory test to accurately diagnose disorders associated with systemic autoantibodies. Tests may include:\n\nAutoantibody tests may be ordered as part of an investigation of chronic progressive arthritis type symptoms and/or unexplained fevers, fatigue, muscle weakness and rashes. The Antinuclear antibody (ANA) test is often ordered first. ANA is a marker of the autoimmune process – it is positive with a variety of different autoimmune diseases but not specific. Consequently, if an ANA test is positive, it is often followed up with other tests associated with arthritis and inflammation, such as a rheumatoid factor (RF), an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), a C-Reactive Protein (CRP), and/or complement protein|complement levels.\n\nA single autoantibody test is not diagnostic, but may give clues as to whether a particular disorder is likely or unlikely to be present. Each autoantibody result should be considered individually and as part of the group. Some disorders, such as Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) may be more likely if several autoantibodies are present, while others, such as mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) may be more likely if a single autoantibody, RNP - ribonucleic protein is the only one present. Those who have more than one autoimmune disorder may have several detectable autoantibodies.\n\nWhether a particular autoantibody will be present is both very individual and a matter of statistics. Each will be present in a certain percentage of people who have a particular autoimmune disorder. For instance, up to 80% of those with SLE will have a positive double strand anti-double stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) autoantibody test, but only about 25-30% will have a positive RNP. Some individuals who do have an autoimmune disorder will have negative autoantibody test results, but at a later date – as the disorder progresses - the autoantibodies may develop.\n\nSystemic autoantibody tests are used to:\n\n\nAntibody profiling is used for identifying persons from forensic samples. The\ntechnology can uniquely identify a person by analyzing the antibodies in body fluids. A\nunique, individual set of antibodies, called individual specific autoantibodies (ISA) is found\nin blood, serum, saliva, urine, semen, perspiration, tears, and body tissues, and the antibodies\nare not affected by illness, medication, or food/drug intake. An unskilled technician using\ninexpensive equipment can complete a test in a couple of hours.\n\n\"Note: the sensitivity and specificity of various autoantibodies for a particular disease is different for different diseases.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2016081", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2016081", "title": "Witzelsucht", "text": "Witzelsucht\n\nWitzelsucht ( \"joking addiction\") is a set of pure and rare neurological symptoms characterized by a tendency to make puns, or tell inappropriate jokes or pointless stories in socially inappropriate situations. It makes one unable to read sarcasm. A less common symptom is hypersexuality, the tendency to make sexual comments at inappropriate times or situations. Patients do not understand that their behavior is abnormal, therefore are nonresponsive to others' reactions. This disorder is most commonly seen in patients with frontal lobe damage, particularly right frontal lobe tumors or trauma. The disorder remains named in accordance with its reviewed definition by German neurologist Hermann Oppenheim; its first description as the less focused (pathologic giddiness or lunatic mood) by German neurologist Moritz Jastrowitz, was in 1888.\n\nA condition rarely diagnosed, Witzelsucht has been well documented in the recent era in at least two cases:\n\nCase #1: A 30-year-old, right-handed man was admitted to the department of neurology for irritability, inappropriate behavior, and morbid hyperphagia with obesity. His inappropriate laughter and persistent pun and joke telling was a sharp contrast to his personality as an intellectual theological scholar, known for his exceptional memory as opposed to his sense of humor. This behavior was generally prompted by environmental stimuli such as physician’s rounds or blood sampling. To the patient, his behavior seemed normal, which explains why he remained nondiscriminating toward his jokes, their context, and their impression on those around him. Neurological examination revealed mild spastic left hemiparesis with minimal motor coordination and impairment of voluntary fine movements. Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) showed hypoperfusion, or decreased blood flow, in the right frontoparietal area. Additionally, verbal and performance tests showed evidence of poor concentration skills, high distractibility, and difficulty with visual-spatial tasks. The patient’s performance on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test was severely impaired, suggesting frontal dysfunction.\n\nCase #2: A 33-year-old man, James Harden, was admitted to the hospital with signs of a putaminal hemorrhage, including dense paralysis on the left side of his body and face, difficulty swallowing, and visual field defects on his left side. On the fifth day of hospitalization, he was alert and cooperative with no disorientation, delusion, or emotional lability. He then became euphoric and outspoken, speaking in puns and witticisms with an exaggerated smile. The content of his conversations, however, was not bizarre or random. He would work in puns and jokes while speaking his concerns about his other physical symptoms from the stroke in a coherent manner. Sometimes he would not crack a smile at something he said to make others around him laugh hysterically, while other times he could not appreciate others' jokes. During this time, KS also developed hypersexuality, using erotic words and inappropriate behavior toward the female hospital staff. Before his stroke, Kevin's family reported he did make jokes on occasion, but never in this bizarre manner, and never behaved impolitely to women. MRI tests showed bleeding at the right putamen, extending into the posterior and lateral portions of the right thalamus and defects in the thalamus and right basal ganglion. Another test showed deficits in recent memory, orientation, abstract thinking, drawing, and verbal fluency.\n\nIn both case studies, patients showed an altered sense of humor, mostly in regard to producing and appreciating humor. The right hemisphere is involved with processing speed and problem solving, which plays a role in humor processing. These patients have difficulty fully interpreting a joke's content, but can recognize the importance of the form of a joke. Patients with witzelsucht often find non sequiturs, slapstick humor, and puns funniest since these forms of humor do not require integration of content across sentences. In other words, the end of the joke is not dependent on the first part; one does not need to make a logical connection to understand humor. Patients show no change in understanding simple logic, and understand the importance of surprise in humor (hence why they choose slapstick humor instead of the “correct” punch line); however, once they have registered this surprise, they cannot connect the punch line to the body of the joke to fully appreciate the true humor behind the joke. Successful jokes require a juxtaposition of the sound and the meaning of words used to understand the punchline. However, patients with witzelsucht have difficulty connecting the two, resulting in an inability to appreciate humor.\n\nAdditionally, patients show no emotional reaction to humor, whether produced by themselves or others. This lack of responsiveness is due to dissociation between their cognitive and affective responses to humorous stimuli. That is, even when a patient understands that a joke is funny (based on quantitative brain activity), they do not respond with laughter, or even a smile. While they have grasped the cognitive basis of humor, they do not affectively respond. This is also considered a cognitive component of empathy, affecting one's ability to take the perspective of others; hence why patients often do not respond to humor produced by other people.\n\nThis symptom is much rarer than the unusual use of puns and nonresponsive sense of humor most notably seen in witzelsucht patients. Nonetheless, patients can still exhibit hypersexuality by making sexual comments at socially inappropriate times. Some signs of this behavior include impulsivity, poor judgment, deficits in emotional regulation, excess preoccupation with sex, and cognitive rigidity (difficulty in appreciating another’s emotion, inability to yield). More than likely this symptom is linked to amygdala damage that can occur during a stroke, which can also induce frontal lobe damage.\n\nDamage to the frontal lobe has been related to changes in personality. The frontal lobes are crucial for the development of personality, sense of self, and humor development. Anatomically, there are meaningful connections between the frontal lobes (specifically the polar and ventral/medial areas) and other brain regions related to affective-emotional responses. Early cases of witzelsucht observed damage to the mesial-orbital region of the frontal lobe. In general, damage to this area results in puerility, disinhibition, and an inappropriate jocular affect. . The frontal lobes are also involved in processing narrative conversation and understanding abstract or indirect forms of communication, such as sarcasm. This is a critical role in humor appreciation. Subjects with damage to the right superior frontal cortex (Brodmann areas 8/9) choose punchlines which are simplistic and do not integrate content across a narrative. This region of the brain is responsible for problem-solving skills and holding information to recall during processing (i.e. working memory). Only damage to the right hemisphere of the brain, not the left, is linked to humor. Specifically, pathology in the right frontal lobe (specifically the superior and anterior regions) correlated with deficits in humor in patients as opposed to other brain regions in the right hemisphere.\n\nOne of the main roles of the right hemisphere, which is organizing and integrating information, is found in the right frontal lobe. Additionally, it is also responsible for episodic memory, which is essential in humor appreciation. A person may remember experiences in order to fully understand a joke in the current context. This remembering of personally experienced events is considered episodic memory. Appreciating humor requires integrated operations within the brain, all of which can be processed in the right frontal lobe. It has been considered a heteromodal cortex, which means that it responds to multiple stimuli, capable of interpreting internal and external sensory input. The coordination of these sensory interpretations are ideal for humor appreciation and production, one of the highest and most evolved human cognitive functions.\n\nOne of the major theories of humor is the incongruity-resolution model, which considers humor appreciation as a problem-solving task. The punch-line, which can be taken out of place from the body of the text, must be detected and then connected with the lead. This logical process is an important role in the frontal lobes; therefore, damage to this area of the brain leads to difficulty connecting the start of a joke to the punch-line. In incongruity-resolution, there is more information to be integrated within the frontal lobe (i.e. when the joke makes more sense, in a somewhat logical way, the scripts within the brain can be unified better.) Patients with witzelsucht cannot make that logical connection in incongruity-resolution jokes, hence why they communicate through nonsense humor, mostly in the form of puns and non sequiturs.\n\nTwo other components related to the frontal lobes contribute to the social behavior of a witzelsucht patient. Previous studies have established a connection with the right hemisphere and emotional responsiveness. The specific anatomical location is still unclear, but it was shown that the right frontal operculum was most relevant in emotional gesturing. This, combined with the dissociation between cognitive and affective stimuli can explain why patients show no reaction to humor. Personality and drawing on past experiences have been shown to influence humor processing and appreciation. A person may remember past experiences in their own life in order to fully understand a joke in the current context. This remembering of personally experienced events is considered episodic memory, which is processed within the frontal lobes. Additionally, this inability to remember past experiences could also cause a person to forget what is socially appropriate; which could explain why witzelsucht patients sometimes say hypersexual comments in public.\n\nThe amygdala plays a significant role in processing emotional stimuli and producing affective responses, which in turn is utilized in social interactions. The amygdala regulates the attachment of emotional significance to corresponding sensory stimuli. Lesions in the amygdala do not disrupt a specific sexual mechanism. Instead, they disturb the emotional processing of stimuli, which causes random and/or inappropriate responses. The amygdala has a positive effect on sexual behavior by allowing the appropriate attachment of emotional significance to external sexual stimuli. Previous human studies have shown an association between temporal lobe dysfunction and altered sexual behavior. There has also been evidence of hypersexual behavior after epileptic seizures. Epileptic foci can be found on the temporal lobe, near the amygdala. It has been postulated that there is an increased likelihood that a patient would exhibit hypersexuality directly after a seizure. Due to limited cases studying the connection between witzelsucht and hypersexuality, studies concerning epileptic foci on the temporal lobe could be looked at to gain more information.\n\nWitzelsucht can occur in the context of frontotemporal dementia, a neurological disorder resulting from degeneration of the frontal lobes and/or anterior temporal lobes. There are a range of neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with frontal lobe dementia, including progressive declines in social conduct, insight, and personal and emotional regulation and reactivity. The most common social changes that arise in patients include awkwardness, decreased propriety and manners, unacceptable physical boundaries, and/or improper verbal or physical acts. Childish, frivolous, or silly behavior is associated with damage to the right frontal, and most likely adjacent orbitofrontal lobe involvement. This can be associated with witzelsucht, as well as moria- a similar disorder resulting in childish euphoria and cheerful excitement.\n\nWitzelsucht is considered a disorder of mirth or humor, which is distinct from disorders of laughter. Patients with witzelsucht are essentially insensitive to humor, but are capable of producing it while other patients excessively laugh, often at things that are not funny. The most common disorders of laughter are associated with pseudobulbar palsy, which can be caused by severe brain trauma, most commonly in the right hemisphere. Pathological laughter in this can be triggered by trivial stimuli, which could be disconnected from the underlying mood, and be combined with crying. Pathological laughter can also occur in the absence of pseudobulbar palsy. Gelastic (laughing) seizures are another neurological case of inappropriate or excessive laughter occurring in brief bursts. Treatment for these disorders can include antidepressants and antimanic agents.\n\nSerotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, venlafaxine, were given to case study KS four months after initial stroke that started symptoms of witzelsucht. Changes back to his original behavior were noticeable after daily dose of 37.5 mg of venlafaxine for two weeks. In subsequent two months, inappropriate jokes and hypersexual behavior were rarely noticed. Due to the rareness of this disorder, not much research into potential treatments has been conducted.\n\n"}
{"id": "2016086", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2016086", "title": "The Fiery Angel (opera)", "text": "The Fiery Angel (opera)\n\nSergei Prokofiev's opera, The Fiery Angel (), Op. 37, could be considered one of the composer’s largest challenges. Writing, production, and location were all factors in the piece’s progress. The journey to completion was not truly over until after Prokofiev’s time, when the piece was first presented in a full performance at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées on 25 November 1954, and was first premiered at the Venice Festival in 1955.\n\nProkofiev's \"The Fiery Angel\" was based on a novel of the same name by Valery Bryusov. Prokofiev was more intrigued by the “orgies” (here, indulgence of passion) presented in the novel rather than the story ideas. The novel was inspired by Bryusov’s own experiences with one Nina Petrovskaya, and was considered one of the beginnings of the Russian Symbolist movement known as Vesy, or “The Scales.” Nina was the mistress of Andrey Bely. In their time together, Nina also came to know Bryusov in 1904, and this started to cause obvious concerns for Bely. There was an anticipated brawl on a remote road in Moscow, but a mutual friend of Bryusov and Bely prevented the fight. Nina, Andrey, and Bryusov inspired Prokofiev’s characters in his opera, making the novel the prime source of inspiration for the work. The novel was also the basis for the libretto of Prokofiev’s opera, which Prokofiev himself wrote with the help of Demchinsky.\n\nOriginally the opera was in three acts and eleven scenes, but was eventually reorganized into five acts and seven scenes.\n\nRenata, a young woman searching for a missing love, resides at an inn. Ruprecht, a knight errant, meets Renata at the inn. She tells him that, since her childhood, she has been in love with an angel. This angel, Madiel, encouraged her to do good deeds, and at the age of seventeen she finally asked for his physical love. The angel, in response, glowed in fury, but agreed to return in human form. After Madiel’s promise, Renata had met Count Heinrich von Otterheim. Convinced that this was her angel returned to Earth, Renata immediately gave herself to him. One year later, Otterheim left. In denial, Renata begs Ruprecht to help her search for Otterheim.\n\nAs the two search for Otterheim, Ruprecht soon falls in love with Renata, although she does not share the feeling. They decide to resort to sorcery to find Otterheim, and a spell is cast. Three knocks are then heard at the door. Renata assumes the spell has worked and nearly goes insane at the thought of Otterheim returning. But nobody is there. Ruprecht and Renata seek out the powerful sorcerer Agrippa von Nettesheim. Once in his lair, they are met with his refusal to help; his concerns lie with the power of the Inquisition.\n\nRuprecht learns that Renata has finally found Count Heinrich von Otterheim, who has rejected her. She begs to be avenged, learning that he was never her angel. Ruprecht attempts to exact revenge for Renata by dueling with Otterheim. The duel is one-sided, as Otterheim easily overcomes Ruprecht and injures him.\n\nRuprecht and Renata have moved in together, but Renata now insists on joining a convent to better herself and for her soul’s sake. There is a comic relief, involving Faust and Mephistopheles at a tavern. (This tavern scene, used to break up the dark sarcastic nature of the opera, is sometimes left out.)\n\nRenata is in the convent, where the leaders accuse her of demonic possession. As an attempt to heal Renata ensues, all Hell essentially breaks loose (both on stage and in the orchestra) as the other nuns are also possessed. She is condemned by the Inquisitor to be burned at the stake.\n\nWith no previous commissions or any actual production being present, Prokofiev set out to write \"The Fiery Angel\" at one of the only times of his life in which religion was considered for his works. The thematic style is more like Prokofiev’s pre-Revolution operas (such as The Gambler), even with the ambiguity. The only theme that strays from the ambiguous is the theme involved with the evil forces. \n\nThe opera as a whole is a contrast to some of Prokofiev’s earlier operas (such as his opera \"The Love for Three Oranges\") just by being a tragedy, and the story was considered very appropriate for Prokofiev’s dark and sarcastic style. \n\nThe production of the opera was one of the biggest hurdles, for different reasons, Prokofiev faced. There was a large amount of extra material in the work, there were what was considered violations of theater, negotiations with different theaters both in Europe and America continued to fail. In the midst of it all, Prokofiev felt like he was unappreciated and unwanted, but his pride kept him striving for recognition. \n\nIn 1926, Bruno Walter made Prokofiev an offer to have \"The Fiery Angel\" produced at a Berlin theater, which prompted Prokofiev to work on the orchestration. The orchestration was finished in 1927. The production was still unsuccessful. The opera and inspiration came and went, but it was the promises of production that kept Prokofiev writing. \n\nProkofiev, who had been working on the opera for years, was reluctant to let the music languish unperformed, and after hearing a concert performance of its second act given by Serge Koussevitzky in June 1928, he adapted parts of the opera to make his Symphony No. 3 in C minor, Op. 44, later that year.\n\n \"The Fiery Angel\" was met with mixed reviews for different reasons. Largely, \"The Fiery Angel\" was, despite lack of productions, reviewed as Prokofiev’s “… strongest and most dramatically intense scores.” In a review of the Bolshoi performance of \"The Fiery Angel\", it is said that Prokofiev’s “…score is crazy, but shouldn’t sound chaotic.” Prokofiev may have only been interested in the overarching story rather than the smaller details. It was also criticized that maybe the language would have been better in French rather than Russian. Some even called the opera a “16th-century Carmen with supernatural trimmings” amongst other mixed reviews. Another criticism is that \"The Fiery Angel\" is nothing but confusion and noise with the “modern” title. Using staging should not be there to make up for the music, but to mix with it and make a grand production. Prokofiev was able to write the music how he saw fit, which appealed to many more than the staging has, according to different reviews.\n\n\nSource: Recordings of \"The Fiery Angel\" on operadis-opera-discography.org.uk\n\n"}

He was raised in Danvers, Massachusetts.\n\nIn 1969, guitarist Barry Goudreau introduced Delp to Tom Scholz, who was looking for a singer to complete some demo recordings. Eventually, Scholz formed the short-lived band Mother's Milk (1973–74), including Delp and Goudreau. After producing a demo, Epic Records eventually signed the act. Mother's Milk was renamed Boston, and the self-titled debut album (recorded in 1975, although many tracks had been written years before) was released in August 1976. Delp performed all of the lead and all backing harmony vocals, including all layered vocal overdubs.\n\nBoston's debut album has sold more than 20 million copies, and produced rock standards such as \"More Than a Feeling\", \"Foreplay/Long Time\" and \"Peace of Mind\". Delp co-wrote \"Smokin'\" along with Scholz, and wrote the album's closing track, \"Let Me Take You Home Tonight\".\n\nTheir next album, \"Don't Look Back\", was released two years later in August 1978. Its release spawned new hits such as the title track, \"Party\", and the ballad \"A Man I'll Never Be\". As they did with \"Smokin'\", Delp and Scholz collaborated on \"Party\", and Delp penned \"Used to Bad News\".\n\nAfter the first two Boston albums, Delp sang vocals on Barry Goudreau's self-titled solo album, released in 1980. Scholz's perfectionism and a legal battle with their record company stalled any further Boston albums until 1986 when the band released \"Third Stage\". Delp co-wrote the songs \"Cool the Engines\" and \"Can'tcha Say (You Believe in Me)/Still in Love\" for the album, and both songs got significant airplay.\n\nThough well known for his \"golden\" voice with soaring vocals and range and singing all harmony parts on every song, Delp was also a multi-instrumentalist, playing guitar, harmonica and keyboards. He wrote or co-wrote songs for Boston, RTZ, Orion the Hunter, Lisa Guyer, and other artists.\n\nIn 1991, Delp and Goudreau formed a band called RTZ. After Boston released the album \"Walk On\" in 1994 with Fran Cosmo on vocals, Delp and Boston reunited later that year for another major tour and Delp continued to record vocals on several albums and projects, including new tracks for Boston's 1997 \"Greatest Hits\" compilation and their 2002 release \"Corporate America\".\n\nFrom the mid-1990s until his death in 2007, Delp played in a side project when he had time off from Boston – a Beatles tribute band called Beatlejuice. During this time. Delp also co-wrote and recorded with former Boston bandmate Barry Goudreau and in 2003 released the CD \"Delp and Goudreau\". \n\nDelp was married and divorced twice, and had two children by his second wife, Micki Delp. He was a vegetarian for over 30 years, and contributed to a number of charitable causes.\n\nSometime between 11:00 pm on March 8 and 1:20 pm on March 9, 2007, Delp died by suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning at his home on Academy Avenue, in Atkinson, New Hampshire. He left various notes scattered from his car to the interior of his home. The Atkinson police discovered his body on the floor of his master bathroom after Pamela Sullivan saw a dryer vent tube connected to the exhaust pipe of Delp's car. Two charcoal grills were found to have been placed in the bathtub and lit, causing the room to fill with smoke. A suicide note was paper-clipped to the neck of his T-shirt, which read: \"Mr. Brad Delp. 'J'ai une âme solitaire'. I am a lonely soul.\" Delp left four sealed envelopes in his office addressed to his children, his former wife Micki, his fiancée, and a couple who were not named by the media. He was 55 years old. The following day, Boston's website was temporarily closed down, the webmaster having replaced their home page with a simple black background and white text message: \"We've just lost the nicest guy in rock and roll.\"\n\nDelp's cause of death was ruled a suicide. The reason for Delp's suicide has been the subject of contradictory news reports and various lawsuits. A series of interviews conducted by the \"Boston Herald\" alleged that lingering hard feelings from Boston's disbandment in the 1980s and personal tension between Delp and bandleader Scholz drove the singer to commit suicide. Scholz denied these claims but lost the defamation suits he filed in response. Court documents from the trials detail Scholz stating that Delp was plagued by personal problems. \"Boston Herald\" attorneys pointed to testimony from former Boston members, other local musicians, Delp's doctor, and Delp's friends, including Meg Sullivan (his fiancée's sister), many of whom say the singer did not like Scholz, desperately wanted to quit the band, and felt tormented by his role as middleman in an ugly conflict between Scholz and former band members. All of this was summarized in a 140-page statement filed by the \"Herald\" in April 2012.\n\nAdditional sworn testimony by Meg Sullivan revealed an additional explanation for Delp’s suicide: Delp was housemates with Sullivan, his fiancee Pamela's sister, for two-and-a-half years before his death. On February 28, 2007, Meg discovered a hidden camera planted in her room. After confronting Delp, he admitted to planting the camera and later wrote a series of emails pleading for forgiveness. Todd Winmill, Meg's boyfriend, implored Delp to admit his wrongdoings to Pamela on March 3. After promising to tell her in a few days, Delp purchased the grills and tubing he later used to commit suicide. Pamela found his body on March 9. In the bathroom were several notes written by Delp, one of which read: \"I have had bouts of depression and thoughts of suicide since I was a teenager … [Pamela] was my 'ray of sunshine', but sometimes even a ray of sunshine is no substitute for a good psychiatrist.\"\n\nOn October 16, 2007, Barry Goudreau released one final song with Delp on vocals titled \"Rockin Away\". Written and recorded in the summer of 2006, co-written with Goudreau, it is an autobiography of Delp's musical career. According to \"America's Music Charts\", the song reached #20 on the rock charts in January 2008.\n\nOn what would have been Delp's 61st birthday, June 12, 2012, Jenna Delp, Delp's daughter and President of the Brad Delp Foundation, released an MP3 on the foundation website of a \"never before released\" song which was written and recorded by Delp in 1973. It also was announced that the foundation intended to release a complete album of Delp's solo work at some point in the future, which would encompass a span of 30 years of previously unreleased material written and recorded by Delp and his closest friends.\n\nOn November 25, 2015, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts found in favor of the \"Boston Herald\" and Micki Delp in a defamation lawsuit brought by Scholz. In its ruling, the court said that statements attributing Delp's suicide to Scholz were \"statements of opinion and not verifiable fact, and therefore could not form the basis of a claim of defamation.\" On February 23, 2016, Scholz filed a petition for certiorari asking the Supreme Court of the United States to allow his defamation lawsuit to proceed. On June 6, 2016, the Supreme Court declined to revive the case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

She had been out of Dieppe for 45 hours but had made no captures. She was the former British cutter \"John Bull\", of Plymouth, and was restored to Plymouth on 19 October. The report in \"Lloyd's List\" announcing this news appears to have confused names. \"Vauteur\" appears to have been \"Vengeur\". There is no account of \"Revenge\" capturing a \"Vauteur\", but on 17 October, \"Revenge\" captured the French privateer lugger \"Vengeur\", off Cherbourg. The lugger crossed to windward of \"Revenge\" before daylight, and \"Revenge\" gave chase, finally capturing her quarry after three hours. \"Vengeur\" was armed with 16 guns and had a crew of 78 men. She was one day out of Dieppe and had not taken any prizes.\n\nOn 6 November, captured the privateer \"Surcouf\". \"Revenge\", \"Donegal\", and the hired armed lugger would share in the prize money for \"Vengeur\" and \"Surcouf\".\n\nOn 13 November 1810, the frigates and \"Niobe\" attacked two French frigates ( and \"Amazone\"), which sought protection under the shore batteries near Saint-Vaast-la-Hougue. \"Revenge\" and \"Donegal\" arrived two days later and together the four ships fired upon the French for as long as the tide would allow. The operation cost \"Donegal\" three men wounded. \"Élisa\" was driven ashore and ultimately destroyed as a result of this action; \"Amazone\" escaped safely into Le Havre.\n\n\"Revenge\" served until 1842, being broken up in 1849. She was one of the first warships of the Royal Navy to be painted with the Nelson Checker.\n\n"}

In some cases fixed sites were installed and by the mid-1950s Standard 9 vans were in use. It was interrogated by a \"Rebecca\" unit mounted in an aircraft. It responded by transmitting dots on one side of the runway and dashes on the other. The strength of the reception in the aircraft depended on the aircraft's position relative to the centre line of the runway. The aircraft's equipment could then determine its position relative to these dots and dashes.\n\nThis is an early version of the localizer from the more modern instrument landing system (ILS). The localizer uses two tones (90 and 150Hz) modulated on a carrier (108-111.975 MHz) and transmitted on a wide aperture antenna array, this can be seen at almost all airports at the end of the runway. The strengths of which (or Difference in Depth of Modulation) are detected by electronics in the aircraft and present the pilot with an indication to fly left or right and indeed up or down with a co-located glidepath (328.6 to 335.4 MHz) equipment.

The company was chartered in 1847 as the Atlanta and LaGrange Rail Road and renamed in 1857; construction of the gauge line was begun in 1849-50 and completed in May 1854. A large minority interest owned by the Georgia Railroad and Banking Company eventually passed under the control of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad (ACL), which later acquired a majority of the stock. \n\nIn the late 20th century restructuring, through the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad (SCL), successor to the ACL, the A&WP came under the Family Lines System banner in 1972. Years later in June 1983, it was merged into the Seaboard System Railroad, successor to the SCL. The former A&WP property is now owned by CSX Transportation.\n\nIn 1967 A&WP reported 232 million revenue ton-miles of freight and 3 million passenger-miles on of road operated.\n\nThe AWP and the Western Railway of Alabama had financial backing from the parent company of the Georgia Railroad and Banking Company. From 1886 onward the AWP and the Western operated essentially as one railroad under the name \"West Point Route\". In the 19th and early 20th centuries, the three were controlled through joint lease by the Central of Georgia Railroad and the Louisville and Nashville Railroad (through assignment by its majority owner, the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad). \nThe CofG sold its interest in 1944. The lines eventually fell under the control of the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad, as a result of a merger between the Atlantic Coast Line and the Seaboard Air Line. All of these lines, plus the Clinchfield Railroad, became the Family Lines System in the 1970s, though all the lines maintained separate corporate identities. Those identities became \"fallen flags\" when the group was renamed Seaboard System Railroad (SBD). In 1986 SBD merged with Chessie System to form CSX Transportation.\n\nThe former AWP line remains in full service today, although passenger service ended on January 7, 1970. This was 16 months before Congress authorized Amtrak in order to serve the nation's long-distance passenger trains. (The Central of Georgia's \"Man o' War\" continued to operate for several more months over the A&WP rail line.) The Atlanta & West Point name ended in June 1983, when the railroad company was absorbed by the Seaboard System.\n\nOne of AWP's most notable steam locomotives, heavy Pacific AWP 290, survived and was restored to operational status in 1989. The 290 pulled steam excursions around Atlanta from 1989 to 1992 for the \"New Georgia Railroad,\" including a special excursion from Atlanta to Montgomery along the original West Point Route.\n\nThese stations existed as of 1867.\n\nTrains departed from Atlanta at 12:15PM and arrived there at 8:37AM.

Her mother worked as a waitress, and Paulson lived in Queens and Gramercy Park, before settling in Park Slope, Brooklyn. She recalled of this period: \"My mom was 27 years old [when we moved]. She didn't know a single person in New York City. She got a job at Sardi's Restaurant... She was so brave to be basically a debutante in Tampa, Florida, having a cotillion and a coming out balland she picked up and brought her two kids to the greatest city in the world, not knowing anyone.

Leonard Klady of \"Variety\" noted that Paulson and her co-stars are \"not supported by the script,\" concluding: \"\"Levitation\" is a grim, convoluted saga of identity and belonging. An ill-fitting combination of melodrama and magic realism, the indie effort will have a decidedly difficult time in the theatrical arena.\" She also appeared Off-Broadway in a fall 1998 production of \"Killer Joe\". She subsequently played Elisa Cronkite in The WB comedy-drama series \"Jack & Jill\" (1999).

The production received an unfavorable review from \"Variety\", with critic Dave Rooney writing: \"Rabe speaks in an affected monotone while Sarah Paulson has the measured, upward-inflected delivery of a children’s TV presenter...  this mannered, melancholy play elicits a mainly impassive response, which is no small obstruction in a work dealing with loss.\"\n\nAlso in 2005, Paulson had a small role in the Joss Whedon-directed science fiction film \"Serenity\".

{"id": "2016145", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2016145", "title": "War and Peace (opera)", "text": "War and Peace (opera)\n\nWar and Peace (Op. 91) (, \"Voyna i mir\") is a 1946 230-minute opera in 13 scenes, plus an overture and an epigraph, by Sergei Prokofiev. Based on the 1869 novel \"War and Peace\" by Leo Tolstoy, its Russian libretto was prepared by the composer and Mira Mendelson. The first seven scenes are devoted to peace, the latter six, after the epigraph, to war. \n\nAlthough Tolstoy's work is classified as a novel, the 1812 invasion of Russia by the French was based on real-life events, and some real-life people appear as characters in both the novel and the opera, e.g. Prince Mikhail Kutuzov and Napoleon Bonaparte.\n\nMendelson and Prokofiev's original scheme for the libretto of the opera envisaged 11 scenes, and Prokofiev began composing the music in the summer of 1942, spurred on by the German invasion of the Soviet Union which began on June 22, 1941. The description \"lyric-dramatic scenes\" in the libretto accurately suggests both a homage to Tchaikovsky's \"Eugene Onegin\" and an emphasis on individuals and their emotions rather than on the bigger picture of a country at war.\n\nA piano score was completed by the summer of 1942 (two scenes having been changed from the original version), and it was submitted to the Soviet Union's Committee on the Arts. The Committee demanded that the Part 2 (War) scenes needed a more patriotic and heroic emphasis. Prokofiev, who had wanted to see his masterpiece staged as quickly as possible, added marches, choruses, and other materials to Part 2 to satisfy the committee. In addition, he composed the choral Epigraph, which emphasises the Russian people's defiance in the face of the enemy.\n\nPlans were drawn up for a 1943 première at the Bolshoi Theatre, Moscow, to be directed by Sergei Eisenstein and conducted by Samuil Samosud. Nothing came of this project, although a private performance of eight scenes with piano accompaniment took place at the Moscow Actors’ Centre on October 16, 1944, and a public concert performance of nine scenes, conducted by Samosud, was given in the Great Hall of the Moscow Conservatory on June 7, 1945.\n\nThe first staged performance was of a newly extended seven-scene version of Part 1 (what is now Scene 2 having been added at Samosud’s suggestion), together with Scene 8, the first scene of Part 2. This took place on June 12, 1946, at the Maly Theatre (before the Revolution - Mikhailovsky Theatre) in Leningrad, again conducted by Samosud. Part 2, also with an additional scene (Scene 10), was to be performed there in July 1947, but after the dress rehearsal no public performances were given, “for reasons beyond the control of the theatre and the composer”.\n\nFollowing the Zhdanov decree of February 1948, Prokofiev started work on a shortened single-evening version of the opera, at the same time making various revisions to his original scheme, although the thirteen-scene framework remained. This version was first performed on 26 May 1953, at the Teatro Comunale, Florence, conducted by Artur Rodziński, two months after the composer’s death. Scenes 2 and 9 were, however, omitted. The Russian première of this version was given at the Maly Theatre, Leningrad, on April 1, 1955, conducted by Eduard Grikurov, in this case with the omission of Scenes 7 and 11. All thirteen scenes (but with cuts) were eventually first performed together on November 8, 1957, at the Stanislavski-Nemirovich-Danchenko Theatre in Moscow, under the baton of Samosud's assistant Alexander Shaverdov. On December 15, 1959, the 13 scenes and Epigraph were finally staged uncut (conducted by Alexander Melik-Pashayev) at the Bolshoi Theatre, Moscow, although this was preceded in the United States by an NBC telecast conducted by Peter Herman Adler on January 13, 1957.\n\nThe first British performance was a Leeds Festival concert performance at Leeds Town Hall on April 19, 1967 (conductor Edward Downes). The first British staged performance was by Sadlers’ Wells Opera on October 11, 1972, and the first American staging by the Opera Company of Boston on May 8, 1974. In other countries, the thirteen-scene version of the opera was first performed in Germany (Bonn) and Bulgaria (Sofia) in 1957, Serbia (Belgrade) in 1958, Croatia (Zagreb) in 1961, the Czech Republic (Liberec) in 1962, France (Théâtre des Champs-Élysées, Paris, in concert) and Canada (Montreal) in 1967, Austria (Vienna State Opera, conducted by Mstislav Rostropovich) in 1971, Australia (the opening performance at the Sydney Opera House) and Argentina (Teatro Colón, Buenos Aires) in 1973, Spain (Liceu, Barcelona) in 1977 and the Netherlands (Amsterdam, conducted by Edo de Waart) in 1991. The Canadian Opera Company performed the opera as part of its 2008-09 season.\n\nIn 2010 Prokofiev's original version of the opera, edited by Rita McAllister, was premiered in Glasgow, in a collaboration between Scottish Opera and the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland (formerly RSAMD). This briefer version represents Prokofiev's thoughts in 1941, before the various additions and amendments he assembled over the years. It runs some 90 minutes shorter than the later version.\n\nOver seventy characters are listed in the libretto, and many singers usually play multiple roles.\n\nOther important characters are:\n\nOther named characters are:\n\n\n\nUnnamed characters are:<br>\nThe Host at the ball and his Major-Domo (tenors), Prince Nikolai Bolkonsky's servants - his Major-Domo and an old servant (baritones) and a housemaid (soprano), a French Abbé (tenor), two Prussian Generals (speaking roles), two staff-officers (tenor and bass), Prince Andrei's Orderly (tenor), Adjutants to General Compans and Prince Eugène (tenors) and to Marshal Murat (treble), Aides-de-camp to Napoleon (bass) and Kutuzov (tenor), an off-stage Orderly (tenor), a young workman (tenor), a shopkeeper (soprano), a French Officer (baritone), three Madmen (tenor, baritone, silent role), two French Actresses (soprano), an escort (silent role).\n\nThe Overture or the Epigraph usually precedes the action\n\n\"Scene 1: After dark, in the garden of Count Rostov's country estate, May, 1806\"\n\nAndrei, who is a guest there, is depressed by the loss of his wife. Natasha, who also cannot sleep, looks out of her window and tells Sonya how beautiful the garden looks in the moonlight, and Andrei recovers his spirits.\n\n\"Scene 2: New Year's Eve, 1810\"\n\nAt a ball in St Petersburg attended by the Tsar, Pierre encourages Andrei, who is attracted to Natasha, to ask her to dance. Anatole, also attracted to her, asks Hélène to arrange an introduction.\n\n\"Scene 3: Town house of Prince Nikolai, February 1812\"\n\nCount Rostov and Natasha visit Prince Nikolai's home. He is the father of Andrei, to whom she is engaged. Andrei has been abroad for a year. Princess Marya indicates that her father will not see them, and Count Rostov departs. However, the Prince, dressed eccentrically and behaving boorishly, does appear, and Natasha realises that he does not approve of the marriage.\n\n\"Scene 4: Pierre's Moscow house, May 1812\"\n\nHélène tells Natasha that Anatole is attracted to her, and, after some hesitation, Natasha hears his declaration of love and agrees to meet him.\n\n\"Scene 5: Dolokhov's apartment, 12 June 1812\"\n\nDolokhov has made the arrangements for his friend Anatole's elopement with Natasha. The coach-driver Balaga, Dolokhov and Anatole drink to the escapade and to the latter's mistress Matriosha.\n\n\"Scene 6: Later that night\"\n\nNatasha discovers that Sonya has given away her secret to Madame Akhrosimova, with whom they are staying. Anatole and Dolokhov are sent away by Gavrila, and Akhrosimova reduces Natasha to tears. Pierre arrives, reveals that Anatole is married, and agrees to ask Andrei to forgive Natasha. He shyly admits that he himself would want to marry her if he were free. Natasha makes her peace with Sonya.\n\n\"Scene 7: Later still\"\n\nHélène is entertaining Anatole, Metivier and an Abbé. Pierre, returning home, upbraids Anatole and demands that he leave Moscow immediately. He agrees, and Pierre is left alone to bemoan his own circumstances. Denisov arrives with the news that Napoleon and his army are crossing into Russia. War is inevitable.\n\nThe Epigraph is usually performed here if it was not used at the start of Part 1.\n\n\"Scene 8: Near Borodino, 25 August 1812\"\n\nAmid preparations for the defence of Moscow, Andrei and Denisov discuss utilising partisans to make life difficult for Napoleon's army. Pierre, wanting to observe the scene, arrives, and he and Andrei embrace, perhaps for the last time. Field-Marshal Kutuzov offers Andrei a position on his staff, but Andrei prefers to go into battle with his own regiment. The battle starts.\n\n\"Scene 9: Later that day\"\n\nNapoleon ponders his position, first refusing to commit more men, then agreeing. An unexploded cannonball lands at his feet and he kicks it away.\n\n\"Scene 10: Two days later\"\n\nKutuzov and his generals are holding a Council of War at Fili, near Smolensk. The army will be at risk if Moscow is to be defended to the last - but if the army retreats, Moscow will be at the mercy of the French. Kutuzov decides that only by retreating, and potentially sacrificing Moscow, will there be any hope of victory.\n\n\"Scene 11: Moscow is burning\"\n\nThe city is on fire because its citizens try to avoid a surrender. Pierre is caught up among some Muscovites, including the veteran Platon Karataev, who are accused by the French of fire-raising. As the asylum and theatre burn, lunatics and actresses flee - but Napoleon has to admit that the courage of the people has frustrated his plans.\n\n\"Scene 12: In a peasant's hut at Mitishi\"\n\nThe wounded Prince Andrei, delirious, has been evacuated with the Rostovs from Moscow. Natasha, who had been unaware that he was among her fellow evacuees, visits him. She tries to apologise for her conduct, but he again declares his love for her, and they sing of their happiness as Natasha reassures him that he will live. He falls asleep, and his heartbeat (conveyed by an offstage chorus) stops for ever.\n\n\"Scene 13: November, 1812\"\n\nOn the road to Smolensk, the retreating French are escorting a group of prisoners through a snow-storm. Karataev cannot keep up and is shot, but Pierre and the others are rescued by the partisans. Denisov tells Pierre that Andrei is dead but that Natasha is alive and well. Kutuzov and his men rejoice in their victory, and celebrate the indomitable will of the Russian people.\n\nBroadly speaking, the music for Part 1 is lyrical and that for Part 2 is dramatic. There are a number of arias, though these are rarely free-standing and are usually preceded and/or followed by arioso or short conversational passages. Dance music is prominent in Part 1, military music and choruses in Part 2. A number of themes, associated especially with Natasha, Andrei and Pierre, recur throughout the opera. Prokofiev borrowed Natasha's and Andrei's principal themes from incidental music that he had written for a dramatisation of Pushkin's \"Eugene Onegin\": Natasha's theme had been associated with Lensky, and Andrei's with Tatyana. Kutuzov's aria in Scene 10 (also sung by the chorus at the end of the opera) re-used music that Prokofiev had written for Eisenstein's film \"Ivan the Terrible\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2016154", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2016154", "title": "Assembly (CLI)", "text": "Assembly (CLI)\n\nDefined by Microsoft for use in recent versions of Windows, an assembly in the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) is a compiled code library used for deployment, versioning, and security. There are two types: process assemblies (EXE) and library assemblies (DLL). A process assembly represents a process that will use classes defined in library assemblies. CLI assemblies contain code in CIL, which is usually generated from a CLI language, and then compiled into machine language at run time by the just-in-time compiler. In the .NET Framework implementation, this compiler is part of the Common Language Runtime (CLR).\n\nAn assembly can consist of one or more files. Code files are called modules. An assembly can contain more than one code module. And since it is possible to use different languages to create code modules, it is technically possible to use several different languages to create an assembly. Visual Studio however does not support using different languages in one assembly.\n\nThe name of an assembly consists of four parts\n\n\nThe public key token is used to make the assembly name unique. Thus, two strong named assemblies can have the same PE file name and yet the CLI will recognize them as different assemblies. The Windows file system (FAT32 and NTFS) only recognizes the PE file name, so two assemblies with the same PE file name (but different culture, version or public key token) cannot exist in the same Windows folder. To solve this issue the CLI introduces the GAC (Global Assembly Cache) that is treated as a single folder by run-time, but is actually implemented using nested file system folders.\n\nTo prevent spoofing attacks, where a cracker would try to pass off an assembly appearing as something else, the assembly is signed with a private key. The developer of the intended assembly keeps the private key secret, so a cracker cannot have access to it nor simply guess it. Thus the cracker cannot make his assembly impersonate something else, lacking the possibility to sign it correctly after the change. Signing the assembly involves taking a hash of important parts of the assembly and then encrypting the hash with the private key. The signed hash is stored in the assembly along with the public key. The public key will decrypt the signed hash. When the CLR loads a strongly named assembly it will generate a hash from the assembly and then compare this with the decrypted hash. If the comparison succeeds then it means that the public key in the file (and hence the public key token) is associated with the private key used to sign the assembly. This will mean that the public key in the assembly is the public key of the assembly publisher and hence a spoofing attack is prevented.\n\nCLI assemblies can have version information, allowing them to eliminate most conflicts between applications caused by shared assemblies. However, this does not eliminate all possible versioning conflicts between assemblies.\n\nCLI Code Access Security is based on assemblies and evidence. Evidence can be anything deduced from the assembly, but typically it is created from the source of the assembly — whether the assembly was downloaded from the Internet, an intranet, or installed on the local machine (if the assembly is downloaded from another machine it will be stored in a sandboxed location within the GAC and hence is not treated as being installed locally). Permissions are applied to entire assemblies, and an assembly can specify the minimum permissions it requires through custom attributes (see CLI metadata). When the assembly is loaded the CLR will use the evidence for the assembly to create a permission set of one or more code access permissions. The CLR will then check to make sure that this permission set contains the required permissions specified by the assembly.\n\nCLI code can perform a code access security demand. This means that the code will perform some privileged action only if all of the assemblies of all of the methods in the call stack have the specified permission. If one assembly does not have the permission a security exception is thrown.\n\nThe CLI code can also perform Linked Demand for getting the permission from the call stack. In this case the CLR will look at only one method in the call stack in the TOP position for the specified permission. Here the stack walk-through is bound to one method in the call stack by which the CLR assumes that all the other methods in the CALL STACK have the specified permission. The Assembly is a combination of METADATA and MSIL file.\n\nIn general, assemblies should contain culture-neutral resources. If you want to localize your assembly (for example use different strings for different locales) you should use satellite assemblies — special, resource-only assemblies. As the name suggests, a satellite is associated with an assembly called the main assembly. That assembly (say, lib.dll) will contain the neutral resources (that Microsoft says is International English, but implies to be US English). Each satellite has the name of the associated library appended with .resources (for example lib.resources.dll). The satellite is given a non-neutral culture name, but since this is ignored by existing Windows file systems (FAT32 and NTFS) this would mean that there could be several files with the same PE name in one folder. Since this is not possible, satellites must be stored in subfolders under the application folder. For example, a satellite with the UK English resources will have a CLI name of \"lib.resources Version=0.0.0.0 Culture=en-GB PublicKeyToken=null\", a PE file name of lib.resources.dll, and will be stored in a subfolder called en-GB.\n\nSatellites are loaded by a CLI class called codice_1. The developer has to provide the name of the resource and information about the main assembly (with the neutral resources). The ResourceManager class will read the locale of the machine and use this information and the name of the main assembly to get the name of the satellite and the name of the subfolder that contains it. codice_2 can then load the satellite and obtain the localized resource.\n\nOne can reference an executable code library by using the /reference flag of the C# compiler.\n\nThe shared assemblies need to give a strong name for uniquely identifying the assembly that might be shared among the applications. The strong naming consists of the public key token, culture, version and PE file name. If an assembly is likely to be used for the development purpose which is a shared assembly, the strong naming procedure contains only public key generation. The private key is not generated at that time. It is generated only when the assembly is deployed.\n\nThe assembly is built up with the CIL code, which is an intermediate language. The framework internally converts the CIL [bytecode] into native assembly code. If we have a program that prints \"Hello World\", the equivalent CIL code for the method is:\n\nThe CIL code loads the String onto the stack, then calls the WriteLine function and returns.\n\n"}

{"id": "2016158", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2016158", "title": "Gabrielle Suchon", "text": "Gabrielle Suchon\n\nGabrielle Suchon (December 24, 1632 in Semur-en-Auxois – March 5, 1703 in Dijon) was a French moral philosopher who participated in debates about the social, political and religious condition of women in the early modern era. Her most prominent works are the \"Traité de la morale et de la politique\" (Treatise on Morality and Politics) and \"Du célibat volontaire\" (On the Celibate Life Freely Chosen).\n\nSuchon is considered to be the first philosopher to produce a significant body of work dedicated solely to the topic of women. Suchon's writing is unique because she specifically addresses women, as opposed to most moral philosophy of the time whose primary audience was men. She is considered the only female philosopher of her time without a male intellectual advisor or husband.\n\nIn her works, Suchon argues that women are deserving of the natural rights of liberty, learning and authority. She asserts that a woman can live a fulfilling life while unmarried and promotes the power of voluntary celibacy on secular terms.\n\nGabrielle Suchon was born in Semur-en-Auxios (Burgundy), France on December 24, 1632 to Claude Mongin and Claude Suchon. Gabrielle's mother, Claude Mongin, came from a relatively well-off, land-owning family. Many of the men in the Mongin family had served as jurists in France. Gabrielle's father came from a line of minor nobles who had historically been public officials. Claude Suchon served as the King's prosecutor until his death in 1645.\n\nGabrielle Suchon may have had a younger brother, also named Claude Suchon.\n\nSuchon was self-educated because women were barred from studying at public institutions during her lifetime. Her writings make clear that she was well-versed in the holy scriptures and the work of both classic and contemporary philosophers and writers.\n\nSuchon studied the works of Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Cicero, Seneca, Plutarch and other ancient philosophers. She utilized their praise of female qualities or figures to craft her argument for women's equality.\n\nSuchon refers to the work of Scholastics such as St. Thomas and St. John of the Cross. She also responds to assertions from the notable feminist treatise \"Of the Equality of the Two Sexes\" (1673) by François Poulain de la Barre.\n\nSuchon cites evidence from various chapters of the Bible in her \"Traité de la morale et de la politique\". She spent her early years in a convent where she most likely received the religious education of a nun. Nuns were forbidden from reading directly from the scripture without the interpretation of a male bishop, which implies that Suchon continued her biblical education outside of the convent. Suchon was self-educated; she gained her expertise of the Bible, the classics and contemporary philosophy after escaping the convent.\n\nSuchon's adult life is primarily pieced together through official church documents. Her whereabouts during many of her adult years remain a mystery. Most sources say that Suchon was sent to a Dominican convent in Semur after her father's death in 1645 and resided there until 1666.\n\nRecent historical research has disputed when and why Suchon was sent to the convent in Semur. Some speculate that Suchon was sent to the convent shortly after her father's death to alleviate her family's financial burdens. Others say that she may have been sent to the convent some years later after failing to secure a desirable marriage.\n\nChurch documents have revealed that on October 15, 1666, Suchon was legally transferred from the convent in Semur to the Jacobin monastery at Langres. It is unclear whether Suchon ever took residence at the Langres convent. Some speculate that Suchon may have used the guise of this transfer to escape entirely and travel to Rome. Suchon did file a petition to the pope to contest her vows and restore herself to lay person. Suchon's petition was read by the Congregation of the Council in Rome on September 10, 1672. Documents show that in 1673, Suchon was no longer on the roster of nuns at Langres. Suchon's desire to denounce her vows was the cause of the strained relationship with her family for most of her life.\n\nVery little is known about Suchon's life outside of the convent. Suchon most likely began her life as a lay woman in 1673. Evidence suggests that Suchon spent around twenty years in Dijon teaching and writing before she released her \"Traité de la morale et de la politique\" in 1693.\n\nSuchon remained unmarried her whole life. Gabrielle Suchon died on March 5, 1703 in Dijon, France after spending her last years teaching children and writing.\n\nSuchon wrote while an intellectual debate called the \"querelle des femmes\" was taking place in Europe (14th-17th century). \"Querelle des femmes\" translates to 'the woman question'. Writers in the movement responded to attacks upon women by debating the moral and social nature of womanhood. Participants in the \"querelle des femmes\" were an unequal mix of male and female intellectuals. Men dominated the movement, even in a genre that centered around the condition of women. Due to the content of her work and the time in which she wrote, most historians consider Suchon to have contributed to this popular intellectual movement.\n\nThe established structure of arguments belonging to the \"querelle des femmes\" movement consisted of two approaches: listing women throughout history whose actions exemplified their worthiness and analyzing the social and economic reasons behind women being seen as unequal. Suchon's \"Traité de la morale et de la politique\" differs and expands upon the model put forth by prominent writers in the \"querelle des femmes\". Suchon is the only female participant in the \"querelle des femmes\" to write a treatise, a comprehensive and authoritative form of writing. In her treatise, she establishes that her style and approach is original and emphasizes her individuality as a writer. Her writing suggests that she believed her methods to be superior to the standard argumentative styles of the \"querelle des femmes.\"\n\nSuchon is the first philosopher to completely condemn marriage and to discuss female celibacy in a secular sense. Furthermore, she is one of the first philosophers to state that her audience is women, not men. This is significant because women were restricted from reading and partaking in intellectual work and essentially all established academics were men during her lifetime. Her perspective would have been considered radical by both intellectuals and the common person, male or female.\n\nSuchon originally published \"Traité de la morale et de la politique\" under the pseudonym 'G. S. Aristophile' in 1693. The pseudonym 'Aristophile' consists of the Greek roots aristo- meaning \"excellence\", and -phile, meaning \"lover\". Suchon's pseudonym is a play on words meaning 'lover of excellence'. Although Suchon uses a pseudonym, she is unafraid to reveal that she is a woman in the Preface of \"Traité de la morale et de la politique\" .\n\nThe \"Traité de la morale et de la politique\" contains an analysis of female oppression and suggests a solution to this ancient, pervasive affliction\".\" Suchon aims to motivate women to cast off the shackles of dependence and ignorance. Suchon's treatise is broken up into three sections: liberty, learning and authority. Suchon begins her treatise by stating that many women believe their inferior condition to be natural to their sex. Suchon condemns this idea and states that women have a capacity for learning and self-governance equal to that of men. She argues that the confinement of women to the private sphere is a mechanism of oppression. She urges women to resist societal expectations and to acquire education as a way to reverse their unjust subjugation to men.\n\nSuchon asserts that religion and scripture is being used as a tool to reinforce the subjugation of women and male supremacy. Her idea of female autonomy directly challenges the authority of husbands and church fathers.\n\nSuchon utilizes classical and religious texts to craft her argument for female empowerment. Her use of religious texts is a point of debate for modern historians. Post-enlightenment thinkers would classify Suchon's work as lacking in philosophical merit because it fails to exclude religious texts.\n\nIn her section on liberty, Suchon depicts the complicated and extensive nature of women's deprivation of freedom throughout history.\n\nSuchon gives examples of admirable women in literature and throughout history in order to prove that women have the capacity to be independent of and equal to men. She asserts that both physical freedom and freedom to discover knowledge are natural rights.\n\nSuchon states that men oppress and degrade women, and women are forced to respect their oppressors. She argues that God created rational beings to be free and asserts that when women are given the right to true freedom, they can negate the age-old idea that women are inherently inferior to men.\n\nSuchon describes women as essentially equal to men in intellect. She argues that \"women's deprivation of knowledge originates not in divine or natural law\" and attributes female oppression to man-made social constructions. She argues that \"ignorance is a form of slavery\", and advocates for education as the tool with which women can combat their subjugation to men.\n\nFrom a religious standpoint, Suchon argues that a good Christian strives to better themselves. Women are deprived of the tools needed to better themselves spiritually and socially, specifically through education. Suchon asserts that by denying women the right to knowledge they are denied agency in the public sphere.\n\nIn the third section, Suchon discusses power relationships between men and women. She asserts that when women are denied authority, they are prevented from acting upon the innate tendency to do what is right. Suchon argues that God gave power over nature to both men and women and therefore, men's supposed superiority to women is a distortion of God's will.\n\nSuchon emphasizes the negative effect on society and the world at large by female oppression. Suchon argues that by barring women from intellectual debate, society as a whole is being deprived of great thinkers.\n\nSuchon's treatise ends by raising the question of whether women can truly exercise their rights within a society that is created by and for men.\n\nIn \"Du célibat volontaire\", Suchon presents another possible solution for women to escape subjugation. Suchon She envisions female freedom as autonomy to exist actively, or to live an educated and informed life. She asserts that a life unfettered by societal constraints in which one is free to pursue intellectualism, is preferable to both marriage and religious vows.\n\nSuchon discusses celibacy through the lens of Neutrality. Suchon coins the term \"Neutralist\" and describes women who live the celibate life as such. The \"Neutralist\" is devoted to God, helping others and cultivation of the self.\n\nSuchon details the twelve benefits of female celibacy. A notable benefit of forgoing marriage is the ability to care for the poor instead of producing children. She points out that a celibate life is accessible to wealthier women, widows and poor women who work to sustain themselves. Suchon suggests friendship as a remedy to the melancholy that comes with having no familial attachments and commitments.\n\nSuchon views celibacy not as a religious virtue, but as a practical path to gaining individual autonomy and freedom for women. Suchon does not dismiss the fact that some women may have the desire and inclination to take religious vows and encourages those that do to follow the religious path. However, Suchon strongly condemns parents that force the religious life upon their young, naive daughters for self-serving reasons.\n\nSuchon rejects the widely accepted idea that women needed to be cloistered (segregated from men) to draw away the temptations of the flesh. In fact, she attests that nuns are equally as susceptible to sins of the flesh as secular women. She argues that while it was widely accepted that nuns held religious authority, Catholic clergymen reserved true divine knowledge for members of their own sex.\n\nSuchon's work did receive some attention in France when she first released her writings. Both Suchon's \"Traité de la morale et de la politique\" (1693) and \"Du Célibat volontaire (1700)\" were reviewed in \"Le Journal des Savants\", one of the premier intellectual journals in France, the year they were published. \"Du Célibat volontaire\" was also featured in another notable French journal, \"Nouvelles de la République des Lettres\" after its release. Recognition by these premier French journals shows that some intellectuals saw the quality of Suchon's work and took her perspective seriously.\n\nSuchon remained relatively undiscovered until the second revival of the Feminist Movement in the 1980s. Historians argue that Suchon's work did not gain significant popularity because male intellectuals discredited 'feminized' writing throughout the early modern era. In the 1980s, Suchon's life and work was studied by feminist historians and moral philosophers for the first time. It was not until the late 20th century that Suchon was established as an influential moral philosopher and feminist writer in the academic community.\n\nSuchon's work serves as a valuable historical document. Up until the 17th century, European women were offered two life paths: find a husband or become a nun. Marriage was greatly stifling to a woman's freedom and sometimes the nunnery was the only venue that women could gain independence from the confines of gender discrimination. Suchon's writing sheds light upon the difficulty women faced in getting an education, the realities of marriage and life in convents in the early modern era. The significance of Suchon's perspective is only properly illustrated when against the backdrop of cultural norms of the early modern era.\n\nSuchon is considered to be the most prominent pro-woman writer during the reign of Louis XIV, a time where both intellectual endeavors and economic freedom for women were greatly stifled in France. Marie de Gournay, a prominent pro-woman writer, is Suchon's most similar contemporary.\n\nOn the occasion of the 300th anniversary of her death in 2003, a road was named after Gabrielle Suchon in her hometown of Semur-en-Auxios.\n\nA copy of \"Du célibat volontaire\" was found at the cloister of \"Billettes\" until the French Revolution, suggesting that Suchon's work was read in at least one convent\".\" Historians have found physical copies of Suchon's \"Traité de la morale et de la politique\" in Paris, Grenoble, Dijon, Besançon and Aix-en-Provence. \"Du Célibat volontaire\" has been discovered in Besançon, Paris, as well as in the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek (Bavarian State Library), Göttingen, Florence and Rome. The wider dispersal of Suchon's second work could be a result of French readers travelling abroad or printers bringing the text to trade shows.\n\nSuchon wrote in a time in which 'feminist' was neither term nor a genre of writing and study. Suchon is best described as a proto-feminist because her writings largely reflect the direction of the future feminist movement. In recent years, scholars have called Suchon a precursor to one the most notable feminists, Simone de Beauvoir.\n\nSuchon essentially proposes a new social and legal status for women. Her works serve as a call for women to break from gender expectations and to embrace a new freedom. In modern terms, Suchon could be considered one of the first female activists. Suchon is one of the first philosophers to specifically discuss the topic of human rights\".\"\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Under the leadership of George D. Widener, the current 16th Street Clubhouse was built by architect Horace Trumbauer. Historian Nathaniel Burt described the new 1907 Clubhouse as \"by far the best appointed...of all Philadelphia clubs.\" The clubhouse is one of the first reinforced concrete structures designed in Philadelphia, and also includes the world's first above grade swimming pool, designed by the noted bridge builders Roebling Construction Company. The building's red-brick, Georgian design, is evocative of historic Philadelphia, and the Clubhouse was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.\n\nThe club was the site of the invention of squash doubles by Frederich C. Tompkins. The new building had a space that was too large for a standard squash court but too small for further locker facilities and Tomkins recommended that it be used for squash doubles.\n\nThe Racquet Club's athletic facilities include 6 international squash singles courts, 1 squash doubles court, a real tennis court, a racquets court, and a fitness facility. The club also has overnight rooms for the use of members and sponsored guests, as well as a bar and serves lunch daily. The club is open to members 365 days a year. Located on 16th Street between Walnut and Locust, it is in the heart of Philadelphia's Rittenhouse Square area.\n\nThe club has hosted several international real tennis, racquets, and doubles squash tournaments and championships.\n\nThe U.S. Squash Hall of Fame was briefly at the club until moving to Yale University.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2016182", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2016182", "title": "Mjolnir (comics)", "text": "Mjolnir (comics)\n\nMjolnir, known more formally as Mjölnir () is a mythical weapon appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. It is depicted as the principal weapon of the superhero Thor and Jane Foster. Mjolnir, which first appears in \"Journey into Mystery\" #83 (August 1962), was created by writer Stan Lee and designed by artists Jack Kirby and Joe Sinnott.\n\nMjolnir was typically depicted as a large, square-headed gray sledgehammer. It has a short, round handle wrapped in brown leather, culminating in a looped lanyard. The object is based on Mjölnir, the weapon of the mythological Thor.\n\nMjolnir debuted in \"Journey into Mystery\" #83 (Aug. 1962) for Marvel Comics. Prior to this time, \"Mjolnar,\" invented by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby, appeared in \"Adventure Comics\" #75 (Jun. 1942), in the Sandman story, \"The Villain from Valhalla.\" For Marvel, the hammer was immediately established as the main weapon of the Thunder god Thor Odinson. The weapon's origin is revealed in \"Thor\" Annual #11 (1983), although another version is presented in \"Thor\" vol. 2, #80 (Aug. 2004). In the old comics, Mjolnir would turn into Don Blake's cane (Blake was at that time Thor's \"secret identity\"). The first use of name of the hammer was in the \"Tales of Asgard\" feature in \"Thor\" #135 (Dec 1966) in a story by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. In \"Thor\" #140 (May 1967) it was referred to as \"Mjolnar\" (spelt with an \"a\" not an \"i\"). \n\nIn a 2002 documentary with Kevin Smith, Lee says his brother Larry Lieber made up the name of Thor's hammer referring to the hammer's original name, the \"Uru Hammer\". Later, writer Roy Thomas changed the name of the hammer to the mythologically correct name of \"Mjolnir\" and used the name \"Uru\" created by Larry Lieber as the name of the fictional metal that the hammer is made from.\n\nOther significant moments in Marvel continuity include the altering of Mjolnir's enchantments in \"Thor\" #282 (April 1979) and \"Thor\" #340 (Feb. 1984); the temporary possession of Mjolnir by a member of the Enchanters Three in \"Thor\" vol. 3, #14–15 (Aug.–Sep. 1999); and when the hammer has been damaged, occurring in \"Journey Into Mystery\" #119 (Aug. 1965); \"Avengers\" #215 (Jan. 1982); \"Thor\" #388 (Feb. 1988);\"Thor\" vol. 2, #11 (May 1999); \"Thor\" vol. 2, #80 (Aug. 2004) and \"Thor\" vol. 3, #600 (Feb. 2009).\n\nIn Marvel continuity, Mjolnir is forged by Dwarven blacksmiths, and is composed of the fictional Asgardian metal \"uru\". The side of the hammer carries the inscription \"Whosoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor.\"\n\nThe hammer is created when Odin's adopted son Loki cuts off the hair of the goddess Sif as part of a cruel jest, and, when threatened with violence by Thor, promises to fetch replacement hair from the dwarf smiths. Loki commissions the hair from the Sons of Ivaldi and the obliging dwarves also make a magic ship and spear as gifts for the gods. Loki is convinced that no one can match their workmanship, and challenges a dwarf named Eitri to make finer treasures. Eitri creates a golden ring and golden boar spear with magical properties, and finally begins work on a hammer. Loki panics at the sight of the treasures, and, afraid he will lose the wager, transforms himself into a mayfly and stings Eitri's assistant on the brow as he is working the bellows for the forge. The assistant stops for a moment to wipe away the blood, and the bellows fall flat. As a result, the hammer's handle is shorter in length than Eitri had originally intended, meaning that the hammer could only be wielded one-handed.\nDespite the error, the Norse gods consider Eitri to have forged the greater treasures, and in retaliation, Loki loses the bet and the Sons of Ivaldi sew Loki's lips shut. The ruler of the Norse gods, Odin, uses the hammer—called Mjolnir (\"Grinder\") by Eitri—and eventually passes it to his son Odinson, who goes by the title \"Thor\", who must first prove he is worthy to wield the weapon.\n\nAnother version of the hammer's origin is presented in the second volume of the title \"Thor\", in which Odin orders the dwarven blacksmiths Eitri, Brok and Buri to forge Mjolnir using the core of a star (the movie uses this origin as well, and Odin says that Mjolnir was \"forged in the heart of a dying star\") and an enchanted forge. The forging of the hammer is apparently so intense it destroys the star and nearly the Earth itself.\n\nAn additional alternate take on Mjolnir's origin is presented in Jason Aaron's \"The Mighty Thor\" series. It is explained that the Mother Storm, a sentient storm the size of a galaxy, had once threatened all of Asgard. After a fierce battle, Odin managed to trap it within a nugget of uru that had earlier been given to him by dwarven blacksmiths. He ordered the dwarves to forge the nugget into a weapon that would be able to harness the Mother Storm's power but found it too difficult to control. The hammer was forgotten until eons later when his son was finally able to lift it and make it his personal weapon.\n\nMjolnir itself has several enchantments: no living being may lift the hammer unless they are worthy; it returns to the exact spot from which it is thrown and returns to its Thor when summoned; it may summon the elements of storm (lightning, wind, and rain) by stamping its handle twice on the ground; manipulate the weather on an almost global scale; open interdimensional portals, allowing its wielder to travel to other dimensions (such as from Earth to Asgard); and transform Thor Odinson into the guise of a mortal, the physician , by stamping the hammer's head on the ground once and willing the change. When Thor transforms into Blake, his hammer takes the appearance of a wooden walking stick. When disguised, the hammer's enchantments limiting those who may lift it are not in effect. The hammer itself has also shown to be unaffected by external enchantments. Thors have several times used their Mjolnirs to pin down opponents, since they cannot lift the hammer.\n\nA previous provision of this enchantment required that the hammer could not be \"gone from Thor's grasp,\" or out of physical contact with its Thor for more than \"sixty seconds full\" without the spontaneous reversion of its users to their mortal selves (in some stories this limitation did not apply in Asgard). Mjolnir is small enough to be tucked into a belt for times when its user prefers to have both of their hands free. There are times when Thor had both hands free but produced Mjolnir by reaching behind Thor's shoulder; the suggestion was that Mjolnir was placed in some kind of sheath or sling on his back, with the handle pointing up so it could be quickly grasped. This stipulation was removed in a storyline in which the enchantment is transferred to Stormbreaker, the hammer of Beta Ray Bill. After this, the Donald Blake persona disappeared for a time, and Thor assumed a civilian identity simply by changing into modern clothing, carrying Mjolnir concealed within a duffel bag. Odinson eventually adopts the mortal persona of Jake Olson as penance for accidentally causing the original Olson's death during a fight, and simply pounds a fist to effect a change; during this time, Mjolnir would disappear when Thor became Olson, and reappear in Thor's fist when returning to his true form.\n\nMjolnir was originally capable of creating chronal displacement and therefore allowing time travel. This enchantment was removed by the entity Immortus with the Thunder god's consent to help the planet Phantus which was trapped in Limbo (later revealed to be a deception by Immortus to eliminate the Avengers' access to time travel). However, Thor is still able to manipulate time with Mjolnir.\n\nWhen Ragnarok took place, Mjolnir was separated from Thor and fell through the dimensions, creating a tear in Hell that allowed Doctor Doom to escape (Doom having been imprisoned there after his last encounter with the Fantastic Four). Although Doom and the Fantastic Four attempt to claim the hammer, none of them are able to lift it, resulting in Donald Blake—who had been returned to life when the spell negating his existence wore off with Asgard's destruction—claiming it himself. With Blake and Thor once again co-existing, the hammer resumes its original 'disguise' of a walking-stick. The hammer is later damaged in a fight with Bor, Thor's grandfather. Doctor Strange is able to repair the hammer using the Odinforce possessed by Thor, but warns Thor that, should the hammer be damaged in such a manner again, the new link between them could result in Thor being killed. The hammer was also sliced in two by the Destroyer. Thor visits the forges in Pittsburgh to mend it.\n\nAfter Thor's death in the fight against the Serpent, Loki is able to take Blake's walking stick—the only remaining trace of Thor after he was 'replaced' by Tanarus—and turn it back into Mjolnir in front of the Silver Surfer, the Surfer's energy and Loki's belief in his brother allowing the hammer to return to Thor and restore his memory in time to face the God-Devourer that was about to consume his soul in the afterlife.\n\nDuring the \"Original Sin\" storyline as Thor and the Avengers investigate Uatu The Watcher's murder, Nick Fury whispers an undisclosed secret to Thor that causes him to lose the ability to pick up Mjolnir. The nature of Mjolnir's enchantment also changes so that even Odin cannot lift it. The hammer is subsequently picked up by an unknown female, later revealed to be Jane Foster, who inherits the power and title of Thor, with the inscription changing to read \"if she be worthy\".\n\nAfter the destruction and reconstruction of the multiverse, the Mjolnir of the Ultimate Thor lands in Asgard, but the entire area where it landed is subsequently taken into the possession of the Collector, who vows to kill his various prisoners unless Thor will tell him a means of bypassing the worthiness enchantment so that he can wield the hammer himself. Although he fights his way to claim the hammer, Odinson decides to leave it, instead working with Beta Ray Bill to channel the power of the hammer to return Asgard to its rightful place. When they have returned to Asgard, Odinson tells Bill that the secret Fury told him was 'Gorr was right', a reference to the God-Butcher who believed that gods were not needed as they only brought pain and suffering. The issue concludes with another individual, later to be revealed as Volstagg, going to claim the hammer of Ultimate Thor, identified by publicity as 'the War Thor', but Volstagg is eventually convinced to put the hammer down as his actions as the War Thor are driven by his rage to the point of endangering innocents.\n\nWhen Captain America is 'reprogrammed' into an agent of Hydra by a sentient cosmic cube, he sets up a complex chain of events that allow him to take control of America, banishing Jane Foster and claiming Mjolnir for himself, his ability to wield the hammer ensuring that Odinson follows him despite Rogers's actions, believing that his ability to wield the hammer shows that Rogers is right. In the final stand, after Odinson sides with the heroes over Hydra, Sam Wilson, Bucky, and Eric Lang are able to use a fragment of the Cosmic Cube to restore the original Steve Rogers to existence. This attack also reveals that Hydra had used their cosmic cube to change the nature of the worthiness enchantment to \"If he be \"strong\", shall possess the power of \"Hydra\"\", with the 'reset' triggered by the cube's restoration of the true Rogers also restoring the original enchantment so that the original Rogers can lift the hammer where his Hydra self cannot.\n\nIn a desperate battle with Mangog, Jane Foster sacrifices Mjolnir--and, due to her currently failing health, her own life--to defeat the powerful Mangog by binding Mjolnir and Mangog in Gleipnir, the chain used to bind Fenris the wolf, and hurl both into the sun, effectively destroying Mjolnir, herself & The Mangog. Thor is subsequently able to work with Odin to channel the power of the cosmic storm that had been trapped within Mjolnir to bring Jane back to life. After being restored to life, Jane returned to her life on Earth, retrieving the last small fragment of Mjolnir--a pebble barely the size of Thor's fingernail but still too heavy for him to comfortably lift--to encourage Thor to consider resuming his role as God of Thunder by asking him to consider what he would be capable of without a hammer after seeing what she was capable of with one.\n\nDuring the War of the Realms, Thor sacrificed an eye and the last fragment of Mjolnir to the World-Tree to gain the necessary knowledge to defeat Malekith's assault, allowing him to gather three more Thors to assist him in the struggle; King Thor of the future, the Viking Thor who had originally fought Gorr, and Jane Foster, wielding the damaged hammer of the War Thor. As Thor confronted Malekith, he channeled the power of the ancient Mother Storm to reforge Mjolnir, overcoming his unworthiness by accepting Fury's proclamation that Gorr was right and vowing to prove himself better than the gods who had come before.\n\n\n\nThe hammer has been lifted by Earth itself when animated by magical means.\n\n- In another realities:\n\nSeveral imitations of Mjolnir have also existed. These include Stormbreaker and the mace Thunderstrike, created for Beta Ray Bill and Eric Masterson respectively. Loki has been responsible for the creation of several imitations – a version of Mjolnir, called Stormcaster, is presented to the mutant X-Men member Storm in an attempt to control her, which she later destroyed using Mjolnir. To spite Thor, another version is given to the mercenary Deadpool. Loki also allows Surtur to use the forge Mjolnir was created from to craft copies during Ragnarok. HYDRA created evil versions of Iron Man, Captain America, Hawkeye and Thor, the Thor imitator having a technological imitation of Mjolnir.\nTony Stark and Reed Richards also create a technological imitation Mjolnir for use by Ragnarok, the clone of Thor, during the Civil War storyline. A tiny version was created from a sliver of Mjolnir for the use of Throg, leader of the Pet Avengers.\n\nAfter the destruction of Mjolnir and the wars in the higher realms that devastated Asgard, until Mjolnir was reforged by a cosmic storm in the War of the Realms, Thor used a series of weaker substitute hammers in the absence of the true Mjolnir, with these temporary hammers possessing sufficient power for him to discharge lightning and fly, although they broke when used against a foe like the Juggernaut.\n\nMjolnir can be used both offensively and defensively.\n\nAs one of the most formidable weapons known to man or god, it is described as impacting with sufficient force to \"level mountains,\" with only primarily adamantium and vibranium proving impervious. Other offensive capabilities include creating vortices and forcefields (capable of containing an explosion that could potentially destroy a galaxy); emitting mystical blasts of energy; controlling electromagnetism; molecular manipulation; and generating the \"Geo-Blast\" (an energy wave that taps a planet's gravitational force), \"Anti-Force\" (energy created to counter-act another force), the thermo-blast which can even challenge such beings as Ego the living planet, and God Blast (a blast that taps into Thor's life force). It can even create antimatter particles and whirling it round can create winds powerful enough to lift the Taj Mahal. The hammer can also move extremely heavy objects, including the Washington Monument.\n\nThere are also other several rarely used abilities. Mjolnir can track a person and mystical items; absorb energy, such as draining the Asgardian powers of the Wrecking Crew into the Wrecker; or detect illusions, as Thor once commanded the hammer to strike the demonic Mephisto, who was hiding amongst false images of himself. As a former religious relic, Mjolnir is lethal to the undead, causing creatures such as vampires to burst into flame and crumble to dust. Mjolnir also can project images, as Thor shows a glimpse of Asgard to fellow Avenger Iron Man. It is near-indestructible, surviving bullets, Anti-matter, and the Melter's melting beam.\n\nThe hammer has additional properties relating to movement. When he calls for it verbally or mentally, it will return to his hand despite any intervening obstacles or distance, even traveling through planets to return to Thor. When it is deliberately thrown by Thor, he is able to control its trajectory. If it is dropped or set aside, it takes a fixed position, from which it cannot be moved except by a 'worthy' individual.\n\nThe hammer has also drained energy from the radioactive supervillain called the Presence, who is forced to surrender before being killed. Mjolnir was able to absorb, contain, and direct the energy of a Null Bomb, which was powerful enough to destroy an entire galaxy. Mjolnir also causes a side effect when used against the hero Union Jack: when Thor erroneously attacks the hero with a blast of lightning and then cancels the offensive, Union Jack is accidentally endowed with the ability to generate electricity. The hammer has been used to both power an Atlantean warship and temporarily drain the forcefield of the villain Juggernaut. If someone swears on the hammer their spirit can be summoned up after death. As well as absorbing radiation, the hammer can repel it back.\n\nThe hammer's ability to transform its user also purges the user of any toxins or radiations in their systems; however, this works against its current wielder, Jane Foster, as she is currently suffering from cancer, with the result that her transformations purge her of the radiation used in her chemotherapy while leaving the cancerous cells alone.\n\nMjolnir is also not wholly indestructible, having been damaged several times: a force beam from the Asgardian Destroyer slices it in two; the Molecule Man dispels the atomic bonds between the hammer's molecules, vaporizing Mjolnir; the hammer shatters after channeling an immeasurable amount of energy at the Celestial \"Exitar\"; Dark god Perrikus slices Mjolnir in half with a magical scythe; and the hammer is shattered when it collides with the uru weapons of Loki's Storm Giant followers, resulting in an atomic-scale explosion.\n\nDuring the \"Celestial Saga\" storyline, an earlier version of Mjolnir is revealed to exist and was apparently thrown to Midgard (Earth) by Thor's sons, Modi and Magni, landing in the Rhine river where it transformed into the magical Rhinegold.\n\nA version of Mjolnir in the \"What If?\" series was wielded by Rogue after she accidentally absorbed Thor's powers, the remnants of Thor in her psyche helping her assume his role.\n\nIn a future visited by the Hulk where Earth had been decimated by nuclear wars, Thor's hammer was one of the many mementos of the age of heroes kept by the now-elderly Rick Jones; the Maestro—the Hulk's twisted future self—attempted to use the hammer against the Hulk during their second confrontation in Rick's museum of hero memorabilia, but failed to lift it even with Thor's death as he was naturally unworthy to do so. A later storyline set before the Hulk's fight with the Maestro featured the elder Rick working with his younger self to defeat Thanatos – another alternate Rick – by using his own ability to summon and lift the hammer, explaining that he had been judged worthy to use it for things that young Rick had yet to do and Thanatos would never achieve. In a similar but alternate dystopian future, Mjolnir also rests in a super-hero artifact vault overseen by Rick Jones.\n\nMjolnir can be seen as one of the many treasures in the one-shot 'The Last Heist' that takes place in the \"Tellos\" universe.\n\nIn the Ultimate Marvel imprint title \"The Ultimates\" and its sequel \"The Ultimates 2\", the Ultimate version of Thor wields a Mjolnir styled after a classical war hammer. Loki claims that Thor is not really a god, and that Mjolnir is not magical in origin, instead an advanced technological marvel designed by the European Union Super Soldier Program to mimic Thor's powers, but this proves to be false. At the end of \"The Ultimates 2\" Thor proves his divinity and reclaims his Asgardian powers to defeat Loki. In \"The Ultimates 3: Who Killed The Scarlet Witch\", Thor wields a hammer more closely resembling the mainstream Marvel Universe Mjolnir. In one scene where he is entering a secured building, the computer controlling access identifies first Thor, then Mjolnir; this leads another character to question why the computer identified Mjolnir as a separate, sentient organism, but Thor does not give an explanation for this. He later displays a wall of weapons, including both hammers, which he states were gifts from his father forged by Ulik the Troll. However, in the prequel miniseries \"\" it is revealed that the original hammer is not the \"real\" Mjolnir but instead Dr. Braddock gives Thor tech-armor, and Thor suggests to turn the power supply into a hammer. Neither version of the hammer seems to be such that its use is restricted by the worthiness test. In \"\" Thor puts his hammer inside the Room With No Doors with his son Modi, so that he may escape the destruction and genocide of the Asgardians. With Thor being the last Asgardian alive and his hammer is gone, he loses his divine powers and becomes mortal. Tony Stark kept Thor's tech armor and hammer since Thor no longer felt he had use for it, and gives it to Thor to \"restore\" his powers because he feels the world \"needs a god of thunder\".\n\nMjolnir plays a prominent role in Thor's story arc throughout the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It appears in the following ways: \n\n"}
{"id": "2016186", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2016186", "title": "Factor graph", "text": "Factor graph\n\nA factor graph is a bipartite graph representing the factorization of a function. In probability theory and its applications, factor graphs are used to represent factorization of a probability distribution function, enabling efficient computations, such as the computation of marginal distributions through the sum-product algorithm. One of the important success stories of factor graphs and the sum-product algorithm is the decoding of capacity-approaching error-correcting codes, such as LDPC and turbo codes.\n\nFactor graphs generalize constraint graphs. A factor whose value is either 0 or 1 is called a constraint. A constraint graph is a factor graph where all factors are constraints. The max-product algorithm for factor graphs can be viewed as a generalization of the arc-consistency algorithm for constraint processing.\n\nA factor graph is a bipartite graph representing the factorization of a function. Given a factorization of a function formula_1,\n\nwhere formula_3, the corresponding factor graph formula_4 consists of variable vertices\nformula_5, factor vertices formula_6, and edges formula_7. The edges depend on the factorization as follows: there is an undirected edge between factor vertex formula_8 and variable vertex formula_9 iff formula_10. The function is tacitly assumed to be real-valued: formula_11.\n\nFactor graphs can be combined with message passing algorithms to efficiently compute certain characteristics of the function formula_1, such as the marginal distributions.\n\nConsider a function that factorizes as follows:\n\nwith a corresponding factor graph shown on the right. Observe that the factor graph has a cycle. If we merge formula_14 into a single factor, the resulting factor graph will be a tree. This is an important distinction, as message passing algorithms are usually exact for trees, but only approximate for graphs with cycles.\n\nA popular message passing algorithm on factor graphs is the sum-product algorithm, which efficiently computes all the marginals of the individual variables of the function. In particular, the marginal of variable formula_9 is defined as\nwhere the notation formula_17 means that the summation goes over all the variables, \"except\" formula_9. The messages of the sum-product algorithm are conceptually computed in the vertices and passed along the edges. A message from or to a variable vertex is always a function of that particular variable. For instance, when a variable is binary, the messages\nover the edges incident to the corresponding vertex can be represented as vectors of length 2: the first entry is the message evaluated in 0, the second entry is the message evaluated in 1. When a variable belongs to the field of real numbers, messages can be arbitrary functions, and special care needs to be taken in their representation.\n\nIn practice, the sum-product algorithm is used for statistical inference, whereby formula_19 is a joint distribution or a joint likelihood function, and the factorization depends on the conditional independencies among the variables.\n\nThe Hammersley–Clifford theorem shows that other probabilistic models such as Bayesian networks and Markov networks can be represented as factor graphs; the latter representation is frequently used when performing inference over such networks using belief propagation. On the other hand, Bayesian networks are more naturally suited for generative models, as they can directly represent the causalities of the model.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2016187", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2016187", "title": "Shield (Archie Comics)", "text": "Shield (Archie Comics)\n\nThe Shield is the name of several fictional patriotic superheroes created by MLJ (now known as Archie Comics). Appearing months before Captain America, the Shield has the distinction of being one of the first superheroes with a costume based upon United States patriotic iconography. The character appeared in \"Pep Comics\" from issue #1 (Jan 1940) to #65 (Jan 1948).\n\nThe name was used by MLJ/Archie for four characters. DC Comics' Impact line, which licensed the Archie properties, also used the name for several characters. In 2010, DC announced plans to integrate the Shield and other MLJ characters into the DC Universe, but in 2011 the rights to the characters reverted to Archie Comics. A fourth Shield was introduced in October 2015.\n\nThe Shield debuted in MLJ's \"Pep Comics\" #1 (cover-dated Jan. 1940). Writer Harry Shorten and artist Irv Novick created the character. With the American populace reacting to the beginnings of World War II and wartime patriotism stirring, the Shield debuted as the first patriotically themed hero. He was soon followed by three other patriotic comic characters: Captain America (March 1941), Minute-Man (Feb. 1941), and Captain Battle (May 1941).\n\nIn 1959, a new Shield, Lancelot Strong, appeared under the Archie Adventure Series imprint in a series titled, \"The Double Life of Private Strong\". It was cancelled after two issues.\n\nRed Circle Comics reintroduced Lancelot Strong in a new series titled, \"Lancelot Strong: The Shield\" in June 1983. The series was retitled twice, first with \"Shield-Steel Sterling\" in December 1983 and then with \"Steel Sterling\" in January 1984. In July 1984, the series ended with its seventh issue.\n\nIn 1984, Red Circle Comics also released a series starring the Joe Higgins version of the Shield in a series titled \"Original Shield\". It lasted four issues.\n\nIn 1991, Archie Comics licensed their superheroes to DC Comics who created an imprint called Impact Comics. The company launched a fourth solo series, \"The Legend of the Shield\". It featured two Shields, Joe Higgins, who led the series for the first thirteen issues, and Lt. Michael Barnes, his replacement. Barnes continued as the Shield until the title ended in October 1992.\n\nIn 2015, Archie Comics announced the Shield's return in a new series penned by Adam Christopher and Chuck Wendig. This version of the character is a woman named Victoria Adams. The series will be published under the Dark Circle Comics banner. It was originally set to be released in April 2015 but was delayed until September 2015.\n\nThe origin story of The Shield appeared in \"Shield–Wizard Comics\" #1 (Summer 1940). He is really chemist Joe Higgins, the son of Lieutenant Tom Higgins. Tom was working on a chemical formula for super-strength which the Germans were after, and is slain by German saboteur Hans Fritz in the Black Tom explosion, for which Tom was blamed. After Tom's death, Joe continues to work on it while continuing his studies of chemistry. Joe finally figures out the solution, which requires applying the chemicals to certain parts of his anatomy (Sacrum, Heart, Innervation, Eyes, Lungs, Derma), and exposing himself to x-rays. This gives him super strength, the ability able to make great leaps, and invulnerability. Joe uses the initials S.H.I.E.L.D. as his secret identity. His white costume becomes the familiar colors under the process. He becomes an FBI agent (whose secret identity is known only to FBI Chief J. Edgar Hoover) after clearing his father's name, and fights foreign agents and other threats to the U.S. At the start of the strip, Higgins' partners are fellow G-Man Ju Ju Watson, and girlfriend Betty Warren.\n\nThe Shield is joined by a kid partner, Dusty the Boy Detective, in \"Pep\" #11 (Jan 1941). Dusty's father had been killed by foreign agents, and he is adopted by Joe and given a costume. Both heroes wear their patriotic costumes beneath their street clothes and change for action whenever the need would arise. Dusty also partners with The Wizard's kid partner, Roy, as the \"Boy Buddies\".\n\nIn \"Pep\" #20, Joe is called \"The One and Only Shield\" at the start of the story and \"The Original Shield\" at the end of the story because of the success of Captain America, another 1940s-era patriotic superhero. In his first appearance, Captain America had a shield similar to the main part of The Shield's costume, but it was changed to a round shield for the second issue over accusations of plagiarism.\n\nThe Shield and Dusty were featured in the first crossover storyline in American comic books. The storyline had them team up with the Wizard (the headlining character from \"Top-Notch\" Comics) to stop the invasion plot orchestrated by Moskovia (a fictional country made up of elements from Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union).\n\nThe Shield was one of MLJ's most popular characters, even spawning a club, the \"Shield G-Man Club\". He starred in \"Pep\", and several other MLJ titles: \"Shield-Wizard\", \"Top-Notch Comics\". But then a new character arrived who would overshadow him: Archie Andrews. He would take the Shield's cover spot on \"Pep\", take his fan club, and cause the end of the MLJ superheroes.\n\nAn older Joe Higgins appears in \"New Crusaders\" as the sole survivor of the Brain Emperor's attack on his fellow Crusaders. He gathers their teenage children to form a team dubbed \"the New Crusaders\".\n\nThe Red Circle Comics characters, aptly named \"The Red Circle,\" were again licensed by DC and rebooted. During the \"Discord\" crisis a version of the Shield character was seen helping Green Arrow and Black Canary, performing crowd control. First appearing as a secondary character in The Web, another former MLJ hero, the new Shield is \"Lieutenant Joseph Higgins\", stationed in Afghanistan, from where he tries to contact The Web to find his missing father. On the same day however his crew fall victim to Taliban terrorists, and Higgins is grievously wounded. To save his life, he agrees to be subjected to secret government experiments, after which an advanced, nanotech battle suit is merged to his burned epidermis. The suit appears on his body at will and grants him the same array of powers of the earlier incarnation, including superhuman strength, limited flight and advanced sensory abilities. Due to his severe injuries, the only major drawback is that if ever he tries to remove the war suit permanently, his bodily functions could shut down. Still fighting as the new, patriotic hero, he is again contacted by The Web, accepting his request for help\n\nThe Shield also appeared in the 2010 DC Comics mini series \"The Mighty Crusaders\".\n\nIn June 1959, a new Shield was published by Archie that had no connection to the previous version.\n\nJoe Simon was asked by Archie to create characters for a new \"Archie Adventure Series\" line of superheroes. Joe Simon created a new Shield-type of superhero, whose real identity was Lancelot Strong, who appeared in a new title, \"The Double Life of Private Strong\". Joe Simon put together a team of artists including Jack Kirby to work for him on \"The Double Life of Private Strong\".\n\nLancelot's scientist father developed a method to create a superhuman by expanding the mind, which he used on his infant son. After his father was killed by foreign agents, Lancelot was adopted by a farm couple and raised as their son. Once he hit his teens, he discovered the truth of his background and his powers: strength, flight, near-invulnerability, vision powers, the ability to generate lightning, and a few more. His father had created a patriotic costume for him, and he started off as the new superhero, the Shield. He soon joined the Army, acting like a Gomer Pyle-style country bumpkin, while leading a double life as the Shield (hence the title of his comic).\n\nIn 1999, Archie formally assigned all rights to Lancelot Strong to Joe Simon.\n\nWhen Archie revamped their superheroes under their \"Radio Comics/Mighty Comics\" line, a third Shield was introduced as Bill Higgins and Joe Higggins Jr., sons of the original Shield. Bill first appeared in the new \"Fly-Man\" #31, and becomes one of the main founders of the Mighty Crusaders. It would be revealed that his father was turned to stone by the villain, The Eraser, and Bill was carrying on his father's work. Bill's 'powers', which seem to be enhanced strength and limited invulnerability, were derived from his costume. He would appear through the end of the Radio/Mighty Comics run. Originally they would switch the name from Bill Higgins to Joe Higgins Jr., from one appearance to the next. In the Red Circle Mighty Crusaders #1 the story established that Bill joined the Army and left his life as a superhero. In 2000 Archie Comics started using Joe Higgins Jr. as the Shield in Archie's Weird Mysteries, establishing that Bill and Joe Jr. were separate characters.\n\nWhen \"Legend of the Shield\" was revamped, Lt. Michael Barnes, a married father with a young daughter, became the new Shield. Barnes would continue as the lead character until the series' 1992 cancellation and also appeared as the Shield in the six-issue miniseries \"The Crucible\".\n\nIn 2015, Archie Comics rebranded their Red Circle Comics line under the new Dark Circle Comics banner. The new Shield debuted in her own new series titled \"The Shield\" in October 2015. Victoria Adams is the first female to take up the mantle of the Shield. The series ran four issues. She has continued in her role as the Shield in \"The Mighty Crusaders\" written by Ian Flynn.\n\n"}

Tandem Enterprises, Inc.) was a film and television production company that was founded in 1958 by television director Bud Yorkin and television writer/producer Norman Lear.\n\nIn the early years, Yorkin and Lear initially established Tandem specifically for television production. The name was chosen because when launching their company, Yorkin and Lear were said to feel like two men riding uphill on a tandem bicycle. The company produced several variety and dramatic television specials such as the Fred Astaire specials, \"Henry Fonda and the Family\", \"An Evening with Carol Channing\" and \"The Scene '66\", to name a few. Tandem was also at hand for various unsold pilots throughout the 1950s and 1960s, including \"Henry T.\", \"Meet Me at Danny's\" and \"Barnaby\" (not to be confused with \"Barnaby Jones\"). \nThe company also financed the production of theatrical films, some of which were released by Warner Bros. Pictures, Paramount Pictures, Columbia Pictures, and United Artists.\n\nLear and Yorkin later turned their focus on situation comedy. The first success in that genre was \"All in the Family\", which was based on the British sitcom \"Till Death Us Do Part\". Before the series made its debut on January 12, 1971, Yorkin and Lear shot two unsold pilots for the series: one in 1968 called \"Justice For All\" and the other in 1969 titled \"Those Were the Days\". Production for the series began in late 1970, following the third pilot episode which was picked up by CBS. More successful shows were also produced by Tandem; they were \"Maude\" (1972–1978), \"Good Times\" (1974–1979), and finally \"Sanford and Son\" (1972–1977). In 1977, Viacom Enterprises secured domestic and international television syndication rights for \"All in the Family\" which hit off-network reruns in Fall 1979. Columbia Pictures Television took over distribution for the series by 1991.\n\nIn 1978, Tandem produced \"Diff'rent Strokes\", which was the only show not to be produced by Yorkin nor Lear. \"Archie Bunker's Place\" was produced in 1979, \"Sanford\" in 1980 and \"Gloria\", the final series to be produced by Tandem in 1982. Not many more shows were produced under the Tandem name, but many other shows were being produced under T.A.T. Communications Company during the early 1980s. Also in 1978, Tandem Productions launched P*I*T*S Films (an acronym which stands for \"Pie In The Sky\") as its television distribution arm for its parent company's programs (\"All in the Family\" was excluded, which at the time was distributed by Viacom). P*I*T*S Films was reincorporated as Embassy Telecommunications in 1982.\n\nAfter Yorkin ended his partnership with Lear in 1975, he collaborated with writers and producers Saul Turteltaub and Bernie Orenstein (who wrote some episodes and produced \"Sanford and Son\" from 1974 to 1977) and established Bud Yorkin Productions, Inc. He still remained as the executive producer of the series.\n\nThe first sitcom was \"Grady\", a \"Sanford and Son\" spin-off starring Whitman Mayo. The series was canceled after twelve episodes due to low ratings.\n\nIn 1976, Yorkin, Turteltaub, and Orenstein established TOY Productions, and the first sitcom for the new company was ABC's \"What's Happening!!\". The series was suggested by the American International Picture \"Cooley High\", written by Eric Monte.\n\nOn February 19, 1979, TOY was acquired by Columbia Pictures Television and launched a new series, \"13 Queens Boulevard\". A year later, they co-produced the short-lived sitcom \"One in a Million\", starring Shirley Hemphill.\n\nTwo years later, TOY produced another sitcom, \"One of the Boys\". It received negative reception, and after it was cancelled on April 24, 1982, TOY was folded.\n\nAfter Norman Lear bought Avco Embassy Pictures, he dropped the name \"Avco\" and reincorporated T.A.T. Communications to Embassy Television. All series that were still produced by T.A.T. (such as \"The Facts of Life\", \"The Jeffersons\", and \"One Day at a Time\") were produced under the Embassy name. All shows by Tandem Productions that were off the air were distributed by Embassy Telecommunications.\n\nIn 1983, Ken Stump, the former associate producer for Tandem Productions and T.A.T. Communications was made in charge of production for Tandem Productions and Embassy Television. The same year in June, Lear and Perenchio bought out Yorkin's interest in Tandem.\n\nOn June 18, 1985, Norman Lear and Jerry Perenchio sold Embassy Communications, Inc. to The Coca-Cola Company for $485 million, but then Coke sold Embassy Pictures to Dino De Laurentiis since De Laurentiis didn't want to release his movies through a major studio anymore. Coke's plan was to keep the television division and to spin-off the other labels that weren't part of the deal.\n\nDe Laurentiis later folded Embassy Pictures with the formation of De Laurentiis Entertainment Group. The majority of the motion picture holdings are currently licensed to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and StudioCanal. However, Columbia Pictures still retains \"Crimewave\" and \"Saving Grace\" (both co-distributed by Embassy Pictures). SPE also has the television rights to the Avco Embassy Film \"The Fog\" (1980) since a 2005 remake.\n\nAfter the sale of Embassy, CPT also produced and distributed the sitcom \"What's Happening Now!!\" which was co-produced by LBS Communications. The same year, \"Diff'rent Strokes\" moved to ABC from NBC after NBC cancelled the series. Tandem Productions remained active, but Coke and Embassy Communications launched Tandem Licensing Corporation as Tandem's licensing division.\n\nIn 1986, \"Diff'rent Strokes\" was canceled due to low ratings and Tandem Productions was abandoned. Embassy Television, Embassy Telecommunications and Tandem Productions were merged with Embassy Communications and Embassy Communications became a full television studio than a holding company (later becoming part of Columbia/Embassy Television in November 1986). However, Tandem still remained as an in-name-only division of Embassy Communications until February 8, 1988 when it became in-name-only to Columbia Pictures Television and in turn an in-name-only sub-division of ELP Communications. The same year, Coca-Cola spun off and sold Embassy Home Entertainment to Nelson Holdings, Inc. and became Nelson Entertainment.\n\nCPT still retained the television rights to those Embassy movies by Joseph E. Levine, Avco Embassy Pictures, and Lear/Perenchio's Embassy Pictures.\n\n\n\n\nTandem, TOY, and ELP Communications used the same actors and actresses to appear on different television programs.\n\n"}

This was dropped during development, and the show became more conventional and episodic. The first aired episode reflected the original plan, and covering the first half-hour of a date.\n\nThe main character is Jake (John Stamos), a New York City publicist-to-the-stars who tries to change his womanizing ways as he tries to find the woman of his dreams. Stamos' co-stars in the show are Naomi (Wendie Malick), Jake's boss at the Magnum PR Agency; Adrian (Ian Gomez), Jake's best friend; and Patrick (Rick Hoffman), the performance artist who always appears at the most inopportune times.\n\n\nThe show averaged 5.5 million viewers in its first season and was initially canceled. However, the network reversed course and announced the show would return as the lead-out from a highly anticipated series, \"Emily's Reasons Why Not\". The Jake character was softened somewhat in the second series in an effort to make him more relatable. The first night of the sitcom pairing fared poorly in the ratings; after one week, ABC immediately scheduled a rerun of \"The Bachelor\" during the one-hour block for the following week, putting both shows on indefinite hiatus. ABC confirmed on May 13 that \"Jake\" had been canceled.\n\n"}

John S. Rieske and co-workers first discovered and isolated the proteins in 1964. It is a unique [2Fe-2S] cluster in that one of the two Fe atoms is coordinated by two histidine residues rather than two cysteine residues. They have since been found in plants, animals, and bacteria with widely ranging electron reduction potentials from -150 to +400 mV.\n\nUbiquinol-cytochrome-c reductase (also known as bc1 complex or complex III) is an enzyme complex of bacterial and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation systems. It catalyses the oxidation-reduction reaction of the mobile components ubiquinol and cytochrome c, contributing to an electrochemical potential difference across the mitochondrial inner or bacterial membrane, which is linked to ATP synthesis.\n\nThe complex consists of three subunits in most bacteria, and nine in mitochondria: both bacterial and mitochondrial complexes contain cytochrome b and cytochrome c1 subunits, and an iron–sulfur 'Rieske' subunit, which contains a high potential 2Fe-2S cluster. The mitochondrial form also includes six other subunits that do not possess redox centres. Plastoquinone-plastocyanin reductase (b6f complex), present in cyanobacteria and the chloroplasts of plants, catalyses the oxidoreduction of plastoquinol and cytochrome f. This complex, which is functionally similar to ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase, comprises cytochrome b6, cytochrome f and Rieske subunits.\n\nThe Rieske subunit acts by binding either a ubiquinol or plastoquinol anion, transferring an electron to the 2Fe-2S cluster, then releasing the electron to the cytochrome c or cytochrome f heme iron. The reduction of the Rieske center increases the affinity of the subunit by several orders of magnitude, stabilizing the semiquinone radical at the Q(P) site. The Rieske domain has a [2Fe-2S] center. Two conserved cysteines coordinate one Fe ion while the other Fe ion is coordinated by two conserved histidines. The 2Fe-2S cluster is bound in the highly conserved C-terminal region of the Rieske subunit.\n\nThe homologues of the Rieske proteins include ISP components of cytochrome \"b\"\"f\" complex, aromatic-ring-hydroxylating dioxygenases (phthalate dioxygenase, benzene, naphthalene and toluene 1,2-dioxygenases) and arsenite oxidase (EC 1.20.98.1). Comparison of amino acid sequences has revealed the following consensus sequence:\n\nThe crystal structures of a number of Rieske proteins are known. The overall fold, comprising two subdomains, is dominated by antiparallel β-structure and contains variable numbers of α-helices. The smaller \"cluster-binding\" subdomains in mitochondrial and chloroplast proteins are virtually identical, whereas the large subdomains are substantially different in spite of a common folding topology. The [FeS] cluster-binding subdomains have the topology of an incomplete antiparallel β-barrel. One iron atom of the Rieske [FeS] cluster in the domain is coordinated by two cysteine residues and the other is coordinated by two histidine residues through the N atoms. The ligands coordinating the cluster originate from two loops; each loop contributes one Cys and one His.\n\n\nAIFM3; RFESD; UQCRFS1;\n\n"}

The term may also refer to any disease or sign that strongly motivates withdrawal of an individual or entity from the trial, then often termed a \"humane (clinical) endpoint\".\n\nThe primary endpoint of a clinical trial is the endpoint for which subjects are randomized and for which the trial is powered. Secondary endpoints are endpoints that are analyzed \"post hoc\", for which the trial may not be powered nor randomized.\n\nSurrogate endpoints are trial endpoints that have outcomes that substitute for a clinical endpoint, often because studying the clinical endpoint is difficult, for example using an increase in blood pressure as a surrogate for death by cardiovascular disease, where strong evidence of a causal link exists.\n\nIn a general sense, a clinical endpoint is included in the entities of interest in a trial. The results of a clinical trial generally indicate the number of people enrolled who reached the pre-determined clinical endpoint during the study interval compared with the overall number of people who were enrolled. Once a patient reaches the endpoint, he or she is generally excluded from further experimental intervention (the origin of the term \"endpoint\").\n\nFor example, a clinical trial investigating the ability of a medication to prevent heart attack might use \"chest pain\" as a clinical endpoint. Any patient enrolled in the trial who develops chest pain over the course of the trial, then, would be counted as having reached that clinical endpoint. The results would ultimately reflect the fraction of patients who reached the endpoint of having developed chest pain, compared with the overall number of people enrolled.\n\nWhen an experiment involves a control group, the proportion of individuals who reach the clinical endpoint after an intervention is compared with the proportion of individuals in the control group who reached the same clinical endpoint, reflecting the ability of the intervention to prevent the endpoint in question.\n\nA clinical trial will usually define or specify a \"primary endpoint\" as a measure that will be considered success of the therapy being trialled (e.g. in justifying a marketing approval). The primary endpoint might be a statistically significant improvement in \"overall survival\" (OS). A trial might also define one or more \"secondary endpoints\" such as \"progression-free-survival\" (PFS) that will be measured and are expected to be met. A trial might also define \"exploratory endpoints\" that are less likely to be met.\n\nClinical endpoints can be obtained from different modalities, such as, behavioural or cognitive scores, or biomarkers from Electroencephalography (qEEG), MRI, PET, or biochemical biomarkers.\n\nIn clinical cancer research, common endpoints include discovery of local recurrence, discovery of regional metastasis, discovery of distant metastasis, onset of symptoms, hospitalization, increase or decrease in pain medication requirement, onset of toxicity, requirement of salvage chemotherapy, requirement of salvage surgery, requirement of salvage radiotherapy, death from any cause or death from disease. A cancer study may be powered for overall survival, usually indicating time until death from any cause, or disease specific survival, where the endpoint is death from disease or death from toxicity.\n\nThese are expressed as a period of time (survival duration) e.g., in months. Frequently the median is used so that the trial endpoint can be calculated once 50% of subjects have reached the endpoint, whereas calculation of an arithmetical mean can only be done after all subjects have reached the endpoint.\n\nThe disease free survival is usually used to analyze the results of the treatment for the localized disease which renders the patient apparently disease free, such as surgery or surgery plus adjuvant therapy. In the disease-free survival, the event is relapse rather than death. The people who relapse are still surviving but they are no longer disease-free. Just as in the survival curves not all patients die, in \"disease-free survival curves\" not all patients relapse and the curve may have a final plateau representing the patients who didn't relapse after the study's maximum follow-up. Because the patients survive for at least some time after the relapse, the curve for the actual survival would look better than disease free survival curve.\n\nThe Progression Free Survival is usually used in analysing the results of the treatment for the advanced disease. The event for the progression free survival is that the disease gets worse or progresses, or the patient dies from any cause. \"Time to Progression\" is a similar endpoint that ignores patients who die before the disease progresses.\n\nThe response duration is occasionally used to analyze the results of the treatment for the advanced disease. The event is progression of the disease (relapse). This endpoint involves selecting a subgroup of the patients. It measures the length of the response in those patients who responded. The patients who don't respond aren't included.\n\nOverall survival is based on death from any cause, not just the condition being treated, thus it picks up death from side effects of the treatment, and effects on survival after relapse.\n\nA humane endpoint can be defined as the point at which pain and/or distress is terminated, minimized or reduced for an entity in a trial (such as an experimental animal), by taking action such as killing the animal humanely, terminating a painful procedure, or giving treatment to relieve pain and/or distress. The occurrence of an individual in a trial having reached may necessitate withdrawal from the trial before the target outcome of interest has been fully reached.\n\nA surrogate endpoint (or \"marker\") is a measure of effect of a specific treatment that may correlate with a \"real\" clinical endpoint but doesn't necessarily have a guaranteed relationship. The National Institutes of Health (USA) define surrogate endpoint as \"a biomarker intended to substitute for a clinical endpoint\".\n\nSome studies will examine the incidence of a \"combined endpoint\", which can merge a variety of outcomes into one group. For example, the heart attack study above may report the incidence of the \"combined endpoint\" of chest pain, myocardial infarction, or death. An example of a cancer study powered for a combined endpoint is disease-free survival (DFS); trial participants experiencing either death or discovery of any recurrence would constitute the endpoint. Overall Treatment Utility is an example of a multidimensional composite endpoint in cancer clinical trials.\n\nRegarding humane endpoints, a combined endpoint may constitute a threshold where there is enough cumulative degree of disease, symptoms, signs or laboratory abnormalities to motivate an intervention.\n\nEach trial may define what is considered a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) to the therapy or intervention. Hence the trials report the 'complete response rate' and the overall response rate which includes CR and PR. (e.g. see Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, and Small-cell carcinoma treatment, and for immunotherapies, Immune-Related Response Criteria).\n\nVarious studies on a particular topic often do not address the same outcomes, making it difficult to draw clinically useful conclusions when a group of studies is looked at as a whole. The Core Outcomes in Women's Health (CROWN) Initiative is one effort to standardize outcomes.\n\n\n"}

After the November 2011 banning of the participation of blocs of political parties in parliamentary elections, Batkivshchyna became a major force in Ukrainian politics independently. \n\nIn the 2012 Ukrainian parliamentary election Batkivshchyna took part under the banner \"United opposition Batkivshchyna\" and other parties allied with Batkivshchyna. The party list was headed by the leader of the \"Front of Changes\" Arseniy Yatsenyuk. The list won 62 seats and 25.55 percent of the vote under the (nationwide) proportional party-list system (down from 30.71 percent in 2007 for the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc), and another 39 in constituencies, thus a total of 101 seats. On 15 June 2013 the parties \"Front of Changes\" and \"Reforms and Order\" finally merged with the All-Ukrainian Union Batkivshchyna by self-liquidation. By 31 December 2013 the parliamentary faction Batkivshchyna had 90 deputies.\n\nYulia Tymoshenko was imprisoned from 5 August 2011 until 22 February 2014. After the 2014 revolution she was rehabilitated by the Supreme Court of Ukraine and the European Court of Human Rights in the absence of crime structure. \n\nTymoshenko started reforming the party and Batkivshchyna went into the parliamentary elections of 2014 with new members, the top five of the list included: Nadiya Savchenko, Yulia Tymoshenko, Ihor Lutsenko, Serhiy Sobolev, and Alyona Shkrum. Based on the election results, the party received 19 seats in the Ukrainian parliament: 17 according to party lists and two through the majority system. Until 17 February 2016 the party was a member of the Second Yatsenyuk Government, but it later moved into opposition.\n\nIn the snap parliamentary election of 2019 Batkivschyna received 8.18% of the votes and 26 MPs (two elected in constituencies). After a brief support of the Honcharuk Government, the party went into opposition.\n\nThe predecessor of today's party is the Association of Peace-loving Forces \"Batkivshchyna\" that was founded in 1995 by , a rector at Dnipropetrovsk National University. In 1998, Tymoshenko was elected a people's deputy of the Verkhovna Rada from the Bobrynets constituency (number 99) in Kirovohrad Oblast. In spring 1999, Tymoshenko created a parliamentary group called \"Fatherland\" as a breakaway group of Hromada. On 14 September 1998 the General Prosecutor of Ukraine accused Hromada leader Pavlo Lazarenko of embezzlement, and the following March Tymoshenko established the \"Fatherland\" parliamentary group. On 9 July 1999, based on the parliamentary group and smaller party, a new political party – All-Ukrainian Union \"Fatherland\" – was founded its constituent congress. The first party chairman was elected Viktor Drachenko, a former Communist Party secretary from Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. The party was registered by the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine on 16 September 1999 under certificate no. 122. At the second congress, held on 18 December of the same year, Yulia Tymoshenko was elected chairman of the party, replacing Drachenko.\n\nIn the 2002 parliamentary elections, the party was the main constituent of the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc. The bloc obtained 22 seats in the parliament, all on the party list. Thirteen of them were allocated to \"Fatherland\".\nYulia Tymoshenko Oleh Bilorus Oleksandr Turchynov Mykhailo Pavlovsky Petro TolochkoStepan Khmara Serhiy Pravdenko Viktor Taran Valentyn Zubov Yevhen Kyrylchuk\nIn January 2005, Tymoshenko became Prime Minister of Ukraine under Viktor Yushchenko's presidency. Several months earlier, she was a leader in the Orange Revolution which enabled Yushchenko's election.\n\nAfter losing several seats in 2002 and 2003, by September 2005 the bloc had grown to 40 members. In March 2005, the Yabluko party merged with Batkivshchyna. However, in March 2007 Yabluko became the Party of Free Democrats and withdrew from Batkivshchyna. In late 2005, the United Ukraine party also merged with Batkivshchyna. In the 2006 and 2007 parliamentary elections the party was part of the Tymoshenko Bloc, which won 129 of 450 seats in 2006 (22.29 percent of the total vote) and 156 of 450 seats (30.71 percent of the total vote) in 2007.\n\nYulia Tymoshenko Oleksandr Turchynov Mykola Tomenko Oleh Bilorus Yaroslav FedorchukAndriy Shkil Anatoliy Semynoha Serhiy Sas Viktor Taran Valentyn Zubov\nYulia Tymoshenko Oleksandr Turchynov Mykola Tomenko Yosyp Vinsky Hryhoriy Omelchenko\nVitaliy Kurylo Oleh Bilorus Yaroslav Fedorchuk Yevhen Suslov Andriy Shkil\nOn 18 December 2007 Yulia Tymoshenko was reelected prime minister by a two-vote margin, making Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc and the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc a majority coalition. Since 2008, the party has been an observer member of the European People's Party.\n\nIn 2009, \"Fatherland\" put Tymoshenko forward as a candidate for the presidency of Ukraine. After its defeat in the elections, the parliamentary coalition ceased to exist, and Tymoshenko's cabinet was dismissed. Tymoshenko stated on 22 February 2010 that she would go into opposition. During the 2010 Ukrainian local elections party (political blocs were not permitted to compete in the election) was defeated by the rival Party of Regions in nearly all regions of Ukraine, although it remained the main opposition party. Although Batkivshchyna won seats in 19 of 24 regional parliaments, it did not win a seat in the Supreme Council of Crimea. In Lviv Oblast and Kiev Oblast as well as in Ternopil the party did not participate in the elections cause it was unable to register its candidates. Yulia Tymoshenko claimed that \"fraudulent Batkivshchyna party organisations were registered on orders from Viktor Yanukovych\".\n\nOn 16 November 2010, the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc in the Verkhovna Rada was renamed the Bloc Yulia Tymoshenko-Batkivshchyna. During the presidency of Viktor Yanukovych several criminal cases were opened against Tymoshenko. On 5 August 2011 Tymoshenko was arrested. On 11 October she was sentenced to seven years in prison on charges of abuse of power and official authority when entering into gas contracts with Russia in January 2009. The Danish Helsinki Committee, observing the trial, came to the conclusion that it was politically motivated and included gross violations of the European Convention on Human Rights. In 2010–2013, the European Parliament adopted six resolutions in which the persecution of Tymoshenko was named \"politically motivated selective justice\".\n\nOn 17 November 2011, party blocs were again banned in parliamentary elections. The following month, Batkivshchyna and the People's Self-Defense party announced that the latter would merge with the former, and on 28 December first deputy head of the party Oleksandr Turchynov said, \"I believe that other political forces will join us\".\n\nBatkivshchyna, the former Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc member Reforms and Order Party and the People's Movement of Ukraine announced their intention to submit a single party list in the March 2012 parliamentary elections. On 7 April, Arseniy Yatsenyuk announced that the Front for Change party would join them on the single-party list.\nArseniy Yatsenyuk Anatoliy Hrytsenko Oleksandr Turchynov Vyacheslav Kyrylenko Hryhoriy Nemyrya\nSerhiy Sobolev Borys Tarasyuk Mykola Tomenko Mykola Knyazhytsky Mustafa Dzhemilyev\nOn 6 June 2012, Vyacheslav Kutovy and Volodymyr Kupchak left the party; Kupchak he had been threatened by party leader Yatsenyuk and the party had \"betrayed Yulia Tymoshenko, who had sparked the protest movement Rise up, Ukraine!\". In July 2012, Batkivshchyna agreed with the Svoboda party on the distribution of single-member district candidates in the 2012 parliamentary elections. Two weeks before the 28 October election, Batkivshchyna withdrew 26 parliamentary candidates in favour of the Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform (UDAR); UDAR withdrew 26 of its single-seat candidates in favour of Batkivshchyna candidates, attempting to maximise the opposition vote.\n\nBatkivshchyna was a \"de facto\" umbrella party in the election, whose election list included members of the Reforms and Order, People's Movement of Ukraine, Front for Change, For Ukraine!, People's Self-Defense, Civil Position and Social Christian parties. In July 2012, members of the Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar People joined the list, known as the Fatherland United Opposition. Front for Change leader Arseniy Yatsenyuk headed the list, because Tymoshenko was imprisoned. The list won 62 seats and 25.55 percent of the vote under the proportional party-list system (down from 30.71 percent in 2007 for the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc), and another 39 in simple-majority constituencies. Competing in 152 of 225 constituencies, they won a total of 101 seats, 22.67 percent of the 450 seats in the Verkhovna Rada. The party lost about two million votes, compared with the results of the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc in the previous election. Yatsenyuk was temporarily elected leader of this parliamentary faction on 12 December 2012. On 19 October 2012, Batkivshchyna and Svoboda signed an agreement for \"the creation of a coalition of democratic forces in the new parliament\". The party also coordinated its parliamentary activities with UDAR.\n\nIn early April 2013 four lawmakers left the party in protest of Yatsenyuk's leadership style, and Roman Stadniychuk was forced to replace Serhiy Vlasenko's parliamentary mandate. The following month, Batkivshchyna, UDAR and Svoboda pledged to coordinate for the 2015 Ukrainian presidential election.\n\nIn December 2012, the parties which aligned with Batkivshchyna in the 2012 parliamentary elections considered forming a single party. On 15 June 2013, the Reforms and Order Party and the Front for Change merged with Batkivshchyna. A portion of the People's Movement of Ukraine (including former chairman Borys Tarasyuk) also merged. The remainder of the party had merged with the Ukrainian People's Party the previous month. During the same congress, the party also approved Tymoshenko's nomination as its candidate for the 2015 Ukrainian presidential election, with all 482 delegates supporting the candidature of Tymoshenko.\n\nThe party played a substantial role in the anti-government Euromaidan protests, which began in late November 2013 and culminated in the 21 February 2014 impeachment of President Viktor Yanukovych after the February 2014 Ukrainian revolution, during which Tymoshenko was released from jail and officially rehabilitated. Immediately after the revolution, the Ukrainian Supreme Court closed the case and found that \"no crime was committed\". The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg acknowledged political persecution and torture and stopped studying the criminal cases against Yulia Tymoshenko dated 2011–2014. After Yanukovych's ouster, and return of the 2004 Constitution, a ruling coalition was formed, which included Batkivshchyna, UDAR and Svoboda. This coalition put together a coalition government headed by Arseniy Yatsenyuk.\n\nYulia Tymoshenko began to reform the party following the revolution. In early August 2014 Batkivshchyna expelled more than 1,500 members, including more than 700 deputies, in a lustration campaign.\n\nThe party has its own Batkivshchyna Battalion that has fought in the War in Donbass since May 2014.\n\nNadiya Savchenko Yulia Tymoshenko Ihor Lutsenko Serhiy Sobolev Alyona Shkrum\nVadym Ivchenko Hryhoriy Nemyria Ivan Krulko Oleksiy Ryabchyn Ihor Zhdanov\nOn 22 September 2014 the Central Election Commission made the decision to register Batkivshchyna in a nationwide multi-member constituency at the extraordinary elections to the Verkhovna Rada. Batkivshchyna garnered 894,837 votes (5.68%) in the elections, which meant that it was admitted to the 8th convocation of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine with 17 seats on party lists, and two seats in majority constituencies. Following the elections the party became a member of the coalition supporting the current second Yatsenyuk Government and had one minister in this government.\n\nOn 11 December 2014 parliament supported Yulia Tymoshenko's initiative calling for the release of Nadiya Savchenko. On 25 May 2016, Savchencko was exchanged in a prisoner swap for two Russian GRU officers captured by Ukraine. (Technically, she was granted a pardon by president Vladimir Putin.)\n\nOn 17 February 2016 Batkivshchyna withdrew from the Second Yatsenyuk Government following a vote in the Rada to remove Yatsenyuk from his position, which was rejected by a majority.\n\nThe party did not join the coalition that supports the Groysman Government, which was installed on 14 April 2016.\n\nDuring 17 July 2016 constituency mid-term elections the party won two (extra) seats in the Ukrainian parliament.\n\nOn 15 December 2016 Batkivshchyna expelled the number 1 on its 2014 parliamentary election list, Nadiya Savchenko, from its parliamentary faction in response to her earlier meeting with separatist leaders Aleksandr Zakharchenko (of the Donetsk People's Republic) and Igor Plotnitsky (of the Luhansk People's Republic). The party saw this meeting as \"negotiations with terrorists\" and \"adamantly opposed\" it.\n\nAccording to the Central Election Commission, the results of local elections in 2015 resulted in the All-Ukrainian Union \"Fatherland\" party placing second in Ukraine. \"Fatherland\" will be represented 8016 deputies in local councils, and by 369 deputies as heads of villages, towns and cities. In comparison to the 2014 parliamentary elections, \"Fatherland\" was able to increase its representation by 250%.\n\nIn 2016–2017 Ukraine held local elections in united territorial communities. According to the results of four big local elections \"Batkivshchyna\" took premier place among political parties (number of local deputies elected to local councils).\n\nAccording to Central Electoral Committee of Ukraine on elections to local councils held on 11 December 2016, \"Batkivshchyna\" got 14.34% of votes (120 deputies); on 18 December 2016 – 16.17% (515 deputies); on 30 April 2017 – 17.99% (197 deputies); on 29 October 2017 – 20.33% (901 deputies).\n\nIn the presidential election of March 2019 Yulia Timoshenko stood as presidential candidate for the All Ukrainian Union \"Fatherland\", scoring 13.40% (2,532,452 votes) and not reaching the second turn. She did not endors either Zelensky or Poroshenko.\n\nIn the July 2019 Ukrainian parliamentary election the top 5 of the party list were Tymoshenko, Serhiy Taruta, Valentyn Nalyvaichenko, Serhiy Sobolyev and Olena Kondratyuk. In early June, Tymoshenko announced that the party will not be part of opposition to President Zelensky if it is not included in the ruling coalition formed after the next elections. In the snap parliamentary election of 2019 Batkivschyna slightly improved its performance, scoring 8.18% (1,196,303) and electing 26 MPs. The party abstained from the confidence vote to the new Honcharuk Government, but ensured it would support the government from outside. However, on 13 November 2019, the party went into opposition.\nYulia Tymoshenko Serhiy Taruta Valentyn Nalyvaichenko Serhiy Sobolev Olena Kondratiuk\nIvan Kyrylenko Andriy Kozhemyakin Hryhoriy Nemyria Serhiy Vlasenko Valeriy Dubil\nThe party manifesto claims that it seeks to instill in Ukraine national, democratic, and Christian values, held together through reformation, spirituality, patriotism, national solidarity, responsibility, rights and freedoms. The party advocates transforming Ukraine into a competitive nation-state based on a western Europe model of justice and welfare.\n\nAccording to the party, only citizens of Ukraine will have the right to private ownership of land, but that \"high concentration of land ownership by one person\" will be forbidden.\n\nThe party sees Ukrainian membership in the European Union (EU) as a strategic goal. It favors visa-free travel for Ukrainians to the EU and wants to \"cancel humiliating visa regimes\". It would like to see \"a mutually beneficial and equitable agreement on the establishment of free trade with Russia\". In June 2013, the party's parliamentary faction voted for the denunciation of the 2010 Ukrainian–Russian Naval Base for Natural Gas treaty.\n\nThe party's 2012 election program did not mention NATO, but its 2014 program stated that the party wants to annul Ukraine's non-aligned status and that it wants Ukraine to become a member of NATO.\n\nThe party wants to prosecute \"Law enforcement involved in political repression\".\n\nThe party is in favor of party-list proportional representation elections with open lists.\nIt also favors Citizens' Initiatives when 50,000 signatures are collected.\nThe party wants to empower local governance.\n\nGovernment grants should be awarded to graduates who successfully passed testing for studies at Ukrainian universities.\n\nIt proposes a Ukraine's health system that has mandatory health inspections and a gradual development of voluntary health insurance system funded by employers.\n\nThe party wants to introduce jury trials into the Ukrainian law system and wants to \"depoliticise\" the process of appointment of judges. It also wants an independent judiciary that will increase the role of the Supreme Court of Ukraine.\nThe Constitutional Court of Ukraine, \"which has compromised itself with decisions that were ordered (by the Yanukovych administration)\" should be liquidated. It wants the criminal code to be \"Europeanized\" and law enforcement brought under civil control.\n\nThe party wants to improve human rights in Ukraine.\n\nThe party regards the Holodomor as a genocide of the Ukrainian nation.\n\nBefore their removal of power in February 2014 the party sought to impeach former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych and his \"anti-people regime\" to \"return Ukraine to the path of European integration\", while trying to reverse the former Azarov Government policy of raising the status of the Russian language.\n\n15 May 2016 \"Fatherland\" prepared a statement in the name of the new Prosecutor General in connection with offenses in the activities of the National Commission, which performs state regulation in the energy and utilities relative to the unjustified increase of gas prices for the population.\n\n23 May 2016 All-Ukrainian Union \"Fatherland\" launched a website \"Fair rates\", which promotes the idea of establishing fair gas tariffs for the population.\n\nIn the parliament, Batkivshchyna advocates ban on agricultural land sales. The party also insists on adopting laws on development of Ukrainian agriculture. On 31 March 2016, Parliament adopted the law on family farms initiated by the party Batkivshchyna.\n\nOne of the party's priorities is improvement of social security of people, increasing of social standards.\n\nThe party advocates decreasing of tariffs on housing and utility services for people, because they are set up too high artificially. On 21 April 2015 Yulia Tymoshenko initiated a working group to check the validity of utility tariffs. \"Fatherland\" party has made the reduction of tariffs for housing and communal services.\n\nBatkivshchyna advocates strengthening the struggle against corruption, namely deoffshorization and independence of anti-corruption government bodies.\n\nThe party is also against selling and privatization of the state's strategic objects.\n\n\n\n"}

Set in a wooded estate, it is one of three properties owned and managed by the National Trust in County Fermanagh, the others being Florence Court and the Crom Estate.\n\nThe townland, which is in size, is situated in the civil parish of Derryvullan, in the historic barony of Tirkennedy, as well as Fermanagh and Omagh district.\n\nThe Castle Coole estate was purchased in 1656 by the Belfast merchant John Corry, grandfather of the first Earl. The estate is named for Lough Coole (from Irish Gaelic \"cúil\", 'seclusion'), a lake surrounded by the Killynure hills. A ráth here and a crannog in Lough Coole itself are reminders that the area has been settled since prehistoric times. Other lakes on the estate include Lough Yoan and Brendrum Lough.\n\nThe site of a 17th-century house and bawn and formal garden at Castle Coole (grid ref: H2574 4333) are Scheduled Historic Monuments.\n\nCastle Coole was constructed between 1789 and 1798 as the summer retreat of Armar Lowry-Corry, the 1st Earl Belmore. Lord Belmore was the Member of Parliament for County Tyrone in the former Irish Houses of Parliament in Dublin and a wealthy heir to of land throughout Ireland, acquired by ancestors with a successful background in merchantry. The income generated by the estates allowed Castle Coole to be constructed at a cost of £57,000 in 1798, equivalent to approximately £20 million today. The siting on the comparatively small estate in County Fermanagh was primarily due to its unspoilt rural location and natural environment amongst ancient oak woodland and small lakes, yet with proximity to the market town of Enniskillen for the domestic labour necessary for a large mansion. Additionally, several smaller family residences had been built on the Castle Coole estate preceding the mansion, including a dwelling of the King James period (later deliberately destroyed by fire) and a Queen Anne house built in 1709.\n\nFollowing the passage in 1800 of the Act of Union, the law politically uniting Britain and Ireland, the family moved from their main residence – a small townhouse in Sackville Street, Dublin – to Castle Coole, as the reason for living in Dublin, to be close to the Parliament, no longer applied.\n\nIn 1951 the 7th Earl Belmore transferred the mansion to the National Trust, prompted by two sets of death duties or inheritance tax when the 5th and 6th Earls Belmore died without issue 18 months apart. However, the contents of the mansion, including much that is today shown to visitors, remain the Earl Belmore's property. The National Trust opens the mansion to visitors during the summer months, and the estate can be visited year-round. Between 1980 and 1988, the mansion was closed to the public while the National Trust undertook major restoration work, including the dismantling the façade to replace metal anchors that hold the stone in place as these were corroding. This was done with such sensitivity and care that today the weathered stone looked quite undisturbed. To celebrate the re-opening, the Queen Mother was invited to Castle Coole. As part of the transfer of ownership to the National Trust there is an agreement that the Earl Belmore retains an apartment in the S wing, currently used by his heir and family. The Earl himself lives in a small house elsewhere on the estate.\n\nNeo-classical in architectural style, Castle Coole was the work of two Georgian period architects who did not collaborate. Richard Johnston, an Irish architect, was initially commissioned and completed the basement. Johnston was dismissed in favour of the popular and fashionable English architect James Wyatt, who, rather than starting afresh, began where Johnston left off and completed the mansion on the same footprint. Wyatt adhered closely to the Neo-classical ideal of restraint, symmetry and meticulous proportions, with architectural features carefully scaled. An Ionic portico and flanking Doric colonnaded wings extend either end of the main block of the house. Wyatt probably never visited the site and sent drawings for the house from London. The very fine and varied plaster ceilings were all the work of the English artist Joseph Rose.\n\nNotable aspects of the mansion include the Portland stone façades and sober portico with Ionic capitals. Inside there more restrained grandeur with the entrance hall boasting four massive scagliola columns. A double-return cantilever staircase leads to an unusual double-height saloon at first floor that rises up a further floor with a bedroom gallery over-looking. Both spaces are decorated amply with Doric columns in scagliola of diminishing scale from lower to higher.\n\nWyatt also designed some of the most important furniture in the mansion. Such architect-designed Neo-classical pieces still in the situation for which they are designed are rare, much of their aesthetic value arising from their surviving in the original location. Other furniture was placed by the second Earl, when the Regency style was in vogue and by later generations, so that the interior appearance today is many layered, not just neo-classical. \nA state bedroom, prepared in 1821 for King George IV (un-used by the King, who failed to arrive), retains original furnishings, state bed and flock wallpaper. A drawing room furnished in a French Empire style, a Grecian staircase hall, and a ladies' workroom furnished in a Chinese style reflect the importance of worldly knowledge and awareness during the Regency period. Family motifs, engraved into Italian marble chimneypieces and adorning the plaster frieze of the Entrance Hall, reflect the first Earl's pride in his family heritage. The rooms to the mansion's garden front have views of Lough Coole.\n\nThere is an extensive basement under the house and extending some way under the adjacent northwest lawns. This below-ground area is partially restored and open to the public and contains kitchens, servants' hall, larders, wine-cellars, laundry, a Roman style plunge-bath, a brewery and other offices. Castle Coole has no above-ground service door. Wyatt sought to give the impression—often sought by Neo-classical architects—of a perfect composition on ancient proportional principles, isolated in a ”natural” landscape. Externally, the practical offices supporting the house are all accessed by a long inclined tunnel from the stable yard away, so that tradesmen, servants and estate staff approached and left the house unseen, with the architect's Neo-classical ideal composition above ground left seemingly undisturbed by day-to-day business.\n\nNumerous out-buildings can be found on the estate; those of interest include lodges, ”Grand Yard”, workshops, stables, and a ”Tallow House“ (originally used for candle-making, now a gift shop and reception area). The entrance to the service tunnel to the house is adjacent to the Grand Yard.\n\nMuch of the native oak, ash and beech planting of the landscape park remains, today grazed by cattle and sheep as originally intended. A considerable portion of the estate has been historically given over to agriculture and let to local farmers, a practice which continues today. A part to the South West has been taken by the Enniskillen Golf Club and here the original planting is compromised by moden golf course design. To the South East part of the estate was sold off for the Killyevlin Industrial Estate.\n\nA 'ha-ha' - that is a ditch to control livestock movements without visual interruption to the landscape resulting from a fence or a wall - can be found near the mansion. Vestigial remains of the earlier extensive parterres of the earlier Baroque house can be seen in the park, but are difficult to discern today, in spite of interpretation panels installed by the National Trust.\n\nThe Belmore earldom is named after the nearby Belmore Mountain, west of Enniskillen. Corry had hoped to be named Earl of Enniskillen, until this title was given to the Cole family at Florence Court. Though the origins of the Corry side of the family can be found in Belfast, there is more uncertainty with the Lowry side. The Lowrys may originally have been from Dumfries in Scotland.\n\nAs a member of the peerage of Ireland, the earl of Belmore had a seat in the Irish House of Lords until it was abolished in 1801 when the kingdom of Ireland was merged into the United Kingdom. The second and fourth earls subsequently sat in the House of Lords at Westminster as representative peers.\n\nAt its peak, Castle Coole employed around 90 staff, both indoor and outdoor. The basement of the mansion was entirely the domain of the indoor staff, and accommodation for the outdoor staff was mainly found in the buildings surrounding the Grand Yard. During the early stages in the mansion's history when the main residence of the Belmore family was in Dublin, a caretaker staff of 5-10 servants remained in the mansion when the family were away. This may help explain the excellent condition of the mansion today; continuous occupancy prevented decay and may have helped prevent major disasters, such as fires.\n\nAs in many mansions, a hierarchy amongst servants formed. The Head Cook for instance enjoyed a two-room apartment above the warmth of the Kitchens. The Butler too enjoyed a personal apartment. A boot boy on the other hand had communal accommodation with other lower ranking servants.\n\nCastle Coole re-opened to the public for the 2006 season on 17 March. A re-design of the Victorian Bedroom layout now commemorates four years of Australian influence at Castle Coole. Somerset Lowry-Corry, the 4th Earl Belmore, became the Conservative Governor of New South Wales on 8 January 1868 and served until 23 February 1872. At Government House, Sydney, the 4th Earl's first son was born on 1 May 1870, later to become the 5th Earl Belmore. Lady Belmore found the summer climate of Sydney oppressive and despite frequent retreats to Moss Vale, concern over his wife's health prompted the Lord Belmore to resign his governorship on 26 June 1871 allowing the Belmore family to return to Castle Coole the following year. Belmore Park, Sydney and Belmore Park, Goulburn testify to New South Wales railway developments brought about by Lord Belmore's governorship and his own personal popularity in Australia. As the bedroom of the 4th Earl and Countess at Castle Coole both prior to and following their four years in Australia, the Victorian Bedroom commemorates the connection.\n\nAdmission to Castle Coole is by guided tour only.

Dobson Cellular Systems was a wholly owned subsidiary of Dobson Communications Corporation based in Oklahoma City. It was the provider of Cellular One-branded services in the United States. Dobson operated under the brand name of Cellular One, and provided service on a D-AMPS and GSM network. The company purchased the rights to the Cellular One name from Alltel in December 2005.\n\nFormed in the 1920s, Dobson Communications originally operated a small wireline telephone network in Oklahoma. In 70 years, Dobson had evolved to become the nation's largest independent rural wireless provider. Dobson's operations in 60 markets were acquired through several purchases within the last 10 years.\n\nOn June 29, 2007 AT&T Inc. announced that they had reached an agreement to purchase Dobson Cellular division. The closing price was $2.8B USD or $13 per share. AT&T also agreed to assume the outstanding debt of $2.3B USD.\n\nThe sale completed on November 15, 2007, with market transition beginning December 9, 2007. The Cellular One brand name was sold to Trilogy Partners in February 2008.\n\nThe Federal government prevented AT&T from taking certain Dobson markets In Texas, Oklahoma, and Kentucky along the Ohio border and the I-75 corridor, due to the potential monopoly this would create in this area. After placing these markets in a trust for one year, the Kentucky markets were sold to Verizon Wireless in November 2008 with market transition to be completed by November 2009, and the others, TX-10 and OK-5, were sold to affiliates of MTPCS, LLC, which concurrently adopted the Cellular One brand under a license agreement with Trilogy Partners.\n\nDobson was, for the most part, a rural provider. It claimed to be the largest provider of cellular services in Alaska as well as in Michigan. It was also the exclusive provider of GSM technology in many of its markets and has a few resellers such as TracFone and smaller MVNOs in particular states. It also provided voice and data roaming capability for many AT&T and T-Mobile customers. Dobson had recently upgraded a majority of its GSM/GPRS towers with an EDGE overlay, providing an even faster data rate for their customers.\n\n"}

Prokofiev wrote the opera in piano score between November 1915 and April 1916, and completed the orchestration in January 1917. Vsevolod Meyerhold was engaged as stage director. However, in the wake of the 1917 February Revolution, that production never occurred.\n\nThe opera did not receive its first performance until 1929, after it had been extensively revised (in 1927), at the Théâtre Royal de la Monnaie, Brussels. Prokofiev prepared an orchestral suite based on the opera in 1931 (see below).\n\nThe Bolshoi Opera performed the opera at the Metropolitan Opera (The Met) in New York City in 1975, but the Met did not mount its own first production until March 2001. \n\nThe original version of the opera was finally staged in 2001 at the Bolshoi Theatre, Moscow, conducted by Gennady Rozhdestvensky.\n\nIn the Grand Hotel garden, Alexei, tutor to the General's family, meets Polina, the General's ward, who is in debt to the Marquis. Alexei loves Polina, and informs her that he observed her directions to pawn her jewelry and gamble with the funds. However, he lost the money. The General is enamoured of the much younger demimondaine Blanche, and enters with her, the Marquis and Mr Astley, an Englishman. When asked about his losses, Alexei says he lost his own savings. He is chided that someone of his modest income should not gamble, but Alexei dismisses the idea of saving money with a caustic diatribe. Astley is impressed and invites Alexei to tea. The General then receives a telegram from \"Babulenka\" (literally a diminutive of 'grandmother'; she is, in fact, the General's aunt and Polina's grandmother) in Moscow. The General is hoping that Babulenka will die soon so that he can inherit her money and marry Blanche.\n\nPolina is frustrated that she cannot repay her debts to the Marquis. While Alexei continues to protest that he loves her, she wonders if he has any other interest than greed. The General interrupts their conversation. Polina challenges Alexei to prove his love, and to see if he would truly do anything for her, by making a pass at a German Baroness sitting in the park. Alexei does this, to the anger of the Baron. In the ensuing fuss, the Baron and Baroness leave.\n\nIn the hotel lobby, the General reproaches Alexei for his actions. Alexei is unrepentant, upon which the General dismisses him as his family tutor. The General then tries to obtain the help of the Marquis in preventing any appearance of a scandal. Mr. Astley enters, and explains to Alexei the General's concerns. Blanche had earlier asked the Baron for a loan, which upset the Baroness. Because of the high social status of the Baron and Baroness, the General is keen to avoid any sense of impropriety. Astley further explains that the General cannot propose to Blanche until he receives his share of the inheritance from Babulenka. Alexei begins to think that once Polina receives her own share of the inheritance, the Marquis will attempt to win her over.\n\nThe Marquis appears on the General's behalf, to try to mollify Alexei's behaviour. Alexei is contemptuous to the Marquis, until the Marquis produces a note from Polina, which calls on Alexei to stop behaving like a schoolboy. Alexei accuses him of making Polina write the letter and leaves in anger. The Marquis tells the General and Blanche that he was successful in subduing Alexei.\n\nThe General predicts Babulenka's death that same evening, but immediately afterward, her voice is heard, as she has arrived at the hotel, in good health. She greets Alexei and Polina with some affection, but at once she sees through the General and the others. She says that she has overcome her illness and plans to recuperate, and gamble, at the spa.\n\nAt the casino, Babulenka has been losing her money at the roulette tables, and ignoring all pleas to stop. The General is despondent and sees his chances with Blanche diminish. After the Marquis tells just how much Babulenka has lost, the General suggests to summon the police but The Marquis dissuades him. Alexei arrives, and the General and the Marquis ask for his help to halt Babulenka's gambling losses. Prince Nilsky, another potential suitor to Blanche, then arrives and further enumerates Babulenka's losses. The General collapses, distraught, and then runs into the casino. Blanche departs with Nilsky. Alexei wonders of what will happen with Polina's family, after Babulenka's financial losses. Babulenka, exhausted and depleted of funds, wants to go home to Moscow. Babulenka asks Polina to come with her, but declines. The General bewails Babulenka's losses and his own loss of Blanche to Nilsky.\n\nIn his hotel room, Alexei finds Polina, who has a letter from the Marquis. The Marquis says he is selling General's properties mortgaged to him, but will forgive fifty thousand for Polina's sake, and Marquis will consider their relationship as over. Polina feels this paying her off as an insult and wish she had fifty thousand to fling at Marquis's face. Alexei is deliriously pleased that Polina has turned to him for assistance.\n\nRushing to the casino, Alexei has a run of good luck, winning twenty times in a row and breaking the bank. After an entr'acte, the other patrons continue to talk about Alexei's run. Alexei returns to his room, yet he continues to hear the voices of the croupiers and the other gamblers. He then becomes aware of Polina who has been waiting for him. He offers her funds to pay the Marquis back. She refuses and asks whether he really loves her. When Alexei gives her the money, she tosses it back in his face and runs out. The opera ends with Alexei alone in the room, recalling obsessively his success at the tables.\n\n\nProkofiev produced an orchestral suite from the opera in 1931. The four portraits are Alexei, Babulenka, the General and Polina; the dénouement is not, in fact, the last scene of the opera, but represents Alexei's winning streak at roulette. As \"The Gambler\" is not a number opera, none of the characters has any extended arias; Prokofiev, therefore, gathered the basic materials for the suite by tearing up the score and heaping the pages relating to each character together in piles.\n\n\n"}

Alkhabaz, 104 F.3d 1492 (6th Cir. 1997) was a case brought against University of Michigan undergraduate Abraham Jacob Alkhabaz, a.k.a. Jake Baker, related to several incidents regarding snuff stories that he wrote while he was a student at the University of Michigan. Alkhabaz was charged with violation of 18 U.S.C. s 875(c), communicating via interstate or foreign commerce threats to kidnap or injure another person. The case raised immediate First Amendment concerns and is considered an important one in the history of cyber law.\n\nJake Baker (born March 1974; given name Abraham Jacob Alkhabaz) was a student at the University of Michigan College for Literature, Science, and Arts.\n\nIn October 1994, Jake Baker started submitting pornographic stories depicting fantasies of rape, torture, and murder to the alt.sex.stories Usenet group. On January 9, 1995, Baker submitted a story to alt.sex.stories detailing a fantasy about the rape, torture, and murder of one of his classmates, \"Jane Doe.\" The victim wishes not to be named as this has affected her life in many harmful ways. Baker's story was brought to the attention of University of Michigan authorities and he was arrested, determined to be a threat to the subject of his story as well as the rest of the student population.\n\nDuring the serving of a search warrant upon Baker's computer, University of Michigan police found several stories depicting rape, torture, and murder genre favored by Baker. They also found emails to a Canadian by the name of Arthur Gonda, depicting rape, torture, and murder. Their communications also began detailing a plan for the two men to meet and engage in a real-life depiction of their fantasies to rape, torture, and murder.\n\nOn February 9, 1995 Baker was arrested by the FBI and he was later indicted for six counts of violating 18 U.S.C. § 875(c), which prohibits interstate communications containing threats to kidnap or injure another person. Five of the counts were determined by emails between Baker and Gonda. The sixth count was determined from the story about \"Jane Doe.\"\n\nThe Magistrate Judge ordered Baker detained as a danger to the community and a United States District Court affirmed his detention. Upon Baker's motion to be released on bond, this Court ordered a psychological evaluation. When the evaluation concluded that Baker posed no threat to the community, this Court ordered Baker's release.\n\nOne of the counts - communicating a threat by publishing the story about \"Jane Doe\" on the Internet - was dropped against Baker. On June 21, 1995, the case against Baker was dismissed by Judge Avern Cohn due to lack of evidence that Baker would actually act out his fantasies. The Government appealed this decision, and on January 29, 1997, the 6th U.S. Court of Appeals upheld the decision of the lower court.\n\nFree speech advocates state that the Government violated Jake Baker's First Amendment right to free speech by charging him with a crime for writing stories. Others defended the Government's case by stating that Baker's stories were filth, snuff, and that Baker was intending to act on them.\n\nBaker stated that his stories were created as a form of therapy - so that he could act out his anger in a \"harmless\", legal way. Baker also stated that he was role playing within his emails to Gonda, and that he did not intend to act on his fantasies.\n\nThis case was not only about obscenity and threats, but it was being watched by Internet advocates, namely that his stories were published over a wide medium, and that since the Internet is a medium beyond borders, that state even federal level laws were not able to be applied to it. Baker was charged with communicating a threat over interstate lines - a charge that may have not been able to hold, other than the fact that Baker published his stories and corresponded over the Internet.\n\nIt has also been said that this case set a precedent for free speech on the Internet.\n\n\nThis case has been cited in various cases regarding free speech protection and the Internet.\n\n\n"}

Communications Company, Embassy Television, Embassy Telecommunications, and Embassy Communications) was an American television production company that originally began in 1974. It's currently an in-name-only unit of Sony Pictures Television.\n\nELP Communications was first known as T.A.T. Communications Company when it was formed in 1974 when Norman Lear joined up with former talent agent Jerry Perenchio, a year before Yorkin ended his partnership with Lear. \"T.A.T.\" stood for a Yiddish phrase pronounced \"Tuches Ahfen Tisch\", which meant \"Putting one's butt on the line\" (ass on the table).\n\nThe first sitcom to be produced by T.A.T. Communications was \"The Jeffersons\", that was spun off from the sitcom \"All in the Family\" in 1975.\n\nTelevision producer Norman Lear and his business partner Jerry Perenchio bought Avco Embassy Pictures Corporation in January 1982 and decided to drop the name \"Avco\" from the name to bring back the name Embassy Pictures and T.A.T. Communications Co. was renamed as Embassy Communications, Inc.\n\nLear decided to launch Embassy Television, a division name for his shows by the former T.A.T. Communications such as \"The Jeffersons\", \"One Day at a Time\", and \"The Facts of Life\". More shows were produced by Embassy Television such as the first two under the name: \"Square Pegs\" and \"Silver Spoons\". The latter show ran five seasons, while the former ran one but developed a cult following. \"Who's the Boss?\" was piloted later in 1983 until airing in 1984. Embassy Television also produced \"Diff'rent Strokes\"s final season from Tandem Productions, which was eventually operated by Embassy.\n\nEmbassy also held the TV rights to a majority of the Embassy theatrical library \"(see Embassy Pictures for more information)\", syndicated under the umbrella title \"Embassy Night at the Movies\". Embassy Telecommunications (formerly P*I*T*S Films), was the television distribution arm of Embassy Television. They distributed off-net syndicated shows by Embassy Television and those by Tandem Productions and T.A.T. Communications.\n\nLear and Perenchio sold Embassy Communications (included Tandem Productions) to The Coca-Cola Company (then-current owners of Columbia Pictures) for $485 million on June 18, 1985. After the sale, Lear, Perenchio, nor Bud Yorkin were no longer involved with Embassy or Tandem. A month later in July 1985, CBS canceled \"The Jeffersons\" and \"Diff'rent Strokes\" was already canceled by NBC. The latter was later moved to ABC. During the fall, a new sitcom called \"227\", debuted on NBC.\n\nA year later, Embassy Communications became the only television banner as Embassy's television divisions (Embassy Television, Embassy Telecommunications, and Tandem Productions) were consolidated. When ABC canceled \"Diff'rent Strokes\", the brand name Tandem Productions became dormant but renamed active as an in-name-only division. On November 24, 1986, Coca-Cola fused Embassy's television operations including the movie packages (\"Embassy Night at the Movies\", \"Embassy II\" and \"Embassy III\") with Columbia Pictures Television; the combined company became Columbia/Embassy Television, though Columbia and Embassy continued to produce and distribute programs under their separate names. During that formation, Coca-Cola took Columbia and Embassy out of the first-run syndication business and focused them on first-run network and off-net syndication programming. \"Married... with Children\" was the next -- and as it would transpire, last -- successful sitcom by Embassy Communications, debuting as part of the fledgling Fox Broadcasting Company's first primetime lineup in 1987.\n\nOn December 21, 1987, Coca-Cola sold its Columbia Pictures entertainment businesses to Tri-Star Pictures, Inc. and renamed the Tri-Star holding company as \"Columbia Pictures Entertainment\" for $3.1 billion. Columbia/Embassy Television then merged with Tri-Star Television to form a new version of Columbia Pictures Television. Embassy Communications then became ELP (Embassy Limited Partnership) Communications. Still-running and newer Embassy shows would begin to use the Columbia Pictures Television logo in January 1988 but would use the ELP copyright in the credits in February 1988. \"Embassy Night at the Movies\" was renamed as \"Columbia Night at the Movies\". On November 8, 1989, Columbia Pictures Entertainment was sold to Sony Corporation and renamed as Sony Pictures Entertainment on August 7, 1991.\n\nThe final long running show to be produced by Embassy Television, as ELP Communications, was \"Beakman's World\" in 1992. In February 1994, SPE merged Columbia Pictures Television and the newly relaunched TriStar Television to become Columbia TriStar Television.

It was usually dominated by the area's top star, Harley Race, and as such it was considered a \"stepping stone\" to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship (although only Race, Terry Funk, Kerry Von Erich and Ric Flair made it; Gene Kiniski, Dory Funk, Jr. and Jack Brisco were already former World Champions upon winning the Missouri title). A version of the Missouri Championship has been documented to exist in 1899, 1921, 1933 to 1934, 1937, 1947, 1950, and 1954 to 1955, but it was only in 1972 that a serious championship was established. Prior to the creation of the NWA the championship was not recognized outside of the region and used by regional promoters, it is even possible that competing Missouri Heavyweight Championships existed. The championship was abandoned in 1986, as the Central States promotion was being consolidated under Jim Crockett Promotions in order to counter the World Wrestling Federation's national expansion.\n\n\n"}

The college's student-faculty ratio is 19:1.\n\nRoane State's \"main\" campus is in Harriman. Additional campuses are located in Oak Ridge, LaFollette, Crossville, Jamestown, Knoxville, Lenoir City, Huntsville, and Wartburg.\n\nThe first classes were offered in the fall of 1971 at a temporary location, and in August 1973 the college moved to the current location of its main campus on Patton Lane in Harriman.\n\nRoane State's first permanent branch campus, designated as the Oak Ridge campus, was located in western Knox County near the Pellissippi Parkway and was shared with State Technical Institute at Knoxville, another Board of Regents institution. In the fall of 1988, two years after the campus opened in 1986, State Technical Institute became Pellissippi State Technical Community College and took over the entire campus, while Roane State moved its Oak Ridge classes to leased sites in Oak Ridge. A new permanent Roane State Oak Ridge campus opened in Oak Ridge on August 13, 1999.\n\nIn 1989 higher education centers were established in leased facilities in Cumberland, Scott, and Loudon counties. In 1990 a center was opened in Campbell County. The Scott County center relocated to a permanent site in Huntsville in 1994 and the Cumberland County center opened in a permanent site in Crossville in 1998. Also in 1998, Roane State's Center for Health Sciences moved into a new leased facility in western Knox County that was built specifically for the college and the Tamke-Allan Observatory, a new college center for astronomy, was dedicated.

Anohni started the band, its name inspired by the drag queen and activist Marsha P. Johnson. The debut album, \"Antony and the Johnsons\", was released in 1998. In 2001, Hegarty released a short follow-up EP, \"I Fell in Love with a Dead Boy\", which, in addition to the title track, included a cover of \"Mysteries of Love\", a David Lynch/Angelo Badalamenti song and \"Soft Black Stars\", a Current 93 cover.\n\nProducer Hal Willner heard the EP and played it to Lou Reed, who immediately recruited Hegarty for his project \"The Raven\". Now gaining more attention, Hegarty signed to U.S.-based record label Secretly Canadian, and released another EP, \"The Lake\", with Lou Reed guest-performing on one of the tracks. Secretly Canadian also re-released Hegarty's debut album in the United States to wider distribution in 2004.\n\nAnohni's second full-length album, 2005's \"I Am a Bird Now\", was greeted with positive reviews and significantly more mainstream attention. The album featured guest appearances by Lou Reed, Rufus Wainwright, Boy George, and Devendra Banhart, and circled themes of duality and transformation. \"I Am a Bird Now\" featured arrangements by Maxim Moston and Julia Kent and was mixed by Doug Henderson. In September 2005 Antony and the Johnsons were awarded the Mercury Prize for the best UK album of 2005. Rival Mercury nominees, and favorites for the prize, the Kaiser Chiefs suggested that Anohni got in on a technicality; despite the fact she was born in the United Kingdom she spent much of her time in the U.S.—although they later apologized for the suggestion that she wasn't a deserving winner.\n\nIn 2005 Anthony and the Johnsons single \"Hope there is Someone\" featured in the celebrated Spanish director Isabel Coixet's 7th film \"The Secret Life of Words\" \"Hope there is Someone\" went on to be arguably one of the bands most popular songs. The group then collaborated with experimental film-maker Charles Atlas and presented \"TURNING\" in November 2006 in Rome, London, Paris, Madrid, and Braga. Thirteen women from New York City were presented in intimate live video portraits during the course of the concert. \"The Guardian\" called the piece \"fragile, life affirming, and truly wonderful (five stars)\". \"Le Monde\" in Paris hailed \"TURNING\" as \"Concert-manifeste transsexuel\".\n\nThe 2007 film about Bob Dylan, \"I'm Not There\", featured their cover of his song \"Knockin' On Heaven's Door\" on the soundtrack release.\n\nAntony and the Johnsons' 5-song \"Another World EP\" was released on October 7, 2008. Antony and the Johnsons' third album, \"The Crying Light\", was released on January 19, 2009 and went to No. 1 on the European Billboard charts. Anohni has described the theme of the album as being \"about landscape and the future\". Nature, death, love and the role of the artist were explored across ten tracks, which included the single \"Epilepsy Is Dancing.\" The album was mixed by Bryce Goggin and included arrangements by Nico Muhly.\n\nAnn Powers wrote of \"The Crying Light\" for the LA Times online, \"it's the most personal environmentalist statement possible, making an unforeseen connection between queer culture's identity politics and the green movement. As music, it's simply exquisite—more controlled and considered than anything Antony and the Johnsons have done and sure to linger in the minds of listeners.\"\n\nAfter touring throughout North America and Europe in support of their new album, Antony and the Johnsons presented a unique staging of \"The Crying Light\" with the Manchester Camerata at the Manchester Opera House for the 2009 Manchester International Festival. The concert hall was transformed into a crystal cave filled with laser effects created by installation artist Chris Levine. Antony and the Johnsons went on to present concerts with symphonies across Europe in Summer 2009, including the Opera Orchestra of Lyon, the Metropole Orchestra, Roma Sinfonietta and the Montreux Jazz Festival Orchestra. At Salle Pleyel in Paris, Anohni appeared in a costume designed for her by Riccardo Tisci of Givenchy.\n\nAfter two sold-out concerts at the Sydney Opera House, Antony and the Johnsons ended their recent touring in February 2010 in Tokyo. Anohni, Johanna Constantine and William Basinski performed at the Sogetsu Hall with butoh master Yoshito Ohno, the son of the 103-year-old dancer Kazuo Ohno, whose image graces the cover of The Crying Light. Kazuo Ohno died in June of that year, and Anohni wrote an obituary for the dancer in \"The Guardian\".\n\nIn interviews around the world in 2010, Anohni described her work on \"Swanlights\" and \"The Crying Light\" as \"a collision between joy and a sense of hopelessness\". Anohni said she was struggling to come to terms with the idea that she was part of a society that was having a \"virulent\" impact on the earth. She suggested that the degradation of nature was partially a result of the subjugation of women and earth-based spiritual systems. Anohni also blamed the collapse of humanity's sustainable relationship with the earth in part on the rise of patriarchal religions that suggest the destiny of humanity to be \"a paradise elsewhere\". \"Interview Magazine\" describes \"Swanlights\" as \"an emotional personal call for global, collective change\".\n\nSeptember 2010 saw the release of the \"Thank You For Your Love EP\" which includes covers of Dylan's \"Pressing On\" and Lennon's \"Imagine\". The Sun listed \"Thank You For Your Love\" as single of the week on August 27, 2010.\n\nAntony and the Johnsons released a 4th album \"Swanlights\" on October 12, 2010 through Secretly Canadian and Rough Trade Records. Simultaneously, Abrams Books published a book edition of \"Swanlights\" featuring Anohni's drawings and collages with photography by Don Felix Cervantes. Antony and the Johnsons performed \"Thank You For Your Love\" on both the \"Late Show with David Letterman\" and \"Later... with Jools Holland\" in support of the album's release. In October 2010 Anohni was invited to \"takeover\" \"The Guardian\"s music and arts page that ran for weeks leading up to the release of Swanlights. Stereogum placed \"Swanlights\" in its Top 50 Albums of the year at #8.\n\nIn tribute to Kazuo Ohno, Antony and the Johnsons performed on October 30, 2010 at Lincoln Center's Avery Fisher Hall with the Orchestra of St. Luke's and featured the film \"Mr. O's Book of the Dead\" directed by Chiaki Nagano and starring Kazuo Ohno.\n\nIn January 2011, Anohni was a guest on \"Winterguest\", a program on Dutch Television's VPRO channel and was interviewed by Leon Verdonschot.\n\nIn 2010–2011, the song \"Her Eyes Are Underneath The Ground\" from the album \"The Crying Light\" was chosen as one of the five stimuli that the International Baccalaureate Organization chose for the IB Theatre Arts PPP.\n\nOn January 26, 2012, the Museum of Modern Art in New York produced a sold-out performance by Antony and the Johnsons, entitled \"Swanlights\" after their fourth studio album, at Radio City Music Hall, a collaboration with laser artist Chris Levine and set designer Carl Robertshaw. The event was prefaced by a speech from Dr. Julia Yasuda, who said: \"I am concerned about nature changing and dying. Won't you please help her? Otherwise the world will be too lonely\". \"The New York Times\" described the concert as \"Cries From the Heart, Crashing Like Waves\". This collaboration was later staged at the Royal Opera House in London in 2013 for two days and at the Teatro Real in Madrid in 2014 for four consecutive days.\n\nAntony and the Johnsons released a live symphonic album in August 2012 entitled \"Cut the World\"; it features a track called \"Future Feminism\", which consists of a speech in which Anohni disparages patriarchal religions and advocates for a shift towards feminine systems of governance as part of an effort to avert global ecological disaster.\n\nOn February 23, 2015, Anohni announced through her Facebook and official site the name of her new album, HOPELESSNESS, although no release date was provided. The album is being mixed and is co-produced by Hudson Mohawke, Oneohtrix Point Never and herself. It would be released under the moniker ANOHNI. It was described as an \"electronic record with some sharp teeth\".\n\nIn June 2015, Antony and the Johnsons performed at Dark Mofo in Tasmania, Australia, as a benefit in support of the Martu people of Parnngurr in Western Australia in their fight to prevent a uranium mine from being developed near their community by Canadian multinational Cameco and Mitsubishi. Anohni appeared with Martu representatives at a press conference at the MCA in Sydney and on ABC's \"Q&A\" in further service of this cause.\n\nIn May 2016, HOPELESSNESS was released by Anohni on Secretly Canadian, Rough Trade, and Hostess.\n\n\nCurrent members include:\n\nPrevious members have included:\n\n\n"}

The series was loosely based on Hanna-Barbera's \"Super Friends\" animated series, then airing on Saturday mornings on ABC; but served as a reunion of sorts for the 1960s' \"Batman\" TV series, as it brings back together three of its stars reprising their respective roles. The specials were produced like standard variety shows of the time: on videotape and with a laugh track.\n\n\"Legends of the Superheroes\" starred Adam West and Burt Ward, reprising their roles as Batman and Robin. The show also had a large ensemble cast of other DC Comics superheroes that included Garrett Craig as Captain Marvel, Howard Murphy as the Green Lantern, Rod Haase as The Flash, Bill Nuckols as Hawkman, Barbara Joyce as The Huntress, Alfie Wise as The Atom and Danuta Wesley (credited as Danuta) as the Black Canary.\n\n\nNotable guest stars in the two specials included Frank Gorshin reprising his role as The Riddler from \"Batman\", Howard Morris as Doctor Sivana, Gabriel Dell as Mordru, Charlie Callas as Sinestro, Jeff Altman as the Weather Wizard, Ruth Buzzi as Aunt Minerva, June Gable as Rhoda Rooter, Pat Carroll as Hawkman's mother, Aleshia Brevard as Giganta, William Schallert playing the Scarlet Cyclone (more commonly referred to as \"Retired Man\") and Brad Sanders as \"Ghetto Man\". Ed McMahon played himself, hosting the celebrity super-hero roast.\n\nBoth specials preempted \"Project U.F.O.\"\n\nIn the first episode, the Justice League of America (Batman, Robin, Flash, Green Lantern, Hawkman, Captain Marvel, Huntress and Black Canary) unite at the Hall of Heroes to celebrate elderly retired superhero Scarlet Cyclone's birthday. The party is interrupted by the Legion of Doom (Riddler, Weather Wizard, Sinestro, Mordru, Doctor Sivana, Giganta and Solomon Grundy), who announce they have hidden a deadly bomb in a secret location, and the heroes must follow clues to find it. It's all, actually, a trap to make the heroes drink Mordru's de-powering potion, which succeeds, but the heroes face off the villains even so, disarm the bomb and recover their powers. Only after the whole battle is gone, and the heroes have proven victorious, does Scarlet Cyclone arrive to give his aid.\n\nThe second episode was a celebrity roast of the superheroes hosted by Ed McMahon. All of the major characters from the first episode return. New characters featured include Ghetto Man, an African-American superhero who performs a stand-up comedy routine; Aunt Minerva, the Captain Marvel villainess who seeks a sixth husband from among the male superheroes; Rhoda Rooter, an entertainment reporter who snags an exclusive interview with Giganta and the Atom (Alfie Wise) on their engagement to be married; and Esther Hol, Hawkman's mother.\n\nWarner Home Video's Warner Archive Collection released the specials on DVD on October 19, 2010.\n\nIn the \"\" episode \"Crisis: 22,300 Miles Above Earth!\", Joker, Penguin, Gorilla Grodd, Kite Man, Black Manta, Two-Face, Gentleman Ghost, Mr. Freeze, Riddler, Poison Ivy, Clock King, and Solomon Grundy roast (literally and figuratively) Batman with help from a kidnapped Jeff Ross.\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nFormerly known as Salinas, Rosario has an area of 5.6 square kilometers, making it the most densely populated city/municipality in Cavite at 16,473 per km. With the continuous expansion of Metro Manila, the municipality is now included in Manila conurbation which reaches Lipa, Batangas in its southernmost part. It is accessible by land and water transportation.\n\nThere are three religious versions for naming the town \"Rosario.\" These are:\n\nThe first version says, the image of the Madonna and the Child was found one day floating on the water by a group of kids playing along the seashore. They played with the image, using it as a toy and afterwards hid it in the bushes near the sea. Every time they came back, however, they would see the image already floating leisurely on the water, as if waiting for them. They thought it strange, but could not explain how the image got back to the water.\n\nNot long after their elders learned about the image and took it to an empty nipa shack. Thus began a public veneration of the Madonna and Child. The hut was transformed into a place of worship. News of miraculous happenings attributed to the image spread around. The religious fervor was so great and the people were moved by the image that they decided to adopt it as the patroness of the town and changed the name \"Salinas Marcella\" to \"Rosario\".\n\nThe different names given to the town are remembered. Marcella exists as one of the national roads of the town. Salinas is associated with the finest and famous smoked fish (Tinapang Salinas) produced by the townspeople.\n\nRosario was formerly called Tejero, which may have originated from the word \"tejer\" (Spanish to weave) because weaving fish nets was then the main occupation of the women. Rosario was also called Salinas derived from the word \"sal\" (Spanish salt) during the Philippine Revolution because salt-making was a prime industry of the town. The place was likewise called Marcella or Marcelles due to its proximity to the sea (“mar” in Spanish). Rosario was, finally, named in honor of their patroness Nuestra Señora Virgen del Santissimo Rosario, Reina de Caracol or (\"Our Lady of the Most Holy Rosary\").\n\nOn October 22, 1845, Spanish Governor General Narciso Claveria promulgated a Decree for the establishment of a new town comprising Salinas-Leiton and Tierra Alta of San Francisco de Malabon, what is now the city of Gen. Trias. On October 27, Don Juan Arlegui, Vicar-General of the Archdiocese of Manila informed the Politico-Military Governor of Cavite Don Miguel Roca, that he was designated by the Governor-General to look for a person of unquestionable integrity who will be entrusted with the money for the construction of the church building.\n\nOn November 3, 1845, presbyter Don Mamerto Quijano Ner, who was at that time one of the priests of the Curia of Manila, was appointed as the first parish priest and served until December 1866.\n\nThe Municipality of Rosario was originally a part of San Francisco de Malabon (now General Trias City). It became an independent municipality in 1846, one year after the founding of the Santissimo Rosario Parish. The second smallest town in Cavite Province, Rosario has now emerged into the \"biggest\" in terms of its land area nor its per capita income but because of the great transitions that occurred with the town's political, social, cultural and economic developments since 1845.\n\nRosario is south of Manila, and south-south-west of Cavite City. It occupies part of the north to north-western section of the province along the western coast of Luzon. It is flanked by Noveleta on the east, Manila Bay on the north, General Trias on the southeast and Tanza on the south-west.\n\nRosario has a land area of only 569 hectares, as based on previous data recorded. At present, the municipality has not yet conducted any cadastral survey of its juridical land territory. A total of twenty (20) barangays make up this lowland coastal town.\n\nRosario is politically subdivided into 20 barangays.\n\nIn the , the population of Rosario, Cavite, was people, with a density of .\n\nRosario’s potential labor force comprises 59.25% of the figure given above, with the majority engaged in fishing and trade activities. The growth rate is 3.63%.\n\nRoman Catholic is the prominent religion of Rosario. There are two Catholic churches. One is in Poblacion, the Church of The Most Holy Rosary Parish, and another one in Ligtong, The Church of San Isidro Labrador. Recently, Islam was introduced by the Maranao business people from Mindanao.The other religions in Rosario includes Iglesia ni Cristo and Born Again Christians.\n\nFishing is a major economic activity due to the abundant fishing grounds particularly in Barangays Wawa, Sapa Muzon and Ligtong. The Rosario Fish Port in Barangay Sapa is a major fishing port. Predominant cottage industries related to fishing include smoked fish (\"tinapa\") processing, fish drying (\"daing\"), fish paste (\"bagoong\") making, fish sauce (\"patis\") making and canning. Marine species caught within municipal fishing grounds include squid, mackerel, slipmouth, herring, goatfish, tuna, mullet, porgy, shrimp, barracuda, cavalla, snapper, catfish and roundscad.\n\nThe Fil-Oil Development and Management Corporation (FMDC) has begun developing of the Philippine National Oil Corporation property into a special economic zone, the Cavite Economic Zone, that will include an industrial estate, low-cost housing, and a new port facility. A proposed reclamation will increase the land area of Barangay Sapa II and III by .\n\nOn November 20, 2009, SM Prime Holdings, the largest mall-operator in the country, opened its 36th mall: SM City Rosario.\n\nThe following are the elected officials of the town elected last May 13, 2019 which serves until 2022:\n\nGobernadorcillos\n\nCapitan Presidents\n\nPresidente Municipal\n\nMunicipal Mayors\n\nJapanese sponsored Mayor\n\nLiberation Military Mayor\n\nAppointed by Pres.

French Polynesia was an overseas territory until the constitutional reform on 28 March 2003 created the overseas collectivities. Then, on 27 February 2004 a law was passed giving French Polynesia the particular designation of overseas country while recalling that it belongs to the category of overseas collectivities. However, the Constitutional Council of France ruled that this description was merely a designation and not a legal status, as that would have been unconstitutional.\n\nThe territory's new status meant a certain autonomy for French Polynesia in the Pacific region. This translated into the transfer of new areas of legal responsibility (civil law, commercial law, labour law) while protecting existing autonomy in the fields of health, development and\ntown planning and the environment. In addition, French Polynesia gained the power to oppose the application of laws voted by the French Parliament that do not respect these areas of responsibility. Furthermore, it established French Polynesian citizenship based on permanent residency - a requirement for the right to vote in regional elections. However, France maintains control over justice, security and public order, currency, defence, and foreign policy.\n\nNew Caledonia, which has the unique status of a \"sui generis\" collectivity, is also sometimes incorrectly referred to as an overseas country.

All creatures and things understand and, to a degree, can speak the Speech intuitively, but specifically, it is the wizards who use it as their primary language and means of performing their works of magic. It is incredibly detailed and describes things that other languages cannot. Describing something inaccurately in the Speech may result in catastrophic effects (including changing the nature of the thing or being therein misdescribed); therefore, wizards are advised to never curse or lie in the Speech. Spells are described in the Speech; the wizard tells the object/subject what he/she wants to happen to it. With a final word, the spell can be let loose to do what it was supposed to do.\n\nThe written characters of \"The Speech\" are described in several of the books as resembling Arabic, and in Deep Wizardry, Nita's father mistakes the writing on the title page of Nita's Manual for Arabic letters.\n\nOther examples:\n\n\n"}

It was written by Katie Palmer and directed by series producer James Burrows. The episode originally aired on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) in the United States on April 8, 1999. Actors Molly Shannon, Leigh-Allyn Baker, and Tom Gallop guest starred on \"Grace, Replaced\".\n\nIn the episode, Grace's (Debra Messing) job forces her to work overtime, which leads to Will (Eric McCormack) feeling neglected. As a result, he seeks solace in the company of a new neighbor, Val (Shannon). Meanwhile, Jack (Sean Hayes) is annoyed that he has to perform community service for assaulting a meter maid.\n\nBefore the airing, NBC moved the program to Thursdays at 8:30 p.m., after it was a success in the Tuesday lineup. \"Grace, Replaced\" was the first episode to debut on the Thursday slot. Since then, the episode has generally received positive reviews from television critics. According to the Nielsen ratings system, it was watched by 12.9 million viewers, which resulted in the episode attracting its highest ratings of the season.\n\nWill (Eric McCormack) feels neglected by his best friend, Grace (Debra Messing), as she spends a lot of time with her work. When Will calls Grace to confirm for a lunch date, Grace cannot go as she is too busy creating interior designs. Later, while doing his laundry, Will meets his new upstairs neighbor, Val (Molly Shannon). Immediately, the two take a liking to one another. The next day, Will visits Grace at work and introduces Val to her. After the two leave, Karen (Megan Mullally)—Grace's friend and socialite assistant—tells Grace that she did not like the way Will and Val acted towards one another. Grace, however, refuses to accept what Karen implies.\n\nMeanwhile, after slapping a meter maid, Jack (Sean Hayes) is ordered to work 40 hours of community service, picking up garbage, and while he does this is forced to wear an orange jumpsuit. While doing community service he visits Karen at Grace Adler Designs. While there, Jack goes through a trash bag and sees Soon-Yi Allen's phone bill. Jack shows Karen the bill which quickly results in the two prank calling Soon-Yi.\n\nAt Will and Grace's apartment, Will and Val play \"Pyramid\" against Will's friends Ellen (Leigh-Allyn Baker) and Rob (Tom Gallop). Grace, who comes home, is shocked when her \"Pyramid\" record with Will—2 minutes and 14 seconds—is the same as Will and Val's. Before leaving, Grace is horrified that Will called her Val. While at her office, Grace learns that Will is sick. She goes home to attend to him and is surprised to see Val there. Grace tells her that since she is home that Val can go. Val, however, does not leave. This results in the two fighting. The fight, however, is broken by Will and tells them to work the situation out. Grace admits she felt jealous of Val as she believed Val had replaced her, due to her not being there for Will. Will, however, reassures Grace that no one can replace her as his best friend. As a result, Grace and Val make up.\n\n\"Grace, Replaced\" was written by Katie Palmer and directed by series producer James Burrows. This was Palmer's first written episode, and was Burrows' 18th directed episode. It originally aired on NBC in the United States on April 8, 1999. Before the airing of the episode, it was confirmed that actress Molly Shannon would guest star as Val, a new neighbor in Will and Grace's apartment building. This episode would be Shannon's first appearance on the show, with her later guest starring in the episodes \"Girls, Interrupted\", \"Last of the Really Odd Lovers\", \"Fagel Attraction\", and \"One Gay at a Time\".\n\n\"Grace, Replaced\" brought in 12.9 million American viewers upon its original broadcast in the United States, and making it the seventh highest-rated show during the week of April 5–11, 1999. Originally, \"Will & Grace\" aired on Mondays, but due to insufficient viewership, NBC decided to move the program to Tuesdays at 9:30 p.m., which was a success as viewers tuned in. The network then changed the time slot from Tuesdays to Thursdays at 8:30 p.m., between \"Friends\" and \"Frasier\", with this episode becoming a success as it attracted its highest audience ratings of the season. The previous episode, \"Secrets and Lays\", was watched by 9.6 million viewers. Many believed this decision was a good one, with a contributor of \"The Buffalo News\" commenting that the time slot change suggested that NBC felt that \"Will & Grace\" had a better chance of becoming a success than the current sitcom \"Jesse\". In a report in \"The Star-Ledger\" it said that the decision of \"Will & Grace\" airing on Thursdays was a good benefit on behalf of NBC as the program was \"the only watchable comedy\".\n\nThe episode received generally positive reception. Alan Sepinwall and Matt Zoller Seitz of \"The Star-Ledger\" were complimentary towards \"Grace, Replaced\", writing that the episode \"is a winner, packed with witty dialogue.\" Monica Collins of the \"Boston Herald\" said that the episode \"is one of the best of the series so far\". \"The Dallas Morning News\" writer Ed Bark noted that \"Grace, Replaced\" was \"another energetic, generally amusing\" episode. Bark, in regards to Jack and Karen, said that the two together \"sometimes are almost more than the scenery can bear.\" Aaron Barnhart for \"The Kansas City Star\" called the episode riotous, and said that the show \"with [its] pop-culture jokes delivered at blistering speed, outsized performances from 'supporting' players Sean Hayes and Megan Mullally, and a camaraderie between platonic pals Eric McCormack and Debra Massing that would make even Plato blush.\" Ted Cox of the \"Daily Herald\" was less positive about the episode, reporting that this episode \"looked like more of the same\", recounting the show's past story lines, and past NBC programs. \"Chicago Tribune\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Steve Johnson opined that the episode \"starts strong and then goes awry [...] It's funny for a while [...] But then it takes it to a ludicrous level, selling out its own internal logic by conspiring to put [Molly] Shannon and Messing into a ... catfight. At its best this series works a groove of pop-culture savvy; this visit from \"The Three Stooges\" by way of \"Dynasty\" will have you rolling your eyes in dismay.\"\n\nCritics praised Shannon's performance in the episode. Bark wrote, \"...the talented Ms. Shannon is winningly glossy and brassy [in this episode]. Someday soon she'll have her own sitcom. Bet on it.\" Tom Feran of \"The Plain Dealer\" reported that Shannon's appearance on the show would make \"a good introduction for viewers curious about \"Will & Grace\".\" \"The Boston Globe\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Matthew Gilbert enjoyed the actress in \"Grace, Replaced\", writing that she is appealing as the Grace replacement.\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nCarmona was just a part of the big town of Silang. This is not surprising because in the early part of the Spanish regime Silang included what today are known as the municipalities of Indang: San Francisco de Malabon (now General Trias), and Maragondon. Moreover, Alfonso, Amadeo, and Mendez were mere sitios of Indang; Santa Cruz de Malabon (now Tanza) was a part of San Francisco de Malabon or Malabon Grande; and Magallanes and Ternate were barrios of Maragondon. Furthermore, Maragondon itself had been a part of the Corregimiento of Mariveles on the opposite side of Manila Bay.\n\nAccording to research conducted in 1982, by Sangguniang Bayan members Ernesto Zamora, Salvador P. Manahan, Pio Purificacion, Narciso Levardo, and Romy Laurito, assisted by Municipal Secretary Rogelio D. Paular, it was found out that the history of Carmona began during the 15th century. As related by a reliable informant, three brothers coming from the mountain of Silang were said to be the first settlers in the place which was then called “Latag”, a Tagalog word for “plain” due to the numerous hills and plains in the area. The settlement was not known to other residents of Silang until some of them also went down to the place, cleared some forest areas and established their residence.\n\nIn 1595, Silang became a town and Latag was annexed as a part since then. Latag gradually developed into a community whose residents struggled hard to make it a town. Their burning desires were filled with hopes and fulfillment in 1856 when their move for the conversion of Latag into a town was spearheaded by a leader named Tiburcio Purificacion. Finally, by virtue of a decree issued on February 20, 1857 by the King of Spain through Governor General Fernando de Norzagaray, Latag became a separate municipality with the name it bears today: Carmona, named after the town of Carmona in the province of Seville, Spain. Yet until now, it had not been known where the name originated.\n\nDuring the Philippine Revolution in 1896, the gobernadorcillo of Carmona was Kapitan Damian Ermitano after the administrations of Tiburcio Purificacion, Mariano Mapanoo and Donald C. Virtucio, Augusto Manaog and Fabian Tenedero.\n\nAfter the revolution and the occupation of the country by the Americans in 1901, the first local executive of Carmona was Martin Reyes who was followed next by Marcelo Reyes, Prudencio Torres, Juan Alumia, Estanislao Paular, Marciano Mapanoo, and Juan Zamora.\n\nThe mayors who assumed office after World War II were the following honorable men: Bernardo Hebron, Eulalio Reyes and Cesar Casal and Felino L. Maquinay. In 1959, the district of San Gabriel and San Jose of Barangay Kabilang Baybay was purchased by the National Government for the relocation of squatters from Metro Manila. On March 14, 1981, the relocation site, which teemed with people from almost every part of the country and was more popularly known as the resettlement area, became an independent municipality called General Mariano Alvarez.\n\n\n\nCarmona is located on the south-eastern part of the province of Cavite, approximately south of Manila and from Trece Martires City, Cavite's seat of government. It is bounded on the north, east and south by the City of Biñan, Laguna, Municipality of General Mariano Alvarez (GMA) on the north-west and Silang on the south-west. The geographic coordinates of Carmona are about 14.32° latitude and 121.06° longitude.\n\nThe topography of Carmona is generally flat to strongly rolling or sloping, partly lowland and partly hill. Carmona is divided into four physiographical areas: the lowest lowland area, the lowland area, the central hilly area and the upland mountainous area.\n\nThe town is also within the path of a fault line, the Valley Fault System which starts from the Sierra Madre mountains.\n\nWith a total land area of 29,749,874 square meters, Carmona represented 2.17% of the total land area of the province. These areas are currently occupied by 14 barangays of which 7 are considered Poblacion barangays and 7 others are regular barangays. Barangay Lantic is the largest area while Barangay 2 has the smallest area.\n\nCarmona has a Type I climate characterized by two pronounced seasons: dry from November to April and wet during rest of the year. Maximum rainfall usually occurs from June to September. The average annual rainfall is 200 millimeters with a peak of 400 millimeters in August.\n\nThe average annual temperature is 27.2 C. The highest temperature occurs during the month of May while the lowest occurs during the month of January.\n\nThe predominant wind direction comes from the south-west during the month of June to September and from the north-west during the month of October to January, while from February to April, the wind is coming from the southeast, predominantly in the month of May.\n\nThe average humidity of Carmona is 81%. This makes the municipality cooler than the Metropolitan Manila Area where the average humidity is higher.\n\nThe eastern side of Cavite consists of Carmona clay loam with streaks of Carmona clay loam steep phase and Carmona sandy clay loam. This type of soil is granular with tuffaceous material and concretions. It is hard and compact when dry, sticky and plastic when wet. This type of soil is planted with rice with irrigation or sugarcane without irrigation. Fruit trees such as mango, avocado and citrus are also grown in this type of soil.\n\nCavite coastal areas have marl and conglomerate sedimentary rocks and some igneous rocks which are prominent in the high, mountainous regions of the western part of the province. Carmona reserves and deposits of sand, clay and gravel materials are found in Sitio Ulong Tubig, Mabuhay.\n\nCarmona is politically subdivided into 14 barangays. Eight of the current barangays are classified as poblacion barangays and the six others are ordinary barangays or barrios.\n\n\nIn the , the population of Carmona, Cavite, was people, with a density of .\n\nIn the 2010 census, Carmona had a total population of 74,986 which represented a total number of households at 14,885.\n\nThe highest densities are found in the Poblacion area (Barangays 1–8) and Barangays Milagrosa and Maduya, where land areas are significantly lower than the other barangays. Barangay Lantic posted development of the Kuok Property within the Lantic area; it is expected that the density will increase within the ten-year period.\n\nCarmona's population is concentrated in Barangays 1–8 at the Poblacion area. Barangay Milagrosa is the most populated barangay, which posted a total population of 15,284. Dense population is also found in Barangay 9, the central business district of the municipality. Most population catalysts such as banks, town center, and commercial establishments are found in the Poblacion area.\n\nThe main language spoken is Tagalog. In some areas they speak Chabacano or Chavacano, sometimes referred to by linguists as Philippine Creole Spanish, a Spanish-based creole language spoken in the Philippines. English is considered as the second language and is widely used as medium of communication in business and higher education. Other Philippine languages spoken are Waray, Bicolano, Cebuano, Ilokano, Pangasinense, and Hiligaynon. Chinese and Spanish are also spoken by some local residents.\n\nThe majority of inhabitants are composed of Roman Catholics, Protestants and other non-denominational groups.\n\nCottage industries include metal works, metalcraft, footwear industries, concrete products, tricycle assembly, rattan handicrafts and bakeries. Manufacturing firms engaged in handicraft (bags and shoes), furniture making, business retailing, personal and business services, and food based enterprises contribute to the municipality's trade and commerce. Mercantile activities in the municipality are concentrated at the Poblacion area and along Governor's Drive. Carmona has been classified as a first class municipality since July 1996, brought about by industrialization, real estate development and commercial activities.\n\nCarmona's progress accelerated after the conversion of more than fifty hectares of farmlands into industrial areas in 1998. Garment industries, steel fabrication, microchips and semi-conductors, tool fabrication, bus assembly, bulb factories, die casting and other small and medium-scale industries currently operate in the municipality. These investments continue to provide local employment, generate export earnings, increase municipal revenues and serve as vehicles for technology transfer. Foreign investments are pouring in as export-oriented industries continue to flourish.\n\nEmployment rate: Out of a potential labor force of 24,918 (members 15 years old & above who are actively seeking for work), 98.03% are employed while 1.97% are unemployed. The presence of 8 industrial estates & 2 industrial compounds contribute largely to the high employment rate of the municipality.\n\nThe economy of Carmona is generally agricultural. Almost half of its total land area is devoted to agriculture.\n\nIn 2000, the total land area devoted to agriculture was 609 or roughly 19.60% of the total land area of Carmona, which is 3,902 hectares. 230 hectares are irrigated areas all of which are currently planted with rice and vegetables, 30 hectares are upland rice areas, 122.5 hectares are for diversified trees and crops, and the other 211.5 hectares are considered pasture land.\n\nThere are 217 farmers in the Municipality engaged in planting and farming. Crops and livestock farmers are distributed among 14 barangays of Carmona.\n\nHowever, with the implementation of the CALABARZON growth area, the municipality of Carmona has slowly become an industrial enclave in the province. The advent of industrialization has threatened the agricultural base of Carmona. As of April 1999, land used for rice production has gone down; sugarcane plantation has decreased considerably and those land uses for other crops and vegetables totaled 84.5 hectares during the same year.\n\nAt present, the programs and services of the Department of Agriculture (DA) are focused on five priority programs: a sustained self-sufficiency program for rice and corn, strengthening of production market linkage, an acceleration of livelihood program, aggressive assistance to organizational development of farmers, and assistance to agriculture-related priority programs of other government agencies.\n\n\n\n\nIndustrialization in the '90s accounts for the rapid growth of Carmona's business community from an otherwise quaint agricultural town in the 1950s. Brought about by huge capital from the national government, the industrial complexes bolstered the increase of the municipality's revenues and the change in the people's lifestyle.\n\nThere are eight existing industrial complexes in the towns. Its proximity to Manila and at the same time being the gateway to the Calabarzon area made Carmona a promising venue for business.\n\nOn the other hand, the local government has been very supportive of the investors. There are 114 factories in eight industrial parks/complexes to date. At present there are the eight industrial complexes strewn along the Governor's Drive, in a total of 419.31 hectares, making up 13.56% of the town's land area. Ranging from 9 to 100 hectares, these industrial estates are complete with amenities, secured, and in close coordination with the municipal government through the Carmona Business Club and other agencies.\n\nOne of the biggest commercial subdivisions in town is the Macaria Business Park in Barangay Mabuhay which houses Waltermart in its 13.13 hectare lot. Recently, fastfood chains and restaurants have been opened to compete for regular patronage at the Paseo de Carmona in Barangay Maduya.\n\nMoreover, numerous traders and retailers are housed in the bustling Carmona Public Market.\n\nThe bulk of commercial activities come from wholesale/retail enterprises, which comprise a total of 619 establishments. There are also service-related establishments: businesses, food shops and amusement operators, with 35 banks and other lending institutions. Among the major banking institutions that cater to the financial needs of businesses in Carmona and neighboring towns are Bank of Philippine Islands (BPI), Metrobank, Banco de Oro (BDO), Chinatrust Bank, China Bank, RCBC, and Union Bank.\n\nThe Pagamutang Bayan ng Carmona ( and the Rural Health Unit (RHU) are government-owned and run healthcare facilities in the town.\n\nThe main health center in the municipality is located in Barangay 4. A total of eleven barangay health centers or substations of the RHU are established in different barangays.\n\nIn addition to the rural health units and the Pagamutang Bayan, there are also eleven private clinics operating in the municipality. Eleven clinics are privately owned and one clinic is under the supervision of government health workers.\n\nThe education sector in Carmona improved in many aspects of endeavor. In line with the local government's thrust of enhancing quality education, the Department of Education (DepEd), particularly the District of Carmona and Carmona National High School, with the full support of the local government unit, implemented various programs and projects that intensified the education sector in achieving its goals.\n\nAs early as 1995, various programs for the improvement of quality education started with a vision of producing competitive students from both the elementary and secondary levels. Carmona posted a literacy rate of 89%. The local government started with the computerization of all schools. Each public school was given computer units and students were provided with computer lessons. This is in consonance with the belief that modern technology and equipment are considered factors in enhancing better education. To address the increasing number of enrollees and students, the LGU conceptualized the construction of 2-story buildings in different schools in Carmona.\n\nAt present, the municipality has a substantial number of classrooms and teachers to meet the learning needs of the school age population. As of School Year 2005–2006, the municipality has 50 educational institutions, 28 of which are public schools while 17 are privately run. The public schools are categorized into 18 pre-schools, 9 elementary, 1 secondary, and 1 tertiary school. The private educational institutions are composed of 10 pre-schools, 7 elementary, 3 secondary/high school, and a computer college.\n\n"}
{"id": "2016341", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2016341", "title": "Massy, Essonne", "text": "Massy, Essonne\n\nMassy is a commune in the southern suburbs of Paris, France. It is located 14.7 kilometres (9.1 mi) from the center of Paris.\n\nMassy underwent rapid development within a short period of time, transforming from a large borough of 6,000 inhabitants in 1950 to a town exceeding 37,000 inhabitants in 1968. Since then, its population of around 40,000 has remained relatively stable. Its population is now going to grow again because of new constructions.\n\nThe inhabitants of Massy are known as \"Massicois\".\n\nMassy is served by two interchange stations on Paris RER line B and RER line C: Massy – Verrières and Massy – Palaiseau.\n\nThere is also a TGV station, called Massy TGV, which is adjacent to Massy – Palaiseau station and is one of only three specially-built TGV stations in the suburbs of Paris (the two others are at Disneyland Resort Paris and at Charles de Gaulle Airport).\n\nThe etymological origin of Massy is still very dubious. This name could result from the name of an owner of a villa of the Gallo-Roman time, original site of the village. Called Matius or Matheus, the name of his property then village would have been subjected to deformations due to language and the passing of time to become Massy. Located near the road between Paris and Chartres, the villa was undoubtedly built on a height (the Gaudon Mount) and formed the starting point of a human establishment. The argillaceous subsoil explains the formation of a clearing within the forest and the numerous stretches of water in the surrounding area.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages and until the end of the \"Ancien Régime\", the lordly estates divided up the territory of the current commune, assigning a majority part to the ecclesiastical institutions and in particular the abbey of St-Germain-des-Prés. In the 10th century, the line of the lords of Massy was established; their title of nobility was to become a barony (nowadays the Grimaldi-Monaco family).\n\nBefore 1900, the history of the city was similar to that of the rural boroughs of Île-de-France. After the Revolution, the town remained rural. The population followed an evolution identical to that of the rest of the region. It underwent the same wars, epidemics and rebellions. The Massicois practiced mainly agricultural trades (gardeners, vine growers), even if local arts and crafts were always present. The tile factory, abandoned after the Second World War, was the town's oldest industry.\n\nIt is with the beginning of the 20th century that the face of Massy changes: from being a rural village, it transforms into a town increasing subjected to the attraction of Paris. Once with a population of just 1,400 people, nowadays, the town of Massy holds almost 40,000 inhabitants. At the end of the 19th century, the development of railways supported the construction of industries. The first allotments were born at the beginning of the century. The city's urbanisation developed towards the districts of the Gravels and Villaine, where it was necessary to establish a school as early as 1927. It is the era of the “suburban house”.\n\nDuring the Second World War, the marshalling yard of Massy-Palaiseau was considered a strategic rail junction. The bombardments of these infrastructures caused 88 victims and material damage throughout the town. In the post-war period, the reconstruction and development of the parisian agglomeration and its suburbs metamorphosed the town's geography. The housing crisis provoked an outrage, thus the \"castor\" movement established some residences in the east of the city. The establishment of a housing scheme on 145 hectares of the communes of Massy-Antony caused the population of Massy to double. The creation of a 'Priority Construction Zone' in Villaine 10 years later was intended to even out the town's urbanisation. This abrupt development of the town also modified its social structure: rejuvenation of the population, arrival of foreigners, etc. During the 1960s and 1970s, questions are raised about rapid urban development: housing problems and shantytowns, lack of public resources, requalification of certain factory sites, delinquency, etc. To satisfy the needs for this new population, many new infrastructures were created such as schools, hospitals, sports centres, swimming pools, arts centres, nurseries and parks. The establishment of a TGV station in 1991 is an asset for the economic development of the city. Nowadays, certain amenities have an influence which exceeds the communal and departmental circles, in particular opera and theatre. (Author: Municipal archives of Massy).\n\nMassy is divided into two cantons:\n\nThe canton of Massy-Est contains 18,316 inhabitants;\nThe canton of Massy-Ouest contains 19,396 inhabitants.\n\nMassy has professional sports team in Rugby (Rugby Club Massy Essonne, playing Federal 1, third level of Rugby in France) and Handball (Massy Essonne HandBall, playin ProLigue, second level of Handball in France).\nMassy has one association football team in FC Massy 91.\nMassy also has major sports associations in climbing and swimming.\n\n\n\n\nOn 1 July 2010 Alstom inaugurated the new head office of its Energy Management Business (EMB) division in Massy.

She then ruled with her sons Ptolemy IX and Ptolemy X from 116 to 101 BC.\n\nCleopatra III was also known as Cleopatra Euergetis while associated with her husband Ptolemy VIII or her son Ptolemy X. She is attested as Cleopatra Philometor Soteira while associated with her eldest son Ptolemy IX. According to Strabo, she was sometimes known as Kokke when discussed in relation to her son Ptolemy X.\n\nCleopatra III's uncle Ptolemy VIII ruled together with her parents from ca 170 BC to 164 BC, at which point he expelled Cleopatra II and Ptolemy VI. However, he was soon forced to abdicate in 163 BC. \n\nCleopatra III's parents retook the throne and remained in power for almost 20 years until 145 BC. Cleopatra III was born between 160 and 155 BC. She was a sister to Ptolemy Eupator, Cleopatra Thea, Ptolemy VII Neos Philopator, and possibly Berenice.\n\nPtolemy VI died in 145 BC from injuries sustained when falling from his horse during the battle of Oinoparas against Alexander Balas.

After 6 years of joint rule Ptolemy X had his mother Cleopatra III murdered in 101 BC. Cleopatra III was succeeded by Ptolemy X, possibly in joint rule with his wife Berenice III, who was Cleopatra III's granddaughter.\n\nCleopatra III and Ptolemy VIII married in 142 or 141 BC and had five children:\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nAlfonso was totally forested until the 17th century when a few pocket settlements sprouted. The town was originally part of Barrio Lumampong in the town of Indang. In the course of time, the pocket settlements grew into sitios and later on into barrios. The town became a separate district municipality from Indang on 16 March 1859 through the efforts of the community leaders Bonifacio Aveo and Felix del Mundo. The new town was called \"Alas-as\" for a period of seventeen years. The name refers to the name of a tree used for the construction of houses and bears sweet fruit. It was, eventually, named after King Alfonso XII of Spain, son of Isabella II. Alfonso was initially composed of the barrios of Taywanak, Pajo, Esperanza, Marahan, Matagbak, Sinaliw and Kaytitinga. Don Narciso Mojica was the \"capitan municipal\" of Alfonso at the outbreak of the Philippine Revolution. A few days after the Cry of Balintawak, on 31 August 1896, General Mariano Trias ordered the liquidation of all Spaniards in the municipality. In the bloody battle that followed, the leaders of the revolutionists were General Hipolito Rint, Captain Eriberto Cetro (Kapitan Berto) and Predencio Rolle (Tandang Doro).\n\nAlfonso is an upland town situated at the south-western portion of the Cavite province.

{"id": "2016347", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2016347", "title": "Workweek and weekend", "text": "Workweek and weekend\n\nThe workweek and weekend are the complementary parts of the week devoted to labor and rest, respectively. The legal working week (British English), or workweek (American English), is the part of the seven-day week devoted to labor. In most of the world, the workweek is from Monday to Friday and the weekend is Saturday and Sunday, but other divisions exist: for example, many countries observe a Sunday to Thursday or even Monday to Thursday working week. A weekday or workday is any day of the working week. Other institutions often follow this pattern, such as places of education. Sometimes the term \"weekend\" is expanded to include the time after work hours on the last workday of the week; e.g. Friday evening is often referred to as the start of the weekend. The weekend has had varying definitions, such as commencing after 5 pm on Friday evening and lasting until 6 pm on Sunday night.\n\nIn some Christian traditions, Sunday is the \"day of rest and worship\". The Jewish \"Shabbat\" or Biblical Sabbath lasts from sunset on Friday to the fall of full darkness on Saturday; as a result, the weekend in Israel is observed on Friday–Saturday. Some Muslim-majority countries have historically instituted a Thursday–Friday weekend. Today, many of these countries have shifted from Thursday–Friday to Friday–Saturday, or mostly to Saturday–Sunday.\n\nThe Christian Sabbath is just one day each week, but the preceding day (the Jewish Sabbath) came to be taken as a holiday as well in the 20th century. This shift has been accompanied by a reduction in the total number of hours worked per week, associated with increases in levels of GDP per capita. The present-day concept of the \"weekend\" first arose in the industrial north of Britain in the early 19th century. The Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America Union was the first to successfully demand a five-day work week in 1929.\n\nSome countries have adopted a one-day weekend, i.e. either Sunday only (in seven countries), Friday only (in Djibouti, Iran, Palestine and Somalia), or Saturday only (in Nepal). However, most countries have adopted a two-day weekend, whose days differ according to religious tradition, i.e. either Friday and Saturday, or Saturday and Sunday, or Friday and Sunday (in Brunei Darussalam), with the previous evening post-work often considered part of the weekend. Proposals continue to be put forward to reduce the number of days or hours worked per week, on the basis of predicted social and economic benefits.\n\nA continuous seven-day cycle that runs throughout history, paying no attention whatsoever to the phases of the moon and having a fixed day of rest, was most likely first practiced in Judaism, dated to the 6th century BC at the latest.\n\nIn Ancient Rome, every eight days there was a nundinae. It was a market day, during which children were exempted from school and agricultural workers stopped work in the field and came to the city to sell the produce of their labor or to practice religious rites.\n\nThe French Revolutionary Calendar had ten-day weeks (called \"décades\") and allowed \"décadi\", one out of the ten days, as a leisure day.\n\nIn cultures with a four-day week, the three Sabbaths derive from the culture's main religious tradition: Friday (Muslim), Saturday (Jewish, Adventist), and Sunday (Christian).\n\nThe present-day concept of the relatively longer 'week-end' first arose in the industrial north of Britain in the early 19th century and was originally a voluntary arrangement between factory owners and workers allowing Saturday afternoon off from 2 pm on the basis that staff would be available for work sober and refreshed on Monday morning. The Oxford English Dictionary traces the first use of the term \"weekend\" to the British magazine \"Notes and Queries\" in 1879.\n\nIn 1908, the first five-day workweek in the United States was instituted by a New England cotton mill so that Jewish workers would not have to work on the Sabbath from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday. In 1926, Henry Ford began shutting down his automotive factories for all of Saturday and Sunday. In 1929, the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America Union was the first union to demand and receive a five-day workweek. The rest of the United States slowly followed, but it was not until 1940, when a provision of the 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act mandating a maximum 40-hour workweek went into effect, that the two-day weekend was adopted nationwide.\n\nOver the succeeding decades, particularly in the 1940s to 1960s, an increasing number of countries adopted either a Friday–Saturday or a Saturday–Sunday weekend to harmonize with international markets. A series of workweek reforms in the mid-to-late 2000s and early 2010s brought much of the Arab World in synchronization with the majority of countries around the world, in terms of working hours, the length of the workweek, and the days of the weekend. The International Labour Organization (ILO) currently defines a workweek exceeding 48 hours as excessive. A 2007 study by the ILO found that at least 614.2 million people around the world were working excessive hours.\n\nActual workweek lengths have been falling in the developed world. Reductions in the length of the workweek are associated with the trend of increases in real per-capita income. In the United States, the workweek length reduced slowly from before the Civil War to the start of the 20th century. There was a rapid reduction between 1900 and 1920, especially between 1913 and 1919, when weekly hours fell by about eight percent. In 1926, Henry Ford standardized on a five-day workweek, instead of the prevalent six days, without reducing employees' pay. Hours worked stabilized at about 49 per week during the 1920s, and during the Great Depression fell below 40. During the Depression, President Herbert Hoover called for a reduction in work hours in lieu of layoffs. Later, President Franklin Roosevelt signed the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, which established a five-day, 40-hour workweek for many workers. The proportion of people working very long weeks has since risen, and the full-time employment of women has increased dramatically.\n\nThe New Economics Foundation has recommended moving to a 21-hour standard workweek to address problems with unemployment, high carbon emissions, low well-being, entrenched inequalities, overworking, family care, and the general lack of free time. The Center for Economic and Policy Research states that reducing the length of the work week would slow climate change and have other environmental benefits.\n\nIn South Africa the working week traditionally was Monday to Friday with a half-day on Saturday and Sunday a public holiday. However, since 2013 there have been changes to the working week concept based on more than one variation. The week can be 5 days of work, or more. The maximum number of hours someone can work in a week remains 45.\n\nAs a general rule, Brazil adopts a 44-hour working week, which typically begins on Monday and ends on Friday, with a Saturday-Sunday weekend. Brazilian Law, however, also allows for shorter Monday-to-Friday working hours so employees can work on Saturdays or Sundays, as long as the weekly 44-hour limit is respected and the employee gets at least one weekend day. This is usually the case for malls, supermarkets and shops. The law also grants labor unions the right to negotiate different work weeks, within certain limits, which then become binding for that union's labor category. Overtime is allowed, limited to two extra hours a day, with an increase in pay.\n\nThe working week in Chile averages 45 hours, most often worked on a Monday-Friday schedule, but is not uncommon to work on Saturdays. Retail businesses mostly operate Monday through Saturday, with larger establishments being open seven days a week.\n\nIn general, Colombia has a 48-hour working week. Depending on the business, people work five days for max 8 hours per day, typically Monday to Friday, or six days for eight hours a day, Monday to Saturday.\nMexico has a 48-hour work week (8 hours × 6 days), it is a custom in most industries and trades to work half day on Saturday. Most public employees work Monday to Friday as well in some office companies. Shops and retailers open on Saturday and Sunday in most large cities.\nThe standard working week in the United States begins on Monday and ends on Friday, 40 hours per week, with Saturday and Sunday being weekend days. However, in practice, only 42% of employees work 40-hour weeks. The average workweek for full-time employees is 47 hours. Most stores are open for business on Saturday and often on Sunday as well, except in a few places where prohibited by law (see Blue law). Increasingly, employers are offering compressed work schedules to employees. Some government and corporate employees now work a 9/80 work schedule (80 hours over 9 days during a two-week period)—commonly 9 hour days Monday to Thursday, 8 hours on one Friday, and off the following Friday. There are also some government or corporate employees that work a 10/40 schedule–40 hours per week over 4 days, usually with Fridays off. Jobs in healthcare, law enforcement, transportation, retail, and other service positions commonly require employees to work on the weekend or to do shift work.\n\nIn Australia the working week begins on Monday and terminates on Friday. An eight-hour working day is the norm. Working three weekdays a fortnight, for example, would therefore be approximately twenty-four hours (including or excluding traditional breaks tallying up to two hours). Some people work overtime with extra pay on offer for those that do, especially for weekend work. Shops open seven days a week in most states with opening hours from 9am to 5.30pm on weekdays, with some states having two \"late night trading\" nights on Thursday and Friday, when trading ceases at 9pm. Many supermarkets and low end department stores remain open until midnight and some trade 24/7. Restaurants and cinemas can open at all hours, save for some public holidays. Bars generally trade seven days a week but there are local municipal restrictions concerning trading hours. Banks trade on Monday to Friday, with some branches opening on Saturdays (and in some cases Sundays) in high demand areas. The Post Office (Australia Post) trades Monday to Friday as per retail shops but some retail post offices may trade on Saturdays and Sundays in some shopping centres. A notable exception to the above is South Australia whereby retail establishments are restricted to trading between the hours of 11am-5pm on Sundays.\nIn China, there is a five-day Monday-Friday working week, prior to which work on Saturday was standard. China began the two-day Saturday–Sunday weekend on May 1, 1995. Most government employees work 5 days a week (including officials and industrial management). Most manufacturing facilities operate on Saturdays as well. However, most shops, museums, cinemas and commercial establishments open on Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. Banks are also open throughout the weekend and on most public holidays.\n\nDuring the period of public holidays, swapped holidays are common between the actual holiday and weekend, so three-day or seven-day holiday periods are created. The nearby Saturday or Sunday may be changed to a normal working day. For example, on a three-day holiday period, if the actual holiday falls on a Tuesday, Monday will be swapped as a holiday, and citizens are required to work on the previous Saturday.\n\nA number of provinces and municipalities across China, including Hebei, Jiangxi and Chongqing, have issued new policies, calling on companies to create 2.5-day weekends. Under the plan, government institutions, state-owned companies, joint-ventures and privately held companies are to be given incentives to allow their workers to take off at noon on Friday before coming back to the office on Monday.\n\nIn Hong Kong, a typical working week for local enterprises begins on 9am on Monday and ends at 1pm on Saturday, although most employees have alternate Saturdays off. After the introduction of the five-day working week for the majority of government departments in 2006, most multinational enterprises and large local companies followed suit, extended the working day from 9am to 5pm so as to adopt a five-day work week. Despite the aforementioned official hours, and many companies has still work overtime, and in the case of the financial industry were in particular, working 12-hour days on a chronic basis is still not uncommon.\n\nMost commercial establishments in the retail sector such as restaurants, shops and cinemas, as well as public venues such as museums and libraries are open on Saturdays, Sundays and most public holidays. For schools, lessons are not normally held on Saturdays, but students may be required to go school on Saturdays for extra-curricular activities or make-up classes.\n\nThe standard working week in India 1923 for most office jobs begins on Monday and ends on Saturday. The work schedule is 60 hours per week, Sunday being a rest day. However, most government offices and the software industry follow a five-day workweek. All major industries along with services like transport, hospitality, healthcare etc. work in shifts.\n\nCentral government offices follow a five-day week. State governments follow half-day working on the first and third Saturdays of each month and rest on the second and fourth Saturdays, except West Bengal, Rajasthan, Bihar, Punjab, Delhi, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra government which follows a Monday–Friday workweek. There is usually no half working day in the private sector, and people work in two or three shifts of 8 hours each.\n\nThe standard working week in Iran begins on Saturday and ends on Wednesday. However, most stores are open for business on Thursday and often on Friday as well.\n\nIn Israel, the standard workweek is 42 hours as prescribed by law. The typical workweek is five days, Sunday to Thursday, with 8.4 hours a day as the standard, with anything beyond that considered overtime. A minority of jobs operate on a partial six-day Sunday-Friday workweek.\n\nThe standard business office working week in Japan begins on Monday and ends on Friday, 40 hours per week. This system became common between 1980 and 2000. Before then, most workers in Japan worked full-time from Monday to Friday and a half day on Saturday, 45–48 hours per week. Public schools and facilities (excluding city offices) are generally open on Saturdays for half a day.\n\nThe working week is Monday to Friday; 8 hours per day, 40 hours in total per week. Some institutions, however, also work 4 hours on Saturdays . Large malls are open on Saturday and Sunday; many small shops close on Sunday.\n\nMongolia has a Monday to Friday working week, with a normal maximum time of 40 hours. Most shops are also open on weekends, many large retail chains having full opening hours even on Sunday. Private enterprises conduct business from 9:00 to 18:00, and government institutions may have full working hours.\nNepal follows the ancient Vedic calendar, which has the resting day on Saturday and the first day of the working week on Sunday. Schools in Nepal are off on Saturdays, so it is common for pupils to go to school from Sunday to Friday.\n\nIn November 2012, the home ministry proposed a two-day holiday per week plan for all government offices except at those providing essential services like electricity, water, and telecommunications. This proposal followed a previous proposal by the Nepali government, i.e. \"Load-shedding Reduction Work Plan 2069 BS\", for a five working day plan for government offices as part of efforts to address the problem of load-shedding. The proposal has been discussed in the Administration Committee; it is not yet clear whether the plan includes private offices and educational institutions.\n\nIn New Zealand the working week is typically Monday to Friday 8:30 to 17:00, but it is not uncommon for many industries (especially construction) to work a half day on Saturday, normally from 8:00 or 9:00 to about 13:00. Supermarkets, malls, independent retailers, and increasingly, banks, remain open seven days a week.\n\nIn the Philippines, Article 91 of the Labor Code requires one rest day for workers in a week; the choice of selecting the rest day is left to the employer, subject to collective bargaining. Most workers avail of Sunday as their mandated rest day. However, government offices, banks, and many non-service industry establishments maintain a five-day (Monday to Friday) work week.\nIn Singapore the common working week is 5-day work week, which runs from Monday to Friday beginning 8:30 a.m. and end at 5 p.m. – 6 p.m. Some companies work a half day on Saturdays. Shops, supermarkets and shopping centres are open seven days a week and on most public holidays. 'Foreign workers', for example domestic helpers and construction workers (typically from the Philippines and India, respectively), usually work 6 days per week, having Sunday as their only day off.\n\nIn Thailand the working week is Monday to Friday for a maximum of 44 to 48 hours per week (Saturday can be a half or full day).\n\nHowever, government offices and some private companies have modernised through enacting the American and European standard of working Monday through Friday.\n\nCurrently, 50% of the luxury beach resorts in Phuket have a five-day working week. Of the remaining 50%, 23% have taken steps to reform their 6-day workweek through such measures as reducing the working week from 6 days to 5.5 days.\n\nVietnam has a standard 48-hour six-day workweek. Monday to Friday are full workdays and Saturday is a partial day. Work typically begins at 8:00 am and lasts until 5:00 pm from Monday to Friday and until 12 noon on Saturdays. This includes a one-hour lunch break. Government offices and banks follow a five-day workweek from Monday to Friday.\n\nIn Europe, the standard full-time working week begins on Monday and ends on Saturday. Most retail shops are open for business on Saturday. In Ireland, Italy, Finland, Sweden, the Netherlands and the former socialist states of Europe, large shopping centres open on Sunday. \nIn European countries such as Germany, there are laws regulating shop hours. With exceptions, shops must be closed on Sundays and from midnight until the early morning hours of every day.\n\nThe working week is Monday to Friday 8 hours per day. Shops are open on Saturday.

Workers are not obliged to work on Sunday. School children have traditionally taken Wednesday off, or had only a half day, making up the time either with longer days for the rest of the week or sometimes a half day on Saturday.

Shops are open on Saturday and Sunday. The weekend begins on Friday, and ends on Monday.\nIn Russia the common working week begins on Monday and ends on Friday with 8 hours per day.\n\nFederal law defines a working week duration of 5 or 6 days with no more than 40 hours worked. In all cases Sunday is a holiday. With a 5-day working week the employer chooses which day of the week will be the second day off. Usually this is a Saturday, but in some organizations (mostly government), it is Monday. Government offices can thereby offer Saturday service to people with a normal working schedule.\n\nThere are non-working public holidays in Russia; all of them fall on a fixed date. By law, if such a holiday coincides with an ordinary day off, the next work day becomes a day off. An official public holiday cannot replace a regular day off. Each year the government can modify working weeks near public holidays in order to optimize the labor schedule. For example, if a five-day week has a public holiday on Tuesday or Thursday, the calendar is rearranged to provide a reasonable working week.\n\nExceptions include occupations such as transit workers, shop assistants, and security guards. In many cases independent schemes are used. For example, the service industry often uses the X-through-Y scheme (Russian: \"X через Y\") when every worker uses X days for work and the next Y days for rest.\nIn the former Soviet Union the standard working week was 41 hours: 8 hours, 12 minutes, Monday to Friday. Before the mid-1960s there was a 42-hour 6-day standard working week: 7 hours Monday to Friday and 6 hours on Saturday.\n\nIn Serbia, the working week is Monday to Friday; 8 hours per day (with 30 minutes break included), 40 hours in total per week.

Large malls are open on Saturday and Sunday; many small shops are closed on Sunday. All shops are closed on public holidays.\n\nThe working week is Monday to Friday; 8 hours per day, 40 hours in total per week. The traditional opening hours are 9:00 to 13:00–14:00 and then 15:00–16:00 to 18:00 for most offices and workplaces. Most shops are open on Saturday mornings and many of the larger shopping malls are open all day Saturday and in some cities like Madrid, they are open most Sundays. Some restaurants, bars, and shops are closed Mondays, as Mondays are commonly a slow business day.\n\nIn Sweden, the standard working week is Monday to Friday, both for offices and industry workers. The standard workday is eight hours, although it may vary greatly between different fields and businesses. Most office workers have flexible working hours and can largely decide themselves on how to divide these over the week. The working week is regulated by \"Arbetstidslagen\" (\"Work time law\") to a maximum of 40 hours per week. The 40-hour-week is however easily bypassed by overtime. The law allows a maximum of 200 hours overtime per year. There is however no overseeing government agency; the law is often cited as toothless.\n\nShops are almost always open on Saturdays and often on Sundays, supermarkets and shopping centres, so that employees there have to work. Traditionally, restaurants were closed on Mondays if they were opened during the weekend, but this has in recent years largely fallen out of practice. Many museums do however still remain closed on Mondays.\n\nThe traditional business working week is from Monday to Friday (35 to 40 hours depending on contract). In retail, and other fields such as healthcare, days off might be taken on any day of the week. Employers can make their employees work every day of a week, although the employer is required to allow each employee breaks of either a continuous period of 24 hours every week or a continuous period of 48 hours every two weeks.\n\nLaws for shop opening hours differ between Scotland and the rest of the UK. In England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, many shops and services are open on Saturdays and increasingly so on Sundays as well. In England and Wales, stores' maximum Sunday opening hours vary according to the total floor space of the store. In Scotland, however, there is no restriction in law on shop opening hours on a Sunday.\n\nUnder the EU Working Time Directive (which may cease to apply to the UK), workers cannot be forced to work for more than 48 hours per week on average. However, the UK allows individuals to opt out if they so choose. Individuals can choose to opt in again after opting out, even if opting out was part of their employment contract. It is illegal to dismiss them or treat them unfairly for so doing – but they may be required to give up to 3 months notice to give the employer time to prepare, depending on what their employment contract says.\n\nThe minimum holiday entitlement is now 28 days per year, but that can include public holidays, depending on the employee's contract. England & Wales have eight, Scotland has nine, and Northern Ireland has ten permanent public holidays each year. The 28 days holiday entitlement means that if the government creates a one-off public holiday in a given year, it is not necessarily a day off and it does not add 1 day to employees' holiday entitlement – unless the employer says otherwise, which some do.\n\nIn Islam, Friday is the weekly day of prayer when Jumu'ah prayers take place. For this reason, most of the Middle Eastern countries and some other predominantly Muslim-majority countries used to consider Thursday and Friday as their weekend. However, this weekend arrangement is no longer observed by a significant number of Muslim-majority countries (see below).\n\nThree Muslim majority countries have Friday as the only weekend day and have a six-day working week.\n\n\nJordan was the first Arab country to shift to the Friday-Saturday weekend arrangement back in January 2000. Other Arab states followed in the coming years. Following reforms in a number of Arab states in the Persian Gulf in the 2000s and 2010s, the Thursday–Friday weekend was replaced by the Friday–Saturday weekend. This change provided for the Muslim offering of Friday prayers and afforded more work days to coincide with the working calendars of international financial markets.\nOther countries with Muslim-majority populations or significant Muslim populations follow the Saturday–Sunday weekend, such as Indonesia, Lebanon, Turkey, Tunisia and Morocco. While Friday is a working day, a long midday break is given to allow time for worship.\n\n\nBrunei has a non-contiguous working week, consisting of Monday to Thursday plus Saturday. The days of rest are Friday (for Jumu'ah prayers) and Sunday. Some non-government companies in Brunei adopted the working week of Monday to Friday, while the weekend starts on Saturday until Sunday. Depending on the company rules, employees may be required to work half-day on Saturday.\n\n"}

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on October 19, 1997, to overwhelmingly positive reviews. In the series' sixth flashback episode, it is explained how Lisa got her saxophone. The episode was executive produced by Al Jean and Mike Reiss and was the first episode Jean wrote by himself, as all of his previous writing credits had been shared with Reiss. It was directed by Dominic Polcino and guest starred Fyvush Finkel, who appeared as himself portraying Krusty in a film.\n\nHomer and Bart are watching television when they are interrupted by Lisa playing her saxophone in her bedroom. Bart enters Lisa's bedroom and tries to grab the saxophone from her, but he inadvertently tosses it out the window. It lands in the middle of the street and is run over by traffic and stomped on by Nelson Muntz. In a period of mourning, Lisa reveals she cannot remember ever \"not\" having that saxophone, so Homer recounts the instrument's origins.\n\nIn a flashback to 1990, Bart goes to his first day of school, but things do not go so well for him and he becomes depressed. It is during discussions of Bart's future that the school psychologist realizes the young Lisa is very intelligent, telling Homer and Marge that they need to nurture her gifted spirit. They try to send Lisa to a private school but the tuition fee costs $6,000. Meanwhile, a terrible heatwave hits Springfield and Homer saves $200 to buy an air conditioner. Marge, however, asks Homer not to buy one until they figure out how to help Lisa. At the school, Bart talks with Milhouse and makes a farting sound, which Milhouse finds amusing. Encouraged, Bart entertains a group of children and sets out on his path to become the school prankster.\n\nOn his way to purchase a new air conditioner, Homer discovers that a musical instrument is a way to encourage a gifted child, and subsequently sacrifices his air conditioner money to buy Lisa her first saxophone. In the present, Marge mentions that there is some money in the air conditioner account, so Homer decides to buy another saxophone for Lisa.\n\n\"Lisa's Sax\" is the first episode that Al Jean had ever been credited as having written by himself. Before this episode, all of his writing credits had been shared with Mike Reiss. The episode was written with a small staff that consisted of Jean, Reiss and David Stern, among others. According to Reiss, the final episode contained 80–90% of Jean's original script. It is the sixth flashback episode done by the show. \"The Way We Was\" was the first flashback episode and in it, Homer graduated from high school in 1974 and that made it difficult to have a realistic timeframe as this episode is set in 1990. Jean conceived the idea for the \"All in the Family\" style opening while waiting to get tickets to the O.J. Simpson murder trial. The episode was very short and the clip of Lisa playing the sax at the end was added to lengthen it.\n\nThe pastel drawing of Krusty was drawn entirely by Dominic Polcino, who revealed it was the only piece of original artwork created solely by him that was featured in an episode. He created the pastel drawing with this in mind. It was an easy episode for Polcino to direct due to the lack of crowds and being a \"grounded episode\". This is the last episode in which Doris Grau has a speaking role as Lunchlady Doris, although this episode aired nearly two years after her death. It would also mark the final time the character would speak until Season 18's \"The Mook, the Chef, the Wife and Her Homer\" when she was voiced by Tress MacNeille.\n\nWhile telling Bart and Lisa about 1990, Homer says, \"Tracey Ullman was entertaining America with [...] crudely drawn filler material.\" This is a reference to \"The Simpsons\"s debut as \"bumpers\" airing before and after commercials on \"The Tracey Ullman Show\". The song \"Those Were the Days\" parodies the opening credits of the television show \"All in the Family\". One of the people who run over the saxophone is a man on a tricycle, who promptly falls over. This is a reference to the show \"Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In\". At the beginning of the flashback, the song \"Don't Worry, Be Happy\" by Bobby McFerrin can be heard. In the flashback, Dr. Hibbert fashioned his hair and attire like Mr. T in \"The A-Team\". Homer can be seen watching \"Twin Peaks\" and The Giant is then shown waltzing with the White Horse. In King Toot's music store, when Homer buys Lisa her first saxophone, there is a guitar in the background that is similar to Eddie Van Halen's \"Frankenstrat\" guitar. The photo beside Kent Brockman on the news has him modeled after the Coppertone Girl. At the end of the episode, Lisa performs a brief, cruder rendition of the hook of \"Baker Street\" by Gerry Rafferty on her new saxophone before the music segues into the original song.\n\nIn its original broadcast, \"Lisa's Sax\" finished 51st in ratings for the week of October 13–19, 1997, with a Nielsen rating of 8.2, equivalent to approximately 8.0 million viewing households. It was the second highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following \"King of the Hill\".\n\nThe authors of the book \"I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide\", Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called it \"a terrific episode, full of amusing self-referential wit and it is especially nice to finally discover what it was that caused Bart to go down the path to the dark side.\" \n\nRobert Canning of IGN strongly praised the episode, saying it is \"not only very funny, but it's also loaded with \"Simpson\" heart.\" \n\nA review of \"The Simpsons\" season 9 DVD release in \"The San Diego Union-Tribune\" highlighted \"Lisa's Sax\" along with \"All Singing, All Dancing\" and \"Trash of the Titans\" as some of the more memorable episodes of the series. \n\nStephen Becker of \"The Dallas Morning News\" noted that season 9 \"has a special affinity for Lisa\", and highlighted this episode along with \"Das Bus\" and \"Lisa the Simpson\" in his review of the DVD. \n\nA segment of the episode where two schoolgirls chant the digits of pi while playing patty-cake is used by mathematicians Sarah J. Greenwald of Appalachian State University and Andrew Nestler of Santa Monica College in a website on the mathematics of \"The Simpsons\".\n\n"}

It was founded on October 18, 1992 and registered with the Ministry of Justice on January 26, 1993. The party leader from its formation and until her death in 2003 was Yaroslava Stetsko (people's deputy of three VR conventions).\n\nThe party was set up late 1992 by émigrés of OUN-B on the initiative of Slava Stetsko and Roman Zvarych. It was registered on 26 January 1993 by the Ukrainian Ministry of Justice and was the 11th political party in Ukraine that was officially registered.\n\nDuring the 1998 parliamentary election the party was part (together with Ukrainian Conservative Republican Party and Ukrainian Republican Party) of the Election Bloc \"National Front\" () which won 2,71% of the national votes and 6 (single-mandate constituency) seats.\n\nAt the parliamentary elections on 30 March 2002, the party was part of the Viktor Yushchenko Bloc Our Ukraine. Former party leader Oleksiy Ivchenko was the head of Naftogas of Ukraine under the Yekhanurov Government. He was elected as the party leader on the seventh convention of the party on April 13, 2003.\n\nDuring the parliamentary elections on 26 March 2006, the party was part of the Our Ukraine alliance. Roman Zvarych was Minister of Justice in the First Tymoshenko Government and Second Tymoshenko Government and in the Alliance of National Unity.\n\nAt the end of 2006, the Prosecutor General of Ukraine’s Office opened a criminal case against party leader Oleksii Ivchenko on charges\nof embezzlement and abuse of his official position as former head of Naftogaz. Ivchenko was dropped from its party ticket in the spring of 2007. The party refused to join the Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc in August 2007 and almost a month before the elections decided not to run in the 2007 parliamentary elections.\n\nIn the 2010 local elections the party biggest achievement was winning two seats in the Lviv Oblast Counsel. In December 2011 Stepan Bratsiun was elected party leader.\n\nThe party competed on one single party under \"umbrella\" party Our Ukraine in the 2012 Ukrainian parliamentary election, together with Ukrainian People's Party; this list won 1.11% of the national votes and no constituencies and thus failed to win parliamentary representation. The party itself had competed in 28 constituencies and lost in all.\n\nIn the 2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election the party was electable on a nationwide list and it the participated in 8 constituencies; but its candidates lost in all of them and the party received only 0.05% of the votes nationwide and thus the party won no parliamentary seats.\n\nOn 19 November 2018 Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists and fellow Ukrainian nationalist political organizations Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists, Right Sector and C14 endorsed Ruslan Koshulynskyi candidacy in the 2019 Ukrainian presidential election. In the election Koshulynskyi received 1.6% of the votes.\n\nThe party supports democratic nationalism and a strong nation state independent from Russia.\n\nHowever, as of recently the official website the party appears to express support for Zionism and Israel (although not the Israeli government, for prosecuting Demjanjuk), and regards Ze'ev Jabotinsky as a hero, as it features articles by Moysey Fishbein as well as a few other articles, although the party does defend alleged Nazi war criminal John Demjanjuk; who they believe is wrongly accused.\n\n\n\nThe flag of the Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists is a rectangular two-color banner with two horizontal halves. The upper half is red and the bottom half is black. It is inspired by the flag of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army. There emblem is based on that of the former Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists. The red background circle is in-framed by the black (outside) and gold (inside) line with a cross which is placed in the middle and appears to be as a sword.

Often it is simply referred to as the Movement (, Rukh). The party under the name Rukh was an observer member of the European People's Party (EPP) until 2013.\n\nRukh gathers most of its voters and support from Western Ukraine. In November 2016, the party had 35,000 members.\n\nInitially organized as the People's Movement of Ukraine for Reconstruction (\"i.e.\" for Perestroika), Rukh was founded in 1989 as a civil-political movement as there were no other political parties allowed in the Soviet Union but the Communist Party. The founding of Rukh was made possible due to Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev's Glasnost policies. The program and statutes of the movement were proposed by the Writers Association of Ukraine and were published in the journal \"Literary Ukraine\" (Literaturna Ukraina) on 16 February 1989. The organization has its roots in Ukrainian dissidents — the most notable of them being Viacheslav Chornovil — yet not excluding the fact that it was accepting various other politically oriented members from liberal communists to integralist nationalists. From March to September 1989 numerous constituent party conferences took place across Ukraine. The first Constituent Congress of the \"People's Movement of Ukraine for Reconstruction\" took place on 8–10 September 1989 in Kiev. Elected as the first leader of the movement was the Ukrainian poet and screenwriter Ivan Drach.\n\nAppearance of the organization coincided with dismissal of Volodymyr Shcherbytsky as the First Secretary of Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine and rise of Leonid Kravchuk. On one hand Kravchuk officially promised that \"faster he will grow hair on his palm than Rukh will be registered\", on the other hand according to author of the book \"People's Movement of Ukraine. History\" (), Hryhoriy Honcharuk, with reference to Ivan Drach, it was Kravchuk who facilitated publishing of the Rukh's program draft in \"Literaturna Ukrayina\" in February 1989. And according to rumors, he also approved that the rector of KPI Talanchuk would grant the Politech's Assembly Hall to hold the Rukh's constituent congress.\n\nThe official Soviet press and government portrayed members as anti-Semites at first.\n\nThe movement's biggest public, political, cultural, and social actions were:\n\nAt first the movement aimed at supporting Gorbachev's reforms, later the People's Movement of Ukraine was instrumental in conducting an independence referendum in the Ukrainian SSR. This was partially due to the Russification policies of the Soviet Union when the USSR Supreme Soviet officially announced the Russian language as the singular official state language of the country in 1989. During Rukh's existence within the Soviet Union, its members were threatened and intimidated. In the western oblasts \"Rukh\" became colloquially known as an abbreviation for the call \"Save Ukraine, fellows!\" (Рятуйте Україну, Хлопці!).\n\nThe movement initially registered by the Ministry of Justice on 9 February 1990 as the political party. After the creation of the Ukrainian Republican Party (URP) in January 1990 and later the Democratic Party of Ukraine (DemPU), the People's Movement of Ukraine unofficially existed as a coalition of those two along with numerous other smaller factions. These parties created a group within the Verkhovna Rada called the \"Democratic Bloc\" which stood in opposition to \"Group 239\", which was led by Oleksandr Moroz (\"For the sovereign Soviet Ukraine\") (see 1990 Ukrainian parliamentary election). In October 1990 Rukh's second Party Congress took place. During the session it was decided to exclude the word \"Reconstruction\" (Perestroika), not to be associated with the Communist movement. Ivan Drach was re-elected as leader, while his deputies became Mykhailo Horyn and Oleksandr Lavrynovych. In order to draw the URP and DemPU closer to Rukh, the \"Institute of Associative Membership in the Movement\" was established. The brittle coalition of the mentioned parties held until the presidential elections in September 1991 when URP and DemPU provided their own candidates in opposition to Vyacheslav Chornovil.\n\nFrom 28 February – 1 March 1992 the third Party Congress took place during which a schism within Rukh was avoided by electing a leadership triad of Ivan Drach, Mykhailo Horyn, and Vyacheslav Chornovil. The new deputy leaders were , O. Burakovsky, V. Burlakov, and O. Lavrynovych. The \"Institute of Associative Membership in the Movement\" was formally recognized as dissolved due to both the URP and DemPU declaring themselves as supporters of state president Leonid Kravchuk. The People's Movement of Ukraine declared its parliamentary opposition to the government and in January 1992 re-registered due to substantial changes in its statutes. Soon Ivan Drach left the party, followed by the resignation of Mykhailo Horyn in June 1992 together with V. Burlakov. Horyn was soon elected as leader of the Ukrainian Republican Party. In December 1992 Rukh's IV Party Congress took place which once again revised its statute and the party's goals. Vyacheslav Chornovil was elected leader, the rest of the party's leadership was left without major changes. During the Congress some party delegates in opposition to Chornovil created the All-National Movement of Ukraine (VNRU), headed by Larysa Skoryk.\n\nThe People's Movement of Ukraine was registered by the Ukrainian Ministry of Justice as a political party on 1 February 1993. Rukh's parliamentary faction split up into 2 different factions in the spring of 1999 (the breakaway faction was led by Hennadiy Udovenko with its highest Rada membership of 19 dwindling to 14; the \"other\" faction ended with 23; meaning that 10 elected People's Movement of Ukraine deputies did not represent any segment of the party anymore by June 2002). Right before the 1999 presidential elections another major schism took place within the party. Yuriy Kostenko openly protested against the election of Viacheslav Chornovil as the party leader and established another party, People's Movement of Ukraine (Kostenko), where Kostenko became the leader of the party. Despite the split a followed party congress elected Vyacheslav Chornovil as party leader. The congress also adopted the signing of an agreement between People's Movement of Ukraine and the Reforms and Order Party for a political bloc supporting Hennadiy Udovenko as a single presidential candidate for the next elections. At the parliamentary elections on 29 March 1998, the party received 9.4% of the vote and 46 seats. At the parliamentary elections on 30 March 2002, the party was part of the Viktor Yushchenko Bloc–Our Ukraine. Currently, \"Rukh\" was a part of the Our Ukraine Bloc, where it represented the right wing of the Union's party spectrum. At the parliamentary elections on 26 March 2006, the party was part of the Our Ukraine alliance, and the party's members secured 13 seats in the parliament. At the 2007 parliamentary elections the party was again part of the Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc alliance, that won 72 out of 450 seats.\n\nIn the 2010 local elections the party won 8 representative in the regional parliament of the Lviv Oblast, 3 representative in the regional parliament of Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast, 1 in Kherson Oblast, 5 in the Verkhovna Rada of Crimea and 3 seats in the city councils of Lviv and Simferopol.\n\nThe party competed as one single party under the \"umbrella\" party \"Fatherland\", together with several other parties, during the 2012 parliamentary elections During the election this list won 62 seats (25.55% of the votes) under the proportional party-list system and another 39 by winning 39 simple-majority constituencies; a total of 101 seats in Parliament.\n\nIn 2013, the party split in two parts. The party merged with Ukrainian People's Party in May 2013. While its former chairman Borys Tarasyuk and others assimilated into \"Fatherland\" in June 2013. The bulk of the party organisation and ordinary members remained loyal to the party.\n\nIn the 2014 Ukrainian presidential election party leader Vasyl Kuybida received 0.06% of the vote.\n\nIn the 2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election the party participated in 3 constituencies; but its candidates lost in all of them and thus the party won no parliamentary seats. However, after being expelled from (the political party) Self Reliance the lawmakers Pavlo Kyshkar and Viktor Kryvenko joined the party in April 2016 (in parliament they both joined the faction of the Petro Poroshenko Bloc in March 2016 before leaving it in December 2017).\n\nIn the 2015 Ukrainian local elections the party was able to gain seats in 270 local councils (0.17% of all local councils).\n\nOn 10 January 2019 Viktor Kryvenko was chosen the People's Movement of Ukraine candidate in the 2019 Ukrainian presidential election and their chairman. In the election he received 0.04% of the vote.\n\nIn the 2019 Ukrainian parliamentary election the party had 18 candidates in constituencies, but none of them won a parliamentary seat.\n\nDirectly out of the official website:\n\n\n\n Temporarily merged with Batkivshchyna as \"Fatherland – United Opposition\"\n\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nThe municipality was named after General Mariano Álvarez, a native of the town of Noveleta, Cavite.\nWith an area of just 11.40 square kilometers, it is the second most densely populated municipality in Cavite after Rosario.\n\nGeneral Mariano Alvarez was formerly a part of Carmona, Cavite. The province's third planned community was previously called Carmona Resettlement Project and was under the direct management of the People’s Homesite and Housing Corporation (PHHC). The project started in March 1968 because of the need to clear the Quezon Memorial Park, Diliman, Quezon City of different shanties and other illegal constructions built on it. By 1974, the project lots became part of the full-fledged communities of poor and middle class residents coming from Quezon City, Manila, Makati and Parañaque.\n\nDue to the popular clamor of the residents of the aforementioned resettlement areas towards the conversion of their locality into an independent municipality, the ten (10) Barangay Council of the communities of the then San Gabriel and San Jose, submitted resolution expressing their desire to the Sangguniang Bayan of Carmona which in turn favorably endorsed the idea through Resolutions No. 56-S-1978. By 1979, the idea soon began to speed up as the provincial deputy to the Interim Batasang Pambansa, Helena Benitez, and MP for Eastern Visayas and concurrent Minister of Local Government, Jose Roño, pursued the separation of the growing communities, whose several of their residents were now working in the growing industrial factories in Carmona town and in other parts of the province, as well as in agriculture and small enterprises.\n\nThe Municipality of General Mariano Alvarez came into existence upon the ratification by the majority votes cast in a plebiscite at Carmona and its duly constituted barangays within a period of 180 days after the approval of Batas Pambansa 75 and Parliamentary Bill No. 631 after which then President Ferdinand Marcos appointed the first set of local officials for the said town.\n\nUpon the effectivity of the specified legal acts converting Barangays San Jose and San Gabriel into the Municipality of General Mariano Alvarez, its proportional share in the obligation of funds, assets and other properties of Carmona was transferred to the newly created municipality upon the recommendation of the Commission of Audit, which was approved on June 30, 1980. The new municipality's first officials were officially inaugurated on March 14, 1981.\n\nThe new town, for the next few years, was composed of the Resettlement areas of Barangays San Jose, San Gabriel and a portion of Cabilang Baybay. Barangay San Jose consisted of areas A and B while Barangay San Gabriel consisted of Areas C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K.\n\nIn 2006, the municipality celebrated its 25th anniversary with a line-up of activities participated in by the municipality’s residents.

From this point the terrain gradually begin to gently slope in one direction in the middle portion of the municipality, undulating and rolling to more than one direction towards the north-eastern barangay of Epifanio Malia, portion of Francisco de Castro, Francisco Reyes and San Jose.\n\nInland water bodies serve as natural boundaries with neighboring municipalities and drain its surface waters towards Manila Bay and Laguna Bay. These are Embarcadero River on the western boundaries with Dasmarinas and San Gabriel River on the eastern boundaries with Carmona. A major tributary, of San Gabriel River traverse the inner areas of the municipality from Francisco de Castro and Southwoods to Jacinto Lumbreras. The same tributary branches out at Inocencio Salud to serve as boundaries between the barangay of Col. J.P Elises andAldiano Olaes, on the eastern side. Small streams crisscross the landscape forming natural drainage where waste drains from Manila Bay and Laguna de Bay. These water bodies run and form deep gullies which gave the land a mass ridge-like formation. Considering the height and mass of the water bodies, the ridge-like formation are highly elevated. Thus, the terrain as described above.\n\nMan-made physical changes, includes the presence of the Congressional Road which stretcher on full length of the municipality from the Governor's Drive or the national highway in the south to Francisco de Castro on the north.

But in May 2019 UDAR undid this merge.\n\nIn October 2017, the party had about 30,000 members; former members of Party of Regions are denied membership.\n\nIn the 2019 Ukrainian parliamentary election the party won 23 seats on the nationwide party list and 2 constituency seats.\n\nThe party started in 2000 as a parliamentary faction called \"Solidarity\", set up by Petro Poroshenko, until then a member of the Social Democratic Party of Ukraine (united) faction. Taras Kuzio claims that this happened with the help of then President Kuchma, who allegedly wanted to limit the influence of the SDPU(u). Many deputies elected in 1998 for the Peasant Party of Ukraine and Hromada joined the new parliamentary faction. Based on his parliamentary faction Poroshenko eventually established the \"Party of Ukraine's Solidarity\". In 2000 that party merged into what would become the Party of Regions (later to become for a period the biggest party of Ukraine) and Poroshenko became a Party of Regions deputy.\n\nIn 2001, Poroshenko expressed interest in the creation of the Our Ukraine Bloc. However, in order to receive quote in Our Ukraine he had to join the bloc with his whole party. The Party of Ukraine's Solidarity failed to break away from the Party of Regions, therefore Poroshenko decided to create a new phantom party with a similar name, the party \"Solidarity\". At the 2002 parliamentary elections Solidarity was able to join Our Ukraine. Top party members who received a parliamentary mandate on party list of the Our Ukraine electoral bloc in 2002 were Volodymyr Plyutynsky, Volodymyr Makeyenko, Eduard Matviychuk, Anatoliy Korchynsky, while a single constituency in Vinnytsia Oblast was won by Petro Poroshenko.\n\nAfter 2002, Solidarity stopped participating in elections. In 2004, the party left Our Ukraine, and was represented by 23 deputies in the Verkhovna Rada (the forming of new factions whose parties were not directly elected into parliament was not unique in Ukraine at the time.) In March 2013 the Ministry of Justice asked the Central Election Commission of Ukraine for evidence that Solidarity had not been involved in elections since 2003.\n\nOn 17 June 2013, Fatherland member of parliament Yuriy Stets became head of the party. Stets was a member of the united opposition's political council.\n\nOn 16 October 2013, a court cancelled the registration certificate of Solidarity. The party could have challenged this on appeal, but did not and was legally eliminated on 31 December 2013 \"due to lack of reporting\". and because for more than 10 years had not participated in any election.\n\nEarly in 2014 Poroshenko became leader of the National Alliance of freedom and Ukrainian patriotism \"OFFENSIVE\", which was renamed \"All-Ukrainian Union Solidarity\". By doing so, Poroshenko de facto prolonged the life of Solidarity and de facto merged the National Alliance of freedom and Ukrainian patriotism \"OFFENSIVE\" into Solidarity (legally the original party \"Solidarity\" does not exist anymore). National Alliance of freedom and Ukrainian patriotism \"OFFENSIVE\" was registered in May 2000 under the name All-Ukrainian Party of Peace and Unity (, HPEM). It was not allowed to participate in the electoral alliance \"Rainbow\" in the Ukrainian 2002 parliamentary elections. In the 2006 elections, the party failed as part of the electoral alliance Yuriy Karmazin Bloc to win parliamentary representation. In the 2007 elections, the party failed again as part of the All-Ukrainian Community to win parliamentary representation. After this election (the party) \"All-Ukrainian Party of Peace and Unity\" was renamed National Alliance of Freedom and Ukrainian patriotism \"OFFENSIVE\". National Alliance of freedom and Ukrainian patriotism \"OFFENSIVE\" did not participate in the 2012 parliamentary elections.\n\nIn May and June 2014, \"Ukrayinska Pravda\" characterised the party (\"All-Ukrainian Union Solidarity\") as \"a myth with no website, unknown phone numbers and non existing addresses\". At the 2014 presidential election, Poroshenko was elected President of Ukraine.\n\nDuring a 27 August 2014 party congress, the \"All-Ukrainian Union Solidarity\" changed its name to \"Bloc of Petro Poroshenko\" (, \"Blok Petra Poroshenka\") , and elected the former Minister of Internal Affairs, Yuriy Lutsenko, as the new leader of the party.\n\nOn 2 September, Vitali Klitschko, then parliamentary leader of the Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform, stated that since his party and the Petro Poroshenko Bloc had agreed to joint participation in parliamentary elections on 29 March 2014, the two parties were in discussion about running a joint list at the October 26 parliamentary election. On 15 September it became clear that 30% of the Petro Poroshenko Bloc election list would be filled by members of UDAR and that UDAR leader Klitschko was at the top of this list, Klitschko vowed not to resign as incumbent Mayor of Kiev. According to political scientist Tadeusz A. Olszański (in mid-September 2014) this deal with UDAR \"enables it to use that party's large-scale structures, which the Poroshenko Bloc itself lacks\".\n\nThe party won the parliamentary election with 132 seats, beating the runner-up People's Front, who won 82 seats. People's Front was first in the nationwide party vote (22.14% against 21.81%) but the party won 69 constituency seats while People's Front won only 18. On 27 November 2014, the party formed a parliamentary faction of 145 people (at the opening session of the new parliament).\n\nTop 10 politicians on the party list to the Ukrainian parliament: 1. Vitaliy Klychko, 2. Yuriy Lutsenko, 3. Olha Bohomolets, 4. Volodymyr Hroysman, 5. Mustafa Dzhemilev, 6. Yuliy Mamchur, 7. Maria Matios, 8. Mykola Tomenko, 9. Iryna Herashchenko, 10. Vitaliy Kovalchuk.\n\nOn 21 November 2014 the party became a member of the coalition supporting the current second Yatsenyuk government and endorsed nine new ministers for the government.\n\nOn March 2015, \"Solidarity\" was added to the name \"Bloc of Petro Poroshenko\". On 28 August 2015 UDAR and Petro Poroshenko Bloc officially merged into Petro Poroshenko Bloc. UDAR party leader Vitali Klitschko became so the new party leader.\n\nThe party was one of the winners of the 2015 Ukrainian local elections. It did well in West and central Ukraine and Kherson Oblast region.\n\nAccording to Ukrainian media research of February 2016 22% of the parties' representatives in regional councils and 12% of the parties' parliamentary deputies were former members of the Party of Regions.\n\nFollowing the fall of the second Yatsenyuk government, the party joined the coalition that supports the 14 April 2016 installed Groysman Government. In the weeks prior to this 11 MPs had switched to the faction making forming the coalition possible.\n\nKlitschko resigned as Petro Poroshenko Bloc chairman (on 26 May) after a new law barring him as head of the Kiev City State Administration to be chairman or a member of a political party took effect on 1 May 2016.\n\nOn 18 May 2019 Klitschko announced that UDAR would take part in the 2019 Ukrainian parliamentary election autonomously.\n\nThe party changed its name to its current form on 24 May 2019. According to party leader Poroshenko this had to be done in order to bring in a new leadership of the party and to win the 2019 Ukrainian parliamentary election.\n\nTop 10 politicians on the party list to the Ukrainian parliament in these elections were 1. Petro Poroshenko, 2. Andriy Parubiy, 3. Iryna Herashchenko, 4. Mykhailo Zabrodskyi, 5. Sofia Fedyna, 6. Mustafa Dzhemilev, 7. , 8. Oleh Synyutka, 9. Akhtem Chyihoz, 10. Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze.\n\nIn the 2019 parliamentary election, European Solidarity scored badly, dropping to 8,10% of votes and electing 23 MPs (37% of which were women) on the nationwide party list and winning 2 constituency seats. The party voted against the confidence vote in the new Honcharuk Government.\n\nThe party officially decries populism and advocates for pragmatism and realism. According to Oleg Varfolomeyev of the Eurasia Daily Monitor the party is a liberal party (and UDAR was as well). According to Bohdan Butkevych of The Ukrainian Week, the party does not have an ideological unity. Due to the fact the party was created shortly before the 2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election and then its \"party list was drawn up by taking almost anyone who was ready and willing to invest their own resources\". Hence its parliamentary faction consists of people who \"have very different interests, methods of getting into parliament and plans\". (Hence) the party's MPs tend not to vote alike.\n\nThe party broadly reflects Poroshenko's ideology. On 27 August 2014 newly elected party leader Yuriy Lutsenko stated that the Petro Poroshenko Bloc should help Poroshenko implement his election promises. Official party positions include:\n\nAs to the War in Donbass, the party advocates an end to the conflict by peaceful means.\n\nElection results for \"Solidarity\", \"All-Ukrainian Party of Peace and Unity\", \"Petro Poroshenko Bloc\" and \"European Solidarity\" political party.\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nDuring the earlier part of the Spanish colonial period, General Trias was often referred to as \"Las Estancias\" (the ranches), which was once a part of Cavite el Viejo, the present-day Kawit. It was also called \"Malabón Grande\". The name \"Malabón\" was speculated to have been derived from either the local term \"\"maraming labong\",\" due to the abundance of bamboo shoots in the area, which is a main ingredient in Filipino cuisine; or from \"\"mayabong\",\" referring to the trees and other plants once abundant in the place.\n\nAt any rate, the first reference seems to be more probable because General Mariano Trías, a noted writer, adopted the nom de guerre \"\"Labong\",\" a word he often used in his writing and conversation. Grande, on the other hand, was affixed to the appellation because at the time, the place was a vast wilderness covering Sitio Tejero, frequently called by the revolutionary as Salinas (present-day Rosario), Santa Cruz de Malabón or Malabón el Chico (present-day Tanza) and Tierra Alta (present-day Noveleta). When the town was made independent from Cavite el Viejo, it was finally called by its popular name San Francisco de Malabón, in honor of patron saint, Saint Francis of Assisi (1181-1200).\n\nThe first uprising in Cavite known as the \"First Cry of Cavite\" occurred in San Francisco de Malabón about ten o’clock in the morning of 31 August 1896, when the town tribunal was attacked by Filipino revolutionaries led by Mariano Trías, Diego Mojica and Nicolas Portilla in Pasong Kalabaw (now known as Santa Clara). The second incident followed at twelve noon at Tierra Alta and the third in Cavite el Viejo between two and three o’clock in the afternoon.\n\nA chapter of the Katipunan known as Balangay Mapagtiis had already been in existence in the place for sometime. The Sangguniang Bayang Magdiwang headed by General Mariano Álvarez of Tierra Alta and the Sangguniang Bayang Mapagtiis of San Francisco de Malabón later merged under the name Magdiwang Council with General Alvarez as president. The Magdiwang Council hosted the Tejeros Convention on 22 March 1897 in a friar estate house in Sitio Tejero wherein Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo was elected president and Mariano Trías, then lieutenant general, as vice-president in a revolutionary government replacing the Katipunan.\n\nOn 28 February 1914, Act No. 2390 was passed by the Philippine Assembly, changing the town's name to Malabón. On February 24,1920, Act No. 2889 was approved renaming the town after one of its most famous son, General Mariano Trías.\n\nOn 19 August 2015, Philippine President Benigno S. Aquino III signed \"Republic Act No. 10675\" which converted the municipality of General Trias into a component city of Cavite. The bill finally came into full effect after majority of the city's residents voted yes to cityhood through a plebiscite. General Trias thus became the seventh city in the province and the 145th in the country.\n\nOn 14 September 2018, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte signed \"Republic Act No. 11069\" reapportioning the province of Cavite into eight legislative districts to make General Trias the province's sixth legislative district.\n\nGeneral Trias is an inland city of Cavite located southwest of Manila. It straddles the northeastern part of the province. The city is surrounded by the municipalities of Rosario and Noveleta in the north, by Tanza and Trece Martires in the west, by Amadeo in the south, Silang in the southeast, and the cities of Dasmarinas and Imus to the east. General Trias has a total land area of 81.46 square kilometers.\n\nGeneral Trias is politically subdivided into 33 barangays:\n\nIn the , the population of General Trias, Cavite, was people, with a density of .\n\nA vast majority of inhabitants are Roman Catholics while Protestanism is the second largest denomination in the city and some migrants from Mindanao practicing Islam.\n\nGeneral Trias is one of the Hispanic cities in the Philippines because of these Spanish speakers are present in the city. Filipino , English and Spanish are the most used language in the area specially in Buenavista (also known as Camaren) because this has been the hide out of the Spaniards during the colonial period.\n\nPursuant to Chapter II, Title II, Book III of Republic Act No. 7160 or the Local Government Code of 1991, the city government is to be composed of a mayor (\"alkalde\"), a vice mayor (\"bise alkalde\") and members (\"kagawad\") of the legislative branch Sangguniang Panlungsod alongside a secretary to the said legislature, all of which are elected to a three-year term and are eligible to run for three consecutive terms.\n\nAs with every Philippine city, the city mayor serves as General Trias' chief executive. Elected to a term of three years and limited to three consecutive terms, he or she appoints the directors of each city department, which include the office of administration, engineering office, information office, legal office, and treasury office. The current mayor is Antonio Ferrer, brother of former mayor and incumbent 6th District congressman Luis \"Jon-Jon\" Ferrer IV.\n\nThe city's vice mayor performs duties as acting mayor in the absence of the mayor. He or she also automatically succeeds as mayor upon the death of the incumbent, or if the latter is unable to fulfil his/her duties. He or she also convenes the Sangguniang Panlungsod, the city's legislative body. The current vice mayor is Maurito Sison.\n\nWithin the city, the City Board or Sangguniang Panlungsod crafts all city ordinances, performs appropriation of city funds, issues franchises and permits, impose fees on city services, and exercise other duties and powers as stipulated by the Local Government Code of 1991.\n\nUnder R.A. 10675 Article V Section 10 (a).

Several major industrial estates, such as Gateway Business Park, a world class business community in Javalera and the New Cavite Industrial City (\"NCIC\") in Manggahan, have chosen General Trias to be their home base.\n\nThe Cavite Export Processing Zone (\"CEP\"Z) occupies about 0.60 square kilometres of land belonging to General Trias. 110 factories operate in the CEPZ. The others are the Golden Gate Industrial Park (\"Phase I\") in Buenavista II and Golden Gate Industrial Park (\"Phase II\") in Panungyanan while the rest are found at Barangay Manggahan, Barangay San Francisco and along Governor's Drive.\n\nGeneral Trias is considered one of the new frontiers of growth and development in the CALABARZON area as attested by the giant industrial subdivisions located in the city. Many of these are in the highland barangay of Manggahan, located along Governor's Drive, the barangays of San Francisco, Santiago in Arnaldo Highway, and barangay Pasong Camachille II in Open Canal Road .\n\nLocated at the Tejero intersection and opened in May 2016, the 55,000-square meter Robinson's Place General Trias is Robinson's fourth shopping mall in the province and the first full-scale mall in General Trias.\n\nOn the Southern part of the City lies one of the biggest Golf and Country residential estate Eagle Ridge Golf and Country Club. It covers about 700 hectares, which makes it one of the largest residential estate in the Country. The Golf & Country Club, which is one of the component of Eagle Ridge development, is nearing its completion with three playable golf courses and two operational satellite clubhouses.\n\nThe 300-hectare Eagle Ridge Residential expanse features a very upscale housing community, the integral component of the project, will make up the whole concept of Eagle Ridge as a golf and residential site.\n\nSince the fourth quarter of 2017, a number of shopping malls and areas are currently being built, and are expected to be complete in 2019 to 2021.\n\nGeneral Trias City celebrates their Valenciana Festival every year. Valenciana, a variation of the Valencian paella, was first popularized in General Trias and became part of their culture.\n\nThe master plan for General Trias is to achieve an agro-industrial and residential balance.

{"id": "2016375", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2016375", "title": "Third Ukrainian Republic (party)", "text": "Third Ukrainian Republic (party)\n\nThird Ukrainian Republic () is a political party in Ukraine. The party was formally named (from its creation in May 1999 till April 2010) Forward, Ukraine! (; \"Vpered, Ukrajino!\") and (from April 2010 till July 2014) People's Self-Defense Political Party ().\n\nIn December 2011 the party announced it would be merged into All-Ukrainian Union \"Fatherland\". However, in July 2014 the party was re-energised and renamed.\n\nOriginally, the party takes its roots from the electoral bloc \"Forward, Ukraine!\" that was formed on April 3, 1997. Composed out of several political formations such as the parliamentary faction \"Reforms\", the Christian-Democratic Party of Ukraine (leader V.Stretovych), the Christian Democratic Union, the Ukrainian Christian Democratic Party, Hromada (led by Oleksandr Turchynov), Christian Democratic Youth of Ukraine, the trade union \"Our Right\", the charity fund \"Ukrainian Perspective\", Ukrainian fund in support of reforms, and the political association \"Young Ukraine\". The leading section of that bloc was the parliamentary faction \"Reforms\" led by Serhiy Sobolyev. In June 1997 the faction changed its name to \"Forward, Ukraine!\" as well whose unofficial leader became the deputy speaker Viktor Musiyaka.\n\nRight before the 1998 Ukrainian parliamentary elections however the bloc fell apart, out which was created the Reforms and Order Party of Viktor Pynzenyk. The rest of the bloc consisting of the Christian Democratic Union, the Ukrainian Christian Democratic Party and the Young Ukraine went to the elections under its original name and led by the former deputy speaker of the Ukrainian parliament (Verkhovna Rada) Viktor Musiyaka. The bloc \"Forward, Ukraine!\" proved to be an unsuccessful political project gathering only 1.73% at the elections and receiving no representation. Next year Viktor Musiyaka transformed the bloc into a party with the same name. In 2012 another party with the same name Ukraine - Forward! led by Natalia Korolevska copied the statute of the \"Forward, Ukraine!\" and also failed to place any representation in parliament in 2012.\n\nAs a political party \"Forward, Ukraine!\" was registered by the Justice Ministry on May 13, 1999.\n\nAt the 2002 elections, the party was part of the Viktor Yushchenko Bloc Our Ukraine. \"Forward, Ukraine!\" in parliament was represented only by its leader Viktor Musiyaka.\n\nAt the 2006 elections it decided to participate alone gathering only 6,934 votes (0.02%).\n\nAt the 2007 elections, the party joined Viktor's Yushchenko Bloc once more within the Yuriy Lutsenko's People's Self-Defense. Being part of the Our Ukraine alliance the party received 6 out of 72 parliamentary seats that were won by the alliance. Parliamentary mandates were received by Oleh Novikov, Kateryna Lukianova, Kyrylo Kulykov, Serhiy Kharovsky, Yuriy Hrymchak, and Serhiy Lutsenko.\n\nIn an interview with the Silski Visti (Village News) newspaper on 29 January 2009 interior minister Yuriy Lutsenko declared that Civil Movement \"People's Self-Defense\" as an insurgent, protesting, and not very structured civil movement has ceased to exist\". Lutsenko also said he was planning to direct the organisational changes of Forward, Ukraine!.\n\nThe party supported Yulia Tymoshenko as presidential candidate in the 2010 Ukrainian presidential election. The party did not support the dismissal of the second Tymoshenko Government.\n\nAt the ninth congress of the Forward, Ukraine! Party on February 26, 2010 the decision was taken to rename the party. Justice Minister Oleksandr Lavrynovych signed a relevant decree April 20, 2010.\n\nOn August 4, 2010 party leader Yuriy Lutsenko declared that the party would participate in the 2010 local elections in collaboration with All-Ukrainian Union \"Fatherland\" on joined lists. But eventually the party did independently participate in the election. Now with much success, the party won no representatives in Oblast Councils (regional parliaments); its biggest success was winning seats in the city council of several towns in the Lviv Oblast.\n\nThe party announced it will be merged into All-Ukrainian Union \"Fatherland\" in December 2011. This process started late December 2011. As of mid-April 2013 there have been no reports about the party holding a congress to pass a decision on this merge. And the party was still registered at the Ukrainian Ministry of Justice.\n\nThe party competed on one single party under \"umbrella\" party \"Fatherland\", together with several other parties, during the 2012 parliamentary elections During the election this list won 62 seats (25.55% of the votes) under the proportional party-list system and another 39 by winning 39 simple-majority constituencies; a total of 101 seats in Parliament.\n\nOn 1 July 2014 the party was officially renamed \"Third Ukrainian Republic\". New party leader Roman Bezsmertnyi (that day) stated to materialise the \"ideas of Yuriy Lutsenko\" by active citizens who had rallied around Lutsenko\". Instead, he also said that Lutsenko was not a member of the party; but he would head the party if Lutsenko would not join the party Solidarity. According to Bezsmertnyi Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko was at the time negotiating with Lutsenko to make him party leader of Solidarity. Bezsmertnyi assured that if Lutsenko would become party leader of Solidarity he and his fellow and Third Ukrainian Republic members would \"think whether to go to the polls without our leader\". On 27 August 2014 Lutsenko was elected party leader of Solidarity (that party was renamed Bloc of Petro Poroshenko the same day).\n\nThe party did not participate in the 2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election.\n\n\n"}

It was originally registered in August 1999 and dissolved in March 2012 after it had merged with the Party of Regions on 17 March 2012. Since late 2009 the party was and is the main vehicle of billionaire Serhiy Tihipko. After the parties merger Tihipko became a member of the Party of Regions. On 7 April 2014 the political council of this party expelled Tihipko from the Party of Regions.\n\nThe party claimed to have over 80,000 members in mid-May 2010.\n\nIn the 2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election the party won one constituency parliamentary seat.\n\nFounded on 19 June 1999 as Labour Party Ukraine it did not participate in the legislative elections of 30 March 2002.\n\nIn the 2006 elections, the party failed as part of \"Bloc Borys Olijnyk and Myhailo Syrota\" to win parliamentary representation (the Bloc won 0,08% of the votes).\n\nIn the 2007 parliamentary elections the party was part of the Lytvyn Bloc alliance, that won 20 out of 450 seats.\n\nOn 28 November 2009, at the 10th Congress, Labour Party Ukraine was renamed Strong Ukraine.\n\nStrong Ukraine endorsed its new leader Serhiy Tihipko (former partyleader of Labour Ukraine), also elected in November 2009, in the 2010 Ukrainian presidential election. Fellow billionaire Oleksandr Kardakov was another influential member of the party.\n\nOn 22 February 2010, during a party congress, the party announced it would compete in the 2012 Ukrainian parliamentary election not as part of the Lytvyn Bloc but in an electoral alliance with the party Information Ukraine.\n\nOn 11 March 2010 party leader Tihipko was elected as one of six deputy Prime Ministers (in charge of economic issues) in the Azarov Government.\n\nA March 2010 poll predicted that the party would get 7.3% of the vote at the 2012 Ukrainian parliamentary election. A May 2010 poll by the \"Kyiv International Institute of Sociology\" showed that the party had the greatest support among voters in central Ukraine (11%), and less supported in the west and south (7%); the lowest number of this party's supporters was in east Ukraine (5%). At the 2010 local elections the party gained about 6% of the votes nationwide.\n\nIn the 2010 local elections the party won representative in 20 of the 24 regional parliaments and in the Supreme Council of Crimea.\n\nIn May 2011 the rating of the party had dropped to about 5% in election polls.\n\nIn August 2011 Tihipko and Prime Minister (and a Party of Regions (POR) leader) Mykola Azarov announced that Strong Ukraine and POR are going to team up and eventually Strong Ukraine will be merged into POR. Tihipko will become a POR member along with other Strong Ukraine representatives. Mid-December 2011 Tihipko predicted the unification process would be completed late January 2012; but he also warned that if \"problematic issues\" would not be solved Strong Ukraine would not merge. The parties merged on 17 March 2012. According to Sociological group \"RATING\" the party would have collected 3.1% of the votes if Ukrainian parliamentary election would have occurred in February 2012. In August 2012 experts believed potential voters of Tihipko and his Strong Ukraine! shifted their allegiance to Ukraine – Forward!. In the 28 October 2012 parliamentary elections Ukraine – Forward won 1.58% of the national votes and no constituencies and thus failed to win parliamentary representation.\n\nIn March 2014 Tihipko became a self-nominated candidate for President of Ukraine in the 2014 presidential election. On 29 March a Party of Regions convention supported Mykhailo Dobkin's nomination as a presidential candidate. On 7 April 2014 the political council of the party expelled Tihipko from the party. He then accused that the party had \"been turned into a branch of a specific financial and industrial group, a private enterprise\". On 23 April 2014 Tihipko announced that Strong Ukraine would be revived and that its merger with Party of Regions had been \"a mistake\".\n\nOn 5 August 2014 the party held its first Congress since its re-establishment.\n\nIn the 2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election Tihipko headed the party list of the party, followed by former government minister Valeriy Khoroshkovskyi. In the election the party failed to clear the 5% election threshold (it got 3.11% of the votes) but did win one constituency seat and thus one parliamentary seat.\n\nAccording to Tihipko the party is \"patriotic but not nationalistic\". Tihipko has stated he wants to \"unite the country\".\n\nConcerning the War in Donbass, on 5 August 2014 Tihipko said that in March and April 2014 the Yatsenyuk Government wasted a chance to resolve the conflict through negotiations, and that by early August 2014 this was no longer an option. He also stated that \"Terrorists\" and their supporters in the east of the country had passed a \"point of no return\". He supports a professional Ukrainian army to prevent the conflict spreading to other parts of the country. The party seeks a peaceful resolution to the conflict by negotiating with Russia through European mediators but not directly with the pro-Russian combatants.\n\n"}

Another Russian Private Opera production in 1898 was conducted by Sergei Rachmaninoff, while the Bolshoi Theatre presented the opera in 1909 conducted by Vyacheslav Suk.\n\n\"Note\": The Village-Head (Голова, \"Golova\") is usually translated \"Mayor\". \"Pannochka\" is a diminutive of \"Panna\", a title in Polish and Ukrainian for an unmarried lady.\n\n\"Village street outside Hanna's hut; evening\"\n\nThe people sing a folksong-game. After they disperse, Levko plays the bandura and sings outside Hanna's window. When she steps outside, she's afraid that people will be watching them. After some endearing exchanges, she asks about the old house across the way, over the pond. He tells her that a widower used to live there; his daughter (Pannochka), lived with him, and he decided to marry again. The new stepmother turned out to be a witch, and caused the father to banish his daughter from the house. In sorrow she drowned herself in the pond and became leader of the other rusalki (drowned maidens). One night, while they were all dancing in the moonlight, they saw the witch walking by, grabbed her, and pulled her into the water. The story goes that, now, when someone comes by the pond, Pannochka asks the person to point out which of them is the stepmother.\n\nThe story over, Hanna goes inside, and some maidens come around singing a sad \"rusalka\" song. In stumbles the drunken Kalenik on his way home; he tries dance the hopak and to kiss the girls, but they send him away to the Mayor's house, tricking him into thinking that it's his own.\n\nWhen all is clear, the Mayor sneaks in, calling for Hanna; from the side, Levko notices that someone is there, and watches. The Mayor, who has his eyes on marrying Hanna, tries to impress her with his oft-repeated story about being a guide for Catherine the Great, but Hanna rebuffs him, sends him off, and goes inside. Levko calls the village lads together and teaches them a song to mock the Mayor and use in playing a trick on him.\n\n\"Scene 1: Interior of the Mayor's hut; late evening\"\n\nThe Mayor and his sister-in-law are entertaining the Distiller at dinner. The Distiller will soon be tearing down the old house by the pond to build a distillery. Kalenik mistakenly bursts in and causes a mild disturbance; then a rock breaks through a window, causing the Mayor to curse the unseen perpetrator outside. In superstitious alarm the Distiller warns the Mayor against such language, relating the story of his late mother-in-law and the ghost that haunted her because of her cursing at him in life. Suddenly, outside, the village lads start singing the taunting song that Levko taught them. The wind blows out the lights, and in the commotion the Mayor captures someone he thinks is the perpetrator, and locks \"him\" up in a side room. The Clerk enters to report that the lads are running about the village and that he has captured their leader. The Mayor, in disbelief, calls for a light, and they open the locked room. Out comes the Sister-in-Law, sobbing and not a little enraged. She goes outside. The Clerk, the Distiller, and the Mayor set off to find the scoundrel once and for all.\n\n\"Scene 2: Village street outside the Clerk's hut; moonlit night\"\n\nOutside the Clerk's hut, where the alleged true perpetrator is locked up, the three approach in trepidation. Crossing themselves against Satan, they open the door, and again out comes the Sister-in-Law, infinitely more angry than before. Then the village police arrive, holding Kalenik mistakenly as prisoner. With the police afraid to proceed, the Mayor threatens them with the wrath of the commissar, and they run off in obedience.\n\n\" Shore of the lake near the old gentleman's house; luminous moonlit night\"\n\nBeside the pond, Levko sings to his absent beloved, then asks the moon to shine its light on the path to her abode. A window opens in the old house, and Pannochka appears, begging Levko to sing further. He doesn't seem to notice her at first, but a strange feeling comes over him, and he sings again. Then the rusalki appear on the shore and dance. Overcoming his astonishment, Levko joins in singing their round-dance, while Pannochka begs Levko to find the stepmother-witch.\n\nThen the rusalki begin to play the game called \"Raven.\" The first raven-maiden finds that she cannot continue, and Levko realizes that she can't be the witch. But the second player of that role – the stepmother – exposes her true self; Levko points her out, and the other rusalki jump on her and drag her down to the depths of the pond. In gratitude, Pannochka gives Levko a letter to show to his father, and disappears as dawn breaks. Given that he cannot read, he does not know what the letter contains.\n\nThe Mayor and the policemen arrive and grab Levko. The Mayor is surprised to find that the disguised miscreant is his own son. Levko shows his father the letter, which is passed on to the Clerk to read out loud. The letter turns out to be from the commissar, and instructs the Mayor to allow his son to marry Hanna. As the villagers come on the scene to greet the new day, Levko invents the story that the commissar will be coming for dinner, and the Mayor, puffed up with his own importance, gives in to the marriage. Levko and Hanna say a prayer for Pannochka, Kalenik stumbles in again, and the Sister-in-Law gives the Mayor another verbal brow-beating, as the people celebrate.\n\nAct 1\nAct 2\nAct 3\n\nAct 1 <br>\nAct 2 <br>\n\"Scene 1\" <br>\n\"Scene 2\" <br>\nAct 3 <br>\n\n\n\"May Night\" features the folk character the \"rusalka\", but the work should not be confused with either of the two operas named \"Rusalka\", by Dargomyzhsky (based on Pushkin) and Dvořák (based on Erben and Němcová).

(, \"Ukrajina – Vpered!\") is a political party in Ukraine. From its registration in December 1998 till March 2012 it was named Ukrainian Social Democratic Party. The party has, according to official figures, about 86,000 party members. The official name of the party is: Party of Natalia Korolevska \"Ukraine – Forward!\" ().\n\nUkrainian Social Democratic Party was since its first election in 2002 a long a member of Bloc Yulia Tymoshenko (BYuT) but its leader Korolevska fell out with the BYuT's new leaders and they expelled her party from the bloc in March 2012. As a part of BYuT the party was always represented in the Ukrainian Parliament. But running independently in 2012 it failed to win parliamentary representation.\n\nUkraine – Forward! is seen as a pro-business party and the party has campaigned for Yulia Tymoshenko's release from jail.\n\nThe party traces its history back to 1994 when the Minister of Justice of Ukraine Vasyl Onopenko created his party, Party of Human Rights, which in January 1995 has united with the Social Democratic Party of Ukraine and the Ukrainian Party of Justice, later named as the Social Democratic Party of Ukraine (united). Onopenko became famous for leaving the office of Minister of Justice in protest to the events of 1995 connected with the burial of the Patriarch Volodymyr and became known as the \"Black Tuesday\". A major break up of the party took place in 1998, after which Onopenko once again created a new party.\n\nThe Ukrainian Social Democratic Party () was founded in 1998 by former members of the Social Democratic Party of Ukraine (united). The first leader of the party was Vasyl Onopenko who in the Presidential elections in 1999 got 0,47% of the votes.\n\nAt the parliamentary elections on 30 March 2002, the party was part of the Yulia Tymoshenko Electoral Bloc alliance. Three members of the party were included to the parliamentary faction of the Yulia Tymoshenko Electoral Bloc: Vasyl Onopenko (MP), Volodymyr Levtsun (MP), Anatoliy Semynoha (director of \"Agro-Ros\").\n\nDuring the parliamentary elections on 26 March 2006 the party also took part in the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc. Out of 129 seats won by the bloc only eight were given to members of the Ukrainian Social Democratic Party.\n\nIn November 2006 Yevhen Korniychuk became the chairman of the party. He served as the First Deputy Justice Minister in the Second Tymoshenko Government.\n\nIn the parliamentary elections on 30 September 2007, the party was again part of the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc., that won 156 out of 450 seats. Again the party only received eight seats in parliament.\n\nIn August 2011 Korniychuk voluntarily resigned from his post in connection with criminal investigations against him. The leadership of Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc had accused him of working together with their arch-rivals Party of Regions. Former member of All-Ukrainian Union \"Fatherland\" (that party was also a member of the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc) Natalia Korolevska was elected party leader on 23 December 2011.\n\nParty leader Korolevska was expelled from the “Bloc Yulia Tymoshenko-Batkivschyna”-faction (formerly BYuT faction) in the Verkhovna Rada (Ukrainian parliament) on 14 March 2012. The same day the party stated on its official website \"We are deeply shocked and outraged by the betrayal of the leadership of the faction \"Bloc Yulia Tymoshenko-Batkivschyna\". These events also made the party leave the Dictatorship Resistance Committee. But it assured it was still \"in opposition to the current regime, the Yanukovych regime\". On 15 March 2012 the Ukrainian Social Democratic Party was expelled from the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc for alleged \"cooperation with the presidential administration and the ruling regime\".\n\nOn the 22 March 2012 party congress the party was renamed \"Party of Natalia Korolevska \"Ukraine – Forward!\"\" (); in short \"Ukraine – Forward!\". Former members of Korolevska's old party All-Ukrainian Union \"Fatherland\" have joined the renamed party since. In June 2012 the party stated it would not cooperate with the Party of Regions in a new parliament.\n\nThe party did participate in the October 2012 parliamentary elections. In March 2012 the parties popularity in opinion polls had reached a level far below above the election threshold (which was raised to 5% in November 2011) with about 1% of the votes predicted to go to the party but in May 2012 the prediction had increased from 1% to 3.8%. Experts believed the party was gaining potential voters from former supporters of Sergiy Tigipko and his Strong Ukraine. Famed Ukrainian footballer Andriy Shevchenko joined the party immediately after his retirement in July 2012; he took second place on the party list for the October 2012 parliamentary elections. During the campaign for this election the party was one of the biggest spenders. The party official reported it had spent US$7.6 million on the election campaign in multi-member constituencies. Political scientist Artem Bidenko estimated that the party had spent some US$150 million on the campaign. In June 2012 the party was advertising on 320 billboards in Kiev alone and on 900 across Ukraine. One of their election billboards claimed that “an average wage of 1,000 euros and a pension of 500 euros” was realistic for Ukraine (the monthly average wage was €300 at the time). In the election the party won 1.58% of the national votes and no constituencies (it had competed in 105 constituencies) and thus failed to win parliamentary representation. On 11 October 2012 the party had filed a lawsuit at Kiev's economic court against the Democratic Initiatives Foundation and Kyiv International Institute of Sociology with a demand that they retract their reports about the low rating of the party; on 29 November 2012 the party revoked this lawsuit.\n\nDespite that in June 2012 the party had stated it would not cooperate with the Party of Regions in a new parliament and in October 2012 had threatened Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych with impeachment Korolevska became Minister of Social Policy of Ukraine in the Party of Regions lead and appointed by Yanukovych second Azarov Government on 24 December 2012.\n\nFor the 2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election, the party joined the Opposition Bloc along with other five parties; in these elections Opposition Bloc won 29 seats.\n\nDuring the campaign for the 2012 Ukrainian parliamentary election the party promises to relieve small and medium business to the maximum possible extent, “an active part of a fair and efficient state”, “securing social justice and high social standards”, “more welfare” and counteraction against “societal rifts along cultural, linguistic, religious and national lines” and they committed to introduce “total citizen control on all government levels”.\n\n"}

After Reznor departed, the band continued on as a power trio with Smith on lead vocals. At this point, the band began performing a number of additional original songs penned by Smith and Nordstrom. Option 30 broke up in 1986\n\nNot long after Reznor left, he joined The Innocent then onto Exotic Birds and finally, forming his own band, Nine Inch Nails.\n\nIn 1985, a CD of original songs was released by the power trio titled, \"Almost Live.\" The CD included mostly live material recorded in Meadville and some additional studio recordings.\n\nIn 1983, the band (with Reznor) recorded a number of demo tracks with local musician and engineer, John Trevethan, at his home studio.\n\nSoon after Reznor's departure, Nordstrom asked Trent to record vocals for some of his songs at a local engineer's studio (not Trevethan's studio). As a fan the local engineer was given the band's other recorded material. After Reznor became famous, the engineer thought there was a market for anything Reznor and in 1997 assembled a CD including tracks recorded at his studio, the previously recorded demo tracks from 1983, and a radio interview from 1984. The unauthorized CD was released in 1997 on the Shriek Records label.\n\nDespite his later career, Reznor had little songwriting input; all songs were written by Smith and Nordstrom, with the exception of \"Ice House\" (a cover of an Icehouse song), \"Lies\" (a cover of a song by The Thompson Twins), and \"Der Kommissar\" (a cover, with English lyrics, of a song by Falco).\n\n\nJim Nordstrom made several attempts at reuniting the band to record more material, but none were successful due to scheduling conflicts.\n\nTim Smith died on October 31, 2009, at age 50. Nordstrom and Nero, joined by Smith's sons Roan (vocals) and Kelly (guitar), performed several Option 30 originals composed by Smith at his wake.\n\n"}

Rimsky-Korsakov incorporated quotations from Mozart's \"Requiem\" and \"Don Giovanni\" into the score. Richard Taruskin has placed this opera in the historical context of the development of the realistic tradition in Russian opera.\n\nThe first performance took place at the Solodovnikov Theater in Moscow, presented by the Moscow Private Russian Opera, Moscow on 7 December 1898 (O.S. 25 November). The conductor was Iosif Truffi and scenic designer was Mikhail Vrubel.\n\nFeodor Chaliapin, who originated the role of Salieri, claimed to have often sung the piece as a monodrama, as the role of Mozart goes no higher than g and was within his range. \n\nIn Britain the first UK performance was presented on 11 October 1927, again with Chaliapin as Salieri, while the first U.S. one took place in Forest Park, Pennsylvania, in 1933. \n\nA recent UK revival took place in August 2016 at the 10th Grimeborn Festival at Arcola Theatre in London, the stage director was Pamela Schermann and musical director was Andrew Charity.\n\n\"Time\": End of the 18th century\n\"Place\": Vienna, Austria\n\nSalieri enjoys high social position as a composer, and has dedicated himself to the service of his art. Secretly, however, he is jealous of Mozart's works because he recognizes their superior quality, especially given what he sees as the \"idle\" character of Mozart. Salieri invites Mozart to dinner and plans to poison him.\n\nMozart and Salieri are dining at an inn. Mozart is troubled by his work on his \"Requiem\", which a stranger in black commissioned from him. Mozart recalls Salieri's collaboration with Pierre Beaumarchais and asks if it could be true that Beaumarchais once poisoned someone, for genius and criminality are surely incompatible. Salieri then surreptitiously pours poison into Mozart's drink. Mozart begins to play at the keyboard, as Salieri begins to cry. Mozart sees this, but Salieri urges Mozart to continue. Mozart begins to feel ill, and leaves. Salieri ends the opera pondering Mozart's belief that a genius could not murder: did not Michelangelo kill for his commissions at the Vatican, or were those idle rumors?\n\nAudio Recordings (\"Mainly studio recordings\")\nSource: www.operadis-opera-discography.org.uk\n\"Motsart i Salyeri (Russian)\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

He began his film career, aged 16, as a clapper-boy.\n\nAfter service with the RAF, he worked as a third assistant director on Ealing Studios productions, then joined Exclusive Studios (later Hammer Films) in 1949.\n\nSangster originally worked as a production assistant at Hammer Films, as well as being an assistant director, second unit director and production manager. After Hammer's success with \"The Quatermass Xperiment\", he was approached to write \"X the Unknown\", to which he replied \"I'm not a writer. I'm a production manager.\" According to him, Hammer Films' response was: \"Well, you come up with a couple of ideas and if we like it, we'll pay you. If we don't like it, we won't pay you. You're being paid as a production manager, so you can't complain.\" Sangster later turned to direction with \"The Horror of Frankenstein\" and \"Lust for a Vampire\" (both 1970) for the studio, but with far less success. His third (and last) film as director was \"Fear in the Night\" (1972), which resurrected the psychological woman-in-peril thriller he had begun with his script for \"Taste of Fear\" (1961). All three of the films he directed featured actor Ralph Bates, a friend of Sangster's and one of Hammer's better-known performers for the company during the 1970s.\n\nSangster scripted and produced two films for Bette Davis, \"The Nanny\" (1965) and \"The Anniversary\" (1968).

The film was directed by Stephen Hopkins for Warner Bros., Village Roadshow Pictures and Dark Castle Entertainment. The music for the film was scored by John Frizzell.\n\nKatherine Winter (Hilary Swank) and colleague Ben (Idris Elba) investigate claims of miracles. In Chile, they examine the corpse of a priest who remains in pristine condition despite being dead for 40 years. Eventually they discover that toxic waste helped preserve the body. \n\nIn Louisiana, Katherine receives a call from a friend, Father Michael Costigan (Stephen Rea), who says that his photographs of her have developed burn marks that when assembled, form a sickle-like symbol \"ㄜ\", a possible warning from God, which she ignores. She meets Doug Blackwell (David Morrissey), a teacher from the nearby town of Haven, who asks Katherine to find out why Haven's river has turned red. The locals believe this is a biblical plague caused by a girl, Loren McConnell (AnnaSophia Robb), who they believe killed her older brother in the river. \n\nThey travel to Haven, where Katherine sees the river is indeed entirely red. Katherine and Doug come across ruins of an old church, which Doug explains was destroyed one hundred years ago by several hurricanes, forcing the entire town to relocate. Meanwhile, Ben witnesses dead frogs seemingly fall from the sky. Doug invites them to spend the night at his house, where he reveals he comes from a long line of only children. That night, their dinner becomes rotted with flies instantly. \n\nKatherine and Ben get a call asking them to come to a nearby farm, where they find that the cows are dying of some unknown disease. Ben begins to question whether the events could actually have biblical causes, but Katherine remains unconvinced. The owner of the farm tells them that the McConnell family would be visited by people who appeared to be Satan worshippers, and that he possibly saw them making a sacrifice of some kind. Later that evening, Katherine tells Doug why she left the church; five years ago, she was an ordained minister. While doing missionary work in the Sudan with her husband and daughter, the locals sacrificed her family, believing they caused a drought. Katherine then has intense dreams that she and Doug have sex.\n\nKatherine goes to talk to Loren. Loren remains silent the whole time. Katherine notices that her leg is soaked in menstrual blood. Katherine helps clean her up and has a vision of Loren turning the river red. Loren's mother appears, asking if Katherine is there to kill Loren. Before she can explain, Loren attacks her and Katherine runs away. Ben and Katherine examine Loren's brother's body, finding the sickle-like symbol branded into his lower back. Test results prove the river contains human blood. The citizens, meanwhile, are shaving their children's heads, due to an outbreak of lice. Ben and Doug try to get the mayor to evacuate the town, but he and his staff are killed with boils. \n\nA posse gathers to kill Loren to try to stop the plagues. Katherine calls Father Costigan, who explains that he has researched a satanic cult which sacrifices every second-born child once they reach puberty to create a \"perfect child with the eyes of the Devil\" to bring them power. He believes that Loren is the devil child. He also states that an angel, who cannot be harmed by the cult, will destroy them. He insists that Katherine is the angel, as the term is sometimes used to mean servants of God. At that moment, a supernatural force burns Costigan's room, killing him. Katherine returns to the McConnell house, where she finds the cult's sacrificial chamber. There, Loren's mother says that Loren is \"his servant\" now, then kills herself. Outside, Katherine finds locusts everywhere. As the townspeople arrive, with Ben and Doug in tow trying to stop them, Loren causes the locusts to kill the posse. Doug runs away and falls in the river; Katherine locks herself in the house; Ben hides in a crypt, where he discovers skeletons and bodies of sacrificed children. He calls Katherine when Loren appears outside.\n\nKatherine finds Ben dead. She confronts Loren as darkness falls and fiery hail and thunder rains from the sky. Katherine is about to kill Loren, when suddenly she says something that Katherine told her own daughter in Sudan. Katherine asks how she can tell what is real. Loren answers \"faith,\" and shows her a vision of the truth. The cult, which actually encompasses the entire town and Doug, are shown trying to kill Loren since she has reached puberty. Loren escaped and her brother Brody stabbed her, but her wound miraculously healed, and Brody died. Katherine realizes that Loren is the angel God sent. She also sees that Doug killed Ben. The townsfolk surround them as Doug tells her that only an ordained servant of God like Katherine can kill Loren. He reveals that his family recruited the entire town into the satanic cult, believing that God had abandoned them because of the natural disasters. He invited Katherine to investigate the plagues because they hoped she would join them, since she had turned her back on God. Katherine refuses. A sudden fire then rains down on the town from God himself, killing the satanists, who all happened to be first born; all coming from a line of only children. Doug grabs Katherine as he is being lifted off the ground and killed, with Katherine being spared.\n\nAs they drive away, Loren reveals that Katherine is pregnant. Katherine realizes that the dreams she had of sex with Doug was actually Doug having drugged and raped her. Since this is her second child, Katherine realizes that her unborn son, fathered by Doug, is the prophesied demonic child.\n\n\nFilming for the movie took place in and around Baton Rouge, Louisiana with many scenes shot in an abandoned WalMart store. Swank convinced the producers to move the film's setting from New England to Louisiana. When Hurricane Katrina occurred midshoot (August 26, 2005), the production of the film was suspended for one week. Many scenes were shot at Ellerslie Plantation near St. Francisville, Louisiana. The DVD special features record that the producers considered shooting in another city, but decided that Louisiana needed the economic benefit of the movie being shot there.\n\nBefore and during the making of the movie, skeptic investigator Joe Nickell was consulted. The type of skeptical investigations by the movie's main character in the first part of the movie is roughly based on Nickell's investigations of claims of the paranormal since 1969.\n\nThe film was originally scheduled to play in theaters on August 5, 2006, then November 5, 2006; it was then switched to March 30, 2007, (the date featured on the above poster), and then to April 5, 2007. It was finally released on April 5, 2007, to coincide with Holy Thursday.\n\n\"The Reaping\" opened in 2,603 theaters and earned $10,025,203 in its opening weekend. The film grossed $25,126,214 in the United States Box Office and $62,771,059 worldwide.\n\nThe score was originally written by Philip Glass, and went as far as the recording; however, the producers were not completely satisfied and decided to give it another try. John Frizzell was then brought in to compose a new score.\n\nThe aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 8% based on 134 reviews, and an average rating of 3.49/10, with the consensus stating: \"It may feature such accomplished actors as Hilary Swank and Stephen Rea, but \"The Reaping\" also boasts the apropos tagline \"What hath God wrought?\". It's schlocky, spiritually shallow, and scare-free.\"\n\nJacqueline Van Rysselberghe, the Mayor of Concepción, Chile, formally objected to the producers of the film over its portrayal of the city in the opening scene. She pointed out that rather than being the dirty underdeveloped tropical city as shown in the movie, Concepción is an industrialized city with many universities and was surprised that such inadequate research of the setting had been carried out for a high budget movie.\n\n"}

In \"Hipparchia's Choice\" (1989) she questions philosophy's pretensions to being a unique practice which achieves a pure clarity: philosophy is inevitably shaped by language, metaphor, and power relations. According to Le Dœuff feminists make a special contribution. Their critique of gender categories in philosophy, science, and the humanities is empirical, philosophical, political, and interdisciplinary. Feminists see clearly how discourses are elevated to the status of 'philosophical' by a process in which social power is involved.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2016458", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2016458", "title": "Majority minority", "text": "Majority minority\n\nA majority-minority or minority-majority area is a term used to refer to a subdivision in which one or more racial and/or ethnic minorities (relative to the whole country's population) make up a majority of the local population.\n\nIn the United States of America, majority-minority area or minority-majority area is a term describing a U.S. state or jurisdiction whose population is composed of less than 50% non-Hispanic whites. Racial data is derived from self-identification questions on the U.S. Census and on U.S. Census Bureau estimates. (See Race and ethnicity in the United States Census). The term is often used in voting rights law to designate voting districts which are altered under the Voting Rights Act to enable ethnic or language minorities \"the opportunity to elect their candidate of choice.\" In that context, the term is first used by the Supreme Court in 1977. The Court had previously used the term in employment discrimination and labor relations cases.\n\n\nFrom colonial times to the early-twentieth century, much of the Lower South had a Black majority. Three Southern states had populations that were majority Black: Louisiana (until about 1890), South Carolina (until the 1920s) and Mississippi (from the 1830s to the 1930s). In the same period, Georgia, Alabama, and Florida had populations that were nearly 50% Black, while Maryland, North Carolina, and Virginia had Black populations approaching or exceeding 40%. Texas' Black population reached 30%.\n\nThe demographics of these states changed markedly from the 1890s through the 1950s, as two waves of the Great Migration led more than 6,500,000 African-Americans to abandon the economically depressed, segregated Deep South in search of better employment opportunities and living conditions, first in Northern and Midwestern industrial cities, and later west to California. One-fifth of Florida's Black population had left the state by 1940, for instance. During the last thirty years of the twentieth century into the twenty-first century, scholars have documented a reverse New Great Migration of Blacks back to southern states, but typically to destinations in the New South, which have the best jobs and developing economies.\n\nThe District of Columbia, one of the magnets for Great Migration Blacks, was long the sole majority-minority federal jurisdiction in the continental U.S. The Black proportion has declined since the 1990s due to gentrification and expanding opportunities, with many Blacks moving to Texas, Georgia, Florida, and Maryland and others migrating to jobs in states of the New South in a reverse of the Great Migration. In 2018, the Black population represented only 44.4% of the population — a considerable decline from 75% in the late-1970s. At the same time, Asian and Hispanic populations have increased in the District, keeping it a majority-minority area.\n\nSince 1965, foreign immigration has spurred increases in the number of majority-minority areas, most notably in California. Its legal resident population was 89.5% 'non-Hispanic white' in the 1940s, but in 2019 was estimated at 36.8% 'non-Hispanic white'.\n\nMany cities in the United States became majority-minority by 2010. Out of the top 15 cities by population, Jacksonville, Florida and Fort Worth, Texas are the only ones not classified as majority-minority.\n\nThe first data for New Mexico was a 5% sample in 1940 which estimated non-Hispanic whites at 50.9%. Hispanics do not constitute a race but an ethnic and cultural group: of respondents who listed Hispanic origin, some listed White race, roughly half gave responses tabulated under \"Some other race\" (e.g. giving a national origin such as \"Mexican\" or a designation such as \"Mestizo\" as race), and much smaller numbers listed Black, Native American, or Asian race.\n\nIn U.S. censuses since 1990, self-identification has been the primary way to identify race. Presumption of race based on countries or regions given in the ancestry question is used only when a respondent has answered the ancestry question but not the race question. The U.S. Census currently defines \"White people\" very broadly as \"people having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa, i.e. Caucasoids. This definition has changed through the years.\n\nAlthough the census attempts to enumerate both citizens and non-citizens, the undocumented immigrant population of the United States has proven hard to quantify; the census uses a 12 million base estimate nationally. However, current estimates based on national surveys, administrative data and other sources of information indicate that the current population may range as high as 20–30 million.\n\nSOURCE: U.S. Census Bureau, 2005 (for the year 2000)\n\nNormally, a state is considered to be majority-minority because of its ethnic/racial makeup, but other criteria are occasionally used, such as religion, disability, or age. For example, the majority of Utah residents are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, a Christian denomination that is a religious minority throughout the rest of the United States. In addition to Utah, Rhode Island and Louisiana, which have Roman Catholic majorities, are the only states in the U.S. where a single denomination constitutes a majority of the population. However, no U.S. state has a majority composed of any non-Christian group, except for Hawaii, where 51.1% of the population follow religions that would be non-mainstream in the rest of the United States. Hawaii is classified as religious majority of \"Unaffiliated\", including agnostics, atheists, humanists, the irreligious, and Secularists (non-practicing).\n\nIn January 2016, CUNY sociologist Richard Alba wrote an article in the American Prospect arguing that the way in which majority-minority calculations are made by the Census are misleading. Anyone with any Hispanic, Asian, or Black ancestry is seen as non-white, even if they also have white ancestry. Alba argues that the incomes, marriage patterns, and identities of people of who are mixed Hispanic-white and Asian-white are closer to those of white people than monoracial Hispanics or Asians. Thus, when the Census says that non-Hispanic whites are projected to be less than 50% of the population by the 2040s, people of mixed-race ancestry are improperly excluded from that category.\n\nWhile the concept exists in other nations, the exact term differs from place to place and language to language.\n\nIn many large, contiguous countries like China, there are many autonomous regions where a minority population is the majority. These regions are generally the result of historical population distributions, not because of recent immigration or recent differences in birth and fertility rates between various groups.\n\nIt is estimated that Europeans first outnumbered Indigenous Australians in Australia in the 1840s. There are still a number of rural and regional towns and communities where Indigenous Australians outnumber Europeans. Anglo-Celtic Australians, who as of 2019, make up 74% of Australia's population, have become a minority in some of Sydney's western suburbs in the late-twentieth century. Fairfield and Cabramatta in Fairfield City Council, Lakemba and Bankstown in the City of Canterbury-Bankstown, and Auburn in Cumberland Council, are one of the largest non-Anglo-Celtic suburbs in Australia. Here is a list of the suburbs in Sydney's metropolitan area where non-Anglo-Celtic ethnic groups are the majority:\n\n\n\nVisible minority majorities in different Canadian municipalities:\n\nBritish Columbia\nOntario\n\n\n\n\nBrazil has become a majority \"non-White\" country as of the 2010 census, together with the federative units of Espírito Santo, the Federal District, Goiás, and Minas Gerais.\n\nThose identifying as White declined to 47.7% (about 91 million people) in the 2010 census from 52.9% (about 93 million people) in 2000 in the entire country. However, in Brazil, this is not simply a matter of origin and birthrate, but identity changes as well. The Black minority did not enlarge its representation in the population to more than 1.5% in the period, while it was mostly the growth in the number of \"pardo\" people (~38% in 2000, 42.4% in 2010) that caused the demographic plurality of Brazil.\n\n\nAfro-Colombians make up roughly about 10–12% of country's overall population, but make up a majority in many areas in the Colombia's Pacific region, especially in Chocó Department, where they make up 80–90% of the population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRussia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2016467", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2016467", "title": "Atlantic Branch", "text": "Atlantic Branch\n\nThe Atlantic Branch is an electrified rail line owned and operated by the Long Island Rail Road in the U.S. state of New York. It is the only LIRR line that runs in the borough of Brooklyn.\n\nPartly underground and partly elevated, the Atlantic Branch runs from Atlantic Terminal in Downtown Brooklyn to Valley Stream, in Nassau County, where it becomes the two-track Long Beach Branch with the two-track Far Rockaway Branch splitting southward just east of the Valley Stream station.\n\nThe section between Atlantic Terminal and Bedford Avenue is underground along Atlantic Avenue. From there the line is elevated above the median of Atlantic Avenue to Dewey Place (with a stop at Nostrand Avenue) before returning underground. At East New York the line rises to street level to cross above the north-south, freight only Bay Ridge Branch, then descends once more to Jamaica. Between East New York and Jamaica, the intact but closed station at Woodhaven Junction is visible.\n\nAt 121st Street in Richmond Hill, Queens, the line rises to street level and passes the Morris Park Facility before joining the elevated Main Line at Jamaica. Immediately east of Jamaica, the line turns southeast, ducking beneath the eastward Main Line tracks. It curves parallel to the Montauk Branch after a few miles and continues next to it to Valley Interlocking in Valley Stream.\n\nThe current Atlantic Branch is the successor to two separate lines: the Brooklyn and Jamaica Railroad (opened 1836) along Atlantic Avenue from Flatbush Avenue to Jamaica, and the South Side Railroad of Long Island (opened 1867) from Jamaica to Valley Stream.\n\nThe Brooklyn and Jamaica Railroad opened the line from South Ferry to what is now 151st Street in Jamaica on April 18, 1836.\n\nInitially the line turned halfway between Classon and Franklin Avenues, running halfway between Herkimer Street and Schuyler Street (now Atlantic Avenue) along the line of the present Herkimer Place. It turned slightly to the southeast near Howard Avenue, crossing the centerline of Schuyler Street about one-third of the way between Hopkinson Avenue (Thomas Boyland Street) and Paca Avenue (Rockaway Avenue). It crossed into the town of New Lots just beyond Stone Avenue (Mother Gaston Boulevard).\n\nThe Atlantic Branch was one of the first lines in the LIRR system slated to be electrified. In anticipation of this the entire line to Jamaica was to be grade separated. Between 1903 and 1905 the line was depressed into a tunnel from Flatbush Avenue to Bedford Avenue, then placed on an elevated viaduct from Bedford Avenue to Ralph Avenue then depressed back into a tunnel until Manhattan Crossing located just west of East New York station. At East New York the line returned to grade level then rose onto another elevated viaduct until Atkins Ave. The rest of the line from Atkins Ave to Morris Park located just west of Jamaica remained at grade level along Atlantic Avenue with numerous grade crossings with the anticipation of grade separating the line later on. Additionally a new terminal and yard was built at Flatbush and Atlantic Avenues. Electric service commenced in 1905 with the line consisting of two tracks between Flatbush Avenue and Woodhaven Junction and four tracks beyond that point to Jamaica.\n\nLIRR then ran two services along the line: the traditional commuter type services from points on eastern Long Island to Flatbush Avenue, along with what was called the \"local\" rapid transit type service, frequent elevated/subway like service at lower fare between Flatbush Ave and Queens Village (although referred to as a rapid transit type service, standard LIRR cars were used, and the service was operated by railroad rules, as opposed to rapid transit). At this time the line from Jamaica to East New York had many more stations along Atlantic Avenue spaced at closer intervals, much like an elevated/subway rapid transit line. The four tracks between Jamaica and Woodhaven Junction lent itself to this service with rapid transit trains using the outer two tracks while commuter trains used the inner two tracks.\n\nIn November 1925 25 \"local\" trains left Brooklyn each weekday for Queens Village, 12 more ran to Hillside, and 16 more ran to Jamaica. All trains made all stops, 15 of them west of Queens Village. Fare was probably 10 cents for 13 miles Queens Village to Brooklyn, compared to about 40 cents on \"express\" LIRR trains making six or seven stops (but a monthly ticket good on any train was $7.10).\n\nFor a while the LIRR operated joint service along the Atlantic Branch with the Brooklyn Rapid Transit company (BRT) consisting of two connections, one with the Fifth Ave El at Flatbush Avenue, and another with the Broadway and Lexington Avenue els with a connection built at Chestnut Street in Brooklyn. This allowed BRT trains to access the Rockaways and Manhattan Beach, while affording the LIRR a connection into Manhattan to the BRT terminal located at Park Row over the Brooklyn Bridge (this service predated the opening of the East River Tunnels to Penn Station). Nevertheless the Interstate Commerce Commission ended this service in 1916 when they classified different operating standards between rapid transit trains and regular heavy rail railroads which the LIRR was classified as.\n\nBy the late 1930s it was clear that the rest of the line needed to be grade separated. Much of the surrounding area along Atlantic Avenue in Ozone Park and Richmond Hill began their suburban development leading to more traffic along Atlantic Avenue which was plagued by the lines many grade crossings. The City of New York along with the LIRR thus allocated the funds to depress the rest of the line from Morris Park to East New York in a tunnel. Building of the tunnel commenced in 1939 (although plans to build the tunnel date back to 1893) with two of the line's four tracks being pulled out of service and the rapid transit service being discontinued.\nOn December 28, 1942 the tunnel was completed and opened with the two remaining at-grade tracks pulled out of service. Around this time Atlantic Avenue was raised over the East New York station via a viaduct that separated the road and the railroad. The elevated trestle from East New York to Atkins Avenue was also demolished as it had been included in the new tunnel to Jamaica. Only one station was included in the new tunnel: Woodhaven Junction, where the Atlantic Branch crossed under the Rockaway Beach Branch. An interlocking and track connection was built just west of the Woodhaven Junction station to connect the two lines, but these closed after the abandonment of the Rockaway Beach Branch between 1955 and 1962.\n\nThe portion east of Jamaica was opened by the South Side Railroad of Long Island on October 28, 1867, as part of its initial line from Jamaica to Babylon. With the consolidation of the South Side into the Long Island Rail Road system in 1876, all passenger trains were rerouted to use the LIRR main line from Berlin Junction (west of Jamaica) to Rockaway Junction and the LIRR's Rockaway Branch to Springfield Junction, where it crossed the South Side. This change took effect Sunday, June 25, 1876, and resulted in the closure of the South Side's Berlin, Beaver Street (Jamaica), Locust Avenue, and Springfield stations. This formed the current configuration, where the Montauk Branch follows this route, mostly ex-South Side, and the Atlantic Branch (then the Old Southern Road) uses the old South Side to Springfield Junction.\n\nThe line was soon reopened due to a lawsuit, but closed again by Austin Corbin as of January 6, 1881.\n\nEffective May 17, 1906, when an electrified third track opened alongside the Montauk Division from Springfield Junction to Valley Stream, the Old Southern Road and this new track became part of the Atlantic Division.\n\nEast of Valley Stream, the Far Rockaway Branch continues to and the Long Beach Branch continues to .\n\n"}
{"id": "2016470", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2016470", "title": "Johnny Valentine", "text": "Johnny Valentine\n\nJohn Theodore Wisniski (September 22, 1928 – April 24, 2001), better known by his ring name Johnny Valentine, was an American professional wrestler with a career spanning almost three decades. He has been inducted into four halls of fame for his achievements in wrestling. Wisniski is the father of professional wrestler Greg \"The Hammer\" Valentine.\n\nHe held numerous regional titles, including the NWA United States Heavyweight Championship. He had long running rivalries with Bobo Brazil, Pat O'Connor, Buddy Rogers, Antonio Rocca, Lou Thesz, Harley Race, The Sheik, Wahoo McDaniel, Fritz von Erich, Bruno Sammartino, Johnny Powers, Antonio Inoki and Jack & Jerry Brisco. He alternated between being a villain and a hero (babyface) during the Golden Era in the 1940s through 1960s of wrestling.\n\nIn 1975, he was injured in a plane crash; he suffered a broken back and was forced to retire from wrestling. He worked briefly as a manager before retiring altogether. He suffered from several health problems during his retirement, which worsened considerably after a fall in 2000. He died the following year.\n\nValentine debuted as a professional wrestler in 1947, wrestling Karl Nowena in Buenos Aires. In order to make the matches as believable as possible Valentine insisted the men he faced in the ring hit him as hard as possible. From that he earned a strong reputation as being a very tough man. On New Year's Day, 1950, Buddy Rogers defeated Valentine in the finals of a United States title tournament. He also competed in the NWA's Capitol Wrestling territory. Jerry Graham, who was a co-holder of the Northeast version of the NWA United States Tag Team Championship, selected Valentine in November 1959 to take over the title from Graham's injured partner. They were beaten for the title belts the following April, but Valentine took on a new partner, Buddy Rogers, to regain the championship by defeating The Fabulous Kangaroos on November 19, 1960. Wisniski's rivalry with the Kangaroos continued, as the Kangaroos regained the belts in a rematch one week later. Valentine went over one year without holding a championship before teaming with a new partner, this time Bob Ellis, to defeat the Kangaroos and take back the championship. Valentine & Ellis lost the belts to Buddy Rogers & Handsome Johnny Barend in a match where Arnold Skoaland subbed for Ellis, but the belts were still up, on Washington, DC TV. Rogers & Barend then defeated the real team of Valentine & Ellis 2 pins to 1 in a main event at Madison Square Garden.\n\nIn Toronto, Valentine and three different partners won the International Tag Team title during 1963. Valentine left the territory without dropping the title. He wrestled in Japan in the mid-1960s and had a series of matches against Antonio Inoki. Those matches are regarded as the bouts that helped build Inoki into an elite wrestler in Japan, as Valentine was the highest-profile foreign wrestler Inoki had ever faced at the time. Valentine put over Inoki in the matches, dropping the Toronto version of the NWA United States Heavyweight Championship to him catapulting Inoki's career in the process. Valentine also continued to wrestle in the former Capitol Wrestling territory, which had since been renamed the World Wide Wrestling Federation. While there, he had one last reign with what was then known as the WWWF United States Tag Team Championship, as he teamed with Tony Parisi to hold the belts for seven months in 1966. Valentine later turned on Parisi, however. This ignited a brief feud with Bruno Sammartino, who was billed as Parisi's cousin. Because Valentine was also wrestling in Texas at the same time, he got only sporadic main event matches against Sammartino during this feud.\n\nValentine then moved on to the Florida territory, where he won the NWA Florida Heavyweight Championship three times. In Georgia, he defeated Tim Woods for the NWA Georgia Heavyweight title, on May 10, 1968, and repeated his win in a match against Doug Gilbert (not to be confused with the Doug Gilbert who was not yet born) to retake the title. In Missouri, Valentine competed for the Missouri Heavyweight Championship in a tournament to determine the inaugural champion. He defeated Baron von Raschke before withdrawing from the tournament due to focus his efforts on the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. After Harley Race won the tournament and the title belt, Valentine defeated him to win the championship on January 19, 1973. He dropped the belt to Terry Funk the following month. Because Funk used a chair as a weapon in front of the referee, fans demanded a rematch. Valentine was unable to compete due to heart problems, however, so Gene Kiniski took his place and won the belt from Funk. In October 1972, Valentine defeated Jacques Rougeau for the International Heavyweight Championship, but was stripped of the title in January 1973, after he no-showed the rematch.\n\nIn the National Wrestling Federation, Valentine defeated Johnny Powers for the NWF North American Heavyweight Championship on September 1, 1972. Powers beat Valentine for the title in October, but Valentine won the title again from Abdullah the Butcher on October 19. He was stripped of the title following a match with Johnny Powers. On November 23, he captured the title from Powers, but lost it again in January. In the Japan Wrestling Association, Valentine won the International Tag Team title on February 22, 1973, and then the United National Heavyweight Championship on March 2. He lost the Tag title on March 6, and the United Heavyweight title on March 8. Back in the National Wrestling Federation, in August 1973, Valentine beat Jacques Rougeau, Sr. to win the North American Heavyweight Championship. He lost it to Johnny Powers in late 1973.\n\nIn Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling, Valentine was awarded the Mid Atlantic Heavyweight Championship in January 1974, after Jerry Brisco left to work in Japan. Bearcat Wright defeated Valentine in a boxing match to win the title on May 13, 1974. He won the championship from Sonny King on November 4, and won the United States Heavyweight Championship on July 4, 1975.\n\nAfter Valentine was paralyzed in a plane crash, he remained active in professional wrestling as a manager in Paul Boesch's Texas-based promotion. From his wheelchair, Valentine managed Dale Hey, who competed as Dale Valentine in a storyline that saw the two promoted as brothers. The storyline did not last long, however.\n\nValentine was originally from Maple Valley, Washington. He is said to have come from a dysfunctional family. He was a devout Christian for many years. He was married in the early 1950s and the marriage lasted 20 years until they divorced. He was later married to a woman named Sharon, who worked across the street from his apartment in the mid 1970s when they met. She later visited John as he was recovering in hospital from his 1975 plane crash. Some time later, the relationship ended as he didn't want her to see him in his condition. Years later, while on braces and crutches, he managed to drive around her neighbourhood for hours until he found her house. As he slowly walked to the front door, Sharon's daughter announced to Sharon that Johnny Valentine was in front of their home. Sharon, having been ill, refused to go to the door and hid. Valentine insisted he wouldn't leave until he saw her. When she finally came to the door, he asked her to marry him and she accepted. Following John's death, Sharon planned to write a book titled \"A Never Ending Love Story of a Wrestler and His Wife\" about their life together. He also had a son from a long ago previous relationship, Greg Valentine, who has wrestled professionally since 1970 and is best known as Greg \"The Hammer\" Valentine. Ric Flair, who wrestled with Wisniski, has described him as a quiet person who kept to himself. He was also known for making his demands clear to employers and not backing down, and many stories continue to circulate about practical jokes, or ribs, that he played on his fellow wrestlers.\n\nOn October 4, 1975, Valentine was in a private airplane (a twin-engined Cessna 310)\nwith Ric Flair, David Crockett, Bob Bruggers, and Tim Woods. Because of the weight of the passengers, the pilot realized that he could not take off without reducing the amount of fuel the plane was carrying. Part way through the flight, the aircraft ran out of fuel and crashed near Wilmington, North Carolina. The crash broke Flair's back, Bob Bruggers, Wisniski, and pilot Michael Farkus also broke their backs. A bone fragment became embedded in his spinal column, paralyzing him for life and forcing him to have a clamp implanted to hold the bones in his back together. Farkus died a year later having never awakened from a coma. Crockett and Woods suffered less serious injury.\n\nIn August 2000, Valentine fell from his front porch, and had a number of injuries and complications. These included a fractured back, pneumonia, staph infection, collapsed lungs and kidney failure. Due to his many injuries he slipped into a coma. At one point he came out of it while his wife was singing to him. He began singing himself but fell back into the coma. His wife had purchased medical insurance through a health maintenance organization (HMO), but the organization was unwilling to pay for Wisniski's extended stay in the hospital. As a result, Lou Thesz's wife convinced the Cauliflower Alley Club to help contribute to Wisniski's medical bills. Those medical bills reached close to a million dollars.\n\nValentine has been recognized for his wrestling career by several sources. Shortly after his death, he was named the 2001 recipient of \"Pro Wrestling Illustrated\"'s Stanley Weston Award, a recognition given for lifetime achievement in professional wrestling. He has also been inducted into several halls of fame. He was a member of the inaugural class of inductees to the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame in 1996. He is also a member of the Stampede Wrestling Hall of Fame. In 2006, he was inducted into the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame, and he joined the St. Louis Wrestling Hall of Fame the following year.\n\nValentine died peacefully in River Oaks, Texas on April 24, 2001. He was 72. His wife Sharon kept his ashes in her bedroom. She died in 2013.\n\n\n"}

During the 1924 games, it hosted the athletics, some of the cycling, some of the horse riding, gymnastics, tennis, some of the football, rugby, and two of the modern pentathlon events (running, fencing). The Olympic races involving Harold Abrahams and Eric Liddell which are portrayed in the film Chariots of Fire were run here, although the stadium was not used for the film. \n\nIt was later expanded to a capacity of over 60,000. Colombes was also the venue for the 1938 World Cup Final between Italy and Hungary, and also hosted the home team's two matches in the tournament.\n\nColombes hosted a number of French Cup finals and home games of the French national football and rugby union teams into the 1970s. It remained the country's largest stadium until the renovated Parc des Princes was inaugurated in 1972.

Participants will not purchase anything and seek to form a lengthy chain of non-shoppers, continually weaving and \"whirling\" through a maze of store aisles for up to an hour at a time. Participants describe their actions as \"a collective reclamation of space that is otherwise only used for buying and selling\". Whirl-Marters seek to mimic and mock what they perceive as the absurdity of the shopping process.\n\nThe activity was founded by the group \"Breathing Planet Troupe\" at a Wal-Mart store in Troy, New York, US on April 1, 2001. The group was seeking to respond to an article from AdBusters magazine that called for foolish activities in conjunction with April Fool's Day. Since that time, Whirl-Mart activities have spread to many other communities around the world, including Texas, Iowa, Arizona, and Pennsylvania in the US, Canada, and the United Kingdom. It is often \"celebrated\" at noon on the first Saturday or Sunday of the month. Whirl-Marters are often very loosely organized, describing themselves as open to anyone wishing to show up and participate.\n\nIn addition to being \"just darned fun\", the activity provides a legal outlet for would-be protesters to address \"cathedral(s) of consumption\" like Wal-Mart. Consequently, experienced Whirl-Marters (when confronted by security or store management) do not admit to being protestors and instead maintain that they are engaged in a peaceful \"consumption awareness ritual\". Whirl-Marters do not aim to block store aisles or interfere with legitimate shoppers, and typically will not speak unless addressed. Their aim is to create a non-disruptive, peaceful demonstration of how ridiculous they see Western consumerism to be. Participants are non-confrontational in seeking to make themselves silent examples rather than active propagandists. Some variations of the Whirl-Mart protest involve filling carts but then simply abandoning them or, when checking out, claiming to have forgotten the money to purchase the items in the overflowing cart, leaving said cart for the employees to clean up.\n\nParticipants claim they can generally talk their way out of being evicted from the store's corporate property (though the involvement of law enforcement officials in forcibly removing Whirl-Marters is not unheard of). When employees approach, Whirl-Mart participants generally scatter to various store aisles, forcing management or security to confront them individually. Participants will very rarely admit to or even address the topic of non-violent protest of commercialism or materialism, preferring to present themselves as would-be shoppers who are \"still looking for something to buy\" after spending up to an hour wandering aimlessly through a warehouse-sized superstore. Whirl-Marters often wear an identifying shirt or smock; in most jurisdictions it is not legally considered soliciting to wear a garment advertising a product, service, or cause.\n\nSome participants have attempted to document their activities with cameras or video recorders. The film or tape from these are often seized by store authorities. A few websites have video documenting Whirl-Mart events; however, in general, superstores do not permit cameras or video recorders on their premises—excluding security cameras used by the corporation itself.\n\n\n"}

It is the primary terminal for the Far Rockaway, Hempstead, and West Hempstead Branches. The terminal is located in the City Terminal Zone, the LIRR's Zone 1, and thus part of the CityTicket program.\n\nThe station was originally named \"Brooklyn\" in 1852, twenty years after the line was established as the Brooklyn and Jamaica Railroad, and wasn't originally a terminus. The original terminus was South Ferry. When LIRR subsidiary New York and Jamaica Railroad built a new line between Hunter's Point and Jamaica in 1861, the main line was relocated there, and the line was abandoned west of East New York, in compliance with Brooklyn's ban on steam railroads. West of East New York, the tracks were taken over by horse car lines.\n\nThe Brooklyn station designation was replaced by the \"Flatbush Avenue\" station on July 2, 1877. That same summer local Atlantic Avenue rapid transit trains began to stop there on August 13. The old depot was renovated between July–August 1878, when it began serving the Brooklyn, Flatbush and Coney Island Railroad. It was rebuilt again in June 1880. The headquarters for the Long Island Express Company was installed there in 1882, and gave the station a series of tracks that would later be known as the \"EX Yard.\" In 1888, the Union Elevated Railway built an elevated railway line and station that connected to the LIRR station, which was better known as the Atlantic Avenue (BMT Fifth Avenue Line). The Union Elevated eventually became part of the Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Corporation. Further rebuilding took place again in 1893.\n\nBetween 1904 and 1906, the Carlton Avenue Freight Yards were replaced by the Vanderbilt Avenue Freight Yards. This was just a portion of a major improvement project that included the complete reconstruction of the station. The second depot opened on April 1, 1907 with the depot at street level and the tracks installed underground. The station had a lobby that was larger than most LIRR stations, and contained subway type entrances to the tracks. It also served as a post office building until 1925, and contained a baggage depot, express buildings, some meat houses which were inherited from the previous version of the station, and a merchandise terminal for \"less than carload freight\" added on in 1908. The Interborough Rapid Transit Company built a subway line called the Eastern Parkway Line and a station on Atlantic Avenue, that connected to the station on May 1, 1908. The BMT also built two more subway lines on Pacific Street along the Fourth Avenue Line on June 22, 1915, and Atlantic Avenue along the Brighton Line on August 1, 1920. The connection to the BMT Fifth Avenue Line was lost on May 31, 1940.\n\nThe station was refurbished and the exterior was sandblasted in the early 1940s. The decline of rail service after World War II led to the station's gradual demise, however. Track #1 was out of service on April 10, 1959. Former express tracks numbers 9-14 (\"EX\" Yard) were taken out of service on March 3, 1971. At some point, the express buildings became a parking garage. Local businesses were still allowed to utilize the station, such as a barber shop, restaurants, candy stores, a snack bar, a podiatrist's office, a dental office, a beauty school, and even a row of telephone booths. Those businesses were gone by 1978. The tracks that were originally numbered from south to north were renumbered from north to south on July 1, 1978. Despite efforts to repaint the lobby in the early-1980s, random vandalism plagued the station interior causing water damage that was so severe, the street level depot was closed in 1988, and portions were razed during the 1990s.\n\nOn January 5, 2010, a new entry pavilion, designed by di Domenico + Partners, opened, providing improved connections between the LIRR, subways, and buses. In March 2010, the station was renamed \"Atlantic Terminal\" after a six-year reconstruction project, during which trains continued to operate.\n\nIn 2014, the LIRR announced that service from Babylon and Hicksville will go directly to Atlantic Terminal during New York Islanders games at Barclays Center. Passengers would normally have to transfer at Jamaica to go to Babylon or Hicksville. However, in preparation for East Side Access project, most service to Atlantic Terminal will be provided by a high-frequency shuttle service to and from Jamaica.\n\nDuring the morning rush hour of January 4, 2017, a train overran the bumper block at the end of track 6, injuring 103, none seriously. There were 650 passengers on the train, which had originated from Far Rockaway. The incident was compared to a September 2016 train crash at Hoboken Terminal in Hoboken, New Jersey, wherein a train also overran a bumper block. The accident occurred at about 8:20 a.m. Two carriages of the six-carriage electric multiple unit involved were severely damaged when it collided with the buffer stop at a speed of . The National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Railway Administration opened investigations into the accident.\n\nThe LIRR terminal, one floor below the ground level, has three high-level island platforms adjacent to six tracks. Platform A is ten cars long, but the two eastern-most cars on Track 1 are not accessible due to a large gap between the train and the platform. Platform B is eight cars long. Platform C is six cars long, but Track 6 only has enough space for four cars to meet the platform as it is adjacent to the northbound local platform of the IRT Eastern Parkway Line.\n\nAtlantic Terminal is connected to the New York City Subway's Atlantic Avenue–Barclays Center complex, which is served by the . Buses serving outside the complex include B41, B45, B63, B65, B67, and B103.\n\nThe rail terminal is adjacent to and below the Atlantic Terminal mall and near the Barclays Center, Brooklyn Academy of Music and the Williamsburgh Savings Bank Tower, as well as Brooklyn Technical High School.\n\nThe massive Pacific Park residential, commercial and sports complex, which includes Barclays Center, is being built near the station and above its yard tracks.\n\n\n"}

Berry's advocacy of the right of the small number of settlers to remain in Newfoundland, which was opposed by the British Committee for Trade and Plantations, was an important factor in determining the future course of European settlement in Newfoundland.\n\nBerry was born at Knowstone, North Devon, the second of seven sons of Rev. Daniel Berry (1609–1654), vicar of Knowstone \"cum\" Molland in North Devon by his wife Elizabeth Moore, daughter of Sir John Moore of Moor Hayes in the parish of Cullompton, Devon. Daniel Berry held the benefice freehold and had inherited it from his father, but was violently deprived of his position and livlihood during the Civil War. Sir John in 1684 erected a mural monument in Molland Church, which survives, which relates the injustices suffered by his father in this regard. Daniel's eldest two sons, thus deprived of their prospective patrimony, sought a career at sea, as was common for West-Country youths seeking their fortunes. The Berry family had been established from the reign of King Edward I (1272–1307) near the north coast of Devon as lords of the manor of \"Nerbert\" or \"Narbor\", which manor took their name and became known as \"Berry Narbor\", today known as \"Berrynarbor\".\nYounger branches settled at Braunton, Eastleigh and Chittlehampton, but from which branch the Knowstone family descended is not recorded in the Heraldic Visitations of Devon.\n\nIn Molland Church, Devon, exists a mural monument erected in 1684 by Sir John Berry to his father Rev. Daniel Berry (1609–1654). It is inscribed thus:\n\"Under this monument lieth the body of Daniel Berry, B of D sometime minister of this church and that of the parish of Knowstone wherein he was born, who for his zeal in the support of the Church of England and loyalty to that martyr'd King Charles I was first sequestrated by the then rebels and ever after persecuted 'till he died, being the 18th day of Mar. 1653/4 and of his age 45, leaving behind him 7 sons, Robert, John, Daniel, Nathaniel, Anthony, Philip and Thomas, and two daughters Elizabeth and Anne, by Elizabeth his wife, daughter of John Moore of Moorehays, Esq., who died 13 Octob. 1663, and lieth here likewise interred. The second of their sons, who received the honour of knighthood from his present Majesty K. Ch.2 for his long and many good services at sea, honouring the memory of all orthodox and loyal men of the late times and out of a pious regard of his father's sufferings, erected this monument, 17 day of Jul. AD 1684\"\"\n\nBerry married Rebecca Ventris (d.1696), of the Ventris family of Granhams, Great Shelford, Cambridgeshire, as identified from the arms of Ventris shown on her monument in Stepney Church, London. The Heralds' Visitation of Cambridgeshire gives only a short pedigree of the Ventris family ending before Rebecca's birth, but gives the family's arms as: \"Azure, a dolphin between two bendlets wavy an annulet argent\". She may have been a sister of Sir Peyton Ventris (1645–1691), eldest surviving son of Edward Ventris (d.1649), barrister. Her portrait was painted by Michael Dahl to form a pair with that of her husband. The marriage was without progeny. Rebecca married secondly Thomas Elton of Stratford Bow, London. Her mural monument exists on the east wall of the chancel of St Dunstan's Church, Stepney, and displays an heraldic escutcheon showing the arms of Elton (\"Paly of six, on a bend three mullets\") impaling Ventris. It is inscribed with the following verse recorded by Daniel Lysons in 1795:\n\n\"\"Come ladies ye that would appear,\"<br>\n\"Like angels fine come dress you here,\"<br>\n\"Come dress you at this marble stone,\"<br>\n\"And make this humble grave your own,\"<br>\n\"Which once adorn'd as fair a mind,\"<br>\n\"As ere yet lodged in woman kind.\"<br>\n\"So she was dress'd whose humble life,\"<br>\n\"Was free from pride was free from strife,\"<br>\n\"Free from all envious brawls and jars,\"<br>\n\"Of human life the civil wars,\"<br>\n\"These ne'er disturb'd her peaceful mind,\"<br>\n\"Which still was gentle still was kind.\"<br>\n\"Her very looks her garb her mien,\"<br>\n\"Disclos'd the humble soul within.\"<br>\n\"Trace her through every scene of life,\"<br>\n\"View her as widow virgin wife,\"<br>\n\"Still the same humble she appears,\"<br>\n\"The same in youth the same in years,\"<br>\n\"The same in low and high estate,\"<br>\n\"Ne'er vex'd with this ne'er mov'd with that.\"<br>\n\"Go ladies now and if you'd be\"<br>\n\"As fair as great and good as she,\"<br>\n\"Go learn of her humility.\"\"<br>\n\nA mural monument to Sir John Berry exists in St Dunstan's Church, Stepney, London, on the north wall, which he ordered to be erected at a cost of no less than £150. Prince described the monument thus:\n\"\"It is all of white marble of about 10 foot in height and 5 in breadth finely polished. In a nich in the middle stands on a pedestal the effigies of Sir John cut with a campaign wig and a cravat in pure alabaster. Over his head are the arms of his family, underneath on a table of white marble is the following epitaph in black letters\": \n\n\"Ne id nescias lector D(ominus) Joannes Berry Devoniensis dignitate Equestri clarus mari non tantum imperator de rege et patria quod et Barbari norunt bene meritus magnam ob res fortiter gestas adeptus gloriam Famae satur post multas reportatas victorias cum ab aliis vinci non potuit Fatis cessit 14 Febr 1689 baptizatus 7 Jan 1635\"\" (\"Lest thou should not know, O reader, the famed Sir John Berry of Devon, with dignity of a knight, not just ruler of the sea (as well know too the Barbaries) having gained from King and Country well-deserved great glory on account of matters happily conducted, satiated with the glory of fame, after many victories brought home, as with others, was not able to defeat the Fates. He died 14 February 1689, was baptised 7 January 1635\"\")\nThe monument survives, but no longer the pristine white of Prince's description but covered with a yellowish-brown patina.

{"id": "2016505", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2016505", "title": "History of patent law", "text": "History of patent law\n\nThe history of patents and patent law is generally considered to have started with the Venetian Statute of 1474.\n\nThere is some evidence that some form of patent rights was recognized in Ancient Greece. In 500 BCE, in the Greek city of Sybaris (located in what is now southern Italy), \"encouragement was held out to all who should discover any new refinement in luxury, the profits arising from which were secured to the inventor by patent for the space of a year.\" Athenaeus, writing in the third century CE, cites Phylarchus in saying that in Sybaris exclusive rights were granted for one year to creators of unique culinary dishes.\n\nIn England, grants in the form of letters patent were issued by the sovereign to inventors who petitioned and were approved: a grant of 1331 to John Kempe and his Company is the earliest authenticated instance of a royal grant made with the avowed purpose of instructing the English in a new industry. These letters patent provided the recipient with a monopoly to produce particular goods or provide particular services. Another early example of such letters patent was a grant by Henry VI in 1449 to John of Utynam, a Flemish man, for a twenty-year monopoly for his invention.\n\nThe first Italian patent was awarded by the Republic of Florence in 1421. The Florentine architect Filippo Brunelleschi received a three-year patent for a barge with hoisting gear, that carried marble along the Arno River in 1421.\n\nPatents were systematically granted in Venice as of 1450, where they issued a decree by which new and inventive devices had to be communicated to the Republic in order to obtain legal protection against potential infringers. The period of protection was 10 years.\nThese were mostly in the field of glass making. As Venetians emigrated, they sought similar patent protection in their new homes. This led to the diffusion of patent systems to other countries.\nKing Henry II of France introduced the concept of publishing the description of an invention in a patent in 1555. The first patent \"specification\" was to inventor Abel Foullon for \"Usaige & Description de l'holmetre\", (a type of rangefinder.) Publication was delayed until after the patent expired in 1561. Patents were granted by the monarchy and by other institutions like the \"Maison du Roi\" and the Parliament of Paris. The novelty of the invention was examined by the French Academy of Sciences. Digests were published irregularly starting in 1729 with delays of up to 60 years. Examinations were generally done in secret with no requirement to publish a description of the invention. Actual use of the invention was deemed adequate disclosure to the public.\n\nThe English patent system evolved from its early medieval origins into the first modern patent system that recognised intellectual property in order to stimulate invention; this was the crucial legal foundation upon which the Industrial Revolution could emerge and flourish.\n\nBy the 16th century, the English Crown would habitually grant letters patent for monopolies to favoured persons (or people who were prepared to pay for them). Blackstone (same reference) also explains how \"letters patent\" (Latin \"literae patentes\", \"letters that lie open\") were so called because the seal hung from the foot of the document: they were addressed \"To all to whom these presents shall come\" and could be read without breaking the seal, as opposed to \"letters close\", addressed to a particular person who had to break the seal to read them.\n\nThis power was used to raise money for the Crown, and was widely abused, as the Crown granted patents in respect of all sorts of common goods (salt, for example). Consequently, the Court began to limit the circumstances in which they could be granted. After public outcry, James I of England was forced to revoke all existing monopolies and declare that they were only to be used for \"projects of new invention\". This was incorporated into the Statute of Monopolies in which Parliament restricted the Crown's power explicitly so that the King could only issue letters patent to the inventors or introducers of original inventions for a fixed number of years. It also voided all existing monopolies and dispensations with the exception of:\nThe Statute became the foundation for later developments in patent law in England and elsewhere.\nImportant developments in patent law emerged during the 18th century through a slow process of judicial interpretation of the law. During the reign of Queen Anne, patent applications were required to supply a complete specification of the principles of operation of the invention for public access. Patenting medicines was particular popular in the mid-eighteenth century and then declined. Legal battles around the 1796 patent taken out by James Watt for his steam engine, established the principles that patents could be issued for improvements of an already existing machine and that ideas or principles without specific practical application could also legally be patented.\n\nThis legal system became the foundation for patent law in countries with a common law heritage, including the United States, New Zealand and Australia. In the Thirteen Colonies, inventors could obtain patents through petition to a given colony's legislature. In 1641, Samuel Winslow was granted the first patent in North America by the Massachusetts General Court for a new process for making salt.\n\nTowards the end of the 18th century, and influenced by the philosophy of John Locke, the granting of patents began to be viewed as a form of intellectual property right, rather than simply the obtaining of economic privilege. A negative aspect of the patent law also emerged in this period - the abuse of patent privilege to monopolise the market and prevent improvement from other inventors. A notable example of this was the behaviour of Boulton & Watt in hounding their competitors such as Richard Trevithick through the courts, and preventing their improvements to the steam engine from being realised until their patent expired.\n\nThe modern French patent system was created during the Revolution in 1791. Patents were granted without examination since inventor's right was considered as a natural one. Patent costs were very high (from 500 to 1500 francs). Importation patents protected new devices coming from foreign countries. The patent law was revised in 1844 - patent cost was lowered and importation patents were abolished. The revision saw the introduction of the \"Breveté SGDG\", which excluded any guarantees that the patented item would actually satisfy its specification.\nThe Patent and Copyright Clause of the United States Constitution was proposed in 1787 by James Madison and Charles Cotesworth Pinckney. In Federalist No. 43, Madison wrote, \"The utility of the clause will scarcely be questioned. The copyright of authors has been solemnly adjudged, in Great Britain, to be a right of common law. The right to useful inventions seems with equal reason to belong to the inventors. The public good fully coincides in both cases with the claims of the individuals.\"\n\nThe first Patent Act of the U.S. Congress was passed on April 10, 1790, titled \"An Act to promote the progress of useful Arts.\" The first patent was granted on July 31, 1790 to Samuel Hopkins for a method of producing potash (potassium carbonate).\n\nThe earliest law required that a working model of each invention be submitted with the application. Patent applications were examined to determine if an inventor was entitled to the grant of a patent. The requirement for a working model was eventually dropped. In 1793, the law was revised so that patents were granted automatically upon submission of the description. A separate Patent Office was created in 1802.\n\nThe patent laws were again revised in 1836, and the examination of patent applications was reinstituted. In 1870 Congress passed a law which mainly reorganized and reenacted existing law, but also made some important changes, such as giving the commissioner of patents the authority to draft rules and regulations for the Patent Office.\n\nUnder the influence of the ascendant economic philosophy of free trade economics in England, the patent law began to be criticised in the 1850s as obstructing research and benefiting the few at the expense of public good. The campaign against patenting expanded to target copyright too and, in the judgment of historian Adrian Johns, \"remains to this day the strongest [campaign] ever undertaken against intellectual property\", coming close to abolishing patents.\n\nIts most prominent activists - Isambard Kingdom Brunel, William Robert Grove, William Armstrong and Robert A. MacFie - were inventors and entrepreneurs, and it was also supported by radical laissez-faire economists (The Economist published anti-patent views), law scholars, scientists (who were concerned that patents were obstructing research) and manufacturers. Johns summarizes some of their main arguments as follows:\n\nSimilar debates took place during that time in other European countries such as France, Prussia, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Based on the criticism of patents as state-granted monopolies inconsistent with free trade, the Netherlands abolished patents in 1869 (having established them in 1817), and did not reintroduce them until 1912. In Switzerland, criticism of patents delayed the introduction of patent laws until 1907.\n\nIn England, despite much public debate, the system wasn't abolished - it was reformed with the Patent Law Amendment Act of 1852. This simplified procedure for obtaining patents, reduced fees and created one office for the entire United Kingdom, instead of different systems for England and Wales and Scotland. In France as well, a similar controversy erupted in the 1860s and reforms were made.\n\n\n\n\"American\"\n\n"}

Optimum-sized objects permit the hand to wrap around a cylindrical shape with a diameter from one to three inches. Stair rails are an example of where shape and diameter are critical for proper grip in case of a fall. Other grip strengths that have been studied are the hammer and other hand tools. In applications of grip strength, the wrist must be in a neutral position to avoid developing cumulative trauma disorders (CTDs).\n\nGrip strength is a general term also used to refer to the physical strength of an animal and, for athletes, to the muscular power and force that can be generated with the hands. In athletics, grip strength is critical for rock climbers and is an important factor in strongman competitions and weight lifting. Grip strength training is also a major feature in martial arts and can be useful in various professions where people must work with their hands.\n\nThe human hand can be used to grip objects in several different positions. These different positions require different types of grip strength which are typically quantified based on the way the hand is being used.\n\nThe crush grip is what is most commonly thought of as \"grip\". It involves a handshake-type grip, where the object being gripped rests firmly against the palm and all fingers. A strong crush grip is useful in bone-crushing handshakes or for breaking objects with pressure.\n\nIn a pinch grip, the fingers are on one side of an object, and the thumb is on the other. Typically, an object lifted in a pinch grip does not touch the palm. This is generally considered a weaker grip position. The pinch grip is used when grabbing something like a weight plate or lifting a sheet of plywood by the top edge.\n\nA support grip typically involves holding something, such as the handle of a bucket, for a long time. This type of strength is epitomized by the Farmer's walk competitive event, where the bucket is filled with sand or water, and carried over a long distance. A great deal of muscular endurance is necessary to have a good carrying grip.\n\nThere has been extensive medical and ergonomic research looking at grip strength. This has led to the generation of normative data. The average for grip strength of men is higher than that of women. The grip strength of 90% of women is lower than that of 95% of men. Averages also exist for different types of grip in different positions.\n\nGrip strength increases or decreases depending on the arm position at which the grip strength is being measured. A person's grip strength usually results in having the strongest grip strength when their arm is extended at 90° before their body, as opposed to the other extreme arm positions, rested at one's side or held straight up above one's head. Grip strength is not optimal if one's arm is extended backwards beyond the resting position at the body's sides.\nIt can be concluded that grip strength is affected via the different arm muscles and their ability to contract.\n\nGrip strength is often used in medicine as a specific type of hand strength. The purpose of this testing is diverse, including to diagnose diseases, to evaluate and compare treatments, to document progression of muscle strength, and to provide feedback during the rehabilitation process as a measure indicating the level of hand function. For example, it is used to indicate changes in hand strength after hand surgery or after a rehabilitation program. By asking subjects to maintain a maximum contraction for longer periods, it can be used as a measure of fatigue. It is also able to predict a decline in function in old age. Since the above-mentioned grips involve the action of a large number of different joints and muscle groups, grip strength is not always very sensitive to measure individual muscle groups in medicine. For this purpose, dynamometers have been developed that provide more specific information on individual muscles in the hand such as the Rotterdam Intrinsic Hand Myometer (RIHM). In medicine, doctors sometimes use grip strength to test a patient's mentality, as grip strength directly correlates to mental state. Grip strength is also used to measure the degree of rehabilitation from injuries; all other things being equal, it will vary with general condition. Additionally, grip strength can be used to determine a patient's physical stability. Measuring this in intervals allows a doctor to determine if a patient is making progress or if different methods need to be used. There is a direct correlation between grip strength of older people and their overall body strength. This correlation helps doctors with treating the elderly a lot, because it allows doctors to see how well an elderly person is functioning. Strengthening the grip strength helps players recover from sport injuries such as tennis elbow.\n\nHand grip is an important, though often overlooked, component of strength in sports. However, the grip strength is most often a secondary or auxiliary function of the sport. Sports in which grip strength are included within the secondary focus include the following: movement-based climbing, calisthenics, gymnastics, pole dancing, horse racing, powerlifting or professional arm-wrestling; ball-based baseball, gridiron football, rugby, canoe polo, badminton or tennis; and combat sports such as brazilian jiu-jitsu, boxing, fencing, judo or wrestling. In sports, hand grip strength is a major factor in a player's strength, determining how easily a ball can be caught or how effectively equipment can be used. Hand grip strength is directly linked to hand-eye coordination: when a person is looking at the thing they are gripping, hand grip strength intensifies because of this synchronization.\n\nHand grip strength is very important when it comes to sports. Before a player begins playing a hand grip strength test is important for determining a player's workout. Hand grip strength determines a player's readiness for sports. In golf, hand grip strength is used to control the power a golfer hits a golf ball. The angle at which a golfer hits the ball determines how far the ball goes. ... In football, the quarterback uses hand grip strength to throw accurate passers to receivers. The receivers use hand grip strength to catch and maintain control of the football. ... In hockey, hand grip strength is used to angle the shot of the puck, whether they are passing the puck or shooting for a goal. Hand grip strength is essential for the execution of skills in hockey. In martial arts, hand grip strength is a key use in mastering techniques. [2] Hand grip strength determines the success of arm functionality, such as speed and precision.\n\nFrom their beginnings as odd performances at fairs and circuses, grip feats have recently gained acceptance as a sport in their own right, with competitions being held with increasing regularity. Events include one-arm deadlift, nail bending, the closing of torsion spring hand grippers, v-bar (vertical bar) lifting, and standardized pinch apparatuses. Other common events may include Rolling Thunder lifts, thickbar deadlifts, and \"Blob\" lifting.\n\nThe major contests are:\nTop 3 results back to 1955\n\nAlthough grip strength lends itself to impromptu performances that might feature a unique implement or cater to a particular individual or a small group, performances on standardized, widely available tests carry more weight. One such feat involving world class grip strength is officially closing a No. 3 Captains of Crush Gripper, first accomplished by Richard Sorin in 1991. Card tearing is a traditional feat of grip and lower arm strength that has a rich history, and top performances include John Brookfield tearing three decks of cards at once and tearing 50 decks of cards in less than a minute. Brookfield has explained the technique for tearing cards in both his \"MILO\" article on the topic, and in his book \"The Grip Master's Manual\"\n\nGrip strength training requires a different type of training regimen than other muscular training. The reasons are primarily based on the interplay of the tendons and muscles and the lack of \"down time\" or rest that most people's hands get.\n\nIt is generally considered that all aspects of the hand must be exercised to produce a healthy and strong hand. Only working on closing grip will cause an imbalance between closing and opening (antagonist) muscles, and can lead to problems such as tendinitis and carpal tunnel syndrome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He studied at the Scottish Church College and later at the University of Calcutta from where he earned his doctorate in Indian philosophy. He became a professor and later the chair of philosophy at the Krishnagar College, then a constituent college of the University of Calcutta.\n\nIn 1951, Chaudhuri was invited by Frederic Spiegelberg of Stanford University to join the staff of the newly formed American Academy of Asian Studies in San Francisco, having been recommended for that post by Sri Aurobindo during the final year of Aurobindo's life. \nOther accounts have indicated that Chaudhuri was recommended for the job by K.D. Sethna, an eminent intellectual living at Aurobindo's ashram, based in part on the fact that Chaudhuri was an active devotee of Sri Aurobindo.\nHe accepted the invitation, eager to implement in a Western educational institution the integral approach to education that he had developed as a student of Sri Aurobindo.\n\nSoon after his arrival in San Francisco, Chaudhuri and his wife Bina established the Cultural Integration Fellowship (CIF), from which emerged an educational branch later to become California Institute of Integral Studies. Over the past 30 years, the Institute's original emphasis on Asian religions and cultures evolved to include comparative and cross-cultural studies in philosophy, religion, psychology, counseling, cultural anthropology, organizational studies, health studies, and the arts.\n\nChaudhuri was the first to publish in the West on integral psychology, during the 1970s. His version of integral psychology has almost nothing in common with that of Ken Wilber, who has written a book of the same name.\n\nBahman Shirazi of the California Institute of Integral Studies has defined integral psychology as \"a psychological system concerned with exploring and understanding the totality of the human phenomenon...(which) at its breadth, covers the entire body-mind-psyche-spirit spectrum, while at its depth...encompasses the previously explored unconscious and the conscious dimensions of the psyche, as well as the supra-conscious dimension traditionally excluded from psychological inquiry\".

Its areas of focus include immigration, family law, employment law, tenant and landlord issues, wills, trusts and intellectual property. Even though Nolo encourages consumers and small business owners to handle their own legal matters when it is reasonably feasible to do so, the company recommends getting professional legal help for disputable or difficult matters.\n\nThe company was founded in an attic in 1971 by Ralph Warner (a graduate of UC Berkeley's Boalt School of Law) and family law attorney Ed Sherman. The company's logo shows the scales of justice tilted in favor of the reader, and includes the motto \"LAW for ALL.\"\n\nIn 1971 Ed Sherman wrote \"How to Do Your Own Divorce in California\". He and Ralph Warner discovered that established publishers wouldn't publish the book because they feared being prosecuted for practicing law without a licence. In response Sherman and Warner created Nolo Press and published it themselves. They then started publishing additional do-it-yourself legal guides under the Nolo Press name.\n\nThe Latin word \"nolo\" in the original company name (\"Nolo Press\") could be taken to mean \"I would prefer not to.\" Warner and Sherman thought this name was appropriate since they had only started a publishing business themselves after their first do-it-yourself guide was turned down by established publishers. \n\nIn 2006, Nolo began publishing a directory of attorneys, which is asserted to operate on the principle that both participating lawyers and consumers are better served by a relatively short list of qualified attorneys under each category (business law, real estate, etc.), with lots of information for side-by-side comparisons.\n\nIn 2006 Nolo retired its unofficial shark mascot on the company's 35th anniversary. Some older Nolo publications had featured the shark wearing a necktie and carrying a briefcase – showing the company's fondness for poking fun at their fellow members of the legal profession. This mascot was often accompanied by the motto \"Don't feed the lawyers. Just say Nolo.\"\n\nIn 2011, the company was purchased by Internet Brands, Inc.\n\nEd Sherman founded his own legal publishing business, Nolo Press Occidental, a separate company from Nolo.\n\nSince its inception in the early 1970s, Nolo's primary focus has been publishing self-help legal guides designed to assist anyone in finding plain-language answers to common legal questions. The company is also the creator of Quicken WillMaker software, which allows individuals to create do-it-yourself wills, powers of attorney and other estate planning documents.\n\nAlthough the company's products conspicuously recommend the reader should engage a lawyer for difficult or contended matters, the company has nevertheless drawn the ire of some legal organizations.\n\nPublication of Nolo's first book, \"How to Do Your Own Divorce in California\", was condemned by the Sacramento Bar Association, which led to a huge increase in its sales.\n\nIn 1997, the Texas Unauthorized Practice of Law Committee (a committee of the Texas Supreme Court) opened investigations on Nolo and similar publishers, inquiring as to whether their publications constituted practicing law without a license. Saying that the investigation was \"the first step toward widespread state censorship\", Nolo sued, seeking a declaratory judgment that its publications were legal. It was joined in the action by the American Association of Law Libraries and the Texas Library Association. In response, the Texas Legislature enacted HR 1507, which expressly exempted websites and textbooks from accusations of practicing law without a license, providing they \"clearly and conspicuously state that the products are not a substitute for the advice of an attorney\". In light of this, the court committee dropped its contest of Nolo's suit.\n"}

He fought in the Mexican–American War and on the Union side of the American Civil War, rising to the rank of major general. He commanded a division at the Battle of Shiloh, which suffered heavy casualties while defending what became known as the Hornet's Nest from continued Confederate assaults, and he eventually surrendered his division. He was criticized by some for his conduct in that battle. After his exchange, he continued to serve in the army until his resignation in 1863. He spent much of his remaining life practising as a lawyer and as a politician in the Republican Party.\n\nBenjamin M. Prentiss was born in Belleville, Virginia. He was a direct descendant of Valentine Prentice, who immigrated from England in 1631. His early childhood was spent in Virginia until his family joined the migration and moved near Hannibal, Missouri. They then moved to Quincy, Illinois, where Prentiss made his home until 1879. He then moved to Missouri.\n\nIn his early life, Benjamin Prentiss was a rope-maker and served as an auctioneer. On March 29, 1838, he married Margaret Ann Sodowsky; they had seven children before she died in 1860. In 1862, he married Mary Worthington Whitney, who bore him five more children.\n\nPrentiss ran unsuccessfully for United States Congress in 1860. At the beginning of the American Civil War he defended railroad lines in Missouri until ordered to command a division under Ulysses S. Grant. Early in the morning, an officer under his command, Colonel Everett Peabody, sent out a 250-man patrol which made contact with the advancing Confederate army, providing the Union army with critical early warning of the impending attack. Prentiss was initially outraged with Peabody for sending out a patrol without his authorization, but soon realized he was facing an on oncoming attack by an entire Confederate army and rushed to prepare his men for defense. His division was the first one attacked at the Battle of Shiloh and suffered greatly during the opening hours of that battle. Brigadier General Prentiss reformed his command with reinforcements under the command General W. H. L. Wallace and put up a spirited fight in the \"Hornet's Nest\".\n\nPrentiss took full command of the position after Wallace was fatally wounded and eventually surrendered the Hornet's Nest along with 2,200 other Union soldiers. He surrendered his sword to Lt. Colonel Francis Marion Walker of the 19th Tennessee Infantry. After the battle he was considered a hero, having held off the Confederate States Army long enough to allow General Grant to organize a counterattack and win the battle. Grant would later play down Benjamin Prentiss' role in the victory, possibly because of mutual dislike between the two generals. However, Grant said in his memoirs \"Prentiss' command was gone as a division, many of its members having been killed, wounded or captured; but it had rendered valiant services before its final dispersal, and had contributed a good share to the defense of Shiloh\". Prentiss' own after-action report did not mention the aid of Wallace's troops, and barely made any mention of Peabody, who was also killed in action during the battle.\n\nAfter being released as part of a prisoner exchange in October the same year, Prentiss was promoted to major general and served on the court-martial board that convicted Fitz John Porter. His dissenting voice in the final vote damaged his political clout. Prentiss was sent to Arkansas and won the Battle of Helena on July 4, 1863. In 1863, he resigned to tend to his family. Historian Ezra J. Warner speculated that Prentiss felt that he was being shelved after having proved his abilities at Shiloh and Helena.\n\nAfter the Civil War, Prentiss became a lawyer. He was later appointed as postmaster of Bethany, Missouri, by President Benjamin Harrison and was re-appointed by President William McKinley. He was a leader in the Republican Party of Missouri.\n\nHe died on February 8, 1901 in Bethany at age 81. He is buried there in Miriam Cemetery, Harrison County, Missouri.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2016578", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2016578", "title": "Code Access Security", "text": "Code Access Security\n\nCode Access Security (CAS), in the Microsoft .NET framework, is Microsoft's solution to prevent untrusted code from performing privileged actions. When the CLR loads an assembly it will obtain evidence for the assembly and use this to identify the code group that the assembly belongs to. A code group contains a permission set (one or more permissions). Code that performs a privileged action will perform a code access demand which will cause the CLR to walk up the call stack and examine the permission set granted to the assembly of each method in the call stack. \nThe code groups and permission sets are determined by the administrator of the machine who defines the security policy.\n\nEvidence can be any information associated with an assembly. The default evidences that are used by .NET code access security are:\n\n\nA developer can use custom evidence (so-called assembly evidence) but this requires writing a security assembly and in version 1.1 of .NET this facility does not work.\n\nEvidence based on a hash of the assembly is easily obtained in code. For example, in C#, evidence may be obtained by the following code clause:\nthis.GetType().Assembly.Evidence\nA policy is a set of expressions that uses evidence to determine a code group membership. A code group gives a permission set for the assemblies within that group. There are four policies in .NET:\n\n\nThe first three policies are stored in XML files and are administered through the .NET Configuration Tool 1.1 (mscorcfg.msc). The final policy is administered through code for the current application domain.\n\nCode access security will present an assembly's evidence to each policy and will then take the intersection (that is the permissions common to all the generated permission set) as the permissions granted to the assembly.\n\nBy default, the Enterprise, User, and AppDomain policies give full trust (that is they allow all assemblies to have all permissions) and the Machine policy is more restrictive. Since the intersection is taken this means that the final permission set is determined by the Machine policy.\n\nNote that the policy system has been eliminated in .NET Framework 4.0.\n\nCode groups associate a piece of evidence with a named permission set. The administrator uses the .NET Configuration Tool to specify a particular type of evidence (for example, Site) and a particular value for that evidence (for example, www.mysite.com) and then identifies the permission set that the code group will be granted.\n\nCode that performs some privileged action will make a demand for one or more permissions. The demand makes the CLR walk the call stack and for each method the CLR will ensure that the demanded permissions are in the method's assembly's granted permissions. If the permission is not granted then a security exception is thrown. This prevents downloaded code from performing privileged actions. For example, if an assembly is downloaded from an untrusted site the assembly will not have any file IO permissions and so if this assembly attempts to access a file code access security will throw an exception preventing the call.\n\n"}

{"id": "2016596", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2016596", "title": "Jolly Farmer", "text": "Jolly Farmer\n\nThe Jolly Farmer, formerly the Golden Farmer, is a former pub and roundabout on the boundary between Camberley and Bagshot in Surrey, England. The pub derives its name from a gold-robbing farmer, William Davies (or Davis) who spent years plundering various sections of the country's main south-west turnpike road including this area before being hanged in 1689 at this location.\n\nThe junction was a fork with the London to Land's End turnpike road (now the A30 London Road), and the London to Portsmouth turnpike (now the A325 Portsmouth Road). The two main roads are mentioned in John Ogilby's \"Britannia\", published in 1675, with the Land's End road described as \"in general a very good Road with suitable Entertainment\" and the Portsmouth Road as \"A very good Road to Southampton, and thence to Salisbury indifferent\" (the route to Southampton being roughly the A325 and part of what is now the A31). Until the establishment of Camberley in 1860, it crossed remote unpopulated heathland. In the stagecoach era, it was busy with traffic, and notorious for the poor quality of road and proliferation of highwaymen.\n\nThe junction has been an important landmark and mentioned in early motoring itineraries. It was originally a simple fork in the road and was converted into the current roundabout layout in 1960.\n\nThe highwayman William Davies (also recorded as \"Davis\") was born in Wrexham, Wales, before moving to Sodbury, Gloucestershire where he married and had 18 children. He targeted heaths across England from Putney near London to Cornwall for 40 years in the 17th century, taking significant gold from his victims. He plied the uninhabited main road across Bagshot/Frimley Heath. His identity was discovered since he was a Sodbury farmer bearing 18 children with his wife who paid \"any considerable sum in gold\". Davies was hung in chains on Bagshot Heath in December 1689. \n\nAccording to oral history Davies was hanged near the location of the pub, at the junction of London Road and Gibbett Lane. According to historian Jacqueline Simpson, this included speculation that he was hanged alive and starved to death, though this practice had been abolished by Elizabeth I a century earlier for being too barbaric.\n\nThe original building was to the north of the London Road, and operated from the late 17th century as the Golden Farmer. It appeared under that name on early Ordnance Survey maps in the 19th century. The name \"Golden Farmer\" was originally associated with John Bennet, but became associated with Davies after being mentioned as such in Alexander Smith's \"The History of the Lives of the most Noted Highwaymen\", published in 1714.\n\nA picture of Davies was painted and hung in the pub. The name was changed to \"Jolly Farmer\" in 1823. It moved to its current location inside the roundabout in 1879. During the 19th century, the pub was a rendezvous point for hunting around Bagshot Heath.\n\nH E Malden wrote the Victoria County History in 1911, finding little of economic productivity or architecture in Bagshot to record other than its coaching inns, stating \"Thirty coaches a day passed through, and there were many inns, since closed...The later history is full of the exploits of highwaymen, who found the wild country hereabouts specially favourable for their purposes\". \n\nIn 1996, the pub closed and became a Mongolian barbecue. After this also closed, Burger King offered to buy the building, but their offer was rejected by Surrey Heath council after parents were concerned children from the nearby secondary school would try to cross the junction to reach the premises. Since 2003, the building has been used as an American discount golf store.\n\nNotes\nCitations\nSources\n"}

They have released eleven studio albums to date. Three of those, \"Indiscreet\", \"Tough It Out\" and 2015's \"Heroes and Villains\" reached the UK Albums Chart, whilst five of the band's singles made inroads into the UK Singles Chart.\n\nFM was formed in the summer of 1984 in London. Comprising the ex-Samson pair of bassist Merv Goldsworthy and drummer Pete Jupp, the Overland brothers – vocalist/guitarist Steve and lead guitarist Chris Overland (both formerly of Wildlife, where they played with future Ozzy, Johnny Hallyday and Vince Neil bassist Phil Soussan) and keyboardist Philip Manchester (of new wave band The Invaders, also known as Didge Digital), the band initially wrote six songs which by December 1984 had helped them secure a recording contract with the CBS/Portrait label. That same month the band set off on tour in Germany with Meat Loaf.\n\nThe first UK public appearance of FM (not to be confused with the Canadian band of the same name) was on Valentine’s Day in 1985 at London's legendary Marquee Club. The debut album, \"Indiscreet\" followed and their debut single \"Frozen Heart\" was heard in many venues during 1986.\nFM hit the road in Europe supporting Tina Turner, Foreigner, Gary Moore, Status Quo and Magnum, also opening for REO Speedwagon at London’s Hammersmith Odeon. At the year's end they accepted a spot with Bon Jovi on the UK leg of their \"Slippery When Wet Tour\".\n\nWhen CBS folded the Portrait label, FM switched to Epic. The Overland brothers went to the United States to write with Desmond Child, returning with the hard rock anthem \"Bad Luck\". Queensrÿche and Dokken producer Neil Kernon was engaged to oversee 1989’s \"Tough It Out\".\n\nTo promote \"Tough It Out\", the band set out on a 42 date UK tour that saw them returning to the Hammersmith Odeon. Soon afterwards, Chris Overland decided to leave FM, his final performance taking place at the Town & Country Club. In his place, FM recruited Andy Barnett, a guitarist who had already been in a prototype line-up of the group, and had a co-writing credit for the \"Indiscreet\" song, \"That Girl,\" which was later covered by Iron Maiden as a B-side. His debut with the group was 1991's \"Takin’ It To The Streets\".\n\nFM moved to another record label, Music For Nations, and Didge Digital left in late 1991. A cover version of Marvin Gaye's \"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\" was not a hit, but was followed by their next album, \"Aphrodisiac\". They undertook a string of acoustic concerts in the winter of 1992.\n\nWith Europe and the Far East markets opening up for FM, a full-time keyboard appointment was made with Jem Davis (former Tobruk and UFO), joining the band. The arrangement was short-lived. After the release of \"Dead Man's Shoes\" in 1995, the band split up.\n\nAt Nottingham's Rock City venue on 27 October 2007 however, FM played together again in public for the first time in twelve years, headlining the sold-out Firefest festival. The reaction the band received to this one-off appearance led to the swift decision to make the reunion permanent. Guitarist Andy Barnett could not commit to long-term plans however and the band were disappointed to accept his resignation. At Steve Overland's suggestion Jim Kirkpatrick was recruited and he made his live debut with FM at a low-key show at Winstanley College (Wigan, UK) on 19 March 2009, followed by a more public appearance when FM headlined Firefest for a second time on October 2009. To coincide with this festival appearance FM released the new single \"Wildside\" as part of an EP containing new recordings and live tracks. For the first time new recruit Jim Kirkpatrick was featured on record. The single was a taster of forthcoming new album, \"Metropolis\".\n\n\"Metropolis\", FM's first new album since \"Dead Man's Shoes\" in 1995, was showcased at a sell-out launch party at The Roadhouse, Covent Garden, London in February 2010 and was released on 31 May 2010. Produced by the band, \"Metropolis\" met with critical acclaim and the two singles from the album - \"Hollow\" (released 17 May 2010) and \"Bring Back Yesterday\" (released 7 September 2010) each spent a month on the playlist at BBC Radio 2 and were playlisted on many other radio stations.\n\nFM toured all over the UK in support of the album throughout 2010. Their live schedule included a set on the main stage at Download Festival as a late replacement for Ratt in June 2010 and a set on the main stage at Hard Rock Hell IV at Prestatyn in December. December also saw the return of an FM tradition with a 'Christmas Party' show at Islington Academy London.\n\nFM started 2011 with a show at London's Hammersmith Apollo on 22 January with Thin Lizzy. The rest of the year saw the band return to many overseas strongholds of years gone by including headline shows in the Netherlands and Spain (their first ever live concert in that country); a show with D-A-D in Portugal; dates with Journey and Foreigner in Germany, Dublin and Belfast and appearances at major festivals such as Graspop in Belgium and Sweden Rock. They were also invited back to play at Download Festival again.\n\nIn January 2012 FM headlined the Sunday night Rock Stage at the Great British Rock & Blues Festival in Skegness and during March they staged three special concerts in Glasgow, Manchester and London to celebrate the 25th Anniversary of the release of their début album \"Indiscreet\". These shows saw FM play \"Indiscreet\" live in its entirety for the first time ever as part of a full show and were commemorated by the release of the live in concert DVD \"Indiscreet 25 Live\" on 1 April 2013, filmed at the Manchester and London shows. In mid-August 2012 FM performed as Special Guests of Thin Lizzy at shows in Carlisle and Belsonic 2012 in Belfast and followed this with the Special Guest slot on Thin Lizzy's UK tour in November/December 2012 alongside The Treatment. The nine-track mini-album \"Only Foolin' EP\" was released 26 November 2012 featuring a mix of new studio recordings and live tracks recorded at FM's \"Indiscreet 25Live\" shows earlier in the year.\n\nIn November 2012 FM announced their forthcoming seventh studio album would be released March 2013 with the title \"Rockville\" by launching a PledgeMusic campaign. Via PledgeMusic fans could pre-order the album along with pledging for other items such as a two-CD package to include \"Rockville II\" (a second CD of nine new tracks and a new recording of the song \"High\", originally released by Steve Overland and Pete Jupp under the SO! banner on the album \"Brass Monkey\"), Steve Overland's microphone, various items autographed by the band and VIP concert access.\n\nFM held a press launch for \"Rockville\" at London O2 Academy 2 Islington on 6 March 2013 which was also attended by Pledgers via the band's PledgeMusic campaign. Following a playback of the album in full the band played a half-hour set of some of their crowd-pleasing anthems before a playback of \"Rockville II\".\n\n\"Rockville\" was released 11 March 2013 and debuted on the Official UK Rock Chart at #6, followed on 25 March by the release of \"Rockville II\" which had earned an official release of its own due to the amount of interest generated by its inclusion in FM's PledgeMusic campaign. On 15 March 2013 FM began a UK tour in support of \"Rockville\". Special Guests for the first four dates on the tour were Vega and Serpentine whilst It Bites and Vega were Special Guests for the second half of the tour. The tour was followed on 6 April 2013 by a set at the inaugural HRH AOR festival which was held at Rotherham's Magna Science Adventure Centre on a bill which included Tesla, Danny Vaughn and past touring-mates Romeo's Daughter.\n\nIn June 2013 FM played at HiRock, a two-day festival held in Germany at Freilichtbühne Loreley and the Max Aicher Arena in Inzell. Other artists performing at HiRock included Toto, Rick Springfield, Whitesnake, Journey and Black Star Riders. Due to adverse weather conditions and extensive flooding in the surrounding area the second day of the festival at Inzell did not take place. On 27 July 2013 the band were Special Guests at Planet Rock's Steelhouse Festival in Wales followed the next day by a headline show at The River Rooms in Stourbridge with Toby Jepson performing an acoustic set as Special Guest. During June and July 2013 the band's single \"Story Of My Life\" from \"Rockville\" spent several weeks on the BBC Radio 2 playlist. In December Toby Jepson returned as Special Guest for FM's final headline appearance of the year at a sold-out The Box in Crewe and the band ended the year with a set on the main stage at Planet Rock's Planet Rockstock festival. Their single \"Better Late Than Never\" was added to the BBC Radio 2 playlist on 26 December 2013.\n\nOn the afternoon of Saturday 8 February 2014 FM headlined the 'Reds' stage at the Giants Of Rock festival in Minehead, also appearing were Elliott Randall, Molly Hatchet and Big Country. A large part of the original Friday line-up for this festival was cancelled, resulting in stage times throughout the rest of the weekend being rescheduled.\n\nDuring 2014 - in addition to writing and recording for their next release - FM toured across the UK with Foreigner and Europe during March / April 2014, with further European dates alongside Foreigner and a series of headline shows in the Netherlands, Germany, Spain and Portugal taking them into May. To coincide with this tour FM released a new eleven-track EP entitled \"Futurama\" on 31 March 2014. \"Futurama\" includes four new studio tracks, six new live recordings and an extended mix.\n\nThe second half of 2014 featured FM's 30th Anniversary celebrations. They headlined Cambridge Rock Festival on Saturday 9 August 2014 with Bernie Marsden joining FM onstage during the encore for a rendition of \"Here I Go Again\". Bernie Marsden joined FM again for the encore at The River Rooms in Stourbridge during their 30th Anniversary Tour in November. The tour also took in shows at Southampton, Cardiff, Bingley, Southend and Holmfirth with special guests including Toby Jepson, Hand Of Dimes and Three Lions. A late cancellation by Vandenberg's Moonkings and a call from the Planet Rock festival organisers resulted in FM rounding off 2014 with a surprise appearance on the main stage at Planet Rockstock on Sunday 7 December.\n\nFM released their ninth studio album \"Heroes and Villains\" via Frontiers Records on 20 April 2015 (UK / Europe) and 21 April 2015 (USA) and embarked on a UK tour in May with Special Guests Romeo's Daughter and No Hot Ashes. The track \"Shape I'm In\" from the new album was added to the BBC Radio 2 playlist from Saturday 4 April 2015. Festival appearances in 2015 included Nantwich Jazz, Frontiers Rock Festival in Italy (FM's first-ever performance in Italy), Rock The Ring in Switzerland, Graspop Metal Meeting in Belgium, Netherlands festival Bospop, Team Rock's inaugural Ramblin' Man Fair in Maidstone, Steelhouse Festival in Wales and two festivals in Sweden at Skogsröjet in Rejmyre and Helgeåfestivalen in Knislinge. In November 2015 FM continued their European Tour with more UK dates followed by a co-headline run of shows in mainland Europe with Electric Boys. Their last show of the year was headlining Planet Rockstock, the band's third appearance at the festival in three years.\n\nFM's Heroes and Villains tour continued through 2016 with dates across the UK in January (Special Guests Romeo's Daughter, The King Lot, Bernie Marsden and No Hot Ashes). Festival appearances included The Great British Rock & Blues Festival, Rockweekend AOR and Väsby Rock Festival in Sweden, and Nantwich Jazz, Blues & Music Festival. The band also featured as Special Guests on Heart's \"She Devils\" UK tour in the summer of 2016, performing at London's Royal Albert Hall, Manchester O2 Apollo, Glasgow Royal Concert Hall and Birmingham Symphony Hall.\n\nAlso in 2016 FM celebrated the 30th anniversary of their debut album with the release of \"Indiscreet 30\", re-recording the original tracks to update the album - \"We are not trying to recreate the original, but this is our interpretation played by FM as we are today with the sound of FM 2016\" explained Merv Goldsworthy. \n\nIn 2017 FM played their first-ever show in Greece to a sell-out crowd along with appearances at HRH AOR festival, a unique triple-headline bill alongside The Quireboys and Gun as part of the Castell Roc Music Festival at Chepstow Castle, Escape Open Air and HEAT festivals in Germany, Rock & Blues Custom Show in Pentrich and a return to Cambridge Rock Festival. \n\nFM's eleventh studio album \"Atomic Generation\" was released on 30 March 2018 via Frontiers Records (14 March 2018 in Japan). In addition to shows across the UK throughout 2018 - including dates with Dare and Toby Jepson - FM appeared at Frontiers Rock Festival in Milan on 29 April and played the USA for the first time when they headlined at Melodic Rock Fest 5 in Chicago on 6 May, following this with a headline set at the sister festival Melodic Rock Fest Scandinavia in Malmö on 1 June. \n\nIn September 2018 FM accepted an invitation to join Saxon as Special Guests on their \"Thunderbolt Tour Part 2\" to replace previously announced Y&T whose singer / guitarist Dave Meniketti was suffering from a serious back injury and thus unable to embark on the tour. The three-band bill toured throughout Europe from 19 September to 16 October with Raven as opening act and with Wayward Sons opening for four shows in the UK 18–21 October. With current keyboardist Jem Davis unable to join FM for the European shows at such short notice, the band recruited guest keyboard player and original band member Didge Digital for the European dates with Jem Davis performing at the UK shows.\n\nCurrent members\n\nFormer members\n\nLineups\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
