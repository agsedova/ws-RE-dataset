{"id": "1874193", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1874193", "title": "Windsor Park", "text": "Windsor Park\n\nWindsor Park is a football stadium in Belfast, Northern Ireland. It is the home ground of Linfield FC and tenants Northern Ireland national football team, and is also where the Irish Cup final is played.\n\nNamed after the district in south Belfast in which it is located, Windsor Park was first opened in 1905, with a match between Linfield and Glentoran. The first major development of the stadium took place in the 1930s, to a design made by the Scottish architect Archibald Leitch. It had one main seated stand - the Grandstand, later known as the South Stand - with \"reserved\" terracing in front, and a large open terrace behind the goal to the west called the Spion Kop. To the north, there was a long covered terrace – the \"unreserved\" terracing – and behind the eastern goal at the Railway End another covered terrace. Windsor Park's peak capacity in this format was 60,000. In the early 1960s, the seated Railway Stand was built at the Railway End, and in the early 1970s a social club and viewing lounge was constructed in the corner between the Railway Stand and the Grandstand. In the 1980s, the 'unreserved terrace' was demolished and replaced by a two-tier, 7000-seat North Stand. In the late 1990s, the Kop terrace was demolished and replaced with a 5000-seater Kop Stand. The Kop Stand was known as the Alex Russell Stand from 2004–2008 in honour of Linfield's former goalkeeper and coach and one-time Northern Ireland international, but reverted to being named 'The Kop Stand' following this. \n\nIn the 2016–17 league season, Linfield FC drew an average home attendance of 2,538, the highest in the league. Their highest home attendance was 7,504 in that league season.\n\nOwing to the increasingly poor condition of Windsor Park, various proposals for its replacement were mooted, including the idea of a multi-purpose stadium hosting football, rugby union and Gaelic games on the site of the former Maze prison, or a national stadium built as part of a major leisure development at Sydenham in east Belfast. The plans for the multi-purpose stadium at the Maze site was strongly protested by essentially all the Northern Ireland match-going supporters. Various petitions in opposition to the suggestion, as well as organised displays of opposition at matches and the presentation counter-proposals, were arranged by Supporters Clubs in a bid to block any move to the Maze.\n\nIn September 2009, the Irish Football Association (IFA) announced that its preferred option was to remain at a redeveloped Windsor Park. In 2011, the Northern Ireland Executive allocated £138m for a major programme of stadium redevelopment throughout Northern Ireland, with £28m allocated to the redevelopment of Windsor Park into a 20,000-capacity all-seater stadium.\n\nIn 2012, details of the stadium's redevelopment were released. The plan would see Windsor Park become an 18,000 all-seater stadium with a series of phased works originally intended to begin in the summer of 2013. Plans included the demolition of both the Railway and South Stand structures to be replaced by new stands that would partially enclose the stadium, the complete renovation of the existing North and West Stands, and construction of both new conferencing facilities and a new headquarters facility for the IFA.\n\nIn February 2013, planning permission for the redevelopment was granted, with the estimated cost of the project around £29.2 million, of which £25.2 million would come from government funding. It was planned for the work to begin in September 2013. Two months later however, an application for leave for judicial review of the government funding was lodged by Crusaders, who claimed that it was against European Union competition laws and also a form of state aid to Linfield. In a hearing that took place on 22 May 2013, Crusaders' request was granted, after the judge ruled that they had presented an arguable case that the redevelopment could be classified as state aid towards Linfield. The aspect of the challenge concerning competition law however, was thrown out.\n\nIn July 2013, Crusaders agreed to a possible settlement brought forward by the judicial review. The details of the settlement were not forthcoming, but Crusaders said that it had the \"\"potential to benefit the entirety of the football family\"\". In September 2013, sports minister Carál Ní Chuilín said that she was still committed to making sure the redevelopment went ahead as scheduled, after previously stating that she would not sign off on the funding until the IFA sorted out the \"governance issues\" surrounding David Martin's return to the role of deputy president. In December 2013, three months after the work was originally scheduled to begin, the redevelopment was finally given the green light, with the sports minister signing off on £31 million of funding to complete the project. In May 2014, work finally got under way on the stadium redevelopment.\n\nIn March 2015, following a Euro 2016 qualifying game against Finland, large cracks were found in the West Stand; this part of the stadium was scheduled for renovation rather than replacement as part of the redevelopment project. As a consequence, the area around the stand had to be sealed off, and led to the 2015 Irish Cup Final being moved to The Oval. The preliminary structural report delivered to the IFA recommended that the damaged stand be demolished. Having accepted this report, the IFA confirmed that the West Stand would be demolished in time to ensure the safety of the stadium for Northern Ireland's qualifier against Romania on 10 June, as well as stating that work on the redevelopment project would be accelerated so that the stadium could meet its 10,000 planned capacity for the game. Plans for a new West Stand were approved in November 2015, funded by the insurance on the old facility. The new structure was intended to be ready in time for Northern Ireland's World Cup qualifier against San Marino in October 2016.\n\n"}

He is best known for his appearances with World Championship Wrestling between 1992 and 1994 under the ring name Tex Slazenger and with the World Wrestling Federation between 1996 and 2001 under the ring names Phineas I. Godwinn and Mideon.\n\nKnight grew up in Clearwater, Florida. He attended Salem College in Salem, West Virginia, where he played American football for the Tigers. After suffering a severe shoulder injury, Knight left Salem College and returned to Florida, where he worked as a bouncer.\n\nWhile working as a bouncer in Clearwater, Florida, Knight was introduced to Steve Keirn, who trained him as a professional wrestler. He debuted in 1989 under the ring name \"Tex Slazenger\", facing his stepfather, Ron Slinker, in his first match. Knight went on to wrestle on the independent circuit in the Carolinas.\n\nIn 1991, Knight joined the Memphis, Tennessee-based United States Wrestling Association, where he adopted the ring name \"Leatherface\" and a gimmick based on the character from the 1974 film \"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre\", complete with \"bloodstained\" apron, leather mask and chainsaw (without the chain). He was pushed as a \"monster\" in a feud with Jerry Lawler. During one infamous match between the two, Knight was set on fire. After dropping the Leatherface gimmick, Tex teamed up with Mark Canterbury who wrestled as the masked \"Master Blaster\".\n\nAfter leaving the USWA, Knight wrestled in Florida, Puerto Rico and Japan before receiving a tryout with World Championship Wrestling in 1992.\n\nIn 1992, Knight was hired by World Championship Wrestling, where he was renamed \"Tex Slazenger\" and given the character of an \"ornery Texas outlaw\". Knight formed a tag team with Shanghai Pierce. Knight and Pierce left WCW in 1994.\n\nWhen both men left WCW, Canterbury signed with the World Wrestling Federation under the ring name \"Henry Godwinn\" while Slazinger returned to the USWA. In the USWA, Slazinger captured the USWA Southern Title on two occasions, defeating Brian Christopher both times.\n\nIn 1996, Knight signed with the WWF and was therefore reunited with Canterbury and renamed \"Phineas I. Godwinn\" (abbreviated to P.I.G.). The duo were portrayed as being cousins and were collectively known as The Godwinns. Phineas made his in-ring debut on the January 29 episode of \"Monday Night Raw\" in a tag team victory for Godwinns over The Bodydonnas and began a feud with Bodydonnas over their manager Sunny. They soon entered a tournament for the vacant Tag Team Championship and defeated The New Rockers and Owen Hart and British Bulldog to qualify for the finals on the March 31 episode of \"Free for All\", where they lost to Bodydonnas. They failed to win the titles from Bodydonnas in a rematch for the titles at . On May 19, Godwinns defeated Bodydonnas to win the Tag Team Championship at a live event in Madison Square Garden. As a result, they gained Bodydonnas' valet Sunny as their manager on the May 26 episode of \"Free for All\", where they lost their newly won titles to The Smoking Gunns.\n\nIn 1997, in a match between The Godwinns and the Legion of Doom, Canterbury suffered a cracked C7 vertebra when the Legion of Doom botched a Doomsday Device. He was advised by doctors to rest for 15 weeks, but returned to the ring in less than eight weeks. In early 1998, the Godwinns dropped their pig farmer gimmicks and became \"Southern Justice\", the bodyguards of Tennessee Lee, using their real names. Six months later, Canterbury herniated his C7 vertebra and pinched a spinal nerve, necessitating spinal fusion surgery. This came as a result of him returning to the ring too early after his neck injury. He eventually left the WWF and retired, due to the neck injury suffered in 1997 leaving Knight without a partner.\n\nIn late 1998, Knight returned to the WWF after a brief hiatus, and in a short time, was kidnapped by the Acolytes and brainwashed into joining the Ministry of Darkness, a heel Satanic-themed stable led by The Undertaker, who rechristened him as the deranged soothsayer \"Midian\" (spelling later changed to \"Mideon\"). Throughout 1999, The Ministry feuded with Stone Cold Steve Austin, with Mideon often teaming up with Viscera. Mideon \"won\" the European Championship in this time when he found it in Shane McMahon's bag. When The Undertaker was injured in late 1999, the Ministry disbanded, however, Mideon continued the gimmick and the unit with Viscera, including doing The Undertaker's biddings in matches well after The Ministry had dissolved, although no clear stable was ever established again.\n\nIn late 1999, Knight appeared briefly as a Mankind imitator and teamed with Ivory in intergender matches on Heat.\n\nKnight returned in a limited capacity in 2000 as Naked Mideon, a persona who ran around arenas wearing only a fanny pack, a pair of boots and a thong. At No Mercy 2000 he tried to reclaim the European Championship from William Regal, but was defeated. At Armageddon 2000, Knight briefly interfered in the match between Chris Jericho and Kane. Knight then wrestled in a few dark matches under his previous moniker Tex Slazenger, but was released in January 2001.\n\nFollowing his run with the WWF, Knight returned to his home in Tampa, Florida and spent time training students at Steve Keirn's Pro Wrestling school. During this time he also continued to wrestle for several Florida independent promotions such as IPW and the FSPW, as well as touring Europe.\n\nFrom 2003 to 2004, Knight returned for several dark matches for World Wrestling Entertainment under his own name.\n\nKnight appeared at the Total Nonstop Action Wrestling event TNA Destination X 2005 on March 13, 2005 during the scheduled match between Monty Brown and Trytan. In the course of the match, the lights went off and Trytan vanished from the ring. When the lights came on, a masked Knight was in his place and was quickly pinned by Brown. TNA never revealed on air who was under the mask and released Knight the following day. \nKnight retired from professional wrestling in 2006.\n\nAfter retiring from professional wrestling, Knight began working as a chef in Clearwater, Florida.\n\nKnight has an eyeball tattooed on the back of his head and a tattoo of Doc Holliday on his left arm. He also has other tattoos on both of his arms including a Confederate flag on his right arm.\n\n\n\n"}

By using VoiceOver, the user can access their Macintosh or iOS device based on spoken descriptions and, in the case of the Mac, the keyboard. The feature is designed to increase accessibility for blind and low-vision users, as well as for users with dyslexia.\n\nVoiceOver was first introduced in Mac OS X 10.4 and the target was users who had difficulty in reading due to vision impairment, particularly the blind. A preview had also been made available for Mac OS X 10.3 Panther, and was titled \"Spoken Interface Preview.\"\n\nVoiceOver treats the user interface as a hierarchy of elements, which are navigated by various keystrokes. Elements also are \"interacted\" with—for example, interacting with a text box allows reading its text and, if possible, editing it; interacting with a scroll bar allows it to be moved using the keyboard.\n\nVoiceOver also includes support for many Braille displays for those who are both blind and deaf. In addition, VoiceOver includes features for those that cannot use the mouse, such as keyboard-based navigation.\n\nFor users with MacBooks or Magic Trackpads, a number of special multitouch features are also available. The trackpad will respond to gestures, much like iOS's version of VoiceOver. A specific example is using the trackpad to explore the actual visual layout of elements on the screen - sliding one's finger around the trackpad will activate elements.\n\nIn Mac OS X 10.5, Apple added the \"Alex\" voice, which offered improved quality of speech and a more human-like sound. Previously, the voices were directly descended from those used in Apple's \"Speech Manager,\" which originated in the early 1990s. Also, Alex voice has natural breathing, unlike all other voices in Apple.\n\nIn Mac OS X 10.7, Apple offered the download of RealSpeak voices from Nuance for use with VoiceOver.\n\nAccessibility Inspector is made to verify the accessibility of OS X applications. It displays information about the GUI element that is currently under the cursor.\n\nAfter its success on Macs, Apple added VoiceOver to the iPod Shuffle. This assists users of the iPod Shuffle in controlling the playback of songs by having titles read out. With the 2010 revision of iPod Shuffle, the user can also have VoiceOver read out playlists. Unlike VoiceOver on OS X, where VoiceOver is marketed as an accessibility feature, on the iPod Shuffle VoiceOver is intended to be used by everyone, disabled or not.\n\nA few months later, with the release of the iPhone 3GS, VoiceOver was added to iOS. When the iPod Touch was upgraded to match the hardware of the iPhone 3GS (in iPod touch's third generation), it also gained VoiceOver capability. The iPad, since its introduction, has also had VoiceOver capability.\n\nVoiceOver on iOS interacts with the user by using various \"gestures,\" different motions one makes with one or more fingers on the display. Many gestures are location-sensitive—for example, sliding one's finger around the screen will reveal the visual contents of the screen as the finger passes over them. This enables blind users to explore the actual on-screen layout of an application. A user can double-tap—similar to double-clicking a mouse—to activate a selected element, just as if a sighted user had tapped the item.\n\nVoiceOver can also turn off the display but leave the touch screen sensitive to touch, saving battery power. Apple calls this feature \"Screen Curtain\". It is also available on Mac computers running OS X.\n\nVoiceOver for iOS is activated using the \"Settings\" application. It can be found in the Accessibility section under the General section. The device can also be configured so that VoiceOver can be toggled by a triple-click of the Home button on the device.\n\nIn September 2009, Apple launched this feature on the iPod nano line. It uses many of the same gestures as the iOS version.\n\n"}

He is best known for his appearances in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) from 1997 to 2002 under the ring name Tiger Ali Singh. He is the son of professional wrestler Tiger Jeet Singh.\n\nHans trained to be a professional wrestler by Antonio Inoki in the New Japan Pro-Wrestling Dojo and under Ron Hutchison and Sweet Daddy Siki at Sully's Gym in Toronto. He debuted as a professional wrestler in November 1992 under the ring name \"Tiger Jeet Singh, Jr.\", teaming with his father against Atsushi Onita and Tarzan Goto in a tag team match for Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling.\n\nSingh signed with the World Wrestling Federation in January 1997, with the signing announced at a press conference at SkyDome in Toronto. Singh's most notable accomplishment in the company occurred in 1997, when he won the second WWF Kuwait Cup Tournament, held on April 9, 1997 in Kuwait City. He defeated Owen Hart in the finals to become the second and final WWF Kuwait Cup winner. He would also participate and be managed by his father at the WWF's United Kingdom-exclusive pay-per-view event One Night Only on September 20, 1997, facing off against and defeating Leif Cassidy.\n\nHe made his official WWF debut on the April 21, 1997 episode of \"Raw\". He would disappear from WWF television until the Attitude Era. His gimmick was that of a rich and arrogant heir to a fortune (similar to Ted DiBiase's character). He came to the ring accompanied by a manservant named Babu, and would pay random people in the audience each week to perform humiliating stunts. On the Sunday night Heat before Survivor Series (1998), Singh lost to Val Venis and at Capital Carnage he defeated Edge. at the Royal Rumble (1999), Singh competed in the royal rumble match where he was eliminated by Mabel. On Sunday Night Heat before Singh faced Billy Gunn which ended in a no contest. on Sunday Night Heat before WrestleMania XV, Singh competed in a Battle Royal to determine #1 contenders to the WWF Tag Team Championship which was won by D'Lo Brown and Test and at No Mercy (UK), Singh defeated Gillberg.\n\nSingh was later sent to Puerto Rico to work on his in-ring skills. He returned in late 2000 as the manager of Lo Down (D'Lo Brown and Chaz). Lo Down and Singh were eventually sent to International Wrestling Association in Puerto Rico, removing them from WWF programming as The Invasion of 2001 started. Down in IWA, Singh became a two-time tag team champion. He eventually suffered what he claimed was a career-ending injury and was sent home to Toronto to recover. He was later released from his contract in July 2002.\n\nThe following month, Singh filed a $7 million lawsuit against World Wrestling Entertainment. Among his claims were that his career-ending injury was the result of being forced to wrestle in the rain while in Puerto Rico. He also accused other WWE wrestlers of frequently calling him \"taxi driver\", and that he was the victim of a stunt in 1999 where his turban was stuffed with garbage. WWE attorney Jerry McDevitt countered by noting that the company was not responsible for any injuries occurring in a different organization, and that Singh's contract could legally be ended if he suffered an injury.\n\nIn late-2008, Hans, under the new ring name \"Mick Hans\", returned to wrestling as a part of the HUSTLE promotion in Japan. He made his return by teaming up with his father in a tag team match against Genichiro Tenryu and Shiro Koshinaka.\n\nOn June 5, 2010, Singh won a battle royal for MPW Wrestling.\n\nOn September 24, 2011, Singh and Daivari defeated Kaine and Darkko for SCW Wrestling.\n\nOn July 1, 2013, at an event called TigerFest, Singh and Harry Smith defeated Big Daddy V, Rhino and Darkko in a handicap match.\n\nOn July 1, 2014, at another event called TigerFest, Singh and Rhino match ended in a no contest which led to another match where Singh, Davey Boy Smith Jr. and Sonjay Dutt defeated Rhino, Soa Amin and Steve Corino in a best 2 out of 3 falls match, falls count anywhere match.\n\n\n"}

James Island lies between Sidney Island and the coast of Vancouver Island near Sidney, British Columbia. James Island has an elevation of above sea level at its highest point, and has a total land-mass of in size. There are sea-cliffs on the Southern, Western, and Eastern shores of this island. The Southern sea-cliffs are the highest.\n\nIn SENĆOŦEN, the language of the WSÁNEĆ nations, the island is named P'AQƎČ.\n\nAccording to Walbran the island was \"Named by the early settlers, \"circa\" 1853, after ... James Douglas ...\". Douglas was a chief factor of the Hudson's Bay Company and was second governor of the Colony of Vancouver Island. Further, Walbran stated \"Name adopted by Captain Richards, HMS \"Plumper\", 1858.\" From 1857 to 1862 Richards supervised hydrographic surveys of the southern coast of British Columbia.\n\nThe island is within the traditional territories of the Tsawout First Nation. Hereditary chief Louie Pelkey of the Tsawout was born on the island in 1860. Although it is east of the North Saanich Douglas Treaty area and south of the Hul'q'umin'um Treaty area, it is not within a Douglas Treaty area. In the early 1900s, the island was used as a private hunting ground for Victoria sportsmen including then British Columbia Premier Richard McBride, who served between 1903 and 1915. In 1913 a dynamite plant was established on the island. The plant was owned by a company that merged into Canadian Explosives Ltd, which in turn changed its name to Canadian Industries Limited (CIL) in 1927. From the outset of World War II, the plant was operated by Defence Industries Ltd, a subsidiary of CIL. The plant, and many of its workers' cottages, had been moved to the island from Nanaimo. At its peak, the plant employed 800 people, most of whom lived in a small, traffic-free village on the opposite end of the island. During World War II, the plant produced of TNT per month. The TNT plant closed in 1977, and it and the village were disassembled and removed from the island in 1979.\n\nJames Island was purchased by Craig McCaw in 1994 for $19 million. Since then there was repeated legal action taken against ICI (formerly CIL) as the new owner was unable to turn over the property to residential use as per his intention due to its industrial history, a status which had been well-documented as of the sale. Recent luxury resort development on the island includes a golf course, yacht moorage, seaplane ramp, and an airstrip.\n\nMcCaw has reportedly established an environmental regime on James Island where insecticides are not allowed, power lines are underground and electric cars and golf carts are used for transportation. The island was the property with the highest assessed value in the Capital Regional District in 2009, at almost $76 million. In June, 2012, the island was put on the market with an asking price of $75 million. The Island is no longer listed and reportedly no longer for sale.\n\nIn the Biogeoclimatic Ecosystem Classification of the British Columbia Forest Service the island is entirely Coastal Douglas Fir Lowland.\n\nThe island is within the Capital Regional District and also within the North Pender Island Local Trust Area of the Islands Trust. Land use is governed by the Trust with representation by the North Pender Local Trust Committee. Local government matters other than land use are governed by the Regional District with representation for the Southern Gulf Islands, Electoral Area G, by one \nelected director.\n\nAlthough the North Pender Local Trust Committee has authority for land use and the island has no resident landowners, its official community plan and land use bylaws are independent of North Pender.\n\n<br>\n"}
{"id": "1874251", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1874251", "title": "Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39", "text": "Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39\n\nLaunch Complex 39 (LC-39) is a rocket launch site at the John F. Kennedy Space Center on Merritt Island in Florida, United States. The site and its collection of facilities were originally built as the Apollo program's \"Moonport\" and later modified for the Space Shuttle program.\n\nLaunch Complex 39 consists of three launch sub-complexes or \"pads\"—39A, 39B, and 39C—a Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB), a Crawlerway used by crawler-transporters to carry mobile launcher platforms between the VAB and the pads, Orbiter Processing Facility buildings, a Launch Control Center which contains the firing rooms, a news facility famous for the iconic countdown clock seen in television coverage and photos, and various logistical and operational support buildings.\n\nSpaceX leases Launch Complex 39A from NASA and has modified the pad to support Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launches.\nNASA began modifying Launch Complex 39B in 2007 to accommodate the now defunct Constellation program, and is currently preparing it for the Artemis program, whose first launch is scheduled for no earlier than June 2020. A pad to be designated 39C, which would have been a copy of pads 39A and 39B, was originally planned for Apollo but never built. A smaller pad, also designated 39C, was constructed from January to June 2015, to accommodate small-lift launch vehicles.\n\nNASA launches from pads 39A and 39B have been supervised from the NASA Launch Control Center (LCC), located from the launch pads. LC-39 is one of several launch sites that share the radar and tracking services of the Eastern Test Range.\n\nNorthern Merritt Island was first developed around 1890 when a few wealthy Harvard University graduates purchased and constructed a three-story mahogany clubhouse, very nearly on the site of Pad 39A. During the 1920s, Peter E. Studebaker Jr., son of the automobile magnate, built a small casino at De Soto Beach north of the Canaveral lighthouse.\n\nIn 1948, the Navy transferred the former Banana River Naval Air Station, located south of Cape Canaveral, to the Air Force for use in testing captured German V-2 rockets. The site's location on the East Florida coast was ideal for this purpose, in that launches would be over the ocean, away from populated areas. This site became the Joint Long Range Proving Ground in 1949 and was renamed Patrick Air Force Base in 1950. The Air Force annexed part of Cape Canaveral, to the north, in 1951, forming the Air Force Missile Test Center, the future Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS). Missile and rocketry testing and development would take place here through the 1950s.\n\nAfter the creation of NASA in 1958, the CCAFS launch pads were used for NASA's civilian uncrewed and crewed launches, including those of Project Mercury and Project Gemini.\n\nIn 1961, President Kennedy proposed to Congress the goal of landing a man on the Moon by the end of the decade. Congressional approval led to the launch of the Apollo program, which required a massive expansion of NASA operations, including an expansion of launch operations from the Cape to adjacent Merritt Island to the north and west. NASA began acquisition of land in 1962, taking title to by outright purchase and negotiating with the state of Florida for an additional . On July 1, 1962, the site was named the Launch Operations Center.\n\nAt the time, the highest numbered launch pad at CCAFS was Launch Complex 37. When the lunar launch complex was designed, it was designated as Launch Complex 39. It was designed to handle launches of the Saturn V rocket, the largest, most powerful rocket then designed, which would propel Apollo spacecraft to the Moon. Initial plans envisioned four pads (five were considered) evenly spaced apart to avoid damage in the event of an explosion on a pad. Three were scheduled for construction (A, B, and C, to the southeast), and two (D and E, west and north) would have been built at a later date. The numbering of the pads at the time was from north to south, with the northernmost being 39A, and the southernmost being 39C. Pad 39A was never built, and 39C became 39A in 1963. With today's numbering, 39C would have been north of 39B, and 39D would have been due west of 39C. Pad 39E would have been due north of the midpoint between 39C and 39D, with 39E forming the top of a triangle, and equidistant from 39C and 39D. The Crawlerway was built with the additional pads in mind. This is the reason the Crawlerway turns as it heads to Pad B; continuing straight from that turn would have led to the additional pads.\n\nMonths before a launch, the three stages of the Saturn V launch vehicle and the components of the Apollo spacecraft were brought inside the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) and assembled, in one of four bays, into a -tall space vehicle on one of three Mobile Launchers (ML). Each Mobile Launcher consisted of a two-story, launcher platform with four hold-down arms and a Launch Umbilical Tower (LUT) topped by a crane used to lift the spacecraft elements into position for assembly. The ML and unfueled vehicle together weighed .\n\nThe umbilical tower contained two elevators and nine retractable swing arms that were extended to the space vehicle—to provide access to each of the three rocket stages and the spacecraft for people, wiring, and plumbing—while the vehicle was on the launch pad and were swung away from the vehicle at launch. Technicians, engineers, and astronauts used the uppermost Spacecraft Access Arm to access the crew cabin. At the end of the arm, the white room provided an environmentally controlled and protected area for astronauts and their equipment before entering the spacecraft.\n\nWhen the stack integration was completed, the Mobile Launcher was moved atop one of two crawler-transporters, or Missile Crawler Transporter Facilities, to its pad at a speed of . Each crawler weighed and was capable of keeping the space vehicle and its launcher platform level while negotiating the 5 percent grade to the pad. At the pad, the ML was placed on six steel pedestals, plus four additional extensible columns.\n\nAfter the ML was set in place, the crawler-transporter rolled a , Mobile Service Structure (MSS) into place to provide further access for technicians to perform a detailed checkout of the vehicle, and to provide necessary umbilical connections to the pad. The MSS contained three elevators, two self-propelled platforms, and three fixed platforms. It was rolled back to a parking position shortly before launch.\n\nWhile the ML was sat on its launch pedestals, one of two flame deflectors was slid on rails into place under it. Having two deflectors allowed for one to be used while the other was being refurbished after a previous launch. Each deflector measured high by wide by long, and weighed . During a launch, it deflected the launch vehicle's rocket exhaust flame into a trench measuring deep by wide by long.\n\nThe four-story Launch Control Center (LCC) was located away from Pad A, adjacent to the Vehicle Assembly Building, for safety. The third floor had four firing rooms (corresponding to the four bays in the VAB), each with 470 sets of control and monitoring equipment. The second floor contained telemetry, tracking, instrumentation, and data reduction computing equipment. The LCC was connected to the Mobile Launcher Platforms by a high-speed data link; and during launch a system of 62 closed-circuit television cameras transmitted to 100 monitor screens in the LCC.\n\nLarge cryogenic tanks located near the pads stored the liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen (LOX) for the second and third stages of the Saturn V. The highly explosive nature of these chemicals required numerous safety measures at the launch complex. The pads were located away from each other. Before tanking operations began and during launch, non-essential personnel were excluded from the danger area.\n\nEach pad had a evacuation tube running from the Mobile Launcher platform to a blast-resistant bunker underground, equipped with survival supplies for 20 persons for 24 hours. There was also a cab/slidewire system running from the tower level to evacuate astronauts and technicians away from the pad.\n\nConnections between the Launch Control Center, Mobile Launcher Platform, and space vehicle were made in the Pad Terminal Connection Room (PTCR), which was a two-story series of rooms located beneath the launch pad on the west side of the flame trench. The \"room\" was constructed of reinforced concrete and protected by up to of fill dirt.\n\nThe first launch from Launch Complex 39 came in 1967 with the first Saturn V launch, which carried the uncrewed Apollo 4 spacecraft. The second uncrewed launch, Apollo 6, also used Pad 39A. With the exception of Apollo 10, which used Pad 39B (due to the \"all-up\" testing resulting in a 2-month turnaround period), all crewed Apollo-Saturn V launches, commencing with Apollo 8, used Pad 39A.\n\nA total of thirteen Saturn Vs were launched for Apollo, and the uncrewed launch of the Skylab space station in 1973. The mobile launchers were then modified for the shorter Saturn IB rockets, by adding a \"milk-stool\" extension platform to the launch pedestal, so that the S-IVB upper stage and Apollo spacecraft swing arms would reach their targets. These were used for three crewed Skylab flights and the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, since the Saturn IB pads 34 and 37 at Cape Canaveral AFS had been decommissioned.\n\nThe thrust to allow the Space Shuttle to achieve orbit was provided by a combination of the Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) and the RS-25 engines. The SRBs used solid propellant, hence their name. The RS-25 engines used a combination of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen (LOX) from the external tank (ET), as the orbiter did not have room for internal fuel tanks. The SRBs arrived in segments via rail car from their manufacturing facility in Utah, the external tank arrived from its manufacturing facility in Louisiana by barge, and the orbiter waited in the Orbiter Processing Facility (OPF). The SRBs were first stacked in the VAB, then the External tank was mounted between them, and then, with the help of a massive crane, the orbiter was lowered and connected to the External tank.\n\nThe payload to be installed at the launch pad was independently transported in a payload transportation canister and then installed vertically at the Payload Changeout Room. Otherwise, payloads would have already been pre-installed at the Orbiter Processing Facility and transported within the orbiter's cargo bay.\n\nThe original structure of the pads was remodeled for the needs of the Space Shuttle, starting with Pad 39A after the last Saturn V launch, and, in 1977, that of Pad 39B after the Apollo-Soyuz in 1975. The first usage of the pad for the Space Shuttle came in 1979, when \"Enterprise\" was used to check the facilities prior to the first operational launch.\n\nEach pads contained a two-piece access tower system, the Fixed Service Structure (FSS) and the Rotating Service Structure (RSS). The FSS permitted access to the Shuttle via a retractable arm and a \"beanie cap\" to capture vented LOX from the external tank.\n\nA Sound Suppression Water System (SSWS) was added to protect the Space Shuttle and its payload from effects of the intense sound wave pressure generated by its engines. An elevated water tank on a tower near each pad stored of water, which was released onto the mobile launcher platform just before engine ignition. The water muffled the intense sound waves produced by the engines. Due to heating of the water, a large quantity of steam and water vapor was produced during launch.\n\nThe Gaseous Oxygen Vent Arm positioned a hood, often called the \"Beanie Cap\", over the top of the external tank (ET) nose cone during fueling. Heated gaseous nitrogen was used there to remove the extremely cold gaseous oxygen that normally vented out of the external tank. This prevented the formation of ice that could fall and damage the shuttle.\n\nThe Hydrogen Vent Line Access Arm mated the External Tank's Ground Umbilical Carrier Plate (GUCP) to the launch pad hydrogen vent line. The GUCP provided support for plumbing and cables, called umbilicals, that transferred fluids, gases, and electrical signals between two pieces of equipment. While the External Tank was being fueled, hazardous gas was vented from an internal hydrogen tank, through the GUCP, and out a vent line to a flare stack where it was burned off at a safe distance. Sensors at the GUCP measured gas level. The GUCP was redesigned after leaks created scrubs of STS-127 and were also detected during attempts to launch STS-119 and STS-133. The GUCP released from the ET at launch and fell away with a curtain of water sprayed across it for protection from flames.\n\nIn an emergency, the launch complex used a slidewire escape basket system for quick evacuation. Assisted by members of the closeout team, the crew would leave the orbiter and ride an emergency basket to the ground at speeds reaching up to . From there, the crew took shelter in a bunker. A modified M113 Armored Personnel Carrier could carry injured astronauts away from the complex to safety.\n\nDuring the launch of Discovery on STS-124 on May 31, 2008, the pad at LC-39A suffered extensive damage, in particular to the concrete trench used to deflect the SRB's flames. The subsequent investigation found that the damage was the result of carbonation of epoxy and corrosion of steel anchors that held the refractory bricks in the trench in place. The damage had been exacerbated by the fact that hydrochloric acid is an exhaust by-product of the solid rocket boosters.\n\nAfter the launch of Skylab in 1973, Pad 39A was reconfigured for the Space Shuttle, with shuttle launches beginning with STS-1 in 1981, flown by the . After Apollo 10, Pad 39B was kept as a backup launch facility in the case of the destruction of 39A, but saw active service during all three Skylab missions, the Apollo-Soyuz test flight, and a contingency Skylab Rescue flight that never became necessary. After the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, 39B was reconfigured similarly to 39A; but due to additional modifications (mainly to allow the facility to service a modified Centaur-G upper stage), along with budgetary restraints, it was not ready until 1986. The first shuttle flight to use it was STS-51-L, which ended with the \"Challenger\" disaster, after which the first return-to-flight mission, STS-26, was launched from 39B.\n\nJust as for the first 24 shuttle flights, LC-39A supported the final shuttle flights, starting with STS-117 in June 2007 and ending with the retirement of the Shuttle fleet in July 2011. Prior to the SpaceX lease agreement, the pad remained as it was when \"Atlantis\" launched on the final shuttle mission on July 8, 2011, complete with a mobile launcher platform.\n\nWith the retirement of the Space Shuttle in 2011,\nand the cancellation of Constellation Program in 2010, the future of the Launch Complex 39 pads was uncertain.\nBy early 2011, NASA began informal discussions on use of the pads and facilities by private companies to fly missions for the commercial space market, culminating in a 20-year lease agreement with SpaceX for Pad 39A.\n\nTalks for use of the pad were underway between NASA and Space Florida—the State of Florida's economic development agency—as early as 2011, but no deal materialized by 2012, and NASA then pursued other options for removing the pad from the federal government inventory.\n\nThe last Shuttle launch from pad 39B was the nighttime launch of STS-116 on December 9, 2006. To support the final Shuttle mission to the Hubble Space Telescope STS-125 launched from pad 39A in May 2009, \"Endeavour\" was placed on 39B if needed to launch the STS-400 rescue mission.\n\nAfter the completion of STS-125, 39B was converted to launch the single test flight of the \"Constellation Program\" Ares I-X on October 28, 2009. This program was later cancelled.\n\nBy early 2013, NASA publicly announced that it would allow commercial launch providers to lease LC-39A, and followed that, in May 2013, with a formal solicitation for proposals for commercial use of the pad.\nThere were two competing bids for the commercial use of the launch complex. SpaceX submitted a bid for exclusive use of the launch complex, while Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin submitted a bid for shared non-exclusive use of the complex, so that the launchpad would handle multiple vehicles, and costs could be shared over the long-term. One potential shared user in the Blue Origin plan was United Launch Alliance. Prior to the end of the bid period, and prior to any public announcement by NASA of the results of the process, Blue Origin filed a protest with the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) \"over what it says is a plan by NASA to award an exclusive commercial lease to SpaceX for use of mothballed space shuttle launch pad 39A.\" NASA had planned to complete the bid award and have the pad transferred by October 1, 2013, but the protest \"will delay any decision until the GAO reaches a decision, expected by mid-December.\" On December 12, 2013, the GAO denied the protest and sided with NASA, which argued that the solicitation contained no preference on the use of the facility as multi-use or single-use. \"The [solicitation] document merely asks bidders to explain their reasons for selecting one approach instead of the other and how they would manage the facility.\"\n\nOn April 14, 2014, the privately owned launch service provider SpaceX signed a 20-year lease for Launch Complex 39A (LC-39A). The pad was modified to support launches of both Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launch vehicles, modifications that included the construction of a large Horizontal Integration Facility (HIF) similar to that used at existing SpaceX-leased facilities at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and Vandenberg Air Force Base, horizontal integration being markedly difference from the vertical integration process used to assemble NASA's Apollo and Space Shuttle vehicles at the launch complex. Additionally, new instrumentation and control systems were installed, and substantial new plumbing was added for a variety of rocket liquids and gases.\n\nIn 2015, SpaceX built the Horizontal Integration Facility just outside the perimeter of the existing launch pad in order to house both the Falcon 9 and the Falcon Heavy rockets, and their associated hardware and payloads, during preparation for flight. Both types of launch vehicles will be transported from the HIF to the launch pad aboard a Transporter Erector (TE) which will ride on rails up the former crawlerway path. Also in 2015, the launch mount for the Falcon Heavy was constructed on Pad 39A over the existing infrastructure. The work on both the HIF building and the pad was substantially complete by late 2015. A rollout test of the new Transporter Erector was conducted in November 2015.\n\nIn February 2016, SpaceX indicated that they had \"completed and activated Launch Complex 39A\", but still had more work yet to do to support crewed flights. SpaceX originally planned to be ready to accomplish the first launch at pad 39A—of a Falcon Heavy—as early as 2015, as they had had architects and engineers working on the new design and modifications since 2013. By late 2014, a preliminary date for a wet dress rehearsal of the Falcon Heavy was set for no earlier than July 1, 2015. Due to a failure in a June 2015 Falcon 9 launch, SpaceX had to delay launching the Falcon Heavy in order to focus on the Falcon 9's failure investigation and its return to flight. In early 2016, considering the busy Falcon 9 launch manifest, it became unclear if the Falcon Heavy would be the first vehicle to launch from Pad 39A, or if one or more Falcon 9 missions would precede a Falcon Heavy launch. In the following months, the Falcon Heavy launch was delayed multiple times and eventually pushed back to February 2018.\n\nIn 2019, SpaceX began substantial modification to LC 39A in order to begin work on phase 1 of the construction to prepare the facility to launch prototypes of the large -diameter methalox reusable rocket—Starship—from a launch stand, which will fly from 39A on suborbital test flight trajectories with six or fewer Raptor engines. A second phase of the construction is planned for 2020 to build a much more capable launch mount capable of launching the entire Starship launch vehicle, powered by 43 Raptor engines and producing a total of liftoff thrust when departing 39A.\n\nThe first SpaceX launch from pad 39A was SpaceX CRS-10 on February 19, 2017, using a Falcon 9 launch vehicle; it was the company's 10th cargo resupply mission to the International Space Station, and the first uncrewed launch from 39A since Skylab.\n\nWhile Cape Canaveral's Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40) was undergoing reconstruction after the loss of the AMOS-6 satellite on September 1, 2016, all SpaceX's east coast launches were from Pad 39A until SLC-40 became operational again in December 2017. These included the May 1, 2017, launch of NROL-76, the first SpaceX mission for the National Reconnaissance Office, with a classified payload.\n\nOn February 6, 2018, Pad 39A hosted the successful liftoff of the Falcon Heavy on its maiden launch, carrying Elon Musk's Tesla Roadster car to space; and the first flight of the human-rated spacecraft Crew Dragon (Dragon 2) took place there on March 2, 2019.\n\nThe second Falcon Heavy flight, carrying the Arabsat-6A communications satellite for Arabsat of Saudi Arabia, successfully launched on April 11, 2019. The satellite is to provide K band and K band communication services for the Middle East and northern Africa, as well as for South Africa. The launch was notable as it marked the first time that SpaceX was able to successfully soft-land all three of the reusable booster stages, which will be refurbished for future launches.\n\nThe SpaceX Demo-2 − the first crewed test flight of the Crew Dragon \"Endeavour\" spacecraft, with astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley aboard launched from Complex 39A on May 30, 2020, will dock to Pressurized Mating Adapter 2 on the Harmony module of the ISS on 31 May 2020.\n\nOn April 14, 2014, the private American aerospace manufacturer and space transportation services company SpaceX signed a lease agreement that gave it a 20-year exclusive lease on LC-39A. SpaceX has launched their launch vehicles from the pad and built a new hangar nearby.\nElon Musk, CEO of SpaceX, stated that he wanted to shift most of SpaceX's NASA launches to LC-39A, including commercial cargo and crew missions to the International Space Station.\n\nSpaceX utilizes the former Fixed Service Structure (FSS) of the Pad 39A launch towers and intends to extend it above its former height. It did not need the Rotating Service Structure (RSS) and removed it beginning in February 2016.\n\nNASA removed the Orbiter Servicing Arm—with intent to use the space later to build a museum—and the white room by which astronauts entered the Space Shuttle. SpaceX indicated in late 2014 that additional levels to the FSS would not be added in the near term. SpaceX plans to eventually add at least two additional levels to the FSS, to provide crew access for the Dragon 2 launches.\n\nSpaceX assembles its launch vehicles horizontally in a hangar near the pad, and transports them horizontally to the pad before erecting the vehicle to vertical for the launch. For military missions from Pad 39A, payloads will be vertically integrated, as that is required per launch contract with the US Air Force. A hammerhead crane is planned to be added to the FSS in order to support US military requirements for vertical payload integration.\n\nPad 39A will be used to host launches of astronauts on the crewed-version of the Dragon space capsule in a public–private partnership with NASA. the NASA plan called for the first NASA crewed missions in 2017. SpaceX intends to add \"a crew gantry access arm and white room to allow for crew and cargo ingress to the vehicle. The existing Space Shuttle evacuation slide-wire basket system will also be re-purposed to provide a safe emergency egress for the Dragon crew in the event of an emergency on the pad that does not necessitate using the Crew Dragon's launch abort system.\"\n\nIn August 2018, SpaceX's Crew Access Arm (CAA) was installed on a new level, which was built at the necessary height to enter the Crew Dragon spacecraft atop a Falcon 9 rocket. In September 2018, the refurbished Space Shuttle Emergency Egress System was raised to this new level.\n\nAfter the Ares I-X test flight in 2009, NASA stripped Launch Complex 39B (LC-39B) of its Flight Service Structure (FSS), returning the location to an Apollo-like \"clean pad\" design for the first time since 1977. This approach is intended to make the pad available to multiple types of vehicles that will arrive at the pad with service structures on the mobile launcher platform, as opposed to using fixed structures on the pad. The LH, LOX, and water tanks used for the sound suppression system are the only structures left from the Space Shuttle era.\n\n, repairs and modifications to selected facility systems at LC-39B for Space Launch System (SLS) processing and launch operations, as part of the first phase of a five-phase project, were being completed. The second phase of this project is currently budgeted for $89.2 million.\n\nIn 2014, NASA announced that it would make LC-39B available to commercial users during times when it is not needed by the Space Launch System.\n\nLaunch Complex 39C is a new facility for small-lift launch vehicles. It was built in 2015 within the Launch Complex 39B perimeter. It will serve as a multi-purpose site allowing companies to test the vehicles and capabilities of the smaller class of rockets, making it more affordable for smaller companies to break into the commercial spaceflight market.\n\nConstruction of the pad began in January 2015 and was completed in June 2015. Kennedy Space Center director Robert D. Cabana and representatives from the Ground Systems Development and Operations (GSDO) Program and the Center Planning and Development (CPD) and Engineering directorates marked the completion of the new pad during a ribbon-cutting ceremony on July 17, 2015. \"As America's premier spaceport, we're always looking for new and innovative ways to meet America's launch needs, and one area that was missing was small class payloads\", Cabana said.\n\nThe concrete pad measures about wide by about long and could support the combined weight of a fueled launch vehicle, payload, and customer-provided launch mount up to about , and an umbilical tower structure, fluid lines, cables, and umbilical arms weighing up to about . There is a universal propellant servicing system to provide liquid oxygen and liquid methane fueling capabilities for a variety of small-class rockets.\n\nWith the addition of Launch Complex 39C, KSC can offer the following processing and launching features for companies working with small-class vehicles (maximum thrust up to ):\n\nPrevious Kennedy Space Center (KSC) Master Plan recommendations—in 1966, 1972, and 1977—noted that an expansion of KSC's vertical launch capacity could occur when the market demand existed. The 2007 Site Evaluation Study recommended an additional vertical launch pad, Launch Complex 49 (LC-49), to be sited north of existing LC-39B.\nAs part of the Environmental Impact Study (EIS) process, this proposed launch complex was consolidated from two pads (designated in the 1963 plans as 39C and 39D) to one that would provide greater separation from LC-39B. The area was expanded to accommodate a wider variety of launch azimuths, helping to protect against potential overflight concerns of LC-39B. This LC-49 launch facility could accommodate medium to large launch vehicles.\n\nThe 2007 Vertical Launch Site Evaluation Study concluded that a vertical launch pad could also be sited to the south of 39A, and to the north of pad 41, to accommodate small to medium launch vehicles. Designated as Launch Complex 48 (LC-48), this area is best suited to accommodate small to medium class launch vehicles, due to its closer proximity to LC-39A and LC-41. Due to the nature of these activities, required quantity-distance arcs, launch hazard impact limit lines, other safety setbacks, and exposure limits will be specified for safe operations. Details of the proposed launch pads were published in the Kennedy Space Center Master Plan in 2012.\n\nThe Master Plan also notes a proposed New Vertical Launchpad northwest of LC-39B and a Horizontal Launch Area north of the LC-49 and converting the Shuttle Landing Facility (SLF) and it apron areas into a second Horizontal Launch Area.\n\nSpace Florida has proposed that Launch Complex 48 be developed for use by Boeing's Phantom Express and that three landing pads be built for reusable booster systems, to provide more landing options for SpaceX's Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy, Blue Origin's New Glenn, and other potential reusable vehicles. The pads would be located east of the Horizontal Launch Area and north of LC-39B\n\nIn August 2019, SpaceX submitted an Environmental Assessment for Starship launch system at Kennedy Space Center. This document included plans for the construction of additional structures at LC-39A to support Starship launches, including a dedicated pad, liquid methane tanks, and a Landing Zone. These are separate from the existing structures that support Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launches.\n\n\n"}

They live an entirely aquatic lifestyle in the eastern part of North America in lakes, rivers, and ponds. They go through paedomorphosis and retain their external gills. Because skin and lung respiration alone is not sufficient for gas exchange, mudpuppies must rely on external gills as their primary means of gas exchange. They are usually a rusty brown color and can grow to an average length of . Mudpuppies are nocturnal creatures, and come out during the day only if the water in which they live is murky. Their diet consists of almost anything they can get in their mouths, including insects, mollusks, and earthworms (as well as other annelids). Once a female mudpuppy reaches sexual maturity at six years of age, she can lay an average of 60 eggs. In the wild, the average lifespan of a mudpuppy is 11 years.\n\nMudpuppies are small and can be compared to the size of a lizard. Mudpuppies can be a rusty brown color with gray and black and usually have blackish-blue spots, but some albino adults have been reported in Arkansas. In clear, light water, their skin gets darker, likewise in darker water, their skin gets lighter in color. At sexual maturity, mudpuppies can be long and continue to grow to an average length of , though specimens up to have been reported. Their external gills resemble ostrich plumes and their size depends on the oxygen levels present in the water. In stagnant water, mudpuppies have larger gills, whereas in running streams where oxygen is more prevalent, they have smaller gills. The distal portions of the gills are very filamentous and contain many capillaries. Mudpuppies also have small, flattened limbs which can be used for slowly walking on the bottoms of streams or ponds, or they can be flattened against the body during short swimming spurts. They have mucous glands which provide a slimy protective coating \n\nMudpuppies are one of many species of salamanders that fail to undergo metamorphosis. Most hypotheses surrounding the origin of \"Necturus\"'s lack of metamorphosis concern the effectiveness of the thyroid gland. The thyroid gland in some salamanders, like the axolotl, produce normal thyroid hormones (THs), but cells in the organism express thyroid hormone receptors (TR) that are mutated, and do not bond correctly with thyroid hormones, leading to some salamanders in a state of perpetual juvenile-hood. In contrast to Axolotls, in mudpuppies, these THs are normally expressed. However, it is believed that instead of having TH-insensitive tissues that block the effects of THs, some mudpuppy tissues, such as the external gills, have lost the ability to be regulated by TH over time. This selective insensitivity to THs suggests a normal level of activity in the hypothalamo-pituitary-thyroid axis in developing mudpuppies, unlike other salamander species.\n\nThe common mudpuppy also does not have a parathyroid gland. The majority of salamanders with parathyroid glands rely on them to help with hypercalcemic regulation; hypercalcemic regulation in mudpuppies is primarily done by the Pituitary gland instead. In common mudpuppies, the purpose of the absence of a parathyroid gland is poorly understood. One reason for the absence might be the lack of variability in the climate of mudpuppies, as the parathyroid glands of salamanders vary greatly depending on seasonal changes, or whether the organism hibernates.\n\n\"N. maculosus\" specimens live in streams, lakes, and ponds in the eastern part of North America. They appear in the southern section of Canada, as far south as Georgia, and from the Midwest United States to North Carolina. In the more northern sections, they are called mudpuppies, and in the southern portions, they are called waterdogs. The mudpuppy hides under cover such as rocks and logs during the day and becomes more active at night. However, in muddy waters, the mudpuppy may become active during the day. Mudpuppies can even live under the ice when lakes freeze.\n\nMudpuppies use rows of teeth to eat their prey. Salamanders have three different sets of teeth: dentary, premaxillary, and vomerine teeth, which are named due to their location in the mouth. All the teeth, despite their different locations, are very similar. They are small and conical, meaning mudpuppies are homodonts due to their similar shape. The common mudpuppy never leaves its aquatic environment and therefore does not undergo morphogenesis, however many salamanders do and develop differentiated teeth. Aquatic salamander teeth are used to hinder escape of the prey from the salamander, they do not have a crushing function. This aids the salamander when feeding. When the salamander undergoes the \"suck and gape\" feeding style, the prey is pulled into the mouth, and the teeth function to hold the prey inside the mouth and prevent the prey from escaping. At both sides of their mouths their lips interlock, which allows them to use suction feeding. They are carnivorous creatures and will eat almost anything they can get into their mouths. Typically they prey upon animals such as insects, mollusks, annelids, small fish, amphibians, earthworms, and spiders. The jaw of a mudpuppy also plays a significant role in its diet. The mudpuppy jaw is considered metaautostyly, like most amphibians, meaning the jaw is more stable and that the salamander has a dentary. This affects their diet by limiting the flexibility of the jaw to take in larger prey. The mudpuppy has few predators but may include fish, crayfish, turtles, and water snakes. Because fishermen frequently catch and discard them, humans are considered to be one of their main predators.\n\nMudpuppies take six years to reach sexual maturity. Mating typically takes place in autumn, though eggs are not laid till much later. When males are ready to breed, their cloacae become swollen. Males deposit their spermatophores in the substratum of the environment. The female will then pick them up with her cloaca and store them in a small specialized gland, a spermatheca, until the eggs are fertilized. Females store the sperm until ovulation and internal fertilization take place, usually just prior to deposition in the spring. Before the eggs are deposited, male mudpuppies leave the nest. Once ready, the female deposits the eggs in a safe location, usually on the underside of a rock or log. They can lay from 20–200 eggs, usually an average of 60. The eggs are not pigmented and are about  mm in diameter. The female stays with her eggs during the incubation period (around 40 days). Hatchlings are about long and grow to before the yolk is completely consumed.\n\n\n\n"}

He made a tremendous effort in encouraging Jews to study these works. With the assistance of his students, some yeshivot in Galicia added the study of Kabbalah to their curriculum. Rabbi Tzvi Hirsh blended the teachings of the Baal Shem Tov with the kabbalah of the \"Ari\".\n\nHis book \"Ateret Tzvi\" includes his commentary on the Zohar. In his book \"Sur Mei'ra Ve'asei Tov\" (lit., \"refrain from evil and do good\"), he shows the path to spiritual growth with the assistance of Zohar study and the \"Kitvei Ari\".\n\nRabbi Yitzchak Isaac of Komarna writes in one of his books that the soul of his teacher Rabbi Tzvi Hirsh is \"from the root of the soul of Rabbi Chaim Vital, which is close to the soul of Rabbi Akiva\".

The station broadcasts at a power of 100 kW, from a transmitter located near Wilton, Iowa. The signal can be received in both the Cedar Rapids and Iowa City areas.\n\nKBEA-FM is owned by Townsquare Media, with studios located in Davenport, Iowa (along with the co-located KJOC, WXLP, KIIK-FM and KBOB).\n\nThe Muscatine allocation for 99.7 MHz dates to February 1949, when the station signed on as KWPC-FM, a sister station to KWPC (860 AM). The studios for both stations were located on the outskirts of Muscatine.\n\nEarly in its history, KWPC-FM—like most FM stations of the 1950s and 1960s—played beautiful, easy listening music. In the late 1960s, the station's call letters changed to KFMH, but easy listening music continued on the frequency for several more years.\n\nIn June 1973, KFMH underwent a major format change as Captain Steve Bridges (who had worked at KSTT in Davenport) came in as program director (he later became a part-owner); the station began playing alternative rock, which had gained widespread popularity on the west coast. KFMH (\"99 Plus\" and \"The Real FM\" was how it was commonly known) soon gained a devoted, fiercely loyal audience, as the station played lesser-known and local artists in a variety of genres — rock, jazz, blues, and other genres. Plus, KFMH's disc jockeys Andy Hammer, Kerry Peace, Lisa Catalona, Beth McBride, Chris Carson, Borderline Bob, and later Sean Tracy, Phil and Tom Maicke, Mary of the Heartland, Bob Just Bob, Dirty Judy, Jim Hunter, Roberto Nache, John Obvious, and Captain Steve played album cuts from popular artists. The station was known for pushing the envelope at times, but it also would change programming at a moment's notice (such as when word spread about the shooting death of John Lennon in 1980).\n\nIn 1981, John Flambo became the new owner and immediately removed the one-and-a-half-hour farm report morning show and replaced it with Andy Hammer and a format matching the rest of the day. \"The Plus\" then made greater efforts to separate themselves from the rest of the radio dial with Kerry Peace hosting “Off the Beat n’ Track” presenting alternative and punk rock not heard anywhere else.\n\nThe 1980s ended with many changes to the station; during this time, Kerry Peace left to become a record rep for blues label Alligator. In March 1990, KFMH began transmitting from its current 1,000 foot tower in Wilton, Iowa with 100,000 watts.\n\nIn 1993, KFMH moved to Davenport, where continued its alternative format for a year. It signed off at 3 p.m. on March 1, 1994 with the song \"Your Move...I've Seen All Good People\" by Yes, the song it signed on with on June 4, 1973. On the night it signed off, about 500 showed up outside the station to protest, but the station was locked up.\n\nMercury Broadcasting's WKBF inquired about moving the format to its frequency at 1270 AM, but the proposal never materialized.\n\nIn 2013, 19 years to the hour KFMH went off the air, \"99 Plus KFMH\" returned as an internet only station, with the original deejays Captain Steve, Tom Maicke, Jim Hunter, Roberto, and Mary of the Heartland. New deejays include Tommy Lang, Bill Klutho, and Patrick O'Leary. You can listen once again to Rock, Blues, Jazz, Reggae, and Alternative 24/7. 99pluskfmh.com is available on the TuneIn app, Simple Radio by Streema, and Sonos.\n\nOn March 16, 1994, the 99.7 MHz frequency was sold to New York-based Connoisseur Communications, which changed the call letters to KBOB and its format to country (as a competitor to the Quad Cities-market's WLLR-FM). These changes outraged many loyal KFMH listeners, who feared there would no longer be a radio outlet for \"alternative\" music (in lieu of stations programmed by consultants); speculation that the format would move to 1270 AM never materialized. More than a decade after KFMH's demise, some fans still sorely miss the station's eclectic blend of music and programming. Steve Bridges eventually moved to Iowa City where he purchased KCJJ, a 10,000 watt station with a talk-music hybrid that reaches much of eastern Iowa; like KFMH, \"The Mighty 1630\" does at times push the envelope.\n\nKBOB, meanwhile, debuted to promising ratings. Part of what set the new station apart was inclusion of songs WLLR had since removed from its playlist. However, KBOB — which later was sold to Cumulus Media — soon languished behind the powerhouse stations in the Quad Cities market, especially WLLR, despite having the advantage of broadcasting at 100 kW; until March 1998, WLLR broadcast on a frequency whose power was 50 kW.\n\nOn April 5, 2000, KBOB switched to 104.9 MHz, usurping that frequency's adult contemporary format. 99.7 MHz then adopted its current Top 40 format and \"B100\" branding; Robb Rose was the first program director. The station's first line-up included Rose and Julia Bradley in the morning, Jeff James in middays, Steve Fuller in the afternoon drive-time, Brandon Marshall in the evening and Rachel in overnights.\n\nThe station quickly gained a following, cutting into the ratings of the Quad-Cities market's dominant Top 40 station, \"All-Hit 98.9\" (WHTS-FM). In early 2006, WHTS was sold to the Educational Media Foundation, and along with new call letters, that station's format was changed to contemporary Christian, leaving \"B100\" as the only Top 40 station in the Quad Cities for the next six years. However, on February 20, 2012, Clear Channel launched a CHR format on KUUL-FM as \"101.3 KISS FM.\"\n\nOn August 30, 2013, a deal was announced in which Townsquare Media would acquire 53 Cumulus stations, including KBEA-FM, for $238 million. The deal is part of Cumulus' acquisition of Dial Global; Townsquare and Dial Global are both controlled by Oaktree Capital Management. The sale to Townsquare was completed on November 14, 2013.\n\n"}

A Hobson's choice is an apparently free choice that is really no choice at all. In this book it is a play on the main character's name and describes the choice between immortality and provable life after death.\n\nDr. Peter Hobson invents a machine that detects a brain pattern that leaves the body after death, a pattern many believe is a soul.

But all three simulations – two modified, one a 'control' – escape Sarkar's computer, into the Internet and the World Wide Web.\n\n\nThe novel takes place in Toronto, briefly in 1995 and chiefly in 2011. Dr. Peter Hobson, a biomedical engineer, has invented many devices in the field of home automation. He has always been haunted by memories of monitoring an EKG during the dissection of a \"corpse\" for organ donation when he was in graduate school; the donor's heart was still beating and the body exhibited signs of anesthesia awareness.

A psychotherapist helps her to understand that she has low self-esteem because of emotional neglect by her critical father Rod. Peter throws himself into his work. This is the emotional set-up that drives events in the following five months.\n\nTo his shock, when Peter places his superEEG on the head of a willing terminal patient, he afterwards finds in the readouts a small electrical field leaving the brain after death. He shares this discovery with his friend Sarkar Muhammed, who runs his own startup firm doing expert system design. Sarkar declares it a soul, which Peter, a skeptic, is reluctant to believe. To maintain precise scientific language, they call it a soulwave: \"The soulwave had a distinctive electrical signature. The frequency was very high, well above that of normal electrochemical brain activity, so, even though the voltage was minuscule, it wasn't washed out in the mass of other signals within the brain.\"\n\nPeter experiments with more terminal patients to verify his finding; he tests pregnant women to discover when the fetus gains a soulwave (at about ten weeks); and he finds that, among animals, at least chimpanzees also have souls.\n\nWhen Peter holds a press conference to announce his breakthrough, human society around the world undergoes a revolution. He is repeatedly asked what life after death is like, though he has no idea.\n\nIn order to learn about immortality and life after death, Peter and Sarkar create three electronic simulations of Peter's own personality after a comprehensive scan of his mind and memories. From one, they seek \"which neural nets are activated exclusively by biological concerns, and then zero those out\" (p. 131), so that it is purely intellect; they call it Spirit. From the second, they edit all fears of aging and death, so that it \"feels\" itself to be immortal; they call this one Ambrotos. The third is a control, with Peter's knowledge up to the point of the brain scan. At first, the three \"sims\" enjoy exploring all that the Internet has to offer. One sim, however, hires a hit man to kill Hans and then, days later, Cathy's father.\n\nDetective Sandra Philo takes the case and, questioning Cathy and her co-workers, realizes at once that Cathy is concealing her relationship with Hans. She also knows Peter is rich enough to afford hiring a professional hit. What she doesn't realize is that the guilty sim is prepared to have her killed, too. Peter and Sarkar race to find a way to \"pull the plug\" on the sims before Philo and perhaps others die.\n\nBesides winning the Nebula Award, \"The Terminal Experiment\" won the Prix Aurora Award for Best Long Form in English of 1995. It also earned one of the nine HOMer Awards that Sawyer has won. The novel was a Preliminary Nominee for the Bram Stoker Award, for Superior Achievement in a Novel, and was nominated for the \"Science Fiction Chronicle\" Award.\n\nBrian Stableford wrote in an overview: \"Sawyer's work became conspicuously more ambitious in the late 1990s. \"The Terminal Experiment\" (1995) has a murder mystery subplot, but foregrounds an enquiry into the roots of ethical philosophy, employing three artificial 'clones' of its protagonist's personality as subjects in an elaborate thought experiment.\"\n\nSteven H Silver wrote, \"Sawyer is writing a mystery with this book, and, to a certain extent, succeeds. The pace is good, keeping you turning the pages, and the characters are likeable, even the libidinous Hans and the un-enlightened Rod. However, because of the way Sawyer creates his mystery, there is no real chance of figuring out who is responsible.\"\n\n"}

The National Joint Action Committee (NJAC) was formed out of the Guild of Undergraduates at the St. Augustine campus of the University of the West Indies (UWI). Under the leadership of Geddes Granger (later Makandal Daaga), NJAC and the Black Power movement appeared as a serious challenge to the authority of Prime Minister Eric Williams.\n\nThis was coupled with a growing militancy by the trade union movement, led by George Weekes of the Oilfields Workers' Trade Union, Clive Nunez of the Transport and Industrial Workers Union and Basdeo Panday, then a young trade union lawyer and activist. The Black Power Revolution began with a 1970 Carnival band named Pinetoppers whose presentation entitled \"The Truth about Africa\" included portrayals of \"revolutionary heroes\" including Fidel Castro, Kwame Ture and Tubal Uriah Butler.\n\nThis was followed by a series of marches and protests. Williams countered with a broadcast entitled \"I am for Black Power\". He introduced a 5% levy to fund unemployment reduction and later established the first locally owned commercial bank. However, this intervention had little impact on the protests,\n\nIt was mainly led by NJAC's duo of Makandal Daaga and Khafra Khambon in tandem with other various interests within the trade unions, and other social groups like Afro-Trinidadians and were noted to attract many disaffected members of the then ruling People's National Movement (PNM) under Eric Williams.\nA large turnout of the disaffected poor of the cities and towns, as well as those black youth of the disaffected communities were attracted to the uprising and were present in the movement, as well as youths and others from the St. Augustine campus of UWI.\n\nOn 6 April 1970 a protester, Basil Davis, was killed by the police. This was followed on 13 April by the resignation of A. N. R. Robinson, Member of Parliament for Tobago East. The death of this protester led to the Movement to pick up momentum. On 18 April sugar workers went on strike, and there was talk of a general strike. In response to this, Williams proclaimed a State of Emergency on 21 April and arrested 15 Black Power leaders. Responding in turn, a portion of the Trinidad Defense Force, led by Raffique Shah and Rex Lassalle, mutinied and took hostages at the army barracks at Teteron. Through the action of the Coast Guard, led by Commander David Bloom and negotiations between the Government and the rebels, the mutiny was contained and the mutineers surrendered on 25 April.\n\nWilliams made three additional speeches in which he sought to identify himself with the aims of the Black Power movement. He re-shuffled his Cabinet and removed three Ministers (including two white members) and three senators. He also introduced the \"Public Order Act\", which reduced civil liberties in an effort to control protest marches. After public opposition, led by A. N. R. Robinson and his newly created \"Action Committee of Democratic Citizens\" (which later became the Democratic Action Congress), the bill was withdrawn. Attorney General Karl Hudson-Phillips offered to resign over the failure of the bill, but Williams refused his resignation.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1874319", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1874319", "title": "North Union Railway", "text": "North Union Railway\n\nThe North Union Railway was an early British railway company, operating in Lancashire. It was created in 1834, continuing independently until 1889.\n\nThe North Union Railway (NUR) was created by an Act of Parliament on 22 May 1834 which authorised its founding as the first-ever railway amalgamation. The two companies amalgamated were the Wigan Branch Railway and the Preston and Wigan Railway. The Preston and Wigan Railway had the Act authorising it to construct the railway in place but was underfunded and sought the amalgamation to help gets its railway under way. The first chairman of the company was Sir Thomas Dalrymple Hesketh, Bart. He had previously held the same position at the Preston and Wigan Railway.\n\nWhen it was created, the North Union Railway consisted of the line constructed by the Wigan Branch Railway(WBR) but little else. All its locomotives and rolling stock were supplied by the Liverpool and Manchester Railway.\n\nWithin a month the railway appointed Charles Vignoles as engineer on the railway at a salary of £1,200 (equivalent to £ in ).\n\nWork was started on the construction of the Wigan to Preston section of the railway. As Preston stands upon a ridge rising sharply from the north bank of the River Ribble reaching it involved some engineering, the North Union reached its terminus by descending gradients as steep as 1 in 100 to the valley, crossing the river and cutting into the rising ground as far as Fishergate. The river bridge was of five arches, each spanning 120 ft. The line was completed in 1838 and a trial run was held on 22 October with a train running from Wigan to Preston, and the line opened to the public on 31 October 1838.\n\nThe colliery line known as Springs Branch that had been authorised at the same time as WBR was opened on the same day, 31 October 1838.\n\nIn 1846, in conjunction with the Ribble Navigation Company, the North Union obtained powers to build a branch to Victoria Quay on the River Ribble. This line was built to convey coal from the Wigan district to the river for shipment.\n\nThe L&NWR continued to improve the route and in 1864 installed the Winwick cut-off between Golborne junction and Winwick junction (on the former Warrington and Newton Railway) which provided a route for trains to avoid Lowton, Parkside and Earlestown junctions.\n\nThe NUR opened the Wigan to Preston section with the following stations:\n\nThe North Union Railway was concerned to protect its interests and had many disagreements with rival railways and canals.\nThe North Union Railway opposed the proposed Bolton and Preston Railway (B&PR), whose original Act of 15 July 1837 made for an independent route through to Preston. A further Act of 4 July 1838 was enacted withdrawing the B&PRs powers to build beyond Chorley and instead authorised an extension to join the North Union Railway's line at Euxton, north of Chorley.\n\nThe Bolton & Preston Act was passed with the proviso that the line north of Chorley should be delayed for three years so that a compromise could be reached between the two companies about running trains into Preston. \n\nThere was immediate competition between the two companies for the Manchester to Preston traffic and they tried to undercut each other's fares. The North Union managed to maintain the upper hand in the competition as they were able to extract tolls from its rival for running trains along its Euxton to Preston stretch. \n\nThe rivalry was short-lived as the Bolton & Preston Railway was acquired by the North Union Railway by an Act of 10 May 1844. \n\nIn 1834 the Wigan Branch Railway had offered John Hargreaves, an established carrier in the North West, the lease for operating the goods service on their line. Hargreaves, in partnership with his son (also called John Hargreaves) declined the offer and made a counter offer which was accepted by the new North Union Railway, as this was now after the merger of the railways. The son, John Hargreaves junior therefore became the sole lessee over the Wigan section for goods traffic with the exception of those who already had the right to operate their own trains, mainly coal mine owners. The L&MR continued to provide all the passenger services for the line.\n\nWhen the first section of the Bolton to Preston line opened on 4 Feb 1841 it met the Manchester, Bolton and Bury Railway (MB&BR) coming up from Salford which had opened on 29 May 1838. This railway was built by the Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal Navigation and Railway Company who had in 1831 converted from a canal company. Their railway terminated at Bolton Trinity Street station and part of the enabling Act for the Preston to Bolton section made provision for the station to be converted to a through station to allow for traffic to Preston.\n\nIn the same way as the L&MR provided operational services to the WBR and NUR over the Parkside to Wigan section, so the MB&BR provided operational services to the NUR over the Bolton to Preston Section.\n\nIn 1846 arrangements were being made for the line to be leased jointly to the Grand Junction Railway (GJR) and the Manchester and Leeds Railway (M&LR) but before this happened the GJR became part of the London and North Western Railway (L&NWR), the arrangement continued however with the L&NWR and the M&LR jointly leasing the NUR.\n\nOn 9 July 1847 the Manchester & Leeds Railway changed its title to the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (L&Y) but the leasing arrangement continued. The NUR continued independently under this leasing arrangement with the L&NWR owning and the L&YR . This was the situation until 26 July 1889 when it was jointly absorbed by the L&NWR and L&YR.\n\nThe NUR was absorbed by the two larger companies by the simple expedient of the section from Euxton to Bolton (the former B&PR) being taken by the L&YR and the section from Parkside to Euxton going to the L&NWR.\n\nOn 28 June 1847, the boiler of a locomotive exploded, injuring one person.\n\nTo cope with ever-increasing traffic, the line was quadrupled between 1889 and 1891.\n\nThe stretch between Euxton Junction and Preston, which included the major part of Preston station, remained in joint ownership up to 1921 when the L&YR was absorbed by the L&NWR so from that date the former North Union Railway had only one owner. This section of the West Coast Main Line between London Euston and Carlisle had been the only part not wholly owned by the L&NWR.\n\nBalshaw Lane and Euxton station was opened by the L&NWR on 2 September 1905, it closed on 6 October 1969. Services restarted from this station now named Euxton Balshaw Lane on 15 December 1997.\n\n\n"}

Amado Carrillo became known as \"\"El Señor de Los Cielos\"\" (\"The Lord of the Skies\"), because of the large fleet of jets he used to transport drugs. He was also known for laundering money via Colombia, to finance this fleet.\n\nHe died in July 1997, in a Mexican hospital, after undergoing extensive plastic surgery to change his appearance. In his final days, Carrillo was being tracked by Mexican and U.S. authorities.\n\nCarrillo was born to Walter Vicente Carrillo Vega and Aurora Fuentes in Guamuchilito, Navolato, Sinaloa, Mexico. He had eleven siblings.\n\nCarillo was the nephew of Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo, also known as \"Don Neto\", the Guadalajara Cartel leader. Amado got his start in the drug business under the tutelage of his uncle Ernesto and later brought in his brothers, and eventually his son Vicente José Carrillo Leyva.\n\nCarrillo's father died in April 1986. Carillo's brother, Cipriano Carrillo Fuentes, died in 1989 under mysterious circumstances.\n\nInitially, Carrillo was part of the Guadalajara Cartel, sent to Ojinaga, Chihuahua to oversee the cocaine shipments of his uncle, Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo (\"Don Neto\"), and to learn about border operations from Pablo Acosta Villarreal (\"El Zorro de Ojinaga\"; \"The Ojinaga Fox\") and Rafael Aguilar Guajardo. Later, Carrillo worked with Pablo Escobar and the Cali Cartel smuggling drugs from Colombia to Mexico and the United States. He also worked with \"El Chapo\" (Joaquin Guzman Loera), the Arellano Felix family, and the Beltran Leyva organization.\n\nDuring his tenure, Carrillo reportedly built a multibillion-dollar drug empire. It was estimated that he may have made over $25 billion in revenue over the course of his career.\n\nThe pressure to capture Carrillo intensified among U.S. and Mexican authorities after people in Morelos state began silent marches against governor Jorge Carrillo Olea and his presumed complacency with drug-related violence. Carrillo Fuentes owned a house three blocks from the governor's official residence and regularly held narco-fiestas in the municipality of Tetecala. Governor Carrillo Olea was forced to resign and was arrested; this type of pressure may have convinced Carrillo Fuentes to undergo facial plastic surgery and abdominal surgery liposuction to change his appearance on July 4, 1997, at Santa Mónica Hospital in Mexico City. However, during the operation, he died of complications apparently caused either by a certain medication or a malfunctioning respirator (there is very little paperwork regarding his death).\n\nTwo of Carrillo Fuente's bodyguards were in the operating room during the procedure. On November 7, 1997, the two physicians who performed Carrillo's surgery were found dead, encased in concrete inside steel drums, with their bodies showing signs of torture.\n\nOn the night of August 3, 1997, at around 9:30 p.m., four drug traffickers walked into a restaurant in Ciudad Juárez, pulled out their guns, and opened fire on five diners, killing them instantly. Police estimated that more than 100 bullet casings were found at the crime scene. According to a report issued by the \"Los Angeles Times\", four men went to the restaurant carrying at least two AK-47 automatic rifles while others stood at the doorstep.\n\nOn their way out, the gunmen claimed another victim: Armando Olague, a prison official and off-duty law enforcement officer, who was gunned down outside the restaurant after he had walked from a nearby bar to investigate the shooting. Reportedly, Olague had run into the restaurant from across the street with a gun in his hand, to check out the commotion. It was later determined that Olague was also a known lieutenant of the Juarez cartel.\n\nMexican authorities declined to comment on the motives behind the killing, stating the shootout was not linked to Carrillo's death. Nonetheless, it was later stated that the perpetrators were gunmen of the Tijuana Cartel.\n\nAlthough confrontations between \"narcotraficantes\" were commonplace in Ciudad Juárez, they rarely occurred in public places. What happened in the restaurant threatened to usher in a new era of border crime in the city.\n\nIn Ciudad Juárez, the PGR seized warehouses they believed the cartel used to store weapons and cocaine; they also seized over 60 properties all over Mexico belonging to Carrillo, and began an investigation into his dealings with police and government officials. Officials also froze bank accounts amounting to $10 billion belonging to Carrillo. In April 2009, Mexican authorities arrested Carillo's son, Vicente Carrillo Leyva.\n\nCarrillo was given a large and lavish, expensive funeral in Guamuchilito, Sinaloa. In 2006, Governor Eduardo Bours asked the federal government to tear down Carrillo's mansion in Hermosillo, Sonora.\n\n\n\n"}

He had earlier been working for Bell Labs close to Andrew Koenig and tried to convince Bjarne Stroustrup to introduce something like Ada generics in C++. He is credited with the notion of concept.\n\nHe is the author (with Paul McJones) of Elements of Programming, a book that grew out of a \"Foundations of Programming\" course that Stepanov taught at Adobe Systems (while employed there). He is also the author (with Daniel E. Rose) of From Mathematics to Generic Programming.\n\nHe retired in January 2016 from A9.com.\n\nAlexander Stepanov is an advocate of generic programming. Although David Musser had already developed and advocated some aspects of generic programming by 1971, it was limited to a rather specialized area of software development (computer algebra).\n\nStepanov recognized the full potential for generic programming and persuaded his then-colleagues at General Electric Research and Development (including, primarily, David Musser and Deepak Kapur) that generic programming should be pursued as a comprehensive basis for software development. At the time there was no real support in any programming language for generic programming.\n\nThe first major language to provide such support was Ada, with its generic units feature. By 1987 Stepanov and Musser had developed and published an Ada library for list processing that embodied the results of much of their research on generic programming. However, Ada had not achieved much acceptance outside the defense industry and C++ seemed more likely to become widely used and provide good support for generic programming even though the language was relatively immature. Another reason for turning to C++, which Stepanov recognized early on, was that the C/C++ model of computation (which allows very flexible access to storage via pointers) is crucial to achieving generality without losing efficiency.\nIt eventually led to the development of the Standard Template Library of C++.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1874375", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1874375", "title": "Decommodification", "text": "Decommodification\n\nIn political economics, decommodification is the strength of social entitlements and citizens' degree of immunization from market dependency.\n\nIn regards to the labor force, decommodification describes a \"degree to which individual, or families, can uphold a socially acceptable standard of living independently of market participation.\"\n\nWhile commodification is the transformation of goods, services, ideas and people into commodities or objects of trade, decommodification would be the \"extent that workers can leave the labor market through choice.\"\n\nThe idea of decommodification as an egalitarian concept as set forth by Esping Andersen sparked contemporary research efforts focusing on perceived inequities. In 2008, a research journal pointed out a feminist critique that \"the absolute focus on\nthe welfare of individuals who are already working\" leaves a central bias in the pursuit of decommodification. Rather, the objective of women is often to be commodified in the first place so that they can enter the labor market.\n\nDecommodification has been identified by ecological economists as a strategy for sustainable consumption that acts one level up on the institutional context of consumption in Western societies as compared to strategies such as eco-efficiency and eco-sufficiency. Thus, while the eco-efficiency strategy targets the product and the eco-sufficiency strategy targets the person (the consumer as decision-maker), the decommodification strategy targets the institutional context in which consumption takes place. It aims to decrease the influence of commodities and to limit the effect of commercialization.\n\nEsping-Andersen's fundamental study of decommodification sparked contemporary academic research efforts hoping to resolve \"paradoxes\" in this application. Exiting the labor market with little or no loss of income clashed with the idea that social democracy has the goal of high labor force participation. Research efforts to resolve this paradox showed that \"employment impeding policies\" came out of Christian democracy institutions, not social democracy institutions. This research suggests that decommodification in the social democratic model is viable.\n\nScandinavian countries are the closest to decommodification according to the scale created by Esping Andersen's research which places Sweden as the most decommodified country in the 1980s. Sweden's level of pensions, sickness entitlements and unemployment insurance are the highest among many other leading industrial countries. Sweden's social welfare programs are mandated by the government which also offers a \"de facto\" guarantee to the wages of citizens' rather than taking averages and creating regulations through a means-based test on citizens' wages, level of education and their past history with the law.\n"}

He played college football at Fresno State, and was drafted by the New England Patriots in the first round of the 2005 NFL Draft. Mankins also played for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\nMankins is from Catheys Valley, California. He attended Mariposa High School in Mariposa, California, where he was an All-League performer and the team MVP.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, he attended California State University, Fresno, where he played for the Fresno State Bulldogs football team. He redshirted in his first season in 2000. As a freshman in 2001, he started all 14 games at left tackle, blocking for quarterback David Carr and allowing only two sacks. He was named to the first team Freshman All-American team by the \"Sporting News\". In 2002, he again started all 14 games and was on the Outland Trophy watch list. As a junior in 2003, Mankins tore his ACL in preseason practices after a vicious hit from Juan Carrasquillo and missed the season. In his final season in 2004, Mankins returned to start every game at left tackle and did not allow a sack or pressure on the season. He was a first team All-Western Athletic Conference selection and recorded a school record 82 knockdown blocks on the season. He also was the first offensive lineman in school history to win the team's MVP award. \nDuring his high school and college career he was told by Christopher Hayes he was not big enough. He proved him wrong and made the NFL.\n\nMankins was drafted with the final pick of the first round, 32nd overall, in the 2005 NFL Draft by the New England Patriots. Despite playing his entire collegiate career as a tackle, Mankins was moved to left guard by the Patriots, where he immediately stepped into the starting lineup in place of Joe Andruzzi, who departed in free agency. Mankins started all 16 games for the Patriots in 2005. In an October 16 loss to the Denver Broncos, Mankins was ejected after striking Broncos defensive lineman Ebenezer Ekuban below the belt after a missed field goal. He would go on to be named to Pro Football Weekly's 2005 All-Rookie team.\n\nIn 2006, Mankins again started all 16 games for the Patriots. He scored his first NFL touchdown in the AFC Championship Game against the Indianapolis Colts when he recovered a Laurence Maroney fumble in the end zone. (Later in that same game, Colts center Jeff Saturday also recovered a fumble for a touchdown, making that game the first playoff game in NFL history in which two offensive linemen scored touchdowns).\n\n2007 saw Mankins start all 16 games, allowing only one sack. Due to his performance, Mankins was named as a starting guard in the 2008 Pro Bowl and a second team All-Pro selection.\n\nFor the fourth straight season, Mankins started all 16 games at left guard for the Patriots in 2008. After the loss of starting quarterback Tom Brady, Mankins helped the team's running backs to compile a total of 2,278 yards, a team's best since 1985.\n\nMankins was named to the Patriots' 50th anniversary team in August 2009. He continued with his streak of consecutive starts, playing in every game for the Patriots again and protecting Brady to just 16 sacks (a career best). At the end of the 2009 season, Mankins was selected as a starter to his second Pro Bowl and became just the second guard, after John Hannah, in Patriots history to do so.\n\nFollowing the 2009 season, Mankins became a restricted free agent under the terms of the NFL-NFLPA collective bargaining agreement, which entered its final, uncapped year; Mankins otherwise would have been an unrestricted free agent in a normal season. The Patriots tendered at the highest possible level for a restricted free agent, $3.26 million, which have required any team signing Mankins in the restricted free agent signing period, which ended on April 15, 2010, to surrender first- and third-round draft selections to the Patriots. On June 15, with Mankins yet to sign his tender, the Patriots were able to lower Mankins' tender amount to 110% of his prior year salary, or $1.54 million. The Patriots did so, and Mankins, who was looking for a long-term contract, reacted by publicly asking for a trade.\n\nHe did not attend the Patriots' mandatory June minicamp, which he was not required to attend as he was not under contract at the time. Mankins remained unsigned through the team's training camp, preseason, and the start of the regular season. Mankins reported to the Patriots and signed his tender on November 2, in advance of the team's Week 9 game against the Cleveland Browns. He did not have to report until Week 12 in order to be on the roster for the necessary six games to earn his sixth accrued season of free agency credit. The NFL granted the Patriots a two-game roster exemption for Mankins upon his reporting. However, the Patriots activated Mankins on November 6, before using either game of the exemption.\n\nMankins started the final nine games of the season for the Patriots. For the second straight season, Mankins was elected as a starter to the Pro Bowl.\n\nOn February 14, 2011, the Patriots assigned Mankins the franchise tag.\n\nLate in negotiations to complete a new NFL/NFLPA Collective Bargaining Agreement came reports that Mankins and several other players were demanding $10 million apiece or immediate granting of free agency status before they would sign off on settlement of a lawsuit against the NFL as part of a new CBA. It was not the first time, as in the previous CBA agreement Reggie White was exempt and was able to join free agency as part of the agreement.\n\nOn July 26, 2011, it was announced that Mankins would sign his franchise tender, worth just over $10 million, for the 2011-2012 season, and report to Patriots training camp on time. He reported on July 27.\n\nOn August 10, 2011, Mankins signed a 6-year deal, which at the time made him the highest paid guard in the league.\n\nDuring the first Patriots game of the 2011 season, Mankins tore the ACL in his right knee. Despite this he continued the season, starting a total of 15 games in the 2011 season. He is one of the only players known to have played a season with a torn ACL and reportedly kept the injury to himself, not reporting it. He only became aware of how serious the injury was after he tore the MCL in his left knee, during the divisional round playoff game vs the Denver Broncos. Despite both ACL and MCL tears in separate knees Mankins still went on to play in Super Bowl XLVI vs the New York Giants.\n\nIn 2013, Mankins was fined $10,000 for clipping as he blocked Pittsburgh Steeler nose tackle Steve McLendon.

The mission was located at . San Francisco Javier mission was founded by Jesuits of the Roman Catholic church in 1699 and closed in 1817. The missionary's objective was to convert the local Cochimí Native Americans (Indians) to Christianity. A mission church survives and is in use. \n\nThe Jesuits established Misión de Nuestra Señora de Loreto Conchó in 1697 in Loreto, but it quickly became obvious that the Loreto site had too little water to be suitable for agriculture and, thus, could not become self-sustaining. The Jesuits were told by Cochimi visitors to Loreto of potential agricultural land across the nearby Sierra de la Giganta. In May 1699 Francisco Maria Piccolo, along with a dozen Cochimí guides and ten Spanish soldiers, crossed the mountains on horseback and entered the valley the Indians called Biaundó, about inland from the Gulf of California. (The other part of the mission's name, Viggé, was the Cochimí word for \"mountain.\") The inhabitants of a Cochimí rancheria at the site were friendly and Piccolo baptized 30 of their children. \n\nIn October 1699, Piccolo returned with a contingent of Spanish soldiers and Indian converts and began to construct the mission. Piccolo dedicated the mission on December 3, 1699, and San Francisco Javier (also Xavier) became the second most enduring mission established in Baja California.The mission was abandoned in 1701 because of a threatened Indian revolt, but reestablished by Juan de Ugarte in 1702. However, efforts to grow crops proved unsuccessful due to lack of water for irrigation and in 1710 the mission was moved a few kilometers south to its present location which had a dependable source of water from a spring. The energetic Ugarte constructed dams, aqueducts, and stone buildings. Between 1744 and 1758, Miguel del Barco was responsible for building what has been called \"the jewel of the Baja California mission churches.\"\n\nThe Cochimí were nomadic and semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who dwelt in the austere deserts and mountains of the central portion of the Baja California peninsula. The Cochimí were considered by the Jesuits to be less warlike and more accepting of missions and missionaries than their southern neighbors, the Guaycura and Pericues.\n\nFood given out by the Jesuits initially drew the Cochimí to the mission, but over the longer term, the missionaries attempted to make the Cochimí sedentary farmers and herders of domestic animals. However, the concentration of the population at the mission facilitated the spread of European diseases, such as smallpox and measles. The ravages of disease caused the native population to decline steadily in the 18th century. The mission had a population of 482 in 1768, but the numbers declined to 83 in 1808. In the 19th century, the Cochimí became extinct as a culture and identifiable people.\n\nBy 1817, the mission was deserted. The church has been restored and is now maintained by Mexico's National Institute of Anthropology and History. The village of San Javier at the site of the former mission had a population of 131 in 2010. Several introduced plant species continue to exist or to be grown at the mission: date palms, grapes, citrus, and, notably, ancient olive trees.\n\n\n\n"}

(pronounced \"lazy boy\") is an American furniture manufacturer based in Monroe, Michigan, USA, that makes home furniture, including upholstered recliners, sofas, stationary chairs, lift chairs and sleeper sofas. The company employed around 8900 people in 2017.\n\nLa-Z-Boy furniture is sold in thousands of retail residential outlets in the United States and Canada and is manufactured and distributed under license in other countries including the United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Turkey and South Africa. La-Z-Boy holds US and international patents on more than 200 different styles and mechanisms.\n\nLa-Z-Boy Incorporated is divided into three reportable operating segments: the Upholstery Group, the Casegoods Group and the Retail Group. The Upholstery Group primarily manufactures and sells upholstered furniture to furniture retailers and proprietary stores. This includes recliners and motion furniture, sofas, lift chairs, loveseats, chairs, ottomans and sleeper sofas. The Casegoods Group primarily sells manufactured or imported wood furniture to furniture retailers, including tables, chairs, entertainment centers, headboards, dressers, accent pieces and some coordinated upholstered furniture. The Retail Group consists of approximately 150 company-owned stores in the US. The Retail Group sells upholstered furniture and casegoods to end consumers through the retail network.\n\nLa-Z-Boy includes various companies and brands including La-Z-Boy Residential, La-Z-Boy Kids, La-Z-Boy Hospitality, Lea Furniture, American Drew, Kincaid Furniture, Bauhaus USA Furniture, Hammary Furniture and England Furniture Incorporated. In July 2018 it was announced that La-Z-Boy was acquiring online furniture company Joybird for an undisclosed amount.\n\nIn 1927, cousins Edward M. Knabusch and Edwin J. Shoemaker partnered and invested in the furniture business in the town of Monroe, Michigan. They set out to design a chair for what they called \"nature’s way of relaxing.\" Using orange crates to mock-up and refine their idea, they invented a wood-slat porch chair with a reclining mechanism. Knabusch and Shoemaker then upholstered their innovation and marketed it as a year-round chair. The chair was a success; they held a contest to name it—La-Z-Boy was the winner.\n\nIn 1969, after years primarily as a manufacturer of recliners, La-Z-Boy started designing other products including reclining sofas, sleep sofas and modular groups. Its 1981 sales were $150 million. In 1983, La-Z-Boy introduced its first line of stationary sofas and occasional chairs, later offering a full line of home furnishings.\n\nRichard R. Allen, Don A. Hunziker and William O. Fenn borrowed $70 million to buy Lea, American Drew and Daystrom from Sperry & Hutchinson in 1981. LADD, whose name came from the three companies, began trading publicly in 1982. LADD was the third-largest American maker of furniture for homes, with over $600 million in sales, when it bought six Maytag businesses in 1990. LADD Industries moved from High Point, North Carolina to Grandover in Greensboro, North Carolina in November 1997, becoming the first company to locate its headquarters there. At the time it was the fifth-largest American furniture maker, with $500 million in sales, and the brands American Drew, American of Martinsville, Barclay, Clayton Marcus, Lea, Pennsylvania House and Pilliod. In September 1999, La-Z-Boy, at the time the largest American upholstered furniture manufacturer, bought LADD, the seventh-largest American furniture maker, for $197.8 million in stock and $101.5 million in assumed debt. Saul Cutler of BDO Seidman said the deal \"sets up La-Z-Boy as an industry behemoth.\" The deal, approved in January 2000, gave La-Z-Boy $2 billion in sales and made it one of the country's two largest furniture makers, Furniture Brands International being the other.\n\nOn July 23, 2001, La-Z-Boy announced the LADD name would cease to exist. John J. Case, president of La-Z-Boy Residential, moved to head the new La-Z-Boy upholstery group, which included Bauhaus, Centurion, Clayton Marcus, England, HickoryMark, La-Z-Boy, Sam Moore and La-Z-Boy Contract Furniture. Don L. Mitchell, who headed the LADD casegoods group, would take the same job at the La-Z-Boy casegoods group, including Alexvale, American Drew, Hammary, Kincaid, Lea, Pennsylvania House, Pilliod and American of Martinsville.\n\nCompetition from China hurt many American furniture makers, and particularly La-Z-Boy's strategy of buying LADD to improve its casegoods position. In 2005, La-Z-Boy chairman Pat Norton called the LADD deal \"the biggest mistake that I have ever made in the furniture industry.\" Pilliod was the first LADD division sold, to Michels & Co. in December 2001. Barclay was closed. American of Martinsville was sold to Hancock Park Associates in November 2006. Sixteen of the former LADD plants had been sold or closed. On September 6, 2007, La-Z-Boy announced the sale of Pennsylvania House to Universal Furniture. Later that month came the sale of Clayton Marcus to Sun Capital affiliate Lexington-Rowe, leaving only American Drew and Lea among the LADD divisions. Also sold was the Sam Moore division, in February 2007 to Hooker Furniture. La-Z-Boy was still number three, with $1.5 billion in shipments.\n\nIn November 2006, High Point offered $600,000 to the La-Z-Boy division that was formerly LADD to move its headquarters back.\n\nLate in 2006, La-Z-Boy had 7000 employees, down from 13,000 six years earlier. The company began working on its image, telling consumers the company offered more than recliners. The company reduced its warehouses from twelve to five and announced plans to add 50 New Generation stores to the 334 the company already had; half of those used the new format already.\n\nLate in 2014, La-Z-Boy announced the closing of Lea after an unsuccessful attempt to find someone to buy the company. The High Point office would continue operations for American Drew, Hammary, and Kincaid.\n\nIn 1970, Morgan Furniture of Takapuna, New Zealand, founded by Jack Morgan, commenced manufacture of the La-Z-Boy recliner for Australia and New Zealand. In September 2007 his son Graham Morgan announced that the company was to import the furniture from China and Thailand with the loss of around 200 Auckland manufacturing jobs.\n\n"}

Although little-known today, Cooper was also the highest-ranking Confederate general during the American Civil War. After the conflict, he remained in Virginia as a farmer.\n\nSamuel Cooper was born in New Hackensack, Dutchess County, New York. He was a son of Samuel Cooper and his wife Mary Horton. In 1813 he entered the United States Military Academy at age 15 and graduated 36th in a class of 40 two years later (the customary length of study in that period.) He was appointed a brevet second lieutenant in the U.S. Light Artillery on December 11, 1815. He was promoted to first lieutenant in 1821 and to captain in 1836.\n\nIn 1827, Cooper married Sarah Maria Mason, becoming the brother-in-law of future Confederate diplomat James M. Mason and later the father-in-law of Union General Frank Wheaton. Sarah's sister, Ann Maria Mason, was the mother of Confederate cavalry general Fitzhugh Lee, a nephew of Robert E. Lee, while her brother John Mason, was a son-in-law of Gen. Alexander Macomb. Cooper served as aide-de-camp for Gen. Macomb from 1828 to 1836 and under his supervision authored \"A Concise System of Instructions and Regulations for the Militia and Volunteers of the United States\".\n\nCooper served in numerous artillery units until 1837, when he was appointed chief clerk of the U.S. War Department. In 1838 he received a brevet promotion to major and was appointed assistant adjutant general of the Army. Nine years later, with a brevet as lieutenant colonel, he served in the same capacity.\n\nCooper's service in the Second Seminole War of 1841–42 was a rare departure for him from Washington, D.C. He was chief of staff for Col. William J. Worth, and after hostilities ended he returned to staff duty in Washington from 1842 to 1845. Cooper received a brevet promotion to colonel on May 30, 1848, for his War Department service in the Mexican–American War, and was promoted to the permanent rank of colonel in the regular army and appointed the army's Adjutant General on July 15, 1852. Cooper also served very briefly as acting U.S. Secretary of War in 1857.\n\nCooper was also a slave owner. At the time of the 1850 census, he owned six slaves.\n\nAt the beginning of the Civil War, Cooper's loyalties were with the South. His wife's family was from Virginia, and he had a close friendship with Jefferson Davis, who had also been U.S. Secretary of War. One of his last official acts as Adjutant General of the U.S. Army was to sign an order dismissing Brig. Gen. David E. Twiggs from the army. Twiggs had surrendered his command and supplies in Texas to the Confederacy (and was shortly thereafter made a Confederate major general.) This order was dated March 1, 1861, and Cooper resigned six days later. He traveled to Montgomery, Alabama, at the time the Confederacy's capital, to join the Confederate States Army.\n\nOn reaching Montgomery, Cooper was immediately given a commission as a brigadier general on March 16, 1861. He served as both Adjutant General and Inspector General of the Confederate Army, a post he held until the end of the war. Cooper provided much-needed organization and knowledge to the fledgling Confederate War Department, drawing on his years performing such duties as Adjutant General of the U.S. Army.\n\nOn May 16, 1861, Cooper was promoted to full general in the Confederate Army. He was one of five men promoted to the grade at that time, and one of only seven during the war, but with the earliest date of rank. Thus, despite his relative obscurity today, he outranked such luminaries as Albert Sidney Johnston, Robert E. Lee, Joseph E. Johnston, and P. G. T. Beauregard. Cooper reported directly to Confederate President Jefferson Davis. At the war's end in 1865, Cooper surrendered and was paroled on May 3 at Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nWhile building defenses near Washington, D.C., Union forces demolished his home and used its bricks to build a fort dubbed \"Traitor's Hill\" in Cooper's honor.\n\nCooper's last official act in office was to preserve the official records of the Confederate Army and turn them over intact to the United States government, where they form a part of the \"Official Records\", \"The War of the Rebellion: a Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies\", published starting in 1880. Military historians have highly regarded Cooper for this action. Historian Ezra J. Warner believed that in doing so Cooper was \"thereby making a priceless contribution to the history of the period.\"\n\nAfter the war, Cooper was a farmer at his home, Cameron, near Alexandria, Virginia. His house had been taken over by the U.S. government during the war and turned into a fort, but he was able to move into what had been an overseer's house. Due to his age Cooper earned a meager living. On August 4, 1870, Robert E. Lee, on the behalf of other former Confederates, sent Cooper $300. Lee wrote to him saying, \"To this sum I have only been able to add $100, but I hope it may enable you to supply some immediate want and prevent you from taxing your strength too much.\" Samuel Cooper died at his home in 1876, and is buried in Alexandria's Christ Church Episcopal Cemetery.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is dark brown or black in color and has a glossy body. The female has a somewhat different appearance from the male, appearing to be wingless at casual glance, but is brachypterous, having non-functional wings just below her head. She has a wider body than the male. The male has long wings, which cover two-thirds of the abdomen and are brown in color, and has a narrower body. Both sexes are flightless. The female oriental cockroach looks somewhat similar to the Florida woods cockroach, and may be mistaken for it. Originally endemic to the Crimean Peninsula and the region around the Black Sea and Caspian Sea, its distribution is now cosmopolitan.\n\nOriental cockroaches tend to travel somewhat more slowly than other species. They are often called \"waterbugs\" since they prefer dark, moist places. They can often be found around decaying organic matter, and in sewers, drains, damp basements, porches, and other damp locations. They can be found outside in bushes, under leaf groundcover, under mulch, and around other damp places outdoors. They are major household pests in parts of the Northwest, Midwest, and Southern United States.\n\nTo thrive, cockroaches need a place to hide. They prefer warm places and a relatively high humidity; they also need a source of food/liquid. The optimum temperature for oriental cockroaches is between . Female oriental cockroaches have vestigial tegmina (reduced fore wings) and males have longer tegmina. Cockroaches are mainly nocturnal. Oriental cockroaches can be elusive in that a casual inspection of an infested dwelling during the day may show no signs of roach activity. Oriental cockroaches can be found in usually damp places such as sewer pipes, sink drains, and any other form of damp areas in households.\n\nSigns of cockroaches are their oothecae, which are “egg cases”. The blackish-brown oothecae of the oriental cockroach are long, with indistinct egg compartments housing 16–18 eggs. These oothecae are formed a day after mating, and typically deposited a day or two after formation, though can be deposited up to 7 days later, typically in a sheltered area or attached to a substrate by oral secretion. They are initially a yellow white, turning reddish- then blackish-brown. They lose viability at temperatures below . They hatch on their own in about 42 days at and 81 days at .\n\nOriental cockroaches can be harder to get rid of than other roaches. Although adults can be fairly easily killed by the application of residual insecticide, the insecticides can get washed away, and two months later females can hatch new nymphs.\n\n"}

He has previously been the head coach of the New York Knicks and the Houston Rockets in the National Basketball Association.\n\nVan Gundy was born in Hemet, California. He grew up in the town of Martinez, California. He is the son of a basketball coach, Bill Van Gundy, the former head coach at Brockport State University and at Genesee Community College. Jeff's elder brother, Stan, later became head coach of the NBA's Miami Heat and Orlando Magic, and is also the former head coach and director of basketball operations for the Detroit Pistons.\n\nAs a high-school point guard, he was a two-time All Greater Rochester selection in 1979 and 1980, leading Brockport Central to the Class AA finals. He continued his basketball playing career at Nazareth College, where he earned All-American honors, while leading the Golden Flyers to an NCAA Division III Tournament berth in 1984. He remains the Nazareth career leader in free throw percentage, at 86.8%.\n\nVan Gundy attended Yale University, where he was a classmate with Jodie Foster, before transferring to Menlo College, and ultimately graduating from New York's Nazareth College, in 1985.\n\nVan Gundy began his basketball coaching career during the 1985–86 season, at McQuaid Jesuit High School, in Rochester, New York. The following year, he became a graduate assistant under head coach Rick Pitino, at Providence College, helping the Providence Friars advance to the Final Four. In his second season with the Friars, he was promoted to assistant coach under Gordon Chiesa. The next season, Van Gundy became an assistant coach under Bob Wenzel, at Rutgers.\n\nOn July 28, 1989, Van Gundy became an assistant coach for the New York Knicks. He spent the next six-and-a-half seasons providing support to Knicks head coaches Stu Jackson (1989–1990), John MacLeod (1990–1991), Pat Riley (1991–1995) and Don Nelson (1995–1996). During his tenure as an assistant coach, the Knicks won three Atlantic Division titles, never finished lower than third in the division, and qualified for the playoffs every year. The Knicks advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals in 1993, and the NBA Finals versus the Houston Rockets in 1994.\n\nOn March 8, 1996, Van Gundy was named head coach of the New York Knicks, taking over the reins from Don Nelson. In his second game as head coach, he notably led the Knicks to a 32–point blowout win over the Michael Jordan–led Chicago Bulls, who had eliminated the Knicks from the playoffs four times since 1989. However, Van Gundy was unable to change that trend in the postseason, as the Knicks fell to Chicago in the conference semifinals.\n\nIn his first full season as head coach, the Knicks tied for the third-best record in franchise history, at 57–25. In the regular season finale, the Knicks defeated the 69–12 Chicago Bulls in Chicago, preventing them from posting two consecutive 70-win seasons in a row, and tying the best home record in NBA history. Van Gundy created a memorable scene in the 1998 NBA Playoffs series between the New York Knicks and the Miami Heat. When the Heat's 6'10\" (2.08 m), 240 lb. (109 kg) center Alonzo Mourning, and the Knicks' 6'7\" (2.01 m), 250 lb. (113 kg) power forward Larry Johnson, engaged in a bench-clearing brawl, Van Gundy unsuccessfully tried to break the fight up. Most memorably, the 5'9\" (1.75 m), 165 lb. (75 kg) Van Gundy fell to the floor, and clung to Mourning's leg. Suspensions were handed down for the brawl, but the Knicks held on to win the series 3-2 and moved on to play the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference semi-finals.\n\nIn the lockout–shortened 1998–99 season, the Knicks struggled with injuries (namely to All–Star Patrick Ewing) and finished 27–23 to finish as the eighth seed for the playoffs (they had to win six of its remaining eight games just to qualify). In the first round of the playoffs, the Knicks defied expectations and defeated the Heat in five games, avenging the previous season's playoff loss and becoming just the second 8th seed to defeat the number one seed in the playoffs. The win propelled an improbable run for the Knicks, as they swept the Hawks in the semifinals, and defeated the Pacers in six games, to advance to the NBA Finals. Without Ewing, they were no match in the Finals against the Spurs, and lost the series in five games. The Knicks were the first 8th-seeded team in NBA history to reach the NBA Finals.\n\nThe Knicks followed up their Finals run with a 50–32 season, and advanced to the Conference Finals, where they were defeated by the Indiana Pacers. Until the 2013 playoffs, this was the last time the Knicks won a playoff series.\n\nIn a 2001 game between the Spurs and Knicks, Danny Ferry elbowed Marcus Camby. While talking to the referee, Camby lost control and tried to punch Ferry. Camby missed and hit Van Gundy instead, who said he learned his lesson about trying to break up fights between players. The Knicks finished 48–34, but lost in the first round to the Raptors.\n\nJust 19 games into the 2001–02 season, Van Gundy resigned from the Knick's head coach position. The move was unexpected, as the Knicks were on a winning streak, and coming off a 14–point victory against the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nOn June 10, 2003, Van Gundy was named head coach of the Houston Rockets, replacing Rudy Tomjanovich. In his first season as the team's head coach, the Rockets finished with a 45–37 record, and qualified for the playoffs for the first time in five years, but they were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nIn his second season with the Rockets, Van Gundy guided the team, led by the Yao Ming/ Tracy McGrady duo, to a 51–31 record, which was their first season with more than 50 wins in eight years. The Rockets once again lost in the first round of the playoffs, this time to the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nMcGrady and Yao missed a combined 70 games due to injury in the 2005–06 season, and Van Gundy did not make the playoffs for the first time in his NBA head coaching career. In May 2005, Van Gundy was fined $100,000 by the NBA, for accusing referees of targeting Houston Rockets center Yao Ming. Van Gundy blamed Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban for causing the referees' alleged bias. This is the largest fine handed down to a coach in NBA history.\n\nThe injuries and disappointments continued for the Rockets into the following season, with injuries limiting Yao to just 48 games played, and McGrady also not fully recovered from his injuries. The Rockets went on a late season run, on the back of a resurgence from McGrady, but another first round playoff loss, this time to the Utah Jazz, sealed Van Gundy's fate as the team's head coach. At the conclusion of their decisive game 7 loss in the first round of the playoffs, Van Gundy was fired, and then replaced by Rick Adelman.\n\nIn July 2017, it was announced that Van Gundy would be the head coach of the senior United States men's national basketball team at the 2017 FIBA AmeriCup tournament, and in the qualifiers for the 2019 FIBA World Cup in China. USA head coach Gregg Popovich would then resume coaching the team at the World Cup, and at the 2020 Summer Olympics, should they qualify for either. Team USA became Van Gundy's first coaching job since leaving the Rockets in 2007.\n\nVan Gundy went on to guide the US to the gold medal at the 2017 FIBA AmeriCup, and also to qualify for the 2019 FIBA World Cup.\n\nFollowing his firing from the Houston Rockets in 2007, Van Gundy was a guest analyst for ESPN's broadcast of the Phoenix Suns-San Antonio Spurs game in San Antonio, Texas, and he has since been a regular broadcast member for ESPN. He now calls many basketball games as a color commentator with play-by-play announcer Mike Breen and Mark Jackson, including the NBA Finals.\n\nJeff Van Gundy is an executive board member of Pro-Vision Academy, a charter school and non-profit organization in Houston, that provides educational, job-training, and mentoring services to boys and girls aged 10–18.\n\nVan Gundy's older brother is Stan Van Gundy, who was formerly the head coach and president of basketball operations for the Detroit Pistons.\n\nOn May 8, 2011, Van Gundy received an honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters, from his alma mater, Nazareth College, during the college's 84th Annual Commencement Ceremony.\n\n"}

The improvements included core memory of 2,000 to 10,000 words, UNISERVO II tape drives which could use either the old UNIVAC I metal tapes or the new PET tapes, and some of the circuits were transistorized although it was still a vacuum tube computer. It was fully compatible with existing UNIVAC I programs for both code and data. It weighed about .\n\nAbove figures are approximate and do not include input-output devices.\n\n \nDecimal point occurs at the right of the sign digit.\n\nAddition, subtraction, and multiplication times given below include reading and executing the instruction. The time includes formation of the result in the accumulator. All instructions, however are performed at minimum latency rates.\n\nAll users utilize a 2,000-word, 24,000-digit magnetic-core storage unit. Each of the planes is divided into two sections of 50 by 40 cores, making 2,000 cores in each section. Each section contains one core - for one binary position (bit) - of every one of the 2,000 words. The same relative binary position of the other half-word is held in a core in the same physical location in the other section of the plane. Thus each plane contains two binary positions in each of 2,000 words; the first and 43rd, for example, or the 9th and 52nd. Physically the memory is a rectangular prism .\n\nA memory location thus always implies two cores in all 42 planes. The two cores are determined by the intersection of one column of fifty possible columns with two rows of the 80 possible rows. One row is in each section of the plane. All 42 planes are used twice for each word.\n\nAssociated with the memory is a half-word insertion register of 42-bit capacity. Each bit is temporarily stored in a magnetic core of this register during a memory reference. Each of these register cores is associated with one of the 42 memory planes. To write into the memory, the first half of the word is placed in the insertion register and the address selector alerts the appropriate column and the proper row of the top section in each of the 42 planes. At the appropriate instant the information is transferred from each core of the insertion register to the selected core in the corresponding plane of the memory. Forty-two pulse times later, the second half word has been placed in the insertion register and the process is repeated in the lower section of the memory. Read-outs are accomplished in a reverse manner. The speed of the memory has been adjusted to the speed of the arithmetic portion of the Univac which permits the transfer into or out of the memory of 12 characters in 40 microseconds. Word pulses flow from or to the high speed bus and the insertion register via a mechanism which converts from serial to parallel and vice versa, in 42-bit modules.\n\nWhenever feasible, registers and other circuits appear in duplicate. Their contents are continuously compared so that inconsistencies between the data in the identical units give an indication of faulty operation, and stall the computer. At this point, the instruction may be repeated. The pulse code used in the Univac System is so designed that all characters contain an odd number of pulses. At several strategic points within Univac, every character is checked for an odd number of pulses. An indication is given whenever an even number of pulses is detected, and the computer stalls. Other types of checking circuits cause Univac to stall when other types of errors occur.\n\nAn error occurs if reference to a non-existent memory address is attempted.\n\nAn odd-even error in the transfer rI to rM will result in a transfer stop and the location of the error (rI address) will be indicated. The 720 character count will be displayed on a modulus 100 counter.\n\nIn addition to the parity bits check on the high-speed bus, a second checker establishes that the invalid \"all ones\" character is not inadvertently created by a system fault. Input and output checkers also detect the invalid \"all ones\" character.\n\nBuilt-in checking features are contained in the Card-to-Tape Converter, the Tape-to-Card Converter and the High Speed Printer.\n\nUnivac is completely fused in order that faults may be isolated. Each bay has its own set of fuses in addition to main fuses on all DC and AC potentials. If a fuse blows, power is shut off and an indicator circuit shows in which bay the blown fuse is located, and a \"flag\" indicates the specific fuse.\n\nAn automatic voltage monitoring system continuously monitors all critical DC potentials giving an alarm if any moves outside the prescribed limits.\n\nMuch of the text in this article was extracted directly from Universal Automatic Computer Model II, which is in the public domain as an original work of the United States Federal Government (US Army).

The title is frequently honorary, but in some cases the captain may have significant responsibility for strategy and teamwork while the game is in progress on the field. In either case, it is a position that indicates honor and respect from one's teammates – recognition as a leader by one's peers. In association football and cricket, a captain is also known as a skipper.\n\nVarious sports have differing roles and responsibilities for team captains. Depending on the sport, team captains may be given the responsibility of interacting with game officials regarding application and interpretation of the rules. In many team sports, the captains represent their respective teams when the match official does the coin toss at the beginning of the game.\n\nThe team captain, in some sports, is selected by the team coach, who may consider factors ranging from playing ability to leadership to serving as a good moral example to the team. Coaches may also choose to change team captains from time to time, or to have a rotation of team captains.\n\nSome of the greatest captains in history are the ones with the most subtle of traits that are required for success. From Sam Walker in his book \"The Captain Class\" he states that a captain is \"the most important factor for a team's success\". \n\nThe responsibilities of a captain vary from sport to sport, but overall help determine the game. In sports like cricket or volleyball, the decision for the two teams to be on either defence or offence is determined with a coin toss and a decision made by the captains. This decision is crucial for the captain because they will decide the beginning of the game and quite possibly how it all plays out.\n\nA captain is also the first one a referee looks too while explaining the results of a play or giving a foul, or flag. Oftentimes a referee will not discuss these matters with any other player than a captain or a coach. This is important because the reaction of the captain may or may not determine how the referee will proceed. A captain must stay calm and cool headed when talking with a referee to ensure the most accurate determinants of the game.\n\n"}

He was the youngest son of Emperor Manuel I and his third wife, Irene Syrikaina, a Trapezuntine noblewoman. John succeeded to the throne after his full-brother George was betrayed by his archons on the mountain of Taurezion. It was during his reign that the style of the rulers of Trebizond changed; until then, they claimed the traditional title of the Byzantine emperors, \"Emperor and Autocrat of the Romans\", but from John II on they changed it to \"Emperor and Autocrat of all the East, the Iberians, and the Transmarine Provinces\", although Iberia had been lost in the reign of Andronikos I Gidos.\n\nJohn is the first ruler of Trebizond for whom we know more than a few incidents and hints; there is enough information to compose a connected narrative of the first part of his reign. The chronicle of Michael Panaretos, which is often terse and even cryptic, is relatively full for John's reign, and external sources add further details to Panaretos' account. Emperor John II faced many challenges to his rule, which partly explains his marriage to the daughter of the Byzantine emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos.\n\nThis insecurity may explain the sole instance where two Emperors of Trebizond appear on the coins of this polity: John and his oldest son, Alexios. By associating himself with his son Alexios on these coins, John may be advertising his choice for his successor.\n\nJohn was born ca. 1262/3, the son of Manuel I (reigned 1238–1263) and his wife, Irene Syrikaina.\n\nJohn's reign was marked from the beginning with instability. He came to the throne in June 1280, following the betrayal and death of his brother George (r. 1266–1280) by his own officials. His first recorded act as Emperor was in 1281, when he received an embassy from Michael VIII Palaiologos (r. 1259–1282) consisting of George Acropolites and a prominent churchman by the name of Xiphilinos; the goal of this mission was to convince John to discontinue using the title of \"Emperor and Autocrat of the Romans\". Michael had gained the throne of the Empire of Nicaea through a coup against the youthful heir John IV Laskaris some 20 years before, then gained possession of Constantinople itself from the Latin Empire, and based on this achievement Michael believed that only he had the right to this title. This was not the only reason the Byzantine emperor regarded John as a threat: some opponents of Michael's acceptance of union with the Western Church saw John as a viable Orthodox candidate for the imperial throne. Michael considered high-ranking members of the Byzantine aristocracy who refused to embrace the union as threats to his reign, and they were imprisoned, flogged, blinded, or murdered.\n\nMichael had repeatedly petitioned John's predecessors to discontinue using the title of the traditional imperial title. When Acropolites and Xiphilinos presented the invitation of his daughter's hand in return for ceding his ancestral title, John refused this offer. John replied that he was following the precedent set by his predecessors and that the nobility of Trebizond would not allow him to renounce the traditional title.\n\nOnce Akropolites left Trebizond, John was faced with a rebellion led by one Papadopoulos, which according to Finlay gained control of the citadel and made John their prisoner. Finlay states that while it is not \"possible to establish the complicity of the Byzantine agents in this business\", he considers that they likely had a hand in the matter. As Finlay points out, regardless of Michael's possible machinations, \"there cannot be a doubt that it [the revolt] was the cause of producing a great change in the views of the emperor of Trebizond and his court\".\n\nFollowing the suppression of Papadopoulos' revolt, a second embassy from Michael arrived at Trebizond, composed of Demetrios Iatropoulos, \"logothetes ton oikeiakon\", and a high ecclesiastic, who offered the bargain once again. This time John agreed to the marriage, but explained it was impossible for him to lay aside the imperial title, which had been borne by his ancestors. \"The title of \"Basileus\", the purple boots, the robes embroidered with eagles, and the prostrations of the powerful chiefs of the aristocracy, were dear to the pride of the citizens of Trebizond, and attached them to the person of the emperors.\" After pledges of sincerity from Michael were made, John agreed to the marriage. However, when he reached Constantinople, his hosts induced him, before he entered the city, to lay aside his purple boots and imperial robes out of respect for Michael Palaiologos—despite the fact his future father-in-law was absent campaigning against the Turks. In exchange for this concession, Michael awarded John with the title of Despot. Michael died before the wedding took place.\n\nWhile John was away at Constantinople, David VI Narin, the Georgian King of Imereti, besieged the capital. Though King David failed to take the city, the Georgians occupied several provinces. John left for Trebizond on 25 April 1282 with his new wife, Eudokia Palaiologina. Not long after John arrived home, he was confronted by two new threats to his reign. The first was from his half-brother George, who returned to Trebizond and made an unsuccessful attempt to seize the throne. Next was his half-sister Theodora, daughter of Manuel I by his Georgian wife, Rusudan, who apparently deposed him in 1284 to rule for a short time before making a \"sudden flight\" (in Michael Panaretos' words) from Trebizond; Michel Kuršanskis suggests he may have taken refuge in Tripolis. John was restored to the throne no later than 1285.\n\nPanaretos, our primary source for his reign, offers us few details about the remainder of his reign. His account of John's reign—which amounts to three paragraphs—concludes with the statement that it was \"during his reign the Turks seized Chalybia and launched a great invasion, so that all those places became uninhabited.\"\n\nDuring the 1290s, the Ünye fortress on the western border of the country was built by him.\n\nJohn died at Limnia in 1297. John Lazaropoulos, in his \"Logos\", notes that when his son Alexios succeeded him, the western part of his realm was under heavy pressure from \"the godless Agarenes\" and only Kerasous, part of Chalybia, Oinaion, and \"the thirteen towns or forts of Limnia\" remained to the Empire; John may have been leading his forces against the enemy when he died. His body was transported to his capital and interred in the Panagia Chrysokephalos Church (\"Golden-headed\" Virgin). Portraits of John and his wife Eudokia could be seen in the church of St. Gregory of Nyssa, prior to its reconstruction in 1863. These portraits were notable that his robes were adorned with the single-headed eagle \"the special emblem of the Comneni of Trebizond\", while her robes bore the double-headed eagle of Byzantium.\n\nIt was in the later half of John's reign that his Empire attracted attention from the West. For most of the 13th century, Trebizond had not been on the minds of Western leaders: for example, they had played no part in the Council of Lyons in 1274. That changed in the 1290s. Pope Nicholas IV wrote two letters in 1291 inviting John II to convert to Catholicism, join in a new crusade for the recovery of the Holy Land and be Christianity's envoy to the Mongols. The following year an English embassy to the Mongols passed through Trebizond; Anthony Bryer notes John did little for them except lend them \"his palace chef to show how the local delicacies of the Empire were cooked.\" About this time a Genoese colony was established in Trebizond, perhaps as early as 1290, for the English embassy records meeting a merchant of Genoa, Nicolo d'Oria, in Trebizond; he may have been the Genoese consul. Also in the first years of this decade there is evidence that the Franciscans established a convent in Trebizond, which not only served as their base for evangelizing Anatolia, but provided friars to minister to the Genoese in that city.\n\nJohn II is known to have two sons by Eudokia Palaiologina:\n\n"}

The highway connects US Highway 2 (US 2) with M-28 west of Newberry. The designation has been used twice in the UP, once in 1941 for a former section of US 2 between Rexton and Epoufette, and the second in 1949 for the current corridor. The second version included a section that ran north of Newberry along what is now M-123, but it was truncated to its current routing in the 1960s. Since 1993, the trunkline has been dedicated to the 117th Quartermaster Battalion, a former National Guard unit from Kingsford.\n\nThe highway begins at US 2, one mile (1.6 km) south of Engadine and crosses the Canadian National Railway line before entering town. In Engadine, M-117 meets the western terminus of H-40 which runs on Hiawatha Trail. The trunkline passes a small pond in town and some farm fields north of Engadine. The terrain transitions to forest as the highway crosses into Luce County. The route angles slightly to the northeast to avoid Kaks Lake south of M-28 near Newberry. M-117 provides an important connection between two of the main highways in the UP. This connection is listed on the National Highway System, a network of roadways important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. Of the ten state trunklines that connect M-28 and US 2, M-117 is one of three that do not overlap either. The others are US 45 and Interstate 75.\n\nAs part of the state's maintenance of M-117, the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadway. These volumes are expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic, which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway. MDOT's surveys in 2010 showed that between 1,392 and 1,986 vehicles used the highway per day.\n\nUS 2 was rerouted in 1941 between Gould City and Epoufette, with the previous routing between Epoufette and Rexton becoming a new M-117. The route of M-117 was replaced by a realigned M-48 in 1949. The M-117 designation was transferred to a new routing between Engadine and Newberry at that time, and extended east concurrent along M-28 and north through Newberry on Business M-28 (BUS M-28), replacing a section of M-48. North of town, M-117 extended past BUS M-28 to Four Mile Corner along the former M-48.\n\nM-117 in Mackinac County was shifted to a new routing along Country Avenue in 1957. The previous routing was transferred to local control at the same time. M-117 was truncated to M-28 west of Newberry in late 1961 or early 1962. The section of highway north of M-28 through Newberry to Four Mile Corner was included in an extension of M-123 between Newberry and Paradise.

No proper system of safe operation was imposed and in 1848 a rear-end collision took place at Bay Horse station exposing the shortcomings. The situation was regularised at the end of 1848 when the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway took control. By then the London and North Western Railway was exercising oversight of the L&CR, and formal transfer to the LNWR took place in 1859.\n\nAs the railway network of Great Britain developed, a line connecting the north-west of England to Scotland was suggested by Joseph Locke in 1835. The North Union Railway was authorised in 1834, taking up unused powers to build a line to Preston from the south. This aroused considerable interest in Lancaster where a railway connection was thought highly desirable. At a public meeting on 12 April 1836 it was agreed to build a line between Lancaster and Preston. The NUR connection from Wigan to Preston did not open until 1838.\n\nLancaster would not wait for the NUR line to Preston to be ready, and on 5 May 1837 the Lancaster and Preston Junction Railway was authorised by Parliament. Share capital was £250,000.\n\nConstruction was expected to be straightforward and the return on investment was anticipated to be 10%, revised to 18% before opening. The line was twenty miles (32 km) long and the engineer was Joseph Locke. The Lancaster terminus was to be on South Road, south of the Lancaster Canal adjacent to Railway Street. At this stage any route northwards was uncertain and the canal was an important connection. When completed the station comprised a handsome building. The company made its Preston terminus at Dock Street near the Lancaster Canal, but the site had no other accommodation.\n\nThe rails were of the parallel form, (that is, not fish-bellied). Larch sleepers were used on embankments and stone block sleepers elsewhere.\n\nThe line was opened ceremonially on 25 June 1840 and a public service operated from the following day. Five passenger trains ran each way every weekday, of which two had through coaches to and from London; on Sundays, only these \"mail\" trains ran. Only one train a day conveyed third class passengers. Traffic was disappointing: while Lancaster remained a terminus, its trade alone could not sustain a railway particularly because of competition from the Lancaster Canal whose packet boats had operated since 1833. They were more comfortable than railway carriages and heated in winter. The canal company lowered its fares when the railway opened and the canal ran close to Garstang, the only other sizable intermediate settlement. The boats were drawn by two horses at a canter.\n\nIn 1836, before construction of either line, the NUR had offered to extend its line northward from its intended terminus at Butler Street to Dock Street where it would acquire land for a joint station with the Lancaster company. Mutual running powers at Preston were to be included in the arrangement, and the L&PJR was to reimburse the NUR’s expenses within a month of the outlays. The L&PJR delayed agreeing as its own Act was not yet secured, but in March 1837 the NUR started building the extension, tunnelling under Fishergate, and then the L&PJR committed to paying £1,500 when it was completed. The NUR completed the extension in December 1839 and £1,500 was duly paid. When the L&PJR opened seven months later, the NUR said the payment did not get the L&PJR free use of the line to Butler Street, nor use of the station. This had been on offer, but not taken up, and did not form part of the agreement. Although this appears to have been L&PJR error, it felt aggrieved and relations between the companies were harmed. As Greville and Holt put it, having paid its share in the making of the connecting line, the L&PJR was certainly not going to pay tolls for using it.\n\nThe L&PJR had failed to agree an engine working policy until the last moment. The NUR offered to manage the locomotive fleet but the L&PJR had to acquire its share of locomotives. At the last minute the L&PJR agreed to the arrangement but failed to get the complement of locomotives ready in time. The NUR discovered that the L&PJR track was of poor quality and considered that its locomotives were being damaged in running over it; there was evidently friction in day-to-day operation too. The NUR gave six months’ notice in June 1841 to terminate the locomotive arrangement. John Hargreaves who was working freight traffic on the L&PJR line under contract, acquired the L&PJR locomotive fleet and took over the locomotive working.\n\nThe Bolton and Preston Railway built a line from Bolton to Chorley and Hargreaves was working the line. The NUR considered the B&PR a hostile competitor and collaboration between the B&PR and the L&PJR exacerbated bad feeling from the NUR. The Bolton and Preston Railway had intended to build throughout to Preston which would have duplicated much of the NUR route and given it a shorter route from Preston to Manchester. In a change of plan, it now intended to make a junction with the NUR Euxton and reach Preston over the NUR. Its original intention to have a station at Preston remained, and in a further heightening of tension, the B&PR agreed to build the station there for the use of the L&PJR.\n\nThe L&PJR used its basic Dock Street station and some trains continued to Butler Street, the NUR Preston station. Passengers travelling through were charged a supplement of 6d, but some left the train at Dock Street and walked to Butler Street to rejoin the same train. The L&PJR terminus at Dock Street was little more than a siding with buffer stops and a short, low timber platform. Access to Fishergate was by way of a cinder path and a flight of steps.\n\nThe B&PR station was ready early in 1842. It was adjacent to Maxwell House and sometimes known by that name. It was a terminus, accessed from the north, and could not be used for through trains. The NUR feared that B&PR plans to duplicate the route from Euxton to Preston station might be revived. When the B&PR made its connection at Euxton, it relied on running over the NUR to get to Preston, and the NUR exploited the opportunity to charge high tolls. The B&PR was seriously weakened and was amalgamated with the NUR in 1843.\n\nThe L&PJR was also weakened by the friction and its dependency on the hostile NUR. In 1842 it sought a purchaser, either the B&PR which was in financial difficulties or the NUR, which declined. On 14 July 1842 the Lancaster Canal company agreed to take a 21-year lease of the L&PJR, effective from 1 September 1842 which was ratified by Parliament on 3 April 1843. The lease charge was £30,000 per annum. \nThe detached B&PR station at Maxwell House continued to be used by the Lancaster trains, but when the B&PR was absorbed by the NUR in 1844, the station passed to the NUR who refused to use the station. The canal company had to negotiate a rent to use Butler Street station which was agreed from 13 February 1844.\n\nThe Lancaster and Carlisle Railway was authorised on 6 June 1844, and the west coast main line was being created. The L&CR directors had an interest in the proper management of the L&PJR. In March 1844 a committee of the L&CR recommended leasing the Canal Company, and through that the L&PJR, but ambiguities in the lease of the L&PJR were discovered frustrating the plan. Further attempts to regularise matters were also unsuccessful. From 22 September 1846 the L&CR opened its line from Kendal to Lancaster, and its trains ran on to Preston without formal authorisation. The Lancaster station was a through station and the line by-passed the L&PJR terminus. By this time the London and North Western Railway, formed by amalgamating several networks including the North Union Railway, had come into being and was friendly to the L&CR, condoning the use of the Preston station. Meanwhile L&PJR trains operated independently from the original Lancaster station to Preston Dock Street.\n\nThe management of the line was extremely sub-divided and ineffective, summarised by Captain Laffan of the Board of Trade:\n\nIn July, 1842, an agreement was made between the Directors of the L&PJR and the Lancaster Canal Company, by which the latter Company were to become lessees of the Railway for 21 years. It was agreed that the whole of the line, works, working stock, &c., were given up to the Canal Company on the 1st September, 1842. Since that time the Canal Company have remained in possession, and have continued to maintain and to work the line. As the Railway Company, however, had no power in 1842 to grant a lease of their line for a longer period than three years, and as the Canal Company had then no power to take a lease of any Railway, one of the conditions of the agreement was, that the two Companies should jointly apply for an Act to confirm the agreement, and to give them what powers were necessary to enable them to execute a formal lease. An Act was obtained in the following session (July, 1843); but upon the formal lease being drawn up, in accordance with the conditions of the agreement, the Railway Company refused to ratify it unless certain additional conditions were introduced to which the Canal Company refused to accede.\n\nThe Canal Company have retained possession of the line, and regularly fulfilled the condition of their agreement, paying every year the stipulated rent. The Railway Company acknowledge that the Canal Company is legally in possession, but they assert that they are so only as yearly tenants. The Canal Company, on the other hand, not content to remain in that position, have applied to the Court of Chancery for an injunction to compel the Railway Company to fulfil their original agreement, and grant a formal lease in accordance with it.\nIn this position matters would now have been but for the intervention of a third party. In February, 1844, the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway Company proposed to purchase the portion of the canal between Lancaster and Kendal, and the Canal Company's interest in the Lancaster and Preston Railway. To this the Canal Company were willing to accede, and in the spring of 1844 the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway Company obtained their Act, with powers to make that purchase. The two Companies, however, could not agree upon the terms, and the purchase has therefore never been completed. In the spring of 1846 the L&PJR directors prepared an agreement for the amalgamation of the two Companies. This latter agreement was made by the Directors of the Lancaster and Preston Railway, but the shareholders refused to ratify it, and all the officers of the Company, and all the Directors but one resigned in consequence. It is probable that they did not foresee the consequences of that Act.\n\nAs the Act of Parliament embodying the Company specified that all vacancies in the direction were to be filled up by the remaining Directors, and as only one Director remained, it was contended that the Company had no powers to elect a new body of Directors. The Company, acting under this impression, applied to Parliament for powers to elect a new direction, but the committee of the House, to whom the Bill was referred, refused to entertain the application unless it was accompanied by a revision of the tolls upon the line, which, having been authorized in 1837, were much higher than those of the more modern lines. The Company preferred remaining without a direction to consenting a revision of their high tolls, and withdrew the Bill.\n\nFinally, the Lancaster and Carlisle Company gave notice that they would run their own trains over the line, and that they would pay whatever the law should declare to be a legal rate of toll to such parties as should be entitled to receive it. In pursuance of this notice they have run their own trains over this line since the opening of their own, but they have paid no toll. They keep a regular account of the amount of their traffic which passes over the line, and deliver a copy of it monthly to the Canal and to the Lancaster and Preston Railway Companies, and they state their readiness to abide by the decision of a court of law as to what amount of toll they should pay, or to refer that question to the decision of the Railway Commissioners, or to the arbitration of any disinterested parties.\n\nIt results from the preceding explanation, that the Lancaster and Carlisle Company are now running their trains over the Lancaster and Preston Railway, not only without the consent of the actual possessors, but in defiance of their opposition, and that till the differences still pending between the proprietors of that line and their lessees are decided, neither party will feel much interested in or will go to much expense to maintain the efficiency of the Railway. The Railway Company throw the whole onus of any deficiency upon the tenants in possession who are charged with the maintenance and repairs, and the tenants in possession will not lay out money upon works from which they may soon be dispossessed. Such a state of things must necessarily endanger the safety of the public using this line.\n\nOn 21 August 1848, a northbound express train ran into the rear of a stopping train at Bay Horse, a passenger station on the L&PJR about five miles south of Lancaster. The express had arrived at Preston late, and was sent forward after a stopping train. The time interval system of train control was in operation. The stopping train was carrying out station duties, when the express train approached at 40 mph. The sole means of warning the driver of the obstruction in the station was a red flag hoisted on a pole, but the flag was indistinct and not seen. The speed of the express was reduced when the driver saw the stopping train ahead, but a collision at 8 mph took place; one person was killed and several injured.\n\nCaptain Laffan made a site inspection during the Board of Trade inquiry. He reported that he\n\nfound that the signals at the stations were of the rudest description, and that though they might have sufficed for the traffic when this Railway was only a small local line, they are utterly insufficient to provide for the public safety now that it forms part of one of the great chains of railway communication with the North. There is but one signal at each station, so that it is impossible to tell to which line of rails it applies, and that one signal consists simply of a small red flag hoisted to a staff. At some of the stations an attempt is made to keep the flag square with the line by fixing to it small cross sticks, but at others, and particularly at the Bay Horse station, where the present collision occurred, there is simply a small stick at top, and the flag not being held down in any way, blows about freely, and can scarcely be perceived when the wind blows up or down the line. On Monday, when I was at the Bay Horse station, it was a remarkably fine bright day, and having directed the signal to be hoisted. I walked away from it to ascertain at what distance it could be seen. I had scarcely got 200 yards when, turning round by chance, I was surprised at not seeing the flag.\n\nI returned to ascertain the cause, and on getting nearer perceived that in fluttering to the wind it had wrapped itself so tightly round the staff that, at a short distance, it could not be distinguished from it. Had another express train been coming round the neighbouring curve just then, and another local train been standing in the station, it is probable that a second disaster would have occurred.\n\nThe insufficiency of these signals was [previously] pointed out to the Company by Captain Coddington, but his suggestions were not attended to.\n\nThe grievous scandal motivated a change of management, and yet progress was slow. At last, on 13 November 1848, agreement was reached for the L&CR to take over the management of the Lancaster Canal including the L&PJR, confirmed by Act of 1 August 1849. The outstanding toll payments for the L&CR trains having run over the Lancaster-Preston line from 22 September 1846 to 31 July 1849, which had been retained but not handed over, amounted to £83,616.\n\nThe end of the L&PJR as a legal entity came when an amalgamation act (with the L&CR) was passed on 13 August 1859. L&PJR shareholders received nearly £102 of L&CR ordinary stock for each £100 of L&PJR.\n\nWith effect from 1 August 1859 the LNWR took a 900-year lease of the L&CR, guaranteeing a minimum dividend of 8%; thus the L&PJR system passed to the LNWR.\n\nThe Preston to Carlisle section of the West Coast Main line was electrified on the 25kV overhead system; it was energised on 25 March 1974. A full electrically operated train service started on 6 May 1974. On 7 May HM the Queen travelled the route and 'drove' the train from Preston to Lancaster.\n\nToday the line is the part of the West Coast Main Line. The North Union station at Preston is now Preston railway station. The L&PJR Lancaster station has closed and none of the L&PJR stations have survived.\n\n\n"}

Portman Jr.. Opened in 1985, it is located on Times Square at 1535 Broadway at the corner of 45th Street.\n\nThe hotel's construction was first disclosed on November 3, 1972, as a $75-million, 2,000-room project to be developed by Western International Hotels and architect/developer John Portman. The project was officially announced on July 11, 1973 by Mayor John Lindsay and Portman. Construction was set to begin in 1974, with the hotel set to open in 1977. The project was postponed after a fiscal crisis in 1975, before it was restarted under Mayor Ed Koch.\n\nFive historic theaters—the original Helen Hayes, Morosco, Bijou, and the remnants of the Astor and Gaiety—needed to be demolished to clear the site. Protesters, including actor Christopher Reeve and impresario Joseph Papp, tried to stop the destruction, even forcing a Supreme Court challenge. By the time construction began, years later, original operators Westin had dropped out due to the delay and Marriott built the hotel in a joint partnership with Portman's development company. The hotel opened on September 3, 1985.\n\nAs a partial replacement for the demolished theaters, the Marquis Theatre was built as part of the approval for the building of the hotel. It is located within the hotel on the third floor. The Marriott was the first major project in the Times Square revitalization, and has been credited as the starting point for the regeneration of Times Square.\n\nThe hotel is famous for its atrium lobby, rising 48 stories to \"The View\", New York's only rooftop revolving restaurant and lounge. The View is the second highest restaurant in New York City behind the Rainbow Room on the 65th floor of 30 Rockefeller Plaza. With 1,966 rooms and over of meeting space, it is the second largest hotel in the city, surpassed only by the New York Hilton Midtown.\n\nThe Marriott Marquis high-tech elevator system, supplied by Schindler, is famous in its own right for being one of the earliest installations of destination dispatch, which reduces travel time and improves efficiency by assigning passengers to elevator cars according to their destination floors.\n\n"}

He also designed the storage facilities in Constanța seaport, one of the earliest examples of reinforced concrete architecture in Europe.\n\nSaligny was born in Șerbănești, Tecuci County (nowadays, Galați County). His father, Alfred Saligny, an educator of French descent, was an immigrant to Moldavia, coming from Prussia. He started his studies at the boarding school founded by his father in Focșani, then went on to high school, initially also in Focșani and then in Potsdam, Germany. He pursued engineering studies at the Royal Technical Higher School in Charlottenburg, and then contributed to the construction of railways in Saxony (Cottbus-Frankfurt an der Oder). He was a founding member of the Bucharest Polytechnic Society (the precursor of today's Politehnica University of Bucharest) and was even appointed Minister of Public Works. In 1892, he was elected a member of the Romanian Academy, and he served as its president between 1907 and 1910.\n\nAnghel Saligny's brother Alfons Oscar Saligny was a chemist and educator who was also elected a member of the Romanian Academy.\n\nIn all of his works (bridges, roads, silos, ports etc.), new elements are to be found. Some of them were considered great technological advances at the time.\n\nSaligny drew the plans for the Adjud–Târgu Ocna railway, which included the first mixed-use (railway and highway) bridges in Romania (1881–1882). He was also involved in the construction of numerous other metallic bridges, such as the one at Cosmești over the Siret river, which measured 430 m in length.\n\nBetween 1884 and 1889, Saligny planned and built the first silos in the world made of reinforced concrete, which are preserved today in Constanţa, Brăila, and Galați. In the port of Constanța, he designed a special pool to allow oil export and two silos for grain export.\nSaligny's most important work was the King Carol I Bridge over the Danube at Cernavodă. Although a public offer had been held by the Romanian government for the erection of a bridge in that location, all projects were found to be subpar and subsequently rejected. Taking Saligny's previous experience into account, the Romanian government hired him and gave him the daunting (at the time) task to draw up the plans for the new structure. Construction work for the bridge started 26 November 1890, in the presence of King Carol I of Romania. The bridge has five openings, with four being 140 m wide, and the central one spanning 190 m. To allow ships to pass under the bridge, it was raised 30 m above the water. The endurance test was performed on the official opening day, when a convoy of locomotives drove on it at 85 km/h. The bridge at Cernavodă measures 4,037 m in length, with 1,662 m over the Danube, and 920 m over the Borcea Arm. At the time, it was the longest bridge in Europe, and the second longest bridge in the world. The structure was famous for its era, competing with Gustave Eiffel's engineering works in France — the Garabit viaduct and the Eiffel Tower in Paris.\n\n\n"}

It is one of the four universities that make up Taiwan's Public Ivy, listed as one of the national seven universities in research, and among top maritime colleges and business schools in East Asia.\n\nThe first national comprehensive university in Southern Taiwan, NSYSU was founded twice (in 1924 and 1980) in response to the national development needs, the alumni of both the original Sun Yat-sen University and the historical Moscow Sun Yat-sen University also have contributed to the re-establishment of the university. In the beginning, all the Sun Yat-sen Universities adopted a statism educational model () based-on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's philosophy. Present-day NSYSU is a normal public university, it is famous for its powerful political and commercial relations, and the exchange offices of the US Federal government, the Japanese government, and the European Commission are present on the campus.\n\nThe university often ranks among the world's top 400 universities overall, it is organized into six colleges, but it also contains a considerable number of research institutes. NSYSU's programs in applied science, management, marine sciences, and social science have consistently been ranked among Taiwan's top three. Furthermore, the university is the birthplace of the first Sinophone bulletin board system ().\n\nNSYSU's faculty maintain strong ties to industry and government officials, many of whom also serve as elite bureaucrats and NGO advisors.\n\nIn 1923, two years before his death, the Founding Father of the Republic of China (ROC), Dr. Sun Yat-sen, established two universities, one civil and one military. The civil university was National Kwangtung University (, renamed National Sun Yat-sen University in 1926), and the military university was Whampoa Military Academy. Both universities generated remarkable contributions and played an important education role in modern Chinese history.\n\nAfter National Sun Yat-sen University was established in Canton, it had to move south due to the Sino-Japanese War. The university moved first to Yunnan, and later to North Guangdong. Finally, in 1945, the university moved back to and resumed operations at its original campus in Canton.\n\nIn 1949, the government of the Republic of China moved to Taiwan. Its alumni expected the National Sun Yet-sen University (NSYSU) to be re-established in Taiwan, but appropriate timing didn't occur until 1980, when Moscow Sun Yat-sen University graduate, President Chiang Ching-kuo gave his approval, Dr. Lee Huan then led the project to establish the university at its current campus location at Sizihwan in Kaohsiung City, the second largest metropolitan area in Taiwan. Several successive presidents all carried the tradition of nurturing the university's growth and development.\n\nWhen it was re-established, the university had four departments, two graduate institutes, and 189 students. Today, the university has 6 colleges (Liberal Arts, Sciences, Engineering, Management, Marine Sciences, and Social Sciences) and over 9500 students, offering 18 undergraduate majors, 35 masters programs, and 26 doctorate programs. NSYSU has grown, and is now recognized with international distinction as one of Taiwan's important research and learning institutions.\n\nNSYSU was named by the Ministry of Education as one of the country's seven major research-intensive universities in 2002. Two years later, the College of Management became the nation's first AACSB accredited public university. In addition, NSYSU received the first/second stage grant of the \"Aim for the Top University Plan\" from the Ministry of Education in 2011 and 2016. Four years later, the university has held the 1st \"NSYSU & UCSD Joint Symposium\" on international academic cooperation.\n\nIn the final two months of 2014, two Nobel laureates (Akira Suzuki and Hiroshi Amano) visited the university.\nDespite its small-medium size, National Sun Yat-sen University has always had outstanding research capabilities. The \"Asia Pacific Ocean Research Center\" at NSYSU is a world-class Kuroshio research center, it possesses the most advanced marine current power generation technology worldwide. The \"Electronic Commerce and Internet Society Research Center\" at NSYSU is the only social science research center in Taiwan that has been selected for the European Commission's 7th Framework Programme (FP7) SSH-NCP.\n\n\n\n\nLocated alongside the Kaohsiung Harbor and a military base, the NSYSU campus is surrounded on three sides by mountains and also faces the open waters of the Taiwan Strait, thus making it a natural fortress. The Sizihwan beach (one of Eight Views of Taiwan) is located right on campus which makes the campus one of the most beautiful campuses in Taiwan. There are several characteristics like:\n\nFrom April 21 to 22, 1923, Prince Hirohito visited the Takao Port to inspect Kongō Maru. He lives in the Takao Mountain Guesthouse a.k.a Takao Imperial Guesthouse , which was newly built. In order to celebrate the birthday of Prince Hirohito on April 29, Den Kenjirō, the Governor-General of Taiwan, renamed the Guesthouse Juzan-kan . After the Government of the Republic of China takes over Taiwan, Juzan territory became a military control district, and then Guesthouse was dismantled. The site is now a dormitory for faculty and staff of National Sun Yat-sen University.\n\nSizihwan Tunnel was completed in October 1928, and it was called Juzan-do connecting the Sizihwan at that time and the downtown Takao. Now it is connecting National Sun Yat-sen University and Hamasen.\n\nIn 1937, the Imperial Japanese Navy built a two-story building named Takao Sightseeing Hall . After the R.O.C. government takes over Taiwan, it became one of Guesthouses of Chiang Kai-shek. President Chiang Kai-shek and his madame always stay at the Guesthouse every time they go south. In 1980, the building was transferred to National Sun Yat-sen University, and in 1999 it was given another name Sizihwan Art Gallery. In 2004, the gallery was designated as the Kaohsiung City Historic Site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNSYSU has six colleges: Engineering, Liberal Arts, Management, Marine Sciences, Science, and Social Sciences.\n\nAs of 2017, NSYSU had 68 research centers, including the following most important key centers:\n\n\n\nEvery year there are about 50 international exchange students who come to study, primarily in management and business-focused areas taught in English. They also learn about Taiwanese culture as well as some varieties of Chinese language. The university also has a separate language institute where fee-paying students can study Mandarin and Taiwanese. There also are a similar number of out-going exchange students who travel each year to NSYSU's partner universities such as Malaysia Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman. NSYSU has an active International Student Association. In 2009-2010 well over 250 international students were members of the ISA association at NSYSU, participating in over 20 student events. ISA has five key points: Student Services, Public Services, Social Events, Sports and Scholarship. The 2010-2011 International Student Executive Board will tentatively be elected in the fall of 2010 at NSYSU. The Office of International Affairs at NSYSU traditionally has monitored the election process.\n\nThe first Taiwanese doctor of Chinese nationality (PRC) graduated from NSYSU's Institute of China and Asia-Pacific Studies.\n\nNSYSU graduates include a President of the Legislative Yuan, a Mayor of Kaohsiung, and a sizable number of CEOs from the 500 largest companies in the world, such as John Lin, the Vice President of eBay, Distinguished Professor Yuei-An Liou, a well-known space scientist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was founded in 1964 by Richard Hoggart, its first director. From 1964 to 2002, the Centre played a \"critical\" role in developing the field of cultural studies.\n\nThe Centre was the focus for what became known as the Birmingham School of Cultural Studies, or, more generally, 'British cultural studies'. After its first director, Richard Hoggart departed in 1968, the Centre was led by Stuart Hall (19691979). He was succeeded by Richard Johnson (19801987). The Birmingham CCCS approach to culture and politics evolved from a complex moment within British post-war history: the rise of the anti-Stalinist New Left; the promotion of adult education in Britain after World War II; the \"Americanization\" of British popular culture and the growth of mass communication in the decades after 1945; the growing multiculturalism of British society; and, the eventual influence within British academia of new critical methods like semiotics and structuralism. Drawing on a variety of influences (feminism, structuralism, Marxism especially the work of Louis Althusser and Antonio Gramsci, sociology, critical race theory, and post-structuralism), over the course of several decades the Centre pioneered a variety of approaches to the study of culture, including: ideological analysis; studies of working-class cultures and subcultures; the role of media audiences; feminist cultural research; hegemonic struggles in state politics; and the place of race in social and cultural processes. Notable Centre books include \"Off-Centre: Feminism and Cultural Studies\", \"Resistance through Rituals\", \"The Empire Strikes Back\", \"Border Patrols: Policing the Boundaries of Heterosexuality\". The history of this development can be found in the series of stencilled occasional papers the Centre published between 1973 and 1988. To mark the 50th anniversary of the CCCS's founding, the University of Birmingham—in collaboration with former members of staff at the Centre, including Richard Johnson, Stuart Hall and Michael Green—created an archive of CCCS-related material at the Cadbury Research Library at Birmingham.\n\nThe Centre produced many key studies and developed the careers of prominent researchers and academics. Stuart Hall, who became the centre's director in 1968, developed his seminal \"Encoding/Decoding\" model of communication here. Of special importance is the collective research that led to Policing the Crisis (1978), a study of law and order campaigns that focused on \"mugging\" (a code for street violence). This anticipated many of the law and order themes of Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government in the 1980s. David Morley and Charlotte Brunsdon pioneered the Centre's approach to empirical research in \"The Nationwide Project\" .\n\nRichard Johnson was later director and encouraged research in social and cultural history. The centre staff included Maureen McNeil, noted theorist of culture and science, Michael Green who focused on media, cultural policy and regional cultures in the midlands, and Ann Gray, culture and media.\n\nGraduates and associates of the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies and the Department of Cultural Studies include:\n\n\nThe new Department of Cultural Studies and Sociology was unexpectedly and abruptly closed in 2002, a move the university's senior management described as 'restructuring'. The immediate reason given for disestablishment of the new department was an unexpectedly low result in the UK's Research Assessment Exercise of 2001, though a dean from the university described the decision as a consequence of \"inexperienced 'macho management.'\" Students and staff unsuccessfully campaigned to save the school, which gained considerable attention in the national press and sparked numerous letters of support from former alumni all over the world. Four of the department's fourteen members of staff were to be \"retained\" and its hundreds of students (nearly 250 undergraduates and postgraduates at that time, many from abroad) to be transferred to other departments. In the ensuing dispute most department staff left.\n\nAlec Gordon, The Genesis of Radical Cultural Studies: Contribution to a Reconstruction of Cultural Studies as Counter-Intellectual Critique [The Intellectual History of the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies, University of Birmingham, England, 1963-1975]\nUnpublished Ph.D thesis, University of Leeds, June 1988. \n"}

It is used when a piper performs at high-profile or State occasions where the pipe banner will be tied to the bass drone of her or his bagpipes. It is a rather expensive handmade item embroidered with bullion threads.\n\nAlthough pipe banners are widely used by pipe bands of civilian, military and para-military origins around the world, they are most commonly used by bagpipe players in the United Kingdom and Commonwealth countries. For a civilian pipe band, its pipe banners would normally feature the crest or coat of arms of a Scottish clan to which the band is affiliated. For military or para-military pipe bands, their banners usually feature different combinations of the following:\n\n\nIn addition, pipe bands of Scottish regiments in the British Army usually have designated pipers for each individual company in the regiments. In such case, there will also be company pipe banners that feature each infantry company's badge and these banners are only carried by the companies' pipers. Furthermore, a battalion's Commanding Officer may have his own piper as well, and in this case, there might also be a special pipe banner for this piper. In some regiments, it is customary for officers to donate pipe banners to their regiment's pipers at the time of their retirement.\n\nPipe banners may also be presented to a pipe band at a special occasion. For instance, it is not uncommon that a sponsor or dignitary would present a special pipe banner to a regiment or police force on its centenary celebration. While pipe banners are not revered in the military as regimental or King's or Queen's colours, they are, however, considered to be important due to their historical values and their associations with authoritative establishments. Some regiments would even keep their pipe banners in their officers messes alongside their colours when the banners are not in use.\n"}
{"id": "1874543", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1874543", "title": "Cut and fill", "text": "Cut and fill\n\nIn earthmoving, cut and fill is the process of constructing a railway, road or canal whereby the amount of material from cuts roughly matches the amount of fill needed to make nearby embankments, so minimizing the amount of construction labor.\n\nCut slopes are rarely created greater than a slope of two to one (horizontal to vertical dimensions).\nCut sections of roadway or rail are characterized by the roadway being lower in elevation than the surrounding terrain. From an operational standpoint there are unique environmental effects associated with cut sections of roadway. For example, air pollutants can concentrate in the ‘'valleys'‘ created by the cut section. Conversely, noise pollution is mitigated by cut sections since an effective blockage of line of sight sound propagation is created by the depressed roadway design.\n\nFill sections manifest as elevated sections of a roadway or trackbed. Environmental effects of fill sections are typically favorable with respect to air pollution dispersal, but in the matter of sound propagation, exposure of nearby residents is generally increased, since sound walls and other forms of sound path blockage are less effective in this geometry.\n\nThere are a variety of reasons for creating fills, among them reduction of grade along a route or elevation of the route above water, swampy ground, or areas where snow drifts frequently collect. Fills can also be used to cover tree stumps, rocks, or unstable soil, in which case material with a higher bearing capacity is placed on top of the obstacle in order to carry the weight of the roadway or railway and reduce differential settlement.\n\nThe practice of cut-and-fill was widely utilized to construct tracks along rolling terrain across the British Isles. It was later performed on new dwellings for returned soldiers in Ireland at the end of World War II. This application was developed by Irish railway engineer Lachlan J. Boland, who saw the benefits of introducing railway practices to residential construction.\n\nA number of software products are available for calculating cut and fill. A simple approach involves defining different earthworks features in a software program and then adjusting elevations manually to calculate the optimal cut and fill. More sophisticated software is able to automatically balance cut and fill and take account of materials. Software that can do this falls under the broad category of earthworks estimation software.\n"}

{"id": "1874546", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1874546", "title": "Arizona Stadium", "text": "Arizona Stadium\n\nArizona Stadium is an outdoor college football stadium in Tucson, Arizona, on the campus of the University of Arizona. It is the home field of the Arizona Wildcats of the Pac-12 Conference.\n\nOriginally constructed in 1929 to hold 7,000 spectators, the stadium's seating capacity has been expanded numerous times since. As of 2019, the stadium has a total capacity of 50,782. The facility also includes the offices of the Wildcat football program, as well as some non-athletic academic offices, including the Steward Observatory Mirror Lab.\n\nLocated in central Tucson, Arizona Stadium has been home to University of Arizona Wildcats football since 1929. Initially, stadium capacity was 7,000, with the only seating located on the stadium's west side. Arizona's first game at the facility was October 12, 1929, when the Wildcats defeated Caltech 35-0. Capacity was increased to 10,000 in 1938 when seats were constructed on the stadium's east side. 4,000 seats were added to both end zones in 1947.\n\nIn 1950, a horseshoe configuration was constructed around the south end zone resulting in the addition of almost 8,700 seats. A multi-level press box and 10,000 seats were added to the west grandstand in 1965. The east side of the stadium received a second tier, consisting of 17,000 seats, in 1976, as the Wildcats prepared to leave the WAC for the Pac-8 in 1978.\n\nThe Copper Bowl (now known as the Cactus Bowl) was a postseason bowl game based in Tucson and held at Arizona Stadium for ten years before moving to Phoenix (the game is now played in Tempe at Sun Devil Stadium, home to Arizona's instate rival Arizona State).\n\nIn 1981, the track team stopped using the stadium and the track was removed. Permanent seating was placed at the north end zone in 1988. Following the 1988 season, a new press box with luxury sky boxes was built. The sky boxes include a 319 loge seats on the first level, 23 luxury suites between the 2nd and 3rd levels, and a media level on the 4th floor. Because the stadium was in place, the sky boxes are built so that the structure is cantilevered out over the western edge of the stadium seats, without actually touching the stadium. Prior to the 1999 season, a new scoreboard with a video monitor was installed.\n\nIn January 2011, it was announced that a new video board would be installed above the south stands in time for the 2011 season. It is the seventh-largest video screen in college football (sixth-largest if non-college-exclusive stadiums are excluded, as Miami shares Hard Rock Stadium with the Miami Dolphins).\n\nIn September 2009, Arizona announced plans for the Lowell-Stevens Football Facility, a $72.3 million north end-zone project with seats and luxury boxes atop a four-story complex housing locker rooms, football offices, a weight training area, a cafeteria for student athletes, the upscale Sands Club, and new concessions and bathrooms. The project broke ground after the conclusion of the 2011 season. Because the north bleachers were torn down and the project wouldn't be finished during the 2012 season, several rows of seats were added to the bottom of the south endzone in mid-2012. On July 1 of 2013, the project was completed and the team officially moved into the new facility. Because the football offices were formerly housed in the McKale Center, more room was made there for Wildcats basketball and the other Arizona athletic programs.\n\nIn addition to the Lowell-Stevens Football Facility, the playing surface was changed from natural Bermuda grass to FieldTurf, an infilled synthetic turf. The new surface allows the team to practice on the field during the week when previously it was off limits while the grass recovered between games. Because of the extreme sun and temperatures in Tucson, the athletic department chose Revolution CoolPlay FieldTurf, designed to keep the surface temperatures cooler than with other artificial turf. It utilizes cork rather than crumb rubber as the top dressing. FieldTurf is used by more than half of the teams in the Pac-12 Conference and by many other schools around the nation.\n\nThe football field runs in the traditional north–south configuration and the new artificial Field Turf sits at an elevation of above sea level. The ZonaZoo student section takes up 9,000 seats on lower east sideline, making it one of the larger student sections in the Pac-12 Conference. The west side bleachers are generally reserved for season ticket holders and the visiting team gets a section in the southwest corner.\n\nThe facility also includes two dormitories, Pinal and Navajo, under the south stands. The Steward Observatory Mirror Lab, a mirror fabrication facility for large telescopes, sits under the east wing. As mentioned above, there are also offices located in the Lowell-Stevens facility housing Football Operations.\nIn May 2013, the university held spring commencement ceremonies in the stadium for the first time since 1972 (they had been held in McKale Center after it opened in 1973). A reported 25,000 friends and family were in attendance at the ceremony and following light show and fireworks display.\nSince December 2015, Arizona Stadium has played host to the Arizona Bowl. Since its inception, the game has been played between teams representing the Mountain West Conference and the Sun Belt Conference. The inaugural game was played between the Nevada Wolf Pack and the Colorado State Rams, both of the Mountain West Conference as the Sun Belt Conference did not field enough bowl-eligible teams. This was the first time a bowl game featured two teams from the same conference since the 1979 Orange Bowl. Nevada won the contest 28-23. Another notable game occurred in 2017, when the New Mexico State Aggies broke their 57-year bowl-less streak by appearing in the bowl, playing and beating the Utah State Aggies.\n\nThe stadium has been the site of several concerts, including Fleetwood Mac in 1977 and a Jay-Z concert with Kelly Clarkson in 2009.\n\nIn 1983, the stadium's parking lot, located on the northeast end of the facility, was one of several filming locations for the 20th Century Fox comedy Revenge of the Nerds. The film's Adams College Greek Games sequence was shot in the space on Cherry Avenue between East 4th Street and East University Boulevard.\n\n"}

Later, in the United States, he was jailed together with his wife Myra on espionage charges. He was born in Vilkaviskis, Lithuania as Abromas Sobolevicius and sometimes used the name Abraham Sobolevicius or Adolph Senin.\n\nSoble was born in 1903 as Abromas Sobolevicius, in then-Russian controlled Lithuania to a wealthy Jewish family. Soble travelled to Leipzig, Germany in 1921, to attend college, and where he joined the German Communist Party. In 1927, travelled to the Soviet Union, where he married and then returned to Germany. Soble studied briefly at the University of Berlin where he became a Trotskyist which led to his expulsion from the Communist Party and the university. Decades later, Soble would claim that he was coerced by Soviet agents to become a spy in 1931 after his wife returned to the USSR to visit her sick mother and threats to her safety were made if he did not cooperate. These claims are considered suspect as there is evidence that Soble had earlier contact with Stalin's agents.\n\nSoble, who now adopted the name Abraham Senin, became publicly known as a prominent member of the German Trotskyist circle, visiting Leon Trotsky himself on at least two occasions. However, suspicions were aroused about his activities and Trotsky booted Senin and his brother from the party. Soble returned to the USSR and began work for Profintern. In 1940, Soviet spymaster Lavrenty Beria dispatched the entire Soble family to the United States, by way of Japan and Canada. Soble later testified that Beria had told him that if he undertook the mission to spy on the United States, Beria would allow Soble's entire family to leave the Soviet Union.\n\nSoble arrived in 1941, and took over supervision of an NKVD spy ring known as the \"Mocase\", replacing Vasily Zarubin who under the pseudonym \"Vasili Zubilin\" became the head of the NKVD in the United States.\n\nThe seeds of Soble's downfall came were actually sown in 1947, when founding member of the ring, Boris Morros confessed to FBI agents that he had been working as a Soviet spy. Morros agreed to operate as a double agent, betraying Soble and the other members of the ring. Both Soble and his wife, Myra, were arrested in 1957. Morros also named Jane Foster Zlatovski, her husband George Zlatovski, Alfred Stern, Robert Soblen, and Jacob Albam as members of the espionage ring.\n\nAfter their arrest, the Sobles were interviewed numerous times, Jack at the Federal Correction Facility in Danbury, Connecticut and Myra at the Women's House of Detention, in New York City, where they provided some information. They were questioned about members of the Rosenberg spy ring, but they both denied knowing many of the members. The Sobles revealed that they had traveled to Russia, Lithuania, Germany, France, Switzerland, Austria, Japan, Canada, and the United States on behalf of Soviet intelligence. On a mission to gather intelligence on Stalin opponent Leon Trotsky, Soble visited Trotsky in Turkey in 1931 and in Copenhagen, Denmark, a year later.\n\nWhile awaiting Trial, Soble attempted to commit suicide and government attorneys described him as a \"psychopathic personality.\" After a trial, both Soble and Myra Sobre, along with their associate Jacob Albam, were convicted on espionage charges and sentenced to prison. Myra Soble received a five-and-a-half year prison sentence for her role in the espionage ring. On October 8, 1957, Federal Judge Richard H. Levet, United States District Court, Southern District of New York, reduced her sentence to four years.\n\nSoble himself was sentenced to a seven-year sentence, which he began serving at Lewisburg Prison. In 1958, Soble intentionally swallowed more than a pound of nuts and bolts, in what was characterized as a suicide attempt but which Soble later claimed was a protest against prison conditions. In 1961, Soble testified against his brother, despite attempts by Robert's attorney to have Soble declared mentally incompetent. Robert Soblen committed suicide in 1962, and shortly thereafter, Soble was released early for good behavior.\n\nFollowing his release, Soble continued to testify for the government in other espionage trials.\n\n\n"}

He is currently performing under the ring name Mosh as one-half of the tag team The Headbangers along with Thrasher.\n\nWarrington began training under Larry Sharpe and Glenn Ruth during the early 1990s; his earliest entrance theme was a montage of him driving a Yugo down the sidewalks of Winding Way Road in Stratford, New Jersey. In 1993 he would make several appearances in the World Wrestling Federation as an enhancement talent (under the name Chaz Ware). In 1994, he teamed up with his co-trainer Glenn Ruth. He and Ruth, working as the masked team \"the Spiders\" lost to Axel and Ian Rotten in ECW. Wrestling under a variety of names and gimmicks.\n\nFirst appeared as themselves as the Spiders and then as The Flying Nuns, with Warrington as Mother Smucker and Ruth as Sister Angelica; debuting on the premiere broadcast of Shotgun Saturday Night along with Brother Love in January 1997. Warrington and Ruth were best known as Mosh (Warrington) and Thrasher (Ruth), The Headbangers, a pair of metal fans who dressed in kilts. They wrestled in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) throughout the late-1990s, briefly holding the WWF Tag Team Championship in 1997 and the NWA Tag Team Championships in 1998.\n\nAfter Thrasher suffered a knee injury in May 1999, Warrington was renamed Beaver Cleavage, a reference to the TV series \"Leave It to Beaver\". He appeared in black-and-white vignettes with his \"mother\", the voluptuous Mrs. Cleavage, and the two would exchange sexual innuendos (e.g. Mrs. Cleavage would offer Beaver some of \"Mother's milk\" when he complained that his cereal was dry). The gimmick was quickly scrapped (via a 'worked shoot' promo in which Warrington supposedly gave up on the character), and retailored.\n\nOn June 28, Warrington, now calling himself Chaz, ridiculed the Beaver Cleavage gimmick and identified Mrs. Cleavage as his girlfriend, Marianna Komlos, in a shoot-style interview. Warrington and Komlos feuded with Meat and his female entourage, then with Prince Albert. Warrington left Komlos on the September 9 episode of \"SmackDown!\", and she begged him to take her back throughout the night. On the September 13 episode of \"Raw is War\", Komlos came to ringside with a black eye, and it was implied that Warrington had beaten her. Over the following weeks, Warrington would be on the receiving end of beatdowns from various wrestlers as well as being screwed out of matches by officials, all of whom were angry at Warrington for allegedly beating Komlos. Komlos attempted to have police arrest Warrington, but he was saved by the intervention of Thrasher, who showed film that demonstrated that Komlos was lying. Komlos was arrested, and the Headbangers were reformed.\n\nThe Headbangers then took on a gimmick where they would dress as the opponents that they feuded with, such as the Dudley Boyz and the Mean Street Posse. They later turned heel, and began to dress in drag, most notably wearing breast cones. In June 2000, Warrington, once again known as Chaz, formed a new tag team with D'Lo Brown known as Lo Down. They enjoyed minor success, but were paired with Tiger Ali Singh and given the gimmicks of two bitter ethnic wrestlers who felt that they were being held down. They were given new ring attire, incorporating turbans and sashes, began using Tiger's entrance music, and were even given Arabic sounding names on one episode of \"Sunday Night Heat\". The popularity of the team rapidly dwindled; at the 2001 Royal Rumble they were both denied a spot in the Rumble match, as their spot had been given to comedian Drew Carey. The team was eventually taken off TV, and Singh and Warrington were released. Chaz had his final WWF match on the July 30, 2001 edition of \"Raw is War\" in a dark match defeating the Inferno Kid.\n\nMosh and Thrasher appeared on the Ring of Honor pay-per-view Best in the World on June 24, 2012 as the masked tag team Guardians of Truth, managed by Truth Martini. They lost to the Briscoe Brothers. Later on, the two would unmask themselves and go on to compete as the Head Bangers.\nWarrington now wrestles occasionally on the independent circuit in Florida. Warrington also plays outfield for the nationally ranked Fort Lauderdale professional kickball team \"The Meatballs\". In 2013, he joined Ring Warriors under the nickname That Simply Tremendous Dude. On October 14, 2013, he presented his Simply Tremendous Delegate Adam Barisano.

In addition to Monégasque, Niçard is also spoken by some in Monaco.\n\nMost residents of Nice and its region no longer speak Niçard, and those who do are bilingual in French. Nonetheless, today there is a developing revival of the use of the language. Some local television news is presented in Niçard (with French subtitles) and street signs in the old town of Nice are written in the dialect as well as in French. The Niçard song \"Nissa La Bella\" is often regarded as the \"anthem\" of Nice.\n\nNiçard is written using two forms:\n\nAn Italian orthography also existed but was abandoned when Nice joined the French empire in 1861 (but was reinstated briefly in 1942/3 when Italy occupied and administered the city).\n\nExample of Nissart and similarity with Italian, according to Barberis:\n\nStandard Occitan recognises regional differences. It has been written that Niçard has kept some of the oldest forms of Occitan, other dialects (such as Provençal) having been more \"frenchified\" by their history.\n\nGiuseppe Garibaldi, born in Nice in 1807, defined his \"Nizzardo\" as an Italian dialect with some influences from Occitan and French, and for this reason promoted the union of Nice to the Kingdom of Italy. Nice, in fact, had been part of the County of Savoy (then Duchy of Savoy and finally Kingdom of Sardinia) since 1388, and was given to France in exchange for the help lent in the second independence war against Austria in 1860. Italian Giulio Vignoli wrote in his book about the \"Nizzardo Italian\" population that, after Garibaldi's failed attempt in 1871 (\"Vespri Nizzardi\"), 11,000 of his supporters (nearly 1/3 of the population of Nice in the 1870s) were forced to move to Italy from Nice and were substituted by the French government with people from nearby Occitan areas. The revolts began after the elections in 1871, in which the pro-Italian party received 26,534 votes out of 29,428. The French government decided to send 10'000 men to end the rebellion, to close the Italian journals and to imprison many of the pro-Italian demonstrators; this changed the characteristic of Nissart, which started to have many loanwords from Occitan (a language that is now predominant in the Nissart dialect).\n\nEven today some scholars (like the German Werner Forner, the French Jean-Philippe Dalbera and the Italian Giulia Petracco Sicardi) agree that Niçard has some characteristics (phonetical, lexical and morphological) that are typical of the western Ligurian language.\n\nThe French scholar Jean-Philippe Dalbera (in Bernard Cerquiglini's report) pinpoints in his \"Les langues de France\" the actual existence of a Ligurian dialect, called Royasc, in the Roya Valley (near Tende), in the westernmost part of the County of Nice. Royasc, which is a Ligurian variety, should not be confused with Niçard.\n\nHowever most experts in Romance linguistics see Niçard as a variety of Occitan. Statements saying that Niçard is a Ligurian or Italian dialect are not supported by these experts (see especially Dalbera 1984). Indeed, French scholar Bernard Cerquiglini wrote in his book on the languages of France about the actual existence of a Ligurian minority in Tende, Roquebrune and Menton, a remnant of a bigger medieval \"Ligurian\" area that included Nice and most of the coastal County of Nice.\n\n\n"}

It is the home of the Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball and women's basketball teams. It opened in 1971, replacing the current Gladstein Fieldhouse. The court is named after Branch McCracken, the men's basketball coach who led the school to its first two NCAA National Championships in 1940 and 1953. Basketball sportscaster Gus Johnson calls the Assembly Hall \"the Carnegie Hall of college basketball.\"\n\nIndiana officials spent decades planning and four years of construction before The Assembly Hall was finally opened in 1971 at a cost of $26.6 million. The new \"Assembly Hall\" was named in honor of the school's first basketball arena of the same name. The facility was intended to be aesthetically pleasing and hold a large capacity while offering modern conveniences.\n\nThe opening of the arena coincided with the debut of coach Bob Knight, who guided the Hoosiers for 29 seasons before his dismissal by then-IU president Myles Brand in September 2000.\n\nSchool officials were intent on having the majority of the seats on the sides in order to improve the viewing experience, with only a small number (20 rows of bleachers) behind the baskets. Thus, in order to fit over 17,000 seats in the arena the sides needed to be very steep. The facility also features two balconies, but they are so high up that sitting in them can feel quite far away from the court.\n\nThe Assembly Hall has been criticized by some fans for its unique design. Because the facility was designed without consideration for the video replay board added in 2005 that currently hangs above center-court, some of the top rows of the lower level are obstructed from the replay board by the overhanging balcony. The entire court itself, however, is still viewable. In December 2013, 24 monitors were added to the areas that had previously been obstructed. Work was completed by Strauser Construction and Cassady Electric.\n\nIn the fall of 2018, J.C. Ripberger Construction Corp completed the new Roberts Family Team Center which includes, the new Andy Mohr Locker Room, the Oladipo Zeller Legacy Lounge, the Tim Garl Athletic Training Room and the Basketball Coaches annex. Project was completed just prior to 2018 Hoosier Hysteria.\n\nIndiana installed a new playing surface during the summer of 1995. New bleacher seats were also added, along with a media row and end seating platforms on Lobby Level.\n\nUpon his dismissal from Indiana, head coach Bob Knight predicted that with his departure advertisements would soon find their way into The Assembly Hall. Knight said, \"You'll see a new Assembly Hall this year I'm sure. There will probably be ads in it for everything from dog biscuits to Pepsi Cola, I would imagine. We've always tried to keep it really free from commercialism. It's kind of a sacred place where students come to play and students come to cheer.\" In 2005 the school completed construction of a state-of-the-art, $1.9 million scoreboard-video board. As with Knight, some Hoosier purists criticized the new scoreboard and advertisements, which had never before been in The Assembly Hall.\n\nIn the spring of 2010 a new practice facility called Cook Hall was added adjacent to The Assembly Hall. The two facilities are connected to each other by a tunnel. Cook Hall is and features coaches' offices, locker rooms, player lounges, meeting/video rooms, new practice courts, training rooms, a strength development area, and a Legacy Court.\n\nOn December 19, 2013, Indiana University announced that a $40 million donation from Cynthia \"Cindy\" Simon Skjodt, daughter of late shopping mall magnate and Indiana Pacers owner Mel Simon, would be used to renovate Assembly Hall. Indiana University renamed Assembly Hall the Simon Skjodt Assembly Hall upon the completion of the renovations and improvements, which were completed in October 2016.\n\nThe south lobby was restructured with a new entryway and dramatic atrium. Escalators replaced ramps in the south lobby. Throughout the arena, new branding and graphics were updated to celebrate the tradition and success of IU basketball.\n\nExisting bathrooms and concession stands were remodeled and new bathrooms added. A large state-of-the-art video scoreboard replaced the current bifurcated scoreboard, improving fan experience for all fans in Assembly Hall, especially those sitting in the balcony. Box seat-style seating was added above the south baseline bleachers and will generate revenue to pay for this seating and to help fund ongoing upkeep of Assembly Hall.\n\nBehind the scenes, Assembly Hall's HVAC and other infrastructure systems were updated and a state-of-the-art broadcast technology center was added to enhance IU Athletics video production and game day broadcasts.\n\nOn February 18, 2014, an long beam over a foot wide fell and damaged the seats at Assembly Hall. The scheduled game for that day against the University of Iowa was postponed due to safety concerns.\n\nThe Assembly Hall is well known as being one of the loudest venues in college basketball, aided both by passionate fans and its unique design of steep sides. A 2012 poll of four ESPN pundits ranked it third in terms of best home-court advantages in the country. Since opening for the 1971-72 season, over six million fans have attended men's basketball games at the venue. The men's team has been historically successful there, posting home winning streaks of 50 and 35 games. The Assembly Hall has been home to three national championships, 32 straight winning teams, and 12 conference champions.\n\nDuring the 2015-2016 basketball season, both the men's and women's teams went undefeated at Assembly Hall, posting a combined 33-0 record at home.\n\nOn June 22, 2007, Indiana University trustees approved the demolition of the Assembly Hall and the construction of a new basketball arena \"when appropriate\". Populous was hired to assess the benefits of renovating or replacing the Assembly Hall. The trustees decided against renovating the stadium for $115 million because construction of a new arena would cost $130 million. This idea was scrapped due to the University changing course and opting to renovate Assembly Hall.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1874573", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1874573", "title": "Cost per mille", "text": "Cost per mille\n\nCost per mille (CPM), also called cost per thousand (CPT) (in Latin, French and Italian, \"mille\" means \"one thousand\"), is a commonly used measurement in advertising. It is the cost an advertiser pays for one thousand views or clicks of an advertisement. Radio, television, newspaper, magazine, out-of-home advertising, and online advertising can be purchased on the basis of exposing the ad to one thousand viewers or listeners. It is used in marketing as a benchmarking metric to calculate the relative cost of an advertising campaign or an ad message in a given medium.\n\nThe \"cost per thousand advertising impressions\" metric (CPM) is calculated by dividing the cost of an advertising placement by the number of impressions (expressed in thousands) that it generates. CPM is useful for comparing the relative efficiency of various advertising opportunities or media and in evaluating the overall costs of advertising campaigns.\n\nFor media without countable views, CPM reflects the cost per 1000 estimated views of the ad. This traditional form of measuring advertising cost can also be used in tandem with performance based models such as percentage of sale, or cost per acquisition (CPA).\n\nThe purpose of the CPM metric is to compare the costs of advertising campaigns within and across different media. A typical advertising campaign might try to reach potential consumers in multiple locations and through various media. The cost per thousand impressions (CPM) metric enables marketers to make cost comparisons between these media, both at the planning stage and during reviews of past campaigns.\n\nMarketers calculate CPM by dividing advertising campaign costs by the number of impressions (or opportunities-to-see) that are delivered by each part of the campaign. Thus, CPM is the cost of a media campaign, relative to its success in generating impressions to see. As the impression counts are generally sizeable, marketers customarily work with the CPM impressions. Dividing by 1,000 is an industry-standard.\n\nSimilarly, revenue can be expressed in terms of Revenue per mille (RPM).\n\nTo calculate CPM, marketers first state the results of a media campaign (gross impressions). Second, they divide that result into the relevant media cost:\n\nFor example:\n\n\nNote: Notice how the CPM is $6.25 and not $0.00625, this is because we are looking at cost per thousand.\n\nThe Search Engine Marketing Professionals Organization (SEMPO) defines eCPM as:\n\nIn internet marketing, effective cost per mille is used to measure the effectiveness of a publisher's inventory being sold (by the publisher) via a CPA, CPC, or Cost per time basis. In other words, the eCPM tells the publisher what they would have received if they sold the advertising inventory on a \"CPM\" basis (instead of a CPA, CPC, or Cost per time). This information can be used to compare revenue across channels that may have widely varying traffic—by figuring the earnings per thousand impressions.\n\nExample\n\nThis shows that:\n\nCPP is the cost of an advertising campaign, relative to the rating points delivered. In a manner similar to CPM, cost per point measures the cost per rating point for an advertising campaign by dividing the cost of the advertising by the rating points delivered.\n\nThe American Marketing Association defines cost-per-rating point (CPR or CPRP) as:\n\n\n"}

The arena opened in 1989, and is named for Jack Breslin, MSU alumnus, former athlete and administrator, who first began pushing for the arena in 1969. It is home to the Michigan State Spartans men's and women's basketball teams. Although it nominally contains 16,280 seats, the arena typically holds around 10,000 for most events depending on the floor or stage setup. The Breslin Center superseded Jenison Fieldhouse, which stands approximately to the northwest, which had served since 1939.\n\nThe arena's previous basketball court was the same floor where the Spartans won the 2000 NCAA Men's Tournament, which was at the RCA Dome in Indianapolis. The school purchased the floor from the NCAA and Final Four floor installer Horner Flooring (based in Dollar Bay) after the title game, and had a plaque installed on the baseline near the Michigan State tunnel to commemorate the floor's purpose in the school's history. They updated their court before the 2016-2017 season that has a two-toned finish inside the arcs and a large Spartan Head in the middle.\n\nThe building not only serves as the home to MSU sports teams, but as the main large performance arena for the Lansing area. The Michigan State Bar Examination, large concerts, commencements, monster truck rallies, and circuses that travel to Mid Michigan are often held at the Breslin Center. With a large arena, it is Lansing's WWE venue. Many events for Michigan State are held here, including a plethora of career fairs and many Greek Life events. \n\nThe arena underwent a $50 million renovation starting in January 2016 that went until October 2017. This renovation changed many things about the Breslin, but the most notable was the addition of the Tom Izzo Basketball Hall of History. This addition includes both men's and women's basketball trophies throughout the years, along with tributes to notable former players, previous jerseys, and even a wax figure of Tom Izzo. Another notable addition, donated by Draymond Green, was a new weight room for the players. Other things included in the renovation were a locker room for former players, a players' lounge, and a recruiting room. The concourse was also widened, and improvements were made to the restrooms and concession stands for the benefit of the fans.

{"id": "1874591", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1874591", "title": "German cockroach", "text": "German cockroach\n\nThe German cockroach (\"Blattella germanica\") is a small species of cockroach, typically about long. In colour it varies from tan to almost black, and it has two dark, roughly parallel, streaks on the pronotum running anteroposteriorly from behind the head to the base of the wings. Although \"B. germanica\" has wings, it can barely fly, although it may glide when disturbed. Of the few species of cockroach that are domestic pests, it probably is the most widely troublesome example. It is very closely related to the Asian cockroach, and to the casual observer, the two appear nearly identical and may be mistaken for each other. However, the Asian cockroach is attracted to light and can fly like a moth, while the German cockroach cannot. \n\nThe German cockroach occurs widely in human buildings, but is particularly associated with restaurants, food processing facilities, hotels, and institutional establishments such as nursing homes. In cold climates, they occur only near human dwellings, because they cannot survive severe cold. Though they would soon die in the outdoors on their own, German cockroaches have been found as inquilines (\"tenants\") of human buildings as far north as Alert, Nunavut. Similarly, they have been found as far south as southern Patagonia.\n\nPreviously thought to be a native of Europe, the German cockroach later was considered to have emerged from the region of Ethiopia in Northeast Africa, but more recent evidence suggests that it actually originated in Southeast Asia. Whatever the truth of the matter, the cockroach's sensitivity to cold might reflect its origin from such warm climates, and its spread as a pest since ancient times has resulted from incidental human transport and shelter. The species now is cosmopolitan in distribution, occurring as a household pest on all continents except Antarctica, and on many major islands, as well. It accordingly has been given various names in the cultures of many regions.\n\nThough nocturnal, the German cockroach occasionally appears by day, especially if the population is crowded or has been disturbed. However, sightings are most frequent in the evening, when someone suddenly brings a light into a room deserted after dark, such as a kitchen where they have been scavenging. When excited or frightened, the species emits an unpleasant odor.\n\nGerman cockroaches are omnivorous scavengers. They are attracted particularly to meats, starches, sugars, and fatty foods. Where a shortage of foodstuff exists, they may eat household items such as soap, glue, and toothpaste. In famine conditions, they turn cannibalistic, chewing at each other's wings and legs. The German cockroach is an intermediate host of the Acanthocephalan parasite \"Moniliformis kalahariensis\".\n\nThe German cockroach reproduces faster than any other residential cockroach, growing from egg to reproductive adult in roughly 50 – 60 days. Once fertilized, a female German cockroach develops an ootheca in her abdomen. The abdomen swells as her eggs develop, until the translucent tip of the ootheca begins to protrude from the end of her abdomen, and by that time the eggs inside are fully sized, about 1/4 inch long with 16 segments. The ootheca, at first translucent, soon turns white and then within a few hours it turns pink, progressively darkening until, some 48 hours later, it attains the dark red-brown of the shell of a chestnut. The ootheca has a keel-like ridge along the line where the young emerge, and curls slightly towards that edge as it completes its maturation. A small percentage of the nymphs may hatch while the ootheca is still attached to the female, but the majority emerge some 24 hours after it has detached from the female's body. The newly hatched 3-mm-long black nymphs then progress through six or seven instars before becoming sexually mature, but ecdysis is such a hazardous process that nearly half the nymphs die of natural causes before reaching adulthood. Molted skins and dead nymphs are soon eaten by living nymphs present at the time of molting.\n\nThe German cockroach is very successful at establishing an ecological niche in buildings, and is resilient in the face of many pest-control measures. Reasons include:\nGerman cockroaches are thigmotactic, meaning they prefer confined spaces, and they are small compared to other pest species, so they can hide within small cracks and crevices that are easy to overlook, thereby evading humans and their eradication efforts. Conversely, the seasoned pest controller is alert for cracks and crevices where it is likely to be profitable to place baits or spray surfaces.\n\nTo be effective, control measures must be comprehensive, sustained, and systematic; survival of just a few eggs is quite enough to regenerate a nearly exterminated pest population within a few generations, and recolonisation from surrounding populations often is very rapid, too.\n\nAnother problem in controlling German cockroaches is the nature of their population behaviour. Though they are not social and practise no organised maternal care, females carry oothecae of 18-50 eggs (average about 32) during incubation until just before hatching, instead of dropping them as most other species of cockroaches do. This protects the eggs from certain classes of predation. Then, after hatching, nymphs largely survive by consuming excretions and moults from adults, thereby establishing their own internal microbial populations and avoiding contact with most insecticidal surface treatments and baits. One effective control is insect growth regulators (hydroprene, methoprene, etc.), which act by preventing molting, thus prevent maturation of the various instars. Caulking baseboards and around pipes may prevent the travel of adults from one apartment to another within a building.\nAs an adaptive consequence of pest control by poisoned sugar baits, a strain of German cockroaches has emerged that reacts to glucose as distastefully bitter. They refuse to eat sweetened baits, which presents an obstacle to their control, given that baits are an economical and effective means of control. It also is a dramatic illustration of adaptive selection; in the absence of poisoned sweet baits, attraction to sugars strongly promotes growth, energy, and reproduction; cockroaches that are not attracted to sugars take longer to grow and reproduce, whereas in the presence of poisoned sugared baits, sugar avoidance promotes reproduction.\n\nThe genome of the German cockroach was published in February 2018 in \"Nature Ecology and Evolution\". The relatively large genome (2.0 Gb) harbours a very high number of proteins, of which most notably one group of chemoreceptors, called the ionotropic receptors, is particularly numerous. These chemoreceptors possibly allow the German cockroach to detect a broad range of chemical cues from toxins, food, pathogens, and pheromones.\n\n\n"}

Opened in 1983, it is the home court for The University of Iowa Hawkeyes men's and women's basketball teams, as well as the university's wrestling, gymnastics, and volleyball teams. It was named for the late industrialist Roy J. Carver of Muscatine, Iowa, a prominent statewide booster, who donated $9.2 million to The University of Iowa before his death in 1981. Prior to the arena's opening, Iowa's athletic teams played at the Iowa Field House.\n\nPrior to playing in Carver-Hawkeye Arena, Iowa teams played in Close Hall (1902-1905) and then the first Iowa Armory (1905-1922). The first Armory was at the site of the current UI Communications Center building currently sits, across from the Library on the East Side of the Iowa River. Iowa teams moved to the second Iowa Armory (1922-1926), and then to the adjoining Iowa Field House (1926-1982), built directly beside the second Iowa Armory, which was incorporated into the new Field House facility. \n\nIn 1927, the Iowa Field House was opened during Paul Belding's tenure as athletic director. Considered as a \"magnificent structure for its day\", the Field House was home to Iowa's basketball and wrestling teams and included an indoor track and swimming pool.\n\nThe Field House, however, was known for its steel balconies and sub-par acoustics, along with columns that obstructed views. When demand was high for Hawkeye basketball, bleachers were placed behind the baskets, allowing some 15,000 to attend games. Season ticket sales increased during the highly successful tenures of head coaches Ralph Miller and Lute Olson, and support for a new arena gradually increased. Following approval from Iowa Board of Regents, construction of Carver-Hawkeye Arena began.\n\nEntirely funded by private contributions, the arena was expected to be open for the 1982–83 school year, but weather slowed construction to the point where the first event was held on January 3, 1983. Iowa's wrestling team defeated Oklahoma and two days later, the men's basketball team played their first game – a loss to Michigan State – in the new arena.\n\nAn NCAA attendance record for women's basketball was set on February 3, 1985. 22,157 were in attendance at Carver-Hawkeye arena as Iowa lost to rival Ohio State.\nNotable athletic events in the arena include the Big Ten and NCAA wrestling championships, the National Duals, the U.S. Olympic wrestling trials in 1984 and 2012, the UWW World Cup in 2018, and the NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Tournament.\n\nThe arena also serves as the site of commencement exercises for several of the university's colleges, and has hosted concerts by artists such as U2, Whitney Houston, Stevie Nicks, *NSYNC, Metallica, Guns N' Roses, Old Dominion, and Red Hot Chili Peppers, and speeches by Former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton as well as Desmond Tutu and Jane Goodall. Carver-Hawkeye also hosted many events in place of Hancher Auditorium and Cedar Rapids' U.S. Cellular Center while both venues underwent renovations after the Iowa flood of 2008.\n\nOn December 6, 2008, Iowa set the national collegiate wrestling dual meet attendance record as 15,955 fans packed the arena for Iowa-Iowa State match. The previous record of 15,646 was set Feb. 1, 2002, when Minnesota hosted Iowa at the Target Center in Minneapolis. Tom Brands, Brent Metcalf, and Tony Ramos are the only Hawkeye wrestlers to never lose a match during their college career in Carver-Hawkeye Arena.\n\nIn 2016, a new scoreboard was added to the arena. It measures at high by wide.\n\nOn the 7th-8th April 2018 Carver–Hawkeye Arena took senior freestyle wrestling international tournament World Cup 2018.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1874619", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1874619", "title": "Dean Smith Center", "text": "Dean Smith Center\n\nThe Dean E. Smith Student Activities Center (commonly known as the Dean Smith Center, Smith Center, or the Dean Dome) is a multi-purpose arena in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, used primarily as the home for the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Tar Heels men's basketball team. The university began to inquire about building a standalone arena for the men's basketball team beginning in the mid-1970s, but due to an ongoing university wide investigation, the fundraiser halted until its conclusion. On June 1980, the fundraising began with a goal of at least $30 million and a target completion date for the building of December 1984. It was initially planned to be called the Student Activities Center; however, after its announcement it began to be referred to as \"The Dean Dome\" and it was speculated it would be named for then coach Dean Smith. The fundraising concluded in August 1984 with over $33 million raised, but construction would not finished until 1986. The day before the opening game on January 18, 1986 against the Duke Blue Devils, the building was officially announced to be named the Dean E. Smith Student Activities Center, while a formal dedication happen later in September. In 2018, the hardwood floor of the Smith Center was named for then coach Roy Williams.\n\nLand was cleared in a wooded ravine on the southern part of campus and necessitated of rock to be dynamited out. The building is and build on and contains three levels. There are two levels for seating, an upper and lower level, from which the furthest viewing distance is . The Dean Dome has been renovated several times since its opening which has included the likes of new video boards, video ribbon along the upper level edge, seats, lighting, and sound. In addition, the locker rooms and office space have all been upgraded. Throughout the years the capacity has been adjusted through the removal of box seating for traditional seating and the addition of a standing student section behind one of the goals. The future of the arena is questioned due to a variety of issues stemming from a narrow concourse, limited storage, and a desire to have premium seating to earn more revenue. The issue is further complicated by the fact the Smith Center was privately funded and the seats paid for by the initial donors carry two full generations, which limits any possible renovation, but could be circumvented by building a new arena. \n\nThrough the 2018–19 season, the Tar Heels have played 33 seasons in the Dean Smith Center and have earned over 400 victories and under 100 losses. Despite their home success, the crowd has often been criticized for being dull and un–involved, which has been credited to the seating arrangement created by the above–mentioned donors which has limited the ability of the students to use the lower level and create noise. In addition to basketball, the venue has been used to host several concerts, graduations, sporting events, and a speech by Barack Obama when campaigning for the Democratic Presidential nomination.\n\nAfter the Tar Heels won the national championship in 1957, there were thoughts of building a big venue for the Tar Heels to play basketball in. However, Carmichael Auditorium was built onto Woollen Gymnasium and the Tar Heels began to play there in 1965-66 season. During the mid-1970s, the university began to investigate building a self-standing arena. However, the university was in the middle of a fundraising campaign called the Carolina Challenge and Chancellor Ferebee Taylor and the board of trustees did not want a campaign to build a venue to compete with the school campaign. When the Carolina Challenge ended in 1979, work on the new arena began again when a 25-member committee was created to head the project. The building was designed to be used for the men's basketball team, graduations, concerts, and exhibits.\n\nSmith stated publicly \"We all know that we can use that money better to help the University,\" while later in his memoir he also noted that \"when you can’t get a ticket, that’s the best situation for a program.\" Smith later agreed for the new building as it would allow more students to attend. According to architect Glenn Corley, assistant coach Bill Guthridge hoped the new arena would be \"big enough so that everyone who wanted to go to a game could get in, and there wouldn't be one guy outside waiting.\" Future ACC Commissioner John Swofford, Hargove \"Skipper\" Bowles, and executive Rams Club director Ernie Williamson anchored the fundraising efforts which officially started in May 1980 for a goal of at least $30 million. Bowles convinced Smith to assist the fundraising, as there were fears it would not succeed without his participation. They hosted many Rams Club and alumni meetings around the state, where they presented a model of the building while Smith and Bowles spoke to the attendees. Swofford stated during the campaign: \"The key factor, of course, was the job that Dean has done with basketball here and the respect people hold for his program.\" A proposition was made to the student body for a fee increase to be applied to help cover building costs and that increase would maintain the seating arrangements as they were in Carmichael, but it was voted down.\n\nFollowing the Tar Heels' victory in the 1982 NCAA championship game, donations increased, which Rams Club vice president Neal Harrell stated \"couldn’t have come at a better time...\" On April 17, 1982, after half the desired amount had been raised, ground was broken for the venue, with a target finish date of December 1984. On the first day of construction, contractors were banned from wearing Duke or N.C. State apparel on the job site for the duration of the build. Donations again increased significantly in 1984 when exact seating was being determined.\n\nHarrell stated that any donations over $5,000 secured the life-long right to purchase seats at the venue, while a gift over $10,000 would grant tickets for two generations. Lifetime tickets for two generations meant guaranteed tickets for the lifetime of the donor and their oldest child's. As donations increased the quality and quantity of seats improved and parking spots would be included. The effort spanned six years and included 2,362 donors. Donations ranged from $1 to $1 million. Each donor's name is located on a brass and granite plaque in 3/8-inch letters near the venue's north, main entrance. The campaign ended on August 1, 1984 and the total amount donated was over $33 million. The completion date was pushed back further to March 1985 and again until the season opener in 1985 against UCLA. Upon completion of the campaign, this became the first privately funded on-campus venue for basketball.\n\nPrior to the first game, the Student Activities center began to be referred to as the \"Dean Dome,\" which is a play on Coach Smith and the fiber-glass dome on the arena. Regarding the venue's nickname, Smith one time remarked that \"It makes me sound bald.\" A black-tie dinner was held in the building on January 17, 1986 to honor the University's Arts and Sciences Foundation. At the dinner, Chancellor Christopher C. Fordham III announced the building was to be named the Dean E. Smith Student Activities Center because \"We are a better university and a better state because he is one of us.\" The opening game on January 18, 1986 featured the No. 1 North Carolina Tar Heels against rival and No. 3 overall Duke Blue Devils on national television. Before the game, there was a ceremonial jump ball between the two teams to open the building. The first basket was scored by Duke's Mark Alarie, while the first Tar Heel who scored was Warren Martin off a dunk. During the a timeout in the game, a banner was unfurled that read “Dean’s Dome – The Tradition Continues.” The Tar Heels won the game 95–92. A formal dedication of the arena for Coach Smith happened on September 6, 1986 when a pro-alumni game was held which featured the likes of Lennie Rosenbluth, Michael Jordan, James Worthy, and many more alumni of the basketball program.\n\nDue to renovations going on at their home venue, Carmichael, the women's basketball team played their home games for the 2008–09 and 2009–10 seasons at the Dean Smith Center. The hardwood floor of the Dean Smith Center was named for head coach Roy Williams on August 24, 2018, thus becoming the Roy Williams Court. Williams on the honor stated \"It's very hard to believe; it's just so flattering,\" and wanted to thank his former and current players \"because they made the plays.\" The dedication happened during a reunion of the basketball team.\n\nThe land for the Smith Center is located on south campus in a wooded ravine near US 15-501 and Mason Farm Road. To make room for the structure, more than of rock needed to be dynamited out, along with of dirt. However, this was not completed due to the excessive blasting required for the west side, leading to a semi-circular shape of the ground floor. This led to storage and production issues almost immediately. The entire arena is 380' long by 340' wide and 140' high, with three levels. In total, the arena is spread across of land. The roof is and is skylighted. The farthest view from seat to court is . The court itself is maplewood and seven inches thick. The venue included 20 boxes near the top of the lower level for the larger donors; however, the large donors to the stadium wished for court-side seating. Due to poor views from the boxes, these areas were converted into normal seating years later. The venue's 68 rows all feed into the 1,200' long and 22' wide concourse that features several concession stands and vendors. Hanging over the court is a grid that allows for sound and lighting equipment to be hung. The architects for the project were Chapel Hill's Joe Hakan and Glenn Corley from Hakan/Corley & Associates, Finch-Heery of Atlanta, and New York City's Geiger Berger.\n\nSince the arena's opening, it has been renovated and updated several times. In 2005, the Dean Dome received four 17.8' x 23.6' high-resolution video boards, along with video ribbon boards along the edge of the upper level and along the scorer's table. Advertising was first allowed starting in later 2005 when the university reached an eight deal with Wachovia Bank. The signage would be placed with the large video boards in arena's corners, along with other sports venues that the campus had. Then athletic director Dick Baddour commented that the sponsorship was allowed in order to help finance upgrades and repairs to the Smith Center. Over the next three years all the seats and the hardwood floor were replaced. Since then the lights, sound system, and the ribbon have been further replaced. In addition, the locker rooms and \"behind the scenes\" area were renovated prior to the 2016–17 season. The university announced in February 2018 the arena would receive four new video boards, replacing ones that were in place since 2005, for a cost of roughly $6 million which also included new ribbon video board along the upper level. Athletic director Bubba Cunningham commented that the four separate video boards were chosen rather than a central, hanging video board, in part, because it would ruin the \"open feel\" as well as obscure the view of the rafter's banners that display retired and honored jerseys, national championships, and other accomplishments. The new boards were installed in October 2018 and measure 19' x 100'.\n\nThe initial capacity for the Dean Smith Center was 21,444, which made it the third largest on-campus arena for the 1985-86 college basketball season. It is presently the third-largest arena in both the nation and in the ACC (behind only Syracuse's Carrier Dome and Louisville's KFC Yum! Center, and the second-largest designed primarily for basketball (the Carrier Dome was built to host football and basketball).\n\nIn the 1990s, the seating was expanded to increase capacity to 21,572. Before the start of the Tar Heels' 2000–01 season, a standing room only section for students was added behind the basket the visiting team opposes in the first half. This increased the capacity of the arena to 21,750. The largest crowd to attend a game in the facility was 23,713 when the Smith Center hosted the 1987 U.S. Olympic Festival basketball game. The largest crowd to see a Carolina game in the Dean Dome was on March 6, 2005, when 22,125 fans saw the North Carolina Tar Heels beat the Duke Blue Devils 75-73 following a nine-point comeback in the final three minutes of regulation.\n\nThe arena was considered state-of-the-art in 1986; however, despite frequent renovations and updates, there are many issues with the building regarding its large number of seats, limited storage due to the lack of rock dynamited out in the west end, and its narrow concourse. In November 2015, Cunningham told the media that the school had been looking at renovating the Smith Center to add premium level seating and reducing the overall capacity by potentially 4,000 seats or building a replacement structure. This project would also be privately financed through donations and athletic department revenue, but not with state taxes. If the school were to renovate the Smith Center, it would continue the lifetime season ticket obligations for patrons or the second generation of the patrons that donated to the Smith Center's initial funding. A potential replacement arena would have to be built on a new site and would require a lot more money; however, it would allow for luxury seating to increase revenue and would eliminate the lifetime seating rights. Should those holding the lifetime season tickets wish to keep their rights, they would then be required to make a significant donation, rather than a minimal donation as they do currently to maintain the tickets. A new arena would greatly increase revenue through yearly seat licensing, and therefore help all athletic programs through the increase in revenue that would then increase the total athletic budget.\n\nThe Dean Dome's crowd has been criticized for being lackluster in the past. As early as 1987, a writer for \"The Daily Tar Heel\" stated the Smith Center and the university's on-campus football stadium, Kenan Memorial Stadium \"usually [resembled] tombs more than athletic arenas.\" A year later, another \"Daily Tar Heel\" writer attended a high school basketball game in the Smith Center and noted that with only 80% of the lower level filled, the fans in attendance made more noise than the Carolina fans made in their home game against NC State that season. Following a victory by Florida State, Seminole Sam Cassell was quoted as calling the fans in attendance \"like a cheese and wine crowd.\" Years following the game, Cassell elaborated on his comments stating that the older alumni–who primarily sat close to the court–weren't loud and stated that the students then sitting in the upper levels were making noise, but their effect was limited as they were higher up. Since Cassell made the comments, the words have commonly been incorrectly remembered and people tend to refer to the Smith Center crowd as a \"wine and cheese\" crowd. In contrast, Carmichael Auditorium was known for its noise level; before one game, the Virginia Cavaliers couldn't hear their names announced during player introductions because of the din.\nTypically the issue with crowd noise and involvement stems from the seating above mentioned seating arrangement issues where the lower level seats are predominately taken up by alumni that donated to help build the arena. The student sections in the lower level often vary depending on the year, but are mainly located in the upper level, far from the court. Following the introduction of the student risers behind one basket in 2000, the crowd was louder, but due to the lack of students behind the other basket, the effect is limiting. In 2004, after the then top-ranked Connecticut Huskies were defeated by Carolina at the Dean Dome, then Huskies coach Jim Calhoun said, \"I hear about the wine and cheese crowd and I don't know where the hell they are but they were not here today.\" After the Tar Heels defeated then top-ranked Ohio State in 2006, Buckeyes coach Thad Matta stated, \"I think I've never been in a building that was as loud as that building was at times.\" However, the crowd still is known to be quiet and following a road loss to the Indiana Hoosiers in 2016, then coach Williams stated \"Gosh. I’d like to play in front of a crowd like that in the Smith Center every night other than the frickin’ Duke game.\"\n\nThe Dean Dome has become known for the home–court advantage the Tar Heels possess. Through the 2018–19 season's completion, Carolina teams have played 33 seasons in the arena. Across those seasons, the Tar Heels have played 476 games where they amassed 405 wins against 71 losses, for a win percentage of 85.1%. In 5 of the 33 seasons, the team has gone undefeated in all contests at the Smith Center. While the team has only lost more than three games in a single season at the Smith Center 6 times. Their only season with a losing record was 2001–02 when the Tar Heels went 6–9.\n\nThe first concert to be hosted in the Smith Center was Kenny Rogers on April 12, 1986. \"Performance Magazine\" named the Dean E. Smith Center as the \"Venue-of-the-year\" in 1987. In addition, Pollstar Readers named it the \"Best New Major Concert Venue.\" The Smith Center hosted many concerts between its opening and 1995, hosting the likes of Pink Floyd, Garth Brooks, Bon Jovi, Guns & Roses, INXS, R.E.M., Bruce Springsteen, Grateful Dead, and more. Concerts dwindled following 1995, after which they were mainly Sesame Street Live. One of the reasons the Smith Center stopped hosting concerts was due to the inability to keep up with the musician's production demands like Metallica wanted to perform in the Dean Dome but due to fears of their hydraulic lift ruining the floor. The Smith Center's last concert was in 2008, when Boys II Men performed.\n\nThe facility is used each year for various local high schools' graduations, as well as the December commencement and various May Commencement exercises. Throughout the year blood drives and career fairs are held in the building. The 1988 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament used the Smith Center as the host for the East region's opening two rounds. The Smith Center and adjacent Koury Natatorium served as the host for various 1999 Special Olympics World Summer Games events. On April 28, 2008, Senator and Democratic presidential candidate hopeful Barack Obama held a rally in the arena before the North Carolina primary on May 6. Obama spoke in front of 18,000 wearing a Carolina blue tie while encouraging those to vote early and addressed topics like affordable college and the war in Darfur.\n\n"}

{"id": "1874626", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1874626", "title": "James D. Martin", "text": "James D. Martin\n\nJames Douglas Martin (September 1, 1918 – October 30, 2017) was an American businessman and Republican politician from the U.S. state of Alabama, who served a single term in the United States House of Representatives from 1965 to 1967. His 1962 campaign for the United States Senate against the Democrat J. Lister Hill was the first serious showing by a member of his party in Alabama since Reconstruction.\n\nBorn in Tarrant in Jefferson County, Alabama, Martin attended public schools and the Birmingham School of Law. In 1937, he began working in the petroleum industry. In July 1941, he enlisted in the United States Army and subsequently commanded an artillery battery in the Third Army under General George S. Patton, Jr., in the European Theater of Operations of World War II. An intelligence officer in the Army of Occupation, he was discharged as a Major in March 1946. He returned to Alabama to work as an oil products distributor. He was United Methodist.\n\nOriginally a conservative Democrat, Martin joined the GOP in order to challenge Senator Joseph Lister Hill. No Republican had even opposed Hill since his initial election in 1944, when John A. Posey had drawn 17 percent of the vote. Hill recognized that a backlash among some southern white voters against the administration of U.S. President John F. Kennedy could weaken his own prospects for a fifth and final term in office. He hence devised an effective strategy which only barely staved off defeat: denounce Kennedy's ongoing intervention in the desegregation of the University of Mississippi at Oxford but simultaneously extol the \"Alabama Democratic Party\" and deny inconsistency between his status as a Washington insider and his membership in a rebellious state party. Hill blamed the federal judiciary for desegregation and recalled that President Dwight D. Eisenhower, a Republican, had intervened in a similar situation in the desegregation of Central High School in 1957 in Little Rock, Arkansas. \nHill gained support from both incoming Governor George Corley Wallace, Jr., and Attorney General Richmond Flowers, Sr., who unsuccessfully opposed Wallace's wife, Lurleen Burns Wallace, in the 1966 Democratic gubernatorial primary. Wallace in particular excoriated critics of \"free enterprise ... and the social order in the South. ... For years the Democratic Party was held together by the people of the South, and we have the right to tell them [Washington, D.C.] that we disagree.\" Having only narrowly prevailed in a runoff election but unopposed in the 1962 general election, Wallace assured voters that Alabama Democrats were unbridled by the national party. Flowers lamented \"the darkest hour for Alabama and Mississippi since Lee surrendered in 1865 at Appomattox and pledged to retain segregation at the University of Alabama at Tuscaloosa and Auburn University in Auburn.\nThe fact that Martin's senatorial candidacy attracted attention was itself a novelty in Alabama, for earlier Republican candidates had been ignored by the politicians, the media, and the electorate. In accepting nomination at the state convention in Birmingham, Martin offered a vision of Republicanism counter to that in the northern states. He admonished Alabama to return to \"the spirit of '61\" - 1861, when our fathers formed a new nation (Confederate States of America). God-willing, we will not again be forced to take up rifle and bayonet to preserve these principles. . . . Make no mistake, my friends, this will be a fight. The bugle call is loud and clear. The South has risen! We have heard the call!\" Martin's campaign prompted the Democratic editor Ralph McGill of the \"Atlanta Constitution\" to compare this new breed of southern Republicans to the Dixiecrat insurgency led in 1948 against U.S. President Harry Truman by then Governor and later U.S. Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina. \nA champion of New Deal domestic programs, Hill criticized Eisenhower's attempts to reduce hospital funding under the Hill-Burton Act that he had co-sponsored. Unlike most southern senators, Hill favored federal control of offshore oil with proceeds earmarked for education. Hill strongly supported rural electrification, federally subsidized freight rates, and the Tennessee Valley Authority. Martin also supported the TVA and noted that the original sponsor of the inter-state development agency was a Republican U.S. senator, George W. Norris of Nebraska. Martin said that the TVA headquarters should be relocated from Knoxville, Tennessee, to its original point of development, Muscle Shoals, Alabama. Hill claimed credit for the deepening of the Mobile Ship Channel, the building of the Gainesville Lock and Dam in Sumter County, and the proposed Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway, a much-criticized link between the Tennessee River with the Gulf of Mexico. According to Hill, \"If Alabama is to continue the progress and development she has achieved, she cannot do so by deserting the great Democratic Party.\"\nSenator Hill pledged to seek renewed funding for the Redstone Arsenal and George C. Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, and accused Eisenhower of having neglected the space program while the former Soviet Union was placing \"Sputnik\" into the atmosphere. Strongly endorsed by organized labor, Hill accused the GOP of exploiting the South to enrich the North and the East and attacked the legacy of former President Herbert C. Hoover and the earlier \"evils\" of Reconstruction. He boasted that Alabama voters would bury the Republicans \"under an avalanche.\"\n\nUnable to match Hill's skill at landing public works projects, Martin concentrated his fire on the Kennedy administration. He condemned the candidacy of Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, the younger brother of the president who was elected to the Senate on the same day that Martin lost to Lister Hill. Martin assailed what he called \"the conquest of Mississippi\" and the \"invasion\" of Ole Miss by federal troops dispatched by President Kennedy to compel desegregation. Martin called Hill \"the No. 1 Kennedy man in the South\" and suggested Alabama voters were \"sick, tired, and disgusted\" with the Kennedy administration's New Frontier. Martin demanded that Hill \"deny or affirm an ultra-liberal voting record\" shared by liberal senators Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota, Jacob K. Javits of New York, and Wayne Morse of Oregon. Martin claimed that Kennedy had delayed signing an executive order to integrate federal housing were not he fearful that Hill could lose the Senate race in Alabama. Martin alleged a \"conspiracy\" between Hill and Kennedy and questioned why Hill would not \"acknowledge his friendship and support\" for the president. Martin joked that his challenge had \"finally brought Hill home after twenty years in an (Washington) isolation booth.\"\nOther Republicans joined Martin in attacking Hill's candidacy. Mobile attorney William Brevard Hand, later named to a south Alabama federal judgeship by President Richard Nixon, claimed that Hill had not defended states rights with sufficient fervor. Later U.S. Representative John Hall Buchanan, Jr., of Birmingham, then a conservative but later considered among the most liberal members of the party, said that the Alabama congressional delegation had responded to the University of Mississippi desegregation \"only after intense pressure from the home folks.\" Buchanan said that the Alabama congressmen had \"nodded their heads 'yes' when the Kennedys asked them to, and have come back home and denied they were national Democrats.\"\nPresident Kennedy's role in the 1962 mid-term elections was overshadowed by the Cuban Missile Crisis. Martin joined Hill in endorsing the quarantine of Cuba but insisted that the problem was an outgrowth of the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion of 1961. Hill said that Soviet premier, Nikita S. Khrushchev, had \"chickened out\" because \"the one thing the communists respect is strength.\" \"The New York Times\" speculated that the blockade ordered by Kennedy may have spared Hill from defeat. Despite the postwar bipartisan consensus for foreign aid, Martin hammered away at Hill's backing for such programs. He decried subsidies to foreign manufacturers and workers at the expense of Alabama's then large force of textile workers: \"These foreign giveaways have cost taxpayers billions of dollars and turned many areas of Alabama into distressed areas.\" Martin also condemned aid to communist countries and the impact of the United Nations on national policy. He questioned Hill's congressional seniority as of little use when troops were dispatched to Ole Miss.\nMartin's campaign enabled the GOP to conduct an educational mission for the two-party system. \"If we show strength in Alabama and other southern states, we will help to name the Republican candidate for the presidency in 1964,\" Martin predicted, claiming that the nominee would look favorably on the South. The \"Mobile Register\" endorsed the two-party format to stimulate the spread of ideas and to improve government: \"It takes only an unprejudiced attitude to recognize the potentialities ... from two-party political vigor.\" \"The Huntsville Times\" noted with amusement that voting for a Republican in Alabama could \"constitute a crime or start convolutions in ancestral graves. ... [one can] hardly pick up a cup of coffee ... without hearing grumbling around the table about Bobby Kennedy's interference in the South ... or the need to kick the Reds out of Cuba. ... But vote Republican? That is another thing.\" Though it editorialized for a two-party system in theory, \"The Huntsville Times\" endorsed Lister Hill. The newspaper conceded that Martin had defended states rights but noted that three key New York liberal Republicans, Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller and Senators Kenneth B. Keating and Jacob Javits, were hostile to \"limited government\" and \"local autonomy.\" The publication urged the Republicans to hold primary elections in 1964 and field a full slate, rather than singling out one contest, as they had done in 1962.\nRepublican prospects were dampened by the Alabama legislature's implementation of the \"vote-for-eight\" requirement for the then at-large U.S. House races. Because the GOP offered only three House candidates, the Republicans either had to back five Democrats or to write-in other names on the ballot. GOP chairman John Grenier of Birmingham, who would emerge with Martin as a key figure and even an intraparty rival in their party's resurgence, denounced the \"vote-for-eight\" clause, which was upheld by the Alabama Supreme Court as a prohibition against \"complete freedom of choice.\" Republicans hence had to dilute the strength of their nominees by being compelled to support five other candidates. After 1962, \"vote-for-eight\" was struck down by the United States Supreme Court, which required single-member House districts.\nMartin employed Country music bands to stir up enthusiasm and plastered the state with billboards which omitted his party affiliation. His failure to identify himself as a Republican in his advertising seemed to contradict the mission of his candidacy. The discrepancy prompted Hill to denounce \"glorified pawn brokers ... ashamed to admit that they're running as Republicans.\" Because Alabama then had no significant GOP base, Martin sought to appeal to Independents and the more conservative Democrats\nThe Hill-Martin race drew considerable national attention. The liberal columnist Drew Pearson wrote from Decatur, Alabama, that \"for the first time since Reconstruction, the two-party system, which political scientists talk about for the South, but never expect to materialize, may come to Alabama.\" \"The New York Times\" viewed the Alabama race as the most vigorous off-year effort in modern southern history but predicted a Hill victory on the basis that Martin had failed to gauge \"bread-and-butter\" issues and was viewed as an \"ultraconservative.\"\n\nMartin lost by 6,019 votes, having polled 195,134 ballots (49.1 percent) to Hill's 201,937 (50.9 percent). Turnout dropped sharply in 1962, compared to 1960, when presidential electors dominated the ballot, and the state split between Kennedy-Johnson and unpledged electors who ultimately voted for U.S. Senator Harry F. Byrd, Sr., of Virginia. Republican Julian E. Elgin of Montgomery had received 164,868 votes (29.8 percent) in his challenge to the Democrat John Sparkman, who had in 1952 been Adlai E. Stevenson's vice-presidential choice and hence slated opposite Richard M. Nixon. Elgin and Sparkman had polled a combined 647,006 ballots, compared to the Hill-Martin total of 397,071. Hence nearly 250,000 who had voted for the Senate in 1960, a presidential election year, did not do so in the mid-term race in 1962. Oddly, Martin polled only 30,266 more votes than had Elgin, but the Republican share of the vote was 19.3 points higher than in 1960 because of lower turnout in the latter year. More than a third of Alabama Democrats who participated in the primary in May did not vote in the 1962 general election. The stable support given Elgin and Martin indicated the development of a constituency for any statewide Republican candidate in Alabama. Richard Nixon had received 41.7 percent of the vote in Alabama in 1960.\nMartin obtained majorities in thirty of the sixty-seven counties and carried two of the largest, Jefferson and Montgomery by sixteen percentage points. He swept Hill's home county of Montgomery and George Wallace's Barbour County, but he lost his own Etowah County, which includes Gadsden. Hill's plurality in Etowah County represented one-third of his statewide margin. Martin polled more than 70 percent in three counties, Choctaw, Marengo, and Houston. His weakest winning county was Mobile, where he was held to 52.1 percent. He won 57.9 percent in the \"Free State of Winston,\" the state's most traditionally GOP turf.\nIn the U.S. House races, John Buchanan chalked up the best showing of the three Republicans running, but his 141,202 votes statewide were insufficient to dislodge the incumbent Democrat Carl Elliott of Jasper. \"The Mobile Register\" theorized that the prestige of the Hill-Burton Act had spared the veteran Democrat from defeat. The real surprise, the newspaper wrote, is not that Hill prevailed but that his margin was so thin. Three Republicans were elected to the Alabama House of Representatives in the 1962 general election, all serving one term: Tandy Little of Montgomery, Donald Lamar Collins (1929-1993) of Birmingham, and John Andrew Posey, Jr. (born 1923), of Winston County.\nPolitical scientist Walter Dean Burnham determined the Martin campaign to be an aberration from the customary issueless, personalist southern primary elections. The Martin campaign was a pacesetter for subsequent southern election in that it was waged over national issues—mobilizing the white backlash against civil rights; stressing what he saw as \"free enterprise,\" \"local control,\" and \"individual freedom\"; decrying federal spending programs; shifting emphasis from opposition to desegregation to the preservation of \"states rights.\" Burnham noted the irony of a Republican from the populist North Alabama running strongly in the cities and Black Belt, while the Democratic senator from Montgomery appealed to the northern hill country, where voters appreciated programs like the TVA and were less racially conscious because of the relatively small number of African Americans in their region. Martin fared best in those counties with non-voting blacks, prior to passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. All but one of the fifteen counties which showed a decline in the Republican vote between 1960 and 1962 were in the Appalachian section of North Alabama. Martin's showing along the Gulf Coast and the Florida panhandle was paradoxical in that the southeast had been traditionally the most populist since the 1890s. Two years after the Hill-Martin race, Burnham correctly forecast that the inroads of presidential Republicanism would continue in the South, but competition at the state and local levels would take root slowly.\nThe Hill-Martin race resembled Democratic factional contests in that it divided along class lines, with wealthier Alabamians voting Republican. One analyst joked that though \"Martin was a segregationist, it is hard for a rich man's segregationist to defeat a poor man's segregationist.\" At a news conference in Washington, D.C., Martin blamed his loss in part on the failure of the chairman of the Republican National Committee, William E. Miller, a New York congressman who two years later would become Barry M. Goldwater's vice-presidential running mate, to commit funds to Alabama. According to Martin, Miller was unaware in 1962 that Alabama \"was ready to vote Republican.\" Alabama Democratic chairman Roy Mayhall expressed fear that Martin's strong showing could \"make Alabama a future Republican state,\" a scenario which did take shape some thirty years later. Martin's candidacy rekindled demands that Alabama drop its open primary for a closed nominating contest, register voters by party, and enforce partisan loyalty oaths, but as Martin's showing soon proved by 1966 to have been fleeting, the Democrats resumed their complacency and retained primaries without partisan registration.\nThe GOP claimed that Hill's victory stemmed from \"irregularities\" involving tossed-out paper ballots, and Martin hence declined to issue a formal concession. In February 1963, the Senate Subcommittee on Privileges and Election rejected Martin's petition to investigate the election. The panel concluded on a party-line vote that even if allegations of discarded ballots were valid, the number involved was insufficient to alter the outcome. \nThe prestige that Martin gained from his campaign brought requests to address Republican gatherings in the South. In February 1964, he joined Grenier, a New Orleans, Louisiana, native, at a fund-raising dinner in Shreveport for oilman Charlton Lyons, the first Republican to wage an active bid for the Louisiana governorship in the 20th century. Martin's claim that a Republican governor would provide regular inter-party competition proved premature. Numerous Republicans who won southern governorships after 1966, including Winthrop Rockefeller in Arkansas and Claude R. Kirk, Jr., in Florida lost reelection bids, and none established GOP majorities of significant duration in their legislatures. However, by 2011, all southern state legislatures except in Arkansas had Republican majorities. \nMartin told Governor Ross Barnett of Mississippi that he too would fight desegregaton of schools, neighborhoods, and unions. Subsequently, however, Martin denied having injected race in his campaign, having instead stressed \"states rights\" and \"constitutional government,\" terms which some African Americans view as \"code words\" for segregation.\n\nIn 1964, Alabama Republicans stood to benefit from the unintended consequences of two developments: (1) Governor Wallace vacating the race for the Democratic presidential nomination against President Johnson, and (2) the designation of unpledged Democratic electors in Alabama, in effect removing Johnson from the general election ballot. Prior to the 1964 Republican National Convention in San Francisco, Martin met with Wallace and two gubernatorial aides, Bill Jones and Seymore Trammell in the Jefferson Davis Hotel in Montgomery. Wallace asked Martin to determine if Barry Goldwater, the forthcoming GOP presidential nominee who as a senator from Arizona had voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1964 on libertarian and constitutional grounds, would advocate repeal of the law, particularly the public accommodations and employment sections. Bill Jones indicated that Wallace agreed with Goldwater's anti-communist stance but opposed the Republican's proposal to make Social Security \"voluntary.\" Jones stressed that Wallace had sacrificed his own presidential aspirations that year to allow a direct GOP challenge to President Johnson. It was later disclosed that during the meeting with Martin, Wallace proposed to become a Republican if he could be named as Goldwater's running mate, a designation which later was given to Congressman William E. Miller of New York. Goldwater reportedly rejected the overture because of Wallace's adverse image outside the Deep South.\nThe unpledged electors in Alabama included the future U.S. senator, James B. Allen, then the lieutenant governor, and the later governor Albert P. Brewer. National Democrats balked over Johnson's exclusion from the ballot but most supported the unpledged slate, which competed directly with the Republican electors. As \"The Tuscaloosa News\" explained, loyalist electors would have offered a clearer choice to voters than did the unpledged slate.\n\"The Birmingham News\" columnist Walling Keith wrote that while voters might \"leave the Democratic Party -- at least for an election -- most of them really would not be too happy in the Republican Party.\" Along with the GOP victory in Alabama at the presidential level, the first in state history since Reconstruction, Martin and four other Republicans were elected to the U.S. House in the heavily liberal 89th Congress. Joining Martin in victory were William Jackson \"Jack\" Edwards of Mobile County, John Buchanan, the defeated 1962 candidate from Birmingham, William Louis Dickinson of Montgomery, a former Democratic judge in Lee County, and Arthur Glenn Andrews, the Republican chairman in Talladega County. \nThe Democrat whom Martin defeated was George C. Hawkins, also from Gadsden and the Alabama State Senate President Pro Tem. Martin had polled only 42.9 percent in the Seventh District in the 1962 Senate race. Including Jasper and Huntsville, as well as Martin's Gadsden, the Seventh (now the Fifth District) is diversified—steel and rubber mills, farm machinery, electronics, military and space installations, poultry, livestock, cotton, and some coal mining. At the time the Seventh contained the state's smallest black population—7.7 percent—Martin did not benefit in 1964 from racial backlash as he had running statewide in 1962. He had expressed a greater interest in Goldwater's success than he had in his own election to the House.\nSome backers of unsuccessful gubernatorial candidate Congressman Carl Elliott threatened to withhold votes from Hawkins or even to vote for Martin on the theory that Elliott might be able to reclaim the seat in 1966 from a Republican but would not oppose a fellow Democrat. In his campaign against Hawkins, Martin hammered at the national vice presidential nominee Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota, who was the Senate floor leader for the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which Martin claimed had \"paved the way for the destruction of our liberties.\" Martin's opposition to the civil rights measure paralleled the views of Alabama's twenty pro-Goldwater national convention delegates, who declared the measure an affront to \"personal freedom of choice in association and employment.\"\nSeveral of the Alabama Republican representatives made national headlines in 1965 when they denounced the voting-rights march led by Martin Luther King, Jr., from Selma to Montgomery. Though King's contributions to desegregation were subsequently commemorated through a national holiday, Martin called King a \"rabble-rouser who has put on the sheep's clothing of non-violence while he pits race against race, man against law, and whose actions have repeatedly resulted in violence, injury, and death.\" Martin claimed that King had authorized the printing of stationery which listed King's address as the Selma jail even before King's arrest: \"King reached Selma with intentions of breaking the law so that he could be arrested. His love of publicity is above the sacredness of the laws.\"\n\nWith promising prospects for continued growth, the Alabama GOP adopted a 1965 budget of $200,000 and proposed to offer a hundred candidates in hopes of winning a third of the seats in both houses of the Alabama legislature. Amid optimism, John Grenier left the chairmanship to prepare to run for governor. He later said that he considered the governorship out of reach in 1966, but he wanted to lay a base for the future. Grenier epitomized his party's \"new breed\" of leadership, which stressed political philosophy over patronage and appealed to business executives, lawyers, and other possessors of wealth. The revived Alabama GOP was a product of urbanization and industrialization. Samuel DuBois Cook, a political scientist who served as president of historically black Dillard University of New Orleans, pointed to the paradox of southern Republicans, then the most conservative in the political arena, who were nevertheless a \"product of revolutionary industrial and technical change.\"\nWith Grenier in the governor's race, Martin was initially poised to oppose John Sparkman, but \"The New York Times\" predicted that toppling the \"tight one-party oligarchy\" would be a herculean task. Though Sparkman trailed in some polls, \"The Times\" speculated that he would rebound because Alabamians were so accustomed to voting straight Democratic tickets. Several months later Martin made a crucial decision to run for governor, instead of the Senate, and Grenier also switched races in the process. The changed plans created friction between the two men that persisted for years afterwards.\nMartin's opponent was initially uncertain, but it soon became apparent that he would face Lurleen Wallace, a former dime-store clerk of considerable charm and grace. What remained in doubt was whether she would be governor in her own right or a \"caretaker\" with her husband as a \"dollar-a-year-advisor\" making all the major decisions. The decision to run Mrs. Wallace crippled the Alabama GOP. Nearly overnight its fortunes vanished, for most expected George Wallace to succeed in nominating and electing his wife, who conveniently was running not as the former \"Lurleen Burns\" but as \"Mrs. George C. Wallace.\" \nLurleen Wallace dispatched a primary field that included two former governors, John Malcolm Patterson and James E. Folsom, Sr., Congressman Carl Elliott, and Attorney General Richmond Flowers. Neither Martin nor Mrs. Wallace sought support from the increasing number of African American voters, many of whom had been energized since passage a year earlier of the Voting Rights Act, following the impact of the Selma-to-Montgomery march. False reports of Republican strength in Alabama abounded. \"The New York Times\" predicted that Martin \"not only has a chance to win the governorship, but at least for the moment must be rated as the favorite.\"\nPolitical writer Theodore H. White incorrectly predicted that Alabama, instead of Arkansas and Florida as it developed, would in 1966 become the first former Confederate state to elect a Republican governor since Reconstruction. A consensus developed that Martin might lend coattails to Republican candidates in legislative, county, and municipal elections. The defections of three legislators and a member of the Democratic State Executive Committee reinforced such possibilities. \"The New York Times\" explained that Alabama Democrats had denounced the national party for so long that it was \"no longer popular in many quarters to be a Democrat.\" Martin claimed that the South must \"break away from the one-party system just as we broke away from a one-crop economy.\" He vowed to make Alabama \"first in opportunity, jobs, and education.\" Keener insight at the time would have revealed that Martin was pursuing the one office essentially off limits to the GOP that year. No Republican had served as governor since David Peter Lewis left office in 1874, and George Wallace's organization was insurmountable despite an early poll that placed Martin within range of victory.\n\nThough the Republicans sought to downplay the racial question, Governor Wallace kept the issue alive when he signed state legislation to nullify desegregation guidelines between Alabama cities and counties and the former United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. Wallace claimed that the law would thwart the national government from intervening in schools. Critics denounced Wallace's \"political trickery\" and expressed alarm at the potential forfeiture of federal funds. Martin accused the Democrats of \"playing politics with your children\" and \"neglecting academic excellence.\"\nMartin also opposed the desegregation guidelines and had sponsored a House amendment to forbid the placement of students and teachers on the basis of racial quotas. He predicted that Wallace's legislation would propel the issuance of a court order compelling immediate and total desegregaton in all public schools. Martin compared the new law to \"another two-and-a-half minute stand in the schoolhouse door while the whole state suffers,\" referring to Wallace's 1963 stance at the University of Alabama.\nGeorge Wallace, who did the majority of the campaigning for his wife, blasted the Eisenhower-Nixon administration in regard to the 1957 desegregation showdown in Little Rock. Martin discussed political developments with Eisenhower at the former president's farm in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, and reported that Eisenhower told him that troops were dispatched after the Democratic mayor of Little Rock, Woodrow Wilson Mann, voiced fear of an insurrection. Martin said that Eisenhower \"had no alternative but to send in troops.\"\nMartin urged that President Lyndon B. Johnson remove national education commissioner Harold Howe, II, and proposed that Wallace and Alabama Education Superintendent Austin R. Meadows travel to Washington to challenge the guidelines in a bipartisan fashion. Meadows retorted to Martin to \"let Jacob Javits handle it,\" a reference to the New York liberal Republican U.S. senator. Wallace's anti-guidelines law was subsequently struck down, and Alabama was placed under a federal court order to abolish its dual school system.\nJournalist Pat Watters contended that Wallace's actions inadvertently compelled the national government to \"act and did more to advance Negro causes than the most fervent civil rights advocate\" could have realized. Syndicated columnist Holmes Alexander observed Wallace greeting a black family in a restaurant, a gesture which at that time most other southern politicians would have avoided.\n\nMartin proclaimed that Lurleen Wallace was a \"proxy\" candidate, a manifestation of her husband's \"insatiable appetite for power.\" Mrs. Wallace used the slogan \"Two Governors, One Cause\" and proclaimed the words \"Alabama\" and \"freedom\" to be synonyms. Martin bemoaned having to campaign against a woman, a position that would soon become anachronistic. Though he was running for state office, Martin focused much attention on President Johnson, unpopular with many in Alabama because of the Vietnam War, inflation and urban unrest. \"We want to see this war ended, and it's going to take a change of administration to do it,\" Martin said. At the state level, Martin questioned a $500,000 school book depository contract awarded to Wallace supporter Elton B. Stephens of Ebsco Investment Company. Martin challenged \"secret deals\" regarding the construction of highways or schools\" and \"conspiracies between the state house and the White House.\" \nAt her general election campaign kickoff in Birmingham, Lurleen Wallace pledged \"progress without compromise\" and \"accomplishment without surrender ... George will continue to speak up and stand up for Alabama.\" She continued: \"Contrary to what the liberals preach, progress can be made without sacrificing the free enterprise system and ... the Constitution.\" It was during this 1966 campaign that Wallace coined his line: \"There's not a dime's worth of difference\" between the two national parties. Wallace likened such Republicans as the then House Minority Leader Gerald R. Ford, Jr., later the president from 1974 to 1977, and Chief Justice Earl Warren, who supported civil rights legislation, to \"vultures\" who presided over the destruction of the U.S. Constitution.\nIn plugging for two-party politics, Martin claimed that the only way to unseat President Johnson was for Alabama and the South to become \"strongly conservative Republican states.\" One of Martin's slogans read: \"Beat LBJ the Jim Martin Way.\" Wallace's memoirs merely mention Martin as \"the strongest Republican candidate in many years.\" The Wallaces had little need to campaign, as hardly anyone could out-fox Wallace in the then \"popular sport of LBJ-cussin'\". \nMartin did not receive all of the anti-Wallace vote by default. Some liberals coalesced behind the Independent candidate Carl Ray Robinson, a physician and lawyer from Bessemer. Robinson claimed that Wallace had so perverted the Democratic label that Martin, rather than James B. Allen, could be the Democratic lieutenant governor nominee. Robinson filed a $5 million slander suit against Martin after the Republican alleged that Wallace was subsidizing the Robinson campaign in order to split the opposition. Martin dismissed the suit as \"something the Democrats have cooked up\" and questioned how it could be slanderous to say that \"one Democrat supports another.\"\nFormer Senator Barry Goldwater and sitting Senator Strom Thurmond campaigned on behalf of Martin and Senate candidate John Grenier. Thurmond, who had carried Alabama in 1948 as the nominee of the Dixiecrats addressed an all-white GOP state convention, where he denounced the national Democratic leadership as \"the most dangerous people in the country\" and urged a \"return to constitutional government.\" George Wallace was so irritated over Goldwater's appearance on Martin's behalf that he questioned why Goldwater could win only six states in his 1964 race against Johnson. \"Where were the Republicans when I was fighting LBJ?\" Wallace asked. Goldwater shunned personal criticism of Wallace but repudiated Wallace's talk of a third party in the 1968 presidential election.\n\nJim Martin and John Grenier initially planned a Goldwater-style campaign, but when polls showed certain victory for Lurleen Wallace, Grenier tried to steer independently of Martin. He spoke warmly of the Wallaces and urged conservative Democrats to reject Senator Sparkman's reelection bid: \"there are deep differences between John Sparkman and George Wallace.\" Sparkman's hometown daily, \"The Huntsville Times\", questioned Grenier's attempt to attach himself to the Wallace coattails\" even while Grenier affirmed backing for Martin. Grenier's attempt to court Wallace voters drew the private outrage of Martin. The liberal Republican Ripon Society termed the Grenier campaign \"an echo of Democratic racism.\" The tensions between Martin and Grenier accelerated. When Martin leaders asked to switch races again with Grenier, the Senate nominee flatly refused.\nPerry O. Hooper, Sr., a former probate and circuit judge from Montgomery and later the first Republican elected to the Alabama Supreme Court, reflected on the Martin-Grenier rivalry, having noted that Martin defeated Grenier in 1968 in a race for Republican national committeeman, a position that Hooper himself subsequently held:\n\nThe year 1966 was a disaster...nobody could imagine a governor's wife running for office and winning. I began to realize it in January, but nobody else seemed to understand. Once we made that mistake, it was all downhill [for Republicans]. It was felt that if we were going to really build a party we needed a governor, and Jim Martin was a hot item. He wanted to switch over to the senatorial nomination, but he wouldn't take a leadership position and let it be known... He hoped the convention would take over, but John Grenier was too well organized to make the switch. Neither Martin nor Grenier has ever gotten over the 1966 races. Martin ran against Grenier to serve on the national committee in 1968 and blew him away. Hopefully, a lot of these things are in the past. All we can do is learn from 1966. \nDespite the odds against him, Martin campaigned to the finish, buoyed by seven newspaper endorsements and a straw poll at Auburn University. Four days before the election, Martin's \"Victory Special\" whistle-stop tour, conceived by the candidate's 83-year-old father, began in Mobile and rolled northward through nearly fifty towns and cities in thirty-two counties. A few candidates joined Martin, but there was no united effort, and the national GOP declined to give Martin financial assistance. Martin called the Wallace administration the \"Little Society,\" a play on President Johnson's Great Society social programs. He even equated 1960s Republicanism to the philosophy of Jefferson Davis, who in 1861 had assumed the Confederate presidency in Montgomery.\n\nUltimately, Martin and Grenier each carried only one county, Winston County, where many were descendants of nonslaveholders who had remained loyal to the Union in the Civil War. Martin also polled a six-vote plurality in Greene County. His 262,943 votes (31 percent) were less than half of Lurleen Wallace's 537,505 ballots (63.4 percent). Robinson received 47,655 (5.6 percent). Grenier ran eight percentage points ahead of Martin because he received 50,075 more votes than Martin, and 45,503 fewer ballots were cast in the Senate race than in the gubernatorial contest. \"The Montgomery Advertiser\" summed up the results: the flimsy house that Barry [Goldwater] built collapsed, except for a few boards here and there... The Republicans have little more than the bare foundation of a party.\" However, three incumbent Republican congressmen, Jack Edwards, William Dickinson, and John Buchanan, survived their party's 1966 statewide defeat. The Democrat William Flynt Nichols handily unseated Republican U.S. Representative Glenn Andrews, and Martin's 7th District House seat also returned to Democratic hands with the victory of Tom Bevill. The four seats in the Alabama House of Representatives held by Tandy Little, Alfred Goldthwaite of Montgomery (who had switched parties in 1964), Donald Lamar Collins, and John Andrew Posey, Jr. (born 1923) of Winston County, were all lost in the Democratic tide in 1966.\nNeither Martin nor Lurleen Wallace had specifically solicited African American support, and the black leadership took no position on the race. \"The Huntsville Times\" determined that Mrs. Wallace polled a majority in predominantly black precincts in Anniston, Birmingham, and the Black Belt. Numan V. Bartley and Hugh D. Graham concluded that she received 65 percent in black majority precincts in Montgomery, where Martin and Robinson trailed with 23 and 13 percent. In black majority precincts in Birmingham, Mrs. Wallace took only 31 percent, whereas Martin and Robinson polled 35 and 34 percent, respectively. Sparkman easily carried those same precincts with more than 80 percent of the ballots over John Grenier. Martin ran ahead of Grenier among wealthier and white collar whites but lagged behind his ticket-mate with blue collar and lower-middle-income voters. Upper-class whites were the single demographic group that supported Martin, with a 53 percent majority. Grenier polled 46 percent from that same bloc.\n\nIn 1968, Martin defeated Grenier in an intra-party contest for Republican National Committeeman from Alabama.\n\nSix years after his gubernatorial defeat, Jim Martin announced he would seek the Republican nomination to challenge Senator John Sparkman, as he had considered in 1966. The GOP choice, however, fell on Winton M. Blount a wealthy contractor from Montgomery, who had been the last Postmaster General, serving under President Nixon, before the post was removed from the Cabinet. Perry Hooper recalled that Martin was not opposed to Blount but merely wanted himself to run against Sparkman. In the first GOP statewide primary, Blount defeated Martin, 27,736 to 16,800, and 6,674 for two other candidates. Martin carried fifteen counties in the primary; 30 percent of the ballots were cast in Jefferson County alone. A third candidate who fell far behind in the tabulation was State Representative Bert Nettles of Mobile, who carried the endorsement of \"The Tuscaloosa News\". Nettles was the author of the legislation that authorized this first ever taxpayer-funded Republican primary in Alabama history.\n\nBlount was handily defeated by Sparkman in the fall of 1972; so long as George Wallace remained the dominant political power in Alabama, particularly after the ban on consecutive gubernatorial reelection was lifted in 1974, the GOP faced few prospects of a breakthrough.\n\nIn 1978, Martin again announced his candidacy for the U.S. Senate. He first intended to challenge the Democratic nominee Howell T. Heflin of Tuscumbia, a nephew of the legendary white supremacist Tom Heflin. Howell Heflin won the Democratic nomination to succeed the finally retiring John Sparkman by defeating U.S. Representative Walter Flowers, a long-time George Wallace ally. However, Martin switched to a second Senate race for a two-year term created by the death of Senator James Allen. Allen's widow, Maryon Pittman Allen, lost the Democratic nomination for her husband's remaining two years in office to State Sen. Donald W. Stewart of Anniston, a favorite of organized labor. Martin therefore would face Stewart in the November general election. For the change to occur, George W. Nichols, who had handily defeated Elvin McCary of Anniston in the special senatorial primary, had to step down from the nomination. Martin's change in races recalled his own belated attempt in 1966 to switch positions with John Grenier. He did not expect the change in Senate races to be an issue in 1978 because Stewart himself had first announced for the six-year term and then switched to the two-year vacancy.\nDemocratic State Chairman George Bailes of Birmingham belittled \"Switchback Martin\" for a \"flim-flam on the electorate.\" Howell Heflin himself ridiculed Martin as the \"Harold Stassen of Alabama,\" a reference to the former governor of Minnesota who for years pursued a vain quest for the Republican presidential nomination. A large number of prominent Republicans came to Alabama to support Martin, including former President Ford, future Presidents Reagan and George Herbert Walker Bush, U.S. Representative Jack Kemp, and Senators Goldwater, Robert J. Dole of Kansas, Harrison Schmitt of New Mexico, and S.I. Hayakawa of California. Martin benefited from the change in races because he could legally receive contributions for both the six-year and the two-year contests. The national GOP, which had spurned him financially in 1966, filled his coffers in 1978 with $230,000.\nStewart criticized Martin's use of surrogate speakers, but he brought in U.S. Senator Russell B. Long of Louisiana and the actor Gregory Peck. He challenged Martin's attendance record in the House from 1965 to 1966, when he was often in Alabama tending to political chores. With considerable effectiveness, Stewart said that Martin \"had done nothing but run for office, and he did not stay there and represent the people the one time he was in office.\" Stewart further claimed that Martin had misapplied the \"liberal\" label in politics, having used it not only against Stewart but to hammer Lurleen Wallace in 1966 and even fellow Republican Winton Blount in 1972. Blount still donated $4,000 to the 1978 Martin campaign.\nMartin questioned Stewart's position on the right-to-work provision of the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947. Stewart insisted that his pro-labor record did not include opposition to right-to-work. Working against Stewart was the disclosure that he had undergone treatment for a \"nervous breakdown\" in 1958, when he was eighteen years old. That issue reappeared in 1980, when Stewart lost renomination to James Folsom, Jr., a future lieutenant governor and governor.\nMartin finished the race with 316,170 votes (44 percent) to Stewart's 401,852 (56 percent). The Republican won seven counties: Winston, Montgomery, Baldwin, Houston, Shelby, Cullman, and Mobile. Martin lost populous Jefferson County by twenty-seven votes.\n\nThroughout his political career, Martin had continued to work in the petroleum industry. In 1987, Guy Hunt, the first Republican governor of Alabama since Reconstruction, appointed Martin commissioner of the Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, a position which he held until Hunt was forced from office in 1993.\nJournalist Ray Jenkins of the \"Montgomery Advertiser\" recalled Martin as having been\n\nin the vanguard of what promised to be a period of profound political change. Then something dreadful happened to the Republicans on the way to 1966. They picked a fight with George Wallace. The bubble burst and once again the Republicans were relegated to their humble status as a mere facade of patronage...Martin came out of political isolation [in 1978] to spread the faith yet once again, even though the odds were clearly against him... When told by friends he should become a Democrat, Martin said \"If ever there is to be a healthy two-party system in Alabama, someone must keep the faith, someone must keep principle above self interest.\"...\nPerry Hooper, however, disputes Jenkins' analysis. The retired judge said that Wallace may have inadvertently aided the Republican Party by fostering opposition to the national Democrats within Alabama. Hooper said that he had, despite their partisan difference, \"always gotten along quite well\" with Wallace, whom he remembers as \"a southern gentleman who likes people, and it shows.\" To Hooper, the difficulty of establishing the two-party system came from within the Republican Party itself. Jim Martin, he said, was the party's \"finest candidate\" but \"time just slipped by, and it's difficult to overcome problems like we had in 1966.\"\n\nMartin last ran as a candidate in 1994, when at the age of seventy-six he failed in a Republican bid for state treasurer. Soon he was involved in a suit with Perry Hooper so that the jurist could claim the Chief Justice position to which he was elected that same year. \nThe James D. Martin Wildlife Park at U.S. Highway 411 in Gadsden is named in his honor.\n\nMartin died at his home in Gadsden, Alabama on October 30, 2017, aged 99.\n\n"}
{"id": "1874631", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1874631", "title": "CJTK-FM", "text": "CJTK-FM\n\nCJTK-FM is a Canadian radio station, which airs Christian music and programming at 95.5 FM in Sudbury, Ontario. The station is owned by Eternacom, and was licensed by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) in 1997. The station is branded as \"KFM\" and uses one of the current slogans as \"Today's Christian radio\", \"Northern Ontario's Christian Radio\", \"Music You Can Believe In\" and \"Christian Radio for Life\".\n\nOn June 6, 1997, Curtis Belcher, the owner of Enternacom Inc., received CRTC approval to operate a new Christian music radio station in Sudbury and began broadcasting later that same year.\n\nCJTK-FM started as a small low-power 35 watt FM radio station in Sudbury at 95.5 FM in late 1997, which CJTK became the first Christian station to be granted a power increase, and go from low-power status (35 watts), to a full power (1,400 watts).\n\nIn 2000, the station received approval to add an FM rebroadcaster at North Bay to operate on the frequency, 89.5 MHz. In 2005, CJTK-FM applied to change North Bay's frequency from 89.5 to 107.3 FM, although when the application was approved, the station would operate at 103.5 MHz instead. Once the change took place, the CJTK-FM-1 operating at 89.5 was deleted. On December 5, 2005, CJTK received approval to add a rebroadcaster at Little Current on the frequency, 102.1 MHz and began broadcasting in September 2006. A repeater was also added in Elliot Lake on 102.5 MHz in 2008.\n\nThe Canadian Communications Foundation website reports that in 2007, Eternacom received approval to change the authorized contours of CJTK-FM by increasing effective radiated power from 1,400 watts to 8,100 watts. It's uncertain if there's any CRTC decision references regarding the power increase to 8.1 kW.\nIn 2009, CJTK adopted its current logo and branding as \"KFM\". Both the current and the former logo are still used on CJTK's website. The station's former brandings were known as \"K95.5\", or just simply the \"K\" and was also used on CJTK's other repeaters.\n\nCJTK will be the new play-by-play voice of the Sudbury Wolves for the upcoming 2009-2010 Ontario Hockey League season. The Sudbury Wolves games were formerly aired on CIGM.\n\nOn October 11, 2011, Eternacom Inc. applied to add a new low-power FM transmitter in Mattawa, Ontario, which will rebroadcast the programming of CJTK-FM-1 North Bay. The proposed new FM transmitter was approved on December 6, 2011 and will operate in Mattawa at 93.9 MHz. This will be Mattawa's first local FM signal in that community.\n\nOn March 30, 2015, the CRTC approved Eternacom's application to add an FM transmitter at Timmins, which will rebroadcast CJTK-FM on 105.5 MHz.\n\nOn August 16, 2018, the Commission approved an application by Eternacom Inc. (Eternacom), on behalf of Harvest Ministries Sudbury, for authority to acquire from Eternacom the assets of the English-language commercial specialty (Christian music) radio stations CJTK-FM Sudbury, CJTK FM-1 North Bay and CJTK-FM-3 Elliot Lake, Ontario, and their rebroadcasting transmitters and for broadcasting licences to continue the operation of the stations.\n\nIn 2001, Eternacom launched a sister station, CKBB-FM, airing tourist information programming at 102.9 FM in Sudbury. The station was branded as \"STIR\" Sudbury's Tourism and Information Radio. CKBB-FM went dark in 2005. Despite the station ceasing operations, on June 5, 2006 the CRTC renewed CKBB-FM's licence from September 1, 2006 to August 31, 2013, although the station never actually relaunched. \n\nThe rebroadcaster in North Bay airs its own separate morning program, but simulcasts the Sudbury station the rest of the time. Eternacom also has a rebroadcaster at Elliot Lake, which also offers some local programming.\n\nOn January 5 and 6, 2017, Eternacom Inc, applied to add six new FM transmitters to rebroadcast CJTK-FM to the following communities.\n\n\nEternacom received approval to add the new FM transmitters on June 19, 2017. Most of these new transmitters had already signed on the air in late 2017 and 2018. Eternacom, the owners of CJTK-FM plans to expand up to 20 stations by 2020.\n\nOn May 22, 2019, Harvest Ministries Sudbury applied to add a new FM transmitter to rebroadcast CJTK-FM at Kapuskasing on the frequency of 88.5 MHz. This application was approved by the CRTC on September 4, 2019.\n\n\n"}

It was published the same year as the Redwall book (his more known fantasy series) \"Rakkety Tam\". There are six tales in this book, all of them like the tales in \"Seven Strange and Ghostly Tales\", by the same author. The titles are: \"The Ribbajack\", \"A Smile and a Wave\", \"The All Ireland Champion Versus the Nye Add\", \"The Mystery of Huma D'Este\", \"Miggy Mags and the Malabar Sailor\", and \"Rosie's Pet.\"\n\nThe \"Ribba Jack\" is also an ancient term for a physical appearance of ones worst fear. The Ribbajack (in the story) is a grotesque animal that is summoned by a person's anger to kill another.\n\nArchibald Smifft, who lives at a boarding school, torments anyone he can find with insults and the like. The matron and headmaster discover his practices of dark magic, and decide that something must be done. One day, when an old army veteran comes to lecture him about his horrible behavior, he is extremely displeased and searches for something to take revenge. Just then, the two boys that share his dormitory come in and one accidentally lets slip that he possesses a letter containing information on the Ribbajack. Archibald snatches the letter at once and attempts to conjure his own Ribbajack to destroy the man who lectured him - and succeeds. Fortunately for the monster's intended victim, the medal that he is wearing at the time, gifted to him by an Indian fakir, is enchanted to drive away Ribbajacks and turn them on their creators - thus, Archibald Smifft is gone from the boarding school forever.\n\nMaggie would like to go to the ice-skating rink, but she must bring her coat with her if she is to go. The only problem is that she deliberately left the coat at school because of her dislike of it. Her mother orders her to go back to the school to retrieve the coat, despite Maggie's protests that the school is locked at night. Reluctantly, Maggie revisits the school and finds her coat but comes upon a ghost of a girl holding a rose. The girl's face frightens Maggie enough to put on her coat and flee the school. Later, a school official finds some information in a book concerning the name of the school, the Leah Edwina Tranter School. Leah was a lonely girl with wealthy parents who did not spend much time with her. When she was fourteen years old, she disappeared and later turned up dead concealed behind a bookcase and holding a rose in one hand. Her father was devastated and sank into depression. His wife left him. Much later, he wrote in his will that a school was to be built on the site of his home, and that it was to be named the Leah Edwina Tranter School.\n\nRoddy Mooney is extremely good at fishing; thus, he is the All Ireland Champion Fisherman, but he is lazy and does not help his mother to take care of the house and themselves (he lives with his mother). One day, he crosses paths with young Mickey Hennessy, who declares that he intends to catch a Nye Add. Roddy finds out about Nye Adds from Mickey; they are mermaids. Roddy pretends that he does not believe Mickey, but goes home to get his fishing supplies and catch the Nye Add that Mickey claims he saw earlier (although Roddy believes it is a huge fish because he and Mickey saw the Nye Add's tail). Roddy hooks something large and attempts to reel it in, but the thing on the other end of the line pulls back and Roddy falls into the water - it's a Nye Add! Soon after, the Nye Add's mother shoves Roddy back up to the surface and scolds her daughter severely. Roddy is never the same again after his encounter with the Nye Add. The narrator reveals that Mickey goes down to the riverbank every midsummer night and that the Nye Add returns to the surface at the same time to look for Roddy. Mickey has learned her language and that she is a Kelpie, not a Nye Add. Finally, it's revealed that the story is being narrated by Mickey himself.\n\nJason Hunter is an extremely handsome boy, a great sprinter...and a bully. When he finds out about a new student coming to the school, he attempts to make her his next target but he cannot do it, for some reason. Later, he finds out her name is Huma D'Este and attempts to use it to make fun of her, but she retaliates by making fun of \"his\" name and drawing a rude picture on the blackboard. Much later, one morning Jason is drawn by a mysterious voice to a Greek temple where Huma D'Este is waiting for him. She shows him eleven marble statues and he deduces that one is missing. After trying to get him to tell her who was the captain of the \"Argo\" in Greek mythology, she tells him that he was called Jason and that he was the final piece of her collection. Jason finds out that \"Huma D'Este\" is an anagram of \"The Medusa\"! She turns him to marble. Myriad years later, two of Jason's classmates, Carlene and Mal Blake, have married and have children and grandchildren. The two go on a cruise and Carlene tours an exhibit of marble statues. She notices that one of the statues looks suspiciously like her classmate Jason Hunter.\n\nKirkus Reviews praised the book for its \"sly humor and suspenseful plotting\".\n"}

It is home to four Northwestern Wildcats athletic teams: men's basketball, women's basketball, women's volleyball, and wrestling. It is located inside McGaw Memorial Hall, to the north of Ryan Field.\n\nThe building opened in 1952 as a replacement for Patten Gymnasium, and was the site of the Final Four for the 1956 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament. It was extensively renovated in 1983, at which time the main arena was renamed Welsh–Ryan Arena. At the conclusion of the 2016–17 basketball season, the arena was renovated and upgraded as part of a $110 million project completed in late 2018. The renovation displaced the athletic programs that use the arena for the 2017–18 season.\n\nFor years, Welsh–Ryan Arena was the smallest arena in the Big Ten Conference and the only conference facility that did not seat at least 10,000. With Rutgers University joining the conference in 2014, Welsh–Ryan became the second-smallest arena after the Louis Brown Athletic Center at Rutgers, which has a listed capacity of 8,000. Welsh–Ryan once again became the smallest arena in the Big Ten Conference in 2018, with the listed capacity decreasing to 7,039 after renovations.\n\nMcGaw Memorial Hall was built through the generosity of Northwestern University trustee and donor Foster G. McGaw, founder of the American Hospital Supply Corporation. The building, named in memory of McGaw's father, Presbyterian minister and missionary Francis A. McGaw, to house sporting events and large-scale meetings. With a seating capacity of about 13,000, McGaw Memorial Hall was one of the three largest auditoriums in the Chicago area at the time of its construction. Designed by the architectural firm of Holabird & Root & Burgee and built of reinforced concrete, McGaw Memorial Hall contained of interior space. The lighting system, consisting of 180 mercury vapor lights, was said to simulate \"pure daylight.\"\n\nPartitions, portable bleachers, and a removable basketball floor made the building suitable for a wide variety of uses. While the intent was to provide a space large enough to hold the entire student body of Northwestern University at once during convocations and other such campus occasions, the auditorium was also used by the North Shore Music Festival and, soon after its opening, by the Second Assembly of the World Council of Churches. This event, held August 15–30, 1954, featured a convocation address by U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower.\n\nIn 1983 Northwestern completed extensive renovations on the interior of the McGaw Hall. The main arena was renamed Welsh–Ryan Arena in honor of the project's principal donor, insurance magnate Patrick G. Ryan, president of the Board of Trustees, and of his wife's parents, Mr. and Mrs. Robert J. Welsh, Sr. The lobby was renamed Ronald J. Chinnock Lobby after real estate tycoon Ronald Chinnock.\n\nThe McGaw Fieldhouse is a practice facility within the building, which in 1997 was renovated to allow practice space for basketball and volleyball.\n\nIn 2007, the Brown Family Basketball Center was constructed within the McGaw Fieldhouse to include new locker rooms and team lounges for the men's and women's basketball teams, as well as offices for their respective coaching staffs.\n\nIn 2016, Northwestern announced plans for a $110 million arena renovation, shuttering the facility for the 2017–18 season. During that time, the Wildcat men's basketball and wrestling teams played at Allstate Arena in Rosemont, with the women's basketball team playing out of Evanston Township High School's Beardsley Gym that season. Capacity was reduced to 7,039 by replacing the bleachers with chairback seats. The renovated facility also has wider concourses, balconies behind the baskets, and suites. Before then, one of the few significant changes since the 1983 renovation had been the replacement of the arena's 1980s-vintage scoreboards with a modern video board.\n\n\n \n"}

It is a step in the graphical pipeline that tests whether the points in the polygon appear in clockwise or counter-clockwise order when projected onto the screen. If the user has specified that front-facing polygons have a clockwise winding, but the polygon projected on the screen has a counter-clockwise winding then it has been rotated to face away from the camera and will not be drawn.\n\nThe process makes rendering objects quicker and more efficient by reducing the number of polygons for the program to draw. For example, in a city street scene, there is generally no need to draw the polygons on the sides of the buildings facing away from the camera; they are completely occluded by the sides facing the camera.\n\nIn general back-face culling can be assumed to produce no visible artifact in a rendered scene if it contains only closed and opaque geometry. In scenes containing transparent polygons, rear \nfacing polygons may become visible through the process of alpha composition. In wire-frame rendering, back-face culling can be used to partially address problem of hidden line removal, but only for closed convex geometry.\n\nA related technique is clipping, which determines whether polygons are within the camera's field of view at all.\n\nAnother similar technique is Z-culling, also known as occlusion culling, which attempts to skip the drawing of polygons which are covered from the viewpoint by other visible polygons.\n\nOne method of implementing back-face culling is by discarding all triangles where the dot product of their surface normal and the camera-to-triangle vector is greater than or equal to zero\n\nwhere is the view point, is the first vertex of a triangle and is its normal, defined as a cross product of two vectors representing sides of the triangle adjacent to \n\nSince cross product is non-commutative, defining the normal in terms of cross product allows to specify normal direction relative to triangle surface using vertex order(winding):\n\nIf points are already in view space, can be assumed to be , the origin.\n\nIt is also possible to use this method in projection space by representing above inequality as determinant of a matrix and applying projection matrix to it.\n\nAnother method exists based on reflection parity, which is more appropriate for two dimensions where surface normal cannot be computed (also known as CCW check).\n\nLet a unit triangle in two dimensions (homogeneous coordinates) be defined as\n\nThen for some other triangle, also in two dimensions,\n\ndefine a matrix that transforms the unit triangle into it\n\nso that\n\nDiscard the triangle if matrix contained odd number of reflections (facing the opposite way of unit triangle)\n\nUnit triangle is used as a reference and transformation is used as a trace to tell if vertex order is different between two triangles. The only way vertex order can change in two dimensions is by reflection. Reflection is an example of involutory function (with respect to vertex order), even number of reflections will leave triangle facing the same side, as if no reflections were applied at all. An odd number of reflections will leave triangle facing the other side, as if exactly after one reflection. Transformations containing an odd number of reflections always have negative scaling factor, likewise scaling factor is positive if there are no reflections or even number of them. Scaling factor of a transformation is computed by determinant of its matrix.\n"}

He served as the Chair of the Department of Biochemistry at McGill University from 1928–1941 and Dean of Medicine at the University of Western Ontario from 1947–1961, where he was a charter member of The Kappa Alpha Society.\n\nBorn in Belleville, Ontario, he enrolled at Trinity College at the University of Toronto at the age of 15, and studied physiology and biochemistry. He obtained a Ph.D. in Biochemistry from the same university in 1916.\n\nIn 1915, at the age of 22, Collip accepted a lecturing position in Edmonton in the Department of Physiology at the University of Alberta Faculty of Medicine, shortly before completing his doctorate. He fulfilled the role for 7 years, eventually rising to the position of Professor and Head of the Department of Biochemistry in 1922. His research at the time was mainly focused on blood chemistry of vertebrates and invertebrates.\n\nHe took a sabbatical leave beginning in April 1921, and travelled to Toronto on a Rockefeller Travelling Scholarship for a six-month position with Professor J. J. R. MacLeod of the University of Toronto's Department of Physiology. There his research program (on the effect of pH on the concentration of sugar in the blood) would take him to marine biological stations in Woods Hole, Massachusetts and St. Andrews, New Brunswick before he returned to Toronto late in the year.\n\nMacLeod was overseeing the work of Frederick Banting and Charles Best in their search for a treatment for diabetes which they had begun in May 1921. In December, when Banting and Best were having difficulties in refining the pancreatic extract, MacLeod freed Collip from his other research to enable him to join the research team. Collip's task was to prepare insulin in a more pure, usable form than Banting and Best had been able to achieve to date.\n\nIn January 1922, after 14-year-old Leonard Thompson suffered a severe allergic reaction to an injection of insulin, Collip achieved the goal of preparing a pancreatic extract pure enough for him to recover and to use in clinical trials. Successful trials were soon completed and the future of insulin was assured. Banting, Best and Collip subsequently shared the patent for insulin, which they sold to the University of Toronto for one dollar.\n\nRegrettably, due to disagreements between Banting and MacLeod, there was ill-will generated within the team. The Nobel Prize for Medicine was awarded to Banting and MacLeod in 1923. Feeling that Best had been overlooked in the award, Banting shared his portion with Best. In response, MacLeod shared his portion with Collip. Nonetheless, Collip (and Best) have been largely forgotten as co-discoverers of insulin.\n\nFollowing this early success, Collip returned to Edmonton to take up a position as Head of the new Department of Biochemistry, and to pursue his own studies on hormone research. In 1928 he was recruited to McGill University in Montreal by his former graduate advisor, Archibald Macallum. Collip served as Chair of McGill's Department of Biochemistry from 1928 to 1941. From 1947-1961, Collip was appointed Dean of Medicine at the University of Western Ontario. He is regarded as a pioneer of endocrine research. He did pioneering work with the hormone Parathyroid hormone (PTH).\n\nHe died on June 19, 1965 at the age of 72.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1874649", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1874649", "title": "Grand Junction Railroad and Depot Company", "text": "Grand Junction Railroad and Depot Company\n\nThe Grand Junction Railroad is an 8.55-mile (13.76 km) long railroad in the Boston, Massachusetts, area, connecting the railroads heading west and north from Boston. Most of it is still in use, carrying scrap either inbound or outbound to the Schnitzer scrap yard on the Everett waterfront or freight to the Chelsea Produce Market, and non-revenue transfers of Amtrak and MBTA passenger equipment between the lines terminating at North Station and South Station. The line is also notable for its railroad bridge over the Charles River that passes under the Boston University Bridge between Boston and Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nThe railroad (full name Grand Junction Railroad and Depot Company) was chartered April 24, 1847, to connect the railroads entering Boston from the north and west with its wharves in East Boston. This was a rechartering of the Chelsea Branch Railroad, incorporated April 10, 1846.\n\nThe first section to open was from East Boston to the Boston and Maine Railroad in Somerville, opened in 1849. It began at a huge waterfront yard complex on Boston Harbor, occupying the space east of the Eastern Railroad terminal and west of the Boston, Revere Beach and Lynn Railroad terminal. The line headed north with two tracks (minimum) just east of the Eastern Railroad's line, crossing at-grade and splitting to the west just south of Curtis Street, with a crossover track between the two lines south of the crossing (allowing Eastern Railroad trains from their terminal to use the Grand Junction). In 1905, the Grand Junction Railroad in East Boston was rebuilt into a below-grade two-track line, and the Eastern Railroad line was truncated to just north of the split.\n\nNext the Grand Junction crossed Chelsea Creek into Chelsea. It passed north of downtown Chelsea and through outlying areas of Everett before crossing the Mystic River into Somerville and running along the east side of the Boston and Maine Railroad's main line towards Boston. It soon crossed the border into Charlestown, part of Boston. Just south of Cambridge Street, the Grand Junction junctioned with and crossed the B&M. After crossing the B&M, the extension immediately crossed the Mystic River Branch of the Boston and Lowell Railroad, just before crossing back into Somerville. In Cambridge it crossed under the old B&L mainline (with track connections) and merged with the Fitchburg Railroad.\n\nIn March 1852 the line was leased to the Eastern Railroad between the B&M in Somerville and Salem Turnpike (now called Broadway) in Chelsea. The Eastern Railroad, then ending in East Boston, used the line for downtown Boston access, building a cutoff in 1854 from their main line to the Grand Junction in Chelsea, and building a new line splitting from the Grand Junction just west of the B&M and B&L Mystic River Branch crossing and running just west of the B&M into downtown. The Saugus Branch Railroad, bought by the Eastern April 30, 1852, was realigned in 1855 at its south end to feed into the Grand Junction rather than the B&M.\n\nThe rest of the line was built in 1856, connecting to the Boston and Worcester Railroad in Allston, now part of Boston. Instead of merging with the Fitchburg Railroad, it continued west along its north side for a bit (passing under the Boston and Lowell Railroad's new alignment) before turning south, crossing the Fitchburg Railroad at-grade onto its own alignment through Cambridge. A track connection was provided with the Fitchburg Railroad, connecting the East Boston-bound Grand Junction to the Fitchburg-bound Fitchburg.\n\nAfter running through Cambridge along what was once the shore of the Charles River and is now a rough border between the main campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the rest of Cambridge, the line crossed the river diagonally on a bridge under the Essex Street Bridge (now the Boston University Bridge) and joined with the Boston and Worcester Railroad (after 1867, the Boston and Albany Railroad). \n\nThe line was reorganized as the East Boston Freight Railroad in 1862, and the Boston and Albany bought the property in 1869. It passed with the B&A into larger companies - the New York Central Railroad, Penn Central and Conrail. On February 28, 1955, the counterweight fell off the Chelsea Creek drawbridge, taking the bridge permanently out of service; subsequently B&A trains reached East Boston from Chelsea using B&M trackage rights via Revere. B&A service to East Boston ended around 1972.\n\nA small footnote is the Union Railroad, which was incorporated May 10, 1848, for the same purpose, and was authorized to merge with the Grand Junction February 25, 1854.\n\nThe section of the Grand Junction between the now vacated Beacon Park Yard and the Fitchburg Line is used by the MBTA to transfer southside commuter rail equipment to and from the MBTA Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility, and by Amtrak to transfer \"Downeaster\" equipment to and from Southampton Street Yard. CSX Transportation operates one daily freight to the New England Produce Center and scrap yards in Everett. The Barnum and Bailey Circus train often parked on the Grand Junction while the circus was in Boston. The track loading gauge is the minimal Plate B.\n\nThe section of line is owned by MassDOT, although MIT owns the land of two segments with an easement for rail use. On October 2, 2008, the state government announced an agreement with CSX Transportation for the purchase and upgrade of several of CSX's freight lines in the state, including the western section of the Grand Junction. The agreement was signed on September 23, 2009. A first closing on June 11, 2010, transferred dispatching control of the line from CSX to the MBTA's commuter rail operator. The second closing on October 4, 2012, transferred ownership of the Grand Junction and several other important lines to the state, completing the $100 million deal.\n\nOn November 16, 2012, Amtrak and MBTA equipment moves were limited to over the Grand Junction Railroad Bridge, and freight traffic was not allowed to use the bridges. On November 21, the bridge was closed to all rail traffic due to its poor condition. While emergency repairs were under way, trains moving between the north and south sides of Boston had to be routed via Pan Am Railways trackage between Ayer and Worcester, a lengthy detour. The bridge reopened in early January 2013, but was closed again from March to June for additional structural repairs.\n\nFrom the Fitchburg Line to the Haverhill Line (shared at that point by the Newburyport/Rockport Line), the former Grand Junction is occupied by tracks which allow freight trains to move between the four northside main lines. The Newburyport/Rockport Line parallels the Grand Junction right-of-way from there to Broadway in Chelsea. In Everett, freight yard tracks occupy the Grand Junction right of way; in Chelsea, the Silver Line Gateway busway has been constructed from Everett Avenue to Eastern Avenue. CSX filed to abandon the section from 2nd Street in Everett to Saratoga Street in East Boston in 2002; the abandonment process was still under way when that segment was included in the 2009 agreement. By the 2010 and 2012 closings, an additional segment to the west in Everett was included in the sale to MassDOT.\n\nThe section in East Boston, which largely shared a right of way with the Eastern Railroad's East Boston Branch, has fragmented ownership and uses. The section from Curtis Street to Lovell Street was transferred to Massport ownership and converted into the Martin A. Coughlin Bypass Road, a two-lane route for commercial traffic to and from Logan Airport that opened on November 26, 2012. \n\nConrail abandoned the line between Lovell Street and the East Boston docks in the 1970s. The former rail yards north of Route 1A were used as a private \"Park'N'Fly\" lot for Logan Airport. In 1989, the Massachusetts Highway Department began proceedings to acquire the land by eminent domain as part of the Big Dig project. Since the Third Harbor Tunnel would bring additional traffic to Logan Airport, the site was to be converted to a public park, in partial restitution for the 1969 destruction of Wood Island Park for airport expansion. After a lengthy scandal over the proposed land taking (and later land swap) that sent Speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives Charles Flaherty to jail and implicated others including U.S. Representative Bud Shuster, Massport purchased the land outright in 2001. In 2007, Bremen Street Park opened on the site.\n\nThe remaining section to the south lay unused. Residents tried to clean up the tracks for use as a greenbelt in 1978, although local business leaders desired to reuse it as a haul road. Conrail donated that section to The Trust for Public Land in 1997. In 2007, after eight years of construction, the East Boston Greenway was opened on the corridor.\n\nThe Grand Junction railroad bridge over Chelsea Creek has been removed and part of the eastern-most right-of-way has been converted into the \"Martin A. Coughlin Bypass Road\", a two-lane route for commercial traffic to and from Logan Airport that opened November 26, 2012. In October 2013, after several months of planning, MassDOT announced funding to convert the section from Eastern Avenue to Sixth Street into a Silver Line busway and a parallel $3 million multi-use greenway.\n\nThe City of Cambridge has done a feasibility study concerning adding a \"rail with trail\" multi-use path to be known as the Grand Junction Community Path from the Charles River Bike Paths at the Boston University Bridge, through MIT, paralleling Cardinal Medeiros Way northeast of Kendall Square, and connecting to the proposed extension of the Somerville Community Path near Twin City Plaza. \n\nThe \"locally preferred alternative\" for the Urban Ring project as of June 2008 calls for routing bus rapid transit along the Grand Junction right-of-way, from George Washington Park in Cambridgeport, over the Charles River. The existing railroad bridge would be widened to add lanes for buses and the path.\n\nIn 2010, Lieutenant Governor Tim Murray publicly discussed branching the Framingham/Worcester Line over the Grand Junction to provide MBTA Commuter Rail service from Worcester to North Station.\n\nIn December 2011, the Massachusetts Department of Transportation announced that \"is not pursuing the use of the Grand Junction for increased MBTA Commuter Rail service at this point,\" opting instead to expand South Station, which would allow more service from Worcester without the need for a North Station route. It further stated: \"However, expanding Boston South Station is an enormously complex and expensive project without a specific timeframe. Should the need for increased Commuter Rail capacity become overwhelming in the period prior to the expansion of South Station, MassDOT might reopen the Grand Junction discussion. The use of Grand Junction for Commuter Rail service could meet some of the needs to be provided by an expanded South Station, at much lower cost and with much less time and complexity.\"\n\nThe Grand Junction would have been used to carry ethanol by rail to a tank farm in Revere as one of three route options considered in a proposal that underwent state safety and environmental review in 2013. Unit trains consisting of perhaps 60 tank cars would have run at night to deliver the gasoline additive. In the face of community opposition and pressure from the state legislature, the company withdrew its proposal on July 2, 2013.\n\nIn 2014, the western part of the line was included in a proposal to connect a proposed West Station with North Station, with the creation of an additional infill station on the line in Cambridge.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1874656", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1874656", "title": "Manfredi Mineo", "text": "Manfredi Mineo\n\nManfredi \"Al\" or \"Alfred\" Mineo (; 1880 – November 5, 1930) was a Brooklyn-based New York mobster, who headed a strong American Mafia crime family during the Castellammarese War. Mineo's organization would eventually become the present-day Gambino crime family.\n\nIn the early part of the 20th century, New York had five Sicilian crime families. With the imprisonment of powerful Sicilian Mafia boss Giuseppe Morello in 1910, Salvatore D'Aquila, one of Morello's chief captains, immediately emerged as the new chief Mafia power in New York City, mostly in East Harlem and Little Italy (in southern Manhattan), but he also led a faction in Brooklyn that was headed locally by Mineo. D'Aquila had assumed the title from Morello of Capo di tutti capi or Boss of Bosses. D'Aquila's family, with Mineo's Brooklyn faction included, reigned supreme through the 1910s. However, upon the advent of prohibition other Mafia crime families and also non-mafia operations began to gain power and influence and cemented their positions around the city. One of these crime families was the former Morello crime family, which had been taken over by Joseph \"Joe the Boss\" Masseria around 1920. Former boss Giuseppe Morello was released from prison approximately the same time and quickly aligned himself with Joe Masseria against boss Toto D'Aquila and his underbosses, including Mineo.\n\nManfredi Mineo would continue his rise within the New York Mafia and eventually become D'Aquila's second in command or underboss of all his operations while still leading his own family in Brooklyn as a D'Aquila faction. As rivalries and animosity grew between the D'Aquila and Masseria families, Mineo would eventually find himself in a precarious position. D'Aquila had previously sentenced Morello to death upon his release from prison, along with his ally Umberto Valenti, but through the intervention of Pittsburgh Mafia leader, Nicola Gentile, the death sentence on Morello and Valenti was revoked. With Valenti now in his debt, D'Aquila used this opportunity to recruit the feared Mafia leader in order to oppose the new Masseria-Morello alliance. Al Mineo faced the chance of losing power and influence within the D'Aquila crime family to Valenti, but in 1922 Valenti was murdered by Masseria-Morello forces. By the mid-1920s Mineo and his top lieutenant Steve Ferrigno began to assess their position within the D'Aquila organization, and understood at this time that the new power in New York was Joe Masseria, so Mineo secretly began to align himself with Masseria.\n\nOn October 10, 1928, while standing next to his car, D'Aquila was murdered by gunmen. Mineo, who had recently aligned himself with boss Joe Masseria, more than likely played a direct role in planning the murder of his boss. After declaring his allegiance to Masseria and showing his distorted loyalty by betraying his former boss, Mineo's place atop the D'Aquila crime family leadership was cemented. He had secured his Brooklyn interests and would now command one of the larger Manhattan-based Mafia groups in New York. With Ferrigno as his second in command based in the Bronx, the Mineo crime family would control a number of rackets: bootlegging, gambling, numbers and extortion.\n\nStrong rivalries continued between various New York Mafia crime families and factions, the most heated rivalry being the one between Mineo's Manhattan-based allies in the Masseria crime family and those in the Brooklyn-based Castellammarese clan, a group of mafiosi from the Sicilian seaside town of Castellammare del Golfo, who rose to prominence during Prohibition and would become extremely independent and eventually oppose the dominance of boss Joe Masseria and his supporters such as Mineo. The rivalries and animosities between the two groups would eventually come to a head and a war within the Italian underworld would erupt and drag every Mafia crime family and faction in New York into the conflict.\n\nWhat became known as the Castellammarese War began in early 1930 and dragged on for the better part of two years, as New York Mafia leaders Joe Masseria and Salvatore Maranzano fought for dominance over the New York rackets. Mineo felt secure being aligned with Joe Masseria, who led the most powerful New York Mafia crime family and was recognized as the most influential crime boss in the city. The Masseria-Mineo alliance quickly gained the upper hand in the war as their forces began to move on Castellammarese-controlled territories and rackets members, eliminating rivals at every opportunity, but on August 15, 1930, the tide began to change when Masseria's top advisor and war chief, Giuseppe Morello, was killed. Mineo was named Masseria's new war chief and strategist and quickly surmised that the Castellammarese were gaining more support and more ground as the war dragged on. Mineo felt the only solution was to find and kill Maranzano before he could kill Masseria, this being the only sensible solution to ending the war and re-establishing dominance over the New York Mafia.\n\nOn November 5, 1930, Mineo and his lieutenant Steve Ferrigno were murdered in the courtyard of an apartment building on Pelham Parkway in the Bronx. Earlier in the week, several Maranzano gunmen had rented a first floor apartment in the building. Their actual target was Masseria, who had been observed entering the building earlier in the week. However, when the gunmen saw Mineo and Ferrigno in the garden, they seized the opportunity and shot both of them from the apartment window.\n\nAfter Mineo's death, Francesco \"Frank\" Scalice became crime family boss. He immediately switched allegiance from Masseria to Maranzano, who was emerging as the winner in the gang war. It has been theorized that Scalise had arranged a secret deal with Maranzano to kill Mineo and become the organization boss, but Maranzano forces were able to eliminate Mineo without Scalise's help. On April 15, 1931, Joe Masseria was shot and killed in a Coney Island restaurant and the Castellammarese War was over.\n\nNo person was ever charged in the Mineo murder. In 1963, government witness Joseph Valachi claimed that Girolamo Santuccio was one of the gunmen.\n\n\n"}

As the home of the university's Wildcats basketball team of the Pac-12 Conference, it is primarily used for basketball, but also has physical training and therapy facilities. Its construction is marked with a large copper cap that has oxidized brown. The arena opened in February 1973 and has an official capacity of 14,644 spectators. The elevation at street level is approximately above sea level.\n\nThe McKale Center was named in honor of J.F. \"Pop\" McKale, a major athletic figure at U of A from 1914 to 1957. At one time, he was head coach of all of the school's athletic teams. He was head basketball coach from 1914 to 1921, where he achieved a record. He led the football team from 1914 to 1930, with an record. It was McKale's first team that resulted in Arizona's teams being nicknamed \"Wildcats.\" In 1914, Arizona's name meant very little in the college football world. Although they lost to Occidental College in Los Angeles a reporter for the \"Los Angeles Times\" was so impressed with Arizona's effort that he wrote, \"The Arizona men showed the fight of wild cats ...\" Soon afterward, Arizona's student-athletes were nicknamed the Wildcats.\n\nFollowing a win over rival Arizona State on February 26, 2000, the university athletic department honored longtime head coach Lute Olson with a ceremony to name the McKale Center playing surface \"Lute Olson Court.\" Less than a year later, during a memorial service in January 2001 for Olson's late wife, Bobbi, it was renamed, \"Lute and Bobbi Olson Court\" in recognition of the couple's impact on the university and the city of Tucson.\n\nIn 2002, the Eddie Lynch Athletics Pavilion, a state-of-the-art medical and strength/conditioning facility for Wildcat student athletes, was completed and opened. The pavilion (which cost $14 million) was a addition to the north end of McKale Center. The upper level has a museum-like display area, open to the public, showcasing the history of Arizona Wildcat athletics.\n\nIn terms of capacity, McKale Center is the second-largest arena in the Pac-12 conference; Utah's Huntsman Center in Salt Lake City is first, but Arizona averages greater attendance. Arizona has the current longest streak of leading its conference in attendance in conference history, going on 34 seasons & second in the country currently behind Kentucky at 40.\n\nThe University's spring and winter commencement ceremonies were held at McKale Center from 1973 until 2012; the 2013 ceremonies returned to Arizona Stadium after an absence of thirty years.\n\nIn December 2012, the university athletic department was given approval by the Arizona Board of Regents to select an architect to renovate the arena. \"The hope is to get it to be where it's one concourse enclosed that you can walk around and have the restrooms and concessions and everything tied to it,\" said athletic director Greg Byrne. The renovation would also include a club area, luxury seating, and more room for the athletics offices that occupy the McKale Center.\n\nThe Arizona Athletic Department ultimately decided on AECOM to plan and design the renovation. The project will be completed in several phases from 2014–2017 at a cost of $80 million. McKale Center will remain open during the construction process, with a majority of the work done outside of basketball season. The first phase of the renovation includes a brand new HD video scoreboard which was completed at the end of December 2013. Other parts of the first phase also included new seating, a new floor, an improved locker room area and expanded restrooms and concessions. The first phase was completed in November 2014.\n\n\"+ record reflects 11 vacated victories during 2007-08 season due to NCAA infractions\"\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1874660", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1874660", "title": "Mulegé", "text": "Mulegé\n\nMulegé is an oasis town in the Mexican state of Baja California Sur, situated at the mouth of the \"Río de Santa Rosalía\". It is the fourth-largest community in Mulegé Municipality. It had a population of 3,821 according to the Mexican federal census of 2010.\n\nIndigenous peoples had lived in this area for thousands of years due to the abundance of water in the river valley. Extensive ancient cave paintings can be found in the nearby Sierra de Guadalupe mountains.\n\nIn 1702, Jesuit Father Juan Maria de Salvatierra identified the valley of today's Mulegé as a place for a mission to the Indians. It was not until 1754 that Father Francisco Escalante started the construction of the mission, called Misión Santa Rosalía de Mulegé. Years later, many other Jesuit fathers came into today's area of Mulegé to bring the Catholic faith and convert the natives to Catholicism.\n\nThe official name of the town is \"Heroica Mulegé.\" This title is based on incidents during the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848. The Americans tried to occupy long stretches of the Pacific coast such as California, Baja California, and New Mexico all of which were then part of Mexico. The people of Mulegé and surrounding settlements along the Pacific coastline defeated the Americans. As a result, Mulegé was not occupied and was rewarded the official title \"Heroica Mulegé\" by the national legislature. In the 21st century, official letters of the Government of Baja California Sur retain use of the title, \"\"Heroica Mulegé.\"\"\n\nMulegé is internationally famous for its rich fishing grounds in the Gulf of California. A warm current from the southern and a cold current from the northern Pacific come together in the Mulegé area of the Gulf of California and encourage a great variety of different fish species. The Gulf is sometimes known as the \"Sea of Cortez\", after the Spanish explorer, Hernán Cortés, who sailed into the area.\n\nIn the past, Mulegé's economy was largely based on fishing and farming. Today, tourism is a major income source for Mulegé. Some come for the area's deep sea fishing. Kayaking; cave tours; bird watching; and fishing, with or without charters to catch a big game fish; are popular attractions. \n\nToday's tourism industry in Mulegé is based on the fact that in 1976 the Highway MX 1 a paved road was constructed and Mulegé became easily accessible by land. A trip from the US border to Mulegé takes no more than 12 hours today. Before the highway was constructed, such a trip could take four days.\n\nThe area has suffered damage from Hurricane John in 2006, Tropical Storm Julio in 2008, Hurricane Jimena in 2009, Hurricane Paul in 2012, and Hurricane Odile in 2014. All five hurricanes created major precipitation followed by high floods. All over the Mulegé area, from the Pacific to the Gulf of California, rainfall and floods were devastating. Mulegé was flooded by over 20 feet of water at the highway bridge and by 6 feet in the upper regions of town. Many homes located in the river valley were washed into the Gulf of California. Clean-up was still being done in January, 2015.\n\nThe entire peninsula of Baja California is an area with one of the lowest precipitation rates in the world. Rain is rare but usually occurs between December and March, and hurricanes are occasionally a major threat to the Mulegé area. There is a saying in Baja California: \"It never rains in Baja, but if it rains, it pours.\" \n\nDue to fertile soil and a rich water supply in the Mulegé river valley, irrigation has supported agriculture in this area as a strong part of the economy, unlike other areas of Baja California. Tropical fruits are cultivated, including oranges, bananas, limes, and mangoes.\n\nBy land, Mulegé is accessible by Federal Highway 1, which runs from Tijuana at the US-MX border to Cabo San Lucas.\n\nMulegé is served by three airstrips in the area, which are used for private air travel: El Gallito Airstrip, Mulegé Airstrip, and Punta San Pedro Airstrip. Regional flights are available at the Palo Verde Airport (to the north of town), and international flights are available at the Loreto Airport (123 km to the south).\n\nThe Misión Santa Rosalía de Mulegé is located above the river, overlooking the river valley.\n\nA special feature of the town is the old prison. It has no bars. The prisoners could freely walk around town and establish or maintain families here. They just had to return to the prison in the evening. Escapes were rare because of the remoteness of Mulegé. Until Mex 1 was paved, the area was surrounded by harsh desert for many miles. All prisoners had to agree to assist in tracking escapees and assist in their capture. Today, the old prison is operated as a museum, with a suggested nominal entry fee.\n\n"}
{"id": "1874675", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1874675", "title": "Glay, Doubs", "text": "Glay, Doubs\n\nGlay is a commune in the Doubs department in eastern France. It is located in the Jura mountains near the border with Switzerland.\n\nThe area around Glay was part of Burgundy as early as 888, and came under the control of the Holy Roman Empire in 1034.\n\nThe village is first historically reported in the 12th century as a centre for glass making, and the name \"Glay\" comes from the French word for \"glass\". Control of the area changed hands many times in the following centuries as the many small feudal regions constantly competed with each other for land, taxes and prominence. During the period 1200-1700 Glay was alternately ruled by cities and states that are now part of modern France (Montbéliard), Germany (Württemberg) and Switzerland (Neuchâtel).\n\nIn 1259 Marguerite of Montbeliard, daughter of Thierry III of Montbéliard (1205–1283) married the Grand Duke of Neuchâtel. Included as part of her dowry were the seigniories of Blamont (including Glay), Châtelot, Belmont and Cuisance. Blamont was placed by the Lords of Neuchâtel under the protection of the counts and dukes of Burgundy to protect it from being taken back by Montbéliard once control had passed to later generations.\n\nIn his will Thierry III passed control of Montbéliard itself to the Countess Guillemette, his great-granddaughter. Since she had married a lord of Burgundy, the entirety of Montbéliard now came under the control of Burgundy, which outraged the other descendants of Thierry III, who had hoped to rule the area themselves. In order to avoid a war of succession, Renaud of Burgundy made some concessions. In the spring of 1283 he ceded to Thiébaud IV, Lord of Neuchâtel, the seigniories of Blamont (including Glay) and Châtelot, and guaranteed their status as being held by Neuchâtel.\n\nAt least twice in the century that followed Glay sought to free itself from the control of Neuchâtel by force of arms. Each effort was defeated.\n\nIn 1340 Thiébaud VI of Neuchâtel received the villages of Glay, Hérimoncourt, Pierrefontaine, Seloncourt and Villars-lès-Blamont as part of the dowry brought by his wife upon their marriage.\n\nIn 1383 Glay was part of the dowry (with many other local towns) of the wife of Thiébaud VIII of Neuchâtel. In the centuries that followed it was part of the ever-changing alliances, rivalries and wars between Montbéliard, the Duke of Burgundy, the Kingdom of France, the Swiss Confederation and Basel.\n\nIn 1439 mercenaries who were not paid after the Treaty of Arras (1435) ended the war between King Charles VII of France and Philip, Duke of Burgundy plundered the area.\n\nIn August 1474 during the Burgundian Wars, following the devastation of Alsace by Charles the Bold, the area was again heavily damaged in the fighting. After Charles' death at the hands of the Swiss in the Battle of Nancy in 1477, the area around Glay came under the control of the Bishop of Basel, Jean de Venningen. The church returned the area to Neuchâtel in 1478.\n\nBy the early 16th century the power of the Lords of Neuchâtel was on the decline after Thiébaud IX failed to produce a male heir. After a struggle over succession marked by wars and lawsuits, on May 4, 1506 Ulrich, Duke of Württemberg, who had also taken control of Montbéliard and held the title of Count of Montbéliard, bought all of Blamont, including Glay.\n\nBecause the German Dukes of Württemberg were Lutheran, the area around Glay has since this time been Lutheran, despite the fact that France overall is predominantly Catholic.\n\nDuring the Thirty Years War the area around Glay suffered tremendously. In 1635 alone the region was invaded by troops from both warring alliances and suffered from the plague and famine.\n\nAfter a period under the control of Spain, the region around Glay was occupied by the French in 1668 but handed back under the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. France again conquered the area in 1674, and it was finally ceded to France at the Treaty of Nijmegen in 1678. Control from the King in Paris brought heavy taxation that devastated the local economy.\n\nIn 1790, after the French revolution, the Department of Doubs was created, which includes the area around Glay.\n\nWhen Napoleon was defeated at Waterloo in 1815, border skirmishes broke out between French troops and those from various subdivisions of Switzerland as the latter tried to take advantage of the chaos in Paris. Although Glay remained within the areas controlled by France adjacent to the Swiss border, the area suffered still further damage.\n\nIn World War II Glay was liberated by French forces in September, 1944, although some fighting continued in the region through November.\n\nIn recent years the town had benefitted from the presence of the Centre de Glay, which was most recently a convention centre with a 120-room hotel designed to draw more visitors to the area. The facility was founded in 1823 by the Swiss minister Father Jacquet to provide vocational training to disadvantaged Protestant children from the area. It later sheltered a private college, and was converted to a conference centre in 1953. The Centre closed in September, 2004 for budgetary reasons, and because the older buildings did not meet current European Union building codes. The closing was lamented as a loss to the Lutheran communities of the area.\n\nThe following diagram shows the towns nearby within a radius.\n"}

The fall of the Berlin Wall the following year and German reunification in 1990 meant that RIAS-TV was to be closed down. On 1 April 1992, Deutsche Welle inherited the RIAS-TV broadcast facilities, using them to start a German- and English-language television channel broadcast via satellite, DW (TV), adding a short Spanish broadcast segment the following year. In 1995, it began 24-hour operation (12 hours German, 10 hours English, two hours Spanish). At that time, DW (TV) introduced a new news studio and a new logo.\n\nIn 2001, Deutsche Welle (in conjunction with ARD and ZDF) founded the German TV subscription TV channel for North American viewers. The project was shut down after four years due to low subscriber numbers. It has since been replaced by the DW-TV channel (also a subscription service).\n\nUnlike most other international broadcasters, DW-TV doesn't charge terrestrial stations for use of its programming, and as a result its \"News Journal\" and other programmes are rebroadcast on numerous public broadcasting stations in several countries, including the United States, Australia, and New Zealand. In the Philippines, selected Anglophone programmes are shown nationwide on Net 25. In the U.S., some of its programs were distributed via the World Channel as well as MHz Worldview, although after the closure of MHz Worldview in 2020, a few stations has since offer a full carriage of DW-TV in select areas.\n\nIn March 2009, DW-TV expanded its television services in Asia with two new channels: DW-TV Asia and DW-TV Asia+.

The expansion pack centers on the new downtown area, which has various activities, such as bowling, karaoke, dining and dancing, as well as a photo booth, and includes a dating minigame which allows player to engage in their Sims' relationships in greater depth. Most elements from this expansion were incorporated into \"\" for \"The Sims 3\".\n\nThe game is reminiscent of an expansion pack from the original \"The Sims\" game entitled \"\", which focused on new social interactions and locations for Sims to visit, such as a dance club or romantic restaurant. \"Nightlife\" follows in a similar theme. Some of the items are also similar to the ones found in \"The Sims: House Party\" and \"The Sims: Superstar\".\n\nNew additions include inventories, new interactions, and over 125 new objects, including cars. NPCs that a player's Sim dates can now leave gifts or hate letters at the Sim's home, depending on the success of particular dates. Some of the new NPCs include party DJs, a Gypsy Matchmaker and Vampires.\n\n\"Nightlife\" also adds a new aspiration called the Pleasure Aspiration. This new aspiration is assigned in exactly the same way as any of the other five aspirations. Sims with this aspiration crave enjoyment in many different ways, whilst they fear embarrassment. Sims may receive wants such as 'juggle' and 'jump on lounge'.\n\n\"Nightlife\" adds another Aspiration as well: the Grilled Cheese Aspiration. The ReNuYu SensoOrb, an object which enables any Sim to change their aspiration, can fail like other Aspiration Reward objects when the Sim's Aspiration Meter is low. When this happens, the Sim using it receives the Grilled Cheese Aspiration, and all his or her wants and fears will be superseded with ones revolving around grilled cheese sandwiches, such as \"Make Grilled Cheese Sandwich\" or \"Be rejected for Talk about Grilled Cheese Sandwich.\" If \"\" is installed, the Sim's Lifetime Want will also change.\n\nIn \"Nightlife\", players can own their own cars instead of relying on the carpool to get to work or the bus to get to school. There are several models and colors available. In addition, driveways and garages can be built into the Sim's lot. Also new, more customized swimming pools can be designed. Included is a new diagonal shaped swimming pool tool, which can be used to create extensive shapes. However, the pool ladder and diving board may only be attached to pool tiles square on the lot.\n\nThe lot mode has been expanded in \"Nightlife\", so that it is possible to view the neighborhood from a lot. Players may leave one lot to play another without having to go back to the neighborhood mode. Two new radio stations come with the expansion, Oldies and Classical stations.\n\n\"Nightlife\" adds the option to add a \"downtown\" sub-neighborhood to each proper neighborhood. The pre-made downtown is simply called \"Downtown\", and contains several shops, restaurants, nightclubs and other community lots, as well as home lots. These places are perfect for dates, or group gatherings. It does not include pre-made Sims, though.\n\n\"The Sims 2: Nightlife\" introduces the concept of fury. Of limited duration, this generally affects which social interactions are accepted. It is most likely to occur when a spouse is caught cheating with another Sim. If another Sim becomes furious at the player's Sim, their Sim will be subjected to vandalism, such as having their newspaper stolen, or their trash can kicked over. Fury can also be caused by the player, if he/she decides to be very mean to the other Sim. Fury can be resolved by waiting for the furious timer to stop ticking or paying the sim. The Seasons expansion pack allows fury to be eliminated by the consumption of strawberry juice.\n\n\"The Sims 2: Nightlife\" introduces NPC Vampires. If a Sim builds a strong relationship with a vampire, which they can meet in community lots, they can ask to be bitten and thus, become stricken with Vampirisim. Vampires have sharp teeth, red eyes, and pale skin, have no reflection in mirrors, and can turn into a bat and fly. Vampires' needs do not decay at all during the night, allowing them to enjoy the nightlife that little bit more and making socializing and money making at night that little bit easier. Vampire Sims are also immortal and will not age, although Teen vampires will age if sent to college and again upon graduation.\n\nThe main weakness of a vampire is that during the day, their needs decay faster than those of normal Sims. If a Vampire tries to go out of the house during the day, their needs will drop down to zero fast, and eventually, they will combust and die. A vampire can avoid these dangers by sleeping in a coffin during the day, a new object introduced in the expansion pack. Vampirism can be cured with a potion.\n\n\"The Sims 2: Nightlife\" is the first expansion pack that includes private cars. The expansion pack includes 5 car models with different paintjobs such as: a hatchback, a pickup truck, a minivan, a sedan car, and a sports car. The player can install an alarm in the car, take the kids to school, drive to work, and go to community lots. The official website has included a garage set that allows players with any combination of games to have cars plus the Ford car company has made some of their cars available to \"The Sims 2 Nightlife\" owners through \"The Sims 2\" Website.\n\n\"The Sims 2: Nightlife\" received a \"Platinum\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 300,000 copies in the United Kingdom.\n\n\"Nightlife\" had received 76% from aggregate sites GameRankings and Metacritic respectively. \n"}

Up until his murder, he continued his music in exile from Hamburg, Germany, occasionally touring other countries.\n\nNasrat Ali Parsa was born in a suburb of Kabul, Afghanistan. His family, especially his oldest brother Najibullah Parsa, was already involved in music to a certain extent and the environment of a musical household helped materialize Nasrat’s artistic talents. According to Nasrat's personal account, he was first discovered after singing the songs of Ahmad Zahir on a national radio broadcast. After the singer heard the renditions of his songs by the 7 year old Nasrat, he got in touch with the child and invited him to sing with him. Thus was Nasrat’s formal initiation into singing.\n\nDue to Soviet occupation of Afghanistan and the ensuing disruptive guerrilla fighting, Nasrat Parsa and his family left Afghanistan in 1981 for Pakistan and subsequently to India. They took residence in the capital city of New Delhi, a popular destination for most war civilians. There, the 12-year-old Nasrat was said to delve into studying music to find comfort from the negative psychological effects of the war. He attended the school of music under the apprenticeship of classic Indian singer Daish Pandi. Although the classical music of Afghanistan and Indian classical music differ a bit in tone and rhythm, the training nonetheless gave Nasrat a foundation to prepare his voice and gave encouragement to the amateur to pursue his interest professionally. He also studied with Ustad Munawar Ali Khan, a leading authority in certain Indian music styles who taught him details of musical instruments and notes. It was these lessons that would prepare him for performing the ghazal that he later became known for in Europe.\n\nAfter a few transition years in India, Nasrat and his family immigrated to Germany. Establishing contact with other fellow countrymen in Hamburg, Nasrat became more involved in the music scene with the other exiled singers and musicians. There, he taught Waly Hedjasi, better known as VALY, a highly acclaimed musician.\n\nFrom his initial involvements in private parties to the formal weddings where strong singing background is considered, Nasrat's name ranked high on the choice list. At this time, he started working on recording professional albums as well. His initial works met with moderate notability; however, they were commercially steady in success.\n\nAt weddings he was acclaimed for the warm welcoming of the bride and groom with his number \"Maa Destmal Aawordaim\" (\"ما دستمال آورديم \") (\"Gohar\" Album) which roughly translates as \"we've brought our brother's bride.\" This album established Nasrat as a respected singer and also garnered him praise of critics. As a matter of fact, the monumentalizing of the bride and groom union following the entrance anthem of \"Ahesta Boro\" (\"آهسته برو\") in weddings with the hit song of the \"Gohar\" Album is now a strong tradition of Afghan weddings.\n\nHis performances hereon became regular, and he often teamed with other singers to perform in various cities outside of Germany.\n\nOn May 7, 2005, Nasrat Parsa performed a concert in Vancouver, Canada, on the occasion of Mother's Day, opening a comprehensive tour that was scheduled to include several cities in North America. At the height of his popularity, and on the occasion of promoting his upcoming album \"Dil\", the singer flew to Canada where he performed to a large crowd of fans, some of whom saw him live on stage for the first time.\n\nDuring a break on his concert, Nasrat was approached by a group of 3 young men claiming to be his fans. They asked him, aggressively, if he would sing more upbeat songs. He stated to them that he could not because he was not prepared to perform such songs. The singer maintained his composure and was respectful to the attending mothers who came to his concert on the occasion of Mother's Day.\n\nAfter the end of the concert, Nasrat was with his brother, Najib Parsa. At that moment, the three young men returned, and they asked for the singer's autograph and to take a picture with him. One of the infuriated men, dissatisfied with the justification, punched the singer in the face. This caused him to slump in shock and lose his balance. Nasrat fell down a flight of stairs, hitting his head on one of the concrete cases, and became immediately unconscious.\nThe singer was brought to hospital, but failed to recover from his injuries. At 11:15pm on the following day, Nasrat Ali Parsa, 36, was pronounced dead at a Vancouver hospital.\n\nThe man who punched him was found guilty of manslaughter and given a conditional sentence.\n\nOn May 12, 2005, Nasrat Parsa’s body was flown back to Germany for burial. The grief-stricken bereaved family members and fans around the world individually held services to honor the singer. Notably, the funeral held at Sayed Jamaladen Masjid by Habib Qaderi on May 15, 2005 in Orange County, United States, drew thousands of sorrowful fans. Other cities, in the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, and Afghanistan also held similar mourning sessions. His grave is situated in Frankfurt, Germany in \"Mainzer Waldfriedhof\".\n\nOn May 13, 2005, a candlelight vigil was held in memory of the singer in Laguna Beach, United States. The event, which drew many fans and sympathizers, called for a conscious effort to respect all singers from Afghanistan. Furthermore, it called for active action against violence in future concert events to protect the other musical assets of Afghanistan. The vigil was held with an Islamic theme to honor his family’s religious tradition. Similar ceremonies were also held thereafter in various cities around the world in honor of the singer.\n\nAfghan Music<br>\nSung in his native Persian\n\nINDIAN MUSIC<br>\nSung in Hindi\n\n\n\n"}

He was President of the Italian Chamber of Deputies from 2001 to 2006. Casini is currently Honorific President of the Centrist Democrat International and Honorary President of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), and formerly was majority faction leader of the Union of the Centre (UdC).\n\nCasini was born in Bologna and graduated with a degree in law. He was first elected in 1983 for the Christian Democracy party. In 1993, he was amongst the founders of the Christian Democratic Centre (CCD), which merged into Union of Christian and Centre Democrats (UDC) in 2002. In 2001, after Silvio Berlusconi's victory in the general election, Casini was chosen by the newly formed parliament as President of the Chamber of Deputies (the Italian lower house of parliament). Up to 2006, with his UDC, he was widely regarded as one of the primary members of the House of Freedoms, and sometimes spoken of as a possible successor to Berlusconi himself as leader of the coalition. However, as the campaign for the 2008 general election began, Casini officially detached himself from Berlusconi's coalition, refusing to enter his new People of Freedom (PdL) party, preferring to contest the election alone. In a speech to his UDC party, Casini said that \"not everyone is for sale\", in a not so veiled statement about Berlusconi's political tactics. Casini ran on a purely 'centrist' platform, expanding the UDC into the Union of the Centre (UdC) along with Savino Pezzotta's White Rose. After 2008, he remained in opposition. At the 2009 Administrative elections, alliances were decided on a local bases, sometimes with PdL, and sometimes with the Democratic Party.\n\nIn 2018 Casini was re-elected Senator in the single-member college of Bologna with the support of the centre-left coalition.\n\n\nAfter his divorce from Roberta Lubich (mother of his two daughters, Maria Carolina and Benedetta), he started dating and eventually moved in with Azzurra Caltagirone, daughter of the famous Roman entrepreneur and publisher Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone.

She quickly joined the Guild Theatre company, a new theatrical stock company in Cincinnati, Ohio. From that, she went to radio station WLW. Croft said of her work at WLW, \"from 1935 to 1939, I played parts with every kind of voice and accent: children, babies, old women, society belles, main street floozies – everything.\"\n\nCroft's initial appearance on radio was in \"Sherlock Holmes\". She worked extensively as an actress in radio, appearing on such programs as \"Life with Luigi\", \"Blondie\", \"The Adventures of Sam Spade\", \"Suspense\", \"The Beulah Show\", \"The Bill Goodwin Show\", \"Broadway Is My Beat\", \"On Stage\", \"Crime Classics\", \"Four-Star Playhouse\", \"The Harold Peary Show\", \"Joan Davis Time\", \"The Mel Blanc Show\", \"One Man's Family\", \"Our Miss Brooks\" and \"Sears Radio Theater\". She also appeared in frequent guest star roles on Lucille Ball's \"My Favorite Husband\", the beginning of their later professional and personal relationship.\n\nCroft and Hal March co-starred in \"Too Many Cooks\", a summer replacement program on CBS in 1950. The comedy centered on Douglas and Carrie Cook and their 10 children.\n\nIn addition to her work with Lucille Ball, she was a frequent guest star on other television programs, including Howard Duff's adventure/drama series \"Dante\" in the 1960 episode \"The Misfortune Cookie\".\n\nShe was a regular on at least two other series, as Clara Randolph the ebullient neighbor with the shrill voice married to Joe Randolph played by Hollywood veteran Lyle Talbot on \"The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet\" and on \"Our Miss Brooks\" on CBS, in which she reprised her radio role as Miss Daisy Enright, the title character's rival. She provided the voice for Cleo the basset hound in Jackie Cooper's NBC series \"The People’s Choice\" (1955–58).\n\nLate in the weekly run of the original \"I Love Lucy\" series, the major characters moved to Connecticut. There Lucy Ricardo befriended a new neighbor, Betty Ramsey (portrayed by Croft), who was very socially conscious and tended to get Lucy involved in adventures different from those that involved Ethel Mertz (Vivian Vance). Croft had previously guest-starred as Lucy's wealthy schoolmate Cynthia Harcourt in \"Lucy is Envious,\" then as Evelyn Bigsby, the airline passenger seated next to Lucy in \"Return Home from Europe,\" the episode in which Lucy disguises a hunk of cheese as a baby.\n\nWhen Vance left \"The Lucy Show\" after the 1964-1965 season, Croft became Lucy's new sidekick, Mary Jane Lewis. Croft had previously had a recurring role as Audrey Simmons during the show's early seasons set in Danfield, New York. Mary Jane Lewis was Croft's legal name at the time, as she was then married to actor-producer Elliott Lewis (who had originally produced \"The Lucy Show\" during its first two seasons) but continued to use her maiden name professionally. Her only son, by a prior marriage, was killed in the Vietnam War during the period that she was co-starring with Ball.\n\nThe Lewis character was maintained when \"The Lucy Show\" was transformed into Ball's third sitcom, \"Here's Lucy\". The character remained until Ball decided to end \"Here's Lucy\" in 1974.\n\nCroft made an unsold pilot, \"The Two of Us\", that centered on a children's books illustrator. The pilot was produced by Desilu.\n\nCroft continued to act in television for several years after the end of \"Here's Lucy\", even reuniting with Ball in 1977 in the special, \"Lucy Calls the President\". She also returned to radio for several episodes of \"Sears Radio Theater\" in 1979.\n\nShe died of natural causes in Century City, California.\n\nCroft married actor Jack Zoller, but the marriage did not last long, and the couple divorced. She remarried, to Elliott Lewis in 1959. She and Lewis remained wed until Lewis' death in 1990. Croft had a son, Eric, by her first marriage, who was killed in action during the Vietnam War.\n\n"}

It is the first of the monster specific books published by Wizards of the Coast to be made for the 3.5 edition of the game. It cites sources from \"Dragon\" magazine, \"Manual of the Planes\", the \"Planes of Law\" Campaign Expansion, and the first edition of \"Fiend Folio\".\n\nThe book is notable for being published for use with the two main endorsed campaign settings of Forgotten Realms and Eberron with many creatures containing sections explaining where they might be found in the campaign setting.\n\nThe book contained more monsters and was originally published in the v3.5 format. It is notable for its descriptions of where the monsters might be found in the Eberron and Forgotten Realms campaign settings. Chris Perkins explained: \"Almost all of the monsters in the \"Monster Manual III\" are new. We didn't want to give gamers a bunch of beasties they'd already seen, and we found several interesting monster niches to fill. That said, we felt it was important to update some of the yugoloths (canoloth, mezzoloth, nycaloth, and ultraloth) to v.3.5, and we also updated the 1st edition flind, kenku, and susurrus. We also grabbed a handful of monsters from \"Dragon Magazine\".\"\n\n\"Monster Manual III\" was published in 2004, and was designed by Rich Burlew, Eric Cagle, Jesse Decker, Andrew J. Finch, Gwendolyn F.M. Kestrel, Rich Redman, Matthew Sernett, Chris Thomasson, and P. Nathan Toomey. Cover art was by Henry Higgenbotham, with interior art by Dave Allsop, David Bircham, Matt Cavotta, Wayne England, Emily Fiegenschuh, Rafa Garres, Ralph Horsley, Frazer Irving, Rom Lemen, Howard Lyon, Leslie Minnis, Dean Ormston, Lucio Parrillo, Steve Prescott, Vinod Rams, Adam Rex, Wayne Reynolds, Anne Stokes, Mark Tedin, Francis Tsai, Franz Vohwinkel, Anthony Waters, Jonathan Wayshak, Sam Wood, and James Zhang.\n\nThe reviewer from \"Pyramid\" commented: \"The \"Monster Manual III\" suffers from exactly the same problems that any added-on creature collection always suffer from. Many of the monsters are derivative or simply variations on pre-existing creatures. Additionally, there is the problem of springing these monsters into campaigns that have existed for months or years without them. Many creatures have a back story already added for them, allowing for as seamless of an addition to an ongoing campaign as possible, and virtually every creature lists where it frequently occurs in the Wizard's campaign settings of Faerun and Eberron, nice additions for players in those worlds. As is normal with Wizards of the Coast books, the art is routinely excellent, and the pages are well laid out and easy to follow.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "1874744", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1874744", "title": "Delrina", "text": "Delrina\n\nDelrina was a Canadian software company founded in 1988 and subsequently acquired by the American software firm Symantec in 1995. The company sold electronic form products, including PerForm and FormFlow, but was best known for its WinFax software package, which enabled computers equipped with fax modems to transmit copies of documents to standalone fax machines or other similarly equipped computers.\n\nDelrina also produced a set of screensavers, including one that resulted in a well-publicized lawsuit for copyright and trademark infringement (\"Berkeley Systems Inc. v. Delrina\"). The case set a precedent in American law whereby satiric commercial software products are not subject to the same First Amendment exemptions as parodic cartoons or literature.\n\nIt also sold online communications software with its WinComm product and produced a Web browser called Cyberjack. The firm was sold to Symantec in 1995. After the company was acquired by Symantec, various divisions were sold off and several of Delrina's former executives went on to found venture capital firms.\n\nDelrina was founded in Toronto in 1988 by Zimbabwean expatriate Bert Amato, South African expatriates Mark Skapinker and Dennis Bennie and American Lou Ryan. Delrina was Bennie's third major entrepreneurial start up after co-founding Mission Electronics, a high-end home entertainment equipment producer, and Aviva Software, which became Ingram Micro Canada. Delrina's business strategy was to \"establish technical and market leadership in niche markets\", which it accomplished with its electronic form and PC-based fax software. A year before the firm was incorporated, Amato and Skapinker had quit their jobs to start work on an electronic forms product which would eventually become PerForm. Both would later meet with Bennie, who was then the co-founder and CEO of Ingram Micro Canada before becoming CEO of Carolian Systems International, a firm that made business software for Hewlett-Packard. Bennie facilitated an initial seed investment of $1.5 million CAD to finance a new start-up company, \"Delrina\", to develop this idea. In return, Carolian received 51% of Delrina's shares, Dennis Bennie would become Chairman and CEO, Mark Skapinker President, and Bert Amato CTO of newly formed Delrina Technology Inc.\n\nDelrina's initial corporate headquarters was located in a small office on Mount Pleasant Rd. in Toronto. A sales office was set up in San Jose, California which became its worldwide sales center run by co-founder Lou Ryan. From its Toronto headquarters, the company expanded by establishing branch offices in Kirkland, Washington; Washington, DC; and Lexington, Massachusetts. Other offices were later established in the United Kingdom, France, and Germany.\n\nDelrina's initial product offering was an electronic forms application called PerForm. Amato and Skapinker came up with the idea for the product while working as consultants that what their clients wanted was a way to fill in forms electronically, rather than an easier way to create paper-based forms from a computer. There was significant and long-term uptake of electronic forms products within governmental agencies both in Canada and the United States, the latter spurred on in particular by the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act to reduce the total amount of paperwork handled by the United States government. One of the firm's early major software deals included a multi-year agreement to sell PerForm to the U.S. Navy in 1990. Soon after the software was installed on Compaq laptops that accompanied U.S. troops during the First Gulf War, where it was used to requisition \"everything from Coca-Cola to privies\". Other significant volume sales went to 3M and Rockwell International. What helped set apart Delrina's electronic forms from its competitors in product reviews included its easy-to-use interface, its extensive development tools, and its comparatively low price. It also scored highly when it came to workflow and routing functions as well as security features. In early 1991 InfoWorld selected PerForm Pro\nas its \"Product of the Year\" in the electronic forms\ncategory, and PC World Magazine gave the product it's \"Best Buy\" designation. PerForm proved to be successful in its niche, effectively capturing the retail market by 1993.\n\nIn the early 1990s Delrina made deals with value-added resellers like NCR and GE Information Services who had the staff to customize the product to the needs of corporate customers looking to move away from paper-based forms. The forms products sold well and the annual revenues for the firm grew steadily; 1989 annual revenues (in Canadian dollars) were $5,630,393, in 1990 they were $8,759,623, and by 1991 they were $11,894,474.\n\nDespite the growing revenues, the company struggled to make a profit. Heavy expenditures—primarily marketing along with research and development costs—drove the firm's losses from $500,000 from 1989 to $1.5 million by the end of the following fiscal year. For fiscal 1991 it posted a net loss of $1.7 million.\n\nNeeding an infusion of funds, in April 1991 Bennie managed to raise $7.7 million in a private placement.\n\nThe firm subsequently sought to find ways to more widely distribute its electronic form software, with Bennie saying in May 1992 that \"we've barely scratched the surface of our market\".\n\nIn early 1992 word leaked to the press on a possible merger between WordStar International Inc., and soon after both firms made public the fact that they had signed a letter of intent on a merger deal. However, just over a month later word came out that the merger talks had fallen through, at the time cited to differences over \"complex legal, accounting and management issues\". WordStar, whose share of the word processing market had by that time fallen to 5% (from a high of 80%) was seeking Delrina's advanced technologies while Delrina was hoping to utilize the other firm's established global sales network. Despite the failure of the merger talks, Bennie said soon after that \"we're still convinced that a larger sales force would give us the kind of marketing clout we need. I still believe that it's possible for us to become a global operation\". Not long after WordStar merged with Spinnaker Software Corporation and SoftKey Software Products Inc. to form SoftKey International. Delrina subsequently signed deals with Wallace Computer Services, UARCO and NCR Corporation in an effort to gain greater sales distribution of its products.\n\nIn a deliberate attempt to diversify the business, The Company chose to move into the fax software market with its WinFax product. Software developer Tony Davis (another South African expatriate who had moved to Canada) was initially hired as a consultant to work on the forms line of products in the late 1980s, soon afterwards becoming part of that team. In his spare time he developed a prototype of what would become the first WinFax product, with the agreement that Delrina would be its publisher. In 1990 Delrina devoted a relatively small space to this new product at that year's COMDEX (a computer trade show), under a sign that said simply: \"Send a Fax from Your PC\". It garnered the most attention of any Delrina product being demonstrated at that show. This interest convinced the founding partners of the commercial viability of the product. Tony Davis went on to sell his product idea to Delrina, and stayed on as its lead software architect and designer.\n\nThe initial version of WinFax only worked on fax modems containing a specific chipset, and was only capable of sending faxes; it could not receive them. This was remedied with the launch of the WinFax PRO 2.0 product during the summer of 1991. One of the key factors that differentiated this version of WinFax from other fax software packages of the time was the deliberate attempt to make the program compatible with all fax/modems. Prior to the introduction of WinFax PRO 2.0, competitors concentrated primarily on building software that would only work with a single brand of fax/modem hardware. At the same time that it launched its WinFax PRO 2.0 product, Delrina also announced an OEM version of the same product designed to be bundled with new fax/modems. Within a few months, eight modem manufacturers had agreed to bundle this OEM version (called \"WinFax LITE\") of the program along with their own product. By the summer of the following year this number had grown to 50 OEM partnerships with various fax-modem and computer system manufacturers to bundle the \"LITE\" version of Delrina's WinFax software with their own products. By February 1993 this number had grown to over 100 OEM partnerships.\n\nBundling the LITE version of WinFax proved to be lucrative for Delrina. Whenever a person used the program for the first time and submitted their registration information by fax to the company, Delrina would subsequently mail the user an upgrade offer for the PRO version. This sales technique proved to be very effective, and the firm ended up making most of its sales from these upgrades.\n\nIn order to reach Apple computer users in this marketplace Delrina acquired Solutions Inc. and their BackFax software for the Macintosh platform in December 1991, which would become \"Delrina Fax Pro\". A version of the program was also designed for use in DOS (\"DosFax PRO\") which was launched in June 1992.\n\nInitially looking for ways to further improve its electronic forms software, in November 1991 Delrina had attempted to buy two associated firms that produced Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software, with the intention of incorporating OCR functionality into its forms products. The acquisition deal fell through, though by Fall 1992 Delrina had made a deal with Caere Corporation to include its AnyFax OCR software within its products. This functionality was incorporated into WinFax PRO 3.0 in late 1992, and subsequently in FormFlow Despite the agreement with Caere, the subsequent version of WinFax used Xerox's TextBridge OCR engine instead.\n\nBased on strong sales of WinFax, by October 1992 Delrina posted its first profitable quarter in three years. At the same time, the firm also announced its intention to acquire other software firms that sold into the consumer software market.\n\nIn October 1992 Delrina acquired Amaze Inc., based out of Kirkland, Washington. The firm created daily planner software, providing time management features while providing some humour by featuring licensed cartoon strips like Cathy, Bloom County, B.C. and The Far Side. The firm became a wholly owned subsidiary of Delrina in a deal which also paid down Amaze's $3 million (U.S.) debt and placed two of the firm's directors on Delrina's board. These two individuals were Rowland Hanson, former VP Corporate Communications for Microsoft and George Clut.\n\nOne of Delrina's screensaver products was based on the licensed Bloom County characters Opus the Penguin and Bill the Cat. The initial \"Opus 'n Bill\" screensaver, launched in 1993, landed the company in court as its \"Death Toasters\" module depicted Opus taking shots at a number of flying toasters, a well-known emblem in Berkeley System's \"Flying Toasters\" module from their After Dark screensaver.\nBerkeley Systems sued for copyright and trademark infringement. The following court case of \"Berkeley Systems Inc. v. Delrina\" was fought by Delrina on the basis that a software-based parody should fall under the same First Amendment protection offered to the press.\n\nA preliminary injunction was filed against Delrina in September 1993 which halted the sale of the product, and subsequently forced a recall of it through the court. The case drew political satirist Mark Russell to speak in defense of Delrina, who argued in favour of the screensaver as a valid parody, while the estate of composer Irving Berlin sided with Berkeley. Commenting on the case involving his characters, cartoonist Berkeley Breathed said: \"If David Letterman can depict the NBC peacock wearing men's boxer shorts, then Delrina should be able to plug a flying toaster with hot lead\".\n\nJudge Eugene Lynch found in favour of Berkeley, citing that a commercial software product was not subject to the same exemptions as parodist literature, and that the toasters were too similar in design. The total cost of the court case and the recalled product was roughly $150,000 U.S.\n\nIn the court case, it was also cited that the design for winged toasters was not original and that the Berkeley Systems' design was itself derived from the Jefferson Airplane album \"Thirty Seconds Over Winterland\", which also used flying toasters adorned with wings. Berkeley argued that the firm was unaware of the previous artwork until 1991, and that the album cover's toasters had clocks in addition to their wings. Jefferson Airplane later sued Berkeley Systems in turn for the use of the same flying toaster emblem. The rock group lost the case as they did not trademark the album cover at the time of publication.\n\nThe court decision was interpreted by the writer L. Ray Patterson as an erosion of First Amendment rights over the increasing protection provided to copyright holders.\n\nWhile Delrina lost the court case, the publicity it generated was substantial, with coverage in over a thousand newspapers across North America, resulting in consumers turning out in droves to buy the offending program before it could be recalled.\n\nDelrina subsequently removed the wings from the toasters and replaced them with propellers in order to avoid trademark infringement. The module was also renamed from \"Death Toasters\" to \"Censored Toaster Module\". Thanks to the publicity from the court case, sales of this new version ended up being triple what had been expected. Updated modules for this particular screensaver were sold for the next couple of years.\n\nJosef Zankowicz, who managed the firm's publicity during this period, later commented: \"We had the feeling that we might get sued—actually, we prayed to get sued. Because by suing us, the number one player in the marketplace opened up the door. Anyone can create an interesting product, spend $10 million and create awareness of it. But it's another thing to create a product and spend one-tenth that amount and create twice as much awareness.\"\n\nThis division of the firm at its height only represented less than 15% of the company's total revenues.\n\nThe increasing sales of the WinFax product lead to significant growth in revenues for the firm; by 1992 its sales had climbed to $19,208,420, and more than doubling the next year to $48,583,932. The product soon overtook that of the initial forms product in terms of revenues, and within a few years of its launch, WinFax would account for 80% of the company's revenues. By 1994 the firm had sold more than 3 million copies of WinFax, and it regularly featured in the \"Top 10\" lists of software applications sold during this period.\n\nThe rapid growth in sales of this product was unexpected, with Bennie quoted in an interview from late 1993 as saying \"the success of WinFax really caught us by surprise\". With the success of the WinFax product, the company grew rapidly. By early 1993 the number of employees had grown to 250, and by the end of the year to 350. The increasing success of the WinFax product consequently led to significant strains on the firm to handle the increasing volume of calls to its Technical Support department, as each of the over 300 modems on the market at the time had their own nuances in how they implemented the fax data standard. Delrina spent roughly $800,000 in an improved telephone infrastructure in an attempt to get wait times to under five minutes. In December 1993 Delrina hired 40 additional people to help alleviate the growing number of calls to the firm for technical support. By the end of 1994 the situation had improved to the point where noted industry commentator Robert X. Cringely put Delrina in his shortlist of firms providing \"exceptional\" product support.\n\nIn order to further enhance the appeal of its new flagship product, in 1993 the firm established a Communication Services division, designed to tap into the commercial market. The firm started making deals with major telecommunication companies, such as BellSouth and MCI Inc. in preparation for the services the firm was about to offer. In November of that year the division launched its Fax Broadcast service. The Fax Broadcast service allowed subscribers to upload a single fax and a recipient list to Delrina. Systems at Delrina would then send out the fax to the recipients on that list, to a maximum of 500 fax numbers. A subsequent Fax Mailbox feature—which enabled subscribers to remotely access both fax and voice messages from a single phone number—was initially held up following a dispute with AlphaNet Telecom for the rights to the technology. This dispute was resolved by June 1994, though with both sides publicly disputing the story of the other, and with AlphaNet receiving an undisclosed sum in compensation.\n\nBy late 1994 the firm was considered one of the fastest-growing software companies in North America, and employed over 500 people, most located at its offices in Toronto. The firm's financial situation improved greatly, and by February 1995 Delrina was reported to have captured almost three-quarters of the fax software market, was debt-free and had $40 million in the bank. The firm was shipping 200,000 units of WinFax a month, and had an installed base of four million users. The cost of doing business had also improved, as the firm's cost of sales was now 25% of net sales, down from 30% the previous fiscal year, improving the firm's gross profits.\n\nIn November 1992 Skapinker met Bill Gates at a Microsoft-sponsored dinner where he asked whether there were any plans to include any fax functionality in their forthcoming operating system (which could become Windows 95). Gates replied that there were plans to include \"base-level fax capability\" in the next version of Windows, and suggested that Skapinker get in touch with his development staff in order to produce a value-added product for it.\n\nThe firm decided to work on a suite of applications designed to be an enhancement on what was to be available in Windows 95. In response to a question about Windows 95, Bennie responded by saying: \"We are quite convinced that on top of Windows 95, we can build four different applications and will encompass fax, data, telephony or digital voice, and Internet access\". This would later become the CommSuite 95 product.\n\nIn 1994 the firm acquired AudioFile, a company that specialized in computer-based voice technology. The company created a product called TalkWorks, which enabled users to use certain fax/modems as a voice mail client.\n\nSeeing a growing business in online communications utilities, Delrina licensed Hilgraeve's HyperACCESS terminal emulator system in 1993, and used it as the basis for the initial version of its WinComm online communications software. The initial version of the product was originally bundled with WinFax as part of the Delrina Communications Suite, but in March 1994 was issued as a standalone product. It was a relative latecomer to the market, which was then dominated at the time by Datastorm's Procomm series of communications software.\n\nDelrina tried to expand aggressively into this market space, first by acquiring the Canadian online bulletin board service CRS Online, and then using it as a distribution channel for free versions of its WinComm LITE and DOS-based FreeComm products in March 1995.\n\nWhen the Internet was opened to commercial interests in the mid-1990s, Delrina started to expand in this nascent market space with their Cyberjack 7.0 product, launched in December 1995. Created by a development team based in South Africa, it included a Web browser, Usenet news reader, ftp client, IRC and integration with the Microsoft Exchange email program. The program used an interesting variant of the now-common bookmark, using a \"Guidebook\" to store information for various Internet addresses.\n\nCommSuite 95 shipped later that same month, bundling WinFax PRO 7.0 along with WinComm PRO 7.0, TalkWorks and the Cyberjack suite of Internet components.\n\nWith the release of Windows 95 in August 1995, Delrina was now competing directly against Microsoft in the fax/electronic communications marketplace, as Windows 95 included a basic faxing application as an accessory, along with a licensed version of Hilgraeve's HyperTerminal communication package, (which was also used as the basis for Delrina's own WinComm program). While these applications offered only rudimentary fax and online communication services in comparison to the mature Delrina products, Microsoft was perceived as a potentially serious future competitor in the communications market space. The release of the initial version of Microsoft's Internet Explorer in late 1995 as a free product effectively killed off the early emerging market for non-free browsers, creating a market where Delrina's Cyberjack browser could not hope to compete.\n\nIn late Spring of 1995, Delrina Chairman Dennis Bennie met with Symantec CEO Gordon Eubanks to discuss the possibility of merging the two firms. In September 1995 Delrina's founders—who owned a controlling interest in the firm—sold the firm to Symantec in a stock deal worth $415 million US. The deal was first announced on July 6 of that year, with shareholders from both firms approving the merger on November 20. The merger was completed on November 22, 1995 and Delrina officially became part of Symantec. The deal made the merged company the fifth largest American software firm at the time. The firm became the \"Delrina Group\" within Symantec, which brought under its control other communication software products that belonged to the parent firm, such as pcAnywhere. Bennie joined the Board of Symantec and was also appointed an Executive Vice President.\n\nAt its height the company employed more than 700 people worldwide, the majority based in Canada. Symantec was following a general trend of large American firms buying smaller Canadian software companies. Other contemporaneous examples include Softimage and Zoom-it being bought by Microsoft, and Alias being bought by Silicon Graphics.\n\nParts of the company were subsequently sold off, such as the sale of Delrina's Electronic Forms Division to JetForm in September 1996. JetForm, which later changed its name to Accelio, was in turn bought by Adobe Systems. Adobe officially discontinued the electronic forms products in 2004. Creative Wonders bought the rights to the Echo Lake multimedia product, which was re-shaped as an introductory program on multimedia and re-released as Family Album Creator.\n\nThough the market for fax software would shrink significantly as the use of email became more pervasive, WinFax brought in significant revenue for Symantec; a year after the merger sales of fax software accounted for 10% of Symantec's revenues.\n\nDelrina was a catalyst for entrepreneurial talent and greatness, as many of the principals and employees of Delrina went on to find new successful ventures. With investments from Skapinker and Amato, and Bennie as lead Director, Davis went on to form Lanacom, which developed an early Internet \"push content\" product. This firm and its technology were sold just over a year after its inception to Backweb, a NASDAQ listed software company; Davis remained president and Bennie was brought on as Director.\n\nSkapinker and Davis then went on to found Brightspark, a software venture capital firm. Brightspark Ventures raised a number of VC Funds from Canadian Financial institutions raising $60m in 1999 and $55m in 2004. Brightspark employed a number of ex-Delrina employees including Allen Lau, Eva Lau, Sandy Pearlman, Marg Vaillancourt. Brightspark Ventures has twice won the Canadian Venture Capital Association \"Deal of the Year Award\", for the sale of ThinkDynamics to IBM and for the sale of Radian6 to Salesforce.com.\n\nBennie would move on to found XDL Capital, a company which manages venture capital funds. XDL Capital—appropriately named after \"Ex Delrina\"—raised money for two funds: XDL Ventures (XDL), raising $25 million in 1997, and XDL Intervest (XDLI), raising $155 million in 1999. David Latner, former legal counsel for Delrina, was a partner in both funds, and Amato (former partner, Delrina) was an advisor and major investor to XDL Capital. He also participated in several investee companies as a Director and/or Advisor.\n\nXDL Intervest focuses primarily on internet-specific entrepreneurial companies and Bennie brought in two new principals: Tony Van Marken, former CEO of Architel Systems Corp. (ASYC), and Michael Bregman, former CEO of Second Cup Ltd. (T.SKL). XDL has assembled an established board and advisory team, which includes Canadian billionaire Robert Young, a native of Hamilton, Ontario, who co-founded Red Hat Inc (RHAT) and remains its chairman. Several of XDL's venture investments were in companies started or run by ex-Delrina employees who founded successful businesses, fostered by the innovative and entrepreneurial environment of Delrina. A few of the successes today are listed below:\n\nDelano Founded by Bahman Koohestani, another early developer at Delrina, was a company which developed e-business solutions for corporations. XDL Capital provided seed capital prior to Delano listing publicly. Bennie was the Chairman. Delano was listed on NASDAQ (DTEC) was subsequently sold to divine in 2003.\n\nPinpoint Software Corporation a supplier of software solutions for managing networked PCs, was founded in 1992 by Lou Ryan. Ryan was CEO & President with Bennie acting as director. Pinpoint was partially funded by XDL Capital. Pinpoint changed its name to ClickNet Software in 1998. Uniting the company name with the successful ClickNet product family name strengthens the product and corporate identity. The company was eventually renamed Entercept Security Technologies Inc. In 2004, Entercept was sold to Network Associates for $120M where they incorporated Entercept's technology into its McAfee line of antivirus protection and other security products.\n\nProtégé Software was formed in 1996 and was founded by Larry Levy, Delrina's European Managing Director. Levy acted as President and CEO with Bennie as the principal investor. The company raised a $120M round of finance with XDL Intervest participating in 2003. Protégé has successfully launched 20 U.S. companies in Europe, nine of which are among Red Herring Top 50 Private Companies. In addition, five of these companies have gone public during Protégé's tenure with them. The company was ultimately sold to various buyers including Warburg Pincus after the internet bubble burst.\n\nNetect Ltd., an XDL financed venture developing network security software, was purchased by Bindview Development Corporation (NASDAQ:BVEW) in 2001. Marc Camm (Ex Delrina GM Desktop Communications Business Unit) was brought on by Bennie to manage Netect. After the Company was purchased, Camm joined Bindview as the E.V.P. of Marketing. Prior to joining Netect, Marc was the general manager of Symantec and systems group product manager for Microsoft Canada.\n\nWithin a few years all of Delrina's major market focuses—fax and form software—would be overtaken or superseded by email, e-commerce and the Internet. Daily planning software remains a niche market, and the immersive 3D environment used for creating multimedia presentations has (so far) fallen by the wayside in favour of more traditional user interfaces. Symantec ended support for its final WinFax PRO product in June 2006.\n\nDelrina is best remembered by its former employees as an incubator for ideas and for providing industry experience to the many people who would go on to work at subsequent software and hardware companies, many in the Toronto region. A forum exists on Yahoo called \"xdelrina\", where many former employees of the firm continue to keep in contact with each other.\n\nThe company's first product was PerForm, an electronic forms software package. PerForm and its sibling product, FormFlow, (which was aimed at workgroup and enterprise-level electronic forms processing and delivery) became one of the best selling products in its market. Delrina competed against WordPerfect's Informs package, Microsoft's Electronic Forms Designer, Novell's Informs, Lotus Software's Forms and JetForm's JetForm Workflow software.\n\nPerForm and FormFlow were designed to allow users to create self-contained form applications which could be passed back and forth across a network. Both PerForm and FormFlow consisted of two distinct parts: \"Designer\", which created the form application, and \"Filler\", so users could submit the forms either by fax or, later, e-mail. The program could ease repetitive fill tasks, include mandatory fields, and use an input mask to accept only data entered in a valid format. The information could be saved and restored in a dBase file that used a Public-key cryptography system to encrypt the data running from client to server.\n\nThe initial version of PerForm was designed for the Graphics Environment Manager (better known as \"GEM\"), a DOS-based windowing system. Later versions of this program, known as PerForm PRO, were designed to work under Windows 3.1 and subsequent Windows operating systems. PerForm PRO 3.0 included integration with Delrina's own WinFax software, and included a range of automation tools.\n\nAs PerForm captured the retail market, it became apparent that there was a need for electronics forms delivery and processing at the workgroup and enterprise levels. In 1994 Delrina FormFlow was released, which was designed to meet this need. One of the key features of FormFlow 1.1 was forms integration with email, and its Filler module was available for DOS, Windows and Unix.\n\nWinFax enabled computers equipped with fax-modems to send faxes directly to stand-alone fax machines or other similarly equipped computers.\n\nSeveral versions of the WinFax product were released over the next few years, initially for Windows 3.x and then a Windows 95-based version. WinFax PRO 2.0 for Windows was released in July 1991. The Windows versions were also localized to major European and Asian languages. The company made further in-roads by establishing tie-ins with modem manufacturers such as U.S. Robotics and Supra that bundled simple versions of the product (called \"WinFax LITE\") that offered basic functionality. Those wanting more robust features were encouraged to upgrade to the \"PRO\" version, and were offered significant discounts over the standalone retail version. All of this rapidly established WinFax as the de facto fax software. By 1994 almost one hundred companies were bundling versions of WinFax in with their own product, including IBM, Compaq, AST Research, Gateway 2000, Intel and Hewlett-Packard.\n\nWinFax PRO 3.0 was launched in late 1992 for Windows 3.x machines. This was followed by a version for Macintosh systems. The \"Lite\" version of WinFax 3.0 was bundled as OEM software by a number of fax-modem manufacturers, which was later be superseded by WinFax Lite 4.0 a couple of years later.\n\nThe release of WinFax PRO 4.0 in March 1994 brought together a number of key features and technologies. It introduced an improved OCR engine, introduced improvements aimed specifically at mobile fax users, better on-screen fax viewing capabilities and a focus on consistency and usability of the interface. It also included for the first time the ability to integrate directly with popular new email products such as and Microsoft Mail. It was preceded by a Workgroup version of the same product, which allowed a number of users to share a single fax modem on a networked system. The stand-alone version of the product was also later bundled with a grayscale scanner, and sold as WinFax Scanner.\n\nThe final Delrina-branded version of WinFax was WinFax PRO 7.0, which shipped in late 1995, the subsequent version 8.0 being a Symantec product. There was no intervening version 5.0 or 6.0, and the jump to version 7.0 was purely a marketing decision, based on keeping up with the suite of products in Microsoft Office which were then at the same number. It also reflected the development effort required to develop the first full 32-bit application version, designed to work with the Windows 95 operating system, which set it apart from its competition at the time.\n\nBy the time WinFax PRO 7.0 was being sold from retail shelves, Delrina had been acquired by Symantec.\n\nScreensavers were designed to ensure that there would be no phosphor burn-in of images left on a CRT-based screen. Delrina added sound and basic interactivity with its series of screensaver products, arguably qualifying it as an early form of multimedia.\n\nUnder Delrina several of the already-licensed cartoons brought over from their acquisition of Amaze Inc. were further developed into screensaver applications. The \"Opus 'n Bill Brain Saver\", which would land the company in court for copyright violations, was launched in 1993. Subsequent screensavers include a licensed version based on the first Flintstone live-action movie, and \"The Scott Adams Dilbert Screen Saver Collection\" which came out in September 1994.\n\nA notable multimedia software program produced by Delrina was Echo Lake, an early form of scrapbook software that came out in June 1995. During development it was touted internally as a \"cross [of] Quark Xpress and Myst\". It featured an immersive 3D environment where a user could manipulate objects within a virtual desktop in a virtual office and assemble video and audio clips along with images, and then send them as either a virtual book other users of the program could then access, or its content could be printed. It was an innovative product for its time, and ultimately was hampered by the inability of many users to easily input or playback their own multimedia content into a computer from that period.\n"}

It is one of the most important cities on the island, with a very active port and many ecotourism attractions. The city is also a centre of sugar production and industry.\n\nSince the 18th century, the region was occupied by fishermen and people that came here to cut trees. When Toussaint L'Ouverture took the eastern part of the Hispaniola island in the name of France, he gave the order to create the town of Barahona in 1802 as part of the Ozama Department. After the Independence in 1844, Barahona was a military post of the Azua Province.\n\nIn 1858, Barahona was elevated to the category of municipality. When the province was created in 1881, Barahona was made its head municipality.\n\nUnder the Köppen climate classification, Barahona has a tropical savanna climate. Temperatures tend to remains steady throughout the year, with mean temperatures ranging from a low of in January to a high of in July. In terms of dry and wet seasons, Barahona has two distinctive wet seasons with a peak in precipitation from May to June followed by drought-like conditions in July and August (due to the Azores high being located in the central Atlantic, inhibiting the formation of clouds and rain) and another peak in precipitation from September to October. This precipitation pattern is due to the movement and the position of the Azores high throughout the year. The dry season mainly runs through December to April. Even in the drier months, precipitation can still occur with February receiving just under . Sunshine is abundant throughout the year, averaging over 3200 hours.\n\nThe main economic activity of the province is agriculture; the main product in the municipality is a very good coffee (\"Barahona Type Coffee\"), grown in the mountains of Eastern Bahoruco.\n\nThere are also some important industries, mainly to produce textiles to send to other countries, and sugar in the Ingenio Barahona (\"Barahona Sugar Factory\").\n\nAlthough Barahona does not have a highly developed transportation system, the city has a sea port, which receives many ferries from different points in the Caribbean, and an airport, which has been reactivated with many flights a week to Punta Cana via Santo Domingo. Authorities provided the airport with a fuel station park, allowing facilities to the airliners that could operate in the airport in the future. The airport is the well known Maria Montez International Airport located about 10 minutes from the city center. The port is located about 5 minutes away from the city center.\n\n"}
{"id": "1874769", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1874769", "title": "Bere Island", "text": "Bere Island\n\nBere Island (, although officially called \"An tOileán Mór\" meaning \"the big island\") is an island off the Beara Peninsula in County Cork, Ireland. It is roughly 10 km x 3 km in dimension, with an area of 17.68 km², and, as of 2012, had a population of between 210 and 220 people.\n\nLegend says that the island was named by a 2nd-century king of Munster, Mogh Nuadat, in honour of his wife, Beara, the daughter of Heber Mór, King of Castile.\n\nEarly traces of human occupation include megalithic tombs and standing stones. The island was the property of the O'Sullivan Bere clan and remained so until the power of the Gaelic chieftains was finally broken in 1602. This period also saw the first military interest in the island when Sir George Carew ordered a road to be built across the island to transport the pro-English forces to the Siege of Dunboy.\n\nIn December 1796, a French fleet entered Bantry Bay and Berehaven Harbour, led by General Hoche under the direction of Wolfe Tone, the leader of the United Irishmen. The French longboat which landed in Bere Island is now in the National Museum of Ireland. Adverse winds prevented the main force landing and eventually caused the fleet to disperse and return home. In August 1798, there was a further invasion attempt, at Killala in County Mayo, following the Irish Rebellion of that year. The result of these events was that the British authorities reviewed their defensive plans and in 1803, with the country once again at war with France, Lieutenant-Colonel William Twiss was sent to Ireland to draw up a plan of defence for the country. As part of this review he was directed to examine what security could be given to Bantry Bay.\n\nRear-Admiral Sir Robert Calder, who commanded the naval squadron based in Castletownbere Port wrote to the Rt. Hon. William Wickham on 22 December 1803 to request protection for his victualers and store ships, which were to be based at the Berehaven anchorage to supply his squadron. Wickham agreed that protection for the ships was necessary and instructed William Cathcart, 1st Earl Cathcart to order his engineers to carry out works to build Martello Towers on the island. The Bere Island towers were reported as ready on 2 February 1805 and were therefore probably among the earliest Martello Towers to be completed in Ireland. The four, all circular in shape and built of rubble masonry, were sited to defend the anchorage between the mainland and the small harbour of Lawrence Cove on Bere Island. In addition to the Martello Towers, a signal tower, a barracks for 2 officers and 150 men, a quay and storehouses were also constructed. After the end of the Napoleonic Wars there followed a period of military stagnation. This ended in 1898 when the British military raised a compulsory purchase order on large areas of the island in order to construct additional fortifications in order to protect the British Fleet at anchor in Berehaven Harbour.\n\nDuring the Anglo-Irish War some Irish republicans were interned on Bere Island, including Canon William Kennedy, head (from 1919-1932) of St Flannan's College, Ennis. In 1922, under the terms of the Anglo-Irish Treaty that followed the Irish War of Independence, the British withdrew from most of Ireland but three deep water Treaty Ports, at Berehaven, Queenstown (renamed Cobh), and Lough Swilly, were retained as sovereign bases until 1938.\nEvidence of more ancient settlement on the island include the remains of a circular enclosure (at Greenane), a hut site (Ardaragh West), a promontory fort, a ringfort (at Cloonaghlin West, Greenane), a collapsed wedge tomb (Ardaragh West), and standing stone (at Greenane).\n\nRuins and remains relating to the island's military history include the remains of an artillery battery (Ardaragh West, Cloonaghlin West), Martello tower (Ardaragh West, Cloonaghlin West), a telegraph station, and a signal tower (at Derrycreeveen).\n\nThe wreckage of the Bardini Reefer lies just north of the island. It sank on the 12th of December 1982 after burning for several days\n\nThe island is located between Berehaven Harbour and Bantry Bay in the western part of County Cork, about 1.5 km off the port of Castletownbere. It belongs to the civil parish of Killaconenagh (\"Cill Eacha Naoineach\") in the barony of Bear. \nThe highest point on the island is Knockanallig, at a height of 270 metres. The main harbour is Lawrence Cove, near the main village of Rerrin (Raerainn), toward the eastern end of the island. The church and its graveyard are located in Ballinakilla.\n\nTen of the 75 townlands of the civil parish of Killaconenagh are located on the island. These include Ardra West, Ardra East, Ballinakilla (with St Michael's Roman Catholic church and graveyard and nearby pub), Cloonaghlin West, Cloonaghlin Upper, Cloonaghlin Lower, Derrycreeveen, Greenane, Ardagh and Rerrin.\n\nThe island is served by two ferries both of which can carry light vehicles. One sails between Castletownbere and the west of the Island while the other serves Pontoon (a pier about 2km east of Castletownbere along the R572) and Rerrin village \n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic in Ireland, in conjunction with other \"isolation\" efforts, the island's ferry services were curtailed, with only residents permitted to board in order to prevent the virus from reaching the island.\n\nWork started on providing mains electricity to the island via submarine cable in July 1957 and was completed in April 1958\n\nA local radio station broadcasts for a few hours on Sundays from a small transmitter on the island on 100.1MHz FM\n\nAs of 2012, the population was approximately 200, but the past population was significantly higher. At the time of the 1841 census the population was 2,122. However, by the 1851 census the population had decreased to 1,454 due to the Great Famine. The population decline continued in line with the national trend for emigration throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. Unlike many of the other islands off the Irish coast, the inhabitants of Bere Island are native speakers of English. Irish was reported as being spoken by certain islanders in the 1911 census. \n\n"}

A remake of the game, retitled Cosmic Spacehead, was released in 1993 for Amiga, MS-DOS, Sega Game Gear, Master System, and Genesis. The game features adventure elements, with locations connected by platform sections.\n\nThe game is the sequel to \"Linus Spacehead\", which was released exclusively as part of the compilation \"Quattro Adventure\".\n\nLinus is an alien from the planet Linoleum who crashed into the legendary planet Earth. After returning home and expecting a hero's welcome, Linus soon found his fellow Linomen were skeptical of the existence of the so-called \"planet Earth\" and decides to return to it, this time with a camera. However, he has no money (Linoleum currency is the Linobuck), and must adventure around the planet to acquire a vehicle and a camera. In his adventures, Linus leaves Linoleum (using a fake ID for Larry Flynt to compete in a bumper car contest), quashes a robot revolution in \"Detroitica\" and gets gas from an abandoned space station.\n\nThe game is similar to prior titles such as Maniac Mansion (1987) and later titles such as Day of the Tentacle (1993), being an adventure game in which items must be collected and later used in specific locations in order to progress. The player's character is directed during much of the game with the use of a cursor and written commands. It also includes numerous short platforming sections, as well as other mini-games and puzzles.\n\nEach major location of Planet Linoleum has a teleporting device, which can be activated using a card. However, they often leave Linus with a side-effect, required to complete a puzzle. To travel between adventure sections, Linus goes through arcade sections, where he has to reach the other side of the level, avoiding free falls, enemies and collecting Cosmic candy at the same time (after collecting 10, an extra life is added). Linus dies upon contact with enemies, so instead of speed-running (which can be done, since the levels are small), it may be more advisable to learn his foes' movement patterns and wait for a safe opening. This is particularly true in NES \"Linus Spacehead's Cosmic Crusade\", where Linus cannot change direction in mid-jump. Passwords are scattered at key locations.\n\nLike other Codemasters games, the NES versions were not licensed by Nintendo. \"Linus Spacehead's Cosmic Crusade\" was released both as a stand-alone cartridge and as one of seven games for the Aladdin Deck Enhancer. At least in Europe, a later/updated version of the game was released as \"Cosmic Spacehead\". There are several differences between that and the earlier version. \"Cosmic Spacehead\" includes the \"Pie Slap\" mode, and Linus can jump higher and change direction in mid-jump, which makes the platform arcade sections easier. The Mega Drive version was also included in a Codemasters \"2-in-1\" cartridge with \"Fantastic Dizzy\".\n\nAll but \"Linus Spacehead's Cosmic Crusade\" include a two player mode named \"Pie Slap\", reminiscent of \"Armor Ambush\" for the Atari 2600. While the Master System version is similar in graphics to the NES version, the gameplay is closer to the remaining versions. In the Amiga, Mega Drive and MS-DOS versions, the art style is different from the NES version.\n\n\"GamePro\" described the Game Gear version as \"a great point-and-click text adventure\", additionally praising the cartoonish charm of the graphics.\n"}

Article III, Section 1 of the Constitution of Florida, adopted in 1968, defines the role of the Legislature and how it is to be constituted. The Senate is composed of 40 members, each elected from a single-member district with a population of approximately 470,000 residents. Legislative districts are drawn on the basis of population figures, provided by the federal decennial census. Senators' terms begin immediately, upon their election. The Senate Chamber is located in the State Capitol building.\n\nAs of 2018, Republicans hold the majority in the chamber with 23 seats; Democrats are in the minority with 17 seats.\n\nMembers of the Senate are referred to as Senators. Because this shadows the terminology used to describe member of U.S. Senate, constituents and the news media, using \"The Associated Press Stylebook\", often refer to them as State Senators to avoid confusion with their Federal counterparts.\n\nArticle III, of the Florida Constitution, defines the terms for State Legislators.\n\nThe Constitution requires State Senators from odd-numbered districts to be elected in the years that end in numbers of which are multiples of four. Senators from even-numbered districts are required to be elected in even-numbered years the numbers of which are not multiples of four.\n\nTo reflect the results of the U.S. Census and the redrawing of district boundaries, all seats are up for election in redistricting years, with some terms truncated as a result. Thus, senators in even-numbered districts were elected to two-year terms in 2012 (following the 2010 Census), and senators in odd-numbered districts will be elected to two-year terms in 2022 (following the 2020 Census).\n\nAll terms were truncated again in 2016, with all 40 Senate seats up for election, due to court-ordered redistricting.\n\nLegislators take office immediately, upon election.\n\nOn November 3, 1992, almost 77% of Florida voters backed Amendment 9, the Florida Term Limits Amendment, which amended the Florida State Constitution, to enact eight-year term limits on federal and state officials. Under the Amendment, former members could be elected again after a two-year break. In 1995, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that states could not enact congressional term limits, but ruled that the state-level term limits could remain.\n\nFlorida legislators must be at least twenty-one years old, an elector and resident of their district, and must have resided in Florida for at least two years prior to election.\n\nEach year during which the Legislature meets constitutes a new Legislative Session.\n\nLegislators start Committee activity in September of the year prior to the Regular Legislative Session. Because Florida is a part-time legislature, this is necessary to allow legislators time to work their bills through the Committee process, prior to the Regular Legislative Session.\n\nThe Florida Legislature meets in a 60-day Regular Legislative Session each year. Regular Legislative Sessions in odd-numbered years must begin on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in March. Under the State Constitution, the Legislature can begin even-numbered year Regular Legislative Sessions at a time of its choosing.\n\nPrior to 1991, the Regular Legislative Session began in April. Senate Joint Resolution 380 (1989) proposed to the voters a Constitutional Amendment (approved November 1990) that shifted the starting date of Regular Legislative Session from April to February. Subsequently, Senate Joint Resolution 2606 (1994) proposed to the voters a Constitutional Amendment (approved November 1994) shifting the start date to March, where it remains. The reason for the \"first Tuesday after the first Monday\" requirement stems back to the time when Regular Legislative Session began in April. Regular Legislative Session could start any day from April 2 through April 8, but never on April 1 -- April Fool's Day. In recent years, the Legislature has opted to start in January in order to allow lawmakers to be home with their families during school spring breaks, and to give more time ahead of the legislative elections in the Fall.\n\nOn the fourteenth day following each General Election, the Legislature meets for an Organizational Session to organize and select officers.\n\nSpecial Legislative Sessions may be called by the Governor, by a joint proclamation of the Senate President and House Speaker, or by a three-fifths vote of all Legislators. During any Special Session the Legislature may only address legislative business that is within the purview of the purpose or purposes stated in the Special Session Proclamation.\n\nThe Florida Senate is authorized by the Florida Constitution to create and amend the laws of the U.S. state of Florida, subject to the Governor's power to veto legislation. To do so, Legislators propose legislation in the forms of bills drafted by a nonpartisan, professional staff. Successful legislation must undergo Committee review, three readings on the floor of each house, with appropriate voting majorities, as required, and either be signed into law by the Governor or enacted through a veto override approved by two-thirds of the membership of each legislative house.\n\nIts statutes, called \"chapter laws\" or generically as \"slip laws\" when printed separately, are compiled into the \"Laws of Florida\" and are called \"session laws\". The \"Florida Statutes\" are the codified statutory laws of the state.\n\nIn 2009, legislators filed 2,138 bills for consideration. On average, the Legislature has passed about 300 bills into law annually.\n\nIn 2013, the legislature filed about 2000 bills. About 1000 of these are \"member bills.\" The remainder are bills by committees responsible for certain functions, such as budget. In 2016, about 15% of the bills were passed.\nIn 2017, 1,885 lobbyists registered to represent 3,724 entities.\n\nThe Senate also has the power to propose Amendments to the Florida Constitution. Additionally, the Senate has the exclusive power to try officials impeached by the House, and to confirm some executive appointments.\n\nThe Senate is headed by the Senate President. The Senate President controls the assignment of committees and leadership positions, along with control of the agenda in their chamber. The Senate President, along with the Speaker of the House and Governor, control most of the agenda of state business in Florida.\n\n\n\n"}

Fronted by Alex Harvey accompanied by Zal Cleminson on guitar, bassist Chris Glen, keyboard player Hugh McKenna and drummer Ted McKenna, their music veered from glam rock to experimental jazz, around a core of experimental and avant-garde rock, dealing with themes from environmentalism to chinese take away food. While they achieved a critically acclaimed status in the UK & Scotland, they struggled to make a huge impact in the United States.\n\nIn August 1972, Alex Harvey formed The Sensational Alex Harvey Band (often shortened to SAHB) with guitarist Zal Cleminson, bassist Chris Glen, and cousins Hugh and Ted McKenna on keyboards and drums respectively, all previous members of progressive rock act Tear Gas. \n\nAfter some time, they adopted iconic stage costumes. More specifically, Alex Harvey started to wear vaudeville-like clothes and his trademark striped shirt, while Zal Cleminson assumed the identity of a \"mime\" in full make-up and green-yellow jumpsuit, and Chris Glen wore a dark blue jumpsuit reminiscent of a superhero costume incorporating lighter blue trunks.\n\nSAHB produced a succession of highly regarded albums and tours throughout the 1970s. The band never achieved acclaim in the United States the way it did in Great Britain, but it had a cult following in certain US cities, especially Cleveland, where the group first played at the Agora Ballroom in December 1974. Thanks to airplay from WMMS, songs like \"Next\" and \"The Faith Healer\" became very popular. Cleveland remained a city where The Sensational Alex Harvey Band had a devoted following. However, they were unable to replicate that popularity in most other US cities.\n\nThe Sensational Alex Harvey Band had Top 40 hits in Britain with the single \"Delilah\", a cover version of the Tom Jones hit, which reached number seven in 1975, and also with \"The Boston Tea Party\" in June 1976.\n\nAfter Harvey left the group later that year, in 1976 the other members continued with the moniker \"SAHB (without Alex)\". They launched a new album titled \"Fourplay\" in February 1977, today regarded as the seventh official SAHB record. The album steered towards a solid pop-rock with some slight prog influences.\nHarvey re-joined the group in mid-1977, while Hugh McKenna left. The Sensational Alex Harvey Band then recorded 1978's \"Rock Drill\", with Tommy Eyre replacing Hugh McKenna. They disbanded shortly afterwards.\n\nHarvey died of heart failure on 4 February 1982 in Belgium.\n\nIn 1992, Chris Glen, Zal Cleminson and Ted McKenna banded together to form \"The Party Boys\" which featured guest vocalists such as FISH, Dan McCafferty, and Stevie Doherty with Stone The Crows keyboardist Ronnie Leahy. This band lasted about one year before they decided to recruit keyboard player Hugh McKenna and finally reform as SAHB. They also released a live album \"Live in Glasgow 1993\" featuring Stevie Doherty on vocals. This line-up of SAHB disbanded in 1995, before reforming in 2002 for a tribute night to Frankie Miller at The Barrowlands in Glasgow with ex-Nazareth guitarist Billy Rankin on vocals. After a year \"Mad\" Max Maxwell replaced Rankin on vocals.\n\nSAHB released a new live album titled \"Zalvation\", which was their first official release since \"Rock Drill\" in 1978, and an autobiography called \"SAHB Story\", written by former tour manager and author Martin Keilty. The band performed numerous tours and festivals across UK, Europe, and Australia before once again disbanding in 2008 after the departure of Zal Cleminson on guitar. The band carried out a handful of shows that were pre-booked with guitarist Julian Hutson Saxby but after that, they decided to move on to separate projects.\n\nIn January 1974, the band went into Advision studios in London with US producer Shel Talmy to record their third album. By April, the sessions were finished and the album was mixed. However, the band and management had some reservations about the overall sound and decided to scrap the entire album. Talmy then returned to Los Angeles with his tapes.\n\nMost of the song titles eventually showed up on the official album \"The Impossible Dream\" later that year with a different producer on board, though the songs were dramatically changed. The original recordings formed an album called \"Hot City\", released in 2009 by Major League Productions.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Over each cycle a volume is created in contact with the chamber where pressure is to be lowered. By random motion, molecules from the vacuum chamber pass into the volume created by the pump. This volume is then cut off from the chamber and compressed in contact with a one way valve. If the volume is compressed enough some of the molecules will pass through the valve.\n\nThe maximum efficiency of a rotary compression pump is the ratio between the volume in contact with the vacuum and the smallest contracted volume in contact with the valve. If the ratio is 1:1000 and the pump is exhausting to atmospheric pressure, the highest achievable vacuum is 1/1000 of atmospheric pressure. This corresponds to 0.76 Torr or 101.3 Pa. This limitation makes rotary compression pumps very hard to construct if lower pressures than about 1 Torr is to be achieved. The simplicity of the process makes the rotary compression pump cheap and it is widely used as a low vacuum pump or a fore pump to a diffusion pump.\n\n"}

Though they run from their pasts, they eventually realize that no one can outrun their destinies.\n\n\"Rhapsody: Child of Blood\" draws on myriad different world mythologies. For example, the first Sleeping Child in the book can be likened to Jormundgandr from Norse mythology, with its waking similarly bringing about the end of the world. In addition, the different races—Lirin, Bolg, Nain, and so on—bear a great many similarities to the elves, ogres, and dwarves recognizable in Gaelic and Eastern European tradition. \"The Symphony of Ages\" series is unique in the way that these classic mythologies are blended together to create a story that is familiar and yet at the same time, fresh and unique.\n\n\n"}

He played his first competitive rugby for the local Clichy based Club Sportif before joining the southern giants Biarritz when he was just 17. He is also regarded as one of the strongest tacklers in the game, and is renowned for his high work-rate on the field.\n\nBetsen made his first appearance for France in 1997, as a replacement against , but did not receive his second call-up until the 2000 Six Nations Championship. Thereafter he became a regular starter in the national team.\n\nNicknamed \"la Faucheuse\" (\"the Grim Reaper\"), Betsen's finest moment came during the 2002 Six Nations Championship, in the match against , when his relentless man-marking of Jonny Wilkinson eventually resulted in the fly-half's replacement and paved the way for a 20–15 victory. Later, England's coach, Clive Woodward, said of Betsen: \"“He is the only player that I can say was the single-handed reason we lost a match.\" France went on to win the Grand Slam and Betsen was named France's International Player of the Year. He was an automatic selection for the 2003 Rugby World Cup and scored France's only try in the semi-final loss to England.\n\nIn 2005 he was cited following an incident during Biarritz's Heineken Cup match against London Wasps in which Wasps centre Stuart Abbott suffered a broken leg; the complaint was dismissed after a disciplinary hearing found that \"the trip, while intentional, was not premeditated\" and had happened \"in the heat of the moment\".\n\nBetsen was renowned as a fearless tackler, but with increasing age he started to pick up more frequent injuries and he missed the 2005 Autumn internationals after fracturing his cheekbone in a match against Toulouse. Despite this, he continues to be a formidable tackler: in the 2007 Six Nations Championship, which France won, he completed 56 tackles, 12 more than any other player in the tournament.\n\nToward the end of the 2005 season, Betsen held talks with English club Leicester Tigers about a possible move from France, but in the end he decided to stay at Biarritz and signed a new three-year contract.\n\nOn 16 January 2008 Betsen announced that he was retiring from international rugby with immediate effect.\n\nOn 11 May 2008, it was revealed he was signing for London Wasps.\n\nBetsen made a good start with Wasps performing well and earning respect from the Wasps supporters, for the A side whilst recovering from injury, before moving into the first XV. During the 2009 6 Nations championship he was made Wasps captain in the absence of the senior England players and friend Rafa Ibanez (though retirement caused by injury). The club announced that he would share the captaincy for the remainder of the 2008/09 season with Phil Vickery, though his performances as captain and 2-man of the match awards in quick succession, could see him keeping the role on a sole basis.\nBetsen left London Wasps in June 2011 and announced his retirement from rugby at his \"Jubilee\" game in Biarritz on 6 June 2012.\n\nBetsen signed with London Scottish as defence coach for the 2012–2013 season.\n\nBetsen is a member of the 'Champions for Peace' club, a group of more than 90 famous elite created by Peace and Sport, a Monaco-based international organization placed under the High Patronage of H.S.H Prince Albert II.

{"id": "1874888", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1874888", "title": "Thalamotomy", "text": "Thalamotomy\n\nThalamotomy (; ) is a surgical procedure in which an opening is made into the thalamus to improve the overall brain function in patients. First introduced in the 1950s, it is primarily effective for tremors such as those associated with Parkinson's disease, where a selected portion of the thalamus is surgically destroyed (ablated). Neurosurgeons use specialized equipment to precisely locate an area of the thalamus, usually choosing to work on only one side (the side opposite that of the worst tremors). Bilateral procedures are poorly tolerated because of increased complications and risk, including vision and speech problems. The positive effects on tremors are immediate. Other less destructive procedures are sometimes preferred, such as subthalamic deep brain stimulation, since this procedure can also improve tremors and other symptoms of PD.\n\nThalamotomy is a complex procedure performed by specialists of brain or neurosurgeons. It is mostly indicated in cases of stroke, damage to third ventricle of brain, brain hemorrhage, accidents leading to head injury, oedema around thalamus, subdural hemorrhage, and cerebrovascular accident. There is also some evidence in thalamocortical dysrhythmia.\nSubthalamotomy is a type of brain surgery in which the subthalamic nucleus is destroyed in attempt to help alleviate movement disorders often associated with Parkinson’s disease (PD). This surgery has been most widely researched at Cuba’s International Center for Neurological Restoration located in Havana. This center has assumed a leading role in developing a surgical procedure that provides significant relief for patients experiencing the slowness of movement, tremor, and muscle rigidity in middle to late stages of PD. Similar to the thalamotomy, this procedure can be repeated on both sides of the brain bilaterally, but is not recommended due to a large increase in the risk of speech and cognitive problems after surgery. The aim of subthalamotomies is to reduce symptoms of PD and the uncontrolled movements that can occur in patients taking the drug levodopa for a long time.\n\nThalamotomy can be performed in an invasive or noninvasive manner. If performed invasively, then prior to the operation, a neurosurgeon uses stereotactic technology to identify the exact part of the brain that needs treatment by putting in place a frame on the patient’s head with four pins to keep it still. The doctor then takes a detailed brain scan using computed tomography (CT scan) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to identify the precise location for operation, as well as a path through the brain to get to that specific spot. During the surgery, the patient is awake, but the area on the scalp where the surgical tools are inserted is numbed with an anesthetic. The surgeon makes a scalp incision (about 2 inches long), then inserts a hollow probe through a small hole drilled in the skull to the specific location. Different methods can be used to kill the brain cells, including circulating liquid nitrogen inside the probe, destroying the targeted brain tissue, or by inserting an electrode heated to near to denature the cells. Although the surgery usually requires only about a two-day hospital stay, full recovery generally takes about six weeks. Thalamotomy can be performed without incisions using ultrasound waves. The ultrasound waves are focused to the thalamus, thus cause thalamotomy through an intact skull. This procedure uses MRI guidance to localize the thalamus. The ultrasound waves cause gradual warming of the tissue until ablation occurs, seen clinically as resolution of tremor. During the procedure, the patient is awake. Thus, if any adverse effects are noted, the area of the thalamus that is treated can be adjusted before ablation. Favorable responses have so far been reported in PD patients and essential tremor patients.\n\nSome of the patients in Cuban studies developed complications from the surgery, including severe involuntary movements, but the symptoms abated (to the point where patients could tolerate them) after three to six months. Most common complications include a risk of stroke, confusion, and speech and/or visual problems. Although risks exist with unilateral subthalamotomy, they are greatly increased with bilateral subthalamotomy.\n\nOne study followed 89 patients with PD who were treated with unilateral subthalamotomy. Sixty-eight patients were available for evaluations after 12 months, 36 after 24 months, and 25 after 36 months. The Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale motor scores improved significantly and levodopa daily doses were significantly reduced by 45, 36, and 28% at 12, 24 and 36 months after surgery. Unilateral subthalamotomy was associated with significant motor benefit contralateral to the lesion. Further work is needed to ascertain what factors led to severe, persistent chorea-ballism in a subset of patients. In an earlier study, 18 advanced PD patients received staged or simultaneous bilateral one or more subthalamotomy. One patient subsequently developed multiple system atrophy signs and was excluded from further analysis. Motor improvements compared to baseline were 58% in the off state and 63% in the on state. Daily levodopa dose was reduced by a mean of 72%, with five patients receiving none. Three patients developed severe chorea postoperatively, which improved spontaneously at 3–6 months. In a third study, microelectrode mapping (guided stereotactic surgery on the subthalamic nucleus) was performed in eight patients with PD, and the findings indicated that subthalamotomy can ameliorate the cardinal symptoms of PD, reduce the dosage of levodopa, diminish complications of the drug therapy, and improve the quality of life. Havana’s International Center for Neurological Restoration reported at the American Neurological Association meeting in October 2002 that two years after undergoing a bilateral dorsal subthalamotomy, 17 Cuban patients improved by an average of 50% on movement tests, and they could dramatically reduce their daily ingestion of levodopa.\n\nSubthalamotomy could be a preferred option for people with PD who have trouble affording either the medication or deep-brain stimulation needed to moderate symptoms.\n"}

Normally used in laptops, but has also been used with Tualatin-M Pentium III processors. The official naming by Intel is µFCPGA and µPGA479M.\n\nThere exist multiple electrically incompatible, but mechanically compatible processor families that are available in PGA packages using this socket or variants thereof:\n\nEven the Intel's CPU specifications seem to be not clear enough on the distinction and instead use the package/socket designations PGA478 or PPGA478 for more than 1 of the above sockets.\n\nPerhaps adding yet more confusion, some of the PGA-based CPUs above are also available in a BGA (or more precisely, µBGA or even µFCBGA) package which has all of the 479 contacts (balls) populated. For these CPU variants, the Intel's CPU specifications use the designations BGA479, PBGA479 or H-PBGA479. It should be however pointed out that these designations denote rather the CPU package itself and not the socket, which the BGA variants do not use at all (they are intended to be directly soldered to the mainboard, e.g. in an embedded system). The non-BGA counterparts of these CPUs use any one of the above mentioned sockets, not only the Socket 479.\n\nSocket 479 has 479 pin holes. Pentium M processors in PGA package have 479 pins that plug into this zero insertion force socket. Only 478 pins are electrically connected (B2 is reserved and \"depopulated on the Micro-FCPGA package\").\n\nAlthough electrically and mechanically similar, Socket 478 has one pin less, making it impossible to use a Pentium M processor in a 478 board. For this reason manufacturers like Asus have made drop-in boards (e.g. CT-479) which allow use of Socket 479 processors.\n\nChipsets which employ this socket for the Pentium M are the Intel 855GM/GME/PM, the Intel 915GM/GMS/PM and the VIA family of chipsets such as the VN800. While the Intel 855GME chipset supports all Pentium M CPU's, the Intel 855GM chipset does not officially support 90 nm 2MB L2 cache (Dothan core) models (even though it works, it only works at 400FSB, some 3rd party/user was able to overclock the FSB on 855GM/GME/PM to support 533FSB Dothan Core). The other difference is the 855GM chipset graphics core runs at 200 MHz while the 855GME runs at 250 MHz.\n\nIn 2006, Intel released the successor to Socket 479 with a revised pinout for its Core processor, called Socket M. This socket has the placement of one pin changed from the Pentium M version of Socket 479; Socket M processors will physically fit into a Socket 479, but are electrically incompatible with most versions of the socket479(except using ATI north bridge RC415MD) . Socket M supports a 667 MT/s FSB with the Intel 945PM/945GM chipsets.\n\n"}

A member of The Fabulous Freebirds, Garvin is best known for his appearances with promotions including the American Wrestling Association, World Class Championship Wrestling, and World Championship Wrestling.\n\nWilliams grew up in Tampa, Florida, where he was an amateur wrestler.\n\nGarvin began his wrestling career in November 1968 at the age of 16 as \"Beau James\". He soon took the name \"Gorgeous\" Jimmy Garvin and was given two \"brothers\", Terry and Ron Garvin, whom he briefly managed.\n\nHe toured the Mid-South and Florida territories from 1978 until 1983. In 1982, Garvin (while holding the NWA Florida Global Tag Team Championship with Big John Studd) won the NWA Southern Heavyweight Championship from Sweet Brown Sugar. As a reward, Garvin's manager, J.J. Dillon, presented him with a valet named Precious. The original Precious was not the same woman as Garvin's wife, Patti Williams, who would later assume the name Sunshine II then \"Precious\". During his title defenses, Garvin often became distracted by Precious and flaunted his good looks to impress her. This would cause his opponents to recover and attack him. Due to her quiet-but-distracting nature, Garvin quickly lost the NWA Southern Heavyweight Championship to Dusty Rhodes, while he and Studd lost the NWA Florida Global Tag Team Championship to Ron Bass and Barry Windham. Garvin then replaced the original Precious (whom he later claimed in a shoot interview with Wrestling Perspective had been causing problems outside the ring with his marriage to Patti) with his cousin, Sunshine, and joined World Class Championship Wrestling in 1983.\n\nAlong with his valet Sunshine, Garvin competed in WCCW as a heel, refusing to wrestle on live TV before he started a feud with beloved David Von Erich, which he lost and ended up spending a day with Sunshine on David's ranch, doing ranch type duties such as washing the five dogs owned by David (as he relaxed and shot skeet right over Jimmy and Sunshine's heads) and relocating several bales of hay without the use of a truck. However, towards the end of the day, Garvin drew the line at cleaning out the old horse barn and the two went at it.\n\nHe next moved on to feud with Chris Adams. Around this time, he introduced his wife, Patti, as \"Sunshine II\", who was supposed to work as an assistant to the original Sunshine. After the interference of Sunshine II cost Garvin to lose the WCCW Television Championship to Johnny Mantell in October 1983, Sunshine II blamed the original Sunshine for the botch. Garvin then fired the original Sunshine and renamed Sunshine II as \"Precious\" (not to be confused with his original valet of the same name). Precious and Sunshine (now aligned with Chris Adams) feuded while Garvin traded the NWA American Heavyweight Championship with Adams. During this time, the couples competed in mixed tag-team matches. Sunshine temporarily left WCCW in 1984 (with the storyline excuse that she had been injured by Garvin and Precious) and was replaced in the feud with her \"truck driving aunt\", Stella Mae French (Tanya West). Adams and Stella Mae continued to compete in mixed tag team matches against Garvin and Precious until they defeated them in a \"Loser Leaves Town\" cage match in July 1984. Garvin and Precious then left World Class for the American Wrestling Association. Garvin and Adams would revive their feud ten years later in the Global Wrestling Federation, but the promotion went out of business before that angle got off the ground.\n\nIn the AWA, he formed a tag team with \"Mr. Electricity\" Steve Regal (not to be confused with WWE wrestler William Regal, who performed in WCW as \"Lord\" Steven Regal and previously as Steve Regal, having seen the name in American wrestling magazines) and they won the World Tag Team Titles from The Road Warriors with the help of the Fabulous Freebirds.\n\nAfter losing the titles to Scott Hall and Curt Hennig in 1986 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, he went to the NWA's Jim Crockett Promotions. He debuted as a heel often taunting Wahoo McDaniel, calling him \"Yahoo.\" Garvin and McDaniel would feud throughout the summer and fall of 1986 in a series of \"Indian Strap\" matches. He also feuded with Brad Armstrong and was in the middle of a feud with Magnum T.A. when Magnum had the car wreck that would end his career.\n\nIn 1987, Jimmy's \"brother\" Ron (Jimmy's real-life stepfather), was in a feud with Jim Cornette and his stable. During a match with Cornette's Midnight Express, Cornette threw fire in Ron's face. Several faces came out to help and then Jimmy ran out and helped take him to the back. Jimmy flew into a rage and stormed into the heel dressing room and brutally attacked Cornette and it took several wrestlers, heel and face, to pull him off of him. Jimmy and Ron's friend and partner Barry Windham then took Ron to the hospital.\n\nJimmy (and, by association, Precious) turned face and helped Ron feud with the Midnight Express. One of the bigger matches during that feud was when the two teams were matched against each other during the 1987 Jim Crockett Memorial Cup tag team tournament. The Midnight Express won by countout to advance.\n\nLater that year, Jimmy had one of the most memorable feuds in his career with Ric Flair, who was eyeing Precious. He sent her gifts and this caused lots of buildup for a big cage match between Flair and Jimmy during the 1987 Great American Bash stop in Greensboro, North Carolina for Flair's NWA World Title. The stipulation was added that if Flair won the match, he would get a date with Precious. During the match, Jimmy attempted a leap frog at one point but landed on one knee instead of his feet. Pain in the knee was \"sold\" by him during the rest of the match. This match got so heated that a fan actually attempted to climb into the cage to help Garvin. The fan was stopped by David Crockett, who was calling the match along with Tony Schiavone, right before the fan was about to get in. Flair ended up winning the match when he put Jimmy in the figure four leglock, Jimmy blacked out from the pain in his knee and his shoulders hit the mat for a count of three. Ron Garvin then entered the cage when the match was over and attacked Flair in order to defend Jimmy from further damage to his knee. When the date with Precious that Flair won occurred, Flair and James J. Dillon ended up being punched out by Ron Garvin, who was dressed in his \"Miss Atlanta Lively\" outfit. Just two months later, Ron successfully unseated Flair as NWA World Champion, holding on to the title until Starrcade '87 when Flair regained the belt.\n\nIn 1988, Garvin had a feud with Kevin Sullivan and his Varsity Club. This one was over Precious too but it was never made clear why Sullivan wanted her. He made references to her calling her \"Patti\" instead of Precious, possibly referring to the past somehow. Sullivan would stalk her and taunt her with papers in his robe, but they never revealed anything. Jimmy had some memorable matches during this feud including challenging Varsity Club member Mike Rotunda for the NWA World TV Title at Clash of the Champions I event during March of that year. Rotunda pinned Jimmy to retain the title.\n\nDuring the 1988 Great American Bash in Baltimore, Maryland held in July, Jimmy and Sullivan each captained 5 men teams opposing each other in the first ever \"Tower of Doom\" match. This match was actually a copied idea from World Class Championship Wrestling based out of Dallas, Texas who held a similar match a short while before this. It involved three cages stacked up on top of each other. A member of each team would start out climbing a ladder and facing off in the top cage. Every few minutes, new members from each team would enter the top cage in a similar fashion. Every so often, the doors between the cages would open for ten seconds allowing wrestlers to slip through to the next level. Jimmy's teammates consisted of Ron Garvin, Steve Williams, and the Road Warriors. They were victorious over Sullivan's team but the feud between Jimmy and Sullivan was not quite yet over.\n\nIn September 1988, Garvin left to sell a broken leg that he had gotten from Sullivan and Mike Rotunda. On the September 3 edition of \"NWA World Championship Wrestling\" from the TBS studios, Sullivan broke cement blocks over Jimmy's leg. Jim Ross commentating at the time yelled out \"He's breaking blocks all over his leg! Jesus!\"\n\nGarvin returned to Jim Crockett Promotions, now known as World Championship Wrestling, in June 1989 minus Precious and became the newest member of the Fabulous Freebirds (he had been associated with the Freebirds since 1983) by winning the World Tag Team Titles with Michael Hayes at Clash of the Champions VII. The titles were won as part of a tournament for them that had been ongoing. That night, Hayes and Garvin scored victories over the Dynamic Dudes in the semifinals and the Midnight Express (Bobby Eaton & Stan Lane) in the finals. They feuded with the Midnight Express some more following that, as well as Rick & Scott Steiner. Garvin had worked in the past with Hayes, Buddy Roberts and Terry Gordy during the height of the Freebird-Von Erichs feud in World Class, and was always considered \"The fourth Freebird\".\nIn the fall of 1990, they also had a manager of sorts, \"Little Richard Marley\" (wrestler Rocky King), who lasted until Starrcade.\n\nIn February 1991, they added two managers, Big Daddy Dink & Diamond Dallas Page. In May 1991, they added a masked Freebird, Badstreet, and they feuded with The Young Pistols (Steve Armstrong & Tracy Smothers). By the summer of 1991, Badstreet and their managers were gone and the Freebirds had no direction. They briefly added Precious as their manager but she only made one appearance at WrestleWar '92. During this period, Hayes and Garvin won 2 World Tag Team titles, 1 World Six-Man Tag Team title (with Badstreet), and 2 United States Tag Team titles.\n\nFollowing the arrival of Bill Watts as Executive Vice President of WCW the Freebirds were targeted for what would become a wave of budget cuts. Following a loss of the United States tag-team titles to Dick Slater and The Barbarian, Garvin was split from Hayes. He wrestled The Barbarian in singles matches in August 1992 and also began teaming with Tom Zenk. His final match with the company came on the October 10th episode of The Power Hour when he partnered with Zenk to face Butch Reed and The Barbarian.\n\nAfter leaving WCW in September 1992, Garvin received a tryout with the World Wrestling Federation. Garvin conducted an unaired interview segment at a television taping on October 26, 1992 in Springfield, Illinois where he insulted The Ultimate Maniacs (a team composed of The Ultimate Warrior and \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage) and predicted that all of the heels would win at the 1992 Survivor Series. Garvin did not sign with the company, and afterwards took a hiatus from pro wrestling, learning to become a commercial airline pilot.\n\nIn February 1994, Garvin made one final appearance in WCW at SuperBrawl IV in place of the \"injured\" Michael Hayes in a losing effort to Hayes' scheduled opponent Johnny B. Badd.\n\nAfter SuperBrawl IV, Garvin went to the Global Wrestling Federation (GWF), where he reformed the Freebirds with Terry Gordy and Hayes. He won the Tag Team Titles with Gordy in 1994. They were the last champions before the promotion folded in September 1994 and he retired shortly thereafter. Before the promotion folded, Garvin was scheduled to feud with Chris Adams over the GWF North American Heavyweight Championship.\n\nGarvin is prominently featured in \"The Triumph and Tragedy of World Class Championship Wrestling\" DVD released by World Wrestling Entertainment in late 2007. The DVD was composed of interviews with former WCCW stars as well as footage and matches from various WCCW broadcasts.\n\nGarvin also appeared on an installment of \"Legends\" on WWE Classics on Demand discussing managers. Garvin spoke on a number of subjects, including the often contentious relationship between Sunshine, Precious and Missy Hyatt, as well as his own experiences as a manager.\n\nOn April 2, 2016, Garvin was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame as part of The Fabulous Freebirds.\n\nMarried in 1972, Williams and his wife Patti (born January 1, 1955), better known as Precious, have two daughters and they are involved in a ministry for the poor and homeless.\n\nGarvin's stepfather is professional wrestler Ron Garvin.\n\nSince his retirement from professional wrestling, Garvin has become an Airline Transport Pilot.\n\n\n\n"}

The Power are a Class-A affiliate of the Seattle Mariners. It also has been used by the baseball programs of West Virginia University, Marshall University, and the University of Charleston. The stadium, which opened in April 2005, is located in the East End of Charleston, West Virginia. It seats 4,500 fans and cost $25 million to build. The dimensions of the field are as follows: left field - 330 feet, center field - 400 feet, right field - 320 feet.\n\nAdditionally, the park hosts the West Virginia state high school baseball championships. From 2006-2018, it was the home field for Marshall's Conference USA games, as Marshall did not have an adequate baseball facility on its campus located 50 miles (80 km) away in Huntington. For the 2019 season, temporary upgrades allowed the school to play most games at home, excepting games versus West Virginia and Virginia Tech, which generally draw a larger crowd than the Huntington facility can accommodate. The school is fundraising for a baseball facility on campus. When West Virginia University moved from the Big East Conference to the Big 12 Conference, its on campus baseball field likewise did not meet league standards, and WVU played its conference games in Charleston until a new taxpayer funded stadium was built on campus.\n\nThe stadium has also hosted concerts, boxing matches, charity events and shown television coverage of college football games on its scoreboard.\n\nThe naming rights were purchased by Appalachian Power, the West Virginia and southwest Virginia operating unit of American Electric Power.\n\nIn the ballpark's inaugural season, a Charleston baseball record 10,400 fans showed up on \"Buck Night\", which is a promotional night held on Thursdays where hot dogs, fountain drinks, and beer is $1.\n\nIn 2008, parts of The World's Strongest Man competition were held at the stadium.\n\nIn 2009, the South Atlantic League's 50th All-Star game was held at the stadium along with a home run derby, won by Calvin Anderson, and a fan fest.\n\nIn 2012, \"Stadium Journey Magazine\" named Appalachian Power Park among the ten best minor league baseball parks in the nation, and number 58 in its list of 100 best athletic venues worldwide.\n\nTNA Wrestling held BaseBrawl Wrestling events at the stadium on September 8, 2012.\n\nThe ballpark features an authentic locomotive horn donated by Norfolk Southern Corporation, whose tracks run adjacent to the park, coincidentally continuing the atmosphere of predecessor Watt Powell Park. The horn was refurbished in 2005 by employees of Norfolk Southern's Juniata Locomotive Shop in Juniata, Pennsylvania at the request of Assistant Division Superintendent Joe Maynard of Williamson.\n\nOne unique feature of the park is an electrical outlet located in the backstop behind home plate. This was added to accommodate local politician Rod Blackstone, nicknamed the \"Toast Man,\" who has become one of the most famous fans in minor league baseball. Blackstone brings numerous signs to urge the team on, and regularly leads the crowd in family-friendly cheers. He is most famous for bringing bread and a toaster to games, which he had done for years for the Power's predecessors. When a Power pitcher strikes out a batter, he yells \"You are toast!\" and then tosses slices of fresh (and not-so-fresh) toast into the seats around him, following it up with a chant of \"Don't eat the toast. You don't know where it's been.\"\n\nThe section behind the opposing team dugout is known as \"Rowdy Alley\" where Billy Bob and the Rowdys deliver family-friendly, good-natured heckles to the opposing team players and coaches as well to the umpires when they make bad calls. Billy Bob and Rowdy Alley are carryovers from Watt Powell Park and they have been razzing the opposing team since the early Charleston Alley Cats days. A night doesn't go by without hearing what can only be described as a Billy Bob Cackle when an opposing player strikes out. Choruses of \"DIRT BALL!\" and \"BORING!\" (sometimes in both English AND Spanish) pepper the opposing pitchers, and opposing coaches who dare venture onto the field are met with \"LEFT-RIGHT-LEFT-RIGHT\" all the way to the mound and back. The Rowdys are also known for their use of props to amuse the fans: duck-shaped umbrellas pop-up with loud calls of \"DUCK!\" when foul balls ricochet overhead, costume accessories, and noise-makers are abundant.\n\nThe stadium previously housed a seasonal and special events restaurant called the \"Power Alley Bar and Grill\" that featured food, indoor and outside seating, a full size bar, and pictures and memorabilia from Watt Powell Park and famous former players. In 2013, the restaurant was closed and reopened by a private vendor. The current restaurant is not sports-themed and does not have direct ties to the stadium.\n\nIn 2007, a party deck was built near the right field foul pole that can accommodate 250 people. An upgrade to a normal game ticket can be purchased for $25, allowing access to the Party Deck, which features all-you-can-eat hot dogs, nachos and other \"baseball food,\" as well as unlimited drinks. Naming rights for the party deck were recently acquired by Anheuser-Busch. In the 2008 and 2009 seasons, this area was known as the \"Landshark Lagoon\" but has since been renamed the \"Budweiser Party Deck.\"\n\nAlso in 2007, the Charleston Baseball Wall of Fame made its debut, located behind the home plate press box. \"Wheeler\" Bob (longtime Wheelers/Alley Cats/Power program & souvenir merchant), Rod \"Toast Man\" Blackstone, and Dave Parker are just three of the few who've had the honor of being inducted onto the Wall.\n\n\n"}

It is noted as a twin neighborhood of West Lawn. It has a population which includes a mix of dwindling Polish-American residents and increasing Mexican-American residents who currently constitute a clear majority. It has its own association, \"West Elsdon Civic Association,\" which privately organizes the neighborhood. St. Turibius grade school, a Roman Catholic elementary school, located at 57th and Karlov, closed in 2013 and is currently inactive though the building remains and is adjacent to St. Turibius Roman Catholic church. The former Lourdes Roman Catholic girls' high school located from 55th to 56th street from Komensky to Karlov Avenue is now a Chicago Public Schools magnet high school, John Hancock High School.\n\nBefore the early 20th century, the area now designated West Elsdon was a marshy remnant of an ancient lake. The early settlers were German-Americans and Irish-Americans. During the 1930s, housing was built and Polish-Americans and other Central Europeans settled the area. The land remained rural until World War II, when growth resumed and brick houses were built. After World War II, West Elsdon was the site of the Airport Homes race riots, the worst episode of racial inspired violence that the city faced in some thirty years. The West Elsdon Civic Association became one of the first vocal political enemies of the CHA and its first executive secretary, Elizabeth Wood. Opposition to public housing remained strong in the area. In the early 1970s the West Elsdon Civic Association was an active participant in the \"No-CHA\" citywide coalition opposing scattered-site public housing in predominantly middle-class white neighborhoods.\n\nLater, Mexican-Americans settled in the eastern part of the community. Soon public schools were registering more Hispanic-Americans, and the CTA Orange Line was built to connect Midway Airport to Downtown.\n\nThe West Elsdon community has supported the Democratic Party in the past two presidential elections by large margins. In the 2016 presidential election, West Elsdon cast 3,910 votes for Hillary Clinton and cast 685 votes for Donald Trump (82.18% to 14.40%).

{"id": "1874945", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1874945", "title": "Remembering Babylon", "text": "Remembering Babylon\n\nRemembering Babylon is a book by David Malouf written in 1993. It won the inaugural International Dublin Literary Award and was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize and the Miles Franklin Award.\n\nThe novel covers themes of isolation, language, relationships (particularly those between men), community and living \"on the edge\" (of society, consciousness, culture).\n\nIts themes evolve into a greater narrative of an English boy, Gemmy Fairley, who is marooned on a foreign land and is raised by a group of aborigines, natives to the land. When white settlers reach the area, he attempts to move back in the world of Europeans. As Gemmy wrestles with his own identity, the community of settlers struggle to deal with their fear of the unknown.\n\nMalouf's narrative voice is at once scattered and singular, skipping between perspectives on the same events, and forcing the reader to pay close attention to each character's rendering in order to arrive at the wholest truth possible. The magical realism theme is cultivated in the exaggerated response of all the characters to mundane items: Gemmy surrenders to what he knows is a stick instead of a gun, because he attributes Lachlan's aiming it at him as a signal of the wariness of the other settlers. The men of the community are in an uproar over a stone that visiting aborigines (supposedly) pass off to Gemmy for no logical reason—only because they fear whatever knowledge the aborigines have garnered of the land. These settlers are the first whites to live on that soil, and view anything that is not white with an extreme wariness, not only of the physical land but the spiritual sense of the place.\n\nGemmy is first shown at the fence between the European settlement, and the aborigine lands, about to fall onto the white side while three European children watched.\n\n\"The creature or spirit in him had spoken up, having all along had the words in there that would betray him and which, when they came hooting out of his mouth, so astonished him: \"Do not shoot. I am a B-b-British object.\"\"(p.33)\n\nGemmy contemplating Janet:\n\n\"She was a puzzle to him. He could never be sure what she was thinking. He knew the boy's thoughts because he wanted them known.

He became a successful and wealthy pastoralist, and a member of the Western Australian Legislative Council. The Hamersley family became one of the most prominent families in the colony.\n\nEdward Hamersley was born in Sandgate, Kent on 25 March 1810. He was educated at Pembroke College, Cambridge, graduating BA in 1833. He then spent a number of years touring throughout Europe, during which time he married Anne Louise Cornelis in Paris. Their first son, Edward, was born in Paris in 1836.\n\nAround 1836, he decided to emigrate to Western Australia, largely on the basis of optimistic letters received from his sister Frances, who had emigrated to Western Australia with her husband William Locke Brockman in 1830. He sailed with his wife and son, arriving at Fremantle in February 1837. Upon arriving in Western Australia, he found many of the original settlers to be financially struggling, and he was able to obtain a number of large grants of land extremely cheaply. He then leased the land out, ensuring himself an income and allowing him to live in relative comfort in Perth. Economic conditions improved in the late 1830s, and his large land holdings brought him substantial wealth. In 1839, he became a partner in a horse breeding business with Samuel Pole Phillips, who had recently arrived in the colony, and in 1841 he became a director of the Western Australian Bank. However, late in 1842, the bottom dropped out of the wool market, and many settlers were ruined. His own losses were minor, but the colony overall was struggling, and he preferred not to remain there. He appointed an agent to manage his affairs in the colony, and in January 1843, the Hamersley family set sail for France. They would live there for the next six years.\n\nIn January 1850, he returned to Western Australia to secure the titles to some of his land. Upon arriving in the colony, he learned that his agent had died a few months before, leaving his affairs in a confused state. Thus, Hamersley spent some time sorting out his estate, then launched into a new horse breeding venture. He became a leading horse-breeder and was a foundation member of the Western Australian Turf Club when it formed in 1852. In 1851, he partnered with Phillips, Lockier Burges and Bart Vigors to form an enterprise known as \"The Cattle Company\". Each man applied for leases on the Irwin River in the newly opened Champion Bay district, thus securing for the company a virtual monopoly of land in the area. The company was well managed by Phillips, and big profits were made in the first few years. Hamersley continued investing his profits in various town and farm properties, with a view to securing the future of his many children. This diversification protected him somewhat when profits from The Cattle Company fell away in the early 1860s. Phillips, who had not diversified, suffered great financial losses during this time, and a rift developed between the two men when Hamersley refused to increase Phillips book-keeping allowance.\n\nIn June 1857, Hamersley and Phillips were both nominated to the Legislative Council. Initially they sided together, successfully fighting a proposal that Western Australia accept female convicts. Later, they opposed one another over the issue of representative government which Hamersley favoured, and this added to the ill feeling between the two. When the governor rejected a petition calling for elections, Hamersley resigned from the Council in protest. The Cattle Company was dissolved at the end of 1867, primarily because of the rift between Hamersley and Phillips. In 1870, he retired in Perth.\n\nHamersley died in Perth on 26 November 1874. Buried East Perth Cemetery with his wife.\n"}

The setinkane is made with varying forks, and played more like a keyboard.\n\nDuring the colonial era, Tswana folk music was discouraged because it was considered a hindrance in the proper development of the region and people. Since independence for Botswana, folk music has been revived, though still the most popular music is from elsewhere in Africa (especially South Africa), United States and Europe.\n\nMany current music groups in Botswana are performing Tswana music and dance, such as Culture spears, Matsieng, Mokorwana, Ditaola, Mokorwana, Makhirikhiri and many others groups.\n\nTswana people classify their vocal music as ‘dipina’ (songs) according to their function within various social institutions for instance, music produced during initiation ceremonies is known as ‘moamo’. The performance of much of the Tswana traditional music is related to the agricultural season of the year. The seasons are as follows: \n\nTraditional Tswana communal music is characteristically largely pentatonic, of diversive symmetrical meter performed with much expression and rhythmic bodily movements. \nTraditional Tswana songs are either ‘mainmane a segologolo’ which is a ‘folklore of great import’ or the songs are contemporary, where they originate from a known composer ‘motlahami’. The songs may be sung in unison (pina e e kodunngwe) or in two or more parts. Multipart songs are usually in a ‘call and response’ form where the ‘call’ is known as ’segalodimo’ and the response ‘segalo tlase’.\n\nTswana Bows\nThere are 4 main types of bows used by the Tswana people namely the lengope, senwana, setinkane and nokukwane\n\nLengope- This bow consists of a curved length of cane strung with nylon fishing rod. The ‘lengope’ is mouth resonated, fingered with the left hand and plucked with the right forefinger.\n\nSengwana- This bow is calabash-resonated, stick-struck, and has its cord divided unequally so as to produce a 2 tones, a minor third apart. The effect of variations in tone quality is made by the performer raising and lowering the calabash opening against their chest. This bow a much larger than the ‘lengope’\n\nSetinkane - The ‘setinkane’ is similar to the ‘sengwana’ but it does not have a resonater.\n\nNokukwane- This bow was obtained by the Korana people and the Tswana people are the only Bantu people who use it.

It also saw manager Paul Ellering suspended 20 feet above the ring in a smaller cage. This is the match that Shawn Michaels credits for inspiring the Hell in the Cell concept used by WWE. The stipulation for this match was that Sawyer and Rich would never wrestle one another again. Tommy Rich lost a match to Ted Dibiase and the stipulation was a loser leaves town match. Rich appeared the next week on TV under a mask and calling himself the mysterious MR.R.

{"id": "1875023", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1875023", "title": "Virac, Catanduanes", "text": "Virac, Catanduanes\n\n', officially the ', is a and capital of the province of , . According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nIt is most populous and fifth largest in land area in Catanduanes.\n\nIt has been said that Virac is a derivation of the word “Vidak” while others claim it is a contraction of the Spanish version of the word \"burac\", meaning flower. A priest is on a quest for more information about the natives. Pointing to a tree, he asked what it was called and the natives replied, “Burac.” Thereupon, the priest made his first notation on his book of information “burac”.\n\nCivilization first touched the island province of Catanduanes in the thirteenth century, with the arrival of the scions of ten Bornean datus who were then traversing through the islets of the Philippine Archipelago. By the middle of the fourteenth century, organized communities could be seen throughout Catanduanes – a consequence of the rapid development of Southeastern Luzon initiated by the Malay settlers.\n\nVirac, the capital town of the island province of Catanduanes, started its primitive annals in pre-Spanish times when tribal chieftain Lumibao, scion of Datu Dumaguil who came to the Philippines with the 10 Bornean datus and his wife Milbigan settled near Vidak spring and founded the first civilized settlement with a score of servant followers and their wives.\n\nIt was the Spanish Conquistadores Juan de Salcedo who first brought Spanish galleons to the waters of Catanduanes in 1573. His purpose then was to capture and punish pirates who carried on their nefarious trade in Camarines Sur, Sorsogon and Western Catanduanes. His galleon returned a few weeks later – this time, his mission was to spread the Catholic faith.\n\nWhile at bay, the port guard saw smoke rising from the mountain \"Eli\". After dropping anchor, the Spaniards tracked down footprints from the shore which reached a sitio called Vidak. They eventually came upon a large kaingin in Timbean, situated between the barangays of Danicop and Calatagan.\n\nThe chieftain of the village had his hut built a little above a spring which still exists today. There was a reception hall conveniently shaded by a tree known as \"sambong\". This tree eventually served as the guidon to the couple’s place.\n\nIt is said that the Spaniards could not approach the hut of the chieftain because of three huge fierce-looking dogs and several guards who had their spears drawn toward the foreigners. However, the Spaniards determined to succeed in their mission, returned the threatening acts of the natives with gesture of friendship.\n\nA piece of “onchita” was offered to the chieftain as a gift; but this was rejected by the chieftain when his wife said “we have many pieces of gold in our kingdom”. A silver piece was next offered, but this was similarly rejected by the chieftain and his wife. Reaching for some refined sugar, the Spaniards let the natives taste the sweetness of the substance. The chieftain’s wife like the taste. Thus begun the “sweet” relation between the natives and the Spaniards.\n\nSoon after the first encounters, the Spaniards started giving the natives provisions not found in the chieftain’s hut, such as more sugar and clothing. After the seed of friendship had taken roots, the Spaniards began spreading their message of Christianity. Lumibao was baptized as Jose and Milbigan as Maria. Their son who lived at the bank of Macacao was converted into Christianity with the name of Mariano.\n\nIt is unfortunate that records regarding the Christianization of Virac were lost due to vandalism of Moros. The history of this capital town began to be accurately recorded only from the year 1755.\n\nCatanduanes was not spared from the adventurous and plunderous raids of the Moros from Mindanao. But knowing the strength of the coastal batteries of the Virac harbor, the vintas divided into groups and landed at various places or points farther from the range of the coastal batteries. Some landed at Cadaculaan and others way out to points east and west of Virac.\n\nDon Matias Soliman, a famous Moro fighter, engaged in battle and killed a Moro Datu named Mohammed Abu after a bloody encounter in sitio Hopog of Barrio Santo Domingo, Virac. He was aided by the swift-handed and hoarse voiced Don Alipio Alejandro alias Paas.\n\nThe non-Christian invaders were superior in arms and number until Don Alipio, with an exotic force, turned the tide. The Moros could not move further, hence, they retreated in defeat.\n\nOn the eastern end of Virac, the Moros succeeded in gaining a beach-head in Catanduanes and from there, attacked the town from the east. The Cabeza de Barangay of Francia, Don Pedro Tolentino alias \"Pantino\", lost no time in giving their all against the enemy. This was the first time the people of Virac totally and successfully resisted an organized invasion.\n\nA few months after Emilio Aguinaldo, the first president of the First Philippine Republic took his oath of allegiance to America after losing in the Philippine-American War, a battleship dropped anchor in Virac. The American soldiers were on a mission to expedite the surrender of the local Revolutionists or Katipuneros. Not eager to relinquish their hard-fought freedom, the Katipuneros refused to recognize the sovereignty of the United States and fled to the mountains.\n\nIn the later part of 1898, when Don Leon Reyes was the incumbent \"Capitan Municipal\" [town mayor] of Virac, the revolutionary troops who refused American Administration, came down from the mountains to rally for the common cause. Don Leon Reyes readily welcomed the revolutionists and financed their cause in fighting the Americans. This state of affairs was tactfully handled by the \"Capitan\" who spent almost all of his fortunes for the cause. For his patriotic zeal, he was manacled, chained and sentenced to hard labor by the Americans in 1901.\n\nThe American occupation ended in 1934 before the establishment of the Philippine Commonwealth in 1935.\n\nCatanduanes was not spared by the forces of the Kamakura Regiment. Airborne planes were cited at the southern portion of Virac in the morning of December 12, 1941, while vessels dropped anchor near Nagngangang Buaya Point, Cabugao Bay. At 9:30 in the morning of said day, towns were totally evacuated. Bombs were soon strategically dropped.\n\nLater, garrisons were established in town and the municipal building was also used as a garrison. No school was regularly opened during the Japanese Occupation. Guerrilla organizations came and went.\n\nThe Liberation of Catanduanes took place in what is now the municipal building and the Virac Parish Church area. On February 8, 1945, the battle started at Km. 4 at Barangay Calatagan at about 12 noon, and ended with the Filipino soldiers of the 5th, 52nd, 53rd, 55th, 56th and 57th Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and recognized guerrillas taking full control of the Japanese barracks.\n\nOn April 20, 1945, Florencio Tacorda, the only three-term Municipal President, some two and a half decades before the war, was designated mayor of Virac. He served for six months and twenty-five days during the Philippine Civil Affairs Unit regime.\n\nFrom 1958-1970, Salvador Surtida took over followed by Jorge Arcilla from 1970-1986, two of the longest reigning local executives in the history of Virac. This period witnessed the ascendancy to national prominence of the Alberto brothers, Juan, Jose and Vicente, who doubtlessly brought progress and influenced the massive physical transformation of the municipality when Salvador Surtida and Jorge Arcilla were mayors. Foremost among the many infrastructure projects were the Catanduanes State Colleges and the Eastern Bicol Medical Center which placed Virac in the map as a major educational and health center in the Bicol Region.\n\nThe growth of Virac in terms of governance peaked in 1972. From the original 34 barangays in 1960, Virac was able to establish 29 new communities to upgrade to the present composition of 63 barangays. The declaration of martial law on September 21, 1972, despite the alleged rampant atrocities, had, by and large, no ill effects on the lives of the constituency, who by nature are peace-loving and law-abiding citizens.\n\nThe EDSA Revolution in 1986 which toppled down the more than two decades of Marcos regime had a domino effect on the political structure of Virac. The replacement of the elected officials by appointed officials was in accordance with the Freedom Constitution which predominated during the revolutionary government from 1986 to 1992. Rodulfo Sarmiento, a doctor by profession held the reins of the municipal government.\n\nThe early nineties saw the alternate changing of local governance between Rodulfo Sarmiento and Jose \"Cito\" Alberto II, the son of Congressman Jose Alberto.\n\nThe municipality of Virac occupies the southern tip of the island province. It has a total land area of 18,778.4 hectares. Of its total, 9,359.15 hectares or 49.84% is forestland while 9,419.25 hectares are classified as alienable and disposable.\n\nAlmost half of the area is rugged and mountainous, with hills and plains dotted with marshy land, rocky jutting cliffs and crags.\n\nThe town is bounded on the east and south by the Pacific Ocean, on the north by high and green mountain ranges of San Miguel, and on the west by the gently rolling hills of San Andres.\n\nVirac has a Type II climate. It has no dry season and an average precipitation of between 2,500-3,000 mm/annually.\n\nVirac's position in the middle of the typhoon belt means that it is heavily affected by typhoons from July to October. The region's dependence on agriculture means that economic development has always been hampered by these weather disturbances.\n\nThe growth of Virac in terms of governance peaked in 1972. From the original 34 barangays in 1960, Virac established 29 new communities to increase the number of barangays to the present 63 barangays.\n\nIn the , the population of Virac was people, with a density of .\n\nCatholicism is a deeply rooted institution in this town with 98% of the people embracing the faith. Virac is the seat of an independent diocese of Catanduanes with Bishop Manolo Delos Santos, D.D., at the helm. The town was once a vicarship of Caceres and later, the Diocese of Legazpi. The patron of the town is the Immaculate Concepcion with the feast day celebrated on December 8.\n\nThe economy of Virac is sustained primarily by agriculture - the farming of rice, corn, bananas and root crops. The production of copra and abaca also provide additional income for the people. Its annual income in 1979 was a little more than P980,000.00 and the projected income for 1990 is more than a million pesos. Fishing is also an essential industry, together with mining and lumber. Lately, some home industries have been established while other sources of income are business and employment from the government and private sectors.\n\nThis capital town has a total land area of 0.30 hectares devoted to industrial undertakings with the exception of the unused 11.2 hectares in Palnab classified as industrial area in the 1978 Official Land Use Plan and the 20-hectare declared site of the proposed Provincial Agro-Industrial Center at Casoocan. Manufacturing and processing activities are dominated by micro-industry enterprises. Of the existing industries, furniture making, being primarily wood-based, faces the gravest threat of extinction due to global concern for forest protection and conservation.\n\nRice is the single biggest monocrop culture planted in an aggregate area of 1,019 hectares which is about thirty three percent of the total lowland agricultural land area. Three hundred seventy five hectares are devoted to vegetables production. Upland farms are essentially utilized for cash crops such as abaca, tubers and coconut. Vegetables and other food crops are raised in the low lands on mostly seasonal basis.\n\nFor 2011, annual harvests approximate 7,849 MT of palay, 3.00 MT of vegetables, 59.75 MT of corn, 7.98 MT of root crops, 1.6 MT of legumes and other perennial crops 5.445MT. Unprocessed abaca fiber and copra represent the major export products.\n\nIn 2012, Virac's locally generated income reached Php32.6 million, with total income (including IRA) at Php117.9 million.\n\nThe five major income sources\n\nVirac Airport. Cebu Pacific flies between Manila and Virac 4 times a week. There are no direct flights to or from Cebu even though it is serviced by Cebu Pacific.

Flight time is less than one hour. \n\n\nDaily Ferry services bridge Catanduanes, from the Port of Virac and Port of San Andres, to the main island of Luzon, via Tabaco Seaport in Tabaco City, Albay.

{"id": "1875026", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1875026", "title": "Eureka: A Prose Poem", "text": "Eureka: A Prose Poem\n\nEureka (1848) is a lengthy non-fiction work by American author Edgar Allan Poe (1809–1849) which he subtitled \"A Prose Poem\", though it has also been subtitled as \"An Essay on the Material and Spiritual Universe\". Adapted from a lecture he had presented, \"Eureka\" describes Poe's intuitive conception of the nature of the universe with no antecedent scientific work done to reach his conclusions. He also discusses man's relationship with God, whom he compares to an author. It is dedicated to the German naturalist and explorer Alexander von Humboldt (1769–1859). \n\nThough it is generally considered a literary work, some of Poe's ideas anticipate 20th-century scientific discoveries and theories. Indeed, a critical analysis of the scientific content of \"Eureka\" reveals a non-causal correspondence with modern cosmology due to the assumption of an evolving Universe, but excludes the anachronistic anticipation of relativistic concepts such as black holes.\n\n\"Eureka\" was received poorly in Poe's day and generally described as absurd, even by friends. Modern critics continue to debate the significance of \"Eureka\" and some doubt its seriousness, in part because of Poe's many incorrect assumptions and his comedic descriptions of well-known historical minds. It is presented as a poem, and many compare it with his fiction work, especially science fiction stories such as \"The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar\". His attempts at discovering the truth also follow his own tradition of \"ratiocination\", a term used in his detective fiction tales. Poe's suggestion that the soul continues to thrive even after death also parallels with works in which characters reappear from beyond the grave such as \"Ligeia\". The essay is oddly transcendental, considering Poe's disdain for that movement. He considered it his greatest work and claimed it was more important than the discovery of gravity.\n\n\"Eureka\" is Poe's last major work and his longest non-fiction work at nearly 40,000 words in length. The work has its origins in a lecture Poe presented on February 3, 1848, titled \"On The Cosmography of the Universe\" at the Society Library in New York. He had expected an audience of hundreds; only 60 attended and many reportedly were confused by the topic. Poe had hoped the profits from the lecture would cover expenses for the production of his new journal \"The Stylus\". Some reviews in the contemporary press offered lavish praise for the lecture while others critiqued it harshly.\n\n\"Eureka\" is Poe's attempt at explaining the universe, using his general proposition \"Because Nothing was, therefore All Things are\". In it, Poe discusses man's relationship to God and the universe or, as he offers at the beginning: \"I design to speak of the Physical, Metaphysical and Mathematical – of the Material and Spiritual Universe: of its Essence, its Origin, its Creation, its Present Condition and its Destiny\". In keeping with this design, Poe concludes \"that space and duration are one\" and that matter and spirit are made of the same essence. Poe suggests that people have a natural tendency to believe in themselves as infinite with nothing greater than their soul—such thoughts stem from man's residual feelings from when each shared an original identity with God. Ultimately individual consciousnesses will collapse back into a similar single mass, a \"final ingathering\" where the \"myriads of individual Intelligences become blended\". Likewise, Poe saw the universe itself as infinitely expanding and collapsing like a divine heartbeat which constantly rejuvenates itself, also implying a sort of deathlessness. In fact, because the soul is a part of this constant throbbing, after dying, all people, in essence, become God.\n\n\"Eureka\" presents themes and sentiments similar to some of those in Poe's fiction work, including attempts at breaking beyond the obstacle of death and specifically characters who return from death in stories like \"The Fall of the House of Usher\" and \"Ligeia\". Similar to his theories on a good short story, Poe believes the universe is a self-contained, closed system. In coming to his conclusions, Poe uses ratiocination as a literary device, through his character C. Auguste Dupin, as if Poe himself were a detective solving the mystery of the universe. \"Eureka\", then, is the culmination of Poe's interest in capturing truth through language, an extension of his interest in cryptography.\n\n\"Eureka\" seems to continue the science fiction traditions he used in works like \"MS. Found in a Bottle\" and \"The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar\". He further emphasizes the connection between his theory and fiction by saying that the universe itself is a written work: \"The Universe is a plot of God\", Poe says, and \"the plots of God are perfect\". Even so, Poe admits the difficulty in explaining these theories comes in part from the limitations of language, often apologizing for or explaining his use of \"common\" or \"vulgar\" terms.\n\nPoe's decision to refer to the piece as a \"prose poem\" goes against some of his own \"rules\" of poetry which he laid out in \"The Philosophy of Composition\" and \"The Poetic Principle\". In particular, Poe called the ideal poem short, at most 100 lines, and utilizing the \"most poetical topic in the world\": the death of a beautiful woman. Poe himself suggested that the work be judged only as a work of art, not of science, possibly dismissing the seriousness of \"Eureka\". Though he is using mathematical and scientific terms, he may really be talking about aesthetics and suggesting there is a close connection between science and art. This is an ironic sentiment when compared to his message in the poem \"To Science\" where he shows a distaste for modern science encroaching on spirituality and the artist's imagination. Poe also discusses several astronomy-related topics in \"Eureka\", including the speed of the stars, the diameters of planets and distance between them, the weight of Earth, and the orbit of the newly discovered \"Leverrier's planet\" (later named Neptune).\n\nThe work ventures into transcendentalism, relying strongly on intuition, a movement and practice he had despised. Though he criticized the transcendental movement for what he referred to as incoherent mysticism, \"Eureka\" is more mystical than most transcendental works. \"Eureka\" has also been compared to the theories of Mary Baker Eddy, founder of Christian Science and Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement.\n\nThe essay is written in a progressive manner that anticipates its audience. For example, Poe uses more metaphors further into the work in the belief that the reader becomes more interested. Poe's voice crescendos throughout, starting as the modest seeker of truth, moving on to the satirist of logic, and finally ending as the master scholar.\n\n\nThe comical presentation of these well-known historical theorists, including the puns on their names, suggests Poe intended \"Eureka\" to be a burlesque. Alternatively, his criticism of these men indicate Poe's need to challenge their conclusions before making his own.\n\n\"Eureka\" was published in a small hardcover edition in March 1848 by Wiley & Putnam priced at 75 cents. Poe persuaded George Palmer Putnam, who had previously taken a chance on Poe by printing his only novel \"The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket\" in England, to publish \"Eureka\" after claiming this work was more important than Isaac Newton's discovery of gravity. Putnam paid Poe fourteen dollars for the work. Poe suggested an initial printing of at least one million copies; Putnam settled on 750, of which 500 were sold that year. Other accounts say that Poe requested 50,000 copies, and 500 were printed. Poe was given in advance the full payment of $14 from the publisher.\n\n\"Eureka\" has been read in many ways, in part because Poe's sincerity in the work is questionable. It has been considered prophetically scientific, intuitively romantic, and even calculatingly ironic. Lacking scientific proof, Poe said it was not his goal to prove what he says to be true, but to convince through suggestion.\n\nThough modern critics have dismissed \"Eureka\" for having no scientific worth or merit, Poe's work s modern science with his own concept of the Big Bang. He postulated that the universe began from a single originating particle or singularity, willed by a \"Divine Volition\". This \"primordial particle\", initiated by God, divides into all the particles of the universe. These particles seek one another because of their originating unity (gravity) resulting in the end of the universe as a single particle. Poe also expresses a cosmological theory that anticipated black holes and the Big Crunch theory as well as the first plausible solution to Olbers' paradox (the night sky is dark despite the vast number of stars in the universe). In 1987 astronomer Edward Robert Harrison published a book, \"Darkness at Night\", on this paradox. This book clarified why lack of energy explains the paradox, and lays out how Harrison discovered that Poe's \"Eureka\" anticipated this conclusion. A scientific reassessment of \"Eureka\" also underlines that Poe was the first person to conceive a Newtonian evolving universe considering that nothing can stop stars or galaxies from collapsing on each other.\n\nMany of Poe's conclusions, however, are speculative due to his rejection of analytic logic and emphasis on intuition and inspiration. Further, \"Eureka\" contains many scientific errors. In particular, Poe's suggestions opposed Newtonian principles regarding the density and rotation of planets. He also says that Johannes Kepler came to his conclusions not through science but through guesswork. For this reason, it has been suggested that what Poe demands is true in \"Eureka\" is not actually about this universe, but a parallel fictitious one Poe creates. If this is the case, as interpreted by poet Richard Wilbur, Poe is criticizing this world, suggesting it has fallen away from God by elevating scientific reason above poetic intuition.\n\nMore modern critics also suggest \"Eureka\" is a sign of Poe's declining mental health at the end of his life. Astrophysicist Arthur Stanley Eddington disputed this notion, declaring that \"\"Eureka\" is not a work of dotage or disordered mind\". In the text, Poe wrote that he was aware he might be considered a madman. The lecture on which the essay was based was delivered only a few days after the anniversary of the death of his wife Virginia, suggesting a connection between the event and his new theories. Poe seems to dismiss death in \"Eureka\", thereby ignoring his own anxiety over the problem of death.\n\nSome modern critics believe \"Eureka\" is the key to deciphering meaning in all Poe's fiction, that all his works involve similar theories.\n\nResponse to \"Eureka\" was overwhelmingly unfavorable. Poe's friend Marie Louise Shew, who had helped his wife Virginia on her death-bed, broke off their friendship because it offended her religious beliefs.\n\nAfter the publication of \"Eureka\", a vehement anonymous censure was published in the \"Literary Review\". Poe believed it to have been written by John Henry Hopkins Jr. (1820–1889), a young theological student, who had previously criticized the work as pantheistic and \"a damnable heresy\" that \"conscience would compel him to denounce\". Literary critic George Edward Woodberry in 1885 thought the essay was based on a crude understanding of the science a student learns in school \"rendered ridiculous\" by absurdity and the density of his ignorance. Thomas Dunn English, a writer, lawyer, and doctor who frequently criticized Poe, wrote a news article for the \"John-Donkey\" with the headline \"Great Literary Crash\". The article explained that a shelf of books crashed because someone had \"imprudently\" stacked an edition of \"Eureka\" on it and that it was a miracle that the whole building did not fall down because of it.\n\nThe lecture upon which \"Eureka\" was based also received negative reviews. Poe's friend Evert A. Duyckinck wrote to his brother that the lecture bored him to death and that it was \"full of a ludicrous dryness of scientific phrase—a mountainous piece of absurdity\". A local newspaper called it \"hyperbolic nonsense\", though one publication, the \"Courier and Enquirer\", called it \"a nobler effort than any other Mr. Poe has yet given the world\". Audience members said it was not persuasive or simply too long. Even so, Poe considered \"Eureka\" to be his masterpiece. He believed the work would immortalize him because it would be proven to be true. In the preface, Poe said: \"It is as a Poem only that I wish this work to be judged after I am dead.\"\n\nAfter its publication he wrote to his aunt Maria Clemm saying, \"I have no desire to live since I have done \"Eureka\". I could accomplish nothing more.\" He confided in a friend that he believed his contemporary generation was unable to understand it but that it would be appreciated, if ever, two thousand years later.\n\nSome critics, however, responded favorably to \"Eureka\". French writer Paul Valéry praised it for both its poetic and scientific merit, calling it an abstract poem based on mathematical foundations. Albert Einstein, in a letter written in 1934, noted that \"Eureka\" was \"eine schöne Leistung eines ungewöhnlich selbständigen Geistes\" (a beautiful achievement of an unusually independent mind).. \n\n"}

Hsingan was divided into various sub-prefectures, similar in form to other Manchukuo provinces. The second city of importance was Manzhouli.\n\nHsingan \"anto\" (province) was first created in 1932 as an administrative sub-division of the Japanese-controlled Empire of Manchukuo. From 1939 to 1943, the province was divided into four parts, labeled Hsingan North, Hsingan East, Hsingan South and Hsingan West. These four provinces were reunited into a Xing'an Consolidated Province (興安総省) in 1943. Hsingan at encompassed nearly one third of the land area of Manchukuo.\n\nThe population of Hsingan, estimated at 965,000 in 1935, was predominantly ethnically Mongol, and Hsingan was therefore administered by a local Mongol prince (under supervision of a Japanese resident supervisor).\n\nHsingan was the site of a number of clashes in the Soviet-Japanese Border Wars, most notably the Nomonhan Incident where Japanese Kwantung Army and Manchukuo Imperial Army forces were defeated by the Soviet Red Army in 1939.\n\nAfter the annexation of Manchukuo by the Republic of China after the end of World War II, the Kuomintang continued to recognize the area as Hsingan Province, with the capital in Hailar. However, under the administration of the People's Republic of China from 1949, the area was annexed to the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and is now referred to as the Hulunbuir Prefecture-level city. The population is now estimated to be over 80% ethnic Han Chinese.\n\nUnder the Manchukuo period, Hsingan was primarily an agricultural area, with food grains, particularly wheat, soy and corn, as well as cattle, sheep, horse and other livestock. The primary economic asset of Hsingan was its extensive coal deposits, primarily at Chalai Nor hill, 25 kilometers from the frontier station of Manchouli, where 290,000 metric tonnes were extracted annually. Hsingan was also a trade zone between Manchukuo, the Soviet Union, and Soviet-dominated Mongolia.\n\n\nThe Mongols of Manchuria: Their Tribal Divisions, Geographical Distribution, Historical Relations with Manchus and Chinese, and Present Political Problems. by Owen Lattimore　Pacific Affairs, Vol. 8, No. 3 (Sep., 1935), pp. 367–371\n\n"}

These sequences are known as signal peptides, molecular signatures, or sorting signals.\n\nThe classical ER retention signal is the C-terminal KDEL sequence for lumen bound proteins and KKXX (signal sequence is located in cytoplasm) for transmembrane localization. These signals allow for retrieval from the Golgi apparatus by ER retention receptors, effectively maintaining the protein in the ER. Other mechanisms for ER retention are being studied but are not as well characterized as signal retention.\n\n\n"}

Cartoons shorts and animated bridging sequences, starring Daffy Duck. It was the final theatrical production in which Mel Blanc provided the voices of the various \"Looney Tunes\" characters before his death on July 10, 1989. Unlike previous compilation films, \"Quackbusters\" uses pre-existing music from older \"Looney Tunes\" shorts composed by Carl Stalling, Milt Franklyn and William Lava for both the new animation and classic footage. It was also one of the two compilation films of classic Warner Bros. cartoon shorts not composed by Robert J. Walsh (the other being 1979's \"The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Movie\", which was composed by Dean Elliott). The film was released to theaters by Warner Bros. on September 24, 1988. Similar to \"The Looney Looney Looney Bugs Bunny Movie\", which was preceded with the Oscar-winning \"Knighty Knight Bugs\" (1958), \"Quackbusters\" is preceded with the exclusive short \"The Night of the Living Duck\" (1988).\n\nThe story of the film serves as a continuation/re-working of \"Daffy Dilly\".\n\nStreet corner salesman Daffy tries to make a pitch to reclusive billionaire and \"ailing buzzsaw baron\" J.P. Cubish (a dog) - who has offered wealth to anyone who can make him laugh before he passes on - only to be stymied by Cubish's butler (also a dog). Eventually driving off the butler, Daffy becomes Cubish's jester, taking uncounted pies in the face while Cubish laughs uproariously. After Cubish's death soon afterward (\"died laughing\", reports one newspaper), Daffy inherits the Cubish fortune, which is locked in a safe, under the provision that he will use the money to provide a beneficial public service and follow Cubish's creed to display honesty in business affairs. The now-wealthy Daffy derides the idea (\"What a rube!\" he says of Cubish), but his deceased benefactor returns as an unseen ghost, with the intention of reclaiming his fortune from Daffy, unless Daffy agrees to provide a service to the community as the terms of Cubish's will stated. The irked Daffy vows to use the money to wipe out ghosts (à la \"Ghostbusters\") such as Cubish.\n\nSetting himself up as a \"Paranormalist at Large\", Daffy persuades Bugs Bunny to appear in commercials (despite the rabbit's insistence of going to Palm Springs for his vacation), then hires Porky Pig (accompanied by Sylvester) as an underling; Cubish continues to make money vanish from inside the safe whenever Daffy seems to do or say something dishonest.\n\nSylvester has an exploit with Tweety, where Sylvester is relentlessly chased by a monstrous version of Tweety and develops paranoia in front of Daffy and Porky. Daffy assigns Porky to investigate the resort town of Dry Gulch for any suspicious ghost activity. Porky agrees to take the case and takes the now-paranoid Sylvester with him, who has to defend his owner from killer mice in the town's hotel.\n\nAlthough Daffy successfully exorcises the ghosts possessing a lady duck (with Daffy momentarily falling under possession from them himself), he discovers that Cubish has stripped his money down to his last million. He then receives a call from Porky, who is returning with Sylvester from their assignment to Dry Gulch, and Daffy reassigns him to the Superstition Mountains, much to Sylvester's chagrin. After receiving a call from Transylvania, Daffy then calls up Bugs and assigns him to investigate. Bugs encounters Count Blood Count, whom the rabbit defeats in a duel of magic words, but Daffy is displeased to hear from him about \"getting two couples together\". After receiving a call from the Himalayas, Daffy phones up Bugs again, who is leaving following his encounter with Count Blood Count, and together they go up against Hugo the Abominable Snowman, with Hugo repeatedly mistaking Daffy for a rabbit.\n\nWhen the city is swept with reports of a tiny elephant, Daffy, presuming this \"teensy-elephant thing\" to be mere hysteria, hopes to profit by soothing the public with his \"expert\" testimony. However, no sooner does he announce to the audience that there is no such thing as a tiny elephant then it turns up on Daffy's television interview, rendering him a public laughing stock.\n\nDaffy decides to blame the debacle on the absent Porky and absent-mindedly remarks that there was \"nothing wrong with a little dishonesty in business affairs.\" This proves to be Daffy's undoing, however, as upon realization of what he said, Daffy discovers that the safe is now completely empty except for a few cobwebs and a sign from Cubish: \"YOU LOSE, DUCK!\" Things get worse for a defeated Daffy when Egghead appears as a singing telegram, announcing to Daffy that due to unpaid rent, he is being dispossessed. After the repo crew takes away his desks, the building is condemned and destroyed, with Daffy still inside. Before impact, Daffy sadly tells the audience, \"One thing's for sure, I've got nowhere else to go but \"up\"!\"\n\nIn the \"epilog,\" Bugs is shown enjoying his vacation in Palm Springs (after the encounter with Hugo) and reading about Daffy's downfall (\"Quackbusted\", reports the newspaper Bugs is reading), and Porky and Sylvester are stranded in the Superstition Mountains, with Sylvester as cowardly as ever. After a shot of Cubish's grave is shown where it states that Cubish is still dead, it is revealed that Daffy is back where he started, as a street corner salesman, this time selling paranormal-themed trinkets (including wind-up dolls of Gossamer). However, when Daffy earns a dollar bill, it instantly vanishes. The film ends with Daffy angrily shaking his fist at the sky and screaming \"Cubish!\" (implying that Cubish is still haunting Daffy) which cuts to a 'Finis' card.\n\n\nSeveral cartoons are edited either for time, to connect with the plot, or have redubbed lines.\n\n\nThe film was released on DVD in the United States on August 4, 2009 by Warner Home Video. Three bonus cartoons are included as extras: \"Duck Dodgers and the Return of the 24½th Century\", \"Superior Duck\" and \"Little Go Beep\". It is also available on iTunes.\n\n\"The Duxorcist\" will see an individual release as part of the \"Looney Tunes Parodies Collection\"\n\n\n"}

Once the Army was dissolved Cassett resurfaced in the American Wrestling Association (AWA) in 1988, still working as Teijo Kahn. In the AWA he worked as the tag team partner of Soldat Ustinov, assisting Ustinov in a storyline feud against former Army partner Baron von Raschke and later on Sgt. Slaughter as well. Also in 1988 he spent some time in the Continental Wrestling Association (CWA), at one point getting involved in a CWA Heavyweight Title match between Jerry Lawler and Jimmy Jack Funk. In 1991 Kahn won Pro Wrestling America's PWA Heavyweight Championship, defeating Charlie Norris to win the title, holding it for 69 days before losing it back to Norris.\n\nIn 1986, Cassett had a part in the movie \"Body Slam\", where he portrayed a tag team, teaming with Sione Vailahi, also known as the Barbarian, managed by Captain Lou Albano. In 1992, he had a brief part in a movie called \"Equinox\", where he played \"I.M. Stong\" and was telling people how to use a clothesline.\n\n"}

As an executive function, self-control is a cognitive process that is necessary for regulating one's behavior in order to achieve specific goals.\n\nA related concept in psychology is emotional self-regulation. Self-control is thought to be like a muscle. According to studies, self-regulation, whether emotional or behavioral, was proven to be a limited resource which functions like energy. In the short term, overuse of self-control will lead to depletion. However, in the long term, the use of self-control can strengthen and improve over time.\n\nSelf-control is also a key concept in the general theory of crime, a major theory in criminology. The theory was developed by Michael Gottfredson and Travis Hirschi in their book titled \"A General Theory of Crime\", published in 1990. Gottfredson and Hirschi define self-control as the differential tendency of individuals to avoid criminal acts independent of the situations in which they find themselves. Individuals with low self-control tend to be impulsive, insensitive towards others, risk takers, short-sighted, and nonverbal. About 70% of the variance in questionnaire data operationalizing one construct of Self-Control had been found to be genetic.\n\nDesire is an affectively charged motivation toward a certain object, person, or activity, but not limited to, that associated with pleasure or relief from displeasure. Desires vary in strength and duration. A desire becomes a temptation when it impacts or enters the individual's area of self-control, if the behavior resulting from the desire conflicts with an individual's values or other self-regulatory goals. A limitation to research on desire is the issue of individuals desiring different things. New research looked at what people desire in real world settings. Over one week, 7,827 self-reports of desires were collected and indicated significant differences in desire frequency and strength, degree of conflict between desires and other goals, and the likelihood of resisting desire and success of the resistance. The most common and strongly experienced desires are those related to bodily needs like eating, drinking, and sleeping.\n\nDesires that conflict with overarching goals or values are known as temptations. Self-control dilemmas occur when long-term goals and values clash with short-term temptations. Counteractive Self-Control Theory states that when presented with such a dilemma, we lessen the significance of the instant rewards while momentarily increasing the importance of our overall values. When asked to rate the perceived appeal of different snacks before making a decision, people valued health bars over chocolate bars. However, when asked to do the rankings after having chosen a snack, there was no significant difference of appeal. Further, when college students completed a questionnaire prior to their course registration deadline, they ranked leisure activities as less important and enjoyable than when they filled out the survey after the deadline passed. The stronger and more available the temptation is, the harsher the devaluation will be.\n\nOne of the most common self-control dilemmas involves the desire for unhealthy or unneeded food consumption versus the desire to maintain long-term health. An indication of unneeded food could also be over expenditure on certain types of consumption such as eating away from home. Not knowing how much to spend, or overspending one's budget on eating out can be a symptom of a lack of self control. Experiment participants rated a new snack as significantly less healthy when it was described as very tasty compared to when they heard it was just slightly tasty. Without knowing anything else about a food, the mere suggestion of good taste triggers counteractive self-control and prompted them to devalue the temptation in the name of health. Further, when presented with the strong temptation of one large bowl of chips, participants both perceived the chips to be higher in calories and ate less of them than did participants who faced the weak temptation of three smaller chip bowls, even though both conditions represented the same amount of chips overall. Weak temptations are falsely perceived to be less unhealthy, so self-control is not triggered and desirable actions are more often engaged in, supporting the counteractive self-control theory. Weak temptations present more of a challenge to overcome than strong temptations, because they appear less likely to compromise long-term values.\n\nThe decrease in an individual's liking of and desire for a substance following repeated consumption of that substance is known as satiation. Satiation rates when eating depend on interactions of trait self-control and healthiness of the food. After eating equal amounts of either clearly healthy (raisins and peanuts) or unhealthy (M&Ms and Skittles) snack foods, people who scored higher on trait self-control tests reported feeling significantly less desire to eat more of the unhealthy foods than they did the healthy foods. Those with low trait self-control satiated at the same pace regardless of health value. Further, when reading a description emphasizing the sweet flavor of their snack, participants with higher trait self-control reported a decrease in desire faster than they did after hearing a description of the healthy benefits of their snack. Once again, those with low self-control satiated at the same rate regardless of health condition. Perceived unhealthiness of the food alone, regardless of actual health level, relates to faster satiation, but only for people with high trait self-control.\n\nThinking that is characterized by high construals, whenever individuals \"are obliged to infer additional details of content, context, or meaning in the actions and outcomes that unfold around them\", will view goals and values in a global, abstract sense. Whereas low level construals emphasize concrete, definitive ideas and categorizations. Different construal levels determine our activation of self-control in response to temptations. One technique for inducing high-level construals is asking an individual a series of \"why?\" questions that will lead to increasingly abstracted responses, whereas low-level construals are induced by \"how?\" questions leading to increasingly concrete answers. When taking an Implicit Association Test, people with induced high-level construals are significantly faster at associating temptations (such as candy bars) with \"bad,\" and healthy choices (such as apples) with \"good\" than those in the low-level condition. Further, higher-level construals also show a significantly increased likelihood of choosing an apple for snack over a candy bar. Without any conscious or active self-control efforts, temptations can be dampened by merely inducing high-level construals. It is suggested that the abstraction of high-level construals reminds people of their overall, lifelong values, such as a healthy lifestyle, which deemphasizes the current tempting situation.\n\nPositive correlation between linguistic capability and self-control has been inferred from experiments with common chimpanzees.\n\nHuman self-control research is typically modeled by using a token economy system. A token economy system is a behavioral program in which individuals in a group can earn tokens for a variety of desirable behaviors and can cash in the tokens for various backup, positive reinforcers. The difference in research methodologies with humans - using tokens or conditioned reinforcers versus non-humans using sub-primary forces suggested procedural artifacts as a possible suspect. One aspect of these procedural differences was the delay to the exchange period. Non-human subjects can and most likely would access their reinforcement immediately. The human subjects had to wait for an \"exchange period\" in which they could exchange their tokens for money, usually at the end of the experiment. When this was done with the non-human subjects, in the form of pigeons, they responded much like humans in that males showed much less control than females. Logue, (1995), who is discussed more below, points out that in her study done on self-control it was male children who responded with less self-control than female children. She then states, that in adulthood, for the most part, the sexes equalize on their ability to exhibit self-control. This could imply a human's ability to exert more self-control as they mature and become aware of the consequences associated with impulsivity. This suggestion is further examined below.\n\nMost of the research in the field of self-control assumes that self-control is in general better than impulsiveness. As a result, almost all research done on this topic is from this standpoint and very rarely is impulsiveness the more adaptive response in experimental design.\n\nSelf-control is a measurable variable in humans. In the worst circumstances people with the most or high self-control and resilience have the best odds of defying the odds they are faced with, which could be poverty, bad schooling, unsafe communities, etc. Those at a disadvantage with high self-control go on to higher education and professional jobs, but this seems to have a negative effect on their health.\n\nWhen looking at people who come from advantage backgrounds with high self-control, we see a different phenomenon happening. Those who come from an advantaged background tend to be high-achieving and with their achievement comes good health. The psychological phenomenon known as “John Henryism” posits that when goal-oriented, success-minded people strive ceaselessly in the absence of adequate support and resources, they can—like the mighty 19th-century folk legend who fell dead of an aneurysm after besting a steam-powered drill in a railroad-spike-driving competition—work themselves to death. Or, at least, toward it. In the 1980s Sherman James a socio-epidemiologist from North Carolina found that black Americans in the state suffered disproportionately from heart disease and strokes. He too landed on \"John Henryism\" as the cause of this phenomenon.\n\nMore recently some in the field of developmental psychology have begun to think of self-control in a more complicated way that takes into account that sometimes impulsiveness is the more adaptive response. In their view, a normal individual should have the capacity to be either impulsive or controlled depending on which is the most adaptive. However, this is a recent shift in paradigm and there is little research conducted along these lines.\n\nB.F. Skinner's \"Science and Human Behavior\" provides a survey of nine categories of self-control methods.\n\nThe manipulation of the environment to make some responses easier to physically execute and others more difficult illustrate this principle. This can be referred to as physical guidance which is the application of physical contact to induce an individual to go through the motions of a desired behavior. This concept can also be referred to as a physical prompt. Examples of this include clapping one's hand over one's own mouth, placing one's hand in one's pocket to prevent fidgeting, and using a ‘bridge’ hand position to steady a pool shot all represent physical methods to affect behavior.\n\nManipulating the occasion for behavior may change behavior as well. Removing distractions that induce undesired actions or adding a prompt to induce it are examples. Hiding temptation and reminders are two more. The need to hide temptation is a result of its effect on the mind. A common theme among studies of desire is an investigation of the underlying cognitive processes of a craving for an addictive substance, such as nicotine or alcohol. In order to better understand the cognitive processes involved, the Elaborated Intrusion (EI) theory of craving was developed. According to the EI theory, craving persists because individuals develop mental images of the coveted substance that are instantly pleasurable, but which also increase their awareness of deficit. The result is a cruel circle of desire, imagery, and preparation to satisfy the desire. This quickly escalates into greater expression of the imagery that incorporates working memory, interferes with performance on simultaneous cognitive tasks, and strengthens the emotional response. Essentially the mind is consumed by the craving for a desired substance, and this craving in turn interrupts any concurrent cognitive tasks. Obviously a craving for nicotine or alcohol is an extreme case, but nevertheless the EI theory holds true for more normal motivations and desires.\n\nDeprivation is the time in which an individual does not receive a reinforcer, while satiation occurs when an individual has received a reinforcer to such a degree that it will temporarily have no reinforcing power over them. If we deprive ourselves of a stimulus, the value of that reinforcement increases. For example, if an individual has been deprived of food, they may go to extreme measures to get that food, such as stealing. On the other hand, when we have an exceeding amount of a reinforcer, that reinforcement loses its value; if an individual eats a large meal, they may no longer be enticed by the reinforcement of dessert.\n\nOne may manipulate one's own behavior by affecting states of deprivation or satiation. By skipping a meal before a free dinner one may more effectively capitalize on the free meal. By eating a healthy snack beforehand the temptation to eat free \"junk food\" is reduced.\n\nAlso noteworthy is the importance of imagery in desire cognition during a state of deprivation. A study conducted on this topic involved smokers divided into two groups. The control group was instructed to continue smoking as usual until they arrived at the laboratory, where they were then asked to read a multisensory neutral script, meaning it was not related to a craving for nicotine. The experimental group, however, was asked to abstain from smoking before coming to the laboratory in order to induce craving and upon their arrival were told to read a multisensory urge-induction script intended to intensify their nicotine craving. Once the participants finished reading the script they rated their craving for cigarettes. Next they formulated visual or auditory images when prompted with verbal cues such as \"a game of tennis\" or \"a telephone ringing.\" After this task the participants again rated their craving for cigarettes. The study found that the craving experienced by the abstaining smokers was decreased to the control group's level by visual imagery but not by auditory imagery alone. That mental imagery served to reduce the level of craving in smokers illustrates that it can be used as a method of self-control during times of deprivation.\n\nWe manipulate emotional conditions in order to induce certain ways of responding. One example of this can be seen in theatre. Actors often elicit tears from painful memories if it is necessary for the character they are playing. This idea is similar to the notion if we read a letter, book, listen to music, watch a movie, in order to get us in the \"mood\" so we can be in the proper state of mind for a certain event or function. Additionally, treating an activity as \"work\" or \"fun\" can have an effect on the difficulty of self-control.\n\nIn order to analyze the possible effects of the cognitive transformation of an object on desire, a study was conducted based on a well-known German chocolate product. The study involved 71 undergraduate students, all of whom were familiar with the chocolate product. The participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: the control condition, the consummatory condition, and the nonconsummatory transformation condition. Each group was then given three minutes to complete their assigned task. The participants in the control condition were told to read a neutral article about a location in South America that was devoid of any words associated with food consumption. Those in the consummatory condition were instructed to imagine as clearly as possible how consuming the chocolate would taste and feel. The participants in the nonconsummatory transformation condition were told to imagine as clearly as possible odd settings or uses for the chocolate. Next, all the participants underwent a manipulation task that required them to rate their mood on a five-point scale in response to ten items they viewed. Following the manipulation task, participants completed automatic evaluations that measured their reaction time to six different images of the chocolate, each of which was paired with a positive or a negative stimuli. The results showed that the participants instructed to imagine the consumption of the chocolate demonstrated higher automatic evaluations toward the chocolate than did the participants told to imagine odd settings or uses for the chocolate, and participants in the control condition fell in-between the two experimental conditions. This indicates that the manner in which one considers an item influences how much it is desired.\n\nAversive stimulation is used as a means of increasing or decreasing the likelihood of target behavior. Similar to all methods of self-management, there is a controlling response, and a controlled response. An averse stimuli is sometimes referred to as a punisher or simply an aversive. Closely related to the idea of a punisher is the concept of punishment. Punishment is the idea that in a given situation, someone does something that is immediately followed by a punisher, then that person is less likely to do the same thing again when she or he next encounters a similar situation. An example of this can be seen when a teenage stays out past curfew. After staying out past curfew the teenagers parents ground the teenager. Because the teenager has been punished for his or her behavior he or she is less likely to stay out past their curfew again, thus decreasing the likelihood of the target behavior.\n\nCertain types of drugs affect self-controls. Stimulants, such as methylphenidate and amphetamine, improve inhibitory control in general and are used to treat ADHD. Similarly, depressants, such as alcohol, represent barriers to self-control through sluggishness, slower brain function, poor concentration, depression and disorientation.\n\nOperant conditioning sometimes referred to as Skinnerian conditioning is the process of strengthening a behavior by reinforcing it or weakening it by punishing it. By continually strengthening and reinforcing a behavior, or weakening and punishing a behavior an association as well as a consequence is made. Similarly, a behavior that is altered by its consequences is known as operant behavior There are multiple components of operant conditioning; these include reinforcement such as positive reinforcers and negative reinforcers. A positive reinforcer is a stimulus which, when presented immediately following a behavior, causes the behavior to increase in frequency. Negative reinforcers are a stimulus whose removal immediately after a response cause the response to be strengthened or to increase in frequency. Additionally, components of punishment are also incorporated such as positive punishment and negative punishment. Examples of operant conditioning can be seen every day. When a student tells a joke to one of his peers and they all laugh at this joke, this student is more likely to continue this behavior of telling jokes because his joke was reinforced by the sound of their laughing. However, if a peer tells the student his joke is \"silly\" or \"stupid\", he will be punished by telling the joke and his likelihood to tell another joke is greatly decreased. Another example of operant conditioning can be seen in the form of quitting a habit such as smoking. By using this technique to quit smoking, self-discipline must be displayed as the smoker must stop giving into their addiction.\n\nSelf-punishment of responses would include the arranging of punishment contingent upon undesired responses. This might be seen in the behavior of whipping oneself which some monks and religious persons do. This is different from aversive stimulation in that, for example, the alarm clock generates escape from the alarm, while self-punishment presents stimulation after the fact to reduce the probability of future behavior.\n\nPunishment is more like conformity than self-control because with self-control there needs to be an internal drive, not an external source of punishment that makes the person want to do something. There is external locus of control which is similar to determinism and there is internal locus of control which is similar to free will. With a learning system of punishment the person does not make their decision based upon what they want, rather they base it on the external factors. When you use a negative reinforcement you are more likely to influence their internal decisions and allow them to make the choice on their own whereas with a punishment the person will make their decisions based upon the consequences and not exert self-control. The best way to learn self-control is with free will where people are able to perceive they are making their own choices.\n\nSkinner noted that various philosophies and religions exemplified this principle by instructing believers to love their enemies. When we are filled with rage or hatred we might control ourselves by 'doing something else' or more specifically something that is incompatible with our response.\n\nFunctional imaging of the brain has shown that self-control is correlated with an area in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), a part of the frontal lobe. This area is distinct from those involved in generating intentional actions, attention to intentions, or select between alternatives. This control occurs through the top-down inhibition of premotor cortex. There is some debate about the mechanism of self-control and how it emerges. Traditionally, researchers believed the bottom-up approach guided self-control behavior. The more time a person spends thinking about a rewarding stimulus, the more likely he or she will experience a desire for it. Information that is most important gains control of working memory, and can then be processed through a top-down mechanism. Increasing evidence suggests that top down processing plays a strong role in self-control. Specifically, top-down processing can actually regulate bottom-up attentional mechanisms. To demonstrate this, researchers studied working memory and distraction by presenting participants with neutral or negative pictures and then a math problem or no task. They found that participants reported less negative moods after solving the math problem compared to the no task group, which was due to an influence on working memory capacity.\n\nThere are many researchers working on identifying the brain areas involved in the exertion of self-control; many different areas are known to be involved. In relation to self-control mechanisms, the reward centers in the brain compare external stimuli versus internal need states and a person's learning history. At the biological level, a loss of control is thought to be caused by a malfunctioning of a decision mechanism. A mechanistic explanation of self-control is still in its infancy. However, there is strong demand for knowledge about these mechanism because knowledge of these mechanisms would have tremendous clinical application.\nMuch of the work on how the brain reaches decisions is based on evidence from perceptual learning.\n\nMany of the tasks that subjects are tested on are not tasks typically associated with self-control, but are more general decision tasks. Nevertheless, the research on self-control is informed by more general research on decision tasks. Sources for evidence on the neural mechanisms of self-control include fMRI studies on human subject, neural recordings on animals, lesion studies on humans and animals, and clinical behavioral studies on humans with self-control disorders.\n\nThere is broad agreement that the cortex is involved in self-control. The details of the final model have yet to be worked out. However, there are some enticing findings that suggest a mechanistic account of self-control could prove to have tremendous explanatory value. What follows is a survey of some of the important recent literature on the brain regions involved in self-control.\n\nThe prefrontal cortex is located in the most anterior portion of the frontal lobe in the brain. It forms a larger portion of the cortex in humans. The dendrites in the prefrontal cortex contain up to 16 times as many dendritic spines as neurons in other cortical areas. Due to this, the prefrontal cortex integrates a large amount of information. The orbitofrontal cortex cells are important factors for self-control. If an individual has the choice between an immediate reward or a more valuable reward which they can receive later, an individual would most likely try to control the impulse to take that immediate reward. If an individual has a damaged orbitofrontal cortex, this impulse control will most likely not be as strong, and they may be more likely to take the immediate reinforcement. Additionally, we see lack of impulse control in children because the prefrontal cortex develops slowly.\n\nTodd A. Hare \"et al.\" use functional MRI techniques to show that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) are crucially involved in the exertion of self-control. They found that activity in the vmPFC was correlated with goal values and that the exertion of self-control required the modulation of the vmPFC by the DLPFC. The study found that a lack of self-control was strongly correlated with reduced activity in the DLPFC. Hare's study is especially relevant to the self-control literature because it suggests that an important cause of poor self-control is a defective DLPFC.\n\nAlexandra W. Logue is interested in how outcomes change the possibilities of a self-control choice being made. Logue identifies three possible outcome effects: outcome delays, outcome size, and outcome contingencies. The delay of an outcome results in the perception that the outcome is less valuable than an outcome which is more readily achieved. The devaluing of the delayed outcome can cause less self-control. A way to increase self-control in situations of a delayed outcome is to pre-expose an outcome. Pre-exposure reduces the frustrations related to the delay of the outcome. An example of this is signing bonuses.\n\nOutcome size deals with the relative, perceived size of possible outcomes. There tends to be a relationship between the value of the incentive and the desired outcome; the larger the desired outcome, the larger the value. Some factors that decrease value include delay, effort/cost, and uncertainty. The decision tends to be based on the option with the higher value at the time of the decision.\n\nFinally, Logue defines the relationship between responses and outcomes as outcome contingencies. Outcome contingencies also impact the degree of self-control that a person exercises. For instance, if a person is able to change his choice after the initial choice is made, the person is far more likely to take the impulsive, rather than self-controlled, choice. Additionally, it is possible for people to make precommitment action. A precommitment action is an action meant to lead to a self-controlled action at a later period in time. When a person sets an alarm clock, they are making a precommitted response to wake up early in the morning. Hence, that person is more likely to exercise the self-controlled decision to wake up, rather than to fall back in bed for a little more sleep.\n\nCassandra B. Whyte studied locus of control and academic performance and determined that internals tend to achieve at a higher level. Internals may perceive they have options from which to choose, thus facilitating more hopeful decision-making behavior as opposed to dependence on externally determined outcomes that require less commitment, effort, or self-control.\n\nMany things affect one's ability to exert self-control, but it seems that self-control requires sufficient glucose levels in the brain. Exerting self-control depletes glucose. Reduced glucose, and poor glucose tolerance (reduced ability to transport glucose to the brain) are correlated with lower performance in tests of self-control, particularly in difficult new situations. Self-control demands that an individual work to overcome thoughts, emotions, and automatic responses/impulses. These strong efforts require higher blood glucose levels. Lower blood glucose levels can lead to unsuccessful self-control abilities. Alcohol causes a decrease of glucose levels in both the brain and the body, and it also has an impairing effect on many forms of self-control. Furthermore, failure of self-control occurs most likely during times of the day when glucose is used least effectively. Self-control thus appears highly susceptible to glucose.\n\nAn alternative explanation of the limited amounts of glucose that are found is that this depends on the allocation of glucose, not on limited supply of glucose. According to this theory, the brain has sufficient resources of glucose and also has the possibility of delivering the glucose, but the personal priorities and motivations of the individual cause the glucose to be allocated to other sites. This theory has not been tested yet.\n\nIn the 1960s, Walter Mischel tested four-year-old children for self-control in \"The Marshmallow Test\": the children were each given a marshmallow and told that they can eat it anytime they want, but if they waited 15 minutes, they would receive another marshmallow. Follow up studies showed that the results correlated well with these children's success levels in later life.\n\nA strategy used in the marshmallow test was the focus on \"hot\" and \"cool\" features of an object. The children were encouraged to think about the marshmallow's \"cool features\" such as its shape and texture, possibly comparing it to a cotton ball or a cloud. The \"hot features\" of the marshmallow would be its sweet, sticky tastiness. These hot features make it more difficult to delay gratification. By focusing on the cool features, the mind is adverted from the appealing aspects of the marshmallow, and self-control is more plausible.\n\nYears later Dr. Mischel reached out to the participants of his study who were then in their 40s. He found that those who showed less self-control by taking the single marshmallow in the initial study were more likely to develop problems with relationships, stress, and drug abuse later in life. Dr. Mischel carried out the experiment again with the same participants in order to see which parts of the brain were active during the process of self-control. The participants received scans through M.R.I to show brain activity. The results showed that those who exhibited lower levels of self-control had higher brain activity in the ventral striatum, the area that deals with positive rewards.\n\nReviews concluded that self-control is correlated with various positive life outcomes, such as happiness, adjustment and various positive psychological factors. Self-control was also negatively correlated with sociotropy which in turn is correlated with depression.\n\nThere's conflicting evidence about whether will power is finite, infinite or self-reinforcing resource, a phenomenon sometimes termed ego depletion or reverse ego depletion. However, belief that will-power is infinite or self-reinforcing is associated with greater will power, voluntary executive function.\n\nExerting self-control through the executive functions in decision making is held in some theories to deplete one's ability to do so in the future. Ego depletion is the view that high self-control requires energy and focus, and over an extended period of self-control demands, this self-control can lessen. There are ways to help this ego depletion. One way is through rest and relaxation from these high demands. Additionally, training self-control with certain behaviors can also help to strengthen an individual's self-control. This seems to be particularly effective in those who would otherwise have difficulty controlling their impulses in the domain of interest. Another way to overcome unwanted desires is to change the method with which we approach desire. One study in particular analyzed the impact of approaching a temptation by defining it in abstract, general terms as opposed to specific, concrete details. For the purposes of the study, approaching a situation using general terms was defined as the high-level construal condition whereas using specific details was termed the low-level construal condition. The study involved 42 college students who were randomly assigned to either the high-level or low-level construal condition. The participants were then presented with a packet that described five scenarios, each one involving a unique self-control conflict. For those participants in the high-level construal condition the scenarios were described using only general terms and for those in the low-level construal condition the scenarios were described using only specific details. After imagining themselves in each scenario, the participants were asked to indicate how bad they would feel if they indulged in the temptation using a six-point scale ranging from \"not at all bad\" to \"very bad.\" The data showed that participants in the high-level construal condition reported greater negative evaluations of temptations than did participants in the low-level construal conditions. This implies that individuals using high-level construals are better able to place a temptation in context and properly evaluate its long-term impact, and therefore are more likely to maintain self-control.\n\n\n"}

The building is owned and operated by BentallGreenOak.\n\nThe KPMG Tower was built on a plot of land owned by the Christ Church Cathedral, which lies directly in front of the building when viewed from Saint Catherine Street. It was designed by WZMH Architects and was styled to relate to the cathedral.\n\nThe tower incorporates an underground shopping centre, \"Promenades Cathédrale\", as part of the underground city that is connected to the Metro.\n\nThe building was originally called \"Maison des Coopérants\" for the then-anchor tenant, as can be seen on the inscription in the lobby; however, it was later named \"Place de la Cathédrale\". At the end of 2005 the tower was renamed to its current name for KPMG, the new anchor tenant that occupies floors 6 to 15 and part of the 17th.\n\nPart of its local claim to fame was that the Promenades Cathédrale shopping mall underneath the tower, built at the same time, was built beneath the existing Christ Church Cathedral. It was a sight to behold, as the Cathedral was perched on top of cement piles with the soil removed from under it, resulting in a cathedral that seemed to be floating in mid air. From time to time, the building administration runs an exhibit in the shopping mall displaying the construction of the complex. A consequence of this arrangement is that the cathedral no longer has its proverbial basement. The functions traditionally done in the church basement are now performed in a space reserved for the church on the third floor of the tower's east side.\n\nAt the time of its opening, the shopping mall had three floors with a food court occupying most of the lower floor. Later renovations converted that shopping floor into a second floor of parking garage.\n\nA memorial to Raoul Wallenberg stands in a small park between the office tower and church, where a bust of Wallenberg and a caged metal box (styled as a barbed-wire gate) stand beside each other.\n\nThe building features prominently during the Temptation of Christ scene in the 1989 Denys Arcand film \"Jesus of Montreal\", reflecting the tower's status as the most prominent and modern skyscraper built in Montreal during the late 1980s as well as its unique relationship with the church.\n\nThe building contains the headquarters of Gildan Activewear and holds offices for the professional services firm KPMG, law firm Blake, Cassels & Graydon, Empire Life, and the offices of the Anglican Diocese of Montreal.\n\n\n"}

There are also malign and mischievous yakshinis with poltergeist-like behaviours, that can haunt and curse humans according to Indian folklore.\n\nThe ashoka tree is closely associated with yakshinis. The young girl at the foot of the tree is an ancient motif indicating fertility on the Indian Subcontinent. One of the recurring elements in Indian art, often found as gatekeepers in ancient Buddhist and Hindu temples, is a yakshini with her foot on the trunk and her hands holding the branch of a stylized flowering ashoka or, less frequently, other tree with flowers or fruits.\n\nThe three sites of Bharhut, Sanchi, and Mathura, have yielded huge numbers of Yakshi figures, most commonly on the railing pillars of stupas. These show a clear development and progression that establishes certain characteristics of the Yakshi figure such as her nudity, smiling face and evident (often exaggerated) feminine charms that lead to their association with fertility. The yakshi is usually shown with her hand touching a tree branch, in a sinuous \"tribhanga\" pose, thus some authors hold that the young girl at the foot of the tree is based on an ancient tree deity.\n\nYakshis were important in early Buddhist monuments as a decorative element and are found in many ancient Buddhist archaeological sites. They became Salabhanjikas (sal tree maidens) with the passing of the centuries, a standard decorative element of both Indian sculpture and Indian temple architecture.\n\nThe sal tree \"(Shorea robusta)\" is often confused with the ashoka tree \"(Saraca indica)\" in the ancient literature of the Indian Subcontinent. The position of the Salabhanjika is also related to the position of Queen Māyā of Sakya when she gave birth to Gautama Buddha under an asoka tree in a garden in Lumbini, while grasping its branch.\n\nIn \"Uddamareshvara Tantra\", thirty-six yakshinis are described, including their mantras and ritual prescriptions. A similar list of Yakshas and yakshinis are given in the \"Tantraraja Tantra\", where it says that these beings are givers of whatever is desired. They are the guardians of the treasure hidden in the earth. \n\nThe list of thirty six yakshinis given in the \"Uddamareshvara Tantra\" is as follows:\n\nBelow is a nonexhaustive list of yakshinis found in Buddhist literature:\n\nIn Jainism, there are twenty-five yakshis, including Panchanguli, Chakreshvari, Ambika, and Padmavati, who are frequently represented in Jain temples. Each is regarded as the guardian goddess of one of the present tirthankar Shri Simandhar Swami and twenty-four Jain \"tirthankara\". The names according to Tiloyapannatti (or Pratishthasarasangraha) and Abhidhanachintamani are:\n\nIn the horror fictions of Malayalam literature, Yakshis are mostly not considered benevolent. They are being portrayed by people alluring men and finally killing them. The following are the prominent fiction characters.\n\nOne of the most famous Kerala Christian legendary stories of Yakshis is that of Kalliyankattu Neeli, a powerful demoness who was fabled to have finally been stopped by the legendary Christian priest Kadamattathu Kathanar. The Yakshi theme is the subject of popular Keralite tales, like the legend of the Yakshi of Trivandrum, as well as of certain movies in modern Malayalam cinema.\n\nAnother lesser known Yakshi is Mangalathu Sreedevi also known as Kanjirottu Yakshi. She was born into a Padamangalam Nair tharavad by name Mangalathu at Kanjiracode in South Travancore. She was a ravishingly beautiful courtesan who had an intimate relationship with Raman Thampi, son of King Rama Varma and rival of Anizhom Thirunal Marthanda Varma.\n\nMangalathu Sreedevi was infatuated with one of her servants, Raman. Raman, a Pondan Nair (palanquin-bearer), was a fair, tall, well-built and handsome young man. She and her brother Govindan used to ride on Raman's back to nearby places. A predatory sadist, Sreedevi enjoyed torturing Raman physically and mentally. She did everything possible to separate him from his wife.\n\nIn course of time, the unmarried Govindan and Raman became bosom friends. They often shared the same room. Sreedevi was not quite comfortable with the growing fondness of her brother for her lover. But she did not act.\n\nSreedevi hatched a plot and killed Raman's wife. Once Govindan was travelling on Raman's back when the former revealed the details of the plot. Days later, Raman strangled Sreedevi to death when they were sharing a bed. Govindan winked at the crime and protected his beloved friend.\nSreedevi was reborn as a vengeful Yakshi to a couple at Kanjiracode. She grew into a bewitching beauty within moments of her birth. Though she seduced many men and drank their blood, her heart was set on the handsome Raman. She told him that she was willing to pardon him if he married her. Raman flatly refused. The Yakshi channeled all her energies in tormenting him. Devastated, Raman sought the assistance of Mangalathu Govindan, who was a great upasaka of Lord Balarama. Govindan was for a compromise. He said that the Yakshi could have Raman for a year provided she conformed to three conditions. One, she must agree to be installed at a temple after one year. Two, after many years the temple will be destroyed and she must then seek refuge in (saranagati) Lord Narasimha for attaining moksham. Three, she must pray for Govindan and his relationship with Raman not only in their current birth but also in their subsequent births. The Yakshi swore upon 'ponnum vilakkum' that she would abide by all the three conditions. Thus the compromise formula worked.\n\nA year later, the Yakshi was installed at a Temple which later came to be owned by Kanjiracottu Valiaveedu. The Temple does not exist anymore.\n\nSundara Lakshmi, an accomplished dancer and consort of HH Swathi Thirunal Rama Varma, was an ardent devotee of Kanjirottu Yakshi Amma.\n\nAfter taking refuge in Lord Narasimha of Thekkedom, the Yakshi is now believed to be residing in Kallara B of Sri Padmanabhaswamy Temple. The enchanting and ferocious forms of this Yakshi are painted on the south-west part of Sri Padmanabha's shrine.\n\n"}
{"id": "1875088", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1875088", "title": "Scott Symons", "text": "Scott Symons\n\nHugh Brennan Scott Symons (July 13, 1933 – February 23, 2009), known professionally as Scott Symons, was a Canadian writer. He was most noted for his novels \"Place d'Armes\" and \"Civic Square\", among the first works of LGBT literature ever published in Canada, as well as a personal life that was often plagued by scandal and interpersonal conflict.\n\nHe was openly gay at a time when this was very difficult, publishing his first novel, \"Place d'Armes,\" which dealt directly with homosexuality, two years before gay sex was decriminalized in Canada. He was an avid diarist, and many of his observations and episodes from his life found their way into his novels. His writing style was marked by experimental forms and structures, with one of his novels being published as handwritten pages packaged in a box, and by a blurring of the lines between fiction and non-fiction.\n\nHe was born in Toronto, Ontario, the son of businessman and writer Harry L. Symons and the brother of academic Thomas Symons. A rebellious teenager, his parents sent him to Trinity College School in Port Hope, where he took up gymnastics and established a lifelong friendship with journalist Charles Taylor. He also first came to realize that he was gay, falling in love with a fellow student but repressing his feelings in sport. Symons would later describe the experience as emotionally crippling, leaving him an \"eternal thirteen; eternally the boy reaching out to touch but never being allowed to do so… except as Mommy and Authority permitted.\"\n\nOne night while practicing in the gymnasium, he fell off the high bar and broke his back, and was immobilized in a body cast for several months. After completing high school, he enrolled at the University of Toronto, where he earned a bachelor's degree in modern history as well as enlisting as a naval cadet and serving on the student government. He subsequently pursued graduate studies at Cambridge University.\n\nStill attempting to repress his sexuality, Symons married Judith Morrow, the granddaughter of a president of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, in 1958. Taylor was his best man.\n\nHe briefly took a job on the editorial page of the \"Toronto Telegram\", but was soon fired for not being deferential to his bosses; he then took a job with the \"Quebec Chronicle-Telegraph\", and integrated so quickly into the intellectual elites of Quebec that he was invited to join the St-Jean-Baptiste Society even though he was neither francophone nor Roman Catholic.\n\nSymons and his wife spent some time studying at the Sorbonne in 1959; during this time, he met writer Julien Green, whom Symons would later describe as having reawoken his dormant sexuality. Symons and his wife returned to Canada the following year with their newborn son Graham after Symons accepted a job with \"La Presse\" in Montreal. While there, he won a National Newspaper Award for a series of articles about the early stirrings of what would become Quebec's Quiet Revolution.\n\nWith the nomadic restlessness that would characterize much of his life, however, he soon quit journalism and returned to Toronto, taking a job as a curator at the Royal Ontario Museum; within a few years, he was also an assistant professor of fine art at the University of Toronto, and briefly held a visiting curatorship at the Smithsonian Institution and a research associate's position at the Winterthur Museum. He was later offered a permanent position at the Smithsonian, but declined.\n\nDuring this period he began to write but never finished a book on Canadian history and a stage play, and botched an audition to host \"This Hour Has Seven Days\".\n\nIn 1965 he fled the family farm in Claremont and holed up in a small hotel in Montreal for 21 days, during which he wrote \"Place d'Armes\".\n\n\"Place d'Armes\" contained both autobiographical and metafictional elements; its protagonist Hugh Anderson was, like Symons, a wealthy but socially alienated man from Toronto abandoning his comfortable bourgeois life to hole up in a hotel in Montreal, rediscovering himself in sex with male prostitutes in Place d'Armes, and in turn writing his own novel within a novel about Andrew, a character who himself fit the same profile as both Symons and Anderson. The writing was liberally peppered with sexualized puns such as \"fingertits\", \"cocktit\" and \"assoul\". The novel did not garner favourable reviews upon its publication in 1967; writing in the \"Toronto Star\", Robert Fulford deemed Anderson as \"the most repellent single figure in the recent history of Canadian writing\", and criticized Symons, whom he called \"the monster from Toronto\", for being incapable of writing about love. Despite the criticism, however, \"Place d'Armes\" won the Beta Sigma Phi First Canadian Novel Award. Its critical reception has improved over time; in 2005, the \"Literary Review of Canada\" named \"Place d'Armes\" as one of the 100 most important books in Canadian literary history.\n\nHe followed up in 1969 with \"Civic Square\", a novel whose working title \"The Smugly Fucklings\" was nixed by publisher Jack McClelland. The novel was noted for its unconventional form — a series of polemical letters addressed to \"Dear Reader\" — and presentation; 848 pages in length, it was neither typeset nor bound, but rather the original handwritten manuscript was duplicated by Gestetner, hand-decorated by Symons and then packaged in a blue box which was wrapped in white ribbon and emblazoned with a wax seal, with the title stamped on the box in silver ink. (Due to its unique format, the novel was published only as a limited edition, and was not widely available until Dundurn Press reissued it as a conventional paperback in 2007.) Once the project had been completed, Symons took a copy of the novel and placed it in the collection plate at his parents' church, Toronto's St. James Cathedral.\n\nAround this time, Symons left his wife and entered his first long-term relationship with another man, a 17-year-old student named John McConnell. This relationship led to an incident which came to define public awareness of Symons; while media reports claimed that Symons had \"run off to Mexico with an underage boy\", in reality Symons had travelled to Mexico to attend an artists' retreat in San Miguel de Allende with York Wilson and Leonard Brooks rather than with McConnell, who had been sent by his parents to Nassau; McConnell separately travelled to Mexico, of his own accord, when he learned of Symons' whereabouts. Regardless, McConnell's parents posted a reward for Symons' arrest, putting police forces in Canada, the United States and Mexico on his trail, although the reward and arrest warrant were rescinded after McConnell contacted his family and threatened to commit suicide if Symons were jailed. Symons and McConnell then spent some time living in northern British Columbia, although they returned to Toronto by 1970. The pair continued to move frequently, residing at different times in Toronto, San Miguel de Allende and Trout River, Newfoundland and Labrador.\n\nDespite this, Symons was hurt by the process of divorcing Judith, often insisting that he still loved her and wanted to stay married to her even if his actual conduct suggested otherwise. By this point, Symons was also virtually estranged from his own birth family, some of whom never saw him again until he was near death.\n\nIn 1971, Symons published the non-fiction book \"Heritage: A Romantic Look at Early Canadian Furniture\". Although packaged and formatted as a coffee table book, Symons conceptualized it as a \"furniture novel\", deliberately blurring the lines between fiction and non-fiction by incorporating a narrative aspect which verged on erotic in some of its descriptions of the furniture.\n\nHe and McConnell broke up soon afterward.\n\nBy 1973, Symons had left Canada to live in Essaouira, Morocco, which would remain his primary residence for much of the remainder of his life. He was the subject of a chapter in Graeme Gibson's non-fiction work \"Eleven Canadian Novelists\", published that same year.\n\nIn 1977, he published \"The Canadian Bestiary: Ongoing Literary Depravity\", a scathing review of Marian Engel's novel \"Bear\", in \"West Coast Review\" (Vol. 11, No. 3). The review digressed to criticize many of the era's Canadian literary figures, including Irving Layton, Robertson Davies, Mordecai Richler, Victor Coleman, Jacques Godbout and Coach House Press, effectively burning many of Symons' bridges. Around the same time, Taylor published \"Six Journeys: a Canadian Pattern\", which included a biographical essay about Symons. In 1979, he published a series of essays in \"The Globe and Mail\" under the title \"Canada: A Loving Look\". He was also a regular contributor to \"The Body Politic\".\n\nHis third and final novel, \"Helmet of Flesh\", was published in 1986. Semi-autobiographical like his earlier works, \"Helmet of Flesh\" centred on York Mackenzie, a Canadian man fleeing to Morocco after the breakup of his relationship with a younger man. The novel had been sent to Dennis Lee for editing several years before it was published. Upon the release of \"Helmet of Flesh\", Symons described his guiding philosophy in an interview with June Callwood for \"The Globe and Mail\": \"I gave up everything so, first of all, I could feel, and in feeling, I could see, and in seeing, with some inner exploration, I could express...You have to risk. Sometimes I risk to the point of an anarchy, but I risk.\" Although purportedly the first book of a trilogy, no follow-up books to \"Helmet of Flesh\" have been published as of 2014.\n\nIn 1990, he published two essays in \"The Idler\", a critique of Margaret Atwood and a defense of Mazo de la Roche. Having published relatively little new writing since leaving Canada, however, he spent most of his time in Morocco relying primarily on financial support from Taylor.\n\nHe was in a relationship with Aaron Klokeid for much of his time living in Morocco; despite this, he strongly identified with the subversive \"outlaw\" aspects of homosexuality and disliked the increasing normalization and acceptance of gay people. He had little interest in participating in the gay liberation movement, and even harshly criticized Pierre Trudeau for decriminalizing homosexuality in his 1968 revision of the Criminal Code. Despite his frequent opposition to conventional sexual values, however, he often railed against the decline of Canada's British and French cultural traditions; he was especially outraged by Canada dropping the Canadian Red Ensign in favour of the contemporary maple leaf Flag of Canada, and dismissed many of the mainstream cultural institutions of Canada — including the Canada Council, Massey College, the Parliament of Canada and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation — as \"a Finishing School System for Wesleyans\". In an \"Ottawa Citizen\" column after Symons' death, former \"Idler\" editor David Warren characterized Symons as a \"violent Tory of the old school\".\n\nSymons returned to Toronto in 1986 for the publication of \"Helmet of Flesh\", and in 1998 for an appearance at Toronto's International Festival of Authors on the release of \"God's Fool\", a documentary film about him by filmmaker Nik Sheehan, and \"Dear Reader: Selected Scott Symons\", an anthology of his published and unpublished writings edited by Christopher Elson. In declining health and with his financial support having dried up after Taylor's death, he returned to Toronto permanently in 2000.\n\nIn an interview with \"The Body Politic\" during his visit to promote \"Helmet of Flesh\", Symons articulated his philosophy of sexual identity: \"I am certainly a \"devoted\" homosexual. Nobody could doubt my credentials. But I think, politically, we allowed this word gay to...It buggers up a nice word. It doesn't cover what we are. A lot of us are not very joyous. We have a hard life to live, against the current. Gay doesn't cover that — and worst of all, it labels us. They can dismiss you and put you off in a corner: \"Oh, he's gay,\" and that's it. That's the end. You can no longer be central to what's going on. That's tragic...The world loses central contact with some of the most beautiful, sentient, sensitive and agitated, creative and emotional people in our society. The result is that a lot of people who operate centrally in our society can't let on that they're gay. It's tragic. It's very dangerous.\"\n\nHe published a few journalism pieces in the \"National Post\" and worked on an unpublished novella, \"Kali's Dance\". Both of his earlier novels, \"Place d'Armes\" and \"Civic Square\", were reissued by Dundurn Press in the late 2000s.\n\nHe eventually moved into a nursing home, and died there in 2009 at the age of 75. Along with Robin Hardy and Norman Elder, he was the subject of a chapter in Ian Young's 2013 book \"Encounters with Authors: Essays on Scott Symons, Robin Hardy, Norman Elder\".\n\n"}

It was active in the late 1930s and early 1940s, and was individualist in outlook. It campaigned for a reduction in the size of government, a reform of the civil service, a limit on the powers of political parties, and an end to the governing Labour Party's \"socialist\" policies.\n\nAlthough the Movement had a relatively high political profile, it did not achieve any notable successes. In April 1940, the Movement was joined by Albert Davy, an astute political organiser who had been credited with successful campaigns for the United Party and the Reform Party. However his Democrat Party formed in 1934 only split the conservative vote in the and the , and aided the 1935 Labour landslide.\n\nAgain, Davy and the People's Movement failed to make much impact. In February 1941, a faction of the Movement merged into the National Party, and in 1942, Davy branched off to found the New Zealand Co-operative Party.\n\nIn the 1943 elections, the remnants of the People's Movement (organised by Davy) sponsored 25 candidates under the name of the \"Independent Group\" or \"Independent People's Group\" (IPG), but the candidates got only 7,389 votes (0.89%; provisional vote count) and none were elected.\nDavy complained that the 1943 election was decided on \"strictly party\" lines, and said that the effect of the Democratic Labour Party standing was to give six seats to the National Party.\n"}

Asgiriya Stadium is the private property of Trinity College, Kandy. It is around a 10-minute walk from the centre of the city. The venue would usually be used when an international team toured Sri Lanka for a Test Match. Asgiriya became Sri Lanka's the second Test venue, after the Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu Stadium, when it hosted Greg Chappell’s Australian cricket team in Sri Lanka in 1982–83.\n\nPrior to Asgiriya being built, Trinity College played their cricket at the Bogambara Stadium. In 1904 Rev. Alec Garden Fraser assumed office as Principal, he was conscious about the lack of a suitable playing space for the school and the lack of a cricket pitch. Fraser acquired an abandoned wasteland owned by the War Department, the site being at Asgiriya, 270 meters away from the school. The lease rental of the land at the time was Rs. 30 per year. In 1910 Trinity was given permission to build their own ground. The stadium broke ground in 1909 and was built until 1915.\n\nThe ground was opened ceremonially by the Governor, Sir Robert Chalmers, on 15 January 1915. The first inter-school match was between Trinity and S. Thomas' College, Mount Lavinia on 24 and 25 February 1915.\n\nBefore gaining Test status, one of the ICC requirements for Sri Lanka was to improve the infrastructure of its international venues. In 1981 the former Chairman of Sri Lanka Cricket, Gamini Dissanayake, an old Trinitian, took charge of upgrading Asgiriya into an international cricket stadium, which he did in a period of 150 days. On 5 January 1982 President J. R. Jayewardene ceremonially opened the stadium. Jayewardene also opened the pavilion in 1982.\n\nThe first cricket match at Asgiriya was against the Australian cricket team in Sri Lanka in 1982–83, becoming Sri Lanka's the second Test venue, after the Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu Stadium. Test matches were played regularly until the match against England in 2007-08. Sri Lanka won that Test, with Muttiah Muralitharan claiming his 709th Test wicket to go past Shane Warne as the highest wicket taker in Test cricket.\nSri Lanka's first Test win at Asgiriya came in 1998 against Zimbabwe, 15 years after the ground hosted its first Test. More success soon followed in the coming years as Sri Lanka won their first Test against Australia in 1999, which was Sri Lanka's first Test win against Australia; a game remembered for the dreadful collision between Steve Waugh and Jason Gillespie. Both players had to be airlifted to Colombo for medical treatment after being seriously injured. Waugh broke his nose while Gillespie had a broken bone in his shin.\n\nAsgiriya has also hosted a 1996 Cricket World Cup fixture between Sri Lanka and Kenya, when Sri Lanka made 398, the highest World Cup score at the time and highest ODI team total until 400 passed.\n\nAsgiriya Stadium has hosted a total of 22 Test Matches and seven of them have been won by Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka Cricket decided to shift all international cricket to Pallekele, about 15 kilometers from the city, but it is possible that Asgiriya will get an occasional international match.\n\nIn December 2014 it was announced that the stadium would be renovated and improved, with a new electronic scoreboard.\n\nSurrounded by mountains in the ancient Sri Lankan hill capital of Kandy, Asgiriya is considered by ESPNcricinfo to be one of the most beautiful venues on earth.\n\nThe stadium has the unique distinction of being the only Test class cricket stadium in the world to be owned and maintained by a secondary school, Trinity College, Kandy an elite private boys school in Sri Lanka. Ranjan Madugalle, Ravi Ratnayeke, Nilantha Ratnayake, Kumar Sangakkara, and Kaushalya Weeraratne, Niroshan Dickwella all of whom represented Sri Lanka at the highest level at cricket, are but a few who honed their budding cricketing talents at Asgiriya whilst schoolboys at Trinity.\n\nUpdated 4 September 2017\n\n\n\n"}

It comprised alternating rows of closed washer-like rings punched from iron sheets and rows of riveted rings made from drawn wire that ran horizontally, producing very flexible, reliable and strong armour. Each ring had an inside diameter of about 5 mm, and an outside diameter of about 7 mm. A standard \"lorica hamata\" weighed around 11 kg, though this would vary depending on the design and the materials used.\n\nThe Romans' knowledge of mail manufacture may have come from 3rd century BC conflicts with the Celts, though the first documented use occurred during the Roman conquest of Hispania. There were several versions of this type of armour, specialized for different military duties such as skirmishers, cavalry and spearmen.\n\nThe shoulders of the \"lorica hamata\" had flaps that were similar to the Greek \"linothorax\" which ran from about mid-back to the front of the torso, and were connected by brass or iron hooks which connected to studs riveted through the ends of the flaps. Up to 30,000 rings went into one \"lorica hamata\", and the estimated production time was two months, even with continual slave labor at the state-run armouries.\n\nAlthough labor-intensive to manufacture, it is thought that, with good maintenance, the armour could be used for several decades.\n\nOver its lifetime, \"lorica hamata\" remained in constant use by legionaries and it was the preferred armour of centurions, who favored its greater coverage and lower maintenance. Constant friction kept the rings of the \"lorica hamata\" free of rust, unlike the \"lorica segmentata\", which needed constant maintenance to prevent corrosion.\n\nDuring the 1st century AD it was starting to be supplemented by \"lorica segmentata\", but had been reintroduced as sole standard-issue armour by the 4th century. The \"lorica hamata\" was still common among the legionary soldiers in the 2nd century, despite the use of the more popularly recognized \"lorica segmentata\" segmented plate armour. \"Lorica segmentata\" was eventually put out of use in the early 4th century for unknown reasons, but \"lorica hamata\" remained common for both legionaries and auxiliaries. Later versions had sleeves and covered the legs to the knees.\n\n"}

In May 2005, Billikopf accepted a visiting faculty appointment as an honorary professor of agricultural labor management at the University of Chile in Santiago. Billikopf is a frequent national and international speaker (including United States, as well as in Russia, México, Canada, Uganda, Colombia, Argentina, Spain, Japan, New Zealand and his native Chile) in his field.\n\nHis agricultural extension research and teaching efforts have focused on such topics as employee selection, compensation, performance appraisal, discipline and termination, supervision, interpersonal relations, conflict resolution, and interpersonal negotiation skills. Billikopf is the recipient of the 1989 National Association for County Agricultural Agents (NACAA) Achievement Award and the 2006 Distinguished Service Award. He has received a number of other awards from NACAA, including two National Winner communication awards: Webpage in 1999 (Agricultural Labor Management); and Publication in 2006 (for his book Labor Management in Agriculture: Cultivating Personnel Productivity, 2nd Edition, 2003).\n\nBillikopf's maternal family have been grape growers in Chile for generations. It is at the labor-intensive family vineyard, where Gregorio spent much of his youth, that he first developed an interest in labor issues, horses and agriculture. While doing a search in the internet, Billikopf found that this interest in conflict management also runs in the family. His paternal grandfather, Jacob Billikopf, is listed as a \"notable arbitrator\" whose writings are included in the Cornell University School of Industrial Relations' Kheel Center for Labor-Management Documentation and Archive and elsewhere. On his Chilean side, he is related to historian Francisco Antonio Encina, author of Historia de Chile.\n\nBillikopf has authored numerous articles published in academic journals, several books including \"Labor Management in Agriculture\" (1994, 2003) and \"Party Directed Mediation: Facilitating Dialogue Between Individuals\" (3rd Edition, 2014), and portrays practical examples of Party-directed mediation an emerging specialty within the field of alternative dispute resolution. He presented his two mediation models, Party-directed mediation (PDM) and Negotiated Performance Appraisal (NPA), for dealing with peer to peer conflict and supervisor-subordinate conflict, respectively, at the International Association for Conflict Management [IACM] annual meetings in 2005 (Seville, Spain) and 2009 (Kyoto, Japan).\n\nRaised in Chile's Central Valley, Billikopf went on to obtain his bachelor of science in plant science from UC Davis, and his master of arts in labor management from California State University, Stanislaus. Since his retirement from the University of California, Billikopf and his wife reside in Llanquihue, Chile, in what is called the Lake Region, and are the parents of four children and a growing number of grandchildren. Special interests include activities as a dressage (equestrian sports) instructor, amateur radio operator, a soccer referee and a student of the Hebrew Holy Scriptures, especially Isaiah and the latter prophets (NEVI'M). On his Jewish side, Gregorio is the grandson of Jacob Billikopf (involved in social work, Jewish philanthropy and labor arbitration) and great-grandson of Louis Marshall (corporate, constitutional and civil rights lawyer as well as a mediator and Jewish community leader). On his Chilean side, Gregorio is related to Francisco Antonio Encina, author of the 20 volume \"Historia de Chile\". In March 1974, after reading the Book of Mormon, Billikopf became a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n\n\n"}

Glaze took over vocal duties in 1982 after Hart left the band, while still contributing some additional guitar parts on some of the band's songs. His vocal range caught the attention of many record label A & R's and therefore he was credited for bringing Pantera to the forefront of heavy metal music, but a dispute in the band's direction led to Glaze's departure.\n\nIn 1986, Glaze joined three Tennessee rockers to form the band Lord Tracy, releasing one LP (\"Deaf Gods of Babylon)\" in 1989 on MCA records backed UNI records. The band broke up in 1991, and he formed another band, Blowphish, which included Mike Malinin (Goo Goo Dolls). When Blowphish failed to land a major record deal, he moved to Prince George's County, Maryland, where he currently plays locally with his party band, The Crayfish, and occasionally gets together with other local musicians. \n\nIn May 2006, Glaze appeared throughout VH1's \"Behind the Music: Pantera\", notable moments include him talking about Darrell being buried with the famous guitar of Eddie Van Halen, used around the \"Van Halen II\" era.\n\nIn April 2010, Rex Brown invited Glaze onstage during an Arms Of The Sun gig in Dallas to perform a couple of old Pantera tracks - \"All Over Tonight\" and \"Come-On Eyes\". It was the first time since 1986 that Glaze had played with a former Pantera band-mate.\n\nHe currently lives in Bowie, Maryland with his wife, Lori Glaze, and two children.\n\n\n\n"}

It was formed of parts of the former ridings of Alberni-Nanaimo and The Islands. In the 1966 election the Nanaimo riding name was restored and the southern part of the riding became Saanich and the Islands. That area is now part of Saanich North and the Islands.

It also lost Valdes and Lasqueti Islands.\n\nFrom 1986 to 1991, the riding returned two members. In 1991, the riding shrunk in size. The northern part of the riding, including the northern coast of the City of Nanaimo was transferred to Parksville-Qualicum, while the southern boundary was moved up to the southern limit of the Nanaimo Regional District, except for Valdes Island, which was added back to the riding.\n\nIn 2001, the riding's western boundaries were extended to include nearly all of the Nanaimo C Electoral Area.\n\nIn 2009, the riding was drastically reduced in size, consisting solely of part of the city of Nanaimo.

{"id": "1875139", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1875139", "title": "Urbie Green", "text": "Urbie Green\n\nUrban Clifford \"Urbie\" Green (August 8, 1926December 31, 2018) was an American jazz trombonist who toured with Woody Herman, Gene Krupa, Jan Savitt, and Frankie Carle.\n\nHe played on over 250 recordings and released more than two dozen albums as a soloist, and was highly respected by his fellow trombonists. Green's trombone sound was especially noted for its warm, mellow tone, even in the higher registers where he was more fluent than most trombonists. His technique was considered flawless by many in the music industry and he played in major jazz festivals, motion picture soundtracks, concert halls, nightclubs, radio, television and the White House. He was inducted into the Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame in 1995.\n\nBorn in Mobile, Alabama, Green was taught the piano as a child by his mother, jazz and popular tunes from the beginning. He picked up the trombone, which both older brothers played, when he was about 12. Although he listened to such trombone greats as Tommy Dorsey, J. C. Higginbotham, Jack Jenney, Jack Teagarden and Trummy Young he has said that he was more influenced by the styles of Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker, and Lester Young. Urbie's trombone style was also influenced by vocalists such as Perry Como, and the vocal style of Louis Armstrong.\n\nGreen's father died when he was 15 and Urbie went straight into professional music, first joining the Tommy Reynolds Band in California before moving on to stints with Bob Strong, Jan Savitt, and Frankie Carle. Green also played with The Auburn Knights Orchestra, a college big band based in Auburn, Alabama while attending Auburn High School.\n\nIn 1947, Green joined Gene Krupa's band and quickly moved up to Woody Herman's third \"Thundering Herd\" big band in 1950 to play with his brother, Jack. His soaring ballad style was featured on such solos as Hoagy Carmichael's \"Skylark\", and provided a contrast to Herman's previous First Herd rough-and-ready trombone star, Bill Harris. In 1953 he moved to New York City, quickly establishing himself as the premier trombonist in the booming recording industry and in 1954 he was voted the \"New Star\" trombonist in the International Critics Poll from Down Beat magazine. His style was not as blues-influenced as others, in that he was among the few players who commanded the high tessitura favored by Glenn Miller, Tommy Dorsey, and Jack Jenney with an agility that was not shown by these previous trombonists in their recordings. Some of his solos provided the highlights on one-hit wonder albums from Verve Records, such as that of organist Walter Wanderly, as well as established artists like Herbie Mann.\n\nHe recorded with virtually all of the major jazz musicians of the 1950s and 1960s and led his own groups while also joining tours as a featured performer, including a three-month tour leading the Benny Goodman Orchestra and fronting the Tommy Dorsey orchestra after Dorsey's death in 1956.\n\nHe collaborated with innovative producer Enoch Light for the Command and Project 3 labels, producing what are probably his most notable recordings, such as the two-volume sets \"The Persuasive Trombone of Urbie Green\" and \"21 Trombones\". He was sideman and soloist on the album project \"'s Continental\" by Ray Conniff and his orchestra and chorus (1961).\n\nThe 1980s and beyond saw a slowing down of Urbie Green's recording career. Both albums recorded by him during this period are live, straight jazz works; \"Just Friends\", and \"Sea Jam Blues\".\n\nGreen spent his later life with his second wife Kathy, a jazz singer, at their home in the Poconos region of Pennsylvania. The couple had two children, Jesse and Casey. Jesse is a jazz pianist and lives nearby, while Casey is a TV / Film Director / Producer in Los Angeles, California. Urbie's first wife was Darlein Dietz and they had two children, Urban Clifford Green Jr. and James Preston Green.

He holds a degree in marketing from Washington State University, and a law degree from Gonzaga University. While attending Washington State University he joined the Delta Upsilon fraternity.\n\nLittle currently works at NASCAR as a managing director for technical inspection and officiating. Little had previously been director of the Camping World Truck Series, as well as the director of racing development for Mexico as well as the Whelen Modified Tour. He keeps regular office hours in the sanctioning body's research and development center in Concord, North Carolina. He also was a part-time studio analyst for Speed Channel. He is the father of Jesse Little.\n\nLittle began racing the short tracks in Washington in the mid-1980s. He soon began racing in the American Speed Association West late model series, the NASCAR Northwest Tour Series and the NASCAR Winston West Series. One year after being named the NASCAR Winston West Rookie of the Year, Little clinched that series' championship in 1987.\n\nLittle made his NASCAR Winston Cup debut in 1986 at Riverside International Raceway, driving the No. 28 Ford owned by George Jefferson. He started 25th and finished 13th. He ran the other Riverside race that year, but finished 35th after suffering engine failure. He ran both the Riverside races the next year, finishing 15th both times in the No. 95 Coors Ford.\n\nThe following year, Little was eligible for NASCAR Winston Cup Rookie of the Year honors and signed to drive the No. 90 for Junie Donlavey. However, his best finish was an eighteenth, at the Coca-Cola 600, and he was released early in the season. In 1989, he missed United Airlines Flight 232. About a third of the passengers aboard the flight perished during its emergency landing in Iowa. In 1990, Little and his father Chuck teamed to field their own entry, the No. 19 Ford sponsored by Bull's Eye Barbecue Sauce. He ran eighteen races and had seven top-twenty finishes, garnering a 33rd-place points finish. The following season, Little made his first full-time attempt at winning the Cup championship, qualifying for 28 out of 29 races and posting a tenth-place finish at Charlotte Motor Speedway, finishing 27th in points.\n\nIn 1992, Little signed to drive the No. 66 TropArctic-sponsored Ford for Cale Yarborough, but was released six races into the season. Later he caught on to the No. 9 Ford fielded by Melling Racing, and had an eighth-place finish at Talladega. He also made his Busch Series debut that year, starting and finishing 29th in the No. 37 Maxx Race Cards-sponsored Oldsmobile at Watkins Glen International.\n\nIn 1993, Little, along with Greg Pollex and former NFL quarterback Mark Rypien, formed Mark Rypien Motorsports, running the No. 23 If It's Paper-Bayer Select-sponsored Ford on a limited basis that year, posting a second-place finish at Dover International Speedway. The next year, the team went full-time and Little had ten top-five finishes, finishing third in points. He also drove the No. 97 Ford at the Daytona 500 that season, finishing 29th. In 1995, Little broke through and won six races during the course of the season, including the first two races of the season, at Daytona and Rockingham, and finished second in points, behind Johnny Benson. His other wins were at Loudon, Charlotte, Talladega and South Boston. Little did not win a race the following season, however, and slipped to sixth in points. He also ran nine Cup races, five in Pollex's No. 97 Sterling Cowboy-sponsored Pontiac Grand Prix, and another four for Diamond Ridge Motorsports, posting a 20th-place finish at Darlington Raceway,\n\nIn 1997, Little returned to the Cup Series, running the No. 97 Pontiac for Pollex with a sponsorship from John Deere. He finished seventh at the Food City 500, but the team struggled to make races. Late in the year, Jack Roush purchased the team to be added to his stable for 1998. Little ended 1997 36th in points.\n\nIn 1998, Little drove for Roush full-time with Jeff Hammond as crew chief. Running 32 out of 33 races, he had seven top-tens, including a second-place run at Texas, finishing behind Mark Martin, and finished a career-high 15th in points. He was unable to duplicate that performance in 1999, posting just five top-tens and finishing 23rd in points. After just one top-ten in 2000, Roush announced Little would not drive the 97 the following season. Late in the year, Little was pulled out of the car and replaced by his successor, Kurt Busch with Hammond still as crew chief. During the season, he also ran a handful of races in the Busch Series. Originally running the No. 30 for Innovative Motorsports, he was released and posted a top-ten in a one-race deal with PPI Motorsports.\n\nLittle had 217 career Cup starts in all.\n\nIn 2001, Little signed to drive the No. 74 Staff America-sponsored Chevrolet Monte Carlo for BACE Motorsports in the Busch Series. He had six Top 10’s and finished ninth in points. He started off 2002 running for BACE, but the team closed after three races due to sponsor issues. He made his final Cup start in a BACE car at Dover that year, finishing 33rd. He has not run NASCAR since.\n\nIn 2004, Chad called several Truck and Xfinity races from the booth.\n\nChad later provided competition support for the NASCAR Mexico Corona Series, and became the tour director for the Whelen Modified Tour.\n\nStarting in 2013, Chad took on the role of NASCAR Camping World Truck Series managing director. On February 2, 2015, NASCAR announced that Little would be moving into a new role, as a managing director of technical inspection and officiating. His role as director was replaced by another former driver, Elton Sawyer.\n\n"}
{"id": "1875158", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1875158", "title": "Alien Nine", "text": "Alien Nine\n\nThe English adaptation of the series was first licensed by Central Park Media, and has played on Comcast's Anime Selects. Central Park Media released the title under their \"US Manga Corps\" line, on a single DVD, and later re-released the DVD in a box set with all three manga volumes, which was also licensed by Central Park Media under their \"CPM Manga\" line. Central Park Media filed for bankruptcy in 2009, and the DVDs and manga volumes subsequently went out of print in North America.\n\nIn the year 2014, 16 years after humanity's first contact with aliens, Yuri Otani, a rather melancholic 12-year-old, has just arrived in the sixth grade at Elementary School No. 9. She is elected, against her wishes, by an overwhelming majority of her classmates in the \"Tsubaki\" (Camellia) Class to join the \"Alien Party\", a team whose primary objective is to capture any otherworldly aliens that may appear on campus, advised by the teacher Megumi Hisakawa. To make matters even worse for Yuri, the only way to capture the aliens is to adjoin with a Borg, a symbiotic life-form whose sole purpose is to protect their host, incapacitate, and ultimately capture other aliens, using anything available to their arsenal (which includes, but is not limited to: Borgs, inline roller blades, knee pads, tranquilizer dart guns, and lacrosse sticks.) Yuri is not alone in her tribulations, for she has two other Alien Party member friends - Kasumi Tōmine and Kumi Kawamura. Over time it becomes clear that Kumi and Kasumi are far more capable alien fighters than Yuri, who is terrified of the aliens and wants nothing more than to leave the Alien Party.\n\nIt is subsequently revealed that Ms. Hisakawa is the one releasing the aliens for the alien fighters to train with, as the Alien Party is really intended to raise suitable human hosts for symbiotic fusion with the Borg of the Drill Clan (Ms. Hisakawa herself being one result of the process). In an attempt to push Yuri harder in order to speed up her progress, Ms. Hisakawa gives three boys in the school the aggressive \"Gladius\" parasitic alien in order to serve as training targets because of the apparently \"relatively weak\" nature of the alien. She also instructs Yuri to take care of the aliens in the alien storeroom by herself, setting her up for the three boys to corner and attack her. However, this backfires when Yuri is overcome by fear and panic, causing her Borg to overreact and kill every alien in the storeroom (including the \"Gladius\" aliens). As she walks out of the storeroom to meet her close friend Miyu, traumatized and still wearing her Borg, she encounters Kumi and Kasumi (who telepathically sense her overwhelming fear through their connection with their Borgs) and also ends up killing their Borgs as her own Borg instinctively lashes out against the other aliens she fears. She finally collapses at Miyu's feet on her knees in tears, her own Borg dying due to the overreaction and falling off her head.\n\nAs a result of the incident, Ms. Hisakawa is rebuked by the headmistress of the school, Ms. Okada (another Borg-fused human), and informed that she may even be replaced by another advisor by the supervisors. With the Borgs dead, it will take about a month for her to create new ones with the memories of the old ones. Fortunately, the incident takes place just before the summer, and the alien fighters go on a vacation together with Miyu in order to cheer up Yuri and allow her to recover from the traumatizing incident with the \"Gladius\" aliens. With renewed determination, Yuri resolves to do better in the coming semester.\n\nAfter returning to school, a new alien type known as a \"Yellow Knife\" lands on the school. Kasumi displays an unusual attraction towards the \"Yellow Knife\" and ends up letting herself be consumed by it, somehow coming to identify it with her beloved older brother. In order to \"protect\" Kasumi by making sure nobody gets close to her, the \"Yellow Knife\" then starts projecting psychic waves that induce headaches in people unprotected by Borg symbiotes. The Alien Party remains unaffected and attempts to cut Kasumi out of the \"Yellow Knife\". Feeling threatened by the Alien Party and using her desperate loneliness following her older brother's departure for the United States, the \"Yellow Knife\" then projects her an illusion towards the Alien Party that makes them think they are completely alone in the world. Both Yuri and Kumi are emotionally crippled by the loneliness, but Kumi's Borg manages to snap her out of it and she is able to see through the illusion and reach Yuri. Together, they are able to fatally wound the \"Yellow Knife\" and extract Kasumi from it, but not before it manages to symbiotically fuse with Kasumi. Kasumi then proceeds to strangle Kumi for hurting the \"Yellow Knife\" until Yuri's pleas cause the \"Yellow Knife\" to convince her to stop, since their fusion meant that it would always be with her. The \"Yellow Knife\" then explodes, perishing.\n\nStill recovering from the \"Yellow Knife\" incident, Kumi is then discovered dead in the school library by Kasumi. It is at this point that the OVA series ends. In the manga, it is shown that Kumi had become suspicious of Kasumi's behavior following her rescue from the \"Yellow Knife\" and had gone into the library to research more about the \"Yellow Knife\" when she was attacked and killed. Her body severely damaged by the alien, she is then put under reconstruction with the cell gel. In the meantime, while looking for clues about the attacker, Yuri and Kasumi are themselves attacked by the alien, a \"Lynax\". The \"Lynax\" proves to be beyond the capabilities of Yuri and Kasumi, and they both begin to be overwhelmed. Sensing their desperation, Kumi's reconstruction is sped up by an unusual merging with her Borg, and she recovers just in time to save Yuri and Kasumi.\n\nFollowing this incident, Yuri, uncomfortable with Kasumi's unusual behavior and Kumi's apparent return from the dead, wanders into the Forest of Spaceships, a dangerous area of the school inhabited by aliens, where she is attacked and separated from her Borg. In order to protect its host, the Borg stores Yuri's memories, but has gone into hiding. In order to restore Yuri's memories, Kumi and Kasumi enter the forest in search of Yuri's Borg. There, they succeed in recovering the critically injured Borg but are themselves attacked by other aliens. Kasumi ends up revealing her fusion with the \"Yellow Knife\", successfully fending off and killing multiple attacking aliens, while Kumi's arm is torn off, revealing that she no longer has a human body: her arm is nothing more than a layer of skin surrounding several Borg drills. After recovering the Borg, they restore Yuri's memories. In the aftermath, Kasumi and the \"Yellow Knife\" inside her are interrogated by Ms. Hisakawa. The \"Yellow Knife\" remarks about how humans make good symbiotic hosts for aliens and that other aliens have figured out the strategy of the Drill Clan; they have now targeted humans for symbiosis as well. With Kasumi having fused with the \"Yellow Knife\" and Kumi herself turned into a Borg, losing human functions such as reproduction and no longer viable as a symbiotic host, Yuri is the only viable human host left among the Alien Party members for the Drill Clan. Kumi then resolves to protect Yuri from getting fused with \"any\" alien and enlists Kasumi's help.\n\nIn the third and final semester of school, Yuri's Borg begins to become agitated as it desperately wants to fuse with Yuri. Taking pity on it, Ms. Hisakawa allows Yuri's Borg to attempt to force Yuri to fuse with it, but Yuri resists and the Borg is stopped by Kumi and Kasumi. Meanwhile, the Sunflower Clan, mortal enemies of the Drill Clan, arrive at the school. They succeed in capturing Yuri and attempt to fuse with her and other students in the Tsubaki Class, but are far more aggressive and manipulative, resulting in serious injury to most students the Sunflowers attempt to fuse with. Kasumi attempts to disable Yuri using her \"Yellow Knife\" psychic abilities, but is overwhelmed by Yuri and three other boys controlled by the Sunflowers. The Sunflowers attempt to fuse with Kasumi, who struggles furiously against them, begging for them to be removed. Yuri, having not completely fused with the Sunflowers, removes the Sunflower from Kasumi just as Ms. Hisakawa and her Borg arrive to kill the Sunflowers and Yuri. Kumi, believing that Yuri can still be saved because she has not fused completely with the Sunflower, stops Ms. Hisakawa. With the help of Yuri's Borg, is able to reach into Yuri's mind and ultimately get her to overcome the Sunflowers.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Sunflower invasion, the Tsubaki Class is treated for their injuries, with the students permitted to miss the Japanese entrance exam and pick any junior high school they wish. Headmistress Okada points out to Ms. Hisakawa that it may be a good thing for the humans to be allowed to choose other clans or aliens they wished to fuse with. When Ms. Hisakawa replies that it will be much harder and they'll have to convince the humans that they'll be happier living with the Drill Clan, the headmistress chides her, saying she'd \"better get it together.\"\n\nThe following spring, Yuri has moved in together with Kasumi and Kumi, who are attending the same junior high school. While apparently still unchanged from her elementary school habits such as sleeping in late (much to Kumi's chagrin) and apparently still an ordinary human, as she wakes up and gets ready for school, she notices a lock of her hair has started curling into a drill.\n\nAlien Nine Emulators is set in the spring of 2015, picking up immediately after the end of Alien Nine. Yuri, Kumi, Kasumi, and Miyu are now students at the Hinode Junior High School, with the first three now sharing an apartment. Thinking she has put all alien-related matters behind her, Yuri is dismayed to find herself once again drafted as an alien fighter along with Kumi and Kasumi when a spaceship lands at Hinode. They are drafted by Monami Komai, a third-year student at Hinode who is herself an alien fighter and alien symbiont. \n\nYuri is subsequently kidnapped by 6th and 7th generation Borg symbionts, who intend to use her and another kidnapped student to evolve into 10th generation Borg symbionts. However, the older Borg symbionts are killed by an 8th generation Borg symbiont in order to evolve itself into a 10th generation Borg symbiont. The other alien fighters, along with Ms. Hisakawa who was sent by Principal Okada to investigate the reports of older generation Borg appearing at Hinode, arrive to rescue Yuri. Kumi recognizes the 8th generation Borg as the one who stabbed her in the library back in Elementary School No. 9, leading to her death at the hands of the \"Lynax\" alien. Enraged, she fights and kills the 8th generation Borg. Principal Okada subsequently informs Ms. Hisakawa that the \"committee\" suspects that Kumi may be a 10th generation Borg.\n\nA resurgence in the number of aliens arriving at the school leads to Ms. Hisakawa putting the fighters in charge of an \"alien district\"; since Yuri is not a symbiont, she is given an apparently defective Borg that cannot fuse with her for protection. However, the \"defective\" Borg is actually Ms. Hisakawa's fused Borg in disguise, assigned to observe the students. It observes Kumi feeling very lonely and homesick and crying in her apartment, thus ruling her out as a 10th generation Borg. Yuri has also become friends with a male schoolmate, which leads to the overprotective Kumi becoming jealous. While reporting its findings to Ms. Hisakawa, Kasumi becomes aware of the true nature of Yuri's Borg. Having tried to comfort Kumi during her bouts of loneliness, she and the Yellow Knife fused with her decide to help Kumi. \n\nIn May 2015, Kasumi enacts her plan, and a group of Yellow Knife aliens descend on the Hinode Junior High School. Using psychic interference waves to knock out nearly everyone within a radius of the school and begin to consume students. Kasumi also kills Ms. Hisakawa's Borg, much to her distress. Kasumi then wakes Kumi up, who is swallowed by a Yellow Knife. Revealing that Kumi is dying of loneliness from her refusal to fuse with Yuri, Kasumi tells Yuri that she has an obligation to save Kumi after all the times Kumi has saved her. Yuri is then engulfed by the same Yellow Knife. Ms. Hisakawa, still agitated by her Borg's death, steals the Principal's Borg and attempts to use it to kill Kasumi, but is stopped by Monami. However, Monami's Borg, on its own initiative, stabs Kasumi with a tendril, disabling her. Ms. Hisakawa then goes off to destroy the Yellow Knives and release the trapped students. Inside one of the Yellow Knives, the Borg within Kumi as now taken control and wishes to fuse with Yuri.\n\nHaving destroyed some of the Yellow Knives, Monami restrains Ms. Hisakawa before she can destroy the next Yellow Knife and chastises her for her callousness. However, the Yellow Knife releases an apparently fused Yuri and Kumi, much to their surprise. Restrained for examination, \"Yuri\" is revealed to be Kumi in disguise. Unwilling to sacrifice Yuri in order to save herself, Kumi begs Monami to kill her before her Borg takes over completely. Yuri crawls out from the Yellow Knife's stomach, but by the time she reaches the containment cell, Kumi's Borg has already taken over and she starts to lash out in desperation in order to fuse. In order to save Kumi, Monami disables Kumi and uses her Borg to transfer Kumi's memory into Kasumi's unfused Borg. The story ends with Kasumi and Ms. Hisakawa going to California along with Kumi in order to help her recover, while Yuri remains in Japan as a member of the Hinode Junior High Alien Fighters.\n\nAlien 9 Next is set 11 years after the original series, in September 2025. Yuri has now joined an alien pest handling company started by Monami, while Kumi, Ms. Hisakawa, and Kasumi (who is now Queen of the Yellow Knives) have embarked on a joint Yellow Knife-Borg venture, creating the first Earth-made \"Star Seed.\" Kumi, along with Borgs carrying Kasumi and Yuri's personalities, embarks on the maiden voyage of the Star Seed as an \"astro-navigator\". The craft ends up landing on the Borg homeworld, and Kumi is captured by the original Borg. Kasumi's Borg-Yellow Knife hybrid onboard the now-crippled Star Seed combines its power with Yuri's Borg to send a signal back to Earth to inform the team. However, the signal compels the Principal to \"obey the originals\" and she kills Kasumi, leaving two Borgs trapped in the Star Seed with no communications with Earth. Because of her fusion with the Yellow Knives, the Yellow Knives simply birth another Kasumi after she dies, who remarks that the original Borg are no longer a myth. The series ends with a man approaching Monami and Yuri with a request for the alien fighters.\n\n\nThe first half of the series (through the middle of Volume 2) was later adapted into an original video animation (OVA) series, which was released across four volumes by Bandai Visual from 2001 to 2002, containing one episode each. Animated by J.C.Staff and produced by Genco, the first volume of the series was directed by Jirō Fujimoto, while volumes 2-4 were directed by Yasuhiro Irie, who also handled the entire series' character designs, and was written by Sadayuki Murai. A special TV broadcast was aired prior to the series' DVD release on AT-X. The opening themes are \"Flower Psychedelic: Kasumi Tomine Version\" by Noriko Shitaya, \"Flower Psychedelic: Kumi Kawamura Version\" by Kaori Shimizu, and \"Flower Psychedelic: Yuri Otani Version\" by Juri Ihata, the ending theme is \"rebirth\" by en avant.\n\nIt has been broadcast by the anime television network Animax across its respective networks worldwide, including East Asia and its English-language networks in Southeast Asia (where it was previously also aired by its sister network AXN) and South Asia. The anime was licensed and released in North America by Central Park Media, with the series being aired across the region on Comcast's Select On Demand service. As the OVA series ends halfway through the story, the DVD was made available in America in an \"Ultimate Edition\", which included all three original volumes of the collected translated manga.\n\nTarō Maki (President of Genco and executive producer of the anime OVA adaptation) has stated in an interview that due to the abruptness of the anime OVA ending, he stated that will raise funds to continue the series. However, this has not happened for over a decade and is considered to be in development hell and is most likely cancelled. That does not, however, rule out the possibility of a reboot to cover all three of the manga volumes plus the sequel, \"Alien Nine Emulators\".\n\nBecause of its rarity and cheap price, it has somewhat become a cult classic amongst fans and collectors alike.\n\nOn Anime News Network, Zac Bertschy gave the story a grade of A and the art a grade of B+. Helen McCarthy in \"500 Essential Anime Movies\" praises the OVA's pace and interesting character designs, stating that \"although this looks at first like a cute, child-friendly sci-fi tale, it's actually a scare allegory on what it means to grow up\".\n\n"}

Gold served as a government witness and testified in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were convicted and executed in 1953 for their roles. Gold served 15 years in prison. \n\nBorn in Bern, Switzerland, to parents from the Russian Empire, Gold had immigrated to the US with his parents as a child at the age of four. They settled in Philadelphia. During the Great Depression, he found work and finished his degree in chemistry at night. He returned to work as a clinical chemist after release from prison.\n\nHeinrich Golodnitsky was born on December 12, 1910, in Bern, Switzerland to Samson and Celia (Ominsky) Golodnitsky, both Jewish immigrants from what is now Ukraine and was then part of the Russian Empire. Samson had grown up in Smila, where his father was a successful merchant. He was sent to Switzerland for additional schooling, as opportunities for Jews were limited in Russia, but he was already influenced by reading Leo Tolstoy, and chose to go into woodworking. He became a carpenter. Henrich's mother Celia had first emigrated from central Ukraine (Russia) as a teenager to Paris, where she studied dentistry. She had become radicalized in Russia and supported the Zionist movement. After running out of money, she took a job in a cigar factory in Bern, where she met Samson. They married about 1907 or 1908.\n\nWhen Heinrich was 4, his family immigrated to the United States, seeking more opportunity. After they arrived at New York in July 1914, an agent at Ellis Island suggested they shorten their surname to Gold, which they agreed to, and they kept that version. In the United States, the boy became known as Harry. They first went to Chicago, where Sam worked in a coalyard and Celia in a tobacco factory, both limited by their lack of English. After a year, they left. Sam went to Norfolk, Virginia, where he had some relatives. Celia took their son to Philadelphia, where her brother Shama had settled. When the shipyard job and conditions in Norfolk did not work out, Sam joined them in Philadelphia, a major industrial city. They settled in South Philadelphia in 1915 in the Jewish section. Ethnic Irish occupied territory to the north, and Italians to the west. After some other jobs, Sam found work as a cabinetmaker at the Victor Talking Machine Company in Camden, New Jersey, across the Delaware River. \n\nIn 1917, Gold’s mother had another son, named Yussel (Joseph) after a grandfather. Neighbors on Philip Street later described the Gold family as having been unusually quiet and stand-offish, but Harry Gold said he had a happy and secure childhood. He greatly enjoyed learning and was a good student in school. To supplement Sam's modest earnings, Celia taught Hebrew and Yiddish to neighborhood children, and was considered an excellent teacher. She expanded the lessons with Jewish folklore and Hebrew literature. \n\nBut in the early 20th century, immigrant groups in Philadelphia clashed over their territories; Gold as a boy in the neighborhood suffered with this, especially since he was small and slight, and non-athletic. His father complained of discrimination by newly hired Italian immigrants at the Victor Company, where he was one of the few Jews. In the mid-1920s an Irish foreman tried to drive him out of the factory, but he persisted. Gold admired his father's stoicism but resented the conflicts and developed a desire to fight prejudice. He had an early interest in chemistry and graduated from South Philadelphia High School in 1929.\n\nAfter high school graduation, Gold was offered a job by one of his father’s acquaintances at Giftcrafters, a woodworking firm in the northern Kensington section of the city. \n\nWhile looking for other positions, Gold applied and gained a job at the Pennsylvania Sugar Company, located on the banks of the Delaware River. A job there would give him economic security and the chance to work with college-educated chemists and state-of-the art labs. He saved money from his work and attended the University of Pennsylvania full time from 1930-1932 before his money ran out. The Great Depression was unfolding and he returned to PA Sugar to help his family.\n\nGold had expressed interest in the Socialist Party early in life, influenced by his mother, and the family bought the \"Jewish Daily Forward\". He later said that he thought Communism was related to \"a wild and vaguely defined phenomenon going on in a primitive country thousands of miles away.\" For other Americans, the economic crisis challenged faith in capitalism. A week before Christmas 1932, Gold was laid off by the sugar company. Both Harry and his father Sam looked for work each morning, to no avail. The Gold family faced economic ruin. \n\nGold was offered a job by Tom Black, a former classmate, at the Holbrook Manufacturing Company in Jersey City. Black befriended him and tried to recruit Gold to the Communist Party. Grateful to Black for his friendship and a chance to work, Gold reluctantly became involved. But he continued to hold his views against the Party. When Gold found that the PA Sugar Company was hiring at the same salary he was making, he decided to return to the company, Philadelphia, and his family. Black visited Gold and his family, all the while encouraging him to attend communist meetings and join the party. \n\nIn 1934, Gold started passing industrial secrets to Black from the sugar company. During this time, Gold also attended Drexel Institute of Technology, and took night courses in chemistry, to keep working toward his goal in chemistry. \n\nIn 1940, Jacob Golos activated Gold for Soviet espionage, but he was not a recruited agent of the \"rezidentura.\" In the late 1940s, Soviet Case Officer Semyon Semenov appropriated Gold from Golos for use by the NKVD. Gold became a formally recruited Soviet agent at this time, and was assigned the codename \"GUS, GOS,\" or \"GOOSE.\" Semenov remained Gold's control officer until March 1944. \n\nAfter the war, tensions increased between the US and the Soviet Union following its takeover of territory in Eastern Europe. Communist governments led East Germany, Poland, Yugoslavia, and other eastern nations dominated by the Soviet Union. The Cold War between the US and the Soviet Union had begun. \n\nIn 1950, Klaus Fuchs, an NKVD agent, was arrested in England and charged with espionage. Fuchs confessed that while working in the United States during World War II, he had passed information about the atom bomb to the Soviet Union, then a US ally. Fuchs denied working with other spies, except for a courier who collected information from him. When initially shown photographs of suspects, including Gold, he failed to identify him. After prompting by the prosecution, he identified Gold.\n\nGold was arrested that year. Under interrogation by US officials, he admitted that he had been involved in espionage since 1934 and had helped Fuchs pass information about the Manhattan Project to the Soviet Union by way of Soviet General Consul Anatoli Yakovlev. Gold's confession identified many other people connected to the espionage network, and led to the arrest of David Greenglass. He had worked as a machinist at the Manhattan Project and passed material to Gold. Greenglass's testimony resulted in the arrest in 1950 of his sister Ethel and her husband Julius Rosenberg, who were also charged with conspiracy to commit espionage. Gold cooperated and was a government witness in the trial of the Rosenbergs, as was Greenglass. The latter's testimony contributed to their convictions and death sentences; they were executed. \n\nUnable to make the $100,000 bail, Gold was jailed for 7 and a half months before his trial. In 1951, he was convicted and sentenced to 30 years' imprisonment. In May 1965, one of his appeals resulted in his being paroled for good behavior after serving less than half that time. He was also credited for the time in jail before his trial.\n\nGold returned to Philadelphia. He worked as a clinical chemist in the pathology lab of John F. Kennedy Memorial Hospital, and ultimately for the chief pathologist. He died on August 28, 1972, during heart surgery, at the age of 62. He had never married. He was interred in Har Nebo Cemetery in Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

During its early years, the network also aired a weather segment near the top of each hour featuring aviation forecast data from the National Weather Service. Discovery Communications filed a trademark application with the United States Copyright Office for the use of the name \"Military Channel\" in 2002, after the trademark was abandoned by an unrelated start-up cable network based in Louisville, Kentucky, also named \"The Military Channel\", which went dark in 1999 and later went bankrupt. That network – which focused on the heroes, history and hardware of the international military scene – experienced difficulty raising capital, despite early success.\nOn January 10, 2005, the network was rebranded as the Military Channel. Carrying over from its original format, many of the network's programs as the Military Channel were dedicated to aerial warfare and related technologies and issues. In 2005, the channel aired its first live program from Philadelphia at the site of the Army–Navy college football game, two hours before that game's kickoff, in which Fox Sports commentator Chris Myers hosted from a set outside of Lincoln Financial Field.\n\nOn March 3, 2014, the channel was rebranded as American Heroes Channel, with the intent to \"provide more history based, narrative-style documentary programming.\" The network is a sponsor of the United Service Organizations (USO) and frequently runs commercials for that organization.\n\nMany of the programs featured on American Heroes Channel are war documentaries, the contents of which deal in large part with modern warfare, and in particular the U.S. military from World War II onward. While the A+E Networks-owned History, Military History and H2 air similar programming, those networks tend to show more programs about other time periods and cultures (ancient, Roman, Medieval, Eastern, and other forms of warfare). AHC has a more contemporary subject matter than those competitors, but it occasionally presents historical programming as well. Actor Dennis Haysbert serves as the network's continuity announcer for its on-air promotions.\n\nIn addition, the channel also presents feature films with a military theme (usually within the hosted movie series \"An Officer and a Movie\", which is hosted by Lou Diamond Phillips), as well as individual episodes of other shows (such as \"Belly of the Beast\", \"Build It Bigger\", \"Extreme Machines\", \"Timewatch\" and \"Unsolved History\"), which incorporate military-related content.

Robert Parker. Robert and his brother Ron co-owned Continental Championship Wrestling for a time.\n\nFuller started wrestling in 1970 in the Alabama and Tennessee regions. He often teamed with his cousin Jimmy Golden and they won many tag team titles.\n\nIn the 1980s, he took his brother Ron's idea and made a stable called The Stud Stable. Among the members in the independent versions of this stable were Golden, Sid Vicious, Cactus Jack, Dutch Mantel, Brickhouse Brown, Gary Young, and Brian Lee.\n\nHe spent some time in the American Wrestling Association with Golden in 1988, and they feuded with The Rock 'n' Roll Express (Ricky Morton and Robert Gibson). He also wrestled in the Texas area where he teamed with Jeff Jarrett.\n\nIn 1993, Fuller went to World Championship Wrestling as manager Col. Robert Parker, a takeoff of Col. Tom Parker of Elvis Presley fame. He managed Sid Vicious and teamed with manager Harley Race and his protege, Vader to form \"The Masters of the Powerbomb\". They feuded with Sting and Davey Boy Smith. In 1994, he managed \"Stunning Steve\" Austin before reforming his \"Stud Stable\" with Golden as \"Bunkhouse Buck\", Meng, Dick Slater, Terry Funk and Arn Anderson. They feuded heavily with Dusty and Dustin Rhodes. In 1995, Col. Parker courted Sherri Martel to the dismay of both the Stud Stable and Sherri's charges, Harlem Heat. Parker and Sherri went to get married and Sherri was attacked by Madusa, who was supposed to be Parker's wife. Parker and Sherri split and feuded and then made up again, with Parker leaving the Stud Stable to help Sherri manage Harlem Heat. While with Harlem Heat, Parker's official title was \"promoter\", while Sherri retained the \"manager\" designation. One trademark of Parker's managing would be his fanning himself during matches. In October 1996, Harlem Heat fired Parker after he cost them the WCW World Tag Team Championships. He quickly started to manage The Amazing French Canadians (Jacques Rougeau and Carl Ouellet), trading in his gray suit for a French Foreign Legion uniform. Harlem Heat and The Amazing French Canadians began feuding.\n\nFuller was released from WCW in 1997 and in March 1998, he resurfaced in the WWF as Tennessee Lee, a character similar to his Col.

The island was formerly inhabited, but the inhabitants were evacuated due to volcanic eruptions in 1981.\n\nPagan is located about north of Saipan, the main island of the Northern Mariana Islands. With an area of , it is the fourth largest island of the Northern Marianas. \nThe island is a double island consisting of two stratovolcanoes joined by a narrow strip of land with a width of only . The southern volcano , is high with a caldera approximately in diameter, consisting of four craters joined together. Although several fumaroles were active in 1992, the southern volcano last erupted in 1864. The northern volcano, also known as Mount Pagan, , has a height of . The volcano is in the center of a caldera with a diameter of approximately , and eruptions have been documented in the 1820s, 1872–1873, 1925 and 1981–85.\n\nPagan has two large lakes. Laguna Sanhalom (also Inner Lake) had an area of and depth of in the 1970s. Laguna Sanhiyon (also Laguna Lake) on the west coast of the northern island had an area of and depth of . Both lakes contain brackish water.\n\nArchaeological finds indicate that Pagan was settled from several centuries BC. The first European contact was in 1669, when the island was sighted by the Spanish missionary Diego Luis de San Vitores who named it \"San Ignacio\" (Saint Ignatius in Spanish). It is likely that it was previously visited in 1522 by the Spanish sailor Gonzalo de Vigo, deserter from the Magellan expedition in 1521, and the first European castaway in the history of the Pacific. The native Chamorro population was forcibly deported to Saipan in 1695, and then three years later to Guam. The Chamorros began to return to Pagan in the early 19th century, but found that the island had been colonized by freed Kanakas from the Caroline islands. In the 1870s, first coconut plantations were established.\n\nAfter the sale of the Northern Mariana islands by Spain to the German Empire in 1899, the island was administered as part of the colony of German New Guinea and leased to a private company, the Pagan Society, which traded mainly copra. The company was a partnership between a German and Japanese man. The island was devastated by typhoons in July and September 1905, September 1907 and in December 1913 which destroyed the coconut plantations and bankrupted the Pagan Society. In 1914, during World War I, the island was captured by the Empire of Japan, which was awarded control by the League of Nations as part of the South Seas Mandate. The island was settled by ethnic Japanese and Okinawans, who restored the coconut plantations and raised cotton and sweet potatoes for export. In addition, the Japanese developed commercial fishing for bonito and tuna. An airfield was constructed in 1935, and the Imperial Japanese Navy established a garrison in 1937. In 1942 the Japanese civilian population was 413 persons, with another 229 Chamorro residents. In June 1944 a garrison force of 2,150 men of the Imperial Japanese Army arrived, only to be cut off and isolated by the ongoing Allied offensive. Receiving supplies only occasionally by submarine, the garrison soon faced starvation, and several hundred died of malnutrition before the surrender of Japan. \nAfter World War II and under United States occupation, Pagan became part of the UN Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands until being granted U.S. Commonwealth status. After the war the United States Navy maintained a small establishment on Pagan and during the 1950s built public institutions, including a church, a copra warehouse, an infirmary and a school house. However the civilian population was under 100 people by the end of the 1970s, many of whom were seasonally present from Saipan. \nOn May 15, 1981, Mount Pagan erupted, with lava flows covering a large part of the island's arable land and part of the airfield runway; the island's inhabitants were evacuated to Saipan. The eruption continued until 1985, with further small outbreaks in 1987, 1988, 1992, 1993, 1996, 2006, 2009, 2010 and 2012. Repeated petitions by the islanders to return have been rejected by US authorities due to the continuing threat posed by the volcano. Efforts are underway by the Northern Islands Mayor's Office and concerned citizens to assist the approximately 300 displaced residents of the Northern Islands who wish to return and resettle in Anatahan, Alamagan, Pagan and Agrigan.\n\nPagan Island was included during Operation Christmas Drop 2006. United States Air Force C-130 aircrew observed cattle and a small cluster of buildings, including a grass airstrip, located on the island.\nPlans by a Japanese investor group to use Pagan as a dumping ground for debris and rubble from the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan were provisionally shelved after protests in June 2012.\n\nPolitically, Pagan remains part of the Northern Islands Municipality.\n\nIn 2013 the US Naval Command filed a proposal to obtain the island for a new group of live-fire and maneuver Ranges and Training Areas (RTAs).\n\nThe proposal spawned an online community called Our Islands are Sacred, a petition on Change.org, and rallies against it held by the Sierra Club, Save Pagan Island, Roots Action and Care2Make a Difference.\n\nOn April 3, 2015 (HST) the Department of Defense (DoD) released a long-awaited draft of the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). According to Michael G. Hadfield, a professor of biology at the University of Hawaii-Manoa who led an insect survey team to Pagan in 2010, “Speaking as a biologist, it’s got some really unique things about it. ... It’s not a wasteland, which I think some people envision because it’s got an active volcano. There’s a lot there that’s worth preserving — a couple of endangered bird species and snail species — which I specialize in and is about to hit the U.S. endangered species list.”\n\nJerome Aldan (died in February 2017), the mayor for CNMI's Northern Islands, which includes Pagan, told a New Zealand radio program that the U.S. military's description of the island as “uninhabited” was false. According to an article by James Cave for the Huffington Post, an article which used Hadfield as its source:\n\n\"More than 50 families in Saipan consider Pagan their home island and have plans and desires to return to homesteads,\" The island is occupied by two people, who live in shacks and have one flushing toilet and plumbing, electricity and small ranch.\n\nAccording to an April 17, 2015, article by Wyatt Olson for Stars and Stripes military news network, \"the [legislature of the Northern Mariana Islands] is considering a joint resolution calling on the governor to oppose the military expansion on the 10-mile-long island. ... In wording that hints at the hornet’s nest the U.S. may have stirred with the proposal, the joint resolution asserts that “throughout the CNMI’s history, foreign powers and outside influences have made major decisions and have dictated the course of development” for the region and that the U.S. “once again stands poised to make some very important decisions with respect to the military utilization of the Northern Islands.” \"\n\nOn May 15, 2015, a map of the proposed site was made available online.\n\nAs of 1980 the population of Pagan often changed as secondary students moved back and forth between their residences on Pagan and their schools on Saipan. In October 1977 Pagan had seven families with a total of 37 people. The resident commissioner's office stated that 51 people lived on Pagan in December 1977. As of 1980 Pagan had nine families with total of 85 people, including some people residing in Saipan.\n\nPreviously Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands Public School System operated an elementary school (until grade 6) on Pagan prior to the 1981 eruptions. In 1977 the school had 13 students. Students from Pagan attending secondary school did so on Saipan.\n\n\n"}

She wants to make a difference but must first learn what life is really like for New York City's homeless. She meets an elderly woman named Florabelle (Ball), who makes it known she does not want company or help. Equipped with the precious cart that contains all of her belongings, Flora takes care of herself on the streets of Manhattan. Carrie wins Flora's trust after saving her cart. Flora takes her for a runaway, and Carrie plays along as Flora finds her the best food and warmest places the street have to offer. Flora even divulges painful memories about her past life. They go to Grand Central Terminal for the night, but are separated after the police throw everyone out. Flora looks for Carrie at a shelter and is stunned to find her working there. She feels she has been betrayed. Against her will, Flora is shuttled off to a woman's shelter in Brooklyn, where she is treated poorly, and then must find her way back to Manhattan. Finding compassion difficult to come by even in those within her profession, Carrie decides she can make a difference one person at a time. Finally realizing she cannot go on living the way she does, Flora accepts Carrie's helping hand.

The success of the film led Ball to make one last attempt to return to her comedy roots with \"Life with Lucy\" the next year. John J.

He was extremely unhappy at being sent away from the social scene at Guildford, and he managed the station poorly, prompting a contemporary John Wollaston to write\nIn 1858, his younger brother took over the station, and Hamersley was transferred to \"Wilberforce\", another of his father's stations, located in York, Western Australia.\n\nIn 1857, the governor agreed to allow settlers to elect men whom he would then nominate to the Western Australian Legislative Council. Edwards stood for election, but was defeated by his father's former partner and later enemy Samuel Pole Phillips.\n\nWestern Australia having obtained representative government in 1870, he stood for election in 1874, and on 29 September of that year, he was elected to the Legislative Council seat of Toodyay. Two months later, his father died, and he was bequeathed two of his father's stations, \"Wilberforce\" and \"Woodside\". He resigned his seat in the Legislative Council on 6 October 1875.\n\nOn 11 February 1880, he was elected to the Legislative Council seat of York. He did not stand for election in 1884 and so ceased to be a member on 27 October of that year. After Western Australia gained responsible government in 1890, he was nominated to the Legislative Council on 24 December of that year, serving until the Council became fully elective in June 1894. He then contested the Legislative Council's East Province, but was unsuccessful.\n\nIn February 1867, he married Jane Dempster. They had seven sons and three daughters. He was widowed in April 1913, and died in York, Western Australia on 14 January 1921.\n\n\n"}

He was late model champion at Berlin Raceway in Marne, Michigan before joining the American Speed Association (ASA) in 1990. During Benson's rookie season in the ASA he captured one pole position, led 174 laps and scored eight top 10 finishes to blitz the competition for the ASA's Pat Schauer Rookie of the Year award. In 1991 Benson compiled 13 top 10s including four second-place finishes. Benson ranked fourth in the ASA AC-Delco Challenge Series in 1991. Benson later went on to win the 1993 ASA championship. During his time in the ASA series he drove the No. 21 Valvoline Chevrolet for Throop Motorsports.\n\nIn 1993, Benson made his Busch Series debut at Michigan International Speedway, driving the No. 41 Delco Remy Chevrolet for Ernie Irvan. He started 20th, but finished 40th after an early crash when he had flipped in the race. He ran three more races that season in the No. 74 Staff America Chevy for BACE Motorsports, qualifying third at Hickory Motor Speedway. His best finish was an eighteenth at Atlanta Motor Speedway.\n\nBenson was hired to drive full-time for BACE in 1994. He won his first career race at the SplitFire 200 and finished sixth in points, winning Rookie of the Year honors. The following season, Benson won early in the season at Atlanta and Hickory and had nineteen top-tens, winning the championship. He also began running in the Truck Series in the No. 18 Performance Friction Chevrolet Silverado for Kurt Roehrig. In his first season, his best finish was a second at Indianapolis Raceway Park. The following season, he won the pole at North Wilkesboro Speedway.\n\nIn 1996, he moved up to the Winston Cup Series, a series Benson's father John Benson Sr. competed in for one race back in 1973.\nHe joined the No. 30 Pennzoil-sponsored team owned by Bahari Racing. He failed to qualify for one race at the Food City 500, but won the 1996 NASCAR Winston Cup Rookie of the Year title. He won one pole at Atlanta Motor Speedway. In August, he dominated the Brickyard 400 before a problem on the last pit stop ended his chances for victory. He ended the season with seven Top 10's and was 21st in points. He was invited to the 1996 International Race of Champions as the reigning Busch Series champion, and finished third in the final points, finishing in the Top 10 in all four races.\nIn 1997, Benson had eight Top 10's, but did not finish in the Top 5 once. He won his second career pole at Michigan and finished outside of the Top 10 by one point to Ken Schrader. At the end of the season, he announced he would be joining Roush Racing to run the brand-new No. 26 General Mills/Cheerios-sponsored Ford Taurus.\n\nHe missed the season opening Daytona 500, then finished 30th at the following race. He then had a streak of no finishes worse than ninth over the next five races and rose as high as tenth in points, before he finished 38th and 41st in the next two races. For the rest of the season, his best finish was ninth and he qualified no higher than second. He finished 20th in points. Benson had numerous crew chiefs in 1999. He had two Top 10 finishes and finished 28th in the final standings. After a long negotiation, he was able to buy out his contract and announced he would leave Roush.\n\nAt the start of the 2000 Winston Cup season, Benson found himself without a sponsor when he signed on to join Tyler Jet Motorsports to run the No. 10 car. The team showed up at Daytona Speedweeks with a white unsponsored Pontiac Grand Prix. Lycos.com signed on to be the team's sponsor for the year on the morning of the Daytona 500. During the race, Benson and crew chief James Ince gambled on a late pitstop when they took only two right side tires and fuel, to come out with the lead with 43 laps to go. He held off the field until a multi-car crash brought out the caution in the final 10 laps. On the restart with 4 laps to go, Benson was leading with Dale Jarrett and Jeff Burton right behind. Jarrett bumped Benson, sending him up the track going into turn one, then passed him for the win while Benson slid back in 12th. Benson finished sixth in the third race at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway, and was eleventh in points. At the next race at Atlanta, Benson did not qualify in first-round qualifying, and he missed the race after the second round was canceled. Benson finished second three weeks later.\n\nAt the Pepsi 400 in July, the Tyler Jet Motorsports car showed up at Daytona again with a white car. During the weekend before the race, the team removed the Lycos.com decals. Reports said that it was because Lycos never paid. Tyler Jet went sponsorless for the next 4 races before Aaron's came aboard right before the team shut down. During the sponsorless run the team was sold to MB2 Motorsports. In August, Valvoline announced they would not only sponsor the team but become part owner. Benson finished in thirteenth place in the final points.\n\nBenson began his 2001 season with an engine failure that relegated him to 28th place, a few laps after the race's \"Big One\" involving 19 cars took place. He had Top 10 finishes in each of the next four races, including a fourth-place run in the UAW-Daimler Chrysler 400, which allowed him to be a career high second in the points (tied with Sterling Marlin) following the spring Darlington Race. He finished third at Texas and Indianapolis. He did not win a points race, although he did win the non-points Winston Open at Charlotte from the pole after leader Ryan Newman in the No. 02 Alltel-sponsored Ford suffered a blown engine late in the race. Benson finished eleventh in the final points standings in 2001.\n\nBenson started 2002 with a 10th-place finish in the Daytona 500 despite a crash early in the race. In May, Benson agreed to race in the Richmond Busch Series race for Marsh Racing in the No. 31 Whelen Engineering-sponsored Chevrolet. Benson was involved in a wreck in the early stages of the races and ended up with broken ribs and he missed three Cup races. At the Pepsi 400 in Daytona, he started sixth, and on the eighth lap he got together with Michael Waltrip. Benson ended up rebreaking his ribs which put him out of action for two more races. At Loudon, Benson started second, led 53 of 207 laps, and finished fourth. Benson tied a career-best second-place finish at the Martinsville Speedway, which he got twice in 2000. On November 3, he started 26th in the 43 car field at the Pop Secret Microwave Popcorn 400 at Rockingham. With 50 laps to go, he was running in fifth, and with 28 laps left he passed Mark Martin (who coincidentally had Valvoline as his sponsor for many years) for the lead. In the last 10 laps, other drivers were running out of gas, including his teammate Ken Schrader. However, Benson held off Martin by 0.26 seconds to win the race.\n\nBenson was sixth in points after the first 4 races of 2003. Benson had Top 5 finishes at Dover and Homestead, and finished 24th in the points. Valvoline decided to release Benson in favor of rookie driver Scott Riggs after the season was over.\n\n2004 started off with Benson signing on with Phoenix Racing to run the full 2004 Busch Series schedule. Benson won his first and only career Busch pole at Rockingham, but a rules violation relegated him to last place when the green flag dropped for the race. He was poised to win at Bristol in the spring until Benson was caught up in a late race incident between Kevin Harvick and David Stremme. Benson was also involved in a crash between the top 4 drivers at Nashville while racing for the win, and parted ways with Phoenix before the Richmond race. He also drove four races in Phoenix's No. 09 Cup ride, his best finish 27th at the Daytona 500.\n\nOver the next few months Benson ran one Busch race for Matt Kenseth and Robbie and John Reiser. In August he was offered a ride in the Bill Davis Racing No. 23 truck in the Craftsman Truck Series, which was previously driven by Shelby Howard before he was released from the team. Benson had eight Top 10 finishes in thirteen races, finishing 25th in the 2004 series' points standings. Benson had ten Top 10 finishes in 25 races, and was 10th in the 2005 points standings. He ran four Busch races, one for FitzBradshaw Racing, and another for Smith Bros. Racing, finishing 18th at Nashville. He also had three Cup starts, two of them in the No. 00 Sara Lee Chevy for Michael Waltrip, and another at Atlanta in the No. 23 Dodge Intrepid for Bill Davis, finishing 28th.\n\nHe won his first Craftsman Truck Series race at the 2006 Con-way Freight 200 at the Michigan International Speedway. With the win, Benson became the seventeenth driver to win a race in all three of NASCAR's major series. He has also won a pole in each of the three series. He followed with a back-to-back win at the Toyota Tundra Milwaukee 200 at Milwaukee Mile. His third win of the season was at the Toyota Tundra 200 at Nashville Speedway. His fourth win of the season was at the Sylvania 200 at New Hampshire International Speedway. Benson won his fifth race of the year at the Casino Arizona 150 at Phoenix International Raceway. Benson finished the 2006 season in second place, 127 behind Todd Bodine. He was named the series' Most Popular Driver for 2006.\n\nFor the 2007 season, Benson continued to drive in the No. 23 truck for Bill Davis Racing. He finished the season in third place with four wins: the Toyota Tundra Milwaukee 200 at Milwaukee Mile, the O'Reilly 200 presented by Valvoline Maxlife at Bristol, the Missouri/Illinois Dodge Dealers Ram Tough 200 at Gateway International Raceway, and the Ford 200 at Homestead-Miami Speedway. Benson was named the series' Most Popular Driver for the second year in row, becoming the first driver to repeat as award recipient. Benson also returned to NEXTEL Cup racing by driving the Wyler Racing No. 46 Toyota Camry in the 2007 Crown Royal Presents The Jim Stewart 400. He also returned to the Busch racing by driving the Phoenix Racing No. 1 Chevrolet Monte Carlo SS in the 2007 AT&T 250. Bill Davis also had Benson pull \"double duty\", driving the No. 23 truck and the No. 36 Toyota Camry in the Cup Series on the same weekend; he did so at the final two races of the year (Phoenix and Homestead-Miami).\n\nBenson drove the No. 23 truck in the 2008 Craftsman Truck Series, winning the series championship in the last race of the season. With the title, he became the second driver to win both the Busch Grand National Series and Craftsman Truck Series championships (Greg Biffle accomplished this in 2002). In addition, to date he joined a list of only 6 drivers to ever win at least one championship in more than one of the three main title series (Bobby Labonte, Brad Keselowski, Kevin Harvick, and Kyle Busch are the others, and they have won championships in the second tier and Cup Series.) His first win of the season came at the Camping World RV Sales 200 at the Milwaukee Mile, the third consecutive race that Benson has won as Milwaukee Mile. His second, third, and fourth wins came at the Built Ford Tough 225 at Kentucky Speedway, the Power Stroke Diesel 200 at O'Reilly Raceway Park, and the Toyota Tundra 200 at Nashville Superspeedway. With this series of wins, he became the fifth driver in the Craftsman Truck Series to win three races in a row. His fifth win of the year came at the Kroger 200 at Martinsville Speedway. Benson was named the series' Most Popular Driver for the third year in row.\n\nAlso in 2008, after a deal for Jacques Villeneuve to drive the Bill Davis Racing No. 27 Toyota Camry fell through, it was announced that Benson and Mike Skinner would share driving duties for the No. 27. Benson failed to qualify in his first appearance in 2008 at the Kobalt Tools 500, which is also Benson's last attempt to run a Sprint Cup series race to date.\n\nOn November 6, 2008, Benson announced that he would not be returning to Bill Davis Racing after the 2008 season. On December 8, 2008, Benson announced that he would be joining the Red Horse Racing team to drive the No. 1 Toyota Tundra in the 2009 season. Benson's crew chief from the 2008 season, Trip Bruce, also joined the No. 1 team. On June 8, 2009, it was announced that Red Horse Racing was having to suspend the No. 1 due to a lack of sponsorship after competing in eight races with four top 10 finishes.\n\nOn June 13, 2009 Benson was burned in a fiery crash in an ISMA Supermodifieds race at Berlin Raceway. He was transported to Spectrum Health Butterworth Hospital with where he was hospitalized suffering from a broken collarbone, separated shoulder, three broken ribs, bruised lungs, a fractured wrist and third-degree burns on one elbow. After undergoing two surgeries for the burns and a separated shoulder, Benson fully recovered.\n\nFor the 2010 season, Kyle Busch Motorsports intended to field a truck for Benson, but did not to secure the necessary sponsorship. Benson served as a mentor to Kyle Busch Motorsports' drivers Brian Ickler and Tayler Malsam. Benson drove for Team Gill Racing in the season opener at Daytona finishing 8th. He then drove for Billy Ballew Motorsports at Martinsville, Kansas, and Dover finishing in the top 10 in all 3 races including a pair of 5th-place finishes at Martinsville and Kansas. Benson's only race for Kyle Busch Motorsports came at Texas where he finished 10th. This was his final race in NASCAR.\nTurn One Racing announced in 2011 that they intended to field a truck for Benson in 2012, but the deal fell through due to sponsorship issues.\n\nBenson currently works for the National Motorsports Appeals Panel. Benson is retired from NASCAR but still races a supermodified for car owner Brad Lichty on the ISMA tour\n"}

Among the acts he discovered were the Crows, Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers, and Little Anthony and the Imperials.\n\nHe established (or helped establish) a number of record labels, including Tico, Rama, Gee, Roulette, End, Gone, and Red Bird. It was said of him that he \"discovered more talent, both in front of the microphone and behind the scenes, than most producers get to record in a lifetime.. Moreover, in the decades since, much of the music that Goldner recorded and released has retained an astonishing appeal to generations of listeners\".\n\nGoldner was born to a Jewish family in 1918 to a mother Rose originally from Poland and father Adolph from Austria. He and his two sisters grew up in the Turtle Bay neighborhood of the east side of New York City, and he attended Peter Stuyvesant High School. While still in school he worked weekends as a waiter at the Shelton Hotel, where his father also worked while acquiring furnished brownstones. Goldner later worked in the garment business, before opening a chain of dance halls in New York and New Jersey.\n\nGoldner's dance clubs thrived in the late 1940s during the craze for Latin music, a style that Goldner loved. In 1948, he established his first record label, Tico Records, named after the song \"Tico-Tico\". The company recorded and distributed music by such artists as Tito Puente, Joe Loco and Machito, becoming the most important Latin music label and helping to integrate the music into mainstream pop, especially through mambo music.\n\nFinding that increasing numbers of African-American patrons were visiting his clubs, Goldner decided in 1953 to start a new label, Rama, to record jazz, vocal group and R&B music. One of his earliest records on the label was \"Gee\" by The Crows. The record soon rose to the top of the R&B chart, but - to the surprise of Goldner and others - was also bought by white teenagers, who were increasingly listening to hitherto \"black\" radio stations, and rose to #14 on the pop chart as well. This crossover success, as \"the first R&B single to get a significant part of its sales and chart success from purchases by white teenagers\", has led to some describing it as \"the first rock and roll record\".\n\nBecause radio stations would play only a few records from each label, Goldner also set up Gee Records, and found some success immediately with the Cleftones. He also recruited Richard Barrett, lead singer of another doo-wop group, the Valentines, as his production assistant. They mostly worked at the Bell recording studios in Manhattan. Although Goldner could not read music, he had an ear for rock and roll, and acted as the producer of most recordings on his labels. Jerry Leiber said that he had the taste of a fourteen-year-old girl, and that, as far as sales and promotion went, Goldner was a master. In promoting his records, he sometimes gave gratuities or paid DJs at radio stations, to give consideration to his companies' records. This practice, which came to be known as payola, was widespread.\n\nAccording to one source:\"In the studio, Goldner and his right-hand man Richard Barrett... had multi-faceted jobs: find the right key and \"groove\" for a song; collaborate with the musicians to create a \"head\" arrangement; encourage and control the young, often inexperienced singers during their maiden visits to the recording studio; oversee the vocal balance by placing the singers at the proper distance from the microphone; keep an eagle eye on the clock (sessions were traditionally three hours in length, after which overtime kicked in); and, most importantly, recognize the magical \"best take\" that would ultimately click with the record-buying teenagers.\"\n\nGoldner signed and recorded Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers, whose song \"Why Do Fools Fall in Love\" also became a crossover hit in early 1956, this time also becoming an international success. By then, Goldner - who was an inveterate gambler and frequently needed to pay off his debts - had sold half of his share of the Tico, Rama and Gee labels to Joe Kolsky, an associate of club owner and juke box distributor Morris Levy, who reportedly had links to the Mafia. Goldner also started the Luniverse label with Bill Buchanan and Dickie Goodman, to release novelty records. In 1956 its first release, \"The Flying Saucer\", pioneered the idea of \"break-in\" or \"mashup\" records, featuring segments of popular songs intertwined with spoken \"news\" commentary, and sold over a million copies.\n\nIn January 1957, Goldner, Kolsky and Levy formed Roulette Records, but shortly afterwards Goldner sold his interest in the company, as well as his remaining interests in Tico, Rama, and Gee, to Levy. In their place, he started two more new labels, End and Gone, both distributed by Morris Levy's Roulette organization. Both labels provided hits for doo-wop groups. The End label saw success with \"He's Gone\" and \"Maybe\" by the Chantels; \"Tears on My Pillow\" by Little Anthony and the Imperials; and, in 1959, \"I Only Have Eyes For You\" by the Flamingos. The first release on Gone, \"Don't Ask Me To Be Lonely\" by the Dubs, was also a hit, and the label had further hits with Ral Donner. Goldner also recorded the Isley Brothers, the Four Seasons and Johnny Rivers on Gone.\n\nIn 1958, Goldner hired a young Artie Ripp, (who went on establish his own record labels and was the first to sign and produce Billy Joel as a solo act), as his \"gofer\". Goldner taught Ripp his practices regarding how to create and distribute music, including how to structure a record contract, how to work a studio, and how to get a record on the radio.\n\nBy the early 1960s, Goldner had sold his End and Gone labels to Levy, and worked for a time as a record producer at Roulette.\n\nGoldner's last successful label, Red Bird Records (which had a subsidiary, Blue Cat Records) was actually co-founded by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller. Goldner became a partner in the company, promoting Red Bird releases, while Leiber and Stoller worked on production. The company was successful, producing hits for the Dixie Cups, the Shangri-Las, and the Ad-Libs. However, the label lasted just two years, as Leiber and Stoller wanted out of the record business, either due to creative differences, or once Goldner's gambling debts again led to Morris Levy's involvement. After an abortive attempt to merge it with Atlantic Records, Leiber and Stoller sold their interest in Red Bird Records to Goldner in 1966 for $1, by which time Goldner's uncontrolled gambling habit had placed the label under the control of the Mafia.\n\nGoldner's final venture was to form the short-lived Firebird label in early 1970.\n\nGoldner died of a heart attack on April 15, 1970, at age 52.\n\nA musical based on the life of Goldner and featuring music from his record labels premiered in Hollywood in 2012 titled \"The Boy From New York City.\"\n"}
{"id": "1875242", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1875242", "title": "Reconstruction filter", "text": "Reconstruction filter\n\nIn a mixed-signal system (analog and digital), a reconstruction filter, sometimes called an anti-imaging filter, is used to construct a smooth analog signal from a digital input, as in the case of a digital to analog converter (DAC) or other sampled data output device.\n\nThe sampling theorem describes why the input of an ADC requires a low-pass analog electronic filter, called the anti-aliasing filter: the sampled \"input\" signal must be bandlimited to prevent aliasing (here meaning waves of higher frequency being \"recorded\" as a lower frequency).\n\nFor the same reason, the output of a DAC requires a low-pass analog filter, called a reconstruction filter - because the \"output\" signal must be bandlimited, to prevent imaging (meaning Fourier coefficients being reconstructed as spurious high-frequency 'mirrors'). This is an implementation of the Whittaker–Shannon interpolation formula.\n\nIdeally, both filters should be brickwall filters, constant phase delay in the pass-band with constant flat frequency response, and zero response from the Nyquist frequency. This can be achieved by a filter with a 'sinc' impulse response.\n\nWhile in theory a DAC outputs a series of discrete Dirac impulses, in practice, a real DAC outputs pulses with finite bandwidth and width. Both idealized Dirac pulses, zero-order held steps and other output pulses, if unfiltered, would contain spurious high-frequency replicas, \"\"or images\"\" of the original bandlimited signal. Thus, the reconstruction filter smooths the waveform to remove image frequencies (copies) above the Nyquist limit. In doing so, it reconstructs the continuous time signal (whether originally sampled, or modelled by digital logic) corresponding to the digital time sequence.\n\nPractical filters have non-flat frequency or phase response in the pass band and incomplete suppression of the signal elsewhere. The ideal sinc waveform has an infinite response to a signal, in both the positive and negative time directions, which is impossible to perform in real time – as it would require infinite delay. Consequently, real reconstruction filters typically either allow some energy above the Nyquist rate, attenuate some in-band frequencies, or both. For this reason, oversampling may be used to ensure that frequencies of interest are accurately reproduced without excess energy being emitted out of band. \n\nIn systems that have both, the anti-aliasing filter and a reconstruction filter may be of identical design. For example, both the input and the output for audio equipment may be sampled at 44.1 kHz. In this case, both audio filters block as much as possible above 22 kHz and pass as much as possible below 20 kHz.\n\nAlternatively, a system may have no reconstruction filter and simply tolerate some energy being wasted reproducing higher frequency images of the primary signal spectrum.\n\nIn image processing, digital reconstruction filters are used both to recreate images from samples as in medical imaging and for resampling.\nA number of comparisons have been made, by various criteria; one observation is that reconstruction can be improved if the \"derivative\" of the signal is also known, in addition to the amplitude, and conversely that also performing derivative reconstruction can improve signal reconstruction methods.\n\nResampling may be referred to as decimation or interpolation, accordingly as the sampling rate decreases or increases – as in sampling and reconstruction generally, the same criteria generally apply in both cases, and thus the same filter can be used.\n\nFor resampling, in principle the analog image is reconstructed, then sampled, and this is necessary for general changes in resolution. For integer ratios of sampling rate, one may simplify by sampling the impulse response of the continuous reconstruction filter to produce a discrete resampling filter, then using the discrete resampling filter to directly resample the image. For decimation by an integer amount, only a single sampled filter is necessary; for interpolation by an integer amount, different samplings are needed for different phases – for instance, if one is upsampling by a factor of 4, then one sampled filter is used for the half-way point, while a different sampled filter is used for the point 1/4 of the way from one point to another.\n\nA subtlety in image processing is that (linear) signal processing assumes linear luminance – that doubling a pixel value doubles the luminance of the output. However, images are frequently gamma encoded, notably in the sRGB color space, so luminance is not linear.\nThus to apply a linear filter, one must first gamma decode the values – and if resampling, one must gamma decode, resample, then gamma encode.\n\nThe most common day-to-day filters are:\n\nThese are in increasing order of stopband suppression (anti-aliasing), and decreasing speed\n\nFor reconstruction purposes, a variety of kernels are used, many of which can be interpreted as approximating the sinc function, either by windowing or by giving a spline approximation, either by cubics or higher order splines. In the case of windowed sinc filters, the frequency response of the reconstruction filter can be understood in terms of the frequency response of the window, as the frequency response of a windowed filter is the convolution of the original response (for sinc, a brick-wall) with the frequency response of the window. Among these, the Lanczos window and Kaiser window are frequently praised.\n\nAnother class of reconstruction filters include the Gaussian for various widths, or cardinal B-splines of higher order – the box filter and tent filter being the 0th and 1st order cardinal B-splines. These filters fail to be interpolating filters, since their impulse response do not vanish at all non-zero original sample points – for 1:1 resampling, they are not the identity, but rather blur. On the other hand, being nonnegative, they do not introduce any overshoot or ringing artifacts, and by being wider in the time domain they can be narrower in the frequency domain (by the Fourier uncertainty principle), though at the cost of blurring, which is reflected in passband roll-off (\"scalloping\").\n\nIn photography, a great variety of interpolation filters exist, some proprietary, for which opinions are mixed. Evaluation is often subjective, with reactions being varied, and some arguing that at realistic resampling ratios, there is little difference between them, as compared with bicubic, though for higher resampling ratios behavior is more varied.\n\nReconstruction filters are also used when \"reconstructing\" a waveform or an image from a collection of wavelet coefficients.\nIn medical imaging, a common technique is to use a number of 2D X-ray photos or MRI scans to \"reconstruct\" a 3D image.\n\n\n"}

This family is in the order Ranunculales. The family contains about 700 known species, of which the majority are in \"Berberis\". The species include trees, shrubs and perennial herbaceous plants.\n\n\nThe APG IV system of 2016 recognises the family and places it in the order Ranunculales in the clade eudicots.\n\nIn some older treatments of the family, Berberidaceae only included four genera (\"Berberis, Epimedium, Mahonia, Vancouveria\"), with the other genera treated in separate families, Leonticaceae (\"Bongardia, Caulophyllum, Gymnospermium, Leontice\"), Nandinaceae (\"Nandina\"), and Podophyllaceae (\"Achlys, Diphylleia, Dysosma, Jeffersonia, Podophyllum, Ranzania, Sinopodophyllum\").\n\n\"Mahonia\" is very closely related to \"Berberis\", and included in it by many botanists. However, recent DNA-based phylogenetic research has reinstated \"Mahonia\", though with a handful of species transferred into the newly-described genera \"Alloberberis\" (formerly \"Mahonia\" section \"Horridae\") and \"Moranothamnus\" (formerly \"Mahonia claireae\"). Species of \"Mahonia\" and \"Berberis\" can be hybridised, with the hybrids being classified in the genus \"× Mahoberberis\".\n\n\"Diphyllaea\" is closely related to or perhaps embedded within \"Podophyllum.\" Instead of the current trend to subdivide \"Podophyllum\" into three genera (\"Podophyllum\", plus \"Dysosma\" and \"Sinopodophyllum\"), inclusion of \"Diphyllaea\" in a larger \"Podophyllum\" is equally warranted.\n\n"}

It is the first game in Tecmo's \"Monster Rancher\" series, featuring the raising, fighting, and breeding of monsters.\n\nA remaster of the game was released for the Nintendo Switch in January 2020.\n\nAlthough it is possible to acquire a monster in-game, the series is known for the ability to acquire new monsters using Compact Discs (CDs). Players can use any readable CD, and the game creates a monster using the CD's metadata. Certain CDs would result in unique monsters: for example, some Christmas music albums will give the player a monster of type \"Santa\". Once the player has two or more monsters in reserve, they can be combined, creating a new monster with traits of both 'parents'. There are twelve basic types of monsters that can be combined, as well as eight special types players can receive as rewards by completing tasks or inserting a CD into the PlayStation. The common types are Dinos, Golems, Suezos, Hares, Tigers, Galis, Monols, Worms, Nagas, Jells, Pixies, and Plants. The rare types are Dragons, Magics, Apes, Ghosts, Hengers, Doodles, Nyas, and Disks. Monsters can be combined to create a new monster with a main type and a sub-type which are determined randomly.\n\nOnce the player has a monster, it can then be raised to fight other monsters. There are six stats that determine how the monster does in battle: Power fuels physical attacks, Intelligence fuels and defends against energy attacks, Life determines monster's hit points, Skill affects accuracy, Speed helps evade opponents' attacks, and Defense reduces damage received from physical attacks. Monsters train either by doing chores nearby, or can be sent to be trained by experts, where they have the chance to gain new attack techniques. It is possible to increase some of the monster's stats with food or vitamins, but vitamins comes at a price of decreasing one stat as well as shorting the life span dramatically.\n\nCurrency can be used to purchase items in the game, earned by winning monster fighting tournaments. The game can end if the player runs out of currency to manage the monster.\nThe primary way to advance through the game is through monster fighting tournaments. While in battle, each monster has attacks available to it, some moves are only available at close range, others from a distance. Players cannot control the monster directly in a fight, but can call for their monster to stay away or close in, and attack with whichever move is available at the current range.\n\nIn \"Monster Rancher 2\" and \"Monster Rancher Advance 2\", Holly, the assistant from this game, cameos as a rancher from the group, AGIMA, for whom the player trains monsters.\n\nThe game received \"favorable\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. The game was a hit in Japan, with domestic sales above 500,000 units by early December 1997. At the time, GameSpot reported that it was \"enjoying brisk sales\" in the United States as well.\n\n\"Next Generation\" reviewed the PlayStation version of the game, rating it five stars out of five, and stated that \"The overall result is an addictive yet time-consuming title that deserves to attract a whole new and grateful audience to the narrow niche of life sim gaming.\"\n\n"}

Saint Solange was the patron of the traditional Province of Berry, of which Cher is a part.\n\nSolange was born to a poor but devout family in the town of Villemont, near Bourges, and consecrated her virginity at the age of seven; according to some, her mere presence cured the sick and exorcised devils. The son of the count of Poitiers was highly taken with the beauty and popularity of Solange and approached her when she was tending to her sheep, but she rejected his suit. He argued with her to no avail, and so he decided to abduct her.\n\nAt night, he came and took Solange by force, but she struggled so violently that she fell from his horse while he was crossing a stream. Her abductor grew enraged and beheaded her with his sword. According to the fully-developed legend, Solange's severed head invoked three times the Holy Name of Jesus, and like Saint Denis and other saints in Gaulish territories, Solange picked up her head in her own hands and walked with it as far as the church of Saint-Martin in the village of Saint-Martin-du-Crot (which now bears the name of Sainte-Solange, the only commune in France to bear this name), only dropping truly dead there.\n\nImmediately, a cult surrounding her grew up. Many miraculous cures were attributed to her intercession. In 1281, an altar was erected in her honor at that church, and it preserved her severed head as a relic and began to call itself the church of St. Solange, while a nearby field where she had prayed began to be referred to as the \"Field of St. Solange\". It was a habit of the locals, in times of great stress, to form a procession through Bourges with the reliquary head before them and to invoke her against drought.\n\nSolange's feast day in the Roman Catholic Church is May 10.\n"}
{"id": "1875258", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1875258", "title": "Harlem Heat", "text": "Harlem Heat\n\nHarlem Heat was a professional wrestling tag team composed of two brothers, Booker and Lash Huffman (better known as Booker T and Stevie Ray). The team achieved their greatest success in World Championship Wrestling (WCW), where they won the WCW World Tag Team Championship a record ten times. Kevin Powers of WWE remarked: \"When debating the greatest tag team in WCW history, Harlem Heat and The Steiner Brothers are more or less interchangeable.\"\n\nHarlem Heat was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame on April 6, 2019 as part of the 2019 class.\n\nBooker T and Stevie Ray started to team together as The Huffman Brothers in Ivan Putski's Western Wrestling Alliance after a brief feud with each other. Soon after, the WWA ceased operating and the brothers started touring the Texas Independent circuit until they caught the eye of Skandor Akbar who was involved with the Global Wrestling Federation out of Dallas in 1992. The brothers were repackaged as The Ebony Experience and quickly rose through the ranks of the GWF tag team division under the guidance of Gary Hart, defeating Skandor Akbar's \"Goodfellows\" (\"Gorgeous\" Gary Young and Steve Dane) for the GWF Tag Team Championship on July 31, 1992. Their first run with the GWF tag title lasted only a week before they were defeated by The Blackbirds (”Iceman” King Parsons and Action Jackson). Booker and Stevie Ray made a comeback and defeated the cheating birds in September.\n\nThe second run with the title lasted a bit longer than a week but was ultimately short lived as the Rough Riders (Black Bart and Johnny Mantell) won the gold on October 23. The title loss was forced due to Booker T suffering a knee injury that needed surgery and time off to recover. In early 1993 the Ebony Experience returned to action and started to chase The Bad Breed (Axl and Ian Rotten) who had won the titles while Booker T recovered. On February 26 the Ebony Experience won their third GWF Tag Team championship, becoming the only team to hold that title three times. Their third run with the title proved to be their longest as they held them until May 7 where Guido Falcone and Vito Mussolini (known as The Sicilian Stallions) defeated them for the titles. Not long after this Booker T and Stevie Ray left the GWF, having signed with World Championship Wrestling (WCW).\n\nIn August 1993, the brothers debuted in WCW as the tag team Harlem Heat, with Booker renamed Kole and Lash renamed Kane. They were then billed from Harlem. Originally, they were supposed to be a pair of wrestling prisoners won in a card game by manager Col. Rob Parker, but was changed due to racial sensitivity based on their look, coming out to the ring in wrist and foot shackles. They became heels and teamed with Vader and Sid Vicious in the War Games at Fall Brawl on September 19, 1993, against Sting, Davey Boy Smith, Dustin Rhodes, and The Shockmaster. They lost the match but were over as heels because of the caliber of faces they wrestled.\n\nSister Sherri began managing the team in 1994 and changed their names back to Booker T and Stevie Ray, at their request. By the end of 1994, they were already Tag Team Champions, having defeated Stars and Stripes (The Patriot and Marcus Alexander Bagwell) in December, en route to a five-month title reign. This would be their first of ten WCW World Tag Team Championship reigns together.\n\nAfter dropping the title to the Nasty Boys, Harlem Heat regained the belts on June 24, 1995. Harlem Heat became tweeners and entered a feud with Col. Parker's Stud Stable of \"Dirty\" Dick Slater and Bunkhouse Buck, eventually dropping the titles to them on an episode of \"Saturday Night\" on July 22, 1995, thanks to interference from Parker. Parker and Sherri were carrying on a love affair and Parker eventually left the Stud Stable in favor of the Heat to be with Sherri. Harlem Heat regained the WCW World Tag Team titles from Slater and Buck at Fall Brawl 1995. Their third title only lasted one day, but the duo regained the tag team title nine days later from the American Males (Marcus Alexander Bagwell and Scotty Riggs). On the June 24, 1996 \"Nitro\", Harlem Heat defeated Lex Luger and Sting to capture their fifth WCW World Tag Team titles. Three days after losing the tag team titles to the Steiner Brothers, Harlem Heat regained the straps from the Steiners on July 27, 1996. On September 23, 1996 Booker T and Stevie Ray were defeated by Public Enemy (Rocco Rock and Johnny Grunge) but took the titles back for the seventh time on October 1, 1996.\n\nAfter the loss of their seventh WCW World Tag Team Championship, to The Outsiders (Kevin Nash and Scott Hall) on October 27, 1996 they became full-fledged faces when they fired Col. Parker and beat him up. They briefly feuded against Parker's newest team The Amazing French Canadians, a feud they would win. In 1997, they feuded with Public Enemy, The Steiners, and the nWo. On the July 7, 1997 \"Nitro\", they fired Sherri and added a new manager, Jacqueline, on the September 15 \"Nitro\". They were briefly put out of action by the nWo, but returned to feud with the Faces of Fear (Meng and The Barbarian). Stevie then took five months off from WCW to recover from an ankle injury and Jacqueline left for the WWF while Booker made a transition to singles competition. Booker managed to win the WCW World Television Championship during Stevie's absence. Upon his return to WCW, Stevie Ray joined the New World Order, while Booker continued to be a rising singles star. Despite being on opposite sides they managed to peacefully co-exist (despite Booker expressing dismay at Stevie for joining the nWo).\n\nBy mid-1999, Booker was able to convince his brother to leave the nWo and reunited Harlem Heat once more. The two defeated Bam Bam Bigelow and Kanyon for their record-breaking eighth WCW World Tag Team championships at the 1999 Road Wild but lost them to Barry and Kendall Windham. Harlem Heat would defeat them about a month later at the 1999 Fall Brawl for the WCW World Tag Team titles.\nWhen The Filthy Animals were stripped of the WCW World Tag Team belts due to an injury suffered by Rey Mysterio Jr., the title was put up in a three-way dance at Halloween Havoc 1999. Harlem Heat claimed their tenth WCW World Tag Team title defeating members of The First Family (Hugh Morrus and Brian Knobs) and the Filthy Animals (Konnan and Billy Kidman).\n\nIn late 1999, a female bodybuilder named Midnight joined Harlem Heat. While Booker T liked the addition, Stevie Ray neglected her help and started arguing with Booker T. Ray eventually challenged Midnight in a match that would decide whether she would stay with Harlem Heat. After being defeated with a surprise small package, Stevie Ray turned on both Booker T and Midnight.\n\nIn February, 2000 Stevie Ray formed Harlem Heat, Inc. with Big T, Kash (formerly known as 4x4 from The No Limit Soldiers) and J. Biggs. Stevie Ray and Big T referred to themselves as Harlem Heat 2000.\n\nBooker T lost the rights to his music and the \"T\" in his name, as it was owned by Harlem Heat and was referred to simply as Booker. Harlem Heat 2000 won the rights to the Harlem Heat name when Big T pinned Booker on February 20, 2000 at SuperBrawl 2000, and also the rights to use the \"Rap Sheet\" theme, as he used a cartoonish theme called \"The Woodchuck's Game\". Kidman and Booker defeated Harlem Heat 2000 (Stevie Ray and Big T) at Uncensored.\n\nOn February 21, 2015, Booker T and Stevie Ray reunited as Harlem Heat for one last match at Booker T's promotion, Reality of Wrestling's The Final Heat event, where they defeated The New Heavenly Bodies for the ROW Tag Team Championship.\n\n\n"}

Hoffman, Mel Greenberg and Robert H. Traurig. For the past three years, it has ranked #14 in the AM Law 100 by gross revenue, and in the top 20 the Global 200. .\n\nIt has 41 offices in the United States, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia, and has approximately 2100 attorneys worldwide. Their largest office is in New York City.\n\nIn the 1970s, Greenberg, Traurig and Hoffman became Greenberg, Traurig, Hoffman, Lipoff, and Quentel with the addition of attorneys Norman H. Lipoff and Albert D. Quentel as named shareholders. The late Florida governor Reubin Askew was a named shareholder in the early 1980s while he also sought the Democratic nomination for president.\n\nLarry Hoffman became managing partner of the firm in 1991, at which point the firm began to expand nationwide, beginning with the opening of an office in New York City. Greenberg Traurig expanded to Chicago, Boston, Los Angeles and Wilmington (Delaware) in 1999; in 2000, the firm doubled the size of its New York City office by acquiring the local office of the defunct Graham & James. \n\nIn July 2009 Greenberg Traurig opened an office in London under the name of Greenberg Traurig Maher LLP (since renamed to Greenberg Traurig, LLP). The London office is currently located in The Shard skyscraper.\n\nAccording to the Center for Responsive Politics, Greenberg Traurig was one of the top law firms contributing to federal candidates during the 2012 election cycle, donating $1.49 million, 50.2% to Democrats. By comparison, during that same period Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld donated $2.56 million, 66% to Democrats, while oil conglomerate ExxonMobil donated $2.66 million, 88% to Republicans. Since 1990, Greenberg Traurig contributed $11.2 million to federal campaigns.\n\nIn 2013 the firm launched a residency program to hire associates who are not recruited in traditional on-campus interviews by allowing them to spend up to a third of their billable hours in training for a one-year trial period.\n\nIn 2016, Brian Duffy became CEO.\n\nIn July 2018, founding member Robert Traurig died at age 93 in Miami, Florida.\n\nAs of 2018, Greenberg Traurig was the 14th largest law firm in the United States.\n\nSince its launch in 2009, Greenberg Traurig has participated in the American Bar Association's National Pro Bono Week.\n\nThe Greenberg Traurig Holly Skolnick Fellowship Foundation was established in 1999. The Foundation supports Equal Justice Works public interest lawyers. Previously named the Greenberg Traurig Fellowship Foundation, the program was renamed in 2013 in honor of the late Holly Skolnick, a Greenberg Traurig shareholder who helped establish the foundation and served as its president.\n\nIn January 2001, lobbyist Jack Abramoff left Preston Gates & Ellis to join Greenberg Traurig. Abramoff brought a book of business then worth more than $6 million annually to Greenberg Traurig, according to his own estimates. At the firm he assembled \"Team Abramoff\", a lobbying team that was involved in the Jack Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal and the monetary influence of Jack Abramoff.\n\nIn 2001, Victor Reyes, who headed the Hispanic Democratic Organization and had close ties to Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley, joined Greenberg Traurig and led the firm's Chicago lobbying practice. After Reyes's arrival, from 2001 to 2005, Greenberg earned $3.5 million in city-related legal fees, including for representing the city in the United Airlines and RCN Cable TV bankruptcies. US Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald subsequently alleged that Reyes's law office was central to a patronage scheme to funnel city jobs to pro-Daley campaign workers. Reyes resigned from Greenberg in August 2005, and in September federal prosecutors indicted five city employees, including a former Reyes aide, in the scandal. Reyes wasn't charged, but prosecutors called him as a \"co-schemer\" in the indictment. Greenberg CEO César Álvarez stated, \"I don't know about anything [Reyes] did in the firm that was wrong. I can only know what I have seen, and I only know that he hasn't been charged\".\n\nIn May 2005, Philadelphia partner Robert S. Grossman plead guilty to charges that he had lied in a 1996 bankruptcy case to cover up his improper diversion of over $100,000 to his personal account when he worked as a real estate developer in Virginia. Greenberg Traurig professed surprise at Grossman's arrest the following November for failing to report to prison, and stated that Grossman hadn't disclosed the criminal proceeding to the firm. Greenberg has stated that it now does background checks on all new employees.\nIn December 2005, Leonard Ross, an attorney formerly with Greenberg Traurig's Philadelphia office, was charged with fraud as part of an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation into city government. Ross was a friend and former law partner of Philadelphia Mayor John F. Street: Federal prosecutors alleged that Ross's employment at Greenberg was \"entirely dependent on his relationship with Mayor Street\" and \"a motive for selling his office as a PLC [Penns Landing Corporation] board member\".\nIn June 2006, Greenberg Traurig agreed to pay the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation $7.6 million for its role as a legal adviser to the now-defunct Hamilton Bank of Miami, to settle allegations that it had helped to cover up bank officers' financial misconduct. The firm paid an additional $750,000 fine to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency for allegedly protecting the bank's officers \"by making materially false and misleading assertions and by suppressing material evidence\".\nIn November 2006, Jay I. Gordon, the former chairman of Greenberg Traurig's tax practice, resigned from the New York bar and was disbarred for taking over $1.2 million in kickbacks on tax shelters that he had recommended to wealthy clients of the firm.\nOn July 12, 2006, the Alabama-Coushatta tribe filed a federal racketeering lawsuit against now-convicted Abramoff and his cohorts. The suit said the firm allowed checks sent by the tribe to a bogus Abramoff-linked think tank to be funneled and cashed through Greenberg Traurig.\nIn April 2008, the charges of deception, theft and conspiracy were dismissed by Guam prosecutors after Greenberg Traurig agreed to refund $324,000 in lobbying fees to the Guam judiciary.\nIn November 2008, a New York State court refused to dismiss a suit alleging that Robert J. Ivanhoe, head of its real estate group, disregarded his \"legal and fiduciary duties\" by taking a personal financial stake in a competitor to a client that had invested in a multibillion-dollar real estate venture. The former client had sued Ivanhoe and Greenberg Traurig in April 2008 for breach of fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, tortious interference with prospective economic damages, and malpractice. Greenberg Traurig responded that the allegations were \"without merit\" and that it would appeal the ruling.\nIn December 2008, the firm and several current and former firm attorneys (Harley Lewin and Steven Wadyka) were sued in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia by Catherine and Richard Snyder of Herndon, Virginia. Also named in the suit, Greenberg Traurig's client, Diane Von Furstenberg Studios, Conde Nast Publications, \"The New Yorker\" and \"New Yorker\" staff reporter, Larissa MacFarquhar. The Snyders' suit stems from a suit filed in the same court by Diane Von Furstenberg Studios against Catherine Snyder in December 2006 for trademark infringement, which resulted in an award of damages to DVF Studios. The Snyders' complaint alleges, among other things, that the Greenberg attorneys made false statements to the court when applying for a search warrant and that one (Wadyka) impersonated a federal officer by flashing a badge and stating that he was with the office of the U.S. Attorney. The suit also alleges that the attorneys failed to post a required bond and that the search of the Snyders' home exceeded the scope of the warrant and resulted in the seizure of many personal items. The suit also alleges that the firm's attorneys improperly brought \"New Yorker\" staff reporter MacFarquhar, who was profiling Lewin for a forthcoming article, into the Snyders' home while conducting their raid in December 2006 pursuant to the search warrant.\nIn 2014, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) looked into insider trader allegations between United States House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health staff director Brian Sutter and Mark Hayes, a lobbyist at Greenberg Traurig. In November, 2015, New York U.S. District Judge Paul Gardephe ordered the U.S. House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee and a former staffer to respond to an SEC subpoena request within 10 days in a health care insider-trading probe, but he did term the request \"overbroad.\" The SEC sought to determine whether Sutter or anyone else from the Committee tipped off lobbyist Mark Hayes of Greenberg Traurig, which information was then forwarded to Height Securities LLC. Judge Gardephe reasoned that the congressional Speech and Debate Clause does not provide protection for information communicated by a legislative member or aide to a member of the public, and that Sutter's statements to employees of Greenberg are consequently not protected and must be produced. After two years of litigation and its 2nd Circuit appeal of the subpoena in December 2015, the Committee finally dropped its opposition to the order requested by the SEC.\n\nIn May 2018, the firm parted ways with Rudy Giuliani over his allegations that he would pay his clients' adversaries hush money in a manner consistent with the Stormy Daniels affair. Mr. Giuliani suggested that such payments were common at his firm, even without the knowledge of the clients.\n\n"}

Perlo was the son of ethnic Jewish parents who had both emigrated in their youth to America from the Russian empire. His father, Samuel Perlo, was a lawyer and his mother, Rachel Perlo, was a teacher.\n\nPerlo received his Bachelor's degree from Columbia University in New York City in 1931 and Master's degree in mathematics from the same school in 1933.\n\nLate in 1932 or early in 1933, while still a student at Columbia, Perlo joined the Communist Party USA, an organization with which he was affiliated throughout his life.\n\nPerlo married his first wife, Katherine, in 1933 and divorced in 1943. Subsequently, he married his second wife, Ellen (whose uncle was Robert Menaker), with whom he remained for the rest of his life. The couple had three children, a girl and two boys.\n\nPerlo had varied interests, which included tennis, mountain climbing, and chess. He was also a talented pianist.\n\nAfter his graduation from Columbia in 1933, Perlo went to work as a statistical analyst and assistant to a division chief at the National Recovery Administration (NRA), remaining at that post until June 1935. Perlo then moved to the Federal Home Loan Bank Board where he was an analyst for the Home Owners' Loan Corporation, establishing statistical analyses for properties mortgaged to the corporation and projecting long term financial accounts. Perlo worked in that capacity until October 1937.\n\nIn October 1937, Perlo left government service to work in the Brookings Institution, a liberal think tank established in 1916, where he stayed as a researcher for more than two years. In November 1939, Perlo went to work in the US Department of Commerce, where he worked as a senior economic analyst in the Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce.\n\nPerlo moved to the Office of Price Administration (OPA) in November 1940, where he was head of the economic statistics division. There Perlo engaged in the study of inflationary pressures in the American economy, particularly with the advent of World War II, which helped provide documentation enabling the institution of price controls.\n\nPerlo remained in that capacity until leaving to become head of the aviation section of the Bureau of Programs and Statistics at the War Production Board (WPB). Perlo's work at the WPB involved analysis of the various economic problems of aircraft production. In September 1944 he was made a special assistant to the director of the Bureau of Programs and Statistics of the WPB.\n\nDuring his time in the federal bureaucracy, Perlo was a contributor to the Communist Party's press, submitting articles on economic matters under a variety of pseudonyms. He also secretly assisted I.F. Stone in gathering materials for various journalistic exposés.\n\nAbout December 1945, Perlo went to the U.S. Treasury Department, where he worked in the Monetary Research department. There he was an alternate member of the Committee for Reciprocity Information, which took care of technical work relating to trade agreements under the Reciprocal Trade Agreement Act and doing preparatory work for the International Trade Organization.\n\nPerlo left government service in 1947, when his loyalty was called into question during an investigation by the House Unamerican Activities Committee. Perlo denied allegations that he had spied for the Soviet Union.\n\nA dedicated Communist, Victor Perlo allegedly headed the Perlo group of Soviet espionage agents in the United States. Before World War II, Perlo had been a member of the Ware spy ring. The Perlo ring included several important U.S. officials, including a Senate staff director, and the ring supplied the Soviet Union with economic, political, and military intelligence, including United States aircraft production figures.\n\nPerlo infiltrated through the United States Department of Commerce in 1938 to gather economic intelligence, and passed on intelligence concerning basic economic decisions he presented to Harry Hopkins, Secretary of Commerce. He transferred to the Division of Monetary Research, and served under Harry Dexter White, followed by Frank Coe and Harold Glasser, all of whom were later found to be Soviet agents.\n\nIn 1948, Perlo obtained a position as an economist for the Progressive Party, assisting the Presidential campaign of former U.S. Secretary of Agriculture and Vice President Henry Wallace. Following the publication of his book \"Economics of Racism\", Victor Perlo received the Myers Center award for his exceptional work on intolerance in North America.\n\nIn 1968, he signed the \"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest\" pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.\n\nHe died on December 1, 1999 at his home in Croton-on-Hudson, New York. He was 87 years old at the time of his death.\n\nVictor Perlo's papers are housed in the special collections department of Lewis J. Ort Library at Frostburg State University in Frostburg, Maryland.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He attended Drury College (now Drury University), and graduated from Harvard Business School with an MBA in 1935. Ulmann then took a job with the National Recovery Administration. There he met Greg and Helen Silvermaster. The three jointly bought a house in 1938. In 1937 Ullman transferred to the Resettlement Administration (which became the Farm Security Administration). In 1939 Ulmann was recommended by his superior C. B. Baldwin to Harry Dexter White and was hired at the Division of Monetary Research in the United States Department of the Treasury. His immediate supervisor in his new post was Frank Coe. By 1941 Ullmann had become White's administrative assistant.\n\nUllmann worked in the Treasury until he was drafted into World War II 1942. He then obtained a commission in the Army Air Force and through George Silverman was assigned to the Pentagon. He was \"chief photographer of stolen government documents for the Silvermaster espionage ring\" while a Major in the Material and Services Division of the Army Air Corps. Among the information Ullmann supplied to Soviet intelligence were: aircraft production figures, allocation and deployment of aircraft, results of aircraft testing, reports on the efficiency of particular types of planes, technological developments in aircraft manufacture, statistics regarding high octane gasoline, personal data regarding important Air Force officers, opinions of aircraft personnel on other nations, Army gossip, all pertinent developments concerning planning, construction and actual completion of the B-29 Superfortress, proposed movements of the planes when they were completed, the approximate schedule of D Day, copies of directives issued to General George Marshall, and information concerning production, allocation and development of tanks, guns and motorized equipment. He provided the Soviets with a considerable volume of almost every conceivable type of information relating to the United States Army Air Force's part in World War II.\n\nIn the basement of the Silvermaster and Ullmann home, Ullmann maintained a photographic darkroom for copying and processing stolen documents and reducing them to microfilm. The volume of information eventually became so overwhelming that only negatives were completed because Ullman could not process the stolen documents fast enough. The information was then passed on through Elizabeth Bentley.\n\nKathryn S. Olmsted, the author of \"Red Spy Queen\" (2002), points out: \"Every two weeks, Elizabeth would travel to Washington to pick up documents from the Silvermasters, collect their Party dues, and deliver Communist literature. Soon the flow of documents grew so large that Ullmann, an amateur photographer, set up a darkroom in their basement. Elizabeth usually collected at least two or three rolls of microfilmed secret documents, and one time received as many as forty. She would stuff all the film and documents into a knitting bag or other innocent feminine accessory, then take it back to New York on the train.\" Moscow complained that around half of the photographed documents received in the summer of 1944 were unreadable and suggested that Ullmann should receive more training. However, Pavel Fitin, who was responsible for analyzing the material, described it as very important data.\n\nAfter his discharge in 1943, he returned to the Treasury Department. Ullmann was a United States delegate to the United Nations Charter meeting at San Francisco and to the Bretton Woods Conference as Harry Dexter White's assistant.\n\nUllmann was never prosecuted. He later became a real estate developer in New Jersey and died on February 3, 1993 in Beach Haven, New Jersey with an $8 million estate.\n\n"}

It is a manual condensing and systematizing the 5th century understanding and interpretation of the Buddhist path as maintained by the elders of the Mahavihara Monastery in Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka. \n\nIt is considered the most important Theravada text outside of the Tipitaka canon of scriptures, and is described as \"the hub of a complete and coherent method of exegesis of the Tipitaka,\" but it has also been criticised for its non-canonical departures, and its interpretation of \"dhyana\" as concentration-meditation.\n\nThe structure of the \"Visuddhimagga\" is based on the \"Ratha-vinita Sutta\" (\"Relay Chariots Discourse,\" MN 24), which describes the progression from the purity of discipline to the final destination of nibbana in seven steps. The \"Visuddhimagga\"'s material also strongly resembles the material found in an earlier treatise called the Vimuttimagga (c. 1st or 2nd century).\n\nThe \"Visuddhimagga\"'s doctrine reflects Theravada Abhidhamma scholasticism, which includes several innovations and interpretations not found in the earliest discourses (\"suttas\") of the Buddha. Buddhaghosa's \"Visuddhimagga\" includes non-canonical instructions on Theravada meditation, such as \"ways of guarding the mental image (nimitta),\" which point to later developments in Theravada meditation. \n\nThe \"Visuddhimagga\" is centered around \"kasina\"-meditation, a form of concentration-meditation in which the mind is focused on a (mental) object. According to Thanissaro Bhikkhu, \"[t]he text then tries to fit all other meditation methods into the mold of kasina practice, so that they too give rise to countersigns, but even by its own admission, breath meditation does not fit well into the mold.\" In its emphasis on \"kasina\"-meditation, the \"Visuddhimagga\" departs from the Pali Canon, in which \"dhyana\" is the central meditative practice, indicating that what \"jhana means in the commentaries is something quite different from what it means in the Canon.\"\n\nKalupahana notes that the \"Visuddhimagga\" contains \"some metaphysical speculations, such as those of the Sarvastivadins, the Sautrantikas, and even the Yogacarins\". Kalupahana comments:\n\nThe \"Visuddhimagga\" is composed of three sections, which discuss: 1) \"Sīla\" (ethics or discipline); 2) \"Samādhi\" (meditative concentration); 3) \"Pañña\" (understanding or wisdom).\n\nThis comparison between practice and \"seven relay chariots\" points at the goal. Each purity is needed to attain the next. They are often referred to as the \"Seven Stages of Purification\" (\"satta-visuddhi\"):\n\nThe \"Purification by Knowledge and Vision\" is the culmination of the practice, in four stages leading to liberation and Nirvana. The emphasis in this system is on understanding the three marks of existence, dukkha, anatta, anicca. This emphasis is recognizable in the value that is given to vipassana over samatha in the contemporary vipassana movement.\n\nAccording to scholars, the \"Visuddhimagga\" is one of the extremely rare texts within the enormous literatures of various forms of Jainism, Buddhism, and Hinduism to give explicit details about how spiritual masters were thought to actually manifest supernormal abilities. Abilities such as flying through the air, walking through solid obstructions, diving into the ground, walking on water and so forth are performed by changing one element, such as earth, into another element, such as air. The individual must master \"kasina\" meditation before this is possible. Dipa Ma, who trained via the \"Visuddhimagga\", was said to demonstrate these abilities.\n\nThe \"Visuddhimagga\" is considered the most important Theravada text outside of the Tipitaka canon of scriptures. According to Nanamoli Bhikkhu, it is \"the hub of a complete and coherent method of exegesis of the Tipitaka, using the ‘Abhidhamma method' as it is called. And it sets out detailed practical instructions for developing purification of mind.\"\n\nThe \"Visuddhimagga\" is one of the main texts on which contemporary \"vipassana\" method is based, together with the \"Satipatthana Sutta\". Yet, its emphasis on \"kasina\"-meditation and its claim of the possibility of \"dry insight\" has also been criticised and rejected by some contemporary Theravada scholars and \"vipassana\"-teachers.\n\nAccording to Thanissaro Bhikkhu, \"the Visuddhimagga uses a very different paradigm for concentration from what you find in the Canon.\" Bhante Henepola Gunaratana also notes that what \"the suttas say is not the same as what the Visuddhimagga says [...] they are actually different,\" leading to a divergence between a [traditional] scholarly understanding and a practical understanding based on meditative experience. Gunaratana further notes that Buddhaghosa invented several key meditation terms which are not to be found in the suttas, such as \"\"parikamma samadhi\" (preparatory concentration), \"upacara samadhi\" (access concentration), \"appanasamadhi\" (absorption concentration).\" Gunaratana also notes that the Buddhaghosa's emphasis on \"kasina\"-meditation is not to be found in the suttas, where \"dhyana\" is always combined with mindfulness. \n\nBhikkhu Sujato has argued that certain views regarding Buddhist meditation expounded in the Visuddhimagga are a \"distortion of the Suttas\" since it denies the necessity of jhana. The Australian monk Shravasti Dhammika is also critical of contemporary practice based on this work. He concludes that Buddhaghosa did not believe that following the practice set forth in the Visuddhimagga will really lead him to Nirvana, basing himself on the postscript to the Visuddhimagga:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1875303", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1875303", "title": "Michael Pollan", "text": "Michael Pollan\n\nMichael Kevin Pollan (; born February 6, 1955) is an American author, journalist, activist, and the Lewis K. Chan Arts Lecturer and Professor of Practice of Non-Fiction at Harvard University. Pollan is also professor of journalism at the UC Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism.\n\nPollan is best known for his books which explore the socio-cultural impacts of food in books like \"The Botany of Desire\" and \"The Omnivore's Dilemma\".\n\nPollan was born to a Jewish family on Long Island, New York. He is the son of author and financial consultant Stephen Pollan and columnist Corky Pollan. Pollan received a B.A. in English from Bennington College in 1977 and an M.A. in English from Columbia University in 1981.\n\nIn \"The Botany of Desire\", Pollan explores the concept of co-evolution, specifically of humankind's evolutionary relationship with four plants—apples, tulips, marijuana, and potatoes—from the dual perspectives of humans and the plants. He uses case examples that fit the archetype of four basic human desires, demonstrating how each of these botanical species are selectively grown, bred, and genetically engineered. The apple reflects the desire for sweetness, the tulip for beauty, marijuana for intoxication, and the potato for control. \n\nThroughout the book, Pollan explores the narrative of his own experience with each of the plants, which he then intertwines with a well-researched exploration into their social history. Each section presents a unique element of human domestication, or the \"human bumblebee\" as Pollan calls it. These range from the true story of Johnny Appleseed to Pollan's first-hand research with sophisticated marijuana hybrids in Amsterdam, to the alarming and paradigm-shifting possibilities of genetically engineered potatoes.\n\nIn \"The Omnivore's Dilemma\", Pollan describes four basic ways that human societies have obtained food: the current industrial system, the big organic operation, the local self-sufficient farm, and the hunter-gatherer. Pollan follows each of these processes—from a group of plants photosynthesizing calories through a series of intermediate stages, ultimately into a meal. Along the way, he suggests that there is a fundamental tension between the logic of nature and the logic of human industry, that the way we eat represents our most profound engagement with the natural world, and that industrial eating obscures crucially important ecological relationships and connections. On December 10, 2006, \"The New York Times\" named \"The Omnivore's Dilemma\" one of the five best nonfiction books of the year. On May 8, 2007, the James Beard Foundation named \"The Omnivore's Dilemma\" its 2007 winner for the best food writing. It was the book of focus for the University of Pennsylvania's Reading Project in 2007, and the book of choice for Washington State University's Common Reading Program in 2009–10.\n\nPollan's discussion of the industrial food chain is in large part a critique of modern agribusiness. According to the book, agribusiness has lost touch with the natural cycles of farming, wherein livestock and crops intertwine in mutually beneficial circles. Pollan's critique of modern agribusiness focuses on what he describes as the overuse of corn for purposes ranging from fattening cattle to massive production of corn oil, high-fructose corn syrup, and other corn derivatives. He describes what he sees as the inefficiencies and other drawbacks of factory farming and gives his assessment of organic food production and what it's like to hunt and gather food. He blames those who set the rules (e.g., politicians in Washington, D.C., bureaucrats at the United States Department of Agriculture, Wall Street capitalists, and agricultural conglomerates like Archer Daniels Midland) of what he calls a destructive and precarious agricultural system that has wrought havoc upon the diet, nutrition, and well-being of Americans. Pollan finds hope in Joel Salatin's Polyface Farm in Virginia, which he sees as a model of sustainability in commercial farming. Pollan appears in the documentary film \"King Corn\" (2007).\n\nPollan's book \"In Defense of Food: An Eater's Manifesto\", released on January 1, 2008, explores the relationship with what he terms \"nutritionism\" and the Western diet, with a focus on late 20th century food advice given by the science community. Pollan holds that consumption of fat and dietary cholesterol does not lead to a higher rate of coronary disease, and that the reductive analysis of food into nutrient components is a mistake. \n\nThroughout the book, Pollan questions the view that the point of eating is to promote health, pointing out that this attitude is not universal and that cultures that perceive food as having purposes of pleasure, identity, and sociality may end up with better health. He explains this seeming paradox by vetting, and then validating, the notion that nutritionism and, therefore, the whole Western framework through which we intellectualize the value of food is more a religious and faddish devotion to the mythology of simple solutions than a convincing and reliable conclusion of incontrovertible scientific research. \n\nPollan spends the rest of his book explicating his first three phrases: \"Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.\" He contends that most of what Americans now buy in supermarkets, fast food stores, and restaurants is not in fact food, and that a practical tip is to eat only those things that people of his grandmother's generation would have recognized as food.\nIn 2009, \"\" was published. This short work is a condensed version of his previous efforts, intended to provide a simple framework for a healthy and sustainable diet. It is divided into three sections, further explicating Pollan's principles of \"Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.\" It includes his rules (\"i.e.,\" \"let others sample your food\" and \"the whiter the bread, the sooner you'll be dead\").\n\nIn \"\", published in 2013, Pollan explores the methods by which cooks mediate \"between nature and culture.\" The book is organized into four sections corresponding to the classical elements of Fire (cooking with heat), Water (braising and boiling with pots), Air (breadmaking), and Earth (fermenting). The book also features Samin Nosrat, who later became known for the bestselling cookbook \"Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat\", and as \"the chef who taught Michael Pollan how to cook.\"\n\nIn 2018, Pollan wrote \"How to Change Your Mind,\" a book about the history and future of psychedelic drugs. He argues that psilocybin and LSD are not drugs that make people crazy, which he calls the biggest misconception people have about psychedelics, but rather drugs that can help a person become \"more sane\" by, for example, eliminating a fear of death. While promoting his book on TV, he explained that along with LSD and psilocybin, his research included ingesting ayahuasca and 5-MeO-DMT, and that he experienced a dissolution of ego.\n\nPollan is a contributing writer for the \"New York Times Magazine\" and a former executive editor for \"Harper's Magazine\". His first book, \"Second Nature: A Gardener's Education\", was published in 1991. \n\nPollan has contributed to \"Greater Good\", a social psychology magazine published by the Greater Good Science Center at the University of California, Berkeley. His article \"Edible Ethics\" discusses the intersection of ethical eating and social psychology.\n\nIn his 1998 book \"A Place of My Own: The Education of an Amateur Builder\", Pollan methodically traced the design and construction of the out-building where he writes. The 2008 re-release of this book was re-titled \"A Place of My Own: The Architecture of Daydreams.\"\n\nPollan wrote and narrated an audiobook, Caffeine: How Caffeine Created the Modern World, for \"Audible.com\"\n\nIn 2014, Pollan wrote the foreword in the healthy eating cookbook \"The Pollan Family Table\". The book is co-authored by his mother, Corky Pollan, and sisters, Lori Pollan, Dana Pollan, and Tracy Pollan.\n\nPollan also co-starred in the documentary, \"Food, Inc.\" (2008), for which he was also a consultant. In 2010 Pollan was interviewed for the film \"Queen of the Sun: What are the bees telling us?\", a feature-length documentary about honey bees and colony collapse disorder. He was also interviewed for \"Vanishing of the Bees\", a documentary also about colony collapse, directed by Maryam Henein and George Langworthy. In 2015, a documentary version of Pollan's book \"In Defense of Food\" premiered on PBS. In 2016, Netflix released a four-part documentary series, which was based on Pollan's book, \"Cooked\" (2013), and was directed by Alex Gibney.\n\nIn 2015, Pollan received the Washburn Award from the Boston Museum of Science, awarded annually to \"an individual who has made an outstanding contribution toward public understanding and appreciation of science and the vital role it plays in our lives\" and was named as a fellow at Harvard University's Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study. \n\nHe has also won the James Beard Leadership award, the Reuters World Conservation Union Global Awards in environmental journalism, the James Beard Foundation Awards for best magazine series in 2003, and the Genesis Award from the Humane Society of the United States. His articles have been anthologized in \"Best American Science Writing\" (2004), \"Best American Essays\" (1990 and 2003), \"The Animals: Practicing Complexity\" (2006), and the \"Norton Book of Nature Writing\" (1990). In 2008, Pollan received the Washington University International Humanities Medal.\n\nIn the American Enterprise Institute's magazine, Blake Hurst argues that Pollan offers a shallow assessment of factory farming that does not take cost into account. Daniel Engber criticized Pollan in \"Slate\" for arguing that food is too complex a subject to study scientifically and blaming reductionism for today's health ills, while using nutritional research to justify his own diet advice. Engber likened Pollan's \"anti-scientific method\" to the rhetoric used by health gurus who peddle diet scams.\n\nPollan's work has also been discussed and criticized by Jonathan Safran Foer in his non-fiction book \"Eating Animals\".\nFoer criticizes Pollan's argument regarding table-fellowship. According to Foer, Pollan claims that a vegetarian dinner guest causes socially reprimandable inconvenience for the host. Foer responds that in the year 2010 it is easier for hosts to accommodate vegetarians than locavores as hosts will need to do extensive research to find (expensive) non factory-farmed meat.\n\nPollan has been accused by Jon Entine, who supports GMOs (genetically modified organisms), of using his influence to promote \"anti-GMO junk science\". A number of scientists and journalists have similarly characterized Pollan's work as biased against GMOs. For example, after Pollan posted a tweet that was critical of a \"New York Times\" article on GMOs, U.C. Berkeley biologist Michael Eisen posted a tweet calling Pollan's comment \"a new low even in Pollan's 'anti-GMO crusade'\". In response to Pollan's statement that GMOs have been one \"tremendous disappointment,\" food writer James Cooper criticized Pollan's tendency to cite poor or selected scientific sources.\n\nIn 2014, Pollan co-hosted a discussion and informal debate on the topic of genetic modification at UC Berkeley featuring prominent plant geneticist Pamela Ronald, professor at UC Davis, whose research-based position \"strongly disagrees with Pollan’s view that G.M.O. crops, broadly, are failing.\" A \"New Yorker\" reporter observed that Pollan's largely anti-GMO student base at the discussion itself constituted, \"a kind of monoculture,\" yet that Pollan sought \"to introduce an invasive species\" by engaging Ronald. The event, while predictably contentious, reportedly produced a rare instance of courteous, productive exchange between the two main sharply-opposed viewpoints on genetically-modified crops.\n\n\n"}

He began his solo career in 1971, singing popular ballads and amassing 17 number one country hits. His straightforward yet smooth bass-baritone voice, soft tones, and imposing build earned him the nickname: \"Gentle Giant\" of country music. He was also noted for his \"velvet voice.\"\n\nWilliams was born the youngest of three sons on May 27, 1939, in Floydada, Texas. His parents were Loveta Mae (née Lambert; 1914 – 2007) and James Andrew \"Jim\" Williams (1898 – 1982). He grew up in Portland, Texas, and graduated from Gregory-Portland High School in 1958. After Williams' parents divorced, Loveta Williams remarried, first to Chester Lang and then to Robert Bevers.\n\nOn July 20, 1963, Williams' eldest brother Kenneth died after being accidentally electrocuted when touching a live wire. He was 29 years old.\n\nPrior to forming the folk-pop group Pozo-Seco Singers, Williams served with the United States Army Security Agency for two years then, after his honorable discharge, worked various odd jobs in order to support himself and his family.\n\nIt was with the group the Pozo-Seco Singers that Williams, alongside Susan Taylor and Lofton Cline, recorded several records for Columbia Records. He remained with the group until 1969; it disbanded the following year.\n\nAfter the Pozo-Seco Singers disbanded, Williams briefly worked outside the music industry. Soon, however, Williams resumed his career in music. In December 1971, Williams signed on as a songwriter for Jack Clement with Jack Music Inc. In 1972, Williams inked a contract with JMI Records as a solo country artist. His 1974 song, \"We Should Be Together,\" reached number five, and he signed with ABC/Dot Records. At the height of the country and western boom in the UK in 1976, he had top forty pop chart hits with \"You're My Best Friend\" and \"I Recall a Gypsy Woman\".\n\nHis first single with ABC/Dot, \"I Wouldn't Want to Live If You Didn't Love Me,\" became a number one hit, and was the first of a string of top ten hits he had between 1974 and 1991. Only four of his 46 singles didn't make it to the Top Ten.\n\n\"I Believe in You\", written by Roger Cook and Sam Hogin, was Williams' eleventh #1 on the country chart. It was his only Top 40 chart entry in the U.S., where it peaked at #24. It was also hit in Australia, New Zealand and Europe.\n\nWilliams had some minor roles in Burt Reynolds movies. In 1975, Don appeared as a member of the Dixie Dancekings band in the movie \"W.W. and the Dixie Dancekings\" alongside Reynolds. Don also appeared as himself in the Universal Pictures movie, \"Smokey and the Bandit II\", in which he also played a number of songs.\n\nEarly in 2006, Williams announced his \"Farewell Tour of the World\" and played numerous dates both in the U.S. and abroad, wrapping the tour up with a sold-out \"Final Farewell Concert\" in Memphis, Tennessee, at the Cannon Center for Performing Arts on November 21, 2006. In 2010, Williams came out of retirement and was once again touring.\n\nIn March 2012, Williams announced the release of a new record \"And So It Goes\" (UK release April 30, 2012; U.S./Worldwide release June 19, 2012), his first new record since 2004. The record is his first with the independent Americana label Sugar Hill Records. The record includes guest appearances by Alison Krauss, Keith Urban, and Vince Gill. To accompany his latest album release he embarked on a UK Tour. A much loved country artist among British fans, he had his final UK tour in 2014.\n\nIn March 2016, Williams announced he was retiring from touring and cancelled all his scheduled shows. \"It's time to hang my hat up and enjoy some quiet time at home. I'm so thankful for my fans, my friends and my family for their everlasting love and support,\" he said in a statement.\n\nOn September 8, 2017, Williams died in Mobile, Alabama, due to emphysema.\n\nWilliams has had a strong influence over a variety of recording artists of different genres. His hits have been covered by artists such as Johnny Cash, Eric Clapton, Claude Russell Bridges, Lefty Frizzell, Josh Turner, Sonny James, Alison Krauss, Billy Dean, Charley Pride, Kenny Rogers, Lambchop, Alan Jackson, Tomeu Penya, Waylon Jennings, Pete Townshend and Tortoise with Bonnie \"Prince\" Billy. His music is also popular internationally, including the UK, Australia, Ireland, Ukraine, India, Cameroon, Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, South Africa, Sierra Leone, Uganda, Namibia and Zimbabwe. In 2010, the Country Music Association inducted Don Williams into the Country Music Hall of Fame. This is considered to be the Country music industry's highest honor to bestow upon an artist.\n\nOn June 25, 2019, \"The New York Times Magazine\" listed Don Williams among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.\n\nAcademy of Country Music\nCountry Music Association\n\nAcademy of Country Music\n\nCountry Music Association\n"}

The EP has eight tracks. There are two other (bootleg) versions of the EP, but the original has only eight tracks. It was released December 24, 2001 on D.P.G. Recordz. The tracks were recorded at Death Row Records between 1995-96 for Tupac's and Boot Camp Clik's project \"One Nation\". Later when Daz left Death Row, he stole an unknown amount of Tupac's unreleased masters, some of which can be heard on this EP. The only track left untouched by Daz is \"They Don't Give a Fuck About Us\", all other tracks were remixed and Daz also added himself onto tracks he originally didn't appear on, despite Dillinger marketing the EP as an original collaboration album.\n\n\"Version 0\": The original track listing posted on hitemup.com included eight tracks: Wake Up My People, First To Bomb, Let's Fight, Um Dumpin, Don't Go To Sleep, They Don't Give A Fuck About Us, 187 Um, Heaven or Hell Outro. This version never saw the light of day however, and track-listings were soon changed.\n\n\"Version 1\": The first leaked release was ripped into poor quality and cut differently so that the tracks all ran together much like they do on the . This was in fact the first release available, and was put out thanks in part to certain members of the Pacboard community. This release included the same six tracks as above, as well as the originals of First to Bomb and Don't Go To Sleep instead of 187 Um and Heaven or Hell Outro. The cover read \"Tupac Shakur & Daz Dillinger\" in green lettering. This release was also released on a label dubbed \"Pacaveli Records\" and shows up from time to time on eBay.\n\n\"Version 1.5\": This was the actual eight track release of the album by Daz Dillinger. It included the usual eight songs and was pressed and sold on the streets. The cover for the album had \"D.P.G. Recordz Presents\" in green lettering at the top of the album and had the track-listing on the back cover.\n\n\"Version 2\": This is the Japan import version. This release included the same eight tracks as before, but also included the tracks \"Move for the Money\", \"Don't Go To Sleep Soul-G Remix\", \"First To Bomb\" instrumental, as well as \"First to Bomb BBK Remix\". For this release the cover was altered as real photos were photoshopped into the background of the cover for the 100 dollar bills. The top of the cover was changed to say Tupac Shakur & Daz Dillinger in white lettering. This release was released by Makaveli Records, and is the most common and easy to find release.\n\n\"Version 3\": Finally, on 13 September 2003, Daz put out what he called \"Makaveli & Dillinger, The Whole Album\". This was basically the Japan import with some skits and filler tracks on it. The only new track that included 2Pac was the song \"Initiated\" which was released in 1998 on Daz's Retaliation, Revenge & Get Back album. The full track-listing for this album included 25 tracks, most of which was from Daz's then new album. Thus far, this was the last Makaveli & Dillinger release.\n\nOn August 27, 2001, mother of Tupac, Afeni Shakur filed a lawsuit against Delmar Arnaud better known as Daz Dillinger seeking unspecified damages caused by his unauthorized pre-release online order for this album on the official website of D.P.G. Recordz. As the only legal successor of the copyright of anything connected with the brand names \"2Pac\" and \"Makaveli\" and executor and estate administrator of Tupac's musical compositions, Afeni Shakur has the right only to grant permission to release the recordings or to use her son's name, that - according to her - she was never earlier asked to do so by any of the management of D.P.G. Recordz.\nThe lawsuit contains 13 causes of action, including :\n\nShakur also maintains that Dillinger was still promoting the release of the album and accepting PayPal orders through his website all unauthorized.\n\nDaz stopped the selling of the Makaveli & Dillinger EP and days after the September 11 attacks the main page of the whole site changed into a tribute design. Later deathrowrecords.com adopted the material claiming the rights of the license for \"Tha Dogg Pound\" and \"Dat Nigga Daz\" and all material recorded under these pseudonyms. It is still purchasable there with some slight modifications in the number of tracks and their order.\n\nDaz claims in the April, 2005 issue of XXL that he still owns several recordings of 2Pac never heard before. While living in Los Angeles he was insulted in several warranted house searches by Suge Knight and by the police that were attempts to confiscate the reels. The legal status of those copies, however, still remains unclear.\n\n"}

He was drafted by the Seattle Seahawks eighth overall in the 1995 NFL Draft and also played for the Dallas Cowboys, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, New England Patriots, Pittsburgh Steelers and Washington Redskins. He played college football at Ohio State. He is the NFL's career leader in receiving yards and receiving touchdowns among players to not be selected for a Pro Bowl.\n\nGalloway played high school football at Bellaire High School in Bellaire, Ohio During his senior year, he caught 52 passes for 1208 yards and eight touchdowns. He also was an All-Ohio choice in basketball and won the state championship in both the 100 and 200 meter dash in track.\n\nGalloway played college football at Ohio State. While there he earned many honors and finished in the top five all time in many of Ohio State's receiving records. During his junior year, he caught 47 passes for 946 yards and tied Cris Carter with a school record 11 touchdowns. His great play earned him First-Team All-Big Ten Conference honors as a junior. During his senior year, he made 44 receptions for 769 yards and seven touchdowns, and earned Second-Team All-Big Ten Conference. He finished his college career fourth in both career receptions with 108 and receiving yards with 1,494, and second in touchdown receptions behind Cris Carter with 19.\n\nGalloway was selected by the Seattle Seahawks eighth overall in the 1995 NFL Draft. He made an immediate impact for the Seahawks, setting franchise season records for a rookie with 67 receptions, 1,067 receiving yards and three 100-yard games. He also had success as a punt returner, returning 36 punts for 360 yards and a touchdown.\n\nDuring his second year he started all 16 games for the Seahawks, leading the team in receptions with 57, receiving yards with 987 and touchdowns with seven. During his third year in 1997 he made 72 receptions for 1,049 yards and 12 touchdowns. In 1998, he reached double digit receiving touchdowns for the second consecutive year with ten. He finished the season with 65 receptions for 1,047 yards.\n\nDuring the 1999 season he played in only eight games due to a contract dispute and a holdout that reached 101 days. When he came back he made 22 receptions for 335 yards and only one touchdown. Overall, he finished his career with the Seahawks with 283 receptions for 4,457 yards and 37 touchdowns in 71 games.\n\nOn February 12, 2000, The Seahawks traded Galloway to the Dallas Cowboys in exchange for their first round selections in the 2000 and 2001 NFL Drafts (which would produce Shaun Alexander and Koren Robinson).\n\nWith quarterback Troy Aikman playing his last years and Michael Irvin looking to retire after suffering a career-ending injury in the 1999 season, the Dallas Cowboys were seeking an elite wide receiver to pair with Raghib Ismail and thus turned to the Seattle Seahawks for the rights to Galloway, signing him to a deal that made him the second highest paid wide receiver in the league at the time.\n\nDuring his first season with the Cowboys, Galloway played in only one game after tearing the ACL in his left knee in the fourth quarter of the season opener against the Philadelphia Eagles. He finished the game with four receptions for 62 yards and a touchdown. The next year, he rebounded from the injury, starting all 16 games and finishing second on the team in receptions with 72 and receiving yards with 699 and first in receiving touchdowns with three.\n\nIn 2002, Galloway started all 16 games, making 61 receptions for 908 yards and six touchdowns.

He finished his career with the Cowboys with 151 receptions for 2,341 yards and 12 touchdowns. Besides the loss of the two first round draft selections, his contract contributed to the salary cap problems that affected Dave Campo's years as head coach.\n\nOn March 19, 2004, the Cowboys traded Galloway to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for Keyshawn Johnson.\n\nGalloway suffered a groin injury in the season opener against the Washington Redskins and was inactive for the next six games of the 2004 season, playing in ten games, he made 33 receptions for 416 yards and five touchdowns.

After starting the first two games, he suffered a foot injury that forced him to miss most of 2008 season (played in 9 games), finishing with only 13 receptions for 138 yards. He was released on February 25, 2009.

Tower is located at 13 Prospect Avenue between the university-run Campus Club and the Cannon Club; it currently has a membership of approximately two hundred and fifteen.\n\nIn the spring of 1902, based on the idea of four sophomores, John Lee '04, Henry Pogue '04, Otto Wolff '04, Conway Shearer '04, and Frank \"Pop\" Little '03 led the formation of a new upperclass eating club. In April, a stake of four hundred dollars was placed to ensure the secure formation of the club the following year.\n\nIn September of the same year, the Princeton Tower Club was formed in the old Monastery Club on University Place, across the University from its current location. It was composed of thirteen members of the senior class and thirteen juniors. During that year, the club hoped to move to a much coveted plot on Prospect Avenue, but settled for the Gulick House on Olden Street. Gulick was also known as the \"Incubator\" because it had served as a first home for a number of the infant eating clubs. After one term in the Incubator, Tower purchased a plot of land from the Cottage Club and, in September 1904, moved to a new home at 89 Prospect Avenue. Seven years later, Tower moved to its current location at 13 Prospect Avenue.\n\nUnder the leadership of Tower, an Inter-Club Council was formed to address issues involving all of the Princeton eating clubs. Tower also led the formation of the Princeton Prospect Foundation, which enables educational opportunities on \"The Street.\" In 1971, Tower became one of the first clubs to accept women.\n\nTower Club has long been an incubator of student activism and intellectual exploration. Such activities include the formation of at least one long-standing secret society, known only for keeping the hearth aflame.\n\nOnly currently enrolled Princeton students can be members of Tower Club; the majority of the membership is composed of juniors and seniors, with new sophomore members admitted each spring during \"bicker.\" Spring bicker is held during the first two to three days of the second semester. Students are informed of their membership status on the Friday of the first week of second semester classes, then initiated the same weekend.\n\nThere is also a smaller bicker process held each October and open exclusively to students in their junior and senior years. The details of bicker, discussions and initiations are kept secret to preserve club tradition. Traditionally known to attract both artistic and politically engaged students on campus, Tower was the most bickered eating club between 2007 and 2010 with an acceptance rate of under 50%.\n\n\n"}

It is from him that the FBI Silvermaster File, documenting the Bureau's investigation into Communist penetration of the Federal government during the 1930s and 1940s, takes its name. His wife, Helen and stepson, Anatole Volkov, were members of his ring.\n\nHe was identified as a Soviet agent in the WPB operating under the code names Pel, Pal, \"Paul\" in the Venona decrypts; and as \"Robert\" both in Venona and independently by defecting Soviet intelligence courier Elizabeth Bentley.\n\nSilvermaster was born to a Jewish family in Odessa, Russia (present-day Odessa, Ukraine) in 1898. He moved with his family to China, where he learned to speak perfect English with a British accent. He emigrated to the United States and earned his B.A. from the University of Washington in Seattle (where he was \"stated to be a known Communist\") and a Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley, where his thesis was entitled \"Lenin's Economic Thought Prior to the October Revolution\". He became a naturalized American citizen in 1926. He was reported to be in contact with a very large number of Communist Party USA officials, and was active in a number of Communist front groups.\n\nFrom August 1935 to November 1938, Silvermaster worked in the Farm Security Administration. From November 1938 to July 1940, he worked on the Maritime Labor Board. From July 1940 to December 1944, he worked in the Department of Agriculture.\n\nWhile nominally remaining on the employment rolls of the Farm Security Administration, Silvermaster arranged in 1942 to be detailed to the Board of Economic Warfare. The transfer, however, triggered objections from military counter-intelligence who suspected he was a hidden Communist and regarded him as a security risk. On July 16, 1942 the U.S. Civil Service Commission recommended \"\"Cancel eligibilities ... and bar him for the duration of the National Emergency.\"\" \n\nSilvermaster denied any Communist links and appealed to Under Secretary of War Robert Patterson to overrule the security officials. Both White House advisor Lauchlin Currie (identified in Venona as the Soviet agent operating under the cover name \"Page\") and Assistant Secretary of the Treasury Harry Dexter White (identified in Venona as the Soviet agent operating under the cover names \"Lawyer\"; \"Jurist\"; \"Richard\") intervened on his behalf. Silvermaster subsequently received two promotions and pay raises.\n\nFrom 1942 to 1945, he was also assigned to the United States Treasury. In mid-1945, he joined the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (later War Assets Corporation). In March 1946, he resigned from government.\n\nOn August 28, 1950, Lee Pressman (a member of the Ware Group, a precursor to the Silvermaster and Perlo) said of Silvermaster, \"I believe he was with the Maritime Labor Board when I was with the CIO, and in that connection I may have had some business dealings with him\" (apparently referring to Silvermasters time with that union 1938–1940).\n\nKathryn S. Olmsted, the author of \"Red Spy Queen\" (2002), points out: \"Every two weeks, Elizabeth would travel to Washington to pick up documents from the Silvermasters, collect their Party dues, and deliver Communist literature. Soon the flow of documents grew so large that Ullmann, an amateur photographer, set up a darkroom in their basement. Elizabeth usually collected at least two or three rolls of microfilmed secret documents, and one time received as many as forty. She would stuff all the film and documents into a knitting bag or other innocent feminine accessory, then take it back to New York on the train.\" Moscow complained that around half of the photographed documents received in the summer of 1944 were unreadable and suggested that Ullmann receive more training. However, Pavel Fitin, who was responsible for analyzing the material, described it as very important data.\n\nAt the War Production Board, Silvermaster was able to provide the Soviet Union with a large amount of data on arms, aircraft, and shipping production. In June 1943, Silvermaster sent a War Production Board report on arms production in the United States, including bombers, pursuit planes, tanks, propelled guns, howitzers, radar and submarines, sub chasers, and the like, to Soviet intelligence. Then, in December 1944, the New York MGB office cabled another Silvermaster report stating: \"(Silvermaster) has sent us a 50-page Top Secret War Production Board report ... on arms production in the U.S.\"\n\nIn 1944, Silvermaster was associated with Harry Dexter White at the Bretton Woods conference, and his testimony before the US Senate Internal Security Subcommittee covers \"175 pages of interrogation and exhibits\" regarding his espionage activities in the U.S. \nThe Silvermaster spy ring operated primarily in the Department of the Treasury but also had contacts in the Army Air Force and in the White House. Sixty-one of the Venona cables concern the activities of the Silvermaster spy ring. This represents 1% of the total (approx 6,000 cables) and 3% of the (2,000) translated/partially translated VENONA cables.\n\nHe died on October 7, 1964, aged 65, possibly in Harvey Cedars, New Jersey.\n\n"}
{"id": "1875331", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1875331", "title": "Carmine Infantino", "text": "Carmine Infantino\n\nCarmine Michael Infantino (; May 24, 1925 – April 4, 2013) was an American comics artist and editor, primarily for DC Comics, during the late 1950s and early 1960s period known as the Silver Age of Comic Books. Among his character creations are the Silver Age version of DC super-speedster the Flash with writer Robert Kanigher, the stretching Elongated Man with John Broome, Deadman with writer Arnold Drake, and Christopher Chance, the second iteration of the Human Target with Len Wein.\n\nHe was inducted into comics' Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame in 2000.\n\nCarmine Infantino was born via midwife in his family's apartment in Brooklyn, New York City. His father, Pasquale \"Patrick\" Infantino, born in New York City, was originally a musician who played saxophone, clarinet, and violin, and had a band with composer Harry Warren. During the Great Depression he turned to a career as a licensed plumber. Carmine Infantino's mother, Angela Rosa DellaBadia, emigrated from Calitri, a hill town northeast of Naples, Italy.\n\nInfantino attended Public Schools 75 and 85 in Brooklyn before going on to the School of Industrial Art (later renamed the High School of Art and Design) in Manhattan. During his freshman year of high school, Infantino began working for Harry \"A\" Chesler, whose studio was one of a handful of comic-book \"packagers\" who created complete comics for publishers looking to enter the emerging field in the 1930s–1940s Golden Age of Comic Books. As Infantino recalled:\n\nWith Frank Giacoia penciling, Infantino inked the feature \"Jack Frost\" in \"USA Comics\" #3 (cover-dated Jan. 1942), from Timely Comics, the forerunner of Marvel Comics. He wrote in his autobiography that\n\nInfantino would eventually work for several publishers during the decade, drawing Human Torch and Angel stories for Timely; Airboy and Heap stories for Hillman Periodicals; working for packager Jack Binder, who supplied Fawcett Comics; briefly at Holyoke Publishing; then landing at DC Comics. Infantino's first published work for DC was \"The Black Canary\", a six-page Johnny Thunder story in \"Flash Comics\" #86 (Aug. 1947) that introduced the superheroine the Black Canary. Infantino's long association with the Flash mythos began with \"The Secret City\" a story in \"All-Flash\" #31 (Oct.-Nov. 1947). He additionally became a regular artist of the Golden Age Green Lantern and the Justice Society of America.\n\nDuring the 1950s, Infantino freelanced for Joe Simon and Jack Kirby's company, Prize Comics, drawing the series \"Charlie Chan\". Back at DC, during a lull in the popularity of superheroes, Infantino drew Westerns, mysteries, science fiction comics.\n\nIn 1956, DC editor Julius Schwartz assigned writer Robert Kanigher and artist Infantino to the company's first attempt at reviving superheroes: an updated version of the Flash that would appear in issue #4 (Oct. 1956) of the try-out series \"Showcase\". Infantino designed the now-classic red uniform with yellow detail (reminiscent of the original Fawcett Captain Marvel), striving to keep the costume as streamlined as possible, and he drew on his design abilities to create a new visual language to depict the Flash's speed, using both vertical and horizontal motion lines to make the figure a red and yellow blur. The eventual success of the new, science-fiction-oriented Flash heralded the wholesale return of superheroes, and the beginning of what fans and historians call the Silver Age of comics.\nInfantino drew \"Flash of Two Worlds,\" a landmark story published in \"The Flash\" #123 (Sept. 1961) that introduced Earth-Two, and more generally the concept of the multiverse, to DC Comics. Infantino continued to work for Schwartz in his other features and titles, most notably \"Adam Strange\" in \"Mystery in Space\", succeeding the character's initial artist, Mike Sekowsky. In 1964, Schwartz was made responsible for reviving the faded Batman titles. Writer John Broome and artist Infantino jettisoned the sillier aspects that had crept into the series (such as Ace the Bathound, and Bat-Mite) and gave the \"New Look\" Batman and Robin a more detective-oriented direction and sleeker draftsmanship that proved a hit combination.\n\nOther features and characters Infantino drew at DC include \"The Space Museum\", and Elongated Man. With Gardner Fox, Infantino co-created the Blockbuster in \"Detective Comics\" #345 (Nov. 1965) and Barbara Gordon as a new version of Batgirl in \"Detective Comics\" #359 (Jan. 1967). Writer Arnold Drake and Infantino created the supernatural superhero Deadman in \"Strange Adventures\" #205 (Oct. 1967). This story included the first known depiction of narcotics in a story approved by the Comics Code Authority.\n\nIn late 1966/early 1967, Infantino was tasked by Irwin Donenfeld with designing covers for the entire DC line. Stan Lee learned this and approached Infantino with a $22,000 offer to move to Marvel. Publisher Jack Liebowitz confirmed that DC could not match the offer, but could promote Infantino to the position of art director. Initially reluctant, Infantino accepted what Liebowitz posed as a challenge, and stayed with DC. When DC was sold to Kinney National Company, Infantino was promoted to editorial director. He started by hiring new talent, and promoting artists to editorial positions. He hired Dick Giordano away from Charlton Comics, and made artists Joe Orlando, Joe Kubert and Mike Sekowsky editors. New talents such as artist Neal Adams and writer Denny O'Neil were brought into the company. Several of DC's older characters were revamped by O'Neil including Wonder Woman; Batman; Green Lantern and Green Arrow; and Superman.\n\nIn 1970, Infantino signed on Marvel Comics' star artist and storytelling collaborator Jack Kirby to a DC Comics contract. Beginning with \"Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen\", Kirby created his Fourth World saga that wove through that existing title and three new series he created. After the \"Fourth World\" titles were canceled, Kirby created several other series for DC including \"OMAC\", \"Kamandi\", \"The Demon\", and, together with former partner Joe Simon for one last time, a new incarnation of the Sandman before returning to freelancing for Marvel in 1975.\n\nInfantino was made DC's publisher in early 1971, during a time of declining circulation for the company's comics, and he attempted a number of changes. In an effort to increase revenue, he raised the cover price of DC's comics from 15 to 25 cents, simultaneously raising the page-count by adding reprints and new backup features. Marvel met the price increase, then dropped back to 20 cents; DC stayed at 25 cents for about a year, a decision that ultimately proved bad for overall sales.\nInfantino and writer Len Wein co-created the \"Human Target\" feature in \"Action Comics\" #419 (December 1972). The character was adapted into a short-lived ABC television series starring Rick Springfield which debuted in July 1992.\n\nAfter consulting with screenwriter Mario Puzo on the plots of both \"Superman: The Movie\" and \"Superman II\", Infantino collaborated with Marvel on the historic company-crossover publication \"Superman vs. the Amazing Spider-Man\". In January 1976, Warner Communications replaced Infantino with magazine publisher Jenette Kahn, a person new to the comics field. Infantino returned to drawing freelance.\n\nInfantino later drew for a number of titles for Warren Publishing and Marvel, including the latter's \"Star Wars\", \"Spider-Woman\", and \"Nova\". His brief collaboration with Jim Shooter saw the introduction of Paladin in \"Daredevil\" #150 (Jan. 1978). During Infantino's tenure on the \"Star Wars\" series, it was one of the industry's top selling titles. In 1981, he returned to DC Comics and co-created a revival of the \"Dial H for Hero\" feature with writer Marv Wolfman in a special insert in \"Legion of Super-Heroes\" #272 (February 1981). He and writer Cary Bates crafted a Batman backup story for \"Detective Comics\" #500 (March 1981). Infantino returned to \"The Flash\" title with issue #296 (April 1981) and drew the series until its cancellation with issue #350 (October 1985). He drew \"The Flash\" #300 (Aug. 1981), which was in the Dollar Comics format, and was one of the artists on the double-sized \"Justice League of America\" #200 (March 1982), his chapter featuring both the Flash and the Elongated Man, characters he had co-created.\n\nHe was one of the contributors to the \"DC Challenge\" limited series in 1986. Other projects in the 1980s included penciling \"The Daring New Adventures of Supergirl\", a \"Red Tornado\" miniseries, and a comic book tie-in to the television series \"V\". In 1990, he followed Marshall Rogers as artist of the \"Batman\" newspaper comic strip and drew the strip until its cancellation the following year. During the 1990s Infantino also taught at the School of Visual Arts before retiring. Despite his retirement, Infantino made appearances at comic conventions in the early 21st century.\n\nIn 2004, he sued DC for rights to characters he alleged to have created while he was a freelancer for the company. These include several \"Flash\" characters including Wally West, Iris West, Captain Cold, Captain Boomerang, Mirror Master, and Gorilla Grodd, as well as the Elongated Man and Batgirl. The lawsuit was dismissed in September of that same year.\n\nOne of his final stories for the company appeared in \"DC Comics Presents: Batman\" #1 (Sept. 2004), a tribute to the then-recently deceased Julius Schwartz.\n\nArtist Nick Cardy commented on the popular but apocryphal anecdote, told by Julius Schwartz, about Infantino firing Cardy over not following a cover layout, only to rehire him moments later when Schwartz praised the errant cover art:\nInfantino wrote or contributed to two books about his life and career: \"The Amazing World of Carmine Infantino\" (Vanguard Productions, ), and \"Carmine Infantino: Penciler, Publisher, Provocateur\" (Tomorrows Publishing, ).\n\nInfantino was the uncle of Massachusetts musician Jim Infantino, of the band Jim's Big Ego. He contributed the cover art to the group's 2003 album \"They're Everywhere\", which features a song about the Flash called \"The Ballad of Barry Allen.\"\n\nInfantino died on April 4, 2013, at the age of 87 at his home in Manhattan.\n\nIn season three of The CW TV show \"The Flash\", episode 22 is titled \"Infantino Street\".\n\nInfantino's awards include:\n\n\n\n"}

He played college football for the University of Florida, and earned All-American honors. He was a first-round pick by the New York Giants in the 1997 NFL Draft, and also played professionally for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\nHilliard was born in Patterson, Louisiana in 1976. He attended Patterson High School, where he was a star high school football player for the Patterson Lumberjacks. During his senior year, he played quarterback, wingback, wide receiver and free safety. That year, he rushed for 737 yards and 12 touchdowns, caught 20 passes for 310 yards and two touchdowns, had 45 tackles and intercepted five passes. He was rated among the top 10 defensive backs in the Southeast, but he had his heart set on playing wide receiver.\n\nHilliard accepted an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, where he played wide receiver for coach Steve Spurrier's Florida Gators football team from 1994 to 1996. During his three seasons as a Gator, the team won three SEC Championships in 1994, 1995, and 1996. As a junior in 1996, he was paired with fellow Gators receiver Reidel Anthony and both posted 1,000-yard seasons, and both Hilliard and Anthony were recognized as first-team All-Southeastern Conference (SEC) selections and consensus first-team All-Americans, as the Gators won the Bowl Alliance national championship—their first-ever national football title. Hilliard's efforts made him a semi-finalist for the Fred Biletnikoff Award in 1996. The Gators finished the season with a record of 12–1 after a 52–20 victory over the top-ranked Florida State Seminoles in the 1997 Sugar Bowl. Hilliard had a sensational performance in the 1997 Sugar Bowl victory for Florida against their arch rival Florida State. His greatest play became known as the “STOP AND POP” as he snagged a Danny Wuerffel pass, took one hard step towards the end zone, then stopped on a dime as the Seminole defenders could only wave at him as he dashed the remaining 15 years to the end zone. It was the second of a Sugar Bowl-record three touchdowns for Hilliard and it gave the Gators a 24-10 advantage in what ended as a 52-20 Florida victory. Memorably, he set three Sugar Bowl Records against the Seminoles at the time: he had 150 receiving yards, including an 82-yard touchdown catch, and scored a total of three touchdowns for eighteen points.\n\nHilliard was among the members of the 11th Anniversary class inducted into the Florida-Georgia Hall of Fame. Hilliard's signature game against Georgia came in 1995, when he hauled in five passes for 99 yards and two touchdowns, as the Gators claimed a 52-17 victory over the Bulldogs. He was inducted into the University of Florida Athletic Hall of Fame as a \"Gator Great\" in 2009. \n\nHilliard was honored as an SEC Legend in 2011. He was chosen for The Florida Football All-Century Team, chosen by Gator fans, was compiled by The Gainesville Sun in the fall of 1999. Additionally, he was selected to The 100th-Anniversary Florida Team was selected in 2006 to celebrate a century of Florida football. Fans voted by mail and online.\n\n\n\n\nHilliard declared himself eligible for the NFL Draft after his junior season, and finished his college career with 126 receptions for 2,214 yards and twenty-nine touchdowns. In a 2006 series published by \"The Gainesville Sun\", he was recognized as No. 14 among the 100 all-time greatest Gator players from the first century of Florida football.\n\nThe New York Giants chose Hilliard in the first round (seventh pick overall) of the 1997 NFL Draft, and he played his first eight seasons for the Giants from to . He became a regular starter in , helping the Giants shut out the Minnesota Vikings 41-0 in the NFC Championship Game. The New York wide receiver had 10 receptions for 155 yards and two touchdowns to help his team reach Super Bowl XXXV following the regular season. A string of injuries kept him from the field throughout his time with the Giants. During the second game of his rookie year, Hilliard was hit by Jacksonville safety Chris Hudson and sustained a sprained interspinous ligament between his sixth and seventh vertebrae. He underwent posterior spine stabilization surgery which fused the two vertebrae. After an 8th-month rehabilitation period, Hilliard was named the Ed Block Courage Award recipient, voted for by their teammates as role models of inspiration, sportsmanship, and courage. He continued his level of play with disregard for his personal safety with a cringe-inducing medical record: bruised lungs and a bruised sternum in 2000; foot surgery before the 2001 season; a dislocated shoulder in 2002. He finished his career with the Giants with 368 receptions for 4,630 yards and twenty-seven touchdowns. After a distinguished career that includes ranking 6th in franchise history in receptions and 10th in receiving yards, on July 30, 2010, he signed a one-day contract to retire as a New York Giant.\n\nHilliard signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers after the 2004 season. During his first two seasons with Tampa Bay, he was used mainly as a third or fourth receiver, but in 2007 he started ten games making sixty-two receptions for 722 yards. During his time with the Bucs, he became a third down specialist, 111 of 178 career catches resulting in a 1st down. Head Coach Jon Gruden referred to him as \"Third and Ike\". On October 19, 2008, Hilliard refused to be carted off the field during a Sunday Night Football 20-10 win over the Seattle Seahawks after a helmet-to-helmet hit by Seattle linebacker Leroy Hill, who hit Hilliard in a head-on collision as Seahawks linebacker Lofa Tatupu hit him from behind, forcing his body to go limp after making a catch in the second quarter. \nAfter four seasons, Hilliard was released by the Buccaneers on February 25, 2009. He was one of five veterans that the Bucs released on that day. The others were wide receiver Joey Galloway, running back Warrick Dunn and linebackers Derrick Brooks and Cato June. The Bucs had previously fired Head Coach Jon Gruden and General Manager Bruce Allen and were looking to build a younger team under the likes of Raheem Morris and Mark Dominik. \n\nIn his twelve-season NFL career, Hilliard appeared in 161 regular season games, started 105 of them, and made 546 catches for 6,397 yards and thirty-five touchdowns. He also had 126 rushing yards on sixteen attempts.\n\nReceiving statistics \nReturning statistics\n\nForced to retire after a string of injuries, Hilliard became a volunteer receivers coach for the UFL's Florida Tuskers, a charter UFL franchise based in Orlando, Florida. In 2010, he became the Tuskers' new wide receivers coach for the season. He worked alongside Head Coach Jim Haslett and Offensive Coordinator Jay Gruden. The Tuskers appeared in the first two UFL Championship Games, losing both to the Las Vegas Locomotives. In 2010, the league suspended the Tuskers' operations and moved the remnants of the team to Virginia Beach to assume the identity (and some executive staff) of a previously announced expansion team that was to begin play in 2011..\n\nIn 2011, Hilliard returned to the NFL as an assistant wide receivers coach for the Miami Dolphins under Head Coach Tony Sparano. \n\nIn 2012, Hilliard was hired by Mike Shanahan of the Washington Redskins as the wide receivers coach. He oversaw a unit that had four wide receivers with at least 500 receiving yards or more (Santana Moss, Leonard Hankerson, Josh Morgan and Pierre Garçon). The Redskins ended the regular season with a 7-game winning streak to finish with a 10–6 record, leading to a NFC East division championship and a 4th seed spot in the playoffs. It was their first division title since 1999. \n\nIn 2013, the Buffalo Bills hired Hilliard as the wide receivers coach. Hilliard oversaw a young group of receivers that included veteran Steve Johnson and rookies Robert Woods and Marquise Goodwin.\n\nIn January 2014, Hilliard was reunited with Jay Gruden when the Head Coach named Hilliard the wide receivers coach of the Washington Redskins of the NFL. This would be his second stint with the Redskins reunited with a veteran unit that included Pierre Garçon, DeSean Jackson and Santana Moss. In the 2015 season, the Redskins made a return to the playoffs since their appearance in 2012. The Redskins would go on a 4-game winning streak to finish the season, and win the NFC East with a 9–7 record. However, the Redskins lost to the Green Bay Packers in the Wild Card round 35–18, ending their season. During the 2019 season, Hilliard helped to develop a group of rookie wide receivers which included Terry McLaurin, Kelvin Harmon and Steven Sims. McLaurin finished the season with 58 receptions for 919 yards and 7 touchdowns, and was named to the PFWA All-Rookie Team.\n\nHilliard joined the Pittsburgh Steelers to be their wide receivers coach in February 2020.\n\nHilliard is the nephew of former New Orleans Saints running back Dalton Hilliard. His cousin Kenny Hilliard is a former NFL Player. He is married to Lourdes, his wife of 18 years, and has five children.\n\n\n"}

It lies on State Highway 43, the \"Forgotten World Highway\", north-east of Stratford and south-west of Ohura. By rail it is from Stratford on the Stratford-Okahukura railway line.\n\nThe first settlers arrived in 1895, with the town proper established some 2 years later. Growth of the town was seriously affected by the loss of 51 men (including the smaller nearby settlements of Kohuratahi and Tahora) in the First World War and a major flood in 1924. The town recovered with arrival of the railway line in 1933 and electrification in 1959. However the town went into decline again and the school closed in 1979, followed 9 years later by the post office.\n\nIn 1989 regional council boundaries were redrawn, with an emphasis on connected catchments. These revised maps made Whangamomona part of the then-Manawatu-Wanganui Region. Residents objected, as they wanted to continue being part of the Taranaki Region, and on 1 November 1989, they responded by declaring themselves the \"Republic of Whangamomona\" at the first Republic Day. Though the move began as a pointed protest, the town continued to hold a celebratory Republic Day once a year, during which a vote for President was held. The day has become a local festival day, and attracts visitors from throughout the North Island. In 2001, the celebration became biennial, held in January to take advantage of the summer weather.\n\nIan Kjestrup (1989–1999)\nAfter being put on the ballot without his knowledge, Kjestrup became the first elected President, serving 10 years.\n\nBilly Gumboot the Goat (1999–2001)\nGumboot was the first elected animal. He won election by a landslide, although some residents speculate he ate the other challengers' ballots in order to win. He died in office after serving for 18 months.\n\nTai the Poodle (2003–2004)\nTai retired after he was attacked by a mastiff, but some speculate it was an assassination attempt. Though he survived the attack, Tai was left unfit for service and died in 2010.\n\nSir Murt \"Murtle the Turtle\" Kennard (2005–2015)\nThe local garage owner fought off strong competition from former President Kjestrup and a cross-dresser called \"Miriam\" to become the 4th President. He was re-elected in 2009 by one vote, and again by a landslide in 2011. Kennard died at New Plymouth Hospice on 25 October 2015.\n\nVicki Pratt (2015–2017)\nPratt was the first female President appointed for the Whangamomona Republic. The local publican was \"somehow picked while working in the kitchen\".\n\nJohn Herlihy (2017–present)\nHerlihy was elected ahead of Jack Spearow, Lili Jiao (who wanted to be a cat) and Ted (who was already a cat), despite reported attempts by Spearow to steal ballots. On Republic Day 2019 (19 January) President Herlihy was re-elected for a second term, having fought off challenges from Maketoni the Teddy Bear, Sherman the Cockatoo, Eunice the Sheep, Griff Robb (who proposed that the land-locked nation should enter into maritime tourism) and a Mrs Brown look-alike at the polls. Controversy surrounded the election due to the disappearance of candidate Eunice the Sheep, with commentators noting that mutton sandwiches were for sale at the Republic Day barbecue.\n\n"}

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the San Diego Padres, Minnesota Twins and New York Mets.\n\nStauffer graduated Saratoga Central Catholic High School in Saratoga Springs, New York and attended the University of Richmond through his junior year, where was twice named the Atlantic 10 Conference Pitcher of the Year. As a sophomore in 2002, Stauffer established Atlantic 10 records for wins (15) and strike-outs (140). He posted a 1.54 ERA and was named a first-team All-American. In 2003, Stauffer broke his own Atlantic 10 strike-out record with 146 and posted a 9-5 record with a 1.97 ERA and 10 complete games. He was again selected to the All-America Team.\n\nStauffer played for the Keene Swamp Bats of the New England Collegiate Baseball League in the summer of 2001, where he set an NECBL record with a 7-0 win/loss mark. In 2002, he played for the Chatham A's of the Cape Cod League, and is featured in the book \"The Last Best League: One Summer, One Season, One Dream\" by Jim Collins.\n\nStauffer was selected in the first round by the San Diego Padres as the fourth overall pick of the June 2003 draft. Stauffer had been bothered by shoulder soreness since the end of the college season, and an MRI in July showed weakness in the shoulder joint. He and his agent went to the Padres with this information during negotiations, and as a result he signed with the Padres for a bonus much less than a fourth overall pick would normally receive. The Padres scouting director Bill Gayton said about the disclosure, \"Their honesty and integrity is second to none. They didn't have to do that.\"\n\nStauffer rested his arm in 2003, and began 2004 with the Class A Advanced Lake Elsinore Storm. He was quickly promoted through Double-A and reached the Triple-A Portland Beavers in June, posting a 3.54 ERA in 14 starts with the club. He was being projected as a number 3 starter, soon to reach the major leagues.\n\nStauffer began the 2005 season in Triple-A. He made his Major League debut on May 11 against the Cincinnati Reds and earned his first win in a 6-inning, 2-run outing. He pitched to a 3-6 record with a 5.33 ERA with the Padres in 2005, and was returned to Triple-A after a July 31 relief appearance.\n\nStauffer spent most of 2006 and 2007 with Triple-A Portland. He was called up to the Padres for a single appearance on August 21, 2006, in order to temporarily fill a spot in a pitching rotation hampered by injuries. His third and fourth call-ups came on July 29, 2007 and August 26, 2007, where he again made spot starts before being sent back to Triple-A. He posted a 15-17 record and 4.98 ERA in 46 starts over his 2006 and 2007 Triple-A seasons.\n\nAfter the 2007 season, Stauffer elected to have surgery to repair a tear in the labrum of his right shoulder. The surgery and rehab cost him the entire 2008 season, and Stauffer began 2009 with the Double-A San Antonio Missions after a month of extended spring training to build arm strength.\n\nStauffer was called back up to the big leagues on July 11, 2009. He made 14 starts for the Padres in the second half, posting a 4-7 record and 3.58 ERA.\n\nIn 2010, Stauffer started the season working out of the Padres bullpen and posted a 0.49 ERA in 9 appearances. He got his first opportunity to start on May 9, taking the place of Kevin Correia, but Stauffer required an emergency appendectomy on May 11, sidelining him for nearly two months. When he rejoined the club, he worked out of the bullpen until September when he made six more starts. Stauffer finished the season with a 6-5 record and 1.85 ERA, with 61 strike-outs and 24 walks in 82 innings pitched.\n\nStauffer was the Padres Opening Day pitcher in 2011 and was a mainstay of the rotation. He started 31 games and finished the season with a 9-12 record and 3.73 ERA, with 128 strike-outs versus 58 walks over 185 innings.\n\nIn early 2012, Stauffer and the Padres agreed on a one-year $3.2 million contract to avoid arbitration. Stauffer was again the planned Opening Day starter, but he suffered an elbow strain in spring training and went on the disabled list. He only made a single start in May before going back on the DL. In August, he had surgery on the flexor tendon in his right elbow. After the season, the Padres did not tender an offer to Stauffer, and he elected for free agency after clearing waivers.\n\nOn January 29, 2013, Stauffer re-signed with the Padres on a minor league deal. After going 2-2 with a 3.16 ERA in Triple A, Stauffer's contract was selected, and he was called up to the Majors on May 17, 2013. Stauffer settled into a long relief role with the Padres bullpen, pitching multiple innings in 22 of his 43 relief appearances. He finished the 2013 season with a 3-1 record and 3.75 ERA, recording 64 strike-outs in 69 innings.\n\nStauffer signed a new one-year, $1.6 million deal with San Diego on December 2, 2013, avoiding arbitration. Stauffer again primarily worked out of the pen as long reliever, making three starts in late May and early June after Robbie Erlin went to the disabled list. He finished the 2014 season with an overall 3.50 ERA, and a 2.56 ERA as a reliever, striking out 67 in 64 innings.\n\nStauffer signed a one-year $2.2 million contract with the Minnesota Twins on December 23, 2014. On May 1, Stauffer landed on the disabled list with a strained right intercostal muscle. He was designated for assignment on June 11, 2015 and released on June 17.\n\nAfter being released by the Twins, Stauffer signed with the Sugar Land Skeeters of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball.\n\nOn July 31, 2015 Stauffer signed a minor league contract with the New York Mets. Stauffer pitched for the Las Vegas 51s of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League, and was promoted to the major leagues on September 8. Stauffer was designated for assignment by the Mets on October 12, 2015, thus making him a free agent to make room for Matt Reynolds on the 40-man roster. Stauffer had a 7.94 ERA in five appearances for the Mets.\n\nOn December 23, 2015, Stauffer agreed to a minor league deal with the Arizona Diamondbacks. He was released on March 28, 2016.\n"}

{"id": "1875355", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1875355", "title": "Lymphocytic choriomeningitis", "text": "Lymphocytic choriomeningitis\n\nLymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) is a rodent-borne viral infectious disease that presents as aseptic meningitis, encephalitis or meningoencephalitis. Its causative agent is \"lymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus\" (LCMV), a member of the family \"Arenaviridae\". The name was coined by Charles Armstrong in 1934.\n\nLymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) is \"a viral infection of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord and of the cerebrospinal fluid\". The name is based on the tendency of an individual to have abnormally high levels of lymphocytes during infection. Choriomeningitis is \"cerebral meningitis in which there is marked cellular infiltration of the meninges, often with a lymphocytic infiltration of the choroid plexuses\".\nLCMV infection manifests itself in a wide range of clinical symptoms, and may even be asymptomatic for immunocompetent individuals. Onset typically occurs between one or two weeks after exposure to the virus and is followed by a biphasic febrile illness. During the initial or prodromal phase, which may last up to a week, common symptoms include fever, lack of appetite, headache, muscle aches, malaise, nausea, and/or vomiting. Less frequent symptoms include a sore throat and cough, as well as joint, chest, and parotid pain. The onset of the second phase occurs several days after recovery, and consists of symptoms of meningitis or encephalitis. Pathological findings during the first stage consist of leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. During the second phase, typical findings include elevated protein levels, increased leukocyte count, or a decrease in glucose levels of the cerebrospinal fluid).\n\nOccasionally, a patient improves for a few days, then relapses with aseptic meningitis, or very rarely, meningoencephalitis.\nPatients with meningitis may have a stiff neck, fever, headache, myalgia, nausea and malaise. In some occasions, meningitis occurs without a prodromal syndrome. Meningoencephalitis is characterized by more profound neurological signs such as confusion, drowsiness, sensory abnormalities and motor signs. Under reported complications include myelitis, Guillain–Barré-type syndrome, cranial nerve palsies, transient or permanent hydrocephalus, sensorineural hearing loss, orchitis, arthritis and parotitis. LCMV infections have also been associated with pancreatitis, pneumonitis, myocarditis and pericarditis. The entire illness usually lasts 1 to 3 weeks, nonetheless, temporary or permanent neurological damage is possible in all central nervous system infections, especially in cases of meningoencephalitis. Chronic infections have not been reported in humans and deaths rarely occur.\n\nThere are several strains of LCM virus, among which the most widely used are LCMV Armstrong and LCMV Clone 13. Armstrong is the original virus strain which was isolated from the brain by Charles Armstrong in 1934. It triggers a vigorous cytotoxic T lymphocytes(CTL) response and thus, it is cleared rapidly by the host. This is referred to as acute (Armstrong) LCMV infection. On the other hand, Clone 13 is a variant of the Armstrong viral strain, isolated from the spleen and is consequently tropic for visceral organs. It was first isolated from mice which sustained a persistent LCMV infection from birth. This variant potentiates a less vigorous CTL response in the immune system, and thus can ultimately persist in the host organism indefinitely. The latter is referred to as chronic (Clone 13) LCMV infection.\n\nLCMV is a spherical enveloped virus with a diameter between 60 and 300 nm. The helical nucleocapsid contains an RNA genome consisting of two negative single-stranded RNA segments. The negative RNA strand, complementary to the necessary mRNA strand, indicates that it must first be transcribed into a positive mRNA strand before it can be translated into the required proteins. The L strand is ambisense RNA, encoding multiple proteins in opposite directions, separated by an intergenic region. It is approximately 7.2 kb in size and encodes a high-molecular-mass protein (L; 200 kDa) and an 11 kDa small polypeptide Z with unknown function and a ring finger motif. The viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase is encoded by the L protein which contains conserved characteristic motifs throughout all the RNA-dependent, RNA-polymerases. The S strand is ambisense and approximately 3.4 kb in size. It encodes the two main structural proteins: nucleo-protein (63 kDa) and glycoprotein C (75kDa). The latter undergoes posttranslational cleavage and results in the synthesis of two mature virion glycoproteins, GP-1 (40 to 46 kDa) and GP-2 (35 kDa). The spikes present on the virion envelope are dictated by tetramer formation of GP-1 and GP-2.\n\nWhen LCMV attacks a cell, the process of replication starts by attachment of the virus to host receptors through its surface glycoproteins. It is then endocytosed into a vesicle inside the host cell and creates a fusion of the virus and vesicle membranes. The ribonucleocapsid is then released in the cytoplasm. The RNA-dependent, RNA-polymerase brought along with the virus initially binds to a promoter on the L and S segments and begins transcription from negative-stranded to a positive-stranded mRNA. The formation of a strong hairpin sequence at the end of each gene terminates transcription. The mRNA strands are capped by the RNA-dependent, RNA-polymerase in the cytoplasm and are then subsequently translated into the four proteins essential for LCMV assembly. The ribonucleocapsid interacts with the Z matrix protein and buds on the cell membrane, releasing the virion out from the infected cell.\n\nThe first arenavirus, \"Lymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus\" (LCMV), was isolated in 1933 by Charles Armstrong during a study of an epidemic in St. Louis. Although not the cause of the outbreak, LCMV was found to be a cause of nonbacterial or aseptic meningitis.\n\nIn 1996, Peter Doherty and Rolf Zinkernagel shared the Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology, for their work with LCMV which led to a fundamental understanding of the adaptive immune response, MHC restriction. In the 1970s, studies concerning the importance of MHC locus were done exclusively in transplantation and tumor rejection. Taking this into consideration, Doherty and Zinkernagel were working on the response of mice to virus infections. They observed that T-cell receptors must recognise a complex of foreign antigen and an MHC antigen in order to destroy infected cells. Their key experiment involved harvesting of splenocytes containing LCMV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes(CTL) from an infected mouse strain A. These were then mixed \"in vitro\" with virus infected fibroblasts or macrophages from two different mouse strains, A and B. By the method of Cr-release cytotoxicity assay, thereby tagging the CTL with chromium-51 (Cr-51), the CTL destruction of infected cells was quantified by release of Cr-51. The results showed that CTL killed only the infected cells from strain A, and they did not lyse uninfected cells or infected cells from strain B. They concluded that these virus specific CTLs only lyse cells carrying the same molecules of the major histocompatibility site (MHC) as the CTLs themselves. Thus, the virus-specific CTLs are \"MHC-restricted\". This discovery lead to a greater understanding of an important aspect of the immune system.\n\nLCMV is naturally spread by the common house mouse, \"Mus musculus\". Once infected, these mice can become chronically infected by maintaining virus in their blood or persistently shedding virus in their urine.\nChronically infected female mice usually transmit infection to their offspring (vertical transmission), which in turn become chronically infected. Other modes of mouse-to-mouse transmission include nasal secretions, milk from infected dams, bites, and during social grooming within mouse communities. Airborne transmission also occurs.\n\nThe virus seems to be relatively resistant to drying and therefore humans can become infected by inhaling infectious aerosolized particles of rodent urine, feces, or saliva, by ingesting food contaminated with virus, by contamination of mucous membranes with infected body fluids, or by directly exposing cuts or other open wounds to virus-infected blood. The only documented cases of transmission from animals have occurred between humans and mice or hamsters.\n\nCases of lymphocytic choriomeningitis have been reported in North and South America, Europe, Australia, and Japan, particularly during the 1900s. However, infection may occur wherever an infected rodent host population exists. LCMV occurs worldwide and its natural host, the rodent, has become established on all continents, except Antarctica.\n\nSeroprevalence is approximately 5% (0.7–4.7%) of the US population. It tends to be more common among lower socio-economic groupings, probably reflecting more frequent and direct contacts with mice. However, obtaining an accurate sense of prevalence by geographic region is difficult due to underreporting.\n\nLymphocytic choriomeningitis is a particular concern in obstetrics, as vertical transmission is known to occur. For immunocompetent mothers, there is no significant threat, but the virus has damaging effects upon the fetus. If infection occurs during the first trimester, LCMV results in an increased risk of spontaneous abortion. Later congenital infection may lead to malformations such as intracranial calcifications, hydrocephalus, microcephaly or macrocephaly, intellectual disabilities, and seizures. Other findings include chorioretinal scars, and optic atrophy. Chorioretinitis, which is followed by chorioretinal scarring, is the most common ocular lesion. Mortality among infants is approximately 30%. Among the survivors, two thirds have lasting neurologic abnormalities.\n\nOther ocular defects including optic atrophy, microphthalmia, vitreitis, leukokoria and cataracts can also be seen. Most of the infants in one case series were of normal birth weight, although 30% were underweight. Aspiration pneumonia can be a fatal complication. Infants who survive may have severe neurological defects including epilepsy, impaired coordination, visual loss or blindness, spastic diplegia or quadriparesis/quadriplegia, delayed development and intellectual disability. Less severe cases with isolated cerebellar hypoplasia and symptoms of ataxia and jitteriness have been reported occasionally. There have also been rare cases with evidence of chorioretinitis but without neurological signs. Systemic signs seem to be rare, but hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia and hyperbilirubinemia have been documented in a few cases, and skin blisters were reported in one infant.\n\nIf a woman has come into contact with a rodent during pregnancy and LCM symptoms are manifested, a blood test is available to determine previous or current infection. A history of infection does not pose a risk for future pregnancies.\n\nPatients infected in solid organ transplants have developed a severe fatal illness, starting within weeks of the transplant. In all reported cases, the initial symptoms included fever, lethargy, anorexia and leukopenia, and quickly progressed to multisystem organ failure, hepatic insufficiency or severe hepatitis, dysfunction of the transplanted organ, coagulopathy, hypoxia, multiple bacteremias and shock. Localized rash and diarrhea were also seen in some patients. Nearly all cases have been fatal.\n\nIn May 2005, four solid-organ transplant recipients contracted an illness that was later diagnosed as lymphocytic choriomeningitis. All received organs from a common donor, and within a month of transplantation, three of the four recipients had died as a result of the viral infection. Epidemiologic investigation traced the source to a pet hamster that the organ donor had recently purchased from a Rhode Island pet store. Similar cases occurred in Massachusetts in 2008, and Australia in 2013. There is not a LCMV infection test that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for organ donor screening. The \"Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report\" advises health-care providers to \"consider LCMV infection in patients with aseptic meningitis and encephalitis and in organ transplant recipients with unexplained fever, hepatitis, or multisystem organ failure.\"\n\nCurrent or previous infection can be detected through a blood test. However, some authors note that such complement-fixation tests are insensitive and should not be used for diagnosis. Dr. Clare A. Dykewicz, \"et al.\" state,\n\nClinical diagnosis of LCM can be made by the history of prodrome symptoms and by considering the period of time before the onset of meningitis symptoms, typically 15–21 days for LCM.\n\nPathological diagnosis of congenital infection is performed using either an immunofluorescent antibody (IFA) test or an enzyme immunoassay to detect specific antibody in blood or cerebrospinal fluid. A PCR assay has been recently developed which may be used in the future for prenatal diagnosis; however, the virus is not always present in the blood or CSF when the affected child is born.\" Diagnoses is subject to methodological shortcomings in regard to specificity and sensitivity of assays used. For this reason, LCMV may be more common than is realized.\n\nAnother detection assay is the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests which may detect nucleic acids in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid.(CSF) Virus isolation is not used for diagnosis in most cases but it can be isolated from the blood or nasopharyngeal fluid early in the course of the disease, or from CSF in patients with meningitis. LCMV can be grown in a variety of cell lines including BHK21, L and Vero cells, and it may be identified with immuno-fluorescence. A diagnosis can also be made by the intracerebral inoculation of blood or CSF into mice.\n\nLCMV is susceptible to most detergents and disinfectants including 1% sodium hypochlorite, 70%\nethanol, 2% glutaraldehyde and formaldehyde. The effectiveness of infection quickly declines below pH 5.5 and above pH 8.5. In addition, LCMV can also be inactivated by heat, ultraviolet light or gamma irradiation.\n\nStudies have indicated that human infection of the virus occurs primarily during the fall and winter months, presumably due to the movement of mice indoors. Several measures can be taken to prevent exposure to LCM from wild rodents in the home. A checklist of precautions is provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, providing tips for sealing the home to keep rodents out, using traps to eliminate existing rodents, and maintaining a clean, healthy home. New technology reflects a growing trend for more humane means of eliminating rodents. Products include devices that emit ultrasonic sound that allegedly irritates mice and drives them away, and more swift, painless means of death such as mini electrocution or gas chambers. However, the traditional snap trap remains an economic and popular option.\n\nTreatment is symptomatic and supportive. Children with hydrocephalus often need a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. Nucleoside analog ribavirin is used in some cases due to the inhibitory effect the agent has \"in vitro\" on arenaviruses. However, there is not sufficient evidence for efficacy in humans to support routine use. The only survivor of a transplant-associated LCMV infection was treated with ribavirin and simultaneous tapering of the immunosuppressive medications. Early and intravenous ribavirin treatment is required for maximal efficacy, and it can produce considerable side effects. Ribavirin has not been evaluated yet in controlled clinical trials.\n\nUse of ribavirin during pregnancy is generally not recommended, as some studies indicate the possibility of teratogenic effects. If aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, or meningoencephalitis develops in consequence to LCMV, hospitalization and supportive treatment may be required. In some circumstances, anti-inflammatory drugs may also be considered. In general, mortality is less than one percent.\n\nLymphocytic choriomeningitis is not a commonly reported infection in humans, though most infections are mild and are often never diagnosed. Serological surveys suggest that approximately 1–5% of the population in the U.S. and Europe has antibodies to LCMV. The prevalence varies with the living conditions and exposure to mice, and it has been higher in the past due to lower standards of living. The island of Vir in Croatia is one of the biggest described endemic places of origin of LCMV in the world, with IFA testing having found LCMV antibodies in 36% of the population. Individuals with the highest risk of infection are laboratory personnel who handle rodents or infected cells. Temperature and time of year is also a critical factor that contributes to the number of LCMV infections, particularly during fall and winter when mice tend to move indoors. Approximately 10–20% of the cases in immunocompetent individuals are thought to progress to neurological disease, mainly as aseptic meningitis. The overall case fatality rate is less than 1% and people with complications, including meningitis, almost always recover completely. Rare cases of meningoencephalitis have also been reported. More severe disease is likely to occur in people who are immunosuppressed.\n\nMore than 50 infants with congenital LCMV infection have been reported worldwide. The probability that a woman will become infected after being exposed to rodents, the frequency with which LCMV crosses the placenta, and the likelihood of clinical signs among these infants are still poorly understood. In one study, antibodies to LCMV were detected in 0.8% of normal infants, 2.7% of infants with neurological signs and 30% of infants with hydrocephalus. In Argentina, no congenital LCMV infections were reported among 288 healthy mothers and their infants. However, one study found that two of 95 children in a home for people with severe mental disabilities had been infected with this virus. The prognosis for severely affected infants appears to be poor. In one series, 35% of infants diagnosed with congenital infections had died by the age of 21 months.\n\nTransplant-acquired lymphocytic choriomeningitis proves to have a very high morbidity and mortality rate. In the three clusters reported in the U.S. from 2005 to 2010, nine of the ten infected recipients died. One donor had been infected from a recently acquired pet hamster while the sources of the virus in the other cases were unknown.\n\nLCMV has been isolated from fleas, ticks, cockroaches and Culicoides and Aedes mosquitoes. Ticks, lice and mosquitoes have been shown to transmit this virus mechanically in the laboratory. The presence of LCMV in laboratories may cause serious long-term repercussions to worker safety. In 1989, an outbreak among humans occurred in a US cancer research institute that studied the effects of various therapeutic and diagnostic agents in animal models. Such agents had been developed in the animal care facility, which periodically screened sentinel animals for extraneous infection. Due to an oversight, no sentinel animals were monitored from August 1988 to March 1989. When testing resumed, LCMV antibodies were found in the oldest sentinel hamsters. Several workers reported symptoms consistent with LCMV infection, leading to an investigation. Blood samples were obtained and tested for LCMV antibodies. Of the 82 workers that were tested, seven had definite serologic evidence of past LCMV infection, and two were hospitalized for an acute febrile illness. All seven reported direct contact with the animals at the institute.\n\nAn additional hazard associated with LCMV in laboratories misleading experimental results. Interference with research may involve:\n\nReported outbreaks have decreased, perhaps due to improved biohazard management in laboratories. However, it is possible that sporadic cases have been overlooked because of the wide range of clinical presentations. Clare A. Dykewicz, \"et al.\" recommend vigilant screening laboratory animals to be used in research facilities either through serum samples or cell line aliquots, as well as ensuring adequate ventilation in housing areas and use of appropriate sanitation products. Other practices to reduce cross-contamination in rodents include washing hands or changing gloves between animal care activities, thoroughly decontaminating cages before reusing them, and avoiding housing healthy rodents in the vicinity of potentially infected rodents.\n\nAlthough the house mouse (\"Mus musculus\") is the primary reservoir host for LCMV, it is also often found in the wood mouse (\"Apodemus sylvaticus\") and the yellow-necked mouse (\"Apodemus flavicollis\"). Hamster populations can act as reservoir hosts. Other rodents including guinea pigs, rats and chinchillas can be infected but do not appear to maintain the virus. LCMV has been shown to cause illness in New World primates such as macaques, marmosets and tamarins. Infections have also been reported in rabbits, dogs and pigs. After experimental inoculation, the incubation period in adult mice is 5 to 6 days. Congenitally or neonatally infected mice and hamsters do not become symptomatic for several months or longer.\n\nA study conducted by John Hotchin and Heribert Weigand, of the New York State Department of Health, concluded, \"The age of the mouse when first exposed to the virus determines its immune response.\" If LCMV infection occurs \"in utero\" or within the first few hours of life, during the immunologically unresponsive period, the mouse will develop immune tolerance. The virus will continue to proliferate for an indefinite time. However, if a mouse is infected after the neonatal period, when the immune system is responsive, the immune response is active. This immunological conflict can result in one of three ways; immunological paralysis, significant or complete suppression of virus with immunity to reinfection, or death. Mice that are infected after the neonatal period often pass through a \"runt\" stage, which may last for several weeks. Clinical symptoms include excitability, weight loss, and severe retardation of growth and hair development. In general, as the period of time between birth and inoculation decreases, less disease and mortality occurs.\n\nPost mortem lesions in mice show signs of hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, lymphaden\nopathy, and swollen or shrunken and pitted kidneys due to glomerulonephritis. Histological findings in persistently infected mice often show chronic glomerulonephritis. In these mice, and some hamsters, vasculitis and lymphocytic infiltrates in many organs and tissues including the liver, spleen, lung, kidneys, pancreas, blood vessels, meninges and brain are present.\n\nPathogenesis occurs in the same manner in hamsters as in mice. Symptoms in hamsters are highly variable, and typically indicate that the pet has been infected and shedding the virus for several months. Early signs may include inactivity, loss of appetite, and a rough coat. As the disease progresses, the animal may experience weight loss, hunched posture, inflammation around the eyes, and eventually death. Alternatively, some infected hamsters may be asymptomatic.\n\nExperimental intracerebral infection of suckling rats results in microcephaly, retinitis and the destruction of several brain regions, leading to permanent abnormalities of movement, coordination, vision and behavior.\n\nLCMV causes callitrichid hepatitis in New World primates. The onset of the infection is nonspecific and may include fever, anorexia, dyspnea, weakness and lethargy. Jaundice is characteristic and petechial hemorrhages may develop. Prostration and death usually follow.\n\nNecropsy lesions in primates with callitrichid hepatitis show signs of jaundice, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and subcutaneous and intramuscular hemorrhages. Pleural and pericardial effusion, sometimes sanguineous, has also been reported. On histology, multifocal necrosis with acidophilic bodies and mild inflammatory infiltrates are typically found in the liver.\n\nAs in humans, the sensitivity of testing methods for rodents contributes to the accuracy of diagnosis. LCMV is typically identified through serology. However, in an endemically infected colony, more practical methods include MAP (mouse antibody production) and PCR testing. Another means of diagnosis is introducing a known naïve adult mouse to the suspect rodent colony. The introduced mouse will seroconvert, allowing use of immunofluorescence antibody (IFA), MFIA or ELISA to detect antibodies.\n\nImmunosuppressive therapy has been effective in halting the disease for laboratory animals.\n\nLCMV infections are focal Estimates of its prevalence in wild mouse populations range from 0% to 60%, with an average prevalence of 9%. The incidence of LCMV in pet rodents is unknown, yet very few human cases have been associated with exposure to pets. In the transplant-associated cases linked to a pet hamster in 2005, two other hamsters and a guinea pig at the pet shop, and approximately 4% of the hamsters at the distributor, were also infected. Morbidity and mortality rates vary with the species of animal and its age at infection, as well as the strain of the virus and route of exposure. Neonatally and congenitally infected mice remain asymptomatic for many months, but the onset of glomerulonephritis reduces overall life expectancy. The morbidity rate in naturally infected post-neonatal mice is unknown; however, subclinical disease may be the most common form, as few natural outbreaks have been reported. In hamsters, approximately half of all congenitally infected animals clear the virus when they are approximately three months old and remain healthy; the remaining animals develop chronic disease. Hamsters infected as adults usually remain asymptomatic. Callitrichid hepatitis is reported to be highly fatal in naturally infected marmosets and tamarins in zoos. Since 1980, 12 outbreaks with 57 deaths have been reported in the U.S. In experimentally infected rhesusmacaques, three of four animals became fatally ill when inoculation was by the intravenous route. In contrast, inoculation by the intragastric route usually led to asymptomatic infections, with occasional disease and few deaths.\n\nPet rodents are not known to be natural reservoirs for lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. However, pets can become vectors if they are exposed to wild house mice in a breeding facility, pet store, or home. Such infections are rare. To date, documented infections in humans have occurred only after introduction to infected mice, guinea pigs, and hamsters, with the majority of cases transmitted by mice. LCMV infection in other animals, including zoo animals, may be possible.\n\nIn choosing a pet, the CDC advises looking for general indications of health both in the prospective pet and others in the facility. The rodent of choice should be lively and alert, have a glossy coat, breathe normally and have no discharge from eyes or nose. If one of the animals in the facility looks ill, the others may have been exposed, and none of the rodents at that location should be purchased.\n\nSerologic testing is not recommended for pet rodents, as it has been unreliable in detecting antibodies in animals with active infections. For laboratory purposes, immunohistochemistry staining of tissues and virus isolation are used for more accurate testing, but this is unnecessary for the general house pet. The greatest risk of infection to humans occurs shortly after purchase of a pet, so that exposure to the virus, if present, has likely already occurred to existing pet owners. Continued ownership poses negligible additional risk.\n\nThe National Center for Infectious Disease suggests the following precautions to reduce the risk of LCMV infection:\n\nRodent owners who no longer wish to keep their pet should consult a veterinarian. Pets should not be released into the wild for humane, legal, and ecological reasons. After a rodent has been purchased, it should not be returned to the pet store as it may have been exposed to LCMV through house mice.\n\nLCM is the archetypal arenavirus, and was instrumental in research which uncovered the major pathogenetic mechanisms of all arenaviruses.\n\nThe field of viral immunology will continue to be uncovered by the model system of LCMV. Specifically, the study of persistent viral infections as well as vaccine development, represent two essential areas. LCMV is already identified as the best model to examine the difference between acute and viral infection in its natural host \"Mus musculus\", the common house mouse. Conveniently, the mouse is also the most widely used genetic model for mammalian genetics. A major phenotypic difference results from only two nucleotide differences between acute LCMV, also known as Armstrong LCMV, and one of its variant, Clone 13, which leads to persistent LCMV infection. One of the nucleotide mutations is in the process of glycoprotein formation and affects tropism. The second base pair mutation affects the polymerase which influences replicative capacity. The mechanism of these mutations and how they confer such a profound physiological difference, acute versus chronic LCMV infection is yet to be understood.\n\nAn important aspect of the present modern society is the thorough understanding of the burden of cancer. In many ways, this disease mirrors persistent viral infection, in the way that it evades and progresses despite the immune system's effort to eliminate it. The LCMV model will be a great path towards advancements in cancer studies. Furthermore, LCMV has been a widely used model system for understanding T cell memory and vaccine synthesis. It was the original model when first studied focused on CD-8 T cells response towards LCMV infection. In addition, a better understanding of CD-4 T cell memory is also a result of studies with LCMV and will continue to contribute to a more efficient mechanism of vaccine formation. Specifically, LCMV has been recently used to quantify the efficiency of a new hydrogen peroxide-based vaccine formation mechanism. The future enhancement of the field of vaccinology will greatly depend on the LCMV model system.\n\nLCMV is a prototype of more severe hemorrhagic fever viruses, especially Lassa virus with the greatest prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa. However, other strains of this virus ( Junin and Machupo viruses) are present in parts of South America and other strains continue to significantly affect the southern African population. Since the modern society continue to become a more inter-connected world, the spread of these virus strains will continue to pose a severe threat around the globe. Understanding the biology of the LCMV model virus will help in advancing the understanding of this important class of viruses and more specifically will give insight into the biology of the Lassa virus which proves to be a growing threat around the world. Furthermore, the United States National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has appointed the family of arenaviridae to be \"Category A Priority Pathogens\". This translates to the highest level of importance for the high potential for morbidity and mortality from an infectious agent which is relatively easy to produce and transmit. All in all, the fast advancements in the potential experiments with the LCMV model system will guide future investigators towards the enrichment of biomedical research.\n\n\n"}

It is a Canadian company based in Toronto that focuses on integrated communications as a provider of data, e-business and voice services to business and households. It used to be known as Sprint Canada Inc., pursuant to a 1993 branding agreement between parent Call-Net Enterprises Inc. with what is now Sprint Nextel Corporation.\n\nIn 1998, Call-Net acquired long-distance service and data-circuit provider Fonorola of Montreal for about $1.8 billion and merged it into Sprint Canada.\n\nOn May 11, 2005, Rogers Communications Inc. and Call-Net jointly announced that they entered into an agreement under which RCI would acquire 100% of Call-Net under a plan of arrangement (). The deal was approved by shareholders and an Ontario court on June 30, 2005, and completed July 1. The deal allowed Rogers to enter the residential phone business to challenge Bell Canada.\n\nOn July 7, 2005, Sprint Canada Inc. became Rogers Telecom Inc. and Call-Net Enterprises Inc. became Rogers Telecom Holdings Inc.\n\nSprint Canada was launched in the early 1990s with Candice Bergen as its spokesperson. Bergen also was pitching the products of their U.S. sister company. CallNet licensed the name Sprint from the United States Sprint Corporation up until it was bought out and renamed by Rogers Communications.\n\nThe Rogers Home Phone service in Canada was launched on July 1, 2005, on the same day that Rogers Telecom was acquired by Rogers Communications Inc. The current offering is VoIP technology using Rogers's Internet cable. A special converter offers home-phone service with traditional RJ11 telephone-line jacks within the house. The VoIP service is currently available in regions served by Rogers Hi-Speed Internet.\n\nThis service operates using the PacketCable technology over the company's cable network. Service is delivered by cable to the subscriber's residence and is connected into a home-phone terminal, which then provides the connection to the internal wiring at the address. The home-phone terminal has a six-hour backup and can support up to two different phone numbers.\n\nThe landline service, which was available from mid-2005 to mid-2010, operated switches co-located in the Bell Canada network. As such, Rogers did not maintain the phone lines and was affected by the Bell Subco strike of 2005, which impaired its ability to provide timely service. The same also applied to the Telus strike in Alberta and British Columbia. During the time of the local strikes, Rogers Telecom was not able to provide exact installation dates in those two provinces. Due to legal obligations, however, Rogers's customers received higher-priority service during strikes than actual Bell Canada or Telus customers.\n\nRogers wanted to discontinue its traditional voice services by the end of 2008. For this reason, Rogers's customers with this service were sent a notice in June 2008. They could either switch to Rogers's VoIP home phone or have their accounts automatically cancelled. However, Rogers did not take these steps until August 2010, when Rogers partnered with Primus Canada. The latter company now manages all traditional home-phone accounts formerly served by Rogers.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1875369", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1875369", "title": "German Sign Language", "text": "German Sign Language\n\nGerman Sign Language or Deutsche Gebärdensprache (DGS), is the sign language of the deaf community in Germany and in the German-speaking community of Belgium. It is unclear how many use German Sign Language as their main language; Gallaudet University estimated 50,000 as of 1986.\nThe language has evolved through use in deaf communities over hundreds of years.\n\nGermany has a strong oralist tradition and historically has seen a suppression of sign language. German Sign Language was first legally recognised in \"The Federal Disability Equality Act (2002)\" in May 2002. Since then, deaf people have a legal entitlement to Sign Language interpreters when communicating with federal authorities, free of charge.\n\nVery few television programs include an interpreter; those that do are the news and a news \"round-up\". There is at least one programme conducted entirely in German Sign Language called \"Sehen statt Hören\" (Seeing Instead of Hearing), a documentary-style programme produced by the Bayerischer Rundfunk (BR) and broadcast on Saturday mornings on Bayerischer Rundfunk and the other regional state broadcasters in Germany.\n\nGerman Sign Language is unrelated to spoken German. While spoken German builds sentences following a \"subject – verb – object\" pattern, German Sign Language uses a \"subject object verb\" strategy. Thus, the two have very different grammars, though as the dominant language of the region, German has had some influence on German Sign Language. A signed system that follows German grammar, Signed German (\"Lautsprachbegleitende Gebärden\" or \"Lautbegleitende Gebärden\", \"sound-accompanying signs\"), is used in education. It is not used as a natural means of communication between deaf people. Another system of manually representing German is cued speech, known as \"Phonembestimmes Manualsystem\" (Phonemic Manual System).\n\nGerman Sign Language uses a one-handed manual alphabet ('Fingeralphabet' in German) derived from the French manual alphabet of the 18th century; it is related to manual alphabets used across Europe and in North America.\n\nRegional variants of German Sign Language include Hamburg, Berlin, and Munich sign. Sign languages of regions in the former East Germany have a greater divergence from sign languages of the western regions; some may be unrelated. Polish Sign Language is descended from German Sign Language. Israeli Sign Language may be as well, as it evolved from the sign language used by German Jewish teachers who opened a school for deaf children in Jerusalem in 1932, and still shows some resemblance to its German counterpart. It is not related to Austrian Sign Language, which is used in parts of southern Germany, nor to Swiss Sign Language, both of which are part of the French Sign Language family, though they have had some influence from German Sign Language.\n\nEveryday users of German Sign Language use no written form of the language. In academic contexts, German Sign Language is usually described with the Hamburg notation system or HamNoSys. SignWriting also has its adherents in Germany.\n\nThe grammar of German Sign Language may be described in terms of the conventional linguistic categories phonology, morphology, morphosyntax and syntax.\n\nSigns are made up of a combination of different elements from each of the classes of distinctive features: handshape, hand orientation, location and movement. If one of these elements is changed, it can result in a sign with a completely different meaning. Two signs differing in only one element are deemed to be a minimal pair. German Sign Language uses 32 handshapes, of which six are basic handshapes found in all sign languages.\n\nTwo-handed signs are signs which are necessarily performed with both hands. Their formation is in accordance with certain phonotactic limitations, such as the rule of symmetry (when both hands move at the same time, they have the same handshape) and the rule of dominance (if the two hands have different handshapes, only the dominant hand is moved while the non-dominant hand remains passive).\n\nUninflected lexical signs in German Sign Language have at most two syllables. Syllables consist of two syllabic positions, described as \"Hold\" (H) and \"Movement\" (M). \"Holds\" consist of the handshape together with the hand orientation (together referred to as the hand configuration) at a specific location in signing space. \"Holds\" do not contain any change of location (movement from one location to another). \"Movements\", on the other hand, involve a change of location and may involve secondary movements such as wiggling of the fingers. Syllables may then be grouped into the following types: M (the minimal syllable), HM, MH, HMH (the maximal syllable). In the case of HM syllables, for example, the hand configuration of the \"Movement\" moves away from the location of the \"Hold\". A syllable of type M can consist of the following specifications: a path movement (from one location to another), a path movement with secondary movement (such as wiggling or twisting), or a secondary movement without path movement. The syllable type H (a segment without a \"Movement\") is not allowed for phonotactical reasons.\n\nAn elementary component of lexical signs are non-manual lexical markings, such as movements of eyes (rolling, widening), mouth (puffing, rounding) and face, as well as the whole head (nodding, tilting) and upper body (leaning). These are obligatory accompaniments of a quarter of all lexical signs. Making visual syllables with the mouth is referred to as mouthing.\n\nThe unmarked word order in DGS is subject-object-verb, similar to languages such as Turkish, Japanese and Latin, but differing from German.\n\nIf an indirect object appears in the sentence, it stands before the direct object.\n\nIn sentences with chains of verbs, auxiliary verbs and similar usually appear after the full verb, the opposite of English word order.\n\nThe Personal Agreement Marker (glossed as \"PAM\"), which looks almost like the sign for \"person\" and may be accompanied by the mouthing \"auf\" (\"on\"), is a sign used to indicate the location in signing space of animate objects when the verb in the sentence does not do this. It roughly fills the roll of object pronouns, however it seems to function more as an auxiliary verb, inflecting for person where the main verb does not. Although there is considerable variation, especially across dialects, it tends to occur where auxiliaries occur, after the verb, rather than in the object slot. The benefactive marker (glossed as \"BEM\") is similarly placed.\n\nTime expressions (\"tomorrow\", \"next week\") appear at the beginning of the sentence (as a discourse topic).\n\nPhrases specifying location tend to occur at the beginning of the sentence (after the time information).\n\nThis follows the figure-ground-principle, according to which smaller, more mobile referents (figures) tend to occur after larger, less mobile referents (ground).\n\nSentence adverbs often appear at the beginning of the sentence.\n\nHowever, adverbs that modify the verb but which cannot be expressed non-manually follow the verb as an extra clause.\n\nWh-words (interrogatives) usually occur at the end of the sentence after the verb.\n\nSome signs with a negative meaning tend to occur at the end of the sentence.\n\nHowever, if the negation is not emphasised, it can also appear in the expected position.\n\nDeterminers (articles, demonstratives, quantifiers, relative pronouns) follow the noun.\n\nTheir function is to set the location of referents within the signing space. If this is indicated instead by directional verbs, determiners can always be omitted, provided they are not required for other reasons (such as showing possession, pluralisation, etc.) There is no distinction between definite and indefinite articles.\n\nAttributive adjectives follow immediately after the noun.\n\nThe copula \"to be\" does not exist in DGS. Predicative adjectives are generally separated from the noun by a determiner.\n\nCompare the preceding sentence to the following noun phrase, in which the determiner follows the adjective.\n\nPossessive adjectives stand between the possessor and the possession.\n\nHere is an example of a longer but nevertheless simple, unmarked sentence.\n\nParts of the sentence which are moved outside of their usual unmarked position are accompanied by non-manual marking.\n\nSentence elements (with the exception of verbs) can be topicalised by being moved to the beginning of the sentence and marked with raised eyebrows.\n\nOften, a topic doesn't otherwise have any other role in the sentence. In these cases, it represents a limitation of the scope of the sentence. Compare the following three sentences.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1875376", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1875376", "title": "NFC South", "text": "NFC South\n\nThe National Football Conference – South Division or NFC South is one of the four divisions of the National Football Conference (NFC) in the National Football League (NFL). It was created prior to the 2002 NFL season, when the league realigned divisions after expanding to 32 teams. The NFC South currently has four member clubs: the Atlanta Falcons, Carolina Panthers, New Orleans Saints, and Tampa Bay Buccaneers. \n\nPrior to the 2002 season, the Buccaneers belonged to the AFC West () and NFC Central (–), while the other three teams were part of the geographically inaccurate NFC West. \n\nThe NFC South is one of two divisions to have each of its teams make a Super Bowl appearance since the 2002 realignment (along with the NFC West): Tampa Bay (2002), Atlanta (2016), Carolina (2003 and 2015) and New Orleans (2009). Also since 2002, each team has won at least three division titles, the only such division in the league. It is also the only NFL division to have zero division sweeps by any of its member teams.\n\nEntering 2019, the Saints have the most wins among division members. The Saints record is 375–438–5; their win in Super Bowl XLIV is the highlight of a 9–11 playoff record. The Falcons record is 365–461–6 with a playoff record of 10–14; the Falcons lost in Super Bowls XXXIII and LI, the latter in overtime. The Buccaneers record is 267–424–1 with a victory in their only Super Bowl appearance, Super Bowl XXXVII, and an overall playoff record of 6–9. The Panthers have the best playoff record (9–8) of any team in the division with losses in Super Bowls XXXVIII and 50, with a regular season record of 195-204-1.\n\nThe NFC South is the only NFC division not to have any teams that predate the 1960 launch of the American Football League, the NFL’s former rival league. The oldest team is the Falcons, who began play in 1966, and the Saints began play only a year later in 1967. Each of the other NFC divisions has 3 teams that began play earlier than 1960, while the remaining three such teams are in the American Football Conference.\n\nThe NFC South became the second division in five years to have a champion with a losing record, as the 2014 Carolina Panthers won the division with a 7–8–1 record. (The 2010 Seattle Seahawks won the NFC West with a 7–9 record.) Additionally, Carolina became the first team to repeat as NFC South champions since the creation of the division. The Panthers were the first team to win the NFC South three consecutive times, from 2013 to 2015; New Orleans followed from 2017 to 2019. On January 7, 2018, two NFC South teams (the Carolina Panthers and New Orleans Saints) met in the NFL playoffs for the first time since the division's creation in 2002. Before then, they were the only division left in the NFL who had never had teams face off against each other in the postseason.\n\n Place cursor over year for division champ or Super Bowl team.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1875383", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1875383", "title": "NFC West", "text": "NFC West\n\nThe National Football Conference – Western Division or NFC West is one of the four divisions of the National Football Conference (NFC) in the National Football League (NFL). It currently has four members: the Arizona Cardinals, the Los Angeles Rams, the San Francisco 49ers, and the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nThe division was formed in 1967 as the National Football League Coastal Division, keeping with the theme of having all of the league's divisions starting with the letter \"C.\" The division was so named because its teams were fairly close to the coasts of the United States, although they were on opposite coasts, making for long travel between division rivals. The NFL Coastal Division had four members: Atlanta Falcons, Baltimore Colts, Los Angeles Rams, and San Francisco 49ers. Los Angeles and San Francisco occupied the West Coast, while Baltimore maintained its dominance over the lesser teams that remained in the division. Atlanta was placed in the division despite being farther east than three Eastern Conference teams (Cowboys, Cardinals, and Saints).\n\nAfter the AFL–NFL merger in 1970, the division was renamed the NFC West. The Baltimore Colts moved to the AFC East and were replaced by the New Orleans Saints, who came from the Capitol Division of the Eastern Conference. In 1976, the newly formed Seattle Seahawks spent one season in this division before moving to the AFC West. Except for that one year, the division remained the same until 1995 with the addition of the new Carolina Panthers team. The Rams moved to St. Louis before that same season, making the division geographically inaccurate. Ten of the fifteen NFC teams were based west of Atlanta, and twelve of them were based west of Charlotte.\n\nThe 2002 re-alignment changed the entire look of the NFC West. The Falcons, Panthers, and Saints moved into the NFC South; while the Cardinals moved in from the NFC East and the Seahawks returned from the AFC West. The Rams remained in the West, preserving the historical rivalry with the 49ers that has existed since 1950, and thus had been the only team in the division that was located east of the Rocky Mountains until 2015; despite this, the re-alignment made the NFC West have all of its teams based west of the Mississippi River. With the Rams' return to Los Angeles in 2016, the entire NFC West is now located west of the Rockies for the first time in its history; all teams except for the Cardinals are based in the Pacific Time Zone (since most of Arizona does not observe daylight saving time, the clocks are the same as Pacific Daylight Time from the second Sunday in March until the first Sunday of November).\n\nThe NFC West became the second division since the 2002 realignment (The NFC South was the first) to have each of its teams make a conference championship game appearance as well as a Super Bowl appearance: Los Angeles (2018), Arizona (2008, and 2015), San Francisco (2011, 2012 and 2013), and Seattle (2005, 2013, and 2014). Also since 2002, each team has won at least three division titles, one of only two divisions in the league to do so.\n\nIn 2010, the NFC West became the first division in NFL history to have a champion with a losing record, after the 2010 Seattle Seahawks won the division title with a record of 7–9. They were joined in this distinction in 2014 by the Carolina Panthers, who won the NFC South with a record of 7–8–1.\n\nThe division is one of only two in which all of its teams have appeared in a Super Bowl at least once since the 2002 realignment (along with the NFC South): Arizona (2008), Los Angeles Rams (2018), San Francisco (2012, 2019), and Seattle (2005, 2013, 2014).\n\nSince the end of the 2016 NFL regular season, the 49ers lead the division with a record of 560–464–16 (107–132–1 since re-alignment) with five Super Bowl titles and an overall playoff record of 31–21. The Rams hold a record of 577–569–21 (87–152–1 since re-alignment) with four Super Bowl appearances and one win to go with a 21–26 overall playoff record. The Cardinals hold a 111–128-1 record since joining the NFC West (542–732–40 overall) and a loss in Super Bowl XLIII, currently with a 7–9 playoff record, 5-4 as a member of the NFC West. The Seahawks hold a record of 137–102-1 since joining the NFC West (325–318-1 overall), with three Super Bowl appearances, winning Super Bowl XLVIII to go with a playoff record of 16–14; they are currently 13–9 in the playoffs as a member of the NFC West, having gone 3–5 while in the AFC West. Since re-alignment, the Seahawks have led the division in wins, division titles, and playoff appearances.\n\n \n\nFollowing 2001, the Atlanta Falcons, Carolina Panthers, and New Orleans Saints left the NFC West to join the newly formed NFC South. The Arizona Cardinals joined the NFC West from the NFC East, and the Seattle Seahawks joined from the AFC West to combine with the San Francisco 49ers and the St. Louis Rams to create the new NFC West.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1875385", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1875385", "title": "Vivian Solon", "text": "Vivian Solon\n\nVivian Alvarez Solon (born 30 October 1962) is an Australian who was unlawfully removed to the Philippines by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) in July 2001. In May 2005, it became public knowledge that she had been deported, although DIMIA knew of its mistake in 2003. Solon's family had listed her as a missing person since July 2003, and until May 2005, did not know that she had been deported. The circumstances surrounding Solon's unlawful deportation have caused much controversy in the Australian media.\n\nIn October 2005, a report on Solon's deportation was released, following an inquiry conducted by former Victoria Police commissioner Neil Comrie. The report revealed that several senior DIMIA officials in Canberra knew about Solon's unlawful deportation in 2003 and 2004, and failed to act. It also found that Solon's mental and physical health problems were not given proper attention. Solon has since returned to Australia on 18 November 2005.\n\nVivian Alvarez Solon was born in the Philippines on 30 October 1962. On 26 May 1984, she married an Australian man, Robert Young, in the Philippines. She then changed her name to Vivian Solon Young. The two moved to Brisbane, Queensland, where Solon was naturalised as an Australian on 3 March 1986. In 1990, the couple separated, and they divorced in 1993. After the divorce, she changed her name back to Vivian Alvarez Solon.\n\nBetween 1995 and 2000, Solon received treatment for mental health issues. She was diagnosed as suffering from a paranoid psychotic condition, which affected her behaviour. During this time she developed a minor criminal record with the Queensland Police, and was at one point taken into protective custody by police in Brisbane, who were worried about the effects of her mental condition. On one occasion, her fingerprints were recorded and entered into the national law enforcement database, CrimTrac.\n\nAccording to a police report, Solon had left her five-year-old son at the Brisbane City Hall childcare facility on 16 February 2001, but did not return to pick him up. Queensland Premier, Peter Beattie revealed on 6 May 2005, that her son, by then nine, has been in foster care since.\n\nAt 11:47pm on the night of 30 March, ambulance services were called to a park in Lismore, in the far north of New South Wales. They found Solon next to an open drain in the park, suffering from head injuries. She also had difficulty moving her legs. She had most likely sustained these injuries after falling into the drain, although some media reports speculated that she had been in a car accident. To this day she claims she was knocked off a pushbike by a passing car, but the medical view has always been that she was physically assaulted . She was taken to Lismore Base Hospital, where she was treated for her injuries. She was soon moved to the psychiatric ward because she was behaving aggressively towards hospital staff, presumably due to her head injuries. A social worker Guing Coop who visited Solon at the hospital identified that she was of Filipino background, and suspected that she was an illegal immigrant. On this basis the social worker contacted the local branch of the Department of Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs.\n\nDIMIA officers first interviewed Solon on 3 May 2001. According to the Comrie report, the officers presumed that Solon was an illegal immigrant, and did not do proper background checks. On 12 July, Solon was transferred from the hospital to DIMIA custody, and taken to a motel in Brisbane. She told the officials that she was an Australian citizen, and did not want to leave the country, however she was ignored. On 17 July, Queensland Police officially listed Solon as a missing person, several months after she had failed to collect her son from childcare. However, this information was not picked up by DIMIA.\n\nA representative from the Philippines consulate in Brisbane visited Solon on 18 July. In the meeting Solon said that she had been married to an Australian man, a Mr Young, but this information was not passed on to DIMIA. The consulate refused to issue Solon with travel documents, because they did not consider her fit enough to travel (she was in a wheelchair at the time), and so DIMIA arranged for a different doctor to visit her. This doctor declared her fit to fly, and signed the medical certificate allowing Solon to be deported. On 20 July Solon was escorted onto a plane by Queensland Police, and flown to Manila. Handed over to Qantas ground staff at the airport, she was eventually taken to a hospice run by the Catholic Church.\n\nIn July 2003, the Missing Persons Bureau in Queensland contacted DIMIA with an enquiry about Solon, who had been listed as a missing person for two years. Two DIMIA officers in Canberra conducted searches of records, and made a match between Vivian Solon (as she was known to the missing persons authorities) and Vivian Alvarez (as she was known to DIMIA – Alvarez is her middle name). They told their supervisor (referred to in the Comrie Report as officer 'A') on 14 July that an Australian citizen had been deported, but the supervisor did nothing.\n\nOn 20 August 2003, an episode of the television program \"Without A Trace\" was aired, which contained a Crime Stoppers segment, with information about Solon and her photograph, at the conclusion of the program. One of the officers in Canberra (referred to in the Comrie Report as officer 'E') again told the supervisor, who again did nothing. At the same time, a DIMIA officer in Brisbane who had worked on Solon's case in 2001 also saw the Crime Stoppers segment, and informed her supervisor. That supervisor also did nothing.\n\nOfficer 'E' decided to approach the Missing Persons Bureau directly. In September 2003, the Bureau approached the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) for help in searching for Solon. DFAT informed the Bureau that Solon had traveled to the Philippines. Eventually Solon's former husband, Robert Young, was informed where Solon was. Throughout early 2004, Young persisted in questioning the Bureau, until it eventually decided to contact DIMIA. The Bureau was put through to officer 'A' in Canberra (who had already been told twice of Solon's unlawful deportation). Officer 'A' then contacted the Brisbane office, and learned that other people there knew about the error made. However again no action was taken, and the Minister for Immigration at the time, Philip Ruddock, was not informed.\n\nOn 4 April 2005, Young contacted the new Minister for Immigration, Senator Amanda Vanstone, directly. Vanstone's office inquired into the case, and discovered what had happened to Solon. Solon's DIMIA case file was not stored with the normal case files, and was instead found separately, in the desk of one of officer 'A's subordinates. Vanstone then ordered the Australian Federal Police (AFP), in cooperation with the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) in the Philippines, to locate Solon. NBI chief Ricardo Diaz reported on \"Lateline\" on 6 May 2005, that their search was unsuccessful after three weeks. Mr Diaz also claimed that the AFP was not forthcoming with information to locate Ms Solon.\n\nWhile watching the news on ABC Asia Pacific, Catholic priest Father Mike Duffin, an Australian from Saint Vincent's Parish Church, watched reports about the hunt for Vivian Solon and wondered if the reports may have referred to a Vivian that was brought to the Mother Teresa Sisters, Missionaries of Charity, in Olongapo City by Australian representatives four years ago. He recognised her from the photo that was used in the report. Father Duffin was surprised that the Australian Government was unaware of her location. Duffin said:\n\n\"They are the ones who told her before she left Australia she was coming to the mission, coming to Mother Teresa Sisters, and then when they brought her, they left her at the Mother Teresa Sisters, Missionaries of Charity.\"\n\n\"So I find it very hard that they don't know where they left her, do they have no records or do people forget things as soon as they do them?\"\n\nHowever, Senator Vanstone disputed Father Duffin's claims of prior knowledge by the Australian Government. She informed the media on 12 May 2005 that immigration records had no mention of Ms Solon being brought to a convent. Instead, her records showed that she was met at the airport by a woman from the Overseas Workers Welfare Association. Ms Vanstone also revealed that the files also showed that there was mention of a discussion with Solon on the possibility of her making contact with some nuns.\n\nFollowing identification of Vivian Solon at the Mother Teresa Sisters, Missionaries of Charity, the Australian Government sent consular officials to confirm her identity. Senator Vanstone announced that if Ms Solon wished to return to Australia, the Australian Government would provide assistance for her to do so. There was speculation in the media that Solon did not want to return to Australia.\n\nAn anonymous senior immigration official reported to \"Lateline\" that Solon's situation was due to a systemic problem in the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. \"Lateline\" reported that the official said:\n\n\"In the compliance area, people on the whole are a bunch of cowboys, under so much pressure to deport people. All proper processes have broken down. They put their energy into picking up people and deporting them without proper investigation.\"\n\nThe social worker who was one of the last people given access to Ms Solon before her deportation said she had requested from Immigration the grounds for Solon's deportation.\n\nWhile being escorted back to Manila by Australian Embassy officials on 13 May 2005, Ms Solon revealed that she was unaware that she had been deported. According to Solon, she was informed by Australian officials that she had to be sent to Philippines for treatment, and received travel assistance from them. She also indicated that she had informed Immigration Officers that she had an Australian passport, but was not carrying it at that time.\n\n\"Lateline\" confirmed with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on 14 May 2005 that Ms Solon had been issued a passport, valid at the time she was deported. Since Ms Solon has been an Australian, she was issued three passports, and had traveled on an Australian passport for ten years. Her last passport was issued in November 2000, but never collected.\n\nThe Solon case was initially referred to the Palmer Inquiry, which was set up to inquire into the unlawful detention of Cornelia Rau in an immigration facility. Senator Vanstone decided that the case should be inquired into separately, and instructed the Commonwealth Ombudsman, Professor John McMillan, to hold an investigation. The Ombudsman appointed Neil Comrie, former Commissioner of the Victoria Police, to conduct the investigation.\n\nThe decision to hold a non-judicial inquiry was criticised by certain groups, who did not believe that it had sufficient powers to compel witnesses to testify. Dr Sev Ozdowski, a commissioner on the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, called for a Royal Commission into Solon's case, saying:\n\n\"It certainly warrants an open inquiry which can get all of the facts, it warrants an inquiry which would allow witnesses to come forward, which would provide protection to witnesses and it warrants an inquiry which will have access to all relevant documents.\n<BR>\"So, it could be a judicial inquiry, it could be a Royal Commission, it could be some other form of inquiry but it's important that it's an independent inquiry with access to both witnesses and information.\"\n\nPremier of Queensland Peter Beattie had also written to Prime Minister John Howard calling for a Royal Commission into Solon's deportation, and the detention of Cornelia Rau. According to Beattie, the framework of the Palmer inquiry did not provide sufficient legal protection, leading to the refusal of twelve Corrective Services staff to give testimony.\n\nOn 12 May 2005, Australian Democrats Senator Andrew Bartlett, with the support of the Australian Greens and the Australian Labor Party (ALP), initiated a debate in the Australian Senate for a judicial inquiry or Royal Commission into the operation and administration of mandatory detention, deportation and enforcement. The government expressed a belief that was not necessary to rush into a judicial inquiry then, as the facts of the matters had not been determined by the Palmer Inquiry.\n\nThe report was completed on 26 September 2005, and was released on 6 October. The report was strongly critical of DIMIA, concluding that a combination of incompetence, inadequate training, improper data systems and poor management led to Solon's deportation. The report found that DIMIA had not investigated Solon's case properly before it decided to deport her. The only evidence in Solon's file which seemed to indicate that she was not legally in Australia was a handwritten note, which was not dated or signed by anyone, which stated:\n\n\"Smuggled into Australia as a sex slave. Wants to return to the Philippines. Has been physically abused.\"\n\nThe inquiry concluded that DIMIA officials had simply acted on unfounded assumptions about Solon, rather than discovering real evidence. They assumed that Solon's surname was Alvarez (actually her middle name) and conducted their initial searches based on this name. As such, they found no record of her. There were eleven different spellings used by various officials, which also led to confusion. The initial investigation did not take into account the fact that Solon had been treated in the psychiatric ward in Lismore, which might have explained inconsistencies in evidence she gave to DIMIA officials.\n\nSome key recommendations of the inquiry were:\nThe report also reaffirmed a number of the recommendations of the Palmer inquiry.\n\nFollowing the release of the report, Senator Vanstone announced that A$50.3 million would be spent on a College of Immigration, Border Security and Compliance in order to train DIMIA staff. A$17.9 million would also be spent on improving healthcare services at immigration facilities.\n\nLabor spokesperson for immigration, Tony Burke called for Senator Vanstone to take responsibility for Solon's deportation, under the doctrine of ministerial responsibility. However, Vanstone refused to resign, saying that the general presumption was that ministers should not be responsible for things they did not know about. She also said:\n\n\"I'm thinking of trying to buy the copyright on Elton John's song 'I'm Still Standing', but I don't want to tempt fate. So I'll just play it to myself quietly at night.\"\n\nBefore Ms Solon's return to Australia, there was speculation in both the media and in the legal community about the possibility of a compensation claim being brought by her against the Commonwealth Government and/or the Department of Immigration.\n\nSydney-based lawyer George Newhouse brought a legal team together including former Federal Court Judge and Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission president Marcus Einfeld Q.C. and lawyer Harry Freedman, who travelled to Manila to discuss legal options with the Solon family.\n\nTerry O'Gorman, President of the Australian Council for Civil Liberties defended the urgency of legal action. He said: \nOnly the Federal Government having to pay out money and having to defend a court case will bring home to the Federal Immigration Minister, and the Prime Minister, that rights and principles are there to be observed. Criticism of this government over its immigration policy is simply waived away; only when they have to pay money will they sit up and take notice.\n\nOn Solon's return to Australia on 18 November 2005, Marcus Einfeld Q.C. confirmed that her compensation would be determined by retired High Court Judge Sir Anthony Mason after she and her legal team had reached agreement on the form of a private arbitration. As part of the deal the Commonwealth Government confirmed that it would care for Solon until the arbitration process was completed.\n\nOn 30 November 2006, Mason awarded Solon a compensation payout, reported by \"The Age\" newspaper as A$4.5 million, although the Australian Government refused to confirm the amount, citing privacy reasons.\n\n\n\n\nOther prominent immigration cases in Australia:\n\n\n"}
