This, however, did not prevent them from creating political alliances with the military during its first years of existence. Founded in 1872, the party's first candidate was its founder, Manuel Pardo, who was elected on August 2, 1872.\n\nDuring the 1870s, economic growth and a certain degree of political stability had laid the conditions for creating the country's first political party. It was also a new era of international trade, business, and finance that Peru was benefiting from. Some believed that this era required the managerial skills that an educated and professional \"Elite\" could provide and believed Manuel Pardo was apt for this job.\n\nThe Civilista Party was first primarily composed of the newly rich merchants, planters, and businesspeople in Peru (especially those who benefited themselves with the \"Guano Boom exportations\"). The members of the party believed that the military was corrupt and no longer capable of ruling the country and that it was more apt to serve it militarily than to rule it politically.\n\nAfter the War of the Pacific and a successful revolution (that removed the military from power once again), the Party played a key role in the reconstruction of the country. Reviving its antimilitary and pro-export program, they secured the support of its constituents. Most of its members were part of the economic and social elite established in Lima.\n\nBetween 1899 and 1920, most Peruvian presidents had been members of this Party. This period of Peruvian history is often called the \"Aristocratic Republic\" (coined by Peruvians referring to the social elite that governed them). Elections, however, were restricted, subject to strict property and literacy qualifications, and more often than not manipulated by the incumbent Civilista regime.\n\nThe party, as a major political force, was disbanded during the so-called \"oncenio\" (11 years of power) of Augusto B. Leguía y Salcedo's second term.\n\n"}

No ships were lost on either side, and casualties were small.\n\nElphinston had arrived at Cape Matapan, southern Greece, on 20 May 1770 from Portsmouth and landed his troops on 22 May at Rupino. Hearing that the Ottoman fleet was divided in two, he decided to attack. After battling bad weather, he sighted the Ottoman ships on 27 May at the entrance to the gulf and despite the superior numbers of the Ottomans (about 10 battleships and some smaller vessels vs 3 battleships, 2 frigates and 4 armed merchantmen) he sailed up before a light SSE breeze to attack. Soon after 5pm \"Ne tron menya\" attacked the Ottoman flagship, and then \"Saratov\" attacked the Ottoman Vice- and Rear Admiral's ships. \"Nadezhda\" was also in action. Elphinston, in \"Svyatoslav\", had to chase and fire on the armed merchantmen to get them to fight, but when he did attack the Ottoman fleet retreated, using their galleys to tow their battleships north. The Russians used their boats to do the same.\n\nOn 28 May, soon after 12pm the Ottoman fleet anchored in line under the guns of the Nauplia batteries. At about 3pm Elphinston attacked, standing up and down the Ottoman line, but with little effect.

Named by the New York Times as one of the 5 best voices on the planet.\n\nValeria Lynch was born on January 7, 1952 in the neighborhood of Villa Urquiza, Buenos Aires, Argentina, the first child of the marriage of María Antonia Spano (Tony) and José Julio Lancellotti. At age 14 while studying at the Commercial College Donato Álvarez in the neighborhood of La Paternal, she defined her vocation and began to study singing with Clara Calvo and drama with Dante Gilardoni.\n\nIn 1969, she debuted on the television show \"La Botica del Ángel\" with Eduardo Bergara Leumann, singing \"Cuando un amigo se va\". The first major production Lynch took, was with producer Alejandro Romay in the adaptation of the musical \"Hair\", held at the Teatro Argentino in 1971 where she put her voice to the song \"Aquarius-Let The Sunshine In\". From this Romay allegedly discovered her talent and suggested that she use a pseudonym.\n\nValeria Lynch formally began performing in the 1970s singing jingles and underground rock in English with a group called Expression. She was also part of the TV TRIBU SRL, with which she recorded two songs for the soundtrack of the program, \"\"I Am A Woman\"\" and \"\"Do Not Be Discouraged\"\" as well as two different versions of the song\" Tribu SRL \"with the rest of the group, in 1975.\n\nIn 1976 she married Héctor Cavallero, who had discovered her around 1974 when she was singing in the underground clubs of Buenos Aires. The story goes that Cavallero saw her sing and was so fascinated that he waited in the dressing room and offered to represent her and launch her career as a romantic singer. The couple had two sons, Federico (born 1979) and Santiago Cavallero (born 1986). After eighteen years together, they separated in 1995.\n\nIn 1977 she released her first album, Valeria Lynch, and the cover was a drawing of her profile made by her friend Horacio Fontova. Her version of the song \"Mujer Sola\", written by the Italian Mia Martini (Domenica Berté), was the first cut of circulation. Her debut as a pop balladeer was at the nightclub Michelangelo in the barrio of San Telmo.\n\nIn April 1979, she released the album \"Mujer\" and made her first promotional trip to Mexico and Central America.\n\nDuring the 1980s, Valeria Lynch's success spread throughout Latin America. Her visceral singing style, coupled with her strong vocals and the choice of a repertoire that reached for popular taste made the difference with other interpreters of pop ballads. Her songs were not only a success in U.S. and Latin America but their music came to Spain, the Netherlands, Japan, Romania, Italy and the former Soviet Union.\n\nIn 1980, while performing the musical \"Estan tocando nuestra cancion\" with Victor Laplace and Cipe Lincovsky in Buenos Aires, she released her third studio album \"Capricornio\". The song \"Somos Locos del Amor\" was a favorite of the Argentine public.\n\nIn 1981, Valeria was in Mexico on a promotional tour and people from her record company suggested she audition for the rock opera Evita, directed by Harold Prince. Mexican producers had chosen the Mexican Rocío Banquels, but Harold Prince was overwhelming in his statement that \"in my music I want Valeria,\" so it was decided that the two were the protagonists. Playing the role of Eva Perón opened the doors to the international level. In repeated statements to the press Harold Prince said: \"Valeria Lynch was the best that I got to direct as Evita\".\n\nIn 1982 she released \"Quiereme\", the hit single \"Mentira\", song composed by Chilean Buddy Richard and international success of the Nicaraguan Hernaldo Zúñiga, catapulted her to stardom and the album was promoted throughout the continent.

She remained successful due to her avant-garde sound in the last decade, without continental touring as before. Lynch also returned to musical comedy and was successful with the intelligentsia in Argentina that once did not understand so much success in a clearly popular figure.\n\nIn 1990 she participated in the Festival of San Remo, Italy, where the critics compared her playing style to that of Mina Mazzini. Her record label BMG RCA- released a compilation album entitled \"Mis mejores canciones\" as a closure of her stage career full of hit songs. This sold just over 200,000 copies in Argentina alone.\n\nRecorded in Rome in 1991, the album \"hablame de amor\" had sixteen consecutive performances at the Opera Theater in Buenos Aires, surpassing the record held by the Spanish Julio Iglesias at the same venue.

A series of owners enlarged the park northwards and eastwards. By the 19th century it was at its largest extent, and one of the homes of the Earls Spencer, lords of the manor. The park had been landscaped in the 18th century by Capability Brown when the lake was formed by constructing a dam across a brook that flows from the springline near Wimbledon Common down to the River Wandle in Earlsfield.\n\nIn 1846, the 4th Earl Spencer sold the estate and house to John Augustus Beaumont a property developer who laid out new roads and sold plots of land for house building.

It is located on the Big Bay de Noc of Lake Michigan, between Snail Shell Harbor and Sand Bay, on the southern side of the Upper Peninsula, about 17 miles south of US 2. Fayette was the site of an industrial community that manufactured charcoal pig iron between 1867 and 1891. The town has been reconstructed into a living museum, showing what life was like in this town in the late 19th century. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970.\n\nFayette was once one of the Upper Peninsula's most productive iron-smelting operations. Fayette grew up around two blast furnaces, a large dock, and several charcoal kilns, following the post-Civil War need for iron. Nearly 500 residents—many immigrating from Canada, the British Isles, and northern Europe—lived in and near the town that existed to make pig iron. During 24 years of operation Fayette's blast furnaces produced a total of 229,288 tons of iron, using local hardwood forests for fuel and quarrying limestone from the bluffs to purify the iron ore. When the charcoal iron market began to decline, the Jackson Iron Company closed its Fayette smelting operations in 1891. Another event leading to the demise of the Jackson Iron Company was the use of the hardwoods and limestone to purify the iron, leading to the exhaustion of hardwoods in the area. This was the main source for purifying the iron and therefore led to the decline of the Jackson Iron Company. After shutting down operations, many residents left Fayette in search of employment elsewhere, though some chose to stay nearby and used the land for farming.\n\nBecause of the closing of smelting operations, the town became a resort and fishing village. In 1916 it was purchased by a wealthy individual and turned into a summer resort. It continued in that capacity until 1946 when another individual purchased it, who eventually fell behind on taxes. Lastly, it was purchased by the Escanaba Paper Company, and was swapped to the Michigan government for timberland. As a result, Fayette became a state park in 1959.\n\nToday, Fayette Historic Townsite is a living museum with many restored buildings. Visitors may walk through the buildings to learn about life in Fayette during the late 19th century. Over 20 buildings are open, with restoration continuing on other parts of the town.\n\nThe townsite is open daily for visitors from approx. May through October. A visitors center and museum store are also located at the park. There is no admission charge; however, a Michigan State Park permit is required. For more information consult the State of Michigan Fayette page.\n\nThere are 61 semi-modern campsites . Facilities include electrical service to all campsites and access to vault toilets and water. Most campsites are well shaded. Boat camping is allowed in Snail Shell Harbor, and space is on a first-come, first-served basis.\nThere is a beach on Sand Bay (Lake Michigan) just a short distance from the campground. The picnic area is adjacent to the beach and offers a picnic shelter, grills and vault toilets. Playground equipment and horsehoe courts are available.\n\nThe park offers approx. of hiking trails. The trails are groomed in the winter for cross-country skiing. Trails wind through a hardwood forest, up beside dolomite cliffs (which are part of the Niagara Escarpment) and throughout the historic townsite.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1881722", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1881722", "title": "External memory algorithm", "text": "External memory algorithm\n\nIn computing, external memory algorithms or out-of-core algorithms are algorithms that are designed to process data that are too large to fit into a computer's main memory at once. Such algorithms must be optimized to efficiently fetch and access data stored in slow bulk memory (auxiliary memory) such as hard drives or tape drives, or when memory is on a computer network. External memory algorithms are analyzed in the external memory model.\n\nExternal memory algorithms are analyzed in an idealized model of computation called the external memory model (or I/O model, or disk access model). The external memory model is an abstract machine similar to the RAM machine model, but with a cache in addition to main memory. The model captures the fact that read and write operations are much faster in a cache than in main memory, and that reading long contiguous blocks is faster than reading randomly using a disk read-and-write head. The running time of an algorithm in the external memory model is defined by the number of reads and writes to memory required. The model was introduced by Alok Aggarwal and Jeffrey Vitter in 1988. The external memory model is related to the cache-oblivious model, but algorithms in the external memory model may know both the block size and the cache size. For this reason, the model is sometimes referred to as the cache-aware model.\n\nThe model consists of a processor with an internal memory or cache of size , connected to an unbounded external memory. Both the internal and external memory are divided into blocks of size . One input/output or memory transfer operation consists of moving a block of contiguous elements from external to internal memory, and the running time of an algorithm is determined by the number of these input/output operations.\n\nAlgorithms in the external memory model take advantage of the fact that retrieving one object from external memory retrieves an entire block of size formula_1. This property is sometimes referred to as locality.\n\nSearching for an element among formula_2 objects is possible in the external memory model using a B-tree with branching factor formula_1. Using a B-tree, searching, insertion, and deletion can be achieved in formula_4 time (in Big O notation). Information theoretically, this is the minimum running time possible for these operations, so using a B-tree is asymptotically optimal.\n\nExternal sorting is sorting in an external memory setting. External sorting can be done via distribution sort, which is similar to quicksort, or via a formula_5-way merge sort. Both variants achieve the asymptotically optimal runtime of formula_6 to sort objects. This bound also applies to the Fast Fourier Transform in the external memory model.\n\nThe permutation problem is to rearrange formula_2 elements into a specific permutation. This can either be done either by sorting, which requires the above sorting runtime, or inserting each element in order and ignoring the benefit of locality. Thus, permutation can be done in formula_8 time.\n\nThe external memory model captures the memory hierarchy, which is not modeled in other common models used in analyzing data structures, such as the random access machine, and is useful for proving lower bounds for data structures. The model is also useful for analyzing algorithms that work on datasets too big to fit in internal memory.\n\nA typical example is geographic information systems, especially digital elevation models, where the full data set easily exceeds several gigabytes or even terabytes of data.\n\nThis methodology extends beyond general purpose CPUs and also includes GPU computing as well as classical digital signal processing. In general-purpose computing on graphics processing units (GPGPU), powerful graphics cards (GPUs) with little memory (compared with the more familiar system memory, which is most often referred to simply as RAM) are utilized with relatively slow CPU-to-GPU memory transfer (when compared with computation bandwidth).\n\nAn early use of the term \"out-of-core\" as an adjective is in 1962 in reference to \"devices\" that are other than the core memory of an IBM 360. An early use of the term \"out-of-core\" with respect to \"algorithms\" appears in 1971.\n\n\n"}

She writes children's literature and some historical books, as well as poetry and commentaries. Weatherford is best known for her books \"Juneteenth Jamboree, Freedom in Congo Square,\" and \"You Can Fly: The Tuskegee Airmen.\" Notably, Weatherford has written literary criticisms of racist representations in children's entertainment. Today, she often writes with her son, Jeffery Boston Weatherford, who is an illustrator and poet.\n\nThe music of poetry has fascinated Weatherford and motivated her literary career. In an interview with \"The Brown Bookshelf\" she said: \"The Creator called me to be a poet. I hear words strung together in my head just as a composer hears notes and chords. Scenes unfold in my mind just as they do on a filmmaker's storyboard. Like poetry, quality children's literature compresses language, distills feeling, evokes scenes, and can be experienced on multiple levels. The best poetry makes music with words.\"\nWeatherford began writing in first grade by dictating poems to her mother. Her father taught printing at a local high school and published his daughter's early works. As a child, she enjoyed reading Dr. Seuss and Langston Hughes. Continuing to pursue creative writing as a hobby through high school and college, she later earned her M.F.A. from the University of South Carolina and an M.A. in publication design from the University of Baltimore. Although a Baltimore native, she now resides in North Carolina and teaches composition and children's literature at Fayetteville State University (FSU). Initially, Weatherford was invited to FSU as a writer-in-residence, but in 2007, she received the position of associate professor.\nAs an author, she acknowledges her calling \"to mine the past for family stories, fading traditions and forgotten struggles.\" The books she writes, in poetry and prose, explore African-American history from a children's perspective and relate the past to new generations. Her works are often inspired by true events, many of which took place in the areas where Weatherford has lived. In her Author's Notes for each book, she includes a portion of the historical research from which her fiction or poetry emerged. In describing her purpose for writing to \"School Library Journal\", in a 2008 interview, she said: \"I want the books that I write that are set during the Jim Crow era and the Civil Rights era to nudge today's kids toward justice. We've gone a long way, but we still have a long way to go.\"\nIn 1995, Lee & Low Books published her first picture book, \"Juneteenth Jamboree\", about a summer celebration in memory of the Texas Emancipation. She then wrote a series of board books for preschoolers. In 1998, she co-authored \"Somebody's Knocking at Your Door: AIDS and the African American Church\", and then published a collection of poetry, \"The Tar Baby on the Soapbox\". After establishing herself as a versatile writer for both children and adults, she published two nonfiction chapter books before penning her first award-winning children's book, \"The Sound That Jazz Makes\" (2001), a poem that traces the history of African-American music.\nSince then, she has continued to write poetry, historical fiction, and nonfiction biographical works for children. She said in a 2008 interview that one of the most important poems she has written was \"Moses: When Harriet Tubman Led Her People to Freedom\": \"Those inspired words came together with Kadir Nelson's soulful paintings and Ellice Lee's brilliant art direction in a perfect publishing storm. Moses propelled my career to another level.\" \"Moses\" has won a Caldecott Award for illustration, as well as an NAACP Image Award for an Outstanding Literary Work for Children, and became a \"New York Times\" bestseller.\nIn 2008, Weatherford published her first poetic novel for young adults, \"Becoming Billie Holiday\", about the development of the artist who she refers to as her muse.\n\nWeatherford has written multiple articles attacking what she identifies as stereotyped caricatures of black people in East Asian popular culture, with two of the more prominent ones being geared toward anime, and another aimed at the name of a toothpaste brand.\n\nIn January 2000, Weatherford wrote an op-ed piece that ran in newspapers across Alabama. \"Politically Incorrect Pokémon\" explained how she believed that Pokémon #124, Jynx, was a negative stereotype of African Americans:\n\nIn response to the controversy, Jynx's in-game sprites were given a purple skin color in the American versions of \"Pokémon Gold\" and \"Silver\", released in late 2000. By 2002, Nintendo officially redesigned Jynx, changing her skin color from black to purple; this change was not reflected in the animated series until Jynx's purple skin appearance debuted in the episode \"Mean With Envy!\" (混戦、混乱！ポケモンコンテスト・キナギ大会！ （前編）), which originally aired in 2005, with the Amazon Prime release of \"Holiday Hi-Jynx\" recoloring Jynx accordingly even though she is still black on the thumbnail.\n\nIn an article published in the \"Christian Science Monitor\" in May 2000, Weatherford reiterated and expanded on her argument. Jynx had looked like \"an obese drag queen\", and she also offered Mr. Popo, a character from the \"Dragon Ball\" franchise, up for critique:\n\nThe \"Dragon Ball\" manga later released by Viz in 2003 had reduced the size of Mr. Popo's lips.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It competes with other light valve technologies such as Digital Light Processing (DLP) and liquid crystal on silicon (LCoS) for implementation in video projector devices such as rear-projection televisions. The use of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) in optical applications, which is known as optical MEMS or micro-opto-electro-mechanical structures (MOEMS), has enabled the possibility to combine the mechanical, electrical and optical components in very small scale.\nSilicon Light Machines (SLM), in Sunnyvale CA, markets and licenses GLV technology with the capitalised trademarks Grated Light Valve and GLV, previously Grating Light Valve. The valve diffracts laser light using an array of tiny movable ribbons mounted on a silicon base. The GLV uses six ribbons as the diffraction gratings for each pixel. The alignment of the gratings is altered by electronic signals, and this displacement controls the intensity of the diffracted light in a very smooth gradation.\n\nThe light valve was originally developed at Stanford University, in California, by electrical engineering professor David M. Bloom, along with William C. Banyai, Raj Apte, Francisco Sandejas, and Olav Solgaard, professor in the Stanford Department of Electrical Engineering. In 1994, the start-up company Silicon Light Machines was founded by Bloom to develop and commercialize the technology. The company is now wholly owned by Dainippon Screen Manufacturing Co., Ltd.\n\nIn July 2000, Sony announced the signing of a technology licensing agreement with SLM for the implementation of GLV technology in laser projectors for large venues, but by 2004 Sony announced the SRX-R110 front projector using its own LCoS-based technology SXRD. \nSLM then partnered with Evans & Sutherland (E&S). Using GLV technology, E&S developed the E&S Laser Projector, designed for use in domes and planetariums. The E&S Laser Projector was incorporated into the Digistar 3 dome projection system.\n\nThe GLV device is built on a silicon wafer and consists of parallel rows of highly reflective micro-ribbons – ribbons of sizes of a few µm with a top layer of aluminium – suspended above an air gap that are configured such that alternate ribbons (active ribbons are interlaced with static ribbons) can be dynamically actuated. Individual electrical connections to each active ribbon electrode provide for independent actuation. \nThe ribbons and the substrate are electrically conductive so that the deflection of the ribbon can be controlled in an analog manner: When the voltage of the active ribbons is set to ground potential, all ribbons are undeflected, and the device acts as a mirror so the incident light returns along the same path. When a voltage is applied between the ribbon and base conductor an electrical field is generated and deflects the active ribbon downward toward the substrate. This deflection can be as big as one-quarter wavelength hence creating diffraction effects on incident light that is reflected at an angle that is different from that of the incident light. The wavelength to diffract is determined by the spatial frequency of the ribbons. As this spatial frequency is determined by the photolithographic mask used to form the GLV device in the CMOS fabrication process, the departure angles can be very accurately controlled, which is useful for optical switching applications.\n\nSwitching from undeflected to maximum ribbon deflection can occur in 20 nanoseconds, which is a million times faster than conventional LCD display devices, and about 1000 times faster than TI’s DMD technology. This high speed can be achieved thanks to the small size, small mass and small excursion (of a few hundreds of nanometers), of the ribbons. Besides, there is no physical contact between moving elements which makes the lifetime of the GLV as long as 15 years without stopping (over 210 billion switching cycles).\n\nThe GLV technology has been applied to a wide range of products, from laser-based HDTV sets to computer-to-plate offset printing presses to DWDM components used for wavelength management. Applications of the GLV device in maskless photolithography have also been extensively investigated.\nTo build a display system using the GLV device different approaches can be followed: ranging from a simple approach using a single GLV device with a white light as a source thus having a monochrome system to a more complex solution using three different GLV devices each for one of the RGB primaries' sources that once diffracted require different optical filters to point the light onto the screen or an intermediate using a single white source with a GLV device. \nBesides, the light can be diffracted by the GLV device into an eyepiece for virtual retinal display, or into an optical system for image projection onto a screen (projector and rear-projector).\n\n"}

It was created simultaneously with a collection of action figures. \"BraveStarr\" was the last animated series produced by Filmation and Group W Productions to be broadcast before Filmation shut down in 1989.\n\n\"Bravo!\", a spin-off series (originally called \"Quest of the Prairie People\") was in production along with \"Bugzburg\" when the studio closed down. Reruns of the show aired on Qubo Night Owl from 2010 to 2013, and on the Retro Television Network from 2010 to 2015.\n\nThe idea for BraveStarr began with Tex Hex, his chief adversary. Tex Hex was created by Filmation's staff artists in 1984, during the development of Filmation's \"Ghostbusters\". Lou Scheimer found the character fascinating and pulled Tex Hex from the Ghostbusters cast. He asked Arthur Nadel, Filmation's Vice President for Creative Affairs, and art director John Grusd to develop a science fiction Western around the character.

Much of the food and water supply is imported. The majority of land is desert; but there is one wetland area, which is the home of \"apecats\". Water is also found in cactus-like 'Aqua-Pod' plants. The chief export is Kerium: a red mineral used as a fuel source, and often therefore the prize of conflicts among characters.

These figures were large for the time at nearly 8\" tall and came in a windowed box with artwork similar to that of their \"Masters of the Universe\" contemporaries. Each figure had a unique action feature and was packaged with one or more Kerium nuggets. Marshal BraveStarr and Tex Hex were also packaged with a Laser Fire Backpack which shot infrared beams and had \"space-age\" sound effects. Such backpacks were individually available – blue for heroes and black for villains. Other figures available were Handlebar, Sandstorm, Thirty/Thirty, Skuzz, Fuzz, Col. Borobot and Thunderstick.

{"id": "1881737", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1881737", "title": "Ram tank", "text": "Ram tank\n\nThe Tank, Cruiser, Ram was a cruiser tank designed and built by Canada in the Second World War, based on the U.S. M3 Medium tank chassis. Due to standardization on the American Sherman tank for frontline units, it was used exclusively for training purposes and was never used in combat as a gun tank. The chassis was used for several other combat roles however, such as a flamethrower tank, observation post, and armoured personnel carrier.\n\nEven before the loss of the majority of the United Kingdom's tank force in France in 1940 after Dunkirk, it was recognised that tank production in the UK at the start of the war was insufficient and capacity in the US was taken for British needs. So it was necessary that if Canada was to equip with tanks they would have to be manufactured locally. In June 1940 the Canadian Pacific Railway's Angus Shops in Montreal, as the only large firm with spare capacity, had received a contract to produce 300 partially fitted out Valentine tanks for the British; this was followed later with one for 488 complete tanks for Canada. However the Valentine was an infantry tank and Canada required a cruiser tank for its recently formed armoured division. In the end 1,420 Valentines were produced by CPR, most of which were supplied to the USSR. Although the Valentine used a number of American produced parts, its reliance on British components, difficulties in adapting its manufacture to North American methods, and other problems such as limitations to the availability of the right type of armour plate affected Valentine production. The Canadian Joint Committee on Tank Development concluded, in September 1940, that its cruiser tank should be based on a US rather than a British design. This would be quicker and allow it to use components already in production for the US design.\n\nThe Canadians were interested in production of the M3 Medium. However the M3 was an interim design; its main armament was in a side sponson, it was tall and under-armoured, and it was clear that it would be unsatisfactory for Canadian and British use. In early 1941 the Canadian Interdepartmental Tank Committee adopted a compromise: to develop a superior design locally but still using the M3 chassis. The British Tank Mission which was involved in the modifications of the M3 for British use contributed a tank expert, L.E. Carr, to design a new hull and turret for the Canadian tank which could take a 6-pounder (57 mm) or 75mm gun while retaining the lower hull of the US M3 Medium.\n\nThe new hull was cast rather than welded or riveted and lower than that of the M3. The pilot model's turret and upper hull casting was produced in the US by General Steel Castings and later they aided the set up of Canadian production. Montreal Locomotive Works (MLW) was chosen to make the new Canadian M.3 Cruiser Tank (as it was then known) and was given the funding to set up the \"Canadian Tank Arsenal\" at Longue Pointe. MLW was a subsidiary of the American Locomotive Company, which had experience in producing large castings and another ALCO subsidiary was producing cast hulls for the M3 Medium.\n\nCanadian engineers ran into many challenges when developing the tank as Canada had never produced a tank before. Along with the lack of knowledge, it took time for Canadian factories to gear up for the production of many of the Ram's components. Initially Canada relied heavily on United States and British materials to complete the construction of the Ram. Most critically the Ram's Continental engine and transmissions were available only in the USA and these were always in short supply. The Ram tank was developed with a turret which unlike the US M3 could traverse the main armament 360 degrees. Its fully cast armoured steel hull gave reinforced protection and, with the driver's seat repositioned to meet British requirements for right-hand drive, lower height; while the U.S.-designed chassis and power train ensured its overall reliability.\n\nAlthough it could mount a US 75 mm gun, the preferred armament for the Ram was the QF 6 pounder which had superior armour-piercing capability. As neither the 6 pounder nor the Canadian-designed mounting for it was immediately available, early production (50 tanks) were fitted with the 40 mm QF 2-pounder gun.\n\nA prototype Ram was completed in June 1941 and general production of the Ram I began in November of the same year. The Ram I and early Ram IIs were fitted with side doors in the hull and an auxiliary machine gun turret in the front. The former weakened the hull and complicated production, and the doors and the machine gun turret were discarded in later modifications. By February 1942 production had switched to the Ram II model with a 6-pounder gun and continued until July 1943. In March 1942 a decision had been made to change production over to the automotively-similar M4A1 Sherman tank for all British and Canadian units. Ram production continued due to delay in starting the new M4 production lines and a reluctance to let the plant lie idle. By July 1943 1,948 vehicles plus 84 artillery observation post (OP) vehicles had been completed.\n\nThe official Canadian history of the war compares the Ram to the Ross rifle as examples of unsuccessful Canadian weapon designs. It states that given the Sherman's superiority, in retrospect it would probably have been better for the United States to produce more tanks, and for Canada to have focused on manufacturing more transport vehicles such as the successful Canadian Military Pattern truck designs. The Sexton self-propelled gun based on the Ram chassis, however, was very successful.\n\nAs built, the Ram was never used in combat as a tank, but was used for crew training in Great Britain up to mid 1944. The observation post vehicles and Armoured Personnel Carrier, gun tractor, and munitions carrier versions of the Ram saw considerable active service in North West Europe. These tanks were mainly rebuilt by Canadian Army workshops in the United Kingdom. Conversions of Ram tanks with the Wasp II flamethrower gear were used by the 5th Canadian Armoured Brigade in the Netherlands in 1945.\nIn 1945 the Royal Netherlands Army got permission from the Canadian government to take free possession of all Ram tanks in army dumps on Dutch territory. Those not already converted into Kangaroos were used to equip the 1st and 2nd Tank Battalion (\"1e en 2e Bataljon Vechtwagens\"), the very first Dutch tank units. These had a nominal organic strength of 53 each. However it proved to be impossible to ready enough tanks to attain this strength because the vehicles were in a very poor state of maintenance. In 1947 the UK provided 44 Ram tanks from its stocks, that were in a better condition. Forty of these had been rebuilt with the British 75 mm gun; four were OP/Command vehicles with a dummy gun. This brought the operational total for that year to just 73, including two Mark Is. In 1950 only fifty of these were listed as present. The Ram tanks (together with the Sherman tanks of the three other tank battalions, in part simply taken without permission) were replaced by Centurion tanks leased by the U.S. Government in 1952. Some Ram tanks were used in the 1950s as static pillboxes in the IJssel Line, their hulls dug in and embedded within two feet of concrete.\n\nOne Dutch Ram tank, an OP/Command vehicle, survives at the Dutch Cavalry Museum in Amersfoort.\n\nA Ram tank modified as a Kangaroo serves as a memorial to the 1st Canadian Armoured Carrier Regiment in Mill, Netherlands.\n\nRam tanks can also be seen at the Canadian War Museum, in Worthington Park at Canadian Forces Base Borden, in front of the Beatty Street Drill Hall in Vancouver, and at the Bovington Tank Museum (both a tank and a Kangaroo)\n\n\nIn addition, a Ram was used in an attempt to produce a self-propelled QF 3.7 inch AA gun but got no further than testing.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1881745", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1881745", "title": "Yagyū Shinkage-ryū", "text": "Yagyū Shinkage-ryū\n\nAt the time of its founding by Kamiizumi Nobutsuna, the superiority of a school was determined through duels. Basic postures were distinct; a very low stance was maintained, in the interest of protecting the body. The idea of winning at any price was deeply ingrained in the schools of the time, as were the concepts of \"Isatsu-no-tachi\" (the school of the sword that kills only once) or \"Ichi-no-tachi\" (the sword of only one cut). A great deal of importance was placed on the technology of swords and armor themselves. However, with the arrival of muskets (arquebuses) and other elements of modern warfare, these traditionally invincible techniques were no longer sufficient.\n\nNobutsuna, with the creation of the Shinkage-ryū (New Shadow School), changed basic postures by raising them slightly. He also changed the manner of holding the sword. The swords themselves were changed; in an era in which a sword could be two meters, Nobutsuna shortened the length of the blade. Most importantly, he perfected a new method of teaching to make the study and practice of the Way of the Sword easier. Before Nobutsuna, practice was carried out with either a very hard wooden sword (a \"bokken\") or one with a dulled steel blade. The practitioners had to therefore stop their blows during teaching to avoid hurting themselves or their students. It is claimed that Kamiizumi created the practice sword called the \"fukuro shinai\" (frog bamboo sword), which is made of strips of bamboo similar to a kendo shinai but covered inside a leather pouch. The shinai allowed striking with quickness, fluidity and potency without causing serious or disabling wounds as one would with the wooden sword, and without having to stop the attacks.\n\nNobutsuna, sensing the changes in the ways of war at the time, re-thought his methods of martial arts (\"bujutsu\"), and began to advocate the utilization of light armour during training. The face of war was being transformed, and as it was necessary to move faster than before. Nobutsuna perfected a style of sword fighting that was freer in its movements, more sparse, more restrained, more adapted to brawls and to duels, than to the fields of large scale battles.\n\nNobutsuna created the ancient schools of sword known as \"satsujin-ken\", or the killing swords. These are characterized by postures and offensive techniques, designed to win at any price. He wanted to establish \"tatsujin-ken\"—the sword of an accomplished man, an Expert. The art of the sword of the Shinkage school takes into account and adapts to the opponent's weaponry, contrary to the former sword styles which taught to impose dominance without taking into account the opponent.\n\nThe strategy of the Shinkage school takes into account the geography of the terrain, the hour of battle, and other parameters. For instance, to utilize the technique named \"empi\", one must understand a deeper, secret level (\"gokui\") of battle. In \"empi\", (meaning, the \"Swallow takes Flight\") one uses a technique of spearing an opponent with a thrown sword. To do this, one learns to use the sword not only to defend his position but to also have the \"power of adaptability\" in facing different individuals, much as a captain must consider the winds and change sails in order to travel in the best direction to reach his objective. It is similar to a hunting hawk, which must constantly reconsider the best trajectory in which to strike effectively. Like the raptor, it is necessary to be able to anticipate, to be able to assess and definitively act. \"Move with the mind, in order to move with the body\" is one of the central tenets of the school. Another sword style is called \"Katsujin-ken\" (the One who preserves Life, the Sword of the Victor). \"Katsujin-ken\" teaches that, if one's sword does not stop the movement of the enemy, then one may try to fit to the \"opponent's\" rhythm, thus entering into the mind of the adversary to find his weakness.\n\nThe feudal lord Kamiizumi Nobutsuna led a simple life. Although he was not a monk, he kept his head shaved, which was a sign of renunciation of the everyday world. He did not have children and left all his property to his student Yagyū Munetoshi. Munetoshi had gained his own renown as a remarkable swordsman even before Nobutsuna's passing. He began development of the \"mutō\" techniques of using bare hands against the sword and it is he who appended the name of his family (Yagyū) onto the name of the school, founding the Yagyū Shinkage-ryū. \"His\" son, Yagyū Munenori, later perfected the techniques of \"mutō\", and also created the techniques of \"iaijutsu\".\n\nUpon Munetoshi's death in 1606, the school split into two. His grandson Yagyū Toshiyoshi took command of the Owari branch, while Munenori became the head of the Edo branch. Takenaga Hayato, the founder of the Yagyū Shingan Ryū Heiho was a student and received the gokui of the Yagyū Shinkage-ryū under Yagyū Munenori. The Edo branch, although no longer headed by a descendant of the Yagyū family, continues to be practiced by a small, faithful group of practitioners in Osaka under the direction of Sono Seigo. The Owari branch of Nagoya continues under the guidance of a direct descendant of Munetoshi, Yagyū Kōichi Toshinobu.\n\nMunenori's son, Yagyū Jūbei Mitsuyoshi, contributed greatly, in turn, to the school. He was not only a master of sword, but also a strategist, an expert of \"jujutsu-yawara\", \"ninjutsu\", \"kempō\" and an ascetic who went on musha shugyō, the warrior's ascetic journey. His sword technique was named \"chie-no-ken\" (sword of Transcendent Wisdom).\n\nThe one who codified the techniques of the Yagyū Shinkage-ryū into its traditional form was the fifth \"soke\" (heir), Yagyū Toshikane. He codified all the basic instruction (\"kihon-waza\") into a document known as \"Hassei-hō\" or more commonly \"Sei-hō\". These series were responsible for making understood the essential points of forms (\"kata\") that had been transmitted by Munenori. Before the advent of modern \"kendō\", he created a form of free fighting in teaching with \"shinai\".\n\nLatter, the 5th Sōke, Yagyū Renya and his father, the 3rd headmaster Hyōgonosuke, invented the concept of \"Tsuttattaru-mi\" (art of war without armor) to adapt their style to the current era where samurai would fight in civilian clothes, unlike orthodox Katori Shintō-ryū whose students always fight with samurai armor protection and weak points in mind, even when they don't wear one for training. \n\nThen came the Meiji era, where all martial arts schools had trouble to continue to exist. Many faded away, especially little schools started by rōnin trying to make a living, and \"Ishi-Sōden\" family arts. But Meiji-Tennō directly ordered to Yagyū Toshichika-sōke to permanently preserve the Yagyū Shinkage-ryū, and so he did. The 20th headmaster, Toshinaga, even moved to Tokyo and became the instructor to the Imperial Guards and taught in Butokukai seminars in order to spread further Shinkage-ryū. \n\nThe Owari dōjō in Nagoya who existed since Edo period burned down in the World War Two, but the school managed to survive because of that.\n\nNakai Masakatsu (中井 正勝, fl. 1891–1908), a teacher whose own teachers had been proficient in Shinkage-ryū and Yagyū Shingan Ryū Taijutsu, taught these arts to Morihei Ueshiba (the founder of aikido) from 1903 to 1908, in his dojo in Sakai near Osaka. At the time, Ueshiba was serving in the 61st Regiment in the Japanese Army. In 1908 Masakatsu gave Ueshiba a mid level license in Gotōha Yagyū Shingan Ryū Taijutsu.\n\nYagyū Shinkage-ryū was also taught in the United States from 1981-1988 by Yagyu Hideki. The authority to teach the art was given to Hideki's student-turned-adopted-son who runs a school near Kobe, Japan, and to his two top American students—one of whom (as of 2005) resides in China where he teaches the art, and the other in the United States who, as of 2012, is in training to return to teaching. Only Hideki's son and two top American students were issued permission to teach the art to anyone else.\n\nThe Edo branch has a United States representative under Sono Seigo with permission to teach the art. Paul Manogue runs a group out of Philadelphia in Old City Aikido.\n\nMainline\n\nEdo line\n\nOther Branches\n\"Kogenshakai\"\n\"Shūnpūkan\"\n\"Arakidō\"\n\n\"Marobashikai\"\n\n\n"}

Eads was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 1996, but as an example of the social stigma faced by gender variant individuals, more than a dozen doctors refused to medically treat him on the grounds that taking him on as a patient might harm their practice. When he was finally accepted for treatment in 1997 the cancer had \"already metastasized to other parts of the body, rendering any further treatments futile.\"\n\nEads began transitioning in his forties, after a marriage to a man and after having borne two children. Eads later described being pregnant as \"the best and the worst (time) in my life,\" as he was thrilled by the feeling of having another life grow inside him, but was also disgusted by the fact that his pregnancy made him as a trans man feel even more \"trapped\" inside his female body. He divorced his husband after the birth of their second son, and presented for some time as a lesbian, though he would later point out that he always viewed his attraction to women as the product of being a heterosexual man rather than a homosexual woman. \n\nEads began transitioning in the late 1980s following a move to Florida. He began testosterone therapy and underwent top surgery, in which breast tissue is removed, to create a male physique. However, given his age (early- to mid-40s) as well as the fact that he had already begun to show symptoms of menopause, Eads was counseled that he would not need to undergo a hysterectomy and oophorectomy as part of his sexual reassignment. Likewise, Eads never underwent phalloplasty. After living in Florida for some time, and following the failure of his second marriage (to a female psychologist), Eads moved back to Georgia in 1996.\n\nIn 1996, after a severe bout of abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding, Eads sought emergency medical treatment, and received a diagnosis of ovarian cancer. However, more than a dozen doctors subsequently refused to treat Eads on the grounds that taking him on as a patient might harm their practice.\n\nIt was not until 1997 that Eads was finally accepted for treatment by the Medical College of Georgia hospital, where he underwent surgical, medical, and radiation therapy over the next year.

They compete in the Isle of Man Football League Division Two. They wear tangerine and black strips and play home games at the Andreas Playing Fields in Andreas village.\n\nThe club was formed on 10 April 1967, and applied to play in the Isle of Man Football League Division Two for the 1967–68 season. They finished their first season on just four points. However, within two season they had their first trophy\nwhen they won the Woods Cup and the Fred Faragher Cup. The club have been Division Two champions four times. They were first promoted in 1976–77. After being promoted in 1986–87 they stayed in Division One and achieved the club's highest league placing in 1988–89 when they were Division One runners-up. In the 1995–96 season they finished as runners-up to the Police in Division Two and won both the Woods Cup and the Paul Henry Gold Cup. The club's highest achievement came in the 2002–03 season when they won the Manx FA Cup at The Bowl stadium in Douglas, beating St Georges 2–1. In the 2004–05 season they finished third in Division One.\n\nAs 2019 draws to an end, the last decade for Ayre United, to say the least can be classed as turbulent. The club started the decade in strong form winning the Woods Cup in 12/13 season, however that turned out to be the high point of the clubs recent history. As the midpoint of the decade arrived the Ayre United was arguably at the lowest point in the club's lucrative 50+ year history. As the legendary FA cup winning players came to the end of their careers, Ayre struggled fielding teams often having to forfeit game after game. The true extent of the struggle to field a team became apparent when even cult hero, Liam \"Lugsy\" Lord racked up some appearances. Despite this in the past two years, \"the Tangerines\" have begun their ascend from darkness. A combination of players returning to the club, upcoming exciting youth players, and top draw management has gave the club a new feeling of hope. The inside view is that the next decade will see a new group of players put their names into the history books. They currently aspire to compete in the Premier League next season.\n\nThe first clubhouse was an old RAF hut transported from Jurby airfield and opened in 1968. This was replaced and a new clubhouse opened at Easter, 1999. Ayre United were the first club on the Isle of Man to have floodlights, which were installed in 1972. A new club bar was opened on 28 May 2006. The club hope to build new changing facilities. The clubhouse is nicknamed the \"Fortress\". Rumour has it whenever the club attacks the infamous \"sh*thouse end\" in the second half in need of a result, something magical happens.\n\nAs well as the first team Ayre United also have reserves team that plays in the Isle of Man Football Combination captained by the mighty Ben Ashworth as well a women's team captained by James Bucuris and various age range teams from Under-7s to Under-17s. Despite an average age of 24, they have some freakishly good future prospects. To name some names the infamous Burger (Ryan Teare) aged 18, renowned for his vicious left peg. Alongside him another exciting young player Chesney (a prolific youth attacker), also known as Deacon Lombard-Chibnall.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1881770", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1881770", "title": "Braddan A.F.C.", "text": "Braddan A.F.C.\n\nBraddan A.F.C. is a football club in Douglas on the Isle of Man, competing in the Isle of Man Football League. The team wears royal blue strips and plays home games at Cronkbourne Football Ground, Victoria Road, Douglas.\n\nBraddan Association Football Club was founded in 1923 under the Chairmanship of Mr Frederick Clucas (later Sir Frederick), and was admitted to play in the Second League for their inaugural season. A playing pitch was established on land owned by Clucas’ Laundry at Cronkbourne, Tromode, which was to be the club's home until 1995. Owing to the close links with the company which were to last for several decades, the club was soon nicknamed ‘The Laundrymen’. Blue was chosen as the club colour.\n\nBraddan's first competitive match was played on 20 October 1923 and resulted in a 6-2 victory at home to Ramsey-based club St Olave's. The team never looked back, and won the Second League title by a convincing margin in that first season. The club received great praise in the local press during the season, not only for the quality of the football played by the team but also for the standard of the pitch and surroundings at Cronkbourne.\n\nIn that era of Manx football there was no automatic promotion and relegation, but Braddan's application to play in the First League was duly accepted for the 1924/25 season, with the reserve team playing in the Second League. Several years of consolidation in the top flight of Manx football followed, and Braddan's progress attracted a steady stream of quality footballers to the club. Prominent players in the club's early years were Alan Doig, a Scotsman who was a prolific goal scorer, and goalkeeper Leslie Evans - a renowned figure in Manx sport.\n\nIn the 1929/30 season Braddan secured their first major trophy, being crowned First League champions after a magnificent campaign. It was a brilliant achievement to reach the summit of Manx football just seven years into the club's existence, and the team remained unbeaten until the last two games of the campaign - by which time they had already secured the title. This was to be the beginning of a decade of great success, during which Braddan became part of what was dubbed by the press ‘The Eternal Triangle’ of trophy winners alongside Peel and Rushen United.\n\nThe First League title was retained in the 1930/31 season, when Braddan also won their first cup with a 2-0 triumph over local rivals Gymns in the Railway Cup Final played at Port St Mary. Both goals were scored by team captain Wally Noble. The Railway Cup was retained the following year when four goals from legendary centre-forward Tim Tickle gave Braddan a 4-2 success over Ramsey at Peel.\n\nTim Tickle was probably the finest player ever to pull on the blue shirt of Braddan, and such was his ability that in 1935 he left the island to play a season as a professional for Coleraine in Northern Ireland. Despite playing in a struggling team he scored 25 goals, and he was asked to stay on the following season. However he opted to return home, and resumed his career with Braddan having relinquished his professional status. In all it was estimated that he scored around 500 goals for his only local club during a career that lasted into the 1950s. He could score goals from all angles and was a superb header of the ball. His trademark was to receive the ball on the halfway line with his back to goal, turn his marker, surge forward and crack the ball into the net with power and accuracy from the edge of the penalty area.\n\nBraddan won the Hospital Cup for the first time in 1936 with a 4-1 win over St George's at Tromode Park, helped by a hat-trick from another of Braddan best-ever players, outside left Henry Charlier. With Tim Tickle restored to the ranks for the 1936/37 season Braddan retained the Hospital Cup with a 5-1 thumping of Ramsey at Tromode Park (Tickle scoring twice), and were also crowned First League champions for the third time following a controversial and stormy victory at Peel in the final game. A decision to award Braddan a decisive penalty late in the game resulted in the referee and Braddan's FA Executive member needing a police escort from the ground to protect them from an angry mob.\n\nThe 1937/38 season was the greatest in Braddan's history, and at the end of it three major trophies adorned the Clucas’ Laundry boardroom. Playing highly skilful football they won their fourth First League title, and regained the Railway Cup with a magnificent 3-0 win over their greatest rivals Peel at Port St Mary. Two goals from Charlier and one from Tickle sealed Braddan's success on New Year's Day in front of a crowd of around 3,000. For the only time in the club's history Braddan secured the FA Cup, again beating Peel in the final which was played at Tromode Park. A penalty save by goalkeeper Bernard Fick was the catalyst for Braddan to surge into a 3-0 lead, with two goals from Tickle and a penalty from skipper George Bridson. Peel's late rally brought the score to 3-2, but Braddan held on to complete their greatest triumph. Only a narrow defeat in the Hospital Cup final – yet again Peel were the opponents – prevented Braddan from achieving the grand slam.\n\nThe 1938/39 season ended in disappointment and controversy. Braddan played arguably their best ever football during this campaign, and were unbeaten in the league with one match to play. That match was against their only challengers Peel, with Braddan needing just a draw to be crowned champions for the fifth time. The clubs failed to agree a suitable date for the game, which was eventually set to be played before the start of the 1939/40 season. Following the outbreak of War the match was never played, and the title was not awarded – denying Braddan a potential hat-trick of league titles.\n\nDuring a decade plagued by regular controversy and bitterness in Manx football – usually involving Peel - Braddan was consistently acknowledged as a club that displayed great sportsmanship as well as footballing talent. Many Braddan players were regulars in the senior Isle of Man team throughout the 1930s. Mr Thomas ‘Tossie’ Clucas, a leading figure in establishing Braddan as a top club in Manx football, was also a highly respected representative for the club at the Isle of Man Football Association, where he served as Vice President for many years and was later elevated to President.\n\nThe club closed down for the duration of War, but re-established in 1945. Many of the successful pre-War players returned, and Braddan reached the finals of both Cup competitions played that season. The FA Cup Final against Peel at KGV Park in Douglas resulted in a 1-1 draw, before Peel won the replay 2-1 at the same venue. The attendances for the two matches were 4,300 and 4,290 – the two highest attendances ever recorded for matches between two local clubs. It was Braddan's day in the Hospital Cup Final though, when they gained revenge on Peel with a 3-2 win at KGV Park, the goals coming from three pre-War heroes Percy Beedon, Alf Craine (penalty) and Tim Tickle.\n\nOver the next few years the team gradually declined as age caught up with many of the great players from the 1930s. A brief return to former glories came with another FA Cup Final in 1951. Braddan put up a great fight against Rushen in front of another huge crowd of 3,600 at KGV Park, but a last-minute goal gave the southerners a 2-1 victory.\n\nBraddan's first relegation followed in 1952, but by then the club was building for the future with a strong youth policy which was rewarded by winning the Cowell Cup that same season. Braddan bounced straight back to the big time, winning the Division 2 title at the first attempt and doubling up by also securing the Hospital Cup which was contested by Division 2 clubs that season. The leading scorers were two of the stars of the previous season's Cowell Cup triumph, Brian Simpson and George ‘Jinx’ Caine. The latter, a speedy and skilful outside right, had already been selected for the senior IOM team at just 17 years of age, and the following season he was signed by Stockport County where he played for the next two seasons.\n\nThe 1st Team made a wonderful start to the 1953/54 season on their return to Division 1. They won five of their opening seven league matches, scoring 40 goals, and received great acclaim for the quality of their attacking play. They ultimately had to settle for a sixth-place finish, and over the next few years they steadily consolidated their top flight status. In 1955 it was the turn of the Combination team to take the limelight as they brought the Junior Cup to Cronkbourne for the first time. They beat Ramsey 1-0 in the Final which was played at Onchan Stadium.\n\nThe latter half of the 1950s was dominated by problems and tragedy off the field. In May 1956 the club pavilion, which dated back to pre-War days when cricket was also played on the ground, was destroyed by fire along with much of the club's property. A loan from the Isle of Man Football Association enabled the club to purchase a second-hand sectional building, which was assembled by club members and made ready for use as a clubhouse late in 1957. It served as the club's headquarters until 1988.\n\nA dark day in the history of Braddan Football Club, and of the Isle of Man, came on 27 February 1958. Four club members – Tom Callow, Louis Cowin, Arthur Gleave and Arthur Tonkin - died in the Winter Hill air disaster which claimed a total of 35 Manx lives. The charter aircraft was taking local businessmen, mainly from the motor trade but also some from Clucas’ Laundry, on a day trip to Manchester to visit the Exide Battery Factory. A tragic navigational error in thick mist led to the aircraft crashing close to the summit of Winter Hill above Horwich, Lancashire. A memorial plaque to the four lost members is on permanent display in Braddan's clubhouse.\n\nThe 1960s was a decade of optimism, innovation and a new identity. In 1962 a club badge was designed and this was displayed on the team's shirts from the start of the 1962/63 season. It featured a motif of a swan and a football, inspired by the family of swans that inhabited the dam and river adjacent to the home pitch at Cronkbourne. A match report in the local press dubbed Braddan ‘The Swans’, and the new nickname was adopted and has been used ever since.\n\nIn the early part of the decade it was the Combination team who provided the excitement. During that era and up until 1967, the Combination teams were split into two regional leagues, with the champions of the North and South divisions playing a decider – effectively a Cup Final - for the Combination league title. Braddan reached the decider three seasons in a row as ‘southern’ champions. In 1961/62 they lost to Peel, but gained revenge on the westerners with a 3-2 victory after extra time to clinch the title in 1962/63. That season was doubly successful as Braddan landed the Junior Cup for the second time, beating Laxey 4-0 in the final played at the Bowl. The following year they drew 3-3 with Ramsey after extra time in the league decider, so the title was shared.\n\nThe 1st Team made a steady start to the decade, but in 1963/64 they enjoyed their best league season since the halcyon days of the 1930s. They finished in fourth place in Division 1, indeed challenging for the title for much of the season. The following four seasons were something of an anti-climax as the team returned to the lower reaches of the table, but in 1968 Braddan became one of the first clubs in Manx football to engage a manager to take charge of football matters. Wilf Southern was appointed to the position, and the effect was immediate. The 1st Team, fitter and better organised, rose to a fifth-place finish in the 1968/69 season, and club stalwart Artie Kewley was named IOM Footballer of the Year – the only Braddan player to date to receive this honour.\n\nThe 1969/70 season was magnificent as Braddan suggested that they could finally recapture some of the glories of the 1930s. The 1st team finished third in Division 1, the highest position attained since the War, while the Combination team won both the Combination 1 league title and the Junior Cup, the latter with a 3-1 victory over St George's in the final at Castletown.\n\nThere was real optimism that the 1970s could be the decade when Braddan returned to the top of Manx football, but it was not to be. The decade in fact proved to be the most turbulent in Braddan's history with three relegations, three promotions, a sponsorship deal, and some shock news from Clucas’ Laundry over the club's future tenancy of the Cronkbourne pitch.\n\nBy this stage of Braddan's history the very close links between the club and the laundry had diminished, and in 1972 the club was first informed that the football field had been assigned by the company for future industrial development. At any stage from then onwards, the club could be given three months’ notice to leave the site. This was the beginning of what were to be 23 years of uncertainty and frustration before the club finally vacated the pitch and became established at a new venue.\n\nIt was a difficult time on the pitch too as the first team dropped from third place to bottom in two seasons, and were relegated in 1972. The Combination team won the Combination 2 title the following season as the 1st Team narrowly missed promotion, but Braddan bounced back to the top flight in style in 1974 as convincing Division 2 champions after a wonderful season.\n\nAfter a promising return to the big time, another relegation followed in 1975/76, but that season will be best remembered for Braddan producing one of the most famous FA Cup upsets of all time with a sensational 4-3 home win over Peel in the quarter final. The western side had been nigh-on unbeatable in Manx football for several years and this was one of the most celebrated results in Braddan's history.\n\nThere was another revival in 1976/77 as a fine league season saw Braddan promoted once again. The highlight of that season however was the club's first success in the Woods Cup. A superb individual goal from 16-year-old Stewart Cain near the end sealed a sweet 2-0 triumph over local rivals Gymns in the final played at the Bowl.\n\nThe following season brought bitter disappointment as Braddan were relegated again on goal difference despite picking up 14 points from 20 games under the two points for a win system. Just one point separated the five teams fighting to avoid the second relegation spot, and the battle went to the last kick of the season.\n\nA further promotion followed in the 1978/79 season when club captain Neil Mackie was named Division 2 Player of the Year. The reserves were runaway winners of the Combination 2 title, and Braddan's crop of promising teenagers reached the Cowell Cup Final. That match, played at Peel, was ultimately won 4-3 by St George's – but Braddan played a full part in what was hailed as one of the best and most exciting games seen in Manx football for years. During that season the club also secured its first sponsorship deal with Howstrake & Highlander Hotels, and following a relaxation of IOMFA rules the company's logo was allowed to be displayed on the club's shirts and on an advertising banner at the pitch.\n\nSeveral top players were signed in the summer of 1979, and under the management of long-time goalkeeper Malcolm Macdonald, the 1st team made a magnificent start to the 1979/80 season back in Division 1. They played some brilliant free-scoring football, and became the first Braddan side since 1963 to qualify for the Railway Cup semi-finals. They also reached the Hospital Cup semi-final and finished fifth in Division 1, while the Combination team finished in fourth place. Four Braddan players - goalkeeper Peter Corris, centre-back Neil Mackie, midfielder Keith Kermeen and striker Chris Bass - were selected for the senior Isle of Man squad.\n\nThe 1980s was a tough decade for the club, during which footballing matters were to become secondary to the problems of developing and funding a new ground. Clucas’ Laundry continued to allow the club the use of the Cronkbourne pitch on a season-by-season basis through the decade as an economic downturn had stalled their plans to develop the site. The club had taken out a lease on land owned by IOM Sports Council between Glencrutchery Road and Victoria Road in Douglas, but this land needed much work to be made ready for use as a football pitch and a clubhouse was still to be built. The many difficulties encountered with the development and funding of the new site were to threaten the very existence of the club over the following 15 years.\n\nOn the field, the great promise of the 1979/80 season was sadly not sustained and relegation followed in 1982. The Combination 2 title was secured for the third time in the 1982/83 season, but the 1st team missed out on promotion. The club bounced back in fine style in 1984/85, winning both the Division 2 and Combination 2 titles and returning to the top flight after a three-year absence. \n\nA piece of history was made in 1985 as for the first time a junior Braddan team was established, entering the Under-14 league in the 1985/86 season. For the next three seasons the 1st team worked very hard to maintain their Division 1 status, and achieved a seventh-place finish in the 1986/87 season. \n\nFollowing a decade of preparation, Braddan announced that the club would move to its new venue from the start of the 1988/89 season. The ground was named ‘Cronkbourne’ in order to preserve historical links with the original pitch, and a temporary changing facility was erected to be used until a clubhouse had been constructed.\n\nThe historic first match on the new ground was played against neighbours St George's on 17 September 1988, but it was already clear that the drainage system installed by a local contractor was inadequate. No further games could be played on the pitch, and Braddan spent two seasons as ‘nomads’ playing on pitches hired from Douglas Corporation. It was a very difficult and disappointing time for the club, compounded by financial problems through crippling loan repayments associated with the new ground. It was perhaps inevitable in such circumstances that the club suffered relegation at the end of the season after four seasons in the top division.\n\nAs a new decade dawned there was a welcome boost in the form of another Combination 2 title win in the 1989/90 season, and later that summer Clucas’ Laundry agreed to the club making a short-term return to the Cronkbourne pitch. By that stage the clubhouse on the site had been destroyed, and portable units were installed on site to provide essential facilities. The pitch, vacant for over two years, was soon restored to good condition, and the club was to play there for five more seasons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

She is the third vessel of the United States Navy to be so named after the concept of freedom. She is the design competitor produced by the Lockheed Martin consortium, in competition with the General Dynamics–designed . She was officially accepted by the Supervisor of Shipbuilding Gulf Coast on behalf of the US Navy from the Lockheed Martin/Marinette Marine/Gibbs and Cox team in Marinette, Wisconsin on 18 September 2008.\n\nShe is designed for a variety of missions in shallow waters, minesweeping and humanitarian relief, capable against submarines and small ships, but not designed to take on large warships. The ship is a semi-planing monohull design capable of over .\n\nCommissioned in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on 8 November 2008, USS \"Freedom\" is home-ported in San Diego, and assigned to Littoral Combat Ship Squadron One.\n\nUSS \"Freedom\" is the first of two dramatically different LCS designs being produced; the other, , is a trimaran built by a team led by General Dynamics' Bath Iron Works and Austal USA in Mobile, Alabama. USS \"Freedom\" is designed to be a fast, maneuverable and networked surface combatant for missions such as anti-mine warfare, anti-submarine warfare, surface warfare and humanitarian relief.\n\nThe ship is a semi-planing steel monohull with an aluminum superstructure. The friction stir welded aluminum deckhouse is very flat which, combined with an angular design, makes it difficult for radar systems to detect. The ship is in length, displaces fully loaded and can exceed .\n\nThe design incorporates a large reconfigurable seaframe to allow rapidly interchangeable mission modules, a flight deck with integrated helicopter launch, recovery and handling system and the capability to launch and recover boats (manned and unmanned) from both the stern and side.\n\nThe flight deck is 1.5 times the size of that of a standard surface ship, and uses a Trigon traversing system to move helicopters in and out of the hangar. The ship has two ways to launch and recover various mission packages: a stern ramp and a starboard side door near the waterline. The mission module bay has a 3-axis crane for positioning modules or cargo. The fore deck has a modular weapons zone which can be used for a 57 mm gun turret or missile launcher. A Rolling Airframe Missile launcher is mounted above the hangar for short-range defense against aircraft and cruise missiles, and .50 caliber (12.7 mm) gun mounts are provided topside.\n\nThe core crew will be 40 sailors, usually joined by a mission package crew and an aviation detachment for a total crew of about 75. Automation allows a reduced crew, which greatly reduces operating costs, but workload can still be \"grueling.\"\n\nFour Fincantieri Isotta-Fraschini diesel generators provide of electrical power to power the ship systems.\n\n\"Freedom\" has relaxed stability so it can rapidly change course.\n\nThe operational concept includes deployment of a two or three-ship squadron to operate in the littorals to counter anti-access forces and to support the operations of the U.S. Navy and other friendly surface ships. The operational concept is in direct support of the U.S. Navy's Maritime Strategy, \"A Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century Seapower.\"\n\nPrincipal capabilities include shallow-water anti-submarine warfare, mine countermeasures and defense against attacking small boats. LCS ships are to be networked to share tactical information with other units. \"Freedom\" will be initially based in San Diego with two crews which will alternate four-month tours of sea duty.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimates that fuel will account for only \"8 percent to 18 percent\" of the total life-cycle costs for \"Freedom\". Senator Jeff Sessions has called the report into question and has suggested that \"Independence\", built in his state, would be more fuel efficient and that less frequent refuelings would affect military operations beyond the cost of fuel.\n\nThe construction contract was awarded to Lockheed Martin's LCS team (Lockheed Martin, Gibbs & Cox, Marinette Marine, Bollinger Shipyards) in May 2004. Her keel was laid down on 2 June 2005, by Marinette Marine in Marinette, Wisconsin. The ship was sponsored by Birgit Smith, the widow of United States Army Sergeant 1st Class Paul Ray Smith, who was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor in Operation Iraqi Freedom. Her initials are welded on the ship's keel. The couple's Saint Christopher medal and wedding bands are embedded in the ship's mast.\n\nUSS \"Freedom\" was christened on 23 September 2006, delivered to the Navy on 18 September 2008, and commissioned in Milwaukee on 8 November.\n\nCost overruns during \"Freedom\"s construction combined with projected future overruns led the government to issue a \"Stop-work\" in January 2007. On 25 April 2008 the \"New York Times\" ran a highly critical article, arguing that both \"Freedom\" and competitor \"Independence\" demonstrated a failure of the Navy's littoral combat ship program.\n\nPrior to delivery, the U.S. Navy's Board of Inspection and Survey (INSURV) conducted acceptance trials aboard LCS-1, 17–21 August. INSURV found the ship to be \"capable, well-built and inspection-ready\" and recommended that the Chief of Naval Operations authorize delivery of the ship. Because the trials were conducted in Lake Michigan, some ship systems, including aviation and combat systems, could not be demonstrated. Systems not demonstrated during recent trials will be presented to INSURV in early 2009 trials in Norfolk and in the open ocean. The inspection discovered 2,600 total discrepancies, of which 21 were considered high-priority deficiencies.\n\n\"As part of LCS 1 acceptance trials, the Navy’s Board of Inspection and Survey (INSURV) identified 21 critical “starred” deficiencies and recommended the Chief of Naval Operations authorize delivery of LCS-1 after correction or waiver of these deficiencies. According to Navy officials, only 9 of these deficiencies were corrected prior to delivery. Navy officials report that transiting the ship away from Marinette, Wisconsin, prior to the winter freeze was a higher priority than timely correction of starred deficiencies. The Navy intends to correct remaining deficiencies during planned post-delivery maintenance availabilities.\"\n\nOne of the issues with the ship is that it is six percent overweight and therefore more likely to sink if damaged. This seems to have been caused by design changes during construction. The Navy says that the ship will require special operating procedures until this is corrected. The workaround selected will be to install external tanks for additional buoyancy. The Navy stated that LCS-1 now meets the damage stability requirement with the addition of the external tanks and that the design of includes additional stability improvements.\n\nOther issues include difficulty with the slow speed operations required for deep sea refueling, no ability to UNREP other supplies aboard other than by helicopter, and problems with side-door launches of remotely operated vehicles.\n\nOn 12 June 2009, the Navy confirmed that CNO Roughead had ordered a study of an early deployment of \"Freedom\", before the expected date of 2012. Anonymous sources inside Lockheed Martin reported that Roughead wanted to use the first LCS to patrol for pirates off the coast of Somalia.\n\nOn 13 October 2009, the Department of Defense announced \"Freedom\" would be deployed two years ahead of schedule. For this deployment 20 additional sailors will be carried for Visit, Board, Search, and Seizure operations in two shipping containers in the mission module cargo area. These containers will not include sanitary facilities, so they will be forced to use the ones in the ship's berthing spaces. About half of the 20 member boarding team will be temporarily replaced with United States Coast Guard law enforcement officers for some portion of the deployment. John C. Harvey, Jr. said that while the deployment was a success, manning may need adjustment.\n\nIn her limited time at sea, \"Freedom\" has been \"plagued by flawed designs and failed equipment since being commissioned, has at least 17 known cracks, and has repeatedly been beset by engine-related failures.\"\n\nOn 15 February 2010, \"Freedom\" set sail from Naval Station Mayport on its first deployment to support SOUTHCOM operations. On 22 February, off the coast of Colombia, the ship pursued a possible drug-running boat. The boat fled back into Colombian coastal waters and \"Freedom\"s crew recovered ton of cocaine that had been dumped overboard by the boat's crew.\n\nOn 4 April 2010 \"Freedom\" entered the 3rd Fleet area of responsibility; carrying Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron 22, Det. 2, a LCS Surface Warfare Mission Package, and a U.S. Coast Guard Law Enforcement Detachment.\n\nShe was expected to be dry docked in San Diego’s Nassco shipyard so that her outer starboard waterjet could be replaced.\n\nOn 12 September 2010, the starboard Rolls-Royce MT30 gas turbine broke down and the ship had to rely on her diesel engines to return to port. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Gary Roughead said that the media had overhyped the issue and that such breakdowns were not uncommon.\n\nDuring a heavy-weather ocean trial in February 2011, the ship developed a crack in its hull that leaked of water an hour. The Navy proceeded to investigate, the problem appearing to be due to faulty welds rather than a design error. The repairs were scheduled to begin on 27 June 2011, and last until 19 September.\n\nOn February 2012, \"Freedom\" suffered minor flooding while underway off Southern California. An inflatable boot seal was deployed in a successful effort to contain the flooding, and the ship returned to San Diego on its own power. This marked a return to the dry dock before the ship even completed its last post-repair shakedown. A \"special trial\" conducted in May 2012 found the ship fit for the deployment.\n\nIn July 2012, \"Freedom\" was dry docked in order to expand berthing by 20 and for firefighting and boat handling improvements. After another docking to apply a new paint scheme and apply another fix for the aft ramp, she departed for Singapore with a core crew of 50 plus 3 trainees, plus a mission crew with berthing for 98. Additional crew above that level will again be bedded in the cargo spaces.\n\nOn 15 January 2013, the U.S. Defense Department's director of operational test and evaluation released a judgement of the LCS in an annual study. The report said that \"Freedom\" was \"not expected to be survivable\" in combat. Helicopters on board the ship cannot tow its mine-hunting sensors, so it must rely on unmanned systems for mine countermeasures, although those systems are not in service, and will not be for several years. Its 30 mm Mk44 Bushmaster IIs \"exhibit reliability problems.\" The Mk 110 57 mm gun is differently designed on the \"Freedom\" class, which cause vibrations at high speeds that make accurate firing difficult. The integrated weapons systems and air/surface search radar have “performance deficiencies” that affect the ship’s “tracking and engagement of contacts.”\n\nIn early 2013 the vessel took part in the National Geographic TV show \" INSIDE: 21ST CENTURY WARSHIP \" along with USS \"Independence\". \n\n\"Freedom\" left for a 10-month deployment to Singapore in March 2013. On 11 March 2013, \"Freedom\" became the first LCS to reach Hawaii. On 16 March while en route to Singapore, the ship briefly lost power when one of the diesel engines shut down. On 18 April, the \"Freedom\" arrived at the Changi Naval Base in Singapore, set to participate in joint military exercises. On 18–19 May, \"Freedom\" participated in the Republic of Singapore Navy's Open House 2013 at Changi Naval Base. Visitors to the Open House were allowed to board and visit \"Freedom\". On 21 May, \"Freedom\"s first venture from Singapore harbor was cut short by another equipment failure, followed on 20 July 2013 by another breakdown requiring a return to port. The frequent breakdowns found the crew short of the Navy's sleep requirement, even with the maximum possible core crew and help from contractors and the mission module crew. Although billed as a trip for training and international cooperation exercises, \"Freedom\" conducted standard patrols while in the South China Sea. Despite suffering several breakdowns, the deployment was deemed a success from a research and development platform standpoint; while deployed for 10 months, the ship had 70 percent availability, on par with most other forward deployed ships in the fleet.\n\nIn November 2013, \"Freedom\" delivered relief supplies to the Philippines in the wake of Typhoon Haiyan from off shore, using her own and another ship's helicopters.\n\nFrom 25 April-16 May 2014, \"Freedom\" conducted the future concept of operations (CONOPS) for manned and unmanned helicopters aboard littoral combat ships. Operations had the manned MH-60R working together with the unmanned MQ-8B Fire Scout. The demonstration included one MH-60R and one MQ-8B flying with the surface warfare (SUW) mission package installed, intended to provide fleet protection against small boats and asymmetric threats.\n\nIn March 2015, \"Freedom\" completed rough water trials to demonstrate seaworthiness and structural integrity, collecting data while operating in sea states 5 and 6 for 11 days.\n\nIn February 2020 it was announced that the Navy plans to retire \"Freedom\" and its sister ship \"Fort Worth\" after 12 and 8 years of service respectively.\n\nNotes\nReferences\n\n"}

{"id": "1881800", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1881800", "title": "Pete Tyler", "text": "Pete Tyler\n\nPeter Alan Tyler is a fictional character in the British science fiction television series \"Doctor Who\", played by Shaun Dingwall. He is the father of the Doctor's companion Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) and first appears in the episode \"Father's Day\". Writer Paul Cornell incorporated characteristics of his own father whilst writing Pete. This episode reveals that Pete died during Rose's childhood; though she attempts to change her past both she and Pete eventually realise that for the good of humanity he has to die. Rose later takes inspiration from her father in a time of need.\n\nThough deceased in Rose's universe, the 2006 series introduces a parallel universe version of Pete who, unlike the original, is rich and successful. Whilst fighting the emotionless Cybermen, Pete loses his wife, the parallel universe Jackie Tyler (Camille Coduri), and in turn struggles to comprehend that Rose is his daughter in another universe. This version of Pete returns in the finale episode in which he is there to aid his parallel self's family, eventually returning to the parallel universe with them. He settles down with the original Pete's Jackie and accepts Rose as a surrogate daughter.\n\nThe 2005 episode \"Father's Day\" in which the character is introduced also establishes the background of Pete; he was born on 15 September 1954 and died on 7 November 1987 when Rose was an infant, after being struck and killed in a hit-and-run. Flashback sequences are shown in which Pete's widow, Jackie (Camille Coduri) tells Rose as a young child (Julia Joyce) that he was a good husband and father and that he died alone. In the present day, Rose asks the Ninth Doctor (Christopher Eccleston) to take her back in time in his time machine so that she can witness his death and comfort him. When faced with the reality of what she is seeing, Rose impulsively rushes forward and saves Pete from being run down, changing history and causing a temporal paradox. Resultingly, the destructive Reapers arrive and begin to \"sterilise\" the wound in time by eradicating everything in sight. Eventually, Pete realises that Rose is his daughter and that her tales of her childhood with him were all lies to cover up the fact he was meant to be dead. Pete chooses to sacrifice himself by deliberately stepping in front of the car that should have killed him thus saving those taken by the Reapers and restoring history. This time, Rose holds his hand whilst he dies so that he does not die alone. Rose invokes her experience of meeting Pete and being there as he died in order to secure Jackie's help in the first series finalé \"The Parting of the Ways\".\n\nA parallel Earth version of Pete (played again by Dingwall) appears in three episodes of the second series (2006). In this universe, Pete is still alive, and has become rich through his entrepreneurial efforts. However, despite a public front he and Jackie have been effectively separated and have not had children, with Rose instead being the name Jackie has bestowed upon her Yorkshire terrier. Attending Jackie's 40th birthday party, Pete witnesses the first assault of the Cybermen. Though suspected by the Preachers to be one of John Lumic's (Roger Lloyd-Pack) minions, Pete reveals that he is in fact a mole secretly broadcasts them information about Lumic's dealings on an encrypted channel. Along with Rose, who had decided to meet her parallel parents after arriving in the parallel universe, he agrees to infiltrate the Cyber-factory and is horrified to discover that Jackie had been converted into a Cyberman. In the episode's epilogue, Rose tries to tell Pete about her origins, but he is unable to handle this information and slips away to deal with the aftermath of the Cyberman invasion. In the series finale, \"Doomsday\", Pete along with Mickey Smith (Noel Clarke) and Jake Simmonds (Andrew Hayden Smith) is able to travel to the Doctor's universe to help defeat the Cybermen. During the encounter, he is introduced to Rose's universe's Jackie and realises he still has feelings for her. When the walls between universes are sealed Pete and Jackie are sent to the parallel universe for safety; he later returns to rescue Rose from falling into the breach. In the episode's epilogue, it is stated that Jackie is pregnant with his child. Pete does not return with his on screen family in the series four finalé but it is mentioned that he had been looking after his and Jackie's son, Tony.\n\nSimon Pegg, who ultimately played the Editor in \"The Long Game\", was reported as being in line to play Pete, before having to pass on the episode. Paul Cornell, who wrote the episode \"Father's Day\" states that he based the character of Pete on his own father, who attempted many different jobs one of which was, like Pete, selling health drinks. In the episode after assuming responsibility for the destructive time paradox, Pete assures Rose \"I'm your dad, it's my job for it to be my fault\". This line was taken from something Cornell's father once said to him. An item of discussion between the production staff was over who would rescue Rose from falling into the void in second series finale \"Doomsday\"; executive producer's Russell T Davies and Julie Gardner wanted Pete to rescue her, while Noel Clarke and Phil Collinson wanted Mickey. The role was ultimately given to Pete, to emphasise that he had accepted Rose as a surrogate daughter.\n\n\"SFX\" magazine felt Shaun Dingwall to be the \"lynchpin\" of the episode \"Father's Day\" and opined that \"he gives one of the series' best performances.\" The magazine felt that \"it was inevitable that Rose's sanitised image of her dad would turn out to be far from the truth\" but commended the production team \"for not making him as much of a shit as they could have done.\" Despite his flaws, \"SFX\" concluded that Pete was \"still immensely likeable.\" Mark Braxton of the \"Radio Times\" also praised Dingwall's \"unbelievably good\" performance and stated that this helped distance Pete from being \"a cut-price Del Boy\". In his book \"Who is the Doctor\", Graeme Burk reacted negatively toward Pete in \"Rise of the Cybermen\"/\"The Age of Steel\", feeling that the writers had \"jettisoned all the subtlety that made us love him in 'Father's Day'\".\n"}
{"id": "1881806", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1881806", "title": "Sabbat (Japanese band)", "text": "Sabbat (Japanese band)\n\nSabbat started in 1983 when a band called Evil consisting of bassist Gezol, guitarists Ozny and Elizaveat, drummer Valvin and vocalist Toshiya was formed. Except for Ozny they had been playing together since 1981 in high school bands like Aburamushi, Hot Rod and Black Beast. With the high school bands they played mostly cover versions of new wave of British heavy metal acts like Iron Maiden and Demon, but with Evil the aim was immediately set higher. The band started to write material of their own and the first gig was played in August 1983.\n\nIn early 1984, Toshiya left the band and Gezol started to take care of vocals as well. During the summer the foursome decided to make the band a number one priority in their lives and the name of the band changed to Sabbat. The foundation for their history was laid and during the autumn Sabbat delivered their hard, raw and fast metal spiced with Venom covers to the audiences in their hometown of Kuwana and the surrounding area.\n\nIn April 1985, Sabbat recorded two songs for their first single. The single was released by Gezol's own record label Evil Records and the pressing was 300 copies. In June, Sabbat went through the first line-up change as Gezol's brother Samm ( Gero) replaced Valvin on drums.\n\nIn 1986, Sabbat were busy playing gigs throughout Japan which resulted in an appearance at Under The Castle festival on August 3 that was broadcast on television. Less than two weeks later they found themselves in a middle of a crisis. The second night of a two-night gig in Tokyo was played without Ozny who had engaged in an altercation (beating a man who had reportedly given him the finger) after the first night's show. Two weeks later Ozny played one more gig with Sabbat but after that it was mutually agreed that he was out of the band and Sabbat would continue as a trio.\n\nIn June 1987, Sabbat entered the studio again to record their second 7\" record entitled \"Born by Evil Blood\". Again the record was released by Evil Records and things looked bright until August came with yet another setback. Because of a death in the family circle Gezol and Samm decided to stop playing live. The farewell show was played in Nagoya on September 13 in front of only 43 people.\n\nThe decision not to play live was not the end of Sabbat. In October the band was in the studio again and in early 1988 Evil Records released The third 7\" record entitled \"Desecration\", and a year later \"The Devil's Sperm Is Cold\".\n\nWith these 7\" singles and EPs, Sabbat had started to gain popularity also outside Japan and in early 1989 Gezol wanted to return to the limelight. Unfortunately, Elizaveat was not quite as fond of the idea and Samm had already joined Sacrifice. Despite all this, Sabbat played a gig in May with one-night-only line-up: Gezol (bass guitar), Barraveat (guitar), Zorugelion (drums) and Possessed Hammer (vocals). Eventually Gezol succeeded to persuade Elizaveat to play live with Sabbat one more time and the official reunion gig was played October 10 with the following line-up: Gezol (bass guitar/vocals), Elizaveat (guitar) and Zorugelion (drums).\n\nZorugelion was now officially a member of the band replacing Samm permanently on drums. The agreement with Elizaveat was for one show only, so in order to keep on playing live Sabbat had to find a new guitar player.\n\nFinding the right person to replace Elizaveat was far from easy and Sabbat did not play a single show in 1990 but the fifth 7\" record on Evil Records was released. \"The Seven Deadly Sins\" EP consisted of three songs recorded with Samm still on drums. Although unwilling to play live, Elizaveat agreed to help Sabbat in the studio until a new guitar player was found. This made it possible for Sabbat to record a demo tape called \"Sabbatical Demon\" which is Zorugelion's first studio recording with the band and also Sabbat's only official demo.\n\nAlmost a year had passed since the reunion gig and there was still no sign of a suitable guitar player. In fact, the two shows played in 1989 were the only shows Sabbat had played during the last three years. Without a new guitarist there would not be any gigs and without any gigs the only sensible option was to go to the studio and this is what Sabbat did in October 1990. With Elizaveat doing the guitars the threesome started to record Sabbat's debut full length album \"Envenom\". The recordings were almost finished when a man called Temis Osmond was discovered and it was soon clear he was the guitar player Sabbat had desperately been looking for.\n\nTemis Osmond played a couple of solos on \"Envenom\" and although in the album credits he is mentioned only as a special guest he was a full member replacing Elizaveat when the CD came out in 1991 (on Evil Records). After a long struggle with line-up problems Sabbat were suddenly in a most desirable situation. A fresh debut album out and a new line-up: Gezol (bass/vocals), Temis Osmond (guitar/vocals) and Zorugelion (drums).\n\nIn September 1991, Sabbat flew to Europe to promote the band and make contacts. A gig was planned in Germany but this did not end up happening. There were also plans for an Austrian label, Lethal Records, to release \"Envenom\" in Europe but this as well did not end up taking place.\n\nIn early 1992, it was time to enter the studio again to record the second full length album with Temis Osmond doing all the guitars for the first time. Not only did Temis Osmond play all the guitars but he also shared lead vocals with Gezol. Zorugelion provided some vocals for the album as well. \"Evoke\" CD was released in the summer of 1992 by Evil Records.\n\nIn December 1992, Sabbat were in the studio again in order to record their third album and on top of this Japan's number one underground metal magazine F.E.T.U. released its 13th issue in January 1993 which was dedicated to Sabbat; 33 out of the 36 pages of the magazine were full of Sabbat interviews, pictures and detailed information. The third album \"Disembody\" was released by Evil Records in early 1993 but already in the autumn Sabbat were back in the studio again.\n\n1994 was to be the 10th anniversary for the band so a special anniversary album consisting of re-recorded versions of old songs was recorded in autumn 1993. Before this album was released, however, in early 1994 Sabbat recorded the fourth album \"Fetishism\" and the CD was swiftly released by Evil Records. Right after \"Fetishism\" they released the first part of the anniversary album entitled \"Black Up Your Soul\" featuring Elizaveat as a special guest. The 10th anniversary celebrations were marked by a special live show that took place in Nagoya on June 6. During the show the band was joined by special guest stars Samm on drums and Ozny on guitar.\n\nAdditionally, a record was released outside Japan for the first time. In the autumn of 1994, Holycaust Records, from the United States, released an MCD entitled \"Sabbatical Devilucifer\" that consisted of old unreleased demo recordings. The following year Italian label Entropy Records re-released the debut album \"Envenom\" for the European market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1881808", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1881808", "title": "Baháʼí World Centre buildings", "text": "Baháʼí World Centre buildings\n\nThe Baháʼí World Centre buildings are buildings that are part of the Baháʼí World Centre in Israel. The Baháʼí World Centre buildings include both the Baháʼí holy places used for pilgrimage and the international administrative bodies of the Baháʼí Faith; they comprise more than 20 different administrative offices, pilgrim buildings, libraries, archives, historical residences, and shrines. These structures are all set amidst more than 30 different gardens or individual terraces.\n\nThe buildings themselves are located in Haifa, Acre, and Bahjí, Israel. The location of the Baháʼí World Centre buildings has its roots in Baháʼu'lláh's imprisonment in Acre, which is near Haifa, by the Ottoman Empire during the period of Ottoman rule over Palestine, now Israel.\n\nMany Baháʼí holy places in Haifa and around Acre, including the terraces and the Shrine of the Báb on the north slope on Mount Carmel, and the Shrine of Baháʼu'lláh, the Mansion of Bahji, and the Mansion at Mazra'ih were inscribed on the World Heritage List in July 2008. The Baháʼí shrines \"are the first sites connected with a relatively new religious tradition to be recognized by the World Heritage List.\" The UNESCO World Heritage Committee considers the sites to be \"of outstanding universal value [and]...inscribed for the testimony they provide to the Baháʼí's strong tradition of pilgrimage and for their profound meaning for the faith.\"\n\nHaifa is the third-largest city in Israel, and it is a seaport, located below and on Mount Carmel, and lies on the Mediterranean coast. In 1891 Baháʼu'lláh himself designated Mount Carmel as the location for the Shrine of the Báb. Later, Baháʼu'lláh in the Tablet of Carmel wrote that Mount Carmel would be the physical location of the Baháʼí World Centre.\n\nThe Shrine of the Báb is the location where the Báb's remains have been laid to rest. The location was designated by Baháʼu'lláh himself in 1891 while he was camped, with ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, on Mount Carmel. The location is right above the German Colony, which was established in the 1860s by the German Templer Society, who were working for the Kingdom of God on earth. The initial shrine was built by ʻAbdu'l-Bahá and completed in 1909. Many years later, the superstructure was completed by Shoghi Effendi, and finally dedicated in 1953.\n\nThe architect was William Sutherland Maxwell, a Canadian Baháʼí who was a Beaux-Arts architect and the father-in-law of Shoghi Effendi. Shoghi Effendi provided overall guidance, including in the use of Western and Eastern styles, but left the artistic details to Maxwell. Maxwell's design of the Rose Baveno granite colonnade, Oriental-style Chiampo stone arches, and golden dome is meant to harmonize Eastern and Western proportions and style. Some remaining aspects of the dome's structural engineering were designed by Professor H. Neumann of Haifa's Technion University.\n\nAfter Maxwell died in 1952, Leroy Ioas, an American Baháʼí who had been closely associated with the construction of the Baháʼí House of Worship in Wilmette, Illinois helped Shoghi Effendi in the construction process. Ioas employed his administrative skills and practical mind to supervise the building of the drum and dome, a task done without the availability of sophisticated machinery.\n\nThe Shrine of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá is where ʻAbdu'l-Bahá's is buried.\n\nThe Arc composes a number of administrative buildings as revealed by Baháʼu'lláh in the Tablet of Carmel, built in the shape of an ark which include, the Seat of the Universal House of Justice, the Seat of the International Teaching Centre, the International Baháʼí Archives and the Centre for the Study of the Sacred Texts. The fifth building, the International Baháʼí Library has yet to be built.\n\nThe Seat of the Universal House of Justice is the building located in Haifa, Israel where the Universal House of Justice, the international governing council of the Baha'i community, sits. It is a large building where the House of Justice consults on the affairs of the worldwide community, meet dignitaries and pilgrims, and attends to other business. It also houses a few other offices of the Baháʼí World Centre.\n\nThe building is located at the apex of The Arc and has sixty Corinthian columns around it to mirror the design of the International Archives. The architect was Hossein Amanat and it was completed in 1982 during the second stage of building on the Arc, to be occupied in 1983.\n\nDuring a Baháʼí pilgrimage the Universal House of Justice addresses the pilgrims and then the members greet each pilgrim in turn.\n\nBuilt in the third stage of the building of the Arc, the International Teaching Centre Building is where the International Teaching Centre is based. This institution coordinates the growth and protection of the Baháʼí community. The architect was Hossein Amanat and it was completed in 2001.\n\nBuilt in the third stage of the building of the Arc, the Centre for the Study of the Sacred Texts is the base of the scholars and translators who study and translate the Baháʼí texts to assist the Universal House of Justice. The architect was Hossein Amanat and it was completed in 1999.\n\nThe International Archives is the first building to be built on the Arc and holds many of the most sacred items within the Baháʼí Faith, but most importantly is built for the viewing of the paintings and drawings of Baháʼu'lláh and the Báb, along with a single photograph of Baháʼu'lláh. Although some of these items are available on the internet today, most Baháʼís prefer to see these items only in a reverent atmosphere, during the pilgrimage.\n\nShoghi Effendi chose the Parthenon as the basis for the design, possibly due to the apparent enduring beauty even after thousands of years. The capitals of the fifty columns were Ionic rather than the Doric Order. It was finished in 1957 however Shoghi Effendi never lived to furnish the interior. This was left to his wife Rúhíyyih Khanum.\n\nPreviously the rear three rooms of the Shrine of the Báb and then the building beside the Monument Gardens now called the Department of Holy Places were temporary Archives buildings.\nThe International Baháʼí Library Building specified by Shoghi Effendi is not yet built. The Baháʼí World Centre Library holds an extensive collection of Baháʼí literature. The Universal House of Justice stated: \"In future decades its functions must grow, it will serve as an active centre for knowledge in all fields, and it will become the kernel of great institutions of scientific investigation and discovery.\"\n\nThe Monument Gardens within the Baháʼí World Centre are a set of gardens which hold the graves of some of the members of the Baháʼí holy family:\n\nThe Terraces are garden terraces that form nine above and nine below the Shrine of the Báb on Mount Carmel within Haifa, Israel.\n\nNine concentric circles thus provide the main geometry of the eighteen terraces. Just as the identification of a circle presupposes a centre, so the terraces have been conceived as generated from the Shrine of the Báb. The eighteen terraces plus the one terrace of the Shrine of the Báb make nineteen terraces total. Nineteen is a significant number within both the Baháʼí and Bábí religions.\n\nThe Visitors Centre is an underground structure on the 11th terrace behind the Shrine of the Báb on Mount Carmel within Haifa, Israel. It can be found on street level under the Hatzionut Bridge which the terraces pass over.\nʻAbdu'l-Bahá, who was the head of the Baháʼí Faith from 1892 to 1921, designed and built a house in Haifa on 7 Haparsim (Persian) Street after his father Baháʼu'lláh died. It was completed in 1908, and ʻAbdu'l-Bahá moved to the house in August 1910. It became his official residence. After his travels to the West, it became the place for the reception of pilgrims to the Baháʼí World Centre. The election of the first Universal House of Justice occurred in this house in 1963.\n\nPilgrim Houses signify buildings where pilgrims are (or were) greeted and housed during pilgrimage to the Baháʼí holy places. There have been numerous buildings within Haifa, Israel dedicated to this throughout the last century.\n\nThe original Western Pilgrim House, located at 4 Haparsim (Persian) Street in Haifa, Israel, was used as a Pilgrim House for members of the Baháʼí Faith of Western origin, who had come for pilgrimage during the early years of the 20th century, before it was replaced by the new Western Pilgrim House on 10 Haparsim Street.\n\nThe house is currently part of the Baháʼí World Centre. While it was originally rented to serve as a Pilgrim House, the house was then bought by ʻAbdu'l-Bahá. After being replaced by new Western Pilgrim House, the site was then used by members of the Baháʼí holy family. It left Baháʼí hands shortly before being re-bought by the Universal House of Justice.\n\nThe second Western Pilgrim House, often referred to as \"the old western Pilgrim House\", located at 10 Haparsim (Persian) Street in Haifa, Israel, was used as a Pilgrim House for members of the Baháʼí Faith who had come for pilgrimage during the first half of the 20th century. It is currently part of the Baháʼí World Centre and used by the Baháʼí International Community Secretariat and related offices.\n\nThe house was originally paid for by William Harry Randall, a wealthy American Baháʼí, who felt the facilities of the previous Western Pilgrim House at 4 Haparsim were inadequate. Its construction was started under the instruction of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, but was only completed during the time that Shoghi Effendi was the head of the Baháʼí Faith. Although it served originally as the Pilgrim House for western Baháʼís, it has been used for other purposes more recently:\n\nThe Eastern Pilgrim House or the \"Haifa Pilgrim House\" is a Pilgrim House for Baháʼís when they go on pilgrimage. The house was built after ʻAbdu'l-Bahá interred the remains of the Báb on Mount Carmel. The construction of this stone building was supervised by Mírzá Jaʼfar Rahmání of ʻIshqábád, who also paid all the expenses. It is known as the \"Eastern Pilgrim House\", as for decades it housed the Persian pilgrims. After 1951, when the Western Pilgrim House at 10 Haparsim Street became the seat of the International Baháʼí Council, it became the Pilgrim House for all pilgrims.\n\nThe Pilgrim Reception Centre or the \"Haifa Pilgrim Reception Centre\" was the old Pilgrim Reception Centre for pilgrimage to sites near the Baháʼí World Centre. It comprised two conjoined buildings of a historic medical clinic, that had been remodeled and opened in October 2000. While open, the building could serve up to 500 people on pilgrimage. It has now been replaced by a newer Pilgrim Reception Center situated near the Shrine of the Bàb.\n\nThe Resting place of Amatu'l-Bahá Rúhíyyih Khanum is situated within Haifa, Israel as part of the Baháʼí World Centre. Originally bought to make sure that the area around the House of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá was not built up, and used as a garden, it was selected as the burial ground for Amatu'l-Bahá Rúhíyyih Khanum after she died in 2000.\n75 HaTzionut Avenue is a building within Haifa which is part of the Baháʼí World Centre that is not particularly celebrated but has been an integral part of the centre for many years. Amongst other things it has been used for:\n\n\nIt is currently used as the Baháʼí \"Department of Holy Places\".\nAnother structure in the Haifa region is the site of the future Mas͟hriqu'l-Ad͟hkár.\nBaháʼu'lláh, and his family, was exiled to the prison city of Akká (Modern day Acre) by the Ottoman Sultan Abd-ul-Aziz. Baháʼu'lláh arrived in Akká on August 31, 1868, and lived the rest of his life in the Akká area as a prisoner. His prison conditions were eased in June 1877 and while still a prisoner, he moved to Mazra'ih at that time. The Baháʼí buildings and property in Akká were rented or bought during this period of time.\n\nThe House of ʻAbbúd refers actually to two houses:\n\nThe house provided a home for Baháʼu'lláh's first wife Navváb and her family. It was in this building that the Kitáb-i-Aqdas was written.\n\nThe House of ʻAbdu'lláh Páshá is one of the properties the Baháʼí holy family used in the Akká area. It was acquired by ʻAbdu'l-Bahá to fit the growing family and also provide space to welcome pilgrims who had started to arrive.\n\nThe name derives from the Akká governor Ibrahim Pasha who owned the house in the early decades of the 19th century.\n\nThe first western pilgrims were welcomed here on December 10, 1898.\nThe Garden of Ridván (lit. garden of paradise) is a Baháʼí holy place situated just outside Acre within modern Israel. Originally known as the 'garden of Naʻmayn', it was rented by ʻAbdu'l-Bahá for Baháʼu'lláh where he enjoyed spending the later part of his life, after years in a desolate prison cell. Although it shares the same name it does not have the same significance of the Garden of Ridván, Baghdad and no connection to the festival of Ridván.\n\nDuring the 1930s and 1940s the island setting of the garden disappeared, as a result of a draining project against malaria. In 2010 a three-year restoration and conservation project of the garden and the original water canals surrounding it was completed, after which the Ridvan Garden, referred to by Baháʼu'lláh as 'Our Verdant Isle', became an island once again.\n\nIn 2019, in its annual Ridván message, the Universal House of Justice announced that the future Shrine of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá is to be constructed in the vicinity of the Garden of Ridván.\n\nThe prison cell in which Baháʼu'lláh lived between 1868 and 1870 has now become a Baháʼí pilgrimage location. Its restoration was completed in June 2004.\n\nBahjí is a place near Akká where Baháʼu'lláh spent his final years of life. While he was still formally a prisoner of the Ottoman Empire, his prison conditions were eased, and from 1879 he used the Mansion of Bahjí as his home.\n\nAlthough the Mansion of Bahjí is relatively isolated, with only a small pilgrim house and the Shrine within several hundred metres, there used to be a complex of several buildings mostly used by the extended Holy family. During the time of Shoghi Effendi, these buildings (and the land around them which are now used as gardens) were bought up or traded for land near the Sea of Galilee. Several of the buildings were demolished as they had been used by covenant breakers. Tiles from the roofs were used to pave the garden pathways, and the material recovered from the razed buildings was used to construct a large windbreak to the northeast of the Mansion.\n\nLocated in Bahjí, the Shrine of Baháʼu'lláh is the most holy place for Baháʼís — their Qiblih. It contains the remains of Baháʼu'lláh and is near the spot where he died in the Mansion of Bahjí. \nThe Mansion of Bahjí is the house where Baháʼu'lláh died in 1892. It was built in 1870 over an earlier, smaller building by ʻUdi Khammar, a wealthy merchant from Akká who was also the original owner of the House of ʻAbbúd. It remained in his family's hands until 1879, when an epidemic caused the inhabitants to flee. The mansion was subsequently rented to the Baháʼí holy family for a very small amount of money. ʻUdi Khammar's tomb is still within the main Mansion compound, on the southeast corner of the wall. The Mansion is now a Baháʼí pilgrimage site.\n\nLocated in Bahjí and near the Shrine of Baháʼu'lláh, the Bahjí Visitor Centre contains basic facilities used by visitors and Baháʼí pilgrims.\nLocated four miles (6 km) north of Akká in Mazra'a, Baháʼu'lláh used this country house during the summers from June 1877 until 1879, before moving to a larger house within Bahjí. It left Baháʼí hands for several decades and was slightly restructured with an annex added to the front. This meant that a staircase, previously on the outside is now within the house's walls. It originally belonged to ʻAbdu'lláh Páshá, and is located four miles (6 km) north of Acre.\n\nMazra'ih was transferred from a Muslim waqf to the Baháʼís subsequent to the establishment of the state of Israel.\n\n\"Masra'ih is a Moslem religious endowment, and it is consequently impossible, under existing laws in this country, for it to be sold. However, as the friends are aware, the Ministry of Religions, due to the direct intervention of the Minister himself, Rabbi Maimon, consented, in the face of considerable opposition, to deliver Masra'ih to the Baha'is as a Holy Place to be visited by Baha'i pilgrims. This means that we rent it from the Department of Moslem and Druze affairs in the Ministry of Religions. The head of this Department is also a Rabbi, Dr. Hirschberg. Recently he, his wife and party, visited all the Baha'i properties in Haifa and 'Akka, following upon a very pleasant tea party in the Western Pilgrim House with the members of the International Baha'i Council.\" (Baháʼí News, no. 244, June 1951, p. 4) \n\nThe mansion was ultimately purchased by the Baháʼís in 1973.\n\n\n\n"}

They compete in the Canada Life Premier League and wear a white and navy kit. They play their home games at the Ballafletcher Sports Fields in Douglas at the site of the new Nobles Hospital.\n\nFormed in 1981, as Pot Black F.C. The original club was formed by a group of snooker playing football enthusiasts, led by Pot Black Snooker Centre proprietor, Peter Locke, who used to arrange friendly matches against business teams, such as KPMG and the IOM Police. After a series of friendly matches the players asked Mr Locke to try and gain entry to the Manx FA. The application was placed and was successful. The team, named Pot Black, entered the 2nd division in 1982. When the snooker club was sold, Mr Locke asked the new owners for sponsorship. When none was forthcoming, the club held a meeting in the Theatre Royal Hotel, Wellington Street, Douglas, and voted to change the name of the club to Douglas Royal. In 1986 the club was in some financial difficulties and looked like it may have to fold. A group of like minded young men were looking for a new club and made the offer to help. Fresh sponsorship was available and the club added the number \"87\" to its name to celebrate the new start. The original colours were red shirts, with black shorts & socks but the new committee voted to change to the colours worn today. Since those early days, they have won the Hospital Cup once in 2004–05 when they beat St Georges 3–2 in the final. Their first season in the First Division was 1989–90 when they finished sixth. They were relegated to Division Two in the 2002–03 season, but were promoted back to the top flight the next season as Division Two champions. They were again relegated in the 2007–08 season and currently play in Division Two \n\nThey have a reserve team that play in the Isle of Man Football Combination as well as junior and ladies teams.\n\nTheir main rivals are considered to be Gymnasium.\n\n\n"}

They compete in the second tier of the Isle of Man Football League.\n\nIn 1897, a group of rugby-playing miners turned their attention away from the game to focus on football. Foxdale Football Club recorded their first ever game against Castletown, losing the game 10–0 in 1898. A year later, during the 1899–1900 season, Foxdale entered the Isle of Man Football League. After narrowly missing out on becoming champions of the Second Division in 1900–01, Foxdale went on to only play one more season before folding at the end of the 1901–02 season.\n\nIt was not until 90 years later that Foxdale was able to place their name to a footballing side. However, they were not able to find a home within the village as Foxdale had to play and train at Jurby for the first three seasons of their establishment. Foxdale's first game came against St. Johns United on 5 September 1992 which they lost 5–2. For this game, Foxdale's kit had not arrived in time and they had to rely on the generosity of Douglas Royals; who lent Foxdale a red, away kit for the game.\n\nAfter three years of ground-sharing with Jurby, Foxdale were able to move to their own ground, and current location, Billy Goat Park. The ground was purchased with funds that were raised through special events, supported by local business owners such as James Cubbon, David Crowe and a large contribution from Alan Lemaire, who went on the play for, then manage, the club.\n\nSince being established in 1991, Foxdale have won a total of three competitions, the Paul Henry Gold Cup, which they won in the 1993–94 season after beating Marown A.F.C. 7–2. That same season they were promoted to the First Division as Division Two champions but were relegated in the 1995/96 season.\n\nFoxdale narrowly missed out on the Woods Cup in 2000–01 after being beaten 3–0 by Ayre United A.F.C. in the final of the competition. They did, however, return the following season to win the same competition, defeating Colby 2–1 in the final.\n\nIn the 2009/10 season, Foxdale entered the Kirby Estates Cowell Cup for the first and, currently, only time. They were placed in Group 4 alongside Castletown, Colby and DHSOB. They narrowly missed out on progression to the next round. Foxdale started their inaugural game well, beating DHSOB 5–0 at Blackberry Lane. However, the next game at home was less convincing, losing 4–1. They finished on a high however, beating Colby 4–2 away, but never progressed to the next round with Castletown beating them.\n\nFoxdale held their 20th anniversary on 5 August 2011 at the Palace Hotel. There was a dinner and a charity auction with 50% of the profit going to Wish Upon A Dream and 50% going to the football club itself. Guest speakers included: Richard Keys, Ronnie Irani and comedian Lester Crabtree. Former Scotland, Wolves and Everton F.C. striker Andy Gray was also due to attend but has had to withdraw because of a family commitment.\n\nIn December 2015 Stuart Naisbitt designed a Foxdale FC TT Campsite Website catering for TT Camping fortnight. Further details visit their website: http://www.foxdalefc-ttcampsite.com/ card bookings can also be made at http://www.foxdalefc-ttcampsite.com/bookings-1.html.\n\nDuring the summer of 2016, Foxdale AFC were fortunate enough to be able to purchase new landcare machinery and equipment. The money was raised from fundraisers, selling previous equipment and, in part, a grant from the Isle of Man Football Association.\n\nOn 16 July 2016, The Claremont Hotel in Douglas, played host to Foxdale AFC's annual awards for the first time. The venue and night would prove a success, leading to repeat events in the following years on 20 May 2017 and 21 July 2018.\n\nIn July 2018, the club regained the Miners Cup for the first time in 21 years. The Miners Cup is a friendly competition between Foxdale A.F.C. and Laxey A.F.C. as both clubs are nicknamed \"The Miners\". The cup has not been contested since 1997 and Foxdale emerged the victors in a 5-0 win over Laxey at Billy Goat Park. A hat-trick from Jay Chatwood and a goal a piece from new signings Liam Parker and Andy Williamson sealed the trophy.\n\nFoxdale made history in the 2018/19 season by fielding its first ever U18 side in the IOMFA Under 18 League. The idea to set up the side came from Scott Kermeen and was met with overwhelming support from the club, locals and players alike, attaining a total of 27 players by the start of the league season. The team's first ever game was on Wednesday 26 September 2018 at The Bowl versus Laxey A.F.C.. The management team consisted of three current Foxdale first team players; Craig Lemaire, Scott Kermeen and Stephen Bettridge. The game was unfortunately lost 8-2 but a historic goal from Philip Plaatjies and a penalty conversion from Michael Sloan meant that Foxdale had something to celebrate. The team (squad #) was as follows: Barton Beaumont (1), Frank Quaye (2), William Quaye (3), Toby Gadsby (4), Tyler Cain (5), Jake Dillon (6), Alfie Quaye (7), Philip Plaatjies (8), Jack Noon (9), Joseph Spencer (10), Jason Charmer (11), Lucas Winchester (12), Walid Anwar (14) and Michael Sloan (15). The game was also a historic event as, for the first time ever in Foxdale's history, the back four was consisted of three triplets in the Quaye brothers (a suspected but non-confirmed first in Manx football also). The team's first victory came in their second game on Wednesday 10 November 2018, beating rivals Marown A.F.C. 6-1; goals from: Jason Charmer, Toby Gadsby, Colm Garrity, Philip Plaatjies, Michael Sloan and a Marown own goal.\n\nIn the 2016/17 season, Foxdale found themselves in the FA Cup semi-finals against top flight league contenders, Peel A.F.C.. They had reached this position by spectacularly beating Colby A.F.C. 3-2 at home in the final minutes of the Round of 16 with goals from Aaron Costain, Andrew Berry and Jay Chatwood. They then went on to play Douglas and District F.C. at The Bowl which they won 2-1 with goals from Charlie Harrison and Jay Chatwood once again. \n\nThe semi-final vs Peel was played on 25 March 2017 and a large crowd turned out to watch the underdogs compete against their western rivals. Foxdale battled throughout and held their own against the most successful club in Manx Football, however, a fortunate punted clearance goal from Scott Kermeen was not enough to keep Peel from winning 2-1.\n\nFoxdale finished the season in third position meaning that they had qualified for the Paul Henry Gold Cup for the first time in five years. Unfortunately, this was short-lived and they were beaten on penalties by Onchan A.F.C. in the semi-finals.\n\nA disappointing season in terms of cup-runs, Foxdale found themselves unable to advance further than the first round of games in both the 'FP FA Cup' and the 'G H Woods Cup', losing to Premier League side Braddan A.F.C. and Division 2 challengers Marown A.F.C. respectively.\nLittle more success came from the 'Keystone Lawyers Hospital Cup'. Whilst they advanced into the second round by defeating Pulrose United A.F.C. 3-1 by goals from Andrew Berry, Stephen Bettridge and Kevin Pulman, it was Marown A.F.C. again who knocked Foxdale from the competition in the next round.\n\nA successive third-place finish in the league sealed qualification for the Paul Henry Gold Cup once more. With the cup being Foxdale's last chance of silverware for the season, it was Pulrose United A.F.C. who was drawn to be played. An 11 goal thriller was ultimately Foxdale's demise with the game going into extra time and Foxdale conceding a late 6th goal to lose the game 6-5; goals from Ricky Newsham, Jay Chatwood, Andrew Berry, Charlie Harrison and Kevin Pulman.\n\nA bye in the first round of the GH Corlett Woods Cup meant that Foxdale were drawn against Malew A.F.C. in the Round of 16 on 19 January 2019. A hard-fought game at Clagh Vane saw Foxdale edge the game 1-0 with the ball dropping fortunately to Scott Kermeen inside the box who struck the ball into the bottom corner. \n\nA disappointing game away at Colby A.F.C. saw Foxdale bomb out of the FA Cup in the first round of games. \n\nAfter defeating Malew several weeks earlier, the quarter finals of the Woods Cup saw Foxdale come up against Union Mills F.C. away from home. A game with gale-force winds and torrential rain complimented Foxdale, who were accompanied with the conditions in the first half, taking a 2-0 lead at half time with a lobbed effort from Ricky Newsham and a close-range goal from Scott Kermeen. A tricky second half saw the weather get worse but a resilient Foxdale side continued to protect their lead, with the game finishing 2-0; seeing the side into the semi-finals. The semi-finals of the Woods Cup is where Foxdale would see the end of their Woods Cup campaign against favourites, Pulrose United A.F.C.. A single goal from opposing player-manager Steven Priestnal without response was enough to knock Foxdale out.\n\nIt would be an exciting season for Foxdale in the Hospital Cup. Their first game came on 6 April 2019 against Castletown in the preliminary round; a team promoted to the top division the season earlier. A first-half hat-trick from Jay Chatwood (1, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2ngwO4od2o & 3) saw Foxdale sitting comfortably at half-time. Unfortunately, the advantage was levelled in the second half as Castletown mounted a surprising comeback. However, as the game looked destined for extra-time, it was Antony Corkill who scored the winner from a corner with practically the last move of the game. \n\nThis saw Foxdale through to the Last-16 of the competition against another Division 1 side and local rivals, St Johns United A.F.C.. This time, Foxdale were on the right side of the comeback after going into the break 1-0, a goal-a-piece from Andy Williamson and Jay Chatwood saw Foxdale win 2-1 and progress to the quarter-finals.\n\nThe quarter-finals draw was not dissimilar to the previous round which again saw Foxdale playing against a team from the division above who were also local rivals. It was Marown A.F.C. this time; with both teams fielding weakened sides, the game was a hard-fought affair with clear chances few and far between. It was Foxdale once again, however, who came out the victors and, once again, Antony Corkill was the man to score the only goal of the game, headed in from a corner kick. The 'giant-killers' were now onto the semi-finals of the Hospital Cup. The giant-killing name Foxdale had earned for themselves over the course of the season would finally come to an end when the semi-final draw saw them play against Division 1 champions St Marys A.F.C.. Large portions of the game saw Foxdale hold their own against the Douglas powerhouses but goals early and late in both halves saw them crash out. With only one more cup competition available; The Paul Henry Gold Cup.\n\nIt was another disappointing year in the Paul Henry Gold Cup with the side playing eventual Division 2 champions, Ramsey A.F.C. at the national stadium, The Bowl. An early goal from Antony Corkill gave the Miners hope going in at half-time. But the Northern club were clinical in the second half and scored 3 goals in the second half to ensure their place in the final against local rivals, RYCOB.\n\nFoxdale players wear a royal blue and maroon striped home kit and the away kit is a yellow jersey with yellow shorts and socks. \n\nFoxdale's motto \"Moyrn Y Valley Veg\" is displayed in Manx underneath the emblem of the famous Foxdale Clock Tower (showed right) and can be translated into \"Pride Of The Village\" in English.\n\nHome Kit Sponsor (First Team): Bettridge Motors\n\nHome Kit Make (First Team): Joma\n\nAway Kit Sponsor (All Squads): DC Skips\n\nAway Kit Make (All Squads): Joma\n\nHome Kit Sponsor (Combination): Mannmade Group\n\nHome Kit Make (Combination): Joma\n\nU18 Kit Sponsor: JCK Limited\n\nU18 Kit Make: Lotto\n\nBettridges Motors are a long and loyal sponsor to the football club and have been the first team kit sponsor for several years. The Combination kit is sponsored by Mannmade Group. The away kit is sponsored by DC Skips. Starting from the 2015/2016 season, Foxdale A.F.C. training tops and jackets have been sponsored by the Mann Made Group 'The Mann Made Group') and Bettridge Motors. JCK Limited supplied the kit for the inaugural Foxdale U18 side.\n\nFoxdale play their home games at Billy Goat Park, Stoney Mountain Road in Foxdale. \n\nIn 2004, Momentum Pictures used Billy Goat Park in some of the filming of Things to Do Before You're 30. It was released in the UK on 2 June 2006 and was directed by BAFTA Award winner, Simon Shore. The film is a remake of 1997 Dutch film All Stars and stars the likes of Billie Piper, Jimi Mistry, Dougray Scott, Emilia Fox and Shaun Parkes.\n\nIn 2011, after receiving funds from the IOMFA, Foxdale built new changing facilities designed by Mark Kinley who was also a Foxdale goalkeeper at the time. The facilities' water supply was heated by solar panels on the roof of the clubhouse. As well as new changing rooms, the club also bought new goalposts and corner flags with the funds. Two sets of goals were purchased, one full-sized set on wheels and one small training set. Money went towards attempts to set up drainage around the pitch, although this was to no avail as the boggy conditions still return after wet conditions. The volunteer work of various sponsors helped ensure that the costs were cut to a minimum with the advantage of Billy Goat Park being situated directly beside DCS Limited so machinery could be used at will. As well as the above, the money went towards a new lawnmower for the club's groundsman, and two brick huts to the right of the pitch.\n\nMay 2019 saw the erection of a new storage facility on the club's ground.\n\nAs of the summer of 2014, Billy Goat Park will be used to accommodate campers over the period of the Isle of Man TT Races. The camping equipment was supplied by Isle of Man TT Breaks – The Lazy Camper and will accommodate around 100 tourists with members of Foxdale Football Club providing staff and services.\n\nSince then, Foxdale have run the campsite themselves supplying tents, changing and entertainment facilities in the form of communal televisions and wifi provisions for the guests, who can catch up on the previous day's racing highlights within the marquee placed beside the changing rooms every year. From 2015, the campsite has been run and supervised by Paul and Maria Marsden.\n\n\n\"Competitive First Team appearances only from 13/08/2016 to 25/05/2019.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

They compete in the Isle of Man Football League. They wear a blue and white striped shirt, black shorts, black socks and play their home games at Tromode Park in Douglas.\n\nGymnasium AFC was founded in 1890 by a group of fitness men who wanted to keep fit. They met at the old Douglas Gymnasium and initially played rugby before making the switch to football. Gymns were one of 8 teams that initially made up the official Manx Football League. \n\nThey have been Isle of Man Football League champions seven times, including four consecutive championships from 1902–03 to 1905–06. They have won the Manx FA Cup ten times. \n\nThe club experienced an internal power struggle during 1987, resulting in the resignation of a section of the committee and players to form spin off club , who even took gymnasiums coloursDouglas Royal, who even copied the Gymns kit of the time and to this day consider themselves rivals (despite being in the lower leagues).\n\nIn 2001–02 they were relegated to Division Two but were promoted again the following season as runners-up. However they spent just one season back in the First Division finishing the season winning just two games. And yet again the following season, 2004–05, they were immediately promoted as runners-up. Since that time the club has consolidated its position within the top tier and continues to climb the table each season.\n\nIn addition to the Senior team, the club has a reserve team that play in the Isle of Man Football Combination and a Ladies team which plays in the Women's Division One. Plans are being reviewed to create a Youth program within the club to compete at all age groups and it is anticipated that this will be in place for the 2010–11 season.\n\nThanks to links with a prominent Premier League club, Gymns were donated a playing kit for the 2002–03 season. Unfortunately a mix-up in communication resulted in blue/white stripe shirts being provided instead of the club's traditional all-white. As a result, Gymns altered the club colours that season to reflect this new kit, later switching the shorts and socks from blue to black and thus creating the home strip worn today.\n\nDuring the 2008–09 season, the club achieved The Football Association Charter Standard status, the FA's kitemark scheme for quality assurance.\n\nThe Club then experienced a lean spell and have been back in the second division for a number of years.\n\nGymns have been managed by muppets since 2011, September 2017 aided by Assistant George Crawford, Coach Graeme Sears and Combi Manager Richard Easthope.\n\n2018 / 2019 was another fairly disappointing season but with a few bright moments. The team moved up one place in the table from the previous season and ended on 20 points which was double the tally year before. A rare away win 3-2 at Union Mills after being 2-0 down at Half Time was a highlight as well as a 2-1 win at home to Onchan in the FA Cup with substitute \"Silent\" Kev Armstrong scoring a late winner.\nThe team also put up a strong performance in the 2nd round of the Cup going down unluckily 3-1 to Division 2 Champions Pulrose. The main highlight actually came late in the season when Gymns were drawn against the island's top team St George's in the Hospital Cup. Most people forecast a rout especially as the team was missing half a dozen regulars but in fact the team fought hard and played their best football of the season to finish the 90 minutes all square at 2-2. Extra Time was played and it finished 5-3 because ref jon hog gave a goel to St George's after a prue foul to a gyms player then facebooked him after the game to say sorry. later after the ref never took charge of another game again ? (scared of bassy)\nup and coming out his box keeper Andy Brown pulled off many fine saves over the season and the returning Barry Harding performed well in his few appearances in a defence that was never able to play the same four on a weekly basis. The midfield varied from week to week also but Simon Dixon had his moments and a few goals as well but ex stright guy now out Wesley Gibson was a disappointment. Adam Johnson was again top scorer. The two youngsters in defence Nick Clague (Players Player of the Year) and Ross Crawford (Player/Young Player of the Year) both had fine seasons though and look like good prospects and more decent youngsters are required to build the club up again in future years as well as hopefully bringing in some more experienced talent.\n\nWe got hammered by Governors Athletic 4-3 and we were 4–1 down with 75 minutes gone. We only got 2 late goals because of dodgy refereeing \n\nGYMS are going to be back so hate us now or hate us later , GTID\n\nGymnasium FC continue to be sponsored by Celtic Associates as at the start of the 2019–20 season.\n\nThe club is also a member of the Cronkbourne Sports & Social Club, which also includes the Cronkbourne Cricket Club and the Cronkbourne Bacchanalians Hockey Club. This partnership enables the CSSC pavilion facilities to be used during the football season to provide a further level of comfort to home and visiting players.\n\n\n"}

It was first published in 1963 and was written by Norman Bridwell (1928–2014). The series helped establish Scholastic as a premier publishing company, and Clifford is Scholastic's official mascot.\n\n\nKarl-Lorimar Home Video released the video \"Clifford's Sing Along Adventure\" around 1986. Warner Home Video re-released it in the mid-1990s.\n\nIn 1988, Scholastic Studios, Mendelson-Melendez Productions, Nelvana, Wang Film Productions, and Family Home Entertainment released \"Clifford's Fun with...\", a videotape series with a theme song composed by Phillip Namanworth and Benjamin Goldstein. The episodes on the release are: \"The ABC Message Service\", \"Clifford's Birthday Surprise\", \"The Scavenger Hunt\", \"The Rhyme Cat Rescue\", \"Clifford Goes to Hollywood\", and \"The Pet Show\". Brent Titcomb was the voice of Clifford, and Alyson Court was Emily Elizabeth. In the late 1990s, a television station from Spain ran the direct-to-video series for a short period of time.\n\nScholastic Studios produced a 65-episode adaptation shown on PBS Kids, which aired from September 2000 to February 2003. Clifford was voiced by actor John Ritter, and Emily Elizabeth was voiced by Grey DeLisle. There was also a 39-episode prequel series that took place during Clifford's puppyhood where he was voiced by Lara Jill Miller, which ran from September 2003 to February 2006. During that time, a 76-minute film which served as the show's finale was released in February 2004 and no new episodes were released after John Ritter's death.

Matt Lopez had been hired to write the script, while Chris Meledandri and Deborah Forte would produce the film. In July 2013, it was reported that Illumination had dropped the project. Two months later, it was reported that the film was still in development at Universal and that there were negotiations to have David Bowers direct the film. Like the 2011 film \"Hop\", Clifford the Big Red Dog will be animated while the other characters will be live-action. On August 1, 2014, Universal scheduled the film for a release on April 8, 2016. In the beginning of 2015, the film's release date was taken over by another Universal film, \"The Boss\". On June 30, 2016, it was reported by \"Deadline Hollywood\" that Paramount Pictures had picked up the rights for the film. According to the report, \"Forte decided to take the material in a new direction,\" and \"Universal let the option lapse.\" It was further announced that Justin Malen was hired to write the screenplay. On September 25, 2017, it was announced that Walt Becker will direct the film, replacing Bowers. The film will now be produced by Scholastic Entertainment and Paramount Animation. On February 27, 2019, Paramount set the film for a November 13, 2020 release, taking over the slot for the cancelled live-action/CGI \"Rugrats\" film.

Surrounding the community, through which flows the Weschnitz, are woods and cultivated land.\n\nEinhausen borders in the north on the community of Groß-Rohrheim and the town of Gernsheim (Groß-Gerau district), in the east on the towns of Bensheim and Lorsch, in the south on the town of Bürstadt and in the west on the community of Biblis.\n\nEinhausen officially consists of only one \"Ortsteil\"; however, the historical distinction between Groß-Hausen and Klein-Hausen is still heard in speech.\n\nThe community was donated in 768 under the name \"Husun\" to the Lorsch Abbey. In the course of the Reformation and the Counterreformation there arose two politically and ecclesiastically divided communities: Groß-Hausen (Protestant), and Klein-Hausen (Catholic) which contradictorily became the larger of the two. On 1 April 1937, the two communities were merged into the community of Einhausen. (Older residents often tell the visitor that this merger was one of many mergers endorsed and signed into effect by Adolf Hitler.) As mentioned earlier, the historical distinction between Groß-Hausen and Klein-Hausen is still heard in speech today, even by younger residents.\n\nThe municipal election held on 26 March 2006 yielded the following results:\nThe community’s arms might be described thus: Gules a brick house Or with roof, two chimneys, a door and two windows sable, the whole on an arched bridge Or.\n\nThe bridge is symbolic of the merger of the two former communities, which were divided for centuries.\n\n\nEinhausen’s Kirchweih (church consecration festival) is held each year on the first weekend in October. It is staged by the \"Verein zur Erhaltung der Tradition Einhausen e.V.\" (“Einhausen Club for Maintaining Tradition”) in collaboration with the three festival groups \"ADI\", \"CHIEF\" and \"Ladännsche\". Known well beyond Einhausen is the parade at this festival, which is run on the first Sunday in October.\n\nThe float built in 2007 on the theme “North Korea” was featured in the November edition of the Carnival magazine \"Tusch!!!\" (a national trade magazine published around Carnival) as Germany’s best political float of 2007.\n\nKnown in this part of Germany as \"Fastnacht\", this includes four of the \"Sitzungen\" (“sittings” or “sessions”) that typify this celebration.

{"id": "1881844", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1881844", "title": "Sacbe", "text": "Sacbe\n\nA sacbe, plural sacbeob (Yucatec Maya: singular \"sakbej\", plural \"sakbejo'ob\"), or \"white way\", is a raised paved road built by the Maya civilization of pre-Columbian Mesoamerica. Most connect temples, plazas, and groups of structures within ceremonial centers or cities, but some longer roads between cities are also known. The term \"sacbe\" is Yucatec Maya for \"white road\"; white perhaps because there is evidence that they were originally coated with limestone stucco or plaster, which was over a stone and rubble fill.\n\nThe word \"Beh\" operates as the root term for \"Sacbe\" it is a Mayan term for \"road, pathway, or trail.\" Beh is spelled alternately as Be, bej, bey, be, bih, as well as \"beel\" in the possessive.\n\nIt has many distinctions from English concepts of roads, pathways, or trails. Beh's metaphoric meanings are just as important if not more important than its literal meaning of \"road.\" Ethnographers working the lowlands have noted that it means \"more than the road you see with your eyes.\" The term Beh refers to \"the road of life\".\n\nIn the Colonial times \"Sacbe\" was translated to calzada which is Spanish for \"main road/Highway.\" The literal translation of Sacbe is \"white road.\" This is used to refer to Mayan large constructed roads covered in a white (Sac) surfacing.\n\nMany sacbeob can be seen by modern visitors to Maya sites; a prominent one is at Chichen Itza, running from the main group around El Castillo to the Sacred Cenote. Few of the longer roads still exist in their entirety. A well known sacbe connects Uxmal with Kabah, which is marked by corbel arches at either end. The 62-mile-long (100 km) road connecting the ancient cities of Coba and Yaxuna was for decades the longest known to archaeologists. The remains of an even longer route have recently received the attention of archaeologists. This long sacbe apparently ran from the site of Ti'ho (modern Mérida, Yucatán), through such sites as Ake and Izamal, to the Caribbean Sea near modern Puerto Morelos, a total distance of some 300 km. In modern times, some of the ancient sacbeob have been used as bases or incorporated into modern highways and railway lines.\n\nAll sacbeob apparently had ritual or religious significance for pilgrimages. Travel writer and early Mayanist John Lloyd Stephens reported that some local Maya people in Yucatán still said a short ritual prayer when crossing a sacbe in the early 1840s, even though they had been overgrown with jungle for centuries at the time. He is said to have been pleased to have discovered evidence of large, well-constructed sacbeob, reports of which he had previously believed to be exaggerations on the part of the Spanish conquistadores.\n\nSacbeob had a number of practical uses in addition to any religious significance they may have had. Longer sacbeob could be used for trade and communication. The Maya did not have a beast of burden suitable for carrying goods over long distances, so it is likely that the sacbeob would have been regularly walked by traders, though the Maya are also known to have used water routes. There is a wealth of evidence of mounds, often interpreted as remains of huts or way stations for travelers, along large sacbeob. Looking at the large sacbe connecting Kabah to Uxmal, natives told John Lloyd Stephens that ancient Mayan couriers used the sacbeob to deliver messages between large cities. At Ake in the Yucatán, several sacbeob lead directly to cenotes, which serve both as important religious sites and sources of clean water.\n\nAt Coba, there are more than 50 sacbeob still visible today. Some researchers believe that some of the sacbeob were used to divide the population of about 55,000 people into at least four barrios or neighborhoods. Many smaller sacbeob fall in places around sources of water or other high-traffic areas like ceremonial or administrative centers. Two much larger sacbeob connect Coba to the smaller sites of Yaxuna, almost 100 km to the west, and Ixil, about 20 km to the southwest. Since Coba is the only major Classic Period site in a 5,000 square kilometer area around it, Yaxuna and Ixil are believed to be outposts or subsidiaries of Coba, which would have been the capital of the state in which they all resided.\n\nSome sacbeob that have been studied in the northwest Yucatan seem to have been constructed at times of conflict, rapid population growth and migration, and they have been interpreted by some as \"permanent markers attesting to the relationships between dominant centers and satellite settlements,\" effectively a way of signifying and maintaining political boundaries.\n\nWhile the sacbeob in the Yucatán are the best known, they are documented elsewhere in the Maya area. A number of sacbeob have been found around El Mirador and Tikal in the northern Petén Basin and around Copan in the southern Guatemalan Highlands, as well as at other sites.\n\nWithin the Maya, movement holds a ceremonial and spiritual power. In Maya Healing, some forms of illness are diagnosed through concepts of the movement of various forces through the body and the world. Rituals include curing the sick, pilgrimage, procession, and dedication involve movement as a generative source of power, capable of change and influence.\n\nThe present day and colonial Maya term for the Milky Way is also \"sacbe.\" The fulfillment of one's destiny is considered the fulfillment of their \"road.\" Seeing that movement, roads, and the cosmos are important to Mayan mythos, the conflation of Sacbe with the celestial Milky Way suggests a ceremonial importance of the Sacbe.\n\n\n"}

Fujita's character was inspired by the real-life Hotsumi Ozaki, who assisted the famous Soviet spy Richard Sorge and so became the only Japanese citizen to suffer the death penalty for treason during World War II. The film is in black-and-white and runs 110 minutes.\n\nThe film begins in 1933. Students at Kyoto Imperial University protest the Japanese invasion of Manchuria. Prominent professor Yagihara (Denjiro Okochi) is relieved of his post because of his views against fascism. The professor's daughter Yukie (Setsuko Hara) is courted by two of her father's students: Ryukichi Noge (Susumu Fujita) and Itokawa (Akitake Kôno). Itokawa is equable and moderate while Noge is fiery and a radical leftist. Although she fights with him vigorously, Yukie is eventually drawn toward Noge.\n\nNoge disappears following an anti-militarist student protest, the result of being arrested and spending four years in jail. By the time Itokawa, now a prosecutor for the government, tells Yukie of Noge's whereabouts, he has been out of jail for a year. He warns her that he is a changed man and no longer how Yukie remembered him.\n\nItokawa brings Noge over to the Yagihara residence. During dinner, Professor Yagihara mentions that Noge would not have been released unless the government was convinced that Noge had \"converted\" from his radical ways. Noge confirms this and says that Itokawa vouched for him and had even found him a job in the army.\n\nAfter realizing that Noge has changed from his days at university, Yukie excuses herself from the dinner table and locks herself in her room. Her mother eventually tells her that the young men are leaving. Yukie is reluctant to see them out, but once her mother tells her that Noge is leaving for China she decides to see Noge one last time to say goodbye.\n\nAfter Noge's departure, Yukie begins to pack for Tokyo and has a deep conversation with her father. For three years in Tokyo, Yukie works in menial jobs to get by. One day she runs into Itokawa and is told that Noge is in the city. She goes to Noge's offices, but is reluctant to reconnect. Yukie is shown outside of the offices several times until eventually Noge notices her. They spend several years together and get married.\n\nYukie discovers that Noge is involved in dangerous and illegal activities, but they agree that she should not know exactly what they are. Noge is arrested the night before his plans are to go into effect. Yukie is interrogated, but she proffers no information. She is treated badly during the interrogations but Itokawa is eventually able to free her.\n\nHer parents take the train into Tokyo where Yukie's father meets up with Itokawa, thanks him for what he has done and informs him that he intends to represent Noge in court. Itokawa mournfully responds that Noge died the night before. Yukie is crushed. She brings his ashes to his parents, farmers in the countryside, and tells them she is his wife. Noge's father rejects her, believing that she has come to mock them because their son was convicted of being a spy but Yukie stays and works the rice fields with them. They are scorned and harassed in their village, and Yukie tries to convince them of her sincerity and that their son was a good man. The work in the rice fields is hard on her, but she is determined to prove her mettle, even to the point of working through a severe fever.\n\nThe night that Yukie and her mother-in-law finally finish planting all of the fields, the neighbors sneak in and destroy their work. When Yukie mourns the vandalism, Noge's father finally accept her and their son is redeemed in their eyes. At the end of the war, Professor Yagihara is reinstated and Noge is honored for his antiwar efforts. Yukie returns to Kyoto to visit her parents. Yukie's mother invites her to stay since it seems her daughter has achieved her goal: Noge's parents are no longer ashamed of their son. However, Yukie now feels more comfortable planting rice than playing the piano, and sees the value in the social work that still must be done in the village so she returns to Noge's parents.\n\nThe Criterion Collection published a DVD of the film in its Eclipse series. It is available to view for free in some US cities via the Kanopy website.\n\n"}

Dutton and Courtney Chase. It is noteworthy for taking place in real time.\n\nThe film opens with Gene Watson (Johnny Depp), a mild-mannered, widowed accountant, arriving with his daughter Lynn at the Union Station in Los Angeles. As Watson makes a pay phone call informing an unidentified person that his train was late, two mysterious strangers in suits, known only as Mr. Smith (Christopher Walken) and Ms. Jones (Roma Maffia), survey the station from a catwalk, discussing a yet-to-be-elaborated scheme. Noticing Watson retaliate against a skater who was harassing his daughter, Smith and Jones set their sights on him and swiftly approach the pair. Showing a badge, the two strangers convince Watson that they are police officers and whisk both father and daughter into a van without justification. Once in the vehicle, Watson begins to notice things are not right and gets nervous, but Smith subsequently pistol whips him in the leg to get his attention. Smith then informs Watson that they will kill his daughter by 1:30 p.m. unless he murders a woman depicted in a photograph. He soon learns that the woman is State Governor Eleanor Grant and realizes that killing her would be a suicide mission.\n\nOnce at the Bonaventure Hotel, where a number of campaign appearances are being held, Watson makes several attempts to warn people about his situation, but Smith consistently follows him around, taunts and viciously beats him whenever he does not make a move. Watson manages to find a young campaign assistant, Krista Brooks, who believes Watson's story and encourages him to report the matter to the governor's husband, Brendan Grant. Once in his suite, however, Brendan and a campaign lobbyist appear to disbelieve the story, and before anything more can be said, Smith shows up in the room and fatally shoots Krista, causing a tense scuffle between Watson and Smith. Watson awakens after unconsciousness and finds nearly everyone on the campaign, including the governor's staff and husband, are involved in the plot, with an unnamed right-wing lobbyist masterminding it all in revenge for the governor not carrying out her campaign promises to his interests.\n\nWatson eventually finds a disabled war veteran named Huey who polishes people's shoes at the hotel. While at first he does not believe Watson's story, Smith talks to Watson about the plot, believing Huey to be completely deaf according to a sign. Huey reluctantly assists Watson to get to Governor Grant's suite and advise her of the conspiracy. Although skeptical at first of Watson's story, she later notices Brendan act suspiciously about Krista's whereabouts and realizes Watson was telling the truth. Being hastened by her husband to make the last speech, the governor greets supporters in a ballroom when Watson takes out the gun, points it at a projector room where Smith is watching him and shoots at the window. This unleashes a panic in the ballroom, causing a stampede and brief shootout between Watson and the security people. Thinking that his wife is dead, Brendan openly gloats about the plot's success, only to find out in horror that she had heard everything, confirming her suspicions about him.\n\nIn the meantime, Huey stalls the armed Jones, who is in the van with Watson's daughter after she cannot get a signal from Smith. He then annoys her with a squeegee man scheme to the point of a violent confrontation in which she shoots his wooden leg. Lynn quickly tries to get out of the van when Smith opens the door and begins to shoot at her. Right after she hides under the seat, Watson appears and shoots Smith. Ailing from his wounds, Smith congratulates Watson for becoming a killer just before he's finally killed by Watson. Before Jones can get a clear shot at the father and daughter, Huey beats her unconscious with his prosthetic leg and wing tip shoe. The final scene shows the conspiracy mastermind stepping on Watson's broken wristwatch and leaving the hotel in a car.\n\nAn alternate TV scene (and on some DVD versions) also shows the governor thanking Watson and Huey for saving her life.\n\n\nThe majority of filming took place at the Westin Bonaventure Hotel in Downtown Los Angeles, CA.\n\nA box office bomb, it grossed $8 million on a $33 million budget.\n\n\"Nick of Time\" received negative reviews from critics. Based on 30 reviews collected from notable publications by review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an overall approval rating of 32% from 31 reviews and an average score of 4.7/10. The site's consensus reads: \"It isn't the worst '90s action thriller, but by bungling a story pitting Johnny Depp against Christopher Walken, the rote \"Nick of Time\" ranks among the most disappointing\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nThe film's score – composed by Arthur B. Rubinstein – was released by Milan Records on November 22, 1995.\n"}

It runs near Saginaw and Midland in the Tri-Cities area of the Lower Peninsula. The highway runs through suburban and agricultural areas to connect the two cities with the airport in the area. The northernmost section of M-47 runs along a freeway to the terminus at US Highway 10 (US 10). M-47 runs for , all of which has been listed as a part of the National Highway System.\n\nFirst designated by July 1, 1919 along a different routing, M-47 was extended several times in both directions through the 1920s and 1930s. Two of these extensions replaced sections of M-111 in the Bay City area. At the apex of its length in the 1950s, M-47 stretched from Webberville in the south to Bay City State Park in the north. Since Interstate 75 (I-75) opened in the Tri-Cities area, the northern section of M-47 was rerouted and truncated as a result of related changes to other highways. The southern end was moved after I-96 opened in the Lansing area. Further changes into the 1970s shortened M-47 more, producing the routing in use today.\n\nM-47 starts at M-46 (Gratiot Road) east of Shields next to the Oakwood Cemetery. M-47 is known as Midland Road as it runs slightly northwest to intersect with M-58 (State Road) in Saginaw Charter Township running parallel to the Tittabawassee River. This area is the western edge of Saginaw's suburbs. Along the road towards Freeland, there are periodic small farms in between small residential subdivisions. In the community of Freeland, M-47 runs near the MBS International Airport off Freeland Road. North of town, M-47 leaves Midland Road and becomes a freeway near Tittabawassee Park. The freeway section of M-47 runs through rural farm land. There is a diamond interchange with Salzburg Road before the terminal interchange at US 10.\n\nAs part of its maintenance duties, the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) tracks the volume of traffic on the highways it maintains. This number is expressed in terms of annual average daily traffic (AADT), a calculation of the average traffic for a segment of roadway on any average day of the year. In 2009, the department measured a peak of 19,719 vehicles daily on the stretch north of Tittabawassee Road. The section south of the US 10 interchange had the lowest traffic level at 9,315 vehicles AADT. Additionally, the entire route of M-47 has been listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.\n\nThe original designation of M-47 was routed from the Shiawassee–Ingham county line north to St. Charles and then east along M-46 into Saginaw. A southern extension into Ingham County to end at M-16 in Williamston was transferred and completed in 1924. A northern extension to Bay City replaced a section of M-111 in 1929, and extended farther to Bay City State Park in 1933. M-47 replaced the remainder of M-111 and extended southward from the park to Bay City in 1938, creating a \"U-turn\" in the routing. The southern terminus was moved again in late 1951 or early 1952 to Webberville, although still ending on US 16.\n\nAt its greatest extent in the 1950s, the highway extended north from Webberville through Owosso and St. Charles to a junction with M-46 between Hemlock and Shields. M-47 turned east along M-46, running concurrently with that highway to Saginaw Township. There M-47 turned north independently to a junction with US 10, and then ran concurrently with US 10 into Saginaw. Once in the city, M-47 turned north along Bay Street out of town toward Bay City. M-47 joined US 23 and followed it north of town. M-47 then ran separately to the state park before turning south and back into downtown Bay City, ending at the US 23 business loop.\n\nMajor changes to the routing of M-47 started in December 1960 when the I-75/US 10/US 23 freeway opened between Saginaw and Bay City. US 10 was rerouted east of Midland to Bay City along the M-20 freeway. M-47 was rerouted along the former US 10 from Saginaw to east of Midland using a connector expressway from Freeland north to the US 10 freeway. M-81 was extended over State Street in Saginaw, and the former routing of M-47 between Saginaw and Bay City was redesignated as M-84. M-13 also replaced the former US 23/M-47 when US 23 was moved to freeways as well. The southern end of M-47 was changed in 1962 with the completion of I-96 in the Lansing area. US 16 was replaced by M-43, and the southern terminus of M-47 was moved to exit 122 along I-96. This segment of M-47 south of M-46 became an extension of M-52 in 1969, truncating M-47 to Hemlock. The interchange at Salzburg Road north of Freeland opened in 1970, and the expressway segment was upgraded to a full freeway. At the same time, M-47 was truncated to its current routing, resulting in the elimination of the M-46/M-47 concurrency near Shields. In the end, only about a mile and a half (2.4 km) of roadway still bears the M-47 from before the changes made starting in 1960, along a section of road that was not originally part of the highway in 1919.\n\nIn June 2014, a construction project began on the interchange with US 10 at the route's northern terminus. This construction consisted of bridge replacement over US 10, as well as a new ramp connecting northbound M-47 to westbound US 10 that, unlike the old ramp, does not conflict with westbound traffic exiting onto southbound M-47.\n\nIn 1928, M-111 was assigned to a route connecting M-13 (later signed as US 23 for a time) north of Bay City to Bay City State Park on Saginaw Bay. The original route consisted of what is today Euclid Avenue. In the early 1930s, a return leg towards Bay City was added to the east of the original route along what is now State Park Road, giving the route an upside-down-U shape. In 1933, the western leg along Euclid Avenue from Midland Road to Beaver Road was designated as M-47. In 1938, all of M-111 was re-designated as M-47—thus making M-47 double back to Bay City.\n\n"}

It consists of the expansion sets Onslaught (October 2002), Legions (January 2003) and Scourge (May 2003). The block's main theme is creature types (for example, Clerics and Goblins), and much of the game play concerns interactions between these \"tribes\". The story continues the saga of the Mirari from the previous block of expansion sets. Onslaught was the last block printed before the \"modern\" card face style was introduced.\n\nThe story of \"Onslaught\" mainly concerns characters introduced in the \"\" block. Kamahl the Barbarian has relocated to the Krosan Forest with the Mirari and becomes a druid of Krosa. The power of the Mirari begins to work on the forest, mutating its residents and growing some of them to gigantic proportions.\n\nMeanwhile, Kamahl's sister Jeska is transformed by foul Cabal healing magic, into Phage, a pit fighter whose touch brings death. Phage then allies herself with the Cabal.\n\nIxidor, an illusionist, fights in the pits with his partner, a beautiful sorceress named Nivea, who ends up being killed off by Phage. Ixidor then wanders the desert in grief and discovers his new powers of reality sculpting. Ixidor uses his new power to create a palace in the desert, where he creates an angel based on Nivea named , who is sworn to his service. He resolves to avenge Nivea's slaying by attacking the Cabal and Phage with Akroma. The escalating struggle between Phage and Akroma leads Kamahl into an uneasy alliance with the Cabal against the destructive power of Ixidor and Akroma.\n\nKamahl and the Cabal, in their uneasy alliance, set out to defeat the threat of Akroma. Ixidor was killed, but Akroma continued her mission to destroy Phage. In a final battle, Phage and Akroma merge into one being, Karona, the false god. Meanwhile, the slivers, a species which arrived in Dominaria during the Phyrexian Invasion and went extinct at that time, have been revived as clones of the originals through the work of the Riptide Project. Although the Riptide Project was successful in bringing back the species, the hive-minded nature of the species was not understood by the researchers. The result was that the slivers escaped captivity, killed almost all Project staff, and then moved on to establish hives on mainland Otaria.\n\nThe war between Phage and Akroma is over. There is no winner, but there is one clear loser: Otaria. The clash of such sheer power merged the two into a new creature, Karona the false god, an immensely powerful being forged from all five colors of Magic (Phage was originally Jeska, a \"red\" aligned barbarian corrupted by \"black\" mana; Akroma was a \"white\" angel created by Ixidor, a \"blue\" wizard; both of whom were simultaneously struck down by the \"green\" aligned Kamahl). Karona is seen as a god by all who look upon her, and these followers would march to their death just to walk in her footsteps. War begins to mount between rival factions of devotees, each wanting to claim Karona for themselves.\n\nMeanwhile, the Mirari poisoning is further polluting the inhabitants of Otaria. The elves are becoming taller and stronger, more like the very trees they protect. The soldiers are merging with their weapons and armor into living juggernauts. Zombies are sprouting new, more powerful arms and extra heads. The same explosion that created Karona created a new master for the slivers, the Sliver Overlord.\n\nKamahl eventually frees Jeska. Karn returns and takes Jeska to his created plane, Argentum. He tells Jeska that she is a planeswalker, and asks her to travel the multiverse with him. She is hesitant to leave Argentum until Karn shows her its guardian, Memnarch, forged from the Mirari. This event sets up the next block, Mirrodin.\n\n\"Onslaught\" Block marked the end of many traditional elements of \"Magic: The Gathering\". It was the last block to feature the old-style card faces or a storyline set in Dominaria until the release of the block. However, this was not apparent in October 2002 when the set was released.\n\nOnslaught continued a recent trend of increasingly powerful creature based strategies. In particular, Onslaught saw the printing of many aggressively designed goblin cards. Along with additions from the and expansions, the speed and consistency of optimized Goblin decks reached a level unmatched by most other creature decks of the time. The archetype has contributed to the ban of several cards in specific formats, including the previously underpowered ' and '. It has typically been a competitive deck choice in nearly every format where the Onslaught block is legal.\n\n\"Legions\" is the only expansion in Magic to be composed entirely of creature cards. This was done to help emphasize the creature-based mechanics of the block such as Morph and Tribal. Due to the complete absence of non-creature cards and a limited number of tournament staples, Legions is considered to be one of the most controversial set releases by Wizards of the Coast among many players. The set does feature the return of a fan favorite creature type, .\n\nThe release of \"Scourge\" made a significant impact on tournament play. The set added two cards and that strengthened goblin decks in multiple formats. gave white control decks both a robust card advantage engine that also served as a finisher. Vintage quickly adopted two cards with the storm mechanic, and due to their synergy with fast artifact mana and along with their relative immunity to the disruption available at the time such as . The \"Scourge\" card allowed decks to counter certain abilities that were previously difficult to interact with while also providing an answer to the \"Scourge\" Storm cards.\n\nOnslaught introduced a number of major mechanics and featured the first return of a keyword from abeyance. Many of Onslaught's effects were tribal in nature, meaning they depended on a creature's types, i.e. its species, role, etc. These included type-specific creature removal, power boosts, and abilities which grew stronger based on the number of creatures of a certain type which a player controlled. The most radical new mechanic in Onslaught was Morph, which allowed players to play creatures as \"face-down\" creatures with no special abilities, except the ability to turn face-up for a cost. This added an element of guesswork to the game which was greater than any previously present. Onslaught reprised the Cycling mechanic (which lets a player pay a mana cost and discard the Cycling card from his or her hand in order to draw a card) from the \"Urza\" block. Onslaught expanded on the Cycling mechanic by using more varied mana costs than \"Urza's\" Block Cycling cards and by including abilities that are triggered by the use of Cycling cards.\n\n\"Legions\" introduced three new keywords: amplify, provoke, and double strike. A creature with Amplify comes into play with a +1/+1 counter on it for each creature card that shared a type revealed from its controller's hand. When a creature with provoke attacks, it can untap an opponent's creature and force that creature to block it. Double strike was suggested on Magic's \"You Make the Card\" website, and allows a creature with it to deal both First Strike and regular combat damage. To compensate for the lack of instant and sorcery spells in \"Legions\", a number of creatures had triggered abilities when cycled or turned face up after being morphed.\n\nScourge expanded on the Cycling mechanic with landcycling, which allows you to cycle a card to search your library for a land of the cycling type rather than drawing a card. For example, a card with Plainscycling 2 could be cycled for 2 mana to find a Plains. Perhaps its most well-known new mechanic was Storm, which allows you to copy a spell multiple times equal to the number of other spells that have been played on the turn. Storm is considered to be one of the more degenerate mechanics in the game as the effects generated by Storm spells can get out of hand, when a player finds a way to play a high number of spells in a single turn. A number of cards rewarded players for playing spells with a converted mana cost of six or greater. Scourge also had a theme around Dragons, including the five \"dragon boons\", one for each color, which would bounce back from the graveyard to enchant an expensive creature you control that comes into play.\n\nNotable cards from \"Onslaught\" include the Fetchlands cycle (', ', ', ', and '), which were later reprinted in \"Khans of Tarkir\", ', ', ' and \n\nPerhaps the most notable card from \"Legions\" is the legendary Angel .\n\nNotable cards from \"Scourge\" include ' (The result of the first You Make The Card feature of magicthegathering.com), ', ' and '\n\n"}

They dominated the legitimate theater in vaudeville in the first half of the 20th centuries, promoting entertainment attuned to the popular taste.\n\nThe family's American history began with Duvvid Schubart (transliterated to \"Shubert\") and his wife Katrina (Gitel) Helwitz, who left their native town Vladislavov, Russian Empire (now Kudirkos Naumiestis, Lithuania) arriving in New York City from Hamburg- through England - on June 12, 1881 on the s/s \"Spain\" with their eight children. Two of them subsequently died. Later they settled in Syracuse, New York.\n\nThe three Shubert sons (Lee Shubert, Sam S. Shubert, and Jacob J. Shubert) had to forgo much in the way of formal education and go to work when they were very young. Introduced to the world of the theatre, the three brothers broke the monopoly on the theatre-management industry (represented by the Theatrical Syndicate under Abe Erlanger) and Mark Klaw in the foundation of rival agency the Shubert Organization, replacing it with their own.\n\nAmong the organization's Manhattan holdings are the renowned Winter Garden Theatre (at 1634 Broadway), the Sam S. Shubert (at 221 West 44th Street), and the Imperial Theatres. By 1924 they had 86 theatres in the United States. By 1953 they had produced 600 shows under their credits and had booked 1,000 shows into their numerous theatres. By the 1920s, they owned, operated, managed or booked over 1,000 theatres nationwide. \nIn 1942 they owned, leased or managed 20 of New York City's approximately 40 legitimate theatres and controlled some 15 in other cities. As of 2009, the Shubert Organization owns seventeen Broadway theatres in New York City, as well as the Shubert Theatre in Boston, the Forrest Theatre in Philadelphia, and manages the National Theatre in Washington, D.C. The organization also owns and operates the 5-stage Off-Broadway facility, New World Stages.\n\nJerry Stagg identifies Lee Shubert as the key creative partner, showing how he built the most successful theatrical empire in history. Stagg characterizes the trio as vulgar and uneducated , but acknowledges that they made a personal monopoly amassing millions of profits in the process. They opened new theater districts in many major American cities, employing thousands over the years. Entertainment and popular taste was the goal, rather than the dramatic arts. By 1924, they controlled 75 percent of all American theaters, producing 25 percent of all plays. Their actors in response created Actor's Equity as a labor union to counterbalance their power. When the Great Depression caused the bankruptcy of their corporate empire in 1933, they could have retired wealthy. Instead they kept the theater alive pouring their own money into the gamble. Almost alone they kept the legitimate theater alive in America. The federal government called them a monopoly, and in 1950 they were taken to court by the federal government. In 1955 Supreme Court ruling ruled that they were subject to antitrust laws, so they sold 12 theaters in six cities and give up the booking business there was the heart of their enterprise.\n\nMusical comedies;\nRevues;\nOperetta;\nThe Shubert children:\n\n\n"}

These grapes would later make way for the region's own style of delicate, cool-climate, maritime-influenced wines.\n\nThe Mount Benson vineyards are planted on gently undulating terrain ranging from five to 50 metres above sea level and attracted the interest of viticulturalists due to prevalent loam-based terra rossa soils that sit atop free-draining limestone, which formed over millions of years while the region was underwater. Shells and skeletal remains of marine animals deposited on the shallow sands of what is now the Limestone Coast, and under the ocean's weight these remains fused together to form a layer of soft limestone.\nTerra rossa soil, arguably the most famous vineyard soil in Australia, is produced as the limestone weathers and the clay contained in the rocks is left behind.

It marked a return to cinema for Fonda, being her first film since \"Stanley & Iris\" in 1990. The film was negatively received by critics who praised Fonda but panned Lopez and the screenplay. \"Monster-in-Law\" was a box office success, grossing $154 million on a $43 million budget.\n\nCharlie Cantilini (Jennifer Lopez) is a temp/dog walker/yoga instructor and aspiring fashion designer from Venice Beach, California, who meets doctor Kevin Fields (Michael Vartan). At first, she thinks he's gay because of a lie his vindictive ex-girlfriend Fiona (Monet Mazur) told her. But then Kevin asks her out and she believes that she has finally found the right man.\n\nThings start to sour when Kevin introduces Charlie to his mother, Viola (Jane Fonda), a former newscaster who has recently been replaced by a younger woman, causing her to have a meltdown and attack a guest on-air. Loathing Charlie immediately, Viola becomes more distraught when Kevin proposes to Charlie; she fears she'll lose her son the same way she lost her career. She sets out to ruin Kevin and Charlie's relationship, enlisting the help of her loyal assistant Ruby (Wanda Sykes). The two try everything possible to drive Charlie away, even tricking her into eating nuts, which triggers a severe allergic reaction.\n\nCharlie eventually catches onto Viola's plan and fights back by destroying her bedroom and tampering with her anti-psychotic medication. On Charlie's wedding day, Viola turns up wearing a white dress instead of the peach-colored one Charlie specially made for her. This leads to a violent standoff between the two, with Viola refusing to accept Charlie and stating she'll never be good enough for Kevin. Suddenly, Viola's own dreadful mother-in-law, Kevin's grandmother Gertrude (Elaine Stritch), appears and they have an indignant argument. Gertrude's resentment of Viola bears a strong resemblance to Viola's feelings of animosity toward Charlie, who decides to back down as she feels the same thing will happen to them in 30 years.\n\nCharlie exits to tell Kevin that the wedding is off to save his relationship with his mother. But before that can happen, Ruby enters and tells that Viola's efforts against Charlie to make Kevin happy are unwarranted. Viola ultimately realizes that she wants Charlie to stay, and they reconcile. Charlie then explains to Viola that she wants her to stay.\n\nCharlie and Kevin get married, and when Charlie throws her wedding bouquet, Viola catches it. As Charlie and Kevin drive away to their honeymoon, the film ends with Viola and Ruby walking out of the celebration, looking on.\n\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 17% based on 165 reviews, with an average rating of 3.5/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"While Jane Fonda steals the movie in her return to the screen, a tired script and flimsy performances make this borderline comedy fall flat.\" On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 31 out of 100, based on reviews from 38 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nRoger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave the film one out of possible four stars, saying: \"You do not keep Jane Fonda offscreen for 15 years, only to bring her back as a specimen of rabid Momism. You write a role for her. It makes sense. It fits her. You like her in it. It gives her a relationship with Jennifer Lopez that could plausibly exist in our time and space. It gives her a son who has not wandered over after the \"E.R.\" auditions. And it doesn't supply a supporting character who undercuts every scene she's in by being more on-topic than any of the leads.\" Joe Morgenstern of the \"Wall Street Journal\" also panned the movie, and used his review to deride the state of big-budget film-making, writing: \"Films like this ... are emblematic of Hollywood's relentless dumbing-down and defining-down of big-screen attractions. There's an audience for such stuff, but little enthusiasm or loyalty. Adult moviegoers are being ignored almost completely during all but the last two or three months of each year, while even the kids who march off to the multiplexes each weekend know they're getting moldy servings of same-old, rather than entertainments that feed their appetite for surprise and delight.\" Mick LaSalle of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" was one of the few critics who gave the film a positive review, writing: \"It's a crude, obvious comedy, which occasionally clunks, but it's often very funny, as well as being a really shrewd bit of popular entertainment. Its appeal resides in a lot of things, not the least of which is a sophisticated awareness of what an audience brings to it.\"\nThe film ran 849 sneak preview screenings on Mother's Day at 4pm, the Sunday before release. New Line's president of domestic distribution David Tuckerman publicly stated his doubts about this strategy but the film achieved 90% attendance and he stated \"the marketing department hit a home run.\" The film became a box-office success debuting at number #1 at the box office, earning $83 million as the domestic box office and a worldwide total of $154.7 million, against an estimated production budget of $43 million.\nLopez earned a Golden Raspberry Award nomination for Worst Actress for her performance in the film, but lost to Jenny McCarthy for \"Dirty Love\".\n\nThe two-disc set DVD was released on August 30, 2005 with these features: Audio Commentary, 7 Deleted Scenes, a Blooper Reel, and 4 Featurettes:\n\n\nOn October 13, 2014, it was reported that the Fox Broadcasting Company is developing a TV show based on the film with Amy B. Harris as creator.\n"}

It is a very high honour, second only after the \"Légion d’Honneur\" (Legion of Honour). Very few people, military units and communes were ever awarded it; and only for their deeds during World War II. A different order, the \"Médaille de la Résistance\" (\"Resistance Medal\"), was created and awarded for lesser but still distinguished deeds by members of the Resistance.\n\nThe \"Order of Liberation\" was established by General de Gaulle in order n° 7, signed in Brazzaville on November 16, 1940. The object of the Order was to \"reward people, of the military or civilian communities, who will have distinguished themselves in the task of liberating France and her Empire\".\n\nThere were no restrictions as to age, sex, rank, origin or nationality; nor any regarding the nature of the deeds, other than their exceptional quality.\n\nThe Order has a single rank, the title of \"Compagnon de la Libération\" (\"Companion of the Liberation\"). General de Gaulle, founder of the Order, was the only \"Grand Maître\" (\"Grand Master\") of the Order.\n\nThe Order was usually bestowed by the traditional French military ceremony of \"prise d'armes\". The recipient was summoned forward by rank and name, and given the insignia while being commended thus: \"Nous vous reconnaissons comme notre Compagnon pour la libération de la France dans l’honneur et par la Victoire\" (“We acknowledge you as our companion for the Liberation of France, in honour and by Victory”).\n\nThe last awards to French citizens, units and communes were made on 23 January 1946. Awards to foreign nationals were made until 1960.\n\nThe medal of the Order is called the \"Croix de la Libération\" (\"Cross of Liberation\"). It is a 31 mm wide by 33 mm high rectangular bronze shield bearing a 60 mm high vertical gladius on its obverse. On the blade of the gladius: a black enamelled Cross of Lorraine (symbol of the Free French Forces). On the reverse, in Latin: a relief inscription in bold letters on four rows, \"PATRIAM SERVANDO VICTORIAM TULIT\" (\"By serving the Fatherland, he/she achieved Victory\").\n\nThe award is suspended by a rectangular loop through the hilt of the gladius to a 36 mm wide silk moiré green ribbon with 4 mm wide black edge stripes and 1 mm wide black longitudinal stripes, 11 mm from the edges. Green represents hope, black represents mourning, symbolizing the state of France in 1940. The ribbon at first had diagonal black stripes, but the Order was only awarded in that form during August–September 1942.\n\nThe individuals, units and communities listed below were awarded the Order of Liberation\n\nA total of 1061 Crosses of Liberation were awarded:\n\n\nAmongst the 1036 Companions of the Order, 65 were killed before the end of the war (8 May 1945) and another 260 received the distinction posthumously. Members of the French resistance, especially the more famous ones, often received the Order under their \"nom de guerre\".\n\nSix women were awarded the title:\n\nNearly 10% of the recipients of the Order were younger than 20 at the beginning of the war. The youngest, Mathurin Henrio, was 14 when he was shot dead by Nazi officers for refusing to answer questions on the whereabouts of Maquisards.\n\nThe Order was re-opened twice to honour foreign personalities who helped liberate France:\n\n\nMilitary units as a whole have been awarded the title of \"Compagnon de la Libération\".\n\nOn June 18, 1996, at Mont Valérien, the 18 military units which had been awarded the Cross of Liberation were given a green and black fourragère by President Jacques Chirac.\n\n\n\n\n\nHeroic city which, since the crime of capitulation, has opposed a fierce resistance to any sort of collaboration with the enemy. Occupied by German troops and subjected to the harshest of repression, has given to the French, by numerous individual and collective actions, a magnificent example of courage and fidelity. By the blood of her martyred children, showed to the whole World the French will for national liberation.\n\n\nHeroic city at the vanguard of the French Resistance and of the fight for liberation. Draped in her pride, despite the arrest and the massacre of her best sons, put up a fierce fight to the Germans at every instant. Despising the interdictions given by the invaders and their accomplices, demonstrated on November 11, 1943 her certainty of Victory and her will to take part in it. On November 14, and on December 2, 1943, responded to the reprisals and the execution of the chiefs of the Resistance movements by the destruction of the ammunition depot, barracks, power plants and factories used by the enemy. Has served the Motherland well.\n\n\nCapital faithful to herself and to France, demonstrated, under the enemy occupation and oppression, and in spite of the voices of abandonment and treason, her unshakable resolution to fight on and to win. By her courage in the presence of the invader and by the indomitable energy with which she sustained the harshest of trials, deserved to remain as an example for the entire Nation. On August 19, in cooperation with the Allied and French armies, stood up to drive away the enemy through a series of glorious fights which began in the \"Cité\" and swiftly spread to all points of the city. In spite of heavy losses sustained by the French Forces of the Interior fighting within her, liberated itself through her own efforts and, united with the vanguard of the French Army that came to her rescue, has, on August 25, reduced the German to his last stands and made him capitulate.\n\n\nVillage of the Vercors which, thanks to the patriotism of her inhabitants, totally sacrificed herself for the cause of the French Resistance in 1944. Main parachuting centre for the Allied air force on the plateau, always helped by all means possible the military of the Maquis in the gathering of arms. Violently bombed on July 14, attacked by 24 German gliders on July 21 and 22, had 72 of her inhabitants massacred and the entirety of her houses burned down by a merciless enemy.

{"id": "1881896", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1881896", "title": "Tyrant (Resident Evil)", "text": "Tyrant (Resident Evil)\n\nTyrant is the code name of a series of boss characters in the \"Resident Evil\" horror video game series by Capcom, introduced in the original \"Resident Evil\" in 1996. Tyrants are towering, biologically engineered supersoldiers created and used by the sinister Umbrella Corporation. Tyrant creatures make appearances as boss characters in most \"Resident Evil\" games and the desire to create an obedient bioweapon lies at the core of the series' storyline. Tyrants also appear in other media and merchandise of the \"Resident Evil\" franchise, as well as in some unrelated games.\n\nSince their debut, the Tyrant series became one of the most recognisable and popular characters of the franchise. A particularly notable Tyrant is Nemesis, the title character of the video game \"\".\n\nCapcom artists went through a trial-and-error process designing the Tyrant creatures and their transformations. For example, the T-103 (more popularly known as \"Mr. X\" and sometimes also as \"Trenchcoat\") was originally envisioned as armed with firearms; in some sketches it can be seen wearing a respirator and various armored outfits instead of a trenchcoat (there were also other types of coats, including a labcoat), and even its overall physical build has varied greatly (from very slim to extremely muscular). The only consistent attribute of most Tyrant creature variations seems to be their large, exposed beating hearts which usually serve as their only vulnerable area.\n\nThe game series features many types of Tyrants as the result of several different experiments. Following the discovery of the Progenitor virus, the Umbrella Corporation’s founders become eager to create a Bio-Organic Weapon (BOW) that is both powerful and capable of following orders. Prior to the events of \"Resident Evil Zero\", Umbrella used the Progenitor virus to create the Tyrant virus (T-virus), which they believe can be used to manufacture powerful organisms. A problem with the virus’ compatibility with humans set the project back, as only humans with a very rare genetic makeup are capable of mutating into potent and manageable life forms; only one in a million people are estimated to be compatible. Umbrella eventually overcame this setback by resorting to using clones of Sergei Vladimir, one of their executives who happens to be genetically compatible. These mass-produced Tyrants were given the label, T-103.\n\nThe events of \"Resident Evil Zero\" and \"Resident Evil\" chronicle the Umbrella Corporation's development of the Tyrant prototypes, the T-001 (the Proto-Tyrant) and T-002. Though the early Tyrants are defeated in their first encounters, Umbrella manages to use the battle data from those defeats to produce other, more efficient Tyrants in the later installments of \"Resident Evil\". Numerous Tyrants have been created throughout the game series' storyline, such as Tyrant T-078 and the mass-produced Bandersnatches from \"\", Hypnos from \"Resident Evil Survivor\", Thanatos from \"Resident Evil Outbreak\" and Tyrant R from \"\" each with its own defining characteristics. A revamped version of Tyrant also existed in \"Resident Evil 5\" during the game's development, but not in the finished product. The final boss battle of \"Resident Evil: Revelations\" might also be called a variation of the Tyrant (created by that game's T-Abyss virus), but this is debatable.\n\nTyrants have been consistently depicted as grotesque and brutally violent creatures, but their intelligence has varied. The first two Tyrants in \"Resident Evil Zero\" and \"Resident Evil\" are depicted as unintelligent, while the T-103 models such as the T-00 (Mr. X) in \"Resident Evil 2\" and the titular Nemesis T-Type in \"\" are shown to possess limited intelligence and the ability to carry out specific instructions. Both Nemesis-T Type and the T-103 series (two more T-103 Tyrants, code-named Ivan, appear in \"\") are prone to uncontrolled mutation when damaged. Alexia Ashford in \"Code Veronica\" retains her full intelligence after being exposed to the T-Veronica virus and gains psychic abilities, including pyrokinesis; similarly, the TG-virus mutated Morpheus D. Duvall in \"\" (Tyrant T-092) gains bio-electric abilities. The weapons used by Tyrants have also varied; while most Tyrants in the \"Resident Evil\" series rely on sheer physical force to subdue opponents, Nemesis, retaining some intelligence due to the Nemesis parasite, is able to use a shoulder-fired hand-held rocket launcher (and a minigun in \"\") and T-ALOS (Tyrant-Armored Lethal Organic System) in \"The Umbrella Chronicles\" is equipped with a shoulder-mounted multiple rocket launcher.\n\nOutside of the \"Resident Evil\" franchise, there is a Tyrant card in the NDS version of \"\". In \"\", Jill Valentine has a special move that calls forth a Tyrant. A prototype Tyrant appears in the background of the Tricell Laboratory stage in \"\"; Tyrant was considered for addition as a playable character, but was rejected over concerns about the game's ESRB rating. The Nemesis T-Type was later added as a playable character in \"Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3\".\n\nThe Tyrant Fossil appears only in the novel \"\". In the third \"Resident Evil\" live-action film, \"\" (and its novelization), Umbrella's researcher Dr. Alexander Isaacs tries to subdue his mutation with an antivirus after being bitten by an enhanced zombie. He is shot for insubordination by an executive, Alexander Slater, and is immediately reanimated as a Tyrant. Compared to most of the Tyrants from the games, Isaacs retains his mental faculties and personality even after his mutation. A new version of Tyrant resembling the T-078 with the power limiter appears in the CG film \"\".\n\nSeveral Tyrant action figures were released by various manufacturers, including these by Toy Biz in 1998 (T-002 and T-103), Moby Dick Toys in 2001 (four T-103 Tyrants), Palisades Toys in 2001 (T-103) and 2002 (T-002), and NECA in 2007 (T-002). A 1:6 scale (35 cm) resin figure of T-002 in \"Umbrella Chronicles\" was also released by Gaya Entertainment and a PVC statuette was released by Organic, both in 2008. Since 2011, various Tyrant \"infected\" cards were featured in Bandai's \"Resident Evil Deck Building Game\". In 2012, \"Resident Evil\" theme restaurant Biohazard Cafe & Grill S.T.A.R.S. in Tokyo was furnished with one-to-one scale Tyrant prop made by the special effects studio creating costumes for Toei Company's tokusatsu heroes; the exposition is a central part of the restaurant.\n\nIn 2009, IGN featured the Tyrants in the lists of the best \"Resident Evil\" bosses and the series' best villains (readers' choice). That same year, the Tyrant was included among the 12 characters and creatures that the staff of IGN would like see to return in \"Resident Evil 6\", commenting that \"almost as much a hallmark of the \"RE\" franchise as the zombie, the Tyrant is a recurring favorite.\" IGN added: \"\"Resident Evil\" is supposed to be a terrifying experience, and much of the terror stems from pitting players against foes who completely outmatch them. That's the Tyrant in a nutshell.\" IGN also included an \"any type of Tyrant\" in their dream roster for \"Marvel vs. Capcom 3\". In 2012, \"PlayStation Official Magazine\" ranked Tyrant as the seventh top \"Resident Evil\" monster (in addition to Nemesis placing fifth). That same year, IGN ranked the T-002 as the best boss in the series, adding that \"even 15 years later, \"Resident Evil\" games continue to use this formula (and its finish) as a blueprint for bosses.\"\n\nIn 2000, GameSpot ranked Tyrant as the tenth best villain in video gaming. In 2013, \"Complex\" ranked the original Tyrant as the 13th greatest soldier in video games, the encounter with it as the 25th best boss battle of all time, and the second Tyrant fight in \"Code: Veronica\" as the 46th hardest boss battle in video game history. Some publications also singled out the Tyrant T-103 model (Mr. X) for a special acclaim. In 2010, PSU.com included the scene of Mr. X suddenly busting through a brick wall in \"Resident Evil 2\" on the list of ten \"pant-wetting PlayStation moments\". PSU.com also featured Mr. X, along with the T-002 and Nemesis, on their 2011 list of the \"seven badass bosses\" in the 15 years of \"Resident Evil\". That same year, \"Empire\" ranked it as the 39th greatest video game character overall, adding that \"Nemesis never quite captured the silent dread of Mr. X.\"\n"}
{"id": "1881899", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1881899", "title": "Southern Decadence", "text": "Southern Decadence\n\nSouthern Decadence is an annual six-day event held in New Orleans, Louisiana, by the gay and lesbian community during Labor Day Weekend, culminating in a parade through the French Quarter on the Sunday before Labor Day.\n\nThe event traces its beginnings to August 1972, as an end-of-summer party among a group of 40–50 friends both straight and gay. They billed their event as \"Southern Decadence Party: Come As Your Favorite Southern Decadent.\" People who attended were required to dress as their favorite decadent Southerner. Two weeks later, the group threw another party as a farewell to Michael Evers, who left to join his lover, David Randolph, in Michigan. The first small \"walking parade\" occurred the following year when the participants first met at Johnny Matassa's Bar in the French Quarter to show off their costumes and then walk back home to Belle Reve, a name taken from A Streetcar Named Desire, in the Tremé neighbourhood via Esplanade Avenue. This first group impersonated people and characters ranging from Belle Watling (the prostitute character in \"Gone With the Wind\") and Mary Ann Mobley to Tallulah Bankhead and Helen Keller. The event expanded with Frederick Douglas Wright, an African American, appointed as the first grand marshal by members of the original group in 1974, who would have complete control over the parade of incredible characters and costumes as they marched through the French Quarter.\n\nDecadence, as it is commonly known by participants, is marked by parades, bead tossing, street parties and dance parties. In these ways it resembles New Orleans Mardi Gras, however, Southern Decadence tends to be more sexual in tone and is generally geared towards more upscale and mature revelers. Decadence crowds in the Quarter typically match or exceed Mardi Gras crowds. Most events take place in or around the French Quarter neighbourhood centered at the intersection of Bourbon and St. Ann streets.\n\nCrowds range from 100,000 to 300,000 revelers from across the nation and world. In 2018, there were over 250,000 participants and the positive economic impact on the City of New Orleans was estimated at over $275 million.\n\nDecadence caters primarily to gay men, but is still lesbian friendly. Dykes on Bikes and other lesbian groups participate in the annual parade in the French Quarter and GrrlSpot (lesbian party promoter) sponsors a few events for lesbians.\n\nThemes were presented on and off from the beginning, but did not become a consistent fixture of the event until \"Plagues, Pests, Parasites\" theme in 1988. They have been featured every year that the Decadence has been held since then. They have ranged from themes as varied as \"Voodoo That You Do\", \"Menage à Trois\", \"Ancient Truths, Lies, and Sacrifice\", and \"Hurricane: This Year, They Blow Back.\"\n\nThe theme for 2018 was \"House of Bourbon -- Unleash Your Beast.\" The official colors were Royal Blue and Canary Yellow.\nThe theme for 2019 was “Fruit Salad: Come Toss A Good Time” and the official “colors” are Polka Dots and Pinstripes. The theme and colors for 2020 will be announced in June.\n\nIn years past, religious and conservative groups have rallied against the festival. In 2003 there was a formal petition filed to have the event terminated, with video footage handed over to officials depicting dozens of men engaged in \"public sex acts\". There were examples of men exposing themselves to others for beads, similar to the way women have long exposed their breasts for the traditional Mardi Gras balcony bead toss. The complaints led to a vocal response from business owners and hoteliers in New Orleans, in support of the festival. Ultimately the police posted notices clarifying what constitutes public sex. The pastor who spearheaded, videotaped, and filed the petition, Grant Storms was arrested in February 2011 after being caught masturbating in a public park. He was convicted of obscenity on August 22, 2012.\n\nThe city later passed an ordinance that effectively banned the dissemination of any social, political, or religious message on Bourbon Street from sunrise to sunset, punishable by up to six months in jail and a $500 fine. City Councilwoman Kristin Palmer, who sponsored the ordinance, said the city \"has a legitimate interest in protecting residents and visitors in the highly trafficked area of Bourbon Street at night. She said aggressive solicitation can be a crowd-control issue, and people are allowed under the law to speak their messages if they take five steps off Bourbon Street. This is really an issue of trying to protect public safety.\"\n\nNine preachers and activists were subsequently arrested on September 1, 2012, after they allegedly yelled slurs at people attending Southern Decadence on Bourbon Street. Represented by the American Civil Liberties Union during the first round of their case, those arrested saw the law temporarily suspended via a restraining order that was granted by a federal judge.\n\nLater the New Orleans City Council voted to lift the ordinance against the 2011 ban against Street Preaching from sunset to sunrise on the city's famous Bourbon Street.\n\nThe unconstitutionally of the city restrictions which (prohibited a person or group from gathering on Bourbon Street) \"for the purpose of disseminating any social, political or religious message\" was \"so patently unconstitutional that they could not hope the judge would rule otherwise\", said attorney Nate Kellum with the Center for Religious Expression.\n\nIn the year 2005, that year's edition of Southern Decadence was officially cancelled in the wake of safety precautions against Hurricane Katrina. However, a very small group of residents who still remained in the French Quarter celebrated the event anyway. An abbreviated parade took place in the French Quarter with some two dozen participants. Most were French Quarter hold-outs; there were also at least a couple of people who had to wade in through flooded streets from other neighbourhoods to get there. As the city was officially being evacuated at the time, a police officer at first attempted to stop the small observation of tradition, but one of the participants was able to produce the parade permit issued pre-Katrina showing it was a scheduled legal event, and the small procession was allowed to continue. National media reporters noted the event. It was the first parade in New Orleans after the hurricane, the most recent previous New Orleans parade having been the Krewe of OAK \"Midsummer Mardi Gras\" parade the night before the city's mandatory evacuation.\n\nWith the theme \"Southern Decadence Rebirth\", the event rebounded in 2006, attracting near-normal crowds.\n\nIn 2007, the Bourbon Street Extravaganza, annually hosted by Napoleon's Itch, saw Deborah Cox, Fredrick Ford, Jeanie Tracy and Mat Jordan headline the festival.\n\nDue to the approach of Hurricane Gustav in 2008 and a mandatory evacuation notice, some events on Saturday and all official Southern Decadence events after Sunday, August 31 midday were cancelled that year. As a result of Sunday's parade being cancelled, the 2008 Southern Decadence Grand Marshals, Paloma (Samson Utley) and Tittie Toulouse (Gary Delaune), returned for 2009. However, as was the case with 2005, a small group of French Quarter residents still celebrated the 2008 event anyway with an \"unofficial\" parade taking place once again in the French Quarter. That parade had some two-dozen participants, just like three years earlier.\n\nWith the theme \"Hurricane: This Year, They Blow Back\", the event once again rebounded as a whole in 2009, attracting near-normal crowds.\n"}

{"id": "1881917", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1881917", "title": "Nettlebed", "text": "Nettlebed\n\nNettlebed is a village and civil parish in the Chiltern Hills about northwest of Henley-on-Thames in Oxfordshire and southeast of Wallingford. The parish includes the hamlet of Crocker End, about east of the village. The 2011 Census recorded a parish population of 727.\n\nIt is claimed that in the 17th century a \"Palæolithic floor\" was found in Nettlebed Common.\n\nMesolithic flint microliths and cores have been found in the parish.\n\nThe earliest known records of the name \"Nettlebed\" are from the 13th century. The \"Inquisitiones post mortem\" record it as \"Netelbedde\" in AD 1252 and 1276. The name does mean a nettlebed: a place overgrown with nettles.\n\nNettlebed village is on an ancient route through the Chiltern Hills between Henley and Wallingford, which for centuries was part of a trunk route between London and Oxford. The road between Henley and Wallingford was made into a turnpike in 1736 and ceased to be a turnpike in 1873. It is now classified the A4130.\nNettlebed's strategic position led to its having several pubs, inns and coaching inns. They included the White Hart, which is 17th-century, and the Bull Inn and Sun Inn, which are 18th-century. Only the White Hart in the High Street is still trading.\n\nNettlebed had a sub-post office and general store in Watlington Street. It has now ceased trading and is a private house.\n\nIn 2012 Thierry Kelaart and Patrick Heathcote-Amory, son of Sir Ian Heathcote-Amory were married at St Bartholomew's parish church. Michael Middleton acted as father of the bride and guests included the Duchess of Cambridge.\n\nThe house at 25, High Street, also known as the Old Priest House, is a Grade II listed building. The building is probably 16th-century with an 18th-century front and 19th-century windows.\n\nThe Church of England parish of Saint Bartholomew was originally a chapelry of the adjacent parish of Benson. There is a record of the Empress Matilda giving the benefice of Benson, including chapels at Nettlebed and Warborough, to the Augustinian Abbey at nearby Dorchester, Oxfordshire in about AD 1140.\n\nThe Mediæval church building was replaced in 1845–46 by the present Gothic Revival brick building, designed by a member of the Hakewill family of architects. The only surviving part of the previous church is the lower stages of the brick west tower, which seems to be 18th-century.\n\nThe church has some 20th-century stained glass windows, including two made in 1970 by John Piper and Patrick Reyntiens. One is the chancel east window, in which a central tree of life is flanked by fish on one side and butterflies on the other. The other is the baptistery south window in the south aisle. This shows a tree of life with birds perching in it including an owl, a hawk and a pheasant.\n\nThe tower has a ring of six bells, all cast by Charles and George Mears of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry in 1846.\n\nBricks, tiles and pottery were made in Nettlebed from the second half of the 14th century until the 1930s. In the 15th century Nettlebed supplied ceramic tiles to Abingdon Abbey and bricks to Stonor House. The name \"Crocker End\" means \"Potter's End\". One remaining brick \"bottle kiln\" is preserved in Nuffield. It may be 17th-century. It is a Grade II* listed building.\n\nIn 1674 George Ravenscroft obtained from Nettlebed the sand used in the make the first flint glass.\n\nNettlebed had what seems to have been the only smock mill in Oxfordshire. It used to be at Chinnor but was moved to a windier site at Nettlebed in about 1825. It was a slender octagonal building with four common sails and a fantail. It burned down in 1912.\n\nThe village has a long-established and highly regarded folk club which holds concerts on Monday evenings from 8pm at The Village Club in Nettlebed High Street. The Folk Song Club is a volunteer run, non-profit organisation. It was founded in July 1975 at the Bull Inn. When Brakspear Brewery closed the Bull Inn in 1991, the club moved to its present venue, which has capacity for 200 people.\n\nMany notable singers and musicians have performed at the club. They include Martin Carthy, Fairport Convention, John Kirkpatrick, Ralph McTell, Show of Hands, Steeleye Span, Richard Thompson.\n\nThe Club is also known for special performances such as its \"Feast of Fiddles'\" where a mix of leading national performers and local artists provide themed evenings. In 2002 the club won the BBC Radio 2 Folk Club of the Year Award.\n\nThames Travel bus route X38 links Nuffield with Wallingford and Oxford in one direction and Henley and Reading, Berkshire in the other. It stops on the A4130 main road at Nettlebed Green, near the brick kiln at the east end of the village. Buses run generally hourly from Mondays to Saturdays. There is no Sunday service.\n\n\n\n\n"}

On 31 August 1986, \"Admiral Nakhimov\" collided with the large bulk carrier \"Pyotr Vasev\" in the Tsemes Bay, near the port of Novorossiysk, Russian SFSR, and quickly sank. In total, 423 of the 1,234 people on board died.\n\n\"Berlin\" was built by Bremer Vulkan at Vegesack, Germany (Yard 614) and was completed in March 1925. She was launched on 25 March 1925, and commissioned on 17 September 1925. The ship was long, had four decks and a volume of . She originally operated the Bremen – Southampton – Cherbourg – New York City run for the North German Lloyd Line.\n\nThe ship's main route was between Bremerhaven, Southampton and New York, which she began on 26 September 1925 and operated until May 1939 when she was laid up in Bremerhaven for refitting. On 12 November 1928, \"Berlin\" rescued the passengers and crew of the liner , which sank off the coast of Virginia en route from New York City to Barbados. An estimated 113 people died in the sinking.\n\n\"Berlin\" was chartered by the Nazis in 1939 as a Strength Through Joy (Kraft durch Freude, KdF) workers' cruising ship and was used as a hospital ship later on in World War II.\n\n\"Berlin\" was one of eight German ships commissioned as hospital ships (\"Lazarettschiffe\") during World War II. Most, if not all, of these ships also served in other capacities during the war after being decommissioned as hospital ships, mainly as accommodation or transport ships for military personnel. All German hospital ships were given alphabetic identifiers, \"Berlin\"s being 'A'. On 16 July 1939, \"Berlin\" began her conversion to hospital ship and entered service with the \"Kriegsmarine\" as Lazarettschiff A, Sanitätsamt Ost on 23 August 1939. The ship had berthing for 400 patients, with a crew of 165. Initially serving in Norwegian waters, she was identified as \"Field Post Number 07520\". By January 1945, \"Berlin\" was assigned to Operation Hannibal, the transport of refugees and soldiers from the Eastern Baltic. On 31 January 1945, while forming up in convoy to head east, \"Berlin\" struck a mine off Swinemünde, and was put in tow for Kiel.\nShe then hit another mine and was beached (23.53 hr, at position 54°02.6 N/14°19 E, in shallow waters). There was one fatality. All usable equipment was salvaged by 5 February 1945, and the ship was abandoned.\n\nShe was refloated and salvaged by the Soviets in 1949 and renamed \"Admiral Nakhimov\" after Admiral Pavel Nakhimov, a 19th-century Russian naval commander who played a prominent role in the Crimean War. After her conversion, her size was increased to . She entered passenger service for the Black Sea Steamship Company in 1957. In 1962, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, the ship was used to transport soldiers to Cuba.\n\nDuring the peak summer travel season, \"Admiral Nakhimov\" operated cruises on the Black Sea between Odessa and Batumi, a six-day round trip. She carried an average of 1,000 people per voyage. She was the flagship of the Black Sea passenger fleet for several years until more modern liners entered service.\n\nAt 10:00 p.m. Moscow Time on 31 August 1986, \"Admiral Nakhimov\" sailed from Novorossiysk en route to Sochi, its next stop. There were 888 passengers and 346 crew members aboard. Most of the passengers were Ukrainian, with others from Russia, Moldova, the Baltic republics and Central Asia. The captain of the ship was Vadim Markov.\n\nJust minutes into the voyage, the ship's pilot noticed that the large bulk carrier \"Pyotr Vasev\" was on a collision course with \"Admiral Nakhimov\". \"Pyotr Vasev\" was a Japanese-built, 18,604-ton freighter recently acquired by the Soviet Union, and was carrying a cargo of oats and barley from Canada. The pilot radioed a warning to \"Pyotr Vasev\", and the freighter responded, \"Don't worry. We will pass clear of each other. We will take care of everything.\"\n\nDespite the message, Captain Viktor Tkachenko of \"Pyotr Vasev\" did nothing to slow his ship or change course. Convinced that the freighter would pass without incident, Captain Markov of \"Admiral Nakhimov\" retired to his cabin, leaving his second mate Alexander Chudnovsky in charge. From 11:00 p.m., Chudnovsky radioed \"Pyotr Vasev\" several times, asking about her course and her further actions. Chudnovsky changed the ship's course 10 degrees portside. At 11:10 p.m., Chundovsky cried on VHF to the freighter, \"Immediately reverse full astern!\" When it was clear that the freighter was headed directly for the ship, \"Pyotr Vasyov\"s engines were thrown in reverse. \"Admiral Nakhimov\" turned hard to port, but it was too late.\n\nAt 11:12 p.m., \"Admiral Nakhimov\" was struck by \"Pyotr Vasev\" from the port at Novorossiysk and from shore, at While many passengers had gone to bed by this time, some were on deck listening and dancing to music. They could only watch helplessly as the freighter rammed into the starboard side of the ship at a speed of about . \"Admiral Nakhimov\" continued forward with the freighter's bow in its side, ripping a hole in the hull between the engine and boiler rooms.\n\n\"Admiral Nakhimov\" immediately took on a list on her starboard side, and her lights went out upon impact. After a few seconds, the emergency diesel generator powered on, but the lights went out again two minutes later, plunging the sinking ship into darkness. People below decks found themselves lost in the dark and rapidly canting hallways.\n\nThere was no time to launch the lifeboats. Hundreds of people dived into the oily water, clinging to lifejackets, barrels and pieces of debris.\n\n\"Admiral Nakhimov\" sank in only eight minutes. Rescue ships began arriving just 10 minutes after the ship went down. \"Pyotr Vasev\" was not badly damaged, and assisted in the rescue effort. Sixty-four rescue ships and 20 helicopters rushed to the scene, and 836 people were pulled from the water. Some people were so slick with fuel oil that they could not keep hold of the hands of their rescuers. Sailors had to jump into the water to save people.\n\n\"Admiral Nakhimov\" lacked proper ventilation, which was the reason all 90 windows in the cabins were open during the accident. The bulkheads that would have prevented the ship from sinking were removed during the conversion.\n\nPassengers and crew had little time to escape, and 423 of the 1,234 on board perished. Sixty-four of those killed were crew members and 359 were passengers.\n\nThe event was not reported in the news for forty eight hours. The survivors were only allowed to send telegrams saying \"Alive and well in Novorossiysk.\"\n\nThe wreck of \"Admiral Nakhimov\" lies on its starboard side in of water in Tsemes Bay off Novorossiysk.\n\n\"Pyotr Vasev\" was renamed and operated under other flags until 2012.\n\nThe Soviet government formed a commission of inquiry to investigate the disaster. It determined that both Captain Markov of \"Admiral Nakhimov\" and Captain Tkachenko of \"Pyotr Vasev\" had violated navigational safety rules. Despite repeated orders to let \"Admiral Nakhimov\" pass, Tkachenko refused to slow his ship and only reported the accident 40 minutes after it occurred. Captain Markov was absent from the bridge. The inquiry took place in 1987 in Odessa. Both Captains Markov and Tkachenko were found guilty of criminal negligence and sentenced to 15 years in prison. Both were released in 1992.\n\n\n\n"}

They compete in the Isle of Man Football League. The team wear yellow and black stripes kit and play their home games at Croit Lowey in Port Erin. They have been Isle of Man League Champions ten times and won the Manx FA Cup nine times.\n\nFormed in September 1910 following a civic meeting at St Catherines Church Hall in Port Erin. The club motto is \"Moryn Vannin\", which in Manx roughly means \"The Pride of Mann\". The club has a reserve team who compete in the Isle of Man Football Combination as well as a ladies team and a junior academy.\n\nRushen's first trophy came in the 1921–22 season when they won the Railway Cup. They won the Manx FA Cup for the first time in 1923–24 and were crowned Isle of Man champions for the first time in 1925–26, when they also won the Manx FA Cup and the Hospital Cup.\n\nThe club's highest profile match came in July 2005 in front of 3,288 spectators at the National Sports Centre in Douglas when Bolton Wanderers beat Rushen United 10–0. Bolton included eight first team regulars including striker Kevin Davies who scored four times in the first 28 minutes as well as Kevin Nolan, Henrik Pedersen and Gary Speed all of whom also scored. The match was filmed by Sky Sports to be featured on the stations Premier League Preview Show. It was also a fund raiser for the club's proposed new indoor training facility for which the club needed to raise £250,000. They managed to raise a total of £35,000 from the match and a Gala Dinner.\n\nLocally, the club's biggest game each year is against Peel. The rivalry is believed to have begun as many of Peel's players were fishermen. Whilst Port Erin and nearby Port St Mary both had teams prior to the formation of Rushen United, many of the players in these teams also went to sea. Also, both clubs are overlooked by \"Towers\". Peel have Corrins Folly and Rushen have Milners Tower, which stands sentry to Port Erin Bay.\n\nDuring 2002, and at the age of 50, club stalwart Eric Nelson played his 1000th game during a Division One fixture against Pulrose United at Croit Lowey, and was presented with a memento to mark the occasion. During the late 1970s and up to the late 1980s, the club won the First Division seven times in eleven seasons, including four years on the trot from 1977 to 1981. As of the 2008–09 season they are still in the top flight in Isle of Man football, which in 2007 was rebranded as the Sure Mobile Premier League.\n\nOn 5 May 2010, Rushen clinched its first Premier League title with a 2–0 victory over Michael United thanks to goals from Josh Kelly and Steve Riding. This brought a period of 22 years since winning Manx football's top prize to an end and ensured that the club will enter its centenary year as champions. In April 2011 a comprehensive victory over Laxey in the Isle of Man FA Cup final gave the 'Spaniards' their first FA Cup win for 21 years.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1881922", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1881922", "title": "Minotaur-C", "text": "Minotaur-C\n\nMinotaur-C (\"Minotaur Commercial\"), formerly known as Taurus or Taurus XL, is a four stage solid fueled launch vehicle built in the United States by Orbital Sciences (now Northrop Grumman) and launched from SLC-576E at California's Vandenberg Air Force Base. It is based on the air-launched Pegasus rocket from the same manufacturer, utilizing a \"zeroth stage\" in place of an airplane. The Minotaur-C is able to carry a maximum payload of around 1,458 kg into a Low Earth Orbit.\n\nFirst launched in 1994, it has successfully completed seven out of a total of ten military and commercial missions. Three of four launches between 2001 and 2011 ended in failure, including the February 24, 2009 launch of the Orbiting Carbon Observatory mission and the March 4, 2011 launch of the Glory mission, which resulted in losses totalling $700 million for NASA (excluding the cost of the rockets themselves). The Taurus launch vehicle was subsequently rebranded in 2014 as Minotaur-C, which incorporates new avionics based on those used by the Minotaur family of rockets. After a six years pause, the rocket successfully returned to flight in 2017 as Minotaur-C.\n\nThe Minotaur-C's first stage, an Orbital ATK Castor 120, is based on a Peacekeeper ICBM first stage. Stages 2 and 3 are Orion-50s (like the Pegasus-1 but without wings or stabilisers), and stage 4 is an Orion 38, derived from the Pegasus-3.\n\nDifferent configurations are designated using a four-digit code, similar to the numbering system used on Delta rockets. The first digit denotes the type of first stage being used, and whether the second and third stages use a standard or \"XL\" configuration. The second digit denotes the diameter of the payload fairing. The third digit denotes the type of fourth stage. The fourth digit denotes an optional fifth stage, so far unused.\n\nOn September 21, 2001, a Taurus XL rocket failed during launch.\nWhen the second stage ignited at T+83 seconds, a nozzle gimbal actuator drive shaft seized for approximately 5 seconds causing loss of control. The vehicle recovered and continued to fly the mission profile, but failed to reach a stable orbit and reentered near Madagascar.\n\nOn February 24, 2009, a Taurus XL rocket failed during the launch of the $270m Orbiting Carbon Observatory spacecraft. Liftoff occurred successfully at 09:55 GMT from Vandenberg Air Force Base, but data received at a later stage of the flight suggested that the fairing failed to separate. The rocket did not reach orbit, owing to the extra weight of the fairing. Launch vehicle and services for OCO are estimated at $54m. The replacement satellite, Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2, was launched July 2, 2014 aboard a Delta II rocket.\n\nOn March 4, 2011, a Taurus XL rocket failed again during the launch of NASA's $424 million Glory climate change monitoring satellite. In total, the last two failures of the Taurus XL have resulted in payload losses worth $700 million. The reason for the failure was the same as with OCO: the payload fairing failed to separate, although the rocket's manufacturer Orbital Sciences Corporation had spent the last two years trying to fix the problem and had made several design changes to the fairing separation system. Ronald Grabe, manager of Orbital Sciences Corporation, which also built the Glory satellite itself, said the employees of his companies are \"pretty devastated\" because of the latest failure. The fairing was built by the Vermont Composites company, and the frangible rail pyrotechnic separation system was built by the Ensign-Bickford Company. A NASA MIB panel concluded that the failure was most likely caused by a section of the frangible rail somewhere near the nose cap failing to separate. While a root cause could not be identified, two likely causes were identified: the rubber charge holder in the frangible rail slumping due to launch acceleration and random vibration, or a failure of the frangible rail system due to it operating outside the environment for which it was tested.\n\nA continued investigation eventually revealed that sub-standard parts with falsified test results were the likely cause of both of the OCO and Glory fairing failures.\n\nThe upper stages of the Minotaur-C are used by the boost vehicle of the Ground-Based Interceptor, the anti-ballistic missile component of the U.S. Missile Defense Agency's Ground-Based Midcourse Defense system.\n\n\n"}

Aziz Mahmud Hudayi read the first Friday prayer in this mosque on its opening.\n\nThe Jelveti order was not as widespread and did not extend much further than the borders of modern Turkey having a number of tekkes in the Balkans. Among the most famous of Jelveti Sheikhs are Ismail Hakki Bursevi of Bursa, Osman Fazli, and Sheikh Mustafa Devati. A prominent Jelveti sheikh in Ottoman Bosnia was Mustafa Gaibi. Aziz Mahmud Hudayi is buried in Üsküdar, Istanbul and is something of the patron saint of Asian Istanbul.\n\n"}
{"id": "1881959", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1881959", "title": "Loop Parkway", "text": "Loop Parkway\n\nThe Loop Parkway (also known as the Loop) is a parkway in Nassau County, New York, in the United States. It serves the barrier islands south of Long Island itself, beginning on Long Beach Barrier Island at an intersection with Lido Boulevard in Point Lookout. From here, it heads generally east–west across Alder and Meadow islands to an interchange with the Meadowbrook State Parkway on Jones Island, a part of Jones Beach State Park located just north of Jones Beach Island. The islands served by the Loop Parkway are separated by narrow channels of water, all of which connect to Jones Inlet. The parkway is maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) and inventoried by the department as New York State Route 908C (NY 908C), an unsigned reference route.\n\nThe highway was built in 1934 as the Long Beach Loop Causeway, funded with money from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. It was completed six months ahead of schedule and officially opened on October 27, 1934, by Robert Moses, then a candidate for Governor of New York, and New York City Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia. The plans to fund the highway included the implementation of tolls, which went into effect on January 2, 1935. These tollbooths, once considered the murder site of Sonny Corleone in Mario Puzo's \"The Godfather\", were closed in 1978 as part of Governor Hugh Carey's efforts to establish that year's state budget.\n\nThe Loop Parkway begins at an at-grade intersection with Lido Boulevard on the eastern end of Long Beach Barrier Island in the neighborhood of Point Lookout. It proceeds north as a four-lane divided highway, crossing over Reynolds Channel to reach Alder Island, one of several islands comprising Jones Beach State Park. Here, the road slowly bends eastward as it runs across the marshy island. Two U-turn ramps are built into the median near the western end of the island, serving as the only intersections or interchanges of any kind on Alder Island. The Loop Parkway heads east from Alder Island, traversing Long Creek on a drawbridge leading to Meadow Island. The road quickly continues northeast across the island with no connections via interchanges or intersections.\n\nAt the eastern edge of the island, the highway reaches Swift Creek, another channel separating Meadow Island from Jones Island. The parkway crosses the waterway and immediately enters a trumpet interchange with the Meadowbrook State Parkway. The right-of-way of the Loop Parkway connects to and from the northbound direction of the Meadowbrook Parkway while two other ramps provide access to the southbound Meadowbrook Parkway. The Loop Parkway handled an average of 30,520 vehicles per day in 2011 according to estimates made by NYSDOT. Traffic along the highway has steadily increased since 2003, when the department recorded a daily average of 24,740 vehicles.\n\nThe Loop Parkway, originally envisioned as the Long Beach Loop Causeway, was conceived as part the original design for the Long Island Parkway System, developed by Robert Moses and the Long Island State Park Commission (LISPC) in 1924. Moses wanted a parkway system to alleviate congestion on \"unattractive\" local roads. The system was designed to connect several parks that were under construction at the time, including Jones Beach State Park, Bethpage State Park and Sunken Meadow State Park. In 1927, the parkway system was linked to parkways within New York City's boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens, and in 1929, Jones Beach State Park and the Ocean Parkway opened, providing access to the mainland via the Jones Beach Causeway (now part of the Wantagh State Parkway).\nIn May 1933, construction began on the Meadowbrook State Parkway and the Long Beach Loop Causeway. It was financed by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation in Washington D.C., which loaned $5,050,000 (1933 USD) to the LISPC for the new parkways. It was proposed that the loan would be repaid in 25 years. The two highways would be connected by way of a trumpet interchange on Jones Island, with a total of of hydraulic fill was used to build both parkways, and a new channel for boats heading to South Oyster Bay was constructed as part of the projects. The roadway of the Loop Causeway would be made of macadam pavement and be wide and help connect mainland Long Island to Jones Beach and Long Beach.\n\nBoth roadways were expected to be completed by January 1, 1935. They were ultimately completed in October 1934, six months ahead of schedule. The Long Beach Loop Causeway was opened to extreme fanfare on October 27, 1934, as was the Meadowbrook State Parkway with parades celebrating the event were held in Freeport and Rockville Centre, and they were attended by Robert Moses, at the time a candidate for Governor of New York, and Fiorello LaGuardia, the Mayor of New York City.\n\nWhen the Jones Beach State Park Authority was given the loan by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation in March 1933, a toll was planned for both the Meadowbrook Causeway and the Long Beach Loop Causeway to help repay the loan. Tollbooths were constructed, and a 25-cent toll (1935 USD) went into effect on both roadways on January 2, 1935. On that day, the supervisor with the LISPC reported that 300 people used the highway.\n\nIn 1975, the Jones Beach Parkway Authority raised the toll on the Southern State Parkway to 25 cents, while the Loop Parkway retained its 25 cent toll. The change faced immediate criticism from the New York State Legislature, and the Democratic members tried to rescind the toll hike. The power Robert Moses still had in a deal with the State of New York made sure that only his authority could choose when to raise and rollback tolls. However, the deals never prohibited the state from buying out the bonds the authority had themselves and thus take over the roads maintained by the Jones Beach Parkway Authority. Governor Hugh Carey had yet to craft the $12 billion state budget for 1978, and he proposed a deal to forgo the $24 million (1978 USD) debt that the agency had accumulated and eliminate the toll on the Loop Parkway by taking over the roads.\nAfter the governor and his department decided that the state could do without the $3.8 million (1978 USD) that the toll would produce each year, a bill permitting the state to take over the Loop Parkway was passed on March 31, 1978. The removal of the tolls helped Governor Carey gain enough support to pass that year's state budget. The decision to eliminate the Loop Parkway tolls was influenced by Long Beach Supervisor Hannah Komanoff, who also unsuccessfully fought to have the tollbooth on the Atlantic Beach Bridge removed in 1979.\n\nIn Mario Puzo's 1969 novel, \"The Godfather\", Sonny Corleone was in the process of running to go settle a years-long dispute with Carlo Rizzi when he drove his Buick across Jones Beach from the Wantagh State Parkway (mentioned as the Jones Beach Causeway) towards the \"causeway that would take him over the water from Long Beach\". However, when Corleone approached the toll on the Jones Beach Causeway, the toll-taker fumbled his money and soon two men approached him with guns along with a fake toll-taker from another booth. All three men shot Corleone and flew back via car to the Meadowbrook Parkway and into Long Beach via the Loop Parkway. A common misconception is that the murder occurred on either the Loop or the Meadowbrook parkways; however, the book specifies that the event occurred at the tollbooth on the Wantagh State Parkway.\n\n"}

It is also a transaction services provider. It gives companies and investors access to global capital markets. It is a joint stock company and was founded in 1993. The headquarters are in Frankfurt. As of December 2010, the over 765 companies listed had a combined market capitalization of EUR 1.4 trillion. On 1 October 2014, Deutsche Börse AG became the 14th announced member of the United Nations Sustainable Stock Exchanges initiative.\n\nMore than 3,200 employees service customers in Europe, the United States, and Asia. Deutsche Börse has locations in Germany, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Czech Republic, and Spain, as well as representative offices in Beijing, London, Paris, Chicago, New York, Hong Kong, and Dubai.\n\nFWB Frankfurter Wertpapierbörse (Frankfurt Stock Exchange), is one of the world's largest trading centers for securities. With a share in turnover of around 90%, it is the largest of the German stock exchanges. Deutsche Börse AG operates the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.\n\nDeutsche Börse is the owner of Clearstream, a clearing house based in Luxembourg.\n\nOn 3 May 2000 it was announced that the London Stock Exchange would merge with Deutsche Börse, though the deal fell through before the merger could be realized.\n\nIn 2001, Deutsche Börse tried again to merge with the London Stock Exchange, followed by a takeover bid in late 2004, but both offers rejected by the LSE. After CEO Werner Seifert was forced to resign by the main shareholders in 2005, Deutsche Börse changed plans and entered into advanced negotiations for a merger with Euronext which would have brought two of the biggest stock exchanges in Europe into one holding. The New York Stock Exchange beat out Deutsche Börse's final bid for Euronext in 2006.\n\nSince 2007 Deutsche Börse operates the joint venture Scoach with SIX Swiss Exchange to provide a European derivative trading platform.\n\nIn July 2015, Deutsche Börse bought the 360T company for 725 million euros and also acquired all shares (100%) of the joint venture STOXX AG for a purchase price of CHF 650 million from the SIX Group.\n\nOn 7 December 2008, Deutsche Börse rebuffed rumors that it might join with NYSE Euronext (the company formed as a result of the merger of NYSE and Euronext) to create the world's leading stock exchange. While the company claims that it pursued the matter, on 8 December 2008, it reported that talks which began on 25 November 2008, were closed without any result due to differences in valuation of the company.\n\nDeutsche Börse had also considered the acquisition again in 2009.\n\nOn 9 February 2011, reports suggested that NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse were in advanced talks about an all-stock merger. Deutsche Börse was in advanced talks to buy NYSE Euronext in a deal that would create the world's largest trading powerhouse. The shares of both companies were temporarily frozen on the news due to the risk of large price movements and clarifications of the deal. A successful deal would see the new company becoming the world's largest stock exchange operator with a market capitalisation of listed companies equal to US$15 trillion, US$13.39 trillion of which is part of the much larger NYSE Euronext, which is approximately six times the size of Deutsche Börse.\n\nPresident and deputy CEO of NYSE Euronext Dominique Cerutti would become the new company's president and head of commercial and internal technology. Roland Bellegarde, also of NYSE Euronext, would become the head of European cash equities. The new company would potentially have 300 million euros (US$410 million) in cost savings. However, the merger would be subject to review in both the United States and European Union under concerns it could create a \"de facto monopoly\". NYSE Euronext shareholders approved the Deutsche Börse’s all-stock deal on 7 July 2011, and Deutsche Börse shareholders had accepted the deal by 15 July 2011.\n\nOn 22 December 2011, Deutsche Boerse won U.S. antitrust approval to buy NYSE Euronext, on the condition that a Deutsche Börse subsidiary, the International Securities Exchange, divest its 31.5% interest in Direct Edge. NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse AG delayed the deadline for completing their merger until 31 March 2012, as the exchange operators try to persuade European regulators to approve the deal.\n\nThe European Commission blocked the merger on 1 February 2012, citing the fact that the merged company would have a near monopoly.\nThis measure taken by the EC is the fourth blocking in over a decade.\nThe commission rejected the merger on antitrust grounds, saying the combined businesses would dominate Europe's on-exchange derivatives trading with an estimated 93% market share. \"This is a black day for Europe and its global competitiveness on financial markets\", said former Deutsche Börse chief executive Reto Francioni. NYSE Euronext chairman Jan-Michiel Hessels said: \"While we are disappointed and strongly disagree with the EU decision, which is based on a fundamentally different understanding of the derivatives market, it is now time to move on\".\n\nIn March 2016, the company announced it had reached an agreement with London Stock Exchange Group to merge. The companies will be brought under a new holding company, UK TopCo, and will retain both headquarters in London and Frankfurt. The deal needs approval from regulators in the European Union, the U.S. and Russia. The London Stock Exchange said Russian approval was needed because it owns Exactpro, a firm with offices in Russia specializing in quality assurance for exchanges and financial organizations. The European Commission opened an in-depth investigation into the proposed Deutsche Börse/LSEG merger on 28 September 2016. The European Commission delayed its decision on the deal by 15 working days to 6 March 2017. LSEG plans to hive off the French half of its LCH SA arm in a bid to ease EU concerns about the deal although the companies have not formally submitted any concessions to the Commission.\n\nIn February 2017, the Commission required that the parties commit to the divestment of LSEG's majority stake in fixed-income sovereign bond trading platform MTS S.p.A. LSEG stated it would not sell MTS in Italy to appease anti-trust concerns. The planned merger between the two exchanges, which was estimated to create the largest exchange in Europe, was subsequently described as \"at risk\" by the \"Wall Street Journal\". The merger attempt was blocked by EU Competition Regulator on 29 March 2017 stating that \"The Commission's investigation concluded the merger would have created a de facto monopoly in the markets for clearing fixed income instruments\".\n\nIn October 2017, several shareholders called for the resignation of the chairman.\n\nOn 16 November 2017, Theodor Weimer was appointed as new CEO of Deutsche Börse AG, effective January 2018.\n\nDeutsche Börse Group is a major sponsor of contemporary photography. In 1999, the Group established the Art Collection Deutsche Börse, which today comprises more than 900 mostly large size works from around 90 international artists. In 2005, the stock exchange became the sponsor of the annually awarded Deutsche Börse Photography Prize of the Photographers' Gallery in London, which was started up in 1996 by the gallery, to promote the best work by contemporary photographers.\n\nDeutsche Börse Group have participated in and sponsored many events, including Futures For Kids Annual Football Tournament (held in the Docklands, England).

Pollack (born June 19, 1982) is a former professional American football linebacker who played two seasons in the National Football League (NFL), having suffered a career-ending injury in the second game of his second season. He played college football for the University of Georgia, was a three-time All-American, and was recognized as the top college defensive player in the nation. Pollack had 36 sacks during his collegiate career, third most in NCAA history. He was a first-round pick in the 2005 NFL Draft, and played professionally for the NFL's Cincinnati Bengals.\n\nPollack was born in New Brunswick, New Jersey. He attended Shiloh High School in Snellville, Georgia, and was a star in football, basketball and wrestling. In football, as a senior, he was a Class 5A all-state selection and the Atlanta Touchdown Club named him the Defensive Lineman of the Year.\n\nPollack attended the University of Georgia, where he played for coach Mark Richt's Georgia Bulldogs football team from 2001 to 2004 and was a roommate of future NFL quarterback David Greene.\n\nFor three consecutive seasons, he was recognized as a first-team All-Southeastern Conference (SEC) selection and a first-team All-American (2002, 2003, 2004)—twice as an NCAA consensus first-team honoree, having received the first-team selections of a majority of All-America selector organizations in 2002 and 2004. He is only the second player in Bulldogs team history to earn first-team All-American honors in three seasons, following Heisman Trophy-winner Herschel Walker. In addition to his All-American accolades, Pollack received the following:\n\n\nHis signature play came during the second game of the 2002 season. Pollack batted down a pass from South Carolina quarterback Corey Jenkins in the South Carolina end zone and managed to catch the ball in the end zone before it hit the ground; Pollack was credited with a 0-yard interception return for a touchdown. Pollack finished his college career with 36 sacks, a Georgia career record, and ranks third in NCAA history.\n\nHe graduated from the University of Georgia with a bachelor's degree in history.\n\nIn his rookie season of 2005, Pollack was a reserve until the Bengals' sixth game, when he became a starter at linebacker. He missed two games due to a sprained knee. However, he still ranked second on the team with 4.5 sacks on the season, and posted 22 tackles and six assists for a total of 28.\n\nIn his second NFL season, 2006, he started the Bengals' first game. On September 17, 2006, in game against in-state rival Cleveland Browns, Pollack suffered what was later determined to be a broken sixth cervical vertebrae on a first quarter tackle on running back Reuben Droughns. He reportedly suffered no paralysis, but was taken off the field on a stretcher and underwent surgery to fuse two vertebrae, and was required to wear a halo brace for three months. Pollack's injury was determined to be a possible career-ending one. However, on January 7, 2007, ESPN reported that Pollack would be able to resume his career as long as the rehabilitation process went as planned. On July 11, 2007, it was announced that Pollack would not play at all during the 2007 season as his recovery continued.\n\nOn April 22, 2008, Bengals head coach Marvin Lewis announced that Pollack was \"not completely comfortable where he [was] medically\" and that he would retire.\n\nPollack's new company, FanBan, manufactures sports banners that feature sports photographs and college football team logos.

Seen through the eyes of idealistic scientist Leo Kall, \"Kallocain\" is a depiction of a totalitarian world state. An important aspect of the novel is the relationships and connections between the various characters, such as the marriage of the main character and his wife Linda Kall, and the feelings of jealousy and suspicion that may arise in a society with heavy surveillance and legal uncertainty.\n\nOne of its central ideas coincides with contemporary rumors of truth drugs that ensured the subordination of every citizen to the state. Both Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World\" (1932) and Boye's \"Kallocain\" are drug dystopias, or societies in which pharmacology is used to suppress opposition to authority. However, unlike \"Brave New World\", where a drug is used to suppress the urge to nonconformity generally, in \"Kallocain\" a drug is used to detect individual acts and thoughts of rebellion.\n\n\"Kallocain\" has been translated into more than 10 languages; English language translations include those by Gustaf Lannestock (2002, University of Wisconsin Press) and David McDuff (2019, Penguin Classics). It was adapted into a television miniseries in 1981 by Hans Abramson.\n\nIn 2016, the novel was nominated for the Retro-Hugo award for the best science fiction novel of 1941.\n\nThe plot centers on Leo Kall, written in the form of a diary or memoir. Kall lives with his wife Linda Kall in a city intended for chemical industry. Leo is a scientist, who is initially very loyal to the government and develops the truth drug Kallocain. It has the effect that anyone who takes it will reveal anything, even things of which they were not consciously aware.\n\nMajor themes include the notion of the self in a totalitarian state, the meaning of life, and the power of love. Apart from the laboratory work and testing by Leo Kall, much of the novel takes place in the home of Leo and Linda.\n\n\n"}

Acting Secretary of State Warren Christopher had ordered the interception because Vlasova's husband, Alexander Godunov, who had defected two days earlier, had expressed his belief that his wife was returning to the Soviet Union against her will. Vlasova steadily maintained that she was returning voluntarily, but the U.S. representation was unwilling to accept her statement unless they could speak with her in the absence of Soviet officials. This request was denied.\n\nEventually Soviet officials allowed Vlasova to speak with U.S. representatives in a mobile lounge that was brought up to the plane. She convinced them that she was not returning under coercion, and the plane took off with Vlasova on board.\n\nThe timing of the Vlasova incident drew attention to McHenry at a critical time. Earlier that year, Andrew Young had been made to resign his post as U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. after meeting with a representative of the Palestine Liberation Organization, against U.S. policy, and making controversial remarks on political prisoners in the U.S. In September 1979, McHenry was appointed Ambassador and U.S. Permanent Representative to the U.N. by President Jimmy Carter.\n\nIn 1986 McHenry received a L.H.D. from Bates College. He has served on the board of directors of several multi-national corporations and is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He is currently Professor of Diplomacy and International Affairs at Georgetown University. He has also been a director of The Coca-Cola Company since 1981, as well as a former director of AT&T Corporation and International Paper. McHenry is an Advisory Board member for the Partnership for a Secure America, a not-for-profit organization dedicated to recreating the bipartisan center in American national security and foreign policy.\n\nDonald McHenry is a Member of the Global Leadership Foundation, an organization which works to support democratic leadership, prevent and resolve conflict through mediation and promote good governance in the form of democratic institutions, open markets, human rights and the rule of law.

His father's alcoholism kept the family in difficult financial circumstances, and Lee Shubert went to work selling newspapers on a street corner. With borrowed money, he and younger brothers Sam and Jacob eventually embarked on a business venture that led to them to become the successful operators of several theaters in upstate New York.\n\nThe Shubert brothers decided to expand to the huge market in New York City, and at the end of March 1900 they leased the Herald Square Theatre at the corner of Broadway and 35th Street in Manhattan. Leaving younger brother Jacob at home to manage their existing theatres, Lee and Sam Shubert moved to New York City, where they laid the foundations for what was to become the largest theatre empire in the 20th century, including the Winter Garden and Shubert Theatres.\n\nThe all-powerful Theatrical Syndicate essentially excluded competition. Since the Shuberts were not permitted to use Syndicate-controlled theaters, they put on shows in rented circus tents, holding \"three times as many customers as the typical theater.\" In 1910, they formed the \"Independent National Theatre Owner's Association\", which brought about the defection of many theaters from all around the country that previously had been affiliated with the Syndicate. In 1922, it was announced that \"Lee Shubert and A. L. Erlanger ... rivals for twenty years\" had reached a working understanding.\n\nLee Shubert was a hard nosed businessman who has been criticized for being money and power oriented with little interest in culture. Nonetheless, he recognized the need to attract some of the top stage actors from the long-established European theatres (as Gaby Deslys) to perform at the new Broadway houses. After a disastrous production of \"Hamlet\" in 1901 at a competitor's theatre, French megastar Sarah Bernhardt vowed never to return to America until Lee Shubert convinced her to perform for his company in 1905.\n\nAt his death Lee Shubert's estate was worth $16 million. He boasted in 1924 of his family success:\n\nHe was married to Marcella Swanson. They had previously been secretly married on July 29, 1936 in Germany and divorced in September 1948 in Reno, Nevada. They remarried in Miami in March 1949 (\"Time Magazine\" reports the remarriage was in February).\n\nLee Shubert died in New York City on December 25, 1953 at the age of 82 and was interred in the family plot at Salem Fields Cemetery in Brooklyn.\n\n"}

The contract featured $5.5 million in guaranteed money, not including the signing bonus of $1 million.

He moved from BSC Young Boys to Frank Clark's Nottingham Forest for a £450,000 fee in 1993. He joined Forest at a time when they were struggling in the first division of English Football, and a clause in his contract meant that he could leave at any time if another club matched a £700,000 buyout fee.

His first season was a success as he became a regular in the Blackburn side, scoring four league goals - including a double against his old club as Rovers thrashed Forest 7-0.

His preferred position was left back, which he occupied for domestic clubs and the national team. Bjørnebye was appointed assistant manager of Norway in 2003, relinquishing the role three years later to succeed Tom Nordlie as manager of IK Start. He was the sports director of Rosenborg Ballklub from March 2015 until November 2019.\n\nFor club and country, Bjørnebye was noted for his precise deliveries from the flanks. Described as a \"solid, no-nonsense full-back\", Bjørnebye played competitive football for 16 years, and appeared in 194 Premier League matches, until injury compelled retirement in March 2003. He represented the Norwegian national team in the 1994 and 1998 FIFA World Cup and the Euro 2000 and was capped 75 times, scoring once.\n\nStig Inge Bjørnebye was born in Elverum, the son of skier Jo Inge Bjørnebye, who competed in the 1968 and 1972 Winter Olympics. As a child, Bjørnebye exhibited an interest in emulating his father by becoming a ski jumper.\n\nHis footballing career began as a youth player with home club Elverum IL, before joining Strømmen IF in the late 1980s. He moved to Kongsvinger IL in 1989, establishing himself as a first-team regular in the Norwegian top division. After three seasons with Kongsvinger, he transferred to Rosenborg in 1992, where he in his inaugural season won the Norwegian top division and the Norwegian Cup, in the final of, which he scored the deciding goal against Lillestrøm SK.\n\nHis performances merited inclusion in the national team and attracted the attention of Liverpool's manager Graeme Souness, who bought Bjørnebye for £600,000 less than one year after moving to Rosenborg. Signed as a replacement for David Burrows, Bjørnebye debuted inauspiciously on 19 December 1992 in a 5–1 defeat to Coventry City. Initial difficulties adapting to the Premier League caused many fans to question his displays on the pitch and he returned to Norway on loan to Rosenborg in 1994.\n\nBjørnebye's experiences as a Reds' player in the 1994–95 season under the management of Roy Evans, were markedly more successful than that of previous campaigns. He gained a regular place in the senior team, supplanting the left back position from Julian Dicks, and featured in the 2–1 win against Bolton Wanderers in the final of the 1995 League Cup Final on 2 April 1995. Subsequent injury, a broken leg sustained on 5 April 1995 in a 3–1 win match against Southampton, terminated his season and he was replaced by Steve Harkness.\n\nUnavailable for several months, Bjørnebye appeared just twice for Liverpool in the 1995–96 season. Recovery and injuries to other left back candidates enabled Bjørnebye to reclaim his place the following season, in which he scored his first goal for Liverpool on 17 August 1996 in a 3–3 draw against Middlesbrough. He contributed to the club's most convincing title challenge since the inception of the Premier League by supplying club strikers Stan Collymore and Robbie Fowler with precise crosses. He was ultimately included in the PFA Team of the Year with Steve McManaman and Mark Wright. The acquisition of Steve Staunton and arrival of Gérard Houllier in the 1998–99 season, limited Bjørnebye's first-team opportunities, leading to his effective marginalisation. Bjørnebye affirmed his recurring determination to stay at Liverpool that season, remarking \"If I didn't have any fight in my stomach I'd have left Liverpool at least three times before\".\n\nUnable to displace Staunton and Dominic Matteo, Bjørnebye agreed to a loan move to Danish side Brøndby IF in 2000, who finished second in the Danish Superliga with Bjørnebye on the team. He decided to permanently leave Liverpool after returning from the European Championship, accepting a £300,000 transfer to Blackburn Rovers that reunited him with former manager Graeme Souness. Promotion to the Premier League was achieved in his first year with Rovers, in the process, Bjørnebye scored his only goal for the club on 11 November 2000, in a 2–2 draw against Portsmouth. His final trophy was gained when Blackburn defeated Tottenham Hotspur 2–1 in the 2002 League Cup Final. Successive injuries after the cup victory disrupted and eventually ended his career as a footballer. While preparing for the 2002–03 season, Bjørnebye fractured his eye socket in a training accident. He complained of double vision, underwent surgery, and was rendered unavailable for seven months. Further injury inflicted during a League Cup match on 17 December 2002, in a 2–0 win against Wigan Athletic escalated, while Bjørnebye was recovering in Norway, necessitating emergency surgery to avert the possibility of foot amputation. Bjørnebye announced his retirement on 11 March 2003. Blackburn manager Graeme Souness reacted to the decision with a statement:\n\nBjørnebye was capped 75 times by Norway, scoring once – an olympic goal in a 1–0 friendly against the United States on 8 September 1993. Having represented his country at youth, under-21, and \"B\" level, Bjørnebye debuted for the senior team on 31 May 1989 against Austria. The majority of his caps were collected during Egil Olsen's eight-year tenure as manager of Norway. Under Olsen's guidance, Norway employed a \"long ball\" policy that was contingent on the height of Olsen's squad. The tactic of directing long passes to the tall winger Jostein Flo, principally delivered by Bjørnebye, became popularly referred to in Norway as the \"Flo Pass\" (Flo-pasningen). Although criticised for employing the long-ball approach and maintaining a defensively-orientated mentality, Olsen secured qualification for the World Cups of 1994 and 1998. Bjørnebye participated in both tournaments – seven matches in total.\n\nHe decided to retire from international football after the 1998 World Cup, intending to focus on his domestic career and family. Bjørnebye unexpectedly reversed his decision after Nils Johan Semb persuaded him to return to the squad for Euro 2000. Unused in Norway's 1–0 win against Spain on 13 June 2000, Bjørnebye was first introduced to the competition in the second match of the group stage, in a 0–1 loss on 18 June 2000 against Yugoslavia, as a 35-minute substitute for his Liverpool colleague Vegard Heggem. He retained his place, featuring in the goalless draw against Slovenia on 21 June 2000, which eliminated Norway from the tournament. His final international match was in a 1–1 draw World Cup qualifier on 7 October 2000 against Wales, placing him ninth in the overall record of appearances for Norway as of 2007.\n\nBjørnebye returned to football in a non-playing capacity when he was selected by the Norwegian Football Association to replace Harald Aabrekk as Norway's assistant manager, subordinate to the newly appointed Åge Hareide. Prior to the announcement, the media in England had reported that Bjørnebye was considering maintaining a relationship with Blackburn by becoming a scout for the club. He vacated his position in 2006 to succeed Tom Nordlie as manager of IK Start. Success was forthcoming in his first season; the club competed in Europe and Bjørnebye was the highest earning coach of the season, ahead of his predecessor Nordlie, with an income of almost seven million krone. His appointment lasted two seasons, ending with dismissal in September 2007, after a series of poor results that placed the club in serious danger of being relegated from the Tippeligaen. He was replaced by Benny Lennartsson, who was unable to preserve the club's premier league status; Start were relegated to Norway's second tier.\n\nOn 15 March 2015, Stig Inge Bjørnebye succeeded Erik Hoftun as the sports director of Eliteserien club, Rosenborg Ballklub. He since has won The Double with Rosenborg Ballklub two years in a row, in 2015 and 2016. Rosenborg Ballklub is the first club in the history of Norwegian football to do so two years in a row. As the sports director of Rosenborg Ballklub he has many responsibilities, among many others signing on new players and renewing contracts with existing players. The most notable signing came on 6 March 2017: Nicklas Bendtner signed on for a 3-year contract with the Norwegian side. This was the most surprising and most notable signing in the history of Norwegian football. Teammate and Eliteserien superstar, Pål André Helland, had this to say about the signing: \"It shouldn't come as a surprise if he becomes the top scorer and we win the league.\"\n\nBjørnebye is married to the former Byåsen IL handball player Hege Frøseth, with whom he has three children.\n\nRosenborg\n\nLiverpool\n\nBlackburn Rovers\n\n"}

He also intercepted 11 passes and broke up another 38 in his three-year career, placing him fourth in Nebraska history in both categories. Fabian was known for starting every game at left cornerback for the Huskers as a junior in 2004. Fabian was also named second-team All-Big 12 by the Austin American-Statesman and earned third-team honors from the league's coaches. Fabian recorded three interceptions, gaining 23 yards in returns, and broke up 15 passes. He also recorded 41 tackles (27 solos), including three tackles behind the line for minus-seven yards. Fabian was selected in third-team All-Big 12 by the league's coaches as a sophomore in 2003. He intercepted four passes, which he returned for 14 yards, and batted down 10 others...Registered a career-high 55 tackles (36 solos), had three tackles behind the line for minus-six yards, forced a fumble and recovered another, and recorded two QB pressures. As a freshman, he was selected Freshman All-American second-team and first-team All-Big 12 selection by The Sporting News in 2002. He set a Nebraska freshman record with 13 pass deflections and tied another freshman mark with four interceptions. Fabian intercepted a pass on his first play as a Husker against Arizona State and returned it 29 yards for a touchdown. He finished the year with 49 tackles (34 solos), two forced fumbles, a fumble recovery, and one tackle for a two-yard loss. Fabian majored in sociology.\n\nWashington was drafted by the Oakland Raiders with the 23rd overall pick in the 2005 NFL Draft after his draft stock rose after recording a time of 4.29 sec in the 40-yard dash at the 2005 NFL Combine.\n\nDuring his rookie year he played all 16 games with 11 starts and recorded 40 tackles.

His mother and father were Charles and Mary Whatcoat. He considered himself fortunate to be in Church of England parish where the Minister, the Reverend Samuel Taylor, was \"a converted man\". He believed his mother to be converted. His father died when he was young leaving his wife with two sons and three daughters. When he was thirteen Whatcoat was apprenticed to Mr Joseph Jones who lived in Birmingham, shortly after moving to Darlaston in Staffordshire.\n\nAfter completing his apprenticeship at the age of twenty-one, in 1757, he moved to nearby Wednesbury. There he began attending Methodist meetings and was challenged by their preaching which he described as \"light and power to my soul\". On the third of September 1758 he underwent a classic Evangelical conversion. He was reading his Bible when he came across verse 16 in Romans chapter eight\"The Spirit itself beareth witness with our Spirit, that we are children of God\". Whatcoat claimed that in that moment \"my darkness was removed, and the Spirit did bear witness with my Spirit, that I was a child of God. In the same instant I was filled with unspeakable peace and joy in believing: all fear of death, judgement, and hell, suddenly vanished.\"\n\nWhatcoat's spiritual journey continued and on the 28 March 1761 he understood that Grace was a free gift of God \"my soul was drawn out and engaged in a manner it never was before. Suddenly I was stripped of all but love\". He then spent the rest of his time in Wednesbury serving as a band leader, class leader and society steward amongst the growing Methodist community in the town.\n\nMethodism in Wednesbury at that time was recovering from the severe persecutions during the 1743 and 1744 anti-Methodist riots. Serious incidents continued across the West Midlands well into the 1760s. The Methodist community which met at Wednesbury included the young Francis Asbury, with whom Whatcoat developed a lifelong friendship, and William Legge the 2nd Earl of Dartmouth.\n\nWhatcoat wanted to develop his ministry and resolved to go full-time in 1769. John Pawson proposed him at that year's Methodist Conference and he was accepted as a probationer, initially stationed at Oxford. His subsequent stations were:\n1770 Bedford, England; 1771 Inniskillen, Ireland; 1772 Armah, Ireland (during much of this stationing he was seriously ill); 1773 Pembrook, Wales; 1774 Brecknock, Wales; 1776 Launceston, Cornwall, England; 1777 St. Austle, Cornwall, England; 1778 Salisbury, Wiltshire, England; 1780 Northampton, England; 1781 Canterbury, Kent, England; 1782 Lynn, Norfolk, England; 1783 Norwich, Norfolk, England.\n\nMethodism was originally conceived as a society within the Church of England, not a separate denomination. During the War of Independence the Church of England in the United States collapsed as most of the clergy left. This denied Methodist societies access to the sacraments of baptism and holy communion. In 1784 John Wesley remedied the situation by himself ordaining Francis Asbury in absentia and Thomas Coke, appointing them joint superintendents of the work in the new United States. Coke, Thomas Vasey and Whatcoat, who had been appointed a deacon, set out to America to consecrate Asbury at Baltimore on Christmas Day of that year Three years later Coke and Asbury assumed the title \"Bishop\", which did not please John Wesley.\n\nCoke, Vasey and Whatcoat set out for New York from Bristol on the 28th September 1784. The ship was called the \"Four Friends\" and during the first four days they were sea sick. They soon settled into a routine of prayers each morning and evening, with two preaching services on Sundays. They spent the evening reading up on the lives of preachers, saints, and divinity. At one point a fifteen-foot whale accompanied the ship, on another occasion they caught and ate a dolphin. The wind was against them and the journey was difficult with two nights of thunder and lightning. The arrived in New York six weeks and thousand miles later on 3 November 1784.\n\nWhatcoat threw himself wholeheartedly into the itinerant Methodist ministry across the thirteen states. He accompanied Francis Asbury on long missionary journeys taking him too many parts of the new country. Frequently they were in danger from Native Americans. Him and Asbury would often share the preaching, with one speaking in the morning, and the other, in the afternoon. He did not keep a journal as Asbury had done but Asbury mentions Whatcoat on many occasions. His short auto-biography, published after his death records many long journeys and preaching engagements.\n\nAt the Annual Methodist Conference held in Baltimore, Maryland in May 1800, Whatcoat was elected the third Bishop of the new church. \"We had a most blessed time\", he recalled, \"and much preaching and fervent prayers, and strong exhortation through the city, while the high praises of a gracious God reverberated from street to street, house to house, which greatly alarmed the citizens. It was thought that not less than two hundred were converted during the sitting of the conference.\"\n\nDuring the last few years of his ministry Whatcoat continued to travel and preach even though he was often unwell, by then he was in his late sixties. In July 1805 he wrote \"Notwithstanding my infirm state of body, through the blessing of God. I have been able to travel three thousand four hundred and sixteen miles the last twelve month...I have great reason to bless God, who has preserved me these many years as an itinerant preacher, during which he have delivered me from many afflictions of body and mind\"\n\nBy the time of his death in 1806 he had been in itinerant ministry for 37 years, 22 of them in the United States. He never returned to England and never married.\n\n\n"}

The sound is made by rubbing one end of one or more of the glass tubes, or also by striking them or rubbing them with a special mallet. The tubes are close together so that chords can be played by rubbing more than one at the same time. The instrument carries more acoustical volume than the glass harmonica and some other glass instruments and generally has a range from G3 to F6 (which can be extended in the higher register with wine glasses, giving it a range up to D7). Every piece composed originally for glass harmonica can be played on the verrophone.\n\nThe term \"verrophone\" originally referred to a glass harp. Previous glass instruments include the glass harmonica and arrangements of ordinary drinking glasses (approximately glass tubes closed at one end). The verrophone is capable of louder dynamics than the glass harp due to its larger radiating surfaces.\n\nModern artists such as Barry Prophet of the Music Gallery have produced glass instruments that work similarly to a glockenspiel or lithophone, i.e. by striking various glass tubes. An example can be heard in a work entitled \"Crystal Bones\" composed and played on Prophet's microtonally tuned glass instruments.\n\n\n"}

Pope Pius XII explicitly ordered this union to be regulated by a \"Lex Propria\", which was later revised after the Second Vatican Council.\n\nMost Benedictine \"houses\" are loosely affiliated in 20 national or supra-national congregations. Each of these congregations elects its own Abbot President. These presidents meet annually in the Synod of Presidents. Additionally, there is a meeting every four years of the Congress of Abbots, which is made up of all abbots and conventual priors, both of monasteries that are members of congregations, as well as of those unaffiliated with any particular congregation. The Congress of Abbots elects the Abbot Primate, who serves a four-year term as the Confederation's representative and administrative head, although without direct jurisdiction over the individual Congregations.\n\nThe Confederation has its headquarters at Sant'Anselmo in Rome, which is the seat of the Abbot Primate and hosts the quadrennial Congress of Abbots. Sant'Anselmo is also home to the Benedictine Pontifical Athenaeum.\n\nCommunities of Benedictine nuns and Religious Sisters are joined in 61 congregations and federations that are associated with the Confederation, although they do not have full membership. In November 2001 after a consultation process with all monasteries of Benedictine women around the world, it was decided to use the name Communio Internationalis Benedictinarum (CIB) to designate all communities of Benedictine women recognized by the Abbot Primate as such and listed in the \"Catalogus Monasteriorum O.S.B\".\n\nThe first attempt to group Benedictine monasteries into national Congregations was at the Fourth Lateran Council in 1215. Only the English Benedictine Congregation survives from this early attempt at centralisation, and in historical reality even this Congregation is a 17th-century foundation although it was given juridical continuity with the medieval English Congregation by the Papal Bull \"Plantata\" of 1633. Primacy of honour is given to the Subiaco Cassinese Congregation, since this Congregation includes the Abbey of Monte Cassino, where St Benedict wrote his Rule and was buried (although Fleury Abbey also claims to house the remains of the founder). Founded in 1872, the Congregation has its origin in the Congregation of the Abbey of Santa Giustina, founded in Padua in 1408 by Dom Ludovico Barbo.\n\nThe Benedictines suffered badly in the anti-clerical atmosphere at the time of Napoleon and the modern Congregations were mostly founded in the 19th century when monasticism was revived. The majority are essentially national groupings, although the Subiaco Congregation (originally the Cassinese Congregation of the Primitive Observance) has from the first been truly international because of its interest in foreign mission.\n\nSince the time of the Reformation, there have been independent Benedictine communities in the Protestant (especially Anglican) traditions which maintain official friendly relations with the Benedictine Confederation, although they are not formally linked with it or its congregations.\n\nThroughout the Benedictine confederation and its subdivisions, independence and autonomy among communities are uniquely valued; too highly for Pope Pius XI, who complained that the largely nominal confederation was \"an order without order\". The basic unit has always been the individual abbey, rather than the Congregation. This explains why some houses (e.g. Monte Cassino, Subiaco, Saint Paul-outside-the-Walls (Rome), Montserrat and Pannonhalma) have unbroken histories of more than a thousand years while the Congregations to which they belong are more recent.\n\nThis balance between autonomy and belonging is one of the distinguishing features of the Benedictine Confederation, and brings with it both strengths and weaknesses. One immediate consequence is that there is often great diversity of observance even between houses of the same Congregation: in liturgy, timetable, pastoral involvement and habit.\n\nThe present Confederation of Congregations of Monasteries of the Order of Saint Benedict, officially, the \"Benedictine Confederation\", of monks, consists of the following congregations in the order given in the \"Catalogus Monasteriorum OSB\" (dates in brackets are those of the foundation of the congregations – Primacy of honour is given to the Cassinese Congregation, though the English Congregation is the oldest, because Monte Cassino was the original Abbey of St. Benedict himself. (The older Camaldolese and Sylvestrine congregations joined the Confederation only in the mid-20th century.):\n\n\n\n"}

His father was an amateur artist and art dealer, whose other business dealings (as a banker, goldsmith, and diamond merchant) afforded young Seymour the leisure time to study art on his own, either his father's or the art at the Virtuosi Club of St. Luke - a gentleman's club his father belonged to, specializing in art. In a short time the boy was a self-taught artist, familiar with many of the prominent artists of the period. \n\nSeymour's love of art was matched only by his love of horses. He began spending time at racetracks early on, and before long found himself absorbed in the sport - drawing, painting, owning, breeding, and racing horses. His art proved popular among the prominent sporting families of the day, eventually garnering Seymour patrons in Sir William Jolliffe and Charles Seymour, 6th Duke of Somerset. Jolliffe's love for horses and art proved great, and his will would later establish an equestrian statue in Hampshire. In time, Seymour's work and fame had spread throughout Europe and America. \n\nThough ultimately his love for horseracing led to his financial ruin, Seymour still ranks among the most important early sporting artists, together with John Wootton and Peter Tillemans being considered one of the three founders of the sporting school.\n\n"}

According to the Public Broadcasting Service his mid-1960s \"Issues in Science and Religion\" \"has been credited with literally creating the contemporary field of science and religion.\"\n\nIn the citation nominating Barbour for the 1999 Templeton Prize, John B. Cobb wrote, \"No contemporary has made a more original, deep and lasting contribution toward the needed integration of scientific and religious knowledge and values than Ian Barbour. With respect to the breadth of topics and fields brought into this integration, Barbour has no equal.\"\n\nBarbour was born in Beijing, China the second of three sons of an American Episcopalian mother and a Scottish Presbyterian father. He spent his childhood in China, the United States, and England.\n\nHe received his B.Sc. in physics from Swarthmore College, his M.Sc. in physics from Duke University in 1946, and a Ph.D. in physics from the University of Chicago in 1950.\n\nHe earned a B.Div. in 1956 from Yale University's Divinity School. Barbour taught at Carleton College beginning in 1955, with an appointment as professor of religion. In the 1970s, he co-founded of the Science, Technology, and Public Policy program at Carleton, which later became the Environment and Technology Studies program. He retired in 1986 as the Winifred and Atherton Bean Professor Emeritus of Science, Technology and Society.\n\nBarbour gave the Gifford lectures from 1989 – 1991 at the University of Aberdeen. These lectures led to the book \"Religion in an Age of Science\". He was awarded the Templeton Prize in 1999 for Progress in Religion in recognition of his efforts to create a dialogue between the worlds of science and religion.\n\nBarbour was married to Deane Kern from 1947 until her death in 2011. They had four children.\n\nBarbour suffered a stroke on December 20, 2013 at his home in Northfield, Minnesota, and remained in a coma at Abbott Northwestern Hospital until his death four days later.\n\nIn his efforts to link science and religion in \"Issues in Science and Religion\", Barbour coined the term 'critical realism'. This has been adopted by other scholars. He claimed the basic structure of religion is similar to that of science in some ways but also differs on some crucial points. They are part of the same spectrum in which both display subjective as well as objective features. The subjective include the theory on data, the resistance of comprehensive theories to falsification, and the absence of rules for choice among paradigms. Objective features include the presence of common data, evidence for or against a theory, and criteria which are not paradigm-dependent. The presence of subjective and objective features in both science and religion makes his thinking valuable and original. Barbour's arguments have been developed in significant and diverse ways by a variety of scholars, including Arthur Peacocke, John Polkinghorne, Sallie McFague and Robert John Russell. His subjective / objective approach is prominent in the evolving paradigm of Religious Naturalism.\n\nBarbour considered critical realism an alternative to the competing interpretations of scientific theories: classical or naive realism, instrumentalism, and idealism. A critical realist perspective sees scientific theories yielding partial, revisable, abstract, but referential knowledge of the world that can be expressed through metaphors and models.\n\nDuring the 1970s Barbour presented a program of interdisciplinary courses that dealt with ethical issues in the applications of science, exploring the social and environmental consequences of a variety of technologies. In 2000 in \"When Science Meets Religion\" (2000) he used a fourfold typology (Conflict, Independence, Dialogue, Integration) to relate religion and science that he had developed in his earlier writings. In his works, Barbour writes from a Christian perspective.\n\nBarbour compared methods of inquiry in science and religion, and has explored the theological implications of Quantum gravity, Big Bang theory, Nebular hypothesis, geological time scale, abiogenesis, evolutionary history of life and evolutionary psychology. He also has lectured widely on ethical issues in such fields as climate change, technology policy, energy, agriculture, computers and cloning.\n\nForrest Clingerman ties Barbour to the Religious Naturalism movement via his theology of nature. His subjective/objective approach to religious is prominent in this evolving paradigm. Michael Dowd calls Barbour the granddaddy of the evolutionary Christianity movement.\n\nIn his acceptance speech for the 1999 Templeton Prize, Barbour spoke about the need to break down barriers, using cloning as an example of science's ability to say what is possible and of religion to reflect on what is desirable.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The opera is loosely based on actual events in the life of runaway slave Margaret Garner. A co-commission by the Michigan Opera Theatre, Cincinnati Opera and Opera Philadelphia, it premièred on 7 May 2005 at the Detroit Opera House in Detroit, Michigan with Denyce Graves in the title role.\n\nMorrison previously used the historic Margaret Garner as the inspiration for her novel \"Beloved\". This is one of a few operas written about the African-American experience; other notable examples are George Gershwin's \"Porgy and Bess\" (1935) and Scott Joplin's \"Treemonisha\" (1910/1972).\n\nThe opera explores themes of freedom and personal and community relationships, and makes some use of the African-American musical tradition of spirituals. It was the first libretto for the author and the first opera for the composer. Danielpour began work on the opera in 1998. The opera premièred on May 7, 2005 in Detroit; it was performed in Cincinnati in July 2005, and Philadelphia in February 2006. The three companies spent more than $2 million on the opera. Denyce Graves sang the title role in the premiere run, which featured a cast of nearly one hundred, flaming torches, a hanging on stage, and black-powder pistols. The opera requires a large cast because of the requirement for separate African and Caucasian choruses to portray the slaves and slave-owners. Other members of the initial cast were Angela M. Brown as Cilla, Gregg Baker as Robert Garner, Rod Gilfry as Edward Gaines, Roger Honeywell as the Auctioneer and John Mac Master as Casey. Kenny Leon directed. Jessye Norman was originally cast as Cilla but withdrew and was replaced by Brown.\n\nThe opera has also been staged by Opera Carolina in Charlotte, North Carolina in 2006, the New York City Opera in 2007 and in Detroit and Chicago in 2008. National Public Radio broadcast the Opera Carolina production.\n\nThe plot follows the slave Margaret Garner as a new master comes to Maplewood, the Kentucky plantation where she is held. Margaret catches her new owner's eye and is brought in to work in the \"big house\", while her husband Robert is rented out to another farm. While the widowed plantation owner, Edward Gaines, sees Margaret as a sexual object, his daughter Caroline comes to see Margaret as a sort of foster mother. At Caroline's engagement party, a rift develops between Gaines and his daughter over her respect for Margaret.\n\nRobert returns to escape with Margaret and his children; his mother Cilla refuses to go, claiming to be too old to learn the new habits of freedom. While they prepare to escape, the overseer Casey finds them and, after a struggle, Robert kills him. The couple and their two children flee, but are later found by Gaines and a posse. After a gun fight, Robert is captured and lynched. Margaret kills her two children to prevent them being returned to slavery, but she is taken alive.\n\nGaines forces a criminal trial where Margaret is charged with \"destruction of property\" for the killing of his slaves, her children. Caroline appeals to Gaines to advance the abolitionist agenda by having Margaret tried for murder instead, acknowledging the slaves' humanity. He refuses. After the guilty verdict and sentence of execution, Gaines fears losing Caroline. Believing he acted as a \"proper\" gentleman, he obtains a commutation for Margaret if she admits her guilt. Ignoring him, Margaret steps voluntarily off the gallows.\n\nThe opera does not intend to be accurate to history.

One of his teammates for the event, Johnny Dumfries set the fastest lap of the race prior to handing the car over to Ganassi upon whom the gearbox broke.\n\n1988-89 - Purchased an interest in Patrick Racing in 1988 – a team he had raced with before in 1983 and 1984 – the team saw Emerson Fittipaldi win the 1989 Indianapolis 500 and CART PPG Indy Car World Series.\n\n1990 - Formed his own CART team, Chip Ganassi Racing (CGR) with Target as the primary sponsor and with Eddie Cheever behind the wheel.\n\n1994 – Wins team's first race with Michael Andretti behind the wheel in Australia.\n\n1996 - Hired two new drivers, a young promising American driver, Jimmy Vasser and relatively unknown Italian, Alessandro Zanardi.[3] Vasser would go on to win Ganassi's first title after winning four of the Opening six races of the 1996 PPG Indy Car World Series season,\n\n1997-98 – Zanardi brings home Ganassi's second and third consecutive championships.\n\n1999 - Juan Pablo Montoya, who won in only his third CART start, would add six more victories as he claimed the 1999 CART title, CGR's fourth consecutive championship.[3][4]\n\n2000 - Montoya wins the team's first Indianapolis 500, and Ganassi's second as team owner.[3]\n\n2001 – Ganassi launched his first NASCAR team with partner Felix Sabates and Sterling Marlin drove his Dodge Intrepid to victory lane at Michigan and Charlotte, then led the championship for most in 2002 before suffering a season-ending injury.\n\n2003 – Wins IndyCar Series with a young Kiwi Scott Dixon, after he scored three wins.\n\n2004 - Ganassi and Sabates entered Rolex Sports Car Series with a Daytona Prototype for Scott Pruett and Max Papis, who stormed to the title.\n\n2006 – Ganassi wins the first of his record six Rolex 24 at Daytonas with drivers Dan Wheldon, Scott Dixon and Casey Mears. Defending IndyCar Series champion, Dan Wheldon joins Dixon on the team. By mid-season, Ganassi pulled another shocker, he announced the return of Montoya, to spearhead the NASCAR program beginning in 2007.\n\n2007 - Montoya joined Pruett and Salvador Durán to retain the Rolex 24 at Daytona crown, and won his first NASCAR event in the XFINITY race in Mexico City.[3]\n\n2008 - Hired 2007 IndyCar champion, Dario Franchitti for the ’08 campaign, however, the Scotsman was signed to join Montoya in NASCAR. Franchitti would form part of CGR’s third Rolex 24 at Daytona win, alongside Pruett, Montoya and Memo Rojas,\n\n2009 – Franchitti switched back to the IndyCar Series for ’09, leading the team to a one-two finish in the end of year standings, after he and Dixon took five wins apiece.\n\n2010 - McMurray wins the Daytona 500 and a few months later, Franchitti wins the Indianapolis 500, making Ganassi the first owner to win both races in the same year and joining Roger Penske as the only owners to win both races. McMurray would go on to win the Brickyard 400, making Ganassi the first owner to win the \"Triple Crown\" of American auto racing. Pruett and Rojas reeled off nine wins in a dozen starts in Grand-Am, and claimed a fourth title. The Ganassi organization scored another “double\" when McMurray won at Charlotte just hours before Franchitti's victory in the IndyCar finale at Homestead to clinch the team's eighth indyCar Series title. It was Ganassi's most successful season, with two titles, victories in Daytona and Indianapolis, and a total of 19 wins across IndyCar, NASCAR and sport cars.\n\n2011 - Rolex Sports Car Series team won the fourth 24 Hours at Daytona, making Ganassi the first owner ever to win the Daytona 500, the Indy 500, the Brickyard 400, and the 24 Hours at Daytona inside a 12 months period. Ganassi becomes the first owner to hold all four titles at one time. By the end of the year, CGR had retained both the IndyCar Series and Grand-Am titles.\n\n2012 - Pruett and Rojas scored their third-straight Grand-Am title (CGR's sixth overall), while Franchitti added another Indy 500 title. 2012 also saw Chip being named by Complex Magazine as one of the “50 most influential people in the Auto Industry”.\n\n2013 - Would see the team's fifth Rolex 24 win. Dixon would go on to win his third title. Kyle Larson wins the NASCAR XFINITY Series Rookie of the Year.\n\n2014 – Promotes Larson to the No. 42 Target Chevrolet. Ganassi also wins the 12 Hours of Sebring in his first attempt. He was awarded the inaugural Cameron R. Argetsinger Award for his contributions to motorsports by the NASCAR, International Speedway Corporation and Watkins Glen International.[3][14][15]\n\n2015 – McMurray, Larson, Tony Kanaan and Dixon win the team's sixth Rolex 24 at Daytona. Dixon wins his fourth IndyCar Series Championship.[16]\n\nGanassi was formerly a vice president of FRG Group, his father's organization involved in commercial real estate, transportation and other areas. In addition to his racing interests, he is also a former minority owner of the Pittsburgh Pirates major league baseball team. Ganassi is a strong supporter of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, to which his teams have donated over US$500,000.\n\nHe graduated with a degree in finance from Duquesne University in 1982. He received an Honorary Doctorate from Carnegie Mellon University in 2011.\n\nHe currently resides in the Pittsburgh suburb of Fox Chapel, Pennsylvania.\n\nHe was inducted into the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 2016.\n\n"}

It was converted in 1916 to gauge, and again to its present gauge in 1986. Originally built to carry building materials, the railway has carried holidaymakers for over a hundred years. At its peak in the 1970s it was carrying in excess of 70,000 passengers a year.\n\nFollowing the construction of the Cambrian Coast Line in 1865 and the completion of the Barmouth Bridge in 1867 there were lavish schemes to develop the area for tourism, the area being easily accessible to day-trippers and weekend visitors from the Midlands.\n\nThere were several horse-drawn construction tramways in the area serving the Henddol Quarry above the neighbouring village of Friog. The tramway that was used to construct the Fairbourne village soon introduced passenger cars to transport people to the ferry station.\n\nThe line was converted to a gauge steam railway in 1916 by Wenman Joseph Bassett-Lowke of Narrow Gauge Railways Ltd (NGR). They were keen to promote tourism in the area after the failure of the Arthog scheme in the early 1900s. The railway played an important part in the development of the gauge railways in the UK. Services were operated by Bassett-Lowke Class 10 locomotive \"Prince Edward of Wales\" designed by Henry Greenly and passengers were conveyed in four open top carriages.\n\nThe railway had mixed fortunes during the inter war years and went through a series of changes in ownership. At one time it was leased to the ferrymen. The railway experienced motive power problems and at one stage experimented with dual gauge track after purchasing an gauge locomotive. This was a model of a GNR Stirling 4-2-2. A third rail was laid as far as the Golf Course.\n\nThe line closed in 1940 after operating its final year with \"Whippit Quick\", a Lister 'Railtruck' petrol locomotive, as the steam locomotive \"Count Louis\" was out of service.\n\nThe railway was rescued by a consortium of businessmen from the Midlands in 1946 and after rebuilding, was reopened by 1947. The line's owner John Charles Wilkins (of Wilkins & Mitchell, Darlaston), funded the redevelopment of the railway and the purchase of new steam locomotives. The line's heyday was in the 1960s and early 1970s but the advent of mass foreign holidays meant there was a steady decline in passenger numbers during the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nThe line was sold again in 1984 to the Ellerton family and underwent dramatic changes to the infrastructure which included construction of a new station at Fairbourne and the re-gauging to 12¼ inches in 1986. Four new steam locomotives were introduced and most of the gauge locomotives left the site. Two of the new locomotives had run on the Réseau Guerlédan Chemin de Fer Touristique in Brittany, France in 1978. All four steam locomotives are half sized replicas of narrow gauge engines: \"Yeo\", \"Sherpa\", \"Beddgelert\" and \"Russell\". Of the extant gauge locomotives only \"Sylvia\" (rebuilt as Lilian Walter) remained. Most of the gauge locomotives are still intact and have found homes on lines around the world.\n\nIn 1990 the railway built their first steam locomotive, Number 24, a replica of a locomotive from the Sandy River & Rangeley Lakes Railroad in Maine. The locomotive has since left the line and now operates on the Cleethorpes Coast Light Railway in Lincolnshire.\n\nThe railway was again put up for sale in 1990 and the line's fortunes appeared to be declining once more. During the five years it was up for sale the railway deteriorated dramatically.\n\nProfessor Tony Atkinson and Dr Roger Melton bought the line in April 1995, they and their wives Mrs Maureen Atkinson and Mrs Amanda Melton being appointed directors. There was considerable investment in the railway to improve reliability of the locomotives and the quality of the track, and a new attraction, the Rowen Centre, was set up at Fairbourne station. In 2007 some of the displays were changed to accommodate a large G scale model railway which is gradually being added to and improved by local model engineers.\n\nIn 2008 ownership of the railway was transferred to a charity, the North Wales Coast Light Railway Limited (Registered number 1127261). Professor Atkinson subsidised the railway's operation but the subsidy was withdrawn after he died on 19 June 2011, leaving the railway's future in doubt. With reductions in staff and by the encouragement of donations the railway has been able to continue in operation.\n\nLike most heritage railways, the Fairbourne Railway has an active volunteer society: Fairbourne Railway Preservation Society (formerly the Fairbourne Railway Supporter's Association). The society is actively involved with the running of services and maintaining the locomotives, rolling stock, stations and track work.\n\nFor hundreds of years the ferry has been providing a crossing service over the Mawddach estuary and was originally operated by monks. In recent years it has been operated by independent operators. During the summer of 2007 the Railway Company acquired a ferry boat and commenced operating its own ferry service in July 2007. The new ferry boat \"Y Chuff\" was bought to ensure that a reliable service across the harbour to Barmouth would operate even during quiet periods of the season.\n\nSteam Locomotives haul most of the passenger services, some of the locomotives are approximately half-size replicas of famous narrow gauge prototype locomotives such as the Class B Tanks from the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway and the Manning Wardle Tanks of the Lynton and Barnstaple Railway.\n\nBooks\n\nMagazines\n\n\nMultimedia\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1882116", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1882116", "title": "Diplock court", "text": "Diplock court\n\nDiplock courts were criminal courts in Northern Ireland for non-jury trial of specified serious crimes (\"scheduled offences\"). They were introduced by the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1973, used for political and terrorism-related cases during the Troubles, and abolished by the Justice and Security (Northern Ireland) Act 2007. Non-jury trial remains possible in Northern Ireland on a case-by-case certification rather than automatically applying for scheduled offences.\n\nTechnically, the Diplock court was not a specially constituted court, but rather an ordinary criminal court before a single judge. From 1991 the relevant court was the Crown Court; before that it was the Belfast City Commission (alternatively the Belfast Recorder's Court until that was abolished in 1975). A Diplock Crown Court usually sits in Belfast but the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland may direct a particular case, or class of cases, or part of a case, to be heard elsewhere.\n\nThe list of scheduled offences required to be tried by Diplock court included:\n\nFor some scheduled offences, the Attorney General for Northern Ireland could specify a jury trial of a particular case, so that for example a non-political murder would not use the Diplock courts.\n\nThe courts were established in response to a report submitted to the UK Parliament in December 1972 by Lord Diplock, which addressed the problem of dealing with physical force Irish republicanism through means other than internment (which had been implemented in August 1971). In his report, Diplock cited two primary reasons for his determination that jury trials should be suspended\n\nLord Gardiner's \"Minority Report\" as part of the \"Parker Report\" in March 1972 found \"no evidence of [intimidation] or of perversity in juries\". The report marked the beginning of the policy of \"criminalisation\", whereby the State removed legal distinctions between political violence and normal crime, with political prisoners treated as common criminals. The report provided the basis for the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1973, which, although later amended (with the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1974 and subsequent renewals), continued as the basis for counter-terrorist legislation in the UK.\n\nTwo years later, Lord Gardiner's review of the removal of trial by jury included attempts to bolster Diplock's findings as follows:\nWe are convinced on the evidence that we have received, that if juries were to be reintroduced for scheduled offences, their verdicts would still be subject to the influences of intimidation, or the fear of it. We have no evidence of this or of perversity in juries...\n\nThe establishment of the Diplock Courts can be seen as an early, and successful, example of the Provisional Irish Republican Army's (PIRA's) long-term aim of making \"the Six Counties... ungovernable except by colonial military rule\". This was a central pillar of the \"Long War\" strategy set out in the 1977 \"Green Book\": \"while PIRA claimed its armed struggle sought to end British 'colonial' rule, its leadership realised that Catholic perception of British 'colonialism', and the subsequent disillusionment caused by this, was of great value in persuading the Catholic community to embrace the Republican cause.\"\n\nDiplock courts mainly tried republican or loyalist paramilitaries. In the first case in which a person not associated with the Troubles was tried and convicted, Abbas Boutrab, a suspected al-Qaeda sympathiser, was found guilty of having information that could assist bombing an airliner. A sentence of six years was handed down on 20 December 2005.\n\nThe number of cases heard in Diplock courts reached a peak of 329 yearly in the mid-1980s. With the Northern Ireland peace process and paramilitary ceasefires of the latter 1990s, that figure fell to 60 a year in the mid-2000s. The 1998 Good Friday Agreement underpinning the peace process included a British commitment to \"security normalisation\" including abolition of Diplock courts. Sinn Féin pressed for this in the agreement negotiations, arguing that lack of juries denied accused republicans of the right to a fair trial. On 1 August 2005, the Northern Ireland Office announced that the Diplock courts were to be phased out, and in August 2006 they announced that the courts were to be abolished effective July 2007. This was achieved under the Justice and Security (Northern Ireland) Act 2007.\n\nThe Criminal Justice Act 2003, applicable throughout the UK, allows jury-less trials in complex fraud cases (s.43) and where there is a risk of jury tampering (s.44).\n\nThe Justice and Security (Northern Ireland) Act 2007 abolished the idea of \"scheduled offences\" automatically tried without a jury. Instead it allows for the Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland to certify a non-jury trial for any indictable offence provided it was committed either from a motive of \"religious or political hostility\" or by on behalf of a group which is both proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000 and \"connected with the affairs of Northern Ireland\". The act seeks to address the concerns which led to the establishment of Diplock courts by enhancing jurors' anonymity to prevent intimidation, and increasing randomised juror selection to prevent bias.\n\nThe Northern Ireland Office's explanatory notes for the 2007 act characterise its changes as \"repeal\" of \"the Diplock system\" and its replacement with \"a new system of non-jury trial\". On the other hand, courts in such trials have much the same format as the pre-2007 Diplock courts, and have been called \"Diplock courts\" in the media.\n\n\n"}

It was shot at their August 27, 1972 concert at the Old Renaissance Faire Grounds in Veneta, Oregon. Unreleased for many years, the movie was sometimes shown at small film festivals, and bootleg recordings of it circulated on VHS and DVD, and as digital downloads. A digitally remastered and reedited official version of the film was released on August 1, 2013, showing only one time in selected theaters as that year's edition of the Grateful Dead Meet-Up at the Movies. It was screened with \"Grateful Days\", a new documentary short that includes interviews with some of the concert attendees. \"Sunshine Daydream\" was released on DVD and Blu-ray on September 17, 2013.\n\nSunshine Daydream is also a live album containing the complete August 27, 1972 Grateful Dead concert. Produced as a 3-disc CD and as a 4-disc LP, it was released by Rhino Records on September 17, 2013.\n\nThe name \"Sunshine Daydream\" is taken from the coda section of the Dead song \"Sugar Magnolia\".\n\nThe lineup of the Grateful Dead for this concert—and for all their concerts from July 1972 to October 1974—was Jerry Garcia on guitar and vocals, Bob Weir on guitar and vocals, Phil Lesh on bass and vocals, Keith Godchaux on keyboards, Donna Jean Godchaux on vocals, and Bill Kreutzmann on drums.\n\nThe show was a benefit for the Springfield Creamery in nearby Springfield, Oregon. Merry Pranksters Ken Kesey and Ken Babbs emceed the concert. The Dead played all afternoon and into the dark after an opening set by the New Riders of the Purple Sage. In 2004, the New Riders' performance was released as an album called \"Veneta, Oregon, 8/27/72\".\n\nThe concert was filmed using four 16 mm cameras, in the woods of the Oregon Coast Range foothills, on the grounds of the Oregon Country Fair. Originally even more cameras had been planned, under an ambitious scheme: \"The plot was to develop a signature visual style of representing the band: a camera for each of the 16 channels (at least!) emphasizing the visual kinetics of the music making itself as well as the enormous open communication within the band.\"\n\n\nSunshine Daydream is a live album by the rock band the Grateful Dead. It contains the complete concert recorded on August 27, 1972 at the Old Renaissance Faire Grounds in Veneta, Oregon. Produced as a 3–disc CD and as a 4-disc LP, it was released by Rhino Records on September 17, 2013. Unlike Dick's Picks, Road Trips, Dave's Picks, and certain other of the band's archival series of live album releases, which are simply two-track stereo recordings made from the soundboard during the concert, the show on the album was recorded on a 16-track multitrack recorder and was mixed down to stereo just prior to the album's 2013 release.\n\nThe album debuted at #19 on the \"Billboard\" 200 on October 5, 2013. It was the Grateful Dead's second top 20 album, after \"In the Dark\", which reached #6 in 1987.\n\nOn AllMusic, Fred Thomas said, \"The three sets here have everything that made this one of the most colorful and captivating eras of the Dead's live playing. Somewhere between the caveman psychedelia of their beginnings and the bluegrass-steeped folk-rock of their most popular studio albums \"American Beauty\" and \"Workingman's Dead\", Garcia and company refined their live jamming skills into something that seemed almost like a mental synchronization at its best... A long-traded fan favorite, \"Sunshine Daydream\" finally sees a properly mixed presentation of the 16-track master tapes of nearly three hours of one of the Grateful Dead's finest concert moments. It's essential listening for Deadheads and possibly the best place for the curious to jump in.\"\n\nDisc 1\nDisc 2\nDisc 3\nNotes\n\n"}
{"id": "1882119", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1882119", "title": "Chip Ganassi Racing", "text": "Chip Ganassi Racing\n\nChip Ganassi Racing Teams or simply Chip Ganassi Racing (CGR), is an American auto racing organization with teams competing in the NTT IndyCar Series and NASCAR Cup Series. They have formerly competed in the NASCAR Xfinity Series, Global Rallycross Championship, FIA World Endurance Championship and the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship. It was founded in 1990 by businessman and former race driver Chip Ganassi, from the assets of Patrick Racing to compete in the CART IndyCar World Series.\n\nAfter winning four consecutive CART championships from 1996–1999 with drivers Jimmy Vasser, Alex Zanardi and Juan Pablo Montoya, in 2000 Ganassi became the first CART organization to return to the Indianapolis 500 after the open wheel \"Split\" between CART and the Indy Racing League in 1996. A dominant victory with Montoya would foresee the team's permanent switch to the IRL (now IndyCar Series), where further championships would be won with Scott Dixon and Dario Franchitti, including another four straight from 2008–2011. The team fields the Nos. 8, 9, and 10 Dallara-Hondas for Marcus Ericsson, Dixon and Felix Rosenqvist.\n\nIn 2001, Ganassi bought a majority stake in Felix Sabates' Team SABCO NASCAR team, which had operated since 1989, marking his entry into that championship and inheriting that organizations history, while also partnering to compete in the Grand-Am Rolex Sports Car Series. In 2009, Ganassi partnered with Dale Earnhardt, Inc. owner Teresa Earnhardt to merge their NASCAR operations into Ganassi's shop and run independently as Earnhardt Ganassi Racing with Felix Sabates. The NASCAR team dropped the Earnhardt name in 2014, and Ganassi revealed that Teresa was never truly involved with the team. Rob Kauffman, chairman of the Race Team Alliance, purchased a stake in the team in 2015. After the 2020 season, Sabates will retire from his ownership role. The NASCAR program has fielded full-time entries for notable drivers including Kyle Petty, Joe Nemechek, Sterling Marlin, Jimmy Spencer, Juan Pablo Montoya and Jamie McMurray. They currently run the Nos. 1 and 42 Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 1LEs for Kurt Busch and Matt Kenseth in a technical alliance with Hendrick Motorsports.\n\nTogether, they have won 12 Open Wheel titles (4 in CART, 8 in IndyCar), 5 Grand-Am Road Racing championships, and wins in the Indianapolis 500 (Four times), Daytona 500, Brickyard 400, 24 Hours of Daytona, 12 Hours of Sebring and a 24 Hours of Le Mans class win, and over 200 wins across all categories.\n\n\n\nIn 1989, Chip Ganassi, who had driven in the IndyCar World Series but had his career cut short due to a career-ending crash at Michigan in 1984, joined Pat Patrick as co-owner for Emerson Fittipaldi's Marlboro IndyCar team. Patrick had announced he was going to retire at the end of the year, and the team would go completely to Ganassi. The team won the Indy 500 and the IndyCar Championship.\n\nBy season's end, Patrick had second thoughts. Instead of retracting the sale of the team to Ganassi, he went ahead with the deal as planned, and instead restarted his team by taking over the upstart Alfa Romeo IndyCar effort for 1990. Fittipaldi took the Marlboro sponsorship to Team Penske, an arrangement that was also pre-planned. (Penske had supplied Patrick with a fleet of Penske chassis for 1989 as part of the deal).\n\nGanassi officially took over the remaining assets of the team (including the 1989 Penske chassis), and renamed it Chip Ganassi Racing. He signed former Formula One driver Eddie Cheever and raced full-time in the IndyCar World series with Target as primary sponsor.\n\nIn 1992 Ganassi expanded to a two-car effort for the Indy 500, adding Arie Luyendyk for the Indy-only entry. Later Ganassi debuted rookie Robby Gordon in selected events. For 1993, Luyendyk replaced Cheever full-time. Luyendyk won the pole position for the Indy 500 and finished second to Fittipaldi, Ganassi's former driver in his partnership with Patrick. For 1994, Michael Andretti joined the team, immediately after returning from his failed transition to Formula One in . He scored Ganassi's first IndyCar victory at Surfers Paradise.\n\nTarget continued to sponsor Ganassi's operation through the decade, and by the mid part of the decade, the team had risen to the top of the series. Perhaps the most impressive was Juan Pablo Montoya winning the championship in his rookie season in 1999. They won four consecutive series championships, with Jimmy Vasser (1996), Alex Zanardi (1997–1998), and Montoya in 1999, becoming the first car owner to win four consecutive CART championships. In 2000, Ganassi became the first CART team to break ranks and return to race in the Indianapolis 500, part of the rival Indy Racing League. The team saw instant success as Montoya dominated the race. Montoya also became the first driver to win the Indianapolis 500 and the Michigan 500 in the same year since Rick Mears in 1991. However, he was unable to duplicate his championship success of 1999. Vasser's performance steadily dwindled, as his lone victory at Houston was his first in nearly two years.\n\nThe team ran from 1992 to 2002 before moving into the Indy Racing League full-time. They had run one IRL entry for former motocross racer Jeff Ward in 2002, in which Ward won one race at Texas in one of the closest finishes in IRL history.\n\nChip Ganassi Racing initially entered the Indy Racing League (IRL) with Juan Pablo Montoya and Jimmy Vasser in the 2000 Indianapolis 500 won by rookie Montoya. In 2001 they returned to Indy with Vasser, Bruno Junqueira, Nicolas Minassian, and NASCAR's Tony Stewart, who would also compete in that evening's Coca-Cola 600. But in neither year did they run the entire IndyCar Series season.\n\nFor 2002, Ganassi made the jump to the IndyCar Series full-time with Jeff Ward driving one car, with the addition of Ganassi's two CART Championship drivers Kenny Bräck and Bruno Junqueira at Indianapolis. None of those three would drive for Ganassi in 2003; the replacements were Scott Dixon – a midseason addition to Ganassi's Champ Car team in 2002 – and Tomas Scheckter. Dixon won three races and the series championship while Scheckter struggled and was released from his contract. Tony Renna was due to replace him, but was killed in a testing crash at Indianapolis. Englishman Darren Manning wound up in the seat for 2004. The team's performance suffered the next two seasons and when Manning was fired, a bevy of drivers ran in Ganassi's cars, among them former Formula One test drivers Ryan Briscoe and Giorgio Pantano, and Jaques Lazier. For 2006, Ganassi scaled back to two cars, with Dixon returning along with 2005 Indianapolis 500 Champion Dan Wheldon, whom Ganassi signed away from Andretti Green Racing in the offseason. The team also changed to Honda engines (due to series engine supplier standardization from 2006 to 2011 seasons), along with all other IndyCar teams, and Dallara chassis for 2006.\n\nThe 2007 IndyCar Series season showed promise for Ganassi, as Dixon took 4 wins at Watkins Glen, Nashville, Mid Ohio, and Sonoma and Wheldon took 2 additional wins at Homestead and Kansas. The 2008 IndyCar season was even stronger for the team with eventual champion Dixon taking wins at Homestead, Indianapolis, Texas, Nashville, Edmonton, and Kentucky, and teammate Wheldon finishing 4th overall after winning at Kansas again and at Iowa. Shortly before the conclusion of the season it was announced that Wheldon would not return as Dixon's teammate in 2009, a role taken by 2007 IndyCar Champion and Indy 500 winner Dario Franchitti of Scotland. Franchitti teamed with Dixon for the non-championship race at Surfers' Paradise at the end of 2008.\n\nThe Target Chip Ganassi car driven by Franchitti won the 94th running of the Indianapolis 500 on Sunday May 30, 2010.\n\nFor 2011, Ganassi expanded, to add an additional 2-car team for Graham Rahal and Charlie Kimball housed in the race shop of NHRA drag racer Kenny Bernstein.\n\nGanassi announced that in 2012, all 4 cars would be powered by Honda engines after the series decided to have multiple engine manufacturers (Honda, Chevrolet and Lotus) for the first time since 2005.\n\nThe Ganassi cars driven by Franchitti and Dixon came in first and second in the 2012 Indianapolis 500 on Sunday May 27, 2012. It was Franchitti's third Indianapolis 500 win and his second win with Ganassi. Rahal left Ganassi following the season for his father's team, Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing. In 2013, the team was dominant for the second half of the year, with Kimball's first win at Mid-Ohio, and Dixon adding four wins to overtake Hélio Castroneves for his third IndyCar title. The team also ran a fourth car, the No. 8, at Indianapolis for Briscoe, sponsored by NTT DATA. In spite of the title, Ganassi was dealt a major blow when Franchitti was medically forced into retirement following a crash at Race 2 in Houston. Alex Tagliani replaced Franchitti at Auto Club.\n\nIn 2014, Ganassi switched to Chevrolet engines. In a twist, Ganassi would hire 2013 Indy 500 winner Tony Kanaan to drive the No. 10 Target car, while Briscoe and NTT Data signed on for a full season in the No. 8 car. The team once again struggled during the first half of the season, but hit its stride during the second half, with Dixon winning at Mid-Ohio and Sonoma, while Kanaan won the season finale at Auto Club. For 2015, the team would sign Indy Lights champion Sage Karam to share the No. 8 with Sebastián Saavedra. Dixon would claim his fourth title in a tiebreaker with Juan Pablo Montoya on the strength of three wins at Long Beach, Texas, and Sonoma. Kanaan would not win that year, but had two runner up finishes at Texas and Fontana. Both Karam and Saavedra would struggle in the No. 8, save for a lone podium by Karam at Iowa. For 2016, Ganassi would replace Karam and Saavedra with former Formula 1 driver Max Chilton. 2016 would be a down year for the team, with Dixon winning twice at Phoenix and Watkins Glen, while Kanaan had only two podiums while Chilton and Kimball struggled.\n\nBeginning in the 2017 season, Ganassi changed engine suppliers back to Honda, retaining their four drivers. Also, 2017 marked the end of Target sponsorship in Indycar, as a new chairman elected to change the retail giant's sporting sponsorships.\n\nFor 2018, Ganassi would downsize to two cars, with Kimball and Chilton taking their sponsorship over to Carlin due to team's cost-efficiency. Scott Dixon remains in the No. 9 with sponsorship from PNC Bank. In addition, Ganassi signed 2017 Indycar Rookie of the Year Ed Jones to drive the No. 10 car in 2018, with sponsorship from NTT Data, replacing Tony Kanaan. Dixon would win his fifth IndyCar title on the strength of wins at Detroit, Texas, and Toronto. Jones would only have two podiums and was released at season's end in favor of Formula E driver Felix Rosenqvist.\n\nFor the 2019 season, Dixon would again find victory at Detroit as well as Mid-Ohio, but a inconsistent season would leave him a distant fourth in points. Rosenqvist would have a consistent season, fending off Colton Herta for Rookie of the Year honors. The 2020 season saw the return of its No. 8 entry, driven by former Alfa Romeo Racing driver Marcus Ericsson.\n\nOn December 20, 2006, Chip Ganassi Racing announced that it would field an Indy Lights team for the first time in 2007, with drivers Chris Festa and Pablo Pérez. Perez was severely injured in a crash in the opening race of the Indy Lights season and was not replaced. Festa finished 10th in points without winning a race in a season dominated by Alex Lloyd who was signed by Chip Ganassi Racing at the end of the season. The team partnered with Integra Motorsports in 2007 and 2008 fielding a variety of development drivers, notably New Zealanders Marc Williams and Jonny Reid.\n\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> Season still in progress\n\nInitially, CGR fielded the 01 Lexus-Riley car driven by Scott Pruett and Max Papis. Their second team car, the 02, was driven by Jimmy Morales and Luis Diaz. CGR won the 2006 24 Hours of Daytona with Ganassi IRL drivers Dan Wheldon and Scott Dixon along with NASCAR driver Casey Mears. In 2007, Ganassi won the race again, this time with Pruett, former Formula 1 driver Juan Pablo Montoya, and Salvador Duran, making him the first owner to win it in back to back years since Al Holbert in 1986–87. In 2008 Chip Ganassi Racing won a third Daytona 24 in a row. Also in 2008, Chip Ganassi Racing won their 3rd Grand-Am Championship, with drivers Scott Pruett, and Memo Rojas. It was Pruett's 8th Road Racing Championship. Also participating was Memo Rojas, the first Mexican to win a major Road Racing title in North America. For the 2010 Grand Am season the team switched from Lexus-Riley to BMW-Riley. Rojas and Pruett won 9 out of 12 races and eventually won the Grand-Am championship.\n\nGanassi's Grand-Am Series team started 2011 in the best possible fashion, earning a one-two finish in the Rolex 24 Hours of Daytona endurance race. Ganassi's two cars ran towards the front of the field for the majority of the race, and driver Scott Pruett, having started third, defeated Scott Dixon by a margin of victory of over two seconds in a one-lap sprint to the finish after a late caution period.\n\nThe victory made Ganassi the first racing team owner to win the four of the most important races in North American auto racing, the Daytona 500, Indianapolis 500, Brickyard 400, and 24 Hours of Daytona, within the same 12-month span. It was Pruett's fourth win in the event; for co-driver Memo Rojas, his second victory, while co-drivers Joey Hand and Graham Rahal won for the first time, the latter thirty years after his father, Bobby Rahal, won the event.\n\nCGR would field a Riley-Ford Daytona Prototype in the inaugural season of the merged United SportsCar Championship for Scott Pruett and Memo Rojas, winning three races. In 2015, Rojas was replaced by ex-BMW works driver Joey Hand, and the team fielded an \"all-star car\" at Daytona consisting of the teams IndyCar and NASCAR drivers.\n\nFor 2016, the team would move to the GTLM class with the brand new Ford GT and thus the Daytona Prototype programme officially disbanded. Long time Ganassi driver Pruett would no longer have a place on the team, as Hand would partner with Dirk Müller (another ex-BMW works driver), while Ryan Briscoe and Richard Westbrook were hired to drive the second GT. For Daytona, the team would bring out the Riley DPs one last time, the IndyCar/NASCAR \"all-star car\" being joined by a team of Alexander Wurz, Brendon Hartley, Andy Priaulx and Lance Stroll, in the last Rolex 24 of the DP era.\n\nOn 12 June 2015, at Le Mans, it was announced that Ford will return to the 2016 24 Hours of Le Mans in 2016 with a factory-supported, four-car effort operating as Ford Chip Ganassi Racing. The cars will be campaigned by Chip Ganassi Racing in the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship, and by Multimatic Motorsports Europe (joint-venture) in the FIA World Endurance Championship under the Ford Chip Ganassi Team UK banner.<br>\n<br>\nWith the Chip Ganassi teams racing their GT, Ford has had podium wins in the FIA GT manufacturer's category both years that it has competed.\n\n<br>FIA World Endurance Cup for GT Manufacturers<br>\n2016 3rd Place: Ford<br>\n2017 2nd Place: Ford <br>\n<br>\nFIA Endurance Trophy for LMGTE Pro Teams<br>\n2016 2nd Place: Car #67<br>\n2016 4th Place: Car #66<br>\n2017 2nd Place: Car #67<br>\n2017 7th Place: Car #66 \n<br>\n<br>World Endurance Cup for GT Drivers\n<br>2016: S.

On March 18, 2015, Ganassi announced the creation of a team that began competing in the GRC in 2015. The team is based in the NASCAR shop in Concord, North Carolina, and is led by former Ford World Rally Team engineer Carl Goodman. The team hired former JR Motorsports NASCAR driver Steve Arpin and 13-time X Games medalist Brian Deegan to run the No. 00 and 38 M-Sport Ford Fiestas, respectively. Arpin contested the full season, while Deegan competed in seven of the season's twelve races.\n\nIn 2016 Arpin and Deegan was back full-time. Arpin earned the team's first win at Daytona.\n\nIn 2017, Ganassi announced he would shut down the Global RallyCross program to focus on other series. The team's assets were acquired by Loenbro Motorsports.\n\nRace cancelled.\n\n"}
{"id": "1882121", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1882121", "title": "Phillips Exeter Academy Library", "text": "Phillips Exeter Academy Library\n\nPhillips Exeter Academy Library is a library that serves Phillips Exeter Academy, an independent boarding school located in Exeter, New Hampshire. It is the largest secondary school library in the world, containing 160,000 volumes over nine levels with a shelf capacity of 250,000 volumes.\n\nWhen it became clear in the 1950s that the library had outgrown its existing building, the school initially hired an architect who proposed a traditional design for the new building. Deciding instead to construct a library with a contemporary design, the school gave the commission to Louis Kahn in 1965. The library opened in 1971. In 1997 the library received the Twenty-five Year Award from the American Institute of Architects, an award that recognizes architecture of enduring significance that is given to no more than one building per year.\n\nKahn structured the library in three concentric square rings. The outer ring, which is built of load-bearing brick, includes all four exterior walls and the library carrel desks immediately inside them. The middle ring, which is built of reinforced concrete, holds the heavy book stacks. The inner ring is a dramatic atrium with enormous circular openings in its walls that reveal several floors of book stacks.\n\nThe first library at Phillips Exeter Academy was a single small room. A member of the class of 1833 remembered it as containing \"old sermons and some history, scarcely ever read\". Even as late as 1905 the library had only two rooms and 2,000 volumes.\n\nIn 1912 the Davis Library was added to the campus with space for 5,000 volumes. Although a major improvement, its atmosphere was inhospitable by the standards of later generations. Stacks were locked to students, for example, and the librarian's office was located at the entrance to the stacks to maximize control over entry. Decisions about book selections and the library's program were in the hands of an all-male faculty committee instead of the female librarian.\n\nIn 1950 Rodney Armstrong became librarian, the first with a graduate degree in library science. One of his first moves was to open the stacks to students. That solved one problem, but the real difficulty was the lack of space. The library contained 35,000 volumes at that point, many of them stored in cardboard boxes for lack of shelf room. After years of effort, Armstrong eventually succeeded in bringing a new library to the academy.\n\nArchitect Louis Kahn was chosen to design the new library in 1965, and it was ready for occupancy in 1971. Architectural historian Vincent Scully acknowledged its architectural significance by using a photo of it as the frontispiece for his book \"Modern Architecture and Other Essays\".\n\nOn November 16, 1971, classes were suspended for a day, and students, faculty, and staff moved books (the library had 60,000 volumes by this time) from the old Davis Library into the new library.\n\nHenry Bedford, who became librarian shortly after the new library was occupied, supervised the transition not only to the new building but also to a new way of operating a library. Staff librarians were encouraged to see themselves as co-instructors with the regular faculty and to put less emphasis on shushing library patrons. A piano was installed and the library began sponsoring lectures and concerts.\n\nIn 1977 Jacquelyn Thomas became the first librarian with full faculty status. By 2006 she oversaw a staff of seven, all with graduate degrees in library science. During Thomas' tenure the library's collection and programming grew to a size appropriate to a small liberal arts college. Today the library houses 160,000 volumes on nine levels and has a shelf capacity of 250,000 volumes, making it the largest secondary school library in the world. The library also contains a collection of works by alumni as well as the Academy Archives.\n\nThe library was the first building on campus to be computerized thanks to the foresight of Armstrong and Kahn, who supplied the library with sufficient conduit space for the cabling needed by the coming computer revolution.\n\nIn 1995, the library was officially named the Class of 1945 Library, honoring Dr. Lewis Perry, Exeter's eighth principal, who served from 1914 to 1946.\n\nThe project to build a new and larger library began in 1950 and progressed slowly for several years. By the mid-1960s, O'Connor & Kilham, the architectural firm that had designed libraries for Barnard, Amherst and West Point, had been chosen to design the new library and had drafted plans with traditional architecture. Richard Day arrived as the new principal of the academy at that point, however, and found their design to be unsatisfactory. He dismissed them, declaring his intention to hire \"the very best contemporary architect in the world to design our library\".\n\nThe school's building committee was tasked with finding a new architect. Influential members of the committee became interested in Louis Kahn at an early stage, but they interviewed several other prominent architects as well, including Paul Rudolph, I. M. Pei, Philip Johnson and Edward Larrabee Barnes. Kahn's prospects received a boost when Jonas Salk, whose son had attended Exeter, called Armstrong and invited him to visit the Salk Institute in California, which Kahn had recently built to widespread acclaim. Kahn was awarded the commission for the library in November 1965.\n\nKahn had already thought deeply about the proper design for a library, having earlier submitted proposals for a new library at Washington University. He also expressed a deep reverence for books, saying, \"A book is tremendously important. Nobody ever paid the price of a book, they only paid for the printing\". Describing the book as an offering, Kahn said, \"How precious a book is in light of the offering, in light of the one who has the privilege of the offering. The library tells you of this offering\".\n\nThe building committee carefully considered what they wanted in a new library and presented their ideas to Kahn in an unusually detailed document that went through more than fifty drafts. The early designs included some items that were eventually rejected, such as a roof garden and two exterior towers with stairs that were open to the weather. They were removed from the plans when the building committee reminded Kahn that neither of those features would be practical in New England winters.\n\nThe library has an almost cubical shape: each of its four sides is 111 feet (33 m) wide and 80 feet (24 m) tall. It is constructed in three concentric areas (which Kahn called \"doughnuts\"). In the words of Robert McCarter, author of \"Louis I. Kahn,\" \"From the very beginning of the design process, Kahn conceived of the three types of spaces as if they were three buildings constructed of different materials and of different scales – buildings-within-buildings\". The outer area, which houses the reading carrels, is made of brick. The middle area, which contains the heavy book stacks, is made of reinforced concrete. The inner area is an atrium.\n\nThe library's heating and cooling needs are supplied by the nearby dining hall, which Kahn built at the same time as the library, but which is considered to be of less architectural significance.\n\nThe building committee's document specified that the new library should be \"unpretentious, though in a handsome, inviting contemporary style\". Kahn accordingly made the building's exterior relatively undramatic, suitable for a small New England town. Its facade is primarily brick with teak wood panels at most windows marking the location of a pair of wooden carrels. The bricks are load-bearing; that is, the weight of the outer portion of the building is carried by the bricks themselves, not by a hidden steel frame. Kahn calls this fact to the viewer's attention by making the brick piers noticeably thicker at the bottom where they have more weight to bear. The windows are correspondingly wider toward the top where the piers are thinner. Kahn said, \"The weight of the brick makes it dance like a fairy above and groan below.\"\n\nThe corners of the building are chamfered (cut off), allowing the viewers to see the outer parts of the building's structure, the outer \"doughnut.\" The \"Macmillan Encyclopedia of Architects\" says, \"Kahn sometimes perceived a building as enclosed by 'plate-walls,' and to give emphasis to this structural form, he interrupted the plates at the corner, leaving a gap between them. The Library at Phillips Exeter Academy in Exeter, New Hampshire (1967–1972) is a classic example\". Each of these four brick \"plate-walls,\" which house the library carrels, is 16 feet (4.9 m) deep.\n\nAt the top of the exterior walls is a row of openings similar to the windows below except that these openings are above the roof and have no glass. Vincent Scully said that Kahn was drawn to architecture based on \"solid, almost primitive, masonry masses with voids in them without glass.\" The bottoms of these window-like openings are 6 feet (1.8 m) above the floor of an arcade that follows the perimeter of the top of building.\n\nAnother arcade circles the building on the ground floor. Kahn disliked the idea of a building that was dominated by its entrance, so he concealed the main entrance to the library behind this arcade. His original design, however, called for landscaping with a paved forecourt that would have indicated the entrance without disrupting the symmetry of the facade. Architectural historian William Jordy said, \"Perverse as the hidden entrance may seem, it emphatically reinforces Kahn's statement that his design begins on the periphery with the circle of individual carrels, each with its separate window.\"\n\nA circular double staircase built from concrete and faced with travertine greets the visitor upon entry into the library. At the top of the stairs the visitor enters a dramatic central hall with enormous circular openings that reveal several floors of book stacks. At the top of the atrium, two massive concrete cross beams diffuse the light entering from the clerestory windows.\n\nCarter Wiseman, author of \"Louis Kahn: Beyond Time and Style\", said, \"The many comparisons of the experience of entering Exeter's main space to that of entering a cathedral are not accidental. Kahn clearly wanted the students to be humbled by the sense of arrival, and he succeeded.\" David Rineheart, who worked as an architect for Kahn, said, \"for Lou, every building was a temple. Salk was a temple for science. Dhaka was a temple for government. Exeter was a temple for learning.\"\n\nBecause the stacks are visible from the floor of the central hall, the layout of the library is clear to the visitor at a glance, which was one of the goals the academy's building committee had set for Kahn.\n\nThe central room is 52 feet (15.8 m) high, as measured from the floor to the beginning of the roof structure, and 32 feet (9.8 m) wide. Those dimensions approximate a ratio known as the golden ratio, which was studied by the ancient Greeks and has been considered the ideal architectural ratio for centuries.\n\nThe circle and the square that are combined so dramatically in the atrium were considered to be the paradigmatic geometric units by the ancient Roman architect Vitruvius. He also noted that the human body is proportioned so that it can fit in both shapes, a concept that was famously expressed with a combined circle and square by Leonardo da Vinci in his drawing \"Vitruvian Man\".The topic was repeatedly raised by Kahn in several projects.\n\nThe specifications of the academy's building committee called for a large number of carrels (the library has 210) and for the carrels to be placed near windows so they could receive natural light. The latter point matched Kahn's personal inclinations exactly because he himself strongly preferred natural light: \"He is also known to have worked by a window, refusing to switch on an electric light even on the darkest of days.\" Each pair of carrels has a large window above, and each individual carrel has a small window at desk height with a sliding panel for adjusting the light.\n\nThe placement of carrel spaces at the periphery was the product of thinking that began years earlier when Kahn submitted proposals for a new library at Washington University. There he dispensed with the traditional arrangement of completely separate library spaces for books and readers, usually with book stacks on the periphery of the library and reading rooms toward the center. Instead he felt that reading spaces should be near the books and also to natural light. For Kahn, the essence of a library was the act of taking a book from a shelf and walking a few steps to a window for a closer look: \"A man with a book goes to the light. A library begins that way. He will not go fifty feet away to an electric light.\" Each carrel area is associated with two levels of book stacks, with the upper level structured as a mezzanine that overlooks the carrels. This arrangement of numbered floors and mezzanines (B, G, 1, 1M, 2, 2M, 3, 3M, 4) elegantly skirted the town code limiting buildings to four stories. The book stacks also look out into the atrium.\n\nThe inherent massiveness of the brick \"plate-wall\" structure of the outer part of the library helps to create the cloistered atmosphere that Kahn felt was appropriate for library carrels. While explaining his proposal for the library at Washington University, Kahn had used the example of the cloistered carrels at the monastic library at Dunham, England, to explain his \"desire to find a space construction system in which the carrels were inherent in the support which harbored them ... Wall-bearing masonry construction with its niches and vaults has the appealing structural order to provide naturally such spaces.\" \n\nArchitectural experts sometimes differ in their interpretations of Kahn's design. For example, in reasoning why the cross beams at the clerestory windows above the atrium are so massive, Carter Wiseman says, \"While they appear to be—and indeed are—structural, they are far deeper than necessary; their no-less-important role was to diffuse the sunlight coming in from the surrounding clerestory windows and reflect it down into the atrium.\" Sarah Williams Goldhagen thinks there is more to the story, asserting that \"the concrete X-shaped cross below the skylit ceiling at the Exeter Library is grossly exaggerated for dramatic effect.\" Kathleen James-Chakraborty goes even further: \"Above, in the most sublime gesture of all, floats a concrete cross brace, illuminated by clerestory windows. Its weight, which appears ready to come crashing down upon the onlooker, revives the sense of threat dissipated elsewhere by the reassuring familiarity of the brick skin and wood details.\" Kahn similarly floated a massive concrete structure above the sanctuary of the First Unitarian Church of Rochester, which he designed a few years earlier. The library is also often discussed in comparison with contemporary sacred buildings. The plans have some characteristics of Vasrtu Purusha Mandala as well as other symbolic forms that allow various symbolic interpretations.\n\nAnother issue is the extent to which Kahn deliberately introduced elements into some of his buildings that give them the ageless atmosphere of ruins. Kahn himself spoke of \"wrapping ruins around buildings\", although in the context of another project. In his essay \"Louis I. Kahn and the Ruins of Rome\", Vincent Scully argues that Kahn followed this practice in several of his buildings, including this library, saying, \"And in his library at Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire, Kahn won't even let it become a building; he wants it to remain a ruin. The walls don't connect at the top. They remain like a hollow shell\". Romaldo Giurgola, on the other hand, avoids this interpretation in the entry he wrote for Louis Kahn in the \"Macmillan Encyclopedia of Architects\". In it, while discussing the arrangement of exterior components of Kahn's National Assembly Building of Bangladesh, Giurgola wrote, \"This relationship with daylight was the determining element behind this solution, rather than the formal desire to 'create ruins,' as some critics have suggested.\" In the very next paragraph Guirgola describes the chamfered corners of the library by saying only that Kahn used this device to show that the structural importance of the corner is greatly reduced in buildings like the Exeter Library that are constructed with reinforced concrete and other modern materials.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1882125", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1882125", "title": "Type 214 submarine", "text": "Type 214 submarine\n\nThe Type 214 is a diesel-electric submarine developed by Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft GmbH (HDW). It features diesel propulsion with an air-independent propulsion (AIP) system using Siemens polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) hydrogen fuel cells. The Type 214 submarine is derived from the Type 212, but as an export variant it lacks some of the classified technologies of its smaller predecessor, the most important of which is probably the non-magnetic steel hull, which makes the Type 212 submarine difficult to detect using a magnetic anomaly detector.\n\nA contract to build three boats for the Hellenic Navy was signed 15 February 2000 and a fourth unit was ordered in June 2002. The first boat was built at HDW in Kiel, Germany and the rest at the Hellenic Shipyards Co. in Skaramangas, Greece. The Hellenic Navy named them the \"Papanikolis\"-class.\n\nThe Republic of Korea Navy has ordered nine Type 214 submarines, designated as \"Son Won-Il\"-class, to be built in Korea by Hyundai Heavy Industries and Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering; three first batch models had entered service since 2007, and six second batch models will enter service from 2012.\n\nDue to improvements in the pressure hull materials, the Type 214 can dive nearly 400 meters. It can also carry food, fresh water and fuel for 84 days of operation.\n\n\nThe Hellenic Navy ordered four Type 214 submarines to be known as the \"Papanikolis\" class. The first, \"Papanikolis\", was built in Germany; the following three were scheduled for construction at HDW's Hellenic Shipyards in Greece. In December 2006, \"StrategyPage\" reported that \"Papanikolis\" was found to have numerous technical problems. Among the reported problems with the submarine were excessive propeller cavitation, overheating of the air-independent propulsion system's fuel cells, and excessive rolling in bad weather when surfaced. \"Seapower magazine\" reported the Hellenic Navy refused to accept \"Papanikolis\"; additional problems noted were inadequate air-independent propulsion system output power, inappropriate periscope vibration, sonar flank array problems and seawater leakage into the ship's hydraulics.\n\nThe Hellenic Navy officers in charge of the testing program at the Kiel shipyards in Germany made their case clear in a 2007 investigative journalism program called \"Neoi Fakeloi\" on Skai TV (Greece). Retired Rear Admiral M. Simionakis, who had been in charge of the \"Papanikolis\" program for the navy, told the interviewer that the manufacturer had made two attempts to fix a severe balance problem in the submarine, including shifting 21 tons of material from the top to the bottom, yet the vessel continued to heel as much as 46 degrees in sea trials. Photographic evidence of the severe heeling was presented. In the same TV program, the officer replacing Simionakis in Kiel, Capt. K. Tziotis, listed seven ongoing, serious problems with the vessel, including balance problems when traveling on the surface, problems with the AIP system, problems with the weapon system, problems with the periscope, and problems with flooding.\n\nFor its part, TKMS, the German shipbuilder of Type 214, has asserted that it solved all the boat's technical problems in 2006 (before the interviews of the Greek officers mentioned above) and claimed the Greek Navy's continuing complaints about \"Papanikolis\" technical condition are just a ploy to justify a price reduction. Therefore, TKMS refused to deliver the boat to the Greek Navy until all debts were paid and \"Papanikolis\" remained in Kiel harbor. Despite this position by TKMS, the Hellenic Navy officers in charge of the submarine delivery have repeatedly stated there are problems with \"Papanikolis\". In October 2008, \"Papanikolis\" conducted a new round of trials, which showed that the excessive rolling problem had finally been fixed. The rest of the problems are considered solved. According to the Greek defence press, acceptance of the vessel was imminent. The second boat, \"Pipinos\", was officially launched on 6 October 2014 and passed through Greek harbour acceptance trials in Elefsina.\n\nOn September 21, 2009 TKMS announced that the contract with the Greek Navy for all four submarines had been cancelled due to country's arrears of more than 520 million Euros. TKMS began seeking arbitration to resolve the matter.\n\nOn October 27, 2009 the Greek Ministry of Defence confirmed that they intended to accept the three boats built in Greece. The Greek \"Papanikolis\" U214 class is equipped with a hoistable radar mast which does not penetrate the pressure hull of the submarine. In the top of the radar mast the radar transmitter is installed. This transmitter is part of the SPHINX Radar System supplied by Thales Defence Deutschland GmbH in Kiel]]. The radar sensor is a FMCW transceiver which can't be detected by ESM systems in medium terms. This technology is so called LPI radar, which means \"Low probability of intercept\". The transmitting power is lower than the power of a mobile phone but the resolution more precise compared to high power Pulse radar. Thales SPHINX radar is a tactical radar, designed for submarines. Greece ordered four submarines and paid six times the list price(2 bn euros)\n\nThe South Korean \"Son Won-Il\" U214-class submarine (Hangul: 손원일급 잠수함, Hanja: 孫元一級潛水艦) is equipped with a SPHINX-D Radar System supplied by Thales Defence Deutschland GmbH. It uses an additional pulse transmitter in the top of the mast. The combination of high power pulse radar and a very low power LPI transmitter is very effective for submarines. During surface operations, the boat sails with an open pulse fingerprint for ESM systems, but within a secret mission the operator switches to LPI mode. The boat remains invisible to others. Total of 9 are planned and 8 are in active duty. South Korea ordered its first three KSS-II/ Type 214 boats in 2000, which were assembled by Hyundai Heavy Industries. The Batch 2 order will add six more submarines to the Navy, to be built by Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering.\n\nIn March 2008, it was reported in the media that the first Type 214 submarine of the Republic of Korea Navy suffered from defects related to excessive noise from the screw, according to anonymous sources. Later ROKN denied the report. There were no further reports of such noise problems in succeeding South Korean Type 214 submarines. The first three Type 214 submarines of South Korea were built by Hyundai Heavy Industries. In August 2008, South Korea signed another contract with HDW for six more Type 214 submarines. The Batch 2 order will add six more submarines to the Navy, to be built by Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering. \"Hong Beom-do\", a specialized guided missile submarine was launched on 7 April 2016.\n\nIn 2005 Portugal awarded a contract to Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft for two Type 214 submarines, which were delivered in 2010.\n\nThe first request by the Turkish Naval Forces was made in 2009 and considered to be delivered in 2014. However, due to delay, a new contract was signed in 2016 and it is planned to be delivered in 2020.\nThe Turkish Navy had commenced negotiations with HDW for six licence-built Type 214 class air-independent propulsion (AIP) submarines. According to the Undersecretariat for Defence Industries of the Turkish Government these submarines will be produced with maximum local content at Gölcük Naval Shipyard in Kocaeli, Turkey.\n\nOn 2 July 2009, HDW and the Turkish Ministry of Defence entered into an agreement for the licensed production of six platforms. The agreement was the largest defence acquisition project in Turkey at the time after the firm order for 116 F-35 fighters at a cost of in excess of $10 billion. Ankara hoped that its advanced, locally produced and highly modified Type 214 submarines will enter into service by 2015. Defence Minister Vecdi Gonul stated that \"Turkish industrial participation in the project would be worth around 80 percent of the total value of the deal\".\n\nAs the Turkish Type 214 will have a significant amount of Turkish indigenous systems on board, this variant of the Type 214 will be known as the Type 214TN (Turkish Navy). HDW will preassemble structural and mechanical parts of the submarine in Germany, or classified elements such as the fuel cells and propulsion system and will then ship them to Turkey. All electronic and weapon systems (including the C4I system) will be of Turkish production.\n\nOn 1 July 2011, the 2 billion euros order for six U 214 submarine material packages placed with ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems by Turkey entered into force with receipt of the advance payment. This enabled ThyssenKrupp to begin executing the order. The order was designated to contribute to securing employment at HDW in Kiel, as well as at many subcontractors in Germany and Turkey, for the next ten years. Yet, recently Turkey has received around 2 Million euros compensation from ThyssenKrupp due to delayed manufacturing of the Type214TN. Possible reason for this delay is Turkeys demand for in-house developed software within the submarines.\n\nIn 2008, the Pakistan Navy entered in negotiation of possibly purchasing three Type 214 to be built in KESW through a technology transfer, and the HDW CEO Walter Freitag confirming and reportedly telling the news media in Pakistan during the IDEAS 2008 convention that: \"The commercial contract has been finalised up to 95 per cent.\"\n\nIt was reported that the first Type 214 diesel-electric submarine would be delivered to the Pakistan Navy in 64 months after signing of the contract while the rest would be completed successively in 12 months. After wavering for over two years, Pakistan dropped out from this deal when successfully negotiating with China to develop and design Eight Type 039A submarine that features the AIP technology with a complete transfer of technology to be built in Pakistan.\n\n\n"}

Reed followed many of the prominent Bolshevik leaders closely during his time in Russia. John Reed died in 1920, shortly after the book was finished, and he is one of the few Americans buried at the Kremlin Wall Necropolis in Moscow, a site normally reserved only for the most prominent Soviet leaders.\n\nJohn Reed was on an assignment for \"The Masses\", a magazine of socialist politics, when he was reporting the Russian Revolution. Although Reed states that he had \"tried to see events with the eye of a conscientious reporter, interested in setting down the truth\" during the time of the event, he stated in the preface that \"in the struggle my sympathies were not neutral\" (since the book primarily shares the perspective of the Russian working class).\n\nBefore John Reed left for Russia, the Espionage Act was passed on June 15, 1917, which fined and imprisoned anyone who interfered with the recruiting of soldiers and prohibited the mailing of any newspaper or magazine that promoted such sentiments. The U. S. Post Office was also given leave to deny any mailing that fitted these standards from further postal delivery, and then to disqualify a magazine because it had missed a mailing (due to the ban) and hence was no longer considered a \"regular publication.\" Because of this, \"The Masses\" was forced by the United States federal government to cease publication in the fall of 1917, after refusing to change the magazine's policy against the war. \"The Liberator\", founded by Max Eastman under his and his sister's private control, published Reed's articles concerning the Russian Revolution instead. In an effort to ensure the magazine's survival, Eastman compromised and tempered its views accordingly.\n\nUpon returning from Russia during April 1918 from Kristiania in Norway, after being barred from either traveling to the United States or returning to Russia since February 23 by the State Department, Reed's trunk of notes and materials on the revolution—which included Russian handbills, newspapers, and speeches—were seized by custom officials, who interrogated him for four hours over his activities in Russia during the previous eight months. Michael Gold, an eyewitness to Reed's arrival to Manhattan, recalls how \"a swarm of Department of Justice men stripped him, went over every inch of his clothes and baggage, and put him through the usual inquisition. Reed had been sick with ptomaine on the boat. The inquisition had also been painful.\" Back home during mid-summer 1918, Reed, worried that \"his vivid impressions on the revolution would fade,\" fought hard to regain his papers from the possession of the government, who refused to return them.\n\nReed would not receive his materials until seven months later in November. Max Eastman recalls a meeting with John Reed in the middle of Sheridan Square during the period of time when Reed isolated himself writing the book:\n\n\"Ten Days That Shook the World\" has received mixed responses since its publication in 1919, resulting in a wide range of critical reviews from negative to positive. However, the book was overall positively received by critics at the time of its first publication, despite some critics’ vocal opposition to Reed’s political beliefs.\n\nGeorge F. Kennan, an American diplomat and historian who has a strong bias against Bolshevism and is best known as “the father of containment,” praised the book: “Reed’s account of the events of that time rises above every other contemporary record for its literary power, its penetration, its command of detail” and would be “remembered when all others are forgotten.” Kennan saw it as “a reflection of blazing honesty and a purity of idealism that did unintended credit to the American society that produced him, the merits of which he himself understood so poorly.” On March 1, 1999, \"The New York Times\" reported New York University’s “Top 100 Works of Journalism” list, which placed \"Ten Days that Shook the World\" in seventh position. Project director Mitchell Stephens explains the reasoning behind the judges’ decision:\n\nBut not all responses were positive. Joseph Stalin argued in 1924 that Reed was misleading in regards to Leon Trotsky. The book portrays Trotsky (head of the Red Army) as a man who co-led the revolution with Lenin and mentions Stalin only twice—one of them being only in the recitation of a list of names. Russian writer Anatoly Rybakov elaborates on Stalinist Soviet Union’s ban on \"Ten Days that Shook the World\": “The main task was to build a mighty socialist state. For that, mighty power was needed. Stalin was at the head of that power, which mean that he stood at its source with Lenin. Together with Lenin he led the October Revolution. John Reed had presented the history of October differently. That wasn’t the John Reed we needed.” After Stalin’s death, the book was allowed to recirculate.\n\nAfter its first publication, Reed returned to Russia in the fall of 1919, delighted to learn that Vladimir Lenin had taken time to read the book. Furthermore, Lenin agreed to write an introduction that first appeared in the 1922 edition published by Boni & Liveright (New York):\n\nIn his introduction to \"Animal Farm\" entitled \"Freedom of the Press\" (1945), George Orwell claims that the British Communist Party published a version omitting Lenin's introduction and mention of Trotsky:\n\nIn the book Reed refers several times to a planned sequel, \"Kornilov to Brest-Litovsk,\" which was never finished.\n\nIn 1928, Sergei Eisenstein filmed the book as \"\".\n\nIn 1967, Granada Television presented a feature-length version of the events narrated and essentially (like the Eisenstein work) a new work with the same title by Orson Welles.\n\nJohn Reed's own exploits and parts of the book itself were the basis of the 1981 Warren Beatty film \"Reds\".\n\nIn 1982, the Soviet film maker Sergei Bondarchuk used the book as the basis of his film \"Red Bells\" (its alternative title is \"Ten Days that Shook the World\").\n\nAt one point in the 1946 film \"Blood on the Sun\" socialist/communist screenwriter Lester Cole has one of two characters, played by James Cagney and Sylvia Sydney who are planning on spending ten days together, utter the line, ”Ten days that shook the world.”\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1882142", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1882142", "title": "June Uprising in Lithuania", "text": "June Uprising in Lithuania\n\nThe June Uprising () was a brief period in the history of Lithuania between the first Soviet occupation and the Nazi occupation in late June 1941. Approximately one year earlier, on June 15, 1940, the Red Army invaded Lithuania and the unpopular Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic was soon established. Political repression and terror were used to silence its critics and suppress any resistance. When Nazi Germany attacked the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941, a diverse segment of the Lithuanian population rose up against the Soviet regime, declared renewed independence, and formed the short-lived Provisional Government. Two large Lithuanian cities, Kaunas and Vilnius, fell into the hands of the rebels before the arrival of the Wehrmacht. Within a week, the German Army took control of the whole of Lithuania. The Lithuanians greeted the Germans as liberators from the repressive Soviet rule and hoped that the Germans would re-establish their independence or at least allow some degree of autonomy (similar to the Slovak Republic). No such support came from the Nazis, who steadily replaced Lithuanian institutions with their own administration. The Reichskommissariat Ostland was established at the end of July 1941. Deprived of any real power, the Provisional Government disbanded itself on August 5.\n\nIn 1918, Lithuania achieved independence in the aftermath of the First World War and the Russian revolution and secured its statehood during the Lithuanian Wars of Independence. Initially prior to World War II, Lithuania declared neutrality and its Seimas passed the neutrality laws. Though, on the eve of World War II, as the geopolitical situation in the region started to change, Lithuania was forced to accept the ultimatums of the neighboring countries. On 17 March 1938, Poland delivered an ultimatum calling for diplomatic relations. Although practically it meant Poland's \"refusal\" of Vilnius, Lithuania had also sought to restore relations with its neighbor, and accepted the ultimatum. On 20 March 1939, Lithuania was handed an ultimatum by Nazi Germany. A request was made to transfer the Klaipėda Region to Nazi Germany. Two days later, without seeing the way out, the Lithuanian government signed the agreement.\n\nJust after the beginning of the World War II, on September 2, 1939, the Lithuanian Consulate was opened in Vilnius. The consulate was the first in the world to grant Visas For Life for the Jews and also saved many Polish war refugees. By doing so, Lithuania continued to actively protect its Jewish citizens from the Holocaust. Back in 1934 it sent an official note to Nazi Germany warning not to take action against the Jews who resided in the country that were citizens of Lithuania.\n\nAnother large neighbor — the Soviet Union also began preparing for the occupation of the Lithuania's territory. On 7 October 1939 the Lithuanian delegation departed to Moscow where they later had to sign the Soviet–Lithuanian Mutual Assistance Treaty due to the unfavorable situation. The treaty resulted in five Soviet military bases with 20,000 troops established across Lithuania in exchange for the Lithuania's historical capital Vilnius. According to the Lithuanian Minister of National Defence Kazys Musteikis, Lithuanian Minister of Foreign Affairs Juozas Urbšys initially told that Lithuanians refuses Vilnius Region as well as the Russian garrisons, however then nervous Joseph Stalin replied that \"No matter if you take Vilnius or not, the Russian garrisons will enter Lithuania anyway\". He also informed Juozas Urbšys about the Soviet–German secret protocols and showed maps of the spheres of influence. Two of the military bases with thousands of Soviet soldiers were established close to Kaunas in Prienai and Gaižiūnai. Despite regaining the beloved historical capital, the Presidency and the Government remained in Kaunas.\n\nThe next step made by the USSR was accusations of the abduction of the Red Army soldiers in Lithuania. Although the Lithuanian government denied such allegations, the tensions became heightened on both sides. On 14 June 1940, the USSR issued an ultimatum to Lithuania, demanding to replace the government and allow Red Army's units to enter the territory of Lithuania without any prior agreements, which would mean the occupation of the country. On 14 June 1940 just before midnight, the last meeting of the Lithuanian Government was held in the Presidential Palace, in Kaunas. During it, the Soviet's ultimatum was debated. President Antanas Smetona categorically declined to accept most of the ultimatum demands, argued for military resistance and was supported by Kazys Musteikis, , , however the Commander of the Armed Forces Vincas Vitkauskas, Divisional general Stasys Raštikis, Kazys Bizauskas, Antanas Merkys and most of the Lithuanian Government members decided that it would be impossible, especially due to the previously stationed Soviet soldiers, and accepted the ultimatum. On that night, the Soviet forces executed Lithuanian border guard near the Byelorussian SSR border. In the morning, the Lithuanian Government resigned while the president left the country to avoid the fate of the Soviet's puppet and hoping to form the Government in exile. Soon the Red Army flooded Lithuania through the Belarus–Lithuania border with more than 200,000 soldiers and took control of the most important cities, including Kaunas where the heads of state resided. The Lithuanian Armed Forces were ordered not to resist and the Lithuanian Air Force remained on the ground. At the time, the Lithuanian Armed Forces had 26,084 soldiers (of which 1,728 officers) and 2,031 civil servants. While the Lithuanian Riflemen's Union, subordinate to the army commander, had over 62,000 members of which about 70% were farmers and agricultural workers.\n\nAfter the occupation, the Soviets had immediately taken brutal actions against the high-ranking officials of the state. Both targets of the ultimatum: the Minister of the Interior Kazys Skučas and the Director of the State Security Department of Lithuania Augustinas Povilaitis were transported to Moscow and later executed. Antanas Gustaitis, Kazys Bizauskas, Vytautas Petrulis, , , also faced the fate of execution, while President Aleksandras Stulginskis, Juozas Urbšys, Leonas Bistras, Antanas Merkys, Pranas Dovydaitis, Petras Klimas, Donatas Malinauskas and thousands of others were deported. Stasys Raštikis, persuaded by his wife, secretly crossed the German border. After realizing it, NKVD started terror against Raštikis' family. His wife was separated from their 1-year-old daughter and brutally interrogated at Kaunas Prison, and his father Bernardas Raštikis, three daughters, two brothers and sister were deported to Siberia. Soldiers, officers, senior officers and generals of the Lithuanian Army and LRU members, who were seen as a threat to the occupants, were quickly arrested, interrogated and released to the reserve, deported to the concentration camps or executed, trying to avoid this many joined the Lithuanian partisans forces. The army itself was firstly renamed to the Lithuanian People's Army, however later it was reorganized to the 29th Rifle Corps of the Soviet Union.\n\nSovietization was started right away. New power banned opposition, its press, and organizations and also restricted ties with foreign countries. Shortly, on 17 June 1940 the puppet People's Government of Lithuania was formed, which consistently destroyed Lithuanian society, political institutions and opened the way for the Communist Party to establish itself. In order to establish the legitimacy of the government and design the plans of Lithuania's \"legal accession to the USSR\", on July 1, the Seimas of Lithuania was released and the forced elections with falsified results to the People's Seimas were organized, which were won by the Lithuanian Labor People's Union and Justas Paleckis was chosen as the illegal Prime Minister and President of Lithuania. The new government obeyed the occupiers' proposal to \"ask\" the Soviet authorities to have Lithuania admitted to the Soviet Union. The Lithuanian nation was unable to resist the implementation of Sovietization, including nationalization, nor prevent the mass arrests of political activists and others dubbed \"enemies of the people\". Nor could they prevent the closing of all cultural, religious and political organizations. The economic situation steadily worsened and the standard of living decreased. A year later, just a week before the uprising, some 17,000 Lithuanians, mainly the intelligentsia, were taken with their entire families and deported to Siberia, where many perished due to inhumane living conditions (see the June deportation). It was the single major event that incited popular support for the uprising. That tragedy initially also garnered a positive predisposition toward the German invasion. People who escaped the deportations or arrests spontaneously organized themselves into armed groups, hid in the forests, and waited for a wider uprising.\n\nThe ultimate goal of the Lithuanian Activist Front (LAF), formed in the fall of 1940, was to re-establish Lithuania's independence. Commanded by Kazys Škirpa in Berlin, the LAF sought to unify Lithuanian resistance, and organize and conserve resources for the planned uprising against the Soviets. It acted as an umbrella organization and many groups used the name of LAF even though they were not connected with the LAF in Berlin. The LAF established its military–political headquarters in Vilnius and organizational headquarters in Kaunas. The communication and coordination between these centers in Berlin, Kaunas, and Vilnius was rather poor. The headquarters in Vilnius suffered heavily from Soviet arrests, especially in early June 1941, and became largely defunct. Most of those arrested activists were executed in December 1941, in Russia.\n\nIn March 1941, the LAF in Berlin published a memorandum, titled \"Brangūs vergaujantieji broliai\" (Dear Enslaved Brothers), with instructions on how to prepare for the war between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. The rebels were asked to secure strategic objects (prisons, railroads, bridges, communication hubs, factories, etc.), guarding them from potential sabotage by the retreating Red Army, while Central Headquarters would organize a Provisional Government and declare independence. In April, a list of the members of the Provisional Government, which would declare Lithuanian independence, was compiled. The Prime Minister's post was reserved for Škirpa, four ministers were from Vilnius, six from Kaunas, and one from Berlin. The members represented a wide spectrum of pre-war political parties and, as such, claimed to represent a majority of the Lithuanian people. It has been suggested that not all of the designated Ministers knew about their proposed appointments in the Provisional Government. On June 14, the Nazi authorities in Berlin insisted that Škirpa and his activists not form any government or make any public declarations without their prior approval. Škirpa agreed to this, but he had very little control over the activists in Lithuania itself.\n\nAt 3:15 am on June 22, the territory of the Lithuanian SSR was invaded by two advancing German army groups: Army Group North, which took over western and northern Lithuania, and Army Group Centre, which took over most of the Vilnius Region. The Germans amassed some 40 divisions, 700,000 troops, 1,500 tanks, and 1,200 airplanes for the attack on the Lithuanian SSR. The Soviets had about 25 divisions, 400,000 troops, 1,500 tanks, and 1,344 airplanes in the Baltic Military District. 7 rifle and 6 motorized divisions from the 8th and 11th Armies were located within the Lithuanian territory.\n\nThe first attacks were carried out by Luftwaffe against airports, airfields, and Lithuanian cities (Kėdainiai, Raseiniai, Karmėlava, Panevėžys, Jurbarkas, Ukmergė, Šiauliai, and others). These attacks claimed the lives of some 4,000 civilians. Most of the Soviet aircraft were destroyed on the ground (322 airplanes were lost in air versus 1,489 destroyed on ground). The Germans rapidly advanced forward encountering only sporadic resistance from the Soviets near Kaltinėnai, Raseiniai, Šiauliai and assistance from the Lithuanians. In the Battle of Raseiniai, the Soviets attempted to mount a counterattack, reinforced by tanks, but suffered heavy losses. Within a week, the Germans sustained 3,362 casualties, but controlled the entirety of Lithuania. Soviet losses were heavy and not known precisely; the estimates put them at 12–15 divisions. The Red Army also lost numerous aircraft, tanks, artillery, and other equipment.\n\nDespite the generally friendly Lithuanian attitude, the Germans carried out several punitive executions. For example, 42 civilians from Ablinga village were murdered in response to German deaths. After two German guards in Alytus were shot by unknown perpetrators, the Nazis shot 42 Lithuanian rebels. The terror in Alytus continued to the next day: the Germans selected men, age 15–50, and executed them in groups of 20–25. More atrocities were carried out by the retreating Red Army. About 4,000 political and criminal prisoners, arrested during the first Soviet occupation, were to be transported to Russia. NKVD organized prisoner massacres in Rainiai, Pravieniškės, Panevėžys. A total of 40 locations of mass killings have been identified in Lithuania. Many others were killed en route to Soviet prisons. The largest such massacre took place near Chervyen in present-day Belarus. A list of NKVD victims in Lithuania, compiled during the Nazi occupation, includes 769 people that did not participate in the uprising.\n\nAfter the occupation, the Lithuanian Diplomatic Service did not recognized the new occupants authority and started the diplomatic liberation campaign of Lithuania. In 1941, Kazys Škirpa, Leonas Prapuolenis, Juozas Ambrazevičius and their supporters, including the former Commander of the Lithuanian Army General Stasys Raštikis, whose wife was separated from their 1-year-old daughter and brutally interrogated by the Soviets at Kaunas Prison, and his father Bernardas Raštikis, three daughters, two brothers and sister were deported to Siberia, began organizing an uprising.\n\nThe uprising began in early morning of June 22, 1941, the first day of the war. The main forces of the LAF were concentrated in Kaunas. At 10 am LAF held a meeting in Žaliakalnis, dividing the responsibilities. It was decided that the main goal is not to fight with the Russians, but to secure the city from inside (secure organizations, institutions, enterprises) and declare independence. By the evening of June 22, the Lithuanians controlled the Presidential Palace, post office, telephone and telegraph, radio station and radiophone. Control of the telephone allowed Lithuanians to disconnect all known communist numbers and talk to each other without passwords or codes. The radio station was sabotaged by the Russians, therefore repair works were carried out during the night from June 22 to 23. Spare parts were delivered by medical students, driving an ambulance. Despite fears of inadequate Lithuanian forces guarding the radio, in the morning of June 23, Leonas Prapuolenis read the declaration of Lithuanian independence and the list of members of the Provisional Government. The broadcast was repeated several times in Lithuanian, German, and French. At 9:28 AM \"Tautiška giesmė\", the national anthem of Lithuania, was played on the radio in Kaunas. Many people listened to the Lithuanian national anthem then with tears in their eyes. Multiple Red Army divisions stationed in the Lithuania's territory, including the brutal 1st Motor Rifle Division NKVD responsible for the June deportation, and the marionette Lithuanian SSR regime commanders were forced to flee into the Latvian SSR through the Daugava river. Commander of the Red Army's 188th Rifle Division colonel Piotr Ivanov reported to the 11th Army Staff that during the retreat of his division through Kaunas \"local counterrevolutionaries from the shelters purposefully and severely fired to the Red Army, the flocks suffered heavy losses of soldiers and military equipment\".\n\nIn the morning of June 23, 1941, the rebels raided a Soviet armory in Šančiai, Panemunė, and Vilijampolė. Now armed, Lithuanians spread throughout the city. The Vilijampolė Bridge across the Neris River received special attention from the rebels as they expected the Germans to enter the city using this bridge. When the Lithuanians got to the bridge, it was already wired with explosives. 40 Soviet troops and three armored vehicles protected the bridge and waited for the right moment to detonate. When the Soviets retreated a bit after facing Lithuanian fire, Juozas Savulionis ran to the middle of the bridge, cut the wires, and thus saved it from destruction. On his way back Savulionis was shot and killed by Soviet fire, becoming one of the first victims of the uprising.\n\nThe bridges across the Neman River were prematurely destroyed by the retreating Soviets. This forced units of the Red Army in Suvalkija to bypass Kaunas and possibly saved the rebels in the city. The Metalas Factory became the headquarters of the Šančiai rebels, who attempted to stop Russian soldiers from crossing the Neman River by boats or building a pontoon bridge. During these fights about 100 rebels were killed, 100 Soviet troops (including several officers) were taken prisoner, and a large booty of equipment (including three tanks but no one knew how to operate them) was captured. Other groups secured police stations, shops, warehouses, attempted to re-establish general order in the city. The rebels hastily organized their own police and freed some 2,000 political prisoners. They also organized publication of daily \"Į laisvę\" (Towards Freedom).\n\nOn June 24, 1941, tank units of the Red Army in Jonava were ordered to retake Kaunas. The rebels radioed the Germans for assistance. The units were bombed by Luftwaffe and did not reach the city. It was the first coordinated Lithuanian–German action. The first German scouts, lieutenant Flohret and four privates, entered Kaunas on June 24 and found it in friendly hands. A day later the main forces marched into the city without obstruction and almost in a parade fashion. On June 26, German military command ordered to disband and disarm the rebel groups. Two days later Lithuanian guards and patrols were also relieved of their duties.\n\nAccording to self-registration in July, there were about 6,000 rebels, spontaneously organized into 26 groups in Kaunas. The largest groups numbered 200–250 men. Total Lithuanian casualties in Kaunas are estimated at 200 dead and 150 wounded.\n\nIn Vilnius, LAF had been dismantled by Soviet arrests just before the war and Lithuanians formed only a small minority of the city's population. Therefore, the uprising was smaller in scale and started on June 23. The rebels took over the post office, radio station, and other institutions, and hoisted the Lithuanian flag over the Gediminas' Tower. It was relatively easy to take control of Vilnius as most units of the Red Army were located outside the city and retreated rather quickly. The first German units entered the city on June 24. The 7th Panzer Division, commanded by Hans Freiherr von Funck, expected that the Red Army would resist in Vilnius and made plans to bombard the city.\n\nThere were about 7,000–8,000 of ethnic Lithuanians in the 29th Rifle Corps, formed after the dissolution of the Lithuanian Army in 1940. Majority of them deserted and started gathering in Vilnius from June 24. The 184th Rifle Division, dislocated near Varėna, was one of the first to face the advancing Germans. Taking advantage of chaos among the Russian officers, Lithuanians managed to separate from the main corps with only few losses and gathered in Vilnius. Only 745 soldiers of the 184th Rifle Division reached Russia. The 179th Rifle Division was ordered to retreat from Pabradė–Švenčionėliai towards Pskov. On June 27, the division crossed the Lithuanian border and Lithuanian soldiers mutinied. At least 120 Lithuanians were killed in various shoot outs while attempting to desert. About 1,500 to 2,000 soldiers (out of 6,000) of the 179th Rifle Division reached Nevel. Lithuanians hoped that these deserters would form the core of the new Lithuanian Army; however, the troops were organized into Police Battalions and employed by the Germans for their needs, including perpetration of the Holocaust.\n\nThe uprising spread to other cities, towns, and villages. Level of the rebel activities varied greatly across Lithuania and the uprising was less organized, more spontaneous and chaotic. Men joined the uprising even though they never heard of the LAF or organized resistance in Kaunas. In most areas the rebels followed the pattern set in Kaunas and Vilnius: take control of local institutions (most importantly, the police) and secure other strategic objects. The rebels also arrested Soviet activists, freed political prisoners, and hoisted the Lithuanian flags. Lack of guns and ammunition was felt almost everywhere; the main way to obtain guns was to disarm surrendered Soviet troops. Most active rebels were in the districts of Švenčionys, Mažeikiai, Panevėžys, and Utena. In some areas, like Šiauliai, there were no noticeable rebel activities. Once Germans entered a settlement they would disarm the rebels. However, some local institutions (police, various committees) \"de facto\" established by the rebels were later legalized \"de jure\".\n\nDuring the Soviet era, the rebels were persecuted and the uprising was censored out of the history books. Memoirs and studies published mainly by Lithuanian-Americans inflated the total number of the Lithuanians activists to 90,000 or 113,000 and casualties to 2,000 or 6,000. After Lithuania regained independence in 1990 and new documents became available, historians have revised the estimates to 16,000–20,000 active participants and 600 casualties. Most of the rebels were young men, between 18 and 25 years old. Soviet losses are estimated at 5,000 men.\n\nOn June 23, 1941 at 9:28 AM \"Tautiška giesmė\", the national anthem of Lithuania, was played on the radio in Kaunas. Many people listened to the Lithuanian national anthem then with tears in their eyes. LAF member Leonas Prapuolenis read independence declaration \"Atstatoma laisva Lietuva\" (Free Lithuania is Restored) – \"Young Lithuania with enthusiasm promises to add up to the Europe organization on the new bases. Lithuanian nation horribly tortured by bolshevik's terror braces creating its future on the ethnic unity and social justice\". Prapuolenis announced the members of the Provisional Government and also asked the people to guard public and private property, the workers to organize protection of factories, public institutions, and other important objects, and policemen to patrol their territories preserving the general public order. The message was repeated several times in Lithuanian, German, and French.\n\nThe first meeting of the Provisional Government took place on June 24. LAF activist Juozas Ambrazevičius replaced Kazys Škirpa, who was under house arrest in Berlin, as the Prime Minister. The new government attempted to take full control of the country, establish the proclaimed independence, and start a de-sovietization campaign. During its six-week existence over 100 laws, some prepared in advance, were issued, dealing with de-nationalization of land, enterprises, and real estate, restoration of local administrative units, formation of police, and other issues. The government did not have power in the Vilnius Region, under control of a different army group. Hoping to survive the government cooperated fully with the Nazi authorities.\n\nThe Provisional Government of Lithuania strongly opposed the Holocaust carried out by the Nazis and its main goal was to protect the citizens and declare the Independence of Lithuania. It also tried to rescue the situation and protest, the meant Lithuanian Minister of National Defence General Stasys Raštikis (former Commander of the Lithuanian Army) even met personally with the Nazi Germany Generals to discuss the situation. He approached the Kaunas War Field Commandant General Oswald Pohl and the Military Command Representative General Karl von Roques by trying to plead the Jews, however they replied that the Gestapo is handling these issues and that they cannot help. Furthermore, in the beginning of the occupation, Prime Minister of the Provisional Government of Lithuania Juozas Ambrazevičius convened the meeting in which the ministers participated together with the former President Kazys Grinius, Bishop Vincentas Brizgys and others. During the meeting, the Nazis were condemned for their actions with Jews and it was decided to help them. Although, the participants of the meeting understood that the help will be very limited, because already in the beginning of the Nazi occupation it was announced that the Jews are crossed out from the competence of Lithuanian institutions.\n\nThe Germans did not recognize the new government, but also did not take any actions to dissolve it by force (unlike the government of Stepan Bandera in Ukraine). At first German military administration tolerated activities of the government as it did not attempt to take control of civilian institutions. The Reichskommissariat Ostland, German Civil Administration (\"Zivilverwaltung\") was established on July 17. Instead of using brute force, the Civil Administration slowly removed the government's powers (for example, did not allow to print its decrees in newspapers or broadcast radio announcements) and supplanted its institutions, forcing the Provisional Government to either self-disband or to become a puppet institution. Willing to cooperate if that meant recognition and some semblance to autonomy, the government did not agree to become an instrument of German occupation. The government self-disbanded on August 5 after signing a protest for the Germans actions of suspending the Lithuanian government powers. Members of the Provisional Government then \"in corpore\" went to the Garden of the Vytautas the Great War Museum, where they laid wreath near the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in the presence of a numerous audience. Sicherheitsdienst confiscated the pictures of the wreath-laying ceremony, thinking that it could be dangerous for the German occupation policy in Lithuania.\n\nUsurpation of the public life continued after the demise of the Provisional Government. The Lithuanian Activist Front was banned in September 1941 and some of its leaders transported to concentration camps. In December the last legal party of Lithuania, pro-Nazi Lithuanian Nationalist Party, was also banned. Most of the laws adopted by the Provisional Government remained paper declarations. However a couple laws that concerned items of no immediate interest of the Germans, including local administration and education, had somewhat lasting effect. The government left developed local administration, staffed with Lithuanians. That allowed some passive resistance when German orders from top could be blocked by the bottom. For example, Lithuanians resisted recruitment to a Waffen-SS division, quotas for forced labor in Germany, or Germanization of Lithuanian schools.\n\nDespite the failure to establish independence and meager long-term results, the uprising was an important event. As Kazys Škirpa summarized in his memoirs, the uprising demonstrated the determination of the Lithuanian people to have their own independent state and dispelled the myth that Lithuania joined the Soviet Union voluntarily in June 1940. The uprising also contributed to unusually rapid German advances against Russia: Pskov was reached in 17 days. The events of June 1941 also caused some controversies. At the time, Lithuanian diplomats abroad, including former president Antanas Smetona and Stasys Lozoraitis, described the uprising as \"Nazi-inspired\". These statements might have been in an attempt to persuade United States, Great Britain, and other western powers that Lithuania was not an ally of the Nazis. Its military unit, the Tautinio Darbo Apsaugos Batalionas, was soon employed by the Einsatzkommando and Rollkommando Hamann in the mass executions of Lithuanian Jews in the Seventh fort of the Kaunas Fortress and in the provinces. Jewish survivors and authors accuse members of the LAF, especially in Kaunas but also in other towns, of indiscriminate and gruesome excesses against Jewish residents, often before the Nazis arrived to take control, most notably characterized by the Kaunas pogrom.\n\nIn 1973, the Committee of the United States Congress made unambiguous conclusions that there is no Prime Minister Juozas Ambrazevičius' guilty in the Holocaust in Lithuania. It is also known that in the summer of 1944 Ambrazevičius left for Germany, and in 1948 for the United States, where he edited a Catholic daily, \"Darbininkas\", and continued his work in the Supreme Committee for the Liberation of Lithuania in exile. He published a number of leaflets illustrating German and Soviet crimes in Lithuania and the Lithuanian resistance, for example, \"In the Name of the Lithuanian People\" (1946) and \"Appeal to the United Nations on Genocide\" (1951). In 1964 he published a book \"Alone, all alone\" about the Lithuanian armed resistance. The Kremlin actively opposed his activities. In the 1970s he became a subject of interest for the Soviet media and American hunters of Nazi colloborators, who accused him of having worked for the Third Reich. In reply, he published an extensive dossier of his World War II activities.\n\nDuring the 2012 reburial ceremony of the Juozas Ambrazevičius remains in Kaunas, adviser to Lithuanian Prime Minister Andrius Kubilius also noted that a 1975 investigation by US Immigration found no evidence of Brazaitis being involved in anti-Semitic or pro-Nazi activities.\n\nNotes:\nReferences:\n"}

Her hit songs included \"Sakta vi gå genom stan\" (Swedish cover of \"Walking My Baby Back Home\"; in Swedish a tribute to Stockholm town), \"Visa från Utanmyra\", \"Sista jäntan\", \"Trubbel\", \"Gröna små äpplen\" (\"Little Green Apples\"), \"Monicas vals\" (\"Waltz for Debby\"), \"Stick iväg, Jack!\" (\"Hit the Road Jack\"), \"Att angöra en brygga\", \"Var blev ni av\", \"Måne över Stureplan\" (cover of Sting's \"Moon Over Bourbon Street\") and \"Under vinrankan!\", among many, many others.\n\nShe also interpreted the works of such Swedish singer-songwriters as Evert Taube, Olle Adolphson and Povel Ramel, as well as international jazz musicians/songwriters. She worked with some of the greatest international jazz names including Louis Armstrong, Bill Evans, Stan Getz, Steve Kuhn and Quincy Jones, and in the Scandinavian jazz world with people like Georg Riedel, Egil Johansen, Arne Domnérus, Svend Asmussen and Jan Johansson.\n\nIn 1964, she recorded the critically acclaimed jazz album \"Waltz for Debby\" with Bill Evans, a record she herself described as \"the best I've done\" and was the most proud of. Her professional skill was amply demonstrated in this album in performing the challenging Harold Arlen song, \"So Long, Big Time\". \n\nHer long career also included the song \"En gång i Stockholm\" (\"Winter City\"); a jazz ballad with which she represented Sweden in the 1963 Eurovision Song Contest. She finished last, however (mainly because the song genre was not suitable for the competition) and scored the infamous \"nul points\", but still managed to remain successful in Sweden. Her collaboration with the comic duo Hasse & Tage (in the 1960s and 1970s) eventually led to a stage career in revues and films. Memorable are her parts in the films \"Att angöra en brygga\" and \"Äppelkriget\", with her most memorable role being in Jan Troell's \"Utvandrarna\" (aka \"The Emigrants\"; with Liv Ullmann and Max von Sydow in the leads) as Ulrika, a former prostitute who together with her teenage daughter Elin (portrayed by Zetterlund's daughter, Eva Lena Zetterlund) join the main characters in their emigration to America in the 1850s, a role for which Zetterlund received a Guldbagge Award for Best Supporting Actress. She appeared in more than 20 films and television series throughout her life.\n\nShe suffered from severe scoliosis which began after a childhood accident, and as a result was forced to retire from performing in 1999.\n\nOn 12 May 2005, she died following an accidental fire in her apartment in Stockholm, probably due to her habit of smoking in bed.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He served as the head basketball coach at the United States Merchant Marine Academy from 1945 to 1948, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) from 1948 to 1953, the University of Cincinnati from 1960 to 1965, and Rollins College from 1972 to 1977, compiling a career college basketball coaching record of 270–122. He led the Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball program to consecutive national titles, winning the NCAA Basketball Tournament in 1961 and 1962. Jucker was also the head coach of the Cincinnati Bearcats baseball team from 1954 to 1960 while serving as an assistant coach for the basketball team. He spent two seasons coaching in the professional ranks, leading the Cincinnati Royals of the National Basketball Association (NBA) from 1967 to 1969. Jucker served as the athletic director at Rollins College from 1981 to 1983.\n\nJucker was born in Norwood, Ohio. He attended the University of Cincinnati as an undergraduate student and played on the school's basketball teams during the 1938, 1939, and 1940 seasons. He was the captain of the 1940 team. Also, while an undergraduate, Jucker became a member of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity.\n\nJucker was a professional baseball prospect until he decided to start coaching instead of trying to make it into Major League Baseball. His coaching career began at Batavia High in Clermont County, Ohio, east of Cincinnati. Following service in the Navy during World War II, he joined the college coaching ranks as assistant basketball coach at the United States Merchant Marine Academy in 1946. Two years later, he became head basketball coach at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.\n\nJucker returned to the University of Cincinnati in 1953 as assistant basketball coach and baseball mentor. He directed the UC freshmen to a 67–21 record in six years, while his baseball teams were 87–38 over seven seasons. In 1954, Jucker recruited Sandy Koufax at Cincinnati. After watching Koufax in his first practice, Jucker got him a work-study scholarship.\n\nUnder Jucker's coaching direction in the early 60s, Cincinnati won back-to-back NCAA Basketball Tournament, in 1961 and 1962, defeating Ohio State, who had the great Jerry Lucas and Bob Knight, both years. His 1963 team reached the championship game of the NCAA tournament, where the Bearcats were upended 60–58 in overtime by Loyola of Chicago and All-American Jerry Harkness. Jucker holds the record for the highest winning percentage (.917) in NCAA tournament play. In his five seasons coaching the Bearcats, Jucker's team posted a record of 113–28, a .801 winning percentage.\n\nJucker left coaching at UC after the 1965 season. In 1966 he remained at the university as the Intramural Director and spent the summer in Spain coaching their national team. He agreed to coach Spanish national team from 1967 but changed his mind when he received offers from the National Basketball Association (NBA). In 1967, he became the head coach of the Cincinnati Royals of the National Basketball Association, a position he held for two seasons. Jucker then went to Rollins College in Winter Park, Florida where he built the school's basketball program into a national contender in NCAA Division II.\n\nIn 1978, he was inducted into the University of Cincinnati Athletics Hall of Fame. Also, the court that the University of Cincinnati plays on is named after Jucker. The number he wore as Cincinnati baseball coach is one of only two numbers retired by the school's baseball team.\n\nJucker died of prostate cancer on Callawassie Island, South Carolina in 2002 at age 85.

{"id": "1882151", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1882151", "title": "Health in Uganda", "text": "Health in Uganda\n\nHealth in Uganda refers to the health of the population of Uganda. As of 2013, life expectancy at birth in Uganda was 58 years, which was lower than in any other country in the East African Community except Burundi. As of 2015, the probability of a child dying before reaching age five was 5.5 percent (55 deaths for every 1000 live births). Total health expenditure as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) was 7.2 percent in 2014.\n\nIn 2018, an estimated 1.4 million people in Uganda were infected with HIV, and the HIV prevalence rate in the country was 5.7 percent.\n\nUganda was the most physically active nation in the world in 2018 according to the World Health Organization. Only 5.5% of Ugandans do not achieve 150 minutes of moderate-to-intense or 75 minutes of rigorous activity per week. Most work is still very physical, and commuting by vehicle is beyond the reach of most of the population. Kampala, however, is not friendly towards walking or cycling, and the air is very polluted. The Kampala Capital City Authority established the country's first cycle lane—500 metres in Kololo—in 2018.\n\nAs of 2016, the five leading causes of death in Uganda included communicable diseases such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, respiratory tract infections, and diarrheal diseases. The risk factors most responsible for death and disability include child and maternal malnutrition, unprotected sexual activity, multiple sex partners, contaminated water, poor sanitation, and air pollution.\n\nHIV treatment in Uganda has centered on human antiretroviral therapy through cross-training and increasing the scope of health workers who can administer treatment (e.g., community health workers and nurses). This shift in treatment occurred through the WHO's 2004 \"Integrated Management of Adult and Adolescent Illness\" guide. Studies of HIV-infected adults in Uganda showed risky sexual behavior to have declined, contributing to the decline in HIV incidence. From 1990 to 2004, HIV rates declined by 70 percent and casual sex declined by 60 percent. Health communication was also listed as a potential cause of inducing behavioral changes in the Ugandan population. According to a 2015 study, impediments to reducing HIV incidence include food insecurity in rural areas and stigma against HIV counseling and testing.\n\nUganda has the highest incidence rate of malaria in the world, with 478 people out of 1000 population being afflicted per year. According to WHO data published in May 2014, malaria accounted for 19,869 deaths in Uganda (6.19% of total deaths).\n\nIn 2002, the Ugandan government formalized the process of treating fevers through home-based care. Mothers who were able to better recognize symptoms of malaria took their children to a community medicine facility early in the illness. The Integrated Management of Childhood Illness allowed for better recognition of malaria's symptoms. Treatment either involved immediately taking the child to see a nearby healthcare worker or acquiring the treatment of chloroquine and SP, also known as Homapak, though kits have been found to be expired in some instances. However, resistance to HOMAPAK emerged, and drug recommendations by the WHO changed to artemisinin combination therapy (ACT). After the midterm review in 2014 of the national plan for malaria reduction and the malaria programme review in 2010, the national strategy to reduce malaria is being redesigned. Currently, Uganda is treating malaria through distribution of insecticide-treated nets, indoor spraying of insecticides, and preventative therapy for pregnant women. The disease burden of malaria, however, remains high and is further strengthened by inadequate resources, understanding of malaria, and increased resistance to drugs.\n\nReproductive health (RH) is a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being in all matters relating to the reproductive system and to its functions and processes. It implies that people have the capability to reproduce and the freedom to decide if, when, and how often to do so. Implicit in this is the right of men and women to be informed and to have access to safe, effective, affordable, and acceptable methods of family planning of their choice, as well as other methods of their choice for regulation of fertility, which are not against the law, and the right of access to health care services that will enable women to go safely through pregnancy and childbirth. RH care also includes sexual health, the purpose of which is the enhancement of life and personal relations.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) defines maternal health as the health of women during pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period. According to UNICEF, Uganda's maternal mortality ratio, the annual number of deaths of women from pregnancy-related causes per 100,000 live births, was 440 from 2008 to 2012. The Millennium Development Goal (MDG) for 2015 concerning the maternal mortality ratio was 131 per 100,000 births. The MDG also set a goal for all births to be attended by a skilled health professional,\n\nIn rural areas, conceiving pregnant women seek the help of traditional birth attendants (TBAs) because of the difficulty in accessing formal health services and high transportation or treatment costs. TBAs are trusted as they embody the cultural and social life of the community. The TBAs' lack of knowledge and training and the use of traditional practices, however, have led to risky medical procedures resulting in high maternal mortality rates. Those rates also persist because of an overall low use of contraceptives, the limited capacity of health facilities to manage abortion/miscarriage complications, and the prevalence of HIV/AIDS among pregnant women. Despite malaria being one of the leading causes of morbidity in pregnant women, prevention and prophylaxis services are not well established according to a 2013 published report.\n\nOnly 47 percent of Ugandan women receive the recommended four antenatal care visits, and only 42 percent of births are attended by skilled health personnel. Among the poorest 20 percent of the population, the share of births attended by skill health personnel was 29 percent in 2005/2006 compared to 77 percent among the wealthiest 20 percent of the population.. The Human Rights Measurement Initiative has given Uganda a score of 47.9% for contraceptive use.\n\nMalnutrition is a major development concern in Uganda, affecting all regions of the country and most segments of the population. The current levels of malnutrition hinder Uganda’s human, social, and economic development. Although the country has made tremendous progress in economic growth and poverty reduction over the past 20 years, its progress in reducing malnutrition remains very slow. The ultimate objective of the Uganda Nutrition Action Plan\n(UNAP) is to ensure that all Ugandans are properly nourished so they can live healthy and productive lives. However, it is at the start of life in particular that we must work together to ensure that all Ugandans are properly nourished.\nAccording to the three most recent Uganda Demographic Health Surveys (UDHS), nutrition indicators for young children and their mothers have not improved much over the past 15 years, with some indicators showing a worsening trend. For example, in 1995, 45 percent of children under five years old in Uganda were short for their age (stunted); 10 years later, the prevalence of stunted under-fives had fallen to only 39 percent (UDHS, 2006). Stunting indicates\nchronic malnutrition in children; the stunting prevalence rate of 39 percent means that about 2.3 million young children in Uganda today are chronically malnourished. UNICEF The Human Rights Measurement Initiative gives Uganda a score of 79.5% for stunted children.\n\nConsider the nutrition profile of Uganda for children under five years of age as per USAID\n\nThis has a huge burden on the country through lost income that directly affects the GDP where as much as 5.6% or US$899 million is lost annually. WFP\n\nDespite the worrying numbers, latest research shows that the numbers of children under five suffering from malnutrition are declining.\n\nDomestic violence (DV) is a key issue in reproductive health and rights. Most of the DV is gender-based. Physical violence is the most prevalent type of DV in Uganda, with one quarter of women reporting it. More than 60 percent of women who have ever been married have reported experiencing emotional, physical, or sexual violence from a spouse.\n\nIn 2011, about two percent of women reported to have undergone female genital mutilation, a practice that is dying away in the areas where it was more frequently practiced.\n\nNorthern Uganda is one of the four major administrative regions in Uganda. The region was devastated by a protracted civil war between the government of Uganda and the Lords Resistance Army as well as the cattle rustling conflict that lasted for 20 years.\n\nSince the war ended in 2006, the internally displaced person camps have been destroyed and people have resettled back to their former homesteads. The region, however, still has many health challenges, such as poor health care infrastructure and inadequate staffing at all levels (2008 published report); lack of access to the national electricity grid (2007 published report); an inability to attract and retain qualified staff; frequent stock outs in the hospitals and health facilities; emerging and re-emerging diseases such as Ebola, nodding syndrome, onchocerciasis, and tuberculosis; proneness to malaria epidemics, the leading cause of death in the country; reintegration of former abducted child soldiers who returned home (2007 study); lack of safe drinking water as most boreholes were destroyed during the war; the HIV/AIDS epidemic (2004 published report); poor education standards with high failure rates in primary and secondary school national examinations (2015 published report); and poverty (2013 published report).\n\nUganda has been hosting refugees and asylum seekers since achieving its independence in 1962. In fact, the 2016 United Nations Summit for Refugees declared Uganda’s refugee policy a model. The 2006 Refugee Act and 2010 Refugee Regulations allow for integration of refugees within host communities with refugees\nhaving access to the same public services as nationals. They have freedom of movement and are free to pursue livelihood opportunities, including access\nto the labour market and to establish businesses.\nUganda is currently hosting 1,252,470 refugees and asylum seekers making it the largest refugee hosting country in Africa and the third largest in the world (GoU and UNHCR, 2017) UNDP. This has placed a huge burden on the country that has a GDP per capita of just 710 dollars, yet the aid received per person is very small. \"Aid received per person against income\" \nCost disaggregated by sector\n\nThere are regular outbreaks of diseases such as cholera, ebola and marburg. 2017 Uganda Marburg virus outbreak. The policy of allowing refugees to freely move within the country increases the risk of spreading these outbreaks beyond refugee camp borders.\n\nAccording to the 2015 Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS) report:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1882153", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1882153", "title": "Amercement", "text": "Amercement\n\nAn amercement is a financial penalty in English law, common during the Middle Ages, imposed either by the court or by peers. The noun \"amercement\" lately derives from the verb to amerce, thus: the King amerces his subject, who offended some law. The term is of Anglo-Norman origin (Law French, from French, from Latin), and literally means \"being at the mercy of\": \"a-merce-ment\" (English \"mercy\" is cognate).\n\nWhile it is often synonymous with a fine, it differs in that a fine is a fixed sum prescribed by statute and was often voluntary, while an amercement is arbitrary. Amercements were commonly used as a punishment for minor offences (such as trespassing in the King's forest), as an alternative to imprisonment.\n\nThis system of amercements is found in working order as early as the Norman Conquest of 1066, but was still regarded as an innovation at the accession in 1100 of Henry I. As the number of entities having legal jurisdiction over a given location increased, the sums demanded from a wrong–doer who wished to buy himself back under protection of the law had become increasingly burdensome. He had to satisfy claims of the victim's family, of the victim's lord, of the lord within whose territory the crime had been committed, perhaps of the church whose sanctuary had been invaded, of other lords who could show an interest of any sort, and finally of the King as lord paramount. It became practically impossible to buy back the peace once it had been broken. The Crown, however, stepped in, and offered protection on certain conditions: the culprit surrendered himself and all that he had to the King, placing himself “in misericordiam regis,” and delivering a tangible pledge (vadium) as evidence and security of the surrender. Strictly speaking, the man's life and limbs and all that he had were at the King's mercy. The Crown, however, found that it might defeat its own interests by excessive greed; and generally contented itself with moderate forfeits. Rules of procedure were formulated: the amounts taken were regulated partly by the wealth of the offender, and partly by the gravity of the offence. Further, it became a recognized rule that the amount should be assessed by what was practically a jury of the culprit's neighbours; and attempts were also made to fix a maximum.\n\nThus a sort of tariff grew up, which the Crown usually respected in practice, without abandoning the right to demand more. Such payments were known as “amercements.” For petty offences, men were constantly placed “in mercy”: for failure to attend meetings of a hundred or county; for false or mistaken verdicts; for infringements of forest rights. The Charter of Henry I. (chapter 8) had promised a remedy, drastic indeed but of a reactionary and impossible nature. His promise, to abolish altogether the system of amercements (then of recent introduction) and to revert to the earlier Anglo–Saxon system of bots and wites, was made only to be broken.\n\nNo one could expect to pass through life (perhaps hardly through a single year) without being subjected to amercements. Three chapters of Magna Carta accordingly are occupied with remedies. Chapter 20 seeks to protect the ordinary layman; chapter 21, the barons; and chapter 22, the clergy. Three subdivisions—the freeman, the villein, and the merchant—are treated here.\n\nAmercements are much mentioned in Magna Carta, particularly article 20:\n\nA free man shall not be amerced for a trivial offence except in accordance with the degree of the offence, and for a grave offence he shall be amerced in accordance with its gravity, yet saving his way of living; and a merchant in the same way, saving his stock-in-trade; and a villein shall be amerced in the same way, saving his means of livelihood--if they have fallen into our mercy: and none of the aforesaid amercements shall be imposed except by the oath of good men of the neighbourhood.\n\nThe great object of the reforms here promised was to eliminate the arbitrary element; the Crown must conform to its own customary rules. With this object, safeguards were devised for freemen. (a) For a slight offence, only a petty sum could be taken. This was nothing new: the records of John’s reign show that, both before and after 1215, very small amounts were often taken: threepence was a common sum. (b) For grave offences, a larger sum might be assessed, but not out of proportion to the offence. (c) In no case could the offender be pushed absolutely to the wall: his means of livelihood must be saved to him. Even if all other effects had to be sold off to pay the amount assessed, he was to retain his “contenement,” a word to be afterwards discussed. (d) Another clause provided machinery for giving effect to these rules. The amount must be fixed, not arbitrarily by the Crown, but by impartial assessors, “by the oath of honest men of the neighbourhood.” In the reissue of 1216 “honest men” became “honest and lawworthy (legalium) men,” a purely verbal change.\n\nThere were apparently two steps in the fixing of amercements. (a) In the case of a commoner, the penalty under normal circumstances would be assessed provisionally by the King's justices on circuit, with the assistance of the sheriff. It was their duty to see that the amount was proportionate to the gravity of the offence. (b) Thereafter, the sheriff or his serjeants, in full county court, with the assistance of twelve neighbours, taxed the amercements, reducing them in accordance with their knowledge of the wrong–doer's ability to pay.\n\nThe Pipe Rolls afford illustrations of the practice. In the fourteenth year of Henry II a certain priest (who, in this respect, stood on the same footing as a layman) had been placed \"in misericordiam\" of 100 marks by William fitz John, one of the King's justices, but that sum was afterwards reduced to 40 marks \"per sacramentum vicinorum suorum\". It seems a safe inference that, on the priest pleading poverty, the question of his ability to pay was referred to local recognitors with the result stated. This priest was subsequently pardoned altogether “because of his poverty.”\n\nMagna Carta in this chapter, treating of the amercements of freeholders, merchants and villeins, makes no reference to the part played by the King's justices, but only to the functions of the jury of neighbours. All this is in marked contrast with the provisions of chapter 21, regulating the treatment to be accorded to earls and barons who made default.\n\nThe early history of villeins as a class is enveloped in the mists that still surround the rise of the English manor. Notwithstanding the efforts of Mr. Frederic Seebohm to find the origin of villeinage in the status of the serfs who worked for Roman masters upon British farms long before the Teutonic immigrations began, an older theory still holds the field, namely, that the abject villeins of Norman days were descendants of free–born \"ceorls\" of Anglo–Saxon stock. On this theory, most of England was once cultivated by Anglo–Saxon peasant proprietors grouped in little societies, each of which formed an isolated village. These villagers were slowly sinking from their originally free estate during several centuries prior to 1066: but the process of their degradation was completed rapidly and roughly by the Norman conquerors. The once free peasantry were crushed down into the dependent villeins of the eleventh and twelfth centuries.\n\nWhichever theory may be the correct one, the position, economic, legal, and political, of villeins in the thirteenth century has been ascertained with certainty. Economically they were part of the equipment of the manor of their lord, whose fields they had to cultivate as a condition of being left in possession of acres, in a sense, their own. The services exacted, at first vague and undefined, were gradually specified and limited. They varied from century to century, from district to district, and even from manor to manor; but at best the life of the villein was, as a contemporary writer has described it, burdensome and wretched (\"graviter et miserabiliter\"). After his obligations were discharged, little time was left him for the ploughing and reaping of his own holding. The normal villein possessed his virgate or half virgate (thirty or fifteen scattered acres) under a tenure known as \"villenagium\", sharply distinguished from the freeholder's tenures. He was a dependent dweller on a manor which he dared not quit without his master's leave.\n\nIt is true that he had rights of a proprietary nature in the acres he claimed as his own; yet these were determined, not by the common law of England, but by “the custom of the manor,” or virtually at the will of the lord. These rights, such as they were, could not be pleaded elsewhere than before the court customary of that manor over which the lord's steward presided with powers wide and undefined. Politically his position was peculiar: allowed none of the privileges, he was yet expected to perform some of the duties, of the freeman. He attended the shire and hundred courts, and acted on juries, thus suffering still further encroachments on the scanty portion of time he might call his own, but preserving for a brighter day a vague tradition of his earlier liberty.\n\nThis chapter extends some measure of protection to villeins. Two questions, however, may be asked:—What measure? and from what motive? One point is clear: the villeins were protected from the abuse of only such amercements as John himself might inflict, not from the amercements of their manorial lords; for the words used are \"si inciderint in misericordiam nostram\". A villein in the King's mercy shall enjoy the same consideration as the freeholder or merchant in similar plight—his means of livelihood being saved to him. The word now used is neither “contenement” nor merchandise, but \"waynagium\", the meaning of which has been the subject of discussion. Coke defined it as “the contenement of a villein; or the furniture of his cart or wain,” and Coke has been widely followed. The word, however, has apparently no connexion with wains or wagons, but is merely a Latinized form of the French word \"gagnage\", of which Godefroy gives five meanings: (a) gain; (b) tillage; (c) crop; (d) land under the plough; (e) grain. Professor Tait is inclined to read the word, in its present context, as equivalent either to “crops” or to “lands under cultivation,” and to translate the clause “saving his tillage.” What was the motive of these restrictions? It is usually supposed to have been clemency, the humane desire not to reduce a poor wretch to absolute beggary. It is possible, however, to imagine a different motive; the villein was the property of his lord, and John must respect the vested interests of others. That the King might do what he pleased with his own property, his demesne villeins, seems clear from a passage usually neglected by commentators, namely, chapter 16 of the reissue of 1217. Four important words were there introduced—\"villanus alterius quam noster\": the king was not to inflict crushing amercements on villeins “other than his own,” thus leaving villeins on royal manors unreservedly in his power.\n\nThe trader is in the same position as the \"liber homo\", except that it is his “merchandise,” not his “contenement,” that is protected. The word is capable of two somewhat different shades of meaning. Narrowly interpreted, it may refer to his wares, the stock–in–trade without which the pursuit of his calling would be impossible. More broadly viewed, it might mean his business itself, his position as a merchant. The difference is of little practical import: in either view the Charter saves to him his means of earning a living.\n\nSome boroughs, indeed, had anticipated Magna Carta by obtaining in their own charters a definition of the maximum amercement exigible, or in some cases of the amercing body. Thus, John's Charter to Dunwich of 29 June 1200 provides that the burgesses shall only be amerced by six men from within the borough, and six men from without. The capital had special privileges: in his Charter to London, Henry I promised that no citizen \"in misericordia pecuniae\" should pay a higher sum than 100 shillings (the amount of his wer). This was confirmed in the Charter of Henry II, who declared “that none shall be adjudged for amercements of money, but according to the law of the city, which they had in the time of King Henry, my grandfather.” John's Charter to London of 17 June 1199, also referred to this; and the general confirmation of customs, contained in chapter 13 of Magna Carta, would further strengthen it. In all probability, the earlier grant covered trivial offences only (such as placed the offender in the King's hands \"de misericordia pecuniae\"). The present chapter is wider in its scope, applying to grave offences also, and embracing merchants everywhere, not merely the burgesses of chartered towns.\n\nIn the thirteenth century, these terms were sharply contrasted. “Amercement” was applied to sums imposed in punishment of misdeeds; the law–breaker had no option of refusing, and no voice in fixing the amount. “Fine,” on the contrary, was used for voluntary offerings made to the King to obtain some favour or to escape punishment. Here the initiative rested with the individual, who suggested the amount to be paid, and was, indeed, under no legal obligation to make any offer at all. This distinction between fines and amercements, absolute in theory, could readily be obliterated in practice. The spirit of the restriction placed by this chapter and by the common law upon the King's prerogative of inflicting amercements could often be evaded. The Crown might imprison its victims for an indefinite period, and then graciously allow them to offer large payments to escape death by fever or starvation in a noisome gaol: enormous fines might thus be taken, while royal officials were forbidden to inflict arbitrary amercements.\n\nWith the gradual elimination of the voluntary element the word “fine” came to bear its modern meaning, while “amercement” dropped out of ordinary use.\n\nReferred to in \"Frantz v. U.S. Powerlifting Federation\" 836 F.2d 1063 (7th Cir. 1987). In a discussion about the imposition of FRCP Rule 11 sanctions on a plaintiff's attorney, the decision says, \"The complaint in this case was frivolous, which calls at a minimum for censure of Victor D. Quilici, the plaintiffs' lawyer. Whether it calls for amercement - and, if so, whether Cotter or the Treasury is the appropriate beneficiary - is something the district court should consider as an initial matter.\"\n\nA cause of action in amercement will exist against a sheriff who refused to seize property under a writ of execution. \"Vitale v. Hotel California, Inc.\", 446 A.2d 880 (N.J. Super. Ct. Law, 1982). See also http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/2101.09v1 and http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/2101.10v1 .\n\nSince 2006, US banks have been amerced large amounts under prosecution of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or the Trading with the Enemy Act. The civil nature of the asset forfeiture laws allows the banks not to be declared criminally guilty. The asset forfeiture wiki lists a number of cases of recent note.\n\nTerrance Huff was driving and Jon Seaton was the passenger in a car with Ohio license plates that was stopped in Illinois, as recorded by Officer Reichert's dashboard camera. Huff provided his driver's license, insurance, and registration. Reichert explained that Huff crossed the center line without using a signal and then moved back into his own lane. Dispatch related that Huff had been arrested for battery and for marijuana cultivation in 2001, but those charges were dismissed. Seaton had no criminal history. \n\nReichert requested backup, but told Huff that he was letting him go with a warning. Seaton seemed nervous, so Reichert then asked if Huff objected to a search. Huff replied that he would “like to go.” Reichert said that he wanted to walk his drug‐sniffing dog around the car. Huff asked Reichert if he was free to go. Reichert responded, “not in the car.” Huff said that he felt he had no choice but to consent, and that Reichert could use the dog but could not search the car. Reichert repeatedly said, “show me! Find it!” The dog barked. Reichert replied, repeatedly, “good boy!” Reichert later admitted that he was trained not to say these things to his dog. Reichert told Huff that he was going to search his car. Huff responded, “do what you gotta do.” Reichert searched the car, but did not document the presence of drugs nor collect any evidence. About 50 minutes after the stop, Reichert told the two men that they were free to leave. In their suit under 42 U.S.C. 1983, the court denied Reichert's motion for summary judgment based on qualified immunity. The Seventh Circuit affirmed.\n\nThe incident occurred along a stretch of highway know to be a lucrative source of asset forfeiture revenue for state and local police departments. Police are known to create traffic infractions to allow for such stops and then develop probable cause to conduct drug searches. If police can establish any connection to drug activity, officers can seize drivers' cars and cash, with \"proceeds funding the police department\". Under Illinois law, it can be very difficult and \"expensive for an innocent person\" to gain return of their property, particularly for motorists who are from out of state, like Huff.\n\nRadley Balko, a \"Washington Post\" journalist, in March 2014 wrote that the \n\"biggest barrier to lawsuits against police officers is the doctrine of qualified immunity. It isn’t enough to show that a cop violated your rights. To even get in front of a jury, you must also show that the rights the officer violated were “well established” at the time of the incident. The tactics Reichert used in Huff’s case are fairly common, so Huff surviving qualified immunity was far from a sure thing. But this week, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit rejected Reichert’s qualified immunity claim and will allow Huff's suit to go forward.\"\n\n\nBy January 2014, eight provinces had \"civil forfeiture acts\" on the law books. All dated from the 21st century.\n\n\nYukoners rejected \"Bill 82\" in 2010. Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador appear to be the remaining holdout provinces.\n\nIn force since November 2001, Alberta's régime now provides a helpful six-step flowchart diagram, and remarks that \"... the Civil Forfeiture process operates regardless of whether charges are laid, or convictions are obtained. The Civil Forfeiture Office only has to prove, based on a balance of probabilities, that:\n\n\nIn 2001, Ontario passed the \"Remedies for Organized Crime and Other Unlawful Activities Act, 2001\" (since changed to the \"Civil Remedies Act, 2001\"). This was a novelty in the field of provincial legislation. In 2007, Michael Bryant, then Attorney-General for Ontario, was \"proud that Ontario continues to be a nationally and internationally recognized leader in the field of civil forfeiture.\" The Ontario Civil Remedies for Illicit Activities (CRIA) office was, according to Bryant, \"considered an international authority on civil forfeiture,\" as the \"Civil Remedies Act\" had been the first of its kind in Canada. \n\nIn Ontario, the legislation has been used to amerce large quantities of banknotes. A law officer detained a citizen for driving too slowly. The officer searched the vehicle and found $75,000 in the trunk. The $75,000 was amerced because the officer disbelieved the explanation of the citizen.\n\nWhen \"Bill 5\", which was later to become the \"Civil Forfeiture Act\", was introduced by British Columbia Solicitor-General Rich Coleman, he made liberal use of the \"organised crime\" fear, uncertainty and doubt tactic. He also mentioned that Ontario, Manitoba and Alberta had also recently introduced similar legislation. This law later was expanded to create the \"Civil Forfeiture Office\", whereby property can be amerced with no court process.\n\nSince at least 2010, Manitoba has used the popular distaste for pederasty to amerce land and abodes. A woman was found to state her support for the amercement of the home a youth soccer coach who had been accused of a crime but not convicted because \"The courts are notoriously lenient with these individuals and I think the Crown is saying enough is enough — if this is another means that we can use to make it more risky for these individuals let's do it.\"\n\nIn Saskatchewan, a man had his truck amerced in 2010 when, for want of $60 worth of gas, he trafficked two tablets of Oxycontin to an undercover police officer. The Crown maintained that his truck was an instrument of crime. The trial judge ruled in favour of the defendant, but was overruled on appeal to by the Crown.\n\nSince 2007, Nova Scotia has made \"sure that crime doesn't pay. The province has set up a civil forfeiture unit, which receives cases referred from law enforcement agencies where there is evidence of wrongdoing but criminal charges are not laid, such as bootlegging or selling stolen property.\"\n\nIn 2009, the Supreme Court of Canada held that the Civil Remedies Act 2001 of Ontario was constitutionally sound with respect to a question about federal-provincial jurisdiction in Chatterjee v. Ontario (Attorney-General). A brief was written by Ross.\n\nThe LLM thesis of JA Krane, which studied amercements in detail, concluded that the Charter of Rights was deficient because it fails to enshrine property rights. Krane condenses this work into a 29-page prospectus entitled \"Property, Proportionality and the Instruments of Crime\".\n\nIn a 2013 review paper, Gallant and King expressed their concern over amercements in Canada and Ireland. An earlier article by Gallant was cited in the SCC Chatterjee judgment.\n\nThe Court of Alberta Queen's Bench and the British Columbia Supreme Court have excluded evidence obtained illegally,\n\n\n"}

Singing critics like Melanie Eskenazi describe him as a vocal virtuoso of the local phrasing and decoration (ornamenti) of those particular musical periods exactly as they were practised back then. He is considered a world authority in the field of European early music, the scores of which he helped promote and rescue as a music genre, since the outset of his early career.\n\nA native of Wellington, Shropshire, Nigel was brought up in a musical family where his father sang in a choir and his mother taught the piano, so from a very early age he was studying music. Nigel Rogers studied at King's College, Cambridge (where he was a choral scholar) from 1953 to 1956, in Rome in 1957, in Milan from 1958 to 1959, and with Gerhard Hüsch at the Munich Hochschule für Musik (1959–1961). Whilst in Munich, along with Thomas Binkley, Sterling Jones and Andrea von Ramm, he was a founder member of the pioneering medieval ensemble, Studio der Frühen Musik (Early Music Quartet) with which he worked for around three years, leaving the group in December 1963. He made 11 recordings with them between 1962 and 1970, including the award winning album of John Dowland on the Archiv label released in 1966.\n\nHe made his operatic debut in Amsterdam, and has sung in many renowned international opera houses. He has given numerous singing master classes and workshops at music conservatories worldwide, for early music and opera singers of all nationalities. \n\nOperas with which he was notably associated include L'Orfeo by Monteverdi, in which he took the title role and made many recordings.\nFrom 1978 until his retirement he was a professor of classical singing and operatic voice coach at the Royal College of Music in London. In 1979 he founded and thereupon conducted the vocal ensemble Chiaroscuro for the performance of Italian baroque compositions.\n\nIn July 1993 he starred at a Handel oratorio at the Palacio de Bellas Artes Opera House in Mexico City. In May 1994, two great-great grandchildren of President of Mexico Valentín Canalizo, Antonio Haas Canalizo, patron of the Mazatlán Opera House \"Teatro Ángela Peralta\", classical and jazz pianist, and founder of the Mazatlán Conservatory of Music and the Mazatlán Literature Award in Sinaloa state, Mexico, and his niece, soprano, jazz singer, castanets soloist, singer-songwriter and member of royalty, Lady Marina De Santiago-de Borbón Haas Canalizo (Lady Marina of Bourbon), Queen of Spain Isabella II of Bourbon's great-great granddaughter, invited Nigel Rogers to the city of Mazatlán. There he was acquainted with different styles of Mexican music, Mariachi, and Mexican Carnival band music. Nigel became a close long-standing friend of Lady Marina of Bourbon, and the Haas Canalizo family, founders and former inhabitants of today's \"Haas House Museum\" (Casa Museo Haas) in Mazatlán, the family's mansion where Nigel stayed during his visit to Mazatlán before it was turned into a museum by the government of Sinaloa.\n\nNigel Rogers lives in Deal, England, with his harpsichordist Lithuanian wife Lina Zilinskyte and his daughter Georgina. On 3 May 2005, he gave his 70th birthday recital concert at Wigmore Hall in London, singing works by early music composers Carissimi, Caccini, Sigismondo d'India, Frescobaldi, Marco Marazzoli, Kapsberger, Rossi, Stradella, and Froberger.\n\n"}

It was first developed in the early 1700s in China, where the trait was referred to as dragon eyes.\n\nExcept for its enlarged projecting eyes, the demekin is similar to the ryukin and fantail. It has a deep body and long flowing fins, some with veiled fins and some with broad, or short fins, like the \"China doll\". Demekins are available in red, red-and-white, calico, black-and-white, chocolate, blue, lavender, kirin, chocolate-and-blue and black coloration. They may either have metallic, matted, or nacreous scales. Telescope eyes can grow quite large.\n\nThe black telescope is a black colored variant of a telescope goldfish that has a characteristic pair of protruding eyes. Black telescopes are commonly known as Blackamoors, black moors or just moors, a reference to the black North African Muslim inhabitants of Al-Andalus.\n\nBlack telescopes are descendants of a type of wild carp known as the silver Prussian carp or gibel carp, this fish is believed to originate from China in the 1400s. In the 1500s they were traded in Japan, and lastly, in the 1800s, they made their way to the U.S.. It is widely accepted they were a result of selective fish breeding by Chinese who first called them Dragon Fish or Dragon Eyes.\n\nMost telescopes have deep bodies and long, flowing finnage, with characteristic protruding eyes, but the original is fan-tailed and has a similar body to the fantail goldfish, from which they are derived. \n\nYoung black telescopes resemble bronze fantails. Their black coloration and eye protrusion develop with age. They can grow up to a length of 4-10 inches, but may lose their velvet-like appearance with increasing age (lifespan: 6 to 25 years). The fish can range in coloring anywhere from a lighter grey to a dark black, but most black telescope goldfish do not stay pure black forever, and many of them change from a rust-colored underbelly to orange splotches. Because their eyes are usually large, their vision is poor.\n\nBlack telescope goldfish are popular because they are hardy fish and because their black color sets them apart from the more abundant orange color. Goldfish are typically easy to care for. Black moors, in particular, are able to withstand a wide variety of temperatures. They do well with other fancy goldfish varieties, especially those with impaired vision such as the bubble eye or Celestial goldfish. \n\nIt was once theorized that \nthe blackness in goldfish is only exhibited by the telescope-eyed goldfish and that the black color is only a permanent fixture with telescope eye goldfish. However, with the recent entry of black lionheads, black orandas, black ranchus, black ryukins, black pearlscales, black comets, black bubble eyes, black crosses of two or more goldfish, and black \"hibunas\", this view is no longer true.\n\nIn fact, black telescopes do sometimes spawn normal-eyed offspring, which are black also. However, they are often culled as they do not conform to the telescope eye feature for the Moor variety.\n\nIn 1941, Moscow aquarist P. Andrianov, bred a kind of black telescope with orange-red eyes.\n\nThe panda telescope is a panda variant of a telescope goldfish with a characteristic black-and-white color pattern and protruding eyes. \n\nPanda telescopes have protruding eyes. Young moors resemble bronze fantails and their protruding eyes gradually develop with age. They sport a velvety appearance in maturity. However, they may lose this velvet-like appearance with increasing age. They can also lose their panda coloration with age; they may become orange and white or any other color combination. Frequently panda moors will not keep any of their coloration, or they may turn pure white. \n\nWhite telescope is a white variant of telescope goldfish characterized by a solid white body and protruding eyes.\n\nThe white telescope has a solid white body which contrasts the black variant, the black telescope goldfish, which has a solid black body. The white moor is a variant of the telescope goldfish.\n\nYoung white telescopes resemble bronze fantails. Their brown coloration decreases and eye protrusion develops with age. They can grow up to a length of 6 inches. Because their eyes are usually large, their vision is poor. \n\nWhite telescopes are less popular than black telescopes. The white telescopes, in particular, are able to withstand a wide variety of temperatures. They do well with other fancy goldfish varieties.\n\nThere are also red, orange and yellow telescopes.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1882179", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1882179", "title": "The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian", "text": "The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian\n\nThe Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian is a 2008 high fantasy film co-written and directed by Andrew Adamson, based on \"Prince Caspian\", the second published, fourth chronological novel in C. S. Lewis's epic fantasy series, \"The Chronicles of Narnia\". It is the second in \"The Chronicles of Narnia\" film series from Walden Media, following \"\" (2005). William Moseley, Anna Popplewell, Skandar Keynes, Georgie Henley, Liam Neeson, and Tilda Swinton reprise their roles from the first film, while new cast includes Ben Barnes, Sergio Castellitto, Peter Dinklage, Eddie Izzard, Warwick Davis, Ken Stott, and Vincent Grass. In the film, the four Pevensie children return to Narnia to aid Prince Caspian in his struggle with the \"secret\" help of Aslan for the throne against his corrupt uncle, King Miraz.\n\n\"Prince Caspian\", a British-American production, is the last \"Narnia\" film to be co-produced by Walt Disney Pictures, as 20th Century Fox became the distributor for the next film \"\" due to budgetary disputes between Disney and Walden Media, but as a result of Disney eventually purchasing Fox on March 20, 2019, Disney now owns the rights to all three \"Narnia\" movies. Work on the script began before \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\" was released, so filming could begin before the actors grew too old for their parts. Director Andrew Adamson wanted to make the film more spectacular than the first, and created an action sequence not in the novel. The Narnians were designed to look wilder as they have been hiding from persecution, stressing the darker tone of the sequel. The filmmakers also took a Spanish influence for the antagonistic race of the Telmarines. Filming began in February 2007 in New Zealand, but unlike the previous film, the majority of shooting took place in Central Europe, because of the larger sets available in those countries. To keep costs down, Adamson chose to base post-production in the UK, because of recent tax credits there.\n\n\"The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian\" premiered on May 7, 2008 at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City, before it was theatrically released on May 16 in the United States and on June 26 in the United Kingdom. The film received mostly positive reviews from film critics. Many praised the performances and visual effects; however, the film's darker tone and mature themes drew polarizing opinions. It was a moderate success at the box office, grossing $55 million during its opening weekend. By the end of its theatrical run, it had grossed over $419.7 million worldwide. The film became the 10th-highest-grossing film worldwide in 2008.\n\nIn Narnia, almost 1,300 years have passed after the Pevensie siblings left. Caspian, a Telmarine prince, is awoken by his mentor Doctor Cornelius, who informs him that his aunt has just given birth to a son and that his life is now in grave danger. Cornelius gives him Queen Susan's ancient magical horn and instructs him to use it if he is in dire need of help. Knowing that his Uncle Miraz would kill him in order to be king, Caspian flees. Chased by several Telmarine soldiers, Caspian falls off his horse and encounters two Narnian dwarfs and a talking badger in the woods. One of the dwarfs, Trumpkin, is captured by the soldiers after sacrificing himself to save Caspian, while the other dwarf, Nikabrik, and the badger Trufflehunter, save Caspian. Not knowing that they are trying to save him, Caspian blows the magical horn, trying to summon help.\n\nIn England, the four Pevensie children wait at the Strand tube station for their train which will take them to boarding school. One year has passed in their world after they left Narnia. Just as the train pulls into the station the station tears apart transporting them back in Narnia. There, they discover their castle, Cair Paravel, was attacked and ruined in their absence. The Pevensies save a bound and gagged Trumpkin, who is about to be drowned, and they set off together.\n\nMeanwhile, Nikabrik and Trufflehunter lead Caspian to the Dancing Lawn, where all the old Narnians have assembled. Caspian convinces them to help him win his throne. Caspian and his troops encounter the Pevensies and Trumpkin, and they journey together to Aslan's How, a huge underground hall built over the Stone Table. Lucy wants to wait for Aslan, but Peter decides they have waited long enough and suggests attacking Miraz's castle. The Narnians succeed in infiltrating the castle, but Peter calls for a retreat when the gate is sabotaged. Half of the Narnians manage to escape, but the rest are trapped behind the closed gate and brutally slaughtered.\n\nNikabrik tells Caspian that there is a way he can claim his throne and guarantee Miraz's death. When Caspian agrees, a hag uses black sorcery to summon the White Witch. From inside a wall of ice, the Witch tries to convince Caspian to give her a drop of his blood in order to set her free. Peter, Edmund, and Trumpkin arrive and dispatch Nikabrik while Edmund shatters the wall of ice before the Witch can be freed.\n\nMiraz and his army arrive at Aslan's How. Peter challenges Miraz to a one-on-one duel, in order to buy Lucy and Susan time to find Aslan. Peter is able to wound Miraz, and gives his sword to Caspian to finish him off. Caspian, who cannot bring himself to do it, spares Miraz's life but says that he intends to give Narnia back to its people. Lord Sopespian, one of Miraz's generals, suddenly stabs and kills Miraz with an arrow and blames the Narnians, igniting a massive battle between the Narnians and the Telmarines. Lucy, meanwhile, has found Aslan in the woods; he awakens the trees and the whole forest suddenly attacks the Telmarines, Lord Sopespian orders the retreat, where they are confronted by Lucy and Aslan. Aslan summons a river god, which wipes out the majority of the Telmarine army, including Sopespian; all of the surviving Telmarine soldiers surrender and hand over their weapons.\n\nCaspian becomes the King of Narnia and, with Aslan's help, brings peace between the Narnian and Telmarine kingdoms. Before the Pevensies depart, Peter and Susan declare to Caspian, Edmund, and Lucy that Aslan says that Susan and Peter will never enter Narnia again because they have accomplished what they were brought there for, but Lucy and Edmund might come back. Susan kisses Caspian, knowing she will never see him again, and the Pevensies then go back to England, leaving Caspian as King of Narnia.\n\n\n\n\nBefore the release of \"\", the screenplay for the sequel \"Prince Caspian\" had already been written. Director Andrew Adamson said the decision was made to follow the publication order of the novels because \"if we don't make it now we'll never be able to, because the [actors will] be too old\". \"Prince Caspian\", the second published novel in the series, is the fourth chronologically. \"The Horse and His Boy\" takes place during a time only hinted at in \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\". The writers briefly considered combining \"Caspian\" with \"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader\", which the BBC did for their television adaptation.\n\nScreenwriters Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely wanted to explore how the Pevensies felt after returning from Narnia, going from being kings and queens back to an awkward year as school children. They noted, \"<nowiki>[</nowiki>C. S. Lewis<nowiki>]</nowiki> doesn't much consider what it would be like for a King of Narnia to return to being a 1940s schoolchild.\" They also decided to introduce the Pevensies back into Narnia nearer the start, in order to weave the two separate stories of the Pevensies and Caspian, in contrast to the book's structure. A sense of guilt on the Pevensies' part was added, seeing the destruction of Narnia in their absence, as was hubris for Peter to enhance the theme of belief: his arrogance means he is unable to see Aslan.\n\nAdamson also desired to make the film larger in scale; \"I've gained confidence having gone through the first. This time, I was able to go larger [in] scale, with more extras and bigger battle scenes.\" Inspired by a passage in the novel where Reepicheep says he would like to attack the castle, a new battle scene in which Peter and Caspian make an attempted raid on Miraz's castle was created. Adamson felt the imagery of mythological Greek creatures storming a castle was highly original. Markus and McFeely used the sequence to illustrate Peter and Caspian's conflict and Edmund's maturity, in an effort to tighten the script by using action as drama. Adamson preferred subtlety to the drama scenes, asking his young male actors not to perform angrily. Adamson copied Alfred Hitchcock by \"tell[ing] people at the end of the scene, 'Now just give me something where you're not thinking about anything.' By using it in context, the audience will read an emotion into it.\"\n\nAndrew Adamson described the film as being darker, as it takes place \"another 1300 years later, [and] Narnia has been oppressed by Telmarines for a large period of that time, so it's a dirtier, grittier, darker place than the last world was\". He added, \"This one is more of a boy's movie. It's a harsher world. The villains are human, and that lends a more realistic attitude.\" Creatures were designed by veteran horror and monster concept artist Jordu Schell and supervised by Howard Berger, who said that \"Prince Caspian\" would be more medieval than \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\". Alongside Adamson, Berger's children critiqued his designs, aiding the process: his son thought the werewolf's ears were silly, so they were made smaller.\n\nFor the Narnians, Berger envisioned them as more wild in appearance, as they have been forced into the forests. He also decided to increase the portrayal of various ages, sizes and races. The black dwarfs are distinguished from the red dwarfs as they have more leather and jewellery, and a darker colour scheme in their costumes. Each race of creatures also had their fighting styles made more distinguishable. The minotaurs have maces, and the centaurs use swords. The satyrs were redesigned, as their creation on the first film had been rushed. Four thousand and six hundred make-up jobs were performed, which Berger believes is a record.\n\nThe filmmakers interpreted the Telmarines, including Caspian, as being Spanish because of their pirate origins, which producer Mark Johnson noted made Caspian \"a contrast to the lily-white [Pevensies]\". Production designer Roger Ford originally wanted the Telmarines to be French, as they had a confrontational history with the English, who are represented by the Pevensies. This was scrapped as the crew were unable to shoot at Pierrefonds Castle, for Miraz's lair, so they went for the Spanish feel. Weta Workshop created masked helmets for their army, and faceplates for the live horses on set. The stunt soldiers wield two hundred polearms in two different styles, two hundred rapiers of varying design, over a hundred falchions, two hundred and fifty shields and fifty-five crossbows. Caspian's own sword is a variation of the Royal Guard's weapons. Costume designer Isis Mussenden looked to the paintings of El Greco to inspire the Telmarines' costumes. She wanted to use colours that looked \"acidic and hot and cool at the same time\", unlike the red and gold seen in the Narnian soldiers. Their masked helmets are based on conquistadors and samurai. She visited the armour archives of the Metropolitan Museum of Art for inspiration. An eagle emblem was incorporated into the characters' lairs to make them feel fascist.\n\nEight months were spent scouting locations, including Ireland, China and Argentina, before New Zealand, Prague, Slovenia and Poland were chosen. Whereas the previous film was predominantly shot in New Zealand with a few months of filming in Central Europe, Adamson decided New Zealand lacked enough sound stages to accommodate the larger scale of the film. The decision to film most of the picture in Europe also allowed the ability to shoot during summer in both continents, although the weather turned out to be so erratic during filming that Adamson joked he had been lied to.\n\nFilming began on February 12, 2007 in Auckland. The scene where the Pevensies return to the ruined Cair Paravel was shot at Cathedral Cove. The filmmakers chose the location because it had a tunnel-like arch, which echoed the train tunnel the children go into before being summoned back into Narnia. Henderson Valley Studios was used for the Pevensies' ancient treasure room and the Underground station.\n\nOn April 1, 2007, the crew began filming at Barrandov Studios in Prague. There, sets such as Miraz's castle, Aslan's How and the underground hiding places of the Narnians were created. The castle was built to scale because Adamson felt he overused digital sets on the last film. The castle was built in the open air during winter, where the temperature would drop to . Miraz's courtyard is the largest set in production designer Roger Ford's career, including the previous \"Narnia\" film. Aslan's How was modified into the hideout after filming for those scenes was finished. To create Trufflehunter's den, Ford's crew put a camera inside a badger's den to study what it should look like. The den's roof had to be raised by three inches because Ben Barnes was too tall.\n\nIn June 2007, they shot the bridge battle near Bovec in the Soča Valley, Slovenia. The location was chosen for its resemblance to New Zealand. A large bridge was built, which was modelled on the one Julius Caesar built to cross the Rhine. Whereas Caesar supposedly built his bridge in ten days, the filmmakers had around forty. The schedule was short though, but the authorities would only allow them this build time to not completely disrupt normal summer activities on the lake. The filmmakers made a trench to change the river's course, so they could deepen the drained sides of the riverbed so it looked like one could drown in it. The crew also cut down 100 trees for shots of the Telmarines building the bridge; the trees were moved to another side of the river for decoration. The bridge stood for two months before being dismantled. As part of the clean-up, the cut-down trees and parts of the bridge were sent to a recycling plant, while other portions of the bridge were sent to the studio for close-ups shot against bluescreen.\n\nPart of the battle was shot at Ústí nad Labem in the Czech Republic. Only the entrance to Aslan's How was built on location. Adamson wanted Peter and Miraz's duel to feel unique and not like a controlled, overly choreographed fencing match: Moseley and Castellitto began training for the scene in November 2006. The stunt coordinator Allan Poppleton doubled for Castellitto in some shots because they are similar in size. For claustrophobic shots, cameras were built into their shields. The main camera was placed on a 360-degree track surrounding the ruin it takes place on. The filmmakers dug a large hole in the ground for the scene where the Narnians cause the pillars supporting the growth near Aslan's How to collapse on the Telmarines. The earth was then restored following completion of the scene. They also had to restore the grass after filming numerous cavalry charges. 18,000 fern plants were imported to the Czech Republic to create a forest. A scene shot in Poland, which involved building a cliff face, also had to leave no trace behind. Filming finished by September 8, 2007.\n\n\"Prince Caspian\" has over 1,500 special effects shots, more than \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s 800 effects shots, yet the film had less time to complete them. The scale of special effects led Andrew Adamson to base production in the UK, to take advantage of new tax credits. Therefore, it legally qualifies as a British film. This also meant the director only had to walk five minutes from the editing room to supervise the effects. British visual effects companies the Moving Picture Company and Framestore CFC were hired to create the visual effects alongside Weta Digital. Framestore worked on Aslan, Trufflehunter and the door in the air; Scanline did the River-god; Weta created the werewolf, the wild bear and Miraz's castle; MPC and Escape Studios did the main battle, the tunnel scene, the castle assault, the council scenes and all the other creatures.\n\nAlex Funke, who worked on \"The Lord of the Rings\", directed the film's miniatures unit. These include 1/24th- and 1/100th-scale miniatures of Miraz's castle. A scale model was built of the Narnians' cave hideouts during the climactic battle, which the actor playing the giant Wimbleweather was filmed against. One of the improvements made over the previous film was to make the centaurs walk during dialogue scenes, so Cornell John as Glenstorm wore Power Risers (mechanical stilts with springs), to mimic a horse's canter and height. The animatronic Minotaur heads were also improved to properly lip sync, although this was not as successful as hoped and had to be revamped digitally.\n\nIn the climactic battle, 150 extras stood in for the Narnians, while 300 extras were used for the Telmarines. These were digitally duplicated until there were 1,000 Narnians and 5,000 Telmarines onscreen. The animators found it easier to create entirely digital centaurs and fauns, rather than mix digital legs with real actors. The dryads were entirely computer-generated, whereas in the first film digital petals had been composited over actors. However, Adamson had chosen to make the centaurs not wear armour, meaning the animators had to make the human–horse join behave more cohesively. Combining digital characters with actors, such as when Lucy hugs Aslan, had become easier since the first film, as lighting had improved. To achieve Lucy hugging Aslan, Framestore even replaced Georgie Henley's arm with a digital version. For the gryphons, a motion control rig was created for the actors to ride on. The rig could simulate subtle movements such as wing beats for realism. Adamson cited the river-god as the character he was most proud of. \"It was a really masterful effect: to control water like that is incredibly difficult\", he said. \"The [visual effects company] told us they'd been waiting to do a shot like that for ten years.\"\n\nThe film features catapults resembling windmills, that can fire rapidly, and a ballista that can fire three projectiles at a time. The practical versions of these were metal with fibreglass painted and aged to resemble wood on top. Weta created props of the missiles thrown by the Telmarine equipment. The practical version of the catapult had its upper half painted blue, to composite a digital version programmed for rapid firing movement.\n\n\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\" composer Harry Gregson-Williams began composing the sequel in December 2007. Recording began at Abbey Road Studios the following month, and finished by April 2008. The Crouch End Festival Chorus, Regina Spektor's song, \"The Call\", Oren Lavie's song, \"Dance 'Round The Memory Tree\" and Switchfoot's song, \"This Is Home\", are featured on the soundtrack. Imogen Heap, who sang \"Can't Take It In\" for the first film, wrote a new song which Gregson-Williams considered too dark.\n\nGregson-Williams' score is darker to follow suit with the film. Gregson-Williams wanted Caspian's theme to convey a vulnerability, which would sound more vibrant as he became more heroic. It originally used a 3/4 time signature, but the opening scene required a 4/4 and thus it was changed. To represent Miraz's cunning, the heroic theme from the first film was inverted. For Reepicheep, a muted trumpet was used to present his militaristic and organised character. Gregson-Williams considered arranging his theme for a small pennywhistle, but found that it sounded too cute and broke the tension of the night raid.\n\nDuring pre-production, Disney announced a December 14, 2007 release date, but pushed it back to May 16, 2008, because Disney opted to not release it in competition with \"\", another Walden Media production. Disney also felt the \"Harry Potter\" films comfortably changed their release dates from (Northern Hemisphere) winters to summers, and \"Narnia\" could likewise do the same because the film was darker and more like an action film. The world premiere was held at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City on May 7, 2008. The British premiere was held at the O2 Arena on June 19, the first time the dome has hosted a film screening. Around 10,000 people attended the event, the proceeds of which went to Great Ormond Street Hospital.\n\nThe film opened in 3,929 theaters in the United States and Canada on May 16, 2008. The Motion Picture Association of America gave the film a PG. To earn this rating, which the filmmakers were contractually bound by Disney to do, Adamson altered a shot of a fallen helmet to make clear that it did not contain a severed head. Adamson made numerous edits to the film beforehand after showing the film to a young audience, explaining \"When you sit down and you're watching it, and you see the kids' faces while making the film, you're just making an attempt, you're making it exciting, you're doing all of these things because you're essentially making the film for yourself. When you start showing it to an audience, that then influences how you feel about the film.\"\n\nAdding to the film's $225 million budget (almost $100 million of which were spent on the effects), Disney also spent $175 million on promoting the film. Play Along Toys created a playset of Miraz's castle, a series of 3¾-inch and 7-inch action figures, and roleplaying costumes. Weta Workshop's Collectibles unit also created statues, busts and helmets based on their props for the film, and there was also a Monopoly edition based on the film. In the UK, Damaris Trust was commissioned to produce resources relating to the film for churches and schools, which are available from the official UK Narnia website. In June 2008, the \"Journey into Narnia: Prince Caspian Attraction\" opened at Disney's Hollywood Studios, featuring a recreation of the Stone Table, behind-the-scenes footage, concept art, storyboards, props and costumes from the film. The tone of the film's marketing focused on the film's action, and unlike \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\" Disney and Walden did not screen the film for pastors or give Bible-based study guides in North America.\n\n\"Prince Caspian\" was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc in the UK on November 17, 2008, and on December 2, 2008 in North America. It was the top-selling DVD of its release week in the U.S. taking in $54.7 million. The film was released in Australia on November 27, 2008. There were one-disc and three-disc DVD editions (two-disc only in the UK), and two-disc and three-disc Blu-ray Disc editions (two-disc only in the UK). The first two discs contain an audio commentary by Adamson, blooper reel, deleted scenes and documentaries, while the third disc contains a digital copy of the film. For the Blu-ray Disc, Circle-Vision 360° was used to allow viewers to watch the night raid from different angles. An additional disc of special features was only made available in Japan and Zavvi stores in the UK, while a separate version containing a disc of electronic press kit material was exclusive to Sanity stores in Australia. By the end of 2008, the film earned almost $71 million in DVD sales.\n\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 67% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 192 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads, \"\"The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian\" is an entertaining family adventure worthy of the standard set by its predecessor.\" Metacritic reported the film had an average score of 62 out of 100, based on 34 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audience members polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nFilm critic Leonard Maltin gave the film 3 out of 4 stars (as he did with \"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\"), calling the performances \"strong\", the storytelling \"solid\", and the scenery \"breathtaking\", though he also said, \"it's a dark tale, and the climactic battle scenes go on at length.\"\n\nTwo film industry trade journals gave the film positive reviews. Todd McCarthy of \"Variety\" felt Adamson's direction had a \"surer sense of cinematic values\" and praised the improved special effects, the \"timeless\" locations and production design. On the performances, he felt \"the four kids overall have more character and are therefore more interesting to watch than they were before, and Italian actor Castellitto registers strongly with evil that's implacable but not overplayed.\" Michael Rechtshaffen of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" noted the film was darker than its predecessor, with \"the loss of innocence theme ... significantly deepened\". He highlighted Peter Dinklage's performance, which \"outmaneuver[ed] the title character as Narnia's most colorful new inhabitant\".\n\nA number of critics took issue with what they interpreted as the film's underlying messages. \"San Francisco Chronicle\" critic Mick Lasalle wrote in his parental advisory that \"basically, this is a movie about kids who go into another world and dimension and spend the whole time killing people.\" MSNBC reviewer Alonso Duralde noted that \"all the heroes have British accents while the Telmarines are all decidedly Mediterranean in appearance and inflection\". An \"Anglican Journal\" review described the movie as reasonably faithful to the adventure elements of the book, much lighter on the religious faith aspects, which they found integral to the novel, and deficient on character and emotion.\n\nThe Visual Effects Society nominated it for Best Visual Effects and Best Compositing. It was nominated for Best Fantasy Film, Best Costumes, Best Make-up, and Best Special Effects at the Saturn Awards. Keynes and Henley received nominations at the Young Artist Awards.\n\nIn 2010, Mark Johnson, a producer from all of the \"Narnia\" movies, admitted that \"We made some mistakes with \"Prince Caspian\" and I don't want to make them again.\" He also said \"Caspian\" lacked some of the \"wonder and magic of Narnia,\" was \"a little bit too rough\" for families, and too much of a \"boys' action movie.\"\n\nWhen released on May 16 in the United States and Canada, the film grossed $55 million from 8,400 screens at 3,929 theaters in its opening weekend, ranking #1 at the box office. Disney said it was happy with the film's performance, although the opening fell short of industry expectations of $80 million and was also behind 's opening gross of $65.6 million. By June 1 it grossed $115 million, while the first film had grossed $153 million in the same amount of time. Disney CEO Robert Iger attributed the film's underperformance to being released between two of the year's biggest hits, \"Iron Man\" and \"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\".\n\nOn May 16, the film also opened at number one in twelve other countries, grossing $22.1 million, and bringing the worldwide opening total to about $77 million. The film opened in Russia with $6.7 million, the biggest opening of the year; it earned $6.3 million (15% more than the first) in Mexico; $4 million in South Korea, making it in the third-most-successful Disney film there; $2 million from India, which was triple the gross of the first; and it earned $1.1 million in Malaysia, making it the country's third-most-popular Disney film after the \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" sequels. The film also opened with $1 million in Argentina on June 13, which was Disney's third-biggest opening in the country and the biggest of 2008 at that time. \"Prince Caspian\" made $141.6 million in the United States and Canada while the worldwide total stands at $419.7 million. The movie was the tenth-highest-grossing film of 2008 worldwide, and was Disney's second-highest-grossing film of 2008 after \"WALL-E\".\n\n"}

The months leading up to it saw hasty but major improvements in the defense of the castle, as Hideyoshi's intentions became clear. Thus, despite the overwhelming force brought to bear by Hideyoshi, the siege saw little actual fighting.\n\nThe massive army of Toyotomi Hideyoshi surrounded the castle in what has been called \"the most unconventional siege lines in samurai history.\" The samurai were entertained by everything: from concubines, prostitutes and musicians to acrobats, fire-eaters, and jugglers. The defenders slept on the ramparts with their arquebuses and armor; despite their smaller numbers, they discouraged Hideyoshi from attacking. So, for the most part, this siege consisted of traditional starvation tactics. Only a few small skirmishes erupted around the castle, as when a group of miners from Kai Province dug under the castle walls, allowing men under Ii Naomasa to enter.\n\nAfter three months, the Hōjō surrendered by losing the will to fight by the sudden appearance of Ishigakiyama Ichiya Castle. Tokugawa Ieyasu, one of Hideyoshi's top generals, was given the Hōjō lands. Though Hideyoshi could not have guessed it at the time, this would turn out to be a great stepping-stone towards Tokugawa's attempts at conquest and the office of Shōgun.\n\nIn addition to taking Odawara Castle, Hideyoshi also defeated the Hōjō at their outposts at Hachiōji Castle, Hachigata Castle, and Shizuoka in and near the southwestern part of the Kantō region. The Chiba, allies of the Hōjō in Shimōsa, also saw Sakura Castle fall to Honda Tadakatsu and Sakai Ietsugu of the Tokugawa army during the campaign. Chiba Shigetane, \"daimyō\" of the Chiba, surrendered the castle to the besieging forces on the condition that his clan would not be abolished. While the Chiba were consequently divested of all of their holdings, many of their senior members were taken into service by Tokugawa retainer Ii Naomasa, thanks to aid he had received many years earlier from the clan during the occupation of Takeda Katsuyori's Tsutsujigasaki Castle.\n\nThe tea master Yamanoue Sōji was at the service of the Odawara lords. He was sentenced to death in a tortuous way.\n\nThe Siege of Odawara is the climax of Hideyoshi's story in the video game \"Samurai Warriors 2\". Due to the sheer size of Odawara Castle in the game, it is divided into two stages, the eastern side besieged by the Tokugawa, Chōsokabe (in Xtreme Legends only), Shimazu, and Date armies, and the western side besieged by the Toyotomi main army.\n\nIn the Sengoku Basara Season 2 anime, Odawara Castle was the setting for the fight between Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Date Masamune. Hideyoshi was killed in the castle at Masamune's hands. Afterward, Ishida Mitsunari went to the castle to grieve his master's demise.\n\n"}

Written by Andrew Marshall and David Renwick, it was first broadcast on BBC1 in 1993. It comprised four episodes, each 45 minutes long, and was broadcast only once, apart from the first episode, which was repeated on BBC Four on 3 December 2007 as part of \"David Renwick Night\". The title is a reference to 'if you see Sid, tell him', the slogan used for the sale of shares in British Gas plc.\n\nThe series is set in London and follows the character of Godfrey Spry, played by Briers. As he is standing outside the post office, a wheelbarrow full of building rubble falls on top of him, causing serious physical injuries (from which he recovers) and leaving him with a greatly reduced attention span. As a result, he spends most of his time watching television commercials, and believes every claim made by them. After seeing an advertisement for a car, he proceeds to copy it by test-driving the same car at high speed along the top of a cliff at sunset, the resulting accident leaving him paralysed.\n\nHe convinces his wife to take a relaxing break with him in Hamburg, which he describes to the viewer in idyllic terms, before casually mentioning that on the last night his wife 'popped out [of the hotel] for a packet of cough sweets and was stoned to death by a mob of drunken soccer fans'. This entire back-story is played out very early in episode one, with the main part of the series starting with Godfrey calling his nephew Gordon for help after his wife's death.\n\nEvery episode was punctuated by deadpan parody advertisements for fictional products and companies, often juxtaposing the idealistic view of the adverts with the far bleaker reality. Much of the humour of the show derived from Godfrey's cheery interpretations of unpleasant events and circumstances. One memorable scene involves him cheerfully passing a group of people outside his neighbour's flat, blissfully unaware that he has driven the man to suicide, attributing the man's disappearance to him moving up the property ladder.\n\nIn a later episode, Godfrey befriends a young school-boy after offering to purchase for him some age-restricted craft material. Godfrey however has a very bad influence on the boy and his school friends, as they become a gang of shoplifters who become news media with an unidentified elderly man as the suspected ring-leader. Eventually the children are apprehended by the police, and an elderly member of the black community - who is also paraplegic - is mistaken for Godfrey and arrested; mass riots result in protest.\n\nIn the last episode, after seeing government advertisements promoting free-enterprise, Godfrey sets up his own business in Gordon and Muriel's house, hiring an elderly lady he met in hospital to knit tea-cosies in the shed. When she falls dead of a heart attack, Godfrey attempts to perform a post mortem, which he believes himself to be an expert in after purchasing a partwork of Complete Medical Knowledge. As a result, he is arrested for murder.\n\nAt the trial, Gordon makes an impassioned plea, claiming that it is not Godfrey who should be on trial, but the advertisers who are murdering all of our minds. Godfrey is convicted and sent to a hospital for the criminally insane; languishing in his cell, he is happy under the illusion that he is the centre of attention at a dinner party, where fancy chocolates are being served.\n\n\n\"The Independent\" wrote: \"It's not really a disaster but there's something decidedly uneven underfoot here, a feeling that this is the working model for a new type of comedy rather than the finished product. [...] while it's sustained with considerable energy by the actors and direction you have to doubt whether it really stands up for one episode, let alone four.\"\n\n\"If You See God, Tell Him\" was released on DVD through 2 entertain on 21 July 2008.\n\n"}

In 1841 he entered the Saint-Cyr military academy, and was commissioned in the French Army in 1843. He was made captain of the 23rd Mobile Guard battalion following the February revolution of 1848, and participated in the suppression of the June Days Uprising which was to later earn him hostility in certain socialist quarters. His support for an anti-Bonapartist demonstration on 29 January 1849 saw him demoted from command of his battalion, and he fled to London after Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte's December 1851 coup.\n\nHe was reinstated as a lieutenant in early 1853 and took part in several expeditions to Algeria. He served in the Crimean War, and was wounded during the siege of Sebastopol. It was at this time that he acquired the nickname of \"Captain Tin Can\", derived from his hoarding of canned meat and bread rations at the expense of his troops. He resigned from the army in July 1858.\n\nAfter brief spells in Northern Algeria and New York City he travelled to Naples in 1860 and participated in the foundation of the De Flotte Legion, a French Corps to assist in the fight for Italian unification, of which he was soon given command. The legion was subsequently disbanded into the Piedmontese army and Cluseret lost his colonelship.\n\nIn 1861 Cluseret returned to America to 'participate in the triumph of freedom'. He served under Fremont and McClellan, and actively lobbied to secure his promotion to the rank of brigadier general, but resigned in March 1863.\n\nFollowing his resignation he co-founded the New York City-based newspaper \"New Nation\" with Fremont, which adopted a radical Republican perspective, criticising Lincoln's gradualist approach to the issue of slavery. After an acrimonious dispute between the two leading to a lawsuit, Cluseret had to pay Fremont a £1,148 fine, although he remained proprietor of the \"New Nation\" for a further year.\n\nIn 1866, the governor of New York, Reuben Fenton, entrusted Cluseret with a mission to organise the Fenian Brotherhood as part of a diversionary plan to undermine British influence in the Mediterranean. He participated in the Fenian insurrection (1866–67), escaping arrest on the collapse of the movement, but was condemned to death in his absence.\n\nHe fled Ireland and arrived in London just after the Reform League's Hyde Park demonstration in 1867. He met a dozen members of the Reform League, including John Bedford Leno, in a private room of the \"White Horse\" in Rathbone Place. He proposed that they create civil war in England and offered the service of two thousand sworn members of the Fenian body, and that he would act as their leader. John Bedford Leno was the first to reply and denounced the proposal, stating that it would surely lead to their \"discomfiture and transportation\", and added that the government would surely hear of the plot. During subsequent speeches Leno noticed that only a matchboard partition divided the room they occupied with another adjoining room, and that voices could be heard the other side. Leno declared his intention to leave at once; the others agreed and the room was soon cleared. The next day the meeting was fully reported in \"The Times\", although Leno's speech had been attributed to George Odgers, who had in fact been the only person to support Cluserat's proposal. John Bedford Leno was fully satisfied with the success the Reform League had met and, being opposed to unnecessary violence, bitterly opposed the interference of Cluseret, as did most of the other members of the Reform League. Cluseret's \"call to arms\" was rejected and he left England for Paris.\n\nHe soon incurred the wrath of the French authorities, serving two months at Sainte-Pélagie Prison for an antimilitarist article published in his newly founded newspaper \"L'Art\". At this time he met several members of the International Workingmen's Association. Although he claimed to have had an interest in socialist ideas since 1848, it appears he did not join the International Workingmen's Association until his detainment, although he later claimed to have been a member since 1865. He made a brief return to America to avoid further imprisonment, arriving back in France upon the proclamation of the Third Republic in 1870.\n\nAfter his initial attempts to obtain a commission in the French army were refused he set to work to organize the social revolution, first at Lyon and afterwards at Marseilles. Mikhail Bakunin placed much of the blame for the failure of the Lyon Commune revolution on Cluseret's refusal to arm the local volunteers. On the news of the Communard rising of 18 March 1871 he hastened to Paris, where he was appointed Delegate of War by the Commune's Executive Commission. He quickly set about reorganising the National Guard, but his attempts to introduce a centralised militarism led to friction with the federalist Central Committee who withdrew their willing co-operation, and routinely censored his proclamations. On April 16 he was elected a member of the commune, and subsequently reelected its Delegate of War. Disagreements with the other leaders of the Commune led to his arrest on the May 1, on a false charge of betraying the cause. On May 21 he appeared before an \"ad hoc\" court and was acquitted. During the occupation of Paris by the Versailles troops he hid at a priest's house, and in November left the city disguised as a priest and crossed into Belgium and from there onto Switzerland where he stayed until 1877. Cluseret published his \"Mémoires\" (of the Commune) at Paris in 1887–88.\n\nFollowing the suppression of the Commune many Communards fled to Geneva. This allowed Cluseret to remain politically active although he was dogged with allegations of being a Prussian spy. His apparently comfortable living conditions were interpreted as a \ngive-away. His time in Geneva was however largely uneventful and with new adventure in mind he departed for the Ottoman Empire in late September 1877 intent on recruiting volunteers to found a republic in Turkey. After several months travelling through the Balkans Cluseret made it to Constantinople, but little is known of his involvement in the Russo-Turkish war.\n\nHe made a brief return to France in 1880 following the amnesty offered to Communards, but again had to flee, this time for penning an article critical of General Ernest Courtot de Cissey. He returned to Constantinople where he stayed until 1886, making a living as an artist and porcelain maker, and providing the US government with a report on Turkish cotton.\n\nAfter his return to France he settled in Hyères, a town near Toulon. In 1888, 1889, 1893 and 1898 he was returned to the Chamber of Deputies as a socialist by the electorate of Toulon, but forfeiting his alliance with the \"Guesdists\" in 1889. This commenced his steady drift away from socialism, leaving the International Workingmen's Association in 1893, and siding with the anti-Dreyfusards during the Dreyfus Affair. From this point on he consistently emphasised nationalist, over socialist perspectives, and regularly engaged in increasingly anti-Semitic diatribes.\n\nCluseret died on August 22, 1900.\n\n\n"}

Since 1649, the term \"rump parliament\" has been used to refer to any parliament left over after the true parliament has formally dissolved.\n\nIn the United States in the 19th century, upon the secession of Virginia from the union on April 27, 1861, anti-secessionist legislators convened a rump legislature and formed a pro-Union reformed government which claimed to represent all of Virginia. This reformed government authorized the creation of the state of Kanawha, later renamed West Virginia.\n\nBy contrast, the Legislative Yuan of Taiwan between 1951 and 1991, having been relocated from Nanking to Taipei when the Republic of China lost its Chinese mainland in late 1949, contained members originally who could not be replaced.

{"id": "1882227", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1882227", "title": "Anabaena", "text": "Anabaena\n\nAnabaena is a genus of filamentous cyanobacteria that exist as plankton. They are known for nitrogen-fixing abilities, and they form symbiotic relationships with certain plants, such as the mosquito fern. They are one of four genera of cyanobacteria that produce neurotoxins, which are harmful to local wildlife, as well as farm animals and pets. Production of these neurotoxins is assumed to be an input into its symbiotic relationships, protecting the plant from grazing pressure.\n\nA DNA sequencing project was undertaken in 1999, which mapped the complete genome of \"Anabaena\", which is 7.2 million base pairs long. The study focused on heterocysts, which convert nitrogen into ammonia. Certain species of \"Anabaena\" have been used on rice paddy fields, proving to be an effective natural fertilizer.\n\nUnder nitrogen-limiting conditions, vegetative cells differentiate into heterocysts at semiregular intervals along the filaments. Heterocyst cells are terminally specialized for nitrogen fixation. The interior of these cells is micro-oxic as a result of increased respiration, inactivation of O-producing photosystem (PS) II, and formation of a thickened envelope outside of the cell wall. Nitrogenase, sequestered within these cells, transforms dinitrogen into ammonium at the expense of ATP and reductant—both generated by carbohydrate metabolism, a process supplemented, in the light, by the activity of PS I. Carbohydrate, probably in the form of glucose, is synthesized in vegetative cells and moves into heterocysts. In return, nitrogen fixed in heterocysts moves into the vegetative cells, at least in part in the form of amino acids.\n\nThe fern \"Azolla\", forms a symbiotic relationship with the cyanobacterium \"Anabaena azollae\", which fixes atmospheric nitrogen, giving the plant access to the essential nutrient. This has led to the plant being dubbed a \"super-plant\", as it can readily colonise areas of freshwater, and grow at great speed - doubling its biomass in as little as 1.9 days. The typical limiting factor on its growth is phosphorus, abundance of which, due to chemical runoff, often leads to \"Azolla\" blooms. Unlike other known plants, the symbiotic microorganism is transferred directly from one generation to the next. This has made \"Anabaena azollae\" completely dependent on its host, as several of its genes are either lost or has been transferred to the nucleus in Azolla’s cells.\n\n\"Anabaena\" is used as a model organism to study simple vision. The process in which light changes the shape of molecules in the retina, thereby driving the cellular reactions and signals that cause vision in vertebrates, is studied in \"Anabaena\". \"Anabaena\" sensory rhodopsin, a specific light-sensitive membrane protein, is central to this research.\n\n\n"}

They were formed in London in 1995 and released their debut single \"Night to Remember\" in May 1996. This was followed by their debut album \"The Journey\" in March 1997, which was certified Gold by the BPI in November 1997. 911 released two more Silver-certified albums, \"Moving On\", which featured the talents of guitarist Nick Cash (real name Keith Lucas) and \"There It Is\", in 1998 and 1999, respectively. \"There It Is\" also produced their only UK number-one single, a cover of \"A Little Bit More\", which topped the UK Singles Chart in January 1999.\n\nIn their five years together, 911 scored ten UK top 10 singles. They sold 10 million singles and 6 million albums around the world, and were very popular in South East Asia, where their first two albums went to number one. They announced their split in February 2000.\n\nIn October 2012, it was announced that 911 would again reunite for the ITV2 reality-documentary series \"The Big Reunion\", along with Atomic Kitten, Liberty X, B*Witched, Five and Honeyz in January 2013. Due to the highly positive reception, the groups went on an arena tour around the UK and Ireland. Their comeback album \"Illuminate... (The Hits and More)\" was released on 8 September 2013, along with their comeback single \"2 Hearts 1 Love\". In early 2014, 911 headlined their own UK tour - The Illuminate: The Hits and More Tour.\n\nDancers Jimmy Constable and Simon \"Spike\" Dawbarn were introduced to each other in the early 1990s by another dancer called Clive. Before long, Constable and Dawbarn were both chosen to work as dancers on the late-night ITV music show \"The Hit Man and Her\". In 1995, after seeing how successful Jason Orange, who used to be a dancer on the show, had been with boy band Take That (and having also become more popular than the acts they were dancing for), Constable and Dawbarn decided to put their own group together. At Carlisle's radio station CFM Radio, they found Steve Gilmour, who had previously managed PJ & Duncan and Boyzone, and asked him to be their manager a few months later. Gilmour initially turned them down as he did not know anything about management, but as time went on, Constable and Dawbarn continued to gain more and more fans. Every time their paths crossed, Constable would show Gilmour the fanmail they were receiving and they were also one of the seven acts to be booked at the Sands Centre in Carlisle, again for CFM. Gilmour had finally become convinced and he decided to manage them but they were short of a singer. Lee Brennan, who had been a fan of Dawbarn and Constable on \"The Hit Man and Her\", was recruited following recommendation by Gilmour. After moving into Gilmour's three-bedroom flat in the south side of Glasgow, 911 embarked on a massive tour of schools and under-18 clubs all over the UK in order to build up their growing army of teenage followers, and fast became crowd favourites on road shows during the Summer of 1995. Despite their immense popularity, they were turned down by every record company they turned to.\n\nIn April 1996, after being unable to secure a major record deal, 911 and their management team Backlash decided to form their own record label, Ginga Records. The following month, they released their debut single, a cover of Shalamar's \"Night to Remember\", and it entered the UK Singles Chart at number 38. In July, their second single \"Love Sensation\", which was later featured in the 1997 live-action film \"\", charted even higher at number 21. The success of these two independently released singles created a major record label bidding war and in September 1996, 911 were signed up by Richard Branson's Virgin Records on a £3.5 million, four-album deal. 911 won GMTV's 'Search for the Next Big Thing' and were voted the 'Second Best Newcomer' after the Spice Girls in \"Smash Hits\".\n\n911 had their first top 10 hit in 1996 with \"Don't Make Me Wait\", which reached number 10. Nine more successive UK top 10 hits followed, including \"Bodyshakin'\" (which became their signature song); \"Private Number\" and the UK chart-topper \"A Little Bit More\". During this time, 911 released three studio albums, \"The Journey\" (1997), \"Moving On\" (1998), \"There It Is\" (1999), all of which hit the top 20 on the UK Albums Chart. They also sold out 35 theatre dates in just 30 minutes for their first headline tour. In Malaysia, \"The Journey\" was number one for 20 weeks and every one of their singles was number one as well.\n\nHowever, after a gruelling schedule the band began to fall apart, with Constable descending into alcoholism (on one occasion appearing on \"SMTV Live\" drunk), Dawbarn beginning to suffer agoraphobia and Brennan, being the pin-up and lead singer of the band, began to feel more and more insecure about his image and looks. At the end of 1999, 911 released a greatest hits album, \"The Greatest Hits and a Little Bit More\", which included (at the time) their final single \"Wonderland\". In February 2000, Dawbarn and Brennan told Constable that they wanted to split up. On \"The Big Reunion\", Dawbarn said: \"We knew we'd reached our peak and we were kind of that little decline and we thought, 'It's best getting out at the top.'\" Constable was also told by the other two that he would be the one to break the news of their break-up live on Chris Moyles' Radio 1 show. In a 2005 interview with \"The Guardian\", Constable: \"I didn't have any time to get my head around it. I had a lump in my throat saying it, then we came out of Radio 1 and the other two guys went to the pub. I got in my car and took off and I never saw them for two years.\"\n\nIn 2008, 911 reformed to a nightclub tour of the UK and Republic of Ireland, performing their most popular hits, and have also performed at a number of nightclub and university events, and they entertained the crowd prior to the Bradford Bulls clash with Leeds Rhinos on 23 May 2008. They took part in Living's \"Pop Goes the Band\"; where they came together to get back to their boy band ways, resulting in a live performance of \"Bodyshakin'\".\n\n911 reunited in 2012, along with Atomic Kitten, Liberty X, B*Witched, Five and Honeyz, for the ITV2 documentary series \"The Big Reunion\", a show which would feature the bands reuniting for the first time in several years and undergoing two weeks of intense rehearsals ahead of a comeback performance some time in 2013. The show began airing on 31 January 2013, and the second episode, which aired on 7 February, featured Lee, Jimmy and Spike talking about their time together and the difficulties that came with being in a band.\n\nThe six bands performed a sold-out comeback concert at London's Hammersmith Apollo on 26 February 2013. However, following the high demand for tickets for the gig and \"The Big Reunion\" pulling in record ratings for ITV2, it was announced that a UK arena tour would be taking place from 3–14 May 2013. Two more dates were later added for 16 and 17 May, taking the tour total to 14 shows. Due to the arena tour quickly selling out as well, it was announced that the bands from the show will also be going on a mini-Christmas party tour in December 2013.\n\nOn 6 March, 911 made an appearance on \"Daybreak\", where they announced that they had recorded a more up-to-date version of \"Bodyshakin'\" and were also planning to release new material. On 28 March, they appeared on \"This Morning\" and confirmed that they would definitely be releasing a new album and touring in 2014. Brennan said: \"We're doing a new album, we're going to be touring ourselves next year, so we've got lots of things to look forward to. Bring It On!\". During The Big Reunion arena tour, it was announced that the band's new album would be called \"Illuminate\". On 3 August, Brennan tweeted that the album, \"Illuminate... (The Hits and More)\", would be released on 9 September 2013 alongside their comeback single \"2 Hearts 1 Love\". During another appearance on \"This Morning\" on 5 August, 911 spoke about their music comeback and also performed \"2 Hearts 1 Love\".\n\nOn 20 March 2014, it was announced that 911 and the other boy bands from both the first and second series of \"The Big Reunion\", Five, Blue, 3T, A1, Damage and 5th Story, would go on a nationwide tour in October 2014.\n\nOn 22 June 2019, 911 made a comeback to South East Asia with their concert known as 911 The Reunion at Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia with a SOLD OUT show.\n\n"}

Pearce OBE (11 October 1941 – 8 September 2005) was Emeritus Professor at the Department of Economics at University College London (UCL). He specialised in, and was a pioneer of, environmental economics, having published over fifty books and over 300 academic articles on the subject, including his 'Blueprint for a Green Economy' series.\n\nDavid Pearce was born in Harrow, London on 11 October 1941, and attended Harrow Weald county grammar school, now part of Harrow College. He graduated in Politics, Philosophy, and Economics from Lincoln College, Oxford in 1963 (1st class) and then studied economics at London School of Economics from 1963 to 1964. He held academic posts at the Universities of Lancaster, Southampton, Leicester (from 1974-1979), and Aberdeen (Chair in political economy until 1983) before arriving at UCL as Professor of Political Economy and later in Economics in 1983, retiring in 2004.\n\nDuring his career he was the chief environmental adviser to the UK Secretaries of State between 1989 and 1992—Christopher Patten and Michael Heseltine. He also provided advice to a number of major companies. He was a convening lead author of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\nHe was co-director of the environmental economics research centre, CSERGE (Centre for Social and Economic Research on the Global Environment), from 1991 to 2001. Pearce also established the internationally renowned MSc in Environmental and Resource Economics at UCL. He was an inspirational teacher held in the highest esteem by the many graduates of this degree, most of whom are now working in environmental policy making and research throughout the world.\n\nPearce married Sue in 1966 and had two sons, Daniel and Corin. He lived latterly in Saffron Walden, Essex.\n\nPearce is best known for setting out economic valuation techniques for natural phenomena, arguing that the environment is \"under-priced\" and that environmental services may be calculated. If they are, their true worth is more likely to be recognised. His early work was on cost-benefit analysis and the economics of pollution and natural resource depletion, before these ideas entered the mainstream of the economic sciences and policymaking. \"Blueprint for Green Economy\" was published in 1989 (with Anil Markandya and Ed Barbier), and was a bestselling work with strong influence on governments in Britain and beyond. It advocated basing policy on the criterion of \"sustainability\", valuing environmental effects, and making use of market incentives. Market-based policies such as pollution taxes, tradable permits and conservation payments have some of their origins in Pearce's work—for example, Britain's landfill tax, the EU's emissions trading scheme and the various mechanisms for international pollution offsets in the Kyoto Protocol.\n\nFor Pearce, sustainability involved each generation passing on at least as much capital as it inherited. Environmental capital describes the stock and the state of natural resources. Economic damage was inevitable but could be controlled through realistic valuation in the market; the price of precious resources, or penalties for damaging them, should be set high (e.g. for noise, waste, global warming, risks to life and health, species conservation and biodiversity). Without this, future generations would suffer.\n\nHis love for nature and his care for the environment resonate through his work. At the same time, he was fiercely critical of environmental alarmism and sloppy environmental policy.. The \"valuation\" of natural phenomena was widely debated and challenged, sometimes by critics who saw Pearce as a supporter of market-based, neoliberal economic policy.\n\nPearce was commissioned by the Construction Research and Innovation Strategy Panel to write a report about the construction industry and after his death, a special issue of the journal Building Research & Information was dedicated to his memory in 2006.\n\n\nDavid Pearce died of leukaemia in September 2005, at the age of 63, only hours after being diagnosed.\n\n"}

It was organized in 1905, established in 1906, and incorporated by the Government of Ontario in 1924 via an \"Act\" in the Ontario Legislature, which split the Agricultural and Horticultural Societies into the Ontario Agricultural Fairs Association and the OHA. Its founding motto was \"Keeping Ontario Beautiful\".\n\nMembership to the Ontario Horticultural Association is granted to those horticultural societies that satisfy the requirements of the Ontario Horticultural Societies Act. Each local society may become an affiliate member of the OHA upon remittance of an affiliation fee, and each receives an annual grant based on paid memberships.\n\nThe OHA consists of 19 districts comprising autonomous local societies in its region. Its executive council has representatives from each district. Each member society defines guidelines for beautification of its community, including planning, development and maintenance of urban parks. Each local society is also responsible for fundraising, organizing conservation programs, and operating youth programs, and sets its own membership fee.\n\nAt inception, the organization was established to promote horticultural practices in the province, with a specific focus on ornamental plants. It did so by organizing shows, staging competitions, and hosting courses to \"interest juniors and others in the study of horticulture\". Today, it is focused on food gardening, for example by promoting the installation of bee nesting boxes by local societies.\n\nThe organization presents nine awards at its annual convention, some of which have been awarded since the organization's establishment. Its most prestigious award is the Silver Medal Award. The Silver Fir Award is given to an individual who demonstrates \"outstanding service\" to the horticultural society in Ontario to which that individual belongs. Others are the Trillium Award, Award of Merit, Community Improvement Award, Environmental Award, Youth Leader Award, and the Honour Roll.\n\nGrants are provided to societies by the OHA for various activities, such as establishing a seed exchange program.\n\nAt the 2014 Fall Convention, it established GardenOntario Week, an annual program organizing horticultural events and activities throughout the province.\n\n\n"}

During his 25-year coaching career at UGA, Dooley compiled a 201–77–10 record. His teams won six Southeastern Conference titles and the 1980 national championship. After the 1980 season, Dooley was recognized as college football's \"Coach of the Year\" by several organizations, including the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association, whose annual award has since been renamed as the Paul \"Bear\" Bryant Award. Dooley's teams were known for their hard nosed defense and conservative yet fundamentally sound offenses. From 1964 to 1980, Dooley was assisted by his defensive coordinator, Erskine \"Erk\" Russell.\n\nDooley grew up in Mobile, Alabama and attended the McGill Institute, administered by the Brothers of the Sacred Heart. Dooley competed on behalf of McGill's athletic teams, known as the Yellow Jackets, and for a few years considered basketball to be his best sport.\n\nDooley is a graduate of Auburn University (bachelor's degree 1954, Master's in history 1963) where he played college football and later coached under Ralph \"Shug\" Jordan. Dooley was a member of the Phi Kappa Theta fraternity as an undergraduate at Auburn. He served as an infantry officer in the United States Marine Corps.\n\nAfter spending the first ten years of his adult life at Auburn, Dooley was hired as head coach at Georgia. In his 25 seasons, he averaged over eight wins a year, won six Southeastern Conference championships (1966, 1968, 1976, 1980, 1981, 1982) and one National Championship in 1980. After the 1980 national championship season, Vince Dooley was offered the head coaching position at Auburn, encouraged by his former Auburn teammate and Alabama Governor Fob James. However, Dooley eventually declined the job, which went to Georgia alumnus Pat Dye. In his first three seasons at Georgia, Vince Dooley went 3–0 versus Georgia Tech's Bobby Dodd. Ironically, Dooley was influenced by Dodd's style and approach to the game, and he was the first recipient of the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award. At the time of his retirement, he was the second-winningest coach in SEC history, behind only Bear Bryant.\n\nBill Dooley, Vince's younger brother, worked on the Georgia Bulldogs football staff before becoming a notable college Head Coach in his own right at the University of North Carolina (from 1967 to 1977), Virginia Tech (from 1978 to 1986) and Wake Forest (from 1987 to 1992). In the December 1971 Gator Bowl, played in Jacksonville, Florida, the two brothers found themselves on opposing sidelines.\n\nVince's son, Derek Dooley, is currently the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach at the University of Missouri. Derek is a former head football coach at both the University of Tennessee (from 2010 to 2012) and Louisiana Tech University (from 2007 to 2009). Derek also served as athletics director during his time at Louisiana Tech (from 2008 to 2010). He is also a former assistant coach for the NFL's Miami Dolphins, the University of Georgia, and LSU.\n\nAfter leading UGA to 201 victories, 6 SEC championships, and one national championship as head football coach, Dooley retired to focus on his post as athletic director, which he had held since 1979. Dooley built Georgia into one of the most successful athletic programs in America. During his time as athletic director he hired former football coach Mark Richt from Florida State University. Dooley briefly pursued the Democratic Party nomination for U.S. Senate in 1986. His wife, the former Barbara Meshad, ran in the Republican Party primary for U.S. House in 2002. Dooley is a member of the Gridiron Secret Society. On December 2, 2009, Kennesaw State University hired Dooley to begin working as a consultant to KSU in the school's drive to start a football program.\n\nAnother hobby of Dooley's is gardening, about which he has published a book.\n\nDooley has also partnered with Mascot Books to publish two children's books about the UGA mascot, \"How 'Bout Them Dawgs!\" and \"Hairy Dawg's Journey Through the Peach State\".\n\nDooley served as Chairman of the Board of Curators for the Georgia Historical Society from 2016-2018.\n\nDooley was inducted in the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame in 1978, the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame in 1984, and the College Football Hall of Fame in 1994. He received the Amos Alonzo Stagg Award, presented by the American Football Coaches Association in 2001. In 2004 the U.S. Sports Academy presented Dooley with the Carl Maddox Sport Management Award, an award given annually to an individual for contribution to the growth and development of sports through management practices. Also in 2004, Dooley was inducted into UGA's Circle of Honor, which is the school's highest tribute to former athletes and coaches. In September 2007, Dooley was given the Homer Rice Award, the highest honor given by the Division I-A Athletic Directors Association. In 2007, Dooley was honored as a Star of the South by Irish America magazine.\n\nDooley was inducted as a Georgia Trustee in 2011. Given by the Georgia Historical Society, in conjunction with the Governor of Georgia, to individuals whose accomplishments and community service reflect the ideals of the founding body of Trustees, which governed the Georgia colony from 1732 to 1752. During a ceremony on January 25, 2013, he was inducted into the Marine Corps Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 2018, the Georgia Historical Society established the Vincent J. Dooley Distinguished Fellows Program in honor of Dooley. The Dooley Distinguished Fellows Program is designed to accomplish two goals consistent with Coach Dooley’s life and legacy: recognizing senior scholars in the field of history and mentoring and developing emerging historians. Historian David Blight and author Rick Atkinson have been named Vincent J. Dooley Distinguished Teaching Fellows.\n\nOn September 7, 2019, the football field at the University of Georgia was renamed \"Dooley Field\" in honor of the coach. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "1882303", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1882303", "title": "Mega Man X (character)", "text": "Mega Man X (character)\n\nMega Man X, or in the games' original Japanese, usually abbreviated to simply \", is a video game character and main protagonist of Capcom's \"Mega Man X\" video game series. Introduced in the 1993 Super Nintendo video game \"Mega Man X\", Mega Man X is an android who, along with his partner Zero and the rest of the Maverick Hunters, protects humans and androids based on his own designs known as Reploids by hunting down rogue Reploids known as Mavericks. He has appeared in multiple printed adaptation of the series as well as an original video animation, \"Day of Sigma\", which explores his early days as a hunter. He is also a supporting character in \"Mega Man Zero\" and \"Mega Man ZX\". Outside the \"Mega Man\" franchise in general, X appeared in multiple crossover games.\n\nThe character was created by Keiji Inafune as a successor to the original Mega Man. In order to make him stand out, he was given a darker characerization as well as multiple set of armors than enhanced his skills in the gameplay. Besides Inafune, X was overseen by artist Hayato Kaji. The character has been voiced by multiple actors in both Japanese and English versions of the franchise.\n\nCritical reaction to X has been generally positive with game journalists often finding him as a worthy successor to Mega Man based on his unique traits. His team up with Zero was also the of praise due to their highly different skill although X was noted to be less popular than his ally.\n\nWhen the Nintendo Entertainment System system began to fade into obscurity in the face of its successor, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Along with the improved graphics engine, Keiji Inafune developed a darker character design and plot, and according to him, he believes that such designs will continue with each new generation of technology. This was mostly because Inafune felt the original Mega Man was too good, so the successor should have \"edge\". In line with the new \"X\" series developed, two characters were created, one being the main character of X, and the inclusion of his partner, Zero. In the original \"Mega Man\" series, Keiji Inafune typically designed the protagonist while his protégé Hayato Kaji handled the supporting characters. However, their roles were reversed for \"Mega Man X\". Kaji (credited as Rippa H.K) illustrated the protagonist X, but had a difficult time with the initial design. He was presented with much more freedom than he was accustomed with the SNES's larger palette of colors when compared to the NES. \n\nInafune and Kaji worked simultaneously on the various designs for X with different pieces of armor attached. The idea for the armor parts came about because the game was planned during a time when role-playing video games were becoming extremely popular. Inafune felt that \"Mega Man\" had always represented a classic action game formula in which the hero earns his defeated enemies' abilities; the armor parts were added to supplement this concept. Inafune created the character Zero, whom he originally intended to be the game's main, playable protagonist. \"When the \"X\" series came out, I really wanted to redesign Mega Man,\" Inafune explained. \"I wanted a totally different Mega Man. I’m a designer, a creator; I wanted something new. I didn’t want to use the same old Mega Man.\" Fearing a negative reaction from fans, Zero was ultimately reduced to a role secondary to Mega Man X. Inafune noted that in early sketches, X and Zero were too similar so Capcom aimed to make their silouhttes contrast one another due to merchandising companies tend to do with their games. Early illustrations of X made him look like \"cold-blooded killer\" so for upcoming games, artists tried making him look a more caring character.\n\nEver since the series' beginning, Haruki Suetsugu was impressed by the handling of the relationship X and Zero had. From his point of view, X was a character who often made mistakes in combat yet tries again in order to improve. As a result, the artist believed he could relate himself with X. While X was written to a \"B class\" Hunter in contrast Zero being \"Special A\" rank making the former less skilled. This allowed him the draw more frequently across the series.Nevertheless, he regretted some of his illustrations as X lacked the cool appeal Zero originally had.\n\nFor the fourth title, Hitoshi Ariga was responsible for designing X's secret featured in both the game after imputing a cheat code and as a Japanese Bandai action figure. He spent four days coming up with the initial blueprint, but was told by his supervisor to go back and try again. After tinkering with the \"Mega Man X3\" armor parts, he noticed that attaching them in specific ways made it look like an airplane. Ariga recounted creating the armor as an extremely difficult yet fun task. He also revealed that Zero was intended to have his own Ultimate Armor, but the development team chose to not finalize it. X's new was designed by Ryuji Higurashi for \"X5\", who wanted it to resemble a bird with beak-shaped chest piece, wings coming out of the back, and a talon-like arm cannon. Suetsugu designed the Gaea Armor, which was meant to resemble Sanagiman from the \"Inazuman\" manga series. Inafune's only contribution to \"Mega Man X7\" was lending advice to the illustrators on creating the new protagonist Axl. Inafune had been careful to make X and Zero unique when he originally designed them, and he wanted to give Axl the same treatment. Suetsugu aimed to make the Blade and Shadow Armors from \"X6\" to look stylish.\n\nThe cover art for the Japanese Saturn version of \"X4\" depicts Zero standing alone in a dark setting. \"Usually, not having the main character on the package would be unheard of,\" Inafune stated. \"But we had a lot of hardcore fans on the Saturn, so I figured it would be all right.\" A \"Special Limited Pack\" edition of the game included the Ultimate Armor X action figure. Another armor based on the Ultimate's design was made for X to wear in the Challenge Mode from the \"Mega Man X\" collections. The three main characters were revised for \"Mega Man X8\" as Yoshikawa aimed to give them more unique features.\n\nFor \"Mega Man X: Command Mission\", Assistant Producer Tatsuya Kitabayashi claimed the staff was a fan of the main character and wanted to alter his design. This was mostly because Capcom felt X looked too simple. The Hyper Mode was exclusive to the playable characters X and Zero. However, because this gave them too large of an advantage over other party members, all other characters were given one Hyper Mode while X and Zero were given two each. The staff noted X's characterization was previously covered in doubts so they decided to make a strong yet also kind character in order to appeal to the fans, turning him \"into a full fledged hero\". Nevertheless, the developers were afraid of negative backlash should the fans find X and Zero too different from their original personas. The redesign involved a \"beam scarf\" that could be produced whenever X performed a dash.\n\nFor \"Mega Man Zero\"s game's main antagonist was a popular topic of discussion during production, and the developer often sought input from Capcom in this regard. Yoshihisa Tsuda jokingly suggested that they make the original Mega Man X the final boss, an idea that was at first accepted. According to Ito, Inti Creates realized that it \"wouldn't sit so well with the young boys and girls that really do see <nowiki>[X]</nowiki> as a hero\", so they replaced him with Copy X just one month before release.\nX and Zero were intended to appear in the cancelled \"Maverick Hunter\". Both Mega Man X and Zero would be featured alongside a new human sidekick who is a \"Bruce Willis-like police officer.\" The inclusion of the human sidekick was part of the game's \"man versus machine contrast.\" It was to be the first of a trilogy of games; players would control X in the first two games while they would switch to Zero in the third game, who must destroy X (who had become \"incredibly powerful and infinitely intelligent over the course of two games\").\n\nX was first voiced in Japanese by Megumi Ogata who considered as a first generation part of her career alongside other series like \"Yu-Gi-Oh!\". Starting \"Mega Man X4\", X was given another voice actor, Kentarō Itō. He was replaced by Showtaro Morikubo for the next works. The third voice actor was Takahiro Sakurai who said he enjoyed voicing X across the crossover \"Project X Zone\" as he remembered X's thoughts, describing him as a serious character as \"He hesitates and agonizes, but always keeps fighting. I still recall those feelings when acting as X. He is always fighting, not just against Mavericks but also something inside himself that he can't avoid.\" Similar to his experience when playing the \"Mega Man X\" games from the Super Nintendo he looked forward to the crossover due to his interactions with other famous famous characters. The X from the \"Mega Man Zero\" and \"ZX\" was given the voice of Takahiro Mizushima.\n\nIn the English dub, X was given multiple voice actors with Ted Sroka doing it in \"Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite\".\n\nIn the original game \"Mega Man X,\" he is the template on which all non-Light model Reploids are based, and he battles against Mavericks to protect humans. He was created by Dr. Thomas Light sometime in 20XX. Light named him X after the variable \"x\" which, in algebraic terms, represents limitless possibility, as do X's advanced systems. Light chose to seal X inside a capsule for 30 years to test the integrity and reliability of X's systems. Dr. Light died before X's diagnostics were complete. X was discovered in his capsule 100 years later by another scientist, Dr. Cain, who attempted to emulate X's technology and, produced the first mass-produced Reploids: humanoid androids based upon X's designs. The Maverick Hunters were formed to combat them, under the leadership of Sigma. However, Sigma becomes Maverick and leads a massive revolt. X decides to stop Sigma, and teams up with Zero, one of the last remaining Hunters. The original video animation, \"The Day of Sigma\", recreats these events before the game begins. \n\nIn the first game from the series, X is defeated by the Maverick Vile but is rescued by Zero. Across the game, X faces multiple Maverick and reaches Sigma's location after defeating Vile with Zero's aid. Following Sigma's defeat at his hands, X continues searching for Mavericks in order to achieve peace. He and Zero also appear as bosses in the game's remake, \"Maverick Hunter X\" should the player unlock Vile. X's constant struggles in regards to defeat new Mavericks causes him to wonder if he is destined to be Zero's enemy fearing the possibily he himself might be going Maverick in his ending from \"Mega Man X4\". By \"Mega Man X5\", X can appear as a boss character in the final stages if the player uses Zero who is considered dangerous for being infected by Sigma. While he continues facing Mavericks infected viruses in \"X6\", X becomes reclutant to continue his missions in \"Mega Man X7\" until he fears Red Alert's forces might result in more casualties. In the latest main title, \"Mega Man X8\", X is playable alongside Zero and Axl who end shocked when they discover that in the future all Reploids will become copies of Sigma. As a result, they fear that the war will be neverending. \n\nX also appears in the spin-offs \"Mega Man Xtreme\" facing Maverick Hunters have partnered with a computer genius named Middy, \"Mega Man Xtreme 2\" facing a \"Soul Eraser\" named Berkana to resurrect a growing army of undead Mavericks from the past. In \"Mega Man X: Command Mission\", X gathers a resistance team led to assist in defeating the minions of the Rebellion Army. A mobile phone game also has X as a playable character. Although \"Mega Man X8\" was released by the time of the mobile, Capcom chose X's previous look due to it being more wellknown.\n\nX also reprises his role from the first game in three mangas by Iwamoto Yoshihiro, as its prequel \"Irregular Maverick Hunter X\" by Ikehara Shigeto.\n\nOutside the \"Mega Man X\", X is present in the sequel series \"Mega Man Zero\". The amnesiac Zero finds himself under the idea that his friend X has conquered the world until a scientist named Ciel reveals he is a copy she created. The real X appears in the ending, asking Zero to take his place on the battlefield, having become tired of fighting. In the direct sequel, Elpizo destroys X's body but his mind remains active until he fades away in \"Mega Man Zero 3\".\n\nX appeared in the \"Mega Man\" episode \"Mega X\" voiced by Michael Donovan. He follows Vile and Spark Mandrill to the present to stop them from taking Lightanium back to their own time to help Sigma finance his wars against humans. Like Mega Man, X has the ability to copy weapons from enemies by touching them, as he is seen copying Snake Man's weapon to destroy Dr. Wily's plasma cannon. \n\nAn X outfit can be unlocked and worn by the character Frank West in \"Dead Rising\", who also uses it as part of his hyper combo in \"\" and also appears as Frank's DLC costume in \"Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3.\" Zero was chosen to represent the \"Mega Man\" franchise over Mega Man or X himself in \"Marvel vs. Capcom 3\", as director Ryota Niitsuma thought he had more variation in his moves. X himself also appears in Zero's ending. Also, X appears as a cameo in Zero's appearance in \".\" A DLC costume with the look of X. X also appears in \"Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U\" as part of Mega Man's Final Smash. Mii Gunners also have access to X's armor through paid DLC in both versions. X is also seen along with Zero in \"Project X Zone\" and its sequel. X himself is a playable character in \"\" and \"Puzzle Fighter\" For \"Infinte\", X was also included due to his large popularity within the Western audience and was given his \"Command Mission\" design as an alternate skin. He also appears in the card game \"Teppen\".\n\nInitial reaction to X has been positive. \"US Gamer\" found him as a worthy successor to the original Mega Man based on his own skills such as dashes or tanks that increase the character's health bar. \"GamesRadar\" liked X's design, enjoying how in games he wears different armors that upgraded his skills while in some early titles he provides tribute to the \"Street Fighter\" characters by performing their techniques. \"Nintendo Life \"called found his design as a \"more mature and gritty design\" since Capcom's original Mega Man was getting tiring due to the team producing multiple games for his series. \"IGN\" provided similar comments in regards to X's skills as a \"a great touch\" due to how powerful the character can become. \"Push Square\" agreed with the critics \"fresh\" concepts that Capcom needed to provide in order to sell more video games.\n\n\"GameFan\" praised the new armor design provided for \"Mega Man X2\", finding it more visually appealing than the original. \"Destructoid\" enjoyed how across the series X retains some old skills from the early games that could only be achieved through upgrades while also enjoying his variety of armors in \"Mega Man X3\". \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" found X's actions too repetitive in the series by the third title.\"Game Informer\" had mixed thoughts about X's handling in the series, praising his multiple visual appearance and usage of weapons but critcizing his child-like voice from \"Mega Man X4\" when he is suppposed to be a robot who has fought in multiple wars something which \"Electronic Game Monthly\" agreed with. His voice actor for \"Maverick Hunter X\" was also criticized for always sounding angry. On the other hand, \"GameZone\" praised Mark Gatha's acting as X due to how he interacts with the bosses.\n\nBy \"Mega Man X4\", critics praised the varitey of having Zero besides X as protagonists as their different fighting styles gave more variety to the series. \"1UP.com\" stated fans of the series would be displeased by the fact that in \"Mega Man X7\", X cannot be used and his replacement, Axl, is unlikable. \"GameSpy\" agreed, finding X's desire to leave the battlefield comical as he also grew tired of the series' formula additionally. \"Destructoid\" shared similar comments stating fans might dislike X being unplayable during the game's early stages something which improved by \"Mega Man X8\" where X returns as playable by the beginning. GameSpot disliked the design of the trio of main characters by \"X8\" due to the noise they tend to make. In regards to X's role from \"Command Mission\", X was praised by \"GameSpy\" due to the series giving him a more elaborated storyline and more experienced characterization though common in role-playing games. In general, the cast was praised for their designs. Nevertheless, \"US Gamer\" found the premise in regards to X's actions in the \"Zero\" series to be interesting considering Zero as a breakout character due to his large popularity in contrast to X's. \"GamesRadar\" regarded both X and Zero \"crossover veterans\" based on their multiple appearances and looked forward to their team up in \"Project X Zone\" where the duo teamed up for the first time in a crossover. \"Game Informer\" considered X and Zero as one of his favorite characters in gaming, and thus wanted to play as them in \"Project X Zone 2\".\n\nClint Mize wrote an article for MTV.com's gaming section detailing why \"Maverick Hunter\" was a terrible idea. He felt that it could have turned off \"core fans\" of the \"Mega Man X\" series and that X required a \"solid core title to reintroduce the character\" rather than a \"dark reimagining\". In regards to X's powers, \"Game Informer\" claimed X had the best weaponry in his introduction and that if Capcom were to make another \"Mega Man X\", X's weaponry should be based on it. In regards to armors, \"Game Informer\" picked X's armors from \"X6\" as the best ones in the series citing the stylish pattern of the Shadow Armor that makes him do ninja techniques while the Falcoon Armor was cited as useful based on its powers.\n\nX's addition to the \"Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite\" cast was prove to be popular according to \"Polygon\" who noted that, while people were excited with his inclusion and give his series a new installment to his series, he was poorly treated in the game's demo where he defeated by the antagonist Ultron Sigma.\n\nGeneral\nSpecfic\n"}

{"id": "1882343", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1882343", "title": "Public goods game", "text": "Public goods game\n\nThe public goods game is a standard of experimental economics. In the basic game, subjects secretly choose how many of their private tokens to put into a public pot. The tokens in this pot are multiplied by a factor (greater than one and less than the number of players, N) and this \"public good\" payoff is evenly divided among players. Each subject also keeps the tokens they do not contribute.\n\nThe group's total payoff is maximized when everyone contributes all of their tokens to the public pool. However, the Nash equilibrium in this game is simply zero contributions by all; if the experiment were a purely analytical exercise in game theory it would resolve to zero contributions because any rational agent does best contributing zero, regardless of whatever anyone else does. This only holds if the multiplication factor is less than the number of players, otherwise the Nash equilibrium is for all players to contribute all of their tokens to the public pool.\n\nIn fact, the Nash equilibrium is rarely seen in experiments; people do tend to add something into the pot. The actual levels of contribution found varies widely (anywhere from 0% to 100% of initial endowment can be chipped in). The average contribution typically depends on the multiplication factor. Capraro has proposed a new solution concept for social dilemmas, based on the idea that players forecast if it is worth to act cooperatively and then they act cooperatively in a rate depending on the forecast. His model indeed predicts increasing level of cooperation as the multiplication factor increases.\n\nDepending on the experiment's design, those who contribute below average or nothing are called \"defectors\" or \"free riders\", as opposed to the contributors or above average contributors who are called \"cooperators\".\n\n\"Repeat-play\" public goods games involve the same group of subjects playing the basic game over a series of rounds. The typical result is a declining proportion of public contribution, from the simple game (the \"One-shot\" public goods game). When trusting contributors see that not everyone is giving up as much as they do they tend to reduce the amount they share in the next round. If this is again repeated the same thing happens but from a lower base, so that the amount contributed to the pot is reduced again. However, the amount contributed to the pool rarely drops to zero when rounds of the game are iterated, because there tend to remain a hard core of ‘givers’.\n\nOne explanation for the dropping level of contribution is inequity aversion. During repeated games players learn their co-player's inequality aversion in previous rounds on which future beliefs can be based. If players receive a bigger share for a smaller contribution the sharing members react against the perceived injustice (even though the identity of the “free riders” are unknown, and it's only a game). Those who contribute nothing in one round, rarely contribute something in later rounds, even after discovering that others are.\n\nTransparency about past choices and payoffs of group members affects future choices.  Studies show individuals in groups can be influenced by the group leaders, whether formal or informal, to conform or defect. Players signal their intentions through transparency which allows “conditional operators” to follow the lead. If players are informed of individual payoffs of each member of the group it can lead to a dynamic of players adopting the strategy of the player who benefited the most (contributed the least) in the group. This can lead a drop in cooperation through subsequent iterations of the game. However, if the amount contributed by each group member is not hidden, the amount contributed tends to be significantly higher. The finding is robust in different experiment designs: Whether in \"pairwise iterations\" with only two players (the other player's contribution level is always known) or in nominations after the end of the experiment.\n\nThe option to punish non-contributors and to reward the highest contributions after a round of the public goods game has been the issue of many experiments. Findings strongly suggest that non-rewarding is not seen as sanction, while rewards don't substitute punishment. Rather they are used completely differently as a means to enforce cooperation and higher payoffs.\n\nPunishing is exercised, even at a cost, and in most experiments it leads to greater group cooperation. However, since punishment is costly, it tends to lead to (marginally) lower payoffs, at least initially. On the other hand, a 2007 study found that rewards alone could not sustain long-term cooperation.\n\nMany studies therefore emphasize the combination of (the threat of) punishment and rewards. The combination seems to yield both a higher level of cooperation and of payoffs. This holds for iterated games in changing groups as well as in identical groups.\n\nAsymmetric cost and or benefit functions have direct influence in the contribution behaviour of agents. When confronted with different payoff returns to their contributions, agents behave differently though they still contribute more than in Nash equilibrium.\n\nA public goods games variant suggested as an improvement for researching the free rider problem is one in which endowment are earned as income. The standard game (with a fixed initial endowments) allows no work effort variation and cannot capture the marginal substitutions among three factors: private goods, public goods, and leisure.\n\nResearchers have found that in an experiment where an agent's wealth at the end of period t serves as her endowment in t+1, the amounts contributed increase over time even in the absences of punishment strategies.\n\nA different framing of the original neutral experiment setting induces players to act differently because they associate different real-life situations. For example, a public good experiment could be presented as a climate negotiation or as contributions to private parties.\n\nThe effect of associations (label frame) depends on the experience-pool the player made with similar real-life frames. This is especially true for one-shot (not iterated) games where players can only infer others’ behavior and expectations from their life experiences. Therefore, the same frame can induce more and also less contribution, even in similar cultures. Label frames move beliefs i.e. about other player's behaviour, and these beliefs subsequently shape motivation and choice.\n\nAlso, the same game structure can always be presented as a gain or a loss game. Because of the Framing effect players respond completely differently when it is presented as a gain or a loss. If public good games are presented as a loss, i.e. a player's contribution in a \"private\" engagement diminishes other player's payoff, contributions are significantly lower.\n\nFor contribution to be privately \"irrational\" the tokens in the pot must be multiplied by an amount smaller than the number of players and greater than 1. Other than this, the level of multiplication has little bearing on strategy, but higher factors produce higher proportions of contribution.\n\nWith a large group (40) and very low multiplication factor (1.03) almost no-one contributes anything after a few iterations of the game (a few still do). However, with the same size group and a 1.3 multiplication factor the average level of initial endowment contributed to the pot is around 50%.\n\nThe name of the game comes from economist’s definition of a “public good”. One type of public good is a costly, \"non-excludable\" project that every one can benefit from, regardless of how much they contribute to create it (because no one can be excluded from using it - like street lighting). Part of the economic theory of public goods is that they would be under-provided (at a rate lower than the ‘social optimum’) because individuals had no private motive to contribute (the free rider problem). The “public goods game” is designed to test this belief and connected theories of social behaviour.\n\nThe empirical fact that subjects in most societies contribute anything in the simple public goods game is a challenge for game theory to explain via a motive of total self-interest, although it can do better with the ‘punishment’ variant, or the ‘iterated’ variant; because some of the motivation to contribute is now purely “rational”, if players assume that others may act irrationally and punish them for non-contribution.\n\nThe sociological interpretation of these results emphasizes group cohesion and cultural norms to explain the \"prosocial\" outcomes of public goods games.\n\n\n\n"}

He is of Barbadian descent.\n\nBorn in Paddington, London, Andrews began his career at Watford, where he made his debut as a substitute in a 2–1 win against Bournemouth on 17 August 1996. He made his first league start 10 days later in a 2–0 defeat to Plymouth Argyle. He scored his first goal for Watford in a 2–0 win over Walsall on 3 September 1996 in a League Cup tie, and scored his first league goal in a 3–2 win over Notts County one week later. His first season ended having scored five goals in 29 appearances in all competitions.\n\nAfter making two league and two cup appearances for the Hornets in the 1997–98 season, Andrews suffered a broken ankle, leaving him out of action for seven months.\n\nOn his return from injury, Andrews was loaned out to both Cambridge United and Peterborough United in the 1998–99 season. He made only two appearances for Cambridge in October 1998, before joining Peterborough in February 1999. He made an immediate impact for the club, scoring four goals in a 5–2 victory over Barnet on his debut. He went on to make ten appearances for Peterborough, scoring only once more during his spell.\n\nAndrews was released from his Watford contract in April 1999 and joined St Albans City for one season, later spending a year at Aldershot Town and then one season with Chesham United.\n\nIn May 2002, Andrews signed for Oldham Athletic on a one-year deal. At Chesham, he played under Bob Dowie, brother of Iain, who was at the time assistant manager at Oldham.\n\nAndrews made his Latics debut on 31 August in a 2–0 defeat to Wycombe Wanderers. He scored his first goal for Oldham on 14 September from the penalty spot in a 6–1 win over Mansfield Town.\n\nHaving scored 11 goals in 38 league appearances and with Oldham reaching the play-offs, Andrews was sent off for violent conduct in the second leg of their play-off semi-final defeat against Queens Park Rangers on 14 May 2003. In May 2003, Andrews was released by Oldham, despite having been offered a new contract.\n\nOn 1 July 2003, Andrews joined Colchester United on a two-year contract. He made his home debut in a traditional pre-season friendly with neighbours Ipswich Town, a game which ended 3–0 to Ipswich. He scored on his full debut, coming on as a substitute in a 4–3 away defeat to Port Vale on 23 August.\n\nAndrews started the season brightly, scoring four goals in his first six matches for Colchester, and also scored a goal in five consecutive games between 21 October and 15 November. He scored 14 goals in 50 appearances for Colchester in the 2003–04 season.\n\nOn 1 September 2004, immediately before the transfer deadline, Andrews transferred to Premier League side Crystal Palace, who were managed by former Oldham manager Iain Dowie. He signed for a six-figure fee in the region of £100,000, with Gareth Williams joining Colchester in part-exchange.\n\nHe made his Palace debut on 11 December 2004, coming on as a 53rd-minute substitute for Aki Riihilahti in a 0–0 draw with Blackburn Rovers. Andrews made nine appearances in his first season with Crystal Palace, failing to score a goal.\n\nAndrews featured more regularly for the team following their relegation from the Premier League, making 31 appearances in all competitions, but scoring only once. In May 2006, Andrews was released from Crystal Palace with a record of one goal scored in 33 league games.\n\nOn 3 June 2006, Andrews signed for Championship rivals Coventry City on a three-year contract. His time with Coventry did not start well after suffering a fractured ankle in a pre-season friendly defeat against Boavista on 30 July. Andrews had scored Coventry's goal in the 2–1 defeat.\n\nAndrews made his debut on 28 October, coming on as a substitute in the 83rd minute and scoring in the 84th, away at Barnsley to win the game 1–0. This was to be his only goal scored for Coventry.\n\nAfter making only three appearances for Coventry, Andrews went out on loan to Sheffield Wednesday on a month-long deal. He made nine appearances for the club, scoring only one goal, his second against Barnsley.\n\nIn January 2007, Andrews was loaned to Bristol City for an initial month-long deal. He scored on his debut for Bristol in a 3–0 win against former club Oldham the following day. He then scored in his next game during a 2–0 Football League Trophy win against Brighton on 23 January. On 31 January, his loan with Bristol was extended to the end of the season. He scored one further goal for City against Blackpool in a 1–0 victory on 17 February, bringing his total to three goals in ten matches.\n\nOn 1 October 2007, Andrews signed for Leeds United on a one-month loan deal. He was recruited following a string of injuries and suspensions for Jermaine Beckford, Trésor Kandol, Leon Constantine and Tore André Flo. He made two appearances for Leeds, playing once in the league, a 1–0 win over former club Oldham, and a 1–0 win over Darlington in the League Trophy. He failed to impress at Leeds and was returned to Coventry after the expiry of his deal.\n\nIn March 2008, Andrews was released at the end of his contract with Coventry City. A few days later, he signed on loan for Bristol Rovers until the end of the season. Andrews lasted just 17 minutes for Bristol Rovers as he was stretchered off with an injury to his knee ligaments.\n\nAfter his release from Coventry, Bristol Rovers had looked to sign Andrews, if he proved his fitness during pre-season. The club set a deadline for him to prove his fitness by the end of July. He had missed some of his rehabilitation from injury as Coventry had already announced he was to be released at the end of his contract with them.\n\nFollowing his failed trial with Bristol Rovers, Andrews began training with Luton Town and he was offered a contract in October 2008. After ten appearances and no goals for Luton, Andrews was released in January 2009.\n\nYeovil Town took Andrews on trial in February 2009, but the club did not offer him a contract.\n\n"}

E. Littlewood to help teach the essentials of measure theory in mathematical analysis.\n\nLittlewood stated the principles in his 1944 \"Lectures on the Theory of Functions\"\n\nas:\nThe first principle is based on the fact that the inner measure and outer measure are equal for measurable sets, the second is based on Lusin's theorem, and the third is based on Egorov's theorem.\n\nLittlewood's three principles are quoted in several real analysis texts, for example Royden,\nBressoud,\nand Stein & Shakarchi.\n\nRoyden gives the bounded convergence theorem as an application of the third principle. The theorem states that if a uniformly bounded sequence of functions converges pointwise, then their integrals on a set of finite measure converge to the integral of the limit function. If the convergence were uniform this would be a trivial result, and Littlewood's third principle tells us that the convergence is almost uniform, that is, uniform outside of a set of arbitrarily small measure. Because the sequence is bounded, the contribution to the integrals of the small set can be made arbitrarily small, and the integrals on the remainder converge because the functions are uniformly convergent there.\n"}

{"id": "1882367", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1882367", "title": "Jerzy Skolimowski", "text": "Jerzy Skolimowski\n\nJerzy Skolimowski (, born 5 May 1938) is a Polish film director, screenwriter, dramatist and actor. A graduate of the prestigious National Film School in Łódź, Skolimowski has directed more than twenty films since his 1960 début \"Oko wykol\" (\"The Menacing Eye\"). In 1967 he was awarded the Golden Bear prize for his film \"Le départ\". His most famous film is \"Deep End\" (1970), starring Jane Asher and John Moulder Brown. He lived in Los Angeles for over 20 years where he painted in a figurative, expressionist mode and occasionally acted in films. He returned to Poland, and to film making as a writer and director, after a 17-year hiatus with \"Cztery noce z Anną\" (\"Four Nights with Anna\") in 2008. He received the Golden Lion Award for Lifetime Achievement at the 2016 Venice Film Festival.\n\nSkolimowski was born in Łódź, Poland, the son of Maria (née Postnikoff) and Stanisław Skolimowski, an architect. He often recognized indications in his work to a childhood ineradicably scarred by the War. As a small child he witnessed the brutalities of war, even having been rescued from the rubble of a bombed-out house in Warsaw. His father, a member of the Polish Resistance, was executed by the Nazis. His mother hid a Jewish family in the house and Skolimowski recalls being required to take candy from the Nazis to maintain appearances.\n\nAfter the war, his mother became the cultural attaché of the Polish embassy in Prague. His fellow pupils at school in Poděbrady, a spa town near Prague, included future film-makers Miloš Forman and Ivan Passer, as well as Václav Havel.\n\nSkolimowski was considered as a trouble maker at school as he was the origin of many pranks which angered the authorities. At college he studied ethnography, history and literature and took up boxing, which was also the subject of a feature-length documentary, his first significant film. Skolimowski's interest in jazz and association with composer Krzysztof Komeda brought him into contact with actor Zbigniew Cybulski and directors Andrzej Munk and Roman Polanski.\n\nIn his early twenties Skolimowski was already a writer, having published several books of poems, short stories and a play. Soon Skolimowski met Andrzej Wajda, the leading director of the then dominant 'Polish school' and twelve years his senior, who showed him a script for a film about youth written by Jerzy Andrzejewski, the author of the novel \"Ashes and Diamonds\". Skolimowski was not impressed and dismissed the script. However, in response to a challenge by Wajda, he produced his own version which became a basis for the finished film, \" Innocent Sorcerers \" (1960), directed by Wajda with Skolimowski playing a boxer.\n\nSkolimowski enrolled in the Łódź Film School with the intention of avoiding the long apprenticeship required before graduating to feature film direction. He used the film stock available to him for student exercises, and with initial advice from Andrzej Munk, he filmed over several years in such a way that the sequences were later clipped off and joined together into one piece of work. While scoring poorly in course work Skolimowski had a finished feature film by the end of the course.\n\nSkolimowski then collaborated with Polański, writing the dialogue for the script of \"Knife in the Water\" (1962).\n\nBetween 1964 and 1984 he completed six semi-autobiographical feature films: \"\", \"Walkover\", \"Barrier\" (1966), \"Hands Up!\" (completed 1967, released 1981), \"Moonlighting\" (GB 1982) and \"Success Is the Best Revenge\", a segment in \"Dialóg\" and two other features \"Le Départ\" (1967) and \"Deep End\" based on his original screenplays. \"Barrier\" won Grand Prix at Bergamo International Film Festival. \"Le Départ\" won the Golden Bear at the 17th Berlin International Film Festival.\n\nWhile living and working in many countries, he also completed another six relatively big budget productions, including four international co-productions, between 1970 and 1992 (\"The Adventures of Gerard\", \"King, Queen, Knave\", \"The Shout\", \"The Lightship\", \"Torrents of Spring\" and \"Ferdydurke\"), all distinctly bearing Skolimowski’s signature.\n\nAfter \"Barrier\" he left Poland to make \"Le Départ\" in Belgium in French. According to him \"Le Départ\" was a light film rather than a comedy, \"\"does not have the serious layers that I like in my work.\"\" Skolimowski returned to Poland to make \"Ręce do góry\" (\"Hands Up!\"), the third film of the Andrzej trilogy and the fourth of his Polish sextet. The anti-Stalinist themes of \"Hands Up!\" resulted in that film being banned and him being effectively expelled from then communist Poland. He then resettled in London, notably having Jimi Hendrix as a neighbor in the same building.\n\nBetween \"Hands Up!\" and his next feature, Arthur Conan Doyle’s \"The Adventures of Gerard\" (1970), Skolimowski contributed a story to a Czech-produced portmanteau film, \"Dialóg 20-40-60\" (1968), in which three different directors (with Zbyněk Brynych and Peter Solan) each devised their own story using identical dialogue even though the central characters in each section are separated in age by twenty years. Skolimowski's segment, \"The Twenty Year Olds\", would seem to be an extension of \"Le départ\" with Jean-Pierre Léaud playing opposite Skolimowski's wife Joanna Szczerbic.\n\n\"Deep End\" (1970) was Skolimowski's second non-Polish feature to be based on his own original screenplay. The movie with a coming of age storyline bears distinctive thematic similarities to \"Le Départ\". \"Deep End\" was a promising film yet it was poorly handled by the studio. His films \"The Shout\" (1978) and \"Moonlighting\" (1982) became critical successes, with \"Moonlighting\", made in the UK and starring Jeremy Irons, the fifth of his Polish sextet, being critically and commercially his most successful film.\n\n\"The Lightship\", Skolimowski’s first US production, was adapted from a novella by the German writer Siegfried Lenz and starring Robert Duvall and Klaus Maria Brandauer. Set on a US Coast Guard ship it was filmed in the North Sea. It is suspended between psychological duel with a doppelgänger theme and a pure performance piece within the stage-like confines of the lightship. However, even though receiving the best film award at the Venice Film Festival, \"The Lightship\" had only a very limited release.\n\n\"Torrents of Spring\" (1989), adapted from a semi-autobiographical novella by Russian author Ivan Turgenev, was a big budget European co-production starring Timothy Hutton, Nastassja Kinski and Valeria Golino. It could be considered as Skolimowski's most impersonal 'generic' film, the only real departure from his expressed interest in making films only to please himself.\n\nSkolimowski is also an actor, having appearances as Colonel Chaikov, a ruthless yet composed KGB colonel, in \"White Nights\" (1985) and Uncle Stepan, a Russian expatriate in \"Eastern Promises\" (2007), among other roles. In 2012, he appeared in \"The Avengers\", as a villain interrogating Black Widow.\n\nIn July 2016, at the Venice Film Festival, Skolimowski was honoured with the Golden Lion for \"lifetime achievement\".\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nIt is away from the Philippine capital Manila and is part of Manila's conurbation which reaches San Ildefonso in its northernmost part.\n\nIn the 18th century, the municipalities now known as Meycauayan, Valenzuela (formerly Polo) and Obando comprised only one town, the Municipality of Meycauayan. The town of Polo and Obando, formed a barrio called Catanghalan. In the year 1623, the municipality of Polo was organized which included the present-day territories of the Town of Obando. By virtue of a decree promulgated during the time of Governor and Captain General of the Archipelago, Francisco Jose de Obando y Solis, the town was created and separated from its mother town Polo on May 14, 1753. In the Governor's untimely death at the hands of the British during the Seven Years' War, the creation and establishment of the town was made and attended by the Alcalde Mayor of the province, Don Francisco Morales y Mozabe, the Provincial Minister, S. Gregorio, Rev. Fr. Alejandro Ferrer, together with numerous religious devotees. The minister who was chosen to administer the town was Rev. Fr. Manuel De Olivencia.\n\nIn 1907, Obando was made an independent town of Bulacan. Then through the untiring efforts of the municipal officials, a portion of Gasak, Navotas was reclaimed to form a part of Obando. The municipal officials, believing that this portion was once a part of the municipality but was adopted by Navotas in the course of time, effortlessly pushed through its claim to regain the area. The concerted action of all those concerned paid off when on January 30, 1975, by virtue of a Presidential Decree No. 646, a portion of approximately 1.78 square kilometers of Gasak, Navotas was returned to Obando. This is mostly fishpond and sandy beach and believed that when fully developed, this will serve as a good tourist attraction. By resolution of 1975 Municipal Council, the area was made into a barangay and named it Nuestra Señora de Salambao in honor of one of its patron saints.\n\nObando is bordered by Valenzuela City in the east, Navotas City and Malabon City in the south, Bulakan in the north, and the waters of Manila Bay in the west.\n\nFlat and low-lying coastal plains characterize the general topography of Obando. The area was formerly an estuary, but it filled up partially from the peripheral parts of each sand bar and sand spit and formed up into current figure that mainly consisted of commercial district, partly industrial district, residential area and fishpond. Within the municipality are two rivers and three creeks namely Meycauayan River, in the north, Pinagkabalian River, in the south and Paco Creek, Hulo Creek and Pag-asa Creek traversing the town parallel to the provincial road.\n\nObando, just like the other towns of Bulacan, has two pronounced seasons: dry and wet season. The wet season is from May to October and the dry season is from November to April. The rainfall of the wet season accounts for about 80% of the annual rainfall, which is due to west monsoons and typhoons.\n\nObando is politically subdivided into 11 barangays (8 urban, 3 rural). Barangays Binuangan (ancient \"Binwangan\" mentioned on the Laguna Copperplate Inscription which is the oldest written document of Philippines inscribed in Indianized script dates back to 900 CE) and Salambao are located along the Paliwas River, and can only be reached by means of motorized boats.\n\nIn the , the population of Obando, Bulacan, was people, with a density of .\n\nIn 2002, Obando had an estimated population of 58,245 wherein 49% are male and 51% are female. Of the current population, about 14% live in rural barangays while the rest constitute the urban population. There are 12,349 households. The average monthly income of a household is P9,000.00, slightly below the P9,540.00 minimum for a family of 6 threshold set by Department of Social Welfare and Development.\n\nObando is also the transmitter site of some AM stations, primarily broadcasting the Mega Manila area. Among them are: \n\nRiver pollution caused by the Tanza, Navotas dumpsite remains a problem. In 2002, under the leadership of Mayor Nesty Joaquin, the Sangguniang Bayan of Obando, Bulacan passed a controversial resolution allowing all the Phileco (Philippine Ecology Systems Corp.) barges that contains tons of Metro Manila's garbage to pass the river of Obando and dumped it in a river-turned \"controlled\" dumpsite facility in Tanza, Navotas which is only 1 km away from Obando. Mass actions followed but local officials failed to stop the dumping up to this date. Studies showed that the operation of the dump was polluting the river and had caused several diseases among residents, mostly old folks, women and children.\n\nThe Obando Landfill poses a concern because of the possibility of flooding. Environment Secretary Ramon J.P. Paje has been asked to revoke the environmental compliance certificate that his department issued to a landfill project for aggravating the situation in Obando town of Bulacan. Coalition president Roy Alvarez warned Paje the flooding in Obando is proof that the fishing town is a flood-prone area and the construction of a sanitary landfill is a blunder. The threat of extreme weather disturbances due to climate change and constructing a landfill in a flood disaster hotspot like Obando, Alvarez said. Citizens’ groups, religious associations, an environmental health coalition and a fisherfolk alliance, had asked Paje to stop the construction of the 44-hectare landfill in Barangay Salambao in Obando. They cited the proximity of the waste disposal facility to Obando River and Manila Bay. The protesters said that the Obando landfill project is illegal and violative of the Ecological Solid Waste Management Act. They expressed belief the landfill will prejudice the health of Obando River and its people, worsen the decades-old flooding problem in the town, contribute to the deterioration of Manila Bay and destroy the livelihood of tens of thousands of people. The said project was approved without public hearing and backed up by its then Mayor Orencio E. Gabriel, councilors Aries Manalaysay, Dhey Alejo, Virgilio Cruz, Arvin dela Cruz, Edmon Papa, Jocelyn Gutierrez-Garcia, Bulacan governor Willy Alvarado. Businessman Antonio L. Cabangon-Chua of Ecoshield Development Corporation is the owner of the said sanitary landfill.

The game is similar to Freecell, but it is different because of the way building onto the foundations and the tableau.\n\nThe player deals four cards from the deck. These four cards form the foundations. They are turned sideways (although it is not necessary to do so).\n\nThe rest of the cards are dealt into eight columns of six cards each on the tableau. These cards can only be built up on the foundations regardless of suit and they cannot be built on each other.\n\nBefore the game starts, the player can decide on how the foundations should be built. Building can be either in ones (A-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-J-Q-K) or in twos (A-3-5-7-9-J-K-2-4-6-8-10-Q). Once the player makes up his mind, he begins building on the foundations from the cards on the tableau. The foundations are built, as already mentioned, up regardless of suit, and it goes round the corner, building from King to Ace (if building by ones) or from Queen to Ace (if building by twos) if necessary. The foundation cards turned sideways, though not necessarily be done, is a reminder of the last card's rank on each foundation.\n\nThe cards in the tableau should be placed in the foundations according to the building method the player decides to use. But when there are cards that cannot (or does not want to) be moved to the foundations, certain cards can be placed on a reserve. Any card can be placed on the reserve. But once a card is placed on the reserve, it must be built on a foundation; it should never return to the tableau. Furthermore, the reserve can only hold two cards.\n\nThe game is won when all cards are built onto the foundations, each having 13 cards. The four starting cards in the foundations don't have to be of the same rank; so results vary with each won game.\n"}

Released by Capitol Records, \nit marked Evans' debut (and her only release) on the EMI subsidiary, following her departure from Bad Boy Records in 2003. Despite this, the singer reunited with much of her frequent contributors to work on the album, including The Neptunes, Chucky Thompson, and Mario Winans. Duo Carvin & Ivan of Karma Productions wrote and produced the predominant part of all songs that were included in the final track listing.\n\nGenerally well received by critics, \"The First Lady\" debuted at number two on the U.S. \"Billboard\" 200 and number one on the U.S. Top R&B/Hip-Hop albums with opening week sales of 157,000 units. It remains Evans' highest ranking album on either chart, and the best first week sales of her career. By the end of 2005, the album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America, denoting shipments exceeding 500,000 in the United States alone. In support of the album, Evans embarked on a concert tour, The First Lady Tour, in the United States and Europe in mid-2005. In 2006, \"The First Lady\" was nominated for Best Female R&B/Soul Album at the 20th Soul Train Music Awards.\n\nThe title of the album was inspired by Evans' original nickname with Bad Boy Records, \"The First Lady of Bad Boy.\" On her decision to use a truncated version of the name Diddy dubbed her with, Evans commented: \"[The nickname] did carry over, 'cause I'm the first artist in my genre at Capitol,\" she said. \"More so, I chose the title \"The First Lady\" because a lot of my personality reminds me of people like Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and Hillary Clinton. [...] Of course, they go through things, 'cause they're human like all of us. But when you see the first lady, you regard her [as] being the first lady. [...] I've made it my business to try and handle certain turbulence in my life with a certain dignity and [remain] ladylike.\"\n\n\"The First Lady\" received positive reviews from most music critics upon its release. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 72, based on 17 reviews, which indicates \"generally favorable reviews\". In his review for Allmusic, Andy Kellman wrote that \"if there was any creative block during [Evans'] time away, it doesn't show. In fact, \"The First Lady\" proves that she only gets better with time, as she goes through more ups and downs and continues to absorb her inspirations.\" He called the first four tracks the highlights of the album, which he rated four out of five stars, and went on to praise \"The First Lady\", calling it as \"well-rounded as an R&B album gets, regardless of the age it's part of. In review of her 2010 album \"Something About Faith\" he called \"The First Lady\" \"one of Faith Evans' strongest albums\". It smartly incorporates throwback aspects into state-of-the-art pop-soul.\" Belinda Boakye from \"The Situation\" complimented the \"unfailing spirit and soul\" on the album, giving it a score of 3.5 out of 5, and commented that \"this long anticipated album marks a metamorphosis for Faith Evans into a state of musical autonomy. With 52 minutes of silky vocals and a variation of infectious beats and slow sultry rhythm and blues, this record has all the ingredients needed making it emulate the class and tightly toned sound of Evans’ new physical appearance.\"\n\n\"The Washington Post\" gave it a positive review, stating, \"No further proof is needed than \"The First Lady\", a CD that sounds remarkably humble despite its title. It's not her term, anyway. The industry gave it to her—with the appendage \"of hip-hop soul\"—after she started running in the same circles as Sean \"P. Diddy\" Combs and Notorious B.I.G. back in the mid-1990s. She's still known as Biggie's widow, even though she married her chief musical collaborator, Todd Russaw, a while back. But all the drama and the sorrow barely matter at this point, because on \"The First Lady\" it's the stability that counts.\" Blogcritics also gave it a favorable review, stating that it \"is a musical mood ring, encapsulating and displaying the last ten years of her life. It’s not all reflective, however, as there are plenty of party worthy tracks spread between the affecting intensity and veteran of the game vocals. [...] Evans has released a remarkable album with wide appeal and emotional depth for the more cautious listeners. It doesn’t transcend genres or attempt to reconstruct R&B, but First Lady will surely impress those with a taste for evocative bluesy vocals, dance numbers, and solid slow jams.\"\n\nSal Cinquemani from \"Slant\" gave the album three out of five stars and said \"\"The First Lady\" is decidedly less \"street,\" boasting a more adult sound that's timely enough to keep longtime fans and possibly even earn new ones.\" Though he dismissed songs such as \"Ever Wonder,\" \"Until You Came\" and \"Stop N Go,\" which he declared as either \"cloying\" or \"sappy,\" he found that the album was \"a mark of growth for Evans\" following her slip from Bad Boy and Sean \"Diddy\" Combs. Orlando Lima, writing for \"Vibe\", also gave the album three-and-a-half out of five stars and noted that while \"Evans can still finesse notes,\" the album had a tendency to backtracking, \"covering much of the same ground as her previous offering [...] instead of continually pushing her sound into the future.\" He found that Evans yet had to \"sway the R&B world with the weight of say, Sade's \"Lovers Rock\" or Mary J. Blige's \"My Life\".\"\n\nDespite the somewhat average commercial performance of the album's leading single, \"Again,\" \"The First Lady\" peaked at number two on the \"Billboard\" 200, the official albums chart in the United States, on April 23, 2005. The album sold 157,000 units in its first week of release, falling just 8,000 copies short of the top slot and 50 Cent's \"The Massacre\". Despite this, the album gave Evans her best sales figures of her career yet, marking both her highest-selling debut and best ever first-week sales. In addition, \"The First Lady\" became her first album to reach number-one on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, surpassing \"The Massacre\". By the end of 2005, the album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and became the 158th best-selling album of that year in the US.\n\nIn support of the album, Evans embarked on the tour at the WAMO Summer Jam concert in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on June 18, 2005, where she was joined by singer Teairra Mari and rappers Master P, Common, and Cassidy. The American leg of the tour concluded at the House of Blues in West Hollywood, California on August 31, 2005, and was supported by opening acts Anthony David and Keke Wyatt. Kameelah Williams, former lead singer of the R&B group 702, served as a backing vocalist during the concerts.\n\nSample credits\n\n\n\n"}

Its purposes are centered on enforcing constitutional order. The Estonian Internal Security Service has primary investigative jurisdiction in some offences committed by state officials; countering terrorism; incitement to hatred; crimes against humanity and peace, including war crimes; illegal handling and trafficking of firearms, ammunition, explosives, radioactive material or other strategic materials; and the protection of state secrets. It also fills counterintelligence duties.\n\nThe Estonian Internal Security Service is administered as an agency of the Estonian Ministry of Internal Affairs.\n\nWhile many of the Estonian Internal Security Service's activities are classified, its overview of the status of national security is published yearly as the \"Kaitsepolitsei aastaraamat\".\n\nKaitsepolitseiamet was first established on April 12, 1920. From 1925 to 1940 the institution was known as Political Police (\"Poliitiline politsei\", abbreviated \"PolPol\"). The PolPol fought against subversive activities of political extremists, espionage, desertion, smuggling and terrorism. The most discussed targets were the Estonian communists whose party had been declared an illegal organisation following the failed December coup, forcing them to operate clandestinely and through various legal fronts, usually as workers' organisations. Communists were supported by the Soviet Union, who had publicly accepted the principles not recognizing the parliamentary order, seeing terrorism as a legitimate activity. Similarly, the PolPol surveyed pro-Nazi oriented Baltic Germans and extreme monarchists of the White Russian emigres.\n\nWhen the Soviet Union annexed Estonia on June 17, 1940 the PolPol was one of the first institutions which was practically \"in corpore\" repressed - almost all of its employees were deported in course of June deportations; before the end of the World War II more than 90% of the PolPol employees and their families were killed.\n\nThe Estonian Internal Security Service was reestablished on March 1, 1991, as a part of restoration of Estonian independence from the Soviet occupation. Until June 18, 1993, the Estonian Internal Security Service was a department of the central police structure; then, it was reorganised as a distinct entity. Following adoption of a new law of security services on March 1, 2001, the status of the Estonian Internal Security Service was reclassified from a police institution to a security service.\n\nAccording to an Amnesty International report from 2009: \"In June, the Estonian Security Police Board published its annual report which made serious allegations against the Legal Information Centre for Human Rights (LICHR), an NGO promoting and defending the rights of those belonging to linguistic minorities. The report stated that the LICHR was used by the Russian Federation to carry out scientific research for propaganda purposes, and accused the LICHR of trying to conceal the specific sources of funding it received from the Russian Federation. These allegations were widely seen as an attempt by the government to misrepresent the LICHR and to undermine its attempts to secure the necessary financial and social support to carry out its work.\"\n\nCriticism against the Estonian Internal Security Service has been presented by Risto Teinonen, a Finnish lawyer and neo-Nazi living in Tallinn. In 2009, Teinonen launched criminal proceedings against the Estonian Internal Security Service in a Tallinn court, accusing the organization of politically motivated persecution of innocent people.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1882449", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1882449", "title": "Boeing 307 Stratoliner", "text": "Boeing 307 Stratoliner\n\nThe Boeing Model 307 Stratoliner was an American commercial transport aircraft that entered service in 1938. It was the first to offer a pressurized cabin, allowing it to cruise at an altitude of 20,000 ft (6,000 m), well above many weather disturbances. The pressure differential was 2.5 psi (17 kPa), so at 14,700 ft (4,480 m) the cabin air pressure was equivalent to an altitude of 8,000 ft (2,440 m). The Model 307 had capacity for a crew of six and 33 passengers. The cabin was nearly 12 ft (3.6 m) across. It was the first land-based aircraft to include a flight engineer as a crew member (several flying boats had included a flight engineer position earlier). In addition to its civilian service it was also flown as the Boeing C-75 Stratoliner by the United States Army Air Forces, who used it as a long-range cargolift aircraft.\n\nIn 1935, Boeing designed a four-engine airliner based on its B-17 heavy bomber (Boeing Model 299), then in development, calling it the Model 307. It combined the wings, tail, rudder, landing gear, and engines from their production B-17C with a new, circular cross-section fuselage of diameter, designed to allow pressurization.\n\nThe first order, for two 307s (named Stratoliners), was placed in 1937 by Pan American Airways. Pan Am soon increased this to six, and a second order for five from Transcontinental & Western Air (TWA) prompted Boeing to begin production on an initial batch of the airliner. Pan Am received its initial order and TWA received its order, but only one of the second batch of four Pan Am aircraft was delivered before war intervened and put a halt to civil aircraft production.\n\nAt the time the United States entered World War II in December 1941, flying across oceans was a rare luxury. The war required government and military officials to do so, and most four-engined long-range commercial aircraft, including Pan American Airways' 14 flying boats and TWA's five Boeing 307s, were pressed into service. Additional fuel tanks were added to give them the extra range required; once converted they were designated C-75 for military use. Before World War II ended their production, ten commercial 307s had been built. TWA flew domestic routes between New York and Los Angeles for 18 months until the Army purchased their Stratoliners for wartime use as long-range, transatlantic transports for various VIPs or critical cargo on January 26, 1942. TWA converted their 307s to military service in January 1942, and its Intercontinental Division (ICD) then operated these C-75s under contract to the Army's Air Transport Command (ATC) until July 1944. These were the only U. S. built commercial aircraft able to cross the Atlantic with a payload until the arrival of the Douglas C-54 Skymaster in November 1942.\n\nConversion to the C-75 included removal of the pressurization equipment to save weight, removal of the forward four (or five) of nine reclining seats along the port side, and alteration of the two forward Pullman-like compartments (of four) starboard of the left-of-centerline aisle. Space was thus provided for crew requirements on extremely long flights and for the addition of five fuel tanks. The landing gear was strengthened, the maximum takeoff weight was increased from , and the exterior was painted military olive drab.\n\nThe maiden flight of the first Boeing 307 Stratoliner (not a prototype, as it was planned to be delivered to Pan Am following testing and certification), registration NX 19901 took place from Boeing Field, Seattle on December 31, 1938.\n\nThis aircraft crashed on March 18, 1939, while being demonstrated to representatives of KLM. After takeoff the aircraft climbed to an altitude of 11,000 feet. At this altitude, longitudinal stability tests were made. The next tests, as outlined by the flight plan, were side-slip tests. The aircraft went into an inadvertent spin subsequent to a stall at an altitude of approximately 11,000 feet. It made two to three turns in the spin, during which the engines were used to aid recovery. In recovering from the dive subsequent to the spin, the wings and horizontal tail surfaces failed upward apparently due to air loads in excess of those for which the aircraft was designed. The ten people aboard, including the KLM technical director, a representative of the Dutch Air Ministry, a Boeing test pilot, the Boeing Chief Aerodynamicist, the Boeing Chief Engineer, and a TWA representative were killed.\nSubsequent wind tunnel testing showed that the addition of an extended dorsal fin ahead of and attached to the vertical tail prevented rudder lock. This was incorporated into the 307's rudder redesign, while also being incorporated in Boeing's rear fuselage redesign for their models \"E\" through \"G\" B-17 bomber.\n\nThe first delivery to a customer was to multi-millionaire Howard Hughes, who bought one 307 (NX-19904) for a round-the-world flight, hoping to break his own record of 91 hours 14 minutes set from July 10–14, 1938 in a Lockheed 14. Hughes' Boeing Stratoliner was fitted with extra fuel tanks and was ready to set out on the first leg of the round-the-world attempt when Nazi Germany invaded Poland on September 1, 1939, causing the attempt to be abandoned. This 307 later had the extra fuel tanks removed, was fitted with much more powerful Wright R-2600 engines, and was transformed into the luxurious \"The Flying Penthouse\" for Hughes, although it was little used, eventually being sold to oil tycoon Glenn McCarthy in 1949.\n\nDeliveries to Pan Am started in March 1940, with TWA receiving its first 307 in April. TWA's Stratoliners flew three-stop flights between Los Angeles and New York while Pan Am's flew from Miami to Latin America. Ten 307s were built, three being delivered to Pan-Am (NC-19902:\"Clipper Rainbow\", NC-19903:\"Clipper Flying Cloud\", and NC-19910:\"Clipper Comet\") and five to TWA (NC-19905:\"Comanche\", NC-19906:\"Cherokee\", NC-19907:\"Zuni\", NC-19908:\"Apache\", and NC-19909:\"Navajo\") with one aircraft going to Hughes (NX-19904).\n\nOn the entry of the United States into World War II, Pan Am (PAA) continued operating its Stratoliners on routes to Central and South America, but under direction of the Army Air Forces' Air Transport Command, while the TWA 307s were sold to the United States government, being designated Boeing C-75 (42-88623/27) and operated by the United States Army Air Forces (although normally still flown by TWA crews).\n\nThe Army returned its five C-75s to TWA in 1944, which sent them back to Boeing for rebuilding. Boeing replaced the wings and horizontal tail with those from the B-17G, while more powerful engines were fitted and the electrical system was replaced with one based on the B-29 Superfortress. Passenger capacity was increased from 33 to 38. The total rebuilding cost to TWA was $2 million; the five aircraft re-entered passenger service on April 1, 1945. Although TWA was committed to the larger and faster Lockheed Constellation, it kept the Stratoliners until April 1951.\n\nPan Am flew its unmodified 33-passenger Stratoliners between Miami and Havana until 1947, then sold them to small operators, including Aerovias Ecuatorianas AREA). Some later returned to the US, whilst others went to South-East Asia to replace write-offs. One aircraft (N-19903) was purchased by the Haitian Air Force, being fitted as a Presidential transport for François \"Papa Doc\" Duvalier. This aircraft later returned to the U.S. and was purchased by the Smithsonian Museum.\n\nTWA sold its Stratoliner fleet, of five, to the French airline Aigle Azur, which used them (F-BELU, F-BELV, F-BELX, F-BELY, F-BELZ) on scheduled flights from France to North and Central Africa, and later to French Indo-China. Three aircraft were transferred (F-BELU, F-BELV, F-BELX) to Aigle Azur's Vietnamese subsidiary (Aigle Azur Extrême-Orient) and were used in South East Asia, in various liveries and with various registrations, with at least one aircraft remaining in commercial use until 1974. Two aircraft remained in Europe (F-BELY, F-BELZ) and passed to Mediterranean runs, especially around Corsica, with: Airnautic. The exact history of the five aircraft becomes quite complex as the subsidiary was sold to UAT in 1955, and this in turn merged to become UTA in 1963, whilst the original branding was kept until 1961. Also, some of these aircraft were under contract to the ICC/CIC [see below], running both ad hoc flights plus regular scheduled services for diplomats between the various, often hostile, capitals. Aircraft write-offs required buying-up some of the remaining 307s, for ease of maintenance and continuity of service, so F-BELY also went East, as did the ex-Pan Am F-BHHR. At various times following independence, most received local (usually Lao) registrations (XW-PGR; XW-TAA, XW-TAB, XW-TAC; XW-tFP, XW-TFR), possibly for legal/fiscal reasons, whilst maintaining essentially the same services. Some were registered to the CITCA leasing company, whilst some formed the basis of the national-carrier Royal Air Lao. \n\nTwo main routes were flown: Washington, D.C., to Cairo across the South Atlantic, and New York to Prestwick, Scotland, across the North Atlantic. They often flew non-stop the 2,125 statute miles (3,415 km) between Gander, Newfoundland and Prestwick, Scotland in the north, and the 2,550 statute miles (4,100 km) between Natal, Brazil and Accra, Ghana in the south. After July 1942 a refueling stop at Ascension Island was an option in the south. In the north, stops at Iceland or Greenland were often necessary, especially flying westbound against the prevailing winds. As C-54s took over the Gander to Prestwick route, the C-75s operated a Marrakech-to-Prestwick service out over the Atlantic.\n\nIn April 1945, the five C-75s were returned to TWA, having been restored by Boeing and recertified by the CAA as SA-307B-1 civilian transports with their old registration numbers. TWA then restyled the interior cabin in two sections, ten seats forward and 28 aft.\n\n\nOnly 10 airframes were ever built:\n\n\n\nAccording to the Aviation Safety Network, the Boeing 307 was involved in eight hull-loss incidents for a total of 67 fatalities. Four of the eight incidents were fatal, with one an apparent shoot-down in a zone of conflict; casualties, by number, in the four incidents were: 25, 19, 13 & 10 (total: 67).\n\n\nThe only surviving Boeing 307 Stratoliner (NC-19903) is preserved in flying condition at the Smithsonian Museum's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center. On March 28, 2002, this aircraft crashed into Elliott Bay in Seattle, Washington, on what was to be its last flight before heading to the Smithsonian. Despite the incident, it was again restored, flown to the Smithsonian, and is now on display.\n\nThe fuselage of Howard Hughes' personal 307 (NX-19904) also survives, although it has been converted into a houseboat. The aircraft was awaiting restoration at Fort Lauderdale International Airport in the early 1960s when it was severely damaged in a hurricane after its tiedowns failed and it was blown into a stand of trees. The aircraft languished for nearly a year before being removed and longer still until later salvaged for its conversion into the house boat. The interior is notable for the original finishes and fitments added by Howard Hughes. The boat is now part of the collection at the Florida Air Museum.\n\n"}

He was best known for signing the first black player in the modern era of Major League Baseball (MLB), Jackie Robinson, after Robinson was scouted by Tom Greenwade in the Negro leagues.\n\nSukeforth was born in Washington, Maine. After two years at Georgetown University, followed by a year in the New England League with the Nashua Millionaires and the Manchester Blue Sox, he was acquired by the Cincinnati Reds in . His best year in the Major Leagues was when he batted .354 with 84 hits in 84 games played. Two years later he lost partial sight of his right eye from being hit by a shotgun pellet while bird hunting on November 16.\n\nHe continued to play, but his batting suffered, and in was traded to the Brooklyn Dodgers. Sukeforth, who batted left-handed and threw right-handed, appeared in 486 games over all or parts of ten big-league seasons (1926–34 and 1945), compiling a batting average of .264 with 326 hits, two home runs and 96 runs batted in.\n\nSukeforth managed in the Brooklyn farm system from 1937–42 with the Clinton Owls of the Class B Three-I League, the Elmira Pioneers of the Class A Eastern League and the Montreal Royals of the top-level International League before his promotion to the Dodger coaching staff in . He also was activated by Brooklyn at age 43 for 18 games during the first three months of the season, the last year of the World War II manpower shortage, despite not having played competitively since 1939, when he was a player-manager at Elmira. Sukeforth started 13 games as Brooklyn's catcher, and collected 15 hits, although only one was for extra bases, a double struck against Jim Tobin of the Boston Braves on April 24. He batted .288 in 55 at-bats.\n\nSukeforth soon retired permanently from the playing ranks and resumed his former job as a Brooklyn coach and occasional special-assignment scout. In that capacity, later that season, he would make history. Dodger president Branch Rickey was making secret plans to break organized baseball's six-decades-long \"gentleman's agreement\" that enforced racial segregation. In August, Rickey sent Sukeforth to Chicago, where Robinson's team, the Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro Leagues, was slated to play the Chicago American Giants. Rickey told Sukeforth to urge Robinson to come back with him to Brooklyn for a meeting with Rickey and the Dodgers. Sukeforth met Robinson again in Toledo, Ohio, and the two men traveled by railway to Brooklyn for the historic meeting at the Dodgers' Montague Street offices on August 28. He was the only other person in the room when Rickey told Robinson of his plans to sign him to a contract to play in Montreal in . \n\nThen, in , Sukeforth—functioning in the unwanted role of interim manager of the Dodgers after the suspension of Leo Durocher—wrote Robinson's name into the Dodger lineup on Opening Day on April 15 against the Braves at Ebbets Field. \n\nIn addition to serving on Durocher's coaching staff and his scouting assignments for Dodgers president Rickey, he worked behind the scenes in 1946 to help create the new Nashua Dodgers of the Class B New England League. Sukeforth helped the Nashua team forge ties with the New Hampshire community, easing the racial integration of the league when Roy Campanella and Don Newcombe were assigned to that club.\n\nSukeforth won his only two games as the Dodgers' manager in 1947, 5–3 and 12–6, both against Boston. Durocher had been suspended for the entire 1947 season by Commissioner of Baseball Happy Chandler because of \"conduct detrimental to baseball.\" But Sukeforth and a fellow coach, Ray Blades, both turned down the opportunity to serve as acting manager for the rest of the season; ultimately, Brooklyn scout and longtime Rickey associate Burt Shotton assumed that role, and Shotton led the Dodgers to the 1947 National League pennant.\n\nIn , when Dodger manager Chuck Dressen needed a reliever to face the New York Giants' Bobby Thomson in the ninth inning of the decisive third game of the National League pennant playoff, Sukeforth, coaching in the Dodger bullpen, passed over Carl Erskine and sent in Ralph Branca, who gave up Thomson's \"shot heard 'round the world\". On January 9, 1952, Sukeforth resigned as a Dodgers coach, then a few weeks later signed to be a coach with the Pittsburgh Pirates, where Rickey was executive vice president and general manager. There, as a coach and occasional scout, he played a pivotal role in the drafting of Roberto Clemente from the Brooklyn organization in the Rule 5 draft.\n\nOnce again passing up a Major League managing assignment after turning down the chance to succeed Pirate skipper Bobby Bragan on August 3, , Sukeforth retired as a coach at the end of the 1957 season.\n\nSukeforth remained in the Pirates organization as a scout and occasional minor league manager through . He then worked as a scout for the Atlanta Braves. Sukeforth died at the age of ninety-eight at his home in Waldoboro, Maine.\n\nSukeforth appears in the Norman Rockwell painting \"Bottom of the Sixth\".\n\nHe was interviewed in Ken Burns's 1994 documentary \"Baseball\".\n\nIn \"42\", the 2013 theatrical sports film about Robinson's breaking of the baseball color line, Sukeforth — played by actor Toby Huss — is portrayed as meeting Robinson at a rural filling station where the Monarchs' team bus had stopped (rather than the actual locale, Comiskey Park in Chicago), and urging Robinson to travel with him to Brooklyn for his meeting with Rickey. Another scene has Huss/Sukeforth (hitting fungos right-handed) teaching Robinson how to play first base, an unfamiliar position for the shortstop and second baseman, but the one Robinson played as a rookie in . In addition, the on-screen Sukeforth, wearing uniform #40, is shown in one of the film's last scenes as the Dodgers' third base coach who congratulates Robinson on hitting a dramatic home run.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1882465", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1882465", "title": "Lost Odyssey", "text": "Lost Odyssey\n\nFirst discussions surrounding \"Lost Odyssey\" began in 2003, with development beginning the following year as an internal Microsoft project. After running into difficulties, Feelplus was established as a dedicated studio to work on the game. The story was written by Hironobu Sakaguchi and Japanese author Kiyoshi Shigematsu: Sakaguchi wanted to create a story focusing on evoking human emotions, and kept the gameplay within genre traditions so he could experiment with the story. The game went through a difficult development, with problems stemming from the chosen engine technology and the arrangement of development teams. The music was composed by Nobuo Uematsu, a veteran composer for the \"Final Fantasy\" series.\n\nFirst hinted at in 2005, the game was officially revealed shortly before that year's Electronic Entertainment Expo. At the time it was released, it was Microsoft's largest console game, spanning four dual-layer DVDs. Upon its debut in Japan, it sold favourably, eventually selling nearly 110,000 units by April 2010. It also received strong sales overseas. Its critical reception has been generally positive: while praise has focused on its story, many journalists were critical of its traditional design and loading times.\n\n\"Lost Odyssey\" uses a traditional turn-based battle system seen in most Japanese role-playing games, similar to early \"Final Fantasy\" iterations. A world map allows the player to move the party between adjacent towns or fields on the map, while later in the game the player is given more freedom to explore the world through the use of ocean-going ships. Towns and cities provide inns for the player to recover the party's health, stores for buying and selling of equipment, and save points for the game. While exploring certain areas, the player will randomly encounter monsters to fight.\n\nThe combat system incorporates aspects of battle initiative and length of actions to determine how events resolve each turn. Item usage is instantaneous, regular melee attacks are executed on the same turn, while casting spells or using special abilities may delay the player's action for one or more turns, depending on their speed. Actions can be delayed if the user is hit by an attack. The player has the option to cancel an action on a subsequent turn if necessary.\n\nMelee attacks include an \"Aim Ring System\" using equippable rings with added effects. As the character launches the attack, two concentric targeting rings appear on screen. The player must time their button release in order to make the rings intersect. An accuracy rank (\"Perfect\", \"Good\" or \"Bad\") indicates the potency of the effect. These include additional damage specific to certain types of monsters or their magic element, hit point or mana absorption, status ailments, or being able to steal items. Even if awarded a \"Perfect\", a character can still miss the attack altogether. These rings are created by synthesizing \"components\", and can be upgraded into more accurate, or more potent versions; advanced rings can be made by combining two or more rings at a special vendor.\n\nIn combat, both the player's party and enemies are arranged in two lines, front or back. Up to five party members can participate in battle at once. At the start of battle, the back line is protected by a special defensive \"wall\" which is based on the combined hit points of the front line. This wall reduces damage that the characters in the back experience. However, as the front line takes damage, the wall weakens, and can only be recovered through the use of certain spells or skills.\n\nThere are two types of characters that the player controls. \"Mortals\" gain skills by leveling up, but can benefit from additional skills by equipping accessories. \"Immortals\" do not know any skills initially, but instead gain skills by \"linking\" with a mortal character that is currently part of the battle formation, earning skill points in battle towards complete learning of the skill. Immortals can also learn skills from accessories by equipping them in the same manner, much like the ability point system of Final Fantasy IX. Once a skill is learned, the player can then assign these skills to a limited number of skill slots, initially starting at three but able to be expanded via \"Slot Seed\" items or certain skills. Immortals also have the ability to automatically revive in battle should they lose all their hit points; however, if the entire party is downed, including the immortals, the game will be over.\n\nThe game's magic system is based on four classes of magic: Black, consisting primarily of elemental attacks and negative status effects; White, mainly for healing and protection; Spirit, for stat changes, status ailments and non-elemental magic; and Composite, which can combine two spells, once learned, into multi-target or multi-function spells. To cast spells, the player must first find spells to fill the spell book, and then must have characters that have learned the appropriate magic skill of the right level to cast that spell.\n\n\"Lost Odyssey\" is set in a world in which a \"Magic-Industrial Revolution\" is taking place. While magic energy existed in all living creatures beforehand, it suddenly became far more powerful thirty years before the beginning of the game. Because of this, it has affected society greatly, with devices called \"Magic Engines\" harnessing this power for lighting, automobiles, communication, and robots, among other uses. While previously only a select few could wield magic, many magicians gained the ability. However, such progress has also caused two nations to develop new and more powerful weapons of mass destruction: the kingdom of Gohtza and the Republic of Uhra (which recently converted from a monarchy). Uhra is building Grand Staff, a gigantic magic engine, while the heavily industrialized Gohtza actively pursues magic research of their own. A third nation, the Free Ocean State of Numara, remains isolated and neutral, though it is falling into disarray due to a general attempting to stage a coup d'etat. Uhra, at war with Khent, a nation of beastmen, sends its forces to the Highlands of Wohl for a decisive battle at the start of the game.\n\nAfter a meteor wipes out the majority of forces from the nations of Uhra and Khent, Kaim joins Seth and Jansen to investigate the Grand Staff at the behest of the council of Uhra. At the Staff, the three are captured by hostile scouts who take them to Numara, where they meet with Queen Ming, another immortal who has lost her memory. The queen allows the group to go free in Numara, where Kaim meets Cooke and Mack, his grandchildren, who join the group after the death of their mother.\n\nNews eventually arrives in Numara that Gongora has encouraged Tolten to reestablish the monarchy in Uhra and prepare for war. The general of Numara, Kakanas, uses the opportunity to usurp control of the country from Ming, forcing her to flee with Kaim and others as enemies of the state. The group travels towards the nation of Gohtza, hoping to seek help from its King. On the way, Sarah Sisulart, Kaim's wife, joins the party after she is recovered from the Old Sorceress Mansion.\n\nArriving in Gohtza, Kaim and Sarah arrange for a peace negotiation between the Gohtzan King, Queen Ming, and Tolten to take place on a train. However, Kaim and Sarah are forced to go after Cooke and Mack, who steal a train to again try to find the spirit of their departed mother, leaving Jansen and Seth to participate in the negotiation alone. During the meeting, Gongora activates Grand Staff and flash freezes the entire country. Kaim and Sarah locate Cooke and Mack but are forced to separate due to a vicious magic attack by Gongora. Kaim and Sarah's train crashes, while Cooke and Mack are stranded on the train tracks in the freezing cold. The children are later saved by Ming and Jansen. The four unite and rescue Kaim and Sarah. In Uhra, Tolten learns that Gongora has announced Tolten's death and has usurped the throne, thus he joins with Seth to help free her son Sed, who joins the party, and his pirate hydrofoil submarine, the Nautilus. The entire party reconvenes in Gohtza.\n\nThe immortals talk and begin to recover their memories, realizing that they are actually observers from a parallel universe. In Gongora's diary, he explains the difference in space-time, where 1000 years is equivalent to 1 year in the parallel universe. The diary also explains that the immortals' world has been affected by the emotions of people in the mortal realm.\n\nAfter regaining their memories, the party heads for Grand Staff. They recognize that Gongora is attempting to use the Grand Staff to destroy the portal between the two worlds, killing the other immortals and making himself effectively invincible. The group confronts Gongora in the Hall of Mirrors, the only place where they are vulnerable to death. The mortals help to block the mirror's power while the immortals fight Gongora, but their powers are equally matched. When the mortals become trapped in their own barrier after absorbing too much power, Seth drags Gongora through the mirror, allowing Kaim to break it and prevent him from ever returning.\n\nIn the epilogue, the nations led by Ming and Tolten come together to rebuild society, and the monarchy is restored in Uhra. Ming and Jansen get married, while Kaim and Sarah settle down to help raise Cooke and Mack, all aware that Seth is able to observe their happy endings.\n\nThe development of \"Lost Odyssey\" was first proposed to Microsoft Game Studios by \"Final Fantasy\" creator Hironobu Sakaguchi. The first discussions began in 2003. It was a collaboration between Mistwalker, an independent game studio set up by Sakaguchi in 2004, and Microsoft. It was initially an internal project by Microsoft with Sakaguchi, but development ran into difficulties. Faced with critical problems, Microsoft decided to found a dedicated studio to help with development: this became Feelplus, which formed one part of AQ Interactive. The staff of feelplus included a large number of developers from the defunct \"Shadow Hearts\" developer Nautilus, and staff members from \"The Legend of Dragoon\" and \"Phantom Dust\". Among the shared staff were art director Takamasa Ohsawa. They also included developers from Microsoft and Sega. Further freelance staff were also brought in. Development started in 2004 and lasted three and a half years. Mistwalker handled the story and character design, Feelplus developed the actual product, while Microsoft provided funding, project management and testing. While development started with ten people, at development's peak it was at 150. The game's respective director and technical director, Daisuke Fukugawa and Katsuhisa Higuchi, had previously worked at Square Enix. Sakaguchi was fairly closely involved during the initial development, but during later phases he took a more hands-off supervisory approach.\n\nThe game's story was written by Sakaguchi, whose main aim was to create a highly emotional experience that explored the human psyche. According to him, the game's setting revolved around conflict and its effects. In addition to Sakaguchi's work, Japanese novelist Kiyoshi Shigematsu created over thirty stories detailing Kaim's life as an immortal, titled \"A Thousand Years of Dreams\". According to Shigematsu, it was the first time he had ever worked on a video game, and was unsure about whether he could evoke emotion as he did in his books. In the end, he found that the interactive medium gave his work a new impact that moved him to tears upon seeing it in place. These story segments were presented in the game in a similar style to a visual novel, as the stories were intended to evoke emotion. The gameplay, such as the battle system, was kept deliberately traditional so that Sakaguchi had freedom to experiment with the story. Despite this, he wanted to introduce new real-time elements into the system. One of the elements Sakaguchi checked was how story and gameplay were balanced: sometimes, he would ask for a cutscene to be removed or for a boss battle to be lengthened if the balance seemed off.\n\nThe music was composed and produced by Nobuo Uematsu at his studio Smile Please, a composer famous for his work on the \"Final Fantasy\" series. Arrangements were done by Satoshi Henmi and Hiroyuki Nakayama. Uematsu was contracted to Mistwalker to work on three of their games, with the first being \"Blue Dragon\". He was highly excited for the title as it was Sakaguchi's first \"serious\" game since leaving Square Enix in 2003. As he was involved with \"Lost Odyssey\" from the early stages, receiving information on the characters and setting, he was able to create his first musical pieces while the game was in early stages. Most of the two hours worth of music was recorded with a live orchestra, as Uematsu felt that the emotion evoked by the game could only be communicated through live instruments. As with his previous work, Uematsu's music covered a lot of ground: the musical style varied from grand orchestral pieces, to hardcore rock, to ambient electronic music. In addition, he used unusual ethnic instruments to introduce unconventional sounds, including a sitar and a shakuhachi. The main theme was written in a minor key to express the burden of living for over a millennium: it was incorporated into the score in various forms. Two of the songs in the game, \"What You Are\" and \"Eclipse of Time\", were sung by award-winning vocalist Sheena Easton. The vocal track \"Kaette Kuru, Kitto...\" was sung by Japanese band Flip Flap. The lyrics for all the songs were written by Sakaguchi.\n\nFor the development, the staff split up into multiple teams that handled different segments of game development: one group was responsible for the game's build, another was responsible for the database system and AI, while another was in charge of level design. The game design went smoothly as the game's staff were used to the genre, but other aspects did not: development began without access to the Xbox 360 hardware, and starting development with a large staff caused aspects to be changed upon the console's release. The three separate teams that created battle, adventure, and cutscene components ran into \"various issues\" while combining their work, causing company president Ray Nakazato to consider \"seamless\" development for any later projects. Little-used parts of the environment were given an extensive level of detail, resulting in a waste of money and time, and concept art was given the same extensive level of attention. Microsoft's milestone-based development schedule was seen as a boon to the development, as every three months the team needed to produce acceptable results for Microsoft. Conversely, the high number of staff led to a prolonged feeling of disconnection between developers. According to Sakaguchi, the team was on the point of collapse by the middle of development, but they pulled through.\n\nThe game used Unreal Engine 3 as middleware due to it being at the forefront of engine technology at the time. It also allowed development to start before the console's release. Conversely, the design philosophy behind Unreal Engine clashed with the philosophies most often used in JRPG engines, resulting in difficulties with integration that repeated themselves four times during development. In addition, the team had trouble keeping up with the engine's regular updates and reading the requisite manuals. This in turn caused technical setbacks such as long loading times. Four different types of cutscenes were created, from lower-quality real-time cutscenes to pre-rendered cinematics. In hindsight, it was felt that the pre-rendered cinematics were not needed as they used the same models as the high-quality real-time cutscenes, although during development pre-rendered cutscenes were chosen due to their improved lighting and visual effects. The different grades of cutscenes were created differently: higher-quality real-time cutscenes were first shot and then tailored motion capture animations were included with hand-manipulated facial expressions, while the lower-quality cutscenes used \"off-the-shelf\" motion capture. Due to a lack of a clear transition point, players later felt that cutscene quality was inconsistent. The amount of higher-quality cutscenes was much higher in earlier builds of the game, and the team needed to reduce their number and replace them with standard real-time cutscenes. The final length of cutscenes was estimated at around seven hours: one hour used pre-rendered graphics despite real-time high-quality character models being used, while six hours were purely real-time. The game's visual director was Roy Sato, who had a previous background in film and television and had worked with Sakaguchi on \"\". Working on the game was initially difficult, as he needed to adjust to a new format and get used to a company that was still fairly new.\n\nThe main characters were designed by Takehiko Inoue, a noted manga artist who had developed a reputation for designing \"people\". Inoue made the initial character designs based on the material provided by Sakaguchi, then submitted them and adjusted them based on Sakaguchi's feedback. Characters sometimes needed to be completely redesigned, such as Tolten. The main characters' clothing was designed by \"Final Fantasy\" artist Hideo Minaba: the clothing was designed not to reflect any nationality or historical era. While they tried not to limit the designers' creative abilities within the game's hardware, Minaba was asked to limit fluffy or swinging clothing. The character models were hard to create, especially considering the surrounding environments. In contrast, the use of Unreal Engine 3 lessened the technical restrictions on the team. Inoue ran frequent checks on the character models as they went through multiple revisions, even down to their eyebrows. It was estimated that three hundred unique characters were created for the game. The game's concept artwork was worked on by Christian Lorenz Scheurer, who had previous worked on \"Final Fantasy IX\", along with film projects such as \"The Fifth Element\".\n\nMistwalker confirmed in February 2005 that it was working on two RPGs for the then-untitled Xbox 360. \"Lost Odyssey\" was officially revealed during a pre-Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) conference. The game's content was large enough that it was shipped on four dual-layer DVD discs: this was one more than Mistwalker's other Xbox 360 RPG \"Blue Dragon\", and at the time made it Microsoft's largest console game. A demo for Japan was released in 2006, featuring a basic build of its battle system. In hindsight, a demo release this early was seen as a mistake as it gave players a negative impression of the battle system. Microsoft initially had high hopes for the title and so had high sales forecasts, but after the Xbox 360 met with poor sales in Japan, they significantly reduced their forecast.\n\n\"Lost Odyssey\" was added to the Xbox One backwards compatibility list in September 2016. The game was made available digitally on December 14, 2016 and was a free download to all Xbox Live members until December 31.\n\nThe game was localized into multiple languages, but all the lip syncing was for the English dialogue: this was done partly to show western audiences appreciation for their support of the title, and also because Japanese audiences had grown used to out-of-sync dialogue with dubbed Western films. English voice recording was done in Los Angeles. Localization was handled by Microsoft: initially, different departments in each region handled localization for their region. The need to translate and then include the material at long distance proved problematic, so the main development team brought the localization team into the main production, introducing them to easy-to-use development tools so changes could be made easily without direct consultation with Feelplus. The story segments written by Shigematsu were translated by Jay Rubin, a noted American academic and translator from Harvard University noted for translating the works of Haruki Murakami. Microsoft chose Rubin as they wanted Shigematsu's material treated and translated with the utmost respect possible. When first approached, Rubin was skeptical, as he did not want to work in a medium that generally seemed to glorify violence. However, he eventually agreed to have a look at the material, and was shocked by the anti-violence message present throughout all the stories while remaining family-friendly. He referred to the messages within Shigematsu's stories as \"essentially Buddhistic\", and was surprised that Microsoft had contacted him in the first place given the stories' visual novel medium within the context of \"Lost Odyssey\".\n\nDownloadable content (DLC) for the game began release in Japan in January 2010: the content consisted of multiple additional chapters in \"A Thousand Years of Dreams\", powerful accessories, and an option to view cutscenes. The final DLC package included a late-game underwater dungeon. The DLC content received overseas releases between April and May 2008, but the first one was limited to a pre-order exclusive in North America.\n\nOn November 21, 2007 a book of short stories based on the main character of Kaim was released in Japan called . It is penned by Kiyoshi Shigematsu and features 31 out of the 33 stories found in the \"A Thousand Years of Dreams\" sequences throughout the game itself.\n\n\"Lost Odyssey\" reportedly sold 40,000 copies in Japan on its first day at retail, around 50% of the shipment. As of February 17, 2008, the game has sold 104,417 copies in Japan according to \"Famitsu\" numbers. Its sales figures impressed Microsoft enough that they were considering turning \"Lost Odyssey\" into a series. As of April 2010, the game has sold 109,517 units in Japan, becoming the ninth best-selling game for the platform. The game has done much better in the West; according to NPD numbers \"Lost Odyssey\" debuted at #7, selling 203,000 in its debut month of February in North America. At its UK debut, it debuted at #6 in the gaming charts.\n\n\"Famitsu\" awarded the game a score of 36/40, with all four critics each giving the game a 9.\n\nAccording to Metacritic, the game received \"generally favorable reviews.\"\n\nThe issue many took with \"Lost Odyssey\" was its deliberately old-school gameplay mechanics, particularly the traditional combat system, which several critics found to be dull and dated, as well as the game's use of random battles, which were further deemed an issue by their purportedly lengthy load times. Xbox Focus gave the game a 4/5 rating, declaring its story as profound, but taking an issue with the camera control and the odd character design. Unlike other critics, however, Xbox Focus's Alex Yusupov deemed the combat and random battles as exhilarating, and that \"it's better to take a tried and true technique and make it better than introduce a completely new idea that could possibly screw up an entire game.\" IGN found that the ring-building system, immortals, and skill system added a fresh feel to the game's otherwise traditional combat, and 1UP.com praised the \"timed button press\" aspect of the battles, saying it makes them \"more engaging than you'd think.\"\n\nWhile the visual novel flashback sequences, penned by Kiyoshi Shigematsu, were widely acclaimed, critics were divided on the main story itself. RPGFan stated that the story and gameplay were both \"overused, uninspired, and stilted\", but that the memory sequences penned by Shigematsu were \"some of the richest, most emotionally charged storytelling seen in any RPG to date\". GameSpot praised \"Lost Odyssey\"s \"fascinating cast,\" character development, and \"great plot,\" and also called the combat system \"solid.\" The reviewer also described the flashbacks as \"well written and emotionally gripping.\" GameSpy, called the main plot and characters, \"shamelessly derivative.\" \"GamePro\" magazine agreed, declaring that the main story was not particularly compelling, although it noted that many subplots carried plenty of emotional weight. On the other hand, \"Game Informer\" magazine deemed the story line as being \"one of the most compelling tales ever told on the Xbox 360,\" and praised the \"cool combat system.\" GameTrailers said, \"what sets \"Lost Odyssey\" apart is a deeply moving story that places an emotional focal point on its characters.\"\n\nDespite critics' differing opinions in other areas, the game's graphics and high production values have received acclaim, although load times and framerate issues were also pointed out. However, it transpired that the copy that some reviewers received apparently had longer loading times than those of the retail version. GameSpot amended their review on February 19, 2008 to reflect this, but did not change their original score.\n\n"}
{"id": "1882467", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1882467", "title": "Order of Saint Stanislaus", "text": "Order of Saint Stanislaus\n\nThe Order of Saint Stanislaus (, ), also spelled Stanislas, was a Polish order of knighthood founded in 1765 by King Stanisław August Poniatowski of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. It remained under the Kingdom of Poland between 1765 and 1831. In 1831 it was incorporated under the Russian Empire until the Russian revolution (191)7.\n\nToday, there are two recognised orders that claim descent from the original Order of Saint Stanislaus: the Russian dynastic Order of Saint Stanislaus (House of Romanov), awarded by the head of the House of Romanov as former sovereigns of the Russian Empire, and the Polish Order of Polonia Restituta, a governmental order of merit awarded by the President of Poland and considered by some as a type of successor.\n\nStanisław August Poniatowski, King of Poland, established the \"Order of the Knights of Saint Stanislaus, Bishop and Martyr\" on 8 May 1765 Initially, the order was limited to 100 members who were required to prove four generations of nobility. The knights were required to pay for donations to poor people and to adhere to various rules of chivalry. \n\nDue to the rising influence of the Russian Empire on Central European affairs, the rules of awarding of the order were broken. After the Partitions of Poland, the order was resurrected in the Duchy of Warsaw, bestowing upon its recipients the title of hereditary nobility and requiring donations to a Warsaw hospital. Since 1815 in the Polish (Congress) Kingdom, the order, originally in a single class, was retained and divided into four classes.\n\nOn 25 January 1831, the Polish Parliament deposed Emperor Nicholas I of Russia from the throne of Poland, while he was also Grand Master (order) of the Order of Saint Stanislaus. Yet, after the downfall of the November Uprising the Imperial House of Romanov established the Royal and Imperial Order of Saint Stanislaus, incorporating it into the honours system of the Russian Empire in 1832, where it remained officially until the Russian Revolution 1917.\n\nThe order was abolished with the fall of the Romanovs in 1917 but, unlike other Polish orders awarded by the Tsars, the Order of Saint Stanislaus was not revived by the newly independent Second Polish Republic (possibly because in its Russian form it was often awarded by the imperial government to those Poles who co-operated with Russia rule making the order a symbol of subservience to an occupying power).\n\nInstead, the newly founded Order of Polonia Restituta was created as an attributed Polish successor to the order.\n\nBoth the Polish and Russian badges hung from a red ribbon with white strips near its borders (i.e., the colors of the Polish coat of arms and flag), a ribbon which they share with the modern Order of Polonia Restituta.\n\nThe order also had an eight-pointed star with straight rays with a central medallion bearing the letters \"SS\" surrounded by the Latin words \"Praemiando incitat\", which is in turn surrounded by a laurel wreath. The star has essentially the same design in both its Polish and Russian forms. \n\nThe original Polish badge of the order was a red enameled Maltese cross with white enameled Polish eagles between its arms and with a central medallion bearing an enameled image of Saint Stanislaus in his episcopal vestment surrounded by a gold laurel wreath. \n\nIn its original Polish form the knights of the Order wore a red, white and silver habit modelled on the traditional dress of a Polish nobleman (i.e., zupan, kontusz, pas kontuszowy and delia). \n\nIn the Russian version of the badge, the Polish white eagles were replaced with gold Russian double-headed imperial eagles, their wings partially overlapping the arms of the cross and the central medallion bearing the letters \"SS\" in red on a white enamel background instead of the original image of the saintly bishop, surrounded by a green enamel laural wreath. There is also a semi-circle of gold rays between each of the points of arms of the Maltese cross.\n\nToday, there are two main competing claims to the represent the Order of Saint Stanislaus: the Russian Order of Saint Stanislaus (Imperial House of Romanov), awarded by the head of the House of Romanov, and the Polish Order of Polonia Restituta, a governmental order of merit awarded by the President of Poland and considered by some as a type of successor.\n\nTwo other organisations in Poland, the Ordo Sancti Stanislai and the International Order of Saint Stanislaus, contemporarily describe themselves as merely private charitable organisations.\n"}

While the game has been praised as a faithful adaptation of the Stooges films, it has been criticized for repetitive gameplay and limited replay value.\n\nGame designer John Cutter designed the game as a kind of board game.\nThe Three Stooges must rescue an old woman's orphanage by earning money in minigames based on various Three Stooges films. These include cracker-eating contests (based on the Stooges short \"Dutiful But Dumb\") and boxing matches (based on the short \"Punch Drunks\"). Players select minigames by timing a button press as a hand randomly points to various symbols representing in-game events, including non-interactive events that can raise or lower the Stooges' cash total. Each event takes up one in-game day; players have 30 in-game days to earn as much money as possible.\n\nThe hand gradually speeds up from one day to the next, but can be slowed down by landing on a space that allows Moe to pummel Larry and Curly. The player must avoid mousetrap spaces, which injure the fingers on the hand; landing on four such spaces immediately ends the game, regardless of the number of days completed.\n\nSeveral different game endings are possible, depending on the amount of money the player has earned. These range from the banker foreclosing on the orphanage due to the Stooges' inability to collect enough money to pay the rent, to the orphanage being saved and renovated and the Stooges marrying the owner's three daughters.\n\nThe game included a fair amount of humor - the game itself loads initially as \"Defender of the Crown\" (another Cinemaware title) with a splash screen and music. The game version of the Stooges walk onto the screen, the music screeches to a halt, a Larry soundbite exclaims \"Hey, this looks like a kid's game!\", Moe replies \"You idiots!\", and follows up with a smacking noise and Curly yelling, \"OH!\". The NES port, made by Activision, used a slightly edited version of the \"Ghostbusters\" title screen instead, in order to promote \"Ghostbusters II\", and included an extra soundbite of Curly saying \"Hey, fellas! We're in the wrong game!\". The 2002 port by Crawfish Interactive kept the \"Defender of the Crown\" opening, only this time having Moe yell \"You idiots! We're in the wrong game!\", then having the Stooges walk along a country road with billboards advertising Crawfish, as well as the now-defunct Cinemaware and the then-upcoming game \"Wings\".\n\nThe game was later ported to the NES, developed by Beam Software and published by Activision. Cinemaware directly released a port for the Apple IIGS in 1990. Versions for the Game Boy Advance (developed by Crawfish Interactive) and PlayStation (developed by Flying Tiger) were published by Metro3D, Inc. and released in 2002. The game was also updated for release on Microsoft Windows and Apple Macintosh as one of Cinemaware's \"Digitally Remastered\" editions. A port was completed for the Game Boy Color, however it was cancelled in 2000 and only footage of the beta has been released.\n\nThe Amiga version of the game received mixed reviews, with the game's graphics and digital voices receiving most of the praise. Mark Patterson of Commodore User gave the game an 8 out of 10, citing positive impressions of the game's humor, writing that the game was \"probably the only game that has intentionally set out to make people laugh, and worked.\" \"Computer Gaming World\" wrote that the Amiga and Commodore 64 versions \"captured the Three Stooges magic\", stating that for fans of the trio it was \"simultaneously a delight and piece of 'living' memorabilia\". \"Compute!\" called \"The Three Stooges\" \"one of the high points of the season\", stating that the game \"\"looks\" like the Stooges, \"sounds\" like the Stooges ... and most important, \"feels\" like the Stooges\". However, Commodore Computing International criticized the game's limited replay value and long loading times. The publication also criticized the game's lack of a \"common theme\" and called the game \"a little disjointed.\" The Games Machine offered similar criticism, stating that while the game is \"a masterpiece in FX and presentation\", the gameplay is \"disappointingly shallow.\" Six reviewers in \"Digital Press\" gave the NES version 9, 7, 6, 7, 8, and 9 (all out of 10).\n\n"}

Hanna-Barbera Land only operated for two seasons before its owners, Kings Entertainment Company, sold the park to private investors. The amusement park had all its rides removed, with the new owners installing a water park with several water slides. Much of the park's Victorian buildings, street lights and landscaping remained. Splashtown USA opened to the public shortly after.\n\nIn the 1990s, the park changed owners twice: first to the Morris Family in 1994, and then to Six Flags in May 1999. The acquisition was made by Six Flags to eliminate the park from being a competitor to its Six Flags WaterWorld water park, also located in Houston. The park was renamed Six Flags SplashTown in 2000.\n\nFollowing the closure of Six Flags WaterWorld and the adjacent Six Flags AstroWorld in October 2005, Six Flags engaged in a restructuring of Six Flags SplashTown, which resulted in the termination of the park's General Manager, Operations Manager and Food Service Manager in early November 2005. In January 2006, it was announced that the former Operations Manager of WaterWorld would be the new Splashtown Operations Manager. Several of WaterWorld's attractions were relocated to SplashTown. The park underwent a \"facelift\" as well as general cleaning to prepare it for its opening day, April 28, 2006. The entrance received a new sign, with the addition of renovated buildings and ticket booths.\n\nIn January 2007, Six Flags announced that SplashTown, along with six other parks, would be sold for a total of $312 million. The agreement saw Six Flags sell the properties to PARC Management, who in turn sold the properties to CNL Lifestyle Properties. CNL would then lease the properties back to PARC Management under a 52-year triple-net lease. However, after less than three years into the 52-year contracts, CNL terminated their agreements with PARC Management in November 2010. In early 2011, CNL appointed Premier Attractions Management, LLC (now Premier Parks, LLC) as the new operators of the park. At the time, the limited liability company was led by former Six Flags employees Kieran Burke, the former chairman and CEO, and Gary Story, the former president and chief operating officer.\n\nIn November 2013, CNL Lifestyle Properties acquired rights to the Wet'n'Wild brand in the United States from Australian firm, Village Roadshow Theme Parks. In the months to follow CNL rebranded several of its properties to Wet'n'Wild water parks, including SplashTown Houston, which became Wet'n'Wild SplashTown. The park itself received a multimillion-dollar renovation.\n\nIn late 2016, CNL Lifestyle Properties announced that it was selling ownership of fifteen attraction properties, including Wet'n'Wild Splashtown, along with five small family entertainment centers to EPR Properties for approximately $456 million. The transaction was completed in April 2017. Premier Parks LLC remained as the operator. \n\nOn May 22, 2018, Six Flags acquired the leasing rights from Premier Parks LLC to manage several parks owned by EPR Properties. Splashtown was renovated in the offseason and in 2019 changed its name to Six Flags Hurricane Harbor Splashtown.\n\nCNL Terminates agreement with PARC\n"}

The industrial towns of Vapi, Dadra and Silvassa lie on the north bank of the river, and the town of Daman occupies both banks of the river's estuary.\n\nThe major development project on the river is the Daman Ganga Multipurpose project completed which benefits the state of Gujarat and the Union Territory of Dadra Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu. In 2015, a major river interlinking project involving inter-basin transfer of surplus water from the Daman Ganga called the \"Daman Ganga-Pinjal River Linking Project\" has been approved for implementation.\n\nThe two historical forts on either side of the river at Daman, are the Moti Daman ('Moti' means \"big\") on the southern bank and the Nani Daman ('Nani' means \"small\"), on the northern bank.\n\nThe Daman Ganga, also known as Dawan River, rises in the Sahyadri hills close to Ambegaon village in Dindori taluka of Nasik district of Maharashtra State. It raise at an elevation of 950m. The major tributaries of Daman and Vag run a course of and respectively before joining at Matunji to become the Daman Ganga River. Major part of the river lies in Maharashtra. Its total length from source to the Arabian Sea is . Some of major tributaries which originate and flow through the mountainous region of the states of Maharashtra, Gujarat and the Union Territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu are Dawan, Shrimant, Val, Rayate, Lendi, Wagh, Sakartond, Roshni, Dudhni, and Piperiya. As the river joins the sea at Daman, it is named Daman Ganga. At the estuary there is heavy sedimentation and hence the depth of water is shallow. Daman is located on both banks of the river (Portuguese name: Rio Sandalcalo). At the mouth of the river the bar is level bed made of hard sand, except for the North of the North point where the river enters the sea.\n\nThe river basin (part of the basin of West flowing rivers from Tapi to Tadri), which lies entirely on the western ghats, has a total catchment area of .

Rain fall occurs during the monsoon months from June to September with an annual average rainfall incidence of approximately (maximum recorded is reported to be .}. The soil conditions in the basin are categorized as \"reddish brown soil, coarse shallow soil, deep black soil and Coastal alluvial soil\". Silvassa, Vapi and Daman are the major towns on the banks of the river.\n\nThe places of tourist interest on the Daman Ganga River in Dadra and Nagar Haveli are Van Ganga and Vandhara Garden. There are also two historical forts on either side of the river at Daman, which face each other, known as Moti Daman on the southern bank, the larger of the two and the Nani Daman, smaller in size, on the northern bank.\n\nThere is an existing major irrigation project on the river called the Damanganga Reservoir Project, which is located near Madhuban village in Dharampur taluka of Valsad district of Gujarat. It is an inter-state multipurpose project of the Govt. of Gujarat and Union Territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu (DNHDD). The storage of this project is shared by the riparian state of Gujarat and Union Territory of DNHDD as the beneficiary region. The total volume of water to be shared is 516.63 MCM (million cubic metres) (420.50 MCM for irrigation and the balance 96.13 MCM for other uses, which is allotted to the riparian state and Union Territories; Gujarat has a share of 399.19 MCM, Dadra and Nagar Haveli's share is 83.33 MCM and of Daman is 34.20 MCM. The project was built from 1972 to 1998. It is a composite dam of masonry and earth-fill dams. The masonry dam of 58.6 m height with a spillway in the gorge section of the river of 350 m length; the spillway, with an ogee shape and a roller bucket for energy dissipation, is designed to rout a Probable Maximum Flood (PMF) discharge of 25,850 cumecs (cubic meters per second) controlled by 10 radial gates each of size .

The composite dam is founded in area with geological formations of amygdaloidal basalt, porphyritic basalt, dolerite, and agglomerate.\n\nAt the Full Reservoir level the reservoir water spread is which includes 987 ha of waste land and of agricultural land. Submergence also involved 12 villages completely and 24 villages partially. The Gross Command Area (GCA)is and the Cultural Command Area (CCA) of irrigation is on the left and right bank canals network benefiting the states of Gujarat, Dadra & Nager Haveli and Daman. Total length of the canals is with a design discharge of per second in the right bank canal and per second on the left bank canal. Irrigation covers 112 villages in Valsad district, 26 villages in Daman, and 24 villages in Dadra Nagar Haveli. The Project provides 58 million gallons per day for industrial and domestic water needs and also has a small power plant of 2 MW capacity. The cost of the project was shared between the participating states as per the Inter-State Agreement of 1992.\n\nThe river supplies potable drinking water to Vapi town, industries around the town and 11 villages in Daman from the head works located on the pick up weir on Daman Ganga River.\n\nThe Government of India's National Water Development Authority (NWDA) has proposed the Daman Ganga-Pinjal River Linking Project linking the Daman Ganga River to the Pinjal reservoir on the Pinjal River to the south, in the Vaitarna basin allowing surplus water from the Daman Ganga to be diverted south to Mumbai via the Pinjal reservoir. The feasibility report was prepared by NWDA in 2004, and in 2010 a tripartite agreement was signed between the Central government and the two state governments of Gujarat and Maharashtra. In January 2015, the project was approved for implementation.\n\nUnder this project the two reservoirs to be created by building dams are the Bhugad dam on Damanganga River in Gujarat and the Khargihill dam on the Vagh River near Behapada village in Thane in Maharashtra. The reservoirs will be linked by a pressure tunnel of and . The Bhugad-Khargihill and Khargihill-Pinjal tunnel which is totally in the Maharashtra state is a long and diameter tunnel and will transfer the surplus waters to the extent of 909 MCM annually to Mumbai City to supplement the present domestic and industrial water supply system, from the Pinjal reservoir to Greater Mumbai; this part of the project is to be implemented as per plans evolved by the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) and Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA). The dam on the Daman Ganga at Bhugad will be a composite dam of in height and long, to create a gross storage of 426.39 MCM and a live storage of 400.00 MCM.

The implementation of the entire project is planned to be completed over a nine-year period.\n\nThe Damanganga River downstream of Vapi up to its confluence with the sea is polluted from the effluents emerging from the industrial and domestic wastes of the Vapi town, Silvassa, Daman and Kachigaon. According to the Central Pollution Control Board's report the BOD value recorded at its monitoring station downstream of Kachogaon was a high of 30 mgl per liter. According to a study report of the Machhimar Adhikar Rahstriya Abhiyan due to the industrial effluents from the Vapi town the dissolved oxygen level is very low ar 0.1-mg/1 and Mercury content in the groundwater in the town is about ninety six times higher than the standards prescribed by the World Health Organization (WHO). Untreated effluents are directly discharged into the Damanganga and Kolak Rivers. This has resulted in pollution of the sea water to a limit of five nautical miles seriously affecting fish life. The Common Effluent Treatment was also reported to be dis-functional with about 1000 small-scale and artisanal fishers in four to five villages getting affected on account of the Sarigam Industrial Association's effluent disposal pipeline.\n\n\n"}

It stars Matt Dillon, Richard Crenna, Héctor Elizondo and Jessica Walter. The film tells the story of a working class boy who takes a summer job at a beach resort and learns valuable life lessons.\n\nIt was the first film to receive a PG-13 rating, although it was the fifth to be released with that rating (after \"Red Dawn\", \"The Woman in Red\", \"Dreamscape\" and \"Dune\"). Crenna received a Golden Globe Award nomination for his supporting role and Marisa Tomei made her big screen debut with a minor role in the film.\n\nIn the summer of 1963, Jeffrey Willis (Matt Dillon) joins some friends for a day of gin rummy at the El Flamingo Club, a private beach resort. There, he meets the girl of his dreams Carla Sampson (Janet Jones). After the gin game and being told of the club's strict policy regarding guests, Jeffrey is upset, but not for long, since he immediately lands a job as a car valet and eventually, cabana steward. Jeffrey is a kid from a middle class Brooklyn family and his father (Elizondo) does not approve of him working at the private club.\nHis hero and mentor at the resort is the reigning Gin rummy card game champ, Phil Brody (Crenna).\n\nJeffrey, a winning gin rummy player himself, and his friends admire Brody and how his wins at the Gin rummy table make him seem \"psychic,\" knowing which cards to give up. Brody also takes a liking to Jeffrey, eventually showing him his car business, and gives him hopes that car sales are where he belongs as a career.\n\nJeffrey gets further immersed in the \"easy buck\", as evidenced by Phil showing off his success, as opposed to Mr. Willis' manual labor, or the example of Phil's brother, who studied for years to become a lawyer but has had little financial return. During dinner, Jeffrey notably says he \"will not be needing college\" and plans to pursue being a car salesman instead. Jeffrey and his co-workers at the El Flamingo also venture to Yonkers Raceway together, risking cash on a horse tip but coming up short when the trotter breaks stride.\n\nEventually, Jeffrey leaves home to pursue the sales job. However, Brody, angry that Jeffrey disturbed him during a dance class, reveals to Jeffrey that the job opening at the car dealership is for a stock boy, not as a salesman as Jeffrey had been led to believe was his when he asked for it. Brody lectures Jeffrey in a similar lesson that Mr. Willis had \"You can't plant a tree and expect to hang a swing on it the next day\", and recommends Jeffrey accept the stock boy job to prove himself and work his way up. Jeffrey becomes shocked at his mentor's actions and reconsiders college. Near summer's end, Jeffrey observes that a regular onlooker, \"Big Sid\", is feeding signals to Brody, the true cause of Brody's winning ways. When Big Sid and a member of the gin team playing against Brody's team are overcome by the heat, Jeffrey fills in, opposing Brody, and seeking to help win back the unfair profits Brody won from his friends over the course of the summer. Jeffrey and his team eventually win back what was unfairly lost, including a good profit besides. Impressed that Jeffrey defeated him without cheating, Phil says they can \"skip this stock boy nonsense\" and offers him the salesman job, but Jeffrey declines.

The Fisher Body plant became part of the Eastern Aircraft Division of General Motors Corp. and was assigned the task of assembling fuselages for Grumman carrier-based aircraft.\n\nAlthough Chevrolet cars and trucks had represented the largest portion of the Baltimore plant's production, other car lines also have been manufactured. The versatility of the plant was tested in 1964 when Buicks, Chevrolets, Oldsmobiles and Pontiacs were assembled one after another on the same passenger car line. In the ensuing years, the number of car lines produced has changed several times. GMC Truck and Coach Division shared Baltimore's truck production as early as the 1947 model year.\n\nBaltimore Assembly scored a major coup with the 1984 decision to assemble the Chevrolet Astro/GMC Safari minivans there. The rival Dodge Caravan was selling briskly, but the truck-like GM vans were larger than most of the mini-vans then coming into production. The GM vans filled a unique market for a midsize van with large interior space and very good towing capacity. The vans were periodically updated with revised interiors and exterior styling during the very long production run. Both two-wheel drive (M van) and all-wheel drive (L-van) models were produced. Initial production from 1985 to 1989 was a short-body van, with an extended-body (aft of the rear wheels) option available from 1990 to 1994. Due to overwhelming popularity, only extended versions were available from 1995 to 2005. The plant closed its doors after the final shift on May 13, 2005. In total, approximately 3,200,000 Astro and Safari vans were produced at the Baltimore plant. GM has since sold the site to the developer Duke Realty, who has demolished the old plant and is rebuilding the site as an industrial park called the Chesapeake Commerce Center.\n\n"}

Wheel gymnasts do exercises in a large wheel or hoop known as the Rhönrad, gymnastics wheel, gym wheel, or German wheel, in the beginning also known as ayro wheel, aero wheel, and Rhon rod.\n\nThe large wheel consists of two circles, which are connected with six spokes. Two are simple tubes, two are equipped with a handle and two have a footrest. The diameter of the wheel depends on the length of the gymnast, so that the gymnast can hold himself on the grips when fully stretched. The wheels are available from a diameter of 130 to 245cm. The wheels weigh between 40 and 60 kg. They are available in several depths and colors.\n\nThe wheel was invented in 1925 by Otto Feick in Schönau an der Brend. The grandson of a blacksmith, Feick was inspired by the memory of an event from his childhood in Reichenbach, when he had tied sticks between two hoops that his grandfather had made and rolled down a hill.\n\nHe filed for a patent as \"wheel-gymnastic and sports equipment\". He had invented the wheel in Ludwigshafen am Rhein 1920–1922, on the grounds of the VSK Germania, a sports club, of which he was the founding chairman. The patent was issued on 8 November 1925; the name \"Rhönrad\" has been registered and protected since 1926 (\"Rhön\" is the name of the mountain region where the wheel was invented).\n\nThe Rhönrad was featured at the GeSoLei trade fair held in Düsseldorf in 1926.\n\nIn 1936, this sport was shown at the Olympic Games in Berlin, but was not presented as an Olympic discipline.\n\nThe focus of wheel gymnastics remains largely in Germany, but there are wheel groups in several countries and every 2 years the International Wheel Gymnastics Federation holds a World Championships competition. Former world champion wheel gymnast Wolfgang Bientzle moved from Germany to Chicago and runs his own company WHEEL JAM to educate and train people of every age to do Wheel gymnastics.\n\n\n"}

Before this album's release the ICP released \"Forgotten Freshness\" in 1995, but because of sample-clearing problems it was only released in the Detroit area and the mid-west. Many of the tracks on that album appeared again on these albums for wider distribution purposes.\n\nThree tracks, \"Life at a Risk\", \"Ghetto Zone\", and \"Ask You Somethin'\" do not appear on this album, despite appearing on the original Forgotten Freshness. It is the 2nd installment in the group's \"Forgotten Freshness album series\", their 3rd compilation album and their 11th overall release.\n\n\"Forgotten Freshness Volumes 1 & 2\" features several scrapped songs intended for some of the group's previous albums. The songs \"Fat Sweaty Betty,\" \"Willy Bubba,\" and \"I Didn't Mean To Kill 'Em\" were all intended to be released on \"Riddle Box\". \"Fat Sweaty Betty\" was eventually given away as a single at the group's two \"Mental Warp\" shows. The song \"House of Wonders\" was originally set to be released on \"The Great Milenko\", but was later released on \"Mutilation Mix\".\n\n\"Piggy Pie (Old School)\" is the original version of the song \"Piggie Pie,\" found on \"The Great Milenko\". The Walt Disney Company, owner of the group's label at the time, asked that the lyrics to the original be changed, threatening to not release the album otherwise. The song \"Southwest Strangla\" was planned to be released on Shaggy 2 Dope's second solo album \"Shaggs The Clown\", but the entire project was scrapped. In the beginning of the song, a news brief is played about the actual looting of Northwest Airlines Flight 255 which crashed on I-94 in Detroit in 1987.\n\nThe album also features two remixes, \"Mr. Johnson's Head\" and \"Hokus Pokus.\" \"Dead Pumpkins\" was the first Hallowicked single given away in 1994, while \"Mr. Rotten Treats\" and \"Halloween on Military Street\" were the 1995 and 1996 singles. With a change in beat and lyrics, the song \"Hey, Vato\" became \"Wagon Wagon\" found on the \"Ringmaster\" album. Some lyrics from the song are also found on the song \"Who Asked You,\" also on \"Ringmaster\".

Crews played Julius Rock on the UPN/CW sitcom \"Everybody Hates Chris\". He hosted the U.S. version of the game show \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire\" and starred in the BET reality series \"The Family Crews\". He appeared in films such as \"Friday After Next\" (2002), \"White Chicks\" (2004), \" Idiocracy\" (2006), \"Blended\" (2014), and the \"Expendables\" series. Since 2013, he has played NYPD Lieutenant Terry Jeffords in the sitcom \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine\". He began hosting \"America's Got Talent\" in 2019, following his involvement in the same role for the program's spin-off series, \"\".\n\nCrews played as a defensive end and linebacker in the National Football League, for the Los Angeles Rams, San Diego Chargers, and Washington Redskins, as well as in the World League of American Football with the Rhein Fire, and college football at Western Michigan University.\n\nCrews, a public advocate for women's rights and activist against sexism, has shared stories of the abuse his family endured at the hands of his violent father. He was included among the group of people named as \"Time\" Magazine's Person of the Year in 2017 for going public with stories of sexual assault.\n\nCrews was born on July 30, 1968 in Flint, Michigan, the son of Patricia and Terry Crews. He grew up in a strict Christian household in Flint and was raised mainly by his mother. His father was an alcoholic who was abusive to his mother. Crews received a flute from his great aunt, and took lessons for eight years.\n</ref>\n\nAfter earning his high school diploma from Flint Southwestern, he received a Chrysler-sponsored art scholarship at the Interlochen Center for the Arts in Interlochen, Michigan, which was followed by an Art Excellence scholarship and a full athletic scholarship for football at Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo, Michigan. As a defensive end for the WMU Broncos, Crews earned All-Conference honors and won the 1988 Mid-American Conference Championship.\n\nCrews was drafted by the Los Angeles Rams in the 11th round of the 1991 NFL Draft. His career included stints with the Rams (6 games), the San Diego Chargers (10 games), the Washington Redskins (16 games), and the Philadelphia Eagles (no games). He also played for the Rhein Fire during the 1995 WLAF season. Repeatedly cut from rosters, Crews often supplemented his football income by receiving portrait commissions from teammates.\n\nAfter retiring from the NFL in 1997, Crews moved to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career. He had held a long-standing ambition to work in the film industry, but up until then had no plans to pursue acting, and simply wanting to be involved in some way. A year earlier, he had co-written and co-produced the independent feature film \"Young Boys Incorporated\". A self-funded production filmed in Detroit with an anti-drug message, the film drew on his own observations, as well as those of his friends and family. Despite describing it as a \"horrible\" film, he credits the experience with getting him interested in the film industry.\n\nIn 1999, Crews auditioned for a role as a character athlete (known as Warriors) in the syndicated game show \"Battle Dome\", which became his first acting part. He played T-Money for two seasons until its cancellation in 2001. The audition process and the opportunity to perform in front of an audience made him realize that he wanted to pursue acting as a career. However, he failed to land another acting job for the following two years.\n\nAppearances in commercials, films, and music videos soon followed. His breakout role came in \"Friday After Next\" starring rapper-turned-actor Ice Cube, for whom Crews had previously worked as on-set security. Having never taken acting classes, instead he asked himself what the audience wanted, and he believes this ultimately brought him success. He now believes acting is what he was born to do and would not wish to have any other career, despite the physically demanding nature of the work.\n\nBased on his performance in \"White Chicks\" (2004), Adam Sandler changed a role in \"The Longest Yard\" (2005) to give it to Crews, who had auditioned for another role in the film. His role as Julius Rock, the father on the UPN/CW sitcom on \"Everybody Hates Chris\", brought Crews wider public recognition, and the show aired for four seasons from 2005-09. Since \"Everybody Hates Chris\", Crews has had main roles as husband and father Nick Kingston-Persons in the TBS sitcom \"Are We There Yet?\", which aired for three seasons from 2010–13, and as NYPD Sergeant Terry Jeffords in the ensemble cast of the Fox sitcom \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine\", which premiered in 2013 and ran for five seasons before it was picked up for a sixth season by NBC in 2018.\nCrews has appeared mainly in comedic roles, such as President Camacho in \"Idiocracy\", but he later found success in action roles beginning with his part as Hale Caesar in \"The Expendables\" series, which saw him make his first appearance in a film sequel. Although he has managed to sustain an athletic physique in his career as an actor, Crews has avoided being type-cast as a muscle-bound action hero and has attained critical success through exploiting the contrast of his elaborate character comedy with his physique, which extends to the point of even mocking the stereotype of the gym-obsessed bodybuilder. This contrast has also led to sustained work as part of various humorous Old Spice TV commercials.\n\nCrews has lent his voice to animations such as \"American Dad!\" and \"Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2\". Crews found he enjoyed the work and sought out more of it, finding satisfaction in how it carries his spirit into the animation. From 2010-11, Crews starred in his own reality series on BET, \"The Family Crews\", about his everyday life with his family. It ran for two seasons. From 2014-15, he hosted the syndicated game show \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire\". He has also been the American host of Netflix's \"Ultimate Beastmaster\".\n\nCrews cites the many similarities between acting and professional football, including the structure and expectations, as helping his transition between the two careers. He credits Reginald Hubbard with mentoring him in his early career in the film business.\n\nIn June 2017, Crews was cast in the science fiction comedy film \"Sorry to Bother You\". The film was released in theaters on July 6, 2018. Also in 2018, he appeared as Bedlam in the superhero film \"Deadpool 2\". Crews made appearances in the music videos for \"Pressure\" and “Algorithm” by British rock band Muse.\n\nCrews also starred in the video for Brittany Howard's 2019 song \"Stay High\" in which he lip syncs the vocals. \n\nCrews's first job in the entertainment industry was as a courtroom sketch artist in Flint, Michigan. He received an art scholarship from college before an athletic scholarship. He later worked as courtroom sketch artist for WJRT. During his football career, Crews supplemented his income by creating portraits of fellow players. At times it was the primary income on which his family depended, typically bringing $5,000 for a two-month commission. His work included a series of NFL-licensed lithographs. He believes his imaginative side has transferred itself to his acting work.\n\nCrews is a co-founder of design company Amen&Amen, with fashion designer Nana Boateng. Their first collection was a set of furniture and light fixtures designed by Ini Archibong.\n\nIn 2014, Crews released his autobiography, \"Manhood: How to Be a Better Man or Just Live with One\". In the book, Crews detailed his long-standing pornography addiction, which had seriously affected his marriage and his life, but which he overcame around 2009 and 2010 after entering rehabilitation. Since then he has taken an active role in speaking out about the condition and its impact.\n\nOn October 10, 2017, in the wake of numerous Hollywood actresses going public with their stories of sexual harassment and assault by film producer Harvey Weinstein, Crews revealed that a male Hollywood executive had groped him at a party in 2016 but he did not report the incident for fear of retaliation. It was later revealed that the \"high-level executive\" was Adam Venit, head of the motion picture department of the talent company William Morris Endeavor (WME).\n\nFor his part in coming forward with the sexual assault allegations, Crews was named as one of the \"Silence Breakers\" from the Time Person of the Year award in 2017. WME reportedly concluded from an investigation that the incident was isolated. Venit was demoted and returned to work after a one-month suspension. In response, Crews stated, \"Someone got a pass\". Crews filed a lawsuit against Venit and WME for sexual assault. Some witnesses stated that Venit had gotten intoxicated, dismissed the groping as \"horseplay\", and apologized to Crews the next day. WME responded to the lawsuit, arguing that their reaction to Crews' claims was \"both swift and serious\". In March 2018, prosecutors decided not to file any charges against Venit. The city attorney's office announced that the statute of limitations to prosecute Venit had expired, as the incident was in February 2016 and Crews had not reported it until November 2017.\n\nIn March 2019, Crews faced criticism and backlash after responding to a \"New York Times\" op-ed by human rights lawyer Derecka Purnell, who stated \"Love is not gendered. A child will not starve with only one gender loving them.\" Crews responded, \"But they will be severely malnourished.\" Crews deleted the tweet and apologized the next day after speaking with his \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine\" co-star Stephanie Beatriz, stating, \"Had a great talk with @iamstephbeatz this morning on set that shed a lot of light on why the LBGTQ community were hurt by my comments. I want to apologize for anyone who was triggered or felt targeted. I was speaking out of my very personal experiences as a Black Father.\"\n\nCrews married Rebecca King on July 29, 1989. They have five children and one grandchild. He is a devout Christian.\n\n"}

The brand is known for its designer jeans that were popular in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Since the 2000s, Jordache has also diversified into real estate in the United States and other ventures in Israel. The brand name Jordache is a contraction of Joe, Ralph, David, and Avi Naccache (Nakash).\n\nJordache originated in 1969, when brothers Joe, Ralph, and Avi Nakash (Naccache) opened a store in New York City that sold premium jeans. Inspired by European fashions, the brothers had developed a groundbreaking collection with a signature fit that was tight and sexy. Business expanded over the years, until the store was looted and set ablaze during the New York City blackout of 1977. In 1978, after they collected $120,000 from their insurance policy, they incorporated their business and started to manufacture. They had long been interested in the European denim market, where jeans were more body-conscious and fashion-forward.\n\nThe Nakashes' timing was right. At this moment, consumer taste in jeans was shifting from established brands such as Levi's to designer jeans such as Gloria Vanderbilt and Calvin Klein. However, Jordache jeans were barely distinguishable from other designer jeans on the market. To differentiate their brand, the brothers invested one quarter of their annual sales volume ($300,000 of their own money and $250,000 in loans) into an aggressive 1979 ad campaign. Jordache produced a television commercial starring an apparently topless woman in tight Jordache jeans riding a horse through surf. The ad was rejected by all three major United States television networks, but independent New York stations aired it, and Jordache increased significantly in popularity. Later, an additional one million dollars was spent on advertising, including full-color advertisements in magazines circulated nationally in the United States. One promotional gimmick that did not work out was the Jordache blimp, a poorly designed airship that crashed on October 8, 1980 at Lakehurst, New Jersey on its maiden flight. It was \"en route\" to a promotional gala and crashed 43 years after the \"Hindenburg\" airship disaster in the same city.\n\nIn the 1980s, the company expanded its reach with expansive licensing that generated up to $300 million per year of wholesale income. In 1989, the company had 100 licensees, manufacturing products as varied as children's socks, women's outerwear, jewelry, dresses, luggage, and umbrellas.\n\nIn the 1990s, this strategy appeared to have backfired, and Jordache products slid in popularity. The company's jeans \"lost their cachet, appealing mainly to inner-city youth and blue-collar workers, and typically selling at discount stores.\" When Jordache designer diapers were manufactured by a licensee in 1994, they \"seemed to symbolize Jordache's descent in the marketplace to mass-merchandise stores and discount outlets.\"\n\nToday, Jordache Enterprises is a privately held conglomerate. The company designs and manufactures a wide variety of denim, apparel and accessories. In 2018, Jordache unveiled a premium denim collection in celebration of the brand's 40th anniversary.\n\nThe brands owned by Jordache Enterprises include but are not limited to, Jordache, Earl Jeans, KIKIT Jeans, Maurice Sasson, Fubu Ladies, Airport, Blue Star, and Gasoline. Jordache is also an official licensee of the U.S. Polo Assn. brand. Jordache Enterprises also manufactures private label denim for companies worldwide. \n\n\n"}

After the meeting, Philip ordered the tree cut down and hacked to pieces, sending the message that he would offer no quarter to the English.\n\nA quite different account is given by the Minstrel of Rheims (c. 1260), a thirteenth-century historical fiction:\nKing Richard sent a message to the counts of Sancerre and of Barre, telling them that they took the king's bread and gave him nothing in return but if they were brave enough to come to the elm tree at Gisors, he would consider them truly courageous. The French nobles sent the message back that they would come the next day, at the third hour, to cut the tree down, in spite of him. When the English king heard that they were coming to cut down the tree, he had the trunk reinforced with bands of iron, that were wrapped five times around it. The next morning the French nobles armed themselves, and assembled five squadrons of their men, one of which was led by the count of Sancerre, another by the count of Chartres, the third by the count of Vendôme, the fourth by the count of Nevers, and the fifth by Sir William of Barre and Sir Alain of Roucy. They rode up to the elm tree at Gisors, with the crossbowmen and carpenters out front, and they had in their hands sharp axes and good pointed hammers, with which to cut the bands that were fastened around the tree. They stopped at the elm tree, tore off the bands, and cut it down, in spite of all resistance.\n\nThe event has been used in the history proposed by Pierre Plantard and other pseudo-historical theories. In this context, the \"Cutting of the elm\" was portrayed as marking the split between the Knights Templar and the Priory of Sion.\n\n"}
{"id": "1882527", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1882527", "title": "Sukha", "text": "Sukha\n\nSukha (Sanskrit, Pali; Devanagari: सुख) means happiness, pleasure, ease, joy or bliss, in Sanskrit and Pali. Among the early scriptures, 'sukha' is set up as a contrast to 'preya' (प्रेय) meaning a transient pleasure, whereas the pleasure of 'sukha' has an authentic state happiness within a being that is lasting. In the Pāli Canon, the term is used in the context of describing laic pursuits, meditative absorptions, and intra-psychic phenomena.\n\nAccording to Monier-Williams (1964), the etymology of \"sukha\" is \"said to be \"su\" ['good'] + \"kha\" ['aperture'] and to mean originally 'having a good axle-hole'...\" Thus, for instance, in the Rig Veda \"sukha\" denotes \"running swiftly or easily\" (applied, e.g., to chariots). \"Sukha\" is juxtaposed with \"dukha\" (Sanskrit; Pali: \"dukkha\"; often translated as \"suffering\"), which was established as the major motivating life principles in early Vedic religion. This theme of the centrality of dukkha was developed in later years in both Vedic and the offshoot Buddhist traditions. The elimination of dukkha is the \"raison d'être\" of early Buddhism.\n\nIn the Pali Canon and related literature, the term is used in a general sense to refer to \"well-being and happiness\" (\"hitasukha\") in either this present life or future lives. In addition, it is a technical term associated with describing a factor of meditative absorption (jhāna) and a sensory-derived feeling (vedanā).\n\nIn the Pali Canon, the Buddha discusses with different lay persons \"well-being and happiness\" (\"hitasukha\") \"visible in this present life\" (\"diha-dhamma\") and \"pertaining to the future life\" (\"samparāyika\"), as exemplified by the following suttas.\n\nIn the \"Anaa Sutta\" (AN 4.62), the Buddha describes four types of happiness for a \"householder partaking of sensuality\" (\"gihinā kāma-bhoginā\"):\nOf these, the wise (\"sumedhaso\") know that the happiness of blamelessness is by far the greatest householder happiness. Economic and material happiness is not worth one sixteenth part of the spiritual happiness arising out of a faultless and good life.\n\nIn the \"Kālāmā Sutta\" (AN 3.65), townspeople ask the Buddha how they are to ascertain which spiritual teaching is true. The Buddha counsels that one should \"enter and dwell\" (\"upasampajja vihareyyātha\") in \"things\" or \"qualities\" (\"dhammā\") that are:\nUsing the latter criterion, the Buddha then asks the townspeople to assess greed (\"lobha\"), hate (\"dosa\") and delusion (\"moha\") whereby it is agreed that entering and dwelling in non-greed, non-hate and non-delusion lead to well-being and happiness. The Buddha states that, given this understanding, a noble disciple (\"ariyasāvako\") pervades all directions with lovingkindness, compassion, sympathetic joy and equanimity (see the four \"brahmaviharas\"); and, by doing so, one purifies oneself, avoids evil-induced consequences, lives a happy present life and, if there is a future karmic rebirth, one will be born in a heavenly world.\n\nIn the \"Dighajānu Sutta\" (AN 8.54), Dighajānu approaches the Buddha and states:\nIn a manner somewhat similar to his exposition in the aforementioned \"Anaa Sutta\", the Buddha identifies four sources that lead to well-being and happiness in the current life:\nIn terms of well-being and happiness in the next life, the Buddha identifies the following sources:\n\nAs indicated above, in the \"Kālāmā Sutta\", the Buddha identifies the practice of the four divine abodes (\"brahmavihara\") as being conducive to \"one's own\" well-being and happiness. The first of these abodes is mettā (benevolence, kindness) which is, for instance, classically expressed in the Pali canon's \"Karaniya Mettā Sutta\" (\"Scripture of Compassionate Benevolence\") (Sn 1.8) by the sincere wish (in English and Pali):\n\nSimilarly, the Pali commentaries (SN-A 128) explicitly define \"mettā\" as \"the desire to bring about the well-being and happiness [of others]\" (\"hita-sukha-upanaya-kāmatā\") Thus, in Buddhism, to dwell wishing for others' general happiness is conducive to the development of one's own happiness.\n\nIn the Buddhist frameworks of the five aggregates (Sanskrit: \"skandha\"; Pali: \"khandha\") and dependent origination (Sanskrit: \"pratītyasamutpāda\"; Pali: paticcasamuppāda), \"feelings\" or \"sensations\" (\"vedanā\") arise from the contact of an external object (such as a visual object or sound) with a sensory organ (such as the eye or ear) and consciousness. In the Pali Canon, such feelings are generally described to be of one of three types: pleasant (\"sukha\"), unpleasant (\"dukkha\"), or neither-unpleasant-nor-pleasant (\"adukkha-asukha\").\n\nIn Buddhist meditation, the development of concentrative absorption (Sanskrit: \"dhyāna\"; Pali: \"jhāna\") is canonically described in terms of the following five factors:\n\nAs illustrated in the table above, both \"pīti\" and \"sukha\" are born of bodily seclusion and mental quietude. The \"Visuddhimagga\" distinguishes between \"pīti\" and \"sukha\" in the following experiential manner:\n\nProviding a bare-bones conditional chain of events that overlaps the above more narrative exposition, the \"Upanisa Sutta\" (SN 12.23) states that \"sukha\" arises from tranquillity (\"passaddhi\") of the body and mind, and in turn gives rise to concentration (\"samādhi\"). Citing traditional post-canonical Pali literature related to this discourse, Bodhi (1980) adds the following functional definition of \"sukha\":\n\nNibbāna (Sanskrit: \"Nirvāṇa\") entails the foundational extinction or \"blowing out\" of the processes of unwholesome desire, aversion, and delusion. From the perspective of awakened experience, the latter deleterious processes are appreciated as \"agitations\" of the mind. In comparative contrast to such agitation, \"sukha\" and its cognates are at places in the Pali Canon used to characterize the calm of Nibbāna, the \"Unconditioned,\" as a bliss:\n\nIn the Yoga Sūtras, Patañjali uses the word 'sukha' when he defines asana as the balance between \"Sukha\" and \"Stirah\" (strength, steadiness, firmness).\n\nSome researchers have proposed that a \"shift\" in the activity of the medial prefrontal cortex is what supports a state of inner fulfillment and equanimity.\n"}

{"id": "1882536", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1882536", "title": "Dancing House", "text": "Dancing House\n\nThe Dancing House (), or Fred and Ginger, is the nickname given to the Nationale-Nederlanden building on the Rašínovo nábřeží (Rašín Embankment) in Prague, Czech Republic. It was designed by the Croatian-Czech architect Vlado Milunić in cooperation with Canadian-American architect Frank Gehry on a vacant riverfront plot. The building was designed in 1992 and was completed four years later in 1996.\n\nThe non-traditional design was controversial at the time because the house stands out among the Baroque, Gothic and Art Nouveau buildings for which Prague is famous. The then Czech president, Václav Havel, who lived next to the site for decades, had avidly supported this project, hoping that the building would become a center of cultural activity.\n\nGehry originally named the house \"Fred and Ginger\" (after the famous dancers Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers – the house resembles a pair of dancers) but this nickname is now rarely used. Gehry himself was later \"afraid to import American Hollywood kitsch to Prague\", and thus discarded his own idea.\n\nThe \"Dancing House\" is set on a property of great historical significance. Its site was the location of a house destroyed by the U.S. bombing of Prague in 1945. The plot and structure lay decrepit until 1960 when the area was cleared. The neighboring plot was co-owned by the family of Václav Havel who spent most of his life there. As early as 1986 (during the Communist era), Vlado Milunić, then a respected architect in the Czechoslovak milieu, conceived an idea for a project at the place and discussed it with his neighbour, the then little-known dissident Václav Havel. A few years later, during the Velvet Revolution Havel became a popular leader and was subsequently elected president of Czechoslovakia. Thanks to his authority the idea to develop the site grew. Havel eventually decided to have Milunić survey the site, hoping for it to become a cultural center, although this was not the result.\n\nThe Dutch insurance company Nationale-Nederlanden (since 1991 ING Bank) agreed to sponsor the building of a house on site. The \"superbank\" chose Milunić as the lead designer and asked him to partner with another world-renowned architect to approach the process. The French architect Jean Nouvel turned down the idea because of the small square footage, but the well-known Canadian-American architect Frank Gehry accepted the invitation. Because of the bank's excellent financial state at the time, it was able to offer almost unlimited funding for the project. From their first meeting in 1992 in Geneva, Gehry and Milunić began to elaborate Milunić's original idea of a building consisting of two parts, static and dynamic (\"yin and yang\"), which were to symbolize the transition of Czechoslovakia from a communist regime to a parliamentary democracy.\n\nThe style is known as deconstructivist (\"new-baroque\" to the designers) architecture due to its unusual shape. The \"dancing\" shape is supported by 99 concrete panels, each a different shape and dimension. On the top of the building is a large twisted structure of metal nicknamed \"Mary'.\n\nIn the middle of a square of buildings from the eighteenth and nineteenth century, the Dancing House has two main parts. The first is a glass tower that narrows at half its height and is supported by curved pillars; the second runs parallel to the river and is characterized by undulating mouldings and unaligned windows.\n\nThe famous dancers Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers are represented in the structure. A tower made of rock is used to represent Fred. This tower also includes a metal head. A tower made of glass is used to represent Ginger.\n\nThis design was driven mainly by aesthetic considerations: aligned windows would make evident that the building has two more floors, although it is the same height as the two adjacent nineteenth century buildings. The windows have protruding frames, such as those of paintings, as the designer intended for them to have a three-dimensional effect. The winding mouldings on the façade also serve to confuse perspective and diminish contrast with the surrounding buildings.\n\nThe British architect, Eva Jiřičná, designed most of the interior. The building is 9 floors tall and consists of two floors underground. The layout of each of the floors varies due to the asymmetric shape of the building, causing the rooms inside to also be asymmetric. The commercial areas of the building are in the lobby and the first floor. The six floors above are used primarily as office spaces. The ninth floor housed a restaurant. Since the building takes a slim shape, and the building is split into two parts vertically, the office space is limited. To make the most of the space, architect Jiřičná used design elements common in ships and incorporated small hallways into the interior of the building. The total interior of the building is 3,796 sqm.\n\nIn 2016, over a course of five months, two floors of the building were renovated into a 21-room hotel by Luxury Suites s.r.o. The hotel also has apartments available in each of the tower named after Fred and Ginger. The Ginger & Fred Restaurant now operates on the seventh floor. There is now a glass bar on the eighth floor. There is also now an art gallery in the building.\n\nThe general shape of the building is now featured on a gold 2,000 Czech koruna coin issued by the Czech National Bank. The coin completes a series called \"Ten Centuries of Architecture\". The Dancing House won Time Magazine's design contest in 1997. The Dancing House was also named one of the 5 most important buildings in the 1990s by Architekt Magazine.\n\nThe Dancing House has been called inappropriate in the classical city of Prague. The style, shape, heavy asymmetry, and material were seen as out of place by critics. \n\n\n"}

Guthridge initially gained recognition after serving for 30 years as Dean Smith's assistant at the University of North Carolina. Following Dean Smith's retirement in 1997, Guthridge served as head coach of the Tar Heels for three seasons. He took the team to the NCAA Final Four twice in his three seasons and was named national coach of the year in 1998, before retiring in 2000.\n\nGuthridge was born in Parsons, Kansas. He attended Kansas State University, and graduated with a B.S. in Mathematics in 1960 and an M.A. in Education in 1963. He was a member of the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity. While a student at Kansas State, Guthridge played guard under head coach Fred \"Tex\" Winter, and helped the team advance to the 1958 Final Four. After graduating from Kansas State, he coached at Scott City High School in Kansas for two seasons before returning to his alma mater as an assistant coach for Tex Winter from 1962-1967. In five years on Winter's staff, Guthridge helped lead the Wildcats to a 93-43 record, a pair of Big Eight Conference crowns and the 1964 NCAA Final Four. He also was head golf coach for the Wildcats.\n\nFollowing his stint at Kansas State, Guthridge moved to North Carolina to join the staff of fellow Kansas native Dean Smith. From 1972 onward, he was Smith's top assistant. In 1976, he also served as an assistant coach to Smith as the United States won the gold medal in men's basketball at the Summer Olympics in Montreal.\n\nAs an assistant, Guthridge was renowned for his success in coaching the fundamentals of pivot play to a long series of successful UNC big men, and as the Tar Heels' primary shooting coach. Guthridge also handled many day-to-day responsibilities in the program and oversaw UNC's summer basketball camps. While serving as an assistant coach, Guthridge turned down several head coaching opportunities, preferring to remain in Chapel Hill working alongside Smith. On one occasion, he actually accepted the head coaching post at Penn State, but stepped down from the post a few days later.\n\nDean Smith unexpectedly retired as head basketball coach at North Carolina just two months before the start of the 1997–98 season, and Guthridge was immediately named his successor. School officials stressed that Guthridge was not merely a placeholder for then-Kansas coach Roy Williams, signing him to a five-year contract.\n\nIn his three seasons as head coach Guthridge led the Tar Heels to the NCAA Final Four twice, in 1998 and again in 2000. He is one of five people to have appeared in the Final Four as both a player and coach. In 1998, Guthridge inherited a team that had been to the 1997 Final Four the previous year under Smith. With a wealth of returning talent, Guthridge instituted a \"six starters\" system, whereby the team's top six players, Antawn Jamison, Vince Carter, Ed Cota, Shammond Williams, Ademola Okulaja and Makhtar N'Diaye rotated positions in the starting five. Guthridge coached that team to the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament championship, a school record-tying 34 wins (including 30 wins going into the NCAA Tournament – the most in school history at the time) and an appearance in the Final Four, where they lost to Utah. Following the 1997–98 season, several organizations named him National Coach of the Year and he received the Naismith College Coach of the Year award.\n\nThe next season, the team earned a #3 seed in the 1999 NCAA tournament, but it was upset in the first round by Weber State – as of the 2018-19 season, the only time that the Tar Heels have failed to win a game in the tournament since it dropped first-round byes in 1982. In 2000, the Tar Heels struggled in the regular season, falling out of the polls for the first time since the start of the 1990-91 season. The team finished 18-13 – UNC's worst regular-season record in 11 years. However, the team came alive in the 2000 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. With the 8th seed in the South Region, they upset top-seeded Stanford in the second round and continued on to the Final Four, where the Tar Heels lost to Florida. After the 2000 season, Guthridge retired from coaching.\n\nGuthridge was involved in a total of 14 men's Final Fours as either a player or coach, more than any other person in history—one each as a player and assistant at Kansas State, 10 as a North Carolina assistant, and two as North Carolina head coach.\n\nHe died at his home on May 12, 2015 after an extended illness, alongside his family.\n\n\n"}

This development came in coincidence after the start of the Sino-Soviet split.\n\nThe submachine gun was type classified in 1979 and entered mass production in 1983.\n\nThe People's Liberation Army (PLA) General Staff Department issued a requirement for a weapon that can be used by Chinese military and police forces who handle public security, communications and other rear guard duties. The 208th Research Institute of China Ordnance Industry was directed to head the design.\n\nThe Type 79 was supposed to enter service with the PLA after initial production was made from 1981 to 1982. During the war with Vietnam, Chinese soldiers on recon operations used the Type 79 as their main weapon, together with the Type 64.\n\nIt became notorious in Chinese history since it was widely used by factions working for Lin Biao and the Gang of Four.\n\nThe weapon found immediate acceptance within the People's Armed Police and Public Security Police forces after the PLA phased them out of service. The excessive rate of fire, limited magazine capacity and reliability issues, including problems of jamming were the reasons why the PLA decided to drop them as the main submachine gun.\n\nFrom 1981 to 1992, more than 200,000 Type 79s were made.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Type 79s still in service were retrofitted with railed fore-ends to equip them with tactical accessories like gunsights and new muzzle brake devices. This was first seen with the Guangzhou Public Security Police.\n\nOther police forces that adopted the modernized Type 79s included the Shenzhen, Dongguan and Panyu Public Security Police forces.\n\nThere are plans to replace the Type 79 in service with Chinese law enforcement agencies with the JH16-1, which was introduced in 2017 and chambered in 9x19mm. In PLA service, it was replaced by the QCW-05 in 2001.\n\nFrom the 1981 pilot production, the total production of the Type 79 was nearly 200,000 until 1992 under Liu Zhitong. The highest years of production were between 1988 and 1991. During that period the Type 79 was produced at a rate of more than 30,000 per year. The developmental period of Type 79 was 15 years with a staff of over 70 people.\n\nFrom 1971 to 1975, the prototypes failed twice in various torture tests, forcing the design committee to redesign it. This was mainly because the design of the chamber could not handle the pressure of 7.62x25 Tokarev ammunition.\n\nThe design was made for use with the PLA, keeping its weight light for jungle warfare operations.\n\nThe Type 79 fires 7.62 millimeter caliber steel-cored pistol bullets in either the automatic or semiautomatic mode. The gun is gas-operated, with a foldable butt stock. The fire selector is made after the design of the Type 56 assault rifle with the stock made from stamped steel. Setting it to \"1\" makes the weapon fire on single shot while setting it to \"2\" makes the weapon fire in bursts. Sights can be used to fire up to 100 and 200 meters.\n\nThe extended magazine housing serves as the \"de facto\" forward grip.\n\nThe first project to upgrade the Type 79 was in 2000 when Hong Kong weapon designer Li Jiahao was tasked to create a conversion kit that would allow the user to attach a SureFire-type tac light and a laser sight. This kit was used by the Guangzhou and Dongguan Public Security Police.\n\nLi Jiahao continued to work on first conversion kit, which resulted in the creation of another variant known as PEAK 79. This was first shown to the public at the first China International Police Equipment Expo in 2002, which was subsequently adopted by the Shenzhen Public Security Police in the same year. The PEAK 79 consists of a Heckler & Koch MP5-type fore-end with a SureFire tac light built in with the addition of a C-MORE red dot scope. \n\nIntroduced in 2008, WTW-79H is the simplified version of the PEAK 79 that allows for the installation of a tac light and laser sight.\n\nThe TAPS79 (known as the Tactical Adapter Platform System for Type 79 SMG) is built with provisions for MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rails and can have an OKO 8W red dot sight attached on the upper receiver. They were created at the same as PEAK 79, but TAPS 79 was not made public until working samples were exhibited in 2003. Testing on Type 79s with TAPS79 equipped did not finish until the end of 2003. It's known to be used by the Foshan and Guangzhou Public Security Police forces. Some models using the kit were also equipped with a corner assist shooting device mounted on the red dot scope.\n\nThe TAPS79 has five iteration.\n\nLi's improvement versions of TAPS79. \n\nIn 2014, a weapons designer Wang Jie tested a conversion kit that allows for the installation of a new set of rails over the barrel and a collapsible stock.\n\nThe Type 79 was reported to be tested in an operational briefcase-type device, equipped with a laser sight for aiming. As of 2014, it was reported to have completed combat trials with Chinese police forces, including for those stationed at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse.\n"}

After the City of Rochester built a marine passenger terminal, CATS ordered a high-speed catamaran vessel from Austal Ships in Perth, Western Australia, based on a modified version of the Auto-Express 86 model. The modifications were mostly in terms of the vessel's beam (or width), as it needed to be able to transit through the locks of the St. Lawrence Seaway. The vessel's registered name was \"Spirit of Ontario I\" and it arrived at Rochester on April 27, 2004.\n\nCATS heavily promoted the service and ran a contest with citizens in Ontario and New York for a marketing name for its operation, with the prize being a lifetime boarding pass. The winning name for the service was \"The Breeze\" and many people assumed this was the name of the vessel, however its registered name remained \"Spirit of Ontario I\". The ferry is more than 280 feet long and can carry more than 750 passengers and 220 cars. The ferry features bars, a restaurant, movie theater, children's play area, business class, wireless Internet service, and an arcade.\n\nScott Associates Architects Inc was selected as the designer for the Toronto ferry terminal in the Inner Harbour area.\n\nThe vessel began daily service between both ports with several 2.5 hour crossings per day, beginning on June 17, 2004. By the mid-summer, most crossings were at or near capacity and the service appeared to be successful.\n\nSince the vessel was operating between two international ports, CATS decided to register \"Spirit of Ontario I\" under the flag of Bahamas, a flag of convenience nation, to avoid Canadian or U.S. taxes. It was still required to meet all United States Coast Guard and Canadian Coast Guard safety requirements, however Canadian and U.S. registered vessels had the benefit of not requiring to pay for pilotage services, a requirement for all foreign registered vessels.\n\nThis decision by CATS (which cost upwards of $6000/crossing), along with a series of unfortunate events related to charges for customs and immigration services, marine passenger terminal facilities in Toronto, and a poorly executed business plan, not to mention various delays in seeing the start of service, saw CATS shut down the entire operation on September 7, 2004, after only 11 weeks of service.\n\nFollowing the CATS bankruptcy, the vessel remained docked in Rochester. On February 28, 2005 a bankruptcy auction sold \"Spirit of Ontario I\" for $32 million (USD) to Rochester Ferry Company LLC, a subsidiary of the City of Rochester. Rochester Ferry Company LLC announced in April 2005 that it had selected Bay Ferries Great Lakes Limited to operate the service using \"Spirit of Ontario I\", with the service marketed under the name \"The Cat\". The service resumed June 30, 2005.\n\n"}

The House took up debate of the resolution on October 26, 2005. The resolution failed to pass by a 324-85 margin, thereby enacting the list of recommendations. The Secretary of Defense was required to begin implementing the recommendations by September 15, 2007 and to complete implementation no later than September 15, 2011.\n\n\nPentagon officials calculated that, if adopted in full by the nine-member BRAC Commission, the recommendations would have saved almost $50 billion over 20 years. The BRAC Commission (officially known as the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission) disputed this claim, pointing out what it considered to be significant flaws in the Department's methodology. The Commission recalculated the 20-year savings of the DOD recommendation list at just above $37 billion. Between late May and late August, the Commission reviewed the list and amended many of the Pentagon's recommendations, removing several major installations from the closure list. The Commission calculated the overall 20-year savings to the government in carrying out its amended list of recommendations as close to $15 billion.\n\nOn May 12, 2005 Gen. Richard Myers, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that the two-year effort to produce the list had several objectives:\n\nThe 2005 BRAC round was the fifth since the process was initiated in 1988, and the first since 1995. It differed significantly from preceding rounds in several respects:\n\nMajor facilities slated for closure included these:\n\nMajor facilities slated for realignment included these:\n\nBy merging adjacent installations belonging to different services 13 Joint Bases were created.\n\nThe 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission resulted in a $35 billion increase in military spending, partly due to building new facilities. The military claimed, however, that it also resulted in a $4 billion reduction in annual spending.\n\n\n"}

Owned by Ideastream, it is sister to NPR member radio station WCPN (90.3 FM) and classical music station WCLV (104.9 FM). The three stations share studio facilities at the Idea Center on Playhouse Square in Downtown Cleveland; WVIZ's transmitter is located in suburban Parma, Ohio.\n\nWVIZ also operates a translator, W34FP-D (UHF channel 34), licensed to Eastlake, which serves the far eastern portions of the Cleveland market. Its transmitter is located in Thompson, Ohio.\n\nWVIZ was founded by Betty Cope, a former producer at Cleveland's ABC affiliate, WEWS (channel 5), who recognized the value of non-commercial educational television for the schools. After a long struggle to clear all the hurdles, the station signed on the air on February 7, 1965, just in time for the start of the Cleveland school year's second semester. It was the 100th public television station to sign on in the United States. The station's original studios were located in Cleveland's Max Hayes Trade School.\n\nThe first voice heard on WVIZ was that of Alan R. Stephenson, Ph.D. As the first director of WVIZ's educational television services department, Stephenson's duties included casting, setting budgets, and acting as executive producer for dozens of local non-commercial educational television productions.\n\nWVIZ was originally a member station of National Educational Television (NET), which was reorganized into PBS in 1970. While some large-market PBS stations established themselves with prime time series, WVIZ remained committed first and foremost to Northeast Ohio's schools, and chose not to engage in national productions for a number of years, although it did produce \"Truly American\", an instructional television program meant for in-school use. It also worked with KETC to produce another instructional television program in about 1972, titled \"Inside/Out\". However, when PBS began transmitting its programs via satellite in 1978, WVIZ hired its first executive producer, Milton Hoffman. He oversaw a few WVIZ productions before resigning in 1982. The next executive producer was Dennis Goulden, formerly of NBC station WKYC-TV (channel 3). Goulden was responsible for the creation of a number of programs and series, such as \"Kovels on Collecting\", \"Producers Showcase\", \"Mediscene\", \"Dimension\" and \"CookSmart\". He credits Betty Cope with their creation because, as Goulden stated, she let him experiment. He also gave Larry Elder (now a nationally syndicated radio host) his first show.\n\nThe station also aired specials such as a Paul Meincke-hosted special on the tenth anniversary of busing in Cleveland, and an hour-long special on Margaret Bourke-White. \"Mediscene\" was a medical series hosted by former nurse M. R. Berger (now deceased). \"CookSmart\" was hosted by Susie Heller, and featured guests including Jacques Pepin and Julia Child. \"Dimension\" was a monthly series modeled along the lines of CBS' \"Sunday Morning\". \"Kovels on Collecting\" was a well-traveled showcase of the wonderfully talented Ralph and Terry Kovel. Goulden worked with the station for approximately four years; WVIZ replaced Goulden quickly in mid-1988 with Mark Rosenberger.\n\nOn June 1, 1993, after 28 years at the helm, Betty Cope stepped down as president of WVIZ. Her post went to Jerrold Wareham, the former general manager at Greater Dayton Public Television (operating WPTD in Dayton and WPTO in Oxford). In 1996, WVIZ debuted the program \"Cleveland Memories\". Wareham effectively rid WVIZ of its instructional television programming, filling the daytime hours with PBS Kids series such as \"Barney & Friends\". The station's branding was also modified to \"WVIZ/PBS\" in December 1999.\n\nIn December 2001, WVIZ merged with radio station WCPN to form Ideastream. The new grouping was formed to establish a unified source for public broadcasting and lectures. In early 2006, WVIZ and WCPN moved to a new fully digital studio facility at the Playhouse Square in the Cleveland Theater District; the new facility has an auditorium and studios for dance to music. WVIZ was originally based from studios on Brookpark Road, while WCPN was headquartered out of rented space at Cleveland State University. WVIZ is one of the few PBS member stations to have a new updated digital studio center.\n\nThe station's digital channel is multiplexed:\n"}

Released March 28, 1995 on Columbia Records, it is Big L's only album to be released during his lifetime. Recording sessions took place primarily at Powerplay Studios in Queens, New York in mid-to-late 1994. Production was handled by Buckwild, Lord Finesse, Showbiz and Craig Boogie.\n\nThe album debuted at number 149 on the US \"Billboard\" 200 and number 22 on R&B/Hip-Hop Albums, but did not chart internationally. \"Lifestylez ov da Poor & Dangerous\" spawned three singles: \"Put It On\", \"M.V.P.\", and \"No Endz, No Skinz\", the first two both peaked within the top 25 on the US Hot Rap Tracks and Hot Dance Singles Sales. Upon its release, the album received positive reviews from music critics, earning praise for Big L's lyricism and wordplay, and is now considered by many fans as a classic album. As of August 2000, the album has sold 200,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan.\n\nBig L began writing rhymes in 1990 and his first professional appearance came on the B-side of \"Party Over Here\" by Lord Finesse in 1992. Around this time, L joined Lord Finesse's Bronx-based hip hop group Diggin' in the Crates Crew (D.I.T.C.). The group consisted of Lord Finesse, Diamond D, O.C., Fat Joe, Buckwild, Showbiz and A.G. He founded Harlem centered rap group Children of the Corn with fellow aspiring MC's Killa Cam, Murda Mase, Bloodshed and Herb McGruff; when Bloodshed died in a car accident in 1997, the group later disbanded.\n\nIn 1993, Big L submitted a four track cassette tape to Columbia Records, who soon after signed him to their company. The album title is a play on the 1984-95 Television series, \"Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous\".\n\nRecording for \"Lifestylez ov da Poor & Dangerous\" mainly took place at Powerplay Studios (Queens, New York); the songs \"Put It On\" and \"Danger Zone\" were recorded at Unique Studios (New York City, New York) and the songs \"M.V.P.\" and \"Street Struck\" were recorded at Chung King Studios (New York City, New York). James Niedermeyer worked with Big L on the album and heavily influenced the lyrics on songs such as \"Danger Zone\" and \"All Black\".\n\n\"Lifestylez ov da Poor & Dangerous\" was produced by mainly members of Big L's group, Diggin' in the Crates Crew: Buckwild, Lord Finesse (who produced most of the album), and Showbiz. Craig Boogie as well as Kid Capri (who was often referred to as an honorary member of D.I.T.C.) also helped with the production of the album. The album also features guest appearances from a young Cam'ron (credited as Killa Cam on \"8 Iz Enuff\") and Jay-Z (on \"Da Graveyard\").\n\nIn a 2010 interview with HipHopDX to commemorate the album's 15th anniversary and its re-issue by Traffic Entertainment, Lord Finesse discussed the making of the album.\n\nConcerning \"Put It On\", he stated: \n\n[Columbia Records] wanted something with a hook that would be kinda catchy, and something they could get radio play with. Like, everything [L] did was dark, and it was gangsta, and it was . . . what was the [popular style at the time]? Horror-core. So they needed something bright, something friendly. And \"Put It On\" just matched everything perfect.\"\nConcerning \"M.V.P.\", he stated:\n\nThat song came about because L wanted a commercial, R&B loop that everybody could recognize. And me remembering that [DeBarge] record, and also remembering how Kid Capri used it way back when he did – I forgot which record he did, but he had that [song], and I’m like, \"Damn, well maybe we could reinvent that right there.\" And L heard the loop and was like, \"Yeah, that’s it!\" But, [with] Diggin’, we had to have the right drums, the right everything [to go with a sample], and we dressed it up in a way where we tried to keep it Hip Hop.\nConcerning \"8 Iz Enuff\", he said:\n\nWith that [song] L just thought he had to do a track with the rappers from his hood. And he definitely wanted to put on [those particular emcees]… We looking like, \"How you gonna put eight niggas on one track?\" [And he was like], \"Don’t worry, I got this.\"\n\nSpeaking about \"Danger Zone\", he said:\n\nAt the time it was somebody by the name of David Kahne [working as L’s A&R at Columbia]. He was like the person who was responsible for getting L signed, and he loved all that devil’s son shit. [Says in nasally white-guy voice] \"Oh wow, this is great!\" It’s like, \"Are you serious?\" Because we had to make [L] change a line in \"Devil’s Son\" because it was [like], \"You’re too out-of-order.\" What was the line . . . \"I’m killin’ chumps for the cheapest price / I’m rollin’ with Satan,\" [and instead of then saying \"not Jesus Christ\"] it was \"F Jesus Christ.\" But we made him change it to \"Not Jesus Christ.\" [We were] like, \"Yo, what the fuck are you doing?!\"\nCommenting on \"Street Struck\", he said:\n\nThat was Sony [that wanted him to make something more positive]. [They were like], \"You so dark on this album, we need something positive we can push. This album is too dark: you got \"All Black\", you got \"Danger Zone\", you done came out with \"Devil’s Son\". We really don’t wanna push that as your image. You have to do something that’s gonna balance it.\" And that’s [when] we started doing more conceptual, conscious songs like \"Fed Up Wit The Bullshit\", \"Street Struck\", and \"M.V.P.\" and \"Put It On.\"\n\"Lifestylez ov da Poor & Dangerous\" was released on March 28, 1995. Prior to the release, Big L, under Columbia, released a promotional cassette tape in 1994 consisting of four tracks that did not make it to the final album.\n\n\"Lifestylez ov da Poor & Dangerous\" released three singles, all of which peaked within the top 25 on \"Billboard\"'s Hot Rap Tracks and Hot Dance Singles Sales. The first single to release was \"Put It On.\" It peaked at number 12 on Hot Dance Singles Sales, 23 on Hot Rap Tracks, and 81 on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs. The second single to be released was \"M.V.P.\", which peaked at number 15 on Hot Rap Tracks, 25 on Hot Dance Singles Sales, and 56 on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs. The third and final single from the album was \"No Endz, No Skinz\", however, the song did not chart. In addition to the three singles, \"Street Struck\" was released as a promotional single, but did not chart as well.\n\n\"Lifestylez ov da Poor & Dangerous\" debuted at number 149 on the US \"Billboard\" 200 and number 22 on the US R&B/Hip-Hop Albums. The album would not peak any higher. It has sold over 200,000 copies since August 2000.\n\n\"Lifestylez ov da Poor & Dangerous\" received critical acclaim. \"The Source\" wrote that \"[Big L] comes with ill animated lyrics, combined with metaphors that stun; a combo sure to have suckas on the run\".\n\nM. F. DiBella of AllMusic complimented Big L as \"a master of the lyrical stickup undressing his competition with kinetic metaphors and a brash comedic repertoire,\" while noting: \"With better production and marketing, Big L might have found himself with a platinum album but instead he settled for platinum respect.\"\n\nSteve Juon of \"RapReviews\" called the album \"jam packed with treats\" and lamented that it \"faded quietly into obscurity, now better known after his death than it was while he was still alive\".\n\nA promotional cassette circulated in 1994 with a different track listing, including four songs that did not make the final retail album. A later promotional cassette also included an extra track that was removed from the final track listing.\nCredits for \"Lifestylez of da Poor & Dangerous\" adapted from Allmusic.\n"}

In 1868, she gave the university a set of chimes. The first tune played at any Cornell Chimes concert is the \"Cornell Changes\", also known as the \"Jennie McGraw Rag\". They continue to be played every day from McGraw Tower on the campus. She was also the founder of the Southworth Library in Dryden, New York. Upon her death, she left a significant bequest to Cornell University. Her will designated monies for a library, McGraw Hall, a student health center, and additional monies to be used as the university wished. She was married when she was 39 to professor and librarian Willard Fiske, but lived less than two years following the wedding ceremony.\n\nJennie McGraw was born September 14, 1840 in Dryden, New York to Rhoda Southworth and John McGraw a self-made industrialist and millionaire. She was born in a house near the Southworth estate of her maternal grandfather, John Southworth, who was a farmer and millionaire. Rhoda McGraw died of tuberculosis in 1847.\n\nBy the time she was 10 years old, John father moved them from Dryden. He married a second time to Nancy Amelia Southworth, Rhoda's sister, and the family lived in Westchester County, New York. Nancy died of tuberculosis, like her sister, in 1857. The McGraws moved to Ithaca in 1862 and John married a widow, Jane P. Turner Bates.\n\nMcGraw was educated at Canandaigua, New York and, at about 18 years of age, at Pelham Priory in New Rochelle in Westchester County. She studied standard subjects as well as French composition, Latin, \"social science\", singing, and music. She could dance and play the spinet. Jane McGraw co-founded the Ladies' Union Benevolent Society. Jennie helped run a home for women over the age of 65. One wing of McGraw House continues the mission to provide housing for women who cannot afford to provide their own house.\n\nWhen she was 22, McGraw made her debut into Ithaca's society. She was sent on her first Grand Tour of Europe in 1859 by her father, who desired that she receive a classical education. She went on two other major trips to Europe.\n\nShe gave Cornell its set of chimes which have been rung daily since the University's opening ceremony on October 7, 1868. They were first installed in a temporary wooden structure and later in the McGraw Tower. Every morning concert includes a playing of the \"Jennie McGraw Rag\", also known as \"Cornell Changes\".\n\nHer father discouraged suitors. Willard Fiske met Jennie in 1869 and secretly wrote love poems about her. John McGraw died on May 4, 1877. The \"History of Dryden\" states that her step-mother received $2 million from his will, while the \"History of Cornell University\" and \"Ithaca Times\" state that McGraw inherited most of her father's estate. McGraw inherited a trust of $500,000.\n\nWhen her grandfather Southworth died, she also inherited the money that would have otherwise have gone to her mother. She hired architect William Henry Miller to build a mansion in 1878. Two years later, construction began on what had been Cornell University land between Fall River and University Avenue in Ithaca. The house had Gothic architectural details like bartizans, turrets, and donjon keeps.\nLike her father, who did not have the benefit of a good education, McGraw believed in the importance of the creating a \"world-class university library\". She was the founder of the Southworth Library in Dryden. It opened in an existing building in 1884 and in a building constructed for the library in 1894.\nShe took her last trip to Europe in 1878, in the hopes that the more temperate climate there would help her recuperate from tuberculosis; since she was a young girl, McGraw had \"weak lungs\". During her trip, she purchased art and furniture for the new mansion, but her health deteriorated significantly during her travels. She met up with a friend, Willard Fiske, in Venice, whom she married in Berlin in August 1880 or on July 14, 1880. Fiske was a professor of north European languages and a librarian. He had been in love with her for some time, but was reticent to express his feelings for fear of being considered a fortune hunter. Before the wedding ceremony, Fiske signed away any rights to her property. After they were married, the couple traveled up the Nile in November 1880 and McGraw became seriously ill. They went to France in June 1881, where she was told that she only had only a few weeks to live.\nThe Fiskes returned to the United States in early September. Quite ill, she was taken to Fiske's house, but was driven by her mansion and she was pleased to see how it had been completed. She died on September 30, 1881 and was interred in the Memorial Antechapel of the Sage Chapel at Cornell University. At her death, she had $2 million in property and $250,000 remaining in her trust.\n\nTen years after her death, Willard Fisk sold the mansion and had the furniture and household furnishings auctioned. The house was later purchased by Edward and Clarence Wyckoff for the Chi Psi fraternity. It was destroyed in 1906 during a fire that also took the lives of seven people.\n\nIn her will, she gave away $300,000 ($ in today dollars) to her husband, $550,000 to her brother Joseph and his children, $200,000 to Cornell for a library, $50,000 for construction of McGraw Hall, $40,000 for a student hospital, and the remainder of her property to the University, estimated at at least $1 million, for whatever use it saw fit.\nThe University's charter limited its property holdings to $3 million, but a New York State law on May 12, 1882 changed the Cornell University Charter removing the limit. Another state law disallowed more than one half of a woman's estate go to charity if she was married when she died. Fiske became quite angry when he learned of the law and that it had not been mentioned to him by the executor of the state. Fiske launched a legal assault to reacquire the money that the university could not accept, known as The Great Will Case. The case went to the Supreme Court of the United States. Once the case was settled, Fiske received about a $500,000, the McGraws received about $1 million, and the university had the rest of the estate. When he died in 1904, Fiske left most of his estate, including his personal library, to the university.\n\nToday, McGraw's name graces numerous places and things on Cornell's campus. The central tower in McGraw Hall was constructed in order to house the chimes donated by McGraw; they now reside in McGraw Tower next to Uris Library\n\n"}

On the basis of Zosimos's comments, she lived between the first and third centuries French, Taylor and Lippmann list her as one of the first alchemical writers, dating her works at no later than the first century.\n\nShe is credited with the invention of several kinds of chemical apparatus and is considered to be the first true alchemist of the Western world.\n\nThe primary source for the existence of \"Mary the Jewess\" within the context of alchemy is Zosimos of Panopolis, who wrote, in the 4th century, the oldest extant books on alchemy. Zosimos described several of Mary's experiments and instruments. In his writings, Mary is almost always mentioned as having lived in the past, and she is described as \"one of the sages\".\n\nGeorge Syncellus, a Byzantine chronicler of the 8th century, presented Mary as a teacher of Democritus, whom she had met in Memphis, Egypt, during the time of Pericles.\n\nThe 10th century \"Kitāb al-Fihrist\" of Ibn al-Nadim cited Mary as one of the 52 most famous alchemists and stated that she was able to prepare \"caput mortuum\", a purple pigment.\n\nThe early medieval alchemical text ascribed to an otherwise unknown \"Morienus Romanus\" called her \"Mary the Prophetess\", and the Arabs knew her as the \"Daughter of Plato\" – a name which, in Western alchemical texts, was reserved for white sulfur.\n\nAlthough none of Mary's writings have survived, some quotations credited to her are found in hermetic writings. The most notable of these are found in \"The Dialogue of Mary and Aros on the Magistery of Hermes,\" which is an extract made by an anonymous Christian philosopher. Operations are described in this document which would later become the basis of alchemy, such as \"leukosis\" (whitening) and \"xanthosis\" (yellowing). The document describes, for the first time, an acid salt and other acids. There are also several recipes for making gold from plants (mandragora, for example).\n\nSeveral cryptic alchemical precepts have been attributed to Mary. She is said to have spoken of the union of opposites:\n\nThe following was known as the Axiom of Maria:\n\nMarie-Louise von Franz, an associate of psychologist Carl Jung, gives an alternative version:\n\nCarl Jung used this axiom as a metaphor for wholeness and individuation.\n\nMary is said to have discovered hydrochloric acid, though this is not accepted by most science texts.\n\nMary, along with Agathodaemon, Pseudo-Democritus, and Hermes Trismegistus, was mentioned by Zosimos of Panopolis in his descriptions of certain devices, such as the \"tribikos\", the \"kerotakis\", and the bain-marie. But her contributions are disputed and not clear.\n\nThe \"tribikos\" () was a kind of alembic with three arms that was used to obtain substances purified by distillation. It is not known whether Mary invented it, but Zosimos credits the first description of the instrument to her. It is still used today in alchemy and chemistry labs. In her writings (quoted by Zosimos), she recommends that the copper or bronze used to make the tubes should be the thickness of a frying pan and that the joints between the tubes and the still-head should be sealed with flour paste.\n\nThe \"kerotakis\" ( or κυροτακίς), is a device used to heat substances used in alchemy and to collect vapors. It is an airtight container with a sheet of copper upon its upper side. When working properly, all its joints form a tight vacuum. The use of such sealed containers in the hermetic arts led to the term \"hermetically sealed\". The \"kerotakis\" was said to be a replication of the process of the formation of gold that was occurring in the bowels of the earth.\n\nThis instrument was later modified by the German chemist Franz von Soxhlet in 1879 to create the extractor that bears his name, the Soxhlet extractor.\n\nMary's name survives in her invention of the \"bain-marie\" (Mary's bath), which limits the maximum temperature of a container and its contents to the boiling point of a separate liquid: essentially a double boiler. It is extensively used in chemical processes for which a gentle heat is necessary. This term was introduced by Arnold of Villanova in the 14th century. The bain-marie is also used for cooking food.\n\n\n\n"}

For a time, he was uncertain how many books there would be in the end but plans on seven. , four books have been completed. , a fifth and sixth were in the works, 24 years after the publication of the fourth book.\n\nAfter mysterious and deadly viruses decimate the world's population, strange and violent alien creatures, dubbed the Chtorr, start to appear. Jim McCarthy is a military scientist tasked with clearing a nest of worms, one of the more well known types of Chtorr. He notices that they have a level of intelligence and brings back three eggs for further analysis. Back at base, he learns that political squabbling is getting in the way of making any real progress on understanding the invasion. He is soon recruited to a mysterious group known only as \"Uncle Ira\" who dedicate themselves to clearing out the Chtorr at any cost. In a presentation demonstrating a live Chtorran worm to a visiting group of dignitaries, the worm breaks loose and kills several people before it's stopped by McCarthy. He quickly realizes that the massacre, and his death, were planned by Uncle Ira as a way of getting the international community to wake up to the Chtorran problem. Along the way, Jim's best friend and sometimes lover, Ted, decides to join the Telepathy Corps, and to Jim's chagrin, seems to be losing himself to a larger hive mind.\n\nOn a mission in deep Chtorran territory, Jim McCarthy and his crew crash their helicopter in a blizzard of strange pink fuzz. The crew takes this opportunity to observe previously unknown aspects of the Chtorran life cycles and ecology. Particularly interesting is an odd ritual observed between bunnymen and worms where they seem to play together in harmony. Upon return to San Francisco, McCarthy spends some time studying the zombie phenomena that surfaced soon after the invasion; massive groups of people seem to lose all but the most basic animal intelligence and wander aimlessly in herds, occasionally luring in others who get too close. Seeing a similarity between the zombies and the bunnyman/worm rituals, McCarthy briefly allows himself to join the zombie herd in order to study them, and only barely manages to be rescued and restored to his former self. Using what he learned, he leads a team near a nest of worms and attempts communication like the bunnymen. Although the experiment seems to work initially, the worms turn violent and attack the humans and other Chtorr.\n\nThe third book in the series alternates between two stories, Jim McCarthy experiences Mode Training and flashbacks to his time in a cult. On a routine mission, McCarthy's platoon is overwhelmed by a group of renegade humans. He is taken prisoner and slowly brainwashed into the lifestyle of the cult and their leader, Jason Delandro. The cult believes in serving the Chtorr and have several worms on their campgrounds, although only a few high-up members are allowed to know the worms' secrets. The cult also practices a type of hedonism, characterized by free love including pedophilia. On an expedition, Jim discovers a military base with a working radio. Snapping back to his senses, he calls in the renegades' location, then wanders aimlessly in the wilderness while fighting an emotional internal battle over having betrayed the renegades. Jim heads to a peninsula on the California coast where his mother used to live, called Family, and adopts three orphans. When Family's leaders ignore his demands for anti-Chtorran defenses, a group of worms break into the grounds and slaughter many of the Family, including his adopted children. Jim realizes that the worms were led by Delandro and manages to capture and execute him. Jim flees Family and after a hallucinatory experience brought on by the Chtorran ecology, he is picked up in a helicopter by Colonel Elizabeth 'Lizard' Tirelli. Jim is sent to Mode Training to learn to overcome basic human psychology. As a final test in the training, the group is forced to accept the death of one of their own, Jim, by the hand of the leader Daniel Foreman. The gun Foreman was using turns out to be loaded with blanks, and as the group accepted his death, they pass the course. Tirelli and McCarthy had previously been romantically involved, and they expand that relationship after Tirelli leads McCarthy to testify in a meeting with the President of the United States regarding the need to drop a nuclear bomb on the heavy Chtorran infestations in the Rockies, arguing that the people who live there are no longer human.\n\nLeading a patrol, Jim McCarthy is annoyed by a senior officer from Montreal who insisted on coming along but does not understand the gravity of the situation. In order to get him out of the way, McCarthy tricks him into thinking that the two of them had walked into the sensory network of a live shambler grove (a type of mobile Chtorran plant) and were likely to be eaten alive by the grove's residents. In reality, the grove looked dead, but the officer did not know this and agreed on record to cede all authority to McCarthy. While examining the grove, the scientists discover a massive womb-like structure beneath it that they theorize is the place where all the Chtorran life forms were formed when they fell to Earth. After being reprimanded by his commanding officer, McCarthy is sent on a mission to an area of the Amazon rainforest with some of the heaviest infestations anywhere. The mission commandeers a massive dirigible originally built as a pleasure craft before the invasion. Aboard the ship, McCarthy and Tirelli finally marry. When trying to figure out a way of communication with the worms via flashing lights, the team accidentally sets off a Chtorran war where the worms battle each other in a massive slaughter. On the way home the flight crew realize too late that Chtorran stingbugs have created too many holes in the helium chambers, causing a massive loss of lift gases. Quickly dumping cargo, the ship heads back to civilization as fast as possible but crashes when still several miles in Chtorran territory. Fearing that Liz is dead, Jim hears her voice on a radio briefly. To rescue her he contacts a government official, a woman with Down syndrome and brain implants who McCarthy correctly surmises is an unwitting member of the Telepathy Corps, and utilizes their communications network to request a search for Tirelli. Although Liz is eventually found, the book ends with everyone still awaiting rescue.\n\nIn June 2015, the fifth book (called \"A Method for Madness\" at that time) was reportedly slated for release September 2015 but according to the author, at the end of August 2015 only the first draft was finished and given to beta readers.\n\nOn March 14, 2017, Gerrold announced that the fifth book would be titled \"A Nest for Nightmares\", and \"A Method for Madness\" would be the sixth book, with both books nearing completion.\n\nOn March 14, 2017, Gerrold announced \"A Method for Madness\" would be the sixth book.\n\nSet in a devastated early 21st century United States with logical expected advances in current technology such as a fledgling moon base, this series of science-fiction novels describe the invasion of Earth by an alien ecology. The story is unusual in that the tactics used by the aliens eschew the usual direct attack in favor of terraforming the ecosystem.\n\nThe United States has suffered serious political and social upheavals. These have come from unintended consequences of US government choices regarding geopolitical crises and interventionism. In the timeline of the books, there had been another US/Eastern Bloc proxy war -- between the State of Israel and certain other Middle Eastern nations -- in the recent past. This had been similar to a larger, higher-technology version of the 1967 Arab-Israeli conflict, the 1973 Arab–Israeli War, and others. The books do not explain the detailed conduct of the fictional new war, neither do they state which countries fought Israel.\n\nIn the summer of 1997, Israel had deployed a nuclear weapon — and the world's perception was that Israel had done so at the instructions of the United States. In a case rather like a reversal of the Cuban Missile Crisis, America had been placed under an explicit nuclear ultimatum from the Soviet Union. Modern printings of the books, however, state that the ultimatum came from Russia.\n\nThe unnamed President of the United States had refused to accept that a nuclear World War III was inevitable, so he had decided to travel to Moscow, where in the year 2000 “the Millennium Treaties” had been signed. The United States had been substantially hobbled by the Millennium Treaties. Years later there had been subsequent treaties after the United States entered a bitter war in Pakistan. The US failed in its objectives there, and it was given another nuclear ultimatum. The second ultimatum came from the People's Republic of China. As a result, the United States was required to greatly weaken its armed forces, to comply with new bans on certain weapon systems, to make official statements of culpability for warmongering, and to undertake new programs of civic education for the young that were supposed to establish precautions against the possibility of Americans making choices to start future wars. Also, the United States was made to pay heavy reparations to the international community. America's network of allies continues to realign and break apart. Other countries continue to become more hostile, even though it is not always in a military sense of hostility.\n\nU.S. leaders respond by stimulating the domestic economy with large investments in new technologies. Secondly, the U.S. manages to surreptitiously re-structure the reparations required under the Millennium Treaties. The new US national security strategy is subtle, and has a focus on making other countries more reliant on the United States. This was done through applying economic diplomacy, sharp power, soft power, and other measures to increase foreign dependency on a variety of assets and systems controlled or heavily influenced by America. These include America's new generations of advanced robotic systems, American space-based solar power technologies, American food exports, American space transportation systems such as spaceplanes, and newly expanded efforts by agencies such as the Peace Corps and USAID.\n\nIn great secrecy, the American government continues work on advanced military technologies, dual-use technologies, and finding means to leverage the revolution in military affairs to gain advantage in this radically new geopolitical situation. The books give attention to such things as high-energy microwave weapons, cyberwarfare, military teleoperation, and intelligent agents that can be militarized. All these efforts are forbidden under the Millennium Treaties.\n\nSoon afterwards, a lengthy onslaught of devastating plagues sweeps the world, killing 60% of humanity. As the survivors struggle to rebuild civilization, they gradually discover that hundreds of alien plant and animal species have mysteriously begun to entrench themselves. All these strange species are far more opportunistic and aggressive than the native organisms occupying the same ecological niches. As a result, Earth's entire ecology is being rapidly supplanted (or \"chtorraformed\"). The invaders are called Chtorrans after the sound made by the most deadly predator encountered so far.\n\nThere are no signs of sentient aliens, but humans presume the invasion to be deliberate, either \"seeded\" from space or brought by undetected spacecraft. Many of the Chtorran organisms (see below) exhibit behaviors that are quasi-sentient (building structures, creating and using tools, farming/herding, setting traps, singing), yet the central question of whether they are doing so out of sentience or collective and programmed behavior is as yet unanswered. With each new layer of organisms, a bit more hierarchy to the Chtorran \"societal\" structure is revealed, allowing the possibility that all these organisms will transform the Earth in support of some worse, higher form of Chtorran life. The presumed goal of these off-stage aliens appears to be the complete replacement of Earth's ecology -- such that most macroscopic native organisms would be wiped out, a tiny percentage of native organisms would be altered or reconditioned to be placed under husbandry, and the aliens would presumably be able claim Earth without a single shot. Another possibility is that collectively the Chtorr \"are\" the aliens. The ecological invasion has gained enormous footholds, and humanity has yet to figure out who the true enemy is; let alone how to fight back successfully).\n\nThe books largely follow the adventures of Jim McCarthy, a scientist and soldier in the U.S. Army, who attempts to understand the Chtorran ecology even as he engages in combat to destroy it. His early efforts primarily focus on the \"Worms\", a particularly large and dangerous apex predator Chtorran species whose prey consists largely of human beings. McCarthy and other scientists investigate the rapidly expanding webs of Chtorran ecosystems and attempt to unravel the relationships between the species.\n\nIn addition to descriptions of alien ecology, the Chtorr series includes lengthy expositions on various aspects of human psychology, particularly under wartime and survival conditions.\n\n\n\nChtorran ecology was designed in large part by British reproductive biologist Jack Cohen. It is quite complete and consistent, making it hard science fiction.\n\nIf there are two things that all Chtorran life forms have in common, it is that they are hungry, and that they change. Virtually all Chtorran life forms engage in some form of symbiosis, which can be recursive. Indeed, by later books scientists began to suspect that the \"Chtorran biosphere\" isn't so much a collection of different species as it is one vast hive-like superorganism, with each species not only fulfilling a niche but laying the groundwork for other more complex forms. Several species of prey animals are in fact suspected to be the juvenile versions of larger predator animals — the few who survive to adulthood metamorphosize and feed on their younger cousins. \n\nWhat little can be guessed about the Chtorran homeworld is that it must have slightly higher gravity than Earth, and its atmosphere somewhat lower oxygen content—explaining the strength of Chtorran musculature and how efficiently they process oxygen on Earth. Their planet is also suspected to be located near an older red giant star, resulting in most Chtorran creatures possessing a warm color scheme of pink to red (though this varies). Chtorran organisms use DNA as genetic material: theoretical xenobiologists explain that DNA was already predicted to be the universal basis for alien biospheres, due to its inherent chemical stability. Chtorran DNA even auto-sorts into chromosomes on a basic level, however, its inter-relations are vastly more complex than comparable Terran genetics. Chtorran molecular biology is thus compatible with Earth's, with right-handed DNA and left-handed proteins - if it wasn't, the infestation would have starved to death as soon as it began, unable to digest Terran organisms.\n\nChtorran life forms (at least those encountered so far) seem to thrive best in semi-tropical climate zones, though they are also quite successful in tropical and temperate zones. It is speculated that they may prefer warmer climates, and have only adapted so well to the temperate zones because there are generally more humans to eat there. Whatever the case, six years into the invasion there is not a single region of the planet that does not have at least some small trace of Chtorran life forms in it, even micro-organisms. \n\nGenerally, Chtorran life has been slower to spread to desert or polar regions — again, possibly because there is simply less bio-mass to consume in them. Due to its desert climate, Australia is cited as the only inhabited continent in which the infestation has been relatively light (and it is also light in frozen Antarctica). Europe has been only moderately infested, for reasons not entirely clear (possibly because the initial plagues devastated its highly concentrated population centers so badly that Chtorrans there did not have a surplus of humans to eat). Most world militaries were wiped out in the plagues, because governments deployed their soldiers as riot police, allowing them to become infected as well. The only exception was the United States: due to losing a war in the Middle East, international pressure forced it to disarm most of its standing army, the result being that they survived the plagues and were able to be re-mobilized soon afterwards. Thus North America is also one of the few regions that has been able to put up resistance to Chtorran encroachment. Even then, much of the West Coast has been lost, due to Chtorrans breeding unnoticed in the wilderness of the Rocky Mountains until their numbers were overwhelming. The worst infected zones in the United States are in the Rocky Mountains, and in the semi-tropics of the southeastern states (Mississippi through Florida): limited nuclear strikes in these states only temporarily culled the infestation, which grew back to prior levels within a matter of months.\n\nOtherwise, vast swaths of South America, Africa, and Asia have been totally overrun. Asia in particular was hard hit by the plagues - with the exception of Japan, which due to its isolated island geography was able to survive relatively intact. Some of the absolute worst and largest Chtorran infestations are in the western United States, India, and the Amazon basin of Brazil — areas which increasingly resemble an alien planet.\n\n\nSome Chtorran life-forms are similar to plants or fungi, but many are carnivorous plants, or mobile animal-plant hybrids which defy easy categorization.\n\n\nThere are two distinctly different editions of the first two books in this series. The first edition was released in 1983 by Timescape Books. This edition was edited by the publisher and removed several items which they objected to. All of the chapter introductions (the \"Solomon Short\" quotations) and several pages of homosexual content were removed. The same thing was done to the 1984 release of \"A Day for Damnation\".\n\nIn 1989, David Gerrold made a new publishing contract with Bantam Books. This time, both \"A Matter for Men\" and \"A Day for Damnation\" were released with all redacted content restored.\n\nMany characters and ideas from other works by David Gerrold have made appearances in this series. Amongst them are H.A.R.L.I.E. (from the book \"When HARLIE Was One\"), tribbles (from \"Star Trek\", disguised as Meeps), and the Space Elevator (from the book \"Bouncing Off the Moon\").\n\nThe reverse is also true—there are references to the series in other Gerrold novels. In \"Bouncing Off the Moon\", there is a mention of a woman in Oregon claiming that a giant worm ate her horse, along with numerous passages about plagues spreading across the Earth, also suggesting that the two stories take place in the same story universe. References to the series also appear in the \"Star Wolf\" novels, such as Chtorrans proper and a self-help guru named Daniel Jeffrey Foreman, suggesting the two series exist in the same universe. In Gerrold's 1977 novel \"Moonstar Odyssey\", there is a reference to \"Chtorr-plants\" \"...named for the legendary place of child-eating demons from which they were supposed to have come\" and having an alternate form of photosynthesis. Reference to the Chtorr or Chtorr-like species and situations also pop-up in Gerrold's 1993 book \"Under the Eye of God\" and its 1994 sequel \"A Covenant of Justice\". In his \"Star Trek\" novel, \"The Galactic Whirlpool,\" Gerrold quotes the \"Terran philosopher, Solomon Short\" as saying, \"This neurotic pursuit of sanity is driving us all crazy.\"\n\nFor \"Season for Slaughter\", Gerrold named several characters after actual people, who donated handsomely to Gerrold's favorite charities for the privilege (\"tuckerization\"). Gerrold had not thought to repeat the effort, but as work on \"Method for Madness\" progressed, he received so many fan inquiries about \"buying a character\" that he decided to do it again. Prior to that, In \"A Rage For Revenge\", Gerrold included several characters, particularly children who were fated to be eaten by worms, named after friends he had made when attending his first UK Star Trek conventions.\n\n"}

A Democrat, he served in the United States House of Representatives for eight terms, from 1965 to 1971 and from 1975 to 1985.\n\nRichard Lawrence Ottinger was born in New York City, the son of businessman Lawrence Ottinger, founder of U.S. Plywood, and nephew of Albert Ottinger, the Republican Attorney General of New York from 1925 to 1928. He attended the public schools of Scarsdale, New York and graduated from the Loomis School, in Windsor, Connecticut in 1946. He received a bachelor of arts degree from Cornell University in 1950 and graduated from Harvard Law School in 1953. He also studied international law at Georgetown University. He served in the United States Air Force from 1955 to 1957, and was discharged as a captain. He was admitted to the New York bar and practiced international and corporate law. He was one of the founders and the second staff member of the Peace Corps, serving as director of programs for the west coast of South America from 1961 to 1964.\n\nIn the 1964 elections, he was elected as a Democrat to the 89th United States Congress and was re-elected twice in 1966 and 1968. After the 1964 run, Ottinger was criticized for using a loophole in election laws to spend $193,000 of his own money to get around a limit of $8,000 in the race. He set up multiple committees and gave money of all of them. Most prominently, Ottinger's mother, Louise, and sister, Patricia Heath, had set up 22 different committees that in turn donated $6,000 apiece to his campaign.\n\nIn the 1970 elections, he gave up his House seat to run on the Democratic ticket for United States Senator from New York. In the 1970 election, Ottinger split the liberal vote with the Republican (and Liberal-endorsed) nominee, incumbent Senator Charles Goodell (who was appointed by Governor Nelson Rockefeller after the assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy), and both were defeated by the Conservative nominee, James L. Buckley in a three-way race.\n\nIn 1972, he sought to return to his old congressional seat, but lost in a hotly contested election to the Republican incumbent Representative Peter A. Peyser. His comeback effort was successful in 1974, when he was elected to the House from a different district. He was re-elected to the four succeeding Congresses (in 1976, 1978, 1980, and 1982), retiring in 1985.\n\nAfter retiring from Congress, Ottinger became a professor at the Elisabeth Haub School of Law, founding an environmental law program there, and served as the law school dean from 1994 to 1999. He currently serves as Dean Emeritus.\n\n\n"}

It contains the provincial capital of Winnipeg and its surrounding rural municipalities, cities, and towns.\n\nIn the late 1990s issues such as providing Shoal Lake water and to nearby municipalities and allowing exurban housing growth beyond Winnipeg became more important. At the time Mayor Susan Thompson voiced the idea of a regional planning authority to mediate such issues.\n\nIn June 1998 former Great West Life President Kevin Kavannagh was appointed by Premier Filmon to Chair the \"Capital Region Review Committee\". The panel looked at land use planning and economic development. Mayor Susan Thompson and the Mayors and Reeves of 14 adjacent municipalities began to meet on a regular basis starting in October 1998.\n\nHowever, there was a change of government in September 1999 which made creating a regional planning authority take longer than originally foreseen.\n\nIt was created to co-ordinate land use policy and economic development between the City of Winnipeg and the surrounding municipalities. It is the most densely populated and economically important area of Manitoba.\n\nOther communities with over 1,000 population in the region besides Winnipeg are the city of Selkirk and towns of Oakbank, Oak Bluff, Stonewall, Stony Mountain, Teulon, Lorette and Niverville.\n\nAn pro-economic growth planning document was released in November 2018 as \"Securing Our Future: An Action Plan for Winnipeg's Metropolitan Region\".\n\nIn October 2019, Dentons released a speech and discussion document, \"For the Benefit of All: Regional Competitiveness and Collaboration in the Winnipeg Metro Region\", which seeks to reform regional planning. Upon publication, Premier Pallister and Mayor Bowman spoke in favour of creating a new entity to manage development and transportation in the Winnipeg Metro Region.\n\nThe Capital Region was originally defined in \"The Capital Region Partnership Act\" (2006) to include 16 municipalities. Since that time the Town of Niverville and the Village of Dunnottar have been incorporated into the Winnipeg Metropolitan Region. The Region comprises the following cities, towns and RMs:\n\nThe population of the Winnipeg Metro Region is greatly concentrated within the city of Winnipeg itself, which has 86.5% of the Region's population residing in less than 6% of its land area. On the provincial level, the city has 54.9% of the province's population, while the Region's share is 63.5%.\n\nHowever, there are some municipalities that are geographically entirely or largely within its territory that are not officially part of the Metro Region. These include the town of Teulon, the village of Garson, and the Indian reserve of Brokenhead Ojibway Nation.\n\nThe Winnipeg Metro Region includes the smaller Winnipeg census metropolitan area (CMA) with the exception of Brokenhead Ojibway Nation.

Owned by the Lehigh Valley Public Telecommunications Corporation, it is a sister station to Allentown-licensed fellow PBS member WLVT-TV (channel 39). As WYBE, the station's transmitter was located in the Roxborough section of Philadelphia; in 2018, it entered into a channel sharing agreement with Allentown-based independent station WFMZ-TV (channel 69) and began operating from WFMZ's transmitter on South Mountain near Allentown.\n\nWYBE's main channel was previously carried in the New York City television market on the 66.4 digital subchannel of West Milford, New Jersey-licensed MHz WorldView affiliate WNYJ-TV.\n\nThe UHF channel 35 allocation in Philadelphia was first used by WHYY-TV in 1957. However, it was obvious by then that a UHF station was not nearly enough to serve a market that stretched from the Lehigh Valley to the north to the Jersey Shore in the south. In 1963, WHYY moved its call letters and programming to VHF channel 12, licensed to nearby Wilmington, Delaware. Metropolitan Philadelphia Educational Radio and Television, owner of WHYY, continued to operate channel 35 as WUHY-TV, using it mostly to air instructional programming on weekdays (outside of designated legal and administrative holidays) during the school year. WUHY-TV was the first station in the world to broadcast \"Sesame Street\" during a week of test broadcasts in July 1969. A slightly-retooled version of the show made its national premiere on National Educational Television (NET) four months later in November 1969.\n\nBy 1975, WHYY had stopped operating the UHF station, and eventually returned its license to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). In the 1980s, the channel 35 frequency was used by W35AB, a translator relaying Univision programming from New York City's WXTV, while the FCC evaluated applications for a new permanent licensee. The translator ultimately moved to channel 28 and evolved into WFPA-CD, the Philadelphia outlet for Univision sister network UniMás, following Univision's acquisition of full-power station WUVP.\n\nWYBE, the new permanent licensee on channel 35, began broadcasting on June 1, 1990, under the ownership of Independence Public Media of Philadelphia, Inc. (also known as Independence Media).\n\nFrom 1998 to 2004, the organization was led by Sherri Hope Culver, formerly of the New Jersey Network (NJN). During this period, WYBE moved into a new facility; began operating a digital signal, and focused on original productions, such as \"Culture Trek\" (a series of three specials, followed U.S. teenagers as they pursued projects with local teens in Costa Rica, Ireland and Jamaica), \"The Neighbors Project\" and \"The Tolerance Project\" (which addressed race, sexual orientation and religion). The station also featured a nightly talk show, \"Philly Live\", which was later restructured into five different talk shows: \"Gente\" (aimed at Hispanic audiences), \"Shades of Opinion\" (focusing on issues relevant to African-American community), \"Asian Outlook\", \"Global Lens\" and \"Out Loud\" (focusing on LGBT issues). Most of WYBE's programs in this period were syndicated shows distributed by American Public Television and NETA; the weeknightly news discussion program \"Democracy Now!\" was also part of the program schedule. Several of these programs won national Telly Awards, Emmy nominations and a special screening at the Philadelphia International Gay & Lesbian Film Festival. The WYBE World Heritage Council Initiative supports Philadelphia's diverse ethnic communities, funded by the William Penn Foundation.\n\nSince 2005, WYBE was led by Howard Blumenthal, who also served simultaneously as executive director of the New Jersey Network from 2009 to 2010.\n\nOn May 15, 2008, the station was rebranded as \"\", which emphasized its schedule on short-form programs, often with a \"public media for the public good\" perspective. MiND became the first broadcast television station in the U.S. whose program stream was simultaneously available online and on broadcast television worldwide, in a form of an internet simulcast of its broadcast signal, and a library of programs available on-demand. Some WYBE programs are also available on the MHz Worldview network, which is seen on selected television stations and cable systems, as well as on satellite and the internet.\n\nOn April 13, 2017, Independence Public Media of Philadelphia, Inc. announced that it gave up its broadcast license as WYBE (Channel 35), and would sign off the air on November 3, 2017. Independence Media, however, would continue to operate as a non-profit corporation.\n\nOn October 27, 2017, it was announced that WYBE would continue MiND 35.1, despite previous notices regarding termination of broadcast. Prior to its planned termination date, MiND TV went temporarily off air due to the equipment at the WYBE transmitter site having failed, according to the channel's website, but has since been restored on November 1, 2017.\n\nOn January 5, 2018, WYBE began channel-sharing with WBPH-TV, significantly reducing its over-the-air coverage in the Delaware Valley. MiND ended their short-form viewer-created programming format, transitioning their main channel to an affiliate of MHz Worldview, while 35.2 became an affiliate of World. The WYBE license was transferred to the Lehigh Valley Public Telecommunications Corporation, owner of WLVT-TV, on March 15, 2018; concurrently the call letters were changed to WPPT. After MHz Worldview discontinued operations on March 1, 2020, the station switched to a secondary lineup of PBS programming as \"PBS 39 Extra\", serving as a brand extension of WLVT.\n\nThe station's digital channel is multiplexed:\nWYBE shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 35, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 34 to channel 35 for post-transition operations.\n\nThe station's digital signal formerly operated at only 25% power until March 2010, when WYBE's power was increased fully to their FCC-authorized effective radiated power.\n\nWYBE broadcast a wide array of programming, such as those featuring independent filmmakers (such as \"Through the Lens\" and \"Philadelphia Stories\"); international programming from countries such as India, Japan, France, China, Greece, the United Kingdom, and Germany; programming aimed at the LGBT community (such as \"Gay USA\"); and public affairs and current events programming (such as \"Democracy Now\" and \"GRITtv\").\n\nWYBE was also first U.S. station to air the Australian drama \"Water Rats\", the Australian children's series \"The Shapies\" and the Irish drama \"Ros na Rún\".\n\n"}

The term originated with EMD F-units, as well as later E-unit models such as the E7, E8, and E9.\n\nIn 1951 the EMD F7 series was modified by General Motors' Australian licence holder Clyde Engineering to fit Australian loading gauge and axle load constraints. The A1A-A1A Clyde/EMD ML1 locomotive was introduced on the Commonwealth Railways as the GM class, as well as exported to Pakistan. It was further developed into the ML2 as a dual cab Co-Co locomotive, with a bulldog nose at each end, for Victorian Railways (VR) becoming that system's B class. A single-nose variant of the design, the EMD A7, with the revised EMD 567C series engine was introduced as the New South Wales Government Railways (NSWGR) 42 class, VR S class, and an upgraded GM class. The design continued to be developed with the dual-cab EMD AJ16C, introduced on NSWGR as the 421 class, although unlike the earlier ML2 the bulldog nose was only used on one end of these locomotives. 1970 saw the introduction of the last new locomotive design in the world to utilise the F-series bulldog nose, the EMD AT26C, introduced on the Commonwealth Railways as the CL class. A final Australian iteration of the bulldog nose in Australian locomotive practice was the rebuild of the 30-year-old Victorian ML2 units into the EMD AAT22C-2R, introduced as the V/Line A class.\n\nThere were also a number of European \"bulldog nose\" locomotive classes, all of which were built by NOHAB or AFB (with license from EMD), also frequently referred to as \"round noses\".

The fair generally begins two weeks after the Semana Santa, or Easter Holy Week. \n\nThe fair officially begins at midnight on Saturday, and runs seven days, ending on the following Saturday. Each day the fiesta begins with the parade of carriages and riders, at midday, carrying Seville's leading citizens which make their way to the bullring, La Real Maestranza, where the bullfighters and breeders meet.\n\nFor the duration of the fair, the fairgrounds and a vast area on the far bank of the Guadalquivir River are totally covered in rows of \"casetas\" (individual decorated marquee tents which are temporarily built on the fairground). These casetas usually belong to prominent families of Seville, groups of friends, clubs, trade associations and political parties. From around nine at night until six or seven the following morning, at first in the streets and later only within each caseta, there are crowds partying and dancing sevillanas, drinking Sherry, manzanilla or rebujito, and eating tapas. This fair also has an amusement park that comes with it and has many games to play along with roller coasters to ride.\n\nThe Fair dates back to 1846 when it was originally organized as a livestock fair by two councillors born in Northern Spain, Basque and Catalan Narciso Bonaplata. Queen Isabel II agreed to the proposal, and on 18 April 1847 the first fair was held at the Prado de San Sebastian, on the outskirts of the city.\n\nIt took only one year before an air of festivity began to transform the fair, due mainly to the emergence of the first three casetas, belonging to the Duke and Duchess of Montpensier, the Town Hall, and the Casino of Seville. During the 1920s, the fair reached its peak and became the spectacle that it is today.\n\nSince 1973, the \"Feria de Abril\" takes place at the Real de la Feria, an area of 24 blocks (450,000 m) which is located between Los Remedios and Tablada. In 2012 there were 1048 \"casetas\". The streets of the Real are named after famous bullfighters such as Juan Belmonte and Pascual Márquez. Next to the Real is the \"Calle del Infierno\" (Hell Road), an amusement park which offers many recreational activities; a circus is usually set furthest from the Real on the back of the Parque de los Príncipes. Construction of the \"portada\" (the main gate) starts months in advance, and it takes several weeks to clear the place after the end of the fair.\n\nPlans to relocate the Fair to the Charco de la Pava have existed for the past 20 years, but the local government is yet to present any plans to transform the Real. For years the Charco de la Pava has been used as the main parking lot for fair attendees.\n\n Saturday night in the \"Feria de Abril\" is referred to as \"la noche del pescaíto\" (night of the fish) due to the fact that fish is the traditional dish to have for dinner. Celebrations officially start at midnight between Saturday and Sunday when the lights of the \"portada\" are turned on. This event is called the \"alumbrao\". People gather in front of the \"portada\" to watch the \"alumbrao\" and then go to the casetas to have dinner and spend the whole night at the Real.\n\nThe 2020 Feria de Abril was scheduled from April 25th to May 2nd. However, on March 15th 2020 the fair was postponed to September due to the corona virus pandemic in Spain.\n\n"}

The song became a hit for Clooney, reaching the Top Ten in record charts in the US and France and No. 1 in the UK Singles Chart early in 1955. The song has shown enduring popularity, with several cover versions and appearances in numerous films.\n\nMerrill reportedly wrote it under a recording deadline, scribbling hastily on a paper napkin in an Italian restaurant in New York City, and then using the wall pay-phone to dictate the melody, rhythm and lyrics to the studio pianist, under the aegis of the conductor Mitch Miller, who produced the original record. Alongside Merrill, 'Lidianni' and 'Gabba' are also listed as writers of the song, corresponding to the pseudonyms of the Italian lyricists Gian Carlo Testoni and Gaspare Abbate, respectively. \n\nMerrill's song provides an obvious parody of genuine mambo music, cashing in on the 1954 mambo craze in New York, while at the same time allowing Miller to set up a brilliant vehicle for Clooney's vocal talents. It is also a late example of an American novelty song in a tradition started during World War II by the Italian-American jazz singer Louis Prima, in which nonsense lyrics with an Italian-American sound are used in such a way as to present a stereotyped caricature of Italian-American people (who had been classed with \"enemy alien\" status and discouraged from speaking Italian) as likable, slightly brash, pleasure-loving folk. Although Clooney's own family background was Irish-American, she could perform such \"Italianized\" material with an entirely convincing accent, which she had readily picked up from Italian-American musicians and their families.\n\nThe nonsense lyrics were originally couched in English, mixed together with a comic jumble of Italian, Spanish, Neapolitan dialect and gibberish (invented) words, including:\n\nThe song reached No. 8 on the U.S. \"Cash Box\" Top 50 Best Selling Records chart, in a tandem ranking of Don Cornell, Nick Noble, Kay Armen, and Roy Rogers & Dale Evans's versions, with Don Cornell and Nick Noble's versions marked as bestsellers. The song also reached No. 7 on \"Billboard\"s Honor Roll of Hits, with Don Cornell and Nick Noble's versions listed as best sellers.\n\nIn Australia, the song charted regionally. It entered the Brisbane charts in January 1956, and reached No. 3. In Sydney, it charted twice: in January, when it reached No. 10 (in a 10-song Hit Parade), and again in March 1956 when it went to No. 4.\n\nIt was successfully covered by the popular Italian-American star Dean Martin.\n\nIn 2006, the German Nu jazz and Lounge music act Club des Belugas (see ) officially released a remix of the Dean Martin version on their album \"Apricoo Soul\", with official authorization on behalf of Capitol Records/EMI and Martin's estate.\n\nMambo Italiano became popular in Italy when Carla Boni scored a major hit with her version of 1956. Also in 1956, Renato Carosone, a singer and band leader from Naples, recorded a successful version that weaves in several fragments of Neapolitan song, of which he was a leading exponent.\n\nCover versions of the song made in other languages include a French translation made by the Turkish polyglot singer Darío Moreno. Other covers in various genres from around the world include a salsa setting by the Italian musician Massimo Scalici; a V-pop version by the Vietnamese group Hồ Quang Hiếu; an instrumental by the Swedish electric guitarist Mattias Eklundh; a Latin ska number by Federico Fosati and Dinamo from Mallorca; and a version by the British electronica duo Shaft. Bette Midler remade \"Mambo italiano\" for her 2002 album \"Bette Midler Sings the Rosemary Clooney Songbook\". Patrizio Buanne realesed a cover on his album \"Patrizio (album)\" in 2009. Dean Martin's daughter, Deana Martin released a cover on her 2006 album \"Memories Are Made of This\". The \"Mambo italiano\" tune features at the start of Lady Gaga's 2011 song \"Americano\". Iggy Azalea samples the song on her 2019 single \"Lola\".\n\nIn the 1955 Italian comedy film \"Scandal in Sorrento\" (\"Pane, amore e...\"), Sophia Loren dances to an instrumental arrangement of the tune, opposite Vittorio de Sica in a simplified imitation of mambo dancing; she also dances to the song in the 1960 Hollywood comedy \"It Started in Naples\". The original Rosemary Clooney recording has become a prominent soundtrack item, serving as the opening theme for the 1988 film \"Married to the Mob\" and also being heard in the films \"Mermaids\" (1990), \"A Man of No Importance\" (1994), \"Big Night\" (1996), \"Mickey Blue Eyes\" (1999), and \"School for Seduction\" (2004).\n\n"}

Sage\n\nHenry Williams Sage (January 31, 1814 – September 18, 1897) was a wealthy New York State businessman, philanthropist, and early benefactor and trustee of Cornell University.\n\nSage was born in Middletown, Connecticut on January 31, 1814. He was the son of Charles and Sally (née Williams) Sage. He spent part of his early childhood in Bristol, Connecticut before moving to Ithaca, New York in 1827.\n\nTwo uncles, Timothy S. Williams and Josiah B. Williams, were New York State Senators from the Ithaca area.\n\nAfter briefly studying medicine at Ithaca under Dr. Austin Church, he began work for his uncles' forwarding firm, with a line of barges on the Erie Canal, which he took over by 1837. In 1847, he was elected to the New York State Assembly as a Whig.\n\nIn 1854, he purchased a tract of land at Bell Ewart on Lake Simcoe, 51 miles north of Toronto, Ontario, Canada and was soon processing timber on a large scale. From that point, the Ontario, Simcoe and Huron Union Railroad (see Northern Railway of Canada) carried the lumber to its wharves in Toronto, offering Sage a reduced rate for a specified number of carloads per month. The lumber was shipped across Lake Ontario to Sage's wholesale lumber yards at Albany, New York. He did not own the timber lands on Lake Simcoe, but rather purchased logs from farmers eager to clear their lands.\nMoving to Brooklyn in 1857, he became active in the Plymouth Congregational Church, where the Rev. Henry Ward Beecher (son of Lyman Beecher and brother of Harriet Beecher Stowe) was pastor. He would later endow the Lyman Beecher Lectureship on Preaching at Yale Divinity School.\n\nAbout this time he was also purchasing lumber in Michigan, as the Ontario supply began to wane. In 1863, he became a business partner with John McGraw. The two founded the town of Wenona, Michigan (named for the mother of Hiawatha and now part of Bay City) in 1864. The two earned a fortune in lumber and land in Wisconsin, Michigan, and New York.\n\nIn 1865, Sage purchased timber berths in Oakley township, Muskoka, necessary to keep the Bell Ewart mill running. The construction of a canal was required to run the logs from the Black River to Lake Couchiching. With previous experience on the New York State Assembly and legislation involving improvements to the Erie Canal, he attracted the interest of other Lake Simcoe lumbermen to form the Rama Timber Transport Company in 1868. The canal to divert the logs into Lake Couchiching opened in 1869, later that year Sage sold the Bell Ewart mill and associated timber berths to Messrs. Silliman and Beecher. Young Harry Beecher was a nephew of Sage's pastor, Rev. Henry Ward Beecher.\n\nHe funded construction of what is now the Sage Library of the Bay County Library System in 1884. It was designed by Cornell architecture professor Charles Babcock in the French Château-style, and is today a historical landmark.\n\nHenry Sage attended the inauguration of Cornell University on October 7, 1868. On this occasion Sage was introduced to Andrew Dickson White by their mutual friend John McGraw. As recounted by White in his \"Autobiography,\" Sage told White, \"I believe you are right in regard to admitting women ... when you are ready to move in the matter, let me know.\" Within a year, White had admitted Cornell's first female student, but since the University had only all-male dormitories, she was forced to rent a room in downtown Ithaca. This required a steep climb several times per day, which became treacherous in winter. White went to ask Sage for assistance, and Sage responded with an offer of $250,000 to build a women's college.\n\nIn 1870, Sage was elected to the Board of Trustees of Cornell University, and elected president of the Board in 1875. At his direction, the University resisted selling its Wisconsin land grants in the aftermath of the Panic of 1873, earning millions of dollars for the university's endowment.\n\nAn avowed supporter of equal access to higher education, he established Sage College for Women, Cornell's first residence for female students (today known as Sage Hall and home to the Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management). He also built Sage Chapel, the first non-denominational house of worship at a US university (and later endowed by his son Dean Sage); Sage House, now home to the Cornell University Press; the Sage Infirmary, now known as Schuyler House; and Stimson Hall, original home of the Cornell Medical College in Ithaca. He endowed the Susan Linn Sage School of Philosophy in the College of Arts and Sciences, named after his wife.\n\nSage's most notable contribution was the construction of the University Library (since 1962, Uris Library). Jennie McGraw, who had inherited his partner John's fortune in 1877, and died of tuberculosis shortly after marrying University Librarian Daniel Willard Fiske. She bequeathed $1 million to build a library, but Fiske sued to break the will, sparking what became known as The Great Will Case. The United States Supreme Court ruled in Fiske's favor in 1890.\n\nInfuriated by the decision, Sage donated funds for the construction of the Library himself, including a large plaque memorializing his indignation:\n\nCornell's graduate student fellowship, known as the SAGE fellowship, is being named in honor of Sage. The Sage Fellowship covers tuition and provide a stipend for living expenses.\n\nOn September 1, 1840, Sage was married to Susan Elizabeth Linn, the daughter of William Linn and granddaughter of Rev. William Linn who served as the first Chaplain of the United States House of Representatives in 1789. Together, they were the parents of:\n\n\nHis wife was killed in 1885 when she was thrown from her carriage in Ithaca. Sage died in Ithaca, New York on September 18, 1897.\n\nHis grandson Dean, named after the son, became president of Presbyterian Hospital in 1922, which affiliated with Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1924. Presbyterian merged with New York Hospital, affiliated with what is now the Weill Cornell Medical College, in 1996.\n\nAnother grandson, Henry M. Sage (1868–1933), was a New York State senator and owned an estate in Menands, New York.\n"}

It is a Grade I listed building.\n\nIt was one of several terraces and crescents around Regent's Park designed by the British architect John Nash (1752–1835), under the patronage of the Prince Regent (later George IV). The terrace was to stand opposite the Prince's proposed palace in the park and was therefore of particular importance in the scheme. It was named after the Prince Regent's uncle the Duke of Cumberland (King George III's younger brother), later King of Hanover.\n\nThe Terrace was built by William Mountford Nurse, with James Thomson serving as resident architect, and was completed in 1826. It consists of three main blocks, linked by decorative arches with typical neoclassical style and grandeur. The central block includes a large sculptural pediment by J. G. Bubb above a long colonnade of Ionic columns. Originally comprising 31 houses which were entirely reconstructed behind the original façade in the 1960s, some have been converted into flats but many houses are still separate family homes. The first resident, William Mountford Nurse himself, moved into the terrace in 1828; the building was not fully occupied until 1836.\n\nThe Terrace was used as a location for the filming of \"Doctor Who\" episode The Invasion in 1968.\n\n\n"}

During World War II, she escorted 116 convoys, spending 728 days at sea. She was awarded the \"Croix de la Libération\" and the \"Croix de Guerre\" 1939–1945, and was cited by the British Admiralty. Following the war she was used as whaling ship for three different companies from 1947 to 1964.\n\n\"Aconite\" was built by Ailsa Shipbuilding Company Ltd at Troon in Scotland, and was commissioned on 19 July 1941, under \"Lieutenant de vaisseau\" Levasseur. She was attached to the Free French Naval Forces (FNFL) on 23 July 1941, and assigned to the Clyde escort group on 17 August 1941, joining the Newfoundland Forces.\n\n\"Aconit\" took a very active part in the Battle of the Atlantic for two years, protecting convoys sailing from Newfoundland to the U.K. via Iceland. She also took part to the operations in Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon between 10 and 27 December 1941.\n\nIn 1942 \"Aconit\", with three other FNFL corvettes, was assigned to Escort Group B-3 of the Mid-Ocean Escort Force and served with this group for the rest of the campaign.\n\nOn 10 and 11 March 1943, \"Aconit\", one of eight warships escorting a large convoy HX228, destroyed two German submarines, (Oberleutnant zur See Albert Langfeld) and (Kapitänleutnant Hermann Eckhardt).\n\nOn Tuesday 9 March the convoy was five days out from Newfoundland. At 0800 a plane from a U.S. carrier sighted a U-boat ahead. At 1500, the carrier was short on fuel and had to turn back. At 1930, an ammunition ship had been hit and on a second ship SS \"Andrea F. Luckenbach\", men were taking to the boats.\n\n, a , under Commander Andre Tait DSO hunted \"U-444\" by sweeping through the lumbering convoy. A corvette was detailed to rescue survivors as the underwater search went on. Hours passed as the destroyer remained in the attack area. At midnight, astern of the convoy, silently moving up to regain station \"U-444\" was surfaced and going at top speed after the convoy. After the U-boat dived, \"Harvester\" raced over dive position and forced her to surface by depth charge attacks. Circling at speed \"Harvester\" searched and spotted the U-boat 500 yards ahead. Making revs for the destroyer rammed \"U-444\", disabling herself in the process. From astern \"Aconit\" sighted \"U-444\" as \"Harvester\" broke free and closed to make her own ramming attack.\n\n\"Harvester\", dead in the water, picked up one survivor and \"Aconit\" another four. Commander Tait ordered \"Aconit\" to rejoin convoy HX228 and with only the damaged starboard propeller shaft turning, \"Harvester\" limped behind at . At 0400 on 10 March, 50 survivors of SS \"William C. Gorgas\" (a Liberty ship sunk by \"U-757\") were sighted and rescued. During the morning of 11 March, \"Harvester\"'s remaining shaft broke. A signal was made to \"Aconit\" \"Am stopped. Stand by me\".\n\nAt 1100 \"Harvester\" was hit by the first torpedo from \"U-432\". As the officers and crew prepared to abandon ship in the middle of the intensely cold Atlantic, a second torpedo was fired. The captain, seven officers, 136 ratings and 39 survivors were lost. \"Aconit\" returned to the scene and forced \"U-432\" to surface, then sank her with artillery fire and ramming. During the day, the French corvette picked up 60 survivors from \"Harvester\", including 12 survivors from the \"William C. Gorgas\". \"Aconit\" also captured 12 survivors from \"U-432\", including the second officer.\n\nThe senior surviving officer of \"Harvester\", Lieutenant J L Briggs (who had been gunnery control officer) interviewed the second-in-command of \"U-432\", who had launched both torpedoes: \"Why did you need to fire the second torpedo so shallow? What did you want to do, kill as many as you could?\" The \"oberleutnant\" replied \"didn't think you were sinking fast enough.\"\n\nFrom 1 to 12 April, \"Aconit\" undertook repairs in Glasgow. On 21 April 1943, at Greenock, General Charles de Gaulle came aboard and awarded the corvette and her commander the \"Croix de la Libération\".\n\nUnder major repairs from 1 September to 10 October 1943, her commander was replaced by \"Lieutenant de vaisseau\" Le Miller. She rejoined the Battle of the Atlantic, attacking a German submarine on 13 December 1943.\n\n\"Aconit\" spent the first months of 1944 in Casablanca and Gibraltar, and on 5 June 1944 she escorted the convoy U-3 from Torbay to France, coming under attack from German airplanes. During the Normandy landings, she was attached to the 108th escort group, along with Free French ships \"Aventure\", \"Escarmouche\" and \"Renoncule\".\n\nShe last fired in anger on 11 April 1945. On 18 April, she undertook minor repairs, and returned to escorting convoys in May, until 5 June 1945, the official date for the end of naval operations in European waters.\n\n\"Aconit\" was briefly used by the French naval school, before being given back to the Royal Navy on 30 April 1947 and renamed HMS \"Aconite\".\n\nIn July 1947 the ship was sold to United Whalers, London, for whaling purposes. Rebuilt as buoy boat (towing vessel) by Harland & Wolff, Belfast, she was delivered in November as Terje 11 to serve the whaling factory \"Balaena\". The company used a second corvette as \"Terje 10\" (the former ) In summer 1951 she was converted in a whale catcher with an ice strengthened bow and worked with \"Balaena\" until the company gave up whaling at the end of the 1959/1960 season.\n\nIn August 1960 the Scottish company Christian Salvesen, with still five former Flower corvettes in service, purchased \"Terje 11\" and renamed the whale catcher Southern Terrier . She worked three seasons with the whaling factory \"Southern Harvester\". \nShe became chartered for her last catching season 1963/1964 by Anders Jahre's A/S Kosmos and worked for the factory ship \"Kosmos IV\", the former German \"Walter Rau\". Laid up in Norway 1964 she was sold for scrapping to Belgium, where she arrived in January 1967.\n\nIn honour of this unit, three French warships have since been named \"Aconit\" including the modern stealth frigate .\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1882706", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1882706", "title": "Medal ribbon", "text": "Medal ribbon\n\nA medal ribbon, service ribbon, or ribbon bar is a small ribbon, mounted on a small metal bar equipped with an attaching device, which is generally issued for wear in place of a medal when it is not appropriate to wear the actual medal. Each country's government has its own rules on what ribbons can be worn in what circumstances and in which order. This is usually defined in an official document and is called \"the order of precedence\" or \"the order of wearing.\" In some countries (particularly in North America and Israel), some awards are \"ribbon only,\" having no associated medal.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), the U.S. military's standard size for a ribbon bar is wide, tall, with a thickness of 0.8 mm.\n\nThe service ribbon for a specific medal is usually identical to the suspension ribbon on the medal. For example, the suspension and service ribbon for the U.S. government's Purple Heart medal is purple with a white vertical stripe at each end (see photo).\n\nHowever, there are some military awards that do not have a suspension ribbon, but have an authorized ribbon and unit award emblem. The Soviet Order of Victory is a badge that was worn on the military parade uniform. However, a ribbon bar representing the Order of Victory was worn on a military field uniform.\nRibbon bars come in a variety of colors. In the case of the U.S. government, it maintains a specific list of colors used on its ribbons, based on the Pantone Matching System and Federal Standard 595 color systems:\n\nThere is a variety of constructions of service ribbons. In some countries, service ribbons are mounted on a \"pin backing\", which can be pushed through the fabric of a uniform and secured, with fasteners, on the inside edge. These ribbons can be individually secured and then lined up, or they can be all mounted on to a single fastener. After the Second World War, it was common for all ribbons to be mounted on a single metal bar and worn in a manner similar to a brooch. Other methods of wearing have included physically sewing each service ribbon onto the uniform garments.\n\n\"Orders of wearing\" define which ribbons may be worn on which types of uniform in which positions under which circumstances. For example, miniature medals on dinner dress, full medals on parade dress, ribbons on dress shirts, but no decorations on combat dress and working clothing. Some countries (such as Cuba) maintain a standard practice of wearing full service ribbons on combat utility clothing. Others strictly prohibit this. These regulations are generally similar to the regulations regarding display of rank insignia and regulations regarding saluting of more senior ranks. The reasoning for such regulations is to prevent these displays from enabling opposing forces to easily identify persons of higher rank and therefore aid them in choosing targets which will have a larger impact on the battlefield. In times of war, it is not uncommon for commanders and other high value individuals to wear no markings on their uniforms and wear clothing and insignia of a lower ranking soldier. \n\nService medals and ribbons are generally worn in rows on the left side of the chest. In certain commemorative or memorial circumstances, a relative may wear the medals or ribbons of a dead relative on the right side of the chest. Medals and ribbons not specifically mentioned in the \"Order of wear\" are also generally worn on the right side of the chest. Sequencing of the ribbons depends on each country's regulations. In the United States, for example, those with the highest status—typically awarded for heroism or distinguished service—are placed at the top of the display, while foreign decorations (when allowed) are last in the bottom rows. When medals are worn (typically on the left side of a shirt or jacket), ribbons with no corresponding medals are worn on the right side.\n\nThe study, history and collection of ribbons, among other military decorations, is known as phaleristics (sometimes spelled \"faleristics\" by users of U.S. English).\n\n\n\nAdmiral of the Fleet Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma (incomplete)\n\nIn the U.S. military, the different federal uniformed services have different methods of wearing ribbon bars on uniforms. In the U.S. Navy, they are worn in rows of three with no staggering or spacing between rows (with the exception of the top row, which may be staggered to the wearer's left if covered by a lapel). For U.S. Navy members who have three or more ribbons, they can elect to wear only their three highest-ranked ones instead of all of them and if their top three ribbons are obscured by a lapel, they can stagger the top row. In the U.S. Marine Corps, they can be worn in rows of three or four, with optional staggering and can be spaced between rows. In the U.S. Army, they can be worn staggered with spacing in between rows. A U.S. serviceman's complete ribbon display is known by a variety of nicknames. It can be referred to colloquially as a \"ribbon rack\" or \"rack\" for short, or a \"fruit salad\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1882707", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1882707", "title": "The Snow Queen (Vinge novel)", "text": "The Snow Queen (Vinge novel)\n\nThe Snow Queen is a 1980 science fiction novel by American writer Joan D. Vinge. It won the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1981, and was also nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1981.\n\nBased on the 1844 fairy tale of the same name by Hans Christian Andersen, \"The Snow Queen\" takes place on a mostly oceanic planet called Tiamat. Tiamat's suns orbit a black hole, which facilitates interstellar wormhole travel and connects Tiamat to the rest of the civilized galaxy (the \"Hegemony\", the remnants of a fallen Galactic Empire).\n\nThe Galactic Empire, which once ruled large portions of the galaxy, fell into decay millennia ago. Its remnants coalesced into a group of seven planets known as the Hegemony. Though the Hegemony has large-scale interstellar travel and high technology, it has not yet returned to the Empire's level of technological prowess.\n\nTiamat is an oceanic planet, accessible to the Hegemony only through wormhole travel. The gravitational pull of Tiamat's twin suns influence the \"Black Gate\". It only remains open for cycles of 150 years; when it is closed, no offworld travelers are able to reach Tiamat for more than a century. The residents of Tiamat are split into two clans: \"Winters\", who advocate technological progress and trade with offworlders, and \"Summers\", who depend on their folk traditions and rigid social distinctions for survival. Every 150 years, control of Tiamat's government switches between Winter rule and Summer rule. Interstellar travel between Tiamat and the Hegemony is only possible during the 150 years of Winter rule, and a single woman rules the entire planet: a \"Snow Queen\" in Winter, a \"Summer Queen\" in Summer. During the Change, or transition of power, the former queen is ritually executed and replaced by her successor in order to avoid open conflict.\n\nThe Hegemony's interest in Tiamat lies in mers, a species of sea-dwelling creatures whose blood contains a virus that halts the aging process. Mers are hunted as frequently as possible during the Winter years. The \"water of life\" produced from their blood allows for virtual immortality. A single Snow Queen reigns for the entire 150-year season. During Winter rule, offworlders bring technology to Tiamat in exchange for the water of life. At the end of Winter, they leave Tiamat and destroy all high technology, leaving Summers to rule under an agrarian lifestyle. In this way, they exploit Tiamat and prevent it from developing the technology to rebel.\n\nArienrhod, the Snow Queen, has secretly implanted several Summer women with clones of herself, in the hopes of extending her rule past her ritual execution at the end of Winter. Moon Dawntreader Summer is the only one of these clones to survive to adolescence. She and her cousin Sparks are lovers. Moon becomes a sibyl, a position of high status among the Summer people. Sibyls are both feared and revered; they possess the ability to answer any question by going into a trance state. Sibyls believe that they receive visions from the Lady, a sea goddess. Sparks is not chosen to become a sibyl. Angry at Moon for joining the sibyls without him and curious about his offworld heritage, he travels to Carbuncle, Tiamat's capital. He is immediately caught up by Arienrhod and eventually becomes the \"Starbuck\", the Snow Queen's consort and commander of the mer hunts.\n\nMoon receives a message, apparently from Sparks, urging her to come to Carbuncle, though sibyls may not legally enter the city. On her way, she becomes entangled with smugglers and is taken offworld. This is normally a one way trip for a Tiamatan citizen. Hegemony law prevents any native Tiamatian from returning after leaving the planet, fearing that travelers would realize how Tiamat is being exploited and use this knowledge to foment rebellion. Arienrhod is crushed; she had planned to draw Moon to Carbuncle and make her the next Summer Queen. Moon was supposed to reject the Summer fear of technology and develop resistance to the Hegemony during the next Summer reign. Arienrhod devises a backup plan; she will unleash a plague at the Change which will kill most Summers and spare most Winters, allowing Tiamat to continue its technological growth before the Hegemony returns.\n\nMoon is taken to the capital planet, Kharemough, and discovers that the Winters' prejudice against sibyls is a political tool used by the Hegemony to preserve its control of technology on Tiamat. Sibyls are highly respected throughout the other planets of the Hegemony; only on Tiamat, due to a careful reinforcement of superstitions during the reign of Winter, are they considered dangerous and mentally unstable. The sibyls are actually part of a data network devised by the Old Empire as a way to rebuild society more quickly after the Empire's fall. Sibyls have the ability to communicate with a vast electronic databank, which explains their ability to answer seemingly unknowable questions. Moon learns from another sibyl that Sparks is in danger, and returns to Tiamat illegally. Due to time dilation, five years pass on Tiamat while Moon is only gone for a period of weeks.\n\nAfter a crash landing and short sojourn as a captive of Winter outlaws, Moon returns to Carbuncle and confronts Arienrhod. Arienrhod's plan to unleash the plague is foiled, but Moon is chosen to become the next Summer Queen. She prepares Tiamat to face the Hegemony as a peer when the 150 years of summer end and interstellar travel is again possible through the black hole.\n\nVinge wrote a sequel to \"The Snow Queen\" called \"The Summer Queen\" (1991), with a novella, \"World's End\" (1984), linking the two. A third novel, \"Tangled Up In Blue\", was published in 2000.\n\nVinge’s novel was well received when it initially came out. Reviewers have admired the complex world-building Vinge created with the planet of Tiamat and the Hegemony calling it a “carefully crafted universe” and “impeccable and expansive”. Reaction to the characters and plot have been mixed. Some reviewers have seen the characters as “distinctive and believable” while other reviewers have felt the characters too casual. The plot has been called “fast-paced and eventful” and “the kind of book that felt much shorter than the 500-odd pages in spans” but also frustrating as “the love story holds very few surprises\" being based on the Hans Christian Andersen story. Some have said the book “feels before its time”.\n\n"}
{"id": "1882715", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1882715", "title": "Tetracapsuloides", "text": "Tetracapsuloides\n\nTetracapsuloides bryosalmonae is a myxozoan parasite of salmonid fish. It is the only species currently recognized in the monotypic genus Tetracapsuloides. It is the cause of Proliferative Kidney Disease (PKD), one of the most serious parasitic diseases of salmonid populations in Europe and North America that can result in losses of up to 90% in infected populations.\n\nUntil the late 1990s, the organism which caused PKD was enigmatic, thus called PKX organism. The causative agent of PKD was recognized as a form of Malacosporean, but the absence of mature spores in salmonid hosts, the lack of fish to fish transmission, and seasonality of the disease suggested that the life cycle of PKX was completed in another host and that infection of salmonids could be accidental.\nKorotneff observed a myxozoan in the bryozoan, \"Plumatella fungosa\", in 1892, which he described as \"Myxosporidium bryozoides\". Myxozoan infection of bryozoans was not reported again until 1996. Ecological investigations of freshwater bryozoans in North America discovered parasitic sacs of a myxozoan species, freely floating in the body cavities of several bryozoans. Molecular analyses indicated that the 18S rDNA sequences of these sacs were indistinguishable from those of PKX. The PKX organism was scientifically described as \"Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae\" Canning, Curry, Feist, Longshaw & Okamura 1999, which was assigned to a new class, the Malacosporea within the phylum Myxozoa. Around the same time, another group described the PKX organism from Arctic char, \"Salvelinus alpinus\", as \"Tetracapsuloides renicola\" Kent, Khattra, Hedrick & Devlin 2000, but the first given name has priority according to the rules of the binomial nomenclature.\n\n\"T. bryosalmonae\" has a two-host life cycle, as other myxosporeans, cycling between freshwater bryozoa and salmonid fish species, rather than an oligochaete or polychaete worm\nas for \"Myxobolus cerebralis\". To date, \"T. bryosalmonae\" has been found to parasitize at last five freshwater bryozoans \"Phylactolaemata\" species belonging to the genera \"Fredericella\" and \"Plumatella\", all considered to be primitive genera. Infected bryozoans release mature T. bryosalmonae malacospores during overt infections when large spore sacs are freely floating within their coelomic cavity . Bryozoan dispersal strategies, including colony fragmentation, statoblast dispersal and the formation of migrating zooids allow their colonization of new habitats and the spreading of infective T. bryosalmonae stages .\n\nProliferative kidney disease (PKD) is characterized by a swollen kidney and spleen, bloody ascites, and pale gills, indicating the fish becomes anemic at the late stage of the disease. Note that those symptoms are common amongst many other fish diseases and do not specifically indicate an infection with \"Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae\". It is important to clarify the pathologic condition only happens in species particularly susceptible, or naïve, to T. bryosalmonae. In those cases, the parasite is allowed to cross the renal tubules wall to proliferate within the interstitial tissue of kidney (=histozoic proliferation). This proliferation stage is a dead end for the parasite (=extrasporogonic proliferation) but instead causes a tumultuous tumour-like tissue reaction in the kidney, inducing a chronic lymphoid hyperplasia marked by a strong parasite-driven immunosuppressant pathogenesis and a dysregulation of T-helper subsets . In advanced pathology stages, this chronic lymphoid hyperplasia causes the development of granulomatous-like lesions, thus resulting in the characteristic swelling of the whole kidney.\n\n\"T. bryosalmonae\" has been recorded in Europe and North America. Phylogenetic analyses of internal transcribed spacer 1 sequences revealed a clade composed of all North American sequences plus a subset of Italian and French sequences. High genetic diversity in North America and the absence of genotypes which are characteristic of the North American clade in the rest of Europe implies that southern Europe was colonized by immigration from North America; however, sequence divergence suggests that this colonization substantially pre-dated human movements of fish. Furthermore, the lack of southern European lineages in the rest of Europe, despite widespread rainbow trout farming, indicates that \"T. bryosalmonae\" is not transported through fisheries activities. This result contrasts with the commonness of fisheries-related introductions of other pathogens and parasites such as \"Myxobolus cerebralis\" and \"Ceratomyxa shasta\".\nPKD is a serious immunopathology causing a high mortality rate, thus with a relevant economic impact for trout aquaculture in Europe and North America.\n\n"}

He succeeded his father-in-law to High Meadow in 1714. Under a marriage settlement dated 3 October 1713, he married Benedicta Maria Theresa Hall, daughter and heiress of Henry Benedict Hall of High Meadow, Gloucestershire and his wife Frances Fortescue. He converted to the Church of England in 1715, perhaps to enable him to sit in parliament.\n\nGage was elected Member of Parliament for Minehead at a by-election on 11 April 1717, but was unseated on petition on 23 May 1717. On 14 September 1720, King George I created him Baron Gage of Castlebar in the county of Mayo, and Viscount Gage of Castle Island in the county of Kerry of the Kingdom of Ireland.\nGage was elected MP for Tewkesbury at a by-election on 25 October 1721 and was elected again at the 1722 general election. In his first session of this parliament, he made several speeches against the special tax on Papists. In April 1727 he spoke for the motion for a vote of credit. He was returned again at the 1727 general election. He exposed the fraudulent sale of the Derwentwater estates on 31 March 1732, and was subsequently rewarded with £2,000 for this under the Greenwich Hospital Act 1735. At the 1734 general election, he was returned again as MP for Tewkesbury. He introduced a bill to prevent clandestine marriages, in 1736, but it was rejected. In 1738, it was rumoured that he was to be appointed as Governor of Barbados, but the appointment was never materialised, probably because he lacked sufficient political connections. He went into opposition with Pulteney in 1739, but in February 1741, he was one of the opposition Whigs who withdrew on the motion for Walpole's removal. He was returned to parliament again at the 1741 general election.\n\nOn 23 April 1744, his cousin, Sir William Gage, 7th Baronet, died without children, and Gage inherited the baronetcy and the family estate of Firle Place. Sir William's late father was Gage's uncle - Sir John Gage, 4th Baronet, Sheriff of Sussex. The main line of the family, up to the 7th Baronet, had been Roman Catholic recusants who had purchased their baronetcy from King James I, and Gage quietly resumed practising Roman Catholicism, although his children were raised in the Church of England. At the 1747 general election, he was returned again for Tewkesbury and joined the opposition. In 1747 was appointed Steward of the Household of Frederick, Prince of Wales and held the post until 1751.\n\nGage's wife died on 25 July 1749, and on 26 December 1750 he married secondly Jane Godfrey, a Gloucestershire heiress. He had extensive remodelling work done on Firle Place and between 1743 and 1753, and was involved in a number of land rights disputes regarding windfall trees, soil rights, and manorial waste. Gage also spent considerable time collecting paintings which are still housed in the Long Gallery of Firle Place today.\n\nGage and his son were defeated at the 1754 general election, having decided not to respond to the threats of his voters only to vote for candidates who promised to give £1,500 towards mending the roads.\n\nGage died on 21 December 1754 and was buried at Firle. He was succeeded by his eldest son William Hall Gage, 2nd Viscount Gage. He also had a daughter, Theresa, and a second son Thomas Gage who went on to fame as Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in British America at the beginning of the American War of Independence.\n\n"}

It is a long established business, formerly known as \"Mother Red Cap\" or \"Mother Damnable's\".\n\nThe first reference to a tavern in the area occurs in 1690. At that time the locality was entirely rural and the proprietors relied on trade passing by on the road from London to Hampstead and Highgate. The name \"Halfway House\" was accordingly also used. It is not clear whether there was one establishment in the first half of the 18th century or two, but by 1751 the \"Mother Red Cap\" and the \"Mother Black Cap\" (now The Black Cap) were both in business. In the late 18th century the \"Mother Red Cap\" was at its present location, and it had acquired a tea garden. Camden Road was later built across the grounds, and the building was reconstructed. The present building dates from 1875 and was designed by H.H. Bridgman.\n\nThe pub and venue in its present large guise is the work of Andrew Marler, a serial developer of Licensed Premises, who owned it as a 200 capacity pub and in 1988 bought the whole 'island site' on which it stands. He then enlarged the pub to a capacity of 1,000 and built the 500 capacity Underworld venue beneath the pub. Marler went on in 1994 to buy the BBC Television Theatre from the BBC and refurbish and launch the site as The Shepherd's Bush Empire, continuing with the business model of selling drinks to customers whilst being professionally entertained.\n\nThe World's End and its Underworld Club, both Camden and Finsbury locations, have won Venue of the Year and hosted bands/artists like Dave Stewart, The Cranberries, Stuck Mojo, The Datsuns, The Darkness and Radiohead, as well as a host of extreme metal bands.\n\n\n"}

She is best known for the songs \"9 to 5\" and \"Love Me or Hate Me\".\n\nLady Sovereign grew up in Chalkhill Estate, a run-down council estate in Wembley Park, London. In 2010, she said \"When I heard Ms. Dynamite's track 'Boooo!' in 2001 it inspired me. I hadn't heard a female MC before that. She's real. Her presence, her image, the way she does everything... she opened so many doors for us girls, MCs are real, they write their own stuff, they rap about what they know, the stuff around them.\"\n\nLady Sovereign began uploading some of her songs and a picture to various music web sites when she was 15. She told \"Newsweek\" in 2006 that comments initially ran along the lines of, \"You're white. You're a girl. You're British. You're crap.\"\n\nLady Sovereign signed with Universal in 2004. She released a number of solo records and opened for Basement Jaxx, the Streets, Dizzee Rascal, D12 and Obie Trice.\n\nHer mother Nicola was diagnosed with a terminal brain tumour and died on 14 March (Mothering Sunday in the UK) 2010.\n\n\"The Battle\" began a string of singles that would push Lady Sovereign into the spotlight. While \"A Little Bit of Shhh!\", \"9 to 5\", and \"Sad Arse Stripah\" were selling well, free Internet-only freestyles like \"Tango\" and \"Cheeky\" were becoming just as popular. On 15 November 2005, Chocolate Industries released the \"Vertically Challenged\" EP, which collected most of her singles recorded to date. In April 2006 she released her second EP, \"Blah Blah\" in the UK. She released yet another EP, but was limited for US radios; \"Size Don't Matter!\" \nAside from her own records, 2005 saw Lady Sovereign appear as a guest or contributor on several projects. She began 2005 by appearing on the grime compilation \"Run the Road\", both as a solo artist and with The Streets. When The Ordinary Boys released the single \"Boys Will Be Boys\", Lady Sovereign came back with a reply remix, featuring the music and chorus of the original, but with mostly her own vocals to the tune of \"girls will be girls\". In May 2006, she was featured on the Ordinary Boys single, \"Nine2Five\", a remixed version of her own \"9 to 5\", credited as \"The Ordinary Boys vs Lady Sovereign.\" \"Nine2Five\" entered the UK top 40 singles at number 39 on downloads only, and jumped to number 6 upon availability as a CD and 7\" vinyl single during the week commencing 22 May 2005. This is her highest chart position to date.\n\nLady Sovereign capped off 2005 by meeting with the American hip hop artist and CEO of the labels Def Jam Recordings and Roc-A-Fella Records, Jay-Z. This marked her foray into the American music scene. With Usher and L.A. Reid seated next to him, Jay-Z asked for one on-the-spot freestyle from Sovereign before offering her a contract with Def Jam. With the single \"Hoodie\", Lady Sovereign released her full-length debut, \"Public Warning\", on Def Jam in 2006. Lady Sovereign is the first non-American female to ever be signed to Def Jam Record Label.\n\nOn 31 October 2006, her debut album, \"Public Warning\", was released, featuring \"Random\", \"9 to 5\", \"Hoodie\" and single, \"Love Me or Hate Me\", which was also released on the same day. The music video for the single features Lady Sovereign mocking stereotypical ideals of femininity by satirizing popular dress and mannerisms. Some of the lyrics include \"I'm fat, I need a diet/No, in fact I'm just here lyin'/I ain't got the biggest breast-ises,/but I write all the bestest hits/I've got hairy armpits/But I don't walk around like this/I wear a big baggy t-shirt that hides that nasty shit.\" With the lyrics continuing in this satirical nature, Lady Sovereign continues to comment on and express her dissonance with female lifestyles in popular culture.\nOn 17 October 2006 \"Love Me or Hate Me\" became the first video by a British artist to reach number 1 on the United States (and original) version of MTV's \"Total Request Live\". \"Love Me or Hate Me\" was released in the UK on 29 January 2007, with the album following on 5 February 2007.\n\nLady Sovereign released a second album in spring 2009. She also went on tour. After a final dispute with Island Records, it was revealed on her official website that she would release the album through her independent record label, Midget Records, and that it was fully written and some songs were already recorded. She also said the album was going to be released in the United States and United Kingdom on 7 April 2009. On Monday, 8 December 2008, Lady Sovereign restated that \"Jigsaw\" would be released on 6 April 2009. She also released a free single entitled \"I Got You Dancing\", making it available on her MySpace and official website. During her \"Jigsaw\" tour she teamed up with DJ Annalyze as her tour DJ.\n\nLady Sovereign has appeared on \"Soccer AM\" several times. She has appeared in a feature story on Cartoon Network and in an educational movie called \"X-ED\".\n\nIn late 2006, \"Love Me Or Hate Me\" was played in a Verizon Wireless advertisement. It also appears on the soundtrack of the video game \"\", and is the theme music for the show \"The Bad Girls Club\". \"9 to 5\" also appears on \"The Bad Girls Club\", as well as on the soundtrack of the Xbox 360's version of EA Sports' \"FIFA World Cup 2006\" video game, on the \"Ugly Betty\" soundtrack and features in the 2007 film \"St Trinian's\", \"Random\" appears on the soundtrack, and features on an episode of Malcolm in The Middle, \"I Got You Dancing\" was featured in \"\", \"Hoodie\" was used for a \"Mario Party\" Nintendo DS commercial.\n\nSome of Lady Sovereign's such as \"9 to 5\" and \"So Human\" were also used on the BBC 1 show \"Waterloo Road\" in 2009/10.

During her performance of \"Love Me Or Hate Me\" the lyrics \"If you hate me, then fuck you\" were changed to \"if you hate me, then I hate you\". Lady Sovereign served as the host and spokesperson for Adult Swim and Chocolate Industries' \"Chocolate Swim\". In January 2010 Bally Total Fitness selected Lady Sovereign and her song \"I Got You Dancing\" for the featured artist section on their website, the song is also being used in their television commercials.\n\nOn 22 January 2010, Sovereign was due to appear on \"This Week\", a BBC political review show, to discuss the laws regarding self-defence for householders. Early in the programme, she was shown backstage waving to camera in anticipation of her appearance. However, when the segment began, presenter Andrew Neil apologised to viewers and explained the rapper had \"done a runner.\" Neil instead discussed the topic with regular contributors Michael Portillo and Diane Abbott and concluded by joking \"Who needs Lady Sovereign? Who \"is\" Lady Sovereign?\" Abbott laughed and responded \"I don't know.\" In an interview with \"The Guardian\"'s Rich Pelley on 30 January, Lady Sovereign said of the incident: \"I had a panic attack! My hands went stiff and I started hyperventilating. I didn't want to do it hours before but I went anyway, then I just changed my mind at the last minute, I guess.\"\n\nLady Sovereign appeared on British game show \"Total Wipeout\"'s eighth celebrity special. She made it to the second round by default but failed to advance any further. She was the third evicted housemate from the seventh series of \"Celebrity Big Brother\". She was nominated for both the first and second evictions. Having survived the first double eviction, she was evicted the second time around with 69.5% of the vote.\n\nIn September 2009, while in Brisbane, Australia for the Parklife Festival, Lady Sovereign was arrested for assault and drunk and disorderly behaviour after spitting on a nightclub bouncer. She had only been in the country seven hours before the assault occurred. She was ordered to pay a fine of $400 AUD, and $200 AUD in compensation to the bouncer.\n\nLady Sovereign was involved in a feud with fellow British rapper, Jentina.\n\nIn a 2010 interview with \"Diva\" magazine, Lady Sovereign said she came out as a lesbian in the house during \"Celebrity Big Brother\" but that her declaration did not end up in the broadcast show.\n\nLady Sovereign has not released any music since 2009.

The group appeared in a text feature in \"Captain America\" #4 (June 1941), but were swiftly moved into the comic-proper to help Cap in his battles, and became popular enough to be spun into its own title.\n\nIn \"American Comic Book Chronicles: 1940-1944\", Kurt Mitchell and Roy Thomas take a negative view of the group, describing the four new characters: \"Jefferson \"Jeff\" Sandervilt was the brainy kid, Percival Aloysius \"Knuckles\" O'Toole the tough kid, Henry \"Tubby\" Tinkle the fat kid, and (alas) Whitewash Jones the harmonica-playing, watermelon-loving, racist-caricature kid.\"\n\nAccording to \"Jess Nevins' Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes\", \"They primarily fight Axis agents: the Red Skull, Agent Zero, the Monk, the Black Talon, the Khan, the Owl, and so on. There are also ordinary gangsters and name criminals like the Doll-Devil, the Python, and the Mad Fiend of Horror Castle.\"\n\nLaunched in Summer 1941 after only a couple of appearances in the pages of \"Captain America\", the \"Sentinels of Liberty\" were revised, renamed \"The Young Allies\" and joined by the original Human Torch's sidekick Toro. By this time, Simon and Kirby were in the process of leaving Timely for DC Comics, and relationships were strained, so while the first issue of the \"Young Allies\" series was pencilled by Kirby (under the shared \"Charles Nicholas\" pseudonym), it was written by a young Stan Lee. By issue #2, Kirby had left, and the art duties were taken over by Al Gabriele and former \"Captain America\" inker (and then penciler, in the wake of Simon and Kirby's departure) Syd Shores. (Art duties would change considerably over the course of the title's run.)\n\nThe first issue saw the (mostly non-superhero) team fight Captain America's nemesis the Red Skull, and is often labelled as \"the first ongoing comic to team up characters from two or more other Marvel series.\" The team frequently traveled the world to participate in World War II skirmishes and, in keeping with the somewhat exaggerated scope of the series, eventually literally beat up all three major Axis leaders: Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini, and Hideki Tojo, something that none of their elders accomplished.\n\n\"Young Allies Comics\" lasted until issue #20 (October 1946), and also appeared in \"Amazing Comics\", \"Complete Comics\" and \"Kid Komics\". Toro and Bucky would continue to team-up briefly, \"as members of the All-Winners Squad ... [b]ut Knuckles, Jeff, Tubby and Whitewash weren't seen again.\"\n\nIn the \"Young Allies Comics 70th Anniversary Special\" (2009), their comic book adventures are revealed to be fictional retellings of their real exploits. Their real names are Pat O'Toole, Washington Carver Jones, Geoffrey Worthington Vandergill, and Henry Yosef Tinklebaum. The first two are still alive in the modern day.\n\nThe second group of Young Allies was founded on the Heroes Reborn world, now called Counter-Earth, after the Avengers and Fantastic Four returned home and the planet suffered several devastating blows in the wake of their leaving. While several members share codenames with their predecessors on Earth-616, they have little else in common with the prior group.\n\n\nThe Young Allies came into conflict with the Redeemers, a US government-backed team related to the Thunderbolts, while the Redeemers were supervised by Captain America, who, due to amnesia, had forgotten his time on the other Earth with the Allies' Bucky. The conflict was caused by Allies' creation of a hoax chemical weapons scare in the \"main\" Earth's Latveria in an attempt to force Doctor Doom, the then-ruler of Counter-Earth, to distribute food and medicine more evenly. When they left, Bucky was left sore that Cap thought she would be capable of really using a WMD, causing Cap to lie to Doom that other canisters had been hidden. Later, they encountered the Thunderbolts themselves on their homeworld, while a rift was threatening to destroy both worlds. When the crisis was resolved and the Thunderbolts returned home, Jolt remained behind with the team.\n\nLater, the Exiles visited Counter-Earth to save it from Proteus, in their teammate Morph's body. At first, Proteus convinced the Young Allies to fight the Exiles. The Young Allies later figured out the truth when Proteus was enjoying torturing the Exiles. Proteus seemed to be winning, but two cosmic entities known as \"O\" and \"K\" ripped Proteus away from the Exiles, saying that they've been waiting for him. They supplied Proteus with an army of nukes. Empress Dorma and Proteus soon clashed, resulting in Proteus taking Dorma's crown, drying up Atlantis, and killing her and her soldiers. The Exiles arrived with the Young Allies at Atlantis. Proteus then launched the nukes. Luckily, Colt and Jolt stopped the nukes without detonating them. Proteus had the Exiles and the Young Allies on the ropes when he put his crown back on. Unbeknownst to him, however, Blink rigged it with a behavior modifier- causing Proteus to believe he really is Morph and being trapped in Morph's body. The Exiles then teleported back to Panoptichron and sent the last remaining nukes into space. The Young Allies then thanked the Exiles for saving their world from the nukes, Dorma, and Proteus as they left.\n\nAs part of the Heroic Age line-wide reboot, a new team and ongoing series was introduced, written by Sean McKeever, with art by David Baldeon. McKeever has said:\n\nMembers include Nomad, Firestar, Spider-Girl, Gravity and Toro (Benito Serrano). The series was cancelled with \"Young Allies\" #6. They become a team in \"Onslaught Unleashed\" #1. They also appear with the Avengers Academy in \"Avengers Academy Giant-Size\" #1 (80-page one-shot), at the Avengers Academy prom night in \"Avengers Academy\" Issue# 13, the \"Fear Itself: Youth in Revolt\" mini-series, and the Spider-Island saga.\n\nSome of the comics have been collected into individual volumes:\n\n"}

The statement was announced by Girard in 1625, and again by Fermat in 1640, but neither supplied a proof.\n\nThe \"only if\" clause is easy: a perfect square is congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 4, hence a sum of two squares is congruent to 0, 1, or 2. An odd prime number is congruent to either 1 or 3 modulo 4, and the second possibility has just been ruled out. The first proof that such a representation exists was given by Leonhard Euler in 1747 and was complicated. Since then, many different proofs have been found. Among them, the proof using Minkowski's theorem about convex sets and Don Zagier's short proof based on involutions have appeared.\n\nEuler succeeded in proving Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares in 1749, when he was forty-two years old. He communicated this in a letter to Goldbach dated 12 April 1749. The proof relies on infinite descent, and is only briefly sketched in the letter. The full proof consists in five steps and is published in two papers. The first four steps are Propositions 1 to 4 of the first paper and do not correspond exactly to the four steps below. The fifth step below is from the second paper.\n\nFor the avoidance of ambiguity, zero will always be a valid possible constituent of \"sums of two squares\", so for example every square of an integer is trivially expressible as the sum of two squares by setting one of them to be zero.\n\n1. \"The product of two numbers, each of which is a sum of two squares, is itself a sum of two squares.\"\n\n2. \"If a number which is a sum of two squares is divisible by a prime which is a sum of two squares, then the quotient is a sum of two squares.\"\n(This is Euler's first Proposition).\n\n3. \"If a number which can be written as a sum of two squares is divisible by a number which is not a sum of two squares, then the quotient has a factor which is not a sum of two squares.\" (This is Euler's second Proposition).\n\n4. \"If formula_29 and formula_30 are relatively prime positive integers then every factor of formula_3 is a sum of two squares.\"\n(This is the step that uses step (3.) to produce an 'infinite descent' and was Euler's Proposition 4. The proof sketched below also includes the proof of his Proposition 3).\n\n5. \"Every prime of the form formula_79 is a sum of two squares.\"\n(This is the main result of Euler's second paper).\n\nLagrange completed a proof in 1775 based on his general theory of integral quadratic forms. The following presentation incorporates a slight simplification of his argument, due to Gauss, which appears in article 182 of the Disquisitiones Arithmeticae.\n\nAn (integral binary) quadratic form is an expression of the form formula_105 with formula_106 integers. A number formula_107 is said to be \"represented by the form\" if there exist integers formula_108 such that formula_109. Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares is then equivalent to the statement that a prime formula_82 is represented by the form formula_111 (i.e., formula_112, formula_113) exactly when formula_82 is congruent to formula_91 modulo formula_116.\n\nThe discriminant of the quadratic form is defined to be formula_117. The discriminant of formula_111 is then equal to formula_119.\n\nTwo forms formula_120 and formula_121 are \"equivalent\" if and only if there exist substitutions with integer coefficients\nwith formula_124 such that, when substituted into the first form, yield the second. Equivalent forms are readily seen to have the same discriminant, and hence also the same parity for the middle coefficient formula_125, which coincides with the parity of the discriminant. Moreover, it is clear that equivalent forms will represent exactly the same integers, because these kind of substitutions can be reversed by substitutions of the same kind.\n\nLagrange proved that all positive definite forms of discriminant −4 are equivalent. Thus, to prove Fermat's theorem it is enough to find \"any\" positive definite form of discriminant −4 that represents formula_82. For example, one can use a form\nwhere the first coefficient \"a\" = formula_82 was chosen so that the form represents formula_82 by setting \"x\" = 1, and \"y\" = 0, the coefficient \"b\" = 2\"m\" is an arbitrary even number (as it must be, to get an even discriminant), and finally formula_130 is chosen so that the discriminant formula_131 is equal to −4, which guarantees that the form is indeed equivalent to formula_132. Of course, the coefficient formula_130 must be an integer, so the problem is reduced to finding some integer \"m\" such that formula_82 divides formula_135: or in other words, a \" 'square root of -1 modulo formula_82' \".\n\nWe claim such a square root of formula_137 is given by formula_138. Firstly it follows from Euclid's Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic that formula_139. Consequently, formula_140: that is, formula_141 are their own inverses modulo formula_82 and this property is unique to them. It then follows from the validity of Euclidean division in the integers, and the fact that formula_82 is prime, that for every formula_144 the gcd of formula_29 and formula_82 may be expressed via the Euclidean algorithm yielding a unique and \"distinct\" inverse formula_147 of formula_29 modulo formula_82. In particular therefore the product of \"all\" non-zero residues modulo formula_82 is formula_137. Let formula_152: from what has just been observed, formula_153. But by definition, since each term in formula_154 may be paired with its negative in formula_155, formula_156, which since formula_82 is odd shows that formula_158, as required.\n\nRichard Dedekind gave at least two proofs of Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares, both using the arithmetical properties of the Gaussian integers, which are numbers of the form \"a\" + \"bi\", where \"a\" and \"b\" are integers, and \"i\" is the square root of −1. One appears in section 27 of his exposition of ideals published in 1877; the second appeared in Supplement XI to Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet's \"Vorlesungen über Zahlentheorie\", and was published in 1894.\n\n1. First proof. If formula_82 is an odd prime number, then we have formula_160 in the Gaussian integers. Consequently, writing a Gaussian integer ω = \"x\" + \"iy\" with \"x,y\" ∈ Z and applying the Frobenius automorphism in Z[\"i\"]/(\"p\"), one finds\nsince the automorphism fixes the elements of Z/(\"p\"). In the current case, formula_80 for some integer n, and so in the above expression for ω, the exponent (p-1)/2 of -1 is even. Hence the right hand side equals ω, so in this case the Frobenius endomorphism of Z[\"i\"]/(\"p\") is the identity.\n\nKummer had already established that if } is the order of the Frobenius automorphism of Z[\"i\"]/(\"p\"), then the ideal formula_163 in Z[\"i\"] would be a product of 2/\"f\" distinct prime ideals. (In fact, Kummer had established a much more general result for any extension of Z obtained by adjoining a primitive \"m\"-th root of unity, where \"m\" was any positive integer; this is the case of that result.) Therefore, the ideal (\"p\") is the product of two different prime ideals in Z[\"i\"]. Since the Gaussian integers are a Euclidean domain for the norm function formula_164, every ideal is principal and generated by a nonzero element of the ideal of minimal norm. Since the norm is multiplicative, the norm of a generator formula_165 of one of the ideal factors of (\"p\") must be a strict divisor of formula_166, so that we must have formula_167, which gives Fermat's theorem.\n\n2. Second proof. This proof builds on Lagrange's result that if formula_80 is a prime number, then there must be an integer \"m\" such that formula_169 is divisible by \"p\" (we can also see this by Euler's criterion); it also uses the fact that the Gaussian integers are a unique factorization domain (because they are a Euclidean domain). Since does not divide either of the Gaussian integers formula_170 and formula_171 (as it does not divide their imaginary parts), but it does divide their product formula_169, it follows that formula_82 cannot be a prime element in the Gaussian integers. We must therefore have a nontrivial factorization of \"p\" in the Gaussian integers, which in view of the norm can have only two factors (since the norm is multiplicative, and formula_174, there can only be up to two factors of p), so it must be of the form formula_175 for some integers formula_176 and formula_177. This immediately yields that formula_1.\n\nFor formula_82 congruent to formula_91 mod formula_116 a prime, formula_137 is a quadratic residue mod formula_82 by Euler's criterion. Therefore, there exists an integer formula_184 such that formula_82 divides formula_135. Let formula_187 be the standard basis elements for the vector space formula_188 and set formula_189 and formula_190. Consider the lattice formula_191. If formula_192 then formula_193. Thus formula_82 divides formula_195 for any formula_196.\n\nThe area of the fundamental parallelogram of the lattice is formula_82. The area of the open disk, formula_198, of radius formula_199 centered around the origin is formula_200. Furthermore, formula_198 is convex and symmetrical about the origin. Therefore, by Minkowski's theorem there exists a nonzero vector formula_196 such that formula_203. Both formula_204 and formula_205 so formula_206. Hence formula_82 is the sum of the squares of the components of formula_208.\n\nLet formula_209 be prime, let formula_210 denote the natural numbers (with or without zero), and consider the finite set formula_211 of triples of numbers.\nThen formula_212 has two involutions: an obvious one formula_213 whose fixed points formula_214 correspond to representations of formula_82 as a sum of two squares, and a more complicated one,\n\nwhich has exactly one fixed point formula_217. Two involutions over the same finite set must have sets of fixed points with the same parity, and since the second involution has an odd number of fixed points, so does the first.\nZero is even, so the first involution has a nonzero number of fixed points, any one of which gives a representation of formula_82 as a sum of two squares.\n\nThis proof, due to Zagier, is a simplification of an earlier proof by Heath-Brown, which in turn was inspired by a proof of Liouville. The technique of the proof is a combinatorial analogue of the topological principle that the Euler characteristics of a topological space with an involution and of its fixed-point set have the same parity and is reminiscent of the use of \"sign-reversing involutions\" in the proofs of combinatorial bijections.\n\nThis proof is equivalent to a geometric or \"visual\" proof using \"windmill\" figures, described in this MathOverflow post and this Mathologer YouTube video .\n\nIn 2016, A. David Christopher gave a partition-theoretic proof by considering partitions of the odd prime formula_107 having exactly two sizes formula_220, each occurring exactly formula_221 times, and by showing that at least one such partition exists if formula_107 is congruent to 1 modulo 4.\n\n"}

{"id": "1882827", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1882827", "title": "Liberal Catholic Church International", "text": "Liberal Catholic Church International\n\nThe Liberal Catholic Church International (LCCI) is a Christian church with headquarters in Casa Grande, Arizona, USA. The Church traces its founding to Jesus and the Twelve Apostles and sees the Bishops of the Church as the successors of the Apostles. While it derives its apostolic succession from the Old Catholic Church, the LCCI is today not in full communion with either the Utrecht Union, or the Roman Catholic Church, and differs with them theologically in several important respects.\n\nAs of 2017, the LCCI has a presence in North America, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Indonesia.\n\nThe Church maintains a high level of intellectual liberty for its members in such matters as the interpretation of creeds, as well as freedom of conscience. From 1956 to 1994, due to its emphasis of Freedom of Belief, no definitive statement of \"Official Teachings\" of the Church existed. In response to the many inquiries of persons interested knowing more about the Church, the General Episcopal Synod saw fit in 1994 to assemble a list of teachings that they felt reflected the character of the LCCI. It should be understood, however, that these statements are teachings, but not required beliefs. The Church's stance on freedom of thought has not been abandoned. A selection from this list follows: \n\n\nIn 2004, the GES approved the ordination of women to all Holy Orders up to and including Bishop.\n\nThe Liberal Catholic Church International is governed by the \"General Episcopal Synod\" of all Bishops. The Synod meets formally about every three years and it elects a Presiding Bishop from among their ranks as the church's titular head. The General Episcopal Synod also elects Priests to the Episcopacy, with the approval of the parishes of their respective provinces. The current Presiding Bishop is the Most Reverend Bennett D. D. Burke.\n\nEach province is governed by a Regionary Bishop who, in turn, may have one or more Bishops functioning as auxiliaries. For the most part these clergy are not financially compensated and hold secular jobs.\n\nLaypersons in the Church come from diverse backgrounds and from all spiritual paths. Due to the open nature of the Church, no layperson is required to accept any of the more \"formal\" beliefs of the Church, and are allowed to accept or reject them as they please.\n\nTraining for the clergy varies from diocese to diocese, but generally postulants take distance study courses from the Archbishop Charles W. Finn Theological Seminary, which offers three tracks of study: one for Holy Orders, one for lay theologian, and another for personal enrichment.\n\nSeminarians are encouraged to pray the Divine Office of the Church, specifically the morning prayer or Prime, and the evening prayer or Complin.\n\nThe Church uses its own liturgy, today known as the Liberal Rite. This liturgy was mostly composed by Bishop Wedgwood, with Bishop Leadbeater assisting on the Collects, and selecting the Psalms, canticles, and weekly epistle and gospel readings. The rite focuses more on the glorification of God, rather than the depravity of man.\n\nBoth the ordained and the laity may enter the religious life as friars or sisters. A candidate takes vows confirming their desire to follow the order's common rule.\n\nCurrently there are two religious orders in the church, including the Apostolic Society of St. Brigid of Kildare (SSB), and the Order of St. John the Apostle (OSJA).\n\nThe Church traces its apostolic succession to Archbishop Arnold Harris Mathew. Mathew was consecrated bishop on 28 April 1908, by Utrecht Archbishop Gerhardus Gul, assisted by the Old Catholic bishops of Deventer and Berne, in St. Gertrude's Old Catholic Cathedral, Utrecht. Only two years later, Mathew declared his autonomy from the Union of Utrecht, with which he had experienced tension from the beginning. It was only a short time later that Bishop Mathew found himself at odds with his own clergy in Great Britain and ultimately walked away to seek union with the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nThe founding bishop of the Liberal Catholic Church was James I. Wedgwood of the Wedgwood China family, formerly a cleric in the Church of England (Anglican). Wedgwood grew dissatisfied with the Church, and discovered the Theosophical Society, which had a stronger appeal to his sense of life and justice. When Archbishop Mathew sought to ordain those clergy who were dissatisfied with the Church of England, Wedgwood was one who joined the new Old Catholic Church of England. Archbishop Mathew knew of Wedgwood's membership in the Theosophical Society, as well as that of other clergy in the Old Catholic Church of England, and originally promised that this would not be a problem, but later retracted that promise and asked all clergy to resign from the Theosophical Society. Not willing to do so, Father Wedgwood and most of the Old Catholic Church in England found themselves without a bishop as they withdrew from Archbishop Mathew's leadership.\n\nOne of the men whom Archbishop Mathew had consecrated to the episcopate, Bishop Frederick Samuel Willoughby, offered to consecrate and elevate one of the withdrawn clergy to the episcopate so that they would not be without a bishop. Father Wedgwood was selected and elevated to the episcopate on February 13, 1916. The Church was eventually reorganized and renamed The Liberal Catholic Church. Archbishop Wedgwood then consecrated another former Anglican priest, Charles W. Leadbeater, later that same year, with Bishop Leadbeater going on to become the second presiding bishop of the Church in later years.\n\nThe LCCI arose from the 1941 schism of the Liberal Catholic Church in the United States, which surrounded the controversy involving American Regionary Bishop Charles Hampton, who wished to keep adherence to Theosophical tenets optional for all clergy, in accordance with the wishes of the church's first two Presiding Bishops, James I. Wedgwood and Charles W. Leadbeater.\n\nDuring the controversy of the 1940s, the third presiding bishop, Frank W. Pigott, who embraced a more Theosophical vision for the church's future, suspended Bishop Hampton and all the clergy under him who refused to endorse his episcopal replacement. Bishop Pigott also ordered the confiscation of church property at the Regionary headquarters in California. The American Synod saw this as a breach of canon law and a violation of the laws of California under which the church had been incorporated in America.\n\nThe majority of clergy in America, who had supported Bishop Hampton, broke with Bishop Pigott and continued as the Liberal Catholic Church, with Bishop Ray M. Wardall becoming the 4th Presiding Bishop in 1943. The Church eventually won the right in a court of law to use the name The Liberal Catholic Church (while being called the Liberal Catholic Church International in the rest of the world), although the litigation was settled after Bishop Hampton's death.\n\nIn 1955, Edward M Matthews became the 5th Presiding Bishop, followed by Francis Erwin in 1962. The 7th Presiding Bishop was William H. Daw in 1970, followed by Joseph Neth in 1974. The 9th Presiding Bishop was Dean E. Bekken in 1989, followed by Charles W. Finn, James P. Roberts, and Jason Sanderson. Bennett D. D. Burke was raised to the office of Presiding Bishop in February 2016.\n\nOn October 13th, 2019, The Most Rev. Celia Jose, pastor of St. Michael and All Angels Liberal Catholic Cathedral, was installed as Presiding Bishop at the Cathedral Church of St. Thomas the Apostle, during the church's Synod in New York. She was the first woman and the first Latina to hold this office. \n\n"}
