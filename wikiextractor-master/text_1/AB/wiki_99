There are two main types: guyed and self-supporting structures. They are among the tallest human-made structures. Masts are often named after the broadcasting organizations that originally built them or currently use them. \n\nIn the case of a mast radiator or radiating tower, the whole mast or tower is itself the transmitting antenna.\n\nThe terms \"mast\" and \"tower\" are often used interchangeably. However, in structural engineering terms, a tower is a self-supporting or cantilevered structure, while a mast is held up by stays or guys. Broadcast engineers in the UK use the same terminology. A mast is a ground-based or rooftop structure that supports antennas at a height where they can satisfactorily send or receive radio waves. Typical masts are of steel lattice or tubular steel construction. Masts themselves play no part in the transmission of mobile telecommunications.\nMasts (to use the civil engineering terminology) tend to be cheaper to build but require an extended area surrounding them to accommodate the guy wires. Towers are more commonly used in cities where land is in short supply.\n\nThere are a few borderline designs that are partly free-standing and partly guyed, called additionally guyed towers. For example:\n\nExperimental radio broadcasting began in 1905, and commercial radio broke through in the 1920s.\n\nUntil August 8, 1991, the Warsaw radio mast was the world's tallest supported structure on land; its collapse left the KVLY/KTHI-TV mast as the tallest. There are over 50 radio structures in the United States that are 600 m (1968.5 ft) or taller.\n\nThe steel lattice is the most widespread form of construction. It provides great strength, low weight and wind resistance, and economy in the use of materials. Lattices of triangular cross-section are most common, and square lattices are also widely used. Guyed masts are often used; the supporting guy lines carry lateral forces such as wind loads, allowing the mast to be very narrow and simply constructed. \n\nWhen built as a tower, the structure may be parallel-sided or taper over part or all of its height. When constructed of several sections which taper exponentially with height, in the manner of the Eiffel Tower, the tower is said to be an Eiffelized one. The Crystal Palace tower in London is an example.\nGuyed masts are sometimes also constructed out of steel tubes. This construction type has the advantage that cables and other components can be protected from weather inside the tube and consequently the structure may look cleaner.\nThese masts are mainly used for FM-/TV-broadcasting, but sometimes also as mast radiator. The big mast of Mühlacker transmitting station is a good example of this. \nA disadvantage of this mast type is that it is much more affected by winds than masts with open bodies. Several tubular guyed masts have collapsed. In the UK, the Emley Moor and Waltham TV stations masts collapsed in the 1960s. In Germany the Bielstein transmitter collapsed in 1985.\nTubular masts were not built in all countries. In Germany, France, UK, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Japan and the Soviet Union, many tubular guyed masts were built, while there are nearly none in Poland or North America.\n\nIn several cities in Russia and Ukraine several tubular guyed masts with crossbars running from the mast structure to the guys were built in the 1960s. All these masts, which are designed as 30107 KM, are exclusively used for FM and TV transmission and, except for the mast in Vinnytsia, are between tall.\nThe crossbars of these masts are equipped with a gangway that holds smaller antennas, though their main purpose is oscillation damping.\n\nReinforced concrete towers are relatively expensive to build but provide a high degree of mechanical rigidity in strong winds. This can be important when antennas with narrow beamwidths are used, such as those used for microwave point-to-point links, and when the structure is to be occupied by people.\n\nIn the 1950s, AT&T built numerous concrete towers, more resembling silos than towers, for its first transcontinental microwave route.\n\nIn Germany and the Netherlands most towers constructed for point-to-point microwave links are built of reinforced concrete, while in the UK most are lattice towers.\n\nConcrete towers can form prestigious landmarks, such as the CN Tower in Toronto, Canada. In addition to accommodating technical staff, these buildings may have public areas such as observation decks or restaurants.\n\nThe Stuttgart TV tower was the first tower in the world to be built in reinforced concrete. It was designed in 1956 by the local civil engineer Fritz Leonhardt.\n\nFiberglass poles are occasionally used for low-power non-directional beacons or medium-wave broadcast transmitters. Carbon fibre monopoles and towers have traditionally been too expensive but recent developments in the way the carbon fibre tow is spun have resulted in solutions that offer strengths similar or exceeding steel for a fraction of the weight which has allowed monopoles and towers to be built in locations that were too expensive or difficult to access with the heavy lifting equipment that is needed for a steel structure.\n\nWood has been superseded in use by metal and composites for tower construction. Many wood towers were built in the UK during World War II because of a shortage of steel. In Germany before World War II wooden towers were used at nearly all medium-wave transmission sites which have all been demolished, except for the Gliwice Radio Tower.\n\nFerryside television relay station is an example of a TV relay transmitter using a wooden pole.\n\nShorter masts may consist of a self-supporting or guyed wooden pole, similar to a telegraph pole. Sometimes self-supporting tubular galvanized steel poles are used: these may be termed monopoles.\n\nIn some cases, it is possible to install transmitting antennas on the roofs of tall buildings. In North America, for instance, there are transmitting antennas on the Empire State Building, the Willis Tower, 4 Times Square, and One World Trade Center. The North Tower of the original World Trade Center also had a telecommunications antenna atop its roof, constructed in 1978–1979, and began transmission in 1980. When the buildings collapsed, several local TV and radio stations were knocked off the air until backup transmitters could be put into service. Such facilities also exist in Europe, particularly for portable radio services and low-power FM radio stations. In London, the BBC erected in 1936 a mast for broadcasting early television on one of the towers of a Victorian building, the Alexandra Palace. It is still in use.\n\nMany people view bare cellphone towers as ugly and an intrusion into their neighbourhoods. Even though people increasingly depend upon cellular communications, they are opposed to the bare towers spoiling otherwise scenic views. Many companies offer to 'hide' cellphone towers in, or as, trees, church towers, flag poles, water tanks and other features. There are many providers that offer these services as part of the normal tower installation and maintenance service. These are generally called \"stealth towers\" or \"stealth installations\", or simply concealed cell sites.\n\nThe level of detail and realism achieved by disguised cellphone towers is remarkably high; for example, such towers disguised as trees are nearly indistinguishable from the real thing, even for local wildlife (who additionally benefit from the artificial flora). Such towers can be placed unobtrusively in national parks and other such protected places, such as towers disguised as cacti in United States' Coronado National Forest.\n\nEven when disguised, however, such towers can create controversy; a tower doubling as a flagpole attracted controversy in 2004 in relation to the US Presidential campaign of that year, and highlighted the sentiment that such disguises serve more to allow the installation of such towers in subterfuge away from public scrutiny rather than to serve towards the beautification of the landscape.\n\nDisguised cell sites sometimes can be introduced into environments that require a low-impact visual outcome, by being made to look like trees, chimneys or other common structures.\n\nA mast radiator is a radio tower or mast in which the whole structure works as an antenna. It is used frequently as a transmitting antenna for long or medium wave broadcasting.\n\nStructurally, the only difference is that a mast radiator may be supported on an insulator at its base. In the case of a tower, there will be one insulator supporting each leg.\n\nA special form of the radio tower is the \"telescopic mast\". These can be erected very quickly. Telescopic masts are used predominantly in setting up temporary radio links for reporting on major news events, and for temporary communications in emergencies. They are also used in tactical military networks. They can save money by needing to withstand high winds only when raised, and as such are widely used in amateur radio.\n\nTelescopic masts consist of two or more concentric sections and come in two principal types:\n\nA tethered balloon or a kite can serve as a temporary support. It can carry an antenna or a wire (for VLF, LW or MW) up to an appropriate height. Such an arrangement is used occasionally by military agencies or radio amateurs. The American broadcasters TV Martí broadcast a television program to Cuba by means of such a balloon.\n\nIn 2013, interest began in using unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) for telecom purposes.\n\nFor two VLF transmitters wire antennas spun across deep valleys are used. The wires are supported by small masts or towers or rock anchors. The same technique was also used at Criggion radio station.\n\nFor ELF transmitters ground dipole antennas are used. Such structures require no tall masts. They consist of two electrodes buried deep in the ground at least a few dozen kilometres apart. From the transmitter building to the electrodes, overhead feeder lines run. These lines look like power lines of the 10 kV level, and are installed on similar pylons.\n\n\nFor transmissions in the shortwave range, there is little to be gained by raising the antenna more than a few wavelengths above ground level. Shortwave transmitters rarely use masts taller than about 100 metres.\n\nBecause masts, towers and the antennas mounted on them require maintenance, access to the whole of the structure is necessary. Small structures are typically accessed with a ladder. Larger structures, which tend to require more frequent maintenance, may have stairs and sometimes a lift, also called a service elevator.\n\nTall structures in excess of certain legislated heights are often equipped with aircraft warning lamps, usually red, to warn pilots of the structure's existence. In the past, ruggedized and under-run filament lamps were used to maximize the bulb life. Alternatively, neon lamps were used. Nowadays such lamps tend to use LED arrays.\n\nHeight requirements vary across states and countries, and may include additional rules such as requiring a white flashing strobe in the daytime and pulsating red fixtures at night. Structures over a certain height may also be required to be painted with contrasting color schemes such as white and orange or white and red to make them more visible against the sky.\n\nIn some countries where light pollution is a concern, tower heights may be restricted so as to reduce or eliminate the need for aircraft warning lights. For example, in the United States the 1996 Telecommunications Act allows local jurisdictions to set maximum heights for towers, such as limiting tower height to below and therefore not requiring aircraft illumination under US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules.\n\nOne problem with radio masts is the danger of wind-induced oscillations. This is particularly a concern with steel tube construction. One can reduce this by building cylindrical shock-mounts into the construction. One finds such shock-mounts, which look like cylinders thicker than the mast, for example, at the radio masts of DHO38 in Saterland. There are also constructions, which consist of a free-standing tower, usually from reinforced concrete, onto which a guyed radio mast is installed. One example is the Gerbrandy Tower in Lopik, Netherlands. Further towers of this building method can be found near Smilde, Netherlands and the in Waldenburg, Germany.\n\nRadio, television and cell towers have been documented to pose a hazard to birds. Reports have been issued documenting known bird fatalities and calling for research to find ways to minimize the hazard that communications towers can pose to birds. There have also been instances of rare birds nesting in cell towers and thereby preventing repair work due to legislation intended to protect them.\n\n\n"}

It is usually sweetened with molasses, though honey, sugar, brown sugar, or maple syrup are sometimes used instead. In the U.S. state of Vermont, oatmeal and lemon juice were sometimes added to the beverage.\n\nSwitchel debatably originated in the Caribbean, but New England also holds credit as the source of switchel, and it became a popular summer drink in the American Colonies in the late 17th century. By the 19th century, it had become a traditional drink to serve to thirsty farmers at hay harvest time, hence the nickname haymaker's punch. Herman Melville wrote in \"I and My Chimney\", \"I will give a traveler a cup of switchel, if he want it; but am I bound to supply him with a sweet taste?\" In \"The Long Winter\" Laura Ingalls Wilder describes a switchel-like beverage that her mother had sent for Laura and her father to drink while haying: \"Ma had sent them ginger-water. She had sweetened the cool well-water with sugar, flavored it with vinegar, and put in plenty of ginger to warm their stomachs so they could drink till they were not thirsty. Ginger-water would not make them sick, as plain cold water would when they were so hot.\"\n\nThe Vermont physician D. C. Jarvis recommended a similar drink (a mixture of honey and cider vinegar), which he called \"honegar\".\n\nSwitchel is experiencing a renewed interest and has become a steadily-growing category in the ready-to-drink beverage industry. As of 2015, there are several companies that produce and distribute switchel beverages throughout the US. Canada has two commercial switchel producers. \n\nIt has also been used in recent years as a base in alcoholic cocktails, or as a mixer.\n\n"}

One of the oldest towns in Europe, its position at the end of a long, protected bay and next to prime agricultural land has long made it attractive for human settlement. Stari Grad is also a municipality within the Split-Dalmatia County.\n\nThe most ancient part of Stari Grad falls within the UNESCO Protected World Heritage Site of the Stari Grad Plain, while the entire municipality lies within the surrounding buffer zone.\n\nStari Grad was originally named Faros () by the Greek settlers from the island of Paros, who arrived in 384 BC. It is thought that the name may come from the previous inhabitants of the area. A great naval battle was recorded a year after the establishment of Pharos colony by a Greek inscription in Pharos (384 – 383 BC) and by the Greek historian Diodorus Siculus (80 – 29 BC), initiated by conflicts between the Greek colonists and the indigenous Hvar islanders, the Liburnians, who asked their compatriots for support. 10,000 Liburnians sailed out from their capital \"Idassa\" (Zadar), led by the \"Iadasinoi\" (people of Zadar), and laid siege to Pharos. The Syracusan fleet positioned in Issa was informed in time, and Greek triremes attacked the siege fleet, taking victory in the end. According to Diodorus, the Greeks killed more than 5,000 and captured 2,000 prisoners, ran down or captured their ships, and burned their weapons in dedication to their gods.\n\nThis battle meant the loss of the most important strategic Liburnian positions in the centre of the Adriatic, resulting in their final retreat to their main ethnic region, Liburnia, and their complete departure from the Italic coast, apart from Truentum. In Roman times, the town became known as Faria, which was turned into Hvar by the incoming Slav population. When the administrative capital of the island was moved to today's Hvar town on the south coast, the old town became simply known as Stari Grad. (\"Stari\" translates as \"old\" and \"grad\" as \"city\" in Croatian.)\n\nThe municipality of Stari Grad has a population of 2,781 (2011 Census), of which 1,885 live in the town itself. Four other settlements fall within the municipality, namely Dol (Pop. 311), Rudina (Pop. 70), Selca Kod Starog Grada (Pop. 17) and Vrbanj (Pop. 498).\n\nStari Grad lies on the north side of the island of Hvar, at the end of the Stari Grad Bay, a deep water channel, protected to the north by the hills of the Kabal peninsula and by the high mountain ridge of Hvar to the south.\n\nThe island's best agricultural land opens up to the east of Stari Grad town. This fertile plain has been farmed since pre-historic times, and the Greek field layout is still largely intact, thanks to continuing maintenance over the years of its dry stone walls. In 2008, the Stari Grad Plain became a UNESCO protected world heritage site.\n\nThe area around present day Stari Grad was settled by the neolithic tribes of the Hvar culture who occupied the island between 3500 and 2500 BC, and who traded with other settlements around the Mediterranean. Remains of their pottery and other artifacts have been found, along with that of the Illyrian tribe that succeeded them. The settlement lay at the lower end of Stari Grad Bay, defended by two strongholds on the north and south hillsides overlooking the harbour (Glavica and Purkin Kuk).\n\nIn 384 BC, the town was formally founded by ancient Greeks from the island of Paros in the Aegean Sea. They gave the name Faros (ΦΑΡΟΣ) to their new settlement, an independent state permitted to mint its own money. The nearby plain was marked out with roads at right angles, and divided into fields of standard size. The Stari Grad Plain today represents one of the best-preserved examples of ancient Greek agriculture throughout the Mediterranean.\n\nIn 218 BC, the Romans defeated the Illyrian army at Pharos during the Second Illyrian War, and the town was destroyed by the Roman army, but remained under Illyrian control. The town came under permanent Roman control by force in 168 BC, following the defeat of Gentius during the Third Illyrian War.\n\nAn inscription from the 2nd century BC, refers to the Farians and their delegation to the Greek island of Paros and the oracle at Delphi. It makes mention of the Roman senate and the people (who are) well disposed and benevolent towards the city of Faros from the times of their ancestors. Further inscriptions, mosaics, tombstones, stone reliefs, fine pottery, jewellery, coins, villae rusticae in the Plain tell the story of life in and around the ancient Roman town.\n\nThe first church was built in the 5th century, in the southeast corner of the town, close to the city walls, on the foundations of a prior Greek house. In the 6th century, a new church was built on the same site, a twin basilica with a baptistry dedicated to St Mary and St John.\n\nIn the 7th century, following the fall of Salona, the capital of the Roman province of Dalmatia, many of its people sought refuge in Faria and other Roman towns in the nearby islands, as noted by the historian Archdeacon Thomas of Split (1200–1268) in his Historia Salonitana.\n\nRoman Faria was taken over by the Slavs at the beginning of the 8th century. At this point, the town received the name we know it by today – \"Hvar\" (the letter F not being part of the old Slavonic alphabet). During the 10th century, Hvar came under the Narentines. Pirates from Omiš on the mainland were raiding the coastal settlements, and new villages grew up in the foothills – Dol, Vrbanj and Pitve.\n\nIn 1278, the people of Hvar chose to put themselves under the protection of the Venetian Republic. As part of the contract, they undertook to expand the existing settlement on the south side of the island as a more suitable base for the Venetian fleet. This is the site of the present day town of Hvar. The old town of Stari Grad, also referred to as “Old Hvar”, remained the centre of the most densely populated part of the island, the area surrounding the agricultural plain.\n\nDuring the 16th century, the town was attacked by the Turks, the first time repulsing them, but in 1571 they lost, and much of the town was burnt down. Following that loss, Stari Grad was slowly rebuilt from the ruins. During the 17th and 18th centuries, prosperity once again grew from sea-trade. The old waterfront (Stara Riva) was extended and the town underwent a major architectural and urban transformation, resulting in the town structure we see today.\n\nIn 1797 Napoleon overthrew the Venetian Republic, and Hvar briefly became part of the Austrian Empire. When the French also took over Austria, they conferred the status of an autonomous province on the town of Stari Grad. With the fall of the Napoleonic Empire, Stari Grad became part of the Dalmatian Kingdom, within the larger political body of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.\n\nThe 19th century was peaceful, and a time of prosperity for the entire island. However, the advent of phylloxera destroyed the island's grapevines, and the town's sailing vessels could not compete with the new steam ships. Large numbers of people moved away to start a new life elsewhere. Today, Stari Grad is again rebuilding itself, this time with tourism as the main focus.\n\n\nThe town itself, and the surrounding area are rich in archaeological sites dating from pre-history and classical times. Permanent exhibitions in the Stari Grad Museum display the collection of artifacts found at local sites, both on land and under the sea.\n\n\nThe present-day Church of St. John, together with the archaeological remains found south of it, comprises an Early Christian complex dating from 5th/6th century. The original walls are preserved up to the beginning of the barrel vault that was built during the restoration in the early Romanesque period (11th century). The church floor was decorated with geometrical and figural details of which some are preserved. In the interior is original Early Christian altar. The large rosette on the facade is from the Gothic-era adaptation of the church in the 14th century.\n\nThe Church of St. Rocco, patron of Stari Grad, was raised by the confraternity of the same name, with provisions by the poet and nobleman Petar Hektorović in the 16th century. The bell tower was added in 1783 and side chapels in 1898. The main altar is the work of Andrija Bruttapela from 1774; it is decorated with statue of St. Rocco made by unidentified Venetian workshop. St. Rocco is shown with a dog that was a faithful friend after he was abandoned by everyone. In 1898 the mosaic floor of ancient Roman baths was unearthed beneath the stairs. The place is marked with Latin inscription on one of the steps.\n\nThe Dominican monastery of St. Peter the Martyr was founded, with help of townspeople, by friar Germanicus of Piacenza in 1482. The church and the monastery were ransacked and burned by the Turks in 1571 and after that the monastery was fortified with round towers. The church was partially demolished and built anew in 1894. All that remained from the old church is the bell tower and the chapel with the tomb of the Renaissance poet Petar Hektorović. The monastery museum host the oldest Greek inscriptions from Pharos (4th century BC). The picture gallery has a number of valuable paintings of Venetian artists such as the famous \"The Lamentation of Christ\" by Tintoretto (1518–1594).\n\nNotable inhabitants and persons with the origin from Stari Grad.\n\nThere are numerous bays on each side of Stari Grad Bay. One of the largest bays is Tiha, located on the northern side. Tiha is a perfect anchoring point as it is safe, and sheltered from all winds (the name Tiha translates to silent/calm). Zavala is a slightly smaller bay, but equally calm, with plenty of anchoring spots. The other side (south side) of Stari Grad bay, is quite higher, and offers smaller bays with hills meters away from the beach. Gracisce is one of those bays, with a pebble covered beach, and a thick pine forest just meters above. Closer to the city on the southern side there are a few beautiful beaches, such as the small sandy Maslinica bay. One more worth mentioning is Arkada, located underneath the hotel of the same name on the northern side, with a calm space for anchoring nearby.\n\n"}

Being present on land as a trespasser thereto creates liability in the trespasser, so long as the trespass is intentional. At the same time, the status of a visitor as a trespasser (as opposed to an invitee or a licensee) defines the legal rights of the visitor if they are injured due to the negligence of the property owner.\n\nThe tort of trespass to land requires an intentional physical invasion of the plaintiff's real property by the defendant or a refusal to leave when ordered to leave.\n\nFor example, a person walking in a public park who trips and rolls down a hill will not be liable for trespass just because the bottom of the hill is on private land.\n\nThe trespasser need not enter the land in person. Indeed, if A and B are standing next to C's land, and A pushes B onto the land without entering it himself, it is A (and not B, who did not intend to enter that space) who is liable for the trespass to C's land. There must be some physical entry, however. Causing noise, light, odors, or smoke to enter the land of another is not a trespass, but is instead a different tort, nuisance.\n\nFor purposes of determining liability, the landowner's property rights extend above and below the land to as much distance as the landowner can beneficially use. Even a low-flying plane can trespass if it enters this usable space.\n\nA constructive trespass occurs when a person who has permission to be on the land overstays their welcome. A person who stays in a business after its closing time, or who goes to a dinner party but refuses to leave long after the other guests have gone home, is a trespasser despite his initially proper presence. Furthermore, a guest's status as a trespasser arises as soon as he resists when the property owner tells him to leave the property. This is not a constructive trespass if the guest is unconscious.\n\nAs a broad general rule, property owners owe few duties to trespassers to safeguard them from injuries that may occur on their property. \n\nWith respect to the duties owed to trespassers, there are two types of trespassers to consider:\n\nFor injury claims by trespassers, the concept of traps was narrowly defined. More recently, courts in some jurisdictions have engaged in some creativity, adopting a broader interpretation of a trap.\n\nA warning sign at the entrance to the land is generally sufficient to warn trespassers of possible hazards on a property or land. However, a property owner is under no duty to ascertain hazards on his property for the benefit of trespassers, and cannot be held liable for failing to discover a previously unknown hazard that injures a trespasser.\n\nIn some jurisdictions an adult trespasser who is injured while on a defendant's property cannot sue under a theory of strict liability, even if the landowner was engaged in ultrahazardous activities, such as the keeping of wild animals, or the use of explosives. Instead, the trespasser must prove that the property owner intentionally or wantonly injured the plaintiff to recover.\n\nSome jurisdictions extend additional protections to children who trespass on the properly of others. For example, if there is a potentially hazardous object or condition on the land that might be attractive to young children, the trespass may be deemed \"anticipated\" under the doctrine of attractive nuisance such that the child may be able to succeed with an injury claim.\n\nIn some regions of the world, a property owner may use reasonable (typically meaning non-deadly) force to prevent a person from trespassing on their land, or to expel a trespasser. However, a property owner may be restricted from expelling a trespasser if doing so would expose the trespasser to a risk of serious injury. For example, a trespasser who takes shelter in a stranger's barn during a powerful storm cannot be expelled until the storm is over.\n\nMany jurisdictions within the United States have passed statutes to modify or clarify the common law duties owed by a property owner to a trespasser (for example, by explicitly permitting the property owner to use deadly force to expel trespassers).\n\n"}

Opened in 1919, it was the oldest operating GM plant when it was largely idled in December 2008, and ceased all remaining production on April 23, 2009. The demolition of the plant began in April 2018.\n\nThe plant covers 4,800,000 square feet (446,000 m³). It employed around 7,000 workers at its peak in 1970, but was down to about 1,200 when it ceased production of GM vehicles in December 2008.\n\nIn 1918, the Samson Tractor division of General Motors was formed from the merger of Samson Tractor of California and the Janesville Machine Company, a farm implement manufacturer. A Samson Tractor Division plant employing 3,000 workers was opened in Janesville in 1919, with the first tractor produced on May 1, 1919. A farm depression that started in 1920 forced Samson to curtail production and lay off more than 1,000 workers. Samson eventually went bankrupt. Although General Motors wanted to abandon the Janesville plant, its general manager, Joseph A. Craig, convinced the company to stay, and in 1920 GM transferred its truck production from Flint, Michigan to the Janesville plant.\n\nChevrolet began producing automobiles at the plant in 1923. In the same year, an adjacent Fisher Body plant began construction. Production at the factory was halted during the Great Depression for about a year. In 1937 union organizers led a sit-down strike, part of a nationwide series of strikes at GM, which quickly resulted in a national contract. During World War II, the Janesville plants were taken over by General Motors' Oldsmobile Division, and produced artillery.\n\nProduction of automobiles resumed following the war. In 1953, a second shift was added to both the Chevrolet and the Fisher Body factories. In April 1967, the 100 millionth GM vehicle was produced at the Chevrolet plant.\n\nIn 1969, the Chevrolet and Fisher Body factories joined to form the General Motors Assembly Division. Peak production at the Janesville Assembly occurred in 1977, when there were 7,100 employees, and 274,286 cars and 114,681 trucks were produced.\n\nIn the 1980s General Motors moved large car production from Janesville and started making subcompact J-cars, such as the Chevrolet Cavalier. In 1987 the company moved Janesville's pickup line to the Fort Wayne, Indiana assembly plant. Local efforts resulted in GM moving medium-duty truck and full-size sport-utility production from plants in Michigan to Janesville. By 1992 it was the only GM plant manufacturing large SUVs. In 2002 GM returned Janesville's medium-duty truck production to Flint, Michigan.\n\nMost recently the Janesville Assembly built full-size SUVs. It was one of three plants producing the GMT900 trucks, such as the Chevrolet Suburban. It began building the next-generation short-wheelbase GMT900 trucks in January 2006 and the long-wheelbase GMT900 trucks in March of that year and an overtime shift was added to meet demand. From 1994 until 2009, the plant also produced medium-duty trucks for Isuzu under its partnership with GM.\n\nIn 2006, the Janesville GM Assembly plant achieved a milestone of producing more than 500,000 full-size sport utility vehicles with E85 FlexFuel capable engines. The Janesville employees were recognized in a ceremony at the plant that included Wisconsin Governor Jim Doyle (D).\n\nIn 2007, discussion of greenhouse gas fuel emissions regulations sparked a dialogue about the future of the Janesville GM plant. That same year United Auto Workers Local 95 participated in a strike at the facility.\n\nIn 2008, fuel prices, the related slow sales of SUVs, and the economy resulted in GM cutting back full-time production at the Janesville plant to a single shift. Combined with an ongoing employee buy-out program, layoffs totaled around 750 jobs in July 2008. During GM's annual shareholder meeting on June 3, 2008, CEO Rick Wagoner announced that the Janesville assembly plant would close by 2010, along with three other GM factories, and could close sooner if the market dictated. The cutbacks announced, along with other changes, were expected to save the North American division $1 billion per year starting in 2010. GM extended its annual summer shutdown an additional two weeks and planned another ten weeks of shutdown for the remainder of 2008 because of excess inventories of SUVs made at the plant.\nIn October 2008, GM announced that the production of SUVs at the Janesville Assembly would end December 23, 2008. On that day workers gathered at a ceremony with a banner reading \"Last Vehicle off the Janesville Assembly Line\". The last GM vehicle produced, a black 2009 Chevrolet Tahoe, was donated to the United Way of North Rock County, which raffled the vehicle off.\n\n57 production employees continued assembly work at the Janesville Assembly until April 23, 2009, completing the GM/Isuzu light truck partnership and then an additional 40 to 50 \"skilled trade employees\" worked to decommission the plant.\n\nGeneral Motors placed the factory on standby until at least 2015 when the company and employee unions negotiate a new contract. The factory was one of three — along with Orion Assembly and Spring Hill Manufacturing - that General Motors kept on standby during their bankruptcy. It was the only one still on standby status in 2014. The factory can only be completely closed by agreement of both General Motors and the United Automobile Workers.\n\nAs of January 2016, GM had signed a new contract with the United Auto Workers that cleared the way for selling the Janesville plant. Water or ground contamination on the north and south sides of the plant have delayed the sale of the plant. GM was working with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources to clean up that area. As of February 2016, GM was working with CBRE Group of Los Angeles to market the 250 acre site (excluding the contaminated area on the north side of the site) on a global market, hoping to have a buyer by 2017.\n\nDemolition of the plant began in 2018. \n\n\nList of GM factories\n\n\n"}

He served in the New York State Assembly and as a delegate for New York to the Confederation Congress.\n\nPhilip was born to the aristocratic Pell family, at the manor house in what is now Pelham. The family had established itself in the area in 1654 when Thomas Pell bought nearly 10,000 acres (40 km²) from the Indians. Thomas' nephew John, named the entire tract \"Pelham Manor\", and was viewed as the second lord of the manor. Philip was the third to have that name, and is sometimes known as Philip Pell, Jr. or Philip Pell, III.\n\nPell graduated from King's College (now Columbia University) in New York City in 1770. He read law, was admitted to the bar, and practiced in Westchester County and New York City. As the Revolutionary War began, he was a Lieutenant in the Westchester militia. His unit became part of the Continental Army in 1776. He served through 1779, when elected to the New York State Assembly.\n\nAfter one term in the Assembly, Pell rejoined the Continental Army, this time as a Colonel. He served as Judge Advocate General from 1781 until 1783, and was a member of General George Washington's staff at the evacuation of the city of New York in 1783 when the British advanced on the city. After leaving the army again, Pell resumed his political career, serving once more in the State Assembly and then as a New York delegate to the final session of the Confederation Congress (1788–1789). When the confederation Congress met for the last time on March 2, 1789, two days before the federal government began operations under the new Constitution, Pell and the Congress' secretary were the only ones present. Their only action that day was to adjourn Congress \"sine die\".\n\nAn active and vocal Anti-Federalist who opposed the new frame of government, Pell subsequently withdrew from national and state politics. He did keep his local office as the surrogate for Westchester County until 1800.\n\nPhilip died at Pelhamdale in Pelham Manor in 1811 and is buried the St. Paul's Churchyard, in what is now part of the City of Mount Vernon, a suburb of New York City.\n\n"}

Since then, over 25,000 individuals have held awards, hosted by over twenty countries. The CSFP is one of the primary mechanisms of pan-Commonwealth exchange.\n\nThere is no central body which manages the CSFP. Instead, participation is based on a series of bi-lateral arrangements between home and host countries. The participation of each country is organised by a national nominating agency, which is responsible for advertising awards applicable to their own country and making nominations to host countries.\n\nIn the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, which is the biggest contributor to the Plan, this process is managed by the Commonwealth Scholarship Commission in Britain, a non-departmental public body, and funded by the Department for International Development. Since 2008, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office no longer contributes financially to the plan and the number and type of scholarships available for students from more developed Commonwealth countries (Australia, The Bahamas, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Cyprus, Malta, New Zealand, and Singapore) to study in Britain has been reduced.. Other countries, such as Australia, no longer offer scholarships as part of the CSFP.\n\nNew reforms were developed to strategically align scholarships with mutual interests for business and innovation between Commonwealth nations. During the state visit of President Tony Tan to the UK in October 2014, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II announced that the Royal Commonwealth Society of Singapore would be re-established to promote the Commonwealth and to provide new Commonwealth Scholarships and Fellowships in Innovation for Singaporeans. The first Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship for Innovation were presented in August 2017 to Joshua Cheong and Dr Khoo Hsien Hui by the Rt. Hon. Sajid Javid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2044602", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2044602", "title": "Pajarito Plateau", "text": "Pajarito Plateau\n\nThe Pajarito Plateau is a volcanic plateau in north central New Mexico, United States. The plateau, part of the Jemez Mountains, is bounded on the west by the Valles Caldera and on the east by the White Rock Canyon of the Rio Grande. The plateau is occupied by several notable entities, including Bandelier National Monument, the town of Los Alamos and its remote suburb White Rock, and Los Alamos National Laboratory. Elevations range from about 5600 feet (1700 meters) at the river to about 7800 feet (2300 meters) where the plateau merges into the mountain range. \nThe Pajarito Plateau is primarily composed of ignimbrite, a voluminous deposit of volcanic tuff laid down in an explosive eruption — in this case, a pair of eruptions from the nearby Valles Caldera. The two ignimbrite-forming eruptions occurred about 1.6 million and 1.2 million years ago and ejected about 300 cubic kilometers of rock each. The orange-pink rock formations constituting the resulting ignimbrites are known as the Otowi and Tshirege Members of the Bandelier tuff. The tuff lies on top of a volcanic field, exposed to the east, which used to be continuous with the Caja del Rio (now across the Rio Grande).\nErosion has created a maze of canyons up to 800 feet (240 meters) deep that dissect the plateau into mesas. Many of these mesas climb on the western side rather than descending on all sides, thus sometimes are referred to as potreros. Rock climbing is popular here with locals and visitors alike, and is done in the canyons on basalt cliffs that lie within and below the tuff, which itself is too soft to be climbed safely.\nThe canyons and mesas are highly scenic and well endowed with trails, about which numerous guidebooks have been written. Some trails reach the Rio Grande; others reach the rim of the Valles Caldera. Some are long distance trails, of which a few have been used for ultramarathons and endurance rides. Popular uses include walking, dog walking, running, orienteering and rogaining, mountain biking, and horse riding.\n\nDue to constraints of geography and land ownership, both Los Alamos and White Rock are compact populated places. Outside of these, the plateau is sparsely populated and wildlife is abundant and diverse. A large elk herd that spends summers in the Jemez Mountains descends to the Pajarito Plateau during the winter, creating a significant driving hazard. Deer, black bear and coyote are common, and the plateau and mountains support a small but stable population of mountain lions, which typically flee from humans. Smaller mammals such as raccoons, skunks, and gophers are common. Parts of the Bandelier backcountry have been closed seasonally due to nesting bald eagles. The Rio Grande supports a significant migratory flyway that brings many other birds (notably sandhill cranes) to the plateau during migration seasons, and three species of hummingbirds are abundant during summer. White Rock Canyon, the major canyon containing the Rio Grande into which the plateau's canyons empty, is notorious for rattlesnakes.\n\n"}

Closely related traditions are found throughout the Balkans and Greece (including Romania and the Pontus). The costumes cover most of the body and include decorated wooden masks of animals (sometimes double-faced) and large bells attached to the belt. Around New Year and before Lent, the kukeri walk and dance through villages to scare away evil spirits with their costumes and the sound of their bells. They are also believed to provide a good harvest, health, and happiness to the village during the year.\n\nThe kukeri traditionally visit peoples' houses at night so that \"the sun would not catch them on the road.\" After parading around the village they usually gather at the village square to dance wildly and amuse the people. Kukeri rituals vary by region but remain largely the same in essence.\n\nThe custom is generally thought to be related to the Thracian Dionysos cult in the wider area of Thracia.\nSimilar rituals can be also found in much of the Balkans. \nThe name \"kuker\" has been derived from Latin \"cuculla\" meaning \"hood, cowl\" or \"cucurum\", \"quiver\" (i.e. in the sense of a container; an abbreviation of \"koukouros geros\"). \nAnother theory suggests that the term could be derived from Proto-Slavic (“evil spirit”) with the agentive suffix , i.e. literally meaning a \"chaser of evil spirits\".\n\nThe corresponding figure in Greek-speaking Thrace is known as \"Kalogeros\" \"rod-carrier\", also shortened to \"cuci\", in former Yugoslavia known as \"didi, didici\", in Bulgaria as \"kuker\" or \"babushar\", as \"momogeros\" in Pontic Anatolia. In Romania, this figure mostly appears together with a goat, known as \"capra\", \"turca\" or \"brezaia\".\n\nKukeri is a divinity personifying fecundity, sometimes in Bulgaria and Serbia it is a plural divinity. In Bulgaria, a ritual spectacle of spring (a sort of carnival) takes place after a scenario of folk theatre, in which Kuker's role is interpreted by a man attired in a sheep- or goat-pelt, wearing a horned mask and girded with a large wooden phallus. During the ritual, various physiological acts are interpreted, including the sexual act, as a symbol of the god's sacred marriage, while the symbolical wife, appearing pregnant, mimes the pains of giving birth. This ritual inaugurates the labours of the fields (ploughing, sowing) and is carried out with the participation of numerous allegorical personages, among which is the Emperor and his entourage.\n\nCapra comes from the Latin capra, meaning goat. A halo like head piece was worn as a crown to symbolize the spiritual divine realm. While animal fur, bird feathers and the sort were worn to symbolize nature. The fact that nature has good and evil, and that humans are the intermediary between spirit and nature. It was a time to pay homage to the Spieth gods. Some cultures imbibed in human flesh to satiate the gods thirst for blood, as an act of solidarity for the gods.\n\nKukeri or Kuker Warriors are some of the main characters in the epic fantasy animated series \"The Golden Apple\", which is currently being developed by Studio Zmei. In it, young brothers Bran and Vlad have been trained as Kuker Warriors to fight evil spirits but they have to question what they have been taught when they are forced to team up with half-spirit Vihra and Samodiva-spirit Tina in order to protect their world.\n\nKukeri are featured in the music video for the song \"Fish on\", by the industrial metal band Lindemann, and in the film \"Toni Erdmann\", directed by Maren Ade.\n\n\n"}

Based on research and interviews with several scientists, the miniseries shows how life could evolve in the future if humans were to disappear from the Earth altogether through extinction. The version broadcast on Animal Planet and the Discovery Channel modified this premise, supposing instead that the human species had completely abandoned the Earth and had sent back probes to examine the progress of life on the planet as time progressed. The show styled itself after the format of a nature documentary. It is narrated by Tim White in the Animal Planet version.\n\nThe miniseries was released with a companion book written by geologist Dougal Dixon, the author of several speculative evolution books, or \"anthropologies and zoologies of the future\" (such as \"\"), in conjunction with natural history television producer John Adams. For a time in 2005, a theme park based on this program was opened in Japan. In 2008 a special on the Discovery Channel about the development of the video game \"Spore\" was combined with airings of \"The Future Is Wild\".\n\nA documentary film version of the series was originally set to be picked up by Warner Bros., however, the series may be rebooted by production company Vanguard Animation and broadcasting at HBO.\n\nTwelve ecosystems were presented, four in each of the three future periods.\n\nThe early episodes describe a world after an ice age, when giant sea-birds roam the beaches and carnivorous bats rule the skies. Ice sheets extend as far south as Paris in the northern hemisphere and as far north as Buenos Aires in the southern hemisphere. The Amazon rainforest has dried up and become grassland. The North American plains have become a cold desert, and Africa has collided with Europe, enclosing the Mediterranean Sea. Without water to replace it in the dry climate, the Mediterranean has dried out into a salt flat dotted with brine lakes, as it has been in the past. Most of Europe is a frozen tundra. The part of Africa east of the African Rift Valley has broken away from the rest of the continent. Asia has dried up and is now mountainous. The once warm, tropical area of Central America has been transformed into a dry area. Australia has moved north and collided with eastern Indonesia.\n\nIn the scenario for 100 million years in the future, the world is much hotter than at present. Octopuses and enormous tortoises have come on to the land, much of which is flooded by shallow seas surrounded by brackish swamps. Antarctica has drifted towards the tropics and is covered with dense rainforests, as it was before. Australia has collided with North America and Asia, forcing up an enormous, 12-kilometre-high mountain plateau much taller than the modern Himalayas. Greenland has been reduced to a small, temperate island. There are cold, deep ocean trenches. The Sahara has once again become the rich grassland it was millions of years ago.\n\nThe hypothetical world of 200 million years from now is recovering from a mass extinction caused by a flood basalt eruption even larger than the one that created the Siberian Traps, wiping out 99% of the species on the planet. Fish have taken to the skies, squid to the forests, and the world's largest-ever desert is filled with strange worms and insects. All the continents have collided with one another and fused into a single supercontinent, a second Pangaea. (A few present-day geographical features can still be discerned, including Hudson Bay, Novaya Zemlya and the Scandinavian Peninsula, as well as the general outline of Africa.) One large global ocean with a single-current system gives rise to deadly hurricanes called hypercanes, which batter the coastlines of the continent all year long. The northwestern side of Pangaea II, drenched with an endless supply of rain, has become a temperate forest. Mountains resting at the end of the coast prevent most of the rain's moisture from reaching a long line of scrubby rainshadow deserts. The very center of the continent receives no rain at all and has become a barren, plantless desert. Only fish, arthropods, worms and mollusks were left to repopulate the Earth.\n\nEach episode generally focuses on just one food chain within a particular ecosystem.\n\n\"The Future is Wild\" is a £5-million co-production of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), the Franco-German channel Arte, the German ZDF, the Austrian ORF, the Italian Mediaset, and Animal Planet and Discovery Channels Inc of the United States.\n\nThe BBC intended that the miniseries would repeat the success it had with its prehistoric documentary series \"Walking With Dinosaurs\", which attracted 17 million viewers in 1999. The program used computer-generated imagery to show the possible future of life on Earth. The 13-part series was produced in four years by independent producer John Adams, who conceived it in 1997.\n\nScientists involved in the project include the following:\n\n\"The Future is Wild\" doubled the previous ratings record for the Animal Planet channel when it was aired in the United States. The series was shown on BBC2 in late 2004.\n\nZDF Enterprises sold the television rights of the series to 18 markets: Belgium, Canada, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Ecuador, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Hungary, Japan, Korea, Mexico, the Middle East, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovenia and Venezuela.\n\nThe series was released on three DVDs: episodes 1–5, episodes 6–9 and episodes 10–13. The three DVDs have also been released together as a set. Both the single DVDs and the three-DVD set are available for DVD regions one and two.

{"id": "2044627", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2044627", "title": "Hvar (city)", "text": "Hvar (city)\n\nHvar (local Croatian dialect: \"Hvor\" or \"For\", Greek: \"Pharos\", and \"Pharina\", ) is a city and port on the island of Hvar, part of Split-Dalmatia County, Croatia. The municipality has a population of 4,251 (2011) while the city itself is inhabited by 3,771 people, making it the largest settlement on the island of Hvar. It is situated on a bay in the south coast of the island, opposite from the other nearby towns of Stari Grad and Jelsa.\n\nThe city of Hvar has a long and distinguished history as center for trade and culture in the Adriatic. A commune part of the Venetian Empire during the 13th to 18th centuries, it was an important naval base with a strong fortress above, encircling town walls and protected port. Cultural life thrived as prosperity grew, and Hvar is the site of one of the oldest surviving theatres in Europe, opened in 1612. The seven-hundred-year-old walls still survive, as do many of the noble houses and public buildings from 15th – 17th centuries.\n\nBy the 19th century, the port of Hvar was no longer a military base, and The Hygienic Society of Hvar (Higijeničko društvo u Hvaru), celebrating 150 years in 2018, took the economy of the city and the island in a new direction. As one of the earliest \"tourist boards\" in Europe, it was founded in 1868 with the purpose of providing \"good care for visitors\". Today, the city has a variety of hotels, galleries, museums, and exhibitions, including the Arsenal, Loggia, the Croatian Institute, and the Hvar Heritage Museum with its art and archaeological collections.\n\nThe port of Hvar, set in a picturesque natural bay, with the Pakleni Otoci island chain protecting it to the south, is a safe haven for boats year round. The city is a popular port of call for yachts sailing around the Adriatic, especially in the summer months. There are regular catamaran ferry services from the port between Hvar and Split, Brač, Korčula, Lastovo, and Vis.\n\nThe municipality of Hvar covers 7,535 ha, including the town itself and the settlements of Brusje (pop. 194), Jagodna (pop. 30), Velo Grablje (pop. 7), Milna (pop. 104), Zaraće (pop. 14) and Sveta Nedilja (pop. 131). The old settlements of Malo Grablje and Zaraće are no longer inhabited. Population figures from the 2011 Census.\n\nThe town is located in a small bay on the south coast of the island of Hvar, towards the western end. The surrounding land is karst hillside, rising steeply from the Adriatic Sea. The rocks in the area are porous, mainly limestone and dolomite, so ground water is scarce. However, there is some agriculture where the terrain is sufficiently accessible, and can be irrigated, such as olive groves, vineyards, lavender, and rosemary.\n\nThe mountain range that stretches the length of the island acts as an effective barrier between Hvar town and the settlements to the north. In centuries past, it would have taken several hours to walk overland, or sail around the coast. The modern Stari Grad to Hvar road, with its new tunnel which was opened in the year 2000, now provides quick and easy access between the north and south.\n\nThe coastline is mostly steep and indented, with small gravel beaches in the bays. The Pakleni Otoci and the island of Galešnik at the entrance to the port of Hvar are protected landscape areas.\n\nHvar town enjoys a sunny Mediterranean climate, typical of the southern Adriatic, with mild wet winters and hot dry summers. During June to September, the average temperature is higher than , dropping below in just two months of the year (January and February). Winter days see highs between and lows from . Daytime high temperatures in the summer months range from and from for the overnight lows. During the summer, the westerly mistral wind blows through the Pakleni channel, providing welcome cooling during the day. Rain is rare here during spring and summer, though plentiful in autumn and winter months. Light snow occurs on average once every ten years, however, it does not stay on the ground long.\n\nThe average monthly temperature of the sea, from June through October, is . It is not unusual for the sea temperature to reach more than . The sea is always warmer than the air, except during the summer months. The current usually comes from the south-east.\n\nThe earliest known settlement on the site of today's Hvar town was Illyrian, lying on the hill slopes to the north side of the town square, which was then a small bay that came up to where the cathedral now stand, moreover (Ben) the cathedral is entirely surrounded by streets which resemble that of a block system common to American and Roman roads. On the site of the present Spanish Fortress stood a hillfort, the importance of which can be seen in the pottery from the site, indicating long-distance trade from the eighth century B.C. onwards.\nThe ancient Greeks founded the settlement of Faros (384 BC) on the north of the island, from where they could control the fertile agricultural area, now known as the Stari Grad Plain. It has been proposed that there was concurrently a second Greek settlement called Heraclea, on the site of today's Hvar town.\n\nWith the arrival of the Ancient Romans around 2nd century BC, settlement on the island was expanded. Colonisation was mainly rural, based around Roman villas (villae rusticae). During the 7th–8th centuries, the Slavs arrived on the island. At this time, life on the coast was not safe due to raiding pirates, and the inhabitants moved inland. By the Medieval period, the population was gathered in villages well away from the coast for safety.\n\nFollowing this unsettled period, the islanders asked the Venetian Empire for protection (1278). As part of the agreement, the southern settlement of Hvar was to be expanded and fortified as a safe base for the Venetian fleet. As the new administrative centre, the town assumed the name of \"Lesina\" (Hvar), and the ancient Greek town became known as \"Cittavecchia\" (Stari Grad, \"literally Old Town\"). Hvar became the centre of the independent commune government, the residence of the prince, and the base of the new diocese (consisting of Hvar, and the neighbouring islands of Brač, and Vis). The Venetians commissioned the construction of a new fortress, town walls, public buildings, and with the new prosperity, villages were gradually established along the nearby coastline.\n\nBy the 15th century, the town had become too confined within the old walls, so settlement extended onto the hill to the south. The medieval town was bounded to the east by the cathedral and to the west by the Arsenal, the Governor's Palace and marina. During this time, Hvar was the centre of the economic, political and cultural life on the island, and played an important role in Venetian shipping.\n\nThe 16th century was a return to more unsettled times, with persistent conflicts between the nobles and citizens, and repeated attacks from the Ottoman Empire, now occupying the mainland. In 1571 Hvar was sacked by the Turkish fleet on its way to the Battle of Lepanto, and only the fortress saved the townspeople. Just as the town was being rebuilt, it suffered further damage in 1579 as lightning struck the gunpowder magazine in the fortress. Many of today's public buildings in Hvar date from the reconstruction following the explosion.\n\nIn 1776, the Venetians moved their naval base to Kotor on the mainland, and the town of Hvar went into a decline. In summary, Hvar was part of the dominion of the Republic of Venice from 1278 to 1358 and again from 1420 to 1797, the year in which Napoleon took control of Venice. After a brief period under the French Empire, Hvar came under the Austrian Habsburg Empire in the early part of the 19th century, a period of exceptional economic and cultural life for the town. In 1868, \"The Hygienic Association of Hvar\" was founded, to promote the development of tourist services.\nThe town of Hvar is first and foremost a maritime port. Its location at the center of shipping routes in the Adriatic – both east–west and north–south – make it an ideal base for operations. In previous times, the fleets were the Venetian navy, or merchant traders from round the Mediterranean, North Africa and the Black Sea, even as far afield as up the Atlantic coast. Nowadays, the fleets are yachts, from sailboat charters to high-end luxury cruisers. The marina hosts a number of events year-round, including a New Year regatta.\n\nHvar is a popular destination for vacationers, especially during the summer season. There are a number of hotels in town, art galleries, museums, theatres, street cafes, and night clubs.\n\nHvar has a rich cultural tradition. Along with independent Dubrovnik, Hvar was an important centre of early Croatian literature, as well as for architecture, sculpture, painting and music. Well-known Croatian cultural figures such as Hanibal Lucić, Petar Hektorović, Vinko Pribojević, Mikša Pelegrinović, Martin Benetović and Marin Gazarović lived and worked on Hvar in the 16th and 17th centuries. The oldest recorded performances were ecclesiastical pageants, such as the Pageant of St. Lovrinac (Laurence) the Martyr, from the 15th century. In the early 16th century Hanibal Lučić wrote Robinja (The Slave Girl), the first piece of Croatian drama. Benetović's comedies followed, then the secular and ecclesiastical pageants of Marin Gazarović, and other works. Hvar's Theatre is one of the oldest in Europe, built in 1612. A lively theatrical tradition continued into the 19th century, especially at carnival time, when musical and theatrical performances were staged and masquerades (or cavalchins) were organized. Many national and international actors and musicians have performed here over the years, and continue to do so.\n\nCultural and artistic events within the Hvar Summer Festival take place throughout the summer, from late June to late September. These events include classical music concerts performed by national and international artists, and performances by amateur groups from Hvar. Performances are given nearly every day in a number of venues around the town.\n\nThe Gallery of Modern Art in Hvar is located in the Arsenal building, in the lobby of the historic Theatre. The permanent display contains the most valuable paintings, sculptures and prints from the collection, and temporary exhibitions are organised within the Museum project Summer of Fine Arts in Hvar. Other galleries, such as Lođa, Zvijezda Mora, Anuncijata, and Skorpion also host special exhibitions, and museums offer archaeological and historical displays.\n\nThe Hvar branch of the Croatian Institute has regularly organised cultural and artistic events, classical music concerts, exhibitions (Hvar Visual Arts Moment) and lectures by well-known Croatian artists and scientists. These events usually take place in the last week of July.\n\nHvar town is a protected Cultural Heritage area, as are the rural areas of Velo Grablje, Malo Grablje and Zaraće. In addition, there are five archaeological sites in the area: the hydro-archaeological site of Palmižana, villa rustica Soline, the prehistoric site of Vira, and the prehistoric Lompić fort in the Gračišće Bay.\n\nHvar Town is encircled on its land-side by protective walls, and overlooked by two massive fortresses set on the hills above. The fortifications were commissioned by the Venetians in 1278, to create a haven for their fleet, and have been expanded in the centuries since. Within the walls, the public buildings and palaces combine Venetian architectural style, with a distinct local flavour in materials and workmanship. Much of the old town survives intact, in both layout and architecture, though more modern housing has developed in the surrounding areas.\n\nThe town walls date from the 13th century and, with later additions and renovations, stretch from the fortress down to the square where they join the third wall in an east–west direction. This wall is practically camouflaged by a series of patrician houses built into it. The walls are interspersed with four-cornered side towers, the construction of which lasted, with essential repairs, from the 13th to the 16th century. The current fortress Fortica, also known as Tvrđava Španjola (\"Spanish Fort\") was constructed following the gunpowder explosion in 1579 which devastated the old fortress. Today, the fortress includes a modern tourist complex, and provides a superb view of the town and its surroundings. In 1811, during the rule of the Napoleonic Empire, a second fortress Trđava Napoleon was constructed on the higher hill to the northeast. The site now also houses an observatory.\n\nAt the heart of the town lies the Pjaca (\"Piazza\"), leading from the waterfront to the cathedral. This town square is the largest in Dalmatia at , and was fully paved in 1780 when this section of the original bay was filled in. Buildings around the Pjaca are 15th to 17th century, including the Bishop's Palace, the Arsenal, the Governor's Palace and other public buildings. The city well in the middle of the square, dates from 1520.\n\nThe Arsenal building faces the waterfront on the south-west corner of the Pjaca. In its present form, the building dates from the reconstruction of the earlier 13th-century warehouse in 1579–1611. Beside the Arsenal is the arched façade of the Fontik, a communal store for cereals and salt. In 1612, Hvar Theatre was built on the first floor of the Arsenal, with entry from the Belvedere terrace above Fontik. The present-day interior – the stage and auditorium with boxes – dates from a major renovation in 1803, when the Theatre Association was founded. Two historical set designs from the 19th century have been preserved and can be seen on the back wall of the stage. \nThe Arsenal building is currently under renovation ()\n\nThe Cathedral of Sv. Stjepan (St. Stephen) and the Bishop's Palace mark the eastern end of the Pjaca. This was the site of an earlier church and medieval Benedictine monastery, which became a cathedral when the Bishopric of Hvar was moved from Stari Grad in the 13th century. The present cathedral was built in stages during the 16th and 17th centuries, while the interior was not completed until the 18th century. It has a Renaissance-baroque style, and a façade with three-cornered gable and a Renaissance Bell Tower in Romanesque style from the 16th century. The sanctuary of the nave is the nave of the former Gothic church: the two pulpits, the stone polyptych with \"The Altar of the Apostles\", and reliefs \"The Scourging of Christ\" and the \"Annunciation\", from the workshop of Juraj Dalmatinac in the 15th century. There are eleven baroque altars, created by Venetian artists.\n\nOn the northern side of the Pjaca are many renaissance buildings, such as the Paladini Palace, and the unfinished Hektorovic Palace (Gothic, 15th century).\n\nThe town Loza (\"Loggia\") lies at the western end of the Pjaca, looking out on to the bay. Together with Leroj (\"Clock Tower\"), the Loggia is the only remains of the former Governor's Palace. The Communal Loggia (loggia communis) was first mentioned as early as in the 13th century and referred to again in the Statute of Hvar in 1331. The only remains of the Governor's Palace are two reliefs of the Venetian lion, a large well and a lintel from the Palace chapel dating from 1612. The new Loggia, one of the most beautiful Late Renaissance buildings in Dalmatia, was the work of the master Tripun Bokanić in the 16th century. Today, the interior of the loggia is decorated in a neo-Renaissance style and serves as a reception hall and exhibition room for the Hotel Palace, and also for the town of Hvar.\n\nA small enclosed marina Mandrać lies at the west side of the Pjaca, and is mentioned for the first time in 1459. In 1795 the Venetian District Governor Marco Dandalo finished the building of Mandrac by putting Baroque pyramids on the walls around it. The stone paved quay, called Fabrika, is one of the oldest in Europe, dating from 1554. \nOn the cape to the south of the town lies the Franciscan Monastery with a church of Our Lady of Mercy, built in the late 15th century. Hanibal Lucić's grave is under the main altar in the church. The cloister, with its monumental rounded arches with a well in the middle, dominates the whole of the Renaissance monastery. The bell tower, in Renaissance style, is the work of an artist from Korčula.\n\nLjetnikovac Hanibal Lucića (\"Hanibal Lucić's Summer Residence\") lies in the fields outside the town walls, to the east. Built in 1530, it is a fine example of a Renaissance country house with enclosed garden and outbuilding. Currently a museum.\n\nThe first Arsenal was built between 1292 and 1331 and it was used as a shipyard for galleys. New Arsenal was built at the same place in the 16th century but shortly after it was burnt down by the Turks in 1571. During duke Pietro Semitecolo's time, in 1611 Arsenal was renovated and expanded when it got its present look. Fontik (grain warehouse) was built in 1612 along the northern front of the Arsenal and also a big terrace above it, called Belvedere, from which the theatre, founded the same year, was entered. It was the first public theatre in Europe.\n\nChurch of St. Veneranda was built in 1561 by the Venetian authorities to serve Greek Catholic sailors in the service of the Venetian Republic. Alongside the Greek Catholic altar, another Catholic altar was raised in 1685 and dedicated to St. Francis. During the Russian invasion on Hvar in 1807 the monastery and the church were damaged. In 1811 the French invaders turned the monastery into a fort. In the mid-19th century the complex was sold to the renowned natural scientist Grgur Bučić, who founded one of the first weather stations in Croatia in 1858.\n\nThe Gothic-Renaissance Church of the Annunciation was first mentioned in the 14th century. It had an important role in the commoners' revolt in 1510, when it was used as a sort of headquarters of the insurgents. In the nearby street, insurgents swore to kill all the local noblemen which was why the wooden crucifix cried in blood in the house of Bevilaqua on 6 February, according to a legend. The relief of the Annunciation is in the Renaissance lunette above the portal, made under the stylistic influence of Niccolò di Giovanni Fiorentino. The church became a centre of the Brotherhood of the Holy Cross, which is still active.\n\nThe late Gothic Church of the Holy Spirit was built at the end of the 15th century by the Brotherhood of the Holy Spirit at the place of an earlier and smaller church from the 14th century. It was consecrated in 1494. The oldest bell in Hvar dated to 1487 has been preserved in the bell tower. During the French administration (1806–1813) the Brotherhood of the Holy Spirit was abolished. The Brotherhood of St. Nicolas, founded in 1861, succeeded the Brotherhood of the Holy Spirit. An altar piece with the depiction of the Madonna by Padovanino can be seen the church.\n\nStella Maris church was made by the local builders. It was built at the beginning of the 19th century along the old Venetian coast, at the place of an earlier St. Joseph's church. During the French administration the church lost its religious purpose and became a warehouse, but its cult was subsequently restored. The façade has a semicircular gable with Renaissance and Baroque characteristics. Baroque marble altar with sculpture of Our Lady of Comfort is set in the church, originally from the Augustinian church in Hvar.\n\nBuilding of the City Fortress started after 1278 when Hvar came under the Venetian rule. Fortress with the city walls represents a unique defensive system. In 1551 a new fortress was built at the place of the old one and it offered protection to population who had taken refuge there during the Turkish invasion in 1571. Explosion of gunpowder depot caused by thunder considerably damaged the fortress in 1579. It was repaired during the Duke Pietro Semitecolo's time at the beginning of the 17th century by building the Baroque defensive bastions. The last army barracks were built in 1775/76 during the reign of Maria Theresa. Collection of amphorae is located in the fortress.\n\nChurch of St. Mary was built in the 15th century as a single-naved Gothic building, at the place of the earlier chapel of the Holy Cross. Inside the lunette of the main portal is a sculpture of the Madonna with Child, the work of Niccolò di Giovanni Fiorentino, set up in 1465–1471. Northern nave of the church with the Renaissance chapel of the Holy Cross was built in 1536. Inside the church we can see the 16th century altars, choir with Renaissance crucifix (Venetian work from the 16th century) and the grave of the local poet Hanibal Lucić. Matteo Ponzoni's painting \"Last Supper\" is in the reflectory. Library and museum collection are also in the monastery.\n\nCity walls enclose the northern part of the city and they are connected with the Fortica fortress. Their building started in the 13th century and they got the present shape during the 14th and 15th centuries. Top of the walls is fortified with a battlement with merlons, crenels and a walkway. It is reinforced with square towers at several places. Eastern gate is called Porta Badoer. Local name is Gradno vrota which means city gate because as opposed to other gates which connect various parts of the city of Hvar this city gate leads outside the city. City walls have four gates.\n\nOriginally in the defensive system of the city walls, Clock Tower (Leroj) used to belong to the Duke's Palace complex, which was pulled down at the end of the 19th century. A public clock was incorporated into the tower in 1466 by order of the Duke Venier. The bell which is presently on the roof of the tower is from the year 1564 and is decorated with religious motifs.\n\nChapel of St. Nicholas was built at the end of the 14th century or the beginning of the 15th century in the Gothic style, at the place of an earlier Augustinian monastery with a church. Augustinian order was abolished in 1787. During French administration church and monastery were demolished for the most part. Church shrine with a Renaissance arch was preserved and presently it is the Chapel of Our Lady of Sadness. This complex was allotted for the city cemetery in 1849. Western front of the cemetery has a big triangular gable and an iron gate with the year 1879. Central part of graves is at the level of the pavement while on the southern side there are graves with tombstones.\n\nHvar historical Theatre is located on the second floor of the Arsenal building. On the lintel over the entrance door of the theatre is inscribed: ANNO SECVNDO PACIS MDCXII. The year 1612, as the inscription says, was the second year of peace between the confronted sides of the Hvar commune. Auditorium with boxes is dated to the year 1803 when the Theatre Society was founded. Present neo-Baroque appearance dates back to the middle of the 19th century. Two wall scenographies were preserved, fresco from 1819 is still at the back wall of the stage. Fresco from approximately 1900 depicting Duke's Palace was restored and set on large movable boards.\n\nMonastery and the Church of St. Mark were first mentioned in 1312 and present remains date from the 16th and 17th century. Dominican Vinko Pribojević held his famous speech \"On the Origin and Glory of the Slavs\" in this church in 1525. In former triple-naved building there are graves of local families from the 15th to the 18th century, and the church was also used for the City Council meetings. Monastery was abolished in 1811 during the French administration. Apse of the church was turned into a chapel in the end of the 19th century.\n\nThe Benedictine Convent has been located here since 1664, originally in the residential complex of the poet Hanibal Lucić's family, which was left by his daughter-in law in her will to the Benedictines in 1591. Next to the convent is the Baroque church of St. Antony the Abbot and John the Baptist from the 17th century and the convent collection of arts and lace made of agave threads which nuns have been making from the 19th century and which is inscribed in the UNESCO's List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.\n\nThe lower Paladini palace was built by the galley commander and knight Nikola Paladini in the floral Gothic style at the end of the 15th century. In 1870, the owner, doctor Dominik Gazzari changed the façade and the palace got its present look in the 19th century on the basis of Vičenco Kovačević's design. The ground floor and the disposition of windows on the floors were changed. This palace used to be called \"summer palace\", because before it was reconstructed there had been more rooms on the north side, which protected them from the summer heat.\n\nPalace Užižić, earlier known as the Hektorović Palace incorrectly, was built about 1463 in floral Gothic style, at the place of the early Gothic house from the end of the 14th century, which is preserved within the present palace. It was built above the southern city wall, with a façade richly ornamented with single and triple lancet windows. The palace did not block the passage through the street in accordance with the Duke's decree. Members of the old noble family Užižić served as municipal officials performing various official duties. The palace remained unfinished for more than 500 years.\n\nCentral St. Stephen's square in the city of Hvar or Piazza is the largest square in Dalmatia. Originally it was a deep bay which was filled with rocks for centuries until it got its present dimensions. Subsequently, it was a space between two fortified cities: Groda on the north and Burg in the south. By the 15th century Piazza was formed with the cathedral in the east and sea in the west. It used to be wider than it is presently but due to shortage of space in the fortified city, houses were built on the northern part of Piazza in front of the city walls. Communal well in the center of Piazza dates from 1520. Piazza was fully paved in 1780.\n\nOn the southern wall towards the main square two gates were opened out of which the western one has the monumental portal in the Gothic style. It is called the Main Gate (Porta Maestra) and the Gate of the Palmtree (Porta del datallo) from the 15th century. In the 16th century this gate was also called the Market Gate (Porta del mercato).\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2044630", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2044630", "title": "Minilab", "text": "Minilab\n\nA minilab is a small photographic developing and printing system, as opposed to large centralized photo developing labs. Many retail stores use film or digital minilabs to provide on-site photo finishing services.\n\nWith the increase in popularity of digital photography, the demand for film development has decreased. This means that the larger labs capable of processing 30 or 40 thousand films a day are going out of business, and more retailers are installing minilabs.\n\nIn Kodak and Agfa minilabs, films are processed using C41b chemistry and the paper is processed using RA-4. Using these chemical processes films can be ready for collection in as little as 20 minutes, depending on the machine capabilities and the operator.\n\nA typical minilab consists of two machines, a film processor and a paper printer/processor. In some installations, these two components are integrated into a single machine. In addition, some digital minilabs are also equipped with photo-ordering kiosks.\n\n35 mm films are pulled, this means the end of the film is extracted from cassette. This can be done manually or by using a small machine that essentially uses tape to pull the film leader out of the cassette. In cases when the end of the film cannot be removed or if the film is damaged, the film can be removed using a dark bag or a dark box. A twin check number (a pair of stickers with a unique number) is put onto the film and the matching number onto the film processing envelope, so that after processing this film can be easily identified to the customers envelope. Films are spliced on the leader cards one or two at a time, to do this the end of the film is cut square, special chemical-resistant tape is used to attach the film to the leader card. The leader card(s) is/are then inserted into the film processor and are fed through the machine using sprockets in the card. The film goes through a developer, bleach, fix and stabilizer, then through a dryer. After the film is processed it is cut from the leader card and reunited with the processing envelope containing the customer details, and then from here the film goes forward for printing.\n\nA minilab is typically a \"Roller Transport\" processor, where the film follows a serpentine path over many rollers. Each chemical processing step is done using a chemical immersion tank with replenishment to keep the Chemicals Fresh. Film advances down into the tank and then turns and rises up and out, then advances down into the next tank, and so forth. Chemical exposure timing is a combination of film advance speed and the physical length of the serpentine film path immersed in the fluid.\n\nA single minilab can be built to allow many different film widths in one device, from APS films to professional wide format films, using a flexible leader to pull the film through the mechanism. The leader is as wide as the widest possible format, and films attached to it are supported by guide rollers only. The leader may be gripped on each side between toothed drive belts following the same path as the film through the mechanism.\n\nMost printer/processes are computer controlled. The front of the film is fed into the printing gate. Sensors see the film and forward the film to the first frame. DX codes on the edge of the film are read by the printer and the film channel is selected accordingly to give the optimum result.\n\nThe paper stock is usually a continuous roll which cut after developing according to the size requirements of the customer. Different image widths are handled using different roll widths, and each width is usually done as a batch process of images all the same size. The light-sensitive paper stock can be contained within light-tight packaging so that the minilab operator only needs to remove the old empty paper container and insert a full one, without needing to darken the room to prevent paper exposure.\n\nEach frame is printed one at a time, the photographic paper is advanced each time and when there is sufficient frames printed the paper automatically advances into the paper processor. The paper passes through a developer, bleach/fix, a wash, and dryer. The prints are then cut up and are collected in a bundle. From here a smaller machine is used to cut the negatives into fours and sleeved to protect them.\n\nThe final job is to put the negatives with the prints into a wallet and into the processing envelope. The order is then priced and placed into a rack or drawer waiting for the customer to collect.\n\nBy the end of 2005, two manufacturers, Agfa and Konica went out of business. Minilab Factory GmbH took over the renowned minilab branch of Agfa in 2006. Gretag Imaging, not to be confused with former Gretag Macbeth, went bankrupt in December, 2002. Subsequently, the minilab related assets were sold to the newly formed San Marco Imaging. The wholesale lab related assets were sold to KIS Photo Me Group. In 2006, Noritsu and Fuji announced a strategic alliance. Noritsu were for a short time manufacturing all of Fuji's minilab equipment until they discontinued production. Fujifilm resumed production of the Frontier LP5700R and this remains available as of Dec 2017. Fujifilm's inkjet minilab or dry lab products are sourced from Noritsu and increasingly from Epson who also supplies the older type print head to Noritsu.\n\nA \"digital minilab\" is a computer printer that uses traditional chemical photographic processes to make prints from digital images. Photographs are input to the digital minilab using a built-in film scanner that captures images from negative and positive photographic films (including mounted slides), flatbed scanners, a kiosk that accepts CD-ROMs or memory cards from a digital camera, or a website that accepts uploads. The operator can make many corrections such as brightness or color saturation, contrast, scene lighting color correction, sharpness and cropping. A laser, LCD/LED, or Micro Light Valve Array (MLVA) then exposes photographic paper with the image, which is then processed by the minilab just as if it had been exposed from a negative.\n\nThe price of a digital minilab can reach up to $250,000 USD. A minilab, such as a Doli DL 1210 has a print resolution of 520dpi, accepts BMP, JPEG, and TIFF formats, and can print up to 8in by 12in. The most popular brands include KIS, Noritsu, Doli and Fuji.\n\nDigital minilabs are generally too expensive for typical home use, but many retailers purchase or lease them to offer photo printing services to their customers. The resulting photographs have the same quality and durability as traditional photographs since the same chemical processes (e.g. RA-4) are used. This is often better than can be achieved by typical home inkjet printers, and for smaller prints generally less expensive.\n\nA new type of minilab is the dry lab, which does not require the use of developer or fixer chemicals, and does not require moistening and then drying of the print. These machines are cheaper, smaller, and use inkjet printing instead of a chemical developing process. This allows them to be installed in smaller retail stores, print shops, and resort/tourist locations that could not justify an expensive, high throughput, wet minilab. Standard questions of inkjet quality and longevity apply.\n\n\"Dry lab\" is a term that evolved in the professional and consumer segments of the photo printing industry to distinguish later, chemistry free (or \"dry\") photo printing systems from traditional, silver halide (or \"wet\") systems.\n\nThere are currently two technologies used by manufacturers as print engines for either professional or commercial \"dry labs\". Although not strictly \"dry\", the first technology is a dye based, four colour (Yellow, Cyan, Magenta & Black) inkjet system. Inkjet based dry labs output prints with a relatively wide colour gamut although colours may take a few hours to stabilise after printing while the ink fully dries. The second technology that can be used is \"dye diffusion thermal transfer\" or D2T2 technology. D2T2 is a three colour (Yellow, Cyan & Magenta) thermal process whereby the colour dyes are transferred from an ink ribbon onto, or rather into, the surface of a special paper substrate. \"Dry labs\" are becoming increasingly popular with users as they are cheaper and easier to maintain than wet labs.\n\n\n"}

In this form much of the mythology surrounding Lilith has also been ascribed, in different accounts, to Al Basti, though with local regional variances taken into account.\n\nIn Turkic folklore Al Basti has been often confused as both a Mare, a Succubus, as well as any number of Middle Eastern female spirits which are told to enter a man's erotic dreams. However, the difference in the Al Basti legends is that she is not a sexual spirit, she rather visits those \"“who have guilty souls”\" and \"“come from families that have committed bloody crimes that have gone unpunished.”\"\n\nAccording to scholar Özhan Öztürk those who Al Basti visits are said to wake up in \"“an intense fever ... She is also known to steal horses, who are found sweating and exhausted in the morning, and unable to provide a full day's work. Due to her torments, she is also known as the 'red mother'.”\"\n\nThere is a further version of Al Basti, referred simply as Āl, a \"“demon of childbirth who blinds unborn children and causes miscarriages and stillbirths to women who have committed crimes that have gone unpunished. In this form she appears as spirit of flame, with snake-like hair, brass fingernails and iron teeth ... [she] hides in damp places.”\" According to Ann and Imel there is a similar legend found in Afghanistan.\n"}
{"id": "2044654", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2044654", "title": "Valencian Nationalist Bloc", "text": "Valencian Nationalist Bloc\n\nThe Valencian Nationalist Bloc ( or \"BNV\"; ) is a Valencian nationalist party in the Valencian Country, Spain. It is the largest party in the Coalició Compromís.\n\nThe Bloc was formed in 1998 as a result of the federation of several parties in a coalition formed for the 1995 regional elections. That group of parties was headed by Unitat del Poble Valencià (UPV, founded in 1982) which is the main predecessor of the current Bloc, together with other smaller parties, often locally based, such as the Valencian Nationalist Party (1990) or Alcoi Nationalists (1994).\n\nThe Bloc has historically defined itself as a left-wing party. This position shifted to a centrist or center-left position in the late nineties, as part of a strategy to appeal to a broader audience known as \"tercera via\" (third way). This strategy proved unsuccessful, especially due to their failure to attract enough of the regionalist vote in the 2003 regional elections.\nThen, for the 2007 Valencian regional elections to the Corts Valencianes, the Valencian regional parliament, the Bloc returned to a more left wing agenda as it ran in coalition with EUPV, the Valencian branch of Izquierda Unida, a coalition whose main member is the Communist Party (PCE). This coalition operated under the name of Compromís pel País Valencià. Compromís' results (seven seats) did not achieve their goal of growing and forming a front alongside the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) to oust the Partido Popular from the regional government, but allowed Bloc to enter the autonomous Parliament (two seats) and secured EUPV representation as well (the remaining five seats).\n\nHowever, a schism occurred soon after within the EUPV between the two more nationalist and social democratic MPs on the one side and the more communist and less nationalist remaining three members on the other. The former MPs were finally expelled from EUPV and went on to create a new party Iniciativa del Poble Valencià IdPV (Valencian People Initiative). In turn, they allied themselves with the Bloc, thus effectively gaining a majority for the nationalists in the coalition, while creating a climate of frigid relations between EUPV and Bloc for the remainder of the term, making the renewal of the pact for future polls unlikely in the short term.\n\nFor the 2008 General election the Bloc ran in coalition with other left wing, regional and green parties, as Iniciativa del Poble Valencià. However, despite the fact that the list was headed by a sitting deputy, Isaura Navarro, their vote fell relative to 2004.\n\nFor the 2011 Valencian Regional elections, they stood in an electoral alliance with Iniciativa del Poble Valencià and other Green parties in a new coalition called Coalició Compromís. This coalition won a record of six seats in the Valencian parliament, and also won the first seat in history for a Valencian Nationalist force in the Spanish national parliament at the 2011 Spanish General Election.\n\nThe Bloc only runs elections held in the Valencian Community. Including its Unitat del Poble Valencià former era, until 2011 it had historically polled at around 4% of the votes in elections for the Valencian regional parliament, with significantly lower figures when running at Spanish general elections in Valencia.\n\nSince 2011, it has been represented by Coalició Compromís, and became the third political force in the Land of Valencia, with 3 of 6 seats of Coalició Compromís in the Valencian parliament, about 385 seats in municipal councils and one seat in the Spanish parliament.\n\nBloc has been represented at the Valencian parliament three times, twice by means of a coalition with the Valencian branch of United Left.\n\nTheir first participation in this coalition was in 1987, under Bloc's \"Unitat del Poble Valencià\" (UPV) former name. According to the coalition pact, UPV was allotted two out of the six MPs. Internal tensions within the coalition and, especially, within the UPV, led to its disbanding. These events were the start of the process which led to the demise of UPV and its refoundation as BLOC.\n\nStill, both parties (under new names, Bloc for UPV and Esquerra Unida del País Valencià, EUPV, for United Left) agreed to repeat their coalition for the 2007 regional elections, in order to secure if only joint representation, something which was at stake if they participated by themselves. This renewed coalition, called \"Compromís pel País Valencià\", indeed achieved representation with seven MPs, two of which corresponded to Bloc according to the coalition pact rules. Internal dissent plagued again the coalition, this time predating especially on its EUPV component, which has split since.\n\nIn 2011, the BLOC created a coalition Coalició Compromís, running alongside Iniciativa del Poble Valencià (a scission of United Left) and the Green, both partners in the previous coalition. Coalició Compromís got 6 seats in the Valencian Parlement in the 2011 elections, consolidating itself as the third political force in the Land of Valencia.\n\nSupport for the Bloc is higher at the local level, with 384 councillors and about 20 mayors. Thus, it is the distant third major Valencian political party at the municipal level, far from the major parties, PP and PSPV-PSOE. The party is nearly absent in a number of areas in the Valencian Community (virtually all of those comarcas which are Spanish speaking only) while it is a major political agent in others, namely in its historic stronghold at the contiguous area formed by the northernmost part of Alicante province and the southernmost part of Valencia province.\n\nFor the 1999 European Parliament election the Bloc allied with the Catalonia-based Convergence and Union and the Majorca Socialist Party with Bloc leader Enric Morera fifth on the list. The coalition won two seats, however Morera briefly became a Euro MP in April 2004\n\nThe Bloc joined the Galeusca coalition in the 2004 European Parliament election, with other nationalist parties from the Spanish state such as the Basque Nationalist Party, the Catalan Convergence and Union, the Galician Nationalist Bloc, and the Socialist Party of Majorca. Galeusca got two seats, neither of them for the BNV.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2044655", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2044655", "title": "Three-phase commit protocol", "text": "Three-phase commit protocol\n\nIn computer networking and databases, the three-phase commit protocol (3PC) is a distributed algorithm which lets all nodes in a distributed system agree to commit a transaction. It is a refinement of the two-phase commit protocol (2PC) which is more resilient to failures.\n\nA two-phase commit protocol cannot dependably recover from a failure of both the coordinator and a cohort member during the Commit phase. If only the coordinator had failed, and no cohort members had received a commit message, it could safely be inferred that no commit had happened. If, however, both the coordinator and a cohort member failed, it is possible that the failed cohort member was the first to be notified, and had actually done the commit. Even if a new coordinator is selected, it cannot confidently proceed with the operation until it has received an agreement from all cohort members, and hence must block until all cohort members respond.\n\nThe three-phase commit protocol eliminates this problem by introducing the Prepared to commit state. If the coordinator fails before sending preCommit messages, the cohort will unanimously agree that the operation was aborted. The coordinator will not send out a doCommit message until all cohort members have ACKed that they are Prepared to commit. This eliminates the possibility that any cohort member actually completed the transaction before all cohort members were aware of the decision to do so (an ambiguity that necessitated indefinite blocking in the two-phase commit protocol).\n\nThe pre-commit phase introduced above helps us to recover from the case when a participant failure or both coordinator and participant node failure during commit phase. When the recovery coordinator takes over after coordinator failure during commit phase of two-phase commit, the new pre-commit comes handy as follows: On querying participants, if it learns that some nodes are in commit phase then it assumes that previous coordinator before crashing has made the decision to commit. Hence it can shepherd the protocol to commit. Similarly, if a participant says that it doesn’t receive PrepareToCommit message, then the new coordinator can assume that the previous coordinator failed even before it completed the PrepareToCommit phase. Hence it can safely assume no other participant would have committed the changes and hence safely abort the transaction.\n\nUsing Skeen's original three-phase commit protocol, it is possible that a quorum becomes connected without being able to make progress (this is not a deadlock situation; the system will still progress if the network partitioning is resolved). Keidar and Dolev's E3PC refines Skeen's three-phase commit protocol and solves this problem in a way which *always* allows a quorum to make progress.\n\nThree-phase commit assumes a network with bounded delay and nodes with bounded response times; In most practical systems with unbounded network delay and process pauses, it cannot guarantee atomicity. The other drawback of the protocol is it requires at least three round trips to complete, needing a minimum of three round trip times (RTTs). This is potentially a long latency to complete each transaction.\n\n"}

It was created by rapper Nas, his manager Steve Stoute, producer Dr. Dre and production team the Trackmasters. The group was composed of East Coast-based rappers Nas, Foxy Brown, AZ and also Nature, who served as a replacement for Cormega after he was ousted from the group.\n\nAlthough the group received initial hype and high expectations from fans upon their formation after collectively signing to Dr. Dre's Aftermath label, The Firm's debut album, \"The Album\" (1997), generated disappointing sales and generally negative criticism. The album, which featured predominant mafioso rap-themes and production from Dr. Dre and the Trackmasters, was criticized for its mainstream, pop-orientation. Their debut album was the group's only release and they disbanded in 1999 with each member continuing their solo careers.\n\nThe Firm's origins lie in the recording of Nas's studio album \"It Was Written\" (1996), which included a collaboration on the song \"Affirmative Action\" with East Coast-based rappers AZ, Cormega, and Foxy Brown. The supergroup was a project created by rapper Nas, his manager Steve Stoute, West Coast-based rapper and producer Dr. Dre, and production team the Trackmasters. The resulting line-up included Nas, Brown, AZ and rapper Nature. Cormega had been ousted from the group and was replaced by Nature prior to recording The Firm's debut, due to artistic differences between him and Nas, as well as contract disagreements with Nas's manager Steve Stoute. According to Poke & Tone, 50 Cent and Mary J. Blige were tentatively considered for the group.\n\nPrior to their formation, the members were at transitional stages of their careers, as Nas had commercialized his musical style with his second album, Foxy Brown had earned her first recording contract, AZ had gained critical acclaim for his 1995 debut album \"Doe or Die\" (1995), and Cormega had chosen to continue his rapping career after his release from prison in 1995. The project also served as an attempt by Dr. Dre to focus on producing other artists work rather than his solo work, following his departure from Death Row Records and the formation of his Aftermath label, which the group was collectively signed to. After the announcement of the group's formation by Dr. Dre, all involved with the project hyped it heavily, creating considerable buzz.\n\nThe group's only studio album, \"The Album\" (1997) was a concept album that revolved around mafioso rap-themes, and featured production work from Dr. Dre and the Trackmasters. While anticipated with much hype, \"The Album\" received generally negative reviews and generated disappointing sales upon its release.\n\nDespite the group's excessive hype and its mainstream musical approach, \"The Firm\" did not meet the expectations of fans who were introduced to the group via \"It Was Written\", and \"The Album\" was heavily dismissed by fans and music writers for its focus on a more mainstream, R&B and pop-orientation, rather than the members' previous styles. Nas particularly was believed by fans and critics to have abandoned his roots in favor of seeking pop stardom.\n\nThe Firm disbanded the following year and its members continued their solo careers. Nas' and Dr. Dre's participation in the group furthered speculation by fans and critics that the two artists were losing their creativity and appeal. Their work during this period has since been considered the weakest and least successful of their careers.\n\nThe replacing of Cormega with rapper Nature strained his friendship with Nas. Cormega, who continued to resent being ousted from the group, released the white label \"Fuck Nas & Nature\", circulating it through the mixtape market. Nature retaliated through a verse contribution on a DJ Clue mixtape. The two have since ended their beef and have recorded and performed together. After a short-lived truce, Nas attacked Cormega on the diss track \"Destroy & Rebuild\" from his fifth studio album \"Stillmatic\" (2001).\n\nIn December 2006, Cormega, Foxy Brown and Nas reunited to perform \"Affirmative Action\" live on-stage, ending the beef between Cormega and Nas. A reunion was not confirmed. In an August 2010 interview with MTV, Foxy Brown stated there have been recent discussions on a Firm reformation, dependent on the remaining four agreeing to it.\n\n\n"}

The county saw the vast bulk of its population and seats removed on the creation of the County of London in 1889 and its wider replacement the county of Greater London in 1965. Reflecting its mainly suburban and rural nature, all seats covering the present definition of Surrey have been held by Conservative MPs at each general election since 1885, with the exception of two Liberals in 1906 and 1 Liberal Democrat in 2001.\n\n\nEleven other seats fell within the north-east of Surrey until 1965, forming the metropolitan part closest to London and the majority of the population (shown in the Historical Representation tables below). These were moved into Greater London leaving a predominantly suburban and rural content.\n\n\n\nThe initial proposals at the Fifth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies which reported prior to 2010 envisaged no changes for the seats of East Surrey, Esher and Walton, Runnymede and Weybridge, Spelthorne, Surrey Heath and Woking seats. Changes for Mole Valley would realign rural ward boundaries with Epsom & Ewell not moving any voters. A disparity of around 11,000 electors exists between Guildford and Reigate seats. These amendments are envisaged, reducing it to 8,000 of patent malapportionment due to population change:\n\nGuildford and South West Surrey, move:\n\n\nReigate and Epsom & Ewell\n\n\nThe main objections focused upon the moving of Bramley, Busbridge and Hascombe into South West Surrey and a public review meeting was called which was dominated by this. The objections centred on the argument that the area had stronger links, including transport services, to Guildford than to Farnham and Godalming. Some noted that the previous Boundary Commission rejected a proposal to move Bramley after public objection. However this would have been to Mole Valley and the petitioners, including Bramley Parish Council, had stated that whilst they preferred to stay in Guildford, if they had to move they would prefer to be moved to South West Surrey. Also Bramley was not the entirety of the ward and the Commission was deeply reluctant to divide wards. The review upheld the proposals.\n\nObjections were also made to the names of Guildford, Surrey Heath and Reigate. In general the objections were limited by a desire to avoid name changes unless majority boundary changes were made.\n\nThe objection to Guildford was lodged by a non resident who proposed \"Guildford and Cranleigh\" to take into account the large village in the seat. This was rejected, with the citation that there was no local support.\n\nReigate was objected to by those who proposed \"Reigate and Banstead\", the name of the district. Amongst those objecting were both Reigate and Banstead Borough Council and Crispin Blunt, the local MP. However the seat covers only 70% of the district, with Reigate at its centre, whilst Banstead (in the north east corner) has a history of being moved between seats. The present name was retained.\n\nSurrey Heath received objections, in part because of the 20% of the constituency that is outside the Surrey Heath district. Alternative suggested included \"North West Surrey\" (the pre 1997 name), \"Camberley and Ash\" and \"West Surrey\". However this proposal was opposed by many, including the Surrey Heath borough council. The objection was rejection as the identity was clear and the alternatives were divided and even more imprecise.\n\nThe proposed changes to Reigate, Epsom & Ewell and Mole Valley did not meet objections.\n\nThe Boundary Commission for England submitted their final proposals in respect of the Sixth Periodic Review of Westminster Constituencies (the 2018 review) in September 2018. Although the proposals were immediately laid before Parliament they were not brought forward by the Government for approval. Accordingly, they did not come into effect for the 2019 election which took place on 12 December 2019, and which was contested using the constituency boundaries in place since 2010.\n\nUnder the terms of the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011, the Sixth Review was based on reducing the total number of MPs from 650 to 600 and a strict electoral parity requirement that the electorate of all constituencies should be within a range of 5% either side of the electoral quota.\n\nOn 24 March 2020, the Minister of State for the Cabinet Office, Chloe Smith, issued a written statement to Parliament setting out the Government's thinking with regard to parliamentary boundaries. They propose to bring forward primary legislation to remove the statutory obligation to implement the 2018 Boundary Review recommendations, as well as set the framework for future boundary reviews in time for the next review which is due to begin in early 2021 and report no later than October 2023. It is proposed that the number of constituencies now remains at the current level of 650, rather than being reduced to 600, while retaining the requirement that the electorate should be no more than +/- 5% from the electoral quota.\n\n\"Primary data source:\" House of Commons research briefing - General election results from 1918 to 2019\n\nThe number of votes cast for each political party who fielded candidates in constituencies comprising Surrey in the 2019 general election were as follows:\n\n1974 & 1979 - Liberal Party; 1983 & 1987 - SDP-Liberal Alliance\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> Included in Other\n\n1974 & 1979 - Liberal Party; 1983 & 1987 - SDP-Liberal Alliance\n\nThe following tables show the results for all Surrey constituencies in the General Elections in 2019, 2017, 2015 and 2010.

The attorney general asked for six years for Tejero, and five for Ynestrillas, but they were only given seven months and a day and six months and a day respectively, the minimum sentence. Neither of them lost their military rank, and Ynestrillas was later promoted to Commander (major).\n\nLieutenant-Colonel Tejero attempted another coup on 23 February 1981, in the middle of the voting by the deputies for the new Prime minister.

It usually affects the two lowest joints of the hock (the tarsometatarsal and the distal intertarsal joints), with the third joint, the proximal intertarsal, being the least likely to develop bone spavin. This condition has various types: jack spavin when lesion on the tarsal and carpal bones is large, and high spavin when the pathology occurs higher in the joint than is typical. Conversely, occult spavin does not produce any significant exostoses on the small tarsals, whilst bog spavin and blood spavin do not involve bony changes.\n\nExcessive compression can cause, over time, the cartilage between the upper and lower surfaces of the lower tarsal bones to become compressed and eroded. The joint spaces then become smaller, and new bone growth may occur in the area.\n\nUneven loading causes excessive compression of the cartilage and bone on one side, and strain in the joint capsule and supporting ligaments on the other side. When the joint is repeatedly overloaded on the edge of its surface, exostoses, or \"bone spurs,\" occur. Strain of the supporting ligaments can cause exostosis around the joint as well.\n\nThere are several conformational defects that contribute to bone spavin. Those that cause uneven loading of the hocks, such as sickle hocks and cow hocks, are especially noteworthy. Poor trimming or shoeing can also contribute to bone spavin in any horse, no matter what their conformation.\n\nCertain types of activities may also contribute to uneven or repeated loading of the lower hock joints, and thus bone spavin. These include sports that require a great deal of hock flexion (dressage), stress (jumping), sudden stops or turns (western events, such as reining), or a great deal of concussion (Standardbred racing).\n\n\"Juvenile spavin\" is the occurrence of bone spavin in horses less than 3 years old. It usually occurs before the animal has done much work. While osteochondrosis lesions are the likely cause in some cases, this condition can also occur secondary to the distortion of the cuboidal bones which can occur in premature or dysmature foals.\n\nInitially, signs of bone spavin may include sporadic and vague hindlimb lameness. Some horses may become uncomfortable in one lead, or may demonstrate stiffness walking downhill.\n\nIn many cases lameness worsens, becoming more obvious and consistent. Advanced cases may have a bony swelling on the hock, typically on the inside of the joint. Lameness, although usually worse in one leg, is commonly bilateral.\n\nThe affected limb usually lands toe-first, wearing down that foot faster than the other. The affected limb usually has a shorter, lower arc than the other foot, as the horse is trying to reduce the painful flexion of the joint, so the leg appears to drag.\n\nA flexion test of an affected limb often produces a temporary worsening of the lameness. Such a response to a flexion test would support the diagnosis of bone spavin. A flexion test involves holding the hock in forced flexion for a period of time before trotting the horse away immediately.\n\nA provisional diagnosis of bone spavin should usually be supported by further investigation in order to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nTypical radiographic changes include spurs, new bone, bone destruction and/or joint narrowing or loss.\n\nAnaesthesia of an affected joint is a more definitive way of confirming the presence of pain arising from that joint. Introduction of local anaesthetic into a joint should abolish or at least significantly lessen the lameness. This technique is not absolutely specific, as the distal pouches of the tarsometatarsal joint are immediately adjacent to the suspensory ligament. This means that anaesthetic in the tarsometatarsal joint can occasionally desensitize pain arising from suspensory ligament, giving the false impression that joint pain has been abolished.\n\nScintigraphy (bone scan) can help to differentiate between suspensory origin desmitis and bone spavin.\n\nBony changes of the lower hock joint are irreversible. It is possible, however, to manage the problem and thereby slow the progression of the bone spavin, ease the pain, and control the lameness. Surgery is an option for horses that do not respond to conventional treatments.\n\n\"NSAIDs\", or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, may help improve the lameness in the horse. However, it is important to note that high doses of NSAIDs given over several days can cause kidney damage, as well as ulcers. NSAIDs may also be illegal in competition, so it may be necessary to stop treatment with NSAIDs several days before the horse competes.\n\n\"Corticosteroid injections\" into the lower hock joints may solve the lameness of the horse for several weeks or months. Unlike other joints, the drugs can be repeatedly injected into the lower tarsal joints as needed. Again, it is important to check association rules to see if corticosteroids are not allowed in competition, so that they may be discontinued before the horse competes.\n\nTiludronic acid, a bisphosphonate, tradenames Tildren and Equidronate (UK) has demonstrated to be beneficial in the treatment of bone spavin. It is administered by slow infusion (30 mn) mixed with saline.\n\nOther joint medications, like \"hyaluronic acid\" and \"Adequan\", may help alleviate the pain if the horse has mild bone spavin. However, they are less useful for treating moderate of severe cases. \"MSM\" may also help horses with moderate bone spavin.\n\nProper shoeing is critical in the management of a horse with bone spavin. Shoes most helpful for these horses include shoes that assist in breakover (like a square or rolled toe, or shoes with wedge pads). Shoes with heel support may also help horses with bone spavin, such as egg bar shoes.\nA set toe can be applied to protect the toe from increased wear, as lack of flexion in the hock will cause the horse to drag its toe. A trailer or lateral extension can be fitted to prevent an axial swing developed by the horse, allowing the horse to make contact with the ground earlier and prevent rotation within the hock.\nEach case of bone spavin should be shod independently depending on the severity of the case and the horses needs, there is not a specific shoe to be applied.\n\nIt is best for a horse with bone spavin to be exercised daily. Preferably, this should be ridden or driven work, as round pen or longeing exercise places uneven stress on the joint. Pasture turnout may not be beneficial if the horse does not move much.\n\nIt is best to decrease the intensity of the workload for a horse with bone spavin. However, even with careful management, bone spavin will progressively get worse, and the animal may not be able to continue at the level of competition it was first used for once the lameness is consistent. Many horses can still be successful in a less-strenuous career. Light exercise is better than no exercise at all, and a change of career may prolong the horse's useful life.\n\nFusion of the joint with bone may end the lameness, as the joint has then become stable. However, this may take several years, or never occur. In these cases, surgery may be an option.\n\nSome of the joint cartilage is destroyed with a drill bit or a laser, and the holes are sometimes filled with bone grafts.\n\nThe veterinarian may also inject a caustic agent into the joint to destroy the cartilage, as opposed to drilling the joint. After the procedure, the horse will be lame for weeks or months, until the joint has fused.\n\nExercise can help accelerate the fusion of the bones, so the horse may be hand-walked after the injection. NSAIDs are usually given to ease the pain.\n\nThe prognosis for bone spavin varies, depending on several factors including:\n\n\nMost horses cannot continue at a high-level of competition for long. However, many horses can continue happily for use as a trail or pleasure horse, or for light work.\n\n"}

After eight years, Peterson was granted a new trial after the judge ruled a critical prosecution witness gave misleading testimony. This second trial had been scheduled to begin on May 8, 2017. On February 24, 2017, Peterson submitted an Alford plea to the reduced charge of manslaughter. He was sentenced to time already served and freed. \n\nPeterson's case is the subject of the documentary miniseries \"The Staircase\", which started filming soon after his arrest in 2001 and followed events until his eventual Alford plea in 2017. In 2019, he released his own account of his life since his wife's death in an independently published memoir, \"Behind the Staircase\".\n\nMichael Iver Peterson was born near Nashville, Tennessee, the son of Eugen Iver Peterson and Eleanor Peterson (). He graduated from Duke University with a bachelor's degree in political science. While there, Peterson was president of Sigma Nu fraternity and was editor of \"The Chronicle\", the daily student newspaper, from 1964–1965. He attended classes at the law school of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\nAfter graduating, Peterson took a civilian job with the U.S. Department of Defense, where he was assigned to research arguments supporting increased military involvement in Vietnam. That year he also married Patricia Sue, who taught at an elementary school on the Rhein-Main Air Base in Gräfenhausen, West Germany. They had two children, Clayton and Todd. In 1968, Peterson enlisted in the United States Marine Corps and served in the Vietnam War. In 1971, he received an honorable discharge with the rank of captain after a car accident left him with a permanent disability. \n\nYears later, during a mayoral campaign, Peterson claimed he had won a Silver Star, a Bronze Star with Valor, and two Purple Hearts. He had all the medals, but said he did not have the documentation for them. Peterson claimed he had received one Purple Heart after being hit by shrapnel when another soldier stepped on a land mine, and the other when he was shot. He later admitted his war injury was not the result of the shrapnel wound in Vietnam, but was the result of a car accident in Japan, where he was stationed after the war as a military policeman. The Raleigh, North Carolina \"News & Observer\" said records did not contain any mention of the two Purple Hearts that Peterson said he had received. However, military files verified that he received a Silver Star and the Bronze Star Medal with Valor.\n\nPeterson and his first wife Patricia lived in Germany for some time. There they befriended Elizabeth and George Ratliff and their two children, Margaret and Martha. After George's death, the Peterson and Ratliff families became very close. When Elizabeth Ratliff died in 1985, Michael became the guardian of her two children. After Michael and Patricia divorced in 1987, Clayton and Todd lived with Patricia, and Margaret and Martha stayed with Michael, who then moved to Durham, North Carolina. Clayton and Todd later also joined their father.\n\nPeterson wrote three novels based \"around his experiences during the Vietnamese conflict\"—\"The Immortal Dragon\", \"A Time of War\", and \"A Bitter Peace\". He co-wrote the biographical \"Charlie Two Shoes and the Marines of Love Company\" with journalist David Perlmutt, and co-wrote \"Operation Broken Reed\" with Lt. Col. Arthur L. Boyd. Peterson also worked as a newspaper columnist for the Durham \"Herald-Sun\", where his columns became known for their criticism of police and of Durham County District Attorney James Hardin Jr. Hardin was the prosecutor of Peterson for the murder of his second wife, Kathleen.\n\nIn 1989, Michael moved in with Kathleen Atwater, a successful Nortel business executive. They married in 1997, and Kathleen's daughter Caitlin joined the extended family that now consisted of Clayton, Todd, Martha, and Margaret.\n\nOn December 9, 2001, Peterson called an emergency line to report that he had just found Kathleen unconscious in their Forest Hills mansion and suspected she had fallen down \"fifteen, twenty, I don't know\" stairs. He later claimed that he had been outside by the pool and had come in at 2:40 am to find Kathleen at the foot of the stairs. Peterson said she must have fallen down the stairs after consuming alcohol and Valium.\n\nToxicology results showed that Kathleen's blood alcohol content was 0.07 percent (70 mg/100mL). The autopsy report concluded that the 48-year-old woman sustained a matrix of severe injuries, including a fracture of the thyroid neck cartilage and seven lacerations to the top and back of her head, consistent with blows from a blunt object, and had died from blood loss ninety minutes to two hours after sustaining the injuries. Kathleen's daughter, Caitlin, and Kathleen's sister, Candace Zamperini, both initially proclaimed Michael's innocence and publicly supported him alongside his children, but Zamperini reconsidered after learning of Peterson's bisexuality, as did Caitlin after reading her mother's autopsy report. Both subsequently broke off from the rest of the family.\n\nAlthough forensic expert Henry Lee, hired by Peterson's defense, testified that the blood-spatter evidence was consistent with an accidental fall down the stairs, police investigators concluded that the injuries were inconsistent with such an accident. As Peterson was the only person at the residence at the time of Kathleen's death, he was the prime suspect and was soon charged with her murder. He pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe medical examiner, Deborah Radisch, concluded that Kathleen had died from lacerations of the scalp caused by a homicidal assault. According to Radisch, the total of seven lacerations to the top and back of Kathleen's head were the result of repeated blows with a light, yet rigid, weapon. The defense disputed this theory. According to their analysis, Kathleen's skull had not been fractured by the blows, nor was she brain damaged, which was inconsistent with injuries sustained in a beating death.\n\nThe trial drew increasing media attention as details of Peterson's private life emerged. Hardin and his prosecution team (among them Mike Nifong) attacked Peterson's credibility, focusing on his alleged misreporting of his military service and what they described as a \"gay life\" he led and kept secret. The prosecution contended that the Petersons' marriage was far from happy, suggesting that Kathleen had discovered Michael's alleged secret \"gay life\" and wanted to end their marriage. It was the main motive that the prosecution offered at trial for Kathleen's alleged murder (the other being a $1.5 million life insurance policy). According to Assistant District Attorney Freda Black, Kathleen\n\nwould have been infuriated by learning that her husband, who she truly loved, was bi-sexual and having an extramarital relationship—not with another woman—but a man, which would have been humiliating and embarrassing to her. We believe that once she learned this information that an argument ensued and a homicide occurred.\n\nThe defense argued that Kathleen accepted Michael's bisexuality and that the marriage was very happy, a position supported by Michael and Kathleen's children and other friends and associates.\n\nThe prosecution said that Kathleen's murder was most likely committed with a custom-made fireplace poker called a blow poke. It had been a gift to the Petersons from Kathleen's sister but was missing from the house at the time of the investigation. Late in the trial the defense team produced the missing blow poke, which they said had been overlooked in the garage by police investigators. Forensic tests revealed that it had been untouched and unmoved for too long to have been used in the murder. A juror contacted after the trial noted that the jury dismissed the idea of the blow poke as the murder weapon.\n\nElizabeth Ratliff, the friend of the Petersons who died in Germany in 1985, had also been found dead at the foot of her staircase with injuries to the head. Her death had been investigated by both the German police and U.S. military police. An autopsy at the time of her death concluded Ratliff died from an intra-cerebral haemorrhage secondary to the blood coagulation disorder Von Willebrand's disease, based on blood in her cerebrospinal fluid and reports that she had been suffering severe, persistent headaches in the weeks leading up to her death. The coroner determined that the hemorrhage resulted in immediate death followed by Ratliff falling down the stairs after collapsing. The Petersons had dinner with Ratliff and her daughters, and Peterson had stayed and helped Ratliff put the children to bed before going home. The children's nanny, Barbara, discovered the body when she arrived the next morning. Peterson was the last known person to see her alive.\n\nBefore Peterson's trial, the Durham court ordered the exhumation of Ratliff's embalmed body, buried in Texas, for a second autopsy in April 2003. Arrangements were made for the Durham medical examiner, who had initially performed Kathleen's autopsy, to perform this reevaluation, over the objections of defense counsel who argued that the autopsy should be performed by Texas medical examiners. The body was then transported from Texas to Durham. The Durham M.E. found sufficient evidence drawn from the results of the second autopsy, along with new witness statements describing the scene, to overturn the earlier findings and list Ratliff's cause of death as \"homicide\".\n\nThe prosecution declined to accuse Peterson of Ratliff's death, but introduced the death into the trial as an incident giving Peterson the idea of how to \"fake\" Kathleen's accident. Despite police reports that there was very little blood at the scene of Ratliff's death, the nanny, who was the first to discover Ratliff's body in 1985, took the stand at Peterson's trial and testified that there was a large amount of blood at the scene. Another witness testified to spending much of the day cleaning blood stains off the wall. The admissibility of the Ratliff evidence in court was one of the grounds for the subsequent appeal against his conviction, lodged by Peterson's lawyers in 2005.\n\nIn October 2002, acting as administrator of Kathleen's estate, Caitlin filed a wrongful death claim against Peterson. In June 2006, he voluntarily filed for bankruptcy. Two weeks later, Caitlin filed an objection to the bankruptcy. On February 1, 2007, Caitlin and Peterson settled the wrongful death claim for $25 million, pending acceptance by the courts involved; finalization of the settlement by the court was announced on February 1, 2008. In the settlement, Peterson did not admit that he murdered Kathleen.\n\nOn October 10, 2003, after one of the longest trials in North Carolina history, a Durham County jury found Peterson guilty of the murder of Kathleen, and he was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Denial of parole requires premeditation. Despite the jury accepting the murder was a \"spur-of-the-moment\" crime, they also found it was premeditated. As one juror explained it, premeditated meant not only planning hours or days ahead, but could also mean planning in the seconds before committing a spur-of-the-moment crime. Peterson was housed at the Nash Correctional Institution near Rocky Mount until he was released on December 16, 2011.\n\nPeterson's appeal was filed by his defense counsel, Thomas Maher, now serving as his court-appointed attorney, and was argued before the North Carolina Court of Appeals on April 18, 2006. On September 19, the Court of Appeals rejected Peterson's arguments that he did not get a fair trial because of repeated judicial mistakes. The Appeals' ruling said the evidence was fairly admitted. The judges did find defects in a search warrant, but said they had no ill effect on the defense. Because the ruling was not unanimous, under North Carolina law, Peterson had right to appeal to the North Carolina Supreme Court, which accepted the case. Oral argument was heard on September 10, 2007. On November 9, the Court announced that it affirmed the decision of the Appeals. Absent a reconsideration of the ruling or the raising of a federal issue, Peterson had exhausted his appeal of the verdict.\n\nOn November 12, 2008, attorneys J. Burkhardt Beale and Jason Anthony of Richmond, Virginia, who were now representing Peterson, filed a motion for a new trial in Durham County court on three grounds: that the prosecution withheld exculpatory evidence about the blow poke, that the prosecution used an expert witness whose qualifications were disputed, and that one juror based his judgment on racial factors. On March 10, 2009, Peterson's motion was denied by the Durham County Superior Court.\n\nIn late 2009, a new theory of Kathleen's death was raised: that she had been attacked by an owl outside, fallen after rushing inside, and been knocked unconscious after hitting her head on the first tread of the stairs. The owl theory was raised by Durham attorney T. Lawrence Pollard, a neighbor of the Petersons who was not involved in the case but had been following the public details. He approached the police suggesting an owl might have been responsible after reading the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation (SBI) evidence list and finding a \"feather\" listed. Peterson's attorneys had determined that the SBI crime lab report listed a microscopic owl feather and a wooden sliver from a tree limb entangled in a clump of hair that had been pulled out by the roots found clutched in Kathleen's left hand. A re-examination of the hair in September 2008 had found two more microscopic owl feathers.\n\nAccording to Pollard, had a jury been presented with this evidence it would have \"materially affected their deliberation and therefore would have materially affected their ultimate verdict\". Prosecutors have ridiculed the claim, and Deborah Radisch, who conducted Kathleen's autopsy, says it was unlikely that an owl or any other bird could have made wounds as deep as those on her scalp. However, Radisch's opinion was challenged by other experts in three separate affidavits filed in 2010.\n\nDespite interest in this theory among some outside advocates, no motion for a new trial was filed on this point in 2009. On March 2, 2017 (following his Alford plea), Peterson's attorney filed a motion to allow him to pay for a bird expert at the Smithsonian Institution to examine feather fragments found in Kathleen's hair to determine if she was attacked by a raptor.\n\nIn August 2010, following a series of newspaper articles critical of the SBI, North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper led an investigation which resulted in the suspension of SBI analyst Duane Deaver, one of the principal witnesses against Peterson, after the report found his work among the worst done on scores of flawed criminal cases. Pollard subsequently filed affidavits to support a motion that Superior Court Judge Orlando Hudson order the state Medical Examiner's Office to turn over all documentation related to Kathleen's autopsy to Peterson's attorneys. However, Judge Hudson barred Pollard from filing further motions on behalf of Peterson because he did not represent him. A new motion was filed in August 2010 by David Rudolf, one of Peterson's original attorneys, who acted \"pro bono\" in proceedings challenging the SBI testimony.\n\nDeaver was fired from the SBI in January 2011, after an independent audit of the agency found he had falsely represented evidence in 34 cases, including withholding negative results in the case of Greg Taylor, a North Carolina man who spent seventeen years in prison on a murder conviction based on Deaver's testimony. A bloodstain-analysis team that Deaver had trained was suspended and disbanded. In the 2003 Peterson trial, Deaver testified that he had been mentored by SBI bloodstain specialist David Spittle, had worked 500 bloodstain cases, written 200 reports, and testified in 60 cases. During the retrial hearing, SBI Assistant Director Eric Hooks testified that Deaver had written only 47 reports. Spittle testified that he could not recall mentoring Deaver who, since completing a two-day training course in the 1980s, had testified in only four cases, the Peterson case being the third. The SBI cited the bloodstain analysis given in the fourth case as the reason for firing Deaver.\n\nOn December 16, 2011, Peterson was released from the Durham County jail on $300,000 bail and placed under house arrest with a tracking anklet. His release on bond followed a judicial order for a new trial after Judge Hudson found that Deaver had given \"materially misleading\" and \"deliberately false\" testimony about bloodstain evidence, and had exaggerated his training, experience, and expertise. Former North Carolina Attorney General Rufus Edmisten said that any evidence gathered after Deaver arrived at the scene might be deemed inadmissible in a new trial. In July 2014, Peterson's bond restrictions were eased.\n\nIn October 2014, the court appointed Mike Klinkosum to represent Peterson, replacing David Rudolf, who had been working \"pro bono\" on the case since Peterson's conviction was overturned. Rudolf had stated that he could no longer afford to represent Peterson without being paid. On November 14, 2016, Peterson's request for the second trial to be dismissed was refused, and a new trial was scheduled to begin on May 8, 2017. However, a news report on February 7, 2017, indicated that a resolution had been negotiated by Rudolf (once again representing Peterson) and the Durham County District Attorney.\n\nOn February 24, 2017, Peterson entered an Alford plea (a guilty plea entered because sufficient evidence exists to convict him of the offense, but the defendant asserts innocence) to the voluntary manslaughter of Kathleen. The judge sentenced him to a maximum of 86 months in prison, with credit for time previously served. Because Peterson had already served more time than the sentence (98.5 months), he did not face additional prison time.\n\nThe court case generated widespread interest in part because of a televised documentary series variously named \"Soupçons\" (Suspicions), \"Death on the Staircase\", and \"The Staircase\", which detailed Peterson's legal and personal troubles. Eight 45-minute episodes of the documentary were assembled from more than 600 hours of footage. It was directed by French filmmaker Jean-Xavier de Lestrade and released by Maha Productions in October 2004. The documentary offers an intimate depiction of defense preparations for the trial. It also examines the role and behavior of the press as it covered aspects of the case. The filmmakers started their project within weeks of Kathleen's death and Peterson's murder indictment; jury selection took place in May 2003 with the case itself going to trial in July 2003.\n\nFollowing the guilty verdict, de Lestrade interviewed the jurors to find out why they reached their verdict. By and large, the jurors were swayed by the amount of blood Kathleen lost and the number of lacerations, which indicated to them it could not have been an accident. Henry Lee, however, had testified at the trial that the amount of blood was irrelevant, as the blood spatter indicated most of it was coughed up rather than from the wounds themselves. He also suggested some of the blood could have been diluted with urine. Lee had also duplicated blood spatter from coughing for the jury by drinking ketchup and spitting it out.\n\nIn November 2012, de Lestrade released a sequel, \"The Staircase 2: The Last Chance\", which premiered at the International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam. The film documents Peterson's family and his legal team's arguments in seeking a retrial, in which they succeed.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2044733", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2044733", "title": "Duty to rescue", "text": "Duty to rescue\n\nA duty to rescue is a concept in tort law that arises in a number of cases, describing a circumstance in which a party can be held liable for failing to come to the rescue of another party who could face potential injury or death without being rescued. In common law systems, it is rarely formalized in statutes which would bring the penalty of law down upon those who fail to rescue. This does not necessarily obviate a moral duty to rescue: though law is binding and carries government-authorized sanctions and awarded civil penalties, there are also separate ethical arguments for a duty to rescue even where law does not punish failure to rescue.\n\nIn the common law of most English-speaking countries, there is no general duty to come to the rescue of another. Generally, a person cannot be held liable for doing nothing while another person is in peril. However, such a duty may arise in two situations:\n\n\nWhere a duty to rescue arises, the rescuer must generally act with reasonable care, and can be held liable for injuries caused by a reckless rescue attempt. However, many states have limited or removed liability from rescuers in such circumstances, particularly where the rescuer is an emergency worker. Furthermore, the rescuers need not endanger themselves in conducting the rescue.\n\nMany civil law systems, which are common in Continental Europe, Latin America and much of Africa, impose a far more extensive duty to rescue. The duty is usually limited to doing what is “reasonable”. In particular, a helper does not have to substantially endanger themselves.\n\nThis can mean that anyone who finds someone in need of medical help must take all reasonable steps to seek medical care and render best-effort first aid. Commonly, the situation arises on an event of a traffic accident: other drivers and passers-by must take an action to help the injured without regard to possible personal reasons not to help (e.g. having no time, being in a hurry) or ascertain that help has been requested from officials. \n\nA duty to rescue arises under international shipping law: a ship which is in a position to provide assistance to persons in distress at sea must do so. This requirement is found in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea and represents customary international law.\n\nIn some countries, there exists a legal requirement for citizens to assist people in distress, unless doing so would put themselves or others in harm's way. Citizens are often required to, at minimum, call the local emergency number, unless doing so would be harmful, in which case the authorities should be contacted when the harmful situation has been removed. , there were such laws in several countries, including Albania, Andorra, Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Serbia, Spain, Switzerland and Tunisia.\n\nArgentina has legislation on \"abandonment of persons\", Articles 106–108 of the Argentine Penal Code, which includes the provision in Article 106 that \"a person who endangers the life or health of another, either by putting a person in jeopardy or ... will be imprisoned for between 2 and 6 years\" [emphasis added].\n\nIn Brazil, the Article 135(\"Omission for help\") of the Brazilian Penal Code states that: One who fails to provide medical assistance to an abandoned child (or lost) or invalid person (or harmed) who is in peril and no harm is present to himself (or herself), or does not call the public authority for help will be either imprisoned for a period ranging from one to six months or fined. The sentence is increased in half if the failure for help results in great personal injury and tripled if it results in death.\n\nIn Quebec, which makes use of civil law, there is a general duty to rescue in its Charter of Rights: \"Every human being whose life is in peril has a right to assistance...Every person must come to the aid of anyone whose life is in peril, either personally or calling for aid, by giving him the necessary and immediate physical assistance, unless it involves danger to himself or a third person, or he has another valid reason.\" Criminal law in Canada is under the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal government, so failure to comply with an article of the Charter in Quebec does not constitute a criminal offence except if by doing so a party also violates the Criminal Code.\n\nOther provinces follow common law.\n\nIn Canadian air law, it is mandatory to make oneself and one's aircraft available to aid search-and-rescue efforts if the aircraft is in the immediate area and a distress signal is received. \n\nUnder the Danish penal code, all persons must provide aid to the best of their ability to any person who appears to be lifeless or in mortal danger (§ 253), must alert authorities or take similar steps to prevent impending disasters that could cause loss of life (§ 185), must comply with all reasonable requests of assistance by a public authority when a person's life, health or well-being is at stake (§ 142), and must, if they learn of a planned crime against the state, human life or well-being, or significant public goods, do everything in their power to prevent or mitigate the crime, including but not limited to reporting it to authorities (§ 141), in all cases provided that acting would not incur particular danger or personal sacrifice.\nViolations are punishable by up to three months (§ 142), two years (§ 185 and § 253) or three years (§ 141) in prison.\n\nAnyone who fails to render assistance to a person in danger will be found liable before French Courts (civil and criminal liability). The penalty for this offence in criminal courts is imprisonment and a fine (under article 223–6 of the Criminal Code) while in civil courts judges will order payment of pecuniary compensation to the victims.\n\nThe photographers at the scene of the fatal car collision of Diana, Princess of Wales, were investigated for violation of the French law of \"non-assistance à personne en danger\" (failing to provide assistance to a person in danger), which can be punished by up to 5 years of imprisonment and a fine of up to €75,000.\n\nIn Germany, \"unterlassene Hilfeleistung\" (failure to provide assistance) is a crime under section 323(c) of the German Criminal Code: any person is obligated to provide assistance in case of an accident or general danger if necessary, and is normally immune from prosecution if assistance given in good faith and following the reasonable person's (aka ordinary prudent person's) understanding of required measures turns out to be harmful. Moreover, any individual who hinders a person who is providing or willing to provide assistance to another person in need can also be punished under the same section. Also, the rescuer or responder may not be held liable if the action they should take in order to help is unacceptable for them and they are unable to act (for example when unable to act at the sight of blood). In Germany, knowledge of basic emergency measures and certified attendance of a first aid and CPR course are prerequisites for being granted a driving license.\n\nIn Greece, a citizen is required by law to provide help to anyone who asks for it in case of a tragedy or public danger, as long as providing help does not endanger him or her personally. According to article 288 of the criminal code, not providing help in those cases can impose a prison sentence of up to 6 months.\n\nIn 1998, Israel enacted the “Stand-not-idly-by-thy-neighbor’s-blood Law”, taking its name from Leviticus 19:16. It requires one to render assistance whenever one is in the presence of a person who, due to some sudden occurrence, is in severe and immediate danger to life, limb or health, provided that one can do so without placing oneself or a third party in danger. Notifying the authorities (e.g. the police or fire department, as relevant) or calling on others who can render assistance for aid is considered “rendering assistance” under the law. A person obliged to render assistance who fails to do so can be fined.\n\nIn Russia, Article 125 of the criminal code prohibits knowingly abandoning people who are in life- or health-threatening situations when said people cannot help themselves. However it binds only those who are either legally obligated to care for said people or who themselves have put said people into life or health threatening situation. The maximum penalty is 1 year in prison.\n\nIn Serbia, a citizen is required by law to provide help to anyone in need (after for example a major car accident) as long as providing help does not endanger him or her personally. Serbian criminal code Articles 126 and 127 state that should one abandon a helpless person and/or not provide aid to a person in need, one could receive a prison sentence of up to one year. If the person dies of injuries due to no aid having been provided by the bystander, a sentence up to 8 years in prison can be imposed.\n\nIn Spain, a citizen is required by law to \"provide or seek\" help to anyone in need as long as providing help does not endanger him or her personally. Not doing so is a criminal offence under Article 195 of the Spanish Criminal Code.\n\nLegal requirements for a duty to rescue do not pertain in all nations, states, or localities. However, a moral or ethical duty to rescue may exist even where there is no legal duty to rescue. There are a number of potential justifications for such a duty.\n\nOne sort of justification is general and applies regardless of role-related relationships (doctor to patient; firefighter to citizen, etc.). Under this general justification, persons have a duty to rescue other persons in distress by virtue of their common humanity, regardless of the specific skills of the rescuer or the nature of the victim's distress.\n\nThese would justify cases of rescue and in fact make such rescue a duty even between strangers. They explain why philosopher Peter Singer suggests that if one saw a child drowning and could intervene to save him, they should do so, if the cost is moderate to themselves. Damage to their clothing or shoes or how late it might make them for a meeting would be insufficient excuse to avoid assistance. Singer goes on to say that one should also attempt to rescue distant strangers, not just nearby children, because globalization has made it possible to do so. Such general arguments for a duty to rescue also explain why after the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Haitians were digging family members, friends, and strangers out of the rubble with their bare hands and carrying injured persons to whatever medical care was available. They also explain why, while covering that same earthquake, journalist and physician Sanjay Gupta and a number of other MD-journalists began acting as physicians to treat injuries rather than remaining uninvolved in their journalistic roles. Similarly, they justify journalist Anderson Cooper's attempt to shepherd an injured young boy away from some \"toughs\" nearby in the aftermath of the Haiti earthquake.\n\nSpecific arguments for such a duty to rescue include, but are not limited to:\n\nThere are also ethical justifications for role-specific or skill-specific duties of rescue such as those described above under the discussion of U.S. Common Law. Generally, these justifications are rooted in the idea that the \"best\" rescues, the most effective rescues, are done by those with special skills. Such persons, when available to rescue, are thus even more required to do so ethically than regular persons who might simply make things worse (for a utilitarian, rescue by a skilled professional in a relevant field would maximize the good even better than rescue by a regular stranger). This particular ethical argument makes sense when considering the ability firefighters to get both themselves and victims safely out of a burning building, or of health care personnel such as physicians, nurses, physician's assistants, and EMTs to provide medical rescue.\n\nThese are some of the ethical justifications for a duty to rescue, and they may hold true for both regular citizens and skilled professionals even in the absence of legal requirements to render aid.\n\nIn an 1898 case, Buch v. Amory Mfg. Co., 69 N.H. 257, 44 A. 809, 1897 N.H. LEXIS 49 (N.H. 1898), the New Hampshire Supreme Court unanimously held that after an eight-year-old boy negligently placed his hand in the defendant's machinery, the boy had no right to be rescued by the defendant. Beyond that, the trespassing boy could be held liable for damages to the defendant's machine.\n\nIn the 1907 case People v. Beardsley, Beardsley's mistress, Blanche Burns, passed out after overdosing on morphine. Rather than seek medical attention, Beardsley instead had a friend hide her in the basement, and Burns died a few hours later. Beardsley was tried and convicted of manslaughter for his negligence. However, his conviction was reversed by the Supreme Court of Michigan saying that Beardsley had no legal obligation to her.\n\nSome states such as Minnesota, Vermont, and Rhode Island make it a misdemeanor offence if it is known that someone is in serious danger and someone can intervene safely or call 911 and they do not (Trinh, Li, 2015).\n\nIn 2016, an 83-year-old man collapsed in a bank lobby in Essen and later died. Several customers stepped over him without providing assistance. With the help of security camera footage, these customers were identified and sentenced to fines of several thousand euro each for failing to provide assistance. A customer who phoned emergency services was not indicted, as he was considered to have provided sufficient assistance.\n\n"}
{"id": "2044743", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2044743", "title": "KRRL", "text": "KRRL\n\nKRRL (92.3 FM) – branded as Real 92.3 – is a commercial Urban contemporary radio station licensed to Los Angeles, California, serving much of the Greater Los Angeles area. Owned by iHeartMedia, KRRL serves as the flagship for \"Big Boy's Neighborhood\". The KRRL studios are located in the Los Angeles suburb of Burbank, while the station transmitter resides on Mount Wilson. Besides a standard analog transmission, KRRL broadcasts over three HD Radio channels, and is available online via iHeartRadio.\n\nThe station first signed on the air on December 29, 1948, as KFAC-FM, the FM adjunct to KFAC (1330 AM). First owned by Errett Lobban Cord, a luxury vehicle manufacturer who purchased KFAC in 1931 from the Bible Institute of Los Angeles, KFAC became one of the first commercially operated radio stations in the United States to adopt a full-time fine arts/classical music format, having gradually added long-form programming devoted to the genre between 1938 and 1945. The station's longest-running program, the six-night-a-week \"Gas Company Evening Concert\", would enjoy a run on both KFAC—and later it and KFAC-FM—between October 1940 and September 1989. KFAC also slowly assembled an airstaff with unprecedented continuity and tenure, including, but not limited to: Thomas Cassidy, Fred Crane, Tom Dixon, Dick Crawford, Bill Carlson and Carl Princi, all six of which would be continuously employed by the station between 1953 and 1983.\n\nAt the time KFAC-FM was established, it generally simulcast KFAC's programming, but began to deviate from this to participate in a series of pseudo-stereo concert broadcasts with KFAC from the Hollywood Bowl Amphitheatre, starting in 1953. KFAC was fed the audio from a microphone pointed at one end of the Bowl, and KFAC-FM the audio from a microphone at the other end of the Bowl. Originally based at the transmitter site for KFAC in Los Angeles' Crenshaw district and operated at 104.3 MHz, the station moved to 92.3 MHz and the transmitter was moved to the top of Mount Wilson, both on July 1954, and was officially dedicated during a pseudo-stereo concert broadcast from the Bowl. Because KFAC-FM made this move to Mount Wilson prior to the FCC enacting limits for power output by FM stations in 1962, it is formally classified as a \"Superpower\" FM by operating at a maximum power level, but with the antenna being placed well above the height limit. These pseudo-stereo broadcasts were offered over both stations for 12 hours each week over the next decade, ending after KFAC-FM converted to a multiplexed signal in 1964.\n\nE.L. Cord sold KFAC and KFAC-FM to Cleveland Broadcasting Incorporated, founded by former Cleveland, Ohio mayor Raymond T. Miller, for a combined $2 million. Miller founded WERE (1300 AM) and WERE-FM (98.5) in Cleveland, and also owned WLEC and WLEC-FM in Sandusky, Ohio, and pledged to maintain KFAC's classical format. After Miller's 1966 death, the company was sold two years later to Atlantic States Industries, a McGarven-Guild Radio subsidiary, for a combined $9 million. A waiver was requested to keep both KFAC and KFAC-FM under common ownership due to an interim policy proposed by the FCC which would have prohibited it; after a public on-air solicitation of support from listeners yielded 15,000 letters, the waiver was granted, and the deal was approved in October 1969.\n\nKFAC and KFAC-FM ended their full-time simulcast on January 17, 1972; while both kept the same format and same airstaffs, KFAC-FM utilized a deeper playlist and broader spectrum of selections, while KFAC focused on more familiar selections and melodies, aiming to attract younger listeners. Both stations still simulcast core programming like \"Evening Concert\", \"Luncheon at the Lincoln Cente\"r, and \"Continental Classics\". The \"KFAC Listeners' Guild\" was established in 1970 supported by an annual $3 membership fee, providing listeners a chance to provide direct feedback to the station and its' operations, it boasted over 11,000 members after the first year.\n\nAn ownership transfer in 1986 attracted controversy after most of the tenured airstaff was dismissed on December 31, 1986. When KFAC was sold to Lotus Communications as the new home of KWKW (1300 AM) for $8.7 million on July 15, 1988, only five percent of KFAC and KFAC-FM's total audience listened to the AM frequency; the only deviation between both stations was the Brian Clewer-hosted \"Cynic's Choice\" that aired solely on KFAC. Days before that deal closed, on January 15, 1989, KFAC-FM was sold to Evergreen Media for $55 million, setting a record for the most expensive sale of a classical music outlet in the United States.\n\nDespite Evergreen head Scott Ginsberg telling \"Radio & Records\" that KFAC-FM's format would remain in place, industry analysis warned a format change would occur because of the debt incurred in purchasing the station. Speculation began to accelerate when KFAC-FM dropped format in early July—for only a few minutes—to carry part of a Rolling Stones press conference, then Evergreen took responsibility for a cryptic billboard taken on Sunset Boulevard reading, \"Pirate Radio, KLSX, KLOS: Get Ready to Move Over and Let the Big Dogs Eat!\" Jim de Castro, who was appointed as KFAC's general manager from Evergreen's WLUP (97.9 FM) in Chicago, later admitted he won free use of that billboard for a month as the result of a golf bet. Finally, Evergreen announced the donation of KFAC and KFAC-FM's music library, with roots dating back to the early 1940s and appraised at $1.8 million, to KUSC; Stanford University and the Los Angeles Public Library acquired KFAC's compact disc library, the majority of titles KUSC already held. KUSC was also presented with a $35,000 check and the rights to the KFAC calls, those would later be placed on a KUSC repeater in Santa Barbara.\n\nKFAC's demise attracted local and national attention, in part due to the longevity of the format and its presence in the nation's second largest radio market. A \"New York Times\" profile printed on the day of its' format change labeled KFAC \"a staple of Los Angeles's cultural life for 58 years\" and that it's switch was \"a sign of the times and perhaps of things to come as American cultural tastes evolve.\" Competing radio stations KPFK and KCRW both aired tribute programming to KFAC, and Mount Wilson FM Broadcasters' KKGO-FM announced that it would switch formats to classical on January 1990, with KKGO-FM's existing jazz format moving to KKGO (540 AM). KFAC's John Santana was hired by KKGO as a host, and revived the \"Gas Company Evening Concert\" the following March, with former KFAC announcer Tom Dixon as host. Meanwhile, Evergreen tried to capitalize on the attention the week of KFAC's switch by running television ads locally on \"L.A. Law\", the 1989 MTV Movie Awards, and \"The Arsenio Hall Show\" teasing the \"new\" format.\n\nAn outdoor event was staged outside of KFAC's studios (at the former Villa Capri restaurant on Hollywood's Yucca Street) at noon on September 20, 1989, to commemorate the end of the classical format; this was simulcast on KUSC, which—along with KFSD in San Diego—had placed advertising promoting themselves on KFAC. The hour began with Jim de Castro ceremoniously \"passing a baton\" to KUSC general manager Wallace Smith, then after a partially improvised farewell message from Rich Capparela, the hour concluded with KFAC-FM's final classical selection: Haydn's \"Farewell\" Symphony. After a moment of silence led by de Castro, the air signal switched to a heartbeat sound effect, while television monitors outside the studios started playing the television ad proclaiming the new format, accompanied by a skywriter scripting in the skies above \"It's Alive. FM-92\", but all reporters in attendance wound up focusing on KFAC instead.\n\nThe on-air heartbeat sound stunting would continue for the next 23 hours, interspersed with brief snippets of rock songs, ahead of the debut of KKBT the next day (September 21, 1989). Branded \"The New Beat FM 92\", the station offered a blend of adult rock, dance music, and adult contemporary. The first song under the new format was \"Walk on the Wild Side\" by Lou Reed. However, the format failed in the ratings; in the Winter 1990 ratings report for the market, KKBT was ranked 8th 12+, 10th in the 25-54 demographic, and 15th in overall cume. After less than five months, on February 3, 1990, the station switched to rhythmic adult contemporary, and rebranded as \"92.3 The Beat\". With the change, KKBT entered into direct format competition with KDAY (1580 AM), KJLH, KACE (103.9 FM), and KGFJ (1230 AM), although KKBT focused more on soul music/rhythm and blues selections. While the station attracted criticism for its aggressive on-air tactics, KKBT's ratings rose significantly after the switch; by the summer of that year, it evolved to a strictly urban AC format. By 1991, rap and hip-hop were being mixed in, and the station evolved to an urban contemporary format.\n\nAs an urban contemporary station, KKBT hit #1 a few times in the ratings. It competed aggressively with a hip-hop station on the 105.9 frequency, KPWR. During its tenure as \"The Beat\", the station featured many popular and legendary DJs who came from great stations like KPWR, KMEL, WQHT, KIIS-FM, and KDAY, like John London and \"The House Party\", a popular morning show which competed with other top local shows such as \"Mark and Brian\" on KLOS and Rick Dees on KIIS, DJ Theodore \"Theo\" Mizuhara, Eric Cubiche, Nautica De La Cruz, NWA's founder Dr. Dre and the World Class Wreckin' Cru, with Ronnie \"Big Ron\" O'Brien, Johnny \"Big John\" Monds, and Kevin Nash. Other shows included \"Westside Radio\", a weekly radio program dedicated to West Coast Hip-Hop (now airing on KDAY), and \"Street Soldiers\", a weekly program dedicated to community issues and politics. The station went by the slogan \"No Color Lines\", proudly championing the diversity of the region. It is believed that KKBT was inspired by KMEL and KDAY. During the 1990s, the station held a summer concert known as \"Summer Jam\", which featured major Hip-hop and R&B stars who performed at the Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre. In February 1996, sister station WYNY in New York City simulcasted KKBT for a day as part of a week-long stunt of simulcasting sister stations nationwide before changing formats to rhythmic adult contemporary as WKTU.\n\nIn a group deal in 1997, Evergreen merged with Chancellor. Chancellor acquired stations from other groups that exited the market. In 1999, Chancellor merged with Capstar and the company became AMFM, Incorporated.\n\nIn the fall of 1999, Clear Channel Communications and AMFM Inc. merged. This gave Clear Channel the five FM stations in LA and KIIS-FM which Clear Channel already owned. However, in order to get under the government-mandated market ownership limits, some stations were required to be spun off. One of the full powered FMs in Los Angeles had to go. KKBT's was the station chosen; it was sold to Radio One. However, Clear Channel wanted to keep the best possible signal and gave Radio One 100.3 FM. Leading up to the frequency swap, rumors swirled about whether 100.3's format would survive the move to 92.3 FM. Being that 100.3 was going to an African-American owned company known for urban formats, it seemed that \"The Beat\" would likely move to 100.3 intact. Much speculation led to 92.3 going active rock, possibly with the KMET calls. When the switch was made at 5 p.m. on June 30, 2000, the formats and call letters did come along for the ride, with 92.3 becoming KCMG, \"Mega 92.3\", and 100.3 becoming KKBT, \"100.3 The Beat\".\n\nThe station, now called \"Mega 92.3\", continued playing rhythmic oldies. On August 9, 2001, KCMG changed its call letters to KHHT, re-branded as \"Hot 92.3\", and shifted to more of an urban AC format. However, KHHT was not a typical urban AC station; this station was one of the first urban AC's to play more old school/classic soul, the more mainstream-level R&B (barely-to-not playing neo-soul at all) and some rhythmic and Latino pop/R&B songs to cater to the Hispanic and Asian audiences that listen to R&B music in particular. In this way, KHHT's playlist structure was the inspiration for other urban AC markets in the western half of the U.S. such as sister stations in KISQ San Francisco, KSYU Albuquerque, and KHYL Sacramento.\n\nKHHT was one of three urban ACs serving the Los Angeles market. The others were KRBV, (formerly KKBT, which changed from R&B/hip-hop in May 2006, but was sold by Radio One to Bonneville International in April 2008) and KJLH, whose signal is not full-power and barely penetrates the San Fernando Valley. In July 2006, it was announced that Art Laboe, a legendary oldies DJ in Los Angeles, would expand his syndicated show from weekend to weekdays, with KHHT as the flagship station. Laboe's move was interpreted as an attempt to expand the station's Hispanic audience as it competed with KRBV and KJLH, both of which were African-American owned, operated and targeting stations (only KJLH remains Black owned).\n\nHowever, by 2008, it became apparent that the over-saturation of Adult R&B stations in Los Angeles had made it difficult for three outlets to compete for the same audience. As a result of this, KHHT began to shift directions from an urban AC direction to rhythmic hot AC, allowing it to focus more on the Hispanic and Asian audience. It opened up its playlist to include current rhythmic hits. This move also opened up a new battle in the Los Angeles radio war, which found KHHT taking on another rhythmic AC, KMVN, whose direction was more focused on recurrents from the 1970s and 1980s, which also explained KHHT's decision to add currents to its playlist. KHHT's sister station KBIG-FM once had a rhythmic AC direction before shifting back to Hot AC in September 2007. The recent sale/format change of KRBV would've resulted in further tweakings at KHHT, but due to Arbitron's implementation of the Portable People Meter in the Los Angeles radio market and a move by its sister stations to adjust their formats to attract certain demos, KHHT decided to continue concentrating on attracting their Hispanic demos, where they feel more comfortable.\n\nAs of April 2009, KHHT once again became the only rhythmic adult contemporary in the market, as KMVN made a format change to Spanish. This move has prompted KHHT to further adjust its musical direction by adding more Disco and Freestyle tracks to its current format as a way to attract the displaced KMVN listeners, and by June 2009, it showed an increase in the PPM ratings after it began to further tweak its selection more to slightly favor currents and less favor Old School tracks. These latest changes at KHHT led to hints that it was moving towards adopting a current upbeat (and Dance-leaning) formula patterned after sister stations WKTU New York City, WMIA-FM Miami, and WISX Philadelphia. All three stations saw good rating numbers with this formula.\n\nIn November 2010, KHHT tweaked its direction again, shifting to a Gold-based rhythmic AC approach and reducing the number of currents being played on the station. Although it may have had elements of the former KCMG, KHHT had not tilted all the way back to rhythmic oldies or urban AC as most of the music are in line with other soft-leaning rhythmic Adult Contemporary outlets in nature.\n\nIn April 2011, KHHT fired morning host Victor Zaragoza (now at KBLX San Francisco). On April 20, the station announced that it would hire Rick Dees, who had hosted morning shows at sister station KIIS-FM and KMVN. At that time, the station dropped the \"and R&B\" from its slogan (to distance itself from playing current R&B or adult R&B product), effectively making the radio station a full-blown Gold-based rhythmic AC, with emphasis on rhythmic, disco, freestyle, and R&B hits from the 1970s, 80s, 90s, and 2000s. This same approach is also being used at sister stations KHJZ Honolulu, KFBT Fresno and WMOV-FM Norfolk, Virginia. The latter three are targeting Gen-Xers and concentrate on the latter two decades and play some currents in their presentation. Shortly after Dees arrived, KHHT shifted its format to a hybrid of rhythmic oldies and urban oldies, focusing mostly on urban rhythmic hits from 1970 to the mid-1990s, with some soul hits from the 1960s sprinkled into the mix. However, on July 3, 2012, a year after making a return to morning drive, Dees parted ways with KHHT due to a desire by station management to make some adjustments in its direction.\n\nOn February 5, 2015, iHeartMedia announced it was changing KHHT back to urban contemporary the following morning. The announcement came just a day after KHHT's HD3 sub-channel launched with Air 1 and just a few hours after KPWR's morning host Big Boy announced he would leave KPWR for KHHT. (Since then, he was served a lawsuit by KPWR's parent company Emmis Communications for breach of contract, thus preventing him from joining the station until his contract or his injunction was lifted; he would join the station on March 9.) Another reason for the change was the station's poor ratings performance; KHHT was ranked 14th in the market with a 2.5 share in the January 2015 PPM Nielsen radio ratings. The entire \"Hot\" airstaff was released (including Art Laboe, who would later end up on KDAY) on the same day as the announcement, as KHHT began promoting a \"major announcement\" at 9:23 a.m. the following morning, as well as airing a \"300 Greatest Hot Songs of All Time\" countdown. \n\nAt that time, after playing \"End of the Road\" by Boyz II Men, KHHT changed back to urban, branded as \"Real 92.3\", launching with \"10,000 joints in a row\", beginning with \"Only\" by Nicki Minaj. The change put 92.3 back in direct competition with KPWR and returned the urban format to the 92.3 FM frequency for the first time since the 2000 format swap with 100.3 FM. The change also returns the urban format to the market for the first time since 2006, when KKBT changed to urban AC as KRBV. On February 20, 2015, KHHT changed its call letters to KRRL to match the \"Real\" moniker.\n\nAs of August 2018, the American cable channel FM now carries an edited video simulcast of the station's morning show, \"Big Boy's Neighborhood\", weeknights and mornings.\n\nThe HD2 subchannel carries an all \"slow jams\" urban AC format, former station personality R Dub! programs the playlist. The HD3 subchannel relays KTLW in Lancaster, which carries Educational Media Foundation's Air1 format; the subchannel acts as a programming source to a network of analog translators throughout the southern portion of Los Angeles and Orange Counties.\n\nThe station was one of 10 stations awarded the 2007 Crystal Radio Award for public service awarded by the National Association of Broadcasters. Winners were honored at the Radio Luncheon on April 17, 2007, during the NAB Show in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\n\n"}

She was surrendered to the USSR in 1946 as war reparation and renamed after the early 19th century Baltic German explorer in Russian service, Adam Johann Krusenstern (1770–1846). She is now a Russian sail training ship.\n\nOf the four remaining Flying \"P-Liners\", the former \"Padua\" is the only one still in use, mainly for training purposes, with her home ports in Kaliningrad (formerly Königsberg) and Murmansk. After , another former German ship, she is the largest traditional sailing vessel still in operation.\n\nLaunched in 1926 as the last of the \"P-Liners\", \"Padua\" was commissioned as a cargo ship, used among other things to ship construction material to Chile, South America, returning with saltpeter around Cape Horn. Later she transported wheat from Australia. Her maiden voyage from Hamburg to Talcahuano, Chile took 87 days. In 1933–1934 she took a record-breaking 67 days from Hamburg to Port Lincoln in South Australia. Prior to World War II she made 15 long trips to Chile and Australia. Her fastest voyage was in 1938–1939, from Hamburg \"via\" Chile to Australia and back to Hamburg in 8 months and 23 days under Captain Richard Wendt — a world record voyage for tall ships that has never been broken.\n\nLike all \"P-liners\", \"Padua\" was painted according to the colours of the German national flag of the German Empire era: black (hull above water, topsides), white (waterline area) and red (underwater body).\n\nOn 12 January 1946 she was surrendered to the USSR and integrated into the Baltic Fleet of the Soviet Navy. She was moored in Kronstadt harbour until 1961 where she underwent major repairs and a refit (\"e.g.\" the installation of her first engines) for her missions for the Hydrographic Department of the Soviet Navy. From 1961 to 1965 she undertook many hydrographic and oceanographical surveys for the Academy of Sciences of the USSR in the Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean, and Mediterranean, and was used as a training vessel for naval cadets. In 1965 she was transferred to the USSR Ministry of Fisheries in Riga to be used as a schoolship for future fishery officers.\n\nFrom 1968 to 1972 a major modernisation took place, installing her current set of engines and applying her current hull paint – black with a wide white stripe with black rectangles intended to give the illusion of gunports.\n\"Kruzenshtern\" led the international procession of tall ships into New York Harbor for Operation Sail on 4 July 1976.\n\nIn January 1981 she was transferred to the \"Estonian Fisheries Industry\" at Tallinn and in 1991 she became part of the \"State Baltic Academy of the Fisheries\" fleet with her new home port in Kaliningrad.\n\n\"Kruzenshtern\" takes part in many international regattas. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union funding became a problem, so passengers are carried for that purpose. In 1995–96 she circumnavigated the world in the trail of her namesake. She again sailed around the world in 2005–06 to commemorate the 200th anniversary of Krusenstern's circumnavigation.\n\nThe ship was used in three German films — \"Die Meuterei auf der Elsinore\" (1935); \"Herz geht vor Anker\" (1940) and \"Große Freiheit Nr. 7\" (1944), as well as a number of Russian and Soviet films.\nIn 1997 she was the main subject of an Estonian/British documentary produced by Allfilm and First Freedom Productions called 'Tall Ship' and transmitted on Discovery. The one-hour programme was directed by Rein Kotov and produced by Graham Addicott and Pille Runk.\n\nOn 23 June 2009 while she was \"en route\" to the Charleston, South Carolina Harborfest, her foremast was damaged in a storm off Bermuda when the sail backed and snapped the mast.\n\nOn 3 May 2010 she stopped in Bremerhaven after a trip of five months with stops in Vancouver for the 2010 Winter Olympics and in Cuba, after which she returned to Kaliningrad. On 4 August 2014, \"Kruzenshtern\" sank the tug \"Diver Master\" at Esbjerg, Denmark when a line between the two vessels failed to release. On 11 June 2015, she rammed the two Icelandic Coastguard patrol ships and . Both vessels sustained damage. On 27 June, she ran aground at Archangelsk. She was refloated that day.\n\n\"Padua\" is shown in the German film \"Große Freiheit Nr. 7\" from 1944 as the ship on which the main actor signs up at the end.\n\nAlong with STS Mir, the ship has been one of the main attractions during the Norwegian Constitution Day celebration in Larvik, Vestfold. The ship is usually docked at the main pier and the crew joins the citizens' and children's parade through the city.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2044745", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2044745", "title": "Went the Day Well?", "text": "Went the Day Well?\n\nWent the Day Well? is a 1942 British war film adapted from a story by Graham Greene and directed by Alberto Cavalcanti. It was produced by Michael Balcon of Ealing Studios and served as unofficial propaganda for the war effort. It tells of how an English village is taken over by German paratroopers. It reflects the greatest potential nightmare of many Britons of the time, although the threat of German invasion had largely receded by that point.\n\nThe story is told in flashback by a villager, played by Mervyn Johns, as though to a person visiting after the war. He recounts: one Saturday during the Second World War, a group of seemingly authentic British soldiers arrive in the small, fictitious English village of Bramley End. It is the Whitsun weekend so life is even quieter than usual and there is almost no traffic of any kind. At first they are welcomed by the villagers, until doubts begin to grow about their true purpose and identity. After they are revealed to be German soldiers intended to form the vanguard of an invasion of Britain, they round up the residents and hold them captive in the local church. The vicar is shot while sounding the church bell in alarm.\n\nIn attempts to reach the outside world, many of the villagers take action. Such plans include writing a message on an egg and giving them to the local paper boy for his mother, but they are crushed when Mrs Fraser's cousin runs over them. Mrs Fraser then puts a note in Cousin Maude's pocket, but she uses it to hold her car window in place; her dog, Edward, then chews it to shreds after it blows onto the back seat. Mrs Collins, the postmistress, manages to kill a German with an axe used for chopping firewood, and tries to telephone for help, but the girls on the telephone exchange see her light and decide that she can wait. Mrs Collins waits, and is killed by another German who walks into the shop. The girl at the exchange then picks up the phone, but gets no response.\n\nThe captive civilians attempt to contact and warn the local Home Guard, but are betrayed by the village squire, who is revealed to be a long-time collaborator with the Germans. Members of the local Home Guard are ambushed and shot by the Germans. A young boy, George, escapes from the church. He is shot in the leg by a German, but manages to alert the British army. British soldiers arrive, and – aided by some of the villagers, including a group of Women's Land Army girls, who have managed to escape, barricade themselves in, and arm themselves – defeat the Germans after a short battle. The squire is shot dead by the vicar's daughter, who discovers his treachery as he attempts to let the Germans into the barricaded house. During the battle, many of the villagers who left to fight are wounded or killed; Mrs Fraser saves the children from a grenade, at the cost of her own life, and Tom's father is shot in the arm and wrenches his ankle as he falls. The British troops then arrive at Bramley End and all ends well.\n\nThe villager retelling the story to the camera shows the Germans' grave in the churchyard and explains proudly: \"Yes, that's the only bit of England they got.\"\n\nThe film's title is based on an epitaph written by the classical scholar John Maxwell Edmonds. It originally appeared in \"The Times\" on 6 February 1918 entitled \"Four Epitaphs\".\n\n\"Went the day well\" also appeared in an unidentified newspaper cutting in a scrapbook now held in the RAF Museum (AC97/127/50), and in a collection of First World War poems collated by Vivian Noakes.\nThis was the first significant role of Thora Hird's career, and one of the last for C. V. France.\nExterior scenes were shot on location in the village of Turville in Buckinghamshire. \n\nThe film reinforced the message that civilians should be vigilant against fifth columnists and that \"careless talk costs lives\". It was based on a short story by the author Graham Greene entitled \"The Lieutenant Died Last\". By the time the film was released the threat of invasion had subsided somewhat, but it was still seen as an effective piece of propaganda, and its reputation has grown over the years. It has been noted that by opening and closing in a predicted future where not only had the war been won but a (fictitious) full-scale German invasion of Britain defeated, and by presenting a scenario where all echelons of British society unite for the common good (the lady of the manor sacrifices herself without hesitation, for example), the film's message was morale-boosting and positive rather than scaremongering. Anthony Quinn, a film critic for \"The Independent on Sunday\", commented in 2010: \"It subtly captures an immemorial quality of English rural life—the church, the local gossip, the sense of community—and that streak of native 'pluck' that people believed would see off Hitler\".\n\nIn 2005 it was named as one of the \"100 Greatest War Films\" in a poll by Britain's Channel 4. The 1975 book, \"The Eagle Has Landed\", and the later film use some of the same ideas.\n\nIn July 2010, StudioCanal and the British Film Institute National Archive released a restoration of the \"Went the Day Well?\" to significant critical acclaim. Tom Huddleston of \"Time Out\" termed it \"jawdroppingly subversive. Cavalcanti establishes, with loving care and the occasional wry wink, the ultimate bucolic English scene, then takes an almost sadistic delight in tearing it to bloody shreds in an orgy of shockingly blunt, matter-of-fact violence.\" When the restored film opened at Film Forum in New York City in 2011, A.O. Scott of \"The New York Times\" called it \"undeservedly forgotten... [H]ome-front propaganda has rarely seemed so cutthroat or so cunning.\"\n\nThe film was released on a Manufactured-on-Demand DVD on 9 July 2015.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2044749", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2044749", "title": "Tropical Hockey League", "text": "Tropical Hockey League\n\nThe Tropical Hockey League was an ice hockey league in Miami, Florida. The league had four teams, all based in Miami, and lasted for only one season, 1938–39, before folding. It was notable as the first attempt to establish professional hockey in Florida or the South in general, though it ultimately had no impact on popularizing the sport in the region.\n\nThe Tropical Hockey League was established as an attempt to introduce ice hockey to the Southern United States. The league consisted of four teams: the Coral Gables Seminoles, the Miami Clippers, Miami Beach Pirates, and the Havana Tropicals, all of which played at the Metropolitan Ice Palace in Miami. With three exceptions the players were all Canadians recruited from camps in Port Colborne, Ontario and Winnipeg, Manitoba. One notable figure was Mike Goodman, a former member of the Winnipeg Falcons who won the gold medal in hockey for Canada in the 1920 Summer Olympics; he served the Seminoles as player-coach.\n\nThe league's inaugural game, billed as \"the first hockey game ever staged in the south\", was played between the Clippers and Pirates on December 10, 1938. It was preceded by demonstrations of the sport by the players and featured a mambo concert after the second period. The game ended with a fight following a 4-3 victory by the Clippers. Newspapers of the time (including the Miami Herald and the AP report) list the final score of the first game as 3-2. It seems as if the Miami News printed the wrong score on December 11, 1938. In subsequent reports the Miami News switches to 3-2 being the final. The Tropical Hockey League made it through a 15-game season in 1938-39. However, it failed to attract much interest from the community due to its late start times, weak competition, and a tendency for games to devolve into fighting, and folded at the end of the season.\n\nThe Tropical Hockey League experiment did nothing to popularize hockey in the South. There would be no further attempt to establish professional hockey in the region until 1956, when the Eastern Hockey League placed the Charlotte Clippers, later the Charlotte Checkers, in Charlotte, North Carolina. Florida did not get another hockey team until the Jacksonville Rockets joined the EHL in 1964. From 1992–1995 there was another minor hockey league based in Florida, the Sunshine Hockey League.\n\n\n"}

Basic Tasar Silkworm Seed Organisation (BTSSO) under the Central Silk Board, Government of India collects, executes the production and supply of nucleus and basic Tasar seed from surrounding areas.\n\nBilaspur has been selected as one of the 100 Indian villages to be developed as a smart city under the Smart Cities Mission.\n\nHistorically, Bilaspur was controlled by the Kalachuri dynasty of Ratanpur. The city, however, came into prominence around 1741, the year of the Maratha Empire rule, when a Maratha official took up his abode there.\n\nThe management of Bilaspur district was taken over by the British East India Company in 1818 after Bhosale lost territory in Third Anglo-Maratha War. Under Bhosale of the Nagpur kingdom there were many subedars or zamindars/landlords like Akbar Khan, Vazeer Khan, Sao and others in Bilaspur.\n\nBilaspur district was constituted in 1861, followed by Bilaspur municipality in 1867. Famines in the Bilaspur district were recorded by the British administration in 1828–9, 1834–5, 1845–6, 1868–9 and 1899–1900. In 1868-9 and 1899–1900, the rains failed almost completely, resulting in severe distress, migration and desertion of villages. After the 1868-9 famine there was prosperity for the next 25 years; but in 1895 there was a very poor harvest, followed in 1896 by a complete failure of crops, and severe famine continued throughout 1897. In that year the mortality rate was as high as one in six people. The famine of 1897 was followed by two favorable years; but in 1899 the monsoon failed completely and the rice crop was wholly destroyed.\n\nGuru Ghasidas (1756–1836) started a religious movement, Satnamis (meaning the worshippers of Satnam), between 1820 and 1830 primarily around the Sonakhan forests. This religious movement preached against idol-worship, and instead stressed that God is synonymous with truth. His community was a farming community.

Referred to as the \"Rice Bowl of India\", Bilaspur abounds in lush greenery and boasts of a myriad number of tourist attractions. If the historical records are to be given any credence, then there is no reason to disbelieve the fact that Bilaspur owes its name to a fisherwoman, Bilasa in the 17th century.

According to the census conducted in 1901, the total population of Bilaspur was somewhere around 18,937 and it was considered the 8th largest town in the Central Provinces of British India.

There are approx. 500 rice and dall mills in the surrounding area.\nBilaspur (South East Central Railway) is the highest revenue generating railway zone in India among 17 zones. The Bilaspur railways zone comprises the divisions of Bilaspur, Nagpur and Raipur. South Eastern Coalfields Limited (SECL), a subsidiary of Public Sector Unit Coal India Limited (CIL) – A Maharatna Company, is situated with headquarters at Bilaspur. SECL is a Miniratna PSU under the Ministry of Coal, with several awards in its credentials including best PSU award in 1997–98. An integrated action plan for development of civic infrastructure, including hi-tech water purifier system, proper drainage facilities and cleanliness, is being planned by the state government for cities and towns, while the proposed 'Arpa Project' would give a new life to the city of Bilaspur, minister for urban administration and health Amar Agrawal said in an interview to the \"Times of India\", a leading newspaper of India. The State Government has drawn up an ambitious plan of Rs2,000 crore to develop the Arpa river bank in Bilaspur district during the next seven years. For this, the Government has constituted a ‘Special Area Development Authority’ (SADA) for the development of the Arpa river bank near Bilaspur city.\n\nThe Government has invited proposals from interested national and international institutions for the development of the river bank on a PPP model. The Authority has prepared a project for the development of the river and is now in search of organisations that would be interested in developing the river on a Public Private Partnership (PPP).\n\nAccording to SADA, about 653 hectares of area on the banks of the river would be developed. This area is 13.4 km in length. Commercial, residential, entertainment and other institutional facilities would be developed in this area. On both the sides of the river, 13.4-km-long retaining wall, houses and commercial complexes would be constructed, besides bridge, roads and walkways. Water supply, sewerage, drainage, electricity supply would be provided in the area.\n\nThe estimated cost of all the works is Rs2,000 crore. The development works would be taken up in phases during the next seven years.\n\nOf the total 653-hectare area, some of the land is owned privately. In lieu of acquisition of private land, the affected people would be given land at other areas. After development about 267 hectares of land will be made available for sale. By selling this land, the developer could recover the invested amount. The downtown is called Gol Bazaar (Circular Market). Gol Bazaar, Sadar Bazaar and company Garden Chowk are buzzing and vibrant but overcrowded with slow-moving traffic. In contrast there are some newly developed areas as well. The Vyapar Vihar is a newly developed commercial and goods transport area. Bilaspur has Chhattisgarh's first hi-tech bus stand at Bodri.\n\nIt has the High Court of Chhattisgarh which is Asia's largest court (in area).\n\nThe census has been taken from Hari Bhoomi Bilaspur Bhaskar Edition dated 23/12/2013.\n\n"}

Bilaspur city is the headquarters of the district. As of 2011 it is the second most populous district of Chhattisgarh (out of 27), after Raipur .\n\nThe name of the district derived from the city of Bilaspur, the administrative headquarter of the district. The name \"Bilaspur\" originated from Bilasa Devi, a fisherwoman who founded this city, according to a legend.\n\nBilaspur district is situated between 21º47' and 23º8' north latitudes and 81º14' and 83º15' east longitudes. The district is bounded by Korriya on the north, Anuppur District and Dindori District of Madhya Pradesh state on the west, Kawardha on the southwest, Durg and Raipur on the south and Korba and Janjgir-Champa on the east. The area of the district is 6377 km². Bilaspur is officially the judicial and cultural capital of Chhattisgarh and also boosts various cultural and social events. The district is also an important educational and medical hub of Chhattisgarh due to several world class hospitals for example: Apollo Hospital. Education at the primary and higher level has been considerably improving in the past decade due to the opening of several international standard schools ranging from D.A.V. Public School, Delhi Public School, San Francis H/S School, St. Xavier's H/S School, Maharishi Vidya Mandir and The Jain International School). The city has been also witnessing high rate of infrastructural growth for past few years due to the several initiatives taken by the state government to improve the basic infrastructure of the city. Today, the city has two developed shopping malls (Rama Magneto Mall and 36 \nCity Mall) which attract a large number of crowd especially the youth from all over the state. \n\nThe area which comprises present-day Bilaspur District was under the control of the Bhonsla Rajas of Nagpur until 1818 and was governed by a Maratha 'Subah' (district officer). In 1818, the British started administering the area on behalf of the Raghuji III, who was minor. The area was administered by a commissioner. In 1853, after the death of Raghuji III, British annexed the Nagpur Kingdom to British India as Nagpur Province, and in 1861 when the new Central Provinces was born, Bilaspur was organized into a separate district. In October 1903, a new province ‘The Central Provinces and Berar’ was constituted and Bilaspur District became a part of the Chhattisgarh Division of the province. In October 1905, on transfer of Sambalpur District to Bengal Province, Chandrapur-Padampur and Malkhurda estates were transferred to Bilaspur District. In 1906, when the Drug district (presently Durg District) was formed, a part of the Mungeli Tahsil was transferred to the new district. Also, another part of the district was transferred to the Raipur District. On 25 May 1998, the original Bilaspur District was split into 3 smaller districts, present Bilaspur, Korba and Janjgir-Champa.\n\nIn 2012, seeing the bad condition of the development of roads and other amenities, youth of the city joined together on social networking sites to form a group named 'Concern 4 Bilaspur' to try to take every citizen's attention towards the scenario and finding solutions to solve them.\n\nBilaspur Division consists of six districts\n\n1.Bilaspur\n\n2.Korba\n\n3.raigarh\n\n4.janjgir-champa\n\n5.mungeli\n\n6.gaurela-pendra-marwahi\n\nBilaspur district consists of 8 tehsils. \n\nThese tehsils are\n\nBilaspur, Gaurella, Pendra Road, Marwahi, Kota, Takhatpur, Bilha and Masturi. The total number of villages in the district is 1635.\n\nThe headquarters of the district is Bilaspur. It is the second largest city in the state and the seat of the High Court of Chhattisgarh. It is called the \"Nyaydhani\" (judicial capital) of Chhattisgarh. Bilaspur has the famous Kanan Pendari Zoo Park. Arpa is a river passing through the district, it very shallow in depth but does creates havoc during rains.\n\nBilaspur is the headquarters of South Eastern Coalfields, the largest and most profitable subsidiary of Coal India. The district of Bilaspur also has the largest number of cement factories in the state consisting of manufacturers such as Lafarge, Century, ACC. etc. The Bilaspur railway zone has been fifth time in a row awarded as the most profitable railway zone by the ministry of Indian railways this year. The district is also well connected to the rest of the country by means of rail and road network hence improving the economy of the city. The city's main commercial hub is Vyapar Vihar, Telipara, Link Road, Sepath Road, Bus Stand Road, Rajiv Plaza and Goal Bazar. Bilaspur is also the Regional Headquarters of Chhattisgarh State Electricity Board, headed by Chief Engineer (BR). The Chief Engineer (BR) has the jurisdiction of Bilaspur, Korba, Janjgir-Champa and Raigarh Districts for supply of electricity to all LT and HT consumers. After Regional Headquarters of Raipur of CSEB, the Bilaspur is the second largest jurisdiction for supply of electricity in Chhattisgarh State.\n\nAs an industrial city, Bilaspur also receives a large number of business travelers from within India and other countries, which requires the city to have good hotels. There are many hotels in Bilaspur, however the very first notable hotel and the only international brand hotel 'Courtyard by Marriott' opened in April 2014. The hotel is located near Mangla Chowk and is next to Citymall 36, a prominent shopping destination in the city. All Bilaspur's other hotels are locally run standalone units and although they do not offer high quality, they are relatively inexpensive.\n\nBilaspur has the zonal office of South East Central Railway, the 16th zone of Indian Railway which is recognized to have the maximum loading. The city is very well connected to rest of the country through good road and rail network. The city falls in the Mumbai Kolkata rail network. The Bilaspur railway station is the most important railway station in the state from where several trains for different parts of the country originate. The District Administration and Municipal Corporation of Bilaspur City are forming a joint venture, to operate world class City Bus services in Bilaspur City by the end of 2007. However autorickshaw rules the road.\n\nAccording to the 2011 census, Bilaspur district, Chhattisgarh has a population of 2,663,629, roughly equal to the nation of Kuwait or the US state of Nevada. This ranks it 152nd in India (out of a total of 640). The district has a population density of . Its population growth rate over the decade 2001-2011 was 33.21%. Bilaspur has a sex ratio of 972 females for every 1000 males, and a literacy rate of 71.59%.\n\nAt the time of the 2011 Census of India, 96.53% of the population in the district spoke Chhattisgarhi, 0.70% Odia, 0.54% Bengali and 0.42% Telugu as their first language.\n\nLanguages spoken include Agariya, an Austroasiatic tongue with approximately 72,000 speakers; Bagheli, a language lexically similar to Hindi and is spoken by about 7,800,000 people in Bagelkhand; and Bharia, a Dravidian language spoken by at least 200,000 members of the Bharia tribe and written in the Devanagari script.\n\nThis district has Achanakmar Wildlife Sanctuary.\n\n"}

The ruling dynasty were Chandel Rajputs, who claimed descent from the rulers of Chanderi in present-day Madhya Pradesh. The town of Bilaspur was founded in 1663. The state later became a princely state of British India, and was under the authority of the British province of Punjab.\n\nOn 13 May 1665, Guru Tegh Bahadur went to Bilaspur to attend the mourning and funeral ceremonies for Raja Dip Chand of Bilaspur. Rani Champa of Bilaspur made an offer to the Guru of a piece of land in her state, which the Guru accepted at the cost of 500 rupees. The land consisted of the villages of Lodhipur, Mianpur, and Sahota. Guru Tegh Bahadur broke ground on a new settlement on 19 June 1665, which he named Nanaki after his mother.\n\nIn 1932, the state became part of the newly created Punjab States Agency, and in 1936 the Punjab Hill States Agency was separated from the Punjab States Agency. On 12 October 1948 the local ruler, Raja Sir Anand Chand, acceded to the Government of India.\n\nBilaspur became a separate state of India under a chief commissioner, and on 1 July 1954, Bilaspur State was made a district of Himachal Pradesh state by an act of the Indian Parliament. When the Sutlej River was dammed to create the Govind Sagar, the historic town of Bilaspur was submerged, and a new town was built upslope of the old.\n\nBilaspur is located at , with an average elevation of . It lies at the foot of the Bandla Hills, near the reservoir of Govind Sagar on the Sutlej River. It is the first major town after entering Himachal Pradesh on the way to Manali.\n\nBilaspur experiences warm summers and cool winters but is protected from the temperature extremes of the surrounding mountains by its situation in a valley. The monsoon, from July to September, is a period of high rainfall. From October to November, the lake is completely full. The highest temperature months are May and June when the temperature is typically around and , sometimes exceeding .\n\nAs of the 2001 Indian census, Bilaspur had a population of 13,058.

{"id": "2044781", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2044781", "title": "Slimer", "text": "Slimer\n\nSlimer is a character from the \"Ghostbusters\" franchise. He appears in the films \"Ghostbusters\" (1984), \"Ghostbusters II\" (1989), \"\" (2021) and the remake \"Ghostbusters\" (2016), in the animated television series: \"The Real Ghostbusters\", \"Slimer!\" and \"Extreme Ghostbusters\", and in the video games \"\" and Beeline's \"Ghostbusters\". Slimer was voiced by Ivan Reitman and Adam Ray in the films and by Frank Welker in the animated series. In \"The Real Ghostbusters\", he is the Ghostbusters' mascot and friend (unlike the films, where he is just a ghost who needs to be busted).\n\nDuring the pre-production of \"Ghostbusters\", Ivan Reitman remarked Slimer was sort of like Bluto in the film \"Animal House\", like the ghost of John Belushi. Since then, Slimer has been described as \"The Ghost of John Belushi\" by Dan Aykroyd in many interviews.\n\nIn the script for \"Ghostbusters\", Slimer is never actually called by any name, so is never given one. The creature's original moniker was simply \"The Onionhead Ghost\", which the film crew semi-officially dubbed him because of the horrible odor which he uses to scare a couple in a scene cut from the original movie. In early drafts, Slimer was vaguely described as an 'incredibly foul-smelling amorphous vapor'. In July 1983, the final design came along and the 'green, potato-shape' was incorporated into the script. In total, three large scale Onionhead ghosts were created, each with a different expression and/or task. One was for smiling, one was for looking scared, and one was for drinking. A miniature was made for long shots of it flying around the hotel chandelier but it was not used. The Onionhead form was cast in the form of a foam latex suit but actual expressions were done with cable mechanisms.\n\nFor the live action set, in the scene where Ray spooks Slimer, a room service cart trailed after him. The cart was motorized and piloted from underneath by one of Chuck Gaspar's crew. Naturally, when the cart crashes, the driver is not present. The shot of Slimer phasing through the wall was shot at Entertainment Effects Group and incorporated optically later on.\n\nDuring effects photography, the suit was worn by Mark Wilson. Wilson's legs were concealed with black velvet. A team of puppeteers dealt with facial expressions. Wilson worked with oversized props so the ghost would appear smaller after composited into live action.\n\nSlimer was not always a definite part of the \"Ghostbusters II\" script. It was a matter of considerable debate if he should appear at all. Slimer's appeal, luckily, was very universal among children thanks in part to the first movie and \"The Real Ghostbusters\". Slimer was given a subplot and written into movie - Slimer would eat various foods in the Firehouse while Louis Tully would try to trap him then they would become friends. Michael Gross requested elements of the animated version of Slimer to be incorporated into the movie. Tim Lawrence and Thom Enriquez worked on a new design. Meanwhile, Bobby Porter was called into portray Slimer. Some of the technology and techniques used for Nunzio Scoleri were used for Slimer - the divided head construct, pneumatic jaws, SNARK and a fat suit - a departure from the first movie where he was hand puppeteered. Then Slimer was removed from the script. Porter was released.\n\nTwo weeks later, Slimer was back in the script and had a bigger role. However, Porter was no longer available. Effects coordinator Ned Gorman remembered working with Robin Navlyt on \"Willow\" and she was brought in. Surprisingly, she was the same height as Porter and fit into the suit very well. Chris Goehe and his mold shop crew made a full lifecast on her and Al Coulter worked on a new skullcap. The Slimer shoot was finished close to the first day of shooting. Michael Gross was onhand to push the crew to keep Slimer subtle and reduce any complicated approaches to moving him. Slimer's segments were deemed intrusive by preview audiences. During editing, Ivan Reitman decided to limit Slimer's role even though all scripted scenes were filmed and completed. Ultimately, Slimer's scenes were trimmed to two brief shots plus one during the end titles.\n\nIn the script for \"Ghostbusters\", and in the film itself, Slimer is never actually called by any name (the term \"slimers\" is used to identify a kind of ghost). The creature was called \"The Onionhead Ghost\" by the film crew, and in the film's closing credits, Steve Johnson is credited as the sculptor for \"Onionhead\". Slimer was marketed as \"the Green Ghost\" in initial merchandise for \"The Real Ghostbusters\". When the cartoon series was produced, and in response to the name much given to the character by audiences, the writers renamed the green ghost \"Slimer\", and the name stuck on all subsequent \"Ghostbusters\" properties, including \"Ghostbusters II\" and \"Ghostbusters: Answer the Call\", despite the character never actually being referred to as Slimer within either film. Although Slimer was referred to as \"The Green Ghost\" early in the related toy line, in later releases of his first figure, an extra label was applied specifying \"\"Known as 'Slimer' in the Real Ghostbusters TV show\"\".\n\nThe in-narrative explanation for Slimer's name was revealed in the eleventh episode of \"The Real Ghostbusters\", \"Citizen Ghost\" (first broadcast on November 22, 1986). A flashback depicting how the Ghostbusters made friends with Slimer reveals the ghost was so nicknamed by Ray Stantz.\n\nThroughout the first film, Slimer appears to lack intelligence, only caring about gaining food to eat. In the second movie, Slimer appears more fat and more intelligent, and could drive a bus (Louis wonders who gave him a license). Slimer is shown to be caring in \"The Real Ghostbusters\", showing compassion from Ray Stantz, and kissing Janine. The 2016 reboot features a different incarnation of Slimer, who savages a hot dog cart and, after an attack by the Ghostbusters, steals the Ecto-1 to go on a joyride with his girlfriend, Lady Slimer, and other ghosts.\n\nHis origins in the original timeline were explained by the Marvel UK comic book \"The Real Ghostbusters\" #22. It is explained that he was King Remils (\"Slimer\" backwards), an obese king who died of heart failure, while a deleted scene from the 2016 \"Ghostbusters\" film was meant to expand on Slimer's rebooted continuity origins: when he was alive, Slimer was a gangster who killed a restaurant waiter that got his order wrong, resulting in his imprisonment and execution. After his death, the Ghostbusters encounter him haunting the same restaurant, but due to the experimental nature of their equipment, they inadvertently disfigure him, destroying his legs and turning him green, before he escapes.\n\nVoiced by Ivan Reitman, Slimer (not named until \"The Real Ghostbusters\") was a legendary ghost to all on the original staff of the Sedgewick Hotel. His usual territory was the twelfth floor, but his outings were usually non-violent and simply involved gorging himself on food from room service carts. As a result, the hotel was able to keep a lid on the supernatural problems for a while. For some reason, Gozer's approaching time of arrival provoked Slimer (and many other ghosts) into being much more active than usual. Eventually the staff could no longer keep the ghost a secret and called the Ghostbusters. However, the team had not yet fully tested their equipment and were not completely prepared for a full capture. Ray Stantz attempted to hold Slimer by himself, but the ghost escaped through a wall, charged at Peter Venkman, and covered him in ectoplasmic residue.\n\nSlimer fled into the hotel's Alhambra Ballroom, where the Ghostbusters successfully caught and trapped him after causing extensive property damage. Stantz loaded him into the team's storage facility as a demonstration for Winston Zeddemore after the latter was hired to work for them. He and all the other captured ghosts were released when Walter Peck ordered the facility to be shut down. Slimer took refuge in a hot dog cart soon afterward, surprising the vendor greatly upon opening it. After the defeat of Gozer, the film's closing credits begin over scenes of the Ghostbusters being celebrated by the citizens of New York City. The last shot of the film is Slimer flying towards the screen, after which the film cuts to black and the remainder of the credits roll.\n\nAgain voiced by Ivan Reitman, and now officially known as Slimer (due to the popularity \"The Real Ghostbusters\"), Slimer first appears in \"Ghostbusters II\" when Louis Tully caught Slimer eating his lunch, to which the two of them fled in fear from one another. In a deleted scene set between the scene with Dana's bathtub and the scene with Dana and Venkman going out for dinner (mentioned in the novelization), Louis attempts to catch Slimer using a Proton Pack by baiting him with fried chicken.\n\nLater in the film, on New Year's Eve, Louis decides to take up a Proton Pack and help the Ghostbusters. In an attempt to patch up their initial misunderstanding, Slimer helped an exhausted Louis by giving him a ride to the Manhattan Museum of Art (to which Louis wonders how he got a license to drive a bus).\n\nSlimer appears in the 2016 film \"Ghostbusters: Answer the Call\", voiced by Adam Ray and puppeteered by Ronald Binion (who fit into the Slimer suit) and Rick Lazzarini (who operated Slimer's facial controls). After Rowan North unleashes an army of ghosts upon New York City, the Ghostbusters see a green glow coming from a hot dog stand, and find Slimer inside. Slimer promptly hijacks the Ecto-1 and rides off. The Ghostbusters are unable to stop him. Slimer is later seen driving the Ecto-1 around New York City and several of his ghostly friends. While the original Slimer was created as an androgynous blob with no gender defining characteristics, \"Ghostbusters: Answer the Call\" introduces a female \"Lady Slimer\" character with red lipstick and a bow tie in her blonde hair. The Ghostbusters later cause both Slimers to crash the Ecto-1 into the portal to cause \"Total Protonic Reversal\" and close the portal.\n\nAfter the Ghostbusters stopped Gozer, they began rebuilding their Firehouse. During this process, the green ghost from the Sedgewick Hotel secretly observed them. Once the Firehouse was fully restored, a celebratory dinner was held. The ghost made himself known and attempted to steal the food. Janine Melnitz speculated the ghost was lonely and the Ghostbusters were the first humans to pay him any attention. The Ghostbusters dismissed her theory. Over the next few months, they occasionally saw Slimer.\n\nRay Stantz took a liking to the ghost and named him \"Slimer\" to annoy Venkman. When the Ghostbusters were attacked by their ghostly doppelgangers, Slimer distracted the entities long enough for them to be drained of their energy. The Ghostbusters were then able to overpower and trap them. The Ghostbusters agreed to adopt Slimer from then on. For an official statement to the press given by Venkman, Slimer is allowed to freely roam for \"scientific research being conducted\".\n\nIn 1988, Slimer got his own cartoon series primarily aimed at young children. Unlike previous series, Slimer was able to talk very well. Many episodes of \"Slimer!\" had little to do with the \"Ghostbusters\" franchise, simply being about everyday events for Slimer. Like in the first film, he still haunts the Sedgewick Hotel, visiting it in many episodes as a visiting pest.\n\nSlimer was given personal enemies in the show, such as an eccentric scientist named Professor Dweeb who wanted to capture Slimer in order to study him, an alley cat named Manx, a dog named Bruiser, and two ghosts named Goolem and Zugg.\n\nAfter the dissolution of the Ghostbusters, Slimer stayed with Egon Spengler as he watched over the Containment Unit in the Ghostbusters Firehouse. In 1997, when there was a sudden surge in supernatural activity, Slimer flew to Egon's class to inform him of the bad news. After the formation of the \"Extreme Ghostbusters\", Slimer joined them in their cases.\n\nSlimer's appearance was slightly different from the previous series, as he had a ghostly tail and a slightly bigger face, which was less compacted than the previous series. Unlike the version of Slimer from \"The Real Ghostbusters\" and \"Ghostbusters II\", this version acted much like the version from the original \"Ghostbusters\". Slimer's voice was noticeably higher in pitch than in \"The Real Ghostbusters\", because he was voiced by Billy West, instead of Frank Welker, who reprised his role as Ray in the two-part series finale \"Back in the Saddle\".\n\nSlimer, as he appeared in \"The Real Ghostbusters\", is among the various cartoon characters who help main character Michael turn away from drugs.\n\nAt one point, Slimer was recaptured and kept in a Paranormal Containment Research Tank in the Firehouse in the lobby. Egon Spengler is said to have used him for various paranormal studies (a nod to the take on Slimer in \"The Real Ghostbusters\"). On Thanksgiving weekend 1991, Slimer was playing with Peter Venkman's ESP cards inside the Paranormal Containment Research Tank.\n\nThe Psi Energy Pulse damaged the Tank and Slimer escaped. The team finds him looking at the Containment Unit. When the Rookie takes a shot, Slimer avoids it and the Proton Stream hits the Unit, releasing the Sloth Ghost. Rookie and Ray pursued Slimer into the Sub-Basement but it escaped through a wall. After the Sloth Ghost was recaptured, the Ghostbusters headed to the Sedgewick Hotel on Ray's hunch Slimer would return to his old haunt. Sure enough, Slimer was found by Ray, Peter, and Rookie eating and drinking off someone's tray in front of Room 1218. Rookie took a shot but Slimer ran for it and tried to hide. Rookie roused him out and Slimer flew off towards the elevators where he descended back to the ground floor (but not before sliming Peter for a second time). Slimer is joined by Bellhop Ghosts. With renewed paranormal activity, Egon opts to split up. Rookie and Peter are tasked with recapturing Slimer. Peter believes he's feasting in the Alhambra Ballroom but the manager John O'Keefe bars entrance. Peter regroups and leads Rookie through the kitchen to access the other entrance to the ballroom. Rookie and Peter successfully trap Slimer.\n\nSlimer is placed back into a working Paranormal Containment Research Tank when the team returns from Times Square. When Ivo Shandor shut down the containment grid, Slimer is among the escapees. After the Ghostbusters destroy Shandor and return to the physical plane, Slimer slimes Ilyssa Selwyn just as she and Peter are about to kiss in Central Park. In the stylized version of the game, Slimer flies around, on the loose once again, as the Rookie fires on him during the credits.\n\nSlimer appears in Beeline's \"Ghostbusters\" game for iOS. The game was released on January 24, 2013. Slimer's role in the game is that Slimer escapes the Containment Unit and floats around the Ghostbusters Firehouse. The player can tap on him for a daily reward, which increases in value if the player is consistent.\n\nSlimer appears as a playable character in \"Lego Dimensions\", packaged with the \"Slime Shooter\" vehicle, with Frank Welker reprising his voice role. He makes cameo appearances in the main campaign, causing trouble for the heroes, while a bonus level adapting the first film recreates his original encounter with the Ghostbusters in the Sedgewick Hotel. He also appears as a quest-giver in the \"Ghostbusters\" adventure world. He appears once again as part of the \"Ghostbusters\" (2016) Story Pack, recreating his role in the events of the rebooted film's story.\n\n"}

It was introduced into British Columbia in about 1982 and has spread southward in the Pacific Northwest. It has recently been reported from Ontario (Crolla 2008). Full synonymy given in Lafontaine. It is a common species but not as abundant as its larger relative large yellow underwing (\"Noctua pronuba\").\n\nThis species generally has the appearance of a smaller (wingspan 38–48 mm) version of the large yellow underwing \"Noctua pronuba\". The forewings are equally variable in pattern and colour, from pale clay to reddish clay, light brown to almost black. The stigmata are dark and outlined with pale yellow. The crosslines are weak. The wavy line flows on to the front edge as a no more than dark brown (never black) stain, which is sometimes extended down the entire wavy line. The hindwings are orange-yellow with a broad black sub-terminal band and central discal lunule (usually absent in \"Noctua pronuba\").

Its headquarters are in the town of Bilaspur. The district has an area of 1,167 km, and a population of 381,956 (2011 census). As of 2011 it is the third least populous district of Himachal Pradesh (out of 12), after Lahul and Spiti and Kinnaur.\n\nThe district contains the artificial Govind Sagar Lake on the Sutlej River which acts as the reservoir for the Bhakra and Nangal Dam project.\n\nThe area that is now Bilaspur District was formerly known as Kahlur, a princely state of British India. The ruler acceded to the Government of India on 12 October 1948, and Bilaspur was made an Indian state under a chief commissioner. The state of Bilaspur was merged with Himachal Pradesh on 1 July 1954, and became Bilaspur District.\n\nBilaspur was the capital of a state founded in the 7th century, and known as Kahlur after its earlier capital, or as Bilaspur after its later capital. The ruling dynasty were Chandela Rajputs, who claimed descent from the rulers of Chanderi in present-day Madhya Pradesh. The town of Bilaspur was founded in 1663. The state later became a princely state of British India, and was under the authority of the British province of Punjab.\n\nOn 13 May 1665, Guru Tegh Bahadur went to Bilaspur to attend the mourning for Raja Dip Chand of Bilaspur. The Dowager Rani Champa of Bilaspur gave the Guru a piece of land in her state . The land consisted of the villages of Lodhipur, Mianpur and Sahota. Here on the mound of Makhowal, Guru Tegh Bahadur raised a new habitation. The ground was broken on 19 June 1665, by Baba Gurditta Randhawa. The new village was named after the Guru's mother, Nanaki. Chakk Nanaki later became famous as Anandpur Sahib.\n\nIn 1932 state was made part of the newly created Punjab States Agency, and in 1936 the Punjab Hill States Agency was separated from the Punjab States Agency. India became independent in 1947, and on 12 October 1948 the ruler, HH Raja Sir Anand Chand, acceded to the Government of India. Bilaspur became a separate state of India under a chief commissioner, and on 1 July 1954 Bilaspur state was made a district of Himachal Pradesh state by an act of the Indian Parliament. The historic town was submerged in 1954 when the Sutlej River was dammed to create the Govind Sagar, and a new town was built upslope of the old.\n\nMost of the Rajputs in Bilaspur are Chandels, that is they belong to different branches of the ruling family. These families are numerous, and all enjoyed jagir pensions from state amounting in aggregate to Rs.40,000 a year in 1933. They are called 'the Mian families', and the chief names are:\nAjmerchandia, \nKaliyanchandia,\nTarahandia and\nSultanchandia.\n\nAdministratively, the district is divided into four tehsils Ghumarwin, Bilaspur Sadar, and Jhandutta. Jhandutta was created out of Ghumarwin in January 1998. Naina Devi is a sub-tehsil of Bilaspur Sadar, and was created in January 1980.\n\nBilaspur has a hilly terrain. The district is situated in the Shivalik range of the lower Himalayas. It is surrounded by hills on all sides. To the south and west, it is bordered by Punjab. Summers are hot and winters are cold, with fog along banks of river Satluj. The rainy season lasts from early July to mid September. Summer are hottest in the months of May and June.\n\nAccording to the 2011 census Bilaspur district, Himachal Pradesh has a population of 381,956, roughly equal to the nation of Maldives. This gives it a ranking of 562nd in India (out of a total of 640). The district has a population density of . Its population growth rate over the decade 2001-2011 was 12.08%. Bilaspur has a sex ratio of 981 females for every 1000 males, and a literacy rate of 85.67%.\n\nThe major native language is Bilaspuri (or Kahluri), which at the 2011 census accounted for 76% of the district's population, but there are also speakers of Pahari (8.6%), Hindi (5.8%), Punjabi (4%), Kangri (1.3%), and others.\n\nRoad transport is main mode to travel within district. There is no railway line or airport in district.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was awarded from 1992 to 2017. It was inaugurated by English Chief Executive Sir Michael Harris Caine. It was awarded each year to the best work of fiction, written in the Russian language, as decided by a panel of judges, irrespective of the writer's citizenship. , the chair of the Russian Booker Prize Committee was British journalist George Walden. The prize was the first Russian non-governmental literary award since the country's 1917 Revolution.\n\nEach year, a jury choose a short list of the six best novels up for nomination from a \"long list\" of nominees. Initially, the winner received £10,000, roughly 48,000 RUB or $16,000. This was increased to 600,000 rubles in 2011, roughly $20,000 (roughly £13,000), while each of the short listed finalists earned $2,000 (roughly £1,300). The criteria for inclusion included literary effort, representativeness of the contemporary literary genres and the author's reputation as a writer. Length was not a criterion, as books with between 40 and 60 pages had been nominated. From 1997 to 2001, the award was renamed the Smirnoff–Booker Literary Prize, in honour of entrepreneur and Smirnoff founder Pyotr Smirnov. From 2002 to 2005, Open Russia NGO was the general sponsor of the Booker Literary Prize in Russia, leading to its name change to the Booker–Open Russia Literary Prize during that time. Before the announcement of the 2005 winner, the Booker Foundation decided to end its partnership with Open Russia after the foundation's chairman, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was sentenced to nine years in prison for tax evasion. In 2005, the committee signed a five-year contract with London-based BP. In 2010, the prize ran into funding problems and preparations for the 2010 prize were suspended because no new sponsor could be found. Since 2011 new sponsor is Russian Telecom Equipment Company (RTEC).\n\nIn 2011, a \"novel of the decade\" was chosen due to lack of sponsorship to hold the customary award. Five finalists were chosen from sixty nominees selected from the prize's past winners and finalists since 2001. Chudakov won posthumously with \"A Gloom Is Cast Upon the Ancient Steps\", which takes place in a fictional town in Kazakhstan and describes life under Stalinist Russia. Lyudmila Ulitskaya holds the record for most nominations (five, winning once), followed by Andrei Dmitriev (four, winning once) and Alexey Slapovsky (four, no wins). No person has won the award more than once.\n\nOn September 19, 2019 Foundation Board and the Аward committee of the Russian Booker Prize officially announced the termination of the award. However, the Russian Booker Fund was not closed, \"leaving the opportunity for the renewal of the award\".\n\n  *   Winners\n\n  *   Winners\n\n  *   Winners\n\nThe Russian Booker was famous for unpredictable and paradoxical decisions that did not always attract the approval of Russian literary experts.\n\nA number of writers expressed their fundamental rejection of the \"Russian Booker\". Already the first decision of the jury, as a result of which the award in 1992 was not received by the generally recognized favorite — the novel \"The Time Night\" by Lyudmila Petrushevskaya, met with almost unanimous disapproval. Vladimir Novikov () in 2000, describing the very first Booker prize winner - the novel \"Lines of fate, or the chest of Milashevich\" by Mark Kharitonov as boring, stated: \"From the very beginning, the Booker plot did not succeed, it was failed to nominate a leader through the award, which modern prose writers would passionately want to catch up and overtake. But it is precisely in this [...] the cultural function, the cultural strategy of any literary prize\" Elena Fanaylova noted in 2006: \"The Russian Booker does not correspond to its English parent either from a moral or from a meaningful point of view (it can be compared with the translated version of the Booker already available in Russia). The prize focuses on literature that is not interesting either on the domestic or foreign market, or, if it is a convertible author (Ulitskaya, Aksenov), it is awarded not for 'novel of the year', but 'for merits'.\" Yuri Polyakov in 2008 pointed out that \"people receive awards not for the quality of a literary text, not for some artistic discovery, not for the ability to reach the reader, but for loyalty to a certain party, mainly experimental-liberal direction. [...] Almost all the books that were awarded with the prize, [...] did not have any serious reader's fate, [...] [these books] received the award and were immediately completely forgotten.\" Dmitry Bykov in 2010 noted the Booker jury's \"amazing ability to choose the worst or, in any case, the least significant of six novels\".\n\nLiterary criticist Konstantin Trunin, describing the 2018 crisis of the award, noted: \"For all the time of its existence, the prize did not justify itself, each year choosing the winner as a writer who created work that is far from understanding by Russian people of the reality surrounding him. There was a direct propaganda of Western values, not Russian ones. Or on the contrary, the West was shown literature that was not destined to create a close resemblance to the works created in Russia during the XIX century. And it is not surprising that year after year, the Russian Booker lost its authority among the emerging awards. Being handed twenty-six times, he faced the rejection of sponsors, as a result of which it became necessary to reconsider the meaning of existence, having found the transformation required by the reader to a truly Russian humanistic value system».\n\n"}

A reliable seamer who never suffered serious injury despite several lesser niggles, he played three Test matches in 1991 and 1993, and four One Day Internationals in 1993 and 1994. He was one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1994, the only one of that year's five who was not Australian.\n\nWatkin made his first-class debut against Worcestershire in 1986, taking the wickets of Graeme Hick and Phil Neale, and also played two Sunday League games, but had to wait until 1988 for a second chance. That year he established himself as an important member of the Glamorgan first team, taking 8 for 59 (which was to remain his career best) against Warwickshire, and claiming 46 first-class scalps in all that season. His best year in terms of wickets was 1989, when he captured 94, and in his career he took a total of 902 wickets.\n\nHe made his England Test debut unexpectedly in 1991, when Chris Lewis pulled out on the morning of the first test against the West Indies. Watkin's bowling was ideal for Headingley's notorious seamer friendly conditions. Watkin took five wickets, including those of Carl Hooper, Viv Richards and Gus Logie in a match-turning spell in the second innings, in England's ultimate victory in the match, but he fared less well two weeks later at Lord's, where his only significant contribution was to hang around for nearly an hour with the bat while Robin Smith played the best innings of his career at the other end. He returned to the Test team for the Sixth Test in 1993, when he took six wickets, including the first three of Australia's second innings, in England's only victory of the series. He was selected for the subsequent tour of the West Indies, but did not play in any of the Tests: he perhaps would have held his place for the First Test, but suffered back trouble which put him out of the side, Alan Igglesden playing in his place. He did play in four of the five ODIs on that tour, bowling particularly creditably in the 2nd in Kingston, Jamaica, with four wickets on his comeback after missing the 1st Test: but a loss of form in the later ODIs and a subsequent recurrence of his back problem cut his tour short, the only time injury got the better of him in his career. He was not considered for international selection again, although some considered him unlucky in this regard.\n\nIn 1998, Watkin was given a benefit by Glamorgan, which raised £133,000. Normally a poor batsman, he managed to average a startling 35.66 that year, despite a top score of just 25, thanks to 13 not outs in his sixteen innings. By contrast, his career average was 10.83. In 2000, he scored 51 against Gloucestershire, the only half-century of his career.\n\nAfter retirement in 2001, Watkin became Director of the Welsh Cricket Academy.\n"}

Satan has transported Jesus to the pinnacle of the Temple of Jerusalem and told Jesus that he should throw himself down as God in Psalm 91 promised that no harm would befall him. In this verse Jesus quotes scripture to rebuff the devil.\n\nThe original Koine Greek, according to Novum Testamentum Graece, reads:\n\nIn the King James Version of the Bible the text reads:\n\nThe World English Bible translates the passage as:\n\nFor a collection of other versions see BibleHub Matthew 4:7.\n\nAs in his response to the first temptation in Jesus again responds by quoting scripture. This quotation comes from a verse that comes two chapters before that quoted in 4:4. As with the earlier quotation it uses the exact translation found in the Septuagint. In this section of Deuteronomy Moses is instructing the Israelites on proper behaviour. In full Deuteronomy 6:16 reads \"Do not test the Lord your God as you did at Massah.\" This is a reference to the events of where the Israelites wandering in the desert doubted God was with them (cf. ; ff). This passage is thus seen as the clearest evidence that the temptation narrative shows how Jesus avoided making the same errors as the Israelites. The quoting of Moses' dictate is also seen as a rejection of Antinomianism. Satan had originally quoted from Psalms, but Fortna notes that Jesus replies with a more fundamental verse by quoting from the Torah.\n\nThomas Long notes that after the child Jesus had followed the journey of Israel into Egypt, the adult Jesus retraced the adventure of Israel in the wilderness. The temptations that Jesus faced echoes the very temptations, even in the same order, that the Israelites experienced after the exodus from slavery in Egypt (Exodus 16, 17 and 19-32).\n\nIn the Gospel of Luke this temptation is the final one, and that is the ordering most commonly used by Christians. By tradition after Jesus rebuffs Satan it is Satan who plummets from the top of the temple, something frequently depicted in art and recounted in some detail in \"Paradise Regained\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2044841", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2044841", "title": "Co-insurance", "text": "Co-insurance\n\nIn insurance, co-insurance or coinsurance is the splitting or spreading of risk among multiple parties.\n\nIn the U.S. insurance market, co-insurance is the joint assumption of risk between the insurer and the insured. In title insurance, it also means the sharing of risks between two or more title insurance companies.\n\nIn health insurance, copayment is fixed while co-insurance is the percentage that the insured pays after the insurance policy's deductible is exceeded, up to the policy's stop loss. It can be expressed as a pair of percentages with the insurer's portion stated first, or just a single percentage showing what the insured pays. Once the insured's out-of-pocket expenses equal the stop loss the insurer will assume responsibility for 100% of any additional costs. 70–30, 80–20, and 90–10 insurer-insured co-insurance schemes are common, with stop loss limits of $1,000 to $3,000 after which the insurer covers all expenses.\n\nCo-insurance is a penalty imposed on the insured by the insurance carrier for underreporting, declaring, or insuring the value of the tangible property or business income. It also applies without a concealment for the insured to bear some sort of responsibility and thus reduce moral hazard. The penalty is based on a percentage stated within the policy and the amount underreported. As an example:\n\nA buildings replacement cost actually valued at $1,000,000 has an 80% co-insurance clause but is insured for only $750,000. Since its insured value is less than 80% of its replacement value, when it suffers a loss, the insurance payout will be subject to the underreporting penalty. For example, if it suffers a $200,000 loss, the insured would recover $750,000 ÷ (0.80 × 1,000,000) × 200,000 = $187,500 (less any deductible). In this example, the underreporting penalty would be $12,500. More generally, suppose a building with replacement cost \"R\" is insured for amount \"I\", with a co-insurance requirement \"c\", expressed as a number between 0 and 1 (e.g. 0.8 for an 80% co-insurance clause). If this building suffers a loss \"L\", then the insurance payout (less deductibles) would be the smallest of the three amounts, \"L\", \"I\", and \"IL/(cR)\". The first two alternatives reflect the fact that the payout will not exceed the loss nor the amount the building was insured for, while the last amount represents the intended action of the co-insurance requirement to penalize underreporting. \n\nThe most commonly issued co-insurance percentage would be 80% but it can be as high as 100%, which would impose the greatest penalty for underreporting. For this reason, it is vital for values of the property to be accurately reported and updated annually to reflect inflation and other increases in cost...\n\nOwner's title insurance policy forms of the American Land Title Association created between 1987 and late 2006, contain co-insurance clauses. For partial losses, they require the insured carry a percentage of the risk of loss in two circumstances. The first is if the insured did not insure its title for at least 80% of its market value at the time the policy was issued. In that case, the insurer will pay only 80% of the loss. The second is if improvements constructed on the property after the policy is issued increase the property's value by at least 20% above the amount of the policy. In that case, the insurer will pay a percentage of the claim equal to the ratio of 120% of the amount of insurance purchased divided by the sum of the amount of insurance and the cost of the improvements.\n\nCo-insurance is also used among U.S. domestic title insurers in a manner similar to that described below for the international insurance market.\n\nIn some cases, including employer's liability insurance, co-insurance percent denotes a function analogous to the copay function that it has in health insurance, in which the insured covers a certain percentage of the losses up to a certain level.\n\nIn business income interruption insurance, a type of time-element insurance, the co-insurance percent indicates how long the coverage will last, and can range from 50% to 125%. The former co-insurance allows for 6 months of coverage, compared to 15 months for 125%.\n\nIn the international insurance market, co-insurance is the joint assumption of risk between various insurers.\n\nCo-insurance is generally widely used in the European insurance market. In this context, a common insurance contract is used and the risk is shared based on percentages between the insurance companies. Often, one insurance company will lead. When leading the insurance company will be responsible for administering various aspects of the insurance policy, such as premium, any claims and the insurance documents. In this situation, a charge is levied (termed lead office commission).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2044847", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2044847", "title": "Mast radiator", "text": "Mast radiator\n\nA mast radiator (or radiating tower) is a radio mast or tower in which the entire structure functions as an antenna. This design, first used in radiotelegraphy stations in the early 1900s, is commonly used for transmitting antennas operating at low frequencies, in the VLF, LF and MF ranges, in particular those used for AM broadcasting. The metal mast is electrically connected to the transmitter. Its base is usually mounted on a nonconductive support to insulate it from the ground. A mast radiator is a form of monopole antenna.\n\nMost mast radiators are built as guyed masts insulated from the ground at the base. Steel lattice masts of triangular cross-section are the most common type. Square lattice masts and tubular masts are also sometimes used. To ensure that the tower is a continuous conductor, the tower's structural sections are electrically bonded at the joints by short copper jumpers which are soldered to each side. \nAt its base, the mast is usually mounted on a thick ceramic insulator, which has the compressive strength to support the tower's weight and the dielectric strength to withstand the high RF voltage applied by the transmitter. The RF power to drive the antenna is supplied by a matching network, usually housed in an antenna tuning hut next to the mast, and the cable supplying the current is simply bolted to the tower. The actual transmitter is usually located in a separate building, which supplies RF power to the antenna tuning hut via a transmission line.\nFree-standing towers are also used as radiating structures. These towers can have a triangular or a square cross section, with each leg supported on an insulator. One of the best-known radiating towers is the Blosenbergturm in Beromünster, Switzerland. Fiberglass masts are sometimes used for small constructions.\n\nThe ideal height of a mast radiator depends on transmission frequency, demographics for the location, and terrain. For radio systems in the longwave and mediumwave range, the value of the height should be in the range between one sixth and five eighths of the wavelength, with preferred values at the quarter or the half of the radiated wavelength. When this is not possible, masts with a loading coil, 'capacity hat' or similar loading arrangement are used.\n\nThe height of the mast determines the radiation properties. For high power transmitters in the MW range, masts with heights around half of the radiated wavelength are preferred because they focus the radiated power better to the ground than structures with heights of quarter wavelengths, which are preferred for economical reasons for low power medium wave transmitters. A focus of radiated power towards the ground is much desired on frequencies below 3 megahertz, because groundwave propagation is very stable. Masts longer than five eighths of the wavelength are normally not used, because they show bad vertical radiation patterns, so masts for mediumwave transmitters do not normally exceed 300 metres. For longwave transmitters, however, the construction of masts with heights of half-wave wavelength is generally not economically viable and in most cases impossible. The only longwave radio mast with a height of the half length of the radiated wavelength was the Warszawa Radio Mast at Konstantynów, Poland. At the time of its collapse in 1991 it was the tallest manmade structure in the world, at 646.38 metres (2,120.67 ft) tall, for a wavelength of 1292.76 metres (frequency 232 kHz). For frequencies below longwave, masts are electrically enlarged by loading coils or capacity hats on the top, because masts of even quarter wavelength would be too high to be practical.\n\nThere are three ways of feeding a mast radiator from a transmitter:\n\nThere is usually an antenna matching unit to match the impedance of the transmitter or feeder to the antenna. Depending on the power involved, this may be a small box or a hut or building. It will typically contain an L-network to transform the modulus of impedance, and a coil or capacitor in series with the mast connection to 'tune out' any reactive component.\n\nAt some facilities, especially the older and higher-powered installations, the mast radiator may be located at a distance from the transmitter building to reduce the field strength induced by the mast into the building, and to prevent the building from distorting the mast's radiation pattern. Between the transmitter building and the antenna matching unit next to the mast radiator, there is a feeder: either an underground coaxial cable or an overhead wire 'cage' feeder.\n\nAt facilities with multiple masts, spacings are typically smaller to fit them into the available space.\n\nAt modern transmitters or at low power transmitters situated in very small transmitter buildings the transmitter, matching unit and mast radiator can be close together, and possibly in the same building. This saves on feeders, land area and increases the efficiency of the transmitter if only one mast radiator is in use.\n\nAt most facilities the mast radiator is on a separate base close to the antenna matching unit, but it can be sometimes be placed on the roof of the antenna matching unit, for example at the main transmission mast of the Mühlacker radio transmitter and the main transmission mast of the Ismaning radio transmitter.\n\nFor a good groundwave propagation, mast radiators are built on a large flat area with good ground conductivity, and if possible without inclination. The construction of a mast radiator atop a building or tower whose height is in the same magnitude range as the wavelengths being transmitted gives a bad groundwave propagation. For this reason, mast radiators are (in contrast to FM broadcasting antennas) not typically installed atop buildings or towers. In rare cases, mast radiators for low power transmissions are installed atop buildings. Some lighthouses, such as Reykjanesviti carry a mast radiator for a longwave radio beacon on the roof. The best-known are WGSO in New Orleans and KSBN (AM) on the Delaney Building in Spokane, Washington. In Europe, the low-power broadcasting station at Campobasso uses a mast radiator on a castle.\n\nMast radiators, as with all other equipment showing over 42 volts on exposed components within 4 metres of the ground, are required to be fenced. Usually a chain-link fence is used, but sometimes wooden fences are used to prevent signal interference, which could occur due to currents induced by radio signals in metallic fences.\nIf the mast radiator is mounted atop the antenna tuning hut (which must be over four metres high) or the mast is grounded, with the feed being located not less than four metres above the ground, a fence is not required.\nIt is recommended to fence in any mast radiator to prevent unauthorized climbing.\n\nA mast radiator may need various electrical connections other than the transmitter feed line. Such connections include static drain chokes (which drain off static charges caused by wind, clouds, etc.), spark-gap balls for lightning protection, power supplies for aircraft warning lamps, and coaxial feeders for ancillary antennas mounted on the mast. A variety of techniques are used to 'isolate' these connections from the high RF voltage on the mast, such as chokes, parallel tuned circuits and coupling loops, on a base-fed mast. On a shunt-fed mast, where the base is grounded, such measures are unnecessary.\n\nAn anti-fading antenna (informally and often incorrectly termed a \"Franklin\" antenna) is a long- and medium-wave transmission antenna with a flat vertical radiation pattern. The design goal is to move the mush zone farther from the transmitter site. An anti-fading antenna will reduce radiation at elevations of more than 50 degrees as much as possible. In principle, such a radiator should be as thin as possible, although thicker radiators improve the bandwidth and contribute to a taller effective height.\n\nThese antennas are usually constructed using a metal radio mast, which is fed both at its base and at an appropriate height. The radio mast is usually insulated from ground and is divided electrically by a separation insulator into two parts. For feeding of the upper part, either a cable inside the mast construction or the ladder, which must be mounted on insulators, is used. This design is employed in the Mühlacker, Wolfsheim and Hamburg medium-wave transmitters. Anti-fading antennas with two separation insulators are installed at Ismaning.\n\nBecause separation insulators are fragile compared to the construction of the radio mast framework, horizontal forces, such as those generated by wind-caused oscillations, need to be minimized. Radio masts with built-in separation insulators may employ oscillation dampers just above the separation insulator. This approach is used on the radio masts of Wolfsheim, Hamburg and Ismaning.\n\nA simple anti-fading antenna is a vertical radiator whose height is between 1/2 wavelength (180 electrical degrees) and 5/9 wavelength (200 degrees), 195 degrees being considered ideal. 200 degree and taller simple radiators have largely fallen into disuse, although these can be useful on medium power stations, in which case radiators as tall as 5/8 wavelength (225 degrees) are somewhat common. Any simple radiator (or array of radiators) which is taller than 195 degrees is generally not considered to have anti-fading properties.\n\nA more complex anti-fading antenna is a vertical radiator which is sectionalized and is one wavelength (360 degrees, generally 180 over 180 degrees, and historically and correctly termed a \"Franklin\" radiator; two in an array at KFBK), or 300 degrees (180 over 120 degrees, and formally called a WHO radiator), or 240 degrees (120 over 120 degrees, and formally called a WOAI radiator, but WOAI has since replaced this with a 195 degree radiator for lower maintenance cost at the expense of somewhat poorer \"fringe\" reception). Several have been incorporated into phased arrays (directional antennas). When so sectionalized the sections are themselves phased so as to provide the optimum vertical radiation pattern (suppressing high-angle radiation). An advantage of the 180 over 180 degree configuration is no ground radial system is required, and the bottom of the lower section may be insulated from the ground; for the others, the bottom of the lower section is usually connected to a ground radial system through a capacitor.\n\nAnother form of anti-fading mast antenna is a circular array antenna, in which a number of mast radiators are arranged on a circle and fed in equal phase. With this design, very flat radiation patterns may be produced, although they are very expensive since multiple radio masts are required. Taldom transmitter and Tulagino transmitter in Russia are currently the only radio stations in the world using such antennas. At one time, longwave transmitter Orlunda in Sweden also used an antenna of this type.\n\nThe tallest mast radiator ever built was the Warsaw radio mast at Konstantynow, Poland. The antenna was high but collapsed in 1991. Currently the masts of the Lualualei VLF transmitter, at , are the tallest mast radiators insulated against ground. In contrast to the Warsaw Radio Mast, the Lualualei antenna uses extensive electrical lengthening measures. The tallest mast radiator not using electrical lengthening may be the Hellissandur longwave radio mast at high.\n\n"}

DOS Plus 1.0 was based on CP/M-86 Plus combined with the PCMODE emulator from Concurrent PC DOS 4.11. While CP/M-86 Plus and Concurrent DOS 4.1 still had been developed in the United States, Concurrent PC DOS 4.11 was an internationalized and bug-fixed version brought forward by Digital Research UK. Later DOS Plus 2.x issues were based on Concurrent PC DOS 5.0 instead. In the broader picture DOS Plus can be seen as an intermediate step between Concurrent CP/M-86 and DR DOS.\n\nDOS Plus is able to run programs written for either CP/M-86 or MS-DOS 2.11, and can read and write the floppy formats used by both these systems. Up to four CP/M-86 programs can be multitasked, but only one DOS program can be run at a time.\n\nDOS Plus attempts to present the same command-line interface as MS-DOS. Like MS-DOS, it has a command-line interpreter called codice_1 (alternative name codice_2). There is an codice_3 file, but no codice_4 (except for FIDDLOAD, an extension to load some field-installable device drivers (FIDD) in some versions of DOS Plus 2.1). The major difference the user will notice is that the bottom line of the screen contains status information similar to:\n\nThe left-hand side of the status bar shows running processes. The leftmost one will be visible on the screen; the others (if any) are running in the background. The right-hand side shows the keyboard layout in use (UK8 in the above example), the printer port assignment, the keyboard Caps Lock and Num Lock status, and the current time. If a DOS program is running, the status line is not shown. DOS programs cannot be run in the background.\n\nThe keyboard layout in use can be changed by pressing , and one of the function keys -.\n\nDOS Plus contains a number of extra commands to support its multitasking features:\n\n\nIt also contains subsets of the standard DOS commands and CP/M commands – for example, it has both a built-in codice_5 command, and a codice_6 utility, both of which copy files.\n\nThe codice_7 command can assign one of the three drives N:, O: or P: to a directory on a different drive, in a similar manner to the MS-DOS command codice_8. For example,\n\nwill cause the directory codice_9 to appear as drive N:. This so-called \"floating drive\" feature allows old programs which don't support subdirectories to work under DOS Plus and can be used to make file handling at the command prompt much easier.\nThis feature is also present in Concurrent DOS, Multiuser DOS, System Manager 7, and REAL/32, however, these systems extent the concept to all unused drive letters from A: to Z:, except for drive letter L:. DR DOS 3.31 - 6.0 (up to the November 1992 updates with BDOS 6.7 only) also support this (including drive letter L:). Under the later systems, the 4DOS/NDOS command processor supports this features as well. Floating drives are implemented in the BDOS kernel, not in the command line shell, thus this feature can also be used from within DOS applications when entering directory paths for as long as the application does not parse and split the dirspec for further processing.\n\nUsing a similar feature, Concurrent DOS, Multiuser DOS, System Manager and REAL/32 will dynamically assign a floating drive L: to the load path of a loaded application, thereby allowing applications to refer to files residing in their load directory under a standardized drive letter instead of under a fixed absolute path. This \"load drive\" feature makes it much easier to move software installations on and across disks without having to adapt paths to overlays, configuration files or user data stored in the load directory or subsequent directories. (For similar reasons, the appendage to the environment block associated with loaded applications under MS-DOS/PC DOS 3.0 (and higher) contains a reference to the load path of the executable, however, this consumes more resident memory, and to take advantage of it, support for it must be coded into the executable, whereas DRI's solutions transparently works with any kind of application.)\n\nAnother feature resulting from the BDOS' internal organization of current working directories as relative links to parent directories is the theoretically unlimited directory depth supported by all those above mentioned operating systems – in contrast to MS-DOS/PC DOS (and DR DOS since 1992), where an MS-DOS compatible internal data structure named Current Directory Structure (CDS) limits directory depths to a maximum of 66 characters.\n\nThese features can be attributed to the fact that CP/M itself did not have a concept of subdirectories, and DOS was emulated under these operating systems, so directories had to be translated to internal CP/M structures in some intelligent way.\n\nDOS Plus boots from a single file called either DOSPLUS.SYS or NETPLUS.SYS (rather than the IO.SYS / MSDOS.SYS combination of MS-DOS). This file is in the CP/M-86 CMD format, and is structured internally as a number of modules:\n\n\nDOS Plus was the main operating system in ROM for the Philips , for which it was originally developed. PC compatible versions were supplied with the Amstrad PC1512 and the Jasmin Turbo from the French company T.R.A.N. S.A. The non-IBM PC compatible BBC Master 512, came with DOS Plus 1.2, 1.2a or 2.1. Its successor, the Solidisk's PC Plus, also came with a variant of DOS Plus 1.2a or 2.1. There were DOS Plus 2.1e/g adaptations for the Apricot ACT series' non-standard 315 KB and 720 KB FAT12 floppy formats. The logical sectored FAT hard disk format (partition type 0xF2) of Sperry IT PCs, and the 80186 co-processor boards for the Acorn Archimedes A300 and A310 as well as Acorn 286 prototypes were supported as well.\n\nKnown operating system versions include:\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is a white, hygroscopic crystalline powder. It is odorless with a saline taste. It contains 38.28% potassium by mass. In the monohydrate form it is highly hygroscopic and deliquescent.\n\nAs a food additive, potassium citrate is used to regulate acidity and is known as E number E332. Medicinally, it may be used to control kidney stones derived from either uric acid or cystine.\n\nPotassium citrate is produced by adding potassium bicarbonate or potassium carbonate to a solution of citric acid until effervescence ceases, filtering the solution and evaporating to granulation.\n\nPotassium citrate is rapidly absorbed when given by mouth and is excreted in the urine. Since it is an alkaline salt it is effective in reducing the pain and frequency of urination when these are caused by highly acidic urine. It is used for this purpose in dogs and cats, but is chiefly employed as a non-irritating diuretic.\n\nPotassium citrate is an effective way to treat/manage gout and arrhythmia, if the patient is hypokalemic.\n\nIt is widely used to treat urinary calculi (kidney stones) and is often used by patients with cystinuria. A study of 500 patients with recurrent stones found that it reduced the frequency of stones from 2 per year to a half per year.\n\nIt is also used as an alkalizing agent in the treatment of mild urinary tract infections such as cystitis.\n\nIt is also used in many soft drinks as a buffering agent.\n\nPotassium citrate is usually administered by mouth in dilute aqueous solution. This is because of its somewhat caustic effect on the stomach lining, and the potential for other mild health hazards.\n\n"}

It usually involves the permanent mandibular molars or premolars. The involved tooth usually has a vital pulp. It is attached to the tooth root and may cause its resorption, may involve the pulp canal, grows slowly, tends to expand the overlying cortical plates, and, except for the enlargement produced, is usually asymptomatic. This involves the buccal and lingual aspects of the alveolar ridges. But may be associated with diffuse pain and tooth mobility, but the tooth is still vital.\n\nSince a cementoblastoma is a benign neoplasm, it grossly forms a mass of cementum-like tissue as an irregular or round mass attached to the roots of a tooth, usually the permanent mandibular first molar.\n\nA cementoblastoma in a radiograph appears as a well-defined, markedly radiopaque mass, with a radiolucent peripheral line, which overlies and obliterates the tooth root. it is described as having a rounded or sunburst appearance. There is usually apparent external resorption of the root where the tumor and the root join. Severe hypercementosis and chronic focal sclerosing osteomyelitis are lesions to consider in the differential diagnosis of this lesion.\n\nSurgical enucleation of the lesion is done, and depending upon the clinical circumstances, this involve removal of the involved tooth.

Edgbaston Hall, and its lodge house, are Grade II listed buildings. The grounds, featuring Edgbaston Pool, are now divided into an 18-hole golf course and a nature reserve.\n\nEarly in the Civil War, Edgbaston Hall, along with Hawkesley House, now the site of a council housing estate in Longbridge, was a stronghold of Colonel John Fox, the so-called \"Jovial Tinker\". The Edgbaston Garrison musters from August 19, 1645 to April 30, 1646, can be found among the accounts of the Warwickshire County Committee, which was the Parliamentary Committee of accounts for the County, along with musters, warrants, levy assessments and other documents submitted by field officers and garrison commanders to be examined by the Committee.

Despite this goal, the brewery was run as a commercial enterprise. The abbey owned several bars in the area and produced lager under its own \"Trappist\" brand as well as contract brewing for several private labels. In 1969, the abbey licensed the brewing operations to the Artois Brewery (now InBev). In 1980 the deal with Artois ended, and the monks went back to brewing themselves, this time a top fermented beer which had only been made in limited quantities since the 1950s. Over time the brewery introduced more varieties, first with \"Dubbel\" and \"Tripel\" in 1987, then in 1992 they introduced \"Blond\". Between 1993 and 2000, the brewery also marketed a brand called \"Enkel\". The brewery also produces the world's only Trappist witbier. The brewery also used to produce the Jopen beer.\n\nThe brewery started exporting in 1985, and in 1989 the brewery was modernised.\n\nFrom 1980 until 1999, the brewery was largely run by the monks. Due to the difficulty of the ageing monks continuing to operate the brewery, a limited liability company was set up as a subsidiary of the large commercial brewer, Bavaria. In 1999 the new company began to take over day-to-day operations, renting the buildings and equipment from the abbey.\n\nAs a result of this agreement, a dispute arose with the \"International Trappist Association\", the body that governs the labelling of goods as Trappist. They claimed that this new method of operation was against the regulations that permitted the beer to display the \"Authentic Trappist Product\" logo. Whilst the beer continued to be brewed within the abbey walls, the arrangement with Bavaria was felt to be too commercialised. As a result, the brewery withdrew their use of the logo on 1 December 1999. However, the brewery continued to label the beer as \"Trappistenbier\".\n\nAfter a lengthy study by all parties, and a review of the agreement between the abbey and brewery, the beers were granted the right to display the logo again as of September 9, 2005. As part of this settlement, the monks have taken a more active control of the brewery day-to-day operations, working several hours each day.\n\nOf the twelve trappist breweries, this brewery is currently operated by \"De Koningshoeven NV\", a subsidiary of the Bavaria Brewery, but the buildings and equipment are owned by the abbey. The monks of the abbey are the ultimate authority on the brewing process. However, the secular company runs the business operations. The abbey also houses a bar and shop/museum, the latter of which is staffed by a monk.\n\nAt times, the brewery has allowed its spare capacity to be used for brewing of other beers. Wieckse Witte and Chimay have at one stage been brewed in the abbey.\n\nAs with all other Trappist breweries, the brewery exists in order to finance the monastery, not for profit or any other commercial reason.\n\nOriginally the brewery was called \"De Schaapskooi\", and this name is still used casually especially around the region.\n\nThe beers and the brewery are usually marketed under the name \"La Trappe\". However, in some markets, such as the United States, the \"Koningshoeven\" name was used until 2010. It is one of five producers of Trappist beer outside Belgium, and produces four regular and two seasonal beers:\n\n\nApart from the La Trappe brand, the brewery produces \"Tilburg's Dutch Brown Ale\" mainly for export.\n\nThe water for the beer is drawn from five 200-metre deep wells on the abbey grounds, and all beers except the \"Blond\" are bottle conditioned. The spent grain remaining after the wort is filtered from the mash is used to feed the abbey's own herd of cows.\n\nOriginally there was an \"Enkel\" which was the monk's table beer, but it was replaced by Blond in the range.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2044874", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2044874", "title": "Drummore", "text": "Drummore\n\n\"Not to be confused with Drummuir, north east Scotland\"\n\nDrummore (; (from Gaelic \"An Druim Mòr\" meaning \"the great ridge\") is a village at the southern end of the Rhins of Galloway in Wigtownshire, Scotland: it has two satellite clachans, called Kirkmaiden and Damnaglaur. The village lies where the Kildonan Burn runs out to the sea, north of the Mull of Galloway. It is the most southerly village in Scotland, and further south than the English cities of Durham and Carlisle. It is in the Dumfries and Galloway Council area and the parish and community of Kirkmaiden and is about from the nearest major town, the ferry port of Stranraer. In the 2011 census, the population was 534.\n\nDrummore shares its name with High Drummore a mile (1.6 km) up Glen Lee, and also with Drummore Glen to the east. The underlying name is clearly the Gaelic \"druim mòr\" or \"big ridge\", and it has been suggested that this reflected the motte associated with the castle of the Adairs of Kinhilt, whose lands were granted in 1602 by King James VI. The rather scattered incidence of related names, however, makes it more likely that the hill-ridge itself is in question, although at it is not all that prominent compared to the Muntloch Fell and Inshanks Fell to the west, or even the Mull of Galloway itself, 3 miles (5 km) to the south.\n\nA branch line was proposed in 1877 linking to the Portpatrick Railway. It was opposed by the feudal landowner, the Earl of Stair, and finally abandoned after the failure of the City of Glasgow Bank in 1882; aspects of the village's street layout still reflect plans for the railway.\n\nThe southern Rhins was an area of early Christian activity following the missionary work of Ninian across Luce Bay in the Machars. Shortly before 1860, at Low Curghie less than a mile up the coast north of Drummore, and not far from an extant standing stone, a gravestone was discovered which appeared to date to the 5th or 6th century, with a weathered Latin inscription in which the name “Ventidius” was legible along with another word which translated as “sub-deacon”. Many place-names testify to Norse influence in the southern Rhins, as in many of the west-coast islands and peninsulas, but Drummore's Gaelic name is in tune with the general use of Gaelic in Galloway after the Dark Ages until it was supplanted by English under Presbyterian influence in the 17th century.\n\nDrummore is the largest settlement in the parish of Kirkmaiden, named after St Maiden or Medan. The parish church was originally some five miles (8 km) south of the village, but in 1638 the parishioners, citing the inconvenience of the journey to church, secured the building of a new church known as Kirk Covenant on Core Hill, about a mile west of Drummore. Following the Disruption of 1843, a new church was again built, for worshippers in the Free Church of Scotland, and this time in the village itself, in the street now known as Stair Street. Early in the 20th century the two congregations were reunited. Now worship is habitually at the church within Drummore, with one service each month in the summer being held at Kirk Covenant.\n\nThe harbour, facing north and shielded by the Rhins from the prevailing south-westerly wind, was developed with a jetty in the early 19th century to serve a lime manufacturing industry. For many years in the hands of the UK's Ministry of Defence as part of the management of their bombing range and weapon development area offshore in Luce Bay, it was taken over in 2004 for a nominal sum by the Drummore Harbour Trust Ltd, which announced the aim of developing its use for pleasure boats.\n\nThis disposal by the MoD attracted attention in the UK Parliament as a result of disputes over the rights of access to the harbour by fishermen, and a subsequent Court of Session judgement confirmed a Victorian precedent that no right of harbour existed. Failure of the Drummore Harbour Trust to widen its membership beyond the initial two individual members, or to begin its promised investment programme, caused increasing concern. In July 2008 the Dumfries and Galloway Council decided to seek an Empowerment Order under the Harbours Act 1964 which would enable the Council to take over the harbour land and operations, following the pattern of a number of successful harbours along the Solway coast. This was not achieved.\n\nIn 2015 the Harbour Trust became liable for a £15000 personal injury claim, and it then dissolved itself, so the harbour reverted to the Crown Estate. As of June 2018 the Drummore residents are attempting to buy the harbour, via the Kirkmaiden Community Harbour Trust.\n\nOlder residents recall a time when the main streets were full of shops, including no fewer than three bakers (one on the corner of Stair and Mill Streets). Even recently there have been significant casualties, including on Mill Street the bank, the butcher's (now wholesale only, as a result of health legislation), and the Harbour Stores (formerly the second general shop, with an additional speciality in fishing supplies).\n\nThe village’s facilities still however include the Mariners Coffee Shop, the Queen's Hotel, a post office, a volunteer tourist office and a general shop on Mill Street; a garage for repairs (no fuel); a primary school; a doctor's surgery and pharmacy; the Ship Inn on the shore; a bowling club and children’s play park; a number of holiday cottages; and two caravan sites near sandy beaches (one of them associated with another pub). The Kirkmaiden Community Council meets monthly in Drummore. Housing is mixed, ranging from listed Victorian residential and commercial properties to modern bungalows and harled council houses.\n\nWithin living memory a number of street names have changed, notably Stair Street (formerly Church Street), Mill Street (formerly Main Street) and Harbour Road (formerly Quay Road). Following a landslip in the 1960s the former Lower Road, which had brought traffic in along the coast to Shore Street, was barred to traffic. It is now a footpath, set thickly about by Japanese knotweed; in the summer of 2014 it was decorated anonymously with fairy doors.\n"}

Its entrance difficulty is usually considered as one of the top with University of Tokyo, Kyoto University and Tokyo Institute of Technology among 180 national and public universities.Japanese people call them as \"tokyoikko(東京一工)\" They are one of the most difficult universities for Japanese people to enter them. Universities in Japan are ranked based on a hensachi score. This tells how far from the statistical mean a typical student admitted to a university scores on a test. A score of 50 is at the mean. It is generally believed that the best universities have the highest hensachi score.These universities are ranked 1st to 4th place. So high school students have to get highest hensachi score to enter them.\n\n\nThe university's alumni association is called Josuikai (如水会) and its main building (\"Josui Kaikan\") is next to the building where Graduate School of International Corporate Strategy (ICS) is in Kanda, Tokyo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2044907", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2044907", "title": "Himmelpforten", "text": "Himmelpforten\n\nHimmelpforten (Low Saxon: \"Himmelpoorten\") is a municipality west of Hamburg (Germany) in the district of Stade in Lower Saxony. It is located on the creek. Himmelpforten is also part and the seat of the \"Samtgemeinde\" (\"collective municipality\") Oldendorf-Himmelpforten.\n\nHimmelpforten belonged to the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen. The families \"von Brobergen\" and \"von Haseldorf\" had donated a Cistercian nunnery in near Lamstedt. In 1255 it moved to Himmelpforten, then named \"Eulsete\". The Himmelpforten Convent used to be called in (heaven's gate), which became the place's name \"Himmelpoorten\" (in Low Saxon) or \"Himmelpforten\" (in High German) respectively. The church of the nunnery was also used as a parish church. The nuns elected a provost, first mentioned in 1255 (a certain Albert), who had the privilege to nominate priests to the churches in the Himmelpforten parish, to wit the churches in Himmelpforten itself, in Großenwörden, Hechthausen and in .\n\nNunneries had traditionally been institutions to provide unmarried daughters of the better off, who couldn't be provided a husband befitting their social status or who didn't want to marry, with a decent livelihood. So when an unmarried woman of that status joined a nunnery she would bestow earning assets (real estate) or – restricted to her lifetime – regular revenues paid by her male relatives, on the nunnery, making up in the former case part of the nunnery's estates.\n\nIn 1556 Himmelpforten's then Lutheran Provost Segebade II von der Hude appointed the first Lutheran pastor, Peter Schlichting, in Himmelpforten. When in the mid-16th century the majority of the population in the Prince-Archbishopric adopted Lutheranism, the function of the nunnery, to provide sustenance for unmarried women, wasn't to be given up. So the formerly Roman Catholic nunnery of Himmelpforten with its estates was turned into a Lutheran foundation (, more particular: Frauenstift, literally in ).\n\nDuring the Leaguist occupation under Johan 't Serclaes, Count of Tilly (1628-1630), the administrator regnant of the Bremian See, John Frederick had to agree to Catholic visitations in the nunneries. By November 1629 the Roman Catholic \"visitors\" issued an ultimatum to the prioress of the Lutheran conventuals to convert to Catholicism or to leave the nunnery.\n\nNo conversion had been recorded, so on 6 August 1630 all Lutheran conventuals left, the day before their announced forced eviction from the nunnery. In accordance with the Edict of Restitution the estates of Himmelpforten's nunnery were then bestowed to the Catholic Jesuits, in order to finance them and their missioning in the course of the Counter-Reformation in the Prince-Archbishopric. The expelled conventuals were denied restitution of the real estate which they bestowed on the nunnery when they had entered it.\n\nAfter the Leaguist troops left Himmelpforten, the Lutheran conventuals returned and elected a new provost in 1638, Casper Schulte. After the Swedes had occupied Himmelpforten in 1645, on 27 October 1647 Queen Christina of Sweden promised Himmelpforten's nunnery and its estates to Count Gustaf Adolf Lewenhaupt as a fief heritable in the male line (Mannlehen).\n\nOn 30 July 1651 Lewenhaupt was officially invested with the nunnery, while the eleven still remaining conventuals under Prioress Gertrud von Campe were to be supplied a livelihood until their death. New conventuals were not to be accepted anymore. Since the enfeoffment of Lewenhaupt the estates and jurisdictions of the Himmelpforten Convent formed the seigniorial Amt Himmelpforten, seated in Himmelpforten. \nIn 1648 the Prince-Archbishopric was transformed into the Duchy of Bremen, which was first ruled in personal union by the Swedish Crown - interrupted by a Danish occupation (1712-1715) - and from 1715 on by the Hanoverian Crown. After a Prussian and then French occupation from 1806 to 1810, the ephemeric Kingdom of Westphalia annexed the Duchy in 1810, replacing the Amt Himmelpforten by the \"Canton of Stade and Himmelpforten\", established on 1 September 1810 and seated in Stade. With effect of 1 January 1811 France annexed all the South Elbian German coast and its hinterland and the area of the former Amt Himmelpforten formed part of the Himmelpforten-based \"Canton de Himmelpforten\" in the Bouches-de-l'Elbe Department.\n\nIn 1813 the Duchy was restored to the Electorate of Hanover, which - after its upgrade to the Kingdom of Hanover in 1814 - incorporated the Duchy in a real union and the ducal territory, including the restituted Amt Himmelpforten with Himmelpforten, became part of the new Stade Region, established in 1823. Since in 1885 the Amt Himmelpforten merged in the new District of Stade Himmelpforten forms part of it.\n\nHimmelpforten is one of Germany's oldest Weihnachtspostämter or Christmas Post Offices, to which children can write letters to Santa and volunteers send responses.\n\nWhen in 1255 the Conventus Porta Coeli moved to Himmelpforten it still bore the name Eylsede/ Eulsete (literally: Eylo's/Eilhard's seat). The Latin name Porta Coeli () refers to the Christian imagery of Mary of Nazareth as the Gate of Heaven derived from Ezekiel's \"closed gate\" (), considered to have been opened by Mary as an incarnation of this prophecy. Eylsede later adopted the Low Saxon translation \"tor Hemmelporten\" or \"to der Himilporten\" of the convent's Latin name, now given in modern Low Saxon as Himmelpoorten and in standard High German as Himmelpforten.\n\nToday's Himmelpforten comprises the following localities and formerly independent municipalities:\n\nHimmelpforten is connected by the B 73 highway with the net of federal routes. Since 1 July 1881 the town is connected to the railway net with Himmelpforten station located almost at the middle of the Niederelbebahn line with towards Hamburg-Harburg station and towards Cuxhaven station.\n"}

Her most notable role was on the 1982 television series \"Square Pegs\", in which she co-starred as Lauren Hutchinson alongside Sarah Jessica Parker.\n\nBorn in Brooklyn, New York, Linker's first major acting role was as Kelly Lewis in the television series \"Lewis & Clark\", which ran for one season from 1981 to 1982. Shortly thereafter, Linker was cast as central character Lauren Hutchinson on the teen comedy/drama \"Square Pegs\". Square Pegs told the story of two high school freshmen, Hutchinson and Patty Greene (played by Sarah Jessica Parker), and their at times desperate attempts to fit in and achieve popularity. Linker was \"forced\" to wear fake braces and a fatsuit in order to appear less attractive than she actually was for the character she portrayed. Even though the show was praised by critics, it was cancelled after its first season. Square Pegs creator Anne Beatts revealed the show's abrupt demise came from unfortunate circumstances behind the scenes - specifically, drug abuse among the teenage cast. Beatts revealed in 2015, \"I think that certainly, there was some drug abuse or drug traffic that may have happened, because I would say that that is the norm for a set\". Devo member Gerald Casale also confirmed in 2009 about the drug use on set, saying \"The girls were out of control — they were doing drugs and they were making out and they were coming on to us in a big way... They might have been 15 or 16, but in their heads they were already 40. I don’t think there was a virgin on the set, except maybe a couple of the guys\". Most of the show's scenes were filmed at the abandoned Excelsior High School in the suburb of Norwalk, California. Because Norwalk was twenty miles from Norman Lear's studio and CBS Television in Los Angeles, it was hard to know what was happening during filming. Embassy Television received numerous reports of drug and alcohol abuse in the presence of minors, which caused then Embassy president Michael Grade to ask for an investigation and led him to pull the plug on the show shortly after the first season finished production.\n\nAfter \"Square Pegs\", Linker voiced the character of \"Robin\" on the animated \"Mister T\" series in 1983. After the show ended she enrolled in Wellesley College, graduating in 1989 with a degree in French studies.\n\nOther notable roles for Linker were as Sherie Lee Fox in the 1985 science fiction film \"D.A.R.Y.L.\", and as Jenny Pennoyer in the 1984 TV movie \"When We First Met\". Most recently, Linker appeared as the character Esmerelda on the television series \"Don't Make Me Sick\" in 2009.\n\nLinker attended Beverly Hills High School in Beverly Hills, California and Frenchwoods Festival of the Performing Arts camp. Since apparently quitting acting, she has worked in Internet marketing and worked as a second grade teacher. In 2012, she obtained her Master of Social Work from the University of Southern California, and now works as an outpatient community therapist.\n\n"}
{"id": "2044918", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2044918", "title": "Palestine Exploration Fund", "text": "Palestine Exploration Fund\n\nThe Palestine Exploration Fund is a British society based in London. It was founded in 1865, shortly after the completion of the Ordnance Survey of Jerusalem, and is the oldest known organization in the world created specifically for the study of the Levant region, also known as Palestine. Often simply known as the PEF, its initial object was to carry out surveys of the topography and ethnography of Ottoman Palestine – producing the PEF Survey of Palestine – with a remit that fell somewhere between an expeditionary survey and military intelligence gathering. It had a complex relationship with Corps of Royal Engineers, and its members sent back reports on the need to salvage and modernise the region.\n\nFollowing the completion of the Ordnance Survey of Jerusalem, the Biblical archaeologists and clergymen who supported the survey financed the creation of the fund, which took place on 22 June 1865 with initial funding of £300. The most notable of the founders were Arthur P. Stanley, the Dean of Westminster, and George Grove, who later founded the Royal College of Music and was responsible for \"Grove's Dictionary of Music\". Its founders established the fund \"for the purpose of investigating the Archaeology, Geography, manners, customs and culture, Geology and Natural History of the Holy Land\".\n\nThe roots of the Palestine Exploration Fund lie in a literary society founded by British Consul James Finn and his wife Elizabeth Anne Finn. Many photographs of Palestine have survived from this period. Frederick J. Bliss wrote of the foundation that \"[a]s far as its aims were concerned this organization was but a re-institution of a Society formed about the year 1804 under the name of the Palestine Association... it is interesting to note that the General Committee of the Palestine Exploration Fund recognized an organic connection with the earlier Society.\"\n\nThe preliminary meeting of the Society of the Palestine Exploration Fund took place in the Jerusalem Chamber of Westminster Abbey. William Thomson, the Archbishop of York, read out the original prospectus at the first organisational meeting;[O]ur object is strictly an inductive inquiry. We are not to be a religious society; we are not about to launch controversy; we are about to apply the rules of science, which are so well understood by us in our branches, to an investigation into the facts concerning the Holy Land. \"No country should be of so much interest to us as that in which the documents of our Faith were written, and the momentous events they describe enacted. At the same time no country more urgently requires illustration ... Even to a casual traveller in the Holy Land the Bible becomes, in its form, and therefore to some extent in its substance, a new book. Much would be gained by ...bringing to light the remains of so many races and generations which must lie concealed under the accumulation of rubbish and ruins on which those villages stand ...\n\nThe PEF conducted many early excavations of biblical and post-biblical sites around the Levant, as well as studies involving natural history, anthropology, history and geography.\n\nIn 1867, Charles Warren led PEF's biggest expedition. Warren and his team improved the topography of Jerusalem and discovered the ancient water systems that lay beneath the city of Jerusalem. The water system was later named Warren's Shaft, after Charles Warren, due to the discovery. They also made the first excavations of Tell es-Sultan, site of biblical city of Jericho. A 2013 publication, \"The Walls of the Temple Mount\", provided more specifics about Warren's work, as summarized in a book review.\"... he concentrated on excavating shafts down beneath the ground to the level of the lower parts of the external Temple Mount walls, recording the different types of stonework he encountered at different levels and other features, such as Robinson’s Arch on the western side and the Herodian street below it. ... in 1884 the PEF published a large portfolio of 50 of Warren’s maps, plans and drawings titled Plans, Elevations, Sections, etc., Shewing the Results of the Excavations at Jerusalem, 1867–70 (now known as the 'Warren Atlas').\"\n\nIn 1875, the Earl of Shaftesbury, a prominent social reformer, told the Annual General Meeting of the PEF that \"We have there a land teeming with fertility and rich in history, but almost without an inhabitant – a country without a people, and look! scattered over the world, a people without a country\". It was one of the earliest usages by a prominent politician of the phrase A land without a people for a people without a land, which was to become widely used by advocates of Jewish settlement in Palestine.\n\nIn 1878, the Treasurer's statement listed over 130 local associations in the United Kingdom (including Ireland). There were also branches in Canada and Australia as well as Gaza City and Jerusalem. Expenditure in 1877 amounted to £2,959 14s 11d.\n\nAmong other noteworthy individuals associated with the fund were:\n\n\nThe first 21 years of the fund are summarised in PEF (1886). Its chapters and personages mentioned include the following:\nIn his opening address (\"p.8\"), Archbishop Thomson laid down three basic principles for the Society:\nRegarding the latter, great emphasis was placed upon the nomenclature \"Holy Land\", so the notion of religion could never have been far away. Also (\"p.10\") stress was laid upon the fact that \"The Society numbers among its supporters Christians and Jews\". (Muslims were not mentioned.)\n\nElsewhere the following activities have been reported:\n\n\nThe Palestine Exploration Fund was also involved in the foundation of the British School of Archaeology in Jerusalem in 1919. The School worked with the Fund in joint excavations at Jerusalem's Ophel in the 1920s. The school's second director, John Winter Crowfoot, was Chairman of the PEF from 1945 to 1950.\n\nThrough the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, women were frequently employed by the Fund to carry baskets of soil from the excavations to the dump. These women also cut back brush and dug. The majority of these women remain nameless, as they were hired to perform hard labour on behalf of the trained archaeologists. Bliss took an active interest in the lives of his workers—though not necessarily in their well-being—recording a few names and stories. In his diary, Bliss wrote that most of the workers were from Bureir, a village six miles away from the Tell. Most of the men slept at camp, \"digging little shallow graves for a bed\", but \"the women and girls had the long walk both before and after work. Six miles’ walk before 6.30a.m., and six miles’ walk after 5p.m., with a hard day's work of carrying earth-piled baskets on the head in between\". He comments that this does not seem like an easy life, but more women and girls applied for work than he could employ.\n\nHeuda is one woman employed to work on an excavation with Bliss, at Tell el-Hesi. He first writes about her in 1891, noting that she is a capital worker though \"a bolder, wilder girl I never saw\". He describes her capacity to run all over the site and clear the trenches for excavation with wonder, also commenting on her good looks and marriage prospects. He writes about her cousin, Rizq, as well, and her abilities to haul earth. Bliss provided a unique insight into the lives of two of the women comprising the PEF workforce. Subsequent directors only referred to the women in their employ as anonymous labourers, sometimes complaining that they brought too much gossip—though in Bliss' journals, he recounts more familial and romantic tension that caused trouble on site among the men.\n\nFor some years, the fund's office was located north of Wigmore Street in the Marylebone section of the City of Westminster, London, but in early 2019, the PEF moved to 5-6 Dreadnought Walk, Greenwich, London.\n\nChief Executive and Curator of the PEF, Felicity Cobbing, told \"The Jordan Times\" that the Ottoman's Palestine region included historical Palestine, Jordan, southern Syria, Lebanon, the Sinai Peninsula and the island of Cyprus. The PEF's \"goal was – and remains – to study the country, its people and its natural, ancient and cultural heritage,\" she added. The new Greenwich headquarters provides more space for PEF collections and its specialist library. \"Now we can welcome many more scholars and we can look forward to developing collaborative projects with other institutions both in the UK and internationally,\" Cobbing said.\n\nThe PEF holds regular events and lectures and provides annual grants for various projects. In partnership with the British Museum Department of Middle East, the Palestine Exploration Fund hosts free lectures that reflect the diverse interests of their membership. The PEF also co-ordinates joint lectures with the Council for British Research in the Levant, the Anglo-Israel Archaeological Society, the Society for Arabian Studies, and the Egypt Exploration Society. Once a year, an Annual General Meeting (AGM) is held before an lecture.\n\nEach year the Palestine Exploration Fund offers grants for travel and research related to topics connected with its founding aims.\n\nThe committee welcomes interdisciplinary applications relating to the fund's aims, as well as those relating to the PEF's archival collections. The PEF grants are open to all members of the PEF or someone who is becoming a member.\n\nThe PEF's offices also house collections of photographs, maps, specimens, manuscripts, and paintings. At their location in London, there are collections over 6,000 artefacts that range in date from 40,000 B.C. to the 19th century. The archives contain over 40,000 photographs of Palestine, Jordan, and Syria. Objects come from sites in the South Levant, in particular from Jerusalem, Tell el Hesi, and Samaria. The material comes almost exclusively from PEF excavations carried out between the 1860s to the 1930s. Items on display include artefacts from excavations by Charles Warren, Sir William Flinders Petrie, Frederick Jones Bliss, and John Crowfoot. The PEF also has a collection of casts from original items that now reside in different areas around the world.\n\nAlso at the PEF is an archive of maps that is composed mainly of documents, letters, reports, plans and maps compiled by the explorers and scholars who worked for the PEF. These explorers include Charles Warren in Jerusalem and Palestine (1867–1870), Claude Conder and Horatio Kitchener on the Survey of Western Palestine (1872–1878), the Survey of Eastern Palestine (1880–81) and the Wady Arabah (1883-4), the excavations of Flinders Petrie and Frederick Jones Bliss at Tell el Hesi (1890-1892), the excavations of R.A.S. Macalister at Gezer (1902–06), Duncan Mackenzie's excavations at Ain Shems-Beth Shemesh in 1910–1912, C. L. Woolley and T. E. Lawrence on the Wilderness of Zin Survey (1913–14), and many others.\n\nIn addition to these items, the PEF also maintains a collection of photographs of expeditions, coins, natural history, models, and historic forgeries.\n\nThe PEF also houses a library containing books pertaining to the diverse interests of itself and its members.\n\nThe journal of the PEF devoted to the study of the history, archaeology and geography of the Levant is \"Palestine Exploration Quarterly\" which has appeared since 1869 (as \"Quarterly Statement\" up to 1937). There are currently three volumes published each year.\n\n\n\n"}

Eisenhower to review the fleet for Operation Overlord, the invasion of Normandy.\n\n\"MTB 102\" was sold off after the war, and converted to a private motor cruiser on the North Sea.\n\nIn April 1966 she was bought from Robinson's boatyard Oulton Broad by Mr Derek Brown from where she was berthed in a very unseaworthy condition and had been partially converted into a houseboat. Single-handedly Mr Brown completed extensive work and proceeded to launch \"MTB 102\".\n\nIn 1973 she was acquired by the 1st Blofield and Brundall Sea Scouts, of Norfolk, in whose care she remained until 1995 when ownership passed to the MTB102 Trust. The vessel came with the purchase of the plot of land used as the group's water-base at Brundall Marina, on Hobros Dyke.\n\nIn 1976 she was refurbished by a film company for use in the film \"The Eagle Has Landed\", and in the Dutch film \"Soldier of Orange\" the following year.\n\nIn 1977 she appeared for Queen Elizabeth II's Silver Jubilee pageant on the River Thames.\n\nIn 1983 and 1990 extensive structural repair work was carried out on the hull and decks totalling around £70,000 .\n\nSince 1979 she has made several appearances at Navy Days and is now listed as part of the National Historic Fleet.\n\nThe MTB 102 Trust was established in 1996 to fund the operation and maintenance of \"MTB 102\"; it is a registered charity under English law.\n\nSeveral changes of engines have occurred over her life. The original Italian Isotta Fraschini engines became difficult to maintain during the early part of the war as Italy was allied to Germany, though they lasted until replaced after the war when \"MTB 102\" was converted to civilian use. In 1985 Perkins Ltd donated two turbocharged diesel engines, and in 1996 and 2002 Cummins Marine provided new engines.\n\n\"102\" appeared as herself in the 2017 war film \"Dunkirk\".\n\n"}

He is well known for his work in numismatics and for compiling critical editions of ancient Sanskrit texts. His father, Dharmananda Damodar Kosambi, had studied ancient Indian texts with a particular emphasis on Buddhism and its literature in the Pali language. Damodar Kosambi emulated him by developing a keen interest in his country's ancient history. Kosambi was also a Marxist historian specialising in ancient India who employed the historical materialist approach in his work. He is particularly known for his classic work \"An Introduction to the Study of Indian History\".\n\nHe is described as \"the patriarch of the Marxist school of Indian historiography\". Kosambi was critical of the policies of then prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru, which, according to him, promoted capitalism in the guise of democratic socialism. He was an enthusiast of the Chinese revolution and its ideals, and, in addition, a leading activist in the World Peace Movement.\n\nDamodar Dharmananda Kosambi was born at Kosben in Portuguese Goa to the Buddhist scholar Dharmananda Damodar Kosambi. After a few years of schooling in India, in 1918, Damodar and his elder sister, Manik travelled to Cambridge, Massachusetts with their father, who had taken up a teaching position at the Cambridge Latin School. Their father was tasked by Professor Charles Rockwell Lanman of Harvard University to complete compiling a critical edition of \"Visuddhimagga\", a book on Buddhist philosophy, which was originally started by Henry Clarke Warren. There, the young Damodar spent a year in a Grammar school and then was admitted to the Cambridge High and Latin School in 1920. He became a member of the Cambridge branch of American Boy Scouts.\n\nIt was in Cambridge that he befriended another prodigy of the time, Norbert Wiener, whose father Leo Wiener was the elder Kosambi's colleague at Harvard University. Kosambi excelled in his final school examination and was one of the few candidates who was exempt on the basis of merit from necessarily passing an entrance examination essential at the time to gain admission to Harvard University. He enrolled in Harvard in 1924, but eventually postponed his studies, and returned to India. He stayed with his father who was now working in the Gujarat University, and was in the close circles of Mahatma Gandhi.\n\nIn January 1926, Kosambi returned to the US with his father, who once again studied at Harvard University for a year and half. Kosambi studied mathematics under George David Birkhoff, who wanted him to concentrate on mathematics, but the ambitious Kosambi instead took many diverse courses excelling in each of them. In 1929, Harvard awarded him the Bachelor of Arts degree with a . He was also granted membership to the esteemed Phi Beta Kappa Society, the oldest undergraduate honours organisation in the United States. He returned to India soon after.\n\nHe obtained the post of professor at the Banaras Hindu University (BHU), teaching German alongside mathematics. He struggled to pursue his research on his own, and published his first research paper, \"Precessions of an Elliptic Orbit\" in the \"Indian Journal of Physics\" in 1930.\n\nIn 1931, Kosambi married Nalini from the wealthy Madgaonkar family. It was in this year that he was hired by mathematician André Weil, then Professor of Mathematics at Aligarh Muslim University, to the post of lecturership in mathematics at Aligarh. His other colleagues at Aligarh included Vijayraghavan. During his two years stay in Aligarh, he produced eight research papers in the general area of Differential Geometry and Path Spaces. His fluency in several European languages allowed him to publish some of his early papers in French, Italian and German journals in their respective languages.\n\nIn 1932, he joined the Deccan Education Society's Fergusson College in Pune, where he taught mathematics for 14 years. In 1935, his eldest daughter, Maya was born, while in 1939, the youngest, Meera.\n\nIn 1944 he published a small article of 4 pages titled \"The Estimation of Map Distance from Recombination Values\" in \"Annals of Eugenics\", in which he introduced what later came to be known as Kosambi map function.\nkosambi's Function \nD.D.Kosambi (1907-1966)was an Indian mathematician whose contribution in genetics is remembered after name along with a mathematical expression as Haldane function. As per his equation genetic map distnance(w) is related to recombination fraction (θ) in the following way... \nor in other sense … θ = 0.5[ exp4w- 1/(exp4w+1)]\nKosambi’s mapping function adjusts the map distance based on interference which changes the proportion of double crossovers.(To know more about this you can explore the given website https://www.academia.edu/665254/Kosambi_and_the_genetic_mapping_function ( edit: Bhaskarlal Datta)\n\nOne of the most important contributions of Kosambi to statistics is the widely known technique called proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). Although it was originally developed by Kosambi in 1943, it is now referred to as the Karhunen–Loève expansion. In the 1943 paper entitled 'Statistics in Function Space' presented in the \"Journal of the Indian Mathematical Society\", Kosambi presented the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition some years before Karhunen (1945) and Loeve (1948). This tool has found application to such diverse fields as image processing, signal processing, data compression, oceanography, chemical engineering and fluid mechanics. Unfortunately this most important contribution of his is barely acknowledged in most papers that utilise the POD method. In recent years though, some authors have indeed referred to it as the Kosambi-Karhunen-Loeve decomposition.\n\nUntil 1939, Kosambi was almost exclusively focused on mathematical research, but later, he gradually started foraying into social sciences. It was his studies in numismatics that initiated him into the field of historical research. He did extensive research in difficult science of numismatics. His evaluation of data was by modern statistical methods. For example, he statistically analyzed the weight of thousands of punch-marked coins from different Indian museums to establish their chronological sequence and put forward his theories about the economic conditions under which these coins could have been minted.\n\nHe made a thorough study of Sanskrit and ancient literature, and he started his classic work on the ancient poet Bhartṛhari. He published his critical editions of Bhartrihari's Śatakatraya and Subhashitas during 1945–1948.\n\nIt was during this period that he started his political activism, coming close to the radical streams in the ongoing Independence movement, especially the Communist Party of India. He became an outspoken Marxist and wrote some political articles.\n\nIn the 1940s, Homi J. Bhabha invited Kosambi to join the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR). Kosambi joined TIFR as Chair for Mathematics in 1946, and held the position for the next 16 years. He continued to live in his own house in Pune, and used to travel to Mumbai every day by the Deccan Queen train.\n\nAfter independence, in 1948–49 he was sent to England and to the USA as a UNESCO Fellow to study the theoretical and technical aspects of computing machines. In London, he started his long-lasting friendship with Indologist and historian A.L. Basham. In the spring semester of 1949, he was a visiting professor of geometry in the Mathematics Department at the University of Chicago, where his colleague from his Harvard days, Marshall Harvey Stone, was the chair. In April–May 1949, he spent nearly two months at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, discussing with such illustrious physicists and mathematicians as J. Robert Oppenheimer, Hermann Weyl, John von Neumann, Marston Morse, Oswald Veblen and Carl Ludwig Siegel amongst others.\n\nAfter his return to India, in the Cold War circumstances, he was increasingly drawn into the World Peace Movement and served as a Member of the World Peace Council. He became a tireless crusader for peace, campaigning against the nuclearisation of the world. Kosambi's solution to India's energy needs was in sharp conflict with the ambitions of the Indian ruling class. He proposed alternative energy sources, like solar power. His activism in the peace movement took him to Beijing, Helsinki and Moscow. However, during this period he relentlessly pursued his diverse research interests, too. Most importantly, he worked on his Marxist rewriting of ancient Indian history, which culminated in his book, \"An Introduction to the Study of Indian History\" (1956).\n\nHe visited China many times during 1952–62 and was able to watch the Chinese revolution very closely, making him critical of the way modernisation and development were envisaged and pursued by the Indian ruling classes. All these contributed to straining his relationship with the Indian government and Bhabha, eventually leading to Kosambi's exit from the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in 1962.\n\nHis exit from the TIFR gave Kosambi the opportunity to concentrate on his research in ancient Indian history culminating in his book, \"The Culture and Civilisation of Ancient India\", which was published in 1965 by Routledge, Kegan & Paul. The book was translated into German, French and Japanese and was widely acclaimed. He also utilised his time in archaeological studies, and contributed in the field of statistics and number theory. His article on numismatics was published in February 1965 in Scientific American.\n\nDue to the efforts of his friends and colleagues, in June 1964, Kosambi was appointed as a Scientist Emeritus of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) affiliated with the Maharashtra \"Vidnyanvardhini\" in Pune. He pursued many historical, scientific and archaeological projects (even writing stories for children). But most works he produced in this period could not be published during his lifetime.\n\nKosambi died of myocardial infarction in the early hours of 29 June 1966, after being declared generally fit by his family doctor on the previous day.\n\nHe was posthumously decorated with the \"Hari Om Ashram Award\" by the government of India's University Grant Commission in 1980.\n\nHis friend A.L. Basham, a well-known indologist, wrote in his obituary:\n\nAlthough Kosambi was not a practising historian, he wrote four books and sixty articles on history: these works had a significant impact on the field of Indian historiography. He understood history in terms of the dynamics of socio-economic formations rather than just a chronological narration of \"episodes\" or the feats of a few great men – kings, warriors or saints. In the very first paragraph of his classic work, \"An Introduction to the Study of Indian History\", he gives an insight into his methodology as a prelude to his life work on ancient Indian history:\n\nAccording to A. L. Basham, \"\"An Introduction to the Study of Indian History\" is in many respects an epoch making work, containing brilliantly original ideas on almost every page; if it contains errors and misrepresentations, if now and then its author attempts to force his data into a rather doctrinaire pattern, this does not appreciably lessen the significance of this very exciting book, which has stimulated the thought of thousands of students throughout the world.\"\n\nProfessor Sumit Sarkar says: \"Indian Historiography, starting with D.D. Kosambi in the 1950s, is acknowledged the world over – wherever South Asian history is taught or studied – as quite on a par with or even superior to all that is produced abroad. And that is why Irfan Habib or Romila Thapar or R.S. Sharma are figures respected even in the most diehard anti-Communist American universities. They cannot be ignored if you are studying South Asian history.\"\n\nIn his obituary of Kosambi published in \"Nature\", J. D. Bernal had summed up Kosambi's talent as follows: \"Kosambi introduced a new method into historical scholarship, essentially by application of modern mathematics. By statistical study of the weights of the coins, Kosambi was able to establish the amount of time that had elapsed while they were in circulation and so set them in order to give some idea of their respective ages.\"\n\nKosambi is an inspiration to many across the world, especially to Sanskrit philologists and Marxist scholars. He is one of the few along with James Mill and Vincent Smith, who has so deeply influenced the writing of Indian history. The Government of Goa has instituted the annual D.D. Kosambi Festival of Ideas since February 2008 to commemorate his birth centenary.\n\nHistorian Irfan Habib said, \"D. D. Kosambi and R.S. Sharma, together with Daniel Thorner, brought peasants into the study of Indian history for the first time.\"\n\nKosambi was an atheist.\n\nIndia Post issued a commemorative postage stamp on 31 July 2008 to honour Kosambi.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the papers listed below, Kosambi wrote two books in mathematics, the manuscripts of which have not been traced. The first was a book on path geometry that was submitted to Marston Morse in the mid-1940s and the second was on prime numbers, submitted shortly before his death. Unfortunately, neither book was published. The list of articles below is complete but does not include his essays on science and scientists, some of which have appeared in the collection \"Science, Society, and Peace\" (People's Publishing House, 1995). Four articles (between 1962 and 1965) are written under the pseudonym S. Ducray.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Adhesion traction is the friction between the drive wheels and the steel rail. The term \"adhesion railway\" is only used when there is need to distinguish adhesion railways from railways moved by other means, e.g. by a stationary engine pulling on a cable attached to the cars, by railways which are moved by a pinion meshing with a rack, etc.\n\nThis article focuses on the technical detail of what happens as a result of friction between the wheels and rails in what is known as the wheel-rail interface or contact patch. There are the good forces, e.g. the traction force, the braking forces, the centering forces, all of which contribute to stable running. There are the bad forces which increase costs by requiring more fuel consumption and increasing maintenance that is needed to address fatigue (material) damage, wear on rail heads and on the wheel rims, and rail movement from traction and braking forces.\n\nThe interface between the wheel and the rail is a specialist subject with continual research being done.\n\nTraction or friction is reduced when the top of the rail is wet or frosty or contaminated with grease, oil or decomposing leaves which compact into a hard slippery lignin coating. Leaf contamination can be removed by applying \"Sandite\" (a gel-sand mix) from maintenance trains, using scrubbers and water jets, and can be reduced with long-term management of railside vegetation. Locomotives and streetcars/trams use sand to improve traction when driving wheels start to slip.\n\nAdhesion is caused by friction, with maximum tangential force produced by a driving wheel before slipping given by:\n\nUsually the force needed to start sliding is greater than that needed to continue sliding. The former is concerned with static friction (also known as \"stiction\") or \"limiting friction\", whilst the latter is dynamic friction, also called \"sliding friction\".\n\nFor steel on steel, the coefficient of friction can be as high as 0.78, under laboratory conditions, but typically on railways it is between 0.35 and 0.5, whilst under extreme conditions it can fall to as low as 0.05. Thus a 100-tonne locomotive could have a tractive effort of 350 kilonewtons, under the ideal conditions (assuming sufficient force can be produced by the engine), falling to a 50 kilonewtons under the worst conditions.\n\nSteam locomotives suffer particularly badly from adhesion issues because the traction force at the wheel rim fluctuates (especially in 2- or most 4-cylinder engines) and, on large locomotives, not all wheels are driven. The \"factor of adhesion\", being the weight on the driven wheels divided by the theoretical starting tractive effort, was generally designed to be a value of 4 or slightly higher, reflecting a typical wheel-rail friction coefficient of 0.25. A locomotive with a factor of adhesion much lower than 4 would be highly prone to wheelslip, although some 3-cylinder locomotives, such as the SR V Schools class, operated with a factor of adhesion below 4 because the traction force at the wheel rim do not fluctuate as much. Other factors affecting the likelihood of wheelslip include wheel size and the sensitivity of the regulator/skill of the driver.\n\nThe term \"all-weather adhesion\" is usually used in North America, and refers to the adhesion available during traction mode with 99% reliability in all weather conditions.\n\nThe maximum speed a train can proceed around a turn is limited by the radius of turn, the position of the centre of mass of the units, the wheel gauge and whether the track is \"superelevated\" or \"canted\".\n\nToppling will occur when the overturning moment due to the side force (centrifugal acceleration) is sufficient to cause the inner wheel to begin to lift off the rail. This may result in loss of adhesion - causing the train to slow, preventing toppling. Alternatively, the inertia may be sufficient to cause the train to continue to move at speed causing the vehicle to topple completely.\n\nFor a wheel gauge of 1.5 m, no canting, a centre of gravity height of 3 m and speed of 30 m/s (108 km/h), the radius of turn is 360 m. For a modern high speed train at 80 m/s, the toppling limit would be about 2.5 km. In practice, the minimum radius of turn is much greater than this, as contact between the wheel flanges and rail at high speed could cause significant damage to both. For very high speed, the minimum adhesion limit again appears appropriate, implying a radius of turn of about 13 km. In practice, curved lines used for high speed travel are \"superelevated\" or \"canted\" so that the turn limit is closer to 7 km.\n\nDuring the 19th century, it was widely believed that coupling the drive wheels would compromise performance and was avoided on engines intended for express passenger service. With a single drive wheelset, the Hertzian contact stress between the wheel and rail necessitated the largest diameter wheels that could be accommodated. The weight of locomotive was restricted by the stress on the rail and sandboxes were required, even under reasonable adhesion conditions.\n\nIt may be thought that the wheels are kept on the tracks by the flanges. However, close examination of a typical railway wheel reveals that the tread is burnished but the flange is not—the flanges rarely make contact with the rail and, when they do, most of the contact is sliding. The rubbing of a flange on the track dissipates large amounts of energy, mainly as heat but also including noise and, if sustained, would lead to excessive wheel wear.\n\nCentering is actually accomplished through shaping of the wheel. The tread of the wheel is slightly tapered. When the train is in the centre of the track, the region of the wheels in contact with the rail traces out a circle which has the same diameter for both wheels. The velocities of the two wheels are equal, so the train moves in a straight line.\n\nIf, however, the wheelset is displaced to one side, the diameters of the regions of contact, and hence the tangential velocities of the wheels at the running surfaces are different and the wheelset tends to steer back towards the centre. Also, when the train encounters an unbanked turn, the wheelset displaces laterally slightly, so that the outer wheel tread speeds up linearly, and the inner wheel tread slows down, causing the train to turn the corner. Some railway systems employ a flat wheel and track profile, relying on cant alone to reduce or eliminate flange contact.\n\nUnderstanding how the train stays on the track, it becomes evident why Victorian locomotive engineers were averse to coupling wheelsets. This simple coning action is possible only with wheelsets where each can have some free motion about its vertical axis. If wheelsets are rigidly coupled together, this motion is restricted, so that coupling the wheels would be expected to introduce sliding, resulting in increased rolling losses. This problem was alleviated to a great extent by ensuring the diameter of all coupled wheels was very closely matched.\n\nWith perfect rolling contact between the wheel and rail, this coning behaviour manifests itself as a swaying of the train from side to side. In practice, the swaying is damped out below a critical speed, but is amplified by the forward motion of the train above the critical speed. This lateral swaying is known as hunting oscillation. The phenomenon of hunting was known by the end of the 19th century, although the cause was not fully understood until the 1920s and measures to eliminate it were not taken until the late 1960s. The limitation on maximum speed was imposed not by raw power but by encountering an instability in the motion.\n\nThe kinematic description of the motion of tapered treads on the two rails is insufficient to describe hunting well enough to predict the critical speed. It is necessary to deal with the forces involved. There are two phenomena which must be taken into account. The first is the inertia of the wheelsets and vehicle bodies, giving rise to forces proportional to acceleration; the second is the distortion of the wheel and track at the point of contact, giving rise to elastic forces. The kinematic approximation corresponds to the case which is dominated by contact forces.\n\nAn analysis of the kinematics of the coning action yields an estimate of the wavelength of the lateral oscillation:\n\nwhere \"d\" is the wheel gauge, \"r\" is the nominal wheel radius and \"k\" is the taper of the treads. For a given speed, the longer the wavelength and the lower the inertial forces will be, so the more likely it is that the oscillation will be damped out. Since the wavelength increases with reducing taper, increasing the critical speed requires the taper to be reduced, which implies a large minimum radius of turn.\n\nA more complete analysis, taking account of the actual forces acting, yields the following result for the critical speed of a wheelset:\n\nwhere \"W\" is the axle load for the wheelset, \"a\" is a shape factor related to the amount of wear on the wheel and rail, \"C\" is the moment of inertia of the wheelset perpendicular to the axle, \"m\" is the wheelset mass.\n\nThe result is consistent with the kinematic result in that the critical speed depends inversely on the taper. It also implies that the weight of the rotating mass should be minimised compared with the weight of the vehicle. The wheel gauge implicitly appears in both the numerator and denominator, implying that it has only a second-order effect on the critical speed.\n\nThe true situation is much more complicated, as the response of the vehicle suspension must be taken into account. Restraining springs, opposing the yaw motion of the wheelset, and similar restraints on bogies, may be used to raise the critical speed further. However, in order to achieve the highest speeds without encountering instability, a significant reduction in wheel taper is necessary. For example, taper on Shinkansen wheel treads was reduced to 1:40 (when the Shinkansen first ran) for both stability at high speeds and performance on curves. That said, from the 1980s onwards, the Shinkansen engineers developed an effective taper of 1:16 by tapering the wheel with multiple arcs, so that the wheel could work effectively both at high speed as well as at sharper curves.\n\nThe behaviour of vehicles moving on adhesion railways is determined by the forces arising between two surfaces in contact. This may appear trivially simple from a superficial glance but it becomes extremely complex when studied to the depth necessary to predict useful results.\n\nThe first error to address is the assumption that wheels are round. A glance at the tyres of a parked car will immediately show that this is not true: the region in contact with the road is noticeably flattened, so that the wheel and road conform to each other over a region of contact. If this were not the case, the contact stress of a load being transferred through a line contact would be infinite. Rails and railway wheels are much stiffer than pneumatic tyres and tarmac but the same distortion takes place at the region of contact. Typically, the area of contact is elliptical, of the order of 15 mm across.\n\nThe distortion in the wheel and rail is small and localised but the forces which arise from it are large. In addition to the distortion due to the weight, both wheel and rail distort when braking and accelerating forces are applied and when the vehicle is subjected to side forces. These tangential forces cause distortion in the region where they first come into contact, followed by a region of slippage. The net result is that, during traction, the wheel does not advance as far as would be expected from rolling contact but, during braking, it advances further. This mix of elastic distortion and local slipping is known as \"creep\" (not to be confused with the creep of materials under constant load). The definition of creep in this context is:\n\nIn analysing the dynamics of wheelsets and complete rail vehicles, the contact forces can be treated as linearly dependent on the creep (Joost Jacques Kalker's linear theory, valid for small creepage) or more advanced theories can be used from frictional contact mechanics.\n\nThe forces which result in directional stability, propulsion and braking may all be traced to creep. It is present in a single wheelset and will accommodate the slight kinematic incompatibility introduced by coupling wheelsets together, without causing gross slippage, as was once feared.\n\nProvided the radius of turn is sufficiently great (as should be expected for express passenger services), two or three linked wheelsets should not present a problem. However, 10 drive wheels (5 main wheelsets) are usually associated with heavy freight locomotives.\n\nThe adhesion railway relies on a combination of friction and weight to start a train. The heaviest trains need the highest friction and the heaviest locomotive. The friction can vary a great deal but it was known on early railways that sand helped and it is still used today, even on locomotives with modern traction controls. To start the heaviest trains the locomotive has to be as heavy as can be stood by the bridges along the route and the track itself, and all the weight of the locomotive has to be shared equally by the wheels that are driven with no weight transfer as the starting effort builds up. The wheels have to turn with as steady a driving force as possible on the very small contact area of about 1 sq cm between each wheel and the top of the rail. The top of the rail has to be dry with no man-made or weather-related contamination, such as oil or rain. Friction-enhancing sand or an equivalent is needed though. All the driving wheels have to turn faster than the locomotive is moving (known as creep control) to make use of the maximum coefficient of friction that is available and all axles have to be driven independently with their own controller because different axles will see different conditions. The maximum available friction occurs when the wheels are slipping/creeping. If contamination is unavoidable the wheels have to be driven with more creep because although friction is lowered with contamination the maximum obtainable under those conditions occurs at greater values of creep. The controllers have to respond to different friction conditions along the track.\n\nSome of the above requirements were a challenge for steam locomotive designers - \"sanding systems that did not work, controls that were inconvenient to operate, lubrication that spewed oil everywhere, drains that wetted the rails, and so on..\" Others had to wait for modern electric transmissions on diesel and electric locomotives.\n\nThe above requirements disappear as the train picks up some speed because the frictional effort needed at the rails drops steadily with increasing speed and the nature of the wheel/rail contact patch changes as described below.\n\nA driven wheel does not roll but actually turns faster than the corresponding locomotive movement and the difference between the two is known as the \"slip velocity\". \"Slip\" is the \"slip velocity\" compared to the \"vehicle velocity\". When a wheel rolls freely along the rail the contact patch is in what is known as a \"stick\" condition. If the wheel is driven or braked the proportion of the contact patch with the \"stick\" condition gets smaller and a gradually increasing proportion is in what is known as a \"slip condition\". This diminishing \"stick\" area and increasing \"slip\" area supports a gradual increase in the traction or braking torque that can be sustained as the force at the wheel rim increases until the whole area is \"slip\". The \"slip\" area provides the traction. During the transition from the \"all-stick\" no-torque to the \"all-slip\" condition the wheel has had a gradual increase in slip, also known as creep and creepage. High adhesion locomotives control wheel creep to give maximum effort when starting and pulling a heavy train slowly.\n\nSlip is the additional speed that the wheel has and creep is the slip level divided by the locomotive speed. These parameters are those that are measured and which go into the creep controller.\n\nOn an adhesion railway, most locomotives will have a sand containment vessel. Properly dried sand can be dropped onto the rail to improve traction under slippery conditions. The sand is most often applied using compressed air via tower, crane, silo or train. When an engine slips, particularly when starting a heavy train, sand applied at the front of the driving wheels greatly aids in tractive effort causing the train to \"lift\", or to commence the motion intended by the engine driver.\n\nSanding however also has some negative effects. It can cause a \"sandfilm\", which consists of crushed sand, that is compressed to a film on the track where the wheels make contact. Together with some moisture on the track, which acts as a light adhesive and keeps the applied sand on the track, the wheels \"bake\" the crushed sand into a more solid layer of sand. Because the sand is applied to the first wheels on the locomotive, the following wheels may run, at least partially and for a limited time, on a layer of sand (sandfilm). While traveling this means that electric locomotives may lose contact to the track-ground, causing the locomotive to create electromagnetic interference and currents through the couplers. In standstill, when the locomotive is parked, track circuits may detect an empty track because the locomotive is electrically isolated from the track.\n\n\n"}

According to the clouds' different physical properties, this can be done using airplanes or rockets to sow to the clouds with catalysts such as dry ice, silver iodide and salt powder, to make clouds rain or increase precipitation, to remove or mitigate farmland drought, to increase reservoir irrigation water or water supply capacity, to increase water levels for power generation, or even to solve the global warming problem. \n\nIn the United States, rainmaking was attempted by traveling showmen. It was practiced in the old west, but may have reached a peak during the dust bowl drought of the American West and Midwest in the 1930s. The practice was depicted in the 1956 film \"The Rainmaker\". Attempts to bring rain directly have waned with development of the science of meteorology, the advent of laws against fraud and increased communication technology, with some exceptions such as cloud seeding and forms of prayer including rain dances, which are still practiced today. Prayer for more rain is also a cultural practice for Christians and Muslims in areas which people keep \"traditional\" non-scriptural religions. In the Christian areas the Defteras (learned clerics of the Orthodox Christian Church) believed to have the wisdom to arrest the rain, to bring hail to farms of individuals who refuse to comply with religious rules as well as to bring more rains when the rainy season fell short of giving the usual amount of rain needed for growing cereals. \n\nThe term is also used metaphorically to describe the process of bringing new clients into a professional practice, such as law, architecture, consulting, advertising, or investment banking—in general, processes that bring money into a company.\n\nIt is also used to describe a confidence trick where the scammer takes money from the victim to influence a system over which they have no real control, but a random chance of the outcome happening anyway.\n\nSince the 1940s, cloud seeding has been used to change the structure of clouds by dispersing substances into the air, potentially increasing or altering rainfall. In spite of experiments dating back to at least the start of the 20th century, however, there is much controversy surrounding the efficacy of cloud seeding, and evidence that cloud seeding leads to increased precipitation on the ground is highly equivocal. One difficulty is knowing how much precipitation might have fallen had any particular cloud not been seeded. Operation Popeye was a US military rainmaking operation to increase rains over Vietnam during the Vietnam War in order to slow Vietnamese military truck activity in the region. Rainmaking is not climate engineering, which seeks to alter climate, but a form of weather modification, as it seeks only to change local weather.\n\nAustrian-American psychoanalyst Wilhelm Reich designed a \"cloudbuster\" in the United States with which he said he could manipulate streams of \"orgone energy\" (which he claimed was a primordial cosmic energy) in the atmosphere to induce rain by forcing clouds to form and disperse. It was a set of hollow metal pipes and cables inserted into water, which Reich argued created a stronger orgone energy field than was in the atmosphere, the water drawing the atmospheric orgone through the pipes. Reich called his research \"Cosmic Orgone Engineering\".\n\nIn many societies around the world, rain dances and other rituals have been used to attempt to increase rainfall. Some Native Americans used rain dances extensively. European examples include the Romanian ceremonies known as paparuda and caloian. Some United States farmers also attempt to bring rain during droughts through prayer. These rituals differ greatly in their specifics, but share a common concern with bringing rain through ritual and/or spiritual means. Typical of these ceremonies was then-governor of Georgia Sonny Perdue's public prayer service for rain, in 2007.\n\nContemporary Jewish liturgy includes prayers for rain, seasonally, as a part of the morning, afternoon, and evening, daily amidah prayer, during mid-Autumn to mid-Spring. During Summer, this prayer is changed from the prayer for rain, to a prayer for dew.\n\n\n\n"}

Riverscapes can be divided into upper course riverscapes, middle course riverscapes, and lower course riverscapes.\nThe term riverine is sometimes used to indicate the same type of landscape as a riverscape, or only the riverbank. Riverine landscapes may also be defined as a network of rivers and their surrounding land, which is excellent for agricultural use because of the rich and fertile soil. The word \"riverine\" is also used as an adjective which means \"relating to or found on a river, or the banks of a river\".\n\nIn the upper course of rivers, channels are narrow and gradients are steep. Vertical erosion is the prominent land-forming process. Typical features of upper course riverscapes include:\n\nIn the middle course of rivers, the discharge increases and the gradient flattens out. Typical features of middle course riverscapes include:\n\nIn the lower course of rivers, the channels are wide and deep, and the discharge is at its highest.

He is of mixed race (Inuvialuk, Chippewa-Dene and German). He is the oldest of seven children, who were all adopted out as part of the Canadian government's failed attempt at forcing Inuit and First Nations children to assimilate into white society. Schweig's biological mother died of alcoholism in 1989. He never met her. \"She didn’t drink a drop of alcohol until we were taken away,\" says Schweig. \"We were part of the whole assimilation program—forcibly taken away, although my adoptive parents told me I wasn't.\" Schweig was adopted at six months of age by an English speaking German-French family. He spent his childhood in Inuvik until he was six, when his family moved to Bermuda. They later moved back to Canada.\n\n\"I eventually grew tired of living in a prison without walls and ran away when I was 16. What transpired between then and now has been a roller coaster of alcohol, drugs, violence, failed relationships, despair and confusion. Who am I? Where do I come from? Where is my family? Where do I belong? When life's mystery has been shattered by strangers watching over you, a lot of these questions are lost.\" \n\nSchweig ran away to Toronto, Ontario, where he supported himself by framing houses. In 1985, he was part of the cast of \"The Cradle Will Fall\", an experimental adaptation of Frank Wedekind's \"Spring Awakening\" produced by Theatre of Change at the Actor's Lab; this was his first experience as an actor. In 1987, at twenty years old, he was approached by a producer who suggested he audition for a role in the movie called \"The Shaman's Source\" (1990). With little formal education or experience he won the role. The film launched his career in the film industry.\n\nSchweig's numerous screen credits (over thirty) include his portrayal of Uncas in the epic motion picture \"The Last of the Mohicans\" (1992) and Pike Dexter in the movie \"Big Eden\" (2000), for which he won the Grand Jury Prize at the Outfest film festival. In 1992, he was cast as Black Thunder in the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation mini-series \"By Way of the Stars\". Among his period film credits since \"The Last of the Mohicans\", Eric became the famous Mohawk leader Joseph Brant/Thayendanegea for TNT's telefilm \"The Broken Chain\" (1993), playing for the first time the main character in a movie (Schweig appeared with Wes Studi again for this motion picture). It was shot primarily in North Carolina. He starred in Disney's \"The Scarlet Letter\" and \"Tom and Huck\" with Amy Wright in 1995. In 1996 he appeared as a Comanche protagonist, Buffalo Hump, in the Larry McMurtry miniseries Dead Man's Walk. More recently, he played the lead role in films addressing more contemporary issues facing aboriginal and Native American people: \"Skins\" (2002), \"Cowboys and Indians: The J.J. Harper Story\" (2003) and \"One Dead Indian\" (2006).\n\nDuring the 1990s, Schweig began carving masks as a natural extension of his artistic expression. Since his childhood, Eric found he was emotionally pre-disposed to carving small objects out of wood (figures, kayak, etc.). Under the tutelage of artist Vern Etzerza, he studied traditional Pacific Coast before directing his talent specifically towards custom and traditional Inuit Spirit Masks, in collaboration with master carver Art Thompson. His collection of masks are not only successful attempts to reconnect with his heritage and with Inuit art, but his carvings are also necessary labours of psychological resilience facing a traumatized childhood. As a disastrous consequence of this uprooting and abuse, Schweig struggled for many years with alcohol abuse. He has stated that \"Big Eden\" (2000) was the first movie in which he was entirely sober. His fame as an actor gives him the opportunity to share his life's experience in numerous speaking engagements in Canada and the United States of America. He is able to make large audiences aware of aboriginal issues, including adoption, the foster care system, addictions, and suicide. He currently resides in Vancouver BC working at Vancouver Native Health's \"Positive Outlook\" program where residents of the city's downtown eastside who are HIV positive can gain access to health care, hot meals, and social programming to maintain community connections.\n\nIn 2017, Eric adopted two foster siblings. When asked about the transition to fostering, Eric said, “I went from 30 years of bachelorhood to Mr. Mom overnight. Everything changed, I went from only having to consider myself for every decision to centering everything on my foster kids. It was a real 180.” Eric now lives in Vancouver with his son and daughter.\n\n\nIn 1993, he came in 5th on People Magazine's 50 Most Beautiful People list.\n\n"}

He also worked at Paramount Pictures, where he produced films as well as supervising their music department.\n\nMorros was born in Saint Petersburg, Russia. He emigrated with his family in late in 1922, sailing from the Port of Constantinople to the Port of New York on the S/S \"Constantinople\". In 1934, he was enlisted as a Soviet spy, following which time Vasily Zarubin became his first contact in 1936.\n\nThe mysterious \"Mr Guver\" letter, sent to FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover in 1943 from an anonymous source, who is now widely believed to be KGB Officer Vasily Mironov, named Morros as an agent working with Soviet intelligence and identified Elizabeth Zarubina as Morros' contact.\n\nIn December 1943, Zarubin drove with Morros to Connecticut, where they met with Alfred Stern and his wife Martha Dodd Stern. Soviet intelligence wanted to use an investment from the Sterns in Morros' sheet music company to serve as cover for espionage. The Sterns invested $130,000 in the Boris Morros Music Company.\n\nIn 1947, Morros became a counterspy for the FBI. He reported on Jack Soble and members of the Soble spy ring, while also passing low-level secrets and misinformation back to Moscow. Morros' codename in Soviet intelligence and the Venona files was \"FROST.\"\n\nAs a double-agent for the FBI, Morros solicited funds from the MGB (the Soviet intelligence service) to create a U.S. television network. Like the Boris Morros Music Company, the network would have served as espionage cover, but the MGB never funded the venture.\n\nIn 1960, \"Man on a String\", a feature film loosely based on Morros' adventures as a counterspy, was released. Ernest Borgnine played Morros, who co-wrote the screenplay.\n\nMorros, who was employed by Paramount Pictures, worked there in several capacities. His movie production credits include \"The Flying Deuces\" (1939) with Laurel and Hardy and \"Second Chorus\" (1940) with Paulette Goddard and Fred Astaire. Morros also worked with Bing Crosby, Ginger Rogers, Martha Raye, and Rudy Vallee. Morros was also the music director at Paramount, where he conducted the music of such composers as George Antheil, among others.\n\nHe died in New York City on January 8, 1963.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2044986", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2044986", "title": "Battle of Somosierra", "text": "Battle of Somosierra\n\nThe Battle of Somosierra took place on November 30, 1808, during the Peninsular War, when a combined Franco-Spanish-Polish force under the direct command of Napoleon Bonaparte forced a passage through against Spanish guerrillas stationed at the Sierra de Guadarrama which was shielding Madrid from direct French attack. At the Somosierra mountain pass, 60 miles north of Madrid, a heavily outnumbered Spanish detachment of conscripts and artillery under Benito de San Juan aimed to block Napoleon's advance on the Spanish capital. Napoleon overwhelmed the Spanish positions in a combined arms attack, sending the Polish \"Chevau-légers\" of the Imperial Guard at the Spanish guns while French infantry advanced up the slopes. The victory removed the last obstacle barring the road to Madrid, which fell several days later.\n\nBy late November 1808 the French \"Grande Armée\" had overwhelmed and destroyed both wings of the Spanish popular army. To complete his reconquest of Spain, Napoleon advanced on Madrid with 40,000 men. General San Juan mustered an ad hoc army of militia, reservists and various regular regiments still reeling from earlier defeats – in all about 12,000 men – to defend Madrid. In order to screen the many approaches to the city, San Juan dispersed his already greatly outnumbered forces. Under his orders, 9,000 men were sent west to guard the Guadarrama pass while 3,000 occupied an advanced post at Sepulveda, leaving only 9,000 men and 16 guns on the heights of Somosierra. The nature of the terrain and the tenacity of the Spaniards initially worked in their favor. On the evening of November 29 the brigade at Sepulveda repulsed a French attack, inflicted heavy casualties and escaped from overwhelming French numbers in the gathering darkness to the west. The following morning Napoleon advanced his infantry directly toward the pass while small detachments crept up the flanks. Exchanging musket volleys with the defenders, the French made slow but measurable progress toward the enemy guns.\n\nBecause the Spanish forces could not easily be outflanked by infantry movement, and Napoleon was impatient to proceed, he ordered his Polish \"Chevaux-Légers\" escort squadron of 125 men to charge the Spaniards and their fortified artillery batteries. To that number must be added members of other squadrons, totaling some 450 men, but these entered the battle later. The charge of 125 against the batteries was joined by Niegolewski's platoon returning from reconnaissance. It is not clear, however, whether the number included only front-line troops (\"sabres\") or all the soldiers in the units. Napoleon issued no written orders. Jan Kozietulski, who commanded the 3rd squadron that day, mentioned that he called, \"\"Lekka jazda kłusem!\"\" (\"Light cavalry at the trot!\") and, passing the little bridge, added, \"\"En avant, Vive l'Empereur!\"\" (Forward, long live the Emperor\"!\"\")Some authors have assumed that Napoleon had gone out of his mind in ordering the Poles to charge batteries of 16 cannon over several kilometers of extremely difficult terrain. Others, however, think Napoleon ordered only the closest battery to be taken, in order to open the way for his infantry, and that Kozietulski had misunderstood the order. No matter – once the charge had begun, and the \"chevaux-légers\" found themselves under fire from the second battery, they had no choice but to press the attack, as the horses went to the highest speed and were unable to stop. They took the second and third batteries but only a few chevaux-légers reached the last battery, and the Spanish attempted to recapture it. It was then that Napoleon saw his chance and immediately committed the other squadrons.\n\nBenito de San Juan had 16 cannon at his disposal, arranged in four batteries. Some accounts, based mostly on recollections of French officers, assume that the Spaniards placed all their guns at the peak of Somosierra pass. However, with a range of 600–800 metres, the cannons, deployed in this fashion, could not have struck much of the French army—and there were reports that Napoleon himself was at times under artillery fire. The first battery defended the entrance to the Somosierra pass, the next two covered the pass at its angles and the fourth, only, stood by the heights. It was assumed that all batteries had four cannons, and later theories that the pass was too narrow for that to be possible should be treated as legends.\n13th Bulletin of the Army of Spain mentioned that chevau-légers were commanded by Gen. Louis Pierre, Count Montbrun. However, both Polish charge participants mentioned above and Lt. Col. Pierre Dautancourt, one of the French tutors of the unit, stressed in their accounts that such was not the case. Datancourt mentioned that Montbrun in conversations with him had laughed at that idea. Yet French historian Adolphe Thiers gave him the honor of leading the charge, which caused a protest by surviving Polish participants of the battle. Maj. Philippe de Ségur in his memoirs wrote that he had commanded the charge, but his accounts were often described as unreliable and, again, both Dautancourt and the Poles denied his role in it.\n\nThe charge was led by Kozietulski, but he lost his horse after taking the first battery. The squadron was then joined by Lt. Andrzej Niegolewski, who had previously been on reconnaissance with his soldiers. The charge was continued under Dziewanowski, and when he fell from his horse after taking the third battery he was replaced by Piotr Krasiński. The charge that continued to the last battery was led by Niegolewski, who miraculously survived a fierce attack by Spanish troops – he received nine wounds from bayonets and two carbine shots to the head.\n\nAccording to many memoirs of veterans of the battle, Kozietulski led his men in a charge with the official cry \"Vive l'Empereur\". However, popular legend has it that the true battle cry was the Polish \"Naprzód psiekrwie, Cesarz patrzy\" – \"Forward, you sons of dogs, the Emperor is watching\".\n\nWhen the fourth battery was taken Napoleon ordered his Chasseurs of the Guard and the 1st squadron of Poles led by Tomasz Łubieński to resume the attack and drive the Spaniards from the Pass. Łubieński tried to give himself the whole glory, minimizing the role of the third squadron (while Niegolewski tried to show that he had taken the cannons and Łubieński had therefore had it easy, as the Spanish were shooting at him \"with candies\").\n\nThe 13th bulletin of the Army of Spain mentioned the lead role of the Polish chevaux-légers. Only a cavalry charge was able to take all four batteries, even if French infantry was close enough to press their attack, and caused the en-masse retreat of Spanish Andalusian irregular militia and, in effect, the retreat of the whole army. Spanish artillerymen preferred to die rather than abandon their position – but no Polish account mentioned any fight with Spanish militia. Militiamen just left their position after seeing how seemingly easily the Poles took the artillery positions – however, in the smoke they could not see just how few Poles were on the top.\n\nSan Juan raced his army back to Madrid. Although the victory at Somosierra was more accurately the result of a combined infantry and cavalry attack, with the infantry bearing the heavier fighting, later accounts – Napoleon's included – placed all the emphasis on the Polish charge. San Juan was later killed by his own men. French patrols reached the outskirts of Madrid on the 1 December. The Junta made a half-hearted and futile attempt to defend the capital, and on the 4 December a devastating French artillery barrage brought the Spanish defence to grief. Spaniards surrendered their remaining 2,500 regulars; the 20,000 civilians under their banner dispersed; and the French entered Madrid for the second time that year. The Battle of Somosierra is commemorated on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Warsaw, with the inscription \"SOMOSIERRA 30 XI 1808\".\n\n\n"}

Previous visitors had named it after Portuguese explorer João da Nova who commanded that nation's third expedition to India during which he encountered Farquhar (in the year 1504). Administration of the atoll was a grey area for many years, with both Mauritius and Seychelles claiming the right to administer it. In 1881 the authorities in Seychelles suggested Farquhar, along with several other outer islands, be administered from Victoria in Seychelles rather than from Mauritius. There were objections as the owners were based in Mauritius but after considerable argument, the owners lost their case and administration was passed from Mauritius to Seychelles.\nFishing camps were established on north islands in 1850 \nIn 1960, the village on the northern tip of South Island was abandoned.\nFrom 1965 to the independence of the Seychelles in 1976, Farquhar was a part of the British Indian Ocean Territory.\nIn 2004 there were renovations in the village.\nIn 2014 Island Conservation Society opened a Conservation Centre on North Island. On 16 April 2016 Farquhar Atoll was hit by Cyclone Fantala, the strongest tropical cyclone ever recorded in the south-west Indian Ocean, which destroyed most of the buildings except for the cyclone shelter.

In addition, there is a small guesthouse that caters mainly for fly-fishing clients during October to April.\n\nThe islands of Farquhar (excluding North, South and the Manahas) have been designated as an Important Bird Area. Goëlettes is the most interesting for birds with a huge seasonal colony of about 300,000 pairs of sooty tern and around 10,000 pairs of brown noddy. In 2006, Island Conservation Society recorded a previously unknown colony of black-naped terns at Sable Island with 15 breeding pairs, the largest population on any one island in the region. Black-naped terns also breed on Goëlettes.\n\nFarquhar is also an important nesting site for turtles. Surveys conducted in the early 1980s when adult turtles were intensively hunted estimated 425 nesting green turtle females and 27 hawksbill turtles per annum.

He was reportedly short, had a lame foot, and a cataract in one eye as well. However, he still managed to rally the support of his people because he was smart and energetic. He also managed to remain on good terms with other countries. The historical chronicler Ibn Batuta says that he was of “noble character and great virtue”.\n\nThough surprisingly popular, al-Nasir did not keep control of his city throughout his life. Much of that has to do with him becoming sultan as a nine-year-old. Because the city was ripe with power mongers, his tutor, Kitbuqa sent him away to grow up and come home when he was better able to deal with the responsibility of ruling a country. Kitbuqa was killed shortly thereafter and was succeeded by a short succession of other rulers. Finally Lagin, an advisor loyal to the sultan took control and informed the young sultan he had nothing to fear and could return to Cairo. Nasir was usurped one additional time during his rule. Only after being reinstated a second time did Nasir begin working on his massive construction projects.\n\nAt the time, rulers of Cairo would support the city by sponsoring massive building projects which brought them prestige and created jobs. Al-Nasir’s claim to fame was building up the Citadel area that the Mamluk Empire ruled from. The Citadel resided aside from the more day-to-day people’s market place. Al-Nasir wiped out the library and audience halls of his predecessor and sponsored the building of a grand palace, aqueduct, and mosque for his own personal use in their place.\n\nAround 1318, when the mosque was completed, the Sultan al-Nasir used it for his daily prayer. A side room enclosed by intricate iron work served as a private place of thought for the busy sultan. The call to prayer was broadcast to the North where the palace troops would be able to hear it. Perhaps unique in all of history, the funds to build this mosque exceeded its actual costs. These funds were used to buy more land and shops to support the mosque making it one of the wealthiest institutions in the city. \n\nBoth the financial stability and the Sultan’s own prestige made the Citadel Mosque a desirable place to work. To decide who would get the job, the Sultan called before him all the muezzins, preachers, and readers in the city to come before him and preach. Thus, the king got to pick the best and brightest religious leaders to serve in his mosque.\n\nWhen the British arrived in Cairo, the Mosque on the Citadel was well past its days of honor where it was the sultan’s choice place to meditate. When Ottomans took over Cairo they ransacked the mosque and stripped it of much of its marble paneling. Areas between the entrances grand columns were plastered to form the walls of prison cells and storage rooms. \n\nBeing an amateur archeologist, C.M. Watson of the British army asked his commanding officer, Captain William Freeman for permission to start repairs on the mosque. Permission was granted and Watson used prisoners to tear out the plaster walls. He succeeded in clearing out the southern and eastern walls, but was afraid the northern and western walls were needed to support the roof.\n\nThe Mosque of the Citadel is similar to how it looked in the 1300 though many repairs have been made. It is open to the public though infrequently visited by tourists. The parts of the building relying on plastered walls have been reinforced. There have also been attempts to restore the light-blue color of the ceiling.\n\nThe hypostyle mosque is built as a free-standing 63 x 57 m rectangle around an inner court with a sanctuary on the qibla side and galleries surrounding the other three sides. The main entrance protrudes from the face of the western wall. There are two other entrances, on the northeastern side and on the southern side. Unlike most other mosques of Cairo, its outer walls are not paneled and have no decoration except a crenellation composed of rectangles with rounded tops. This results in a rather austere appearance which is probably accounted for by the military nature of its setting. Crenellation on the inner walls around the courtyard is of the stepped type. \n\nThere are two minarets, both built entirely of stone, one at the northeast corner and one at the northwest portal right above the main entrance; the former is the higher of the two. The top of the latter is unique in Cairo in that it has a garlic-shaped bulb. The upper structure is covered with green, white and blue glazed mosaics (faience). This style has probably been brought by a craftsman from Tabriz who is known to have come to Cairo during the reign of al-Nasir Muhammad. Contrary to all other Mamluk mosques, the base of both minarets is below the level of the roof of the mosque. This indicates that the minarets were already standing when the walls were made higher in 1335. The heightening of the walls also resulted in a row of arched windows that give the building a special character.\n\nIn the 1335 renovation, the mosque was heightened, its roof rebuilt and a dome of plastered wood covered with green tiles was added over the \"maqsura\" (prayer niche). For centuries the Qala'un Mosque was considered the most glamorous mosque in Cairo until the dome over the prayer niche collapsed in the sixteenth century and the high marble dado was carried off to Constantinople by the Ottoman conqueror Sultan Selim I. The present dome is modern, carried by granite columns taken from ancient Egyptian temples.\n\nThe Mosque of al-Nasir is also called The Mosque of the Citadel. It rests in the South Eastern part of Cairo. Though often overshadowed by mosques more central to the city, the Mosque of the Citadel (also known as the Mosque of al-Nasir) is historically significant in its own right. It was built by Sultan Nasir Mohammed ibn Kalaoun in the year 1318 (718 by the Islamic calendar). The mosque was frequently used by its sponsor as well as his military. When the Ottomans took over the city they looted it and it fell into disrepair. Its restoration began when the British took over Cairo at the end of the 18th century.\nThe mosque in its entirety is a 206 by 186 square. The mosque’s central court where praying takes place is 117 ft 6in by 76 ft 6in. The ancient scholar al-Zahiri is quoted as saying “The Great Mosque of the Citadel is equally as wondrous; I am assured it can hold 5,000 faithful”. \n\nThe main entrance to the mosque is a door at its north side. The south door would have been the Sultan’s private entrance, but at the time the British were taking over the eastern and southern entrance were packed with trash.\n\nA message over the doors in flowing Arabic script reads:\n“In the name of God the Merciful, the Gracious, He who ordered the building of this mosque, the Blessed, the Happy, for the sake of God, whose name be exalted, is our Lord and Master, the Sultan and King, the conquer of the world and faith, Nasir Mohamed, son of our Lord the Sultan Kalaoun es Saleh, in the months and year of Hegira of the Prophet seven hundred and eighteen”.\n\nOther doors contain similar messages. The script around the building holds more religious sentiments. Lining the top of the building on the inside were glass mosaics. Nasir was the last Sultan of Cairo to use this sort of decoration extensively.\n\nThe walls of the mosque were constructed using limestone pillaged by the pyramids. The ten red granite pillars in the mosque were also stolen goods.\nThe most striking and unique feature of this mosque are its two minarets. The first is placed at the north-east corner of the Mosque where it could call troops to prayer. The other is also near the main entrance. What makes these minarets unique is their bulbous sections with finely carved decoration. Other minarets from the time are not nearly as extensively decorated. Some scholars believe that Sultan al-Nasir was friendly with the Mongols at this time and may have hired a master mason from Tabriz to construct the minarets of his mosque.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2045009", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2045009", "title": "Intentional tort", "text": "Intentional tort\n\nAn intentional tort is a category of torts that describes a civil wrong resulting from an intentional act on the part of the tortfeasor (alleged wrongdoer). The term negligence, on the other hand, pertains to a tort that simply results from the failure of the tortfeasor to take sufficient care in fulfilling a duty owed, while strict liability torts refers to situations where a party is liable for injuries no matter what precautions were taken.\n\nAs a matter of public policy, damages available for intentional torts tend to be broader and more generous than for negligent torts. To preserve individual well-being and overall social welfare, society generally wishes to deter its members from intentionally attacking each other. For example, in the United States, it is easier to get punitive damages (damages above and beyond compensatory damages) if one can prove that the tort was intentional. Similarly, in most Australian jurisdictions, intentional torts are not included in civil liability legislation, thus excluding the threshold of injury and damages payouts from various legislated limitations and caps. But it is harder to prove intentional torts because as with many felony crimes, one must prove subjective elements involving the content of the defendant's mind, and defendants do not always express their harmful intent out loud or in writing.\n\nThe key difference between intentional torts and negligent torts is that the plaintiff must prove the \"additional\" element that the defendant acted with the specific intent to perform (\"i.e.,\" acted with a mental state of intentionally performing) the act that was the proximate cause of the plaintiff's injuries (so-called malice). \"The concept of 'intention' in the intentional torts does not require that defendants know that their acts will result in harm to the plaintiffs. Defendants must know only that their acts will result in certain consequences.\" Under doctrines such as transferred intent, the plaintiff need not always prove that the defendant acted with the intent to bring about the specific injury that actually occurred.\n\nNot every intentional action qualifies as an intentional tort. Suppose an investor holding more than half of a corporation's stock votes on changes the other stockholders find detrimental. If the other stockholders suffer damages as a result, this is not a tort (in the majority of jurisdictions), as the powerful investor had a right to vote whichever way he liked. Thus, the other stockholders cannot sue the aforementioned investor for damages. (California is the notable exception to this rule, at least as to closely held corporations.) If, however, John Doe physically attacks a passerby in the street, John is liable for these costs, as he is guilty of the tort of battery. Actual damages are not required for a prima facie case of battery.\n\nTo successfully sue a defendant liable for an intentional tort, the plaintiff must prove that the defendant performed the action leading to the damages the plaintiff alleges, and that the defendant acted with purpose, or that he had knowledge with substantial certainty that an act would result in a tortious result. A famous case in the 1800s involved a hemophiliac child (Vosburg) who was kicked by another child (Putney) at school, resulting in severe disability of the leg. Although the kicker could not have reasonably foreseen that the kick would cause severe disability, he certainly could have foreseen that it would cause discomfort, and was found liable.\n\nFor example, a plaintiff attempting to prove that a defendant committed the intentional tort of battery must fulfill several elements: intent, an act, cause, and harmful or offensive contact.\n\nHere, \"intent\" means either purpose or \"knowledge with substantial certainty,\" as elucidated in Garratt v. Dailey. \"Cause\" in an intentional tort need only be \"actual cause;\" that is, but for the defendant's action the tortious result would not have occurred. The plaintiff need not allege or prove proximate cause, which would indicate that the result of the defendant's actions was reasonably foreseeable.\n\nCommon law intentional torts include the following:\n\nAn assault is the immediate intentional creation of apprehension of another without consent or privilege. A battery is the intentional harmful or offensive touching of another without consent or privilege. A conversion is the intentional exercise of dominion and control of another's property without their consent or privilege. False imprisonment is the intent to confine or bound someone without a means of egress. Trespass to land is the intentional interference with the land of another without consent or privilege. Trespass to chattel is the intentional interference with the personal property of another without consent or privilege.\n\nProperty torts are a specific class of intentional torts that arise when the right invaded is a property right rather than a personal right.(land is taken from someone, and they didn't know it was theirs because it was passed down.) These include trespass to land (entering someone's land without permission), trespass to chattels (handling items owned by another without permission), and conversion (taking possession of someone else's property with the intent not to return it). \nSome older, and largely obsolete, property law concepts include detinue, replevin, and trover.\n\nDignitary torts are the class of intentional tort, including slander and libel, that arise when the right invaded involves the reputation or privacy of the individual claiming industry.\n\nGenerally, intentional torts are uninsurable as a matter of public policy, meaning that tortfeasors guilty of such torts must pay damages out of their own pocket (if they have any money worth going after). Otherwise, professional criminals could obtain liability insurance to insure against the risk of being caught and prosecuted by the state, or sued in civil actions by their victims.\n\nOf course, this rule has not stopped criminals from attempting to litigate whether particular intentional torts are not really intentional (meaning that their liability insurers would have a duty to defend and indemnify them). The Supreme Court of California forcefully shot down one such attempt: \"[California Insurance Code] Section 533 precludes coverage in this case because child molestation is \"always\" intentional, it is \"always\" wrongful, and it is \"always\" harmful.\"\n"}
{"id": "2045011", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2045011", "title": "Planet of the Apes (TV series)", "text": "Planet of the Apes (TV series)\n\nPlanet of the Apes is a 1974 American science fiction television series that was broadcast by CBS. The series features Ron Harper, James Naughton, Roddy McDowall, Mark Lenard, and Booth Colman. It is based on the 1968 movie \"Planet of the Apes\" and its sequels, which were based on the 1963 novel \"Planet of the Apes\" by Pierre Boulle.\n\nThe series begins with the June 14, 3085 crash of an Earth spaceship that encountered a time warp while approaching Alpha Centauri on August 19, 1980. The spaceship is manned by three astronauts, one of whom has died in the crash. The other two astronauts, Colonel Alan Virdon and Major Peter J. Burke, are unconscious but are rescued by a human who carries them to an old bomb shelter. After the human opens a book containing historical text and pictures of Earth circa 2500, the two astronauts are convinced that they are indeed on a future Earth.\n\nThe crash is also witnessed by a young chimpanzee who tells his father, a village official who alerts the authorities. Ape councilor Zaius (an analog of the character from the original movie), notes that another such incident occurred ten years earlier. He orders the chief gorilla, Security Chief Urko, to find the humans and bring them back alive. Zaius wants to find out as much as he can about the humans before they are eventually killed. Zaius doesn't trust Urko to follow his orders and bring back any surviving humans, so he sends along his newly hired chimpanzee assistant, Galen.\n\nBoth Virdon and Burke go back to their ship to check the ship's chronometer. They are more than 1000 years in the future from when they left Earth. Virdon insists on retrieving the ship's flight log in the hopes that they will be able to analyze it and be able to return to their own time period, but while they are at the ship, they are captured, and the old man is subsequently killed by a group of apes.\n\nGalen finds the human book that the old man had been carrying. He reads parts of the book and begins to doubt the history that he has been told: apes have always been dominant, and humans have always been inferior and subservient. When Galen finds out that Urko has arranged for the two astronauts to escape and be killed in the attempt, he stops the shooter and helps the humans escape. During the escape, a guard is killed, and Galen is found standing over him with a gun in his hand.\n\nGalen discusses the book that he found with Zaius, who then accuses him of heresy. Galen is sentenced to death for his crime. Then Virdon and Burke find out about his sentence and rescue Galen. They are all then declared enemies of the state and become fugitives. The three fugitives thereafter wander around the territory that used to be the western United States having various encounters with apes, humans, and old human civilization ruins.\n\n\nDiscussions for a \"Planet of the Apes\" television series were made by producer Arthur P. Jacobs as early as 1971. Because of the success of the movies, the idea of a television series was delayed until after the completion of \"Battle for the Planet of the Apes\" during the first half of 1973. However, soon after the premiere of \"Battle\", Jacobs died, and his production company APJAC Productions sold all \"Planet of the Apes\" rights and privileges to 20th Century Fox. Subsequently, television rights for the first three \"Planet of the Apes\" movies were sold to CBS and broadcast successfully during September 1973. Based largely on high viewership of \"movie-of-the-week\" television broadcasts of the first few movies, CBS began to disfavor other contenders for a new science-fiction series, including Gene Roddenberry's \"Genesis II\" (1973) and favor proposals for a \"Planet of the Apes\" television series. Fox and CBS then continued Jacob's plans of a series the next year.\n\nCBS ordered 14 episodes of \"Planet of the Apes\" to be produced. The series was filmed for the most part on location at what is now Malibu Creek State Park, with a budget of about $250,000 for each episode. Originally scheduled to be broadcast during CBS's Tuesday night family hour, the first regular episode of the series was broadcast on Friday, September 13, 1974 from 8:00-9:00 PM. The remainder of the series was broadcast during this same time slot until December 27, 1974, when its 14th and final broadcast was shown as a result of a premature cancellation of the series due to poor ratings.\n\nThe series' main theme music was composed by Lalo Schifrin; Schifrin also scored three episodes of the series - \"Escape From Tomorrow,\" \"The Gladiators\" and \"The Good Seeds\" (the latter, though not the premiere episode, was the first to be scored). Earle Hagen composed the scores for \"The Legacy\" and \"Tomorrow's Tide,\" while Richard LaSalle wrote an original score for \"The Trap.\" In addition, three episodes received partial scores - Hagen composed one for \"The Surgeon,\" LaSalle composed \"The Deception,\" and music supervisor Lionel Newman composed his only music for the series with \"The Interrogation\" (those last three, like the other episodes, were otherwise tracked with the music composed previously).\n\nIn 2005, Intrada released an album featuring Lalo Schifrin's beginning and ending music along with all three of Schifrin's scores and Earle Hagen's \"The Legacy.\" The album also includes the logo music for Twentieth Century-Fox Television by Alfred Newman.\n\nIn 2015, La-La Land Records issued a remastered and expanded limited edition album, featuring all six original scores plus the Newman material.\n\nDisc 1: Music by Lalo Schifrin\n\nDisc 2: Theme by Lalo Schifrin, Music by Richard LaSalle, Earle Hagen and Lionel Newman\n\n\nThe scripts for \"Episode One\", \"Episode Two\", \"Hostage\" and \"A Fallen God\" are available online at Hunter's Planet of the Apes Archive. Details regarding \"The Trek,\" \"Freedom Road,\" \"The Mine,\" and \"The Trial\" were provided in issue 12 of Simian Scrolls (a Planet of the Apes-based magazine), reprinted from the television series writer's bible.\n\nThe series was broadcast in the U.S. from September 13 to December 20, 1974. The show was canceled after half a season because of poor ratings due at least partly to direct competition by NBC's \"Sanford and Son\" and \"Chico and the Man\". Only thirteen of its fourteen episodes were broadcast; all 14 episodes were later included in the DVD box set. It was later shown in reruns on the Sci Fi Channel.\n\nThe series was broadcast in Britain by 13 of the 14 ITV companies from 13 October 1974 each Sunday, until 18 January 1975. Scottish Television (STV) never broadcast it during 1974/75, opting to broadcast \"Sale of the Century\" instead. The show was repeated in many regions from September 1975 until 1978, but was still not broadcast by STV. The series then received its first UK-wide transmissions on Channel 4 in 1994, and later the Sci Fi Channel. The television movie compilations have also been screened on Sky Movies, True Movies, True Entertainment (which also broadcast the show in original form) and Horror Channel.\n\nDuring 2019, MeTV began broadcasting the series as part of its late Saturday Night \"Red Eye Sci-Fi\" block.\n\nIn 1980, several episodes of the series were edited into five made-for-television movies.\n\n\nWhen the \"Planet of the Apes\" telefilms began syndication, ABC's owned and operated stations, who bought them for their afternoon movie programs (with titles such as \"\"), asked Roddy McDowall to re-create his role of Galen in a series of new beginnings and endings specifically for these stations, billed as \"The New Planet of the Apes\". The introductions created originally by 20th Century Fox to begin each film were replaced by a now-aged Galen (McDowall) examining the events of the telefilms. The beginnings and endings revealed Virdon and Burke's final fates: \"They found their computer in another city and disappeared into space as suddenly as they’d arrived\". According to \"TV Zone Special #17\" (1995 issue) McDowall filmed these \"two years after the demise of the first run episodes of the Planet of the Apes television series\", which would be December 1976. The ABC openings and closings of these telefilms were neither broadcast by other stations nor included on any home media release.\n\nMost of the books and comics based on \"Planet of the Apes\" are based on the movies, not the television series. However, there are some titles that do involve the television show characters:\n\nNovelizations: Four novelizations of episodes, written by George Alec Effinger, were published by Award Books. Their titles are:\n\nBritish Annuals: Brown-Watson Books published three hardcover annuals featuring original stories about Virdon, Burke and Galen. These stories are a combination of comic strips and short fiction.\n\nAudio Adventures—Power Records produced four audio-only adventures based on the TV show. Their titles were:\n\nArgentine Comics: Seven Spanish-language comics were published in Argentina, written by Jorge Claudio Morhain and Richard Barreiro and illustrated by Sergio Mulko and T. Toledo. Released only in Argentina, they have never been published officially in English. However, PDFs of the comics, translated to English by fans, are available at Kassidy Rae's site (see link below).\n\nFilmstrip Story: Chad Valley, a U.K. toy company, produced 32 short film-based comic strips containing an original TV-series-era story, presented as the Chad Valley Picture Show Planet of the Apes Sliderama Projector (very similar to the many Give-a-Show projector sets of the 1970s). These strips are extremely rare and difficult to find.\n\n"}
{"id": "2045015", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2045015", "title": "Altes Land", "text": "Altes Land\n\nAltes Land is an area of reclaimed marshland straddling parts of Lower Saxony and Hamburg. The region is situated downstream from Hamburg on the southwestern riverside of the Elbe around the towns of Stade, Buxtehude, Jork and the \"Samtgemeinde\" of Lühe. In Hamburg it includes the quarters of Neuenfelde, Cranz, Francop and Finkenwerder. Altes Land is one of the Elbe Marshes. \n\nThe region – the biggest contiguous fruit-producing region in North Europe – extends over . 76.8% of the trees are apples, 12.7% are cherries. The areas closest to the Elbe are those with the highest population. They include the most fertile marshlands; towards the geest the area connects to fens.\n\nThe fertile land led to the development of a culture dominated by farming. The villages are known as \"Marschhufendörfer\", a special kind of village where the farmyards are set along a street with the land directly behind them. A characteristic feature is the richly decorated half-timbered farmhouses with their elaborate gateways.\n\nThe region's official standard German name is \"Altes Land\", which means \"old country\". However, \"Altes Land\" is a mistranslation of the original Low Saxon \"Olland\", which originally had nothing to do with \"old\": It stems from the term \"Holland -\" itself derived from \"Holtland\" meaning \"\"Wooded Land\"\". This is a reference to the area's original reclamation and colonisation by Dutch settlers. The first colonisation agreement goes back to 1113 and was drawn up during the time of Archbishop Friedrich I of Bremen. One of the municipalities of the \"Altes Land\" is Hollern, a name which comes from \"Holländer\" (German for the Dutch). However, the mistranslation of \"Olland\" as \"Altes Land\" has now come full circle, since most Low Saxon speakers today refer to the region as \"dat Ole Land\" (literally \"the old land\"). There also is an eponymous periodical.\n\nThe \"Altes Land\" is divided into three \"miles\" (German \"Meilen\"); the first, second and third miles. These miles are zones along the banks of the Lower Elbe river. The first mile, between the rivers Schwinge and Lühe, was first dyked and then settled in around 1140. The second mile is the area east of the first between the Lühe and the Este, an area which was dyked at the end of the 12th century. The third mile, called \"Terra Nova\" (new land), between the Este and the Elbe, was only dyked at the end of the 15th century when the area was especially hard-hit by storm tides.\n\nAs of 2008 tourism plays a major role in the local economy, particularly during the cherry blossom and apple blossom seasons. However, parts of the orchard plantations are slowly being displaced by residential developments. Many of these new homes are then sold or rented to commuters who work in nearby Hamburg.\n\n"}
{"id": "2045017", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2045017", "title": "Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came", "text": "Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came\n\n\"Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came\" is a poem by English author Robert Browning, written on January 2nd, 1852 and first published in 1855 in the collection titled \"Men and Women\".\n\nThe title, \"Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came\", which forms the last words of the poem, is a line from William Shakespeare's play \"King Lear\" (\"ca.\" 1607). In the play, Gloucester's son, Edgar, lends credence to his disguise as Tom o' Bedlam by talking nonsense, of which this is a part:\n\nBrowning claimed that the poem came to him in a dream.\n\nBrowning explores Roland's journey to the Dark Tower in 34 six line stanzas with the rhyme form A-B-B-A-A-B and iambic pentameter. It is filled with images from nightmare but the setting is given unusual reality by much fuller descriptions of the landscape than was normal for Browning at any other time in his career. In general, however, the work is one of Browning's most complex. This is, in part, because the hero's story is glimpsed slowly around the edges; it is subsidiary to the creation of an impression of the hero's mental state.\n\nThe name Roland, references to his slughorn (a pseudo-medieval instrument which only ever existed in the mind of Thomas Chatterton and Browning himself), general medieval setting, and the title \"childe\" (a medieval term not for a child but for an untested knight) suggest that the protagonist is the paladin of \"The Song of Roland\", the 11th century anonymous French \"chanson de geste\", among other works.\n\nThe poem opens with Roland's speculations about the truthfulness of the man who gives him directions to the Dark Tower. Browning does not retell the \"Song of Roland\"; his starting point is Shakespeare. The gloomy, cynical Roland seeks the tower and undergoes various hardships on the way, although most of the obstacles arise from his own imagination. Upon reaching the Tower, Roland finds all those who failed to reach the tower, and under it he finally shouts \"Childe Roland to the dark tower came\". What Roland finds inside the tower is not revealed.\n\nWilliam Lyon Phelps proposes three different interpretations of the poem: In the first two, the Tower is a symbol of a knightly quest. Success only comes through failure or the end is the realisation of futility. In his third interpretation, the Tower is simply damnation.\n\nFor Margaret Atwood, Childe Roland is Browning himself, his quest is to write this poem, and the Dark Tower contains that which Roland/Browning fears most: Roland/Browning \"\"in his poem-writing aspect\"\".\n\n\"Childe Roland\" has served as inspiration to a number of popular works of fiction, including:\n\n"}

The finals took place in Montreal on September 11 and Hamilton, on September 13 and September 15, and were won by Team Canada.\n\nThe final best-of-three series of this tournament between Canada and the Soviet Union is considered by many to be the best exhibition of hockey in history. At the time, Soviet players were not allowed to pursue playing careers in North America, and so it was only through tournaments like this one where hockey fans could see them exhibit their skills head-to-head against the best of the National Hockey League (NHL). The United States and Soviet Union teams complained about the neutrality of the officiating in the tournament. Soviet coach Viktor Tikhonov said he felt the main reason his team lost was because of \"bias and errors in refereeing.\" \nThe tournament also was the only time that two of the most dominant NHL players of all time, Wayne Gretzky and Mario Lemieux, played on the same forward unit, combining with each other on 29% of Team Canada's goals.

Canada scored twice more, each time Mario Lemieux assisted by Wayne Gretzky, but the Soviets replied each time. The tying goal was an end-to-end rush by Valeri Kamensky with 1:04 remaining in regulation time. After a scoreless period of overtime, which featured tremendous goaltending from Grant Fuhr, Gretzky and Lemieux hooked up for the third time of the evening at 10:07 of the second overtime. It was the fifth assist for Gretzky on the night and completed a hat trick for Lemieux.\n\nThe Canadians got off to a slow start in the decisive third game. The Soviets scored three times in the first eight minutes to take a 3–0 lead. Canada's grinders took over after that (particularly Rick Tocchet, Brent Sutter and Dale Hawerchuk), and pulled Canada into a 5–4 lead after two periods. The Soviets tied it back up in the third and the game looked like it would head to overtime again. But late in the third period, Canada coach Mike Keenan, who had been juggling lines all series, sent the trio of Gretzky, Lemieux and Hawerchuk out to play with a faceoff in Canada's end. After the faceoff, Gretzky, Lemieux and Larry Murphy rushed up the ice. Soviet defenseman Igor Stelnov was the only man back and he fell down to block a pass across but Gretzky fed the puck back to Lemieux, who fired a shot over the glove of goaltender Sergei Mylnikov with 1:26 remaining. The Gretzky to Lemieux play is one of the most memorable plays in Canadian sports history.\n\n\n\n\"All numbers in bold represent that was tournament high\"\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2045037", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2045037", "title": "Time Changer", "text": "Time Changer\n\nTime Changer is an independent science fiction Christian seriocomic film written and directed by Rich Christiano, released by Five & Two Pictures in 2002. The screenplay concerns Dr. Norris Anderson (Gavin MacLeod), who uses his late father's time machine to send his colleague, Bible professor Russell Carlisle (D. David Morin), from 1890 into the early 21st century. The film had a limited nationwide release.\n\nBible professor Russell Carlisle (D. David Morin) confronts and lectures a boy who has stolen marbles from his neighbors, calling his action unjust. The year is 1890 and Carlisle has written a new manuscript entitled \"The Changing Times\", which promotes good morals without discussing Christ. The book is on track to receive a unanimous endorsement from the board of the Grace Bible Seminary. That is, until colleague Dr. Norris Anderson (Gavin MacLeod) objects. Without unanimous endorsement, his book might not do so well. Carlisle and another professor seek a unanimity rule change, but the dean insists that Carlisle discuss the disagreement with Anderson privately.\n\nDr. Anderson fears that Carlisle's book could harm coming generations, arguing that teaching good moral values without mentioning Christ is wrong. Using a secret time machine, Anderson sends Carlisle over 100 years into the future, offering him a glimpse of where his beliefs will lead.\n\nArriving in the early 21st century, Carlisle is shocked to find that half of all marriages end in divorce (instead of 5% in 1890), teenagers talk openly about deceiving their parents, movies contain blasphemous language and people who go to church are so bored by the sermons that they need extra activities. He tries to convince a laundromat worker, Eddie Martinez (Paul Rodriguez), to go to church and read the Bible. Two churchgoing men grow suspicious of Carlisle, who acts as if he's seeing everything for the first time. They confront him as he is about to be transported back to the past. As the sky grows thunderous, Carlisle seems delirious as he talks about how the second coming of Christ is drawing near. Carlisle vanishes. The men look at where he vanished and one of the men says with dread, \"I think we just missed the Rapture.\"\n\nCarlisle rematerializes in 1890 and excitedly tells Anderson he will revise his book. He gives the thieving boy his own set of marbles and explains that it is Jesus Christ who demands honesty. Anderson tries to learn when the world will come to an end, by trying to send a Bible to the future. The machine won't operate with a target date of 2100, so he tries with progressively earlier decades 2090, 2080 and 2070, which fail. As the film ends, he makes at least two more failed attempts, aiming earlier and earlier, suggesting that either humanity cannot know when the End comes, or that the End will come before the mid-21st century.\n\n\n\"Time Changer\" was Rich Christiano's first feature-length film. In August 2001 Christiano Film Group announced the film's cast, and that shooting would begin on October 6, 2001 in Visalia, CA, for an August 2, 2002 release.\nIn February 2002, the website stated that the film was being edited in Los Angeles.\nIn March, the first rough cut was completed, work began on a second pass, and streaming video was made available.\nIn a press release, the theatrical release date was listed as October 4, 2002.\nEditing wrapped in June, while music score, sound design, and visual effects work continued, and two scene sneak previews were linked on the website. \nOn August 2, the trailer was released online. \nOn August 6 the press release changed to show a theatrical release date of October 11. \nOn October 4, 2002, the film was announced as \"ready to go\", with a theatrical poster available which showed the final release date of October 25, as did the simultaneous press release.\n\nThe film premiered in limited nationwide release on October 25, 2002. It was released on VHS and DVD in 2003; The DVD included a \"making of\" featurette, commentary tracks, deleted scenes, promos and the trailer. \"Time Changer\" was one of the first Christiano films offered through the Sky Angel Video On Demand service.\n\nA 140-page tie-in novel, \"Time Changer (A Novel)\", was released in 2001, co-authored by Christiano and Greg Mitchell.\n\nIn the \"Charlotte Observer\", Lawrence Toppman praised the acting work, but had questions about plot holes and how some of the film's premises would be accepted by Christian viewers. Toppman wrote, \"technically, the film can stand with most releases\", and gave it 2.5 stars out of four. \"Variety\" reviewer Scott Foundas described the film as \"goofy fantasy hokum\" with a message, one scene as \"subpar\", and some monologues as \"distinctly uncinematic\", but other scenes as \"surprisingly enjoyable.\" Foundas found the film \"hard to read\" – often having \"its tongue planted firmly in its cheek\", but at other times \"sweetly naive\". Joe Baltake of \"The Sacramento Bee\" gave 1.5 stars (of 4) to the \"whimsical if predictable\" film \"marred by a willful single-mindedness.\" He found the film's beginning \"interminable\", and overall, \"very strange\".\n\n, the film holds a 22% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes with 2 out of 9 critics giving it a positive review with an average rating of 3.9/10.\n\n\n"}

Written by All Saints member Shaznay Lewis along with co-writers Robert Jazayeri and Sean Mather and produced by Cameron McVey and Magnus Fiennes, it was released on 10 November 1997 as the second single from their debut album, \"All Saints\" (1997). The song later appeared on their compilations \"All Hits\" (2001), \"\" (2010) and their remix compilation \"The Remix Album\" (1998). Lyrically, the song talks about the girls' feelings about their first expressions after a sudden break-up, where the girls' query what they did wrong in the relationship.\n\n\"Never Ever\" is All Saints' highest charting single to date, peaking at the top of the charts in countries including Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, while it peaked in the top 10 in countries including Ireland, Sweden, Canada, the Netherlands, France, Switzerland, Norway, Austria and the United States. As of June 2019, it is the third best selling single by a girl group of all time in the United Kingdom, only behind \"Wannabe\" by the Spice Girls and \"Shout Out to My Ex\" by Little Mix.\n\nTwo music videos were shot for the single: the European and Australian version, and an American version, due to the mass success in those countries. The North American featured the group in a church, while the European/Australian version featured the group near a swimming pool and in their homes. At the 1998 Brit Awards, \"Never Ever\" won British Single of the Year and British Video of the Year.\n\nAfter the success of their debut single \"I Know Where It's At\", the group decided to record and produce their debut full-length studio album. \"Never Ever\" was released as the second single from their first album \"All Saints\" (1997). The song was written by All Saints member Shaznay Lewis along with co-writers Robert Jazayeri and S. Mather, and was produced by Cameron McVey and Magnus Fiennes. Lewis wrote the song after splitting up with a boyfriend, but the music conveyed the impression that all would be well. Soon after they signed their first major label deal with London Records, she discovered that the rest of the group - Melanie Blatt and the Canadian sisters Nicole and Natalie Appleton - had presented the label head with a tape of vocal recordings they had made without her. It was their version of Lewis's own song \"Never Ever\" that made him pay attention to the music. \"He asked who had written it, so then they were forced to come back and get me. Looking back on it, that was pretty low. I think that's why the whole time I knew that if I didn't write I'd be out on my ear\", Lewis commented.\n\nAll Saints flew to the United States, where the song was recorded and produced by Mather and Jazayeri. Due to control issues, London Records brought in Cameron McVey to do additional production on the track because of time/distance constraints and Cameron's relationship with Lewis. Lewis was in tears over the success of \"Never Ever\", since it was written about a personal broken relationship, and said, \"I never believed that so much good could come out of such a bad situation.\" All Saints recorded the vocals in Washington, D.C., except for the intro, which was recorded at Battery Studios in London and was kept from the original demo. This was because the mood could not be replicated and everyone agreed to keep the demo vocals.\n\nHowever, the song's producing and writing caused controversy. Robert Jazayeri, who wrote the song, issued a writ against All Saints, and they were granted 40% of the publishing rights to the track. After he was not satisfied, Jazayeri filed a lawsuit towards the group's record label London Records and All Saints' management, which was settled amicably by the parties.\n\nThe song is set in common time at a tempo of 67 beats per minute and uses the melody from the British folk song “Amazing Grace” as its main hook. The lyrics are about the girls' first expressions after a sad break-up, and the girls ask what they did wrong in the relationship.\n\nStephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic described the musical content as an \"extraordinary gospel-tinged\" song. Nick Butler from \"Sputnikmusic\" described the musical content as a \"power ballad\".\n\n\"Never Ever\" received positive reviews from music critics. Nick Butler from \"Sputnikmusic\" stated, \"'Never Ever' is a fantastic song; quite rightfully, it still gets a fair bit of airplay today, and I still enjoy it whenever it appears on one of those VH1 Power Ballad days or whatever.\" Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic named the song as a highlight on its album, and said it \"lead[s] the way\" for All Saints' career. He then reviewed the \"All Hits\" record and said the track was a \"basic hit\", but called it a standout. \"Billboard\" named the song number 47 on their list of 100 Greatest Girl Group Songs of All Time.\n\n\"Never Ever\" debuted at number three on the UK Singles Chart, before rising to number one for a sole week. The song remains the group's longest single on those charts and stayed in the top 10 for 15 weeks, but charted for 26 weeks. It has sold over 1.36 million copies in the UK as of September 2017. It is also the third best selling single by a girl group of all time in the UK, only behind \"Wannabe\" by the Spice Girls and \"Shout Out to My Ex\" by Little Mix.\n\nThe song debuted at number 30 on the Australian Singles Chart and rose to number one, staying there for seven consecutive weeks and stayed in the charts for 22 weeks. It was successful in the charts and was certified 2× Platinum by Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), with sales of 140,000. The song was successful in New Zealand as well, debuting at number one and staying there for five consecutive weeks. It was the group's only number one single in that country. It stayed in the charts for 13 weeks in total.\nThe song was very successful in European markets. It debuted at number 10 in the Swedish Singles Chart, peaked at three for one week and stayed in the charts for 20 weeks. It was certified gold in that country. It debuted at number 27 on the French Singles Chart, and peaked at number four for one week. It stayed in the charts for 21 weeks. The song peaked at number four in the Netherlands for three consecutive weeks, and lasted 24 weeks in the chart. The song debuted at number 29 on the Austrian Singles Chart, and peaked at number seven for two consecutive weeks. It lasted for 19 weeks in the charts. The song debuted at number 15 in Norway, and peaked at number six, staying in the charts for 12 weeks. It was not as successful on the Finnish Singles Chart, peaking at number 12 and staying in the charts for two weeks.\n\n\"Never Ever\" was successful in North America as well. The song debuted at number 13 on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100, and peaked at number four on the charts, becoming the group's first top 10 and their highest peaking single on those charts. The song peaked at number four on the Canadian Singles Chart.\n\nWhen this song was first released in Europe, it featured the girls first in a swimming pool and then in a house. The video was shot by fashion photographer Sean Ellis.\n\nFor the United States, the video was re-shot and re-edited in a church. When \"All Saints – The Video\" was released, it was decided to release both versions on the video, because the European audience hadn't seen both. In Canada, MuchMusic played both versions.\n\nThe song was featured on the \"Guinness World Records\" for Top British Singles. A total of 1,263,658 copies of the single were sold in the UK, making it All Saints' biggest hit; 770,000 copies were sold before it reached number one; this is more than any single ever before in the UK chart history. At the 1998 Brit Awards, All Saints won two Brit Awards for this single: Best British Single and Best British Video, beating strong competition from the likes of \"Bitter Sweet Symphony\" by The Verve, \"Song 2\" by Blur, \"Paranoid Android\" by Radiohead and \"Something About the Way/Candle in the Wind 1997\" by Elton John.\n\nThe melody of the song is based upon an overlay of the hymn tune \"New Britain\", the most common setting for \"Amazing Grace\", which according to Ger Tillekens is the reason it became so successful. Although the lyrics and music are very different, \"Never Ever\" is based on a familiar and popular song.\n\n\n"}

As a comedian and comic actor, he is known for his use of surreal humour and black comedy. During the 2000s he was part of The Mighty Boosh comedy troupe alongside comedy partner Noel Fielding.\n\nBorn in Leeds, Barratt was educated at the University of Reading. With Fielding, he established the Mighty Boosh. Together, they produced a 2001 radio series, \"The Boosh\", for BBC Radio London. This was followed by a television series, \"The Mighty Boosh\", comprising three series for BBC 3 from 2004 to 2007. The show generated a cult fan following and won a variety of awards.\n\nAlongside Fielding, he has starred in \"Unnatural Acts\", \"Nathan Barley\" and \"Garth Marenghi's Darkplace\". Barrett also co-wrote and starred in the 2017 film \"Mindhorn\". He starred in the critically acclaimed Channel 4 black-humour sitcom \"Flowers.\"\n\nBarratt was born Julian Barratt Pettifer on 4 May 1968 in Leeds. He attended the University of Reading.\n\nBarratt adopted his middle name as his surname to distinguish himself from reporter Julian Pettifer. He stars as the character Howard Moon opposite Noel Fielding's Vince Noir in the comedy series \"The Mighty Boosh\". Howard labels himself a \"jazz maverick\" and claims to be a multitalented intellectual, calling himself a \"man of action\", but he is actually unsuccessful in his literary and romantic ventures. He is unpopular with many of the characters, including Mrs. Gideon (who always forgets his name), Bob Fossil (who often uses Howard as a puppet for his bizarre schemes), and Bollo (who often says his name wrongly or ignores him completely). Barratt composes all of the music for the series, which includes a variety of genres such as rap, heavy metal, and psychedelic rock.\n\nBarratt has had parts in other dramas, often alongside his \"Mighty Boosh\" partner Noel Fielding. He starred as Dan Ashcroft, a frustrated magazine writer, in the Channel 4 media satire \"Nathan Barley\", and appeared in the surrealistic black comedy series \"Asylum\" alongside Simon Pegg and Jessica Stevenson (who wrote and starred in \"Spaced\"). The character of Brian Topp in \"Spaced\" was written for Barratt, but eventually went to Mark Heap. Barratt played Jackson, a musician, in \"How Not to Live Your Life\". He starred in the \"Freelance Scientist\" commercial for Metz alcopop. He appeared as The Padre in the spoof horror series \"Garth Marenghi's Darkplace\".

Before this, Barratt was one half of an experimental comedy duo called \"The Pod\" with friend Tim Hope, in which they billed themselves as a \"Cyberdance Collective\". During this time he also appeared in the 2001 film \"Lucky Break\".\n\nBarratt made his directing début for Warp Films with theatre director Dan Jemmett. \"Curtains\" is set in a Norfolk seaside town. It is a dark comedy about a Punch and Judy man. In 2012, Barratt directed his first music video, for the song \"All of Me\" by Tanlines. He can be heard as the voiceover on many adverts, such as More Th>n Car, House and Pet insurance, and the Directgov advert.

After receiving the nickname \"Fazola\", he used it as his last name. Influenced in early life by Leon Roppolo, Fazola was playing professionally by age 15. In New Orleans he worked with Sharkey Bonano, Candy Candido, Armand Hug, and Louis Prima. He joined the Ben Pollack band when it came through town and performed with it in Chicago and New York City. After brief time with Glenn Miller and Gus Arnheim, Fazola became a member of the Bob Crosby band in 1938. He achieved some fame with this band, ranking as top clarinetist in the \"DownBeat\" magazine polls of 1940 and 1941. After leaving Crosby, he worked in bands in Chicago, New York, and New Orleans, including time with George Brunies at the Famous Door, before settling in New Orleans in 1943. Although musicians told him he could find greater fame and fortune in New York, he told them he felt more comfortable in his hometown with its wonderful food, which he ate in large quantities. According to Pete Fountain, Fazola drank heavily, which contributed to his weight and his early death. He died of a heart attack at the age of 36 in 1949.\n\nFazola influenced Fountain, whose style resembled Fazola's and who substituted for Fazola at the Opera House the night of his death. Fountain owned one of Fazola's clarinets, but he said the odor of garlic from it was so strong that it was nearly impossible to play. The clarinet was built on the Albert System in which the fingers stretch more than on the Boehm system that Fountain used. The \"woody\" or \"fat\" sound of Fountain derived in part from a crystal mouthpiece similar to what Fazola used.\n"}

Kaiser\" class is an American class of eighteen fleet replenishment oilers which began construction in August 1984. The class comprises fifteen oilers which are operated by Military Sealift Command to provide underway replenishment of fuel to United States Navy combat ships and jet fuel for aircraft aboard aircraft carriers at sea. One ship, operated by the United States from 1987 to 1996, was sold to Chile in 2009 and commissioned into the Chilean Navy in 2010; and two ships were scrapped in 2011 while still incomplete.\n\nTwelve of the \"Kaiser\"s are not double-hulled like most modern tankers; the class will be replaced under the TAO(X) project which will build 20 double-hulled ships, starting with and .\n\nThere are stations on both sides of each ship for underway replenishment of fuel and stores. The ships in this class have a small capacity to carry and transfer fresh and frozen foods as well as other materials, and have two dry cargo transfer rigs.\n\n, , and differ from the other 15 ships in having double hulls to meet the requirements of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. Hull separation is at the sides and on the bottom; this resulted in a 12% reduction in cargo capacity.\n\nThe circumstances of the construction program were convoluted and it is worthwhile to spell them out here. The original contract, for T-AO 187, was awarded to Avondale Industries, (Avondale), on November 12, 1982: this contract included options for T-AOs 188, 189 and 190, which were exercised on January 20, 1983, (T-AO 188) and November 22, 1983, (T-AOs 189 and 190). A second-source contract, for T-AOs 191 and 192, was awarded to Pennsylvania Shipbuilding Company, (Penn Ship), on May 6, 1985. This contract included options for T-AOs 194 and 196, which were never exercised: after Penn Ship began to have cash flow problems, the Navy transferred these options from Penn Ship's contract to Avondale's contract and exercised them on June 16, 1988. Additional options on Avondale's contract were executed on June 28, 1985, for T-AO 193, on February 27, 1986, for T-AO 195; on February 12, 1987, for T-AO 197; on June 20, 1988, for T-AO 198; on October 6, 1988, for T-AOs 200, 202 and 204; and on March 24, 1989, for T-AOs 199, 201 and 203.\n\nThe Navy's contract with Penn Ship for T-AOs 191 and 192 was terminated before the ships were complete and a new contract was executed with Tampa Shipyards, Inc., of Tampa FL, a division of the American Ship Building Company. (Note that this company should not be confused with Tampa Shipbuilding Company, (TASCO), which was a totally different entity, at a different location, long gone by 1989.) Disputes over corrective construction and materials costs between the U.S. Navy and Tampa Shipyards resulted in termination of this contract in 1993, when T-AO 191 was said to be 95% complete and T-AO 192 84% complete. The Navy then determined that the ships were no longer needed as oilers, and undertook a study of the feasibility of converting them to ammunition ships. This study concluded that such a conversion was cost-prohibitive and the ships were placed in long-term storage in an incomplete condition. They were sold for recycling in 2011.\n\nThe class is named for its lead unit, , which in turn is named for the American industrialist and shipbuilder Henry J. Kaiser (1882–1967). The first nine ships were named for American shipbuilders, inventors, naval architects, and aeronautical engineers who played important roles in the history of the U.S. Navy. The tenth through eighteenth ships were named after American rivers, which is a more traditional naming convention for U.S. Navy oilers.\n\nIn U.S. Navy service, the ships serve in a non-commissioned status in the Military Sealift Command, with primarily civilian crews. After joining the fleet, the 16 completed ships all saw active service between 1986 and 1996, when became the first unit of the class to be laid up. Since then, some of the others have also spent periods out of service in reserve or in a limited operational status.\n\n\"Andrew J. Higgins\" never re-entered U.S. service after being laid up in 1996. She was sold to Chile in 2009 and was commissioned into the Chilean Navy in 2010 as \"Almirante Montt\".\n"}

With origins in France, the sport has spread through Europe, and was introduced to the UK by the British Horse Society (BHS) in 1998. The sport is now known as British TREC and is run by TREC GB. TREC competitions consist of three separate events (phases) - mounted orienteering, a demonstration of control of the horse's paces and an obstacle course - all completed over the course of one or two days, and points scored, with the highest scoring being declared the overall event winner.\n\nThe first phase consists of mounted orienteering where riders copy a route from a marked map onto their own map, and follow this route at a speed determined by the organisers. The length of the route varies according to the level of the competition, ranging from 10 km at beginner levels up to 45 km at championship levels. The complexity of the navigating and challenge of the terrain also increases at higher level competitions, demanding greater skill. There are checkpoints along the route, which are not marked on the map, these are designed to ensure that the route is ridden accurately and at the correct speed and that horses have sufficient rest along the route. There are also un-manned ticket points on the route where the rider must stamp their own record card before proceeding.\n\nA number of items of essential kit must be carried or worn:\n\nRiders start the POR with 240 points, and the aim is to complete the phase with as many points remaining as possible. Penalties can be deducted in a number of ways including:\n\nThe MA phase is designed to demonstrate that a rider has a high degree of control over the horse, first in canter and then in walk. The rider must canter the horse slowly along a marked corridor, which is 2-4 m wide and up to 150 m long, and then turn around and walk the horse back quickly. There are up to 60 points available on this stage, depending on how slowly the horse canters and how fast he walks. If the horse leaves the corridor or breaks into another pace, the score is zero.\n\nThe PTV is a series of obstacles, designed to test the obedience, confidence, courage and balance of the horse and the correctness of the rider's aids. The course consists of up to 16 obstacles, to be tackled in a certain order and within a set time. The obstacles may include jumps, ditches, water, steps and dismounted tasks.\n\nThere are up to 10 points available for each obstacle (totalling 160 available) these points are broken down into:\nPenalties (from -3 to -1 for carelessness, brutality or dangerous riding) can also be deducted from the score as appropriate.\n\nIf the time allowed is exceeded, time penalties are deducted:\n\n"}

Hood for short; in Japan) is a fictional character in Capcom's \"Darkstalkers\" series. Modeled after Little Red Riding Hood, she is the only non-magical playable character in the series, and has been positively received by critics for her design and characterization.\n\nBaby Bonnie Hood makes her debut in \"Darkstalkers 3\" as a monster bounty hunter who hails from Northern Europe. As a Darkhunter, she kills Darkstalkers for money, and employs modern weaponry such as an Uzi submachine gun (sometimes substituted by a MAC-10), land mines, knives, and apple-shaped grenades—an arsenal she carries inside her picnic basket that itself doubles as a rocket launcher—all in her missions of hunting down creatures that have encroached onto Earth from the otherworldly dimension of Makai. Though she fights evil as a Darkhunter like Donovan and Hsien-Ko, she is an evil psychopath motivated mainly by profit, and her own heart was dark enough that Jedah Dohma, the game's reality bending antagonist, considered her a Darkstalker and therefore transported her into Majigen, a magical realm he has created within Makai expressly for imprisoning souls he deemed valuable.\n\nB.B. Hood's character design and name are a blatant play on Little Red Riding Hood, with her violent personality serving as an ironic contrast to the innocent naïvete of her appearance and namesake. Character designer Akira Yasuda (Akiman) stated that while the other \"Darkstalkers\" characters were inspired by an archetype of either mythology, folklore or popular culture, B.B. Hood was instead inspired by the sinister qualities of the human race itself, thus serving as a personification of humanity's dark side. During development of \"Darkstalkers 3\", after B.B. Hood's design was finalized, the team could not figure out how the character should move in-game, so Akiman drew sketches of her moves and poses and pitched them to the graphic department. \n\nB.B. Hood is the only fully human playable character in the \"Darkstalkers\" series. She carries her picnic basket on her arm during gameplay and has a small dog named Harry that watches the action from the sidelines and reacts in fear whenever she takes damage or fires a gun. Two rifle-wielding huntsmen named John and Arthur briefly appear alongside her in a special power-up move titled \"Beautiful Hunting\" that inflicts extra damage on opponents, and her victory poses range from her singing into a microphone to a man called Mr. K. counting money into her hand.\n\nLike many of the \"Darkstalkers\" characters, B.B. Hood has appeared in numerous Capcom crossover titles. She is a hidden character along with Mega Man in the shooter \"Cannon Spike\" and is selectable in \"\" and \"\". The character additionally appears in \"Onimusha Soul\", in collectible-card style titles \"\" and \"\", as well as in the tactical role-playing game \"Project X Zone 2\" as an enemy unit.\n\nB.B. Hood makes unplayable cameos in the \"Underworld\" stage and in \"Darkstalkers\" boss character Pyron's ending in \"Capcom Fighting Evolution\", on Dhalsim's \"Toy Shop\" stage in \"Pocket Fighter\", in mobile game\" Street Fighter × All Capcom\", and on a wanted poster in \"Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3\". \"Dead Rising\" character Frank West can be dressed up as B.B. Hood in downloadable content for the 2013 survival-horror beat 'em up \"Dead Rising 3\".\n\nB.B. Hood is a featured character in the third and fourth chapters of the 1997 five-volume manga \"Vampire Savior: Tamashii no Mayoigo\" by Mayumi Azuma, in which she is called \"Baretta\" (the romanization of her Japanese name) and relentlessly pursues Gallon (Jon Talbain). She then cons her way into Majigen, as opposed to being invited per the game's storyline, by falsely claiming to be among Jedah's chosen souls in hopes of going after the Darkstalkers therein and securing a massive payday. B.B. Hood featured little in the 2004 \"Darkstalkers\" comic series by Udon Entertainment, making her largest appearance in a five-page sidestory titled \"The Silver Necklace\" in issue six, which additionally featured her on the alternate cover. \n\nCapcom released a B.B. Hood figure in a two-pack with Talbain as part of their \"Video Game Super Star\" series released in the West in 1999, while other figures and merchandise of the character were available only in Japan. Enormous character stands of B.B. Hood and Lilith promoted \"Darkstalkers 3\" at the Japanese arcade trade show AOU '97.\n\nSince her debut in \"Darkstalkers 3\", B.B. Hood has been well received. She was named the best arcade game character of 1997 by Japanese magazine \"Gamest\". Patrick Roesle of Hardcore Gaming 101 praised her originality, calling her the \"best idea for a fighting game character.\" \"Complex\" ranked her 22nd in their 2012 list of the fifty most dominant fighting game characters, B.B. Hood finished fourth behind series mainstays Morrigan, Felicia and Demitri in a fan-voted \"Darkstalkers\" favorite-character poll hosted by GameFAQs in 2002. \n\nIn 1998, \"Sega Saturn Magazine\" praised her as an original, cool character. Den of Geek deemed her \"the true star\" of \"Darkstalkers 3\" in a 2015 retrospective on the series. They praised her design and enjoyability to play as well as being \"the monster that is man\" in contrast with the literal monsters in the game. Michał R. Wiśniewski from Wirtualna Polska noted B.B. Hood as a visually unique player character in \"Darkstalkers\" fitting neither the series' typical horrific or sexy labels. The character of Cisqua from Mayumi Azuma's manga series \"Elemental Gelade\" was partially modeled after B.B. Hood. \"Long Gone Days\" designer Camila Gormaz praised B.B. Hood's idle animation when crouching as one of her favorites, where butterflies would fly around her and a flower would eventually sprout.\n\n"}

Since retiring as a player, Rıdvan coached several teams before becoming a color commentator, analyst and sportswriter.\n\nDilmen made his debut with Sümerspor in 1977. He transferred to Muğlaspor in exchange for 25 footballs in 1979 and then became a renowned player for Boluspor between 1980–1983. After playing for Sarıyer between 1983–1987, he signed for Fenerbahçe and fulfilled his dream.\n\nHe was the main actor of the 1988–89 Turkish League season, which Fenerbahçe won the title with 103 goals in 36 matches. In the 1988–1989 season, he scored 19 goals and made 41 assists. After getting injured in 1990 against Trabzonspor by the Serbian defender Miodrag Ješić, he never fully recovered. Rıdvan failed to fulfill expectations due to consistent injuries, which required sixteen operations. He retired in 1994 after painful years of injuries. He is one of the symbol players not only for Fenerbahçe but for Turkish football also. The reason that his name is not as well-known worldwide are that he seldom had the chance to prove himself on the big international occasions. The Turkish national side for which he played, mostly in the 80s, was a no-hoper and Fenerbahçe's status on the European club stage was scarcely different.\n\nDilmen made 24 appearances for the Turkey national football team from 1984 to 1992.\n\nDilmen worked as a manager for Vanspor in 1998–99 season. His club finished the season as champions of Turkish Second League. He then became Fenerbahçe football teams manager in 2000. However, his stay only lasted five weeks. He resigned as Fenerbahçe was eliminated from UEFA Cup at an early stage. Dilmen was also employed as a manager for Altay SK and Adanaspor and Karşıyaka SK. So far, he doesn't have a successful managing career as he was expected to deliver.\n\nRidvan Dilmen is a commentator at NTV Spor and a columnist at \"Sabah\"; at the same time he does bet guesswork at \"Fanatik\" newspaper. He is a narrator at Star TV for the important Champions League matches. Dilmen has a reputation of saying \"it'll be a goal\" a few moments before the ball hits the back of the net. He transferred to \"Sabah\" on 1 August 2010.\n"}

Her father was stationed with the Army Air Corps in Houston at the time of her birth. Both of her parents went on to be actors. She is the sister of William Gordon MacRae, Robert Bruce MacRae, and Heather MacRae.\n\nShe credited her parents with instilling a proper work ethic in her and for keeping her feet on the ground. She said, \"We lived in a modest home in the San Fernando Valley instead of the fashionable Beverly Hills, which the family could have afforded. Mom and Dad didn't want us to feel superior to the other kids. I had to earn the things I wanted, all the way from dolls to party gowns, by doing chores around the house and taking care of my younger sister and brothers. Lots of kids in my circle automatically got a car when they were 16. Not me. Dad said he would get me a car when I got straight A's two years in a row in school. I slaved away and finally made it. I got the car with the warning that if I didn't continue with straight A's, it would be taken away.\" \n\nMacRae made her breakthrough appearance as Sally Anne Morrison Douglas on the ABC (later CBS) Fred MacMurray/William Demarest sitcom, \"My Three Sons\". She played the love interest of \"Mike\" for three seasons (1963–1965). She asked to be written out of the show to further explore her career.\n\nIn 1966, MacRae signed a contract with CBS to play Billie Jo Bradley on the sitcom \"Petticoat Junction\", starring Bea Benaderet as her television mother and Edgar Buchanan as her television uncle. Her television sisters were Betty Jo, played by Linda Kaye Henning, and Bobbie Jo, played by Lori Saunders.\n\nMacRae was the sitcom's third actress to portray Billie Jo. Jeannine Riley played the part in the show's first two years (1963–1965) and Gunilla Hutton in the third year (1965–1966). Both of these actresses played the role as a typical boy-crazy dumb blonde. However, by MacRae's debut on the series, Billie Jo's persona was that of a strong independent woman who focused more on a singing career, a dream she later accomplishes. She remained with the sitcom until its cancellation in 1970.\n\nShe also took over the role of Animal from Valora Noland in \"Bikini Beach\" (1964), the third Beach Party film produced by American International Pictures. She had an uncredited appearance on the bus in the movie \"Ski Party\" (1965). She was a guest on NBC' \"The Spring Thing\" a musical television special hosted by Bobbie Gentry and Noel Harrison. Other guests included were Goldie Hawn, Irwin C. Watson, Rod McKuen, Shirley Bassey, and Harpers Bizarre. Her other film roles included appearances in \"Norwood\" (1970), \"My Friends Need Killing\" (1976), \"Grand Jury\" (1976), \"Sketches of a Strangler\" (1978), \"Earthbound\" (1981), and \"The Census Taker\" (1984).\n\nShe made guest appearances on such shows as \"The Donald O'Connor Show\" (1968 version); \"The Dean Martin Show\" (1971); \"The F.B.I.\"; \"The Mike Douglas Show\"; \"The Rockford Files\"; \"Fantasy Island\"; \"Webster\"; \"CHiPS\", \"Love, American Style\"; and \"Magnum, P.I.\".\n\nMacRae was also popular in the game-show genre, appearing in numerous shows including: \"Funny You Should Ask\"; \"Match Game\" (60's 70's and 90's versions); \"What's My Line?\"; \"I've Got a Secret\"; \"Personality\"; \"Snap Judgement\"; \"He Said, She Said\" (with then-husband Greg Mullavey); \"Tattletales\" (also with Mullavey); \"Hollywood Squares\"; \"The Dating Game\"; \"To Tell the Truth\"; \"Password\" (ABC version); \"$10,000 Pyramid\"; \"$25,000 Pyramid; Break the Bank\"; \"Celebrity Whew!\"; \"Beat the Clock\"; \"Card Sharks\"; \"The Cross-Wits\"; and \"Family Feud\". She had even hosted an unsold game show pilot called \"$50,000 a Minute\" alongside Geoff Edwards in 1985.\n\nIn the 1980s she hosted the talk show \"Mid-Morning Los Angeles,\" which ran for eight years. She was awarded a local Emmy Award in 1986 for her interviewing skills. Later, she created and hosted \"Born Famous\", a PBS series on which she interviewed the offspring of celebrities.\n\nIn 1994, she narrated the audio book version of columnist Deboarah Laake's book \"\".\n\nIn summer stock in her teens, she appeared with Dan Dailey in \"Take Me Along\", with Andy Williams in \"Bye Bye Birdie\", and in \"Annie Get Your Gun\". \n\nMacRae worked to raise funds for such causes as the Children's Burn Foundation, the American Cancer Society, and United Cerebral Palsy. She also lectured nationally on alcoholism and produced a TV special on the subject.\n\nMacRae married Richard Berger, former president of MGM, in 1964 but divorced four years later. In 1969, she married fellow actor Greg Mullavey (famous for \"Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman\") and had one child with him, Alison (b. 1974), before divorcing in 1987. Her third and final marriage was in 1995 to Phillip M. Neal, chairman and CEO of Avery-Dennison at the time of their marriage.\n\nIn January 1999, MacRae began to experience vertigo and a loss of short-term memory. She was evaluated and her symptoms were initially thought to be due to perimenopause. She returned to her doctor complaining of severe headaches. She was told the headaches were most likely due to muscle spasms, and was encouraged to do cervical spine stretching. She obtained a second opinion and was diagnosed with brain cancer, which had already progressed to stage 4. Emergency surgery was performed to remove the brain tumor and decrease the pressure in her head. During the operation she suffered cardiac arrest but was resuscitated. Though her cancer was terminal, she agreed to be part of an experimental cancer drug program. She experienced an allergic reaction to the medication that caused swelling to her brain. Two more surgeries were required to relieve the pressure. Her imbalance resulted in a fall that caused her to suffer a fracture to her hip.\n\nOn July 14, 2000, MacRae died at her Manhattan Beach home at age 56 from complications of brain cancer. Per her wishes, her body was cremated and her ashes scattered in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California.\n\nSolo\n\nThe Girls from Petticoat Junction (Meredith MacRae, Linda Kaye Henning and Lori Saunders)\n\n"}

Orders were given for a supporting artillery column of almost 100 militia and gunners with two howitzers to follow and link up with the infantry column halfway between Wexford and Duncannon at the village of Taghmon.\n\nMaking rapid progress and encountering no opposition, Fawcett's column arrived about dusk at Taghmon and free-quartered his troops for the night among the inhabitants of the village. Sometime after two o’clock in the morning, the slower artillery column arrived at Taghmon but pressed on towards Wexford for unclear reasons. It appears that patriot sympathisers and agents may have duped the column with false reports of a clear road to Wexford and of the urgency of their pressing ahead.\n\nContrary to these reports, a large army of South Wexford patriots had gathered on Forth Mountain and were well aware of the advancing British redcoats. An ambush position was prepared at the eastern end of Forth mountain, where the ground receded to the \"Three Rocks\". In the pre-dawn darkness, patriot musket men were stationed parallel to the anticipated line of advance, concealed behind the rock outcrops and scrub while hundreds of pikemen waited out of sight. Patriot signallers with flags watched the approaches and waited for the troops to enter the chosen killing ground.\n\nAs dawn broke, the British column walked unsuspectingly into the trap and suffered a close-range volley of musket fire followed by a massed pike charge into the line, giving the soldiers no chance of regrouping. The fighting was over in a matter of minutes, leaving around 70 of the militia dead, most of the gunners captured, and the two howitzers in the hands of the patriots.\n\nA few survivors of the rout reached Fawcett’s force in Taghmon about an hour later, bringing news of the disaster. Unnerved by the annihilation of his support column and by the prospect of attack from United Irishmen armed with artillery, Fawcett ordered his men to retreat to Duncannon, thus abandoning his original mission to relieve Wexford.\n\nMeanwhile, the commander of the British garrison at Wexford, General Maxwell, concerned by the non-arrival of the troops from Duncannon and by reports of fighting, led a force of cavalry in the direction of the Three Rocks to meet the expected reinforcements. They soon encountered United Irishmen drawing up the captured artillery to use against Wexford and fled back to the town but lost a cavalry captain to rebel gunfire before escaping.\n\nThe retreat of the cavalry, news of defeat at Three Rocks, the prospect of facing patriots with artillery, and the visible massing of more patriots north across Wexford bridge sapped the garrison's will to resist, and envoys suing for peace were dispatched to parley with the approaching patriots. Though the intention to surrender the town was genuine, the garrison had no intention of being held prisoner by the patriots and sneaked away while the United Irishmen were distracted by the peace envoys, wreaking revenge by indiscriminately burning, raping and murdering as they fled to Duncannon.\n\nThe garrison was well away before the United Irishmen forces entered the town, freeing prisoners such as Bagenal Harvey, setting up a Committee of Public Safety derived from the French model, and even organising a makeshift navy to protect the harbour. Any British military personnel or prominent loyalists who failed to escape were quickly rounded up to be lodged in the town jail, a prison ship, or makeshift prisons.\n\nThe United Irishmen now had control of almost all County Wexford, and were in a powerful position to launch offensives against the few remaining foreign garrisons in the county at Bunclody, Gorey, and New Ross.\n"}
{"id": "2045166", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2045166", "title": "Electro-Shock Blues", "text": "Electro-Shock Blues\n\nElectro-Shock Blues is the second studio album by American rock band Eels. It was released in the United Kingdom on September 21, 1998 and October 20 in the United States by record label DreamWorks.\n\n\"Electro-Shock Blues\" was written largely in response to frontman Mark Oliver Everett's (more commonly known as E) sister's suicide and his mother's terminal lung cancer. The title refers to the electroconvulsive therapy received by Elizabeth Everett when she was institutionalized. Many of the songs deal with their decline, his response to loss and coming to terms with suddenly becoming the only living member of his family (his father having died of a heart attack in 1982; Everett, then 19 years old, was the first to discover his body).\n\nThough much of the album is, on its surface, bleak, its underlying message is that of coping with some of life's most difficult occurrences. The record begins with \"Elizabeth on the Bathroom Floor\", a sparse piece composed of one of his deceased sister's final diary entries. Later, the album's emotional climax is reached in two tracks: \"Climbing to the Moon\", which draws upon E's experiences visiting his sister at a mental health facility shortly before her death; and \"Dead of Winter\", a song about his mother's painful radiation treatment and slow succumbing. The album's last song, entitled \"P.S. You Rock My World\", is a hopeful bookend to \"Elizabeth\", containing subtly humorous lyrics that describe, among other things, an elderly woman at a gas station honking her car at E, incorrectly assuming he is the attendant, and E's decision that \"maybe it's time to live\".\n\nAccording to the Eels official website, the song \"Baby Genius\" is about E's father, Dr. Hugh Everett III, a quantum physicist who authored the Many Worlds Theory. However, Jim Lang, who helped with the song, believed it was about Eels former bassist, Tommy Walter. \"Baby Genius\" has, as the basis for its melody, the carol \"O Sanctissima\".\n\nAt the time of the album's recording, the only official Eels members were E himself and drummer Butch Norton, as Tommy Walter had left the band. Therefore, the recording features guest appearances by T-Bone Burnett, Lisa Germano, Grant Lee Phillips and Jon Brion.\n\n\"Electro-Shock Blues\" was released September 21, 1998 by record label DreamWorks. In addition to CD and cassette releases, it was also released on vinyl. This version included two 10\" 33 RPM discs on see-through blue vinyl, limited to a small pressing.\n\nCommercially the album didn't fare well, selling considerably less than \"Beautiful Freak\".\n\n\"Electro-Shock Blues\" was well-received by critics. Robert Hilburn of the \"Los Angeles Times\" called it \"a brilliant work that combines often conflicting emotions so skillfully that you are reminded at times of the childhood innocence of Brian Wilson, the wicked satire of Randy Newman and the soul-baring intensity of John Lennon.\" Marc Weingarten of \"Entertainment Weekly\" wrote that while the album \"lays bare the horrors of terminal illness in songs that shift from clinical to disconsolate\", its \"real feat is in making death life-affirming\".\n\nColin Cooper of \"Stylus Magazine\", in a retrospective write-up of \"Electro-Shock Blues\", described it as \"an album that reeks of classic on all levels: scene is set, tone established, problem arisen, grappled, fought (nearly lost) and eventually—joyously—overcome.\" Sputnikmusic reviewer Robin called it \"deeper than some ironic indie pop record: it's E's honest smack of tough love, and he is his own recipient.\"\n\nThe Daniel Johnston song \"Living Life\" was played often on the \"Electro-Shock Blues\" tour, eventually seeing a studio release in 2004 on the tribute compilation \"\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2045174", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2045174", "title": "Beechcraft Model 18", "text": "Beechcraft Model 18\n\nThe Beechcraft Model 18 (or \"Twin Beech\", as it is also known) is a 6- to 11-seat, twin-engined, low-wing, tailwheel light aircraft manufactured by the Beech Aircraft Corporation of Wichita, Kansas. Continuously produced from 1937 to November 1969 (over 32 years, a world record at the time), over 9,000 were built, making it one of the world's most widely used light aircraft. Sold worldwide as a civilian executive, utility, cargo aircraft, and passenger airliner on tailwheels, nosewheels, skis, or floats, it was also used as a military aircraft.\n\nDuring and after World War II, over 4,500 Beech 18s were used in military service—as light transport, light bomber (for China), aircrew trainer (for bombing, navigation, and gunnery), photo-reconnaissance, and \"mother ship\" for target drones—including United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) C-45 Expeditor, AT-7 Navigator, and AT-11 Kansan; and United States Navy (USN) UC-45J Navigator, SNB-1 Kansan, and others. In World War II, over 90% of USAAF bombardiers and navigators trained in these aircraft.\n\nIn the early postwar era, the Beech 18 was the pre-eminent \"business aircraft\" and \"feeder airliner\". Besides carrying passengers, its civilian uses have included aerial spraying, sterile insect release, fish stocking, dry-ice cloud seeding, aerial firefighting, air-mail delivery, ambulance service, numerous movie productions, skydiving, freight, weapon- and drug-smuggling, engine testbed, skywriting, banner towing, and stunt aircraft. Many are now privately owned, around the world, with 240 in the U.S. still on the FAA Aircraft Registry in August 2017.\n\nBy the late 1930s, Beechcraft management speculated that a demand would exist for a new design dubbed the Model 18, which would have a military application, and increased the main production facilities. The design was mainly conventional for the time, including twin radial engines, all-metal semimonocoque construction with fabric-covered control surfaces, and tailwheel undercarriage. Less conventional was the twin-tailfin configuration. The Model 18 can be mistaken for the larger Lockheed Electra series of airliners, which closely resemble it. Early production aircraft were powered either by two 330-hp (250-kW) Jacobs L-6s or 350-hp (260-kW) Wright R-760Es. The 450-hp (336-kW) Pratt & Whitney R-985 became the definitive engine from the prewar C18S onwards. The Beech 18 prototype first flew on January 15, 1937.\n\nThe aircraft has used a variety of engines and has had a number of airframe modifications to increase gross weight and speed. At least one aircraft was modified to a 600-hp (447-kW) Pratt & Whitney R-1340 powerplant configuration. With the added weight of about 200 lb (91 kg) per engine, the concept of a Model 18 fitted with R-1340 engines was deemed unsatisfactory due to the weakest structural area of the aircraft being the engine mounts. Nearly every airframe component has been modified.\n\nIn 1955, deliveries of the Model E18S commenced; the E18S featured a fuselage that was extended higher for more headroom in the passenger cabin. All later Beech 18s (sometimes called Super 18s) featured this taller fuselage, and some earlier models (including one AT-11) have been modified to this larger fuselage. The Model H18, introduced in 1963, featured optional tricycle undercarriage. Unusually, the undercarriage was developed for earlier-model aircraft under an STC by Volpar, and installed in H18s at the factory during manufacture. A total of 109 H18s was built with tricycle undercarriage, and another 240 earlier-model aircraft were modified with this.\n\nConstruction of the Beechcraft Model 18 ended in 1970 with a final Model H18 going to Japan Airlines. Through the years, 32 variations of the basic design had flown, over 200 improvement modification kits were developed, and almost 8,000 aircraft were built. In one case, the aircraft was modified to a triple tail, trigear, humpbacked configuration and appeared similar to a miniature Lockheed Constellation. Another distinctive conversion was carried out by Pacific Airmotive as the PacAero Tradewind. This featured a lengthened nose to accommodate the tricycle nosewheel, and the Model 18's twin tailfins were replaced by a single fin.\n\nProduction got an early boost when Nationalist China paid the company US$750,000 for six M18R light bombers, but by the time of the U.S. entry into World War II, only 39 Model 18s had been sold, of which 29 were for civilian customers. Work began in earnest on a variant specifically for training military pilots, bombardiers, and navigators. The effort resulted in the Army AT-7 and Navy SNB. Further development led to the AT-11 and SNB-2 navigation trainers and the C-45 military transport. The United States Air Force (USAF) Strategic Air Command had Model 18 variants (AT-11 Kansans, C-45 Expeditors, F-2 Expeditors (the \"F\" standing for \"Fotorecon\", short for \"photographic reconnaissance\"), and UC-45 Expeditors) from 1946 until 1951. From 1951 to 1955, the USAF had many of its aircraft remanufactured with new fuselages, wing center sections, and undercarriages to take advantage of the improvements to the civil models since the end of World War II. Eventually, 900 aircraft were remanufactured to be similar to the then-current Model D18S and given new designations, constructor's numbers, and Air Force serial numbers. The USN had many of its surviving aircraft remanufactured, as well, these being redesignated as SNB-5s and SNB-5Ps. The C-45 flew in USAF service until 1963, the USN retired its last SNB in 1972, while the U.S. Army flew its C-45s until 1976. In later years, the military called these aircraft \"bug smashers\" in reference to their extensive use supplying mandatory flight hours for desk-bound aviators in the Pentagon.\n\nBeech 18s were used extensively by Air America during the Vietnam War; initially more-or-less standard ex-military C-45 examples were used, but then the airline had 12 aircraft modified by Conrad Conversions in 1963 and 1964 to increase performance and load-carrying capacity. The modified aircraft were known as Conrad Ten-Twos, as the maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) was increased to . The increase was achieved by several airframe modifications, including increased horizontal stabilizer angle-of-incidence, redesigned undercarriage doors, and aerodynamically improved wingtips. Air America then had Volpar convert 14 aircraft to turboprop power, fitted with Garrett AiResearch TPE-331 engines; modified aircraft were called Volpar Turbo Beeches, and also had a further increase in MTOW to .\n\nThe wing spar of the Model 18 was fabricated by welding an assembly of tubular steel. The configuration of the tubes in combination with drilled holes from aftermarket STC modifications on some of these aircraft have allowed the spar to become susceptible to corrosion and cracking while in service. This prompted the FAA to issue an Airworthiness Directive in 1975, mandating the fitting of a spar strap to some Model 18s. This led, in turn, to the retirement of a large number of STC-modified Model 18s when owners determined the aircraft were worth less than the cost of the modifications. The corrosion on unmodified spars was not a problem; it occurred due to the additional exposed surface area created through the STC hole-drilling process. Further requirements have been mandated by the FAA and other national airworthiness authorities, including regular removal of the spar strap to allow the strap to be checked for cracks and corrosion and the spar to be X-rayed. In Australia, the airworthiness authority has placed a life limit on the airframe, beyond which aircraft are not allowed to fly.\n\nUnless otherwise noted, the engines fitted are Pratt & Whitney R-985 radials.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-45Ds delivered between 1951 and 1952.\n\n\n\n, the Beechcraft Model 18 remains popular with air charter companies and small feeder airlines worldwide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Other soldiers in his unit wrote to Band's sister Elizabeth Petrie to express their condolences; a year later, one of them finally confirmed in a letter to her that her suspicions her brother had been \"the crucified soldier\" were true. Band's body was never recovered, and he is commemorated on the Menin Gate memorial.\n\nThe evidence discovered by Overton included a typewritten note by a British nurse found in the Liddle Collection of war correspondence in Leeds University. The note related comments by a Lance Corporal C.M. Brown to his nurse, Miss Ursula Violet Chaloner, who he told of a Sergeant Harry Band who was \"crucified after a battle of Ypres on one of the doors of a barn with five bayonets in him.\"\n\nIn 2004 Overton won a Scottish BAFTA for the exposé Security Wars, a BBC film highlighting corruption in the security industry in Scotland. In 2005 he won a Peabody Award for a BBC report on counterfeiting in the pharmaceutical industry. In that year he was also a producer on the series that won, with reporter Simon Reeve, a One World Award for best popular feature for the series \"Places That Don't Exist\" for the BBC.\nIn August 2005 he was appointed an Executive Producer at ITN. In 2006 he was voted best Broadcast Journalist by the UK bar council for a news report on the proposed changes to the coroners' system, which would have made coroners' investigations into deaths abroad discretionary rather than compulsory.\n\nIn September 2009 he was appointed the first managing editor of the Bureau of Investigative Journalism. \nOverton was not directly involved in the making of the programme which led to the Newsnight/McAlpine affair and the subsequent resignation of BBC Director-General George Entwhistle, but voluntarily resigned from his role at the Bureau of Investigative Journalism in the wake of the scandal to preserve the integrity of the organisation. Overton had agreed to the secondment of a member of his staff to the BBC to produce a Newsnight report with no editorial control over the story.\n\nOn 2 November 2012, Overton tweeted: 'If all goes well we've got a Newsnight out tonight about a very senior political figure who is a paedophile.'\n\nThe BBC TV programme \"Newsnight\" broadcast, shown on 2 November 2012 and reported by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism's lead journalist Angus Stickler made an allegation against an unnamed politician, who was widely identified on the internet as the former Conservative Party Treasurer Lord McAlpine. Lord McAlpine issued a statement strongly denying the accusations. This allegation was subsequently admitted to be false.\n\nRegarding Overton's role in the story, the Trustees of the BIJ concluded that \"The Trustees consider that he (Overton) made a serious error of judgment, and risked the reputation of the Bureau, when he tweeted about the programme on the day of its transmission, both by exaggerating the Bureau's role in the story and by releasing information (that was itself wrong) prematurely.\"\n\nIn this role he oversaw many award winning investigations, including the Wikileaks Iraq War Logs. In 2010/2011, under his editorship, the Bureau won an Amnesty Award, a Thomson Reuters Award and was shortlisted for an IRE award for its reporting. In 2011/2012 the Bureau won a second Amnesty Award \n\nand was nominated for four Press Gazette British Journalism Awards.\n\nIn November 2012, eight members of parliament supported an Early day motion, tabled by Paul Flynn MP, praising the stories reported at the Bureau under Iain Overton's editorship.\n\nIain Overton is the Executive Director of the London-based charity Action on Armed Violence (AOAV).\n\nHe is an expert member on the Forum for the Arms Trade.\n\n\"Gun, Baby Gun: A Bloody Journey into the World of the Gun\" was published by Canongate in 2015.\n\n\"The Spectator\" said it was \"relentlessly engrossing\". \"The Independent\" said it was a \"riveting book...enough to make your jaw drop... without judgement, refusing to descend into anti-gun rhetoric.\" \"The Financial Times\" described it as \"adventurous, ambitiously tracing the often devastating impact of guns around the world.\" \"Gun Baby Gun\" was shortlisted for the 2015 Crime Writer's Association Dagger Awards in the non-fiction category.\nOverton's second book - \"The Price of Paradise: How the Suicide Bomber Shaped the Modern World\" - came out in April 2019.\n\nChristina Lamb reviewed it as \"fascinating... a must-read\" in the \"Sunday Times\".\n\nAnthony Loyd reviewed it as \"outstanding... the author takes confident control over this huge, dense and dark subject... Engrossing\" in the \"New Statesman\".\n\n\n"}

Members included companies and organizations who purchased DEC equipment; many members were application programmers who wrote code for DEC machines or system programmers who managed DEC systems. DECUS was founded in March 1961 by Edward Fredkin.\n\nDECUS was legally a part of Digital Equipment Corporation and subsidized by it; however, it was run by volunteers. Digital staff members were not eligible to join DECUS, yet were allowed and encouraged to participate in DECUS activities. Digital, in turn, relied on DECUS as an important channel of communication with its customers.\n\nDECUS had a software library which accepted orders from anyone, distributing programs submitted to it by people willing to share. It was organized by processor and operating system, using information submitted by program submitters, who signed releases allowing this and asserting their right to do so. The DECUS library published catalogs of these offerings yearly, though because it had the catalog mastered by an outside firm, it did not have easy ways to retrieve the content of early catalogs (prior to circa 1980) in machine readable format. Later material was maintained in house and was more easily edited. The charges for copying were somewhat high, reflecting the fact the copies were made by hand on DECUS equipment.\n\nThere were two DECUS US symposia per year, in which members and DEC employees gave presentation, and could visit an exhibit hall containing many new computer models and peripherals among other things. By grace of the DEC employees, it became a custom to allow users to copy media for one another on these machines. This activity grew with time, and in the spring of 1977 some volunteers from the RSX SIG (Special Interest Group) led by Phil Cannon, Jim Neeland, and several others, arranged an informal drop-off, and made master distributions of all material submitted. Then they and other volunteers essentially made copies of this master distribution on\ntapes for the rest of the symposium, for anyone with a blank tape to write on. This very quickly grew, getting noted in LUG (local user group) and SIG (special interest group) newsletters, and the process of creating a master quickly attracted others who would make a master index of whatever had been submitted. The process of physically creating master tapes remained much the same until around 1979 when the tapecopy coordinators arranged copying facilities somewhere near the symposium site, as 9 track tape drives were not appearing as much on the exhibit hall floor enough to rely on by then. By fall 1979, there was a release form used with submissions, so that the DECUS library could distribute the combined tapes, making them more easily available to those who did not get to the symposia. The VAX/VMS SIG started producing SIG tapes in spring 1979 and other SIGs, notably RSTS, RT-11, Languages and Tools, and the 10/20 SIGs, had analogous distributions made in somewhat similar fashion. The distribution by copying only at the symposium was seen to be inadequate, so a tree of people, each of whom would receive a copy of the material and make copies for others, was devised. In these cases the person desiring the material was expected to furnish blank media, as no money ever changed hands. The tapes grew in size constantly, and eventually moved to 8mm Exabyte media and to CDs, and then to DVDs. By that time nobody worried much about the cost of blanks. The RSX SIG tapes continued until 1992, when material was drying up. Some RSX material was put on VMS SIG tapes after that, and around 1987 the Languages and Tools sig tapes merged in. The distributions continued to be released twice a year until 2005, and were released yearly in 2006 and 2007 when the tapecopy coordinator who had been making masters since the mid 1980s, Glenn Everhart, passed the material on. By that time, network distribution had become good enough that media copy was no longer necessary in most places.\n\nThe DECUS U.S. Chapter conducted technical conferences at various locations, and ran other operations like Local User Groups (LUGs) and Special Interest Groups. Chapters in other nations did likewise. DECUS also promoted the open exchange of user-developed software, largely via magnetic tape.\n\nDECUS played a critical role in the development of computer games in North America in the 1970s. The pioneering titles \"Adventure\" by Will Crowther; \"Baseball\", \"Dungeon\" and \"Star Trek\" by Don Daglow and \"Hunt the Wumpus\" by Gregory Yob provided a foundation for the games industry. One of the first real-time interactive multi-user games, \"MTrek\" (MultiTrek), was also distributed on DECUS tapes. Major commercial game titles including \"Zork\" and \"Empire\" were first popularized by DECUS.\n\nIn the 1990s, DECUS played a significant role in integration of isolated post-Soviet scientific, technology and business communities into worldwide community.\n\nIn 1998, Compaq acquired Digital, and DECUS became a Compaq user group.\n\nIn 2000, the DECUS U.S. Chapter incorporated as the independent user group Encompass.\n\nIn 2002, Hewlett-Packard acquired Compaq, and DECUS became an HP User Society.\n\nIn 2008, the HP user communities Encompass, ITUG and HP Interex EMEA consolidated to form Connect Worldwide.\n\nMembership was organized by country. Each chapter acted as part of the worldwide Association of Hewlett-Packard User Groups. DECUS had some 7,500 members, mostly system, network, and applications specialists as well as IT Managers.\n\nAssociation activities: The HP User Society DECUS promoted the exchange of information and know-how between its members, manufacturers and partners. The association supported its members in the representation of their interests against HP and partners, helped in problem solving and facilitates formation of opinion and advanced training by organizing events.\n\nSome early and well-known members of DECUS were the late Terry Shannon and John R. Wisniewski.\n\n\n"}

The tribe is also known as the \"dirk-toothed cats\". They were endemic to South America, North America, Europe, Asia, and Africa during the Miocene to Pleistocene, from 10.3 mya—11,000 years ago, existing for approximately .\n\nAs the name suggests, the famous genus of \"Smilodon\" is part of this group, but there are also three other distinct genera in Smilodontini. The earliest known genus of the tribe is \"Promegantereon\", once thought to be a species of \"Paramachairodus\". The tribe only became extinct 10,000 years ago, with the demise of \"Smilodon\". All of these are saber-toothed cats, meaning that they have long, narrow upper canines and stocky, well muscled proportions.\n\nThe various members of smilodontini are generally distinguished by their long, narrow upper canines. However, the stockiness often seen as one of the tribe's signature features varied between the different genera. \"Promegantereon\" and \"Paramachairodus\" for example, were likely arboreal or at the least, scansorial, given their moderately long tails, large dewclaws and smaller, slender builds. These species also had relatively small upper canines for their size, though they already showed the flat, blade-like edges that defined them as those of machairodonts. \"Megantereon\", a later species, was more intermediate in physiology between these earlier forms and the more cursorial \"Rhizosmilodon\" and \"Smilodon\" itself, which were better built for life on ground, as well as bringing down relatively larger prey.\n\nThe phylogenetic relationships of Smilodontini are shown in the following cladogram:\nLike all machairodonts, smilodontins were equipped to hunt and kill prey in a manner that was seemingly quicker and more efficient than what is seen in modern cats like the pantherinae. Using their elongated canines, smilodontins would aim for the vital spots of the neck or belly (the exact placement of such bites is still hotly debated among experts), killing either by disembowelment of by severing major arteries such as the carotid. The enlarged carnassials would then be used to shear meat from the bones as the cat fed. In regards to feeding habits, the carnassials of \"Megantereon\" suggest that it was a loner that fed at leisurely paces in deep bushes or in trees, while \"Smilodon\" on the other end of the spectrum, lived in what was probably a highly competitive environment and in addition, seems to have been social, suggesting a need to eat as much as possible without losing a meal to scavengers.\n"}
{"id": "2045210", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2045210", "title": "Cyclosportive", "text": "Cyclosportive\n\nA cyclosportive, or often simply sportive, is a short to long distance, organised, mass-participation cycling event, typically held annually. The Italian term Gran Fondo is commonly used for these events in the United States, Australia and some other English-speaking countries.\n\nCyclosportive is short for the French term randonnée cyclosportive (the spelling cyclosportif is sometimes also used but \"cyclosportive\" is correct as \"randonnée\" is a feminine noun in French).\n\nMany cyclists use sportives to challenge themselves in a personal battle against the distance and then ultimately, the clock. Some participants in a cyclosportive will ride the event like a race, with prizes awarded and considerable prestige for top place finishers, particularly in events like La Marmotte, L'Étape du Tour and the Ardechoise.\n\nA cyclosportive falls between a traditional cycle road race and the more challenging non-competitive randonnée or Audax events. Riders normally carry a number and the time they take to complete the course is recorded. There is usually an upper time limit within which the course must be completed (unlike many randonnée events, there is no lower limit preventing riders from completing the course quickly). The already lengthy course will traditionally include climbs and difficult riding conditions, adding to the merit of the event (e.g. the cobblestones of the Paris–Roubaix).\n\nThe routes will usually be well sign-posted and/or marshalled (some cyclosportives take place on roads which have been closed to motor traffic for the duration of the event), riders will be able to use feeding stations positioned at intervals along the route to replenish their food and drink supplies and mechanical and medical support may also be provided. Some attract thousands of participants - since 2000 l'Etape du Tour has offered places to 8,500 riders each year.\n\nAlthough sportives are not races, entrants’ times are usually recorded and sometimes riders are given their finishing position. This can encourage the fastest cyclists to push the pace, with faster riders working together to increase speed in a pro-peloton style. The majority of riders will simply be happy to complete the distance within the time allowance. It is common in France and Italy for prizes to be awarded to the winner and to those winning age-related categories. In the United Kingdom, sportives are not held as races in order to avoid strict rules governing cycle races on public roads.\n\nThe first ever French cyclosportive was La Marmotte, which was first run in 1982 on a route starting in Bourg d'Oisans and taking in the Col de la Croix de Fer, Col du Telegraphe and Col du Galibier before climbing to finish at the top of one of the most famous Tour de France climbs at Alpe d'Huez. It remains one of the most popular cyclosportive events today in Europe and is often considered to be the hardest cyclosportive.\n\nArguably the most famous of the cyclosportives today is the French l'Etape du Tour, held each July over a stage of that particular year’s Tour de France, usually a mountain stage. This over-subscribed event sees approximately 7,500 riders attempting to emulate the professional cyclists. The Ardéchoise is one of Europe's largest event with 15,000 riders taking part but this time participants are able to choose from a range of circuits, from 66 km to 268 km. The Tour of Flanders had 18,000 participants in its 2007 edition and 17,000 in 2008. Riders can also choose from different circuits including mountainbike courses, from 28 km to 256 km. These events often enjoy roads closed to traffic for the duration of the event, allowing riders to enjoy the full width of the road and to profit from the often technical sections of the route.\n\nAnother coveted French event, the Paris-Roubaix Challenge, mimics the legendary one-day classic Paris–Roubaix. Held bi-annually, this sportive increases the test of reliability and endurance yet further with 26 sections of pavé which total some 42 km (26miles). It is not uncommon for riders to break bikes and even bones over these cobbled roads. Other notable events are the Cape Argus Cycle Tour in South Africa which celebrated its 30th year in 2007 with 40,000 entrants and Italy’s Maratona dles Dolomites.\n\nThe largest open road cyclosportive in the UK is the \"Verenti Dragon Ride Wales\", held each June over a challenging 200 km mountainous course in South Wales. There are three UK cyclosportives held on closed roads: the annual \"Etape Caledonia\" which attracted some 3,500 cyclists in its 2009 edition, follows a route around the Perthshire highlands; the \"Etape Cymru\", first held in October 2011 on North Wales roads including the Horseshoe Pass; and the Prudential RideLondon-Surrey 100 through central London and the Surrey countryside, which in its inaugural run in 2013 was completed by nearly 16,000 riders, and by over 20,000 the next year.\n\nCyclosportives that are longer than 300 km fit the criteria for ultra-distance cycling events. Although the Milan-San Remo cyclosportive proclaims itself to be the “longest Granfondo in the world”, it is only long and there are several others that are longer. Bordeaux-Paris was a professional race until 1988 and returned in 2014 as a cyclosportive with a route of about . The Tour du Mont Blanc is a long cyclosportive over mountainous terrain through France, Switzerland, and Italy. Slightly longer still is the Wysam 333 in Switzerland at . There is also the Vätternrundan cyclosportive that does a tour of the Swedish lake, which is a route that measures .\n\nIn New Zealand, there is the Lake Taupo Cycle Challenge. The standard cyclosportive option involves a single lap of the lake, which is long, but there are also options to do two laps in one day for , with no support on the first lap, or start one day earlier and do four laps, , which is more of a randonneuring event. Every second year there is also an 8 lap option, long, but a following support vehicle is required for that version making it an ultracycling event.\n\n\n"}

The Virginia militia was established in 1607 as part of the English militia system. Militia service in Virginia was compulsory for all free males. The main purpose of the Crown's militia was to repel invasions and insurrections and to enforce the laws of the colony.\n\nIn 1623, the year following the outbreak of the first major Anglo-Powhatan War in Virginia, the Virginia General Assembly commanded, \"that men go not to work in the ground without their arms; That no man go or send abroad without a sufficient partie well armed.\" In 1661 Governor William Berkeley stated, \"All our freemen are bound to be trained every month in their particular counties.\" The British county lieutenant system was employed as the population grew; each county had a lieutenant, appointed as the county's chief militia officer.\n\nThe militia system was originally used to defend against Native American tribes in the tidewater area. As the slave population grew in the Virginia Colony, the militia played a role in keeping slaves from running away or from revolting – through the use of militia patrollers. This Virginia militia system was put to the test in 1676 during Bacon's Rebellion. The Crown's militia was victorious over Nathaniel Bacon who tried to seize power.\n\nThe English Bill of Rights of 1689 guaranteed colonial Virginians, as loyal British subjects, the following\n\nDuring the French and Indian War (1754–1763), a formal act came into effect.\n\nIn 1774, revolution was at Virginia's doorstep when Royal Governor Lord Dunmore dissolved the Virginia House of Burgesses because of their support of the city of Boston against the closing of the Port of Boston by Lord North. On May 15, 1776 the Virginia General Assembly voted unanimously for independence and to have a declaration of rights drawn up. Colonel George Mason became the principal author of the Virginia Declaration of Rights which was published on June 12, 1776. Mason drew from his own previous writings upon his founding of the Fairfax County Independent Company of Volunteers on September 21, 1774. This company was a paramilitary organization independent of the Crown's militia. Article 13 of the Virginia Declaration of Rights which established the militia clause as a fundamental right was based upon three solid English rights: the right to revolution, the right to group self-preservation and the right to self-defense. Under Article 13 of the Virginia Declaration of Rights he wrote:\n\nShortly after the Revolutionary War began, Kentucky County, Virginia was organized with George Rogers Clark as head of its local militia. Clark asked Governor Patrick Henry for permission to lead a secret expedition to capture the nearest British posts, which were located in the Illinois country. Governor Henry commissioned Clark as a lieutenant colonel and authorized him to raise troops for the expedition. The Illinois campaign began in July 1778, when Clark and about 175 men crossed the Ohio River at Fort Massac and marched to Kaskaskia, taking it on the night of July 4. Cahokia, Vincennes, and several other villages and forts in British territory were subsequently captured without firing a shot, because most of the French-speaking and American Indian inhabitants were unwilling to take up arms on behalf of the British. To counter Clark's advance, Henry Hamilton reoccupied Vincennes with a small force. In February 1779, Clark returned to Vincennes in a surprise winter expedition and retook the town, capturing Hamilton in the process. The winter expedition was Clark's most significant military achievement.\n\nThe Virginia militia system, as a compulsory service composed of the body of the people trained to arms as envisioned by George Mason, remained intact until the end of the American Civil War. Reconstruction governments forced upon Virginia an all-volunteer militia system in opposition to Virginia's Bill of Rights. The militia became statutorily composed of the volunteer and the unorganized militia.\n\nIn 1771, the Virginia Bill of Rights under Article I, Section 13, was changed to the following by popular vote:\n\nThat a well regulated militia, composed of the body of the people, trained to arms, is the proper, natural, and safe defense of a free state, therefore, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed; that standing armies, in time of peace, should be avoided as dangerous to liberty; and that in all cases the military should be under strict subordination to, and governed by, the civil power.\n\nThe current Virginia Militia under Virginia Code states § 44-1. Composition of militia.\n\nThe militia of the Commonwealth of Virginia shall consist of all able-bodied residents of the Commonwealth who are citizens of the United States and all other able-bodied persons resident in the Commonwealth who have declared their intention to become citizens of the United States, who are at least 16 years of age and, except as hereinafter provided, not more than 55 years of age. The militia shall be divided into three classes: the National Guard, which includes the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard; the Virginia Defense Force; and the unorganized militia.The Code of Virginia, Section 44-117 states, \"The officers of the Virginia Military Institute, the Virginia Women's Institute for Leadership at Mary Baldwin College, the Fishburne Military School, the Massanutten Military Academy, and the Commandant of Cadets and Assistant Commandants of Cadets of the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University shall be commissioned officers of the Virginia militia, unorganized, and subject to the orders of the Governor and the same rules and regulations as to discipline provided for other commissioned officers of the military organizations of the Commonwealth.\" Permanent faculty members of the Virginia Military Institute (VMI) are normally offered commissions in the naval or unorganized militia of Virginia. The Superintendent of VMI is normally a Lieutenant General of the unorganized Virginia militia unless he or she is a regular US military officer of higher rank. The corps of cadets also serves as cadet members of the unorganized militia. Staff members of the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets also may hold officer appointments in the Virginia Militia, unless they hold higher rank as active or retired US military officers.\n\n\n"}

Her Kriegsmarine designation was Schiff 21, to the Royal Navy she was Raider D. The name \"Widder\" (Ram) represents the constellation Aries in German.\n\nBuilt for HAPAG, the Hamburg America Line, at Howaldtswerke, Kiel, she was launched in 1930 as the freighter \"Neumark\". After an uneventful career she was requisitioned by the \"Kriegsmarine\" for use as a commerce raider. She was converted for this purpose by Blohm & Voss in late 1939, and commissioned as the raider \"Widder\" on 9 December of that year. She sailed on her first and only raiding voyage in May 1940.\n\n\"Widder\" sailed as part of the Kriegsmarine's first wave of commerce raiders, sailing on 6 May 1940 under the command of \"Korvettenkapitän\" (later \"Fregattenkapitän\") Helmuth von Ruckteschell.\n\nLeaving Germany on 6 May 1940, she made for Bergen, in Norway. On 13 May the \"Widder\" confronted the British submarine on the surface, enjoining an exchange of gunfire which lasted for over an hour, with no hits for either side. After the engagement, the cruiser sought shelter in Sandsfjord. On 14 May she sailed to the open sea, crossing the Arctic Circle the next day. On 21 August 1940, 800 miles west of the Canary Islands, she sank the , which had been carrying a cargo of coal from Newport, Wales, to Bahía Blanca, Argentina. After refuelling from the auxiliary ship \"Nordmark\", she slipped through the Denmark Strait. Over a 5½ month period she captured and sank ten ships, totalling .\n\nThe \"Widder\" was reported to have machine-gunned the crew of the SS \"Anglo Saxon\" in their life-boats; one jolly boat with seven crewmen got away. Over two months later, on 27 October, the last two survivors in the boat landed in the Bahamas after a 2,275 mile voyage. One of the two died when his new ship was torpedoed in 1941, the other survived the war and testified against von Ruckteschell, who was sentenced to seven years for his war crime.\n\nHaving completed her mission, she returned to occupied France on 31 October 1940.\n\nDeemed unsuitable as a merchant raider due to persistent drive problems, \"Widder\" was re-christened \"Neumark\", and used as a repair ship in Norway, playing a major role in repairing the battleship Tirpitz in 1943/1944. After the war she was taken into British service as \"Ulysses\", then sold back to Germany as \"Fechenheim\" in 1950 before being wrecked off Bergen in 1955. Her hull was scrapped shortly after.\n\nShe was one of only two German auxiliary cruisers to survive the war, after one 1940 cruise. Her captain, Helmuth von Ruckteschell, was one of only two German naval commanders convicted of war crimes at the end of the war.\n\n\n"}

The phrase is used in both its Latin and English forms as a proverb that \"time's a-wasting\". \n\n\"Tempus fugit\" is typically employed as an admonition against sloth and procrastination (cf. \"carpe diem\") rather than a motto in favor of licentiousness (cf. \"gather ye rosebuds while ye may\"); the English form is often merely descriptive: \"time flies like the wind\", \"time flies when you're having fun\".\n\nThe phrase is a common motto, particularly on sundials and clocks.

{"id": "2045248", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2045248", "title": "Krivošije", "text": "Krivošije\n\nKrivošije (, (Serbian and Montenegrin: Кривошије) are a historical tribe and microregion in southwestern Montenegro, located on a high plateau belonging to the Orjen mountain range, north of the Bay of Kotor. Krivošije was historically located at a tripoint between the Principality of Montenegro, Austro-Hungarian (formerly Venetian) Bay of Kotor and Ottoman Sanjak of Herzegovina.\n\nIt is speculated that the name of the region is derived from the last name Krivošić, which is mentioned in 15th century Ragusan sources. In Serbo-Croatian language, \"krivi\" (neutral form \"krivo\") means \"bent\" or \"crooked\", while \"šije\" (singular: \"šija\") means \"necks\", and it may be derived from some ancestor with a deformity. It might also be derived from the word \"krv\" meaning blood, as in linked by blood relationships.\n\nKrivošije are a mountainous karst region above Risan, located at around 1000 metres above the sea level, spanning on 114 km of land. It is a high plateau on the northern and eastern branches of Mount Orjen (1894 m) in southwest Montenegro, near in the hinterland of the Bay of Kotor. A significant geological and geomorphological feature of the region are the glacial deposits distributed across the whole of the plateau. They were deposited by valley glaciers coming from Orjen during the Ice Age. Krivošije is the region with the greatest rainfall in Europe.\n\nReovačka greda is a mountaiin ridge located near Crkvice in central Krivošije, is the location of the region's highest peak Pazua (1769 m), which is used for trad climbing.\n\nSettlements in the region include Crkvice (inhabited location with the highest annual precipitation in the Europe), Dragalj, Han, Malov Do, Knežlaz, , Unijerina and Zvečava.\n\nKrivošije are within the Mediterranean subtropical belt. While summers are hot and sunny, autumn, winter and spring are rainy seasons. A peculiarity of the littoral Dinarids is the precipitation regime as the settlements of Orjen receive more precipitation than any others in Europe. Like the monsoon rain it is seasonally distributed, thus November thunderstorms sometimes pour 2000 liters of water in several days, while August is frequently completely dry, leading to forest fires. With a maximum discharge of 350 m³/s water one of the biggest karst springs, the Sopot spring near Risan, is a remarkable indicator of this seasonality. Most of the time it is inactive but after heavy rain a remarkable waterfall appears 20 m above the Bay of Kotor.\n\nTwo wind systems are noteworthy for their ecological significance: bora and jugo. Strong cold downslope winds of Bura type appear in winter and are most severe in the Bay of Risan. Gusts reach 250 km/h and can lead to a significant fall of temperatures in several hours with freezing events problematic for most of the Mediterranean cultures. Jugo is a warm humid wind and is important as it brings heavy rain. It appears throughout the year but is most frequent in autumn and spring.\n\nThe region came under Venetian rule after the Cretan War (1645–69). The Bay of Kotor, part of Venetian Albania, was also called \"Upper Dalmatia\". The first mention of \"Krivošije\" is from a Venetian report dated 1686, in which 15–20 houses are mentioned in the village.\n\nKrivošije was under Austro-Hungarian control (as part of the Kingdom of Dalmatia) since the Congress of Vienna in 1814. In 1869 an uprising of the local population, which was Orthodox, defeated an expedition force of the powerful Austro-Hungarian army that was attempting to enforce compulsory military service; Austria-Hungary abandoned its efforts, for the time being. Volunteers from the region joined the Serb rebels in the Herzegovina Uprising (1875–77). Austro-Hungarian forces returned in 1881, defeating the rebels. Austria-Hungary immediately began to pacify the region with heavy investment in tremendous fortifications that would make the military harbour in the gulf safe from Montenegrin and Russian aspirations.\n\nDuring World War II, population of Krivošije was equally divided between Partisans and Chetniks. After 1942 and before capitulation of Italy, region was Chetnik stronghold. Local merchant Miloš Kovač organized an armed band of 80 men in Krivošije which threatened Yugoslav Partisan access and control in the region. However, two Partisan detachments were also established in Krivošije under the Communist Party cell in Herceg Novi. In September 1944, the battles of the 10th Montenegrin NOV brigade in Krivošije had the largest echo in the Bay of Kotor and Paštrovići.\n\nMountainous Krivošije region was mostly inhabited by the tribes of Old Montenegro, but also partially by settlers from Herzegovina. The following families were listed as inhabitants of Krivošije: Radulović, Vučurović, Samardžić, Odalović, Kovač, Radojičić, Ilić, Bojanić, Kokotović, Vukićević, Komnenović, Tomović, Vodovar, Žmukić, Popović, Blagojević, Lakićević, Subotić, Miletić, Vidović and Lazović.\n\nKrivošije region faced significant demographic outflows in recent decades, particularly towards the Bay of Kotor. As of 2018, Krivošije, which covers roughly a third of the Kotor Municipality, has only around 110 permanent residents, in comparison with 1,053 inhabitants recorded in 1953.\n\nMost common slava (patron saint day) of the Krivošije clan is St. John the Baptist (\"Jovanjdan\"), celebrated on 20 January.\n\nThe following churches were built in Krivošije:\n\n\nA species of funnel-web spider called Histopona krivosijana was named after the region after its discovery there in 1935.\n\n"}

It is named Mopac Expressway (or, according to some highway signs, Mopac Boulevard) after the Missouri Pacific Railroad (or \"MoPac\"). Local residents will invariably use the name \"MoPac\" rather than calling the road by its number which can cause much confusion as few signs along the road use this name. Adding to the confusion, the road goes in a mostly straight line rather than a loop.\n\nThe original section of the highway was built in the 1970s along the right-of-way of the Missouri Pacific Railroad (now owned by Union Pacific), with the railroad tracks running in the highway median between West 8th Street and Northland Drive. To the north, the tracks run along the east side of newer sections of the highway from Northland Drive to Braker Lane.\n\nThe first mention of Loop 1 came to public record in 1929. In 1944, the City of Austin Planning Commission (CMAC) proposed the highway be built in parts of under-utilized right of way owned by the MoPac railroad. Thus, the highway was eventually given the nickname \"MoPac\" for its proximity to the railroad.\nThe number was originally used for Spur 1 designated on September 26, 1939 from US Highway 90 (US 90) to the Uvalde fish hatchery as a renumbering of SH 3 Spur. This route was cancelled on December 16, 1943. On March 26, 1958, a new route was designated, also called Spur 1, from US 80A to I-10. This route became part of Loop 16 on July 31, 1964, which itself got cancelled on June 26, 1974 when it was transferred to rerouted US 62 and US 85.\nLoop 1 was first designated on October 27, 1967 from US 290 northward to Farm to Market Road 1325 (FM 1325). On October 24, 1985, the designation was extended southward from US 290 to SH 45.\n\nLoop 1's southern terminus is at the beginning of the State Highway 45 stub south of Austin. It passes through the Circle C Ranch housing development and the Edwards Aquifer and intersects SH 71/US 290 (Ben White Boulevard) and Loop 360 (Capital of Texas Highway). It crosses the Colorado River near downtown Austin; the view of the Texas State Capitol from the bridge became one of the Capitol View Corridors protected under state and local law from obstruction by tall buildings in 1983. North of the river, the highway runs parallel to the Balcones Fault and the Missouri-Pacific Railroad before intersects US 183 (Research Boulevard) northwest of downtown. Loop 1 travels concurrently with Farm to Market Road 1325 for several miles before the non-tolled freeway ends at Parmer Lane, spanning a distance of 22.061 miles (35.504 km).\n\nNorth of Parmer Lane, Loop 1 continues as a limited-access toll road to the SH 45 North/Loop 1 interchange, spanning . Frontage roads flank either side of the toll road to Merrilltown Drive.\n\nThe Texas Department of Transportation completed construction of the tollway as part of the 2002 Central Texas Turnpike Project (CTTP). SH 45 North, also part of the project, provides freeway access to Interstate 35 from Loop 1. The 2002 CTTP was scheduled to be completed in September 2007. However, certain sections of the project, including Loop 1 opened early and more than $100 million under budget.\n\nIf and when SH 45 is completed to the south of Austin, Loop 1 will effectively serve as a true loop to the west of the city, being directly connected to SH 45, and indirectly to I-35, at both ends.\n\nSince 1994, TxDOT has proposed the addition of managed lanes to portions of Loop 1. The MoPac Improvement Project was relaunched in July 2010. In December 2010, four alternative proposals were presented to the public, each of which would add one or more lanes; the \"no-build\" alternative was also presented.\nThe additions would not increase the right-of-way of the highway, but would be created by reducing the width of existing lanes and reducing and/or eliminating shoulders.\nAn environmental study was completed in August 2012 with a Finding Of No Significant Impact and a recommendation of one new travel lane in each direction, operated as express lanes.\nConstruction began in 2013, and was originally scheduled for completion in September 2015, but by August 2016, the Central Texas Regional Mobility Authority announced further delays.\nThe first of four tolled sections, specifically the northbound toll lane from RM 2222 to Parmer Lane, opened on October 17, 2016. The remainder of the northbound express lane, from Cesar Chavez Street to Parmer Lane, opened on October 7, 2017, and the entire southbound express lane opened on October 28, 2017.\n\nIn 2013, the Central Texas Regional Mobility Authority (CTRMA) and TxDOT initiated an environmental study to analyze the best options to improve the MoPac intersections at Slaughter Lane and La Crosse Avenue. In December 2015, the study was completed with a Finding Of No Significant Impact for the project, which allowed it to move forward. The selected design included replacing the at-grade intersection at Slaughter Lane with a diverging diamond interchange and the at-grade intersection at La Crosse Avenue with a diamond interchange. The project broke ground in January 2018 with Webber, LLC as the general contractor.\n\nOn August 10, 2018, the existing Slaughter Lane intersection was rerouted to the south. The original intersection was replaced with a bridge over the new Mopac mainlanes. The DDI opened on November 11, 2018, with final completion expected by Spring 2019. The La Crosse Avenue intersection began construction in Fall 2018. On March 29, 2019, the La Crosse Avenue intersection was closed for reconstruction as a bridge. The La Crosse intersection is expected to be completed in 2020. The project as a whole is expected to be completed in 2021.\n\n"}

He graduated from Carmel High School in Carmel, California and, played the cello as a member of the Youth Music Monterey orchestra in Monterey Bay. Later he attended the Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts, on a full scholarship; the first ever awarded to a string player. There Eggleston studied cello with Associate Professor Eugene Friesen and graduated in May 2003.\n\nAfter releasing a small-press album called \"Nico and Rushad\" in 1999 (with fellow musician Nico Georis), Eggleston made his large-scale recording debut with his self-titled Compass Records release with \"Fiddlers 4\", which was nominated for a 2002 Grammy, as well as with Darol Anger's Republic of Strings, bringing him to national prominence. Eggleston has toured extensively with Darol Anger's Republic of Strings, Fiddler's 4, and the alternative folk/bluegrass group he helped found, Crooked Still.

The second tier was also prior to Landsdelsserien known as 1. divisjon (1948–1951). Formally, it was a semi-professional league. The tier has been restructured many times and consists of 16 teams at present.\n\nBetween 1963 and 1990, the second highest level in Norwegian football was named 2. divisjon. In 1991, due to rebranding of the top flight level in 1990, it was renamed to its initial name; 1. divisjon. 1. divisjon has been the name of this level ever since, except for periods when the league has had a sponsor-affiliated name. Between 2005 and 2013 the level was known as Adeccoligaen and from 2015 to 2020 the name is OBOS-ligaen.\n\nIn the 1997 season, 1. divisjon merged from two divisions consisting of 12 teams each, to only one with 14 teams. In the 2001 season, 1. divisjon expanded from 14 to 16 teams. Only two teams were relegated in the 2000 season. In 2009, the number of teams in Eliteserien expanded from 14 to 16. Therefore, only one team was relegated to 1. divisjon, whilst three teams were promoted to Tippeligaen.\n\nSince 2012 four teams, finishing 3rd to 6th, has qualified for promotion play-offs. In the 2017 season the relegation format was changed. The previous format where four teams were relegated was replaced with a format with two relegation spots and one relegation play-off spot.\n\nThe league is contested by 16 teams. During the course of a season, each club plays the others twice, home and away, for a total of 30 games for each club, and a total of 240 games in a season. The season starts in April and lasts until early November. The top two teams will be promoted to Eliteserien, while the teams placed from third to sixth place will play a promotion-playoff against each other to earn the right to play a two-legged game against the 14th-placed team in Eliteserien to win promotion. The bottom two teams will be relegated to the 2. divisjon known as PostNord-ligaen, and the team in 14th place will play a two-legged playoff against the play-off winner among the two-second-placed teams in 2. divisjon.\n\nThe following 16 clubs are competing in the 2019 1. divisjon, nine of which are located in Eastern Norway, four are from Western Norway, two are from Southern Norway and one is from north of the Arctic Circle:\n\nSource:\n\nAhead of the 2015 season, a six-year deal was agreed with the housing cooperative OBOS.

While at Tottenham, Dawson won the League Cup in 2008. His form in the 2009–10 season saw him included in England's preliminary 2010 FIFA World Cup squad. Although he initially failed to make the final 23-man squad, an injury to captain Rio Ferdinand saw him drafted in as replacement.\n\nIn August 2014, Hull City signed Dawson from Tottenham for a fee believed to be £3.5 million. Although relegated with Hull at the end of the 2014–15 season, he helped them return to the Premier League when they beat Sheffield Wednesday in the 2016 Championship play-off Final. He returned to former club Nottingham Forest in May 2018.\n\nBorn in Northallerton, North Yorkshire, Dawson grew up in Leyburn and attended Wensleydale school. He is the younger brother of fellow footballers Andy Dawson and Kevin Dawson.\n\nDawson started his career playing for his local team, Northallerton Juniors, and also spent a year playing for Richmond before signing as a junior professional with Nottingham Forest at the age of 14. He turned professional in November 2000 and made his first-team debut for Forest on 1 April 2002 against Walsall in a 3–2 home defeat.\n\nIn February 2003, Dawson signed a new five-and-a-half-year contract at Forest. During the 2002–03 season, Dawson established himself in the team alongside veteran defender Des Walker, as Forest finished sixth in the First Division to enter the play-offs. Forest played Sheffield United, and Dawson was sent off late in the first leg, making it his final appearance that season. Without Dawson, Forest lost 4–3 in the second leg of the semi-final, being eliminated 5–4 on aggregate.\n\nIn the close season, Dawson contracted glandular fever whilst on duty with the England under-21s, causing him to miss the start of the 2003–04 season. Forest also struggled – winning only twice between the end of September and the beginning of February caused Paul Hart to be replaced by Joe Kinnear. The season was transformed from one battling relegation to a confident mid-table finish with the return of Dawson and David Johnson to the team being one of the reasons for this.\n\nDawson and one of his Forest teammates, winger Andy Reid, signed for Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur on 31 January 2005 deadline day transfer for a fee thought to be worth a combined £8 million. Dawson made his debut for Tottenham towards the end of the 2004–05 season in the 2–2 draw at Liverpool on 16 April 2005.\n\nDawson enjoyed a good 2005–06 season, impressing many with his aerial ability and attitude. This in turn led to a contract extension until 2011. This was followed by a call-up to the England squad as a standby player for the 2006 FIFA World Cup.\n\nOn 5 November 2006, Dawson scored his first goal for Tottenham in their 2–1 win over Chelsea at White Hart Lane. His goal levelled the score at 1–1 after Claude Makélélé's strike, with Aaron Lennon scoring the winner. Dawson first captained the team in the 2006–07 FA Cup quarter-final match away to Chelsea, due to injuries to stand-in captains Robbie Keane and Paul Robinson and the club's regular captain Ledley King. After a season in which he played all but one of Tottenham's 59 matches, he was rewarded with a new five-year contract on 11 May 2007 which would have kept him at the club until 2012.\n\nIn the 2007–08 season, Dawson scored his first goal in the UEFA Cup home match against the Greek team Anorthosis Famagusta where Tottenham won 6–1. In November 2007, Tottenham went away to West Ham United in the Premier League and drew 1–1, Dawson scored the away goal. During the course of the season, Tottenham reached the 2008 League Cup Final at Wembley Stadium, where they beat Chelsea 2–1 to earn Dawson his first ever silverware, though he missed the final through injury.\n\nIn October 2008, when Tottenham played away to Stoke, Vedran Ćorluka suffered an injury in the 77th minute. Dawson replaced him only to be sent off in injury time. In March 2009, Tottenham reached the League Cup final again and faced Manchester United. Dawson was available and was selected for the final which ended 0–0 after 90 minutes. However, Tottenham lost 4–1 on penalties. In April 2009, Dawson sustain an injury against Newcastle United which left him out for the rest of the 2008–09 season. The 2009–10 season was to be judged by many as Dawson's finest season in a Spurs shirt to date as he helped the club to a fourth-place finish, their highest league finish for 20 years and qualification for the 2010–11 UEFA Champions League.\n\nOn 27 January 2010, he signed a new five-year contract with Tottenham, taking him to 2015. Dawson's excellent performances throughout the course of the season saw him awarded Tottenham's Player of the Year award. His form that season led to Manchester City striker Carlos Tevez calling him \"the best English defender I have played against\" due to his strength. Dawson missed the rest of the 2011–12 season after rupturing an ankle ligament during Tottenham's 3–1 FA Cup fifth round win over Stevenage on 7 March 2012.\n\nAt the beginning of the 2012–13 season, Dawson could have signed for Tottenham's Premier League rivals Queens Park Rangers as the two clubs had agreed a £7.5 million fee, but the move collapsed as Dawson had \"an issue with personal terms\". Instead, Dawson was appointed club captain and signed a new three-year contract with Tottenham in October 2013. He scored his first goal of the season in a 3–1 win over Reading at White Hart Lane on 1 January 2013.\n\nOn 26 August 2014, he joined Premier League club Hull City on a three-year contract for an undisclosed fee understood to be £3.5 million. He made his debut on 31 August 2014 at Villa Park in a 2–1 defeat to Aston Villa. During the course of the 2014–15 season, Dawson established himself in the team and was selected captain on 17 occasions. With five matches left to go in the Premier League season, Hull played Liverpool, in which Dawson scored his first goal for the club and the only goal in the match, earning a vital three points in their fight against relegation. However, this was not enough as Hull went on to lose their next three matches and in their final match against Manchester United they only drew 0–0, sending Dawson and Hull to the Championship for next season.\n\nDawson scored in their home match against Queens Park Rangers on 2 October 2016. The 2015–16 season saw Hull finish fourth in the table and were promoted back to the Premier League via the play-offs, beating Sheffield Wednesday 1–0 at Wembley Stadium in the final.\n\nAt the start of the 2016–17 season, Dawson picked up an injury in a pre-season friendly against Mansfield Town, which ruled him out for three months.\n\nAt the end of the 2017–18 season, he entered into discussions with Hull about a new contract.\n\nDawson re-signed for Championship club Nottingham Forest on 30 May 2018 on a two-year contract.\n\nDawson made his debut for the English under-21 team against Italy on 11 February 2003. He went on to earn 13 England under-21 international caps, captaining the team on several occasions. His last appearance for the under-21 team was in a 2–1 loss to France on 15 November 2005.\n\nDawson was capped twice for the English B team, his first cap coming in their 2–1 loss to Belarus at Reading's Madejski Stadium on 25 May 2006. His second cap came in their 3–1 win over Albania at Burnley's Turf Moor ground exactly a year later.\n\nDawson was named in England's 30-man provisional squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, but was not selected for the final 23-man squad. Rio Ferdinand was withdrawn from the squad due to an injury sustained in the team's first training session, and Capello announced Dawson as Ferdinand's replacement. He made his first appearance for England in a warm-up match against the Platinum Stars; however, the match was not counted as a full international, merely a training match, so he did not receive a cap for his appearance. However, Capello did not use Dawson at the World Cup, and he was the only uncapped member of the squad.\n\nHe made his full international debut in a friendly against Hungary on 11 August 2010, coming on as a half time substitute and was involved in a controversy over Hungary's goal. After making a mistake in the build-up, he got back to clear the ball off the line – a goal was given, however replays suggested the ball had actually not crossed the line.\n\nOn 3 September 2010, Dawson made his first competitive start for England in the UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying match against Bulgaria. He sustained a knee injury and left the field on a stretcher after 56 minutes.\n\nTottenham Hotspur\n\nHull City\n\nIndividual\n\n"}

Cursive script is faster to write than other styles, but difficult to read for those unfamiliar with it. It functions primarily as a kind of shorthand script or calligraphic style. People who can read standard or printed forms of Chinese or related scripts may not be able to comprehend this script.\n\nThe character () means script in this context (it can also mean \"book\"), and the character () means quick, rough or sloppy. Thus, the name of this script is literally \"rough script\" or \"sloppy script\". The same character () appears in this sense in the noun \"rough draft\" (, ), and the verb \"to draft [a document or plan]\" (, ). The other indirectly related meaning of the character () is grass, which has led to the mistranslation \"grass script\".\n\nCursive script originated in China during the Han dynasty through the Jin period, in two phases. First, an early form of cursive developed as a cursory way to write the popular and not-yet-mature clerical script. Faster ways to write characters developed through four mechanisms: omitting part of a graph, merging strokes together, replacing portions with abbreviated forms (such as one stroke to replace four dots), or modifying stroke styles. This evolution can best be seen on extant bamboo and wooden slats from the period, on which the use of early cursive and immature clerical forms is intermingled. This early form of cursive script, based on clerical script, is now called (), and variously also termed ancient cursive, draft cursive or clerical cursive in English, to differentiate it from modern cursive ( ). Modern cursive evolved from this older cursive in the Wei Kingdom to Jin dynasty with influence from the semi-cursive and standard styles.\n\nBeside and the \"modern cursive\", there is the \"wild cursive\" () which is even more cursive and difficult to read. When it was developed by Zhang Xu and Huaisu in the Tang dynasty, they were called (crazy Zhang and drunk Su, 顛張醉素). Cursive, in this style, is no longer significant in legibility but rather in artistry.\n\nCursive scripts can be divided into the unconnected style () where each character is separate, and the connected style () where each character is connected to the succeeding one.\n\nMany of the simplified Chinese characters are modeled on the printed forms of the cursive forms of the corresponding characters ().\n\nCursive script forms of Chinese characters are also the origin of the Japanese hiragana script. Specifically, the hiragana characters developed from cursive forms of the man'yōgana script, called . In Japan, the cursive script was considered to be suitable for women's writing, and thus came to be referred to as . This term was later applied to hiragana, as well. In contrast, kanji themselves were referred to as .\n\n\n\n"}

It was created in 1999 through the merger of The Monster Board (TMB) and Online Career Center (OCC). It is a subsidiary of Randstad Holding, a Dutch multinational human resource consulting firm, and is headquartered in Weston, Massachusetts.\n\nJeff Taylor contracted Christopher Caldwell of Net Daemons Associates to develop a facility in an NDA lab on a Sun Microsystems SPARCstation 5 where job seekers could search a job database with a web browser. The machine was moved to sit under a router in a phone closet in Adion (a human resources company owned by Taylor) when the site went live in April 1994.\n\nInitially, the site was populated with job descriptions from the newspaper segment of Adion's business with the permissions of the companies advertising the jobs.\n\nLater, in 1996, The Monster Board issued a press release that was picked up and provided needed exposure to drive people to the web site. Monster was the first public job search website on the Internet; first public resume database in the world and the first to have job search agents or job alerts.\n\nWhen TMP acquired Adion, the site was moved into BBN Planet's web hosting facility where it grew from three SPARCserver 1000s to become the centerpiece of the globally distributed network it is today.\n\nTMP went public in December 1996, with its shares traded on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol “TMPW”. In 1998, TMP acquisitions expanded the Recruitment Advertising network. TMP became one of the largest recruitment advertising agencies in the world.\n\nIn June 1998, The Monster Board moved its corporate headquarters out of a small office above a Chinese restaurant in downtown Framingham, Massachusetts, to an old textile mill in Maynard, Massachusetts, that formerly housed Digital Equipment Corporation.\n\nIn January 1999, The Monster Board became known as Monster.com after merging with Online Career Center, another of TMP Worldwide's properties. The first post-merger president of the new Monster.com business was Bill Warren, the founder of Online Career Center.\n\nIn November 2000, seeking to attract additional job market levels, Monster bought JOBTRAK because it was used at thousands of heterogeneous college and university campuses.

A call (buy) option with a lower strike price is more valuable because it's less expensive to exercise, while the inverse is true for a put (sell) option. The practice is not necessarily illegal but must be disclosed to shareholders. In July 2006, the company said it might restate financial results for the year that ended December 31, 2005, and previous years to record additional noncash charges for stock-based compensation expenses relating to various stock option grants.\n\nIn September 2006, Monster suspended Myron Olesnyckyj pending the internal review irregular stock option grants. He had held the titles of senior vice president, general counsel, and secretary.\n\nOn October 9, 2006, Monster named William M. Pastore, 58, chief executive after Andrew J. McKelvey resigned his posts as chairman and chief executive. McKelvey retained his seat on the board as chairman emeritus. The company said on October 25 that it found pricing problems in a \"substantial number\" of its past option grants and, as a result, it expected to restate its results from 1997 through 2005.\n\nOn November 22, 2006, Monster terminated Myron Olesnyckyj, the company's lead lawyer, as part of its investigation into past stock-option grant practices. In a statement, the company said Olesnyckyj was terminated \"for cause.\"\n\nThe U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York issued a subpoena to the company over options backdating, and a special committee of company directors planned to complete its own investigation by the end of the year. The company delayed filing its earnings results for the second and third quarters for 2006. Second-quarter results were expected December 13. Third-quarter numbers were to be issued \"as soon as practicable,\" according to a November 7 statement from the company.\n\nIn 2006, Monster Worldwide, Inc. received a notice from Nasdaq about a possible delisting of its shares due to the company's failure to file its third-quarter earnings report. The delisting did not happen.\n\n"}

Though her family wields great influence in Springfield, they have their share of enemies which is arguably justified given her father, uncle and grandfather's misdeeds. Lizzie has also involved herself in a great amount of trouble in her young life leading her to have periods of mental disturbance like her father.\n\nThe first-born child of Phillip Spaulding and Beth Raines, Lizzie has a younger brother, James Lemay Spaulding. She also has two younger paternal half-siblings, Alan Cooper \"Zach\" Spaulding and Emma Spencer-Spaulding. Lizzie also has a sister/Aunt born to Beth and Alan named Peyton Alexandra Raines. A comment by Alan stated that Beth named the child \"after that quarterback,\" a reference to NFL quarterback Peyton Manning. Lizzie has had numerous stepparents in her life. Her stepfather, Jim Lemay, was killed in a fire during Christmas when she was a child after saving her and James' lives. Lizzie was also once close to her former stepmother, Harley Cooper Aitoro (now her aunt), and her former stepsister, Daisy Lemay. She has a daughter, Sarah, with Jonathan, and is currently married to Bill Lewis. The show's finale showed Lizzie asking Sarah to touch her belly, as Lizzie was shown pregnant with Bill's son.\n\nLizzie (Hayden Panettiere) accidentally killed Carl Stevens in early 1998 when she saw him threatening her mother, Beth, with a gun. The gun fell, and Lizzie picked it up and fatally shot Carl. She suffered nightmares and hallucinations and finally had a breakdown upon being questioned by her father after being stopped from fleeing the country with her mother, who was determined to keep Lizzie's involvement in Carl's death a secret. She was sent to camp for therapy and returned somewhat better adjusted.\n\nIn 1999, she was kidnapped by the Nursery Rhyme Stalker and was saved by Alan's old lover, Annie Dutton (also an escaped convict at the time). She befriended her rescuer and ran away with her when Lizzie overheard her father speaking of getting rid of Annie and took it literally. Though she was reassured by the latter that Phillip wasn't planning to kill her, the woman guessed that he was making plans to send her back to prison and made plans to run away. Lizzie begged Annie to take her along, as she felt neglected by her mother, and she agreed. Lizzie was later saved by her grandfather and his then wife, India von Halkein. Upon her return to Springfield, Phillip and Beth vowed to their daughter that they would never make her feel unwanted again when she told her mother that she thought Beth wouldn't miss her if she was gone. Lizzie was devastated, though, when she learned that Annie was gone.\n\n2000 wasn't an easy year for Lizzie either when she was diagnosed with leukemia after being in a car accident with her stepsister, Daisy Lemay. Though Daisy had witnessed signs of sickness in Lizzie before the accident, the latter swore her to secrecy as she wanted to witness her mother marrying Daisy's father, Jim Lemay. Lizzie finally went into remission when she underwent a successful bone marrow transplant thanks to her new baby brother, James. Alan later revealed to her that the baby was Phillip's and not Jim's. When she heard her mother and stepfather making plans to leave Springfield, Lizzie (MacKenzie Mauzy) feigned sickness again but her godfather, Rick Bauer called her out and she confessed. Tragedy struck again later in the year when Jim died in a fire after saving Lizzie and James a few days before Christmas.\n\nIn 2003, after dealing with issues involving her grandfather's faked heart attack and helping Marina Cooper frame her uncle Gus Aitoro, Lizzie (Allison Hirschlag) pleaded with Beth and Phillip to let her go away to boarding school and they reluctantly agreed.\n\nShe soon developed a crush on Shayne Lewis.\n\nDistraught over her family's mistrust, Lizzie confided in Alan that she was only trying to be a good Spaulding by manipulating events to get what she wanted. She also finally admitted to Christopher that she needed help and she wanted to get back to being that happy girl she used to be.\n\nLater, Lizzie admitted to Phillip that, despite how she had thought she'd feel, she loved Emma.\n\nLizzie developed a crush on Joey Lupo who was in a relationship with Tammy. She succeeded in breaking them up, and admitted to Joey that she loved him.\n\nAfter overhearing a conversation between Buzz and Coop, Lizzie learned that Coop had been accepted to study at Oxford. She is heartbroken at the prospect of losing him, Lizzie made a secret phone call, fully determined to move ahead with the wedding. She then asked Coop to meet her since she’d planned a trip for them to Cancun. Coop was thrilled, unaware that Lizzie planned to bring him to the altar instead. Although Alex uncovered Lizzie’s plot, she ultimately gave Lizzie her blessing when Lizzie made it clear she was doing it all for love. To her chagrin, Coop didn’t show up at the airport on time, leading Lizzie to think he’d backed out. Finally, an injured Coop did arrive. Learning that Coop had a strange accident while he was working on his car (tires fell on him and he knocked over a gas pipe), Lizzie was sure that Beth and Alan were to blame for trying to keep Coop away from her. Later, Coop found out Lizzie was planning a wedding and confronted her. Lizzie apologized but reminded Coop he kept a secret from her too about his offer at Oxford. Coop apologized and they both resolve to trust each other more. Coop then decided to remain in Springfield rather than go to Oxford. Later, Lizzie received word that Alan was at the hospital and confronted him about sending someone after Coop. Realizing she needed to play hard ball, Lizzie had Beth’s plane rerouted so that she’d miss the Spaulding board meeting in which a new CEO was being elected. Without Beth to intervene a surprising new CEO was elected—Harley! Meanwhile, unable to answer to a boss, Lizzie quit her new job at the television station, but Coop stood up for her when Beth tried to stir up trouble between them. Later, a grateful Lizzie promised she’d find a way to solve their cash-flow problem.\n\nThe money, however, came with a price: Lizzie. Though she loved Coop, Lizzie was desperate for the money and began a secret affair with Quinn.\n\nAfter her breakup with Coop, Lizzie found comfort in a drunken one-night stand with Jonathan Randall, who had also been ousted by his lover Tammy Winslow. Weeks later, Lizzie would find herself pregnant with Jonathan's child. Unsure if it belonged to him or Coop, Lizzie decided to make sure everyone believed the child to be Coop's, and schemed to cover up her night with Jonathan.\n\nJonathan pieced the truth together, and at first did nothing. However, he refused to let Lizzie marry Coop, and announced at her wedding that the child was his. A scared Lizzie convinced Coop that Jonathan had raped her, and she had been too embarrassed to tell anyone. Coop believed her at first, but when everyone saw Jonathan's sweet, concerned, and uncharacteristic treatment over a weak Lizzie, her story was proved false.\n\nNow alone, Lizzie formed a bond with Jonathan and his girlfriend Tammy. The three decided to get through the pregnancy as a team, and not let her grandfather Alan control her baby. The three got along fine, but secretly Lizzie was beginning in to fall in love with her baby's father. She began to act on it in little ways, but convinced herself a relationship with him was not possible, due to his immense feelings for Tammy. Things went well, until Alan rigged a trial to have Lizzie sent to Ravenwood for being mentally incompetent. In a rash decision, Jonathan proposed to Lizzie while she was on the witness stand, in a show of good faith to the judge that the two of them would make a loving home for their child.\n\nThe two married with Tammy’s blessing (as the marriage was intended to be just for show). Lizzie's feelings for Jon were re-ignited, and she schemed to be with him, making the logical claim that is Jonathan and Tammy were in fact 'meant to be' then she wouldn't be able to split them up. He continued to see Tammy though, to the point where he missed an important baby appointment, and returned home to find Lizzie passed out and bleeding. She was diagnosed with pre-eclampsia, and a guilty Jonathan ended his relationship with Tammy in order to try to be there for his wife and child for real.\n\nTammy was present for the baby's birth though, as Jonathan delivered his and Lizzie's daughter in a car, on the side of a snowy road. The pair named her Sarah, in memory of Reva’s mother.\n\nWanting to be real family with her daughter and husband, Lizzie tried her best to be the ideal wife. She was crushed to find Jonathan still cheating with Tammy though, even after their daughter’s birth. Lizzie schemed to keep her marriage afloat, and even faked post-partum depression to make Jonathan pay her attention, and stay with her. He went back to Tammy though, and a distraught Lizzie sought help from Father Ray. She left Sarah in the car while she went into the church (still trying to keep up her depression hoax) The car was stolen with Sarah inside, and Lizzie was blamed. Jon railed against her, and planned to take his daughter from her, to avoid the damage he thought she could do.\n\nIn a lapse of judgment, Lizzie begged her granddad to help her keep her the daughter she loved. This proved the wrong move though, and in an attempt to kill Jonathan, Tammy was instead killed. Jonathan faked his and Sarah’s death in a staged car crash, and didn't let Lizzie in on the secret. She was left to think her daughter was dead, and that it was all her fault.\n\nAfter losing the thing that meant most to her in her daughter Sarah, being alienated by her mother, ostracized by her grandfather, and being duped (unknowingly) by Reva, Lizzie had hit rock bottom.\n\nIn an act of self-declaration and rebellion, she bought a bar. In this bar, looking for any sort of human affection, Lizzie shamelessly flirted with Jake, a rough looking bar fly (who bore similar style to her ex-husband Jonathan). She almost let things get too far with him, but Billy Lewis stepped in, and though she didn’t want to be saved, he saved her from herself. Thus began an awkward, yet moving friendship.\n\nThe two helped each other a lot, and became very close. Lizzie kept his secret about being off the wagon again, and Billy offered her a high-level job at Lewis Construction, putting faith in her and taking her under his wing like her grandfather would not.\n\nLizzie also began to form a friendship with a recovering Dinah Marler, who would become her roommate. Unaware of her summer kidnap of her, Lizzie also maintained a close-knit friendship with former mother-in-law Reva Shayne. Finally stable in an honest job, and surrounded by good people who cared about her, Lizzie began to flourish.\n\nThinking it’s what Billy needs in his life, and wanting to do good for him, Lizzie tracked down his son, Bill Lewis, and with Dinah’s help brought him back to town. In doing so, she gained a new roommate, as Bill had no immediate lodgings upon his return.\n\nAt first wary of his strange treatment of Billy, Lizzie was won over by Bill’s charm and sweet words, and the way he defended her to her grandfather. Unbeknownst to Lizzie, Bill was scheming to get her in bed in order to gain access to her information on an upcoming Lewis project, in order to slight his father. He succeeded, and stole the deal from her, making it impossible for his father not to re-hire him.\n\nFeeling betrayed and scorned, but still attracted to the man Bill had presented himself to be, Lizzie continued to interact with Bill, despite his several attempts to get his father to oust her from the business, and his life. She tried for a while to exact revenge, and even broke into his hotel room to find information on him. Their relationship would begin to go back and forth between moments of closeness, and antagonistic moments.\n\nIt became obvious that Lizzie was starting to develop deeper feelings for the Lewis heir. She was warned against this by everyone close to her, even his own father (and her confidant) Billy. Lizzie continued to be there for Bill though, and even bent over backwards trying to help him when he lost his eyesight in an explosion. Bill spurned her help though, and a crushed Lizzie turned to Reva for a shoulder to cry on. Lizzie began having severe stomach cramps, so Reva took her to Cedars, where the doctor speculated that Lizzie could be pregnant. Over zealous at the notion, Lizzie took this speculation as truth, and prepared herself to be a mother again. Bill was less than excited when she told him, but Lizzie let him know that he was not going to ruin this for her. She saw it as a second chance, a gleam of hope, and he could be in the child’s life or not. He expressed doubt about wanting to be with her and the child, and Lizzie stormed out. At Cedars, she meekly told Billy she was carrying his grandchild. An over-joyed Billy proceeded to lift her from the ground in excitement. He promised her Bill would come around, and the three would make a beautiful family. He went to see Bill and let him know that this could be his wake-up call to be a better person, and also hinted that this was Bill’s chance to one-up by being a better father and husband than he himself had been.\n\nAfter several negative pregnancy tests, Lizzie was distraught to find her miracle baby was not real. A heavyhearted Lizzie attended Tammy’s memorial service alone. An apologetic Bill tried to caress and comfort Lizzie, but she was still upset with him, and tried to just bluntly tell him there was no baby. Before she could get it out though, Bill began an impassioned speech about how he wanted to be a family with her and the child, whom he now felt was a gift from God, and a second chance for them both. Lizzie was unsure, and seemed to think about coming clean, but Bill’s instance that he wanted to be with her forced her to keep her secret.\n\nAfter thinking she saw Sarah in the church parking lot, Lizzie was convinced this child with Bill as something she needed to stay sane. So she asked Bill to go away with her to the Bauer Cabin, where she planned to seduce him to become pregnant. After finding a bear in the cabin though, and feeling guilty about the sweet side Bill was showing her now that he thought she was having his baby, Lizzie broke down and ran from the cabin. Bill chased her, and as they struggled on a hilltop, Lizzie told him she was not pregnant. A confused Bill tried to clutch her to him, but Lizzie stumbled and came close to falling into traffic. She was saved by her former husband Jonathan though, and thus she found out he was still alive.\n\nThough he lied to her at first, Lizzie soon sound Sarah also lived, and started building a relationship with her baby again. She and Jonathan even tried to work things out, and get married again, but her attraction to Bill, and her realization that Jonathan could never love her like he loved Tammy prevented her from marrying him. Not wanting her daughter to grow in a loveless marriage, she fled the ceremony, and reconciled with Bill. Things went sour for her and Jonathan after that, and he even kidnapped her briefly. Lizzie thought him a danger, and tried to take Sarah after this. On top of their entire drama, Alan was still trying to interfere and hurt Jon, while taking Sarah.\n\nMaking the hardest decision of her life, Lizzie kissed Sarah good-bye, and allowed Jonathan to flee with her, in hopes of saving her from the fate of growing up in the cold, lonely, loveless Spaulding home like she herself had. She could not go with them, for in exchange for Sarah’s freedom, Lizzie had offered herself for her grandfather to control.\n\nBill Lewis was having none of that however, and eventually rescued her from Alan’s clutches, through a plot his sister Dinah had set into motion. Still angry with Bill for his lack of commitment to her, and his continued sexual relationship with Ava Peralta, Lizzie railed against him. Bill won her back over though, and the two made love. In the after glow, Lizzie worried aloud that Bill would grow tired of her, and end their relationship. He surprised her by asking her to move in with him, and she gleefully accepted.\n\nAs he promised, Bill made sure Alan would not go after Sarah. He assured Lizzie that her home was now with him, and that though he had tried to fight the hold she had on him, he refused to lose her ever again.\n\nLizzie's bliss, as usual, was short lived. She soon found that Bill was involved in a plot with his sister Dinah to bring down the Spauldings. Bill tried to tell her it was just business, and that he had fallen in love with her, but she forced him to choose between her and the company, and when he couldn't make a clear decision, she left him.\n\nAfter Lizzie was found by Bill after her kidnapping by Dinah Marler and Grady Foley, Bill fell into a coma and Lizzie sat vigil by his side. Unaware of who her kidnapper was, Lizzie turn to Cyrus Foley to clear Bill's name (unaware that Cyrus had helped Grady cover up his role in her kidnapping). When Bill awoke from his coma with no memory of whether he had played a part in her kidnapping, he was pushed away by Lizzie, who turned to Cyrus for comfort. Bill went in search of Lizzie's father, Phillip, for help, but he missed him at the cabin and saw a photo of Lizzie with her father. He went outside to look for Phillip, fell, and hit his head; when he awoke, he saw his father, Billy, and recovered his memory, realizing both Grady and Cyrus's roles in Lizzie's kidnapping (but unaware that Dinah had also played a part). Bill confronted Grady and was later abducted by him and Cyrus to keep him quiet; Cyrus, however, started feeling guilty and was going to take Lizzie to Bill when Bill showed up and told her the truth.\n\nLizzie's father returned, arriving after spotting Coop (who just had a bad car crash) and rushed him to Cedars' Hospital, went to the church to tell Beth, just as Beth was about to remarry Alan. He first saw daughter Lizzie when she went to see Coops' car after learning of his accident. Lizzie was afraid and angry at her father, never recovering from his previous attempt to kidnap her, sister Emma, her brothers (James and Zach) and Jude Bauer. She rejected all attempts at reconciling and had him arrested for her kidnapping.\n\n\n"}

The screwed technique is accomplished by slowing the tempo down to 60 and 70 quarter-note beats per minute and applying techniques such as skipping beats, record scratching, stop-time, and affecting portions of the original composition to create a \"chopped-up\" version of the song. \n\nPreceding the late 1990s, most Southern hip hop was upbeat and fast, like Miami bass, which was inspired by Afrika Bambaataa & the Soulsonic Force with their groundbreaking track \"Planet Rock\". Unlike its southern musical counterparts Houston's rap style has consistently remained slower, even in the beginning of Houston hip-hop, as can be heard on the earliest Houston based group Geto Boys records from the mid to late 80's.\n\nIt is unknown when DJ Screw definitively created \"screwed and chopped\" music, but his first manager Charles Washington, was quoted in an 2001 interview with Texas Monthly stating that 'Screw mistakenly created the sound while hanging out with friends at an apartment in the late 80s.' Screw discovered that dramatically reducing the pitch of a record gave a mellow, heavy sound that emphasized lyrics to the point of storytelling. Initially the slow paced hip hop genre was referred to as laid-back driving music and was limited to the South Side of Houston, until it was popularized by DJ Dinero and DJ Z-Nasty from Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\nBetween 1991 and 1992, there was a large increase in use of purple drank in Houston, which many believe contributed to the allure of screw music. Purple drank, which is commonly known as sizzurp, or lean is a street narcotic made from the prescription opioid codeine that treats mild pain and acts as a cough suppressant. The popular street beverage has been considered to be a major influence in the making of and listening to chopped and screwed music, due to its perceived effect of slowing the brain down, and giving the slow, mellow music its appeal. In an interview for the documentary film \"Soldiers United For Cash\" DJ Screw, denounced the claim that one has to use purple drank to enjoy screwed and chopped music. In the documentary Screw is quoted as saying “People think just to listen to my tapes you gotta be high or dranked out. That ain’t true. There’s kids getting my tapes, moms and dads getting my tapes, don’t smoke or drink or nothing.\" \n\nIn the mid-1990s, chopped and screwed music started to move to the north side of Houston by way of DJ Michael \"5000\" Watts, and later OG RON C. It wasn't long until a rivalry between north and south Houston started over who were the \"originators\" and who were the \"adopters\". Michael \"5000\" Watts always gave credit to DJ Screw as the originator of chopped and screwed music, although Watts has been a proponent of the slogan \"screwed and chopped\" instead of \"chopped and screwed\". In the late 1990s, with the help of P2P networks such as Napster, chopped and screwed music spread to a much wider audience.\n\nOn November 16, 2000, DJ Screw was found dead in the bathroom of his music studio. The autopsy report later revealed that Screw died from a lethal combination of codeine, marijuana and alcohol.\n\nFollowing the death of DJ Screw, his musical influence spread all over the southern United States. Later in 2000, the Memphis based group Three 6 Mafia came out with their song \"Sippin' on Some Syrup\". The song debuted as a minor hit but later became one of Three 6 Mafia's most popular songs.\n\nIn 2011, University of Houston Libraries acquired over 1,000 albums owned by DJ Screw. Some of the albums were part of an exhibit in early 2012 and, along with the rest, went available for research in 2013.\n\nAs of to date, the chopped and screwed music genre has been added to all forms of streaming services including Itunes, Spotify and has crossed over to receive mass mainstream appeal.\n\nChopped and screwed music was created by DJ Screw in the early 1990s. Part of the chopped & screwed music scene is a beverage known as purple drank (the active ingredients being codeine and promethazine); the color purple, which is usually present as a dye in the \"drank,\" has also become a symbolic color or motif to identify chopped and screwed versions of songs or whole albums. The 2007 documentary film \"Screwed In Houston\" produced by VBS/Vice Magazine details the history of the Houston rap scene and the influence of the chopped and screwed subculture on Houston hip-hop.\n\n"}

The concept of a nuclear cross section can be quantified physically in terms of \"characteristic area\" where a larger area means a larger probability of interaction. The standard unit for measuring a nuclear cross section (denoted as σ) is the barn, which is equal to 10 m² or 10 cm². Cross sections can be measured for all possible interaction processes together, in which case they are called total cross sections, or for specific processes, distinguishing elastic scattering and inelastic scattering; of the latter, amongst neutron cross sections the absorption cross sections are of particular interest.\n\nIn nuclear physics it is conventional to consider the impinging particles as point particles having negligible diameter. Cross sections can be computed for any sort of process, such as capture scattering, production of neutrons, etc. In many cases, the number of particles emitted or scattered in nuclear processes is not measured directly; one merely measures the attenuation produced in a parallel beam of incident particles by the interposition of a known thickness of a particular material. The cross section obtained in this way is called the total cross section and is usually denoted by a σ or σ.\n\nTypical nuclear radii are of the order 10 m. Assuming spherical shape, we therefore expect the cross sections for nuclear reactions to be of the order of π\"r\" ² or 10 m² (i.e. 1 barn). Observed cross sections vary enormously - for example, slow neutrons absorbed by the (n, formula_1) reaction show a cross section much higher than 1,000 barns in some cases (boron-10, cadmium-113, and xenon-135), while the cross sections for transmutations by gamma-ray absorption are in the region of 0.001 barn.\n\nNuclear cross sections are used in determining the nuclear reaction rate, and are governed by the reaction rate equation for a particular set of particles (usually viewed as a \"beam and target\" thought experiment where one particle or nucleus is the \"target\" [typically at rest] and the other is treated as a \"beam\" [projectile with a given energy]).\n\nFor neutron interactions incident upon a thin sheet of material (ideally made of a single type of isotope), the nuclear reaction rate equation is written as:\n\nwhere:\n\nTypes of reactions frequently encountered are \"s\": scattering, formula_1: radiative capture, \"a\": absorption (radiative capture belongs to this type), \"f\": fission, the corresponding notation for cross-sections being: formula_10, formula_11, formula_12, etc. A special case is the total cross-section formula_13, which gives the probability of a neutron to undergo any sort of reaction (formula_14).\n\nFormally, the equation above \"defines\" the macroscopic neutron cross-section (for reaction x) as the proportionality constant between a neutron flux incident on a (thin) piece of material and the number of reactions that occur (per unit volume) in that material. The distinction between macroscopic and microscopic cross-section is that the former is a property of a specific lump of material (with its density), while the latter is an intrinsic property of a type of nuclei.\n\n\n"}

There are variations on types of scrim, depending upon its use, whether with natural light, or with man-made light sources. However, their basic use is the same – to reduce intensity and/or harshness of light.\n\nFilm and TV productions typically use constant lighting in the studio and on location. Some types of bulbs cannot be electrically dimmed because of their design, and incandescent bulbs will progressively change in colour temperature, becoming more orange, as they are dimmed.\n\nScrims in this context are considered to be a “colour safe” alternative to electrically dimming lights, and are a fine wire mesh available in different strengths, placed directly in front of the light.\n\nA half scrim, as implied by its name, only has the mesh halfway across, which will allow the full intensity of light to fall on part of a scene. A graduated scrim varies the intensity of light from across it.\n\nA scrim can also be a translucent gauze type material that may be fastened onto a frame, and used outdoors to reduce the intensity of, and soften harsh light on subjects/people being filmed or photographed. They are available in a multitude of shapes and sizes, either small enough to be held in one hand by a photographer or assistant, up to almost tent like contraptions.\n\nIn this context, a scrim can be used when harsh midday sun would otherwise cause people to squint, or “blown out” hotspots on people's skin, such as cheeks, foreheads and shoulders. The scrim is placed close to the subject, diffusing and reducing the intensity of light, which is much more flattering, especially for portraits.\n\nA scrim can be used indoors on a soundstage. For example, a set may be built on a soundstage to include both the interior and exterior of a wall with a window, thereby enabling characters inside to see characters on what appears to be a patio or walkway outside. The portion of the set that appears to be \"outside\" may have to be brightly lit to simulate sunlight. A scrim is then attached to a frame overhanging the entire \"outdoor\" portion of the set between the lighting and the actors, in order to diffuse the light so that it appears more natural when it hits the actors' faces.\n\nScrims are also used as drapery in theatre and performance art. When lit from the front they appear as a solid piece of fabric. When lit from the rear they become semi transparent, creating a silhouette effect.\n\nScrims can be semi-transparent or wholly transparent depending on the fabric used and the lighting. They can be painted or not. They only create a 'silhouette effect' when designed to do so.\n\n"}

The signals were broadcast beginning in August 1977 on WWHT-TV (channel 68) and later on WSNL-TV (channel 67) out of Smithtown, New York.\n\nInitially subscribers paid $15 for a set-top descrambling box that allowed subscribers to view channel 68's scrambled television signals (a later addressable, 2-channel version of this descrambler was developed under vice president of engineering, Alex MacDonald). The service was similar to Home Box Office (HBO), but a Wometco executive told \"The New York Times\" that WHT was more likely to select films with a particular interest to the New York City area. Wometco also targeted areas that were not yet served by cable television (although parts of Manhattan had cable television service as early as 1971, the vast majority of the five boroughs of New York City would not begin receiving cable television service until 1988). \n\nProgramming consisted of 12 features a month, including movies and entertainment specials. In addition, select home games of the NHL's New York Islanders were broadcast live from the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum. Each program was repeated five times during the month. During the daytime, WWHT was a small commercial television station. The station was originally going to be a general entertainment station with shows that independents WNEW-TV (channel 5), WOR-TV (channel 9) and WPIX (channel 11) passed on. However, the costs were too high to acquire such programs so the station broadcast only a couple hours of low budget syndicated shows, \"The Uncle Floyd Show\", public affairs programs, religious programs, stock market reports, and minority-interest and foreign language programs. In 1980, WHT began programming a movie from 10:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. as well, later adding the adult-themed late night service, \"Nightcap\" with its black cat logo. \n\nIn the fall of 1980, Wometco Enterprises brought in a new management team. The team consisted of Harold Brownstein as the new president, and Robert Borders as vice president of marketing, both of whom had previously worked together at a major BTB direct marketing company. Having operated at $1 million plus loss for over four years, this team turned the operation profitable within 18 months. This was accomplished by consolidating numerous satellite offices/functions into the company's headquarters in Fairfield, New Jersey; producing a bi-monthly program guide (instead of monthly), significantly reducing printing and postage costs; and implementing direct response marketing concepts into the company's multimillion-dollar local television ads, so that the company could determine which markets and promotions generated sales, instead of just awareness.\n\nWHT also employed an MATV division in an effort to expand their viewership by partnering with the real estate community to provide the service to buildings and apartment complexes, using a facility's pre-existing master antenna system. \nIn the spring of 1983, WHT also began operating 20 hours a day (increasing its subscription rate to $21/month), with only two hours a day of religious and public affairs shows seen on WWHT. Uncle Floyd moved off Channel 68 and onto NJN. However, the station marketed WHT as 24 hours a day, and the two hours of religious and public affairs shows were positioned as part of WHT's lineup. This block of programming was also unscrambled. Also, another two hours of children's shows were marketed as part of WHT, but also unscrambled. It was at this time that Wometco Home Theater and Wometco Enterprises were sold to the private investment firm of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. \n\nBy 1984, Wometco Home Theater had ceased its own programming and began carrying programs from California-based pay television service SelecTV. Finally, after losing more and more subscribers over the next two years, WHT ceased operations in March 1986. WSNL and WWHT then switched to an all-music format named \"U68\", similar to MTV, which lasted for about 8 months before both stations were purchased by an affiliate company of the Home Shopping Network. The stations are now owned-and-operated station of the Spanish-language network UniMás.\n\nThis list is incomplete, please help by adding stations which carried WHT.\n"}

He served as national president of the Boy Scouts of America from 1998 to 2000. On September 1, 2010, Whitacre stepped down as CEO, and retired as chairman of the board by the end of 2010.\n\nWhitacre was born in Ennis, Texas. He graduated from Texas Tech University with a bachelor's degree in industrial engineering and is a member of the Delta Tau Delta fraternity.\n\nHe began his career with Southwestern Bell in 1963 as a facility engineer.\n\nIn October 1988, Whitacre became president and chief operating officer of a regional bell operating company, Southwestern Bell Corporation. Two years later, Whitacre became chairman of the board and chief executive officer. In 1995, Southwestern Bell Corporation changed its name to SBC Communications. Whitacre led SBC through a series of mergers and acquisitions in building the largest provider of both local long distance telephone services and wireless service (through its Cingular division) in the United States. These acquisitions included Pacific Telesis (1997), SNET (1998), Comcast Cellular (1999), Ameritech (1999) and AT&T Corporation (2005), from which the post-merger company took its name, as well as the 2006 acquisition of Bell South.\n\nOn June 23, 2006, he and the CEO of BellSouth were brought in under the Senate Antitrust Subcommittee following the AT&T-BellSouth merger. Whitacre was questioned regarding possible customer information leaks to the NSA in the interest of national security. There had been allegations by former AT&T technician Mark Klein that such work had been done in Room 641A of the San Francisco offices.\n\nWhitacre's compensation totaled $61 million in 2006, $17 million in 2005, and about $14 million in 2004.\n\nIn 2006, Whitacre famously declared that companies like Google, Yahoo! or Vonage should not be able to “use the pipes for free.” \n\nOn April 27, 2007, at the AT&T annual stockholders meeting, Whitacre announced his intent to retire as chief executive officer and chairman of the board, effective June 3. The board of directors elected Randall Stephenson to succeed Whitacre as new CEO and chairman. Whitacre retired on June 4, 2007, with Randall Stephenson taking over the following morning. Upon retirement, Whitacre was eligible for a $158 million payout from AT&T. Following retirement, under his employment contract, Whitacre was entitled to receive some continuing benefits, including automobile use, access to AT&T's corporate aircraft for up to ten hours per month, use of AT&T office facilities and support staff, home security, and club memberships, as well as payment of applicable taxes resulting from these benefits, except for use of the aircraft. In addition, Whitacre has a three-year consulting contract with AT&T for which he is paid about $1 million annually. It has been reported that during his tenure at AT&T, Whitacre offered Randall Stephenson three words of advice via text message when the executive change was announced: \"Give 'em hell\".\n\n\"BusinessWeek\" (1999) reported that, although the CEO of AT&T — amongst the largest and most influential names in telecommunications and its surrounding technology, Whitacre did not use e-mail or have a computer at his office.\n\nAs General Motors chairman and interim CEO, Whitacre does have a computer at his office and prefers to answer e-mail via BlackBerry.\n\nIn May 2008, Whitacre was elected to the board of directors for ExxonMobil.\n\nOn June 9, 2009, General Motors named Whitacre as chairman. He took the position when the automaker emerged from bankruptcy proceedings on July 10, 2009. On December 1, 2009, Whitacre became interim CEO following Fritz Henderson's resignation. Since taking the helms, he has been dubbed the GM Reaper by many in blogs, noted for his strong desire to \"kill off\" brands and projects, such as Saab and a sub-Volt Toyota Prius competitor planned for Chevrolet. In January 2010, chairman Whitacre was appointed permanent CEO after serving in the post in an interim capacity.

It induces proliferation and differentiation of early pluripotent stem cells and committed progenitors.\n\nInterleukin 3 is an interleukin, a type of biological signal (cytokine) that can improve the body's natural response to disease as part of the immune system. It acts by binding to the interleukin-3 receptor.\n\nInterleukin 3 stimulates the differentiation of multipotent hematopoietic stem cells into myeloid progenitor cells or, with the addition of IL-7, into lymphoid progenitor cells. In addition, IL-3 stimulates proliferation of all cells in the myeloid lineage (granulocytes, monocytes, and dendritic cells), in conjunction with other cytokines, e.g., Erythropoietin (EPO), Granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and IL-6. It is secreted by basophils and activated T cells to support growth and differentiation of T cells from the bone marrow in an immune response. Activated T cells can either induce their own proliferation and differentiation (autocrine signalling), or that of other T cells (paracrine signalling) – both involve IL-2 binding to the IL-2 receptor on T cells (upregulated upon cell activation, under the induction of macrophage-secreted IL-1). The human IL-3 gene encodes a protein 152 amino acids long, and the naturally occurring IL-3 is glycosylated. The human IL-3 gene is located on chromosome 5, only 9 kilobases from the GM-CSF gene, and its function is quite similar to GM-CSF.\n\nIL-3 is a T cell-derived, pluripotent and hematopoietic factor required for survival and proliferation of hematopoietic progenitor cells. The signal transmission is ensured by high affinity between cell surface interleukin-3 receptor and IL-3. This high affinity receptor contains α and β subunits. IL-3 shares the β subunit with IL-5 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). This β subunit sharing explains the biological functional similarities of different hematopoietic growth factors.\n\nIL-3/Receptor complex induces JAK2/STAT5 cell signalisation pathway. It can stimulate transcription factor c‑myc (activation of gene expression) and Ras pathway (suppression of apoptosis).\n\nInterleukin 3 was originally discovered in mice. He found a T cell derived factor that induced the synthesis of 20alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in hematopoietic cells and termed it interleukin-3.\n\nIn the early 1960s Ginsberg and Sachs discovered that IL-3 is a potent mast cell growth factor produced from activated T cells.\n\nIL-3 is produced by T cells only after stimulation with antigens or other specific impulses.\n\nHowever, it was observed that IL-3 is present in the myelomonocytic leukaemia cell line WEHI-3B. It is thought that this genetic change is the key in development of this leukemia type. \n\nHuman IL-3 was first cloned in 1986 and since then clinical trials are ongoing. Post-chemotherapy, IL-3 application reduces chemotherapy delays and promotes regeneration of granulocytes and platelets. However, only IL-3 treatment in bone marrow failure disorders such as myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and aplastic anemia (AA) was disappointing.\n\nIt has been shown that combination of IL-3, GM-CSF and stem cell factor enhances peripheral blood stem cells during high-dose chemotherapy.\n\nOther studies showed that IL-3 could be a future perspective therapeutic agent in lymphohematopoietic disorders and solid cancers.\n\nInterleukin 3 has been shown to interact with IL3RA.\n\n\n"}

Sometimes gimp is covered in beads or spangles.\n\nThe term \"gimp\" for a braided trim has been around since the 15th and 16th centuries, when gimp threads were braided into flat braids up to a quarter of an inch (7 mm) wide. The braids were sometimes made either with bobbins or needle and thread, which gave greater control over the threads. Gimp trim was then sewn down to form designs.\n\nThe name \"gimp\" has also been applied to the plastic thread used in the knotting and plaiting craft scoubidou.\n\nThe term gimp with reference to lace refers to the thread that is used to outline the pattern. This thread is normally thicker than that used to make the lace. It gives definition and slightly raises the edge of the design. A gimp thread is used widely in many laces, with notable exceptions being Binche lace and Valenciennes lace. \n\nThe terms \"gimp\" and \"cordonnet\" can, for the most part, be used interchangeably, as both are defined as the thread that forms the outline of the design. The term \"cordonnet\" is used particularly when the outline is padded and when the thread is completely on the surface of the lace. When the thread is made of more than one strand (as in Chantilly lace), it is also called a cordonnet. In machine-made laces the outlining thread is always called a cordonnet.\n"}

The classification was found in 1954 by A. Z. Petrov and independently by Felix Pirani in 1957.\n\nWe can think of a fourth rank tensor such as the Weyl tensor, \"evaluated at some event\", as acting on the space of bivectors at that event like a linear operator acting on a vector space:\n\nThen, it is natural to consider the problem of finding eigenvalues formula_2 and eigenvectors (which are now referred to as eigenbivectors) formula_3 such that\n\nIn (four-dimensional) Lorentzian spacetimes, there is a six-dimensional space of antisymmetric bivectors at each event. However, the symmetries of the Weyl tensor imply that any eigenbivectors must belong to a four-dimensional subset.\nThus, the Weyl tensor (at a given event) can in fact have \"at most four\" linearly independent eigenbivectors.\n\nJust as in the theory of the eigenvectors of an ordinary linear operator, the eigenbivectors of the Weyl tensor can occur with various multiplicities. Just as in the case of ordinary linear operators, any multiplicities among the eigenbivectors indicates a kind of \"algebraic symmetry\" of the Weyl tensor at the given event. Just as you would expect from the theory of the eigenvalues of an ordinary linear operator on a four-dimensional vector space, the different types of Weyl tensor (at a given event) can be determined by solving a characteristic equation, in this case a quartic equation.\n\nThese eigenbivectors are associated with certain null vectors in the original spacetime, which are called the principal null directions (at a given event).\nThe relevant multilinear algebra is somewhat involved (see the citations below), but the resulting classification theorem states that there are precisely six possible types of algebraic symmetry. These are known as the Petrov types:\n\n\nThe possible transitions between Petrov types are shown in the figure, which can also be interpreted as stating that some of the Petrov types are \"more special\" than others. For example, type I, the most general type, can \"degenerate\" to types II or D, while type II can degenerate to types III, N, or D.\n\nDifferent events in a given spacetime can have different Petrov types. A Weyl tensor that has type I (at some event) is called algebraically general; otherwise, it is called algebraically special (at that event). In General Relativity, type O spacetimes are conformally flat.\n\nThe Newman–Penrose formalism is often used in practice for the classification. Consider the following set of bivectors:\n\nThe Weyl tensor can be expressed as a combination of these bivectors through\n\nwhere the formula_9 are the Weyl scalars and c.c. is the complex conjugate.

If the Weyl tensor is \"algebraically special\" at some formula_18, there is a useful set of conditions, found by Lluis (or Louis) Bel and Robert Debever, for determining precisely the Petrov type at formula_19. Denoting the Weyl tensor components at formula_19 by formula_21 (assumed non-zero, i.e., not of type O), the Bel criteria may be stated as:\n\n\nwhere formula_25 is necessarily null and unique (up to scaling).\n\n\nwhere formula_25 is necessarily null and unique (up to scaling).\n\n\nwhere formula_25 is necessarily null and unique (up to scaling).\n\n\nand\n\nwhere <math> \"See chapters 4, 26\"\n"}

His father was member of the Carboneria in 1821, one of his brothers and a brother-in-law were deputies, while Carlo Cafiero was always considered the 'black sheep' of the family.\n\nIn 1864, he moved to Naples, where he got a degree in law. He then went to Florence to embark on a diplomatic career. Here, he first came into contact with atheist ideas, through the Rationalist movement. At the beginning of 1870 he was in Paris as guest of the painter Giuseppe De Nittis, a fellow townsman who described him as a \"beautiful young man, fascinating to women\". He then went to London, where he matured, renouncing his diplomatic career, wealth and family to join the revolution and socialism. It seems that hearing the enthralling rally of a shoemaker caused Cafiero to become conscious of the pitiful conditions of the working class. In London, Cafiero made contact with Marx and Engels.\n\nHe joined the International Workingmen's Association and was charged with winning Italy over to Marx's ideology, in a country where workers were under the strong influence of the Republicanism of Giuseppe Mazzini or in some places the Anarchism of Mikhail Bakunin. He re-formed the old branch of the International in Naples, with the help of the young Errico Malatesta. There, during an assembly, he was imprisoned for the first time.\n\nCafiero spent over a year in Italy as a representative of Marx and Engels to hinder the influence of anarchism. However, thanks to the contact he had had with Giuseppe Fanelli, he sided with Bakunin and his Italian followers. In early 1872 came the first issue of the newspaper \"La Campana\" and Cafiero wrote for, and donated for its publication. In the same year he met Bakunin in Locarno (Switzerland) spending a month with him, discussing Bakunin's ideas and objections to what Bakunin perceived as Marx and Engels’ authoritarianism, winning Cafiero in the end to his cause. In the summer of 1873, with the help of Cafiero, an old project was realised: to create an international center for the revolution in Italy and the world. Cafiero, selling all his inherited lands, bought a farm in Switzerland where Bakunin could live. This center was called \"La Baronata\", and it would also be a safe shelter for revolutionaries persecuted by their respective governments. In 1875 Cafiero went to Milan and joined the editorial staff of the first socialist daily paper, \"La Plebe\", edited by Enrico Bignami. In April 1877, Cafiero, Malatesta, Ceccarelli, the Russian Stepniak and 30 other comrades began an insurrection in the province of Benevento. They took the village of Letino without a struggle where they were greeted with great enthusiasm. Arms and expropriated goods were distributed amongst the people, tax money was returned and official documents destroyed. Cafiero, in dialect, explained the ideas of anarchism, freedom, justice and the new society without the State, without masters, servants, soldiers and owners. His proclamations even convinced the parish priest, who explained to his parishioners that the Internationalists were 'the true apostles sent by the Lord'. The following day the village of Gallo was taken in a similar fashion. Unfortunately, as they were leaving Gallo the Internationalists were surprised and surrounded by government troops and all were arrested. Held in prison for over a year before being brought to trial, all the accused were eventually acquitted in August 1878.\n\nDuring his imprisonment his contacts with the International never ceased and Cafiero wrote his best-known work: \"A Compendium of Das Kapital\", published in 1879 in Milan by the publishers of \"La Plebe\". The work was appreciated and praised by Karl Marx, the author of the original book, who found it superior to other similar works. The Compendium was written in order to bring the theory of \"Das Kapital\" to students, educated workmen and small proprietors. In 1878, Cafiero, unable to return to Italy because of Giovanni Passannante's attempt who brought a strong repression against republicans and internationalists, was living in Marseilles, working as a cook and docker. In October he was arrested along with Malatesta, then released and deported from France. He went to Switzerland, where he met Peter Kropotkin and, with the collaboration of Élisée Reclus, promoted the publication of the Bakunin's essay \"God and the State\". Andrea Costa, who had deserted the anarchist camp by passing over to legalitarian, parliamentary Socialism, disappointed Cafiero who described him as \"an apostate, a renegade of the revolutionary faith and the people\". After being arrested and soon released, in 1881 Cafiero went to London, where he remained for a long time. There he was the victim of a strange illness which was accompanied by feelings of persecution; he saw spies everywhere and was frightened by the telephone, which had just appeared in the world. In March 1882 he returned to Italy, expressing a will to take part in the imminent electoral campaign. On April 5, he was arrested without any charge, but on May 2, while imprisoned, he fell victim to a strong mental crisis and attempted to kill himself. The scandal of a crazed man, imprisoned without reason, exploded and Cafiero was released but given a choice of living in Barletta, his home town, or exile to Switzerland.\n\nEmaciated and feverish, he chose exile in Chiasso, where he again attempted suicide. Emilio Bellerio took Cafiero to his house in Locarno and Errico Malatesta wrote about him: \"though his mind is ill, his heart is still healthy...\". In February 1883 Cafiero left for Florence, where he was met by a friend. He immediately headed for Fiesole, took rooms in an inn but then immediately fled into the woods, where he was later found half-naked. After being aided by a doctor and the police he was transferred to the San Bonifacio psychiatric hospital in Florence. Olimpia Kutusoff, Cafiero's wife, returned from Russia in September 1883 to look after him at the Imola psychiatric hospital, where he had been transferred. Olimpia left him after one and a half years because Cafiero was violent with her during his moments of crisis. Carlo expressed the will to return to Barletta, where he arrived in the second half of ’89. However, his brothers turned him away but, after living some time in a hotel, he was taken in by his brother Pietrantonio. Cafiero's mental conditions improved, but one day, returning home, he saw a group of peasants eating a piece of black, hard bread which revived his revolutionary spirit and he entered his house screaming against his family. In 1891, following another crisis, Carlo Cafiero was confined in the psychiatric hospital in Nocera Inferiore, where he died on Sunday 17 July 1892 of tuberculosis at the age of 45.\n\n\n"}

The first building was completed in 1966. The school was expanded in 1978 with the addition of of classroom space.\n\nIn 1985, the State Board of Postsecondary Vocational Education was established. Schools were encouraged to join this network. In July 1988, Governor Joe Frank Harris elevated this Board to a Department, changing the name to the Department of Technical and Adult Education. Griffin Tech adopted the name Griffin Technical Institute and joined the system in July 1987.\n\nIn August 1990, Griffin Tech dedicated a new facility, a office, classroom and lecture hall addition. In the spring of 1995, the new Academic Building provided of additional classroom and office space. In September 1995, were acquired from the City of Griffin, and in February 1997, an additional vacated by the Georgia State Patrol Station was acquired providing an additional of classroom and office space.\n\nDuring the spring 1999 legislative session, funds were given for the planning phase of a addition. Construction was completed in 2004 and the facility includes classroom and lab space for ten new programs, office space and a conference room, an expanded library, and a large student break area with hot grill.\n\nIn March 2000, Governor Roy Barnes included a name change initiative in his \"A+ Education Reform Act of 2000\" (HB 1187). This act passed the Georgia General Assembly during the 2000 session, and went into effect on July 1, 2000. Until this legislation was approved, the institutions governed by the Board of Technical and Adult Education were prohibited from using the word \"college\" in their official names. The term \"technical college\" more accurately reflects the quality and levels of services provided by these institutions to the citizens of Georgia.\n\nOn July 6, 2000 at 3:30 p.m., Griffin Technical Institute officially became Griffin Technical College. Since then, additional campuses have been added in Jasper County and Butts County to increase the offerings at the college. In 2008, the State Board of the Technical College System of Georgia ordered that Griffin Technical College be merged with Flint River Technical College in an effort to consolidate technical colleges into larger schools and save funds and resources.\n\nIn January 2009, the joint boards of both colleges combined and selected the name of Southern Crescent Technical College as the new designation for the combined colleges and the satellite campuses in Butts County, Jasper County and Taylor County. Dr. Robert Arnold, President of Griffin Technical College was selected to head the new Southern Crescent Technical College, Mr. Michael Brewer, Chairman of Griffin Tech was elected as the new Chairman and Dr. Robert Patrick, Chairman of Flint River Tech was elected as Vice Chairman.\n\n"}

The final commercial model, the Stinson Reliant SR-10, was introduced in 1938. A militarized version was first flown in February 1942 and remained in production through several additional versions (all externally identical) until late 1943 for the US and British armed forces.\nReliant production can be broken into two distinct types – the straight-wing Reliants (all models up to SR-6) and the gull-wing Reliants (all models from SR-7 and after, including the militarized V-77/AT-19), with there being little in common between the two groups of types. The straight-wing Reliant has a wing of constant chord and thickness which is supported by two struts each side with additional bracing struts. In contrast the taper-wing Reliant has the broadest chord and thickness of the wing at mid-span, with the outer wing trailing edge heavily angled forward and a rounded cutout on the leading edge root, all supported by a single strut. The taper wing has a significant step up between the fuselage and the wing, and the changes in wing thickness gave it a distinct gull appearance from the front.\n\nThe Reliant was used by the United States Army Air Forces in World War II as a utility aircraft, designated UC-81, and as trainer designated AT-19. The Royal Navy and Royal Air Force also used Reliants, for light transport and communication duties. After the war they were sold on the civilian market as the Vultee V-77.\n\nThe V-77 is a spartan version of the SR-10 with the 300 hp Lycoming R680-E3B, a single door on the left side and the traditional \"bump\" cowl was replaced with a simpler smooth cowl. Internal structure was beefed up significantly over the commercial models, and a distinctive triangle-shaped counterbalance was added to the rudder.\n\nThe SR-10 Reliant was available as a landplane, seaplane and skidplane in the following configurations:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2045465", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2045465", "title": "Trafficking of children", "text": "Trafficking of children\n\nTrafficking of children is a form of human trafficking and is defined as the \"recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring, and/or receipt\" kidnapping of a child for the purpose of slavery, forced labor and exploitation. This definition is substantially wider than the same document's definition of \"trafficking in persons\". Children may also be trafficked for the purpose of adoption.\n\nThough statistics regarding the magnitude of child trafficking are difficult to obtain, the International Labour Organization (ILO) estimates that 1.2 million children are trafficked each year. In 2012, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reported the percentage of child victims had risen in a 3-year span from 20 percent to 27 percent. Every year 300,000 children are taken from all around the world and sold by human traffickers as slaves. 17,000 of those children are brought to the United States—about 46 children per day. In 2014, research conducted by the anti-human trafficking organization Thorn reported that internet sites like Craigslist are often used as tools for conducting business within the industry and that 70 percent of child sex trafficking survivors surveyed were at some point sold online. The trafficking of children has been internationally recognized as a serious crime that exists in every region of the world and which often has human rights implications. Yet, it is only within the past decade that the prevalence and ramifications of this practice have risen to international prominence, due to a dramatic increase in research and public action. Limited research has not yet identified all causes of child trafficking, however, it appears that poverty, humanitarian crisis, and lack of education contribute to high rates. A variety of potential solutions have accordingly been suggested and implemented, which can be categorized as four types of action: broad protection, prevention, law enforcement, and victim assistance.\n\nThe main international documents dealing with the trafficking of children are the 1989 UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, the 1999 ILO Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, and the 2000 UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children.\n\nThe first major international instrument dealing with the trafficking of children is part of the 2000 UN Palermo protocols, titled the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children. Article 3(a) of this document defines child trafficking as the \"recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring and/or receipt\" of a child for the purpose of exploitation. The definition for child trafficking given here applies only to cases of trafficking that are transnational and/or involve organized criminal groups; in spite of this, child trafficking is now typically recognized well outside these parameters. The ILO expands upon this definition by asserting that movement and exploitation are key aspects of child trafficking. The definition of \"child\" used here is that listed in the 1989 UN Convention on the Rights of the Child which states, \"a child means every human being below the age of 18 years, unless, under the law applicable to the child, majority is attained earlier.\" The distinction outlined in this definition is important, because some countries have chosen to set the \"age of majority\" lower than 18, thus influencing what exactly legally constitutes child trafficking.\n\nMany international, regional, and national instruments deal with the trafficking of children. These instruments are used to define what legally constitutes trafficking of children, such that appropriate legal action can be taken against those who engage in and promote this practice. These legal instruments are called by a variety of terms, including conventions, protocols, memorandums, joint actions, recommendations, and declarations. The most significant instruments are listed below:\n\nThese legal instruments were developed by the UN in an effort to protect international human rights and, more specifically, children's rights.\n\nThe trafficking of children often involves both labor and migration. As such, these international frameworks clarify instances in which these practices are illegal.\n\n\nA variety of regional instruments have also been developed to guide countries in decisions regarding child trafficking. Below are some of the major instruments, though many others exist:\n\nNational laws pertaining to child trafficking continue to develop worldwide, based on the international principles that have been established. Anti-trafficking legislation has been lauded as critical by the United Nations Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking, because it ensures that traffickers and trafficking victims are treated accordingly: for example, \"if migration laws are used to pursue traffickers, it is often the case that the victims too are prosecuted as illegal migrants, whereas if there is a specific category of 'trafficker' and 'trafficked person,' then it is more likely that the victim will be treated as such.\" The existence of national laws regarding child trafficking also enables trafficking victims and/or their families to take appropriate civil action.\n\nThe intended or actual after-sale use of the child is not always known.\n\nThe objective of child trafficking is often forced child labour. Child labour refers specifically to children under a stipulated minimum age, usually 14 at the lowest, being required to work. UNICEF estimates that, in 2011, 150 million children aged 5–14 in developing countries were involved in child labour. Additionally, UNICEF states that current rates indicate that at least 100 million children will still be forced to work by 2020. Within this number, the ILO reports that 60% of child workers work in agriculture. A comparative study between domestic child labor rates in urban and rural regions in sub-Saharan Africa reveals that 84.3% of child labourers are working in the rural sector. 99.8% of children age five to fourteen are engaged in child labor for some form of economic activity in these regions. The ILO also estimates that 115 million children are engaged in hazardous work, such as the sex or drug trade. Overall, child labor can take many forms, including domestic servitude, work in agriculture, service, and manufacturing industries. Also, according to several researchers, most children are forced into cheap and controllable labor, and work in homes, farms, factories, restaurants, and much more. Children are cheap labor and additionally are able to complete jobs that adults cannot due to their size. One example for this is within the fishing industry in Ghana. Children can release fish easier from nets due to their small hands. Thereby their services are highly demanded and child labor remains a present consequence of child trafficking. Trafficked children may be sexually exploited, used in the armed forces and drug trades, and in child begging. In terms of global trends, the ILO estimates that in 2004–2008, there was a 3% reduction in the incidence of child labor; this stands in contrast to a previous ILO report which found that in 2000–2004, there was a 10% reduction in child labor. The ILO contends that, globally, child labour is slowly declining, except in sub-Saharan Africa, where the number of child workers has remained relatively constant: 1 in 4 children aged 5–17 work in this region. In 2018 UNICEF reported that 31% of total child labor is located in West Africa. In this region, one in six children between the ages of six and fourteen is working. The report additionally finds that 43% of child labor in Sub-Saharan Africa is due to child migration and trafficking. Another major global trend concerns the number of child laborers in the 15-17 age group: in the past five years, a 20% increase in the number of these child workers has been reported. A surprising example occurred in the United States as McCabe indicates that in the 1990s, huge companies such as Gap and Nike were using industry \"sweatshops\" that used trafficked children to make their desired products. After further investigation of the child labor scandal the hazardous work conditions of the GAP company factories were exposed. Children were working in run-down and dangerous factories, were victims of abuse and got paid far below minimum wage. In the years that followed similar scandals were revealed in other parts of Asia and Africa.\n\nResponding to these cases members of the Secretary-General of the United Nations attempted to reduce the number of violations within corporate systems in 2011 by implementing the United Nations “Protect, Respect and Remedy” Framework, a report stating the guiding principles on transnational corporations and other business enterprises and human rights. Endorsed in Resolution 17/4 by the Human Rights Council on June 16, 2011, the report outlines three main principles. 1) The state's existing obligation to respect, protect and fulfill human rights and fundamental freedoms, 2) the role of business enterprises as specialized organs of society performing specialized functions, required to comply with all applicable laws and to respect human rights, and 3) the need for rights and obligations to be matched to appropriate and effective remedies when breached. The resolution attempted to establish a universal understanding of appropriate employment conditions and stated punishments for those firms who violate the guiding principles. In addition, research regarding the lasting consequences for labor whose rights were violated were revealed. Yet in 2018 it was found that still, 218million children are working full-time, many of which are employed by factory owners to lower production costs.\n\nThe Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography is a protocol of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, formally adopted by the UN in 2000. Essentially, this protocol formally requires states to prohibit the sale of children, child prostitution, and child pornography. According to the ILO, sexual exploitation of children includes all of the following practices and activities:\nThough measuring the extent of this practice is difficult due to its criminal and covert nature, the ILO estimates that there are as many as 1.8 million children sexually trafficked worldwide, while UNICEF's 2006 State of the World's Children Report reports this number to be 2 million. The ILO has found that girls involved in other forms of child labour — such as domestic service or street vending — are at the highest risk of being pulled into commercial child sex trafficking. Likewise, Kendall and Funk justifies how \"young girls age 12 and under are malleable and more easily trained into their prospective roles as prostitutes, and because virginity is highly prized by certain consumers willing to pay a premium\". A variety of sources, including the ILO and scholars Erin Kunze and D.M. Hughes, also contend that the increased use and availability of the Internet has served as a major resource for traffickers, ultimately increasing the incidence of child sex trafficking. In fact, in 2009, Illinois Sheriff Thomas J. Dart sued the owners of Craigslist, a popular online classifieds website, for its \"allowance\" and \"facilitation\" of prostitution, particularly in children. In response to public and legal pressure, Craigslist has since blocked all access to its \"Adult Services\" section.\n\nThe Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict is a protocol of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, formally adopted by the UN in 2000. Essentially, the protocol states that while volunteers below the age of 18 can voluntarily join the armed forces, they cannot be conscripted. As the protocol reads, \"State parties shall take all feasible measures to ensure that member of their armed forces who have not attained the age of 18 years do not take a direct part in hostilities.\" Despite this, the ILO estimates that \"tens of thousands\" of girls and boys are currently forcibly enlisted in the armed forces in at least 17 countries around the world. Children conscripted into the armed forces can then be used in three distinct ways:\nRecent research conducted by the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers has also noted that girl soldiers must be uniquely recognized, in that they are especially vulnerable to acts of sexual violence. The incidence of child soldiers was the focus of the Kony 2012 movement, that aimed to arrest Joseph Kony, a Ugandan war criminal who is responsible for the trafficking of thousands of child soldiers and sex slaves.\n\nChildren are also used in drug trades in all regions of the world. Specifically, children are often trafficked into exploitation as either drug couriers or dealers, and then 'paid' in drugs, such that they become addicted and further entrapped. Due to the illicit nature of drug trafficking, children who are apprehended are often treated as criminals, when in reality they are often the ones in need of legal assistance. While comprehensive worldwide statistics regarding the prevalence of this practice are unknown, several useful regional studies have been conducted. For example, the ILO has recently investigated the use of Afghan children in the heroin trade and child involvement in the drug trades of Brazil. Scholar Luke Dowdney specifically studied children in the drug trade in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; he found that children involved in the drug trades are at significantly higher risk of engaging in violence, particularly murder.\n\nChildren may be trafficked for the purposes of adoption, particularly international adoption. Children are sourced from orphanages or kidnapped, or parents may be tricked, cajoled or coerced into relinquishing custody.\n\nDisreputable international adoption agencies then arrange international adoptions, charging high fees to prospective adoptive parents. The Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Cooperation in regard to Intercountry Adoption is an international agreement designed to protect children from such exploitation and to assist in preventing such illegal intercountry adoptions.\n\nForced child begging is a type of begging in which boys and girls under the age of eighteen are forced to beg through psychological and physical coercion. Begging is defined by the Buffalo Human Rights Law Review as \"the activity of asking for money as charity on the street\". There is evidence to suggest that forced begging is one industry that children are trafficked into, with a recent UNICEF study reporting that 13% of trafficking victims in South Eastern Europe have been trafficked for the purpose of forced begging. The UN protocol affirms that \"the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring or receipt of a child for the purpose of exploitation shall be considered 'trafficking in persons' even if this does not involve any of the means set forth in subparagraph (a) of this article.\" With this definition the transportation of a child to an urban center for the purposes of begging constitutes trafficking regardless of whether this process was enforced by a third party or family member. The severity of this form of trafficking is starting to gain global recognition, with the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the European Union, the ILO, and the UN, among others, beginning to emphasize its pertinence. The European Union's Brussels Declaration on Preventing and Combating Trafficking includes child begging as one form of trafficking, stating \"trafficking in human beings is an abhorrent and worrying phenomenon involving coercive sexual exploitation, labor exploitation in conditions akin to slavery, exploitation in begging and juvenile delinquency as well as domestic servitude.\" This issue is especially difficult to regulate given that forced begging is often imposed by family members, with parental power leveraged over a child to ensure that begging is carried out.\n\nBy definition child begging occurs in persons younger than eighteen, though forced begging has been found by UNICEF to exist among children as young as the age of two. Incidences of this practice have been recorded by the World Bank in South and Central Asia, Europe, Latin America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, and West Africa.\n\nMost research, such as studies done by UNICEF, suggests that boys are much more likely than girls to be trafficked for the purposes of begging; experts presume this is because there is a greater female presence in trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation. In Albania, where forced begging is a common practice, seventy percent of victims are male.\n\nWhile concrete figures are difficult to determine, the ILO recently reported that there are at least 600,000 children involved in forced begging. The problem may be much more extensive, however, with China's Ministry of Civil Affairs reporting that as many as 1.5 million children are forced into begging. Additionally, a recent study done in Senegal by Human Rights Watch projected that a minimum of 50,000 children within the country and neighboring nations have been trafficked for the purposes of begging. Begging is often the primary source of income for street children in a number of countries, with a current study conducted by UNICEF finding that 45.7% of children who work on the streets of Zimbabwe engaged in begging, though there is no way of knowing whether it was through forced means.\n\nGang networks involving forced begging have been found to occur in populations of 500 or greater.\n\nForced begging is a profitable practice in which exploiters are motivated by economic incentives. The business structures of major rings of children trafficked for the purpose of begging have been examined as comparable to a medium-size business enterprise. In the most severe cases networks of children forced to beg may generate $30–40,000 USD for the profiteer. Though family networks are not nearly as extensive, a study conducted in Albania showed that a family with multiple children begging can earn up to fifteen euros a day, an amount greater than the average national teacher salary. Anti-Slavery International asserts that because this income is relatively high many families believe it is the best option available given the lack of existing capabilities. Capability deprivation, meaning the routine absence of adequate resources that serve in facilitating opportunities, may account for cross-generational begging practices within families. UNICEF studies have found that begging is especially prevalent among families in which parents are incapacitated in some way, leading children to be the sole providers.\n\nAccording to the World Bank forced begging is most commonly found in the Middle East and countries of West Africa, where laws prohibiting begging are scarce and heavy regulation of trafficking absent. In Zimbabwe, where child begging is especially prominent, the United Nations has indicated many contradictions between the Labour Act of Zimbabwe and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Many nations, such as Indonesia, have laws against begging on the books, but the repercussions for such entail temporary detainment and eventual release back onto the streets, which does little to combat the issue.\n\nThere are several cultural factors that support begging. In Europe begging is found in a number of minority cultures, especially popular within Roma and nomadic communities. In Turkey familial networks of beggars have been documented across three generations, making it deeply ingrained within their survival schemas. It is important to note that while these may be culturally rooted practices, juvenile begging by way of familial pressure still falls under the realm of forced begging. The transport of children, even one's own, for the purposes of exploitation through begging is a form of trafficking outlined by the United Nations.\n\nAnother cultural practice is the resolution of familial debts through the kidnapping and exploitation of one of their children.\n\nUNICEF has found that children who are forced to beg by third parties are often removed from their families, surrender the majority of their income to their exploiter, endure unsafe work and living conditions, and are at times maimed to increase profits. The process of maiming, popularized by the film \"Slumdog Millionaire\", is common given that according to the Buffalo Human Rights Law Review children with apparent special needs often make upwards of three times as much as other children who beg. In addition to inflictions such as blindness and loss of limbs, other physical abuses for the purposes of heightening profits include pouring chili pepper on a child's tongue to give the appearance of impeded speech, the use of opium to elicit cries, and administering forced injections of drugs that will increase a child's energy and alertness. Testimonies against trafficking ring gang leaders have discussed the detainment of individuals in small cells devoid of food, water, and light to make victims weak and feeble, and thus more likely to elicit donations.\n\nThe conditions in which begging takes place commonly expose children to further physical and verbal abuse, including sexual victimization and police brutality. Research completed by Human Rights Watch revealed that when begging hours are completed for the day children often do not have proper shelter, adequate food, or access to healthcare where they reside. Furthermore, many of the gangs which run networks of forced begging have heavy drug involvement, thus the children under their control are often turned into drug addicts in order for them to become further reliant on their exploiters.\n\nStudies have shown that children forced into begging primarily receive little to no education, with upwards of sixteen hours a day dedicated to time on the streets. With education being a leading method in escaping poverty child beggars have been shown to engage in a cyclical process of continuing this practice cross-generationally. Interviews conducted by UNICEF show that children who beg have little hope for the future and do not believe their circumstances will improve. Children who work on the streets typically have little or no knowledge of their rights, leaving them especially susceptible to exploitation both as juveniles and later as adults. Children who beg have also been found by UNICEF to have much higher instances of HIV-infection due to lack of awareness and supervision on the streets.\n\nA victim-centered human rights approach to combating trafficking has been internationally renowned as the best possible strategy when addressing this issue, with recourse focusing on punishing the exploiter and rehabilitating the child. Some countries who emphasize this method include the United States, with the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 affirming \"victims of severe forms of trafficking should not be inappropriately incarcerated, fined, or otherwise penalized solely for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked.\"\n\nOther supported methods, such as those outlined by the Buffalo Human Rights Center, include relying on three Ps: protection, prosecution, and prevention. Protection starts with enforcing strict measures on the matters of both trafficking and begging. For many nations the first step is the criminalization of begging and trafficking. Prosecution should be instituted in the form of greater legal ramifications for traffickers, with punishment focused on the exploiter rather than the exploited. This becomes difficult with respect to victims of familial trafficking, considering this would require changes in care placement and strict monitoring of each displaced child's welfare. Many organizations affirm that prevention begins with discouraging donations and improving services so that children, and families as a whole, have greater capabilities. Though well-intentioned, by giving child beggars money, individuals only make this practice more profitable, and soon these funds find their way into the hands of the child's abuser.\n\nIn Senegal, where the abuses against talibes are extensive, there have been several initiatives with the help of the World Bank to put an end this exploitation. First, there is intervention on a community level with education on the validity of some of these Quranic institutions provided to rural villages that typically send their children there. This is supplemented by improved regulation of schools within the nation to ensure that they remain places of education, followed by a greater enforcement of preexisting laws banning trafficking and exploitative begging. Finally, rehabilitation services have been provided with the help of CSOs to recovered children to provide them with the capabilities they have been denied.\n\nIn Zimbabwe policy has adapted to ensure the safety of all persons under the age of sixteen with the Children's Protection and Adoption Act, however, the government admits that a lack of resources and capital play a critical role in inadequate enforcement.\n\nIn Bangladesh, where there are an estimated 700,000 beggars, a law passed in 2009 banning the practice, though officials report some trouble with enforcement.\n\nIn China, the Ministry of Public Security has established a department that solely focuses on child trafficking. Recently the department has instituted a hotline where the public dials 110 to report suspected incidences of forced begging, which law enforcement officials are expected to investigate further. The police are trained to take the children into custody if a blood relationship with their guardian cannot be established, and educate parents on the illegality and dangers of begging if they are those responsible for the child's action. This policy instituted in April 2009 has since led to the recovery of 9,300 children.\n\nMany NGOs have initiated movements focusing on informing the public on the dangers of donations. As recently reported by UNICEF, \"certain behaviors, such as giving money to child beggars can also indirectly motivate traffickers and controller to demand children.\" The Mirror Foundation's Stop Child Begging Project of Thailand is one such organization that emphasizes eliminating the demand. Their initiatives are focused on educating passersby on the forced begging of trafficked Cambodians within their country to decrease the likelihood of donations.\n\nIn China, where the kidnapping and forced begging of children has been routinely documented, a multi-media movement has begun. Here, blogs are utilized to publicize over 3,000 photos of children whose families believe have been abducted for the purpose of begging, with hundreds of thousands of followers who remain on the look out for these children in major urban centers. This campaign has enabled at least six children to be recovered and reunited with their families.\n\nIn instances where begging is religiously sanctioned it has been suggested by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) that religious leaders should outwardly condemn this practice. For talibes religious leaders have been asked to take a stance against begging using passages cited from the Quran, such as, \"Except paradise, you should not beg anything for the sake of Allah\" (8:23), which would help strip the practice of its religious foundation. In addition, former US President Clinton took the responsibility of providing protection against child abuse through Internet Service Providers (ISP) that can help law enforcement track any suspicious activities including child pornography.\n\nIn China, in response to adult starvation, some children were exchanged, killed, and eaten. According to Robyn Meredith, in the People's Republic of China (\"ca.\" 1958), \"Peasants turned into skeletons. The nation's farmers, including the residents of Xiaogang, found themselves going to shocking lengths to find food. ... Some starving families resorted to a practice called \"易子而食\" [meaning 'exchanging children to eat']: they traded a child for a neighbor's child, then killed and ate the skinny youngster, with the sickening knowledge that their neighbors were devouring their own.\"\n\nIn ancient Rome, according to Keith Bradley, Augustine wrote that \"there were indigent parents selling their children because they needed the cash.\"\n\nIn contemporary Nepal, parents of poor families sell their children to orphanages (or sometimes simply hand them over without any payment). The orphanage then misrepresent them as \"orphans\", ensuring an income for the orphanages.\n\nIn general, child trafficking takes place in three stages: recruitment, movement, and exploitation. Recruitment occurs when a child is approached by a recruiter, or in some cases, directly approaches a recruiter themselves. Recruitment is initiated in many different ways: adolescents may be under pressure to contribute to their families, children may be kidnapped or abducted into trafficking, or families may be trafficked together. Then, movement will occur — locally, regionally, and/or internationally — through a variety of transportation types, including by car, train, boat, or foot. Ultimately, the final goal of child trafficking is exploitation, whereby traffickers use the services of children to garner illegal profit. Exploitation can take place in a variety of forms, including forced labor, sexual exploitation, and child begging, among other practices.\n\nChild trafficking is often conceptualized using the economic model of supply and demand. Specifically, those who are trafficked constitute the \"supply\", while the traffickers, and all those who profit from the exploitation, provide the \"demand\". Two types of demand are defined: consumer demand and derived demand. Consumer demand is generated by people who actively or passively buy the products or services of trafficked labor. An example of this would be a tourist purchasing a T-shirt that has been made by a trafficked child. Derived demand, on the other hand, is generated by people who directly profit from the practice of trafficking, such as pimps or corrupt factory owners. Scholar Kevin Bales has extensively studied the application of this economic framework to instances of human trafficking; he contends that it is central to an accurate understanding of how trafficking is initiated and sustained. Bales, along with scholars Elizabeth M. Wheaton, Edward J. Schauer, and Thomas V. Galli, have asserted that national governments should more actively implement policies that reduce both types of demand, thus working towards the elimination of trafficking.\n\nVarious international organizations, including the ILO and UN.GIFT, have linked child trafficking to poverty, reporting that living in poverty has been found to increase children's vulnerability to trafficking. However, poverty is only one of many social \"risk factors\" that can lead to trafficking. As UNICEF and the World Bank note, \"Often children experience several risk factors at the same time, and one of them may act as a trigger that sets the trafficking event in motion. This is sometimes called 'poverty plus,' a situation in which poverty does not by itself lead to a person being trafficked, but where a 'plus' factor such as illness combines with poverty to increase vulnerability.\" UNICEF, UN.GIFT, and several scholars, including Una Murray and Mike Dottridge, also contend that an accurate understanding of child trafficking must incorporate an analysis of gender inequality. Specifically, in many countries, girls are at a higher risk of being trafficked, particularly into sexual exploitation. In addition, these international agencies and scholars contend that giving women and men an equal voice in anti-trafficking policy is critical to reducing the incidence of child trafficking.\n\nStudies throughout Europe have identified risks that make children vulnerable to exploitation that are also causes and contributing factors of child trafficking. These include social and economic marginalisation, dysfunctional family backgrounds, experiences of neglect, abuse or violence within the family or in institutions, exploitative relationships, gender-based violence and discrimination, experiences of living or working on the streets, precarious and irregular migration situations, aspirations to work and to earn money and limited opportunities to enter or remain in school, vocational training or regular employment. As the efforts of national governments to improve social safety nets can lessen many of these risks, child trafficking is considered not only a result of criminal activities but also as indicating weaknesses in the national government's ability to effectively safeguard children's rights to a safe and healthy development.\n\nThe complex definition of child trafficking and the differences in national laws and interpretations makes the identification of child victims of trafficking challenging. For example, the European debate on child trafficking lacks consensus on how child trafficking is to be distinguished from other contexts of exploitation, from social dumping of migrants, the sale of children and the smuggling of migrants. People smugglers are also known to exploit children to transport migrants across international borders.\n\nOnce a potential victim has come into contact with state authorities, identifying the child as a victim of trafficking takes time. The process often benefits from a thorough understanding of the child's story. For a child who is in trouble with the law, hearing the child's full story helps caseworkers and officers determine if the child is actually a victim of a crime herself, such as exploitation, abuse, or trafficking. For a child in an administrative process, such as an asylum procedure, hearing the child's full story helps caseworkers to detect cases of trafficking. Children may be hesitant to share their complete stories with authorities and appointed child welfare professionals. Some service providers have found that establishing trust and a stable relationship with the child encourages increased disclosure of experiences of exploitation and trafficking that might otherwise not be detected. The trust building process can include granting assistance and support services to ensure safety, well-being and development.\n\nIdentified victims of child trafficking are entitled to special safeguards that all child victims of crimes are entitled to under international law. These safeguards include the right to guardianship, legal assistance and representation, safety and protection, support for physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration, regularisation of immigration status, the right to compensation, and the right to act as a party, or plaintiff, in criminal proceedings. An important safeguard for trafficked children who have been exploited in illegal or criminal activities is the ‘non-punishment clause’. It means that child victims of criminal offences, including human trafficking, are to be protected from sanctions or prosecution for acts that they committed in relation to their situation as victims.\n\nArticles 19 and 32-36 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child prohibits the exploitation of children in any form and in any context. Any child who is exposed to violence, exploitation or abuse can be considered a victim of crime and enjoys the correlated rights and entitlements, including access to assistance, protection and support, services for recovery and rehabilitation, access to justice, with due procedural safeguards in any related legal or administrative proceedings. Children at risk of exploitation have to be identified and recognised as being at risk. This implies that they have a right to assistance and support in order to prevent their exploitation or any other harm resulting from the risks. Considering the difficulties of identifying children who have been trafficked and the broad protection against all forms and contexts of exploitation afforded under the Convention, a child rights-based approach prioritises the identification of child victims of exploitation or other crime and children at risk. Whether or not exploitation takes place in a context of trafficking is of subordinate relevance for the child rights and protection context. It may interest primarily the law enforcement investigations and the prosecution.\n\nIt is difficult to obtain reliable estimates concerning the number of children trafficked each year, primarily due to the covert and criminal nature of this practice. It often takes years to gather and compile estimates regarding child trafficking and, as a result, data can seem both inadequate and outdated. This process of gathering data is only complicated by the fact that very few countries publish national estimates of child trafficking. As a result, the available statistics are widely thought to underestimate the actual scope of the problem.\n\nTrafficking of children has been documented in every region of the world. A widely used figure regarding the prevalence of this practice is provided by the ILO, which estimates that 1.2 million children are trafficked each year; this estimate includes cross-border and internal trafficking.\n\nRegionally, the ILO has provided the following estimates for trafficking of children by region per year:\n\nAs the numbers above indicate, child trafficking occurs the most frequently in Latin America and the Caribbean. Child trafficking is also the most prevalent in developing countries, though it does occur in developed and industrialized economies as well. Notably, the US Department of State publishes an annual \"Trafficking in Persons\" report which provides ample data regarding the prevalence of human and child trafficking in the majority of countries. The University of Pennsylvania School of Social Work released a study that estimated as many as 300,000 American youth may be at risk of commercial sexual exploitation at any time.\n\nAccording to anthropologist Samuel Pyeatt Menefee, in late 17th and 18th century Britain, parents in poverty \"sold their children (actually, their children's services, but to all intents and purposes their persons as well)\". Sale motivations were more economic than for wife sales and prices, drawing from limited data, \"appear to have been fairly high\". Many of the boys sold were climbing boys for chimney sweeps until they were no longer small enough. Prostitution was another reason for selling a child, usually a girl. One sale was of a niece; another was the sale by a man of the daughter of a woman domestic partner who also ran his business. Some children were stolen and then sold.\n\nScholarly research has indicated that there is no root cause for child trafficking. There are, however, multiple reasons which contribute to high numbers such as poverty, humanitarian crisis and lack of education. It is additionally important to note that migration can also be voluntary.\n\nPoverty is the leading cause for child trafficking worldwide. Often parents are not able to provide for their families and consequentially exploit their children for financial reasons. These influencers lead to children being more inclined to take riskier jobs in order to sustain life for themselves and their families. The decision for parents to expose their children for child trafficking, due to poverty, is not always for money incentives, but also because a lack of education causes them to believe that migration elsewhere will provide their children with more opportunities, which will help them escape chronic poverty. Sometimes children are orphaned as a result of poverty, leaving them in the hands of child traffickers. There are estimated to be around 120 million children living on the streets in the world (30 million in Africa, 30 million in Asia, and 60 million in South America), making children vulnerable and thus easy targets.\n\nChild trafficking is 20-30% higher after natural disasters. This was seen after the 2015 earthquake and 2010 earthquake in Haiti. The increase of sex trafficking after natural disasters results in the victimization of girls under the age of 18, specifically 33%. of girls under the age of 18 in such areas. The reason is increased vulnerability and financial instability which arises after natural disasters hit.\n\nA lack of education and literacy furthermore makes families more vulnerable to traffickers. Parents are often unaware of the negative consequences of child trafficking and voluntarily send their children away. Additionally, children are often not aware of their rights and lack understanding regarding which of their rights are violated. There is a need to educate children of their rights, because it will reduce the likelihood of manipulation and forced industry work. Informing children of their right to education will increase the net enrolment and grade completion rate.\n\nIn 2013 youth migrants, ages 15–24 made up 12% of total migration. The term \"child trafficking\" is often misused when migration is voluntary. \"Youth migration\" refers to youth choosing to leave homes to access opportunities elsewhere. Opportunities such as quality education, employment, and adventure are often scarce in rural areas, which is why migration often occurs from rural to urban areas. The ILO stated that 27 million young people leave their countries of birth to seek employment abroad as international migrants. In order to make migration safer for youth the UN adopted \"Addressing migration opportunities and challenges is central to achieving sustainable economic and social development\" to their new development goals, which are to be released in 2030.\n\nAccording to UN.GIFT, child trafficking has the most significant impact on trafficked children and their families. First, trafficking can result in the death or permanent injury of the trafficked child. This can stem from a dangerous \"movement\" stage of trafficking or from specific aspects of the \"exploitation\" stage, such as hazardous working conditions. Moreover, trafficked children are often denied access to healthcare, effectively increasing their chances of serious injury and death. Trafficked children are also often subject to domestic violence; they may be beaten or starved in order to ensure obedience. In addition, these children frequently encounter substance abuse; they may be given drugs as \"payment\" or to ensure that they become addicted and thus dependent on their trafficker(s). As opposed to many other forms of crime, the trauma experienced by children who are trafficked is often prolonged and repeated, leading to severe psychological impacts. UN.GIFT reports that trafficked children often suffer from depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder, among other conditions.\n\nEffects on families are also severe. Some families believe that sending or allowing their children to relocate in order to find work will bring in additional income, while in reality many families will never see their trafficked children again. In addition, UN.GIFT has found that certain forms of trafficking, particularly sexual exploitation in girls, bring \"shame\" to families. Thus, in certain cases, children who are able to escape trafficking may return to their families only to find that they are rejected and ostracized.\n\nChild trafficking has also been shown to have a major effect on communities. If multiple children in a community are trafficked, it can result in the entire community being corrupted, and thus devastated, by trafficking. Social development efforts are hindered, as trafficked children's educations are cut short. As a result of this lack of education, children who escape trafficking may be less able to secure employment later in life. In addition, trafficked girls face special obstacles, in that their prospects for marriage might be diminished if the community becomes aware that they have been trafficked, particularly into sexual exploitation.\n\nOn a national level, economic development is severely hindered by the lack of education of trafficked children; this results in a major loss of potentially productive future workers. Children who are able to successfully return to their families often pose a significant financial burden, due to their lack of education, and the illnesses and injuries they may have incurred during trafficking work. There are major costs associated with the rehabilitation of these trafficked children, so that they are able to successfully participate in their communities. Furthermore, the persistence of child trafficking indicates the presence of sustained criminal activity and criminal networks, which, in most cases, are also associated with drugs and violence. As a result, UN.GIFT has cited child trafficking as a significant indicator of national and global security threats.\n\nSolutions to child trafficking, or \"anti-trafficking actions\", can be roughly classified into four categories:\n\nBroad protection actions are geared towards children who could potentially be trafficked, and include raising awareness about child trafficking, particularly in vulnerable communities. This type of outreach also includes policies geared towards improving the economic statuses of vulnerable families, so that reasonable alternatives are available to them, other than sending their children to work. Examples of this include increasing employment opportunities for adults and conditional cash transfer programs. Another major broad protection program that has been readily endorsed by UN.GIFT, the ILO, and UNICEF involves facilitating gender equality, specifically by enhancing both boys' and girls' access to affordable, quality education. Other forms of protection and resources are conveniently located clinics, clean water, sustainable environments, and financial literacy.\n\nAnother way to raise awareness for child trafficking is by communities from all over the world dedicating a week to this situation. Observing the 2012 Human Trafficking Awareness Day in the US, and wider world. Community groups along with police enforcements are collaborating to organize events as well as in depth information sessions and support groups for the victims. The events held by communities could include films, guest speakers, booths, and many more things that can help people understand the seriousness of this issue. The ICE (Human Trafficking) has a help line for victims as well as conducts awareness in the U.S.A communities through the ICE In Plain Sight Campaign.\n\nPreventative actions are more focused on addressing the actual practice of child trafficking, specifically by implementing legal frameworks that are aimed to both deter and prosecute traffickers. This involves the adoption and implementation of the ILO's international labour standards, as well as the development of safe and legal migration practices.\n\nLaw enforcement refers to the actual prosecution of traffickers; UNICEF maintains that successful prosecution of child traffickers is the surest way to send a message that child trafficking will not be tolerated. Traffickers can be \"caught\" at any one of the three steps of trafficking: recruitment, movement, and/or exploitation; anti-trafficking laws as well as child labour laws must then be appropriately enforced and having them properly implemented. The development of grassroots surveillance systems has also been suggested by UNICEF which would enable communities to immediately report signs of child trafficking to legal authorities. However, some anti-trafficking groups, such as the Young Women's Empowerment Project, are against working with law enforcement due to cases where law enforcement officials played roles in the exploitation of the victim. In June 2016, 14 Oakland Police officers were alleged to have been involved in a sex scandal involving a teenaged prostitute, including some while she was allegedly a minor.\n\nProtection begins first with victim identification; child trafficking laws must specifically and appropriately define what constitutes a \"trafficking victim\". Legal processes must then be in place for removing children from trafficking situations, and returning them either to their families or other appropriate settings. Victims should also be provided with individualized and supportive physical and psychological rehabilitation in order to establish him or her self. Trauma-informed programs, prevention education programs, survivor-led centers, and other recovery and community integration programs are options as well. Youth-specific vulnerabilities such as homelessness, lack of family, mistrust, lack of socialization, coercive relationships, substance abuse, and lack of education can cause challenges for in the process of rehabilitation for some children. Some scholars advocate for rights-based development, where the victims, survivors, and youth at-risk should be able to participate in the planning of projects and have continued involvement in order to build autonomy and leadership. This recuperation can take quite a length of time but, with the individual having the correct support, they can work towards a functional life.\n\nFinally, steps should be taken to avoid \"double victimization\" — in other words, to ensure that formerly trafficked children are treated as victims, and not as criminals. An example of \"double victimization\" would be a child who was illegally trafficked into sexual exploitation in the United States, and then, once free from trafficking, is prosecuted for being an illegal migrant. The End Trafficking Project is the initiative to raise awareness about child trafficking and help people take action to protect children. The UNICEF has come up with ways to help children from child exploitation and the risk factors that need to be addressed. These include:\n\n\nMany organizations have proposed potential solutions to child trafficking. These organizations continue to conduct research concerning this practice and policies that can be implemented to work towards its eradication. The most internationally recognized of these organizations include: \n\n\n"}
{"id": "2045470", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2045470", "title": "KRLX", "text": "KRLX\n\nKRLX is a student-run, freeform radio format, non-commercial FM campus radio station broadcasting from Northfield, Minnesota. Affiliated with Carleton College. The station's call sign was chosen to read \"KaRL-ten,\" since X is the Roman numeral for ten. KRLX broadcasts with 100 watts of power at 88.1 MHz and produces live streaming media, expanding the station's reach to the world. The KRLX studios are located in the basement of the Sayles-Hill Campus Center, Carleton's student union; they feature basic production tools, a record library, and a live FM studio. The basement location is the motivation for the station's motto, \"It's better on the bottom.\" KRLX is licensed for continuous broadcast, but because the station is student-run, the signal is present only when school is in session. Because Carleton does not offer a summer term, the station generally broadcasts September through June, though not during winter and spring breaks. \n\nIn the fall of 2005, KRLX introduced podcasting for all of its non-music shows, including all of the station's original news programming and Periscope. \n\nBeginning in 2005, The Princeton Review began ranking KRLX as one of the nation's top college radio stations. In 2009, KRLX was ranked the 12th best station in the country. By 2018, it had moved up to position #4 on the Princeton Review list of best college radio stations.\n\nIn March 2020, the station resumed publishing its music arts and culture magazine, \"No Fidelity\", which had previously gone defunct in 2015. The publication also doubles as a record label, releasing compilations of music made by Carleton students.\n\nCarleton College radio started in 1917 with the Music Department's initiative to bring radio to Northfield, MN. With an antenna mounted atop Willis Hall, this AM station broadcast until 1929 at an unknown frequency. In 1948 several students on the G.I. Bill, most veterans from the United States Navy, sought to construct and operate a radio station for students on the Carleton College campus. Using money raised from local businesses and out-of-pocket, they paid the college to allow them to construct a small studio dug out next to the foundation of Scoville Memorial Library on the South side. All electronics were handmade out of spare parts and the transmitter was from a scrapped World War II destroyer. The carrier current transmission was carried via coaxial cable through the Carleton College tunnel complex and radio station KARL 680 was born. The studios were relocated to the top floor of Willis (then the student union) somewhere before 1970. \n\nDuring the early 70s, station manager James Stiles led the effort to take the station to the broadcast airwaves. Washington DC Carl alums assisted with the FCC licensing process, and by 1975 a boxy FM transmitter had arrived on campus. After a winter of engineering challenges, chief engineer Ben Stiegler (with a lot of help from consultant John Rooks and the MPR engineering team) achieved the first broadcast and the greater Northfield area tuned in. For a brief time, KRLX retained the carrier current operation as a training ground for new DJs; eventually it was decommissioned.\n\nKRLX is one of the most popular student organizations at Carleton, with over 200 students DJs each trimester--roughly one out of every eight students.\n\nKRLX's format-free nature makes for very diverse programming, and recently the station has started to program vertically so that similar shows are scheduled consecutively. Radio programs on KRLX run the gamut from bluegrass to independent hip hop to classical, and DJs are restricted only by Federal Communications Commission (FCC) guidelines. Despite the station's flexibility, there are several long-running programs that are consistent in format, if not in content. Bandemonium is a weekly show devoted to the works of a single band, tracing artists' history and influences. Periscope is the station's documentary program, and the station also programs evening news and hourly news briefs. Although almost all of KRLX's programming has its genesis at Carleton, the station also broadcasts the syndicated news program \"Democracy Now!\" KRLX's content largely consists of music broadcasting, and the station contributes to the College Media Journal Radio 200 chart.\n\nKRLX's programming can be heard around the world via live stream from their Web site. \n\n"}

In publicly traded companies these plans typically amount to allocation of shares to employees. One of the earliest pioneers of profit sharing was Englishman Theodore Cooke Taylor, who is known to have introduced the practice in his woollen mills during the late 1800s . \n\nThe profit sharing plans are based on predetermined economic sharing rules that define the split of gains between the company as a principal and the employee as an agent. For example, suppose the profits are formula_1, which might be a random variable. Before knowing the profits, the principal and agent might agree on a sharing rule formula_2. Here, the agent will receive formula_2 and the principal will receive the residual gain formula_4.\n\nThe share of profits paid to the management or to the board of directors is sometimes called the tantième. This French term is generally applied in describing the business and finance practices of certain European countries, including Germany, France, Belgium, and Sweden. It is usually paid in addition to the manager's (or director's) fixed salary and bonuses (bonuses usually depend on profits as well, and often bonuses and tantieme are treated as the same thing); laws vary from country to country.\n\nIn the United States, a profit sharing plan can be set up where all or some of the employee's profit sharing amount can be contributed to a retirement plan. These are often used in conjunction with 401(k) plans.\n\nGainsharing is a program that returns cost savings to the employees, usually as a lump-sum bonus. It is a productivity measure, as opposed to profit-sharing which is a profitability measure. There are three major types of gainsharing: \n\n\n"}
{"id": "2045489", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2045489", "title": "Orjen", "text": "Orjen\n\nOrjen (Montenegrin Cyrillic: Орјен, ) is transboundary Dinaric Mediterranean limestone mountain range, located in southwestern Montenegro, with a small part extending into Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nIts highest peak is Veliki kabao, which stands at 1894 m (6225 ft). The Orjen Peak is the highest peak in the \"Sub-Adriatic\" Dinarides. The massif of Orjen lies east to south-east of Trebinje in Bosnia and Herzegovina and north-west of Risan in Bay of Kotor (Boka Kotorska). From the town of Risan, situated at the innermost protected part of the bay, a well-engineered road, at first metalled, with many hairpin bends climbs to about 1600 m, over to the interior. At the main summit of Orjen and the surrounding ridges and high plateaus the action of quaternary glaciation is evident. During the Ice Age, long valley glaciers receded from Orjen to the Bay of Kotor and surrounding poljes. Hollowing U-shaped valleys and cirques in their course. Glaciers also shaped jagged peaks and ridges. Glacial and karst type relief combine now in a unique coastal scenery. There are few places elsewhere in the Mediterranean which demonstrate similar phenomena.\n\nThe Natural and Culturo-Historical Region of Kotor is a UNESCO World Heritage site, comprising the territory between Orjen and Lovćen, including all the small towns in the bays of Risan and Kotor with their natural setting. With this privileged natural harbour the Bay of Kotor has been settled for millennia. Illyrians and Greeks colonised the coast from 400 BC and established today's ports Risan (Rhizon) and Kotor (Cattaro). Due to lack of potable water, the high mountain was never densely populated. Snow patches collected from deep pit holes were used even late in the 20th century to provide the few hamlets with water. Today, wells are used instead.\n\nMount Orjen is a block mountain lifted up as a horst and thus towering above the lowered Bay of Kotor and the high karst plateaux surrounding the Mount Orjen horst. With 1894 m difference between the lowest and the highest point, relief energy has a great role in the extremely harsh environment. A hyperkarstic barren landscape of vast karren fields contrasts with very species rich vegetation types, ranging from evergreen deciduous forests at lower altitudes to endemic calcareous Dinaric Fir and Pine forests in higher altitudes. Precipitation reaches 5000 l per m², amounts typical for tropical rainforests or the eastern Himalayas than the dry Mediterranean. Lying at Europe's wettest coast, snow easily accumulates on karstic plateaux and as late as June small snow patches continue to lie in shaded places under the summits. Skiing is possible but no relevant infrastructures exist today. Orjen is a more important hiking destination. Three mountain huts provide basic accommodation.\n\nOrjen comprises transboundary area of about 400 km² between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro, and runs for 25 km from region around Trebinje in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the north-west, to Bay of Kotor in Montenegro in the south-east. Mount Orjen is composed of four high karstic plateaux divided by ridges. Three near parallel ridges collide in Veliki kabao, Orjens' culmination point. The ridges are arranged by elevation with the highest to the north screening the Bijela gora plateaux from the Mediterranean coast. The separated plateaux are the Krivošije to the East, Bijela gora to the North, and Dobri do and Vrbanj to the West. Only few settlements are scattered in surrounding poljes. The poljes of Grahovo, Dragalj, Vrbanj, Krusevica and Grabalj are important for agricultural use and provide the only lines of communication in the karst. Migration circled around Mount Orjen as a major obstacle between the coastal, Herceg Novi and Risan and the interior towns of Grahovo, Trebinje and Nikšić.\n\nSeveral dry river valleys are found on Orjen. Only in decades they react as short-living rivers when heavy rain and snow-melt combine. Flooding can be a problem and several poljes are renowned for their long inundation periods.\n\nMediterranean mountains bear no glaciers any more except small snow fields in some shaded cirques of the Taurus range. Even during the pleistocene snowlines were not much lower as in today's Alps. Glaciers were only of local significance in the Mediterranean enabling frost sensitive vegetation types to survive the climate changes of the Quaternary.\nAmong the once glaciated Mediterranean mountains Orjen was outstanding for one of the biggest ice cap in the region. A 150 km² covered 1/3 of the area. All part above 900 m were buried under a thick sheet of ice from where several glacial tonges descended to 500 m above sea level. Traces of glacial activity are evident in any part of Orjen as in the Bijela gora plateaux. No glacial lakes survive today as they were extinguished due to the porosity of the karstified landscape.\nMany cirques, U-shaped valleys and moraines and jagged ridges and summits bear the evidence of the glacial erosion.\nIn stoneage and Bronze Age humans settled in the Orjen region. This early human activity is depicted by rock paintings of deerhunt and humans in Lipci in Risan bay. A major Bronze Age excavation site is at Popovo polje to the north of Mount Orjen.\n\nMount Orjen is built up from pure Cretaceous limestone. As precipitation and temperatures are high and vegetation is abundant karstification processes are evolved. Lapies, sinkholes and caves resolve from the solution of the limestone. The solution process is the faster the more water is available for solution. Vegetation and soilformation play also a role in the process.\nA major disadvantage is that the water is percolating fast in the porous rocks and does not form brooks and rivers despite the heavy amounts of precipitation. An overall dryness is characteristic that is unsuitable for settling.\nThus the region has been depopulated for a long time. Only during times of repression the unfavourable high mountains were mainly populated by Montenegrin tribes. During the time of the Ottoman rule from the 15th to the 19th century the high karst was acting as main shelter for the Christian population. Military campaigns of Turks and Austro-Hungarians faced heavy losses while both great powers underestimated the difficulties to undertake successful raids in karst areas. The Battle of Vučji Do between Montenegrins and Turks and the Krivošije uprising in 1869 showed that the Montenegrins used the natural conditions in their favour.\n\nKarst is also a major tourist attraction as caves are frequent and peculiar geomorphological forms can be studied. Karst vegetation on the other hand is species rich and major karst areas are hot spots of biodiversity. The both famous Southeast Asian karst areas like the Guilin tower karst region in Southern China or Phuket island in Thailand and the Mediterranean dinaric karst areas with the Plitvice lakes in Croatia and the Bay of Kotor in Montenegro rival with spectacularity.\n\nTectonically the area of the Southern Adriatic is very active as the frequency of earthquakes indicates. As the Adriatic Plate subduces under the Dinarids, earthquakes can have devastating energy. Sometimes even tsunamis are observed. Mount Orjen is completely built of folded Cretaceous limestones which belongs to the High-Karst Zone geological unit. \nThe High-Karst Zone has the greatest extent in the territory of Montenegro. The terrain of this geotectonic unit is mainly built up of Mesozoic (Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous) limestones and dolomites of several kilometres of thickness. This thickness is even larger, due to the reverse faulting and overthrusting and thus repeating of carbonate series. The karst of this region is characterised by all surface occurrences and all processes characteristic for holokarst such as: karst plain, polje, uvala, sinkhole, dry-, hanging-, blind- and karstified valley, lapies, canyon, shaft, cave, resurgence, vrulja, estavelle and so on.\nThe karstification of limestones and dolomites in this area is below the base level of erosion, below the sea level and is deeper than 1,000 m. The High-Karst Zone has all the prominent characteristics of fluvial erosion (deep canyons of Komarnica and Morača rivers with their tributaries), glacial erosion (on Mount Orjen), lacustrine, sea and combined erosion.\n\nAlong the internal belt of Bay of Kotor, from Morinj, across Risan to Kotor, the High-Karst Zone is in direct contact with the sea, as the High-Karst Zone overthrusts the Pindus Cukali Zone where Mount Orjen rises from the Bay of Risan. The direct contact of the Adriatic sea and the High-Karst Zone leads to interesting hydrological phenomena. In these terrains the largest vrulja on the Adriatic coast, called Sopot, is located. The vast differences in water-yielding capacity of the constant and periodic karst springs point out to the strong karstification of High-Karst Zone limestones and dolomites on Mount Orjen. The difference between minimal and maximal water yielding capacity is over 350 m³.\n\nOrjen is within the Mediterranean subtropical belt. While summers are hot and sunny, autumn, winter and spring are rainy seasons. It is the climate type of the Mediterranean but modifications exist in the vast region. A peculiarity of the littoral Dinarids is the precipitation regime as Orjen receives Europe's' most heavy precipitation. Like the monsoon rain is seasonally distributed, thus November thunderstorms sometimes pour 2000 l of water in several days, while August is frequently completely dry leading to forest fires. With a maximum discharge of 200 m³/s water one of the biggest karst springs, the Sopot spring, is a remarkable indicator of this seasonality. Most of the time it is inactive but after heavy rain a remarkable waterfall appears 20 m above the Bay of Kotor.\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>\nclassification scheme after Köppen\n\nTwo wind systems are noteworthy for their ecological significance: Bora and Sirocco. Strong cold downslope winds of Bora type appear in winter and are most severe in the Bay of Risan. Gusts reach 250 km/h and can lead to a significant fall of temperatures in several hours with freezing events problematic for most of the Mediterranean cultures. Bora weather situations are frequent and sailors keep an eye on the mountains as cap clouds indicate an imminent Bora event.\nSirocco is a warm humid rain and is important as it brings heavy rain. It appears throughout the year but is usually centered in autumn and spring.\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>\nmonthly and yearly precipitation ranges in Dalmatia, Herzegovina and Montenegro\n\nMostly limestone rocks but also moraines and screes. Coastal cliffs are present at all parts of the Bay of Kotor. Many forest types can be seen of which Mediterranean deciduous evergreen don't play a significant role. Dinaric calcareous fir forests are found in several grooves on the Bijela gora but are difficult to reach. Bosnian pine forests are quite widespread on all major ridges. Virgin woodlands still exist, mainly Beech forests.\n\nAcross Orjen vegetation varies with climate and altitude. While the sub-adriatic range exhibits evergreen deciduous forests, the vegetation graduates to temperate forests, conifers and tundra in the northern and upper regions. The ridges also have a variety of Mediterranean alpine vegetation – oromediterranean pastures.\nThe typical karst country with bare limestone rochocks interspersed with parches of wood is found on lower altitudes. White Oak, Hop-hornbeam and Montpellier Maple, or the characteristic scrub of the maquis shrubland and garrigue are notable. There are stony meadows in the sunken dolina of the karst that contrast vividly with the stony slopes and rocky scrubland all round.\nHigher altitudes are characterised by heavy beech forest with occasional open grassy pastures. On northern branches silver fir accompanies beech. Above the beech and fir-beech forests are scattered open stands of pure Dinaric calcareous Silver Fir forests and Bosnian pine with deep-purple young cones set among stiff light-green needles. Open stony screes and rocks are exposed to the jagged ridges and summits. They are very rich in species.\n\nFlora is of Balkan type with many Illyrian and Balkan endemics. Notable is local endemism with 10 endemics restricted to Mount Orjen.\n\nA National Park was planned for a long time on Orjen. The disintegration of Yugoslavia, civil war and standstill of tourism cancelled plans. Today plans a rejuvenated but funding maybe a problem. UNESCO declared the Natural and Culturo-Historical Region of Kotor a World Heritage site. The part of Orjen within the boundaries of this Site is namely the Krivosije plateaux. A further evaluation of the patrimony and nomination of a greater part of Orjen as National park has good reasons. Unique flora, fauna and relief certainly require a protection plan by administrative action.\n\nThe earliest historic confirmations are the Lipce rock paintings which are dated in the Bronze Age. The first historic significant events are connected with the Illyrians when Queen Teuta, reigned approximately from 231 BC to 228 BC choose Risan as her capital during her war against the Romans. The Greek also colonised the region and eventually the Romans took over. The classical name of the Bay of Kotor is after Rhizon (Risan) Sinus Rhizonicus. Eventually Kotor was becoming more important during the Middle Ages\n\nOnly few traditional shepherds live today on Orjen. Mostly remain on the northern side of the Bijela gora. They have their local songs describing life on the remote mountain and every year in July a great feast takes place when all the shepherds from Bijela gora come together to sing dance and eat on a pasture at Ledenik.\n\nLivestock is mostly sheep but also horses and few cattle are held. At Orjen saddle oxen graze. In former times nomadic migration took place between the poljes and the higher regions of Orjen.\nThe traditional housing on Orjen is the so-called Koliba. Small limestone huts with roofs build of pine bark. Only few hamlets are inhabited, mostly close to the coast. The higher up the stronger the push factors acted to leave.\nTribes on Orjen were once renowned for their wildness and still people from the coast have this notion towards the mountain tribes.\n\nGlacial and karst features compose a unique landscape that is attracting visitors also from abroad. Backpacking and alpine recreation are important factors for the development of the Orjen region. Three mountain huts are established and enthusiasts keep winter sports alive.\n\nTrails are maintained by the PSD Subra mountaineering association from Herceg Novi. Most trails are around the huts at Vratlo (1160 m) and Orjen ridge (1594 m). 40 km of marked trails exist in the Mount Orjen region, leading to the most attractive destinations. Marked trails start at the city bus station at Herceg Novi (30 m) and lead to the Vratlo hut (1160 m). Hiking in other more remote parts is also possible but no marcation currently exists. Visitors of Bijela gora or Dobri can use several local forest roads. sometimes shepherds can offer night accommodation.\n\nWater is only available at some places, shepherd villagers usually use rain collectors.\nMost hikers tend to visit Subra (1680 m) or Veliki kabao (1894 m). Both are well marked.\n\nBrown bears appear in the Bijela gora and should not be disturbed as the population is critically endangered.\n\nEvery year around mid May a half marathon called Orjen marathon is organised by the PSD Subra alpine organization. Guests are welcomed to take part in the traditional manifestation\n\nSeveral interesting alpine like climbing possibilities like rock climbing exist. Most remarkable is the 500 m wall of the Subra amphitheatre. In last few years the alpine – speleo section (A.S.O.S.) of PSD Subra started to climb routes on Mount Orjen. Good climbing routes are only 10 minutes walk from the Vratlo mountain hut. Other good climbing routes are in Subra's Amphitheatre and Reovacka Greda rocks. Mount Orjen gives a lot opportunities for climbing unclimbed routes with various difficulties. A training rock near to the Herceg Novi – Trebinje road called \"Silobod\" (250 m) is in use.\n\nMuch of Mount Orjen is inaccessible due to heavy snow in winter. However, Orjen saddle 1594 m can be reached in winter from Vrbanj.\n\n"}

{"id": "2045498", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2045498", "title": "Napier Commission", "text": "Napier Commission\n\nThe Napier Commission, officially the Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Condition of Crofters and Cottars in the Highlands and Islands was a royal commission and public inquiry into the condition of crofters and cottars in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland.\n\nThe commission was appointed in 1883, with Francis Napier, 10th Lord Napier, as its chairman, under William Gladstone's Liberal government of the United Kingdom. The Royal Commission had five other members and published its report, the \"Report of Her Majesty's Commissioners of Inquiry Into the Condition of the Crofters and Cottars in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland\", in 1884. The other members were:\n\nThe Commission was a response to crofter and cottar agitation in the Highlands of Scotland. The agitation was about excessively high rents, lack of security of tenure and deprivation of de facto rights of access to land. It took the form of rent strikes (withholding rent payments) and what came to be known as land raids (crofter occupation of land which landlords had given over to sheep farming and to hunting parks called deer forests). \"Crofters' War\" has been used since as a name for this agitation.\n\nIn the 1870s there had been sporadic short-lived agitations in Wester Ross and Lewis (then both in the county of Ross). In the early 1880s agitation began in Skye (then in the county of Inverness) and there it became persistent and threatened to spread throughout the Hebrides and the Highlands. Police forces attempted to enforce what landlords believed to be their rights, but the police were severely overstretched, especially in Inverness-shire, where William Ivory was Sheriff Principal. Agitation became therefore an issue needing the attention of central government and, eventually, Gladstone's government appointed the Napier Commission.\n\nAbout three years after the Commission's appointment the Crofters' Holdings (Scotland) Act, 1886 would be on the statute book. The Act was not based on the recommendations of the Commission, but the process by which the Commission collected evidence, and the Commission's report, did foster and inform the public, Parliamentary and Cabinet debate which led, eventually to the legislation. The legislation was based on principles accepted in the Irish Land Acts of 1870 and 1881, principles which Napier had implicitly rejected in 1884.\n\nAppointments to the Commission were made by the Home Secretary, Sir William Harcourt. In Napier himself the Commission had an amateur historian and anthropologist. In Nicolson and Mackinnon it had two members with good knowledge of Gaelic. Cameron and MacKenzie were obviously landlords, and Frazer-Mackintosh was an antiquarian who, as an MP, had made himself known as someone who was sympathetic to the crofters' cause. \n\nThe terms \"crofter\", \"cottar\" and \"Highlands and Islands\" all lacked clear definition, and the Commission was left to use its own judgement as when, where and from whom to take evidence. Napier was reluctant to include Caithness, which he regarded as '\"not inhabited by the Celtic race\". The Commission was aware however that the government wanted a fairly early report, rather than an exhaustive inquiry, in the hope that this itself would help to quell crofter agitation.\n\nThe Commission began its work in the Hebrides, where rent strikes and land raids were most prevalent. It took evidence from crofters, landlords and others, and it moved on to tour much of what is now regarded as the Highlands and Islands area. Evidence from crofters exhibited remarkably consistent rhetoric, and there were accusations of coaching from the Highland Land League. Equally there were accusations that any crofter daring to give evidence risked being singled out for reprisals from landlords.\n\nThe Commission was far from unanimous in its report. Many of the recommendations were those of Napier alone. For tenants whose holdings had rental values of more than £6 a year he proposed security of tenure in 30-year \"improving leases\" and \"township organisation\". For tenants whose holdings fell below the £6-a-year threshold he recommended voluntary assisted emigration. \"Improving lease\" means a lease which includes a programme of improvement for the holding. \"Townships\" were conceived as re-establishing communal management of grazing land.\n\nPublication of the report did bring some calm to the situation in the Highlands, but this was very short lived.\n\n"}
{"id": "2045508", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2045508", "title": "Harry Walker", "text": "Harry Walker\n\nHarry William Walker (October 22, 1918 – August 8, 1999) was an American professional baseball player, coach and manager. Known by the nickname \"Harry the Hat\", he played as a center fielder in Major League Baseball between 1940 and 1955, most notably as a member of the St. Louis Cardinals with whom he won two world championships and was the 1947 National League batting champion. A two-time All-Star player, Walker also played for the Philadelphia Phillies, Chicago Cubs and the Cincinnati Reds. After his playing career, he served as manager for three major league teams between 1955 and 1972. \n\nBorn in Pascagoula, Mississippi, Harry was a member of a distinguished baseball family. He was the son of former Washington Senators pitcher Ewart \"Dixie\" Walker and the brother of Fred \"Dixie\" Walker, like Harry an outfielder and National League batting champion. He was also the nephew of fellow Major League outfielder Ernie Walker. Harry stood tall and weighed . Like his father, brother and uncle, he batted left-handed and threw right-handed.\n\n\"Harry the Hat\" got his nickname from his habit during at-bats of continually adjusting his cap between pitches—there were no batting helmets in his day. His batting title came in , when he hit .363 in a season during which he was traded from his original team, the St. Louis Cardinals, to the Philadelphia Phillies. The previous year he was one of the stars of the Cardinals’ 1946 World Series championship team. In the decisive seventh game against the Boston Red Sox, with Enos Slaughter on first base, Harry doubled to left center and Slaughter, running on the pitch and taking advantage of a slow relay from the Red Sox' Johnny Pesky, scored from first base in a \"mad dash\" with the winning run. He knocked in six runs during that Series, and batted .412.\n\nHarry lacked his brother Dixie's power—he hit only ten home runs in 807 games played over all or parts of 11 seasons in the National League—but he compiled a .296 lifetime batting average and 786 hits with the Cards, Phils, Chicago Cubs and Cincinnati Reds and was to be famed throughout his coaching and managing career as a batting tutor. Harry and Dixie are the only brothers in MLB history to win batting titles, Dixie having captured the National League batting title with a .357 average in while playing for the Brooklyn Dodgers.\n\nAfter prepping as a skipper in the Cardinals’ minor league system beginning in 1951, Walker was called up from Rochester in the Triple-A International League on May 28, , to replace Eddie Stanky as Cardinals’ manager. Walker, then 36, was still a playing manager; he hit .444 in nine pinch hitting appearances in July and August. However, the change backfired: the Cards plummeted two places in the standings under Walker, losing 67 of 118 games. Harry was replaced by Fred Hutchinson at the end of the 1955 season, and it would be another decade before he would again manage in the majors.\n\nDuring that exile, he returned to the Cardinal farm system to manage (1956–58; 1963–64), and served four years (1959–62) as a St. Louis coach. After piloting the Jacksonville Suns to the 1964 International League pennant, Walker was hired by the Pittsburgh Pirates as manager, replacing Danny Murtaugh, who stepped down for health reasons. Although the Pirates did not win a pennant during Walker's first two seasons, he made an immediate impact. His skill as a batting coach was an important factor in the transformation of the Pirates into the National League's top offensive team. The Pirates battled for the pennant until the closing days of the and seasons—each year finishing third behind the champion Los Angeles Dodgers and the runner-up San Francisco Giants. But when the Pirates—further strengthened by an off-season trade for standout shortstop Maury Wills—stumbled to a disappointing .500 mark in mid-season, Walker was let go on July 18 in favor of his predecessor, Murtaugh. Less than a week later, Walker was hired to be the organizational batting coach for the Houston Astros.\nEleven months later, on June 18, , the Astros replaced skipper Grady Hatton with \"Harry the Hat\", still well known from his stint as manager of the Texas League's Houston Buffaloes during the late 1950s. The last-place Astros were only 23–38 under Hatton, but, featuring players like Joe Morgan, Jimmy Wynn, and Don Wilson, their record under Walker improved to 49–52. In , they contended for the National League West Division title before fading to finish 12 games behind the Atlanta Braves. After back-to-back 79–83 marks in and , Walker was sacked August 26, , in favor of Leo Durocher; with the Astros at 67–54 and in third place at the time of the firing, it was Walker's best season in Houston. Over his managing career, he won 630 games, losing 604 (.511). After his firing, Walker returned to the Cardinals as a hitting instructor.\n\nWalker served as the head baseball coach at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) from 1979 to 1986. He was the program's first coach. In ten seasons he compiled a record of 211-171, good for a .552 winning percentage. In 1981 the Blazers were the champions of the Sun Belt Conference's North Division in just the third year of the program's existence. The Blazers repeated as North Division champions in 1982.\n\nWalker was profiled positively in Jim Bouton's memoir of the 1969 season, \"Ball Four\". In the book, Walker is seen as a knowledgeable manager who has good advice for his charges. Although many of the players complain that Walker talks too much, Bouton is careful to point out that Walker always makes a good point and has good advice. This is notable because Bouton was unafraid to show his earlier manager, Joe Schultz, in a much less flattering light. Bouton even tells a humorous story of how Walker himself would follow the advice he always gave when he played in an old timer's game. The players jokingly would yell tips that Walker always said, such as \"hit the ball up the middle.\" Walker would then proceed to single up the middle, then break up the double play, prompting Astro third baseman Doug Rader to remark, \"Son of a bitch. Every year Harry gets a hit up the middle and breaks up the double play.\"\n\nWalker died in Birmingham, Alabama, at the age of 80. His interment was located at Cedar Grove Cemetery in Leeds.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2045517", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2045517", "title": "Institute of Pacific Relations", "text": "Institute of Pacific Relations\n\nThe Institute of Pacific Relations (IPR) was an international NGO established in 1925 to provide a forum for discussion of problems and relations between nations of the Pacific Rim. The International Secretariat, the center of most IPR activity over the years, consisted of professional staff members who recommended policy to the Pacific Council and administered the international program. The various national councils were responsible for national, regional and local programming. Most participants were elite members of the business and academic communities in their respective countries. Funding came largely from businesses and philanthropies, especially the Rockefeller Foundation. IPR international headquarters were in Honolulu until the early 1930s when they were moved to New York and the American Council emerged as the dominant national council.\n\nIPR was founded in the spirit of Wilsonianism, an awareness of the United States' new role as a world power after World War I, and a belief that liberal democracy should be promoted throughout the world. To promote greater knowledge of issues, the IPR supported conferences, research projects and publications, and after 1932 published a quarterly journal \"Pacific Affairs\". After World War II, Cold War charges that the IPR was infiltrated with Communists led to Congressional hearings and loss of tax exempt status. Many IPR members had liberal left orientations typical of internationalists of the 1930s, some ten IPR associates were shown to have been Communists, others were sympathetic to the Soviet Union, and the anti-imperialist tone of the leadership aroused resentment from some of the colonial powers, but the more dramatic charges, such as that the IPR was responsible for the fall of China, have not been generally accepted.\n\nThe IPR was the result of two sets of organizers, one in New York, another in Hawai'i. The New York-based effort was organized by Edward C. Carter, after graduating from Harvard in 1906, joined the Student Volunteer Movement with the YMCA in India, then worked with the Y in France during World War I. After the war he joined The Inquiry, a liberal Protestant commission with a flavor both genteel and militant which organized conferences and publications on labor, race relations, business ethics, and international peace. Among Carter's constituents were John D. Rockefeller, III, Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, daughter of the Rhode Island U.S. Senator, and Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur, President of Stanford University. Wilbur argued that a new organization devoted to Pacific affairs would fill a gap not addressed by East Coast foreign policy groups. Meanwhile, in Hawai'i, another group was organizing under the leadership of local business interests.\n\nNot everyone approved. Time Magazine called Carter, Wilbur, and The Inquiry a \"strange and motley crew\", a \"little band of élite and erudite adventurers.\" Some in the American State Department and Navy opposed discussion of Pacific affairs, fearing that it might interfere with strategic planning at a time when Chinese and Japanese nationalism were on the rise. Carter countered with support from the Rockefeller Foundation and the Carnegie Foundation. Using networks of the International YMCA, independent National Councils were organized in other countries, with an International Secretariat in Honolulu.\n\nThe first conference was held in Honolulu in the summer of 1925, followed by another in Honolulu (1927), then conferences in Kyoto (1929), Hangzhou and Shanghai (1931), Banff, Canada (1933), Yosemite, USA (1936), and Virginia Beach, USA (1939). Each conference published its background papers and roundtable discussions in a volume in the series \"Problems of the Pacific\".\n\nEdward Carter took responsibility for the American Council. When he became Secretary General in 1933 he lobbied successfully to have the International Headquarters move to New York. Since 1928 his chief assistant had been Frederick V. Field, who worked with him until 1940. (Field was later attacked for his Communist allegiances: see below.) The American Council moved energetically on several fronts. One of Carter's concerns was that public opinion needed to be informed and school curriculum deepened. Another area was to commission or subsidize scholarship on all aspects of Asia. Over the next decades, the IPR imprint appeared on hundreds of books, including most of the important scholarship on China, Japan, and Southeast Asia. Notable was the Chinese Dynastic History Project, headed by the German refugee scholar Karl Wittfogel, which set out to translate and annotate the official histories compiled by each Chinese dynasty for its predecessor. In 1932, the IPR determined to expand its Bulletin into a full-fledged journal, Pacific Affairs. At the recommendation of longtime treaty port journalist H.G.E. Woodhead, Carter recruited Owen Lattimore, a multi-sided scholar of Central Asia who, however, did not have a Ph.D.\n\nThe IPR aimed to include all of the countries of the Pacific, including colonies, such as the Philippines and Korea (the Dutch government forbade participation from the Dutch East Indies), and the Soviet Union. As friction between Japan and China became more intense, the IPR became more overtly political. In 1931, the Japanese invasion forced the conference to move from Hangzhou to Shanghai. In 1932, the Japanese delegation withdrew and succeeding conferences were held without Japanese representation. Since the USSR was a longtime rival of Japan and a revolutionary Marxist power, Soviet participation raised many questions and problems. Marxist analysis, such as that brought by Wittfogel, was considered by some to add a powerful tool for understanding Chinese history, but Stalin's interest was scarcely limited to discussions and theories. Carter's sympathy for the Soviet Union led him to defend Stalin's purges and trials, although IPR publications contained both favorable and critical treatments of Soviet policies.\n\nThe IPR sponsored other important scholarly excursions into Asian history and society: R.H. Tawney's long memo for the 1931 Conference was published as his \"Land and Labor in China\" (1931); a Marxist analysis of geography by Chi Ch'ao-ting; the collaboration between Lattimore and Wittfogel which used an eclectic array of approaches including Arnold Toynbee, Ellsworth Huntington, and Karl Marx to develop a social history of China.\n\nDuring World War II, the IPR organized two conferences, one at Mont Tremblant, Quebec, in December 1942 and the second in Hot Springs, Virginia in January 1945. One scholar noted that the non-official nature of these meetings meant that officials and influential leaders could join in the fray in an ostensibly private capacity, which \"gave the I.P.R. a status well beyond its actual size.\" Colonial issues, economic issues and post-war planning were the major areas of controversy. The Americans demanded that European colonial markets be opened to American goods by the removal of preference tariffs while the British expressed concerns that American economic might could be used as a \"potential bludgeon\". Another example was Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit of India, asserting that the conflict in Asia was a race war, and other members of the conference from Asia warned that too harsh a treatment of Japan would lead to anti-Western feeling throughout the Far East.\n\nAt the roundtables, there was criticism as well as doubt that British would follow the Atlantic Charter. The British pointed out that high-flown ideas were being pushed on them while American willingness to apply the same ideals within its own borders was questionable. Those in the International Secretariat were suspicious and critical of the British, noting that the delegation from India was more British than the British. Those representing American interests repeatedly insisted they were not fighting in order to reconstitute the British Empire; the representatives of the British concern replied that they would \"not be hustled out of evolution into revolution,\" and that the US might \"do well to look into her own Negro problem.\"\n\nAs part of IPR’s lasting impact in the region, the conferences helped to focus on the political and social developments within Japan after the war, especially the question of whether to abolish the imperial throne. Edward Carter summarized Anglo-American differences and fears: \"continuing imperialism as a threat to world peace\", on the one hand, and of \"anti-colonialism as a recipe for chaos\" on the other, and of \"imperial tariff protections as a barrier to world trade and of American economic might as a potential bludgeon.\" Some have suggested that Carter left the Secretary General position in late 1945 because of pressure from the European council leaders due to his increasingly outspoken anti-colonialism.\n\nAt home, the American Secretariat came under criticism.\n\nToward the end of the war, the Institute came under criticism for alleged communist sympathies. The first major criticism of the Institute was a wartime study by dissident IPR member Alfred Kohlberg, an American who had owned a textile firm in prewar China. After finding what he believed were Communist sympathies in IPR, in particular Frederick Vanderbilt Field, Kohlberg first wrote to other members of the Board, published an 80-page report, then launched a publicity campaign against the Institute.\n\nThe IPR came under further suspicion by government authorities as a result of the Venona intercepts and its close association with Amerasia. Amerasia came under investigation when a classified OSS report appeared as an article in the magazine.\n\nIPR was closely allied with \"Amerasia\". The two organizations shared the same building, and many members of the Editorial Board of \"Amerasia\" were officers or employees of IPR. An FBI review of \"Amerasia\" and IPR publications found that approximately 115 people contributed articles to both.\nThe Committee for a Democratic Far Eastern Policy was also housed in this building.\n\nAmong IPR staffers claimed to be Communists or collaborators with Soviet intelligence agents were Kathleen Barnes, Hilda Austern, Elsie Fairfax-Cholmely, Chi Chao-ting, Guenter Stein, Harriet Levine, Talitha Gerlach, Chen Han-seng (a member of the Sorge spy ring), Michael Greenberg (named as a source in 1945 by defecting Soviet courier Elizabeth Bentley), and T.A. Bisson (Venona's \"Arthur\"), as well as Kate Mitchell and Andrew Roth, both of whom were arrested in the 1945 \"Amerasia\" case.\n\nAfter the success of the Chinese Communist Revolution, criticism of the IPR increased. Its detractors accused it of having helped to \"lose China\" to Communism.\n\nIn the early fifties, the IPR came under a lengthy investigation by the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee. Critics charged that IPR scholars had been naïve in their statements regarding Communism, Chinese Communism and Stalinist Russia.\n\nSenator Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin repeatedly criticized IPR and its former chairman Philip Jessup. McCarthy observed that Frederick V. Field, T.A. Bisson, and Owen Lattimore were active in IPR and claimed that they had worked to turn American China policy in favor of the Communist Party of China.\n\nIn 1952, the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee (SISS), chaired by Senator Pat McCarran, spent over a year reviewing some 20,000 documents from the files of IPR and questioning IPR personnel. The committee found it suspicious that Marxists had published articles in the IPR journal and that Communists had attended an IPR conference in 1942. In its final report the SISS stated:\n\nThe IPR itself was like a specialized political flypaper in its attractive power for Communists ...The IPR has been considered by the American Communist Party and by Soviet officials as an instrument of Communist policy, propaganda and military intelligence. The IPR disseminated and sought to popularize false information including information originating from Soviet and Communist sources... The IPR was a vehicle used by the Communists to orient American far eastern policies toward Communist objectives.\n\nElizabeth Bentley testified that NKVD spy chief Jacob Golos warned her to stay away from the IPR because it was \"as red as a rose, and you shouldn't touch it with a 10-foot pole.\" Likewise, Louis Budenz, former editor of the \"Daily Worker\", testified that Alexander Trachtenberg of the Communist Party-affiliated International Publishers told him that party leaders thought the IPR was \"too much a concentration point for Communists; the control could be maintained without such a galaxy of Communists in it.\"\n\nThe IPR lost its tax-exempt status as an educational body in 1955, when the Internal Revenue Service alleged that the Institute had engaged in the dissemination of controversial and partisan propaganda, and had attempted to influence the policies or opinions of the government. Under the leadership of William L. Holland, the IPR pursued a long legal action to regain tax-exempt status, which lasted until 1959. The final court judgment rejected all allegations by the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nBy the mid-1950s, the IPR was facing other challenges – notably the development of well-funded centers for Asian Studies at major American universities such as Harvard, Yale, Berkeley, Michigan and Columbia. The rise of these centers created an opinion that the IPR was no longer necessary. The large foundations which had previously supported the IPR shifted their financial resources to the university centers.\n\nAt the end of the IRS case, a degree of financial support that the Institute had attracted due to free speech issues and the IRS case was lost to other causes. The IPR also had been gradually losing academic contributors due in part to the rise of the Association for Asian Studies.\n\nThe Institute dissolved in 1960. Publication of the journal \"Pacific Affairs\" was transferred to University of British Columbia, in Vancouver, Canada.\n\nA few years later two successor organizations were established, the Pacific Basin Economic Council, an organization of regional business leaders founded in 1967, and the more academic Pacific Trade and Development Conference (PAFTAD) in 1968.\n\nThe International Secretariat had a publishing program that included a Research Series, an Inquiry Series, and a quarterly journal, \"Pacific Affairs\". The American Council participated in this program.\n\nThe American Council published two periodicals of their own, a fortnightly journal \"Far Eastern Affairs\" and the biweekly \"Imparel\", a mimeographed summary of the news issued by the San Francisco Bay Region Division. The Council additionally published research volumes as a part of their \"Studies of the Pacific\" series, and more popular studies under their \"Far Eastern Pamphlets\" series.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2045528", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2045528", "title": "Ashcan comic", "text": "Ashcan comic\n\nAn ashcan comic is an American comic book originally created solely to establish trademarks on potential titles and not intended for sale. The practice was common in the 1930s and 1940s when the comic book industry was in its infancy, but was phased out after updates to US trademark law. The term was revived in the 1980s by Bob Burden, who applied it to prototypes of his self-published comic book. Since the 1990s, the term has been used to describe promotional materials produced in large print runs and made available for mass consumption. In the film and television industries, the term 'ashcan copy' has been adopted for low-grade material created to preserve a claim to licensed property rights.\n\nThe modern comic book was created in the 1930s, and grew rapidly in popularity. In the competition to secure trademarks on titles intended to sound thrilling, publishers including All-American Publications and Fawcett Comics developed the ashcan edition, which was the same size as regular comics and usually had a black and white cover. Typically, cover art was recycled from previous publications with a new title pasted to it. Interior artwork ranged from previously published material in full color to unfinished pencils without word balloons. Some ashcans were only covers with no interior pages. Production quality on these works range from being hand-stapled with untrimmed pages to machine-stapled and machine trimmed. Once the practice was established, DC Comics used ashcans more frequently than any other publisher. Not all the titles secured through ashcan editions were actually used for regular publications.\n\nThe purpose of the ashcan editions was to fool the US Patent & Trademark Office into believing the book had actually been published. Clerks at the office would accept the hastily produced material as legitimate, granting the submitting publisher a trademark to the title. Since the ashcans had no other use, publishers printed as few as two copies; one was sent to the Trademark Office, the other was kept for their files. Occasionally, publishers would send copies to distributors or wholesalers by registered mail to further establish publication dates, but nearly all ashcan comic editions were limited to five copies or fewer.\n\nAt the time, garbage cans were commonly called \"ash cans\" because they were used to hold soot and ash from wood and coal heating systems. The term was applied to these editions of comics because they had no value and were meant to be thrown away after being accepted by the Trademark Office. Some spare copies were given to editors, employees, and visitors to keep as souvenirs. Changes to the United States trademark law in 1946 allowed publishers to register a trademark with an intent to use instead of a finished product, and the practice of creating and submitting ashcans was abandoned when publishers began to consider it an unnecessary effort lawyers used to justify a fee. Because of their rarity, ashcans from this era are desired by collectors and often fetch a high price.\n\nIn 1984, Golden Age comic book collector and dealer Bob Burden created \"Flaming Carrot Comics\", published by Aardvark-Vanaheim. For each issue, Burden had magazine-sized prototype editions printed and shared them with friends and people who assisted with production. Some were also sent to retailers as advance previews to generate interest in his comic. Fewer than forty copies of each prototype were made, and Burden described them as ashcans.\n\nIn 1992, comic creator Rob Liefeld applied the term to two digest-sized prototype versions of \"Youngblood\" #1, but this ashcan was created for mass release. Instead of denoting the material as worthless, Liefeld's usage implied rarity and collectability. This ashcan was the first publication from Image Comics, a publisher started by popular artists during a boom period for comic books. The sales success of the \"Youngblood\" ashcans prompted imitation, and for the next year nearly every new Image series had a corresponding ashcan. Typical print run for Image ashcans was between 500 and 5,000. Soon, other publishers began releasing ashcans in a variety of sizes and formats. In 1993, Triumphant Comics advertised ashcan editions of new properties with print runs of 50,000.\n\nFollowing the collapse of the speculation market in comics in the mid-1990s, the term has been used by publishers to describe booklets promoting upcoming comics. Established publishers such as Dark Horse Comics, IDW Publishing, and DC Comics continue to use ashcan copies as part of their marketing plan for new titles. Aspiring creators also apply the term to hand-stapled photocopied books they use to demonstrate their abilities to hiring editors at comic book conventions or as part of a submissions package.\n\nThe term has been appropriated by the film and television industries to refer to low-quality material made specifically to preserve rights to a licensed character, which often expire if unused for a set period of time. One of the earliest examples of this practice is the 1967 animated adaptation of \"The Hobbit\". Other prominent examples include the 2011 \"\", a 2015 adaptation of \"The Wheel of Time\", and the unreleased \"Fantastic Four\" film from 1994.\n\n"}

{"id": "2045530", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2045530", "title": "Ervin Santana", "text": "Ervin Santana\n\nErvin Ramon Santana (born Johan Ramon Santana; December 12, 1982) is a Dominican professional baseball pitcher who is a free agent. He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Los Angeles Angels, Kansas City Royals, Atlanta Braves, Minnesota Twins, and Chicago White Sox. Santana is a two-time All-Star, and he threw a no-hitter with the Angels in 2011.\n\nSantana was born Johan Ramon Santana, and used that name until 2003. He changed his name to avoid having the same name as Venezuelan pitching star Johan Santana. According to Santana, \"I just came up with Ervin... Ervin Santana, that sounds good.\"\n\nSantana signed with the Anaheim Angels as an amateur free agent on September 2, 2000. He was a starting pitcher for the Angels' Double-A affiliate, the Arkansas Travelers early in 2005, where he posted a 5–1 record and 2.31 ERA in 7 starts. Following an injury to Angels starting pitcher Kelvim Escobar, Santana earned a promotion. He made his first major league appearance on May 17, 2005, against the Cleveland Indians, in which he gave up the pitching version of the cycle in first four batters that he faced. In his second start, facing the Chicago White Sox's Jon Garland, (who at the time had the best record in baseball), Santana bested Garland by pitching a complete game shutout. He gave up only 5 hits and struck out 7 for his first career victory. Santana then went on the disabled list and was sent back down to the minors to the Angels' Triple-A affiliate, the Salt Lake Bees.\n\nAfter Escobar's elbow problems became a recurring problem, he was placed back on the DL and Santana received his second call-up to the majors. He pitched well enough to earn a spot on the playoff roster, but was initially left out of the four-man rotation. In the pivotal Game 5 of the American League Division Series of the playoffs against the New York Yankees, Angels ace Bartolo Colón went out with a shoulder injury in the second inning. Santana filled in as the long reliever, and pitched 5-1/3 innings to earn his first playoff win in his first appearance.\nHis short rookie season with the Angels ended with 12 wins in the regular season. In the 2006 season, he finished with a 16–8 record. After a disappointing start to the 2007 season where he went 5–11 with a 6.22 ERA, he was optioned to Triple-A Salt Lake Bees on July 18, 2007. He was recalled by the Angels on August 17, and regained his spot in the starting rotation.\n\nOn April 30, 2008, Santana equaled an Angels record with a 5–0 start to the season. He joined Angels legend Frank Tanana and teammate Joe Saunders, who equaled Tanana the day before. Santana was 11–3 with a 3.34 ERA at the All-Star Break. Pitching in the 2008 MLB All-Star Game, Santana gave up a fifth inning homer to Matt Holliday of the Colorado Rockies.\n\nOn September 22, 2008, Santana pitched against the Seattle Mariners, going 8 innings, allowing 5 hits, 1 earned run, and striking out 9 en route to his career-high tying 16th win of the season. He finished the season with a career-high 214 strikeouts, good for second in the American League behind A.J. Burnett, while pitching to a 3.49 ERA in 219 innings across 32 starts. On October 3, he gave up 4 runs in the first inning and 5 total in 5 1/3 innings against the Boston Red Sox in Game 2 of the ALDS. He finished tied for sixth in the voting for the American League Cy Young Award with Mike Mussina.\n\nSantana started out the 2009 season on the disabled list. In his first game of the season, he received a no-decision against the Boston Red Sox. After struggling with a disappointing 8.35 ERA, the Angels placed him on the disabled list.\n\nOn September 28, 2009, Santana pitched a complete game shutout, becoming the first pitcher in franchise history to pitch a shutout in a game to clinch the Western Division. In 2010, despite the Angels finishing two games under .500, he finished the season with a 17–10 record and a 3.92 ERA with 169 strikeouts in 222⅔ innings, tying a career high with 4 complete games.\n\nOn July 27, 2011, Ervin Santana pitched a no-hitter against the Cleveland Indians. It was Santana's first career no-hitter, and the Angels first no-hitter since 1990. It was also Ervin Santana's first victory against the Cleveland Indians in 11 career starts. He struck out 10, walked 1, and allowed 1 unearned run. At the end of the 2011 season, Santana pitched a career-best 3.38 ERA and an 11–12 record in 228⅔ innings.\n\nIn 2012, Santana struggled throughout the season, posting an ERA of 5.16 in 30 starts. Despite posting an ERA over 5, Santana's WHIP stood reasonably low, registering at 1.27 with 165 hits allowed in 178 innings. He surrendered a career high 39 home runs, which led the majors for the 2012 season.\n\nOn October 31, 2012, Santana was traded to the Kansas City Royals in exchange for left-handed minor league reliever Brandon Sisk. The Angels picked up the $13 million option on Santana prior to making the trade, and agreed to cover an undisclosed portion of that amount for the Royals. Santana earned his 100th career win on June 8, 2013, against the Houston Astros. In 32 starts with the Royals, he was 9–10 with a 3.24 ERA (a career-best) with 161 strikeouts in 211 innings. The Royals made a $14.1 million qualifying offer to him after the season, but he turned it down and became a free agent.\n\nBecause of Santana's rejection of the Royals' offer, any team that signed him for 2014 would have to surrender a draft pick. As a result of that and some concerns about his long term health and his reported contract demands, Santana did not sign with any teams before spring training began. As spring training continued, Santana fired his agent and changed his contract demands to a one-year deal near what his rejected qualifying offer was.\nSantana proceeded to negotiate with the Toronto Blue Jays, and verbally agreed to a contract but stalled signing it for several days. Following an injury to Kris Medlen of the Atlanta Braves, Santana immediately agreed to terms identical to the Blue Jays' reported offer of $14.1 million for one season. Santana's first year in the NL was mixed as he posted an ERA of 3.94 with the Braves in 31 starts. He surrendered a career-low 16 home runs in 196 innings while going 14–10 and striking out 179 batters.\n\nOn December 12, 2014, Santana signed with the Minnesota Twins on a four-year, $54 million deal with an option for a fifth year. On April 3, MLB announced that Santana would be suspended for 80 games after testing positive for Stanozolol, a performance-enhancing drug. On July 5, 2015, Santana was activated from his 80-game suspension and made his season debut against his former team, the Kansas City Royals. After finishing with a 7–5 record and a 4.00 ERA in 2015, Santana served as the ace of the Twins rotation during a disappointing 2016 season for the team. Despite a 7–11 record, largely due to poor run support, Santana finished with a strong 3.38 ERA in 181 innings pitched (30 starts).\n\nSantana represented Team Dominican Republic at the 2017 World Baseball Classic.\n\nOn April 3, 2017, Santana was the starting pitcher on Opening Day against the Kansas City Royals. He pitched seven innings, and earned the win while only allowing one run (a solo homer) and two hits. On April 15 Santana pitched a complete game one hit shutout against the White Sox, he struck out eight and walked one batter. Santana pitched another shutout against the Baltimore Orioles on May 23, followed by a third complete game shutout against the San Francisco Giants in which he threw just 91 pitches. Santana became the first pitcher in the American League to record three complete game shutouts in a season since Rick Porcello in 2014, and the first to do so prior to the All-Star break since Justin Masterson in 2013. On July 2 he was named to his second All-Star team and his first since 2008. At that time Santana had a 10–5 record with a 3.07 ERA in 111⅓ innings, while limiting opponents to a .204 batting average, second in the American League behind Chris Sale. On August 29, Santana became the 90th pitcher in history to hit 100 career batters. He finished the season 16–8 with a 3.28 ERA and 1.13 WHIP in innings, notching 167 strikeouts against 61 walks, while pacing the lead in the Major Leagues with 5 complete games (3 shutouts). He also had the lowest line drive percentage allowed (16.3%) of all major league pitchers. On November 15, Santana finished seventh in the voting for the Cy Young Award, receiving three fifth place votes. It marked the first time since 2008 Santana received Cy Young votes.\n\nOn February 6, 2018, Santana underwent surgery on his middle finger, delaying his season by 10 to 12 weeks. He had discomfort in the finger since the previous season, but there was no serious damage. The surgery was a capsular release/debridement procedure to his MCP joint. Due to this and other injuries, Santana was limited to 5 starts on the season. The Twins declined his contract option and made him a free agent on October 30, 2018.\n\nOn February 22, 2019, Santana signed a minor league deal with the Chicago White Sox, earning a $4.3 million salary for his time with the major league team. The White Sox selected his contract on April 9, and he made his White Sox debut that day. On April 26, 2019 Santana was designated for assignment. Santana elected free agency on April 29.\n\nOn May 24, Santana signed a minor league deal with the New York Mets. He elected free agency following the 2019 season.\n\nSantana and his wife, Amy, married in 2009. They have a son, Jonathan, and a daughter, Sofia.\n\n\n"}

It was previously known as Rhus vernix. This plant is also known as thunderwood, particularly where it occurs in the southern United States. All parts of the plant contain a resin called urushiol that causes skin and mucous membrane irritation to humans. When the plant is burned, inhalation of the smoke may cause the rash to appear on the lining of the lungs, causing extreme pain and possibly fatal respiratory difficulty.\n\nPoison sumac is a shrub or small tree, growing up to nearly in height. Each pinnate leaf has 7–13 leaflets, each of which is long. These are oval-to-oblong; acuminate (tapering to a sharp point); cuneate (wedge-shaped) at the base; undulate (wavy-edged); with an underside that is glabrous (hairless) or slightly pubescent (down-like hair) beneath. The stems along the leaflets are red and the leaves can have a reddish tint to them, particularly at the top of the plant. New bark for a poison sumac tree is lightish gray, and as the bark ages, it becomes darker.\n\nIts flowers are greenish, growing in loose axillary panicles (clusters) long. The fruits are subglobose (not quite spherical), whitish-gray, flattened, and about across; these are eaten by birds.\n\nPoison sumac fruit are creamy white and part of a cluster. Typically, they are around in size.\n\nThe fruit and leaves of the poison sumac plant contain urushiol, an oil that causes an allergic rash upon contact with skin. They are, however, not toxic to birds or other animals, and eaten by them when other food is scarce, especially in winter.\n\nPoison sumac grows exclusively in wet and clay soils, usually in swamps and peat bogs, in the eastern United States and extreme southeast Canada.\n\nIn terms of its potential to cause urushiol-induced contact dermatitis, poison sumac is more toxic than its relatives poison ivy and poison oak. According to some botanists, poison sumac is the most toxic plant species in the United States (Frankel, 1991).\n\nThe differences in toxicity in poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac are due to differences in the side chains of the chemicals in these plants. In general, poison ivy has a C side chain, poison oak has a C side chain and poison sumac has a C side chain.\n\nThe dermatitis shows itself in painful and long continued swellings and eruptions. In the worst case, smoke inhaled by burning poison sumac leads to life-threatening pulmonary edema whereby fluid enters the alveoli.\n\n\n\n"}

Knaak set in Blizzard Entertainment's popular video game universe, Warcraft.\n\nThe first book in the series was given away as a promotion for pre-ordering World of Warcraft from Best Buy. The book was packaged in a standard PC game box.\n\nThe trilogy takes place ten millennia before the first \"Warcraft\" games, during the Burning Legion's first invasion of Azeroth. The storyline proceeds to expand the depth of the Night Elves past, and leads up to the Sundering of Kalimdor. Whilst this storyline was detailed in brief in the past, the trilogy involves time travel back to the past, causing the way events unfolded in this era of time to be changed permanently.\n\nThis series contains three books:\n\nThis series comes after the Warcraft book: \"Day of the Dragon\", but the majority of the story in the new series is set well in the past from the events of the previous book. It also builds on the storyline of many of the Night Elf characters from the Warcraft series.\n\nMany months have passed since the cataclysmic Battle of Mount Hyjal, where the demonic Burning Legion was banished from Azeroth forever. But now, a mysterious energy rift within the mountains of Kalimdor propels three former warriors into the distant past - a time long before orcs, humans or even high elves roamed the land. A time when the Dark Titan, Sargeras, and his demon pawns persuaded Queen Azshara and her Highborne to cleanse Azeroth of its lesser races. A time when the Dragon Aspects were at the height of their power - unaware that one of their own would soon usher in an age of darkness that would engulf the World of Warcraft.\n\nIn the first chapter of this epic trilogy, the outcome of the historic War of the Ancients is forever altered by the arrival of three time-lost heroes: Krasus, the dragon mage whose great powers and memory of the ancient conflict have inexplicably diminished; the human wizard Rhonin, whose thoughts are divided between his family and the seductive source of his growing power; and Broxigar, a weathered orc veteran who seeks an honorable death in combat. But unless the unlikely allies can convince the demigod, Cenarius, and the untrusting night elves of their queen's treachery, the Burning Legion's gateway into Azeroth will open anew. And this time - the struggles of the past may well spill over into the future...\n\nLed by the mighty Archimonde, scores of demonic soldiers now march across the lands of Kalimdor, leaving a trail of death and devastation in their wake. At the heart of the fiery invasion stands the mystic Well of Eternity—once the source of the Night Elves' arcane power. But now the Well's energies have been defiled and twisted, for Queen Azshara and her Highborne will stop at nothing to commune with their newfound god: the fiery Lord of the Burning Legion... Sargeras.\n\nThe night elf defenders, led by the young druid, Malfurion Stormrage, and the wizard, Krasus, fight a desperate battle to hold back the Legion's terrible onslaught. Though only embers of hope remain, an ancient power has risen to aid the world in its darkest hour. The dragons—led by the powerful Aspect, Neltharion—have forged a weapon of incalculable power: the Dragon Soul, an artifact capable of driving the Legion from the world forever. But its use may cost far more than any could have foreseen.\n\nThe valiant night elves have been shattered by the loss of their beloved general. The black dragon, Neltharion, has claimed the Demon Soul and scattered the mighty dragonflights to the winds. Above all, the demonlord, Archimonde, has led the Burning Legion to the very brink of victory over Kalimdor. As the land and its denizens reel from this unstoppable evil, a terror beyond all reckoning draws ever nearer from the Well of Eternity's depths...\n\nIn the final, apocalyptic chapter of this epic trilogy, the dragon-mage Krasus and the young druid Malfurion must risk everything to save Azeroth from utter destruction. Banding together the dwarves, tauren and furbolg races, the heroes hope to spark an alliance to stand against the might of the Burning Legion. For if the Demon Soul should fall into the Legion's hands, all hope for the world will be lost. This then, is the hour... where past and future collide!\n"}

{"id": "2045565", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2045565", "title": "Cataclysmic pole shift hypothesis", "text": "Cataclysmic pole shift hypothesis\n\nThe cataclysmic pole shift hypothesis is a fringe theory suggesting that there have been geologically rapid shifts in the relative positions of the modern-day geographic locations of the poles and the axis of rotation of the Earth, creating calamities such as floods and tectonic events.\n\nThere is evidence of precession and changes in axial tilt, but this change is on much longer time-scales and does not involve relative motion of the spin axis with respect to the planet. However, in what is known as true polar wander, the solid Earth can rotate with respect to a fixed spin axis. Research shows that during the last 200 million years a total true polar wander of some 30° has occurred, but that no super-rapid shifts in the Earth's pole were found during this period. A characteristic rate of true polar wander is 1° or less per million years. Between approximately 790 and 810 million years ago, when the supercontinent Rodinia existed, two geologically rapid phases of true polar wander may have occurred. In each of these, the magnetic poles of the Earth shifted by approximately 55° – from a large shift in the crust.\n\nThe geographic poles are defined by the points on the surface of the Earth that are intersected by the axis of rotation. The pole shift hypothesis describes a change in location of these poles with respect to the underlying surface – a phenomenon distinct from the changes in axial orientation with respect to the plane of the ecliptic that are caused by precession and nutation, and is an amplified event of a true polar wander.\n\nPole shift hypotheses are not connected with plate tectonics, the well-accepted geological theory that the Earth's surface consists of solid plates which shift over a viscous, or semifluid asthenosphere; nor with continental drift, the corollary to plate tectonics which maintains that locations of the continents have moved slowly over the face of the Earth, resulting in the gradual emerging and breakup of continents and oceans over hundreds of millions of years.\n\nPole shift hypotheses are not the same as geomagnetic reversal, the periodic reversal of the Earth's magnetic field (effectively switching the north and south magnetic poles).\n\nIn popular literature, many conjectures have been suggested involving very rapid polar shift. A slow shift in the poles would display the most minor alterations and no destruction. A more dramatic view assumes more rapid changes, with dramatic alterations of geography and localized areas of destruction due to earthquakes and tsunamis.\n\nAn early mention of a shifting of the Earth's axis can be found in an 1872 article entitled \"Chronologie historique des Mexicains\" by Charles Étienne Brasseur de Bourbourg, a specialist in Mesoamerican codices who interpreted ancient Mexican myths as evidence for four periods of global cataclysms that had begun around 10,500 BCE.\nIn 1889, Jules Verne imagined the possible consequences of artificial pole shift. \nIn 1948, Hugh Auchincloss Brown, an electrical engineer, advanced a hypothesis of catastrophic pole shift. Brown also argued that accumulation of ice at the poles caused recurring tipping of the axis, identifying cycles of approximately seven millennia.\n\nIn his controversial 1950 work \"Worlds in Collision\", Immanuel Velikovsky postulated that the planet Venus emerged from Jupiter as a comet. During two proposed near approaches in about 1,450 BCE, he suggested that the direction of the Earth's rotation was changed radically, then reverted to its original direction on the next pass. This disruption supposedly caused earthquakes, tsunamis, and the parting of the Red Sea. Further, he said near misses by Mars between 776 and 687 BCE also caused the Earth's axis to change back and forth by ten degrees. Velikovsky cited historical records in support of his work, although his studies were generally ridiculed by the scientific community.\n\nCharles Hapgood is now perhaps the best remembered early proponent. In his books \"The Earth's Shifting Crust\" (1958) (which includes a foreword by Albert Einstein) and \"Path of the Pole\" (1970), Hapgood speculated that accumulated polar ice mass destabilizes the Earth's rotation, causing crustal displacement but not disturbing the Earth's axial orientation. Hapgood argued that shifts (of no more than 40 degrees) occurred about every 5,000 years, interrupting 20,000- to 30,000-year periods of polar stability. He cited recent North Pole locations in Hudson Bay (60°N, 73°W), the Atlantic Ocean between Iceland and Norway (72°N, 10°E) and the Yukon (63°N, 135°W). However, in his subsequent work \"The Path of the Pole\", Hapgood conceded Einstein's point that the weight of the polar ice is insufficient to cause polar shift. Instead, Hapgood argued that causative forces must be located below the surface. Hapgood encouraged Canadian librarian Rand Flem-Ath to pursue scientific evidence backing Hapgood's claims. Flem-Ath published the results of this work in 1995 in \"When the Sky Fell\" co-written with his wife Rose.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Chan Thomas wrote a book titled \"The Adam and Eve Story\" and attempted to have it published by Emerson House in Los Angeles. However, before actually being published, the CIA censored his book for 50 years. Thomas later published a shorter version of his original book in 1993 through Bengal Tiger Press. Coincidence theorists filed an FOIA lawsuit against the CIA to release the book. In 2013, the CIA released a shorter version of the original book (50 pages out of 240 original pages).\n\nIn 1974 Flavio Barbiero, an engineer and explorer, theorized that shifting of the Earth's axis took place 11,000 years ago and caused what was subsequently recorded in myth as the destruction of Atlantis and Mu. He suggested that shifting was probably caused by the impact of a comet on the Earth's surface and that the current position of Atlantis has to be sought under the Antarctic ice sheet.\n\nSeveral authors have offered pseudoscientific arguments for the hypothesis, including journalist and New Age enthusiast Ruth Shick Montgomery, Skeptics counter that these works combine speculation, the work of psychics, and modern folklore, while largely avoiding any effort at basic science by trying to disprove their own theory.\n\nWhile there are reputable studies showing that true polar wander has occurred at various times in the past, the rates are much smaller (1° per million years or slower) than predicted by the pole shift hypothesis (up to 1° per thousand years). Analysis of the evidence does not lend credence to Hapgood's hypothesized rapid displacement of layers of the Earth.\nData indicates that the geographical poles have not deviated by more than about 5° over the last 130 million years, contradicting the hypothesis of a cataclysmic polar wander event.\nMore rapid past possible occurrences of true polar wander have been measured: from 790 to 810 million years ago, true polar wander of approximately 55° may have occurred twice.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2045576", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2045576", "title": "Blue wall of silence", "text": "Blue wall of silence\n\nThe blue wall of silence, also blue code and blue shield, are terms used in the United States to denote the informal rule among police officers not to report on a colleague's errors, misconducts, or crimes, including police brutality. If questioned about an incident of alleged misconduct involving another officer (\"e.g.,\" during the course of an official inquiry), while following the code, the officer being questioned would claim ignorance of another officer's wrongdoing or claim to have not seen anything.\n\nThe code is considered to be an example of police corruption and misconduct. Officers who engaged in discriminatory arrests, physical or verbal harassment, and selective enforcement of the law may be considered to be corrupt. Many officers who follow the code may participate in some of these acts during their career for personal matters or in order to protect or support fellow officers. All of these are considered illegal offenses and are grounds for suspension or immediate dismissal. Officers who follow the code are unable to report fellow officers who participate in corruption due to the unwritten laws of their \"police family.\"\n\nPolice perjury or \"testilying\" (in United States police slang) is when an officer gives false testimony in court. Officers who do not lie in court may sometimes be threatened and ostracized by fellow police officers. In 1992, the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Police Corruption (also known as the Mollen Commission) undertook a two-year investigation on perjury in law enforcement. They discovered that some officers falsified documents such as arrest reports, warrants and evidence to provide \"cover\" for an illegal arrest or search. Some police officers also fabricated stories when testifying before a jury. The Commission found that the officers were not lying for greed but because they believed that they were imprisoning people who deserved it. Many prosecutors allowed police perjury to occur, as well.\n\nMany police departments have their own official code of conduct. They train new recruits and investigate police officers if they have a complaint from a civilian or an alleged criminal. There are also some state laws put in place to help protect civilians and criminals from corrupt officers. If the officer is found guilty, officers can be sued by the victim for damage caused by police brutality, false arrest and imprisonment, malicious prosecution, and wrongful death. Federal laws strongly prohibit officer misconduct, including officers who follow the code by \"testilying\" or failing to report any officer who is participating in corruption. If an officer is in violation of any of the officer misconduct federal laws, only the federal government can issue a suit. The police department is only responsible for preventing corruption among officers. If an officer is convicted, they may be forced to pay high fines or be imprisoned. To be convicted, the plaintiffs must prove that the officer was following the \"code\" or participating in negligence and unlawful conduct. It is often hard to convict an officer of following the code or other forms of corruption because officers are protected by defense of immunity, which is an exemption from penalties and burdens that the law generally places on private citizens. The U.S. Supreme Court has consistently held that officers be given the benefit of the doubt that they acted lawfully in fulfilling their duties, a position reaffirmed in \"Saucier v. Katz\", 533 U.S. 194 (2001).\n\nIn 1970, New York City organized the Knapp Commission to hold hearings on the extent of corruption in the city's police department. Police officer Frank Serpico's startling testimony against fellow officers not only revealed systemic corruption but highlighted a longstanding obstacle to investigating these abuses: the fraternal understanding among police officers known variously as \"the Code of Silence\" and \"the Blue Curtain\" under which officers regard testimony against a fellow officer as betrayal. In 1991, the Christopher Commission was formed in Los Angeles in response to the beating of Rodney King in March of that year by four members of the Los Angeles Police Department. In 1992, the Mollen Commission, commissioned to investigate reports of police corruption in New York City, noted that \"The pervasiveness of the code of silence is itself alarming.\" One New York City police officer said, \"If a cop decided to tell on me, his career's ruined...He's going to be labeled as a rat.\" The following year saw the founding of the Civilian Complaint Review Board, an all-civilian board tasked with investigating civil complaints about alleged misconduct on the part of the New York City Police Department.\n\nAfter that the International Association of Chiefs of Police made a code of police conduct publication and rigorously trained police officers. In 1991 Rodney King was brutally beaten by multiple police officers of the Los Angeles Police Department. The officers involved were expected to have been following the \"blue code\". They claimed that the beating was lawful, but it was not until a videotape of the incident was released when it was confirmed that the officers had collectively fabricated their stories.\n\nIn the later 1990s, the FBI arrested 42 officers from five law enforcement agencies in 1998 on charges of conspiracy to distribute cocaine. In a 1998 report to U.S. Congressman Charles B. Rangel, the federal General Accounting Office found evidence of growing police involvement in drug sales, theft of drugs and money from drug dealers, and perjured testimony about illegal searches.\n\nThe code and police corruption stems from the mid-to-late nineteenth century. The Pinkerton National Detective Agency was known for using police officers to violently end strikes. Many members of the Ku Klux Klan were police officers who protected each other when conducting racist acts. This later gave rise to the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which gave new protections to the victims who had long suffered discriminatory policing.\n\n\"Additionally, a string of landmark Supreme Court decisions during the era gave new force both to individual privacy rights as well as to curbs upon Police Power: highly influential cases resulted in the strengthening of Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable Search and Seizure, evidentiary rules forbidding the use at trial of evidence tainted by unconstitutional police actions, and the establishment of the so-called Miranda Warning requiring officers to advise detained suspects of their constitutional rights.\"\n\nThis criminalized officers who did not have the necessary paperwork to conduct a search or who were involved in falsifying documents or committing perjury.\n\nPolice culture or \"cop culture,\" as it is sometimes called by police officers, has resulted in a barrier against stopping corrupt officers. Police culture involves a set of values and rules that have evolved through the experiences of officers and which are affected by the environment in which they work. From the beginning of their career at their academies, police are brought into this \"cop culture.\"\n\nWhile learning jobs and duties, recruits will also learn the values needed to make it to a high rank in their organization. Some words used to describe these values are as follows: a sense of mission, action, cynicism, pessimism, machismo, suspicion, conservatism, isolation and solidarity. The unique demands that are placed on police officers, such as the threat of danger, as well as scrutiny by the public, generate a tightly woven environment conducive to the development of feelings of loyalty.\n\nThese values are claimed to lead to the code; isolation and solidarity leading to police officers sticking to their own kind, producing an us-against-them mentality. The us-against-them mentality that can result leads to officers backing each other up and staying loyal to one another; in some situations it leads to not \"ratting\" on fellow officers.\n\nWhistleblowing (police officers reporting other officers' misconduct) is not common. The low number of officers coming forward may have to do with the understanding that things happen in the heat of the moment that some officers would rather keep personal. Another reason officers may hesitate to go against the blue code may be that challenging the blue code would mean challenging long-standing traditions and feelings of brotherhood within the institution. The fear of consequences may play a large role as well. These consequences can include being shunned, losing friends, and losing back-up, as well as receiving physical threats or having one's own misconduct exposed.\n\nThere are also forces that work against the code and promote whistleblowing. Many police officers do join the police force because they want to uphold the law; the blue code goes against this ideal. Some officers inform on fellow officers' misconduct, for less noble motives, such as to retaliate for mistreatment by fellow officers, to seek administrative recognition, or to prove loyalty to the department. Additionally, some officers are recruited by their administration to inform. If it is in an officer's job description to find misconduct by other officers, he or she is more likely to go against the blue code. Officers who go against the blue code may have a deal to avoid being fired or to receive immunity from prosecution. Some officers have also been known to break the code to sell a story to the media.\n\nPolice officers are more likely to cover up certain kinds of crimes by their colleagues. One study showed that excessive use of force was the crime most commonly shielded by the code. Two studies suggest that some police feel that the code is applicable in cases of \"illegal brutality or bending of the rules in order to protect colleagues from criminal proceedings,\" but not those of illegal actions with an \"acquisitive motive.\"\n\nCases such as the Rampart scandal and many other police corruption cases demonstrate that blue code culture can extend to cover-ups of other levels of crime, acquisitive or not. The code has been called \"America's Most Successful Stop Snitchin' Campaign,\" referring to cases where police covered up the misdeeds of fellow officers and where whistleblowers were harassed, professionally sanctioned, or forced into retirement.\n\nOne method of minimising the effects of the Blue Wall of Silence is exposing those who follow it. Many states have taken measures in police academies to promote the exposure of the blue code. In most cities, before being admitted into the academy one must pass a criminal background check. Through additional background checks, polygraph testing, and psychological evaluations, certain departments are better able to select individuals who are less likely to condone wrongdoing. In these departments, police are exposed to a basic training curriculum that instructs on ethical behavior; this instruction is reinforced in seminars and classes annually in some cases.\n\nSeveral campaigns against the Blue Code of Silence or for making the Blue Code of Silence more visible in the public eye have taken place in the United States. One of the first of these campaigns was the Knapp Commission in New York (officially known as the \"Commission to Investigate Alleged Police Corruption\") which was headed by Mayor John V. Lindsay in 1970. Over 20 years after the Knapp Commission the Mollen Commission was established in 1992 by New York City Mayor David Dinkins to investigate the nature and extent of corruption in the New York City Police Department NYPD, and to recommend changes to improve these procedures. These and other investigations have revealed details of the inner workings of the NYPD.\n\n"}

He is considered to be one of the best players to ever play Minnesota high school hockey.\n\nWhile serving in the US Army, Boucha joined the United States national ice hockey team on a full-time basis in 1970 as the US won the \"Pool B\" qualification tournament. He participated in the 1971 Ice Hockey World Championships in Bern, Switzerland where he scored seven goals in ten games for Team USA. Boucha was also one of the biggest stars of the 1972 United States Olympic hockey team that received the silver medal.\n\nBoucha was drafted in the second Round, 16th overall by the Detroit Red Wings in the 1971 NHL Entry Draft (he was also drafted first overall by the Minnesota Fighting Saints of the rival World Hockey Association but chose not to defect to the WHA). Boucha scored a goal in his first NHL game after the Olympics and was voted Detroit rookie of the year in his first full NHL season. The Red Wings sent him to the Minnesota North Stars in exchange for Danny Grant in 1974. Boucha was enjoying a solid year in his home state; on January 4, 1975, he was assaulted in a highly publicized stick incident by Dave Forbes of the Boston Bruins.

In 1963 they married and their one child, Anton was born in 1973. \"Heat\" won the Symposium Grand Prix ex aequo at the Karlovy Vary IFF in 1964\nand an award at the All-Union Film Festival in Leningrad.\n\n\"Wings\" (1966), \"Krylya\"\n\nShepitko's first post-institute film \"Wings\" concerns a much-decorated female fighter pilot of World War II. The pilot, now principal of a vocational college, is out of touch with her daughter and the new generation. She has so internalized the military ideas of service and obedience that she cannot adjust to life during peacetime. Shepitko brings to light the inner life of a middle-aged woman who must reconcile her past with her present reality. She expresses this by contrasting her character's repression, marked by claustrophobic interiors and tight compositions, with heavenly, expansive shots of sky and clouds, representing the freedom of her flying days. Actress Maya Bulgakova inhabits this stern but reasonable woman with empathy and humor. The film aroused considerable Soviet press controversy at the time, as films were not meant to depict conflicts between children and parents (Vronskaya 1972, p. 39). It also started a public debate by acknowledging a generation gap and for painting a war hero as a forgotten, lost soul.\n\n\"Beginnings of an Unknown Era\" (1967), \"Nachalo nevedomogo veka\"\n\nIn 1967 she shot the second of the three stories in the “Beginning of an unknown era” entitled \"Homeland of electricity\". Shepitko's story follows a young engineer who brings electricity to an impoverished village. Conceived as a commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the October Revolution, authorities deemed its depiction of the Bolsheviks as negative. The first and the second stories were projected 20 years later. The last one hasn't been found yet.\n\n\"In the 13th Hour of the Night\" (1969), \"V trinadtsatom chasu nochi\"\n\nIn 1969 she shot her first color film, a musical fantasy film titled \"In the 13th hour of the night\", a New Year's revue starring Vladimir Basov, Georgy Vitsin, Zinovy Gerdt, Spartak Mishulin and Anatoly Papanov.\n\n\"You and Me\" (1971), \"Ty i ya\"\n\nShepitko's third film was \"You and Me\" (1971), which follows the lives of two male surgeons struggling with different notions of fulfillment. It's both a character study and a critique of consumerism. This was her second and last film in color. It was favorably received at the Venice Film Festival.\n\n\"The Ascent\" (1977), \"Voskhozhdenie\"\n\n\"The Ascent\" (1977) was her last completed film and the one which garnered the most attention in the West. The actors Boris Plotnikov and Vladimir Gostyukhin received their first major roles in the film. Adapted from a novel by Vasili Bykov, Sotnikov Shepitko returns to the sufferings of World War II, chronicling the trials and tribulations of a group of pro-Soviet partisans in Belarus in the bleak winter of 1942. Two of the partisans, Sotnikov and Rybak, are captured by the Wehrmacht and then interrogated by a local collaborator, played by Anatoly Solonitsyn, before four of them are executed in public. This depiction of the martyrdom of the Soviets owes much to Christian iconography.\"The Ascent\" won the Golden Bear at the 27th Berlin International Film Festival in 1977.\n\nShepitko's growing international reputation led to an invitation to serve on the jury at the 28th Berlin International Film Festival in 1978. It was also the official submission of the Soviet Union for the 'Best Foreign Language Film' category of the 50th Academy Awards in 1978 and it was included in \"1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die\", by Steven Schneider.\n\nShepitko died in a car crash on a highway near the city of Tver with four members of her shooting team in 1979 while scouting locations for her planned adaptation of the novel \"Farewell to Matyora\" by Valentin Rasputin. Her husband, the director Elem Klimov, finished the work under the title \"Farewell\" and also made a 25-minute tribute entitled \"Larisa\" (1980).\n\nFarewell was about a small village on a beautiful island, threatened with flooding. The film follows the inhabitants and their farewell to their homeland. \"Critics maintained that the final product lacked Shepitko’s unique personal vision, obviously a point of view that could never be replicated\". Composer Alfred Schnittke dedicated his Second String Quartet to Shepitko's memory.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2045597", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2045597", "title": "Princeton station (NJ Transit)", "text": "Princeton station (NJ Transit)\n\nPrinceton is the northern terminus of the Princeton Branch commuter rail service operated by NJ Transit (NJT), and is located on the Princeton University campus in Princeton, New Jersey. At the branch's southern end at Princeton Junction, connections are available to NJT's Northeast Corridor Line and peak-hour Amtrak trains. The shuttle train between the two stations is known as the \"Dinky\", and has also been known as the \"PJ&B\", for \"Princeton Junction and Back\". Now running along a single track, it is the shortest scheduled commuter rail line in the United States. Initial studies have been conducted to add a bus transitway along the Dinky right-of-way as part of a proposed Bus Rapid Transit system.\n\nService on the Princeton Branch was suspended from October 14, 2018 through May 11, 2019, replaced by shuttle buses, as part of NJT's systemwide service reductions during the installation and testing of positive train control.\n\nPlans to relocate Princeton station 460 ft (140 m) south, proposed by the university in 2006 and approved by NJT and the Princeton Regional Planning Board, were met with opposition from some commuters, residents, alumni, and transportation advocates. The historic 1918 train station closed permanently on August 23, 2013. Approximately 1,200 ft (370 m) to the southeast, a temporary station operated from August 26, 2013 through November 9, 2014, accompanied by various bus routes shuttling among the old station, the temporary station, and Princeton Junction. The new permanent Princeton station, designed by architect Rick Joy, opened on November 17, 2014, with construction continuing on a complex of arts and dining buildings in the surrounding area.\n\nThe original 1865 location of Princeton station, in what became the university's Blair Courtyard, south of Nassau Street, was replaced by the 1918 station, built on a site further south. The historic 1918 station was constructed when the branch was part of the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) under the direction of architect-engineer Alexander C. Shand, who had also overseen construction of the now-demolished Philadelphia Broad Street Station. Designed in the Collegiate Gothic style, the 1918 Princeton station contained a stone station house, a stone freight house, and a canopy-covered platform. The station has been owned by several different parties since the PRR era: Penn Central (1968–1976), Conrail (1976–June 1984), New Jersey Department of Transportation, New Jersey Transit Rail Operations (to October 1984), and Princeton University. It was listed on the New Jersey Register of Historic Places and the National Register of Historic Places in 1984 as part of the Operating Passenger Railroad Stations Thematic Resource.\n\nIn 2006, Princeton University announced its intention to construct a new arts center, calling for the replacement of the 1918 station house, the shortening of the trackage right-of-way, and the creation of a new terminus to the south. Rail advocates opposed the relocation, fearing that access to the new station would be less convenient, resulting in decreased ridership that could \"threaten the train's existence.\" The proposal prompted protest from residents, students, faculty and alumni, and led to the creation of the organization \"Save the Dinky\".\n\nIn October 2010, the Princeton Regional Planning Board passed a resolution supporting the continuation of train service. On October 3, 2011, \"Save the Dinky\" and four local residents filed suit against the university and NJT to stop the move. Meanwhile, the borough, township, and university prepared a memo of understanding in which the school promised to fund a transit study and provide other benefits in exchange for rezoning for the combined arts/transit project.\n\nThe station house has been the property of the university since 1984, when it purchased it from NJT, with guarantees of public use. That year it was listed on the state historic register (ID#1742) and in a thematic survey for the National Register of Historic Places. In 2012, NJT requested abandonment of that public use from the state Historic Preservation Office. \"Save the Dinky\" contended that the move would breach the original agreement when the property was transferred, would cause inconvenience, and would be poor planning. The university considered it to be a necessary improvement for redevelopment of the neighborhood.\n\nIn December 2012, the Regional Planning Board gave approval for the project to proceed. In June 2013, NJT approved a property transfer agreement with the university, involving three parcels around the station and the proposed arts center. The U.S. Surface Transportation Board declined a petition to review the planned move. The New Jersey court system dismissed the 2011 lawsuit in December 2013, and a related appeal in March 2014, and a follow-up petition in July 2014, and a challenge against the Regional Planning Board in January 2015, and two further appeals in February 2016. As of 2017, weekday ridership was down 20 percent from 2012, the last full year of the old station.\n\nThe Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission and New Jersey Transit have conducted studies to develop the Central New Jersey Route 1 Bus Rapid Transit Project. Parts of the proposals call for the construction of a \"Dinky Transitway\" along the Princeton Branch right-of-way, which would incorporate the rail service and add exclusive bus lanes and a greenway for bicycle and pedestrian traffic. In 2011, NJT indicated that moving the station would not be detrimental to its planning.\n\nIn April 2012, the university submitted a revised plan for the arts and transit center, calling for the extension of the station's freight house onto the right-of-way for possible use as a restaurant. The Regional Planning Board introduced an ordinance requiring the land be preserved for a transportation right-of-way that could eventually extend farther into the central business district at Nassau Street. According to the university, ownership of the trackage would have to change hands in order for the extended transitway to be implemented. Approvals were subsequently issued for converting the station house and the expanded freight house into a pair of restaurants, preserving two original ticket windows for kitchen views, and using the wooden arrival/departure boards as overhead menus.\n"}

The park originally operated from 1913 to 2006 as Pleasureland Theme Park under the ownership of the Blackpool Pleasure Beach company. In 2007, the park re-opened under the ownership of Norman Wallis.\n\nThe first Pleasureland had operated since 1913 as a sister amusement park to Blackpool Pleasure Beach. In 2005, the park introduced an entrance fee, which proved unpopular and resulted in a serious downturn in the number of visitors. On 5 September 2006 it closed, due to a claimed lack of return on investments.\n\nA number of rides, including the Traumatizer, were moved to the company's site at Blackpool.\nThe park included several historical rides such as the Cyclone wooden rollercoaster; on 14 September 2006, pictures were released onto the Internet of people dismantling the Cyclone, much to the dismay of local residents, Pleasureland fans, and coaster enthusiasts. On 18 September 2006, two protesters climbed to the top of the Cyclone in an attempt to save it. The protest lasted for three hours, after which the protesters came down over police concerns regarding the distraction they posed to passing motorists. There was a petition co-ordinated by a group of coaster enthusiasts to try and save the ride, but this effort also failed. The Cyclone was demolished on 20 November 2006.\nOne of the park's unique features was its Funhouse with traditional funhouse attractions such as the \"Wheel\" and the \"Social Mixer\". The Funhouse continued to operate independently for several months until its closure on 31 March 2007. Soon after, the funhouse was gutted and parts taken to Blackpool; speculation exists that these will form party of a future heritage fairground museum in Blackpool.\nNot much is known about the fate of many of the classic rides at Pleasureland, although some have been bought and put into storage for a prospective Dreamland revival project in Margate.\n\nOn 31 May 2007, it was announced that Dreamstorm International were to invest £100 million at the Pleasureland site. Pleasureland was re-opened to the public on 21 July 2007 and renamed New Pleasureland. In June 2007, some of the original Pleasureland buildings were demolished, except for buildings around the perimeter. The site re-opened under new management as scheduled, with a temporary travelling fairground. Then, following a successful summer season, the park was kept open (weekends only) until November 2007, when some demolition of remaining unwanted buildings was carried out and refurbishment of other buildings completed. A Pinfari \"Zyklon Loop\" rollercoaster was constructed on the site where the Traumatizer once stood and was opened at the start of the 2008 season, named 'Storm'. The Traumatizer was moved to Blackpool Pleasure Beach and opened as the Infusion in 2007.\n\nThe Park reopened in 2008 on 21 March. However, on 20 March, Sefton Council announced that a company called Urban Splash had been chosen to develop Southport seafront including the Pleasureland site. Here is a report from BBC News. It was announced in October 2008 that New Pleasureland would return for the 2009/10 seasons. An official opening schedule has been announced for 2009,\n\nThe Traumatizer station building has been demolished. In February 2008, the site of the Cyclone Rollercoaster was landscaped, and part of the old River Caves ride demolished to make room for more rides.\n\n\"Norman Returns The Pleasure\" The Park re-opened for the 2008 season on 15 March and rides added for the summer months. Work has also continued on the grounds to make them look more presentable. A Big Top Circus was added during the summer weeks but was removed by its owners after only 2 weeks in the park due to the low number of people visiting New Pleasureland at the start of the summer holiday period. In Summer 2008, a new static ride was opened in the form of a swinging pirate ship. In early 2008, a new roller coaster opened. \"Indy's Lost World - The Ride\" is a themed indoor roller coaster, based on the latest Indiana Jones' film; Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull The roller coaster is situated inside the old Fun House building. In September 2008, it was announced that New Pleasureland will return for the 2009/10 season. In October 2008, the park's Pinfari Roller Coaster, Storm was removed from the park and sold.\n\nOn the evening of 21 April, an arson attack took place, destroying the Lost Dinosaurs of the Sahara (River Caves) and a nearby inflatable attraction. In May 2009, the original Pleasureland Wildcat coaster was bought by Norman Wallis and rebuilt in its original location. The Wildcat opened on 12 August 2009.\n\nThe 'Haunted Inn', the only remaining original feature of Pleasureland, was destroyed in a fire on 30 January 2010. The Pleasureland main entrance building, which was built not long before the original park closed in 2006, was also demolished in February 2010. The Casablanca Entertainment complex was repainted white in June 2010 and is awaiting refurbishment.\nIndy's Lost World Indoor Roller Coaster was closed early 2010. It is to be replaced with a new Indoor Ghost Train. The ride opened in July 2010.\n\nBattlefield Live Southport has opened on the site of the old Southport Zoo, which is immediately adjacent to Pleasureland. Battlefield Live is an outdoor combat game using guns that fire infra-red beams. The site is accessed via Pleasureland and it opened in August 2010.\n\nThe park opened during the Easter Holidays hosting a Monster Truck weekend. A circus was also moved onto the site for the spring season. The previous weekend hosted an Urban Graffiti Art Festival.\n\nThe park opened in March, with a new ride called \"Air\" and a new log flume ride was constructed on the site of the old log flume which was demolished in 2007. A new 'Events Arena' was opened in July with plans to be used as a concert venue.\n\nThe park re-opened in March, with 3 new rides from Camelot Theme Park which closed in 2012.\n\nThe park underwent a further rebrand for the 2014 season, with a new website, new logo, new name and new slogan - 'Where memories are made!'. The park also introduced a new electronic token system for its rides, known as the 'Fun Card'. Guests are required to purchase tokens from kiosks and are given a Fun Card with a lanyard to wear. The card can be swiped at any park ride, without carrying lots of paper tokens. Individual tokens cost £1 and all rides have a value from 1 to 4 tokens each. Stations have been allocated around the park to show guests how many tokens remain on their card to use.\n\nThe park opened on 28 March with The Crazy Mouse roller coaster amid many other minor additions.\n\nIn October 2015, The Crazy Mouse was dismantled to make way for a new yellow looping roller coaster. Construction for the ride was completed in 2016 with the ride's name being \"Speed Loop\".\n\nWhile under the ownership of the Thompson family, two incidents occurred.\n\nIn April 2004, four people were stranded on the ride due to an electrical fault.\n\nOn 25 August 2004, a 59-year-old employee was killed after he became trapped while performing maintenance on the ride. In 2007 the park was fined £95,000 for breaching health and safety laws and was also ordered to pay £50,000 in costs.\n\n"}
{"id": "2045621", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2045621", "title": "The Spiderwick Chronicles", "text": "The Spiderwick Chronicles\n\nThe Spiderwick Chronicles is a series of children's books by Tony DiTerlizzi and Holly Black. They chronicle the adventures of the Grace children, twins Simon and Jared and their older sister Mallory, after they move into the Spiderwick Estate and discover a world of fairies that they never knew existed. The first book, \"The Field Guide\", was published in 2003 and then followed by \"The Seeing Stone \"(2003), \"Lucinda's Secret \"(2003), \"The Ironwood Tree \"(2004), and \"The Wrath of Mulgarath \"(2004). Several companion books have been published including \"Arthur Spiderwick's Field Guide to the Fantastical World Around You \"(2005), \"Notebook for Fantastical Observations \"(2005), and \"Care and Feeding of Sprites\" (2006). A second series, entitled \"Beyond the Spiderwick Chronicles \"includes \"The Nixie's Song\" (2007), \"A Giant Problem\" (2008), and \"The Wyrm King (\"2009).\n\nA feature film adaptation, also titled \"The Spiderwick Chronicles\", was produced by Nickelodeon Movies and premiered on February 14, 2008; an accompanying video game was released in early February 2008.\n\n\"The Field Guide\", the first book in the series, was published in May 2003. It opens in Maine, where nine-year-old identical twins Jared and Simon and their thirteen-year-old sister Mallory move into the decrepit Spiderwick Estate with their mother, Helen. On the first night, they discover a secret library on the second floor using a dumbwaiter. They later discover that the library connects to the rest of the house via a hidden door in a hall closet. A brownie named Thimbletack, who has lived in the house for years, becomes angry with the Grace children when they destroy his nest inside the walls, and Jared is blamed for the ensuing havoc wrought by the brownie in retaliation including assaults on Mallory, Simon, and the trashing of the kitchen. Following a clue in the form of a riddle-poem, Jared finds \"Arthur Spiderwick's Field Guide to the Fantastical World Around\" \"You\" in a secret compartment in a trunk in the attic. The \"Field Guide\" is an old hand-written and illustrated book with information on different types of faeries in the surrounding forest. The novel ends as the Grace children make amends with Thimbletack by building him a new home out of an old birdhouse. Thimbletack then warns them that the book which they found is dangerous and was not meant to be in the hands of mortals.\n\n\"The Seeing Stone\" was published alongside the first book in May 2003. After the Grace children ignore Thimbletack's warning to destroy the \"Guide\", Simon is abducted by a group of goblins who live in the woods surrounding the house. Thimbletack leads Jared and Mallory to the old carriage house where they find a \"seeing stone\" (a stone with a natural hole in it) which gives the wearer, in this case Jared, the ability to see faeries (called the Sight). After Jared and Mallory narrowly avoid being captured by the goblins, they go searching for Simon in the woods. On their way through the forest, they encounter a troll residing in the river by a decrepit stone bridge. Partially protected by the daylight, they are able to avoid it, but lose their fencing weapons. After encountering a wounded griffin, they find the goblin camp and a plethora of prisoners hanging in cages made from refuse from the trees. While trying to rescue Simon, they meet a prisoner named Hogsqueal, a hobgoblin, who convinces them to help him escape in exchange for his help in rescuing Simon. Hogsqueal offers to spit in their eyes, which gives them the Sight without using the stone. Hogsqueal distracts the goblins from the children's escape and in return, Jared, Simon and Mallory attract the goblins' attention away from Hogsqueal and then flee, leading the goblins back to the troll. Jared convinces the troll to let them escape in return for leading the goblins to him to eat. After they arrive home, Simon convinces them to return to the now empty camp to release the rest of the goblins' victims and they take the injured griffin to the carriage house. After confronting their scared and angry mother, they discover that Thimbletack, enraged at Jared's forceful taking of the seeing stone, has again become a Boggart and reverted to his mischievous ways.\n\n\"Lucinda's Secret\" was published on October 1, 2003. The novel opens upon an argument among the Grace children on whether or not to destroy the \"Field Guide\", Jared alone insisting that they keep it. They eventually agree to consult their Great-Aunt Lucinda, who is now staying in a psychiatric hospital and is the only person whom they know to have been in contact with Arthur Spiderwick, who was her father. When they ask her about Arthur, it is revealed that the last she saw him was one day when she was a little girl, on which Arthur had set out from the house on foot and never returned. She is horrified that the Grace family is staying at the Estate, which she says is not safe, and even more worried when she hears that they have the \"Guide\", believing her father to have taken it with him when he disappeared. However, when Jared takes the book from his backpack to show her, it has been replaced with another book, presumably by Thimbletack. Once home, the Grace children decide to find out what happened to their great-great uncle, and set out from the Estate with a map of the area on which is written \"September 14th. Five O'clock. Bring the remains of the book.\" On their journey they meet a Phooka: a creature that talks only in riddles. They finally reach a river grove inhabited by elves, who threaten to trap one of the children there unless the guide is given to them. The children flee, however, promising to bring the \"Guide\" as soon as they can. On passing by the Phooka again, one of his riddles leads them to think that Arthur is still alive, but imprisoned in Faerie with the elves.\n\nPublished on April 6, 2004. The family attends Mallory's fencing meet at school. During the tournament, Jared finds a boy identical to him going through Mallory's bag. He transforms into a smaller child when Jared attempts to scare him with his pocket knife. When Jared and Simon discover that Mallory has disappeared, they search for her in an abandoned quarry, but wind up being kept prisoner by dwarves. Mallory is revealed to be sleeping in a glass-coffin dressed in medieval garb (similarly to Snow White), with the dwarves saying she is now immortal, so long as she stays in the coffin. Escaping their cage, the twins free Mallory and meet a strange creature, called a knocker, who tells them the way out by listening to the stones. They next see a huge metal tree, made by the dwarves, called the Ironwood Tree. After a narrow escape from the dwarves' mechanical dogs, they make their way out of the tunnel but have to hide before leaving. They secretly watch Mulgarath, a shapeshifting ogre who wants to rule the world, callously order the death of the dwarves for having been tricked into not getting the \"Field Guide\" from Jared. The dwarves are mauled to death by the goblins and Mulgarath reveals that he had the \"Guide\" the whole time. The siblings escape just after Mulgarath leaves with his goblins and the weapons made by the dwarves\n\n\"The Wrath of Mulgarath\" was published on September 7, 2004. The Grace children return from the quarry to the Spiderwick estate, only to find the house in ruins and their mother gone. Hogsqueal the hobgoblin informs them that the house was destroyed by the goblins who have kidnapped their mother and taken her to the palace of their fearsome master, Mulgarath the ogre. Accompanied by Hogsqueal, the siblings journey to Mulgarath's palace, an immense citadel made of garbage where they battle a legion of goblins. Mallory runs the leader through with her sword and is greatly traumatized by having actually killed a living sentient being. Nevertheless, she and her brothers defeat the goblins and discover Mulgarath's plan. The ogre has learned from the \"Field Guide\" that fresh cows' milk makes young dragons rapidly mature. He has stolen a number of cows and is using them to breed an army of dragons with which he plans to conquer the world. Byron, the griffin, successfully vanquishes the mother dragon and Simon kills the young ones. Infiltrating the palace, they find their mother and father tied up. They release their father, but discover that he is actually Mulgarath in disguise. Jared has Thimbletack wrap chains around Simon and Mallory. The ogre brags of his plan and reveals that the\" Field Guide\" is underneath his throne, and Jared mockingly tells Mulgarath that he and his siblings have killed all the dragons. In a rage, Mulgarath flings Simon and Mallory out of the window but Thimbletack's chains hold, and they don't fall far. Jared stabs Mulgarath in the foot with Mallory's sword, then knocks him out of the window. Mulgarath falls, transforms into a swallow to escape, and is eaten by Hogsqueal.\n\nThe children return home, where they meet Arthur Spiderwick, who had been living with the elves and so had not aged. He and his daughter Lucinda, now an old woman, share a poignant goodbye, and he turns to dust. With Mulgarath defeated, the Grace family is presumably now free to live happily ever after.\n\nThis story takes place in Florida, where 11-year-old Nick Vargas lives with his brother, Jules, his weird stepsister, Laurie, his father, Paul, and his stepmother, Charlene, in his father's housing development. Laurie has read \"the Spiderwick Chronicles\" and believes in faeries. Nick thinks she is \"lame\" and wishes she would leave him alone. After finding a four-leafed clover (which allows people to see faeries) he sees a nixie unconscious in his yard, which he and Laurie carry into a nearby artificial pond.\n\nOn the following day, the Nixie, named Taloa, gives Nick and Laurie the Sight and sends them to find her six sisters, who were separated when their pond was destroyed. They leave after a faerie fills Nick's father's car with sand to look for Taloa's sisters at her old pond. They find the pond dried, the surrounding forest burnt and the bodies of three of the nixies, accidentally waking up a giant, which they mistook for a hill. They flee from the giant, who becomes hypnotized and calm when it hears Taloa's singing.\n\nThe children decide to ask the authors of \"The Spiderwick Chronicles\" themselves for advice at a book signing, convincing Jules to drive them. Once there, they are disappointed when Tony DiTerlizzi and Holly Black don't believe them, but they then run into Jared and Simon Grace, who offer to help them gather useful information. Jared tells them about a giant expert who lived nearby and they plan to meet at his address. The place appears to be deserted, and after a quick incident with will-o'-the-wisps, the kids take several papers including a diagram of a giant trap. While the giant is hypnotized by the nixie's song, the three kids use a rope to tie the giant's foot to its neck. It thrashes around, strangling itself with the cords, leaving the kids horrified at what they've done. When the giant stops moving, an old man called Noseeum Jack (\"Noseeum\" due to his poor eyesight, and \"Jack\" being a reference to the story of \"Jack the Giant-Killer\") approaches, revealing to be the son of the giant expert who met Arthur Spiderwick, and a giant slayer himself, killing the giant definitely. He explains that the giants sleep for 500 years at a time and all wake up at once, bringing panic and destruction to anywhere they go, and that soon all of Florida's giants would be waking up.\n\nNick and Laurie start taking giant hunting lessons from Noseeum Jack, which Nick finds pointless. One night, Jack shows up at their house when their parents are fighting and takes them to see a fight between two giants who had woken up too close to each other. He approaches one of them when it gets injured and is swatted away, hurting his leg. The kids help him to his house and, once home, Laurie gives Jules a keychain containing the four-leafed clover (which they no longer need, having been given permanent Sight by Taloa).\n\nThe next day they find a small faerie (who Nick has seen days before) playing with a message that Taloa had left for them, saying she had gone look for her surviving sisters alone. They catch the little faerie, whom Laurie names Sandspur and assumes to be a hobgoblin, based on the Field Guide. Later that day, two giants start fighting near their house. They escape with Jules, who can see the giants, but most of the development is destroyed. They go to Jack's house for help, but instead meet Jack's son (simply called Jack Junior), who tells them that he's taking his father to live with him and his wife. Noseeum Jack apologizes to Nick for not helping them and tells him he kept something for them in his backyard, which Nick doesn't even bother to investigate.\n\nThat night, the family stays at a hotel where they try to come up with a plan and Jules shows Sandspur to his girlfriend, Cindy. Based on the story of the Pied Piper of Hamelin, Nick thinks about the possibility of asking the merfolk to lure the giants to the sea, since they seem to be hypnotized by a nixie's singing. The kids sneak out to the beach, where they find that the mermaids hate land-dwellers and kidnap Jules, promising to let him go and sing the giants to the sea if the kids bring them a fish that has never been in their sea. They steal a tropical fish from Cindy's father's aquarium and race back to the beach. The mermaids are amazed that they completed the task and return Jules. Keeping their promise but intending to trick the humans, the mermaids sing for only a little while and to no effect before disappearing. However, Nick manages to tape their song in a tape recorder, which they intend to use to lure the giants themselves.\n\nAfter getting Nick's model Viking ship from the hotel, they drive around a route provided by Sandspur of where the giants are, playing the mermaids' song. The giants follow the sound to the sea, where Nick drops the little boat (with the tape recorder) into the ocean. The giants follow it out to sea and the kids go back to the hotel where they find the Grace kids waiting for them with the news that the giants woke up all at the same time because they were there to kill something even worse.\n\nThe last book of the Spiderwick Saga, the story starts with the Vargas family going to a family therapist because of the children's latest strange behaviour, which Nick's father thinks is caused by his remarrying. Meanwhile, sinkholes have been appearing everywhere throughout Florida, where small black serpent-like creatures are vaguely seen by Nick. Under the assumption that these sinkholes are caused by the creatures that the giants were supposed to destroy, the Vargas kids (plus Sandspur) meet up with Jared, Simon and Mallory at Noseeum Jack's house, which is now deserted and has a massive sinkhole in the front yard. After breaking into the house, they find more of Jack's annotations, which compare the hydra, shown as a group of intertwined wyrm dragons, to the legend of the Rat King.\n\nFinally going to Jack's backyard, Nick and Laurie find what Jack had meant to give them: a small pool filled with lime and muck with Taloa and two of her sisters, Ooki and Ibi, whom Jack had captured some days earlier. Meanwhile, Mallory goes into the sinkhole to investigate, but finds herself unable to breathe and surrounded by the small snake-like dragons. They manage to get her out and put three of the creatures in a jar. They figure that the creatures produce methane, which makes the air around them unbreathable, and realize that these were the creatures that the giants ate in order to breathe fire (which they originally believed to be salamanders).\n\nSeeing how fast the dragons can grow after feeding them a chunk of pizza, the children all drive to the beach in order to get the giants back to land so they can kill the dragons. The three nixies eventually agree to use their singing to lure the giants, and one of them is taken to the water with Nick and Jared in a surfboard (because since nixies are used to freshwater, salt water hurts their skin). Before they can accomplish this, however, Nick is taken underwater by the merfolk, who tell him how they're glad that the land-dwellers are doomed and give him a magical cap in the process that allows him to breathe underwater. The nixies manage to get some of the giants to follow them to land, where they immediately start eating the small reptiles and fighting each other again. As the children drive away from the giants, their car falls into a sinkhole and only after some time do they manage to get out. A giant then attacks them, being saved by the showing up of Jack Junior, who suddenly decided to listen to his father and come help the children kill the giants (being surprised when they reveal him that killing giants is no longer their plan).\n\nAfter dropping the nixies in a nearby pond (their reward for having sung to the giants), Jules, Laurie and Nick pass by Cindy's house and notice a large sinkhole close to it. When they go to warn Cindy and her parents, Laurie and Sandspur fall into the growing sinkhole and a tree falls on Jules's legs when attempting to rescue her. When Nick tries to help Laurie get out of the sinkhole, he finds that she still hadn't died from the methane exhaled by the dragons because Sandspur (who had grown to a huge size, revealing himself to be a spriggan) had been eating them, proceeding to eat Nick whole and only regurgitating him when Laurie drops rocks into the creature's mouth to make him sick. Nick and Laurie get out of the sinkhole and go back to meet Jack Jr. and the Grace kids, leaving Jules at Cindy's house waiting for an ambulance (being followed back by Sandspur, back in his small size, like nothing had happened).\n\nNoticing that all sinkholes are connected, they come to the conclusion that the biggest hydra must be in the center, laying the eggs that hatch into the smaller hydras who wander through the tunnels. They notice that the giants are all going to meet that alpha hydra, and Jack Junior leaves to go kill it, followed by the children. There, they meet the giant multi-headed dragon, who had already started to kill the giants that had gathered to fight it. After hurting Jack Junior and the Grace kids, Nick has an idea and realizes it's up to him to save the day. Using the cap given to him by the merfolk so he could safely breathe, he goes into one of the tunnels with Jack's machete so to meet the hydra from below. When he gets there, instead of trying to kill the beast, he cuts the substance that keeps all the dragons together, thus making them separate from each other and easier for the giants to kill.\n\nAt the hospital, all the children get their injuries treated, Jules gets back with Cindy, Jack calls his father to tell him what happened, the Grace kids meet their father there and the Vargas family decides to all stay together. The Spiderwick Saga ends with the Vargas going home, being watched by a silent giant in the distance.\n\n\nThe Spiderwick Chronicles:\nBeyond the Spiderwick Chronicles:\n\nIn the Spiderwick universe, faeries usually remain invisible or disguised to human eyes, who are generally not aware of their presence. However, a small percentage of humans have the ability to see faeries, commonly called the 'Sight', acquired naturally (for example, by being the seventh son of a seventh son or having red hair) or artificially (by looking through a holed stone or possessing a four-leafed clover). In the series, the Grace children receive the Sight when the hobgoblin Hogsqueal spits in their eyes, and the Vargas kids receive it when they are held under the water that a nixie had been soaking in.\n\nThey are portrayed as living many years, so many of the faeries encountered by the main characters also met Arthur Spiderwick and other long-dead humans in the past, without having aged. The species of fairies in the series are mainly taken from European mythology and folklore and Medieval bestiaries, including brownies, goblins, dragons, sprites, and elves, among many others.\n\nThe Spiderwick Chronicles:\n\nBeyond the Spiderwick Chronicles:\n\nDiTerlizzi stated that, due to the collaborative effort he and Black put into the books, there is no individual credit as to who did the writing and who did the illustrations.\n\nA feature film adaptation of the series was released by Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon Movies on February 14, 2008. Directed by Mark Waters, it starred Freddie Highmore, Sarah Bolger, Martin Short, Nick Nolte, and Seth Rogen. It followed the basic overall plot of the five novels in the Spiderwick Chronicles series, but left out the majority of the plot from the fourth book and contained several major differences.\n\n"}

They were also known as Derozians, after their firebrand teacher at Hindu College, Henry Louis Vivian Derozio.\n\nThe Young Bengals were inspired and excited by the spirit of free thought and revolt against the existing social and religious structure of Hindu society. A number of Derozians were attracted to the Brahmo Samaj movement much later in life when they had lost their youthful fire and excitement. As one scholar characterized it:\n\nThe Young Bengal Movement peripherally included Christians such as Reverend Alexander Duff (1806–1878), who founded the General Assembly's Institution, and his students like Lal Behari Dey (1824–1892), who went on to renounce Hinduism. Latter-day inheritors of the legacy of the Young Bengal Movement include scholars like Brajendra Nath Seal (1864–1938), who went on to be one of the leading theologians and thinkers of the Brahmo Samaj.\nThe Derozians however failed to have a long term impact. Derozio was removed from the Hindu college in 1829 because of radicalism. The main reason for their limited success was social conditions prevailing at that time which were not ripe for adoption of radical ideas.\nFurther they lacked to link masses like peasant cause.\n\nYoung Bengal followed classical economics, and was composed of free traders who took inspiration from Jeremy Bentham, Adam Smith, and David Ricardo:\n\nDerozio and the Young Bengal group set two establishments and published journals which played a role in the Bengal Renaissance . These are noted below:\n\nDerozio joined Hindu College in 1826 and within a short period attracted students. The Academic Association, established in 1828 under the guidance of Derozio, arranged discussions on subjects such as:\n\nAfter moving around for a place for its meetings, it settled down in Maniktala. Derozio was its president. One of his students, Uma Charan Basu, was its secretary. The principal speakers in the association were: Rasik Krishna Mallick, Krishna Mohan Banerjee, Ramgopal Ghosh, Radhanath Sikdar, Dakshinaranjan Mukherjee, and Hara Chandra Ghosh. Amongst its organisers were Ramtanu Lahiri, Sib Chandra Deb and Peary Chand Mitra.\n\nThe sessions of the Academic Association attracted attention to such an extent that amongst those who used to be present fairly regularly were. David Hare, Col. Benson, private secretary of Lord William Bentick, Col. Beatson, later adjutant general, and Dr. Mills, principal of Bishop's College. They applauded the youngsters for their brilliant oratory.\n\nHaramohan Chatterjee has written as follows about the debates in the association\"\n\nThe Society for the Acquisition of General Knowledge was established on 20 February 1838. It had 200 members in 1843. Trachand Chakrabarti was its president, Ramgopal Ghosh its vice president and Peary Chand Mitra its president. The society elected David Hare as honorary visitor. Some of the prominent papers it published were: \"Nature of Historical Studies and Civil and Social Reform\" by Krishna Mohan Banerjee, \"Interests of the Female Sex and the State of Hindustan\" by Peary Chand Mitra, \"Sketch of Bankuja\" by Hara Chandra Ghosh, \"Notice of Tipperah\", \"A New Spelling Book\", \"Notices of Chittagong\" by Gobinda Chandra Basak.\n\nThese associations of the Young Bengal group were forerunners of later organisations such as the Landholders’ Society, British India Society, and British Indian Association with all of which the Young Bengal group had links.\n\nProminent Derozians and Young Bengal group members who left a distinct mark in Calcutta society of the 1830s and 1840s were:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2045634", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2045634", "title": "Dogo Argentino", "text": "Dogo Argentino\n\nThe Dogo Argentino is a large, white, muscular breed of dog that was developed in Argentina primarily for the purpose of big-game hunting, including wild boar. The breeder, Antonio Nores Martínez, also wanted a dog that would exhibit steadfast bravery and willingly protect its human companion. It was first bred in 1928 from the Cordoba Dog, along with a wide array of other breeds, including the Great Dane. This dog breed is capable of taking down mountain lions.\n\nThe Argentine Dogo is a large white short-coated dog with black spots on its skin and has a muscular and strong body that rarely has any markings on its coat (any type of marking or spot on the coat is considered a flaw). While it is not accepted in many of the clubs, a Dogo Argentino can have a black or brindle spot on its head known as a 'pirata' and this is accepted by the Federación Cinológica Argentina.\n\nBreed Standard Height: for females is and for males is , measured at the withers. Weight: from . The length of the body is just slightly longer than the height. The length of the front leg (measured from point of elbow to the ground) is approximately equal to one-half of the dog's height at the withers. The head has a broad, slightly domed skull and the muzzle is slightly higher at the nose than the stop, when viewed in profile. The tail is set low, thick at the base and tapers to a point.\n\nIt has been described as looking similar to the American Bulldog, but very tall with a solid white coat. The breed has also been described as looking similar to the American Pit Bull Terrier, even though the American Pit Bull Terrier is far smaller (13.5 to 27 kilograms).\n\nIn 1928, Antonio Nores Martinez, a medical doctor, professor and surgeon, set out to breed a big game hunting dog that was also capable of being a loyal pet and guard dog. Antonio Martinez picked the Cordoba Dog to be the base for the breed. This breed is extinct today, but it was said that as a large and ferocious dog, it was a great hunter. Martinez crossed it with the Great Dane, Boxer, Spanish Mastiff, Old English Bulldog, Bull Terrier, Pyrenean Mastiff, English Pointer, Irish Wolfhound and Dogue de Bordeaux. Nores Martinez continued to develop the breed via selective breeding to introduce the desired traits.\n\nIn 1970 Dr. Raul Zeballos brought the first six specimens of Argentine Dogo to the United States.\n\nDogos are big-game hunters and are also trained for search and rescue, police assistance, service dogs, guide for the blind, competitive obedience, Schutzhund and military work.\n\nThe Dogo is an intelligent and courageous dog with a strong, natural instinct to protect its home and family. Dogos are very social dogs and are happiest when included in all family activities. Dogos make a strong distinction between familiar people and strangers, so it is imperative that they be well trained and socialized at an early age.\n\nDogos are hunters of great courage and endurance, and will work individually or in packs. They have also successfully been used in police protection work. An unsteady temperament is a serious fault. {UKC Breed Standard} The Dogo has a life expectancy of 10 to 12 years.\n\nAs in the Dalmatian, white Boxer, and white Bull Terrier, the Dogo may experience pigment-related deafness. There is possibility of an approximate 10% deafness rate overall with some Dogos afflicted uniaurally (one deaf ear) and some binaurally (deaf in both ears). Studies have shown that the incidence of deafness is drastically reduced when the only breeding stock used is that with bilaterally normal hearing. OFA health testing should be done on all breeding stock to ensure that there are no evident signs of hip dysplasia.\n\nWhile the Argentine Dogo was bred primarily from the extinct Cordoba Dog, it was bred to be a cooperative hunter, i.e. to accompany other catch dogs and bay dogs on the hunt without fighting with the other dogs.\n\nThe Argentine Dogo is banned, or has ownership restrictions, in certain countries, including the Cayman Islands, Denmark, Fiji, Iceland, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Turkey, and Ukraine. In the United Kingdom, under the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991, it is illegal to own a Dogo Argentino without lawful authority.\n\nOn January 1, 2011 the AKC accepted the Argentine Dogo into their miscellaneous class to allow the process of full recognition to begin. The official AKC parent club, Dogo Argentino Club of America worked with the AKC to achieve full AKC recognition. On January 1, 2020 the AKC recognized the Dogo Argentino allowing it to compete in the Working Group. There are now 195 dog breeds recognized by the AKC.\n\n\n"}

The area that is now the lagoon was grassland, from the beach. When the glacier melted, the sea rose. The lagoon remained as captured water.\n\nThe indigenous people who lived along the lagoon thrived on its fish and shellfish. This was determined by analyzing the middens they left behind, piled with refuse from clams, oysters, and mussels.\n\nThe Indian River Lagoon was originally known on early Spanish maps as the \"Rio de Ais,\" after the Ais Indian tribe, who lived along the east coast of Florida. An expedition in 1605 by Alvero Mexia resulted in the mapping of most of the lagoon. Original place names on the map included \"Los Mosquitos\" (the Mosquito Lagoon and the Halifax River), \"Haulover\" (current Haulover Canal area), \"Ulumay Lagoon\" (Banana River) \"Rio d' Ais\" (North Indian River), and \"Pentoya Lagoon\" (Indian River Melbourne to Ft. Pierce)\n\nEarly European settlers drained the swamps to raise pineapples and citrus. They dug canals discharging fresh water into the lagoon, five times the historical volume.\n\nPrior to the arrival of the railroad, the river was an essential transportation link.\n\nIn 1896 and 1902, there were fish kills in the lagoon from gas from the muck below.\n\nThe advent of the automobile, starting in the 1930s, resulted in causeways which diverted the sluggish flow of the waterway. Huge population influx resulted in sewage, and stormwater runoff from roadways, polluting the lagoon.\n\nFrom 1989 to 2013, the population along the lagoon increased 50% to 1.6 million people.\n\nThe full length of the Indian River Lagoon is , extending from Ponce de León Inlet in Volusia County, Florida, to Jupiter Inlet in Palm Beach County, Florida, and includes Cape Canaveral. The Lagoon covers one-third of Florida's East Coast. Brevard County incorporates 71% of the lagoon's surface.\n\nLake Okeechobee is connected to the lagoon by the Okeechobee Waterway and the St. Lucie River meeting in Sewall's Point.\nFrom north to south, the Indian River Lagoon system includes the following:\n\nFor water quality measurement, the non-profit Marine Resources Council has divided the lagoon into 4 major divisions, with a total of ten subdivisions:\n\nThe Indian River Lagoon is North America's most diverse estuary, with more than 2100 species of plants and 2200 animals. The diversity is the result of being located near a climate boundary, from the Gulf Stream. Migratory ocean fish swimming nearby, were swept into the lagoon.\n\nThe lagoon contains 35 species listed as threatened or endangered — more than any other estuary in North America. The lagoon has about 2,500 types of animals in it. It serves as a spawning and nursery ground for different species of oceanic and lagoon fish and shellfish. The lagoon also has one of the most diverse bird populations anywhere in America.\n\nNearly 1/3 of the nation's manatee population lives here or migrates through the Lagoon seasonally.\n\nNine-banded armadillos comprise one of the 34 mammals in the area. It is a 1920s immigrant from the Southwestern United States. In 2016 a Right whale with her calf entered the lagoon by mistake and safely exited to the ocean.\n\nBetween 200 and 800 Bottlenose dolphins (\"Tursiops truncatus\") also live in the Indian River Lagoon.\n\nRed Drum, Spotted seatrout, Common snook, and the Tarpon are the main gamefish in the Titusville area of the lagoon system.\n\nAvians include the American kestrel, Reddish egret and spoonbills.\n\nButterflies include the Polydamas swallowtail.\n\nIndian River Lagoon is abundant with bioluminescent dinoflagellates in the summer and ctenophore in the winter.\n\nSeagrass is a critical component to the overall health of the lagoon. By 1990, it had surpassed levels reached in 1943. The lagoon also contains night-blooming cereus.\n\nIn 1916, the St. Lucie Canal (C-44) diverts excess nutrient-rich water from Lake Okeechobee into the South Lagoon. While this helps prevent life-threatening flooding in the Okeechobee area, it creates toxic blooms after entering the Lagoon, a threat to flora, fauna, and humans. This situation is proving difficult to address in the 21st century.\n\nFrom 1913 to 2013, activity by humans has increased the watershed for the lagoon from to increasing runoff of freshwater and nutrients from farms. Both have been detrimental to lagoon health. The wetlands are needed to cleanse the lagoon. About of land were lost to mosquito control and have been restored, but by 2013, recovery was incomplete.\n\nMangroves are important to marine life. Between the 1940s and 2013, 85% of them had been removed for housing development.\n\nIn 1990, the Florida Legislature passed the Indian River Lagoon Act, requiring most sewer plants to stop discharging into the lagoon by 1996. Some sports fish rebounded in population in the 1990s when gill nets were banned and pollution in the lagoon was reduced. In 1995 the seagrass covered over .\n\nThe 1993–1996 data base used to track the movement of water through the St. Lucie Estuary and into Indian River Lagoon is described in Smith (2007). This includes daily mean discharge rates for the 16 gauged canals emptying into the St. Lucie Estuary and Indian River Lagoon, predicted shelf tides, and wind speeds and directions recorded along the west side of the lagoon at about 27°32'N (corresponding to Segment 11 of the model).\n\nIn 2007, concerns were raised about the future of the lagoon system, especially in the southern half where frequent freshwater discharges seriously threatened water quality, decreasing the salinity needed by many fish species, and have contributed to large algae blooms promoted by water saturated with plant fertilizers. \nIn the mid 1990s, the lagoon has been the subject of research on light penetration for photosynthesis in submerged aquatic vegetation.\n\nIn 2010, of nitrogen and of phosphorus entered the lagoon.\n\nIn 2011, a superbloom of phytoplankton resulted in the loss of of lagoon seagrass. In 2012, a brown tide bloom fouled the northern lagoon. The county has approval for funds to investigate these unusual blooms to see if they can be prevented.\n\nCatches of blue crabs dropped unevenly from in 1987 to in 2012, but with high catches in 1998, 1991, alternating with low catch years. These crabs require 2% salt content in the water to survive. A drought increases the salt content and heavy rainfall decreases it. Both of these conditions have recurred over the past decades and are believed to have had an adverse effect on the crab population.\n\nIn 2013, algae blooms and loss of sea grass destroyed all gains.\nIn 2013, four major problems with lagoon water quality were identified. 1) Excess nitrogen and phosphorus from runoff from the application of fertilizer; 2) an estimated 8 to 11% septic tank failures of tens of thousands of septic tanks in the county. 3) Muck from construction, farming, erosion and dead plants find their way to the bottom of the lagoon, preventing growth and consuming vital oxygen essential to marine flora and fauna; 4) Invasive species, including the Asian green mussel, South American charru mussel, and the Australian spotted jellyfish, eat clams and fish larvae.\n\nIn 2016, there were an estimated 300,000 septic tanks in the five-county area bordering the Lagoon. At one time, sewer plants were worse polluters. In 1986, there were 46 sewer plants along the lagoon. They discharged about daily into the estuary. The state ended most sewer plant pollution by 1995.\n\nThe worst fish kill to date occurred in March 2016, with 30 species impacted. A brown tide bloom was blamed for the low oxygen levels. The algae growth originated in the no-motor zone of the Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge.\nIn 2018, lagoon health is better near ocean inlets. Pollution is worse in areas near no inlets, such as the Mosquito Lagoon, North IRL, and the Banana River.\n\nAccording to the Florida Oceanographic Society, nearly 1 million people live and work in the Indian River Lagoon region. The Lagoon accounts for $300 million in fisheries revenues, includes a $2.1 billion citrus industry, and generates more than $300 million in boat and marine sales annually.\n\nIn 2007, visitors spent an estimated 3.2 million person-days in recreation on the lagoon.\n\nIn 2008, Hazen and Sawyer, P.C. submitted a report titled \"Indian River Lagoon Economic Assessment and Analysis Update\" to the Indian River Lagoon National Estuary Program, St. Johns River Water Management District. The report described the estimated 2007 recreational uses and economic value of the Indian River Lagoon to residents and visitors of the five counties that comprise the Lagoon system. The sum of recreational expenditures and recreational use value was estimated at $2.1 billion.\n\n\n"}

It takes various liberties with the original story to better suit the post setting and introduces anime and modern styled designs. The game follows seven samurai as they fight off an immense army of mutants, cyborgs and other inhuman creatures in an attempt to bring about a regime of peace for those in need. The player takes the role of \"Natoe\", a samurai, and is sent through various locations of post-Japan to fight off hundreds of enemies with a twin-sworded fighting style known as \"Nitou-Ryu\".\n\nThe year is 20XX and the setting is Japan. Humans and Humanoids, the latter being various mutants, cyborgs, and robots, maintain a delicate balance in a large, unnamed city (somewhat resembling a post-apocalyptic Tokyo) where the power and balance of the city is maintained by a large structure known as the \"Steeple of light\". Its source of power is a young girl named the Child of Heaven. When the child is stolen by the humanoids in order to break the balance and initiate war, the child then goes missing from her inhuman captors and is held by several villagers to ransom the city for money. When the humanoids and various Agents of the city set out to retrieve her and her Sacred Jewel, the villagers quickly find themselves in danger and look for Samurai (known in the game as \"hunters\") to protect them.\n\n\"Seven Samurai 20XX\" is a hack and slash video game, as the protagonist of the game is faced with the task of destroying overwhelming hordes of enemies with his swords. Like many others of its genre, it utilizes a combo system, showing the player how many uninterrupted hits they have inflicted upon their opponents.\n\nThe main point of the game is to constantly utilize the second sword which is carried in the protagonist's shealth, allowing the player to achieve a larger combo score. Skill-related battle commands such as the \"Nitou-Ryu\" mode allow the player to wield a second katana for a limited time, or increase the speed, range and power of the player's combos.\n\n\"Nitou-Ryu mode\" is a duration of time engaged when the player presses the L1 and R1 triggers on the PlayStation 2 controller. It permits the protagonist to use a second blade for a limited amount of time to increase attack power and range of the weapons. As the player progresses in the game, the length of the bar can be increased.\n\nA \"Just Guard\" allows the player to deflect an enemy's attack with skillfully timed uses of the triangle button. It allows the player to avoid damage and generates a counter-attack opportunity. This move also fully refills the Nitou-Ryu timer to 100% of its capacity.\n\nA \"Just Step\" is executed with proper timing of the X button and allows the player to avoid an enemy's attack and \"step\" (in-game, it looks more akin to a teleport) behind the enemy for a counter-attack. This move partially refills the Nitou-Ryu timer. A \"Just Attack\" allows Natoe to travel in the direction of one or more enemies at great speed, breaking their defense. This move also partially refills the Nitou-Ryu meter. The game also incorporates various Street Fighter-like combos and \"Charge attacks\" which occur when holding the square button at various combos and when dashing with the X button.\n\nWhile the story is based on the film \"Seven Samurai\", its story and plot have more in common with its animated counterpart, \"Samurai 7\". The storyline is divided into chapters:\nThe game begins as a young samurai known as Natoe is passing through the town during the humanoid invasion of the city. As he passes through the ruined city, he encounters several humanoid foot soldiers, defeating them. He then encounters the Humanoid known as Zex. After seriously wounding him, he meets the fleeing villagers who inquire if he can help protect their village from future humanoid attacks. Natoe declines, and leaves the villagers, fighting more humanoids along the way.\n\nAfter encountering his childhood friend Jodie, Natoe works his way through the city, finishing off the remaining humanoids from the prior invasion. He eventually meets up with Kanbei, who convinces him to help out the villagers or they will be overrun by the next invasion of Humanoids. Natoe reluctantly agrees.\n\nHowever, Kanbei realizes that they need more samurai to defend the village. They venture out into various areas to recruit 5 more skilled warriors. Natoe eventually finds the thief Totsuma in the city's Scrapyard area. Natoe defeats Necryl, earning Totsuma's trust and place on the team. Kanbei now tells the team of his former war ally Rojie, and the team set out to the main part of the city to locate him.\n\nNatoe and the others arrive in the heart of the bustling city to find the whereabouts of Rojie. Discovering his occupation as a bodyguard for a female mob leader named Salla, Natoe goes off to find him, defeating leagues of street thugs and the drug dealer Kyric in the process. He meets the friendly warrior Eight before leaving the district.\n\nRojie now on the team, Natoe recalls the man Eight and suggests to the others that he be enlisted to join the team. Noticing Eight descend into the City's underground sewers, Natoe follows. Much to his surprise, he encounters the humanoid White Fox and battles him on several occasions. At the end of the sewers, he meets the mysterious \"Man in White\" and discovers Jodie and Eight are both agents of the city. Saving Eight from the Man in White, Natoe convinces him to join the team.\nLeaving the city, the encourage of Natoe, Eight and Rojie make their way to the village to rendezvous with the rest of the team. Along the way Natoe encounters a team of agents from the city, as well as the enigmatic Zwei.\n\nReaching the village, Kanbei and the samurai become suspicious of the villagers withdrawn behavior. Natoe decides to investigate, finding out in the process Hinata's true origins and the villagers deceitful motives. Afterwards, the team come to the conclusion that Humanoids attack on the village will be occurring soon. Natoe leaves the village in an attempt to find one last samurai to help in the ensuing battle.\n\nNatoe arrives in the wilderness to find an angry Zex and the humanoid Fen waiting for him. Zex's massive strength causes the ground to collapse, and Natoe finds himself in an underground city called the \"Town of Warriors\". Here he encounters Ein, a humanoid able to defeat his opponents using magic. He saves the female humanoid Cue in the process, offering to help her find her lost memories in return for her assistance. Afterwards he finds Jodie who apologies for having deceived Natoe, she then tells him to find \"the traitor\" and runs off. Sortly after he is reunited with Eight who, being the traitor of the city, has had his eyes cut out. Eight returns to the village with Natoe, confident he can still fight to protect the child.\n\nDeciding to take the offensive, the team of Natoe, Cue and Totsuma leave the village to infiltrate the humanoid Drei's Fort, where he has been constructing new humanoid experiments using captured test subjects. Natoe also discovers the immense newly upgraded \"Zex Beast\" creature and destroys it. However, Totsuma is caught in a trap and killed when the fortress collapses.\n\nReturning to the village, the samurai proceed to go on the defensive and protect the city from the massive Humanoid attack. During this attack, Eight sacrifices himself by blowing up one of the entrances to the village. After the ensuing battle of thousands, Natoe works his way to a fight with Zwei, defeating her and her three warriors before she retreats.\n\nThe village safe for the time being, however, the \"Man In White\" informs them that the city no longer need the sacred child and that Jodie has been kidnapped by the humanoids. Natoe and Cue team up to face the last of Humanoids at a facility called the \"Library of Avalon\". As they walk through the Library, they encounter several horrific creatures called \"Guardians\", along with Cue beginning to regain her lost memories. She is eventually kidnapped by Ein however, and Natoe fights through several Humanoids, including the \"Ultimate Zex\" incarnation and the immortal Fen. After defeating them, Natoe finally confronts the powerful and mysterious being known as Ein, who battles Natoe in his original humanoid form, then absorbs Cue to become the powerful god-like being called \"Almana\". Finding its only weak spot to be its angelic like wings, Natoe destroys them, then is able to attack its vulnerable body.\n\nNow having rescued Jodie, Natoe returns to village, but is confronted by the humanoid Zwei, in her last attempt to gain the power of the sacred jewel and the child. Natoe tries to fight Zwei but on a bridge and Jodie is knocked over the edge. Natoe grabs her in an attempt to pull her up but he is stabbed in back by Zwei. He succeeds in stabbing and killing Zwei, but the bridge collapses and he and Jodie fall to their death, leaving only two samurai left. After the aftermath, Kanbei quotes the original movie pertaining to their situation: \"So again we are defeated. The farmers have won. Not us.\"\n\nThe Steeple of Light is a tower located in the middle of the city in the game's setting. It houses various clones of the Sacred child along with the current girl herself who prays with the sacred jewel, and provides power to the surrounding city and areas. When the child and jewel are kidnapped, the tower loses its power source and sends the balance of species in to a war over her power.\n\n\"Seven Samurai 20XX\" received \"mixed\" reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic.\n\nThe game was criticized for its poor pacing, lack of voice acting, and linear gameplay with a lack of sufficient depth. GameSpot complained the combat system too direct, only requiring the player to use the square button to defeat enemies and that the combo system was unnecessary for progression. Other websites such as \"GamePro\" complained about the game being average merely due to the lineage it had to live up to due to its predecessor, \"Seven Samurai\", and did not live up to expectations for such a legendary film.\n\n"}

Clarke was first elected to Congress in 2006. From 2007 to 2013, her district was labeled the 11th until it was redrawn. Before entering Congress in 2007, Clarke was a member of the New York City Council representing the 40th council district in Brooklyn.\n\nClarke was born in Flatbush, Brooklyn, on November 21, 1964, to Lesley Clarke and former city councilwoman Una Clarke, both immigrants from Jamaica. She graduated from Edward R. Murrow High School and earned a scholarship to enroll at Oberlin College in Ohio, which she attended from 1982 to 1986. While studying at Oberlin, she spent a summer interning in the Washington, D.C. office of New York congressman Major Owens, where she told \"Roll Call\" that she worked on legislative issues involving Caribbean-American trade.\n\nBefore entering politics, Clarke worked as a childcare specialist and trained community residents to care for the children of working parents. Later, Clarke served as an assistant to State Senator Velmanette Montgomery and Assemblywoman Barbara Clark, both of Queens. Clarke also worked as director of business development for the Bronx Overall Economic Development Corporation and was the second director of the Bronx portion of the New York City Empowerment Zone.\n\nBrooklyn's 40th council district elected Clarke to the New York City Council in 2001. She succeeded her mother, former City Council member Una S. T. Clarke, who held the seat for more than a decade, making theirs the first mother-to-daughter succession in city council.\n\nShe cosponsored City Council resolutions that opposed the war in Iraq, criticized the federal USA PATRIOT Act, and called for a national moratorium on the death penalty. She was a frequent critic of the Bush administration's policies, and opposed budget cuts by Bush and the Republican Congress on several programs addressing women's rights and poverty. She later voted against extending provisions of the Patriot Act after the election of President Barack Obama.\n\nClarke's district, redrawn from the 11th in 2013, includes Brownsville, Crown Heights, East Flatbush, Flatbush, Kensington, Midwood, Prospect Heights, Prospect Lefferts Gardens and Park Slope.\n\nIn April 2007, Clarke was the sole member of Congress to oppose a bill to rename the Ellis Island Library after British-born Bob Hope, saying in a statement, \"Bob Hope is a great American and a fantastic human being, [but] I see the museum and all aspects of the island to be greater than any one human being.”\n\nOn September 29, 2008, she voted in support of HR 3997, the Emergency Economic Stability Act of 2008. The act failed, 205–228. She wrote legislation written to improve the process of removing the names of individuals who believe they were wrongly identified as a threat when screened against the No Fly List used by the Transportation Security Administration, which passed 413–3 on February 3, 2009. In November 2009 she was one of 54 members of Congress who signed onto a controversial letter to President Obama, urging him to use diplomatic pressure to resolve the blockade affecting Gaza. On March 25, 2010, she introduced the International Cybercrime Reporting and Cooperation Act – H.R.4962.\n\nClarke supported the Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument Preservation Act (H.R. 1501; 113th Congress), a bill that would direct the Secretary of the Interior to study the suitability and feasibility of designating the Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument in Fort Greene Park in the New York City borough of Brooklyn as a unit of the National Park System (NPS). Clarke argued the bill was a good idea because \"this monument commemorates not only the sacrifices of soldiers in the Revolutionary War who dedicated themselves to the cause of liberty, but a reminder that even in wartime we must protect basic human rights. These thousands of deaths were an atrocity that should never occur again.\"\n\nOn September 17, 2013, Clarke introduced the Homeland Security Cybersecurity Boots-on-the-Ground Act (H.R. 3107; 113th Congress), a bill that would require the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to undertake several actions designed to improve the readiness and capacity of DHS's cybersecurity workforce. DHS would also be required to create a strategy for recruiting and training additional cybersecurity employees.\n\n\n\nClarke has said she supports a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Some of her stances have subjected her to public criticism by constituents in her district, which is roughly 20% Jewish according to estimates from a 2010 Census. In 2010, Clarke signed onto two petitions urging Obama to pressure Israel to resolve the Gaza Blockade, which she later retracted. In 2009, she voted against H.R. 867, which sought to condemn the controversial Goldstone Report commissioned by the United Nations. In 2015 Clarke indicated she would vote for President Obama's JCPOA, known as the Iran nuclear deal, despite appeals from some of her Jewish constituents and local advocacy groups to vote against the deal. In explaining her decision, Clarke said in a statement, \"Iran is on the verge of creating a nuclear bomb, right now. The JCPOA provides a pathway that holds great potential to forever change this reality.\" In 2015, Clarke attended Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu's speech before a joint session of Congress after initially expressing uncertainty.\n\nClarke has stated that she is pro-choice. She has earned high ratings from interest groups such as NARAL Pro-Choice America and Planned Parenthood for her votes against legislation that sought to place restrictions on abortion rights, including the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act of 2011, which would have prohibited federal funds from being used to cover abortions. Her ratings with pro-life organizations such as the National Right to Life Committee have been correspondingly low.\n\nClarke has consistently opposed legislation that seeks to reduce government spending and cut taxes, including voting against the Job Protection and Recession Prevention Act of 2012 which sought to extend tax cuts established during George W. Bush's administration through the end of 2013. Clarke received a 92% rating from the \"National Journal\" for being liberal on economic policy in 2011, while she received a low 15% rating from the National Taxpayers Union for her positions on tax and spending in 2011, and a 2% rating from the Citizens Against Government Waste in 2010.\n\nClarke has supported efforts to combat climate change and limit fossil fuel consumption. She has generally opposed legislation that gives priority to economic over conservation interests, such as the Stop the War on Coal Act of 2012 and the Conservation and Economic Growth Act of 2012. She has supported legislation that increases conservation efforts and regulation of the energy industry, such as the Offshore Drilling Regulations and Other Energy Law Amendments Act of 2010. Clarke received 100 percent ratings from Environment America, the League of Conservation Voters, and the Sierra Club, the latter on her clean water positions, in 2011 while she received a low rating of 14% over the period 2008–11 from the Global Exchange for her loyalty to the finance, insurance, and real estate lobbies. She was strongly critical of the Trump administration's decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement.\n\nClarke has called for immigration reform that would create a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants living in the United States and direct resources away from enforcement. In 2010, she voted for the DREAM Act which passed the House but was blocked in the Senate. Clarke has voted against legislative proposals to constrain immigration. She praised the Obama administration's DACA program and condemned the Trump administration's termination of the program, calling the move \"cruel and vindictive.\" She has also called for extending the Temporary Protected Status that was granted to Haitian immigrants seeking refuge after the 2010 earthquake in Haiti. She has also called for the abolition of ICE.\n\nOn April 10, 2019, Clarke and Senators Ron Wyden and Cory Booker introduced the Algorithmic Accountability Act of 2019, legislation granting additional powers to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in addition to forcing companies to study whether race, gender or other biases influence their technology.\n\nOn the \"Colbert Report\", in its \"Better Know a District\" segment in early September 2012, when Stephen Colbert asked Clarke what she'd have changed back in 1898 (the year Brooklyn merged with New York City) if she could go back in time, Clarke answered the abolition of slavery. Colbert replied, \"Slavery…Really? I didn't realize there was slavery in Brooklyn in 1898\". (Slavery was abolished in New York State in 1827.) Clarke immediately followed up with, \"I'm pretty sure there was\" stating the Dutch owned slaves in New York in 1898. The next day, Clarke was unavailable for comment, and her media representative stated the statements were meant in humor.\n\nClarke endorsed Hillary Clinton in 2016 and cast a vote for her as a super delegate at the 2016 Democratic National Convention. During Clinton's 2016 campaign, Clarke appeared with Clinton at an event in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, at Medgar Evers College.\n\nIn 2004, Clarke, then still a member of the New York City Council, made her first run for Congress for the 11th district against incumbent Major Owens, for whom she had interned in college. Clarke's run followed an unsuccessful bid by her mother in 2000 against Owens for the same seat. Clarke lost the 2004 Democratic primary against Owens, who won 45.4% of the vote to her 28.9% in a multi-candidate race. Following the 2004 election, Owens indicated his desire to retire from Congress and declined to seek reelection, after which Clarke announced her intention to run again in 2006. Owens later called Clarke and her mother's successive political campaigns against him \"[a] stab in the back.\"\n\nIn May 2006, another Caribbean-American candidate, Assemblyman N. Nick Perry, withdrew from the race to succeed Congressman Major Owens, leading some observers to contend that Clarke's chances for winning the race would improve now that another candidate from the same community was no longer competing.\n\nIn August 2006, \"Crain's New York Business\" and the \"Daily News\" reported that Clarke's Oberlin transcripts indicated that she did not graduate, contrary to what was claimed in her campaign literature. Clarke initially said she thought she had earned sufficient credits to graduate from Oberlin, and then later said she had completed her degree by attending courses at Medgar Evers College. In 2011, Clarke suggested that she planned to finish her degree at Oberlin by completing independent academic projects.\n\nOn September 12, 2006, Clarke won the Democratic nomination with a plurality, 31.20%, of the vote in a four-person primary, defeating then-councilman David Yassky, State Senator Carl Andrews, and Major Owens's son, Christopher Owens. In the general election on November 7, Clarke was elected to the House of Representatives with 89% of the vote against Republican Stephen Finger.\n\nClarke was reelected on November 4, 2008 by a large margin.\n\nClarke was reelected on November 2, 2010 by a large margin.\n\nClarke was challenged in the Democratic primaries by Sylvia Kinard, an attorney and ex-wife of former New York City Comptroller and mayoral candidate Bill Thompson. Clarke defeated Kinard with 88.3% of the vote. She had $50,000 in her campaign account before the June primary. In the November general election, Clarke defeated Republican Daniel Cavanagh.\n\nClarke was reelected with 89.5% of the vote in November 2014, defeating repeat-challenger Daniel Cavanagh in the general election.\n\nClarke ran unopposed in the primaries and defeated Alan Bellone in the November general election with 92.4% of the vote.\n\nOn June 26, 2018, Clarke narrowly defeated primary challenger Adem Bunkeddeko with 51.9% of the vote. Clarke defeated Republican Lutchi Gayot, in the general election on November 6, 2018.\n\n\n"}

The company was started in 1978 and is based in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, England.\n\nThe name 'Eminox' is derived from the initials of two founders, Norman Emerson and David Milles, and 'Inox' which refers to \"stainless steel\".\n\nEminox is tuned to low to medium volume requirements with particular expertise in aftermarket and retrofit solutions, and the company uses advanced manufacturing techniques and adheres to Six Sigma methodologies. \n\nEminox's exhaust products include the following:\n\nEminox was formed on 28 January 1978 in Lincoln, and consisted of David Milles, Norman Emerson and William Murphy. An early order for a redesigned bus exhaust system for the local bus company led to orders from other national bus companies. The aim of the company was, and still is, to produce an exhaust system that would last for the lifetime of the vehicle, but that would also meet the requirements of the chassis/body configuration as well as the operating conditions.\n\nIn early 1979, Nocorrode, a local company that manufactured replacement stainless steel exhaust systems for cars and fire engines, went into receivership. Eminox purchased the company from the receiver, thus tripling its workforce from 5 to 15. With the purchase came Nocorrode's premises in Tillbridge lane, which became the new home for Eminox.\n\nIn 1985, the company opened its first standalone fitting facility for vertical exhausts systems, or 'stacks' as they became known. In 1989, Eminox also opened a new fitting facility in Stoke-on-Trent.\n\nIn 1987, the Tillbridge Lane site was at capacity, so an alternative site was identified in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire. Initially the new premises had no offices, but within 3 years a 4,000sq ft purpose-built office complex was completed.\n\nIn 1990, Eminox started producing exhaust systems for diesel multiple units for the rail industry. At this time, Eminox also developed a new aluminium mounting system for vertical stacks - the distinctive visual appeal of these units has since become synonymous with Eminox. \n\nIn 1990, Eminox established a relationship with Erland Nilson AB which provided access to the Swedish bus market, and in 1992 Eminox began to expand into the Dutch market. In 2005, Eminox branches were opened in Paris, France and Gothenburg, Sweden.\n\nBy 1994, Eminox was becoming increasingly aware of the growing environmental pressure to clean up diesel exhaust systems; in conjunction with Johnson Matthey, a leading chemical and catalyst technology company - Eminox developed the CRT (Diesel Particulate Filter) system which could filter out 90% of particulate matter.\n\nIn 2002, Eminox was awarded accreditation to TS 16949, the global automotive quality standard, which was derived from ISO 9001:2000\n\nCurrently Eminox employees in the region of 250 staff in Gainsborough, and elsewhere in the UK.\n\n"}

This technique is commonly used in basic science research and laboratory diagnostic purpose. This can be done on tissue section (fresh or fixed tissue), cell suspension, etc. An example is the detection of tumor marker, such as in the diagnosis of leukemia. It involves the labelling of white blood cells with antibodies directed against surface proteins on their membrane. By choosing appropriate antibodies, the differentiation of leukemic cells can be accurately determined. The labelled cells are processed in a flow cytometer, a laser-based instrument capable of analyzing thousands of cells per second. The whole procedure can be performed on cells from the blood, bone marrow or spinal fluid in a matter of a few hours.\n\nAn example of information provided through Immunophenotyping:\n\"The flow cytometric immunophenotyping report indicated the malignant cells were positive for CD19, CD10, dimCD20, CD45, HLA-DR, and λ immunoglobulin light chain. There was no coexpression of CD5 or CD23 by the monoclonal B-cell population.\"\n\nImmunophenotyping is a very common flow cytometry test in which fluorophore-conjugated antibodies are used as probes for staining target cells with high avidity and affinity. This technique allows rapid and easy phenotyping of each cell line in a heterogeneous sample according to the presence or absence of a protein combination.

Watching a patient walk is the most important part of the neurological examination. Normal gait requires that many systems, including strength, sensation and coordination, function in an integrated fashion. Many common problems in the nervous system and musculoskeletal system will show up in the way a person walks.\n\n<onlyinclude>\nPatients with musculoskeletal pain, weakness or limited range of motion often present conditions such as Trendelenburg's sign, limping, myopathic gait and antalgic gait.\n\nPatients suffering from peripheral neuropathy also experience numbness and tingling in their hands and feet. This can cause ambulation impairment, such as trouble climbing stairs or maintaining balance. Gait abnormality is also common in persons with nervous system problems such as cauda equina syndrome, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, myasthenia gravis, normal pressure hydrocephalus, and Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease. Research has shown that neurological gait abnormalities are associated with an increased risk of falls in older adults.\n\nOrthopedic corrective treatments may also manifest into gait abnormality, such as lower extremity amputation, healed fractures, and arthroplasty (joint replacement). Difficulty in ambulation that results from chemotherapy is generally temporary in nature, though recovery times of six months to a year are common. Likewise, difficulty in walking due to arthritis or joint pains (antalgic gait) sometimes resolves spontaneously once the pain is gone. Hemiplegic persons have circumduction gait, where the affected limb moves through an arc away from the body, and those with cerebral palsy often have scissoring gait.\n</onlyinclude>\n\n"}
{"id": "2045716", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2045716", "title": "Power Blade", "text": "Power Blade\n\nPower Blade, known in Japan as , is an action platform video game by Taito for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It was released in Japan on April 20, 1990, North America in March 1991, and in Europe on . The game spawned a sequel, \"Power Blade 2\", released in 1992.\n\n\"Power Blade\" takes place in the colony of New Earth in the year 2191 and follows NOVA, the Chief Security Officer of a supercomputer called the Master Computer. He must restore the Master Computer — which has been taken offline by aliens — by retrieving data tapes located in six sectors. The game features gameplay similar to the \"Mega Man\" series, in which players can select any of the six levels to play. Armed with a boomerang, players must complete all six levels, overcoming obstacles and defeating any enemies in the way.\n\nThe game's name comes from an item found in several levels; The Power Suit is an item that looks like a helmet. When collected Nova automatically equips the metal suit. This allows the player to shoot energy blasts known as \"Power Blades\" in any of the 8 directions and through most surfaces.\n\n\"Power Blade\" is a reworked and localized version of the Japanese Family Computer game \"Power Blazer\", which was released also by Taito on . The original title for North America was \"Power Mission\", after reworking the game they went with the name \"Power Blade\". The reworking included a complete overhaul of the levels, a change of the look of the main character from a cartoon–like robot to an Arnold Schwarzenegger look–alike, and a significant improvement in gameplay controls.\n\nThe title screen of the game features a picture of NOVA that closely resembles promotional images of Schwarzenegger in the 1984 film The Terminator. The box art, created by graphic artist Mike Winterbauer, also features a similar portrayal of NOVA. According to Winterbauer, \"a certain movie star's lawyers\" sent him a very unpleasant letter regarding the painting used for the cover. Winterbaum was able to prove that he had used a photograph of himself for reference and received no further unpleasant letters.\n\nThe player controls NOVA in a two-dimensional platforming environment. The object is to restore the Master Computer by going into each of six sectors of the Master Computer, accessing their databases, and recovering their data tapes. The player is armed with a boomerang in which the player can fire in all eight directions, destroying enemies. The ability to attack in all eight directions is indeed a rarity in 2-dimensional NES/Famicon platform games. Throughout each sector, players can upgrade the power, range, and number of boomerangs by collecting various power-ups. The player has a life meter which decreases every time the player is hit by an enemy; players lose a life if their life meter runs out, if they fall into a pit, or if time runs out. The game ends when the player has lost all lives, but the game has a continue feature in which players can restart their game at the beginning of the level in which their game ended. \"Power Blade\" also has a password feature which allows players to restart the game at a specific checkpoint at any time.\n\nIn \"Power Blade\", players can go through the six sectors in any order via a stage select screen. The objective in each sector is to find the agent who can give players access into that sector's database and then enter the database's security room, where players must defeat a security guard (boss) in order to gain access to the database itself and retrieve the tape. Once all six tapes have been gathered, the player gains access to the Master Computer's control center, where the player must destroy the alien overlord and restore the Master Computer back to its original state. One aspect of \"Power Blade\" that sets it apart from \"Power Blazer\" and \"Power Blade 2\" is that if the player falls off the screen they will die. In the other two games the player simply falls back to the previous area. \n\nAfter years of fighting that took millions of casualties, Earth is recovering from revolts in the 22nd century. In 2191, New Earth has a Master Computer that holds a secret database of the colony-planet's functioning. In wrong hands, the database could prove fatal to the whole planet. One day, aliens attack the Master Computer, making the Master control program malfunction. Nova, a lord of the ancient Power Blade is summoned to take care of the situation. The Power Blade is a glowing energy boomerang that Nova uses to defend himself.\n\nIn order to access the Master Computer's Control Center, Nova first has to obtain tape units from the six sectors surrounding the Master Computer. Each sector is heavily guarded by aliens, and Nova has to locate and contact an agent first to receive an ID card used to access the security room located at the same sector. After defeating the security room guards, Nova can obtain the sector's tape unit and use it to disarm the sector. After the six sectors have been disarmed, Nova must fight his way through the Control Center, destroy the Master Computer and restore order to the society.\n\n\"Power Blade\" first received coverage in the Western markets when it was first displayed at the Summer 1990 Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago. There, the game was called \"Power Mission\" and featured different character sprites from the finished version; \"Nintendo Power\" magazine called the game \"mega action in the tradition of \"Mega Man II\".\" It was the featured article and was on the cover in the April 1991 issue of \"Nintendo Power\". It was also covered in the NES section of the November 1991 issue of the UK gaming magazine \"Mean Machines\", where it received an 88% rating.\n\nhttp://yamako.ciao.jp/html/bio_e.html\n\n"}
{"id": "2045720", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2045720", "title": "Nouvelle Vague (band)", "text": "Nouvelle Vague (band)\n\nNouvelle Vague is a French cover band led by musicians Olivier Libaux and Marc Collin. Their name means \"new wave\" in French, and refers simultaneously to the French New Wave cinema movement of the 1960s, to the new wave music movement of the 1970s and 1980s, which provides many of the songs that the band cover, and to bossa nova (Portuguese for \"new wave\"), a musical style that the band frequently uses in its arrangements.\n\nThe group's recordings and live performances have featured a large rotating cast of mostly female vocalists. Several of the artists who have performed with the band have also had successful solo careers, including Camille, Phoebe Killdeer, Mélanie Pain, and Nadéah Miranda.\n\nThe group's first album, the self-titled \"Nouvelle Vague\", was released in 2004. Explaining how the project came about, Libaux later said: \"Marc Collin and I were both musicians and producers in the French music industry when, in 2003, Marc called me with this very strange idea of covering Love Will Tear Us Apart in a bossa nova version. I thought this idea was absolutely crazy but very exciting. So we decided to get into the studio and try it out as soon as possible. Then we did Just Can't Get Enough and Guns Of Brixton. We put the album together in just eight months. And after that we called ourselves Nouvelle Vague ... and that's the story!\"\n\nThe songs on the first album were recorded with female vocalists who reportedly had not previously heard the songs they would be singing. Eight singers feature on the album in total, including Eloisia, Camille, who performs four songs, and Mélanie Pain, who sings on two tracks. The album features remakes of songs by XTC, Modern English, The Clash, Joy Division, Tuxedomoon, The Cure, and The Undertones. The album was a commercial success, peaking at number 69 in the French album charts and spending a total of 39 weeks in the top 200. In 2006 it was reported that the album had sold more than 200,000 copies worldwide.\n\nThe group's second album, \"Bande à Part\", released in 2006, was again a commercial success. It charted in several European countries, peaking at number 23 in the French album charts, number 15 in the German charts, number 8 in Portugal, and reaching number 79 in the UK Albums Chart. The album includes versions of the Buzzcocks song, \"Ever Fallen in Love (With Someone You Shouldn't've)\", of New Order's \"Blue Monday\", \"The Killing Moon\" by Echo & the Bunnymen, \"Don't Go\" by Yazoo, \"Eisbär\" by Grauzone, and \"Heart of Glass\" by Blondie.\n\nIn 2008, Collin released an album titled \"Hollywood, mon amour\", consisting of recordings made following the Nouvelle Vague formula, of songs from 1980s film soundtracks. The album includes new versions of \"Eye of the Tiger\" from \"Rocky III\", and of the song \"Footloose\" from the 1984 film of the same name. Morcheeba's Skye Edwards performs versions of Duran Duran's James Bond theme song \"A View to a Kill\", and of Blondie's \"Call Me\" (which features in the 1980 film \"American Gigolo\"). The actress and singer Juliette Lewis performs a new arrangement of \"This Is Not America\" (from the 1985 film \"The Falcon and the Snowman\"). The album also features performances by the Israeli-French singer Yael Naim, by the Brazilian musician Cibelle, and by the Australian singer Nadéah Miranda, who toured with Nouvelle Vague for a time. A reviewer wrote of the album, \"The results can be more than surprising – who would have thought that Arthur's Theme (Best That You Can Do) could be transformed from nauseating manufactured rubbish into something sultry, smooth and genuinely romantic?\"\n\nOn \"3\" Depeche Mode's Martin Gore sings \"Master and Servant\" with Nouvelle Vague singer Mélanie Pain; Ian McCulloch of Echo & the Bunnymen duets with Pain on \"All My Colours\"; Marina Celeste performs \"Our Lips Are Sealed\" with Terry Hall of The Specials and Fun Boy Three; and Magazine's \"Parade\" is sung by Barry Adamson and Nouvelle Vague's Nadeah Miranda. For additional tracks that did not make the final album, Chris Bailey from Australian rockers The Saints performs a duet, likewise Samy Birnbach of Belgian new-wavers Minimal Compact.\n\nIn 2010 the group released an album of French-language remakes, \"Couleurs sur Paris\". The album features guest appearances from some well-known musicians, including Vanessa Paradis, Olivia Ruiz, and Cœur de pirate. It also features an appearance by Camille, who returns to perform a version of the song \"Putain putain\" by the Belgian band TC Matic.\n\nIn the same year, the group also released a fifteen-track \"Best of\" compilation. A special edition version of the compilation features an additional disc of rare and unreleased material.\n\nThe band's critical and commercial success peaked with the release of their second album, \"Bande à Part\". With the release of \"3\" and \"Couleurs sur Paris\", critics gave the band less attention. The band subsequently went into hiatus, releasing no new material and performing few live shows. Collin later explained this hiatus, saying, \"I was bored of myself doing covers,\" and citing diminishing critical acclaim: \"With the first and second albums, all the media said: ‘This is a great idea, a great rendition’ – and after the third album it was suddenly, ‘OK, it’s always the same thing, the same concept, we don’t want to talk about it'.\"\n\nA new album \"I Could Be Happy\" was released on 4 November. The title track, a cover of the song by Altered Images, was made available for download and digital streaming on 29 September.\n\nIn 2016 it was announced that the band would be releasing an \"anniversary album\" and a documentary, to be titled \"Nouvelle Vague by Nouvelle Vague and Some Friends\". The album is expected to feature \"four new remixes of existing material, four previously released covers re-recorded on location with traditional musicians in China, India, Mexico and Hungary, four new covers (provisional picks are tracks by The Ramones, Cocteau Twins, The Associates and Richard Hell) and – wait for it – four original songs.\"\n\nA new EP entitled \"Athol Brose\" was released on 2 September 2016.\n\nSeveral of the vocalists who have performed with Nouvelle Vague have subsequently found success as solo singers. Libaux has attributed this fact to Collin's talent for discovering female singers: \"I think he is the best talent scout in the world for female singers. All the female singers we have worked with are just beginning their career. For these girls to be part of Nouvelle Vague for three years - meaning you play 200, 250 gigs - I think it's a very good way to learn about this job.\" The band's singers have included Camille, Phoebe Killdeer, Mélanie Pain, Nadéah Miranda, Gerald Toto, Helena Noguerra, Liset Alea, Mareva Galanter, and Jenia Lubich. In 2010 the band released a compilation featuring solo work by several of their vocalists, under the title \"Nouvelle Vague: The Singers\". This includes Phoebe Killdeer & the Short Straws's \"Fade Out Lines\", which later became a major international hit when it was remixed by French producer The Avener, topping the charts in Germany, Spain, and Austria, and reaching number 3 in France and number 6 in Italy.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Comdr. J. D. Smith, USNRF, in command.\n\nAssigned to Caribbean shuttle runs after commissioning, \"Ramapo\" carried petroleum products from Port Arthur, Texas, to Guantanamo Bay and the Canal Zone until April 1920. Then she extended his range and through 1921 delivered fuel to ships and bases on the gulf and east coasts and in European waters. Transferred to the Pacific in 1922, \"Ramapo\" carried oil to ships and stations of the Pacific Fleet and made occasional trips to the Canal Zone and to the east coast until mid-1928, when he began to supply the Asiatic Fleet on a regular schedule. Beginning on 21 June, she carried oil from San Pedro to the Philippines and China and, for the next nine years, averaged four round-trips annually. En route she performed collateral duties as a survey ship and collected data in central and western Pacific island groups for the Hydrographic Office.\n\nOn 7 February 1933, while cruising across the Pacific Ocean from Manila to San Diego, the ship encountered the tallest rogue wave ever recorded, measuring in height.\n\nIn late 1937, \"Ramapo\" briefly interrupted her transpacific runs to discharge oil to ships and stations in the Aleutians, then resumed runs to the Orient, continuing them until the spring of 1941 when she was shifted to Hawaiian shuttle service. At Pearl Harbor when the Japanese attacked on 7 December, the tanker returned to San Pedro and made two round-trips to Bora Bora before resuming Alaskan shuttle runs. Arriving at Kodiak on 29 July 1942 on her first such run since 1937, she plied between Port Townsend and various mainland and Aleutian stations throughout World War II, completing her last run at Seattle on 23 September 1945. On the 27th, she steamed south and on the 30th reported at San Francisco for inactivation. Decommissioned on 10 January 1946, \"Ramapo\" was struck from the list on 21 January and transferred to the Maritime Commission on 1 July.\n\nThe \"Ramapo\" is credited with the rescue of the entire crew of the on 27 December 1942. \"Wasmuth\" was escorting a convoy through a heavy Alaskan storm when two depth charges were wrenched from their tracks by the pounding sea, fell over the side, and exploded beneath the ship's fantail.

Despite the heavy sea, \"Ramapo\" came alongside the foundering \"Wasmuth\". For three and a half hours, the tanker remained with the sinking high-speed minesweeper, battling the waves while successfully transferring his crew and two passengers.\n\n\"Ramapo\" received one battle star for World War II service.\n\n\n"}

Luscombe for Monocoupe Aircraft. The first Monocoupe (Model 5) was built in an abandoned church in Davenport, Iowa, and first flew on April 1, 1927. Various models were in production until the late 1940s.\n\nThe \"Monocoupes\" were side-by-side two-seat lightplanes of mixed wood and steel-tube basic construction with fabric covering. A braced high-wing monoplane with fixed tailskid landing gear, and the reverse curve rear fuselage lines that were to become one of the signature identifier features of the Monocoupes. The fuselage framework was built up of welded steel tubing in a rigid, triangular-framed Warren truss form for the side panel structures, heavily faired to shape with dural metal sheet formers and wooden fairing strips. The wings were built up of solid spruce spars with wing ribs of basswood webs and spruce cap-strips. The leading edges were covered with dural metal sheet and the entire framework was covered in fabric.\n\nThe aircraft was powered originally by either a 60 hp (45 kW) Anzani engine or the unsuccessful 65 hp (48 kW) Detroit Air Cat radial. The Model 22 was the first light aircraft awarded a type certificate (number 22) and in 1930 it was fitted with the Velie M-5 62 hp (46 kW) five-cylinder radial engine to become the Model 70.\n\nIn 1930 Monocoupe introduced the Model 90 with refined lines and a fuselage that was slightly longer and wider, this being sold in Model 90 and Model 90A versions with a 90 hp (67 kW) Lambert R-266 radial engine. The Monocoupe 90 DeLuxe introduced trailing edge flaps, wheel speed fairings and an improved engine cowling. The Model 90AF was fitted with a 115 hp (86 kW) Franklin engine. The Model 90AL had Avco Lycoming engines. The Model 90J was introduced in 1930 with a 90 hp (67 kW) Warner Scarab Jr engine.\n\nThe final two high performance Monocoupe models developed from the Model 90 were the Model 110 with a 110 hp (82 kW) Warner Scarab, and the Model 125 with a 125 hp (93 kW) Kinner B-5 engine. The Monocoupe 110 Special was a clipped wing racing aircraft. The Monocoupe Model 70V of 1932, had the low-powered 65 hp (48-kW) Velie M-5 engine reintroduced to provide more economical operation at the cost of a fall in performance.\n\nIn 1941 \"Monocoupe\" combined with three other companies to form Universal Molded Products Corp. 20 Model 90AFs were bought by the USAAF, who designated them the Universal L-7, for transfer to the Free French Forces. One was lost during delivery. \n\nAircraft production halted during World War II, resuming briefly in 1948-1950 under the name Monocoupe Airplane and Engine Corporation. \n\nThe last of this remarkable line of two-seat aircraft was the Monocoupe D-145 of 1934, a high-performance version with a slightly enlarged cabin and powered by a 145 hp (108 kW) Warner Super Scarab engine.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe majority of the Monocoupe 90s to be built were sold to and flown by private pilot owners.\n19 delivered early 1943 by sea to Abu Sweir, Egypt, to be reassembled by RAF MU 109.

In the late 1990s, WestAir was replaced by SkyWest Airlines which in 1999 was operating as United Express from the airport with nonstop and direct Embraer EMB-120 Brasilias to San Francisco International Airport. In 2007 SkyWest operating as United Express was continuing to fly Embraer EMB-120s nonstop to both San Francisco and Eureka/Arcata with direct one-stop flights to Sacramento. SkyWest ended all United Express service into Crescent City in 2015.\n\nFrom August 2017, the only remaining passenger airline service, flown by PenAir with Saab 340s via a code sharing agreement with Alaska Airlines, operated nonstop to the Portland International Airport in Oregon. This service then ended after PenAir filed for bankruptcy.\n\nOn February 28, 2018 Contour Airlines announced it would begin flying an Embraer ERJ-135 regional jet between Crescent City and Oakland with service which began on April 11, 2018. This new service marked the first time Crescent City has had scheduled passenger airline flights operated with a jet aircraft.\n\n"}

The chapters alternate between James McBride's descriptions of his early life and first-person accounts of his mother Ruth's life, mostly taking place before her son was born. McBride depicts the conflicting emotions that he endured as he struggled to discover who he truly was, as his mother narrates the hardships that she had to overcome as a white, Jewish woman who chose to marry a black man in 1942. \n\nIn \"The Color of Water\" author James McBride writes both his autobiography and a tribute to the life of his mother, Ruth McBride. Ruth married Andrew Dennis McBride, a black man from North Carolina. James' childhood was spent in a chaotic household of twelve children who had neither the time nor the outlet to ponder questions of race and identity. Ruth did not want to discuss the painful details of her early family life when her abusive father Tateh lorded over her sweet-tempered and meek mother Mameh. Ruth had cut all ties with her Jewish family, as they had essentially disowned her when she married James' father.\n\nAfter arriving in the United States from Poland when she was two years old, Ruth spent her early childhood traveling around the country with her family as her father sought employment as a rabbi. Tateh eventually gave up hope of making a living as a rabbi. He settled the family in Suffolk, Virginia, and opened a store in the mostly black section of town, where he overcharged his customers and expressed racist opinions. When Ruth was a child, Tateh sexually abused her and made harsh demands on her to work constantly in the family store. Tateh cheated on his wife, in an affair of which practically everyone in town was aware. Ruth's brother Sam left home at age fifteen, and soon after, Ruth too felt she must leave. She wanted to escape the oppressive environment of both her family and the South. She was also pregnant by Peter, her black boyfriend in Suffolk, and wanted to deal with the pregnancy away from her family. She took trips to New York to stay with relatives, and later moved permanently to Harlem. Ruth's family disowned her when she left, disgusted with her preference for marrying a black man instead of a Jewish man, her general failure to embrace Judaism, and her defiance of her father. Ruth promised her sister Dee-Dee that she would return to Suffolk, but she could not reconcile her family's desires for her life with her own desires for her life. She betrayed her promise to return for Dee-Dee, and her relationship with her sister suffered as a consequence. This separation from her family recurs throughout the memoir as a painful element in Ruth's life.\n\nIn Harlem, Ruth met Dennis, a black man to whom she was immediately attracted. She married him, converted to Christianity, and became very involved with church activities. The couple experienced a certain degree of prejudice as a result of their interracial marriage. However, Ruth recalls these years of her life as her happiest ones. Dennis and Ruth opened the New Brown Memorial Church together in memory of Reverend Brown, their favorite preacher. They had several children, and eventually moved to accommodate their growing family. When Ruth became pregnant with Dennis's eighth child, James, Dennis fell ill with lung cancer, and died before James was born. Ruth mourned his death deeply and became desperate to find a means to support herself and her eight children. She approached her relatives for assistance, but they refused to have any sort of contact with her. Ruth met her second husband, Hunter Jordan, soon after. They married and eventually had four children together.\n\nJames weaves his own life story into his mother's story. Ruth's philosophies on race, religion, and work influence him greatly. Ruth always sent her children to the best schools, no matter the commute, to ensure they received the finest possible educations. She demanded respect and hard work from her children, and always treated them tenderly. She had an unwavering faith in God and strong moral convictions. To Ruth, issues of race and identity took secondary importance to moral beliefs.\nRuth died at her home in Ewing, New Jersey, on January 9, 2010.\n\n\n\n\nJames spoke of the Civil Rights Movement which foreshadowed his decision to lean towards the African-American side of his bi-racial identity. Many of his older siblings had also chosen to only acknowledge that they were African-American.\n\nThis symbolized her constant need for movement in order to deal with her stress and depression and escapism.\n\nWhen Ruth's mother sang the song \"Birdie, Birdie, Fly Away\", she was referring to Ruth as the bird, able to move so swiftly and easily, while she referred to herself as the handicapped bird who deserved to be sacrificed and killed. This foreshadowed her death.\n\n\nThe trade paper edition, published in February, 1998, was on the \"New York Times\" bestseller list for over 100 weeks (2 years), won the 1997 Anisfield-Wolf Book Award for Literary Excellence, was an ALA Notable Book of the Year, The New York Women's Agenda's first book for \"New York City Reads Together\" and has sold more than 1.5 million copies. It has been published in 16 languages and in more than 20 countries.\n"}

Taking place in Poland during the late 1930s and early 1940s, this melancholy film evokes the insecurity and despair pervading Poland at the time. The story begins immediately before World War II and centers on Pawel (Tadeusz Janczar), a member of a conservative, bourgeois family, and his love for the thoroughly jaded Lidka (Maria Wachowiak), a dancer. The mismatched pair finds momentary happiness during a trip to the countryside, however social conventions and the lovers' inability to defy them force Pawel and Lidka to part. The times change, war breaks out and ends; Pawel suffers at Auschwitz concentration camp and Lidka marries his cousin.

Lying opposite the island of Inishnee on Roundstone Bay, by road it is northwest of Galway and southeast of Clifden. Known as a haven for people in the creative arts, it hosts an annual regatta in July.\n\nThe anglicised name is usually considered an error on the part of the British colonial Ordnance Survey, which translated the village name; while \"Cloch\" certainly means \"stone\" or \"rock\", \"Rón\" means \"seal\", not \"round\". Still, the names Cloch na Rón and Roundstone may be totally independent. The bay is referred to as Round-stone Haven as early as 1684 (Roderick O'Flaherty), and the rock after which it is named stands like a marker at the entrance and is strikingly round.\n\nThe area to the north of Roundstone was occupied by the O'Flaherty family, who built a Dominican Priory about to the north of what is now Roundstone in the 15th century. Roundstone was established by Scottish engineer Alexander Nimmo in the 1820s, while building houses, roads and harbours throughout the West of Ireland. Fishermen from Scotland settled here, and in 1835 a Franciscan Monastery was built. By the end of 1840s it had a thriving fishing industry and a population of 400 people.\n\nRoundstone is known as a home for creativity and the arts. For many years some of the most important figures in Irish Art have painted there, including Paul Henry, Jack B. Yeats, Gerard Dillon and Nano Reid. Yvonne Kings Studio and the Stable Gallery are notable galleries in the village. The local Summerfest and regatta is held in July. Traditional Irish Nights are held weekly throughout July and August and offers music, song and dance from the Connemara area. Rock star Sting had a home in Roundstone in the early 1980s, where he wrote most of the songs for The Police’s third album, \"Zenyatta Mondatta\".\n\nRoundstone is twinned with the village of Noyelles-sous-Lens (a suburb of Lens, Pas-de-Calais) in France.\n\nFilms shot in Roundstone include \"The Mackintosh Man\" (1973) by John Huston, \"Into the West\" (1992) by Mike Newell, \"The Matchmaker\" (1997) by Mark Joffe, \" Marley & Me \" (2008) by David Frankel and \"Love Me No More\" (2008) by Jean Becker.\n\nThe village is connected to the rest of the national road network via a regional road, the R341, which connects it to the N59.\n\n"}

{"id": "2045778", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2045778", "title": "187th Infantry Regiment (United States)", "text": "187th Infantry Regiment (United States)\n\nThe 187th Airborne Infantry Regiment (Rakkasans) is a regiment of the 101st Airborne Division. The nickname \"Rakkasans\" is derived from the Japanese word for parachute (literally \"umbrella for falling\", 落下傘). The name was given to the 187th during its tour in occupied Japan following World War II. When a translator dealing with local Japanese dignitaries was trying to explain what their unit was trained to do, (and not knowing the Japanese word for \"airborne soldiers\") he used the phrase \"parachute-men\" (literally \"falling down umbrella men\"), or \"rakkasan\". Amused by the clumsy word, the locals began to call the troopers by that nickname; it soon stuck and became a point of pride for the unit. (Note that modern Japanese uses the English loanword パラシュート (\"parashūto\") for parachute.)\n\n, the 1st and 3rd battalions are the only active elements of the regiment; they are assigned to the 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 101st Airborne Division.\n\nThe regiment was originally constituted as the 187th Glider Infantry Regiment on 12 November 1942, and activated on 25 February 1943 at Camp Mackall, North Carolina. It was originally a two battalion glider regiment assigned to the 11th Airborne Division, the men of the 187th trained both as glider and parachute troops. They moved to Camp Polk on 9 January 1944 for glider training. The regiment staged at Camp Stoneman, California on 29 April 1944, and departed from the San Francisco Port of Embarkation on 6 May 1944.\n\nThe regiment arrived in New Guinea on 29 May 1944 and joined the New Guinea Campaign. The regiment departed New Guinea on 11 November 1944, and arrived on Leyte on 18 November 1944 to join the Leyte Campaign.\n\nThe regiment left Leyte, and joined the Luzon Campaign by assaulting Nasugbu Point Luzon on 31 January 1945, blocking Japanese forces as part of the advance on Manila from the south. From then until April 1945, the 187th fought their way from Nichols Field, Fort William McKinley, and Manila to Mount Macolod and Malepunyo.\n\nIn May 1945, the 187th moved into Lipa to refit, rebuild, and prepare for Operation Downfall, the planned invasion of Japan. At this time, the 3rd Battalion was formed and the regiment was redesignated a para-glider regiment.\n\nThe regiment was attached to the Provost Marshal General, U.S. Army Forces Far East from 1 June 1945 through 27 July 1945 at Manila. The campaigns in the Philippines were declared completed on 4 July 1945, and the regiment moved to Okinawa on 12 August 1945 for occupation duty. This is where the unit gained its name; Rakkasan, when it was the only unit to parachute onto Japanese soil at the time. After the war ended on 14 August 1945, the regiment subsequently moved to Japan on 30 August 1945, and was alleged to be the first foreign ground combat unit to enter that nation.\n\nIn April 1949, the regiment returned to the United States and was stationed at what was then Camp Campbell, Kentucky. It was redesignated the 187th Airborne Infantry Regiment on 30 June 1949 and remained assigned to the 11th Airborne Division. In early 1950, the 187th participated in \"Operation Swarmer,\" the largest peacetime airborne maneuver in history.\n\nThe 187th was selected as an airborne regimental combat team responding to the crisis in Korea. On 1 August 1950 the regiment became the 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team (ARCT) when supporting units were added and deployed to Japan, arriving on 20 September 1950. The advance party of the 3rd Battalion of the Rakkasans was the first to arrive in Korea, arriving at Kimpo Airfield on 23 September. On 24 September, it was placed under the operational control of the First Marine Division, relieving the 2d Battalion of the 7th Marine Regiment, arriving almost a week after Douglas MacArthur's surprise landing at Inchon on 17 September 1950.\n\nOne month later, on 20 October 1950, the regiment made successful combat parachute assaults near the towns of Sukchon and Sunchon, North Korea as part of the Battle of Yongju. The published purpose of that drop was to capture members of the North Korean Government fleeing Pyongyang and also to free American POWs being moved from Pyongyang toward the Manchurian border. Neither objective was realized but were followed by battles at Suan, Wonju, Kaesong, Munsan-ni, and Inje.\n\nThe 187th led the second and last parachute assault in Korea on 23 March 1951 as part of Operation Tomahawk.\n\nUnder BG Thomas J. H. Trapnell, it redeployed to Japan on 26 June 1951 where it became a strategic reserve but returned to Korea on 24 May 1952 to assist in the suppression of the prisoner rebellion at the Geoje POW Camp (aka. Koje Pow Camp during the Korean War) where prisoners had forcibly seized and held Brigadier General Francis Dodd, camp commandant, hostage for four days from 7 May 1952 (Koje Island Incident). After this, it once more returned to Japan on 18 October 1952 and made its final return to Korea on 22 June 1953. From late 1952 to 1953 the 187th was commanded by Brigadier General (later General) William Westmoreland. The unit returned to the United States in July 1955 and, the following year, became part of the newly reactivated 101st Airborne Division, Fort Campbell, KY.\nThe 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team consisted of the following units:\nThe following units were assigned by General Order 34 (Confidential) Headquarters 11th Airborne Division:\nThe following units were added on 23 August 1950 by General Order 41, 11th Airborne Division dated 22 August 1950:\nThe following units were attached on 26 August 1950 per General Order 42, Headquarters 11th Airborne Division dated 25 August 1950:\nOn 28 August 1950, Operations Order Number 1, IX Corps, the 2348th Quartermaster Air Packaging and Resupply Company was attached to the command of Colonel Bowen\n\nMany personnel from the 511PIR in the 11th Airborne Division were transferred to the 187th ARCT to bring it up to full strength for overseas deployment.\n\nDuring the Korean War, three members of the regiment were awarded the Medal of Honor: Lester Hammond, Jr., Rodolfo P. Hernandez and Richard G. Wilson.\n\nThe 1950s and early 1960s were a turbulent time for the Rakkasans, they returned to the US in 1955, this time to Fort Bragg, North Carolina. As part of a larger realignment of the army, under the Pentomic Division concept, the Rakkasans road marched to Fort Campbell in February 1956 to serve as the nucleus of the newly reactivated 101st Airborne Division.\n\nWhen the Pentomic concept that replaced regiments and battalions with battle groups was introduced in 1957, Companies A, B, and C of the 187th Airborne Infantry Regiment were redesignated as HHCs of the 1st, 2d, and 3d Airborne Battle Groups, 187th Infantry, respectively. The 1st ABG, 187th Infantry was assigned to the 11th Airborne Division in Germany from 1 March 1957 to 1 July 1958, when the 11th was inactivated and reflagged as the 24th Infantry Division. During its assignment to the 24th it was involved in the Lebanon intervention. On 8 February 1959 it was relieved from the 24th, rotated back to the United States and was assigned to the 82d Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, NC. Its colors were inactivated on 25 May 1964 and concurrently consolidated with the 1st Battalion, 187th Infantry (constituted and activated 1 February 1964 at Fort Benning, Georgia, as an element of the 11th Air Assault Division, and the consolidated unit designated as the 1st Battalion, 187th Infantry, an element of the 11th Air Assault Division (Test) at Fort Benning, GA. It was inactivated on 30 June 1965 when the 11th Air Assault Division and 2d Infantry Division were combined to form the 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile), during which time the elements of both the 11th and 2d were reflagged with new designations.\n\nThe 2d ABG, 187th Infantry remained assigned to the 101st Airborne Division and was inactivated on 1 February 1964 when the Army abandoned the Pentomic structure in favor of brigades and battalions.\n\nThe 3d ABG, 187th Infantry was not active during the Pentomic era. The colors were redesignated on 1 February 1963 as HHC, 3d Battalion, 187th Infantry, assigned to the 11th Air Assault Division (Test) at Fort Benning, GA, and activated on 7 February 1963. Over the next year, 3rd Battalion, 187th Infantry Regiment served as a test unit to help validate the Army's airmobile concept. It was relieved from the 11th on 1 February 1964 and the colors were assigned to the 101st Airborne Division at Fort Campbell, KY. There was no transfer of troops or equipment; instead, the existing 3–187th at Fort Benning was reflagged as 1–187th.\n\nThe Rakkasans moved back to Fort Campbell, Kentucky in February 1964, to serve as part of the 3rd Brigade, 101st Airborne Division. In December 1967 the 3d Battalion deployed to Vietnam, alongside 1st and 2d Battalion, 506th Infantry. Over the next four years the Iron Rakkasans fought in twelve major campaigns, conducting numerous air assaults and search and destroy missions. During one such mission in March 1968 Captain Paul W. Bucha, commander of D Company, received the Medal of Honor when he crawled through a hail of fire to single-handedly destroy a machine gun bunker with grenades near Phuoc Vinh, Vietnam. When the battalion colors returned to Fort Campbell the unit had distinguished itself by earning two Valorous Unit Awards, and its third and fourth Presidential Unit Citations for the battles of Trang Bang and Dong Ap Bia Mountain (commonly known as \"Hamburger Hill\"). The Iron Rakkasans emerged from the Vietnam War as the country's most highly decorated airborne battalion.\n\nAssignments in South Vietnam\n\nThe 3-187th Infantry's exploits from 10–20 May 1969 on hill 937 in the A Shau Valley were depicted in a 1987 movie using the hill's nickname Hamburger Hill as the title. For this action the unit received the Presidential Unit Citation.\n\nWhen the 101st returned from Viet Nam, most of its personnel in the rank of staff sergeant and below were discharged upon arrival at Oakland, California, or Seattle, Washington. What remained largely consisted of a command group of staff officers and senior NCOs. The division settled into buildings recently vacated by the \"U.S. Army Training Center, Fort Campbell, Kentucky.\"\n\nWhen the 101st was rebuilt, the separate 173d Airborne Brigade was inactivated and its assets used to form the 3d Brigade as an airborne unit consisting of 1–503d INF, 2–503d INF, and 3–187th INF. The partial airborne capability also extended to supporting units of the division (i.e., one company of three in a supporting unit was airborne). This lasted only until April 1974, when jump status for the 3d Brigade was terminated, and the Airmobile Badge (renamed Air Assault Badge later that year) was introduced.\n\nIn October 1983 the 1st, 2d, and 4th Battalions, 187th Infantry, were activated, and on 21 November 1984 a 5th Battalion was activated. The 1st and 2d Battalions were assigned to the 193rd Infantry Brigade in Panama and the 3d, 4th and 5th were assigned to the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) at Fort Campbell. The 4th and 5th were created by reflagging the existing 1–503d and 2–503d, the colors of which were soon reactivated in Korea within the 2nd Infantry Division (United States). The Panama-based 2–187th included one airborne company (Moatengators) within the battalion, and later jump status was expanded to the entire battalion. 2-187th was the last airborne battalion of the 187th. During a realignment of the United States Army's combat forces in 1987 the 1st and 2d Battalions were inactivated and the 5th and 4th Battalions were reflagged as the 1st and 2d Battalions, respectively.\n\nFrom July 1984 to January, 1985, the 4th Battalion, reorganized at TF-4-187 (Rakkasan Raiders) deployed to the Sinai Desert, Egypt as the United States' contingent of the Multinational Force and Observers peacekeeping mission.\n\nFrom September 1988 through March 1989, 1st Battalion reorganized as Task Force 1–187 and deployed to the Sinai Desert, Egypt as the United States' contingent of the Multinational Force and Observers peacekeeping mission.\n\nIn September 1990 the Rakkasans were deployed to Saudi Arabia during Operation Desert Shield. In February 1991 two companies from the 1st Battalion captured 434 Iraqi soldiers during the air assault into Objective Weber and on 25 February the Rakkasans conducted the deepest and largest air assault operation in history. Striking behind enemy lines into the Euphrates river valley, the assault led to the timely defeat of Iraqi forces and contributed to a total allied victory. The unit moved farther north than any other unit during Operation Desert Storm.\n\nFrom 1991 to 1993 the 3-187 was commanded by Lt. Colonel (later General) David H. Petraeus who renamed the battalion the \"Iron Rakkasans\" after the physical training test he created. CSM Donald Purdy was the Battalion Command Sergeant Major during this time.\n\nIn 1995 the Iron Rakkasans battalion was organized as Task Force 3-187 and deployed to the Sinai Peninsula in July 1995. The Iron Rakkasans were responsible for the southern portion of Zone C and based at South Camp, Sharm el Sheik, Egypt. During the deployment, they were instrumental in the recovery of casualties from an accident near one of the sector control centers and evacuating them to hospitals utilizing Multinational Forces Helicopters. On 23 November 1995, the 7.3 Gulf of Aqaba earthquake hit the Sinai Peninsula. Again the Iron Rakkasans performed road recon and rescue operations throughout the peninsula. The Iron Rakkasans earned an Army Superior Unit Award for their actions during the deployment. The unit returned to the United States in January 1996.\n\nIn September 1996, elements of Raider Rakkasan (2nd Battalion), Alpha Co. \"Blackhawks,\" Charlie Co. \"Hard Rock,\" and Bravo Co. \"Warriors,\" 2nd Battalion deployed to Saudi Arabia through April 1997 in support of Operation Desert Focus, providing force protection for U.S. personnel in support of U.S. air assets in Saudi Arabia relocated from Dhahran and from Riyadh to the remote Prince Sultan Air Base, Camp Eagle Town II. The move's purpose was force protection, and came in the wake of the 25 June 1996 terrorist bombing at Khobar Towers which killed 19 airmen and wounded many more. U.S. and Saudi Arabian officials agreed to split the $200 million cost of relocating more than 4,000 US troops. Some 2nd Battalion soldiers were awarded the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, the Army Achievement Medal Army Superior Unit Award and the CIB. LTC Twomey was the battalion commander. Elements of 1/187th, deployed to Saudi, were part of Operation Desert Eagle, From Sept. to Dec. 1997.\n\nFrom February 2000 through August 2000 1-187 deployed to Kosovo for peacekeeping operations as a part of Task Force Falcon in support of Operation Joint Guardian.\n\nIn 2001–2002, following the attacks of 9-11, the Rakkasans deployed to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom where they most notably participated in Operation Anaconda in the eastern Shah-i-Khot region.
