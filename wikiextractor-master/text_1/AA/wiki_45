She was also the fourth actress who played Jane, starring in the 1927 version of the Tarzan story, \"Tarzan and the Golden Lion\", opposite James Pierce, who played the title role. Also in the cast was Boris Karloff, who played a native named Owaza.\n\nDunbar left the movies upon marrying her second husband, wealthy Minneapolis society man Thomas Bucklin Wells, II, who apparently acted in one movie himself, \"Ain't Love Funny?\" released in 1927 by Film Booking Offices of America (FBO).\n\nShe is said to have had seven husbands, including theatrical producer Maurice (divorced); Thomas Wells (married October 1926-his death); South American millionaire Jaime De Garson (divorced 1931); boxer/actor Max Baer (married July 8, 1931-divorced 1933); portrait painter Tino Costa (married 1936 -annulled 1937); and Russell Lawson.\n\nShe and Lawson had two sons, Richard and Russell.\n\nWhen Dunbar was preparing to divorce Tommy Wells, she received a cable from him to come to Paris, where he was dying. She rushed to his bedside in the French capital and forgave him. He died in her arms, having succumbed to drug addiction. She received a $2,500 monthly income from his estate. She divorced De Garson, whom she married in London, to marry Baer.\n\nShe later styled herself as Dorothy Dunbar Wells. In 1936, she completed a book of poetry, but had not found enough nerve to send it to a publisher. She had long decided movies were behind her.\n\nDunbar asked that her marriage to French husband Costa be annulled because he was \"temperamental and cold.\" In December 1937, she sued family members of her former husband, Wells, seeking $270,000 in trusts from his estate, because she said they had misrepresented certain papers they gave her to sign after his death. They told her, she said, the documents were to make certain the trusts were held for her, but she learned later the papers were actually waivers of her interest in the trusts.\n\nAfter marrying Lawson, her seventh husband, Dunbar went by the name Dorothy Wells Lawson. She played bridge and golf, and won some trophies.\n\nShe died at age ninety in Seattle, Washington. Her memorial service was private by family.\n\n\n"}

The state park is located along U.S. Route 93 at the west end of State Route 319, northwest of the town of Panaca.\n\nThe site has been popular with local picnickers since the nineteenth century, when it was known as Cathedral Gulch. During the 1920s, its dramatic landscape provided a background for open-air plays and annual Easter ceremonies. Governor James Scrugham began acquiring and setting aside the area for preservation in 1924. It subsequently became one of the four original Nevada state parks created in 1935. Members of the Civilian Conservation Corps built picnicking facilities that are still in use as well as a stone water tower and stone restroom which are no longer in operation.\n\nThe park sits at an elevation of above sea level, and is typically arid with semi-hot summers, and very cold winters. In the summer, temperatures range roughly from in midday to at night. Rainfall is variable and thunderstorms prevalent.\n\nA majority of Meadow Valley (which lies along U.S. Route 93 from the towns of Caliente to Panaca) was covered by a freshwater lake nearly 1 million years ago during the Pliocene Era. The richly colored canyons of Cathedral Gorge (called the Panaca Formation) are remnants of this ancient lakebed. Over centuries, the lake began to gradually drain. Erosion began working away at the exposed portions of sediment and gravel that once composed the lake bottom. Rainwater and melting snow carved rivulets in the soft siltstone and clay shale, splitting tiny cracks and fissures into larger and larger gullies and canyons.\n\nIn areas below the eroded escarpment (dubbed the \"Badland\") it is difficult for plant life to take root in the constantly eroding clay. However, away from the clay, the park's diverse soil types allow various plant associations to grow. Fragile sand dunes are held firm thanks to a wide array of wildflowers and grasses, such as dune primroses and Indian ricegrass. Within the valley center, clay, sand, and gravel have melded to form a rich, granulated soil that encourages the growth of the following species: narrowleaf yucca, juniper trees, barberry sagebrush, greasewood, white sage, shadscale, four-winged saltbush. Rabbitbrush finds sanctuary in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and walkways. Very few species of cactus can tolerate the climate in Cathedral Gorge, where temperatures in winter can fall below freezing, and rise above in summer. Other trees, not native to the park, have been planted around the campground to provide shade.\n\nSmall mammals form a majority of the park's animal population: black-tailed jackrabbits, cottontail rabbits, coyotes, gophers, kangaroo rats, kit foxes, mice, and skunks. Deer can be observed infrequently near Miller Point during the late fall and winter. Birds are seen frequently around camp areas and near dense patches of shrubs. The natives include blackbirds, black-throated sparrows, finches, American kestrels, small hawks, ravens, roadrunners, American robins, sapsuckers, and introduced European starlings. Migratory birds include bluebirds, cedar waxwings, hummingbirds, and warblers. Various species of non-poisonous snakes and lizards are abundant. In the summer, the Great Basin rattlesnake may be spotted.\n\nKnown locally as \"caves,\" the park's extremely narrow slot canyons were cut from the mud that lay at the bottom of the lake millions of years ago. Explorers can crawl through tunnels to discover hidden chambers in the network of canyons which offer some coolness in the summer heat.\n\nPark facilities include a 22-site campground, ADA-accessible sites, group use area, restrooms and showers. A regional visitor center at the park entrance has interpretive displays and information about other parks in the area.\n\n"}

{"id": "1846085", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1846085", "title": "Estoppel in English law", "text": "Estoppel in English law\n\nEstoppel in English law is a doctrine that may be used in certain situations to prevent a person from relying upon certain rights, or upon a set of facts (e.g. words said or actions performed) which is different from an earlier set of facts.\n\nEstoppel could arise in a situation where a creditor informs a debtor that a debt is forgiven, but then later insists upon repayment. In a case such as this, the creditor may be \"estopped\" from relying on their legal right to repayment, as the creditor has represented that he no longer treats the debt as extant. A landlord may tell his tenant that he is not required to pay rent for a period of time (\"you don't need to pay rent until the war is over\"). Until the war is over, the landlord would be \"estopped\" from claiming rents during the war period. Estoppel is often important in insurance law, where some actions by the insurer or the agent estop the insurer from denying a claim.\n\nThere are a huge array of different types of estoppel which can arise under English law. It has been judicially noted on more than one occasions that the link between them is often tenuous. \"Treitel on Contracts\" notes that \"unconscionability ... provides the link between them.\" But they nevertheless have \"separate requirements and different terrains of application.\" The courts have generally abandoned any attempt to create a single general underlying rationale or principle; in \"First National Bank plc v Thompson\" [1996] Ch 231 Lord Millett said: \"the attempt... to demonstrate that all estoppels... are now subsumed in the single and all-embracing estoppel by representation and that they are all governed by the same principle [has] never won general acceptance.\"\n\nUnder English law, estoppel by, promissory estoppel and proprietary estoppel are regarded as 'reliance-based estoppels' by \"Halsbury's Laws of England\", Vol 16(2), 2003. Both \"Halsbury's\" and Spencer Bower (see below) describe all three estoppels collectively as estoppels by representation. These estoppels can be invoked when a promisee/representee wishes to enforce a promise/representation when no consideration was provided by him. The court will only enforce this lack-of-consideration promise if and only if it would be \"unconscionable\" for the promisor/representor to rescind from his promise/representation (\"it's not fair!\"). Estoppel when invoked in such a manner is often considered a rival or alternative to the doctrine of consideration under contract law. Only proprietary estoppel can create a cause of action in English law, though the other two can act in support of a cause of action or a reply to a defence. Under American jurisprudence, equitable estoppel is available only as a defence, while promissory estoppel can be used as the basis of a cause of action.\n\nThe requirement of inducement and reliance are broadly the same for all reliance-based estoppels: \n\nEstoppel by representation of fact and promissory estoppel are mutually exclusive: the former is based on representation of existing fact (or of mixed fact and law), while the latter is based on a promise not to enforce some pre-existing right (i.e., an intention as to the future). Proprietary estoppel can operate only between parties who, at the time of representation, were in a pre-existing relationship, while this is not a pre-requisite under estoppel by representation of fact.\n\nEnglish courts will consider unconscionability taking into account many factors, including the behaviour, state of mind, and circumstances of the parties. Generally, the following eight factors are determinative (Michael Spence, \"Protecting Reliance: The Emergent Doctrine of Equitable Estoppel\", Oxford: 1999, pp60–66):\n\nEstoppel by representation of fact is a term coined by Spencer Bower. This species of estoppel is also referred to as \"common law estoppel by representation\" in \"Halsbury's Laws of England\", vol 16(2), 2003 reissue.\n\nIn \"The Law relating to Estoppel Representation\", 4th edition, 2004 at para I.2.2, Spencer Bower defines estoppel by representation of fact as follows:\n\nA second definition can be found at Wilken and Villiers, \"The Law of Waiver, Variation and Estoppel\", 2nd ed, Oxford: 2003, at para 9.02:\n\nA representation can be made by statement or conduct. Although the representation must be clear and unambiguous, a representation can be inferred from silence where there is a duty to speak or from negligence where a duty of care arises. Under English law, estoppel by representation of fact is not a cause of action, though it may be a defence or acts in support of a cause of action. There is some debate whether under English law courts will take into account unconscionability under estoppel by representation of fact, although Australian courts clearly do.\n\nLord Justice Lewison, in his judgment as to the circumstances obtaining at the time of the withdrawal of Employment Tribunal (ET) proceedings did not draw the conclusion that the appellant, Dr Srivatsa, intended to concede the merits of his claim when withdrawing his ET action. In allowing the appeal of Dr Srivatsa against a prior judgement of a cause of action or issue estoppel, and in respectful disagreement with the judge of first instance, he said that the effect of that judge's decision was that, in the words of Mummery LJ in the case of\"Sajid v Sussex Muslim Society\", \n\nAs noted above, under English law, promissory and proprietary estoppel are both species of equitable estoppel.\n\nProprietary estoppel arises when A purports to give but fails to effectively convey, or promises to give property or an interest in property, to B, while being generally aware (\"Crabb v Arun District Council\") that B will expend money or otherwise act to his detriment in reliance of the supposed or promised gift, so much so that it would be \"unconscionable\" not to enforce the expectation (\"Taylor Fashions v Liverpool Victoria Trustees).\"\n\nFor example, in \"Dillwyn v Llewelyn\" in Chancery a father promised a property to his son, who took possession, expended a large sum of money on the house and otherwise improved the property. The father never actually gifted the property to the son. After his death the son, claiming to be the equitable owner, obtained a court judgment forcing the trustees to convey the land to him.\n\nSimilarly in \"Inwards v Baker\" [1965] 2 QB 29, a father encouraged his son to build a house on his own land, promising to leave that land to the son in his will. Subsequently, the son built a house and lived there for some 30 years. No transfer of land was made in the father's will when he died. It was held that despite this the personal representatives of the father were estopped from evicting the son.\n\nWhile the courts will generally uphold the expectations of parties, if the parties are themselves not clear about their expectations the court's starting point will be the detriment incurred by the parties (per Robert Walker LJ \"Jennings v Rice\"). Proprietary estoppel claims, therefore do not necessarily result in the transfer of the property to the claimant; in \"Jennings v Rice\" itself, there was a monetary award.\n\nIn June 2008 the House of Lords re-visited the doctrine of proprietary estoppel, and in the process was quite fierce in describing its limits. In that light, it must be very doubtful that Mr Jennings would have got the result he did: properly understood, \"Jennings v Rice\" is a bit of a muddle, probably concerning promissory estoppel, with a bit of \"quantum meruit\" thrown in for good measure.\n\nIn \"Cobbe v Yeoman's Row Management Ltd\" the House overturned the decision of a fairly heavy-weight Court of Appeal on the very issue of estoppel, thereby illustrating the level of confusion about the meaning of the doctrine. Lord Scott of Foscote, with whom the other Lords agreed, described at length that someone who seeks to rely on proprietary estoppel must establish an actual or certain interest in the property to which he claimed a right. Without that, he is not off the starting blocks.\n\nIn particular he remarked that the following rationes of Deane J in \"Muschinski v Dodds\" \"repay careful reading\" (his Lordship said they applied to proprietary estoppel as they do to constructive trusts):\n\nLord Scott added,\n\nHe then found that that was exactly what the Court of Appeal, no less, had done. Once the proprietary right is established, then and only then will the court consider the conduct of the party seeking to deny the right and if that conduct is wanting, will estop him from denying the right. The court should not begin with an examination of a party's behaviour.\n\nPromissory estoppel is the doctrine that prevents a party from acting in a certain way because the first party promised not to, and the second party relied on that promise and acted upon it. In English law, a promise made without consideration is generally not enforceable, and is known as a gratuitous promise. For example, a car salesman promises not to sell a car over the weekend, but does so, the promise cannot be enforced. If however, the car salesman accepts one pound in consideration for the promise, the promise is binding and enforceable in court. Estoppel is one of the exceptions to this rule.\n\nThe doctrine of Promissory Estoppel was first developed in \"Hughes v Metropolitan Railway Co\" but was lost for some time until it was resurrected by Lord Denning in the leading case of \"Central London Property Trust Ltd v High Trees House Ltd\".\n\nIn this case, the claimants let a block of flats to the defendants at an annual rent of £2500. However, they agreed to accept a reduction in rent to £1250, because the defendants were unable to find enough tenants due to the evacuation of London during World War II. This promise to accept a lesser rent was unsupported by consideration. At the end of the war the flats became fully let, and the claimants demanded the return to payment of full rent. Denning J held that they were entitled to this from the last two quarters of 1945. Denning mentioned in an \"obiter dictum\" that had the plaintiffs tried to be reimbursed for the full amount they would have been estopped from doing so even though no consideration was present. This is because the plaintiff represented that he would accept half the rent and the defendant acted upon this.\n\nPromissory estoppel requires (1) an unequivocal promise by words or conduct, (2) a change in position of the promisee as a result of the promise (\"not necessarily to their detriment\"), (3) inequity if the promisor were to go back on the promise. Estoppel is \"\"a shield not a sword\"\" – it cannot be used as the basis of an action on its own. It also does not extinguish rights. In \"High Trees\" the plaintiff company was able to restore payment of full rent (although estopped back rent was lost) from early 1945, but would have been able to restore full rent at any time after the initial promise provided a suitable period of notice had been given.\n\nEstoppel is an equitable (as opposed to common law) construct and is therefore discretionary. In the case of \"D & C Builders v Rees\" the courts refused to recognise a promise to accept a part payment of £300 on a debt of £482 on the basis that it was extracted by duress. In \"Combe v Combe\" Denning elaborated on the equitable nature of estoppel by refusing to allow its use as a \"sword\" by an ex-wife to extract funds from the destitute husband.\n\nPromissory estoppel is not available when one party promises to accept a lesser sum in full payment of a debt, unless the debtor offers payment at an earlier date than was previously agreed. This is the rule formulated in \"Pinnel's Case\", and affirmed in \"Foakes v Beer\". This rule has, however, been thrown into doubt by the recent decision of \"Collier v Wright Ltd\".\n\nNote that Promissory Estoppel should not be confused with Estoppel for Non-disclosure of Knowledge, colloquially known as 'Nolissory Estoppel'. This arises when a party to a contract indicates that they have some knowledge about the value or the potential success/failure of a contract to the other party, but refuses to share this knowledge or 'nol'. The party with the 'nol' is estopped from their non-disclosure, and is forced to impart it equitably.\nYet proprietary estoppel has also arisen by acquiescence. The leading case in this area is \"Ramadan v Dyson\" (1866) LR 1 HL 129.\n\nA legally binding contract occurs when one party makes an offer and receives an acceptance from the other party. A contract must consist of an offer and acceptance, the intention to create legal relations and consideration all must be present to make the contract legally enforceable. In contract law consideration is concerned with the bargain of the contract, each party to a contract must be both a promisor and a promisee. They must each receive a benefit and each suffers a detriment. The classic definition of consideration was given by the court in the case of \"Currie v Misa\" (1875) LR 10 Ex 153, referred to consideration as consisting of a detriment to the promisee or a benefit to the promisor, Lush J: “A valuable consideration, in the sense of the law, may consist either in some right, interest, profit or benefit accruing to one party, or some forbearance, detriment, loss or responsibility given, suffered or undertaken by the other\".\n\nThe doctrine of consideration can therefore be seen as a set of rules, which play the principal role in the decision by the courts as to which agreements or promises are found to be legally binding.\n\nPromissory estoppel is a term used in contract law that applies where there may not otherwise be an enforceable contract. The importance of promissory estoppel in contract law is that it has enabled legal obligations, which fall into the category of contract law but fail to show any consideration, to be argued for. Promissory estoppel provides a way in which promises can be legally binding even if no consideration has been given. Promissory estoppel relates to a form of future conduct. The doctrine of promissory estoppel may not make the total contract fully enforceable. The specific facts in the case must actually establish the elements of promissory estoppel before the contract becomes enforceable in law.\n\nThe promises within a contract will be enforced under the promissory estoppel doctrine, when enforcing the contract promises avoids injustice.\n\nLord Justice Denning is a leading figure in the field of promissory estoppel in the case of \"Central London Property Trust Ltd v High Trees House Ltd\" [1947] KB 130 (the \"High Trees\" case), was concerned with the modification of the rent payable on a block of flats during the Second World War. The importance of the case, however, lies in an obiter statement of principle which Denning LJ set out, “a promise intended to be binding, intended to be acted on, and in fact acted on, is binding so far as its terms properly apply”. Applying this principle, Denning held that a promise to accept a lower rent during the war years was binding on the landlord, regardless of the fact that the tenant had supplied no consideration for it. \nThere are limitations which must be satisfied to this doctrine which derived from both Lord Cairns in the case \"Hughes v Metropolitan Railway Co.\" (1877) 2 AC 439 and Denning LJ in the \"High Trees\" case. They are: \n\"Woodhouse Israel Cocoa Ltd v Nigerian Produce Marketing Board\" [1972] AC 741 held that a contract for the sale of some coffee beans was agreed to be payable in pound sterling. The sellers mistakenly sent an invoice stating price was payable in Nigerian pounds. At the time the value of sterling and Nigerian pounds was equal. The buyers accepted the delivery and invoice without objection. Subsequently the value of the pound fell quite dramatically in relation to Nigerian pounds. The buyers then sought to revert to pound sterling as stated in the contract. The buyers conduct in accepting the invoice unquestionably amounted to an implied clear and unambiguous promise to accept on those terms.\n\nThe full force application of the equitable maxim estoppel only allows a litigant to “use it as a shield and not as a sword” restricts the application of this doctrine to as far as only to provide a defence to a party and not to be used as a cause of action against another. In \"Combe v Combe\" [1951] 2 KB 215, CA a husband promised to make maintenance payments to his separated wife but failed to do so. The wife brought an action to enforce the promise invoking promissory estoppel. The court held that promissory estoppel does not create a cause of action and as such the requirement of consideration in formation of contract is still relevant. Promissory estoppel is a rule of evidence that prevents the promisor from denying the truth of statement which the promisee had relied. Denning LJ said: \"The principle does not create new causes of action where none existed before. It only prevents a party from insisting on his strict legal rights when it would be unjust to allow him to enforce them\". However, this requirement seemed changed in light of the decisions in \"Evenden v Guildford City AFC\" [1975] QB 917, here the courts held \"that promissory estoppel can be a cause of action.\"\nEarly cases indicated that there had to be a clear and unequivocal undertaking. However this was overruled by Secretary of State for \"Employment v Globe Elastic Thread Co Ltd\" [1980] AC 506. \nThe promise or representation must be “precise” and “unambiguous” although it does not mean that such promise or representation must be expressly made. The concept of ‘waiver’ has been recognised by both the common law and equity as a means by which certain rights can be suspended, but then revived by appropriate notice. \nIn \"Hughes v Metropolitan Railway Co.\" (1877) 2 App. 439 HL, It can be seen that this case did not involve a \"promise\" as such, but merely an \"understanding\". It had been suggested that Hughes could be restricted to \"relief against forfeiture\" cases, but this was specifically rejected in the later cases. This case was the one on which Denning placed considerable reliance in the \"High Trees\" case. It never applied to situations of part payment of debts, however, under the modern law the concept of waiver has been effectively considered within \"promissory estoppel\".\n\nIt remains unsettled whether promissory estoppel may arise in pre-contractual relationships. In the case \"Brikom Investments Ltd v Carr\" [1979] 2 All ER 753 CA, a landlord made an oral promise to his tenants that if they bought a 99 year lease to their flats he would repair the roofs of the flats at his own expense. After the leases had been signed by the tenants, the landlord repaired the roof at a cost of £15,000. The landlord then claimed a contribution from the tenants towards the cost of the repairs. The tenants refused to pay because of the promise made. The landlord claimed that Carr could not rely on her promise since she had not acted on his promise because she would have entered into the lease without any such promise having been made. However, Lord Denning was of the view that promissory estoppel may arise from promise made by parties negotiating contracts. Similar views was expressed in \"Durham Fancy Goods v Michael Jackson\" [1969] 2 QB 839, where Donaldson J. held that contractual relationship is irrelevant provided that there is “a pre-existing legal relationship which could, in certain circumstances, give rise to liabilities and penalties”.\n\nThe proof of possible detriment or prejudice, which will appear if the promisor is allowed to revert to his original promise, is required. In Ajayi V. Briscoe (1964) 1 WLR 1326 or where he alters his position as a result of relying on that promise when though he suffers no detriment. In Alan Co. Ltd V El Nasr & Import Co. (1972) 2 QB 18, Denning detained that detriment is not an essential element of promissory estoppel. Therefore, for a plea of promissory estoppel to succeed, there must be a change in circumstances of the promisee. This elementary composition of promissory estoppel has been the core and central topic of discussion in the evolution of the doctrine.\n\nThis doctrine does not operate to completely extinguish the original rights of the parties accruing from the contract. It only provides for the suspension of such right, which can subsequently be revived after certain event or time. In \"Tool Metal Manufacturing v Tungsten\" [1955] 1 WLR 761 HL, The courts held that generally promissory estoppel will merely suspend legal rights rather than extinguish them. However, where periodic payments are involved and a promise has been made to reduce the payments because of pressing circumstances which are not likely to persist, promissory estoppel can be used to extinguish legal rights. This final limitation to the scope of estoppel operates in the sense that the doctrine applies to representations relating to past and present events only by excluding the future events executory promise. However, promissory estoppel may permanently extinguish the rights of the promisor to claim lump sum after part-payment. In \"D & C Builders v Rees\" [1965] 2 QB 617, Lord Denning expressed that the: \nTo conclude, the above limitations help to clearly outline its parameters. This essay has defined with the use of cases to demonstrate the successful attempts to depart from the traditional approach set by the Hughes and the High Trees cases. The parameters of this doctrine seem presently not to be clearly defined. These consequences have caused the parameters of promissory estoppel to be no longer an established and well-settled area, which may interpret a huge problem to the development of contract law. The threats to the limitations of promissory estoppel, manifested from the continuing evolution of promissory estoppel, may pose turbulence in contract law and open the flood gate to litigation. Therefore, the application of the modern promissory estoppel replaces the traditionally limitations set in the landmark cases. This equitable doctrine which originally acts as an exception to the doctrine of accord and satisfaction with subject to limitations now appears as an open and unlimited doctrine.\n\nThe law relating to contractual estoppel was summarised in :\n\nThe civil law use of issue estoppel or \"res judicata\" (literally translated as \"the fact has been decided\") is relatively uncontroversial. It expresses a general public interest that the same issue should not be litigated more than once even when the parties are different. The criminal law application, called \"double jeopardy\" provides that a person should not be tried twice for the same offence. A notable case occurred as a result of the Birmingham Six case where the House of Lords ruled in \"Hunter v Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police\" that \"issue estoppel\" applied. Lord Diplock said:\n\n\n\n"}

It hosts the NASCAR Cup Series, NTT IndyCar Series, NASCAR Xfinity Series and the NASCAR Gander RV & Outdoors Truck Series. Known as \"America's premier short track\", it has formerly hosted such illustrious events as the IROC series, Denny Hamlin Short Track Showdown, and the USAC sprint car series. Due to Richmond Raceway's unique \"D\" shape which allows drivers to reach high speeds, Richmond has long been known as a short track that races like a superspeedway. With its multiple racing grooves, and proclivity for contact Richmond is a favorite among NASCAR drivers and fans.\n\nRichmond Raceway is the only track in NASCAR with multiple races on the schedule that hosts all of its events at night. The \"Action Track\" is noted for having sold out an incredible 33 consecutive NASCAR Cup Series races. The sellout streak ended in September 2008 partially due to the economic downturn, though the major factor in ticket sales was the impact of Tropical Storm Hanna. Richmond has hosted the final \"regular-season\" race, leading up to the start of the NASCAR Cup Series playoffs, each year since the concept was introduced in 2004 until 2018, when it was moved into the playoffs.\n\nIn 2010, the track introduced a state-of-the-art video scoring tower that boasts more LED square footage than any other in the motorsports industry. The cap features four HD LED screens that measure 38-feet wide by 24-feet high. The screens broadcast live race action and pre-produced video and graphics. The stem shows the running order and has the ability to rotate through the entire field. Prior to 2019, the raceway had track seating of 59,000.\n\nRacing sports has a long tradition in Virginia, dating back to colonial English times. From 1898 to the first World War, the Deep Run Hunt Club the Northside area of Ginter Park was the site of the club's somewhat annual steeplechase race. After a decade hiatus, the annual races were moved to Curles Neck in 1928 on the south side of Richmond.\n\nShortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor, all auto racing was suspended due to the second World War. From 1942 to 1945, no events were contested, as they were prohibited by the US government primarily on account of rationing.\n\nThe 1946 AAA Championship Car season was unique in that it was the first post-war IndyCar race and because the Atlantic Rural Exposition had built a new state fairgrounds at the old Strawberry Hill Farm near Ginter Park. The ½ -mile dirt track would be suitable for both annual \"Strawberry Hill\" horse races and car races, and was known as the \"Atlantic Rural Fairgrounds Track\", \"Strawberry Hill\", and \"Strawberry Hill Raceway\" On October 12, 1946, Ted Horn gained the distinction of winning the track's first race in an open-wheel Indy-style car.\n\nTwo years later, when the NASCAR schedule was being formed, this short track joined several others on the circuit. In 1953, the track began hosting the Grand National Series with Lee Petty winning that first race in Richmond. The original track was paved in 1968. In 1988, the track was re-designed into its present \"D\"-shaped configuration.\n\nThe name for the raceway complex was \"Strawberry Hill\" until the Virginia State Fairgrounds site was bought out in 1999 and renamed the \"Richmond International Raceway\". The Strawberry Hill Races, which are a series of steeplechase horse races were formerly held the third Saturday of April at the Richmond Raceway Complex. In 2001, the races were moved to Colonial Downs in New Kent County, Virginia's first Thoroughbred racetrack.\n\nRichmond Raceway is located at the Richmond Raceway Complex, which is an , multi-purpose facility.\n\nThe Richmond Raceway Complex also hosts the Intergalactic Bead Show, Virginia Golf Show, Bassarama, the Richmond Home and Garden Show, the RV and Camping Expo, the Richmond Boat Show, the Richmond Gun Show, the Richmond Classic Sports Card Show, the East Coast Sawmill and Logging Equipment Expo, the Craftsmen Classic Spring and Christmas Shows, Bizarre Bazaar Spring and Christmas Shows and other various arts and craft events.\n\nOutdoor festivals currently hosted by the Richmond Raceway Complex include the 102.1 \"The X\" chili cook-off, the ACCA Temple Pork Festival and concerts featuring local and national recording artists.\n\nOutdoor festivals that have been held there included the State Fair of Virginia, the Richmond Highland Games and Celtic Festival, the March of Dimes Bikers for Babies, the K95 Country Music Festival and the Virginia Food Festival.\n\nRichmond Raceway is home to two NASCAR races in both the Cup Series and Xfinity Series.\n\nThere are a pair of spring races, usually held on the last weekend of April. The Xfinity race is currently 250 laps (187.5 miles) and is named the ToyotaCare 250. The NASCAR Cup Series race is currently 400 laps (300 miles) and is named the Toyota Owners 400.\n\nThere are a pair of fall races, usually held on the second weekend of September. The 250 lap (187.5 miles) Xfinity race is currently sponsored by Virginia 529 College Savings Plan and is named the Go Bowling 250. The 400 lap (300 miles) fall Cup race is currently sponsored by Federated Auto Parts and is named the Federated Auto Parts 400. Under the current schedule it is the final race before the playoff-style Chase for the Championship series of races that determine the Cup champion begins, and the last chance for drivers to earn a place in the Chase.\n\nUntil 2005, Richmond was home to a fall Craftsman Truck Series race. Starting with the 2006 schedule, that date was transferred to Talladega Superspeedway. The Gander RV & Outdoors Truck Series will return to Richmond during the spring race weekend starting in 2020. Until 2009, Richmond was also home to a June IndyCar Series race. In July 2009, it was announced that IndyCar would not return to the Raceway in 2010. Richmond returns in 2020. Their return replaces Pocono Raceway after violent crashes at the track in 2018 and 2019 caused outcry from several drivers. One of them being Robert Wickens, who was involved in an early crash in 2018 that saw him fly into the catchfence, leading to him becoming a paraplegic.\n\n\n\n\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> \n\n"}

Her father Johann Florian Elssler was a second generation employee of Nikolaus I, Prince Esterházy. Both Johann and his brother Josef were employed as copyists to the Prince's Kapellmeister, Joseph Haydn. Johann was to eventually become valet to Haydn and attended Haydn up to and was present at Haydn's death.\n\nFrom her earliest years she was trained for the ballet, and made her appearance at the Kärntnertortheater in Vienna before she was 7. She almost invariably danced with her sister Therese, who was 2 years her senior; the sisters studied dancing with Jean-Pierre Aumer and Friedrich Horschelt beginning when Fanny was 9 years old, also traveling to Naples to study with Gaetano Gioja. After some years' experience together in Vienna, the sisters went in 1827 to Naples. While there, she had an affair with Leopold, Prince of Salerno, the son of King Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies, which resulted in the birth of a son, Franz.\n\nTheir success in Naples, to which Fanny contributed more than her sister, led to an engagement in Berlin in 1830. This was the beginning of a series of triumphs for Fanny's personal beauty and skill in dancing. After captivating all hearts in Berlin and Vienna, and inspiring the aged statesman Friedrich von Gentz with a remarkable passion, she paid a visit to London, where she received much kindness at the hands of Mr. and Mrs. Grote, who practically adopted the little girl who was born three months after the mother's arrival in England.\n\nIn September 1834 Elssler appeared with the Ballet du Théâtre de l'Académie Royale de Musique (today known as the Paris Opera Ballet), a step to which she looked forward with much misgiving on account of Marie Taglioni's supremacy on that stage. However, Elssler and Taglioni were exceptionally different dancers, and the Opera's management saw this as an opportunity to incite some controversy by hiring Elssler. Taglioni was known as a , represented by the lightness of her leaps and jumps. Elssler, on the other hand, distinguished her dancing with the precision in which she performed small, quick steps. Elssler's type of dancing was known as . The results of her performances, however, were another triumph for Elssler, and the temporary eclipse of Taglioni. Taglioni, although the finer artist of the two, could not for the moment compete with the newcomer's personal fascination. It was conspicuous in her performance of the Spanish \"Cachucha\" (from the 1836 Coralli/Gide ballet ) that Elssler outshone all rivals. Elssler was not Spanish, but her performances of the Cachucha were filled with fire and sensual life. The poet Théophile Gautier titled her the \"pagan\" dancer because of her performances in the Cachucha, juxtaposed with Taglioni, the \"Christian\" dancer. The success of Elssler and the Cachucha led to a widespread demand for more choreographed ballet dances of specific national flavor. These types of dances became very popular, and Elssler herself added a Polish \"\" (Krakowiak) and an Italian tarantella to her repertoire. Her image was often identified with pink satin and black lace as the fleshy, sensuous Spanish dancer, in stark contrast to depictions of Taglioni as the modest sylph in white. Elssler did not only possess technical gifts, her ability to perform dramatically was exceptional. Her performances of the great Romantic ballets, including \"La Sylphide\", \"Giselle\" and \"La Esmeralda\", portrayed heightened aspects of their former characters. This earned Elssler a place among the most talented and notable ballerinas of the Romantic ballet period.\n\nIn 1840 she sailed with her sister for New York for a tour arranged by Henry Wikoff, and after two years of unmixed success they returned to Europe. While in New York City, Fanny dined with and was escorted by John Van Buren, son of the President of the United States, Martin Van Buren. In Washing D.C., Congress closed so that no one need miss Elssler's performance. Elssler is considered by Lillian Moore to have been \"the most illustrious Sylphide ever to dance the role in America\", with the final scene bringing many audience members to tears. At the St Charles Theater in New Orleans, Elssler was contracted for two weeks at $1,000 for ever night that she danced.\n\nDuring the following five years Fanny appeared in Germany, Austria, France, England, and Russia. In 1845, she was invited to perform along with her rivals Marie Taglioni, Carlotta Grisi and Fanny Cerrito in Jules Perrot's \"Pas de Quatre\" in London, but she declined. In the same year, having amassed a fortune, she retired from the stage and settled near Hamburg. A few years later her sister Theresa contracted a morganatic marriage with Prince Adalbert of Prussia, and was ennobled under the title of Baroness von Barnim. Theresa was left a widow in 1873, and died on 19 November 1878. Fanny Elssler died in Vienna on 27 November 1884.\n\nShe was played by Lilian Harvey in the 1937 German film \"Fanny Elssler\". Lya Mara had previously played her in the 1920 silent film \"Fanny Elssler\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

January 1945) was a Czech pianist, classical music composer, educator and organizer of cultural life at Theresienstadt concentration camp.\n\nKlein was born into a Moravian Jewish family in Přerov and, showing musical talent early, studied piano with Růžena Kurzová and Vilém Kurz, and composition with Alois Hába (in 1939–40). He was forced to abort his university studies in 1940 when the Nazis closed all institutions of higher learning following their occupation of Czechoslovakia in March 1939. Since compositions and performances by Jewish musicians were banned, his own works could not be performed, though he managed to perform as a concert pianist under several aliases for a time, e.g., under the pseudonym Karel Vranek. Despite those harsh circumstances Klein managed to continue composing. In 1940 he was offered a scholarship at the Royal Academy of Music in London, but by that time anti-Jewish legislation prevented his emigration.\n\nIn December 1941 he was deported by the Nazis to Terezín concentration camp, where along with Leoš Janáček's pupil Pavel Haas, Hans Krása, and Schoenberg's pupil Viktor Ullmann he became one of the major composers at that camp. He gave concerts in secret, but the camp became one of the few in which artistic activity was eventually permitted by Nazis on any scale, if only to deceive the broader public as to their real intentions. His works from these years include music for string quartet (similar in tone to Berg's opus 3 work), a string trio, and a piano sonata, among others. Moreover, Klein performed as solo pianist at approximately 15 recitals, and also participated in chamber music performances (member of piano trio, piano quartet).\n\nKlein was deported to Auschwitz in October 1944 and then to Fürstengrube, a coal-mining labour camp, in October 1944, less than two weeks after completing his string trio. He died under unclear circumstances during the liquidation of the Fürstengrube camp in January 1945. He had confided his manuscripts to Irma Semtska, his Theresienstadt girlfriend, before leaving, and they were turned over to his sister Eliska at the war's end.\n\nHis work was influenced by Alois Hába, Arnold Schoenberg, Alban Berg, and particularly Leoš Janáček. He used melody from Janáček's \"Zápisník zmizelého\" as a theme in his \"Divertimento\" (1940).\n\nRecordings on Northeastern and on Koch International Classics, for example, have allowed modern listeners to evaluate the quality of his compositions of the 1940s.\n\n\nIn Prague, German artist Gunter Demnig collocated two Stolpersteine für Gideon Klein and Ilona Kleinová.\n\nThere is a Klein Trio, playing his music\n\n\n"}

She was the last woman to be hanged in the United Kingdom, after being convicted of the murder of her lover, David Blakely.\n\nDuring her childhood, her family moved from Rhyl, to Basingstoke in Hampshire, and, in 1941, to Hampstead in London. In her teens Ellis entered the world of London nightclub hostessing, which led to a chaotic life that included various relationships with men. One of these was with David Blakely, a racing driver engaged to another woman.\n\nOn Easter Sunday, 10 April 1955, Ellis shot Blakely dead outside the Magdala public house in Hampstead and was immediately arrested by an off-duty policeman. At her trial in June 1955, she was found guilty of murder and was sentenced to death. On 13 July, she was hanged at HM Prison Holloway.\n\nEllis was born in Rhyl in North Wales, the fifth of six children. During her childhood her family moved to Basingstoke in Hampshire. Her mother, Elisaberta (Bertha) Goethals, was a Belgian refugee; her father, Arthur Hornby, was a cellist from Manchester. The Register of Marriages gives Arthur Hornby as marrying Elisa B. Goethals, at Chorlton, in 1920. Arthur changed his surname to Neilson after the birth of Ruth's older sister Muriel in 1925.\n\nEllis attended Fairfields Senior Girls' School in Basingstoke, leaving when she was 14 to work as a waitress. Shortly afterwards, in 1941, the Neilsons moved to London. In 1944, 17-year-old Ruth became pregnant by a married Canadian soldier named Clare and gave birth to a son, whom she named Clare Andria Neilson, known as \"Andy\". The father sent money for about a year, then stopped. The child eventually went to live with her mother.\n\nEllis became a nightclub hostess through nude modelling work, which paid significantly more than the various factory and clerical jobs she had held since leaving school. Morris Conley, the manager of the Court Club in Duke Street, where she worked, blackmailed his hostess employees into sleeping with him. By early 1950 she was making money as a prostitute and became pregnant by one of her regular clients. She had this pregnancy terminated (illegally) in the third month and returned to work as soon as she could.\n\nOn 8 November 1950, she married 41-year-old George Johnston Ellis, a divorced dentist with two sons, at the register office in Tonbridge, Kent. He had been a customer at the Court Club. He was a violent alcoholic, jealous and possessive, and the marriage deteriorated rapidly because he was convinced she was having an affair. Ruth left him several times but always returned.\n\nIn 1951, while four months pregnant, Ruth appeared, uncredited, as a beauty queen in the Rank film \"Lady Godiva Rides Again\". She subsequently gave birth to a daughter Georgina, but George refused to acknowledge paternity and they separated shortly afterwards and were later divorced. Ruth and her son moved in with her parents and she went back to prostitution to make ends meet.\n\nIn 1953, Ruth Ellis became the manager of the Little Club, a nightclub in Knightsbridge. At this time, she was lavished with expensive gifts by admirers, and had a number of celebrity friends. She met David Blakely, three years her junior, through racing driver Mike Hawthorn. \n\nBlakely was a well-mannered former public school boy who was educated at Shrewsbury and Sandhurst, but also a hard-drinking racer. Within weeks he moved into her flat above the club, despite being engaged to another woman, Mary Dawson. Ellis became pregnant for the fourth time but had an abortion, feeling she could not reciprocate the level of commitment shown by Blakely towards their relationship.\n\nShe then began seeing Desmond Cussen. Born in 1922 in Surrey, he had been an RAF pilot, flying Lancaster bombers during the Second World War, leaving the RAF in 1946, when he took up accountancy. He was appointed a director of the family business Cussen & Co., a wholesale and retail tobacconists with outlets in London and South Wales. When Ruth was sacked as manager of the Little Club, she moved in with Cussen at 20 Goodward Court, Devonshire Street, north of Oxford Street.\n\nThe relationship with Blakely continued, however, and became increasingly violent and bitter as Ellis and Blakely continued to see other people. Blakely offered to marry Ellis, to which she consented, but in January 1955 she had another miscarriage after Blakely punched her in the stomach during an argument.\n\nOn Easter Sunday, 10 April 1955, Ellis took a taxi from Cussen's home to a second floor flat at 29 Tanza Road, Hampstead, the home of Anthony and Carole Findlater, where she suspected Blakely might be. As she arrived, Blakely's car drove off, so she paid off the taxi and walked the to the Magdala, a relatively large public house in South Hill Park where she found Blakely's car parked outside.\n\nAt around 9:30 pm David Blakely and his friend Clive Gunnell emerged. Blakely passed Ellis waiting on the pavement when she stepped out of Henshaws Doorway, a newsagent next to the Magdala. He ignored her when she said \"Hello, David,\" then shouted \"David!\"\n\nAs Blakely searched for the keys to his car, Ellis took a .38 calibre Smith & Wesson Victory model revolver from her handbag and fired five shots at Blakely. The first shot missed and he started to run, pursued by Ellis round the car, where she fired a second, which caused him to collapse onto the pavement. She then stood over him and fired three more bullets into him. One bullet was fired less than half an inch from Blakely's back and left powder burns on his skin.\n\nEllis was seen to stand over Blakely as she repeatedly tried to fire the revolver's sixth shot, finally firing it into the ground. This bullet ricocheted off the road and slightly injured a bystander.\n\nEllis, in apparent shock, asked Gunnell, \"Will you call the police, Clive?\" She was arrested immediately by an off-duty policeman, who heard her say, \"I am guilty, I'm a little confused.\" Blakely's body was taken to hospital with multiple bullet wounds to the intestines, liver, lung, aorta and trachea.\n\nAt Hampstead police station Ellis appeared to be calm and not obviously under the influence of drink or drugs. She made a detailed confession and was charged with murder. \nShe made her first appearance at the magistrates' court on 11 April 1955 and was ordered to be held on remand.\n\nShe was twice examined by principal Medical Officer, M. R. Penry Williams, who failed to find evidence of mental illness; an electroencephalograph examination on 3 May found no abnormality. While on remand she was examined by psychiatrist Dr D. Whittaker for the defence, and by Dr A. Dalzell on behalf of the Home Office. Neither found evidence of insanity.\n\nOn 20 June 1955, Ellis appeared in the Number One Court at the Old Bailey, London, before Mr Justice Havers. She was dressed in a black suit and white silk blouse with freshly bleached and coiffured blonde hair. Her defending counsel, Aubrey Melford Stevenson, supported by Sebag Shaw and Peter Rawlinson, expressed concern about her appearance (and dyed blonde hair), but she did not alter it to appear less striking.\n\nThe only question put to Ellis by prosecutor Christmas Humphreys was, \"When you fired the revolver at close range into the body of David Blakely, what did you intend to do?\"; her answer was, \"It's obvious when I shot him I intended to kill him.\" This reply guaranteed a guilty verdict and the mandatory death sentence. The jury took 20 minutes to convict her.\n\nEllis remained at Holloway Prison while awaiting execution. She told her mother that she did not want a petition to reprieve her from the death sentence, and took no part in the campaign. But at her relatives' urging her solicitor, John Bickford, wrote a seven-page letter to the Home Secretary, Gwilym Lloyd George, setting out the grounds for reprieve. George denied the request.\nIn a 2010 television interview Mr Justice Havers's grandson, actor Nigel Havers, said his grandfather had written to the Home Secretary recommending a reprieve as he regarded it as a \"crime passionnel\", but received a curt refusal.\n\nEllis dismissed Bickford (who had been chosen by Desmond Cussen) and asked to see Leon Simmons, the clerk to solicitor Victor Mishcon (whose law firm had previously represented her in her divorce proceedings). Before going to see Ellis, Simmons and Mishcon visited Bickford, who urged them to ask Ellis where she had obtained the gun. On 12 July 1955, the day before her execution, Mishcon and Simmons saw Ellis, who wanted to make her will. When they pressed Ellis for the full story, she asked them to promise not to use what she said to try to secure a reprieve; Mishcon refused.\n\nEllis then said that she had been drinking with Cussen for most of the weekend and that Cussen had given her the gun and some shooting practice. Cussen had also driven her to the murder scene. Following the two-hour interview, Mishcon and Simmons went to the Home Office; the Permanent Secretary, Sir Frank Newsam, was summoned back to London and ordered the head of CID to check the story. \n\nLloyd George later said that the police were able to make considerable enquiries but that it made no difference to his decision, and in fact made Ellis's guilt greater by showing the murder was premeditated. Lloyd George also said that the injury to the bystander was decisive in his decision: \"We cannot have people shooting off firearms in the street!\"\n\nIn a final letter to Blakely's parents from her prison cell, Ellis wrote \"I have always loved your son, and I shall die still loving him.\"\n\nThe Bishop of Stepney, Joost de Blank, visited Ellis just before the execution. Just before 9 am on 13 July the hangman, Albert Pierrepoint, and his assistant entered Ellis's cell and took her to the adjacent execution room where she was hanged.\nAs was customary in executions, she was buried in an unmarked grave within the walls of the prison. In the early 1970s the remains of executed women were exhumed for reburial elsewhere, Ellis's in the churchyard of St Mary's Church in Amersham, Buckinghamshire. Her headstone was inscribed \"Ruth Hornby 1926–1955\". Her son, Andy, destroyed the headstone shortly before he committed suicide in 1982.\n\nThe case caused widespread controversy at the time, evoking exceptionally intense press and public interest to the point that it was discussed by the Cabinet.\n\nOn the day of her execution, the \"Daily Mirror\" columnist Cassandra wrote a column attacking the sentence, writing: \"The one thing that brings stature and dignity to mankind and raises us above the beasts will have been denied her — pity and the hope of ultimate redemption\". A petition to the Home Office asking for clemency was signed by 50,000 people, but the Conservative Home Secretary Major Gwilym Lloyd George rejected it. The British Pathé newsreel reporting Ellis's execution openly questioned whether capital punishment—of a female or of anyone—had a place in the 20th century.\n\nThe novelist Raymond Chandler, then living in Britain, wrote a scathing letter to the \"Evening Standard\", referring to what he described as \"the medieval savagery of the law\".\n\nThough the execution was on the whole supported by the British public, it helped strengthen support for the abolition of the death penalty, which was halted in practice for murder in Britain ten years later (the last execution in the UK occurred in 1964). Reprieve was by then commonplace; according to one statistical account, between 1926 and 1954, 677 men and 60 women had been sentenced to death in England and Wales, but only 375 men and seven women had been executed.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Bickford told Scotland Yard that Cussen had told him, in 1955, that Ellis lied at the trial. A police investigation followed but no further action regarding Cussen was taken.\n\nAnthony Eden, the Prime Minister at the time, made no reference to the Ellis case in his memoirs, nor is there anything in his papers. He accepted that the decision was the responsibility of the Home Secretary, but there are indications that he was troubled by it.\n\nForeign newspapers observed that the concept of the \"crime passionnel\" seemed alien to the British.\n\nEllis's husband, George Ellis, descended into alcoholism and committed suicide by hanging, at a Jersey hotel on 2 August 1958. In 1969 Ellis's mother, Berta Neilson, was found unconscious in a gas-filled room in her flat in Hemel Hempstead. She never fully recovered and did not speak coherently again.\n\nHer son, Andy, who was ten at the time of his mother's hanging, took his own life in a bedsit in 1982, shortly after desecrating his mother's grave. The trial judge, Sir Cecil Havers, had sent money every year for Andy's upkeep, and Christmas Humphreys, the prosecution counsel at Ellis's trial, paid for his funeral. Ellis's daughter, Georgina, who was three when her mother was executed, was fostered when her father killed himself three years later. She died of cancer aged 50.\n\nThe case continues to have a strong grip on the British imagination and in 2003 was referred back to the Court of Appeal by the Criminal Cases Review Commission. The Court firmly rejected the appeal, although it made clear that it could rule only on the conviction based on the law as it stood in 1955, and not on whether she should have been executed.\n\nThe court was critical of the fact that it had been obliged to consider the appeal:\nIn July 2007 a petition was published on the 10 Downing Street website asking Prime Minister Gordon Brown to reconsider the Ruth Ellis case and grant her a pardon in the light of new evidence that the Old Bailey jury in 1955 was not asked to consider. It expired on 4 July 2008.\n\nIn 1980, the third episode of the first series of the ITV drama series \"Lady Killers\" recreated the court case, with Ellis played by Georgina Hale.\n\nThe first cinema portrayal of Ellis came with the release of the 1985 film \"Dance with a Stranger\", directed by Mike Newell and featuring Miranda Richardson as Ellis.\n\nBoth Ellis's story and the story of Albert Pierrepoint are retold in the stage play \"Follow Me\", written by Ross Gurney-Randall and Dave Mounfield and directed by Guy Masterson. It premiered at the Assembly Rooms, Edinburgh as part of the 2007 Edinburgh Festival Fringe.\n\nIn the film \"Pierrepoint\" (2006), Ellis was portrayed by Mary Stockley.\n\nDiana Dors, who had starred in \"Lady Godiva Rides Again\", in which Ellis had had a minor, uncredited role, played a character resembling (though not based on) Ellis in the 1956 British film \"Yield to the Night\", directed by J. Lee Thompson.\n\nThe case was the basis for Amanda Whittington's play \"The Thrill of Love\". It premiered at the New Vic Theatre, Newcastle-under-Lyme, in February 2013 and subsequently played at St James Theatre London with Faye Castelow in the main role. Maxine Peake played Ellis in an adaptation of Whittington's play, broadcast on 5 November 2016 by BBC Radio 4.\n\nThe life of Ellis was the inspiration behind a musical play by Lucy Rivers, \"Sinners Club\". A co-production with Theatr Clwyd, it premiered at The Other Room Theatre in Cardiff, in February 2017.\n\nThe Ruth Ellis story was dramatised in the Murder Maps series of documentaries on the Yesterday Channel on 2 November 2017. It featured Monica Weller, ghost writer of \"Ruth Ellis My Sister's Secret Life\".\n\nThe story was also the inspiration for the 2015 opera \"Entanglement\" by the composer Charlotte Bray.\n\nThe case was re-examined by film-maker Gillian Pachter in the 2018 BBC Four documentary series \"The Ruth Ellis Files: A Very British Crime Story\".\n\n\n"}

Situated on a 36-acre hacienda-style campus, the Upper School is an all-girls boarding school which also accepts local students. The Lower and Middle School serves both boys and girls (preschool through 8th grade). Students in the Upper and Lower and Middle schools are required to wear uniforms. The school emphasizes building a sense of community that challenges its students mentally and spiritually. Santa Catalina is accredited by the California Association of Independent Schools and the Western Association of Schools and Colleges. In addition, the school is associated with the National Association of Independent Schools, the Association of Boarding Schools, National Catholic Educational Association, and the National Coalition of Girls' Schools.\n\nThe original Santa Catalina Convent was founded by Sister Marie Geomaere, a Dominican sister, in what is now downtown Monterey in 1850, when Monterey was the capital of California. With the help of Rev. Joseph Alemany, O.P., Bishop of Monterey, she created the first Catholic school in California, excluding mission schools. Students were predominantly daughters of local town residents and of nearby Spanish landowners and classes were taught in Castilian Spanish. In 1854 the school was moved to Benicia, the new state capital, where it was renamed St. Catherine's Academy.\n\nIn 1950, Sister Margaret Thompson, Mother General of the Dominican Sisters of San Rafael, California, decided to reestablish Santa Catalina in Monterey. After buying the 36-acre campus from a local cattle rancher, Col. Harold Mack, the school opened in the fall of 1950, with Sister Mary Kieran as the first principal. When Sister Kieran died in 1965, Sister Carlotta became principal, a title she held for 35 years. As principal, Sister Carlotta's goal was to \"educate the whole child... by guiding young people toward intellectual attainment and social, physical, and spiritual well-being.\"\n\nBoys were allowed to enroll in preschool and kindergarten at the request of Sister Jean, and Sister Carlotta encouraged male students to continue their education at the school through 8th grade.\n\nSister Claire, after serving as Head of Upper School since 1982, became Head of School in 2002. Sister Claire and Sister Christine still reside on campus, though both are now retired. \n\nMargaret Braddlee became Head of School in 2016 upon the retirement of Sister Claire.\n\nThere are 238 students in the Lower and Middle School; 61 percent are girls and 39 percent are boys.\n\nClass sizes are generally small, but vary by grade level as follows:\n\nTuition varies by grade level, and the school offers need-based financial aid. Below is tuition and financial aid information for the 2010-2011 school year.\n\nAs of August 2019, there were 216 girls enrolled at Santa Catalina: 113 were boarding students and 103 were day students. International students made up 19% of the student body. The average class size was 12 students, and the student-teacher ratio was 8:1.\n\nUpper School tuition varies between resident and day students, and both need and merit-based financial aid are offered.\n\nSanta Catalina Lower and Middle School \"encourage[s] each boy and girl to work effectively, to communicate articulately, [and] to approach life with a sense of purpose and competence\" and prepares students for secondary schooling.\n\nSanta Catalina School aims to \"combine a rigorous liberal arts curriculum, modern educational technology, and solid Christian principles\" to prepare its students for college and beyond. The single-sex environment, Catholic background, and college preparatory courses are emphasized to \"teach the importance of becoming leaders in our communities by serving others.\" The school attempts to develop each girl's abilities and emphasizes balancing intellectual growth with spiritual awareness. Santa Catalina also seeks diversity in order to enhance a student's sense of responsibility to her community and herself.\n\n\nSanta Catalina accepts students on the basis of academic achievement and personal qualification \"without regard to race, creed, color, or national and ethnic origins.\" The admissions office requires a questionnaire and writing sample, school transcript, teacher recommendations, parent statements, SSAT scores, an interview, and an optional personal recommendation. Non-native English speakers are required to take the TOEFL.\n\nAcademics are divided among the following departments: Art, Drama, English, Foreign Language (including French, Spanish, and Mandarin Chinese), History, Math, Music, Religion, and Science.\n\nSanta Catalina School offers 11 AP (Advanced Placement) and 7 Advanced Topics courses.\n\nThe school has two college counselors on campus who work closely with seniors and assist with students' college applications and SAT and ACT registration. In addition, the school has an online resource for students called Naviance, which provides further college counseling. In addition, approximately 65 colleges and universities from within the United States and abroad send representatives to Catalina to discuss their schools with students throughout the academic year. The average SAT score of students is 1732. 100% of graduates attend college and within the past five years the most-attended colleges were UC Davis (20 students), UCLA (11 students), Boston University (11 students), New York University (9 students), and Loyola Marymount University (9 students). \n\nFrom kindergarten to fifth grade, students take courses in art, computer studies, language arts, math, music, physical education, religion, science, and social science. Spanish classes are introduced in the 4th grade. In grades 6 – 8, students take classes in art, computer science, English, foreign language (Spanish), history, math, music, physical education, religion, and science.\n\nDespite the school's religious background, the current administrators are laypeople and not affiliated with a religious order.\n\n\nThe Upper School is ranked among the top 20 boarding schools for faculty education because a high percentage of the faculty has advanced degrees.\n\nIn 2003 a new outdoor aquatic center was completed, featuring a 25 yard by 30 meter pool that is connected to the gym's locker rooms. This 10 lane pool is used for physical education classes and the Upper School's swimming and diving and water polo teams. The pool was renovated beginning in 2018 and was unveiled for the second time in the spring of 2019. It is now fully functional.\n\nLocated next to the pool, the gym houses basketball and volleyball courts, bleachers, and dressing room facilities. PE classes and Upper and Lower School basketball and volleyball teams use the facility. The gym overlooks the pool and a regulation size softball and soccer field, which is encircled by an all-weather track. In addition, the gym is adjacent to 6 regulation size tennis courts, including one lighted court with stadium seating.\n\nResident students live in one of three dorms in either a single or double room, with faculty members living on each floor. Each room has a bed, desk, drawers, and lockable closet and there are common bathrooms for each floor. The dorms also come \"equipped\" with wireless internet, laundry facilities, and vending machines.\n\nThompson Dormitory — This dorm is used primarily for freshman and some sophomores, and also has faculty housing.\n\nGreer Family Dormitory — This is the newest dorm and houses sophomores, juniors, and faculty.\n\nHills Hall — For seniors and faculty.\n\nOriginally the Upper School classroom building, this 70-year-old building now houses the Upper School Admissions Office, Business Office, and Development Office.\n\nThis building houses a 150-seat recital hall, a dance studio, and music studios for private lessons. The building is primarily used for student music lessons and recitals.\n\nThe chapel is located in the center of campus and was built in 1954 as a donation from by Mrs. Marcia Ferrell Hart. San Francisco architect Germano Milono was commissioned to design the building. One of the most notable features is the chapel's stained glass windows. Today the chapel is used for weekly morning prayer offered for all students and faculty, weekly masses for resident students, on-campus faculty, and the public, as well as special events.\n\nThis building includes the student health center and the dining hall. The school uses Bon Appétit food services, who were the winners of the National Resource Defense Council's 2009 Growing Green Award for their commitment to sustainable food. Their menus often feature locally grown foods and leftovers are composted. Although their vegetarian and vegan options are often limited to the daily salad bar. \n\nFinished in 1967, the library holds about 34,000 volumes, 40 in-house periodicals, 500 media items, online databases, and 30 computers for students and teachers. It is used by both Upper and Lower Schools. The library staff are inconstant, and although the library is the only place with low volume and adequate couch space, rules constitute no napping.\n\nThe Performing Arts Center is a 500-seat, state of the art theater that is used for Lower School Spring and Christmas concerts, various recitals, and three Upper School performances every academic year. The Performing Arts Center also hosts the B.R.E.A.L. show (a performance put on by the student-run performing arts clubs) and Evening of the Arts (an arts showcase at the end of the year).\n\nUpper School assembly is conducted every morning in this building. Desks are provided for every student and are arranged by class. There are also a limited number of lockers available for student use. Because of the small size of the lockers, the difficulty in reaching them, and the limited number, students prefer open crates under their desks.\n\nCompetitive sports are offered, but not required, for students in grades 6 - 8. Teams compete by grade level with other public and private schools in the area.\n\nStudents can choose to participate in one sport per season. Teams compete in the Pacific Coast Athletic League (PCAL) and the CIF / Central Coast Section (CCS). The volleyball, basketball, tennis, soccer, water polo, lacrosse, field hockey, and softball teams compete at both the varsity and junior varsity levels.\n\nStudents may also participate in theatre or dance, rather than athletic teams, after school.\n\n\n\n\n"}

His orchestration of Richard Wagner's \"Wesendonck Lieder\" is still the most commonly performed version. He was also a teacher, and included Ernest van Dyck and Wilhelm Petersen.\n\nMottl was born in Unter Sankt Veit, today Hietzing, Vienna in 1856. His date of birth has been reported variously as 29 July, 24 August, and 29 August. After early voice training at the Löwenburg Konvikt, a training school for the Imperial Court Chapel, he had a successful career at the Vienna Conservatory. He was soon recognized as a gifted conductor of Wagner's music, assisted Hans Richter in preparing the first complete Ring Cycle at Bayreuth in 1876, and himself conducted \"Tristan und Isolde\" at Bayreuth in 1886. The best-known version of Wagner's \"Wesendonck Lieder\" is an orchestration by Mottl.\n\nFrom 1881 to 1903 he was chief conductor at the Karlsruhe Opera and was widely renowned for his work there, particularly in Wagner, Berlioz and Chabrier, whose operas he championed. In 1903 he conducted the premier of Friederich Klose's opera Ilsebill there to great accaim. He also orchestrated Chabrier's \"Bourrée fantasque\" and \"Trois valses romantiques\", and arranged a popular suite of orchestral excerpts from Christoph Willibald Gluck's operas.

He was known to friends and family as \"Phil\" and was also called \"Philibuck\", a nickname bestowed by Cubs manager Charlie Grimm.\n\nCavarretta spent almost his entire baseball career with the Chicago Cubs. He was voted the National League Most Valuable Player after leading the Cubs to the pennant while winning the batting title with a .355 average. His 20 seasons (1934–1953) played for the Cubs is the second-most in franchise history, behind Cap Anson. He managed the Cubs in his final three seasons with the club.\n\nCavaretta attended Lane Tech High School in Chicago, and signed a professional contract with the Cubs before finishing high school. In his first professional game with Peoria at age 17 in , Cavaretta hit for the cycle as a right fielder. That same year he was brought up to the Cubs to replace manager Charlie Grimm at first base. He first appeared in a major league game on September 16, 1934, less than two months after his 18th birthday, pinch-hitting unsuccessfully for the Cubs' shortstop Billy Jurges in the fifth inning of the first game of a doubleheader in Brooklyn. A week later, on September 25, in his first start and his first appearance at the Cubs' home park, Wrigley Field, Cavaretta hit a home run that supplied the winning margin in the Cubs' 1–0 win over Cincinnati. In his rookie season, he batted .275 with 82 runs batted in, also leading the league in double plays, as the Cubs captured their third pennant in seven years by winning 21 straight games in September; however, he batted only .125 in the World Series loss to the Detroit Tigers. Over the next several seasons he provided solid play at first base, routinely batting between .270 and .291 every season but one through 1943, though he lost significant playing time from 1938 to 1940 due to a hip injury and an ankle broken twice while sliding.

He batted .423 in the World Series against the Tigers, though the Cubs again lost, in seven games. In Game 1, he singled and scored as the Cubs took a 4–0 lead in the first inning, singled and scored again in the third, and homered in the seventh as Chicago took the opener 9–0.

He held a range of Air Force training appointments during World War II.\n\nFrank Robert Miller was born in Kamloops, British Columbia on April 30, 1908 to Hedley Miller and his wife Mary. After completing his education at the University of Alberta (where he gained a BSc) Miller joined the Royal Canadian Air Force at Camp Borden on September 15, 1931 with the rank of pilot officer. He received his wings on December 16 and was promoted to flying officer. Miller then underwent further training before becoming an instructor at the Camp Borden flying and navigation school in 1935. Promoted to flight lieutenant on September 1, 1937, he taught at the Air Navigation and Seaplane School, Trenton from May 1937 – September 1938. In September 1938, Miller was posted to England to attend the Specialist Air Navigation Course at the School of Air Navigation, RAF Manston, during which time he was promoted to squadron leader on April 1, 1939. At the outbreak of war in September, Miller was the Officer Commanding of the Air Navigation and Reconnaissance School, Trenton. He was promoted to acting wing commander in December 1940. From May 1942 Miller commanded the Air Navigation School at Rivers, Manitoba. Promoted to acting group captain in July, he commanded the General Reconnaissance School on Prince Edward Island before moving to the Air Force Headquarters in January 1943 where he served as Director of Training Plans and Requirements. He was promoted to acting air commodore in January 1943.\n\nIn 1944 Miller was posted to England and on September 19 he took up command of RAF Bomber Command's No. 61 Base in North Yorkshire, with the substantive rank of air commodore from October 14. No 61 Base was headquartered at Topcliffe and commanded the RAF establishments at Dalton, Dishforth and Wombleton.

The track conducted Thoroughbred flat racing and Standardbred harness racing between 1997 and 2014, and the racing returned to the track in 2019. It is owned by the Colonial Downs Group.\n\nThe track opened on September 1, 1997. More than 13,000 attended the track on opening day. The track used several unconventional construction and business approaches. They constructed one of the largest tracks in size in the country but built a relatively small clubhouse. They also built OTBs prior to the opening of the track. The track also struck a deal with Maryland to stop Maryland racing during the Colonial Downs thoroughbred meet, although this later ended. The tract of land on which the track is built was obtained through an eminent domain suit brought by the State of Virginia against an African American/Native American family (Tero Johnson) that had owned the majority of the land since 1863.\n\nUntil 2005, the track was managed by the Maryland Jockey Club under a complicated agreement with Virginia and Maryland regulators and the Maryland-Virginia Racing Circuit. The track was fairly successful and offered good summertime turf racing in the traditionally poor three-year-old turf division. The track ran two legs of the annual Jacobs Investments Grand Slam of Grass. This event consisted of the Colonial Turf Cup and the Virginia Derby from Colonial Downs, the Secretariat Stakes from Arlington Park and the Breeders' Cup Turf.\n\nThe track requested 25 thoroughbred dates in 2009, down from 45 in 2008. After negotiations with the track's horsemen and the Commonwealth of Virginia, the track ran 40 thoroughbred dates. The schedule originally ran from June 12 to August 4, 2009, but was later moved up one week. This allowed the track to run live racing on Belmont Stakes day, June 6. The fall harness meet ran 36 dates, from September 8 through November 7. The harness meet was timed to end on Breeders' Cup weekend.\n\nColonial Downs has not offered thoroughbred racing since 2013, due to a dispute between track management and horsemen's groups. Harness racing ended the following year, and all track-affiliated betting sites were closed in April 2015. The track filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, seeking clarity in recently-amended state horse racing laws, but the case was dismissed in the District Court on November 24, 2015.\n\nIn November 2015, Colonial Downs was denied 2016 racing dates by the Virginia Racing Commission. In rendering their decision, commissioners stated that Colonial Downs \"displayed callous disregard for the industry\" when it surrendered its unlimited racing license in 2014. A spokesman for Jacobs Entertainment said that all options to keep the track open have been exhausted.\n\nIn April 2018, Virginia enacted a law to allow historical racing machines (similar to slot machines) at the track and at off-track betting parlors, in an effort to make it economically viable to reopen the track. Weeks later, the track was purchased by Revolutionary Racing, a Chicago-based group of investors and gaming executives, for a price of over $20 million. Revolutionary Racing alongside other investors then formed the Colonial Downs Group, who currently own the track. Colonial Downs held its first race since 2013 on August 8, 2019.\n\nThe track has a one and one-quarter mile dirt oval, a seven and one half furlong inner turf oval and a one and one-eighth mile outer turf oval.\n\nHarness races start from a chute on the back stretch of the dirt oval, making for the only one-turn mile in harness racing.\n\nThe track featured an autumn harness racing meet. Colonial Downs was the only 1 and 1/4 mile track in North America with harness racing and features a one turn mile. The horses start from a chute on the backstretch. Harness racing times at Colonial Downs were the fastest in racing. On October 11, 2008, the world trotting record was set during the $100,000 Patriot Invitational. It was set by Enough Talk. The trotter became the first in harness racing history to break the 1:50 barrier with 1:49.3.\n\nThe following Graded events were held at Colonial Downs in 2019.\n\nGrade III\n\n\nThe following graded stakes were formerly ran at Colonial Downs:\n\n"}

Franco second wife was Ghita di Piero Gherardini, his third wife was Giovanna di Francesco Bruni. He was the brother of Giannozzo Sacchetti, a follower of Catherine of Siena, who was executed following the Ciompi Revolt. While still a young man he achieved repute as a poet, and he appears to have traveled on affairs of more or less importance as far as to Genoa, Milan and Slavonia.\n\nAfter 1363 he settled in Florence. When a sentence of banishment was passed upon the rest of the house of Sacchetti by the Florentine authorities in 1380 (after the Ciompi revolt) it appears that Sacchetti was expressly exempted, \"per esser tanto uomo buono\" (\"because he is a very good man\"), and in 1383 he was one of the eight, discharging the office of prior for the months of March and April.\n\nIn 1386 he was chosen ambassador to Genoa, but preferred to go as \"podestà\" to Bibbiena in Casentino. In 1392 he was podestà of San Miniato, and in 1396 he held a similar office at Faenza. In 1398 he received from his fellow-citizens the post of captain of their then province of Romagna, having his residence at Portico. The date of his death is unknown; most probably it occurred about 1400, though some writers place it as late as 1410.\n\nHe wrote sonnets, canzoni, madrigals, and other poems; his best known works are however his \"Novelle \"(short stories). They were originally 300 in number, but today only 258 remain, the rest having been lost. They were not fitted into any framework like that of Boccaccio's \"Decameron\". The best of them are of a humorous character; and their style is more simple and colloquial than Boccaccio's. The story given as a specimen probably exists (under one form or another) in the folk tales of every European nation.\n\nSacchetti died at San Miniato around 1400.\n\n"}

It was introduced alongside the Quadra 900 as the first computers in the Quadra series using Motorola 68040 processor. It is also the first computer from Apple to be housed in a mini-tower form factor, which in 1991 was becoming a popular alternative to standard desktop-on-monitor cases that were common through the 1980s.\n\nThe Quadra 700 originally had a list price of US$5,700, but had dropped to under $4,700 for a base model by the time its replacement, the Macintosh Quadra 800, went on sale in early 1993. The Centris 650, also introduced around the same time, offered incrementally more performance than the Quadra 700 in a desktop-style case at a price point closer to $3,000.\n\nForm factor: The Quadra 700 case is largely the same as the popular Macintosh IIcx and Macintosh IIci models; this made it possible for users of those models to upgrade to the more powerful Quadra 700. Users sometimes placed the older case vertically in a mini-tower orientation and the Quadra 700 recognized this by having the Apple logo and model name printed in the vertical orientation. The IIcx and IIci were designed to allow their rubber feet to be moved to the side for vertical orientation as well.\n\nCPU: Motorola 68040 @ 25 MHz. The clock oscillator runs at 50 MHz; replacing it with a faster oscillator (up to 74 MHz) results in a performance increase.\n\nMemory: The Quadra 700 could be upgraded to 68 megabytes of RAM, which with its 25 MHz processor made it a very useful computer for scientific or design work.\n\nExpansion: Two Nubus slots and a PDS slot; processor upgrades from Apple and other manufacturers were sold for the 700 when the PowerPC 601 accelerator cards came along in 1994.\n\nStorage: 80 and 160 MB hard disks were available at launch. A faster 230 MB unit became available in mid-1993 when the Quadra 950 was introduced.\n\nVideo: Like the IIci, the 700 has integrated graphics built into the system board but, unlike the earlier model, it uses dedicated VRAM for its video memory. The onboard video came with 512 kilobytes VRAM soldered to the motherboard, and supported resolutions up to 1152x870. The video memory was expandable to 2 megabytes via 6 256-kilobyte 100 nS VRAM SIMMs in each of VRAM SIMM expansion slots on the motherboard. Expanding the video memory to 2 megabytes allowed for 24-bit (Millions) color at resolutions up to 832x624.\n\nSound: The sound was 8-bit stereo.\n\nPorts: I/O was available with dual serial ports, an AAUI ethernet port, mic in, and a DB-25 SCSI connector. The Quadra 700, along with the 900, are the first Macintosh models with built-in support for Ethernet networking.\n\nOperating system: System 7.0.1 was included as standard. This is the earliest Macintosh model to support Mac OS 8.\n\n"}

He was a descendant of Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset. He succeeded to the barony on the death of his father in 1732. The first few years after his father's death were spent in Italy and Paris. On his return to England he took his seat, as 2nd Baron Conway, among the Peers in November 1739. Henry Seymour Conway, politician and soldier, was his younger brother.\n\nIn August 1750 he was created Viscount Beauchamp and Earl of Hertford, both of which titles had earlier been created for and forfeited by his ancestor Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset, Lord Protector of England, following his attainder and execution in 1552. The Seymour family had inherited a moiety of the feudal barony of Hatch Beauchamp, in Somerset, by marriage to the heiress Cicely Beauchamp (d.1393). In 1755, according to Horace Walpole, 4th Earl of Orford, \"The Earl of Hertford, a man of unblemished morals, but rather too gentle and cautious to combat so presumptuous a court, was named Ambassador to Paris.\" He appointed David Hume as his Secretary, who wrote of him, \"I do not believe there is in the World a man of more probity & Humanity, endowd with a very good Understanding, and adornd with very elegant Manners & Behaviour\". However, due to the demands of the French, the journey to Paris was suspended. From 1751 to 1766 he was Lord of the Bedchamber to George II and George III. In 1756 he was made a Knight of the Garter and, in 1757, Lord-Lieutenant and Guardian of the Rolls of the County of Warwick and City of Coventry.\n\nIn 1763 he became Privy Councillor and, from October 1763 to June 1765, was a successful ambassador in Paris. He witnessed the sad last months of Madame de Pompadour, whom he admired, and wrote a kindly epitaph for her. In the autumn of 1765 he became Viceroy of Ireland where, as an honest and religious man, he was well liked. An anonymous satirist in 1777 described him as \"the worst man in His Majesty's dominions\", and also emphasised Hertford's greed and selfishness, adding \"I cannot find any term for him but avaricious.\" However, this anonymous attack does not seem to be justified.\n\nIn 1782, when she was only fifty-six, his wife died after having nursed their grandson at Forde's Farm, Thames Ditton, where she caught a violent cold. According to Walpole, \"Lord Hertford's loss is beyond measure. She was not only the most affectionate wife, but the most useful one, and almost the only person I ever saw that never neglected or put off or forgot anything that was to be done. She was always proper, either in the highest life or in the most domestic.\" (Walpole visited Forde's Farm on several occasions from his residence at Strawberry Hill, Twickenham.) Within two years of the tragedy, Lord Hertford had sold Forde's Farm to Mrs Charlotte Boyle Walsingham, and a further two years later, she had re-developed the estate, building a new mansion which she called Boyle Farm, a name still in use today.\n\nIn July 1793 he was created Marquess of Hertford, with the subsidiary title of Earl of Yarmouth. He enjoyed this elevation for almost a year until his death at the age of seventy-six, on 14 June 1794, at the house of his daughter, the Countess of Lincoln. He died as the result of an infection following a minor injury he received while riding. He was buried at Arrow, in Warwickshire.\n\nLord Hertford married Lady Isabella Fitzroy, daughter of Charles FitzRoy, 2nd Duke of Grafton, on 29 May 1741. Her grandfather was Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Grafton (1663-1690), an illegitimate son of King Charles II. By his wife he had thirteen children:\n\n\nHe is not known to have suffered himself from any mental abnormality, but a noted strain of eccentricity, even madness, appeared among his descendants: the debauched behaviour of his grandson, the 3rd Marquess, and the suicide of another grandson, Viscount Castlereagh, were both attributed to a strain of madness supposed to be hereditary in the Seymour Conway family.\n\nLord Hertford died in Surrey, England.\n"}

{"id": "1846258", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1846258", "title": "Cucurbituril", "text": "Cucurbituril\n\nCucurbiturils are macrocyclic molecules made of glycoluril (=CHNO=) monomers linked by methylene bridges (-CH-). The oxygen atoms are located along the edges of the band and are tilted inwards, forming a partly enclosed cavity. The name is derived from the resemblance of this molecule with a pumpkin of the family of Cucurbitaceae.\n\nCucurbiturils are commonly written as cucurbit[n]uril, where \"n\" is the number of glycoluril units. Two common abbreviations are CB[n], or simply CB\"n\".\n\nThese compounds are particularly interesting to chemists because they are suitable hosts for an array of neutral and cationic species. The binding mode is thought to occur through hydrophobic interactions, and, in the case of cationic guests, through cation-dipole interactions as well. The dimensions of cucurbiturils are generally on the ~ 10 Å size scale. For instance, the cavity of cucurbit[6]uril has a height ~ 9.1 Å, an outer diameter ~ 5.8 Å, and an inner diameter ~ 3.9 Å.\n\nCucurbiturils were first synthesized in 1905 by Robert Behrend, by condensing glycoluril with formaldehyde, but their structure was not elucidated until 1981. The field expanded as CB5, CB7, and CB8 were discovered and isolated by Kim Kimoon in the year 2000. To date cucurbiturils composed of 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, and 14 repeat units have all been isolated, which have internal cavity volumes of 82, 164, 279, 479, and 870 Å respectively. A cucurbituril composed of 9 repeat units has yet to be isolated (as of 2009). Other common molecular capsules that share a similar molecular shape with cucurbiturils include cyclodextrins, calixarenes, and pillararenes.\n\nCucurbiturils are amidals (less precisely aminals) and synthesized from urea 1 and a dialdehyde (e.g., glyoxal 2) via a nucleophilic addition to give the intermediate glycoluril 3. This intermediate is condensed with formaldehyde to give hexamer cucurbit[6]uril above 110 °C. Ordinarily, multifunctional monomers such as 3 would undergo a step-growth polymerization that would give a distribution of products, but due to favorable strain and an abundance of hydrogen bonding, the hexamer is the only reaction product isolated after precipitation.\n\nDecreasing the temperature of the reaction to between 75 and 90 °C can be used to access other sizes of cucurbiturils including CB[5], CB[7], CB[8], and CB[10]. CB[6] is still the major product; the other ring sizes are formed in smaller yields. The isolation of sizes other than CB[6] requires fractional crystallization and dissolution. CB[5], CB[6], CB[7], and CB[8] are all currently commercially available. The larger sizes are a particularly active area of research since they can bind larger and more interesting guest molecules, thus expanding their potential applications. \nCucurbit[10]uril is particularly difficult to isolate. It was first discovered by Day and coworkers in 2002 as an inclusion complex containing CB[5] by fractional crystallization of the cucurbituril reaction mixture. The CB[10]•CB[5] was unambiguously identified by single crystal X-ray structural analysis that revealed the complex resembled a molecular gyroscope. In this case, the free rotation of the CB[5] within the CB[10] cavity mimics the independent rotation of a flywheel within the frame of a gyroscope.\n\nIsolation of pure CB[10] could not be accomplished by direct separation methods since the compound has such a high affinity for CB[5]. The strong binding affinity for the CB[5] can be understood since it has a complementary size and shape to the cavity of the CB[10]. Pure CB[10] was isolated by Isaacs and coworkers in 2005 by introducing a more strongly binding melamine diamine guest that is capable of displacing the CB[5]. The melamine diamine guest was then separated from the CB[10] by reaction with acetic anhydride that converted the positively charged amine groups to neutrally charged amides. Cucurbiturils strongly bind cationic guests, but by removing the positive charge from the melamine diamine guest reduces the association constant to the point it can be removed by washing with methanol, DMSO, and water. The CB[10] has an unusually large cavity (870 Å) that's free and capable of binding extraordinarily large guests including a cationic calix[4]arene.\n\nCucurbiturils have been used by chemists for various applications, including drug delivery, asymmetric synthesis, molecular switching, and dye tuning.\n\nCucurbiturils are efficient host molecules in molecular recognition and have a particularly high affinity for positively charged or cationic compounds. High association constants with positively charged molecules are attributed to the carbonyl groups that line each end of the cavity and can interact with cations in a similar fashion to crown ethers. The affinity of cucurbiturils can be very high. For example, the affinity equilibrium constant of cururbit[7]uril with the positively charged 1-aminoadamantane hydrochloride is experimentally determined at 4.23*10.\n\nHost guest interactions also significantly influence solubility behavior of cucurbiturils. Cucurbit[6]uril dissolves poorly in just about any solvent but solubility is greatly improved in a solution of potassium hydroxide or in an acidic solution. The cavitand forms a positively charged inclusion compound with a potassium ion or a hydronium ion respectively which have much greater solubility than the uncomplexed neutral molecule.\n\nCB[10] is large enough to hold other molecular hosts such as a calixarene molecule. With a calixarene guest different chemical conformations (cone, 1,2-alternate, 1,3-alternate) are in rapid equilibrium. Allosteric control is provided when an adamantane molecule forces a cone conformation with a calixarene - adamantane inclusion complex within a CB[10] molecule.\n\nGiven their high affinities to form inclusion complexes cucurbiturils have been employed as the macrocycles component of a rotaxane. After formation of the supramolecular assembly or threaded complex with a guest molecule such as hexamethylene diamine the two ends of the guest can be reacted with bulky groups that will then act as a stoppers preventing the two separate molecules from dissociating.\n\nIn another rotaxane system with a CB[7] wheel, the axle is a 4,4'-bipyridinium or viologen subunit with two carboxylic acid terminated aliphatic N-substituents at both ends. In water at concentration higher than 0.5 M complexation is quantitative without need of stoppers. At pH = 2 the carboxylic end-groups are protonated and the wheel shuttles back and forth between them as evidenced by the presence of just two aromatic viologen protons in the proton NMR spectrum. At pH = 9 the wheel is locked around the viologen center. More recently, rotaxane with a CB[8] wheel was synthesized. This rotaxane can bind neutral guest molecules.\n\nCucurbituril's host–guest properties have been explored for drug delivery vehicles. The potential of this application has been explored with cucurbit[7]uril that forms an inclusion compound with the important cancer fighting drug oxaliplatin. CB[7] was employed despite the fact that it is more difficult to isolate since it has much greater solubility in water and its larger cavity size can accommodate the drug molecule. The resulting complex was found to have increased stability and greater selectivity that may lead to fewer side effects.\n\nCucurbiturils have also been explored as supramolecular catalysts. Larger cucurbiturils, such as cucurbit[8]uril can bind multiple guest molecules. CB[8] forms a complex 2:1 (guest:host) with (E)-diaminostilbene dihydrochloride which is accommodated by CB[8]'s larger internal diameter of 8.8 angstrom and height 9.1 angstrom. The close proximity and optimal orientation of the guest molecules within the cavity enhances the rate of the photochemical cyclization to give cyclobutane dimer with a 19:1 stereoselectivity for the syn configuration when bound to CB[8]. In the absence of CB[8] the cyclization reaction does not occur, but only the isomerization of the trans isomer to the cis isomer is observed.\n\nThe dye-tuning capabilities cucurbiturils have been explored by researchers in recent years. In general, it has been found that the confined, low-polarity environment provided by the cucurbiturils leads to enhanced brightness, increased photostability, increased fluorescence lifetimes, and solvatochromism consistent with moving to an environment of lower polarity.\n\nInverted cucurbiturils or \"i\"CB[x] are CB analogues with one glycoluril repeating unit inverted. In this unit the methine protons actually point into the cavity and this makes the cavity less spacious. Inverted cucurbiturils form as a side-product in CB-forming reactions, with yields between 2 and 0.4%. Isolation of this type of CB compound is possible because it is more difficult to form inclusion compounds that ordinarily form with regular CB's. Inverted cucurbiturils are believed to be the kinetically controlled reaction products because the addition of deuterated hydrochloric acid or DCl to \"i\"CB[6] results in a mixture of CB[5], CB[6] and CB[7]in a 24:13:1 ratio.\n\nA cucurbituril cut in half along the equator is called a hemicucurbituril.\n\nCucurbit[6]uril's systematic name is Dodecahydro-1H, 4H, 14H, 17H-2, 16:3, 15-dimethano-5H, 6H, 7H, 8H, 9H, 10H, 11H, 12H, 13H, 18H, 19H, 20H, 21H, 22H, 23H, 24H, 25H, 26H-2, 3, 4a, 5a, 6a, 7a, 8a, 9a, 10a, 11a, 12a, 13a, 15, 16, 17a, 18a, 19a, 20a, 21a, 22a, 23a, 24a, 25a, 26a-tetracosaazabispentaleno[1’’’, 6’’’:5’’, 6’’, 7’’]cycloocty[1’’, 2’’, 3’’:3’,4’]pentaleno (1’, 6’:5, 6, 7) -cycloocta (1, 2, 3-gh:1’, 2’, 3’-g’h’) cycloocta (1, 2, 3-cd:5, 6, 7-c’d’) dipentalene-1, 4,6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25-dodecone.\n"}

{"id": "1846263", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1846263", "title": "Yé-yé", "text": "Yé-yé\n\nYé-yé () (yeyé in Spanish) was a style of pop music that emerged from Southern Europe in the early 1960s. The term \"yé-yé\" was derived from the English term \"yeah! yeah!\", popularized by British beat music bands such as the Beatles. The style expanded worldwide as the result of the success of figures such as French singer-songwriters Sylvie Vartan, Serge Gainsbourg and Françoise Hardy. Yé-yé was a particular form of counterculture that derived most of its inspiration from British and American rock and roll. Additional stylistic elements of yé-yé song composition include baroque, exotica, pop, jazz and the French \"chanson.\"\n\nThe yé-yé movement had its origins in the radio program \"Salut les copains\" (loosely translated as \"hello mates\" or \"hello pals\"), created by Jean Frydman and hosted by Daniel Filipacchi and Frank Ténot, which was first aired in December 1959. The phrase \"\"Salut les copains\"\" itself dates back to the title of a 1957 song by Gilbert Bécaud and Pierre Delanoë, who had little regard for the yé-yé music that the radio show typically featured. The program became an immediate success, and one of its sections, \"L\"e chouchou de la semaine\"\" (\"This Week's Sweetheart\"), became the starting point for most yé-yé singers. Any song that was presented as a \"chouchou\" went straight to the top places in the charts. The \"Salut les copains\" phenomenon continued with the magazine of the same name, which was first published in 1962 in France, with German, Spanish and Italian (\"Ciao Amici\") editions following shortly afterward.\n\nRadios were practicing a real hype, much more than today. We, the singers, were much, much less numerous than today – and there were fewer radios. It was also the heyday of \"Salut les copains\", and the press played an extremely important role, it could promote beginners. I remember being in the first page of \"Paris Match\" very quickly, without being very well known or doing anything special for that; this would no longer be possible nowadays. In fact, in the 1960s, we saw the advent of the mass media. At the same time, fashion had assumed a considerable importance, which it had never before had. Singers like me became emblems of fashion, in addition to \"chanson\", which helped to maintain notoriety.\n<br>\n—Françoise Hardy, \"Télérama\", 2012.\nYé-yé music was a mostly European phenomenon and usually featured young female singers. France Gall, for example, was only sixteen years of age when she released her first album and seventeen when she won the Eurovision Song Contest (for Luxembourg) singing\nthe prototype bubblegum song \"Poupée de cire, poupée de son\". Another later hit by Gall included \"Laisse tomber les filles\", a cover version of which by April March called \"Chick Habit\" appeared in Quentin Tarantino's 2007 film \"Death Proof\".\n\nYé-yé songs had innocent themes such as that of Françoise Hardy's \"Tous les garçons et les filles\" (\"All the guys and girls my age know how it feels to be happy, but I am lonely. When will I know how it feels to have someone?\").\n\nFrance had a large market for the consumption of French-language songs at the time. Unlike other European nations such as West Germany, the French were more willing to support artists from their own country, singing in their native tongue. Early French artists dabbling in rock and roll and similar genres, such as Johnny Hallyday, admit that they were creating an imitation of English-language rock music. Yé-yé helped assimilate that music in a unique, French way, and with the popularity of \"Salut les copains\", the public began to see stars such as France Gall emerge.\n\nThe singers were sexy in a deliberately contrived naïve manner. Composer and singer/songwriter Serge Gainsbourg once called Gall the French Lolita and, wanting to exploit her innocence, composed for her the double-entendre song \"Les sucettes\" (\"Lollipops\"): \"Annie loves lollipops, aniseed lollipops, when the sweet liquid runs down Annie's throat, she is in paradise.\" The lyrics of the song are blatantly phallic, and the music video essentially features a group of dancing penises.\n\nAmong the yé-yé girls, Sylvie Vartan had perhaps the most glamorous image. She married rock star Johnny Hallyday in 1965 and toured in America and Asia, but she remained a yé-yé at heart, and as late as 1968 she recorded the song \"Jolie poupée\" (\"Pretty Doll\"), about a girl who regrets having abandoned her doll after growing up.\n\nSheila portrayed the image of a well-behaved young girl. Her first hit was \"L'école est finie\" (\"School is over\") in 1962.\n\nIn 1967, teen yé-yé singer Jacqueline Taïeb won the Best Newcomer award in Cannes at the Midem awards for her hit single \"7 heures du matin\".\n\nOther significant girl singers of the era include teen TV star Christine Delaroche, Jocelyne, Zouzou, Evy, Cosette and Annie Philippe. Some girl groups emerged, such as Les Parisiennes, influenced by acts like the Shangri-Las.\n\nAlthough originating in France, the yé-yé movement extended over Western Europe. Italian singer Mina became her country's first female rock-and-roll singer in 1959. In the following few years, she move to middle-of-the-road girl pop. After her scandalous relationship and pregnancy with a married actor in 1963, Mina developed her image into that of a grown-up \"bad girl\". An example of her style may be found in the lyrics of the song \"Ta-ra-ta-ta\": \"The way you smoke, you are irresistible to me, you look like a real man.\" By contrast, her compatriot Rita Pavone cast the image of a typical teenage yé-yé girl; for example, the lyrics of her 1964 hit \"Cuore\" complained how love made the protagonist suffer.\n\nIn Italy, the yé-yé wave ended around 1967, vanishing under the emergence of British blues rock, pop and psychedelia.\nParisian-born singer Catherine Spaak had a massive success in Italy with a style very close to that of Françoise Hardy.\nOther significant Italian yé-yé girls include Mari Marabini, Carmen Villani, Anna Identici and the girl groups Le Amiche, Le Snobs and Sonia e le Sorelle.\n\nIn Spain, yé-yé music was at first considered to be incompatible with Catholicism. However, this did not stop the yé-yé culture from spreading, although a bit later than in the rest of Europe; in 1968 Spanish yé-yé girl Massiel won the Eurovision song contest with \"La, la, la\", while the sweet, naïve-looking singer Karina enjoyed success as the Spanish yé-yé queen with her hits \"En un mundo nuevo\" and \"El baúl de los recuerdos\".\nIn the 1965 film \"Historias de la televisión\", Concha Velasco's character, who competes against a yé-yé girl, sings \"La chica ye-ye\" (\"The Yé-yé Girl\").\nThe song became a hit, and Velasco is often remembered as, of course, \"la chica yeyé\".\n\nYé-yé grew very popular in Japan and formed the origins of Shibuya-kei and Japanese idol music. Gall recorded a Japanese version of \"Poupée de cire, poupée de son\". The film \"Cherchez l'idole\", featuring Johnny Hallyday, has seen a Japanese DVD release. The yé-yé vocal group Les Surfs appear in the film performing their hit song \"Ca n'a pas d'importance\".\n\nAt the end of the 1970s, there was a brief but successful yé-yé recurrence in France, spreading across the charts of Western Europe with electro-pop-influenced acts such as Plastic Bertrand, Lio and Elli et Jacno and,\nin a harder rock vein, Ici Paris and Les Calamités (a subgenre dubbed \"Yé-yé punk\" by Les Wampas leader Didier Wampas). Lio had a string of hits during 1980, the most famous of which was \"Amoureux Solitaires\". This new brand of yé-yé, although short-lived, echoed the synthesizer-driven sound that had surfaced recently with new wave music. \n\nBecause female singers dominated the yé-yé scene, the movement is often seen as a feminist statement. Music had long been controlled by men, yet in the midst of the male-centric world of jazz in the 1950s, the number of female singers increased. The yé-yé movement contributed to a significant and more feminist portrayal of women within music. In lieu of a desperate and codependent voice, the fun and almost flirtatious point of view depicted in these songs entered the music scene and brought about a small surge of liberation for the leading women of the yé-yé genre. Gall's 1966 song \"Baby Pop,\" for example, adopts a playful attitude toward the traditional institution of marriage, singing \"On your wedding night, it'll be too late to regret it.\"\n\nWhile the yé-yé movement was led by female singers, it was not an exclusively female movement. The yé-yé masterminds (such as Serge Gainsbourg, who wrote several hits for France Gall, Petula Clark and Brigitte Bardot, but was considerably older and came from a jazz background) were distinct from the actual yé-yé singers. Michel Polnareff, for example, played the tormented, hopeless lover in songs such as \"Love Me Please Love Me\", while Jacques Dutronc claimed to have seduced Santa Claus's daughter in \"La Fille du Père Noël\". Among the more popular male yé-yé singers was Claude François, notable for songs such as \"Belles, Belles, Belles\", a French-language adaptation of the Everly Brothers' and Eddie Hodges' \"(Girls, Girls, Girls) Made to Love\". In Portugal, the first yé-yé bands appeared in Coimbra in 1956, most notably Os Babies, led by José Cid. Other Portuguese bands followed afterward, including Os Conchas, Os Ekos, Os Sheiks, Os Celtas, Conjunto Académico João Paulo, Os Demónios Negros and singers such as Daniel Bacelar. \n\nThe yé-yé movement maintains a particular prevalence in the music world because of its swinging, catchy rhythms and carefree, lyrics. Unlike the confining strictures of society, yé-yé promoted a refreshing and invigorating newness and inevitably promoted a sort of sexual rebellion that greatly characterized the 1960s. Dalida's 1960 song \"Itsi bitsi, petit bikini\", previously recorded as \"Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polkadot Bikini\" by Brian Hyland, perfectly illustrated yé-yé's newfound nonchalance and release from prudish subject matter. The song, \"...which denotes a nonchalant and undisciplined listening,\" is about a girl afraid to reveal her bikini to fellow beachgoers, and it represents the shocking aspect of the lax attitude toward an increased sexuality, especially for women, as bikinis were previously considered scandalous. Similarly, yé-yé contributed to the creation a youth culture within a postwar France that expressed a certain playfulness and carefree perspective on life. Sociologist and philosopher Edgar Morin commented on the rise and popularity of yé-yé music and culture, \"...seeing in yé-yé's frantic, syncopated rhythms simultaneously a commodified music...of adult consumption, and a festive, playful hedonism...\" As it was for any postwar youth culture, yé-yé acted as a creative outlet that aided in defining an era as well as an identity for Europe, specifically France. The archetype of \"la parisienne\", exuding an exotic charm and magnetic appeal, was greatly defined by the influence of the numerous yé-yé girls within the scene and created an indelible mark in the worlds of both fashion and style. The \"...escapist, ironic...\" facets of yé-yé enticed thousands of listeners, promoting a gaiety and glamour that intertwined with the sexual freedom and modernity of the Swinging Sixties. \n\n\n\n"}

After his sports career, he served three terms as a Republican U.S. congressman from North Carolina from 1969 to 1975. He represented North Carolina's 5th congressional district, including Winston-Salem. Prior to that, he had performed as a left-handed pitcher in major league baseball. \n\nMizell was born near Vinegar Bend, Alabama, and was later nicknamed for his birthplace. He was reared in nearby Leakesville, Mississippi, where he graduated from high school in 1949.\n\nMizell was a professional pitcher between 1949 and 1963. He took two years out to serve in the United States Army during 1953 and 1954. \"Vinegar Bend\" began his Major League Baseball career with the St. Louis Cardinals in 1952, continuing through 1953, and then again (following military service) from 1956-60. Mizell was twice named an All-Star as a Cardinal, as he was named to both National League teams in 1959 (in those days, two All-Star games were played in a season). Mizell did not appear in either game. \n\nIn 1960 Mizell joined the Pittsburgh Pirates, playing with them through 1962. He won one championship with them. He also played with the expansion New York Mets in 1962 before retiring.\n\nHis trade to the Pittsburgh Pirates on May 28, 1960 is considered one of the catalysts towards the Pirates championship run that season. Mizell went 13-5 for the Pirates that season, and finished sixth in the National League in winning percentage. Julian Javier, one of the players traded for Mizell, became a mainstay of the St. Louis Cardinals championship teams of the 1960s. \n\nIn a nine-season career, Mizell was 90-88 with a 3.85 ERA in 268 games, 230 of which were starts. He pitched 61 complete games, including 15 shutouts. He allowed 654 earned runs and struck out 918 in 1528 and 2/3 innings pitched. Mizell appeared in two World Series games in 1960 (Game 3 as a starter, Game 6 in relief), going 0-1 with a 15.43 ERA, with 2.1 innings pitched. \n\nAfter leaving baseball, Mizell worked in sales and public relations for the Pepsi-Cola company in Winston-Salem until 1967.\n\nMizell entered North Carolina politics in the 1960s. He was elected to the Davidson County board of commissioners in 1966. He was the chairman of the board for the two years when he was a member.\n\nIn 1968, Mizell, a Republican, was elected to represent the 5th District in the 91st United States Congress. A previous Republican candidate, G. Fred Steele, Jr., had polled 46.9 percent of the vote in District 5 in 1966; Steele's showing helped prepare the district for a party transformation in 1968. Mizell defeated Democratic nominee Smith Bagley, an R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company official, 84,905 (52.4 percent) to 77,112 (47.6 percent). The previous 5th District representative, Democrat Nick Galifianakis, was moved to the 4th District for the 1968 elections. Mizell was the first Republican to be elected in decades from the 5th District, which was based in Winston-Salem and included much of the northwestern part of the state. He was one of the most popular congressmen in Washington and one of the most conservative.\nIn 1970, Mizell defeated Democrat James G. White, 68,937 (58.1 percent) to 49,663 (41.9 percent). In 1972, he trounced former liberal Arkansas Congressman Brooks Hays, who had moved to North Carolina, 101,375 (64.8 percent) to 54,986 (35.2 percent).\n\nMizell may have thought that his 1972 margin would insulate him from further Democratic challenges in 1974. The Watergate scandal affected Republican House members. Mizell was unseated by Democrat Stephen L. Neal, 64,634 (52 percent) to 59,182 (47.6 percent). In his 1974 defeat, Mizell polled less than three fifths of the total votes that he had received in 1972.\n\nPresident Gerald R. Ford, Jr., a former House colleague, appointed Mizell as Assistant Secretary of Commerce for the Economic Development Administration, a post he held from March 1975 to May 1976.\n\nIn 1976, Mizell challenged Neal again and lost, 83,129 (45.6 percent) to 98,789 (54.2 percent). Neal, a strong supporter of the Democratic presidential nominee Jimmy Carter, polled almost the same raw vote as Mizell had four years earlier, when he was running on the Nixon–Agnew slate.\n\nIn 1981, Mizell was appointed Assistant Secretary of Agriculture for Governmental and Public Affairs in the Reagan administration. Later he was appointed as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Intergovernmental Affairs, Department of Veterans Affairs, in the George H. W. Bush administration. Mizell also worked as executive director of the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports.\n\nAfter leaving government life, Mizell resided in Midway, North Carolina. He considered running for his old seat again in the 1990s, but decided against it.\n\nIn the fall of 1998, Mizell had a heart attack while watching his son Dave coach High Point Andrews High School in a football game against North Davidson High School in Welcome. Just before kickoff, rescue crews were called, and the game was postponed for about a half hour. Mizell was taken to the cardiac care unit of Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center. He recovered for a few months.\n\nMizell died at the age of 68 in Kerrville, Texas, where he was visiting his wife's family. \nMizell was survived by his two sons, Danny and Dave, who both live in North Carolina, and by four grandchildren.\n"}

{"id": "1846270", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1846270", "title": "Pittsburgh Dispatch", "text": "Pittsburgh Dispatch\n\nThe Pittsburgh Dispatch was a leading newspaper in Pittsburgh, operating from 1846 to 1923. After being enlarged by publisher Daniel O'Neill it was reportedly one of the largest and most prosperous newspapers in the United States. From 1880 to 1887 native of nearby Cochran's Mills, Nellie Bly worked for the \"Dispatch\" writing investigative articles on female factory workers, and later reported from Mexico as a foreign correspondent. The paper was politically independent and was particularly known for its in-depth court reporting.\n\nEstablished by Col. J. Heron Foster, the \"Dispatch\" made its first appearance on 9 February 1846. It was the first penny paper published in western Pennsylvania, initially comprising only four pages. The paper was almost unique in the industry for being profitable almost from the very beginning despite being started during an economic recession. Foster was a strong opponent to slavery in the United States and, having determined that the local market thought similarly lent an abolitionist tone to the paper. He was also a strong supporter of woman suffrage. His daughter Rachel Foster Avery became a prominent worker in the National American Woman Suffrage Association. He hired a woman to work in the newsroom and invited the protesting men to leave if they did not wish to work alongside her. Initially Foster acted not only as business manager and financier of the paper, but wrote extensively in it as well, even producing the copy on a hand press.\n\nIn 1849 Foster brought in a partner, RC Fleeson and the firm changed names to Foster & Fleeson. At the outbreak of the American Civil War Foster joined the Army, but production of the paper continued. The paper had become successful due to its independent approach to the news and in-depth court reporting:\n\nIn 1857 the \"Dispatch\" was Pittsburgh's leading newspaper with a combined daily and weekly circulation of 14,000, compared with the number two \"Chronicle\"'s 5,584. Fleeson remained with the paper until his death in 1863.\n\nAlthough ostensibly independent with regard to party politics, the pre-Civil War \"Dispatch\" tended in editorial sentiment toward the anti-slavery Free Soil Party and later the Know Nothings, and eventually the Republicans. The paper's warmth toward Know-Nothingism in the mid-1850s reflected Foster's belief that the movement was a better reform vehicle than the competing parties, which he saw as corrupt and beholden to the rising foreign-born vote. Foster rationalized the movement's nativism and anti-Catholicism, arguing that \"the foreign Catholic vote is almost unanimously cast for slavery\" and that immigrants made up much of the \"rum party\" opposed to temperance reforms.\n\nFollowing the war, in 1865 two employees of the paper, Daniel O'Neill and Alexander W. Rook bought a half interest in the paper, eventually taking full control when Foster died in 1868. O'Neill had been city editor for several years and had his finger on the pulse of the city. Additionally, O'Neill forged an independent path on state and national issues, lending weight to the paper's editorial page. At this point the paper was still four sheets, but management bought new rotary presses and they significantly enlarged its coverage - eventually doubling its size making it one of the largest and most prosperous newspapers in the United States. While a risky move because of the expense, the cover price was increased from 6 to 15 cents per week and the public liked the results and circulation grew making the \"Dispatch\" the greatest circulation paper in Pittsburgh with a circulation of 14,000.\n\nThe two partners ran the paper until O'Neill's death in 1877. Following O'Neill's death, Eugene M O'Neill, Daniel's brother, took a more leading role in the paper along with Rook. E. M. O'Neill continued his brother's independent approach to political and civic issues which the public enjoyed. The same year as Daniel's death, 1877, the firm suffered the loss of the printing plant due to fire. O'Neill replaced the rotary press with a state-of-the-art \"perfecting press\" which could print both sides of the paper at the same time. They simultaneously reduced the size of the printed sheet and doubled the number of pages. The smaller size and greater bulk made the \"Dispatch\" stand out from the competition most of whom were using the older blanket press in a broad sheet format. Another advantage gained by introducing new technology came from the press' ability to print and fold the paper. Boys who once were used to fold in the printing plant were sent into the street to sell the paper, redoubling the publisher's marketing effort.\n\nO'Neill led the Pittsburgh papers on the news gathering side of the operation. At this time most newspapers relied on the Associated Press newswire for their national news. Consequently, all papers were printing the same stories word for word. O'Neill reinvested the savings realized from his advanced presses and engaged correspondents in Washington and the other news centers around the country. The result was a fresher perspective and different stories from competitive papers. This advantage showed particularly in the hotly contested presidential election of 1880 which saw James A. Garfield elected.\n\nWhen Alexander Rook died in 1880 Eugene M O'Neill took control of the paper and its editorial direction and eventually bought full ownership from Rook's estate. E.M. continued in charge of both the editorial and business departments for the next 12 years.\n\nThe paper began publishing a Sunday edition on 9 September 1883, targeting the leisure time of its audience on that day, and justifying its higher price by providing more in-depth articles and a wider selection than the daily paper. The strategy was an instant success.\nAn earlier attempt at a Sunday paper, in 1870, had failed in the same year.\n\nOwnership of the paper was reorganized in corporate form under the title \"The Dispatch Publishing Company\" in 1888 with E.M. O'Neill as President, Bakewell Phillips, Treasurer, and C.A. Rook, Secretary. Phillips was the son of Ormby Phillips who was part owner of the paper until his death in 1884. Phillips, a former mayor of the City of Allegheny had been the business manager of the firm. Eugene O'Neill continued to oversee the paper until his retirement in 1902. Alexander Rook's son, Charles A Rook, purchased control of the corporation and took over as President and editor-in-chief of the paper, Eugene O'Neill became Vice President, and Daniel O'Neill's son Florence became Treasurer.\n\nIn 1908 Charles Wakefield Cadman became the music editor and critic for the \"Dispatch\".\n\nThe entry of the United States into World War I in 1917 began a period of paper shortages, especially newsprint. According to The Bureau of Business Research at Northwestern University the price of newsprint doubled between 1916 and 1917. Making matters worse was an increasingly difficult task of sourcing paper at all for the next 5 years. Matters came to a head in 1920 when a number of newspapers nationwide simply couldn't source newsprint at all and had to publish extremely truncated editions. In 1940 the price of newsprint doubled again, reaching a level 4 times higher than the pre-war price. On 23 March the paper appeared with 86 news headlines on the front page and virtually no advertising except for customers under contract. The paper shortage was not caused by a decrease in nationwide production, which had been steadily rising, instead the strong post World War I economy and the attendant advertising boom caused an increase in demand which the paper mills could not meet. In 1921 the paper had a circulation of 56,857.\nThe combination of rapidly rising costs and higher spending on new press technology led to a trend toward industry consolidation in the 1910s and 1920s. Multi-city newspaper syndicates, such as Scripps-Howard bought up independent papers and either consolidated them or closed them to cut costs. The days of a large city having 5 or 10 local papers was drawing to a close.\n\nThe \"Pittsburgh Dispatch\" published its last issue on 14 February 1923, its property, plant, and goodwill having been sold to the other Pittsburgh papers: the \"Pittsburgh Post\", \"The Gazette Times\" and the \"Pittsburgh Press\". The circulation of the paper was merged with the other papers, and the Rook Building at 1331-1335 Fifth Avenue in Pittsburgh was sold. The paper's membership in the Associated Press was transferred to the \"Pittsburgh Sun\". The papers taking over the \"Dispatch\" also took over the assets of the \"Pittsburgh Leader\" at around the same time.\n\n"}

He is most remembered for turning Ptolemy against his sister and co-ruler Cleopatra, thus starting a civil war, and for having Pompey decapitated and presenting the severed head to Julius Caesar.\n\nWhen Ptolemy XII died in 51 BC, his will stated that Ptolemy XIII and Cleopatra VII were to become co-rulers of Egypt, with the Roman Republic as their guardians. Ptolemy XIII was underage and Pothinus was appointed as his regent. The general Achillas and the rhetorician Theodotus of Chios were also guardians of the Egyptian king. When Ptolemy and Cleopatra were elevated to the status of senior rulers, Pothinus was maintained as the former's regent. Most Egyptologists believed that Pothinus used his influence to turn Ptolemy against Cleopatra. In the spring of 48 BC, Ptolemy, under Pothinus' guidance, attempted to depose Cleopatra in order to become sole ruler while Pothinus planned to act as the power behind the throne. They gained control of Alexandria, then the capital of Egypt, and forced Cleopatra out of the city. She soon organized her own army and a civil war began in Egypt, while Arsinoe IV also began to claim the throne for herself.\n\nRome was also enveloped in civil war, and after his defeat in the Battle of Pharsalus Pompey sought asylum in Egypt. Initially, Pothinus pretended to have accepted his request, but on September 29, 48 BC, Pothinus had the general murdered, hoping to win favor with Julius Caesar, who had defeated Pompey. When Caesar arrived, he was presented with the head of Pompey, but he responded with grief and disgust and ordered that Pompey's body be located and given a proper Roman funeral. Pothinus had neglected to note that Caesar had been granting clemency to his enemies, including Cassius, Cicero, and Brutus. Cleopatra used Pothinus's mistake to gain favor with Caesar and eventually became his lover.\n\nCaesar then arranged for the execution of Pothinus and the marriage of Cleopatra to Ptolemy. In the very last chapter of \"Commentarii de Bello Civili\", however, it is described that Pothinus arranged for Achillas to attack Alexandria and upon sending a message not to hesitate but to fulfill the plan, the messengers were exposed, whereupon Caesar had Pothinus imprisoned and killed, probably with a knife. His death was shortly followed by the ten-month siege of Alexandria.\n\nUnfortunately, only Roman and Greek sources have mentioned Pothinus. He is thus criticized for his murder of Pompey and his insidious behavior with regard to Caesar, while both measures are generally believed to have served to keep Egypt out of Caesar's Civil War. As it happened, however, Caesar came to emerge as the sole credible contender for his position of power, with Pompey dead and a Roman protectorate installed in Egypt.\n\nPothinus's brief role and death have been depicted more fancifully in dramatic literature.\n\n\n"}

These include osteoporosis, high blood calcium due to cancer, bone breakdown due to cancer, and Paget’s disease of bone. It is given by injection into a vein.\nCommon side effects include fever, joint pain, high blood pressure, diarrhea, and feeling tired. Serious side effects may include kidney problems, low blood calcium, and osteonecrosis of the jaw. Use during pregnancy may result in harm to the baby. It is in the bisphosphonate family of medications. It works by blocking the activity of osteoclast cells and thus decreases the breakdown of bone.\nZoledronic acid was patented in 1986 and approved for medical use in the United States in 2001. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. The wholesale cost in the developing world is between 5.73 USD and 26.80 USD per vial. In the United Kingdom, as of 2015, a dose costs the NHS about 220 pounds.\n\nZoledronic acid is used to prevent skeletal fractures in patients with cancers such as multiple myeloma and prostate cancer, as well as for treating osteoporosis. It can also be used to treat hypercalcemia of malignancy and can be helpful for treating pain from bone metastases.\n\nIt can be given at home rather than in hospital. Such use has shown safety and quality-of-life benefits in people with breast cancer and bone metastases.\n\nZoledronic acid may be given as a 5 mg infusion once per year for treatment of osteoporosis in men and post-menopausal women at increased risk of fracture.\n\nIn 2007, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also approved it for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis.\n\nZoledronate may be used for treatment of osteogenesis imperfecta.\n\nA single 5 mg dose of zoledronic acid is used for the treatment of Paget's disease.\n\n\nSide effects can include fatigue, anemia, muscle aches, fever, and/or swelling in the feet or legs. Flu-like symptoms are common after the first infusion, although not subsequent infusions, and are thought to occur because of its potential to activate human γδ T cells (gamma/delta T cells).\n\nThere is a risk of severe renal impairment. Appropriate hydration is important prior to administration, as is adequate calcium and vitamin D intake prior to Aclasta therapy in patients with preexisting hypocalcaemia, and for ten days following Aclasta in patients with Paget's disease of the bone. Monitoring for other mineral metabolism disorders and the avoidance of invasive dental procedures for those who develop osteonecrosis of the jaw is recommended.\n\nZoledronate is rapidly processed via the kidneys; consequently its administration is not recommended for patients with reduced renal function or kidney disease. Some cases of acute kidney injury either requiring dialysis or having a fatal outcome following Reclast use have been reported to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This assessment was confirmed by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), whose Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) specified new contraindications for the medication on 15 December 2011, which include hypocalcaemia and severe renal impairment with a creatinine clearance of less than 35 ml/min.\n\nA rare complication that has been recently observed in cancer patients being treated with bisphosphonates is osteonecrosis of the jaw. This has mainly been seen in patients with multiple myeloma treated with zoledronate who have had dental extractions.\n\nAtypical fractures : After approving the drug on 8 July 2009, the European Medicines Agency conducted a class review of all bisphosphonates, including Zoledronate, after several cases of atypical fractures were reported. In 2008, the EMA's Pharmacovigilance Working Party (PhVWP) noted that alendronic acid was associated with an increased risk of atypical fracture of the femur that developed with low or no trauma. In April 2010, the PhVWP noted that further data from both the published literature and post-marketing reports were now available which suggested that atypical stress fractures of the femur may be a class effect. The European Medicines Agency then reviewed all case reports of stress fractures in patients treated with bisphosphonates, relevant data from the published literature, and data provided by the companies which market bisphosphonates. The Agency recommended that doctors who prescribe bisphosphonate-containing medicines should be aware that atypical fractures may occur rarely in the femur, especially after long-term use, and that doctors who are prescribing these medicines for the prevention or treatment of osteoporosis should regularly review the need for continued treatment, especially after five or more years of use.\n\nZoledronic acid slows down bone resorption, allowing the bone-forming cells time to rebuild normal bone and allowing bone remodeling.\n\nZoledronic acid has been found to have a direct antitumor effect and to synergistically augment the effects of other antitumor agents in osteosarcoma cells.\n\nZoledronate has shown significant benefits versus placebo over three years, with a reduced number of vertebral fractures and improved markers of bone density. An annual dose of zoledronic acid may also prevent recurring fractures in patients with a previous hip fracture.\n\nZoledronate also attenuates accumulation of DNA damage in mesenchymal stem cells and protects their function. Given this characteristic, its potential to affect conditions arising from stem-cell dysfunction makes it a promising medicine for a range of age-related diseases\n\nAn increase in disease-free survival (DFS) was found in the ABCSG-12 trial, in which 1,803 premenopausal women with endocrine-responsive early breast cancer received anastrozole with zoledronic acid. A retrospective analysis of the AZURE trial data revealed a DFS survival advantage, particularly where estrogen had been reduced.\nIn a meta-analysis of trials where upfront zoledronic acid was given to prevent aromatase inhibitor-associated bone loss, active cancer recurrence appeared to be reduced.\n\nA 2010 review concluded that \"adding zoledronic acid 4 mg intravenously every 6 months to endocrine therapy in premenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer ... is cost-effective from a US health care system perspective\".\n"}

{"id": "1846298", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1846298", "title": "Supramolecular assembly", "text": "Supramolecular assembly\n\nA supramolecular assembly or \"supermolecule\" is a well defined complex of molecules held together by noncovalent bonds. While a supramolecular assembly can be simply composed of two molecules (e.g., a DNA double helix or an inclusion compound), it is more often used to denote larger complexes of molecules that form sphere-, rod-, or sheet-like species. Micelles, liposomes and biological membranes are examples of supramolecular assemblies. The dimensions of supramolecular assemblies can range from nanometers to micrometers. Thus they allow access to nanoscale objects using a bottom-up approach in far fewer steps than a single molecule of similar dimensions.\n\nThe process by which a supramolecular assembly forms is called molecular self-assembly. Some try to distinguish self-assembly as the process by which individual molecules form the defined aggregate. Self-organization, then, is the process by which those aggregates create higher-order structures. This can become useful when talking about liquid crystals and block copolymers.\n\nAs studied in coordination chemistry, metal ions (usually transition metal ions) exist in solution bound to ligands, In many cases, the coordination sphere defines geometries conducive to reactions either between ligands or involving ligands and other external reagents.\n\nA well known metal-ion-templating was described by Charles Pederson in his synthesis of various crown ethers using metal cations as template. For example, 18-crown-6 strongly coordinates potassium ion thus can be prepared through the Williamson ether synthesis using potassium ion as the template metal.\n\nMetal ions are frequently used for assembly of large supramolecular structures. Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are one example. MOFs are infinite structures where metal serve as nodes to connect organic ligands together. SCCs are discrete systems where selected metals and ligands undergo self-assembly to form finite supramolecular complexes, usually the size and structure of the complex formed can be determined by the angularity of chosen metal-ligand bonds.\n\nHydrogen bond-assisted supramolecular assembly is the process of assembling small organic molecules to form large supramolecular structures by non-covalent hydrogen bonding interactions. The directionality, reversibility, and strong bonding nature of hydrogen bond make it an attractive and useful approach in supramolecular assembly. Functional groups such as carboxylic acids, ureas, amines, and amides are commonly used to assemble higher order structures upon hydrogen bonding.\n\nHydrogen bond play an essential role in the assembly of secondary and tertiary structures of large biomolecules. DNA double helix is formed by hydrogen bonding between nucleobases: adenine and thymine forms two hydrogen bonds, while guanine and cytosine forms three hydrogen bonds (Figure \"Hydrogen bonds in (a) DNA duplex formation\"). Another prominent example of hydrogen bond-assisted assembly in nature is the formation of protein secondary structures. Both the α-helix and β-sheet are formed through hydrogen bonding between the amide hydrogen and the amide carbonyl oxygen (Figure \"Hydrogen bonds in (b) protein β-sheet structure\").\n\nIn supramolecular chemistry, hydrogen bonds have been broadly applied to crystal engineering, molecular recognition, and catalysis. Hydrogen bonds are among the mostly used synthons in bottom-up approach to engineering molecular interactions in crystals. Representative hydrogen bond patterns for supramolecular assembly is shown in Figure \"Representative hydrogen bond patterns in supramolecular assembly\". A 1: 1 mixture of cyanuric acid and melamine forms crystal with a highly dense hydrogen-bonding network. This supramolecular aggregates has been used as templates to engineering other crystal structures.\n\nSupramolecular assemblies have no specific applications but are the subject of many intriguing reactions. A supramolecular assembly of peptide amphiphiles in the form of nanofibers has been shown to promote the growth of neurons. An advantage to this supramolecular approach is that the nanofibers will degrade back into the individual peptide molecules that can be broken down by the body. By self-assembling of dendritic dipeptides, hollow cylinders can be produced. The cylindrical assemblies possess internal helical order and self-organize into columnar liquid crystalline lattices. When inserted into vesicular membranes, the porous cylindrical assemblies mediate transport of protons across the membrane. Self-assembly of dendrons generates arrays of nanowires. Electron donor-acceptor complexes comprise the core of the cylindrical supramolecular assemblies, which further self-organize into two-dimensional columnar liquid crystaline lattices. Each cylindrical supramolecular assembly functions as an individual wire. High charge carrier mobilities for holes and electrons were obtained.\n\n"}

{"id": "1846305", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1846305", "title": "White Earth Indian Reservation", "text": "White Earth Indian Reservation\n\nThe White Earth Indian Reservation (, \"Where there is an abundance of white clay\") is the home to the White Earth Band, located in northwestern Minnesota. It is the largest Indian reservation in that state by land area. The reservation includes all of Mahnomen County, plus parts of Becker and Clearwater counties in the northwest part of the state, along the Wild Rice and White Earth rivers. It is about 225 miles (362 km) from Minneapolis–Saint Paul and roughly 65 miles (105 km) from Fargo–Moorhead.\n\nCommunity members often prefer to identify as Anishinaabe or Ojibwe rather than Chippewa, a corruption of Ojibwe that came to be used by European settlers to refer to them. The reservation's land area is 1,093 sq mi (2,831 km²), and its population was 9,192 as of the 2000 U.S. census. The White Earth Indian Reservation is one of six bands that make up the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, their governing body for major administrative needs. The Band issues its own reservation license plates to vehicles.\n\nThe White Earth Reservation was created on March 19, 1867, during a treaty () signing in Washington, DC. Ten Ojibwe Indian chiefs met with President Andrew Johnson at the White House to negotiate the treaty. The chiefs (White Cloud), a Gull Lake Mississippi Chippewa, and Fine Day, of the Removable Mille Lacs Indians, were among the first to move with their followers to White Earth in 1868.\n\nThe reservation originally covered 1,300 square miles (3,400 km²). Much of the community's land was improperly sold or seized by outside interests, including the U.S. federal government, in the late 19th century and early 20th century. According to the Dawes Act of 1887, the communal land was to be allotted to individual households recorded in tribal rolls, for cultivation in subsistence farming. Under the act, the remainder was declared surplus and available for sale to non-Native Americans. The Nelson Act of 1889 was a corollary law that enabled the land to be divided and sold to non-Natives. In the latter half of the 20th century, the federal government arranged for the transfer of state and county land to the reservation in compensation for other property that had been lost.\n\nIn 1989, Winona LaDuke formed the White Earth Land Recovery Project, which has slowly been acquiring land privately held to add back to the value of the non-profit 501(c)(3) to be used for collateral. At that time, less than 10% of the land within the reservation boundaries was owned by tribal members.\n\nThe White Earth Band government operates the Shooting Star Casino, Hotel and Event center in Mahnomen, Minnesota. The entertainment and gambling complex employs over 1000 tribal and non-tribal staff, with a new location in Bagley, Minnesota.\n\nOriginally, the United States wanted to relocate all Anishinaabe people from Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota to the White Earth Reservation in the western part of Minnesota. It planned to open the land of the vacated reservations to sale and settlement by European Americans. The US government even proposed relocating the Dakota people to the White Earth Reservation, although the two peoples had been traditional enemies since the Anishinaabe had invaded their land in the late 18th century. The US continued to promote this policy until 1898.\n\nBefore the Nelson Act of 1889 took effect, groups of Anishinaabe and Dakota peoples began to relocate to the White Earth Reservation from other Minnesota Chippewa and Dakota reservations. The 1920 census details provide data on the origins of the Anishinabe people living on the White Earth Reservation, as they indicated their original bands. There were 4,856 from the Mississippi Band of Chippewa (well over 1,000 had come from Mille Lacs, and many were Dakota); the Pillagers numbered 1,218; the Pembina Band were 472; and 113 were from the Fond du Lac and Superior Chippewa bands.\n\nOn July 8, 1889, the United States broke treaty promises; it told the Minnesota Chippewa that Red Lake Reservation and White Earth Reservation would remain, but that the others would be eradicated. It also told them the Chippewa from the other Reservations would be relocated to White Earth Reservation. Instead of dealing with the Chippewa of Minnesota on a nation-to-nation level, the United States put decisions about communal land use to a vote of tribal members. It said that the decision to accept land allotments under the Dawes Act would be settled by a vote of individual adult Chippewa males, rather than allowing the tribe to make a decision according to their own traditions of council. Included in the decision to allow allotment was that lands classified as surplus, after all households received allotments, would be declared 'surplus' and could be sold to non-Chippewa, namely, the European Americans. Chippewa leaders were outraged. They knew they could count on the average Anishinaabe adult male to obey the council's decision. But, included in the voting were many Dakota men, who were not part of their tribe.\n\nThe Chippewa also mistrusted administration of the vote; the whites, who had an interest in allotment, counted the total number of votes, rather than the Chippewa. Red Lake leaders warned the United States about reprisals if their Reservation was violated. The White Earth and Mille Lacs reservations overwhelmingly voted to accept land allotments and allow surplus land sold to the whites. Supposedly the Leech Lake Reservation's men also overwhelmingly voted to accept land allotments and have the Reservation surplus land sold to the whites. The events of October 1898 indicate otherwise.\n\nAt the time (1889), the White Earth Reservation covered 1,093 sq. mi. After the votes were counted, the whites claimed that voting men had overwhelmingly voted to accept land allotments and have the Reservations surplus land sold to the whites. After this process, only a small portion of the White Earth Reservation remained. It was located in the northeast part of the White Earth Reservation and was only a fraction of the original size. All other Minnesota Chippewa reservations were closed and emptied of Native Americans. The rebellion which occurred on the Leech Lake Reservation in 1898 saved Minnesota's Chippewa reservations, including the White Earth Reservation and probably the Red Lake Reservation, and the Chippewa reservations of Wisconsin.\n\nWhite Earth, like the Red Lake and Leech Lake reservations, is known for its tradition of singing hymns in the Ojibwe language.\n\nWhite Earth Reservation has many settlements located within its borders. Some are predominantly non-Indian, or include a large percentage of mixed-bloods. Today, how individuals live in terms of their culture often determines whether they are considered Ojibwe. According to tradition, the Ojibwe had a patrilineal society in which inheritance and descent was passed down paternal lines. Children were considered born into their father's clan and took their social status from his people.\n\nAt one time, children who had white fathers were not considered Ojibwe; such children had no formal place in the tribe unless they were adopted by a male of the tribe, as their biological father did not belong to a tribal clan. Over time, many unions were made among Ojibwe and Europeans, typically of European males and Ojibwe women. Their mixed-race descendants have taken a variety of roles: some bridging the cultures; others identifying with one or the other. The questions of ancestry and style of life continue to be contentious.\n\nPredominantly, Indian settlements include Elbow Lake; Naytahwaush, the largest Indian community on the Reservation; Pine Point; Rice Lake; Twin Lakes; and White Earth, which is the second-largest Indian settlement on the Reservation. The following communities are considered to have predominantly Indian populations when their mixed-blood residents are included, whether or not those are enrolled tribal members: Waubun, Ogema, and Callaway. The largest community is Mahnomen, which is predominantly non-Indian in population.\n\nTiny settlements that are likely predominantly Native American include Mahkonce, which is very rural; Maple Grove Township; Pine Bend; Roy Lake, a popular tourist and vacation destination; and the region around Strawberry Lake, which is also popular with vacationers. In July 2007, according to the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, the total number of enrolled members of the White Earth Reservation is 19,291. Most members live off-Reservation, particularly those of Dakota ancestry. Some live in Minneapolis or other cities that offer more economic prospects.\n\nThe population of the White Earth Reservation is predominantly white, as the Nelson Acts permitted sales of land to non-Natives. The 2000 census reported a population of 9,192 for the White Earth Reservation. The Native American population was reported as 3,378, much less than that at the Leech Lake Reservation. When including mixed heritage Ojibwe people and Hispanics, the Native American population is 4,154. The white population was reported as 5,205.\n\nThe chairwoman of the White Earth Reservation says that the Indian populations of reservations are higher than counted during censuses. She said that many Reservation families had more than one family sharing the same residence, and these were not always counted. In some cases up to three families shared the same residence. During census counts, the extra families will likely not participate for fear of being evicted from their homes. It may be that the population of the White Earth Band is larger than that of whites on the reservation.\n\nWhite Earth Reservation has an economy which is similar to other Native American reservations. In 2011, the government of the White Earth Reservation employed nearly 1,750 employees. The tribal payroll was near $21 million. The government of the White Earth Reservation employs non-Indians as well as Chippewa from off the reservation in order to fill its staffing needs.\n\nThe White Earth Reservation owns and operates an Event Center, a hotel, the Shooting Star Casino, the White Earth Housing Authority, the Reservations College, and other business enterprises.\n\nThe poverty rate on the White Earth Reservation may be near 50%. The unemployment rate on the White Earth Reservation is near 25%. The White Earth Reservation is classified as the poorest reservation in the State of Minnesota.\n\nWhite Earth Reservation is situated in an area where the prairie meets the boreal forest. About half the Reservation is covered by a forest and lakes, with second-growth trees. In the late 19th century, lumber companies clear–cut much of the original forest that had covered the Reservation.\n\nThe western part of the Reservation is prime prairie land. Many farms are located in this section. Another area of numerous farms is the extreme northeastern section of the Reservation.\n\nThe most dense forest is situated between Callaway and Pine Point, on up to just west and north of Mahkonce. North of there, the forest becomes less dense, especially around the Pine Bend and Rice Lake regions. The region between Mahkonce and Pine Bend has a few farms.\n\nMany lakes dot the Reservation's land. Large lakes include Bass Lake; Big Rat Lake; Lower Rice Lake; Many Point Lake; North Twin Lake-South Twin Lake; Roy Lake; Round Lake; Snider Lake; Strawberry Lake; Tulaby Lake; and White Earth Lake. The White Earth Land Recovery Project encourages ownership of reservation land by members of the White Earth Band, as well as projects for reforestation and revival of the wild rice industry on the reservation's lakes. It sells a reservation brand of wild rice and other products.\n\nThe White Earth Reservation holds the 160,000-acre White Earth State Forest. The Reservation's land is still recovering from the effects of the destruction which the lumber companies caused over a century ago. The Reservation is especially beautiful during the spring, summer and autumn.\n\nClimate conditions on the White Earth Reservation are extreme. Winters are long and cold. During the months of December, January, and February, average low temperatures are 1, -6, and 0 at Mahnomen. Average high temperatures for the same winter months are 20, 14, and 21. The summer months of June, July, and August have high temperatures that average 76, 81, and 80 at Mahnomen. Average low temperatures during the same summer months are 52, 56, and 54 at Mahnomen. Precipitation is influenced by the forest and many lakes which are located within the Reservation's borders. Average yearly precipitation at Mahnomen is over 22 inches.\n\n\n\n"}

It would spend the remaining 42 year of its existence in receivership or trusteeship, one of the longest bankruptcy proceedings in American railroading history. \n\nThe Pittsburg, Shawmut & Northern Railroad is often confused with the similarly named Pittsburg and Shawmut Railroad which was a spinoff company from the PS&N. Further adding to the confusion is the fact that both were nicknamed the \"Shawmut Line\", both operated in roughly the same geographic area, and both used nearly identical logos during their history. In fact the two were completely separate companies after their 1916 split.\n\nThe main line consisted of approximately 190 miles (306 km) of track extending from Brockway, Pennsylvania to Wayland, New York with several branches, particularly Olean, New York to Prosser, New York (a location on the southeastern edge of South Valley, New York) and Moraine, New York (a location on the eastern edge of Canaseraga, New York) to Hornell, New York. Principal shops were divided between Angelica, New York (car shop, paint shop, maintenance of way) and St. Marys, Pennsylvania (motive power shop). Each shop burned and was rebuilt.\n\nThe Pittsburg, Shawmut & Northern Railroad began life on August 2, 1899, as the merger of five small railroads in New York and Pennsylvania. of what ultimately became the PS&N were originally narrow gauge lines, though by the time of the PS&N's incorporation only remained as narrow gauge. At the time of its incorporation the PS&N operated four physically disconnected divisions. The expense of connecting the divisions and upgrading the physical plant to handle through coal trains coupled with the failure of the PS&N's principal bond underwriter forced the company to declare bankruptcy in 1905. The company would continue to operate in receivership until 1946 when the bankruptcy was converted to a trusteeship.\n\nThe spelling of \"Pittsburgh\" as \"Pittsburg\" in the company name derives from the company’s original 1899 charter. At the time, the name of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania was commonly spelled without the \"h\". The United States Board on Geographic Names advocated the \"h\"-less spelling from 1891 to 1911 as part of an effort to standardize the spelling of place names in the United States.\n\nThe more lucrative Brockway to Freeport route was constructed beginning in 1903 as the Brookville & Mahoning. Confusion with the Boston & Maine caused the name to be changed to the Pittsburg & Shawmut Railroad. The P&S was leased (but never owned) by the PS&N from 1906 until 1916. After 1916, the lease was terminated and the two companies operated separately. During the time of the lease, the bigger \"200 class\" 2-8-2s of the P&S operated over the combined systems.\n\nCoal (bituminous) was the principal commodity for the line during its entire existence, though passenger trains and, after the late 1920s, self-propelled gas-powered motor cars (known on the PS&N as \"Hoodlebugs\") also ran on the route until they were discontinued in 1935. In the early 1930s, the final years of service, the railroad's passenger service on its full mainline route was segmented. Train 9 southbound (10 northbound) traveled as a passenger train from Wayland, New York to Prosser, New York. At Prosser, passengers traveling the full route south would switch to a motor car in Train 11 southbound (12 northbound) which began its trip on a side branch from Olean. This motor car train would continue south to St. Marys, whereupon southbound travelers would transfer to Train 1, another motor car train, for the final trip to Brockway. This trip would involve an overnight layover in St. Marys between a 6:45 pm arrival and #1's 8:00 am departure. Travelers heading northbound would need to make an overnight stop at Prosser, as #12 from Brockway arrived in Prosser at 1:30 pm and #10 bound for Wayland would depart Prosser at 6:39 am.\n\nPS&N operations ended effective April 1, 1947. Portions of the line serving Olean, Brandy Camp, and Farmers Valley were acquired by the Pennsylvania Railroad (the Farmers Valley portion is today owned by the Norfolk Southern Railway and operated by the Western New York and Pennsylvania Railroad). The Erie Railroad acquired the PS&N's Hornell Terminals in a complex transaction from the American National Red Cross, which had been gifted ownership of the Rochester, Hornellsville & Lackawanna Railroad, an 11-mile-long railroad leased to and operated by the PS&N and predecessors prior to 1946.\nThe tracks for most of the routes have been removed. The only remaining segments are West Creek Westlands Learning Center to St. Marys and Brockway Golf Course to Brockway.\n\n"}

In winter it is used for ice skating and hockey and serves as the location of a New Year's Eve celebration featuring roasted marshmallows and hot chocolate. The lake has an area of , of shoreline with a little under three miles of paved walking and biking paths, and a maximum depth of .\n\nLake of the Isles is known for its two wooded islands, its long north arm, and the surrounding stately houses of the Kenwood, Lowry Hill, and East Isles neighborhoods. The lake was named for small islands that used to exist in the lake, wetlands area, and was used from the earliest days of settlement of Minneapolis. At one time the lake contained four small islands, but two of them, near the south shore of the lake, were converted to parkland as the lake was developed and dredged to its current shape and size. The two remaining wooded islands, Mike's Island in the north and Raspberry Island, are protected wildlife refuges which contain virgin woods. Landing on either of the islands is prohibited, as marked by signs.\n\nThe lake was created in its current form in the early 20th century by dredging a small lake, called \"Wita Tomna\" (\"four islands lake\") by the local Dakota people, and an adjacent marsh. The dredged materials—mostly peat and silt—were used to create about of parkland around the lake and the two islands in the middle of the lake. The settling of these materials and the pressure of urban development led to an unstable shoreline and reduced water quality. The Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board is engaged in a multiyear project to stabilize the shoreline, renovate the parkland, and construct twelve stone points of access to the lake.\n\nThe lake contains black bullhead, black crappie, bluegill, bowfin, common carp, hybrid sunfish, largemouth bass, northern pike, pumpkinseed, tiger muskellunge, walleye, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch. Some guideline restrictions have been placed on the consumption of bluegill, carp, crappie, largemouth bass, northern pike, walleye, white sucker, and yellow perch from the lake, because of contamination with mercury and PFOS.\n\nPrince mentions Lake of the Isles in the song \"Rock n Roll is Alive (And it Lives in Minneapolis)\" with the lyric, \"Sure as the drive around Lake of the Isles is cool I know, Rock 'n' roll will never die, like the Minnehaha flow.\" A number of shots in the opening to the Mary Tyler Moore Show were shot around Lake of the Isles.\n\n\n"}

It is also the first elevated station in Singapore with two side platforms on either side of the tracks, as opposed to having an island platform commonly found in other elevated MRT stations. A similar layout was adopted at Canberra MRT station.\n\nAs the second above-ground MRT station built in the late 1990s and the early 2000s, it has a distinctive architectural design. Like most projects of this period, the use of glass and steel is extensive.\n\nDover station provides MRT access to students and staff of Singapore Polytechnic, as well as residents of the nearby Mount Sinai and Dover estates.\n\nDover MRT Station was announced on 28 July 1997. Adjacent to the Singapore Polytechnic on one side, and undeveloped land on the other, the building of the station was met with reservations by some members of the public over the small area it serviced when construction began in June 1998. There were criticisms over the spending of \"taxpayers' money\" chiefly for use only by students of one educational institution. The Land Transport Authority, the government department in charge of public transport operations, proceeded with the construction anyway, to serve commuters along Singapore Polytechnic with Dover housing estate. Originally, it was named Singapore Polytechnic MRT Station in the planning stage. With the change of plans, it was renamed to Dover, after the nearby Dover Road.\n\nOriginally, the station was not assigned a station code. On 18 July 2001, with the introduction of the new MRT map, including new station codes, Dover was assigned with EW22.\nTrains were running slower due to the construction. There were test runs from 13 to 17 October 2001 when the trains stopped at this station but did not open their doors.\n\nShuttle buses were provided from this station to National University Hospital (NUH), previously from Buona Vista. However, services ceased with effect from 1 November 2011 due to the opening of Kent Ridge MRT station on the Circle Line, which is located within NUH premises.\nHalf height platform screen doors (HHPSD) were installed in this station and they became operational on 5 August 2011.\n\nOn 19 September 2009, a retiree Muhammad Osmail Paiman, 61, was pulled out to safety after he fell onto the MRT tracks at the station. A similar incident happened the next day when a retiree Carolyn Quek was saved by a man. The retiree felt giddy and fell into the tracks.\n\n"}

He played the part from 1966 to 1967 alongside both William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton.\n\nCraze was born in Newquay, Cornwall. He got into acting by chance as, at the age of twelve, he discovered through Boy Scout Gang Shows that he had a perfect boy soprano voice. This led him to win parts in \"The King and I\" and \"Plain and Fancy\", both at Drury Lane, and \"Damn Yankees\" at the Coliseum. Once he had left school, he went into repertory and got into TV through his agent. His first television was a show called \"Family Solicitor\" for Granada, which was followed, amongst others, by a part in ABC TV's 1960 series \"Target Luna\" (written by Malcolm Hulke and Eric Paice and produced by Sydney Newman).\n\nBefore \"Doctor Who\", Craze founded a film company, Mantic, and produced an award-winning short film entitled \"Fragment\" directed by Norman J Warren. It was exhibited at the Commonwealth Film Festival. He worked on several ITV productions, including one episode (The Last Visitor) of Hammer Films' first TV series \"Journey to the Unknown\" in 1968. Other television roles include parts in \"Gideon's Way\", \"Dixon of Dock Green\" and \"Z-Cars\".\n\nIn the 1970s Craze appeared in two cult Norman J. Warren horror films: \"Satan's Slave\" (1976) and \"Terror\" (1978). He also appeared in the horror/fantasy/romance film \"Neither the Sea Nor the Sand\" (1972).\n\nIn the 1980s, Craze acted only occasionally and also managed a pub. According to his brother, the actor Peter Craze, who also appeared in \"Doctor Who\", much of Craze's later life was occupied by attending \"Doctor Who\" fan conventions.\n\nCraze was married to Edwina Craze (née Verner), a television producer and previously a floor manager, whom Craze met while working on \"Doctor Who\". He had a son, Ben, with his second wife. Craze enjoyed fishing in his spare time.\n\nCraze died of a heart attack on 8 December 1998. He had fallen down some steps the previous day while picking up his neighbour's paper for her, and owing to a heart condition, was unable to be operated on. Craze's funeral was attended by hundreds of \"Doctor Who\" fans, who had become devoted to him through his regular appearances at \"Doctor Who\" conventions, as well as series stars such as Anneke Wills, Deborah Watling and Wendy Padbury. The Doctor Who theme music accompanied his coffin at the funeral. Craze was cremated and his ashes were scattered on the river Thames.\n"}

The hotel has two different buildings. The Sassoon House, originally housed the Cathay Hotel and is today the Fairmont Peace Hotel run by Fairmont Hotels and Resorts of Canada. The South Building was built as the Palace Hotel and is today a residence and studio for artists, known as The Swatch Art Peace Hotel. The two buildings both face the Bund, but are divided by Nanjing Road.\n\nThe larger North Building is called Sassoon House. The building was built by Sir Victor Sassoon, of the Sassoon family, which built a Shanghai business and real estate empire in the early 20th century. He was a British Sephardic Jew of Iraqi origin, educated at Harrow School and Cambridge University. His family owned the trading company \"E.D. Sassoon & Co.\", which managed extensive business interests in Bombay, Hong Kong, and Shanghai.\nSassoon House was the first high-rise building built by Victor Sassoon, and one of the first skyscrapers in the Eastern Hemisphere. It was designed by architects Palmer and Turner, with a reinforced concrete structure. Construction began in 1926, and was completed in 1929.\nThe building occupies 4,617 square meters (49,697 square feet), and offers 36,317 square meters (390,913 square feet) of floor space. The building is ten stories in height, and the tenth floor is a penthouse, where Victor Sassoon once lived. The North Building is 77 meters (253 feet) high to the roofline, and 83 meters (272 feet) to the spire.\n\nThe builders followed a consistent art deco scheme, from exterior design to interior decor. Most of the building features granite facing, while the ninth floor and the roof are surfaced with terracotta. The eastern facade (facing the Huangpu River and the Bund) features a pyramidal roof with steep sides, and a height of about 10 meters (33 feet). The pyramid is faced with copper, which has corroded to light green.\n\nBanks and shops leased the ground floor space until 1949. This space became the Shanghai branch of Citibank in 2002. The fourth through ninth floors once housed the Cathay Hotel.\n\nAfter the Communist takeover in 1949, some of the offices were used by the Municipal Finance Committee. In 1952, the building was taken over by the Municipal Government. In 1956, it once again became a hotel under the name \"Peace Hotel\". During the Cultural Revolution, the hotel was used by the Gang of Four, most famously by Zhang Chunqiao as he headed the Shanghai Commune from headquarters in the Peace Hotel.\n\nIts Old Jazz Band was recently the basis for a movie, \"As Time Goes By\" a film by . Its roof terrace restaurant overlooks the district of Pudong across the Huangpu. This hotel was also used as an inspiration for Vicki Baum's 1937 novel \"Shanghai '37\", also known as \"Hotel Shanghai\" and \"Nanjing Road\".\n\nIn 2007, the hotel closed for a three-year renovation of both the exterior and interior, including the guest rooms, the lobby, and the dining and entertainment venues. The North Building reopened in 2010, as the Fairmont Peace Hotel Shanghai. The hotel now offers 270 guestrooms and 39 suites, including Victor's Café, named for Sir Victor Sassoon. The eighth floor hosts the Peace Hall, plus several meeting rooms, and an outdoor terrace.\n\nA low-rise extension has been added to the rear of the hotel, housing guestrooms, a swimming pool, and spa.\n\nSeparated from the North Building by Nanjing Road, the South Building dates back to the 1850s, when it was known as the Central Hotel. In 1903, the hotel was restructured and renamed the Palace Hotel. The building that stands today was completed in 1908, and offered two elevators, the first building in Shanghai to do so. It was also once home to a Kuhn & Komor shop.\n\nThe hotel occupies , with a floor space of . It has a brick veneer, with its six stories reaching in height. The exterior is in a Renaissance style. The hotel has eighteen artist residences and seven guest rooms.\n\nIn 1911, after the success of the Xinhai Revolution, Sun Yat-sen stayed at the hotel and advocated commitment to the revolutionary cause. During World War II, the building was occupied by the Japanese army. In 1947 it was purchased by a Chinese company. After the revolution in 1949, it continued operations until 1952, when it was confiscated and used by the Municipal Construction Department. In 1965 it resumed operations as a hotel, as a wing of the Peace Hotel.\n\nSimilar to its counterpart to the north, the South Building was renovated in preparation for the 2010 World Expo. It emerged as The Swatch Art Peace Hotel. It hosts artists from around the world who live and work for a limited time in apartments/workshops. The heritage facade and public rooms of the building have been restored.\n\n\n"}

This station is located along Changi South Avenue 1 at the junction of Expo Drive, in between Changi City Point and the Singapore Expo, which this station is named after.\n\nExpo station is one of the five MRT stations in Singapore that have both an above-ground platform (East West line) and an underground platform (Downtown line). The other four stations are Woodlands MRT station, Paya Lebar MRT station, Buona Vista MRT station and Tampines MRT station. The section of underground tracks between this station and Changi Airport MRT station is among the longest between any two MRT stations in Singapore.\n\nExpo station currently serves as the eastern terminus of the Downtown Line; this is slated to be replaced by Sungei Bedok MRT station in 2024.\n\nPlans for this station were first announced by then Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on 15 November 1996 as part of an extension to Changi Airport MRT station. At that time, the Expo station was known as an \"intermediate station\".\n\nTrain services to Expo station were initially operated as a 2-station shuttle service from Tanah Merah when the station first opened and it was first denoted by code E13 for a short while until the MRT map was revamped in 2001 by former cabinet minister Yeo Cheow Tong (who was then Transport Minister). It was then converted to a through service from Boon Lay station when the other station on the Changi Extension, Changi Airport, opened. However, to cut costs due to ridership falling below expectations, the service was reverted into shuttle mode on 22 July 2003.\n\nThe initial numbering of this station was EW28, until 20 June that year when it was changed to CG1. The same numbering is now used for Pioneer station.\n\nThe station has high passenger traffic whenever there are major events occurring in the Singapore Expo. The recent expansion of Singapore Expo helped increase the passenger traffic in the station. However, traffic is still rather low at certain times of the year when there are not many events held. However, this changed in the 4th quarter of 2011 when a new shopping mall called Changi City Point opened south of the station and was linked to the station by an underpass, bringing more crowds to the station. A business hotel, Park Avenue Changi, is located next to the station.\n\nAs with most of the above-ground stations built in the past along the East West line, it was built without platform screen doors that prevent commuters from falling onto the train tracks. Installation of the half-height screen doors started on 20 June 2011 as the last station of the East West line. On 31 August that year, all of the screen doors have been installed and began operating, marking the completion of the installation of all the Platform Screen Doors along the East West line.\n\nOn 28 November 2011, LTA marked the start of construction of Downtown line 3 (DTL3) with a groundbreaking ceremony at this station. On 31 May 2017, LTA announced that the station, together with the rest of DTL3, will be opened on 21 October that year.\n\nTo facilitate the construction for the Downtown line 3 Expo station and its tunnels, part of Changi South Avenue 1 towards Somapah Road and Changi South Avenue 2, together with a short section of Expo Drive were temporarily closed to traffic from 2 October 2011 to May 2017. The Expo Drive was also reopened at the same time. The original underpass as seen in Changi South Avenue 1 has been converted from the public underpass to paid link underpass for connection to Downtown line whereas the public link is still available at Expo MRT station with a barricade that is only locked when train services are not running. The station has increased the number of exits from 2 to 7 due to high traffic footfall of Changi Business Park.\n\nAt the same time, TITAN faregates were being installed at Expo MRT station on 13 July that year, replacing second generation ST Electronics faregates.\n\nIt sports a space-age architecture designed by Sir Norman Foster. The roof is clad in titanium, steel, and glass. Its design enabled the platform to be columns-free, invoking a sense of spaciousness. The station is built to handle fluctuating passenger volumes due to events at the adjacent Singapore Expo and has the large spaces needed to facilitate smooth traffic flow.\n\nThe Downtown line platforms feature a blue wall with the different names of some of the world's most famous metros and an installation on the History and Future of the MRT.\n\nOn 25 May 2019, the Land Transport Authority announced an extension of the Thomson–East Coast line (TEL) to Changi Airport. Set to be completed by 2040, The TEL will be extended from its current terminus at Sungei Bedok MRT station to serve the future Changi Airport Terminal 5, and the stretch between Tanah Merah and Changi Airport, which is currently part of the East-West line, will be transferred over to the Thomson-East Coast line.\n\n"}

{"id": "1846371", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1846371", "title": "Air–fuel ratio", "text": "Air–fuel ratio\n\nAir–fuel ratio (AFR) is the mass ratio of air to a solid, liquid, or gaseous fuel present in a combustion process. The combustion may take place in a controlled manner such as in an internal combustion engine or industrial furnace, or may result in an explosion (e.g., a dust explosion, gas or vapour explosion or in a thermobaric weapon). \n\nThe air-fuel ratio determines whether a mixture is combustible at all, how much energy is being released, and how much unwanted pollutants are produced in the reaction. Typically a range of fuel to air ratios exists, outside of which ignition will not occur. These are known as the lower and upper explosive limits.\n\nIn an internal combustion engine or industrial furnace, the air-fuel ratio is an important measure for anti-pollution and performance-tuning reasons. If exactly enough air is provided to completely burn all of the fuel, the ratio is known as the stoichiometric mixture, often abbreviated to stoich. Ratios lower than stoichiometric are considered \"rich\". Rich mixtures are less efficient, but may produce more power and burn cooler. Ratios higher than stoichiometric are considered \"lean.\" Lean mixtures are more efficient but may cause higher temperatures, which can lead to the formation of nitrogen oxides. Some engines are designed with features to allow lean-burn. For precise air-fuel ratio calculations, the oxygen content of combustion air should be specified because of different air density due to different altitude or intake air temperature, possible dilution by ambient water vapor, or enrichment by oxygen additions.\n\nIn theory a stoichiometric mixture has just enough air to completely burn the available fuel. In practice this is never quite achieved, due primarily to the very short time available in an internal combustion engine for each combustion cycle. Most of the combustion process is completed in approximately 2 milliseconds at an engine speed of . (100 revolutions per second; 10 milliseconds per revolution of crank shaft - which for a four stroke engine would mean typically 5 millisecond for each piston stroke). This is the time that elapses from the spark plug firing until 90% of the fuel–air mix is combusted, typically some 80 degrees of crankshaft rotation later. Catalytic converters are designed to work best when the exhaust gases passing through them are the result of nearly perfect combustion.\n\nA stoichiometric mixture unfortunately burns very hot and can damage engine components if the engine is placed under high load at this fuel–air mixture. Due to the high temperatures at this mixture, detonation of the fuel–air mix while approaching or shortly after maximum cylinder pressure is possible under high load (referred to as knocking or pinging), specifically a \"pre-detonation\" event in the context of a spark-ignition engine model. Such detonation can cause serious engine damage as the uncontrolled burning of the fuel air mix can create very high pressures in the cylinder. As a consequence, stoichiometric mixtures are only used under light to low-moderate load conditions. For acceleration and high-load conditions, a richer mixture (lower air–fuel ratio) is used to produce cooler combustion products and so avoid overheating of the cylinder head, and thereby prevent detonation.\n\nThe stoichiometric mixture for a gasoline engine is the ideal ratio of air to fuel that burns all fuel with no excess air. For gasoline fuel, the stoichiometric air–fuel mixture is about 14.7:1 i.e. for every one gram of fuel, 14.7 grams of air are required. The fuel oxidation reaction is:\nAny mixture greater than 14.7:1 is considered a lean mixture; any less than 14.7:1 is a rich mixture – given perfect (ideal) \"test\" fuel (gasoline consisting of solely \"n\"-heptane and iso-octane). In reality, most fuels consist of a combination of heptane, octane, a handful of other alkanes, plus additives including detergents, and possibly oxygenators such as MTBE (methyl tert-butyl ether) or ethanol/methanol. These compounds all alter the stoichiometric ratio, with most of the additives pushing the ratio downward (oxygenators bring extra oxygen to the combustion event in liquid form that is released at time of combustions; for MTBE-laden fuel, a stoichiometric ratio can be as low as 14.1:1). Vehicles that use an oxygen sensor or other feedback loop to control fuel to air ratio (lambda control), compensate automatically for this change in the fuel's stoichiometric rate by measuring the exhaust gas composition and controlling fuel volume. Vehicles without such controls (such as most motorcycles until recently, and cars predating the mid-1980s) may have difficulties running certain fuel blends (especially winter fuels used in some areas) and may require different jets (or otherwise have the fueling ratios altered) to compensate. Vehicles that use oxygen sensors can monitor the air–fuel ratio with an air–fuel ratio meter.\n\nIn the typical air to natural gas combustion burner, a double cross limit strategy is employed to ensure ratio control. (This method was used in World War II). The strategy involves adding the opposite flow feedback into the limiting control of the respective gas (air or fuel). This assures ratio control within an acceptable margin.\n\nThere are other terms commonly used when discussing the mixture of air and fuel in internal combustion engines.\n\nMixture is the predominant word that appears in training texts, operation manuals and maintenance manuals in the aviation world.\n\nAir–fuel ratio is the ratio between the \"mass\" of air and the mass of fuel in the fuel–air mix at any given moment. The mass is the mass of all constituents that compose the fuel and air, whether combustible or not. For example, a calculation of the mass of natural gas—which often contains carbon dioxide (), nitrogen (), and various alkanes—includes the mass of the carbon dioxide, nitrogen and all alkanes in determining the value of \"m\".\n\nFor pure octane the stoichiometric mixture is approximately 15.1:1, or \"λ\" of 1.00 exactly.\n\nIn naturally aspirated engines powered by octane, maximum power is frequently reached at AFRs ranging from 12.5 to 13.3:1 or \"λ\" of 0.850 to 0.901.\n\nAir-fuel ratio of 12:1 is considered as maximum output ratio, where as the air-fuel ratio of 16:1 is considered as maximum fuel economy ratio.\n\nFuel–air ratio is commonly used in the gas turbine industry as well as in government studies of internal combustion engine, and refers to the ratio of fuel to the air.\n\nAir–fuel equivalence ratio, \"λ\" (lambda), is the ratio of actual AFR to stoichiometry for a given mixture. \"λ\" = 1.0 is at stoichiometry, rich mixtures \"λ\" < 1.0, and lean mixtures \"λ\" > 1.0.\n\nThere is a direct relationship between \"λ\" and AFR. To calculate AFR from a given \"λ\", multiply the measured \"λ\" by the stoichiometric AFR for that fuel. Alternatively, to recover \"λ\" from an AFR, divide AFR by the stoichiometric AFR for that fuel. This last equation is often used as the definition of \"λ\":\n\nBecause the composition of common fuels varies seasonally, and because many modern vehicles can handle different fuels, when tuning, it makes more sense to talk about \"λ\" values rather than AFR.\n\nMost practical AFR devices actually measure the amount of residual oxygen (for lean mixes) or unburnt hydrocarbons (for rich mixtures) in the exhaust gas.\n\nThe fuel–air equivalence ratio, \"ϕ\" (phi), of a system is defined as the ratio of the fuel-to-oxidizer ratio to the stoichiometric fuel-to-oxidizer ratio. Mathematically,\n\nwhere, \"m\" represents the mass, \"n\" represents number of moles, suffix st stands for stoichiometric conditions.\n\nThe advantage of using equivalence ratio over fuel–oxidizer ratio is that it takes into account (and is therefore independent of) both mass and molar values for the fuel and the oxidizer. Consider, for example, a mixture of one mole of ethane () and one mole of oxygen (). The fuel–oxidizer ratio of this mixture based on the mass of fuel and air is\n\nand the fuel-oxidizer ratio of this mixture based on the number of moles of fuel and air is\n\nClearly the two values are not equal. To compare it with the equivalence ratio, we need to determine the fuel–oxidizer ratio of ethane and oxygen mixture. For this we need to consider the stoichiometric reaction of ethane and oxygen,\n\nThis gives\n\nThus we can determine the equivalence ratio of the given mixture as\n\nor, equivalently, as\n\nAnother advantage of using the equivalence ratio is that ratios greater than one always mean there is more fuel in the fuel–oxidizer mixture than required for complete combustion (stoichiometric reaction), irrespective of the fuel and oxidizer being used—while ratios less than one represent a deficiency of fuel or equivalently excess oxidizer in the mixture. This is not the case if one uses fuel–oxidizer ratio, which take different values for different mixtures.\n\nThe fuel–air equivalence ratio is related to the air–fuel equivalence ratio (defined previously) as follows:\n\nThe relative amounts of oxygen enrichment and fuel dilution can be quantified by the mixture fraction, Z, defined as\nwhere\n\"Y\" and \"Y\" represent the fuel and oxidizer mass fractions at the inlet, \"W\" and \"W\" are the species molecular weights, and \"v\" and \"v\" are the fuel and oxygen stoichiometric coefficients, respectively. The stoichiometric mixture fraction is\nThe stoichiometric mixture fraction is related to \"λ\" (lambda) and \"ϕ\" (phi) by the equations\nassuming\n\nIn industrial fired heaters, power plant steam generators, and large gas-fired turbines, the more common terms are percent excess combustion air and percent stoichiometric air. For example, excess combustion air of 15 percent means that 15 percent more than the required stoichiometric air (or 115 percent of stoichiometric air) is being used.\n\nA combustion control point can be defined by specifying the percent excess air (or oxygen) in the oxidant, or by specifying the percent oxygen in the combustion product. An air–fuel ratio meter may be used to measure the percent oxygen in the combustion gas, from which the percent excess oxygen can be calculated from stoichiometry and a mass balance for fuel combustion. For example, for propane () combustion between stoichiometric and 30 percent excess air (AFR between 15.58 and 20.3), the relationship between percent excess air and percent oxygen is: \n\n\n"}

He last played and captained the Iserlohn Roosters of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL).\n\nYork was born in Waterford, Michigan. As a youth, he played in the 1991 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with the Detroit Little Caesars minor ice hockey team. He later played for the Detroit Compuware Ambassadors, where he scored 136 goals in 1993–94. He attended Lutheran High School Northwest in Rochester Hills, Michigan, and from there went to Ontario where he played for the MTHL's Thornhill Islanders. It was there that he led the league in scoring and was named rookie of the year. His play in Ontario drew the attention of Michigan State University where he spent four years as a member of the Spartans hockey team. He was a Hobey Baker Memorial Award finalist and NCAA All-American in 1998 and 1999 and CCHA Player of the Year in 1999.\n\nYork was drafted in the 6th round of the 1997 NHL Entry Draft by the New York Rangers. During his time playing for the Rangers, York played on a line with Theoren Fleury and Eric Lindros. This was nicknamed the \"FLY\" line, getting its name from the last initial of each player on it. He was named to the 1999–2000 NHL All-Rookie team, scoring 26 goals during his rookie season. In 2002, York was a member of the silver medal winning Team USA in the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, and played in the 52nd National Hockey League All-Star Game as a member of the North American team.\n\nHe was later dealt to the Edmonton Oilers in exchange for defenseman Tom Poti, who had become a target of fans for his perceived indifference. In Edmonton, York became an integral part of the team, playing on the top two lines and also on the penalty kill, where for a time he formed a formidable duo with Todd Marchant. In the 2004–05 season he played in Germany for the Iserlohn Roosters in the Deutsche Eishockey Liga. He was the second best scorer in the whole league. On August 3, 2005, York was traded from the Oilers to the New York Islanders with a conditional draft pick in exchange for Michael Peca. After a season and a half with the Islanders, he was traded to the Philadelphia Flyers for Randy Robitaille and a 5th round draft pick on December 20, 2006. He signed with the Phoenix Coyotes to a 1-year, $1 million contract in the off-season.\n\nOn July 11, 2008, he signed a contract with KHL team HC Sibir Novosibirsk; he opted out of this deal on July 25, after he signed a one-year deal with the Columbus Blue Jackets. Following that season, on August 19, 2009, he signed an AHL-only contract with the Rochester Americans, allowing him to sign with any NHL team during the season. On September 10, 2010, he signed a one-year contract with the Lathi Pelicans of the Finnish Liiga.\n\nYork scored 27 points in 52 games as the Pelicans narrowly avoided relegation. On May 13, 2011, York left to sign a one-year contract returning to Germany with the Iserlohn Roosters, with whom he spent a season from the 2004 NHL Lockout.\n\nAfter a total of six seasons within the Roosters organization, York was not re-signed by the club following the 2015–16 season. Earning a cult status throughout his tenure in Iserlohn, it was announced that York's number 78 would be taken out of circulation, to be retired by the club at a later date. On September 2, 2016, York announced the end of his playing career, in accepting a student assistant coaching role in returning to Michigan State University to complete a communications degree.\n"}

He played professionally as a quarterback in the National Football League (NFL) for eight seasons with the Oakland Raiders and New York Jets. Tuiasosopo was selected in the second round of the 2001 NFL Draft by the Raiders with the 59th overall pick. In 2013, he joined his alma mater, the University of Washington, serving as quarterbacks coach and as interim head coach in the 2013 Fight Hunger Bowl. Tuiasosopo is currently the tight ends coach for the University of California, Berkeley. He was previously the passing game coordinator/quarterbacks coach at UCLA.\n\nBorn in Long Beach, California, Tuiasosopo was raised in Woodinville, a suburb northeast of Seattle. An excellent athlete, he was also a standout shortstop in baseball at Woodinville High School. After his senior year, Tuiasosopo was selected in the 28th round of the 1997 MLB Draft by the Minnesota Twins, but chose to play college football instead. Although he played on both offense & defense in high school (option quarterback & safety), he was primarily recruited by Division I football programs to play defense.\n\nTuiasosopo accepted a football scholarship to the nearby University of Washington in Seattle, primarily because head coach Jim Lambright was one of the few that granted him the opportunity to compete at quarterback, rather than just at safety.\n\nAs a true freshman in 1997, Tuiasosopo rose to second on the depth chart at quarterback. In the season's third week, he was called into action in a nationally televised home game against Nebraska, due to an injury to starter Brock Huard. Despite losing 27-14, Tuiasosopo was impressive against the sixth-ranked (and eventual national champion) Cornhuskers, throwing for 270 yards and two touchdowns. Later in the year against Oregon, he became the Huskies' first true freshman to start a game at quarterback, throwing for 261 yards and rushing for 95, in a 31-28 loss. He also played considerably the following year for the oft-injured Huard, and was never redshirted. Following his sophomore season in 1998, Rick Neuheisel replaced Lambright as head coach and named Tuiasosopo as the starting quarterback to replace the graduating Huard. As a junior in October 1999, Tuiasosopo became the only player in NCAA college football history to pass for over 300 yards and run for over 200 yards in a game, during a 35-30 victory over the Stanford Cardinal at Husky Stadium. That year, he led the Huskies to a 6-2 conference record, finishing in second place to the Cardinal and earning the team a bid to the Holiday Bowl.\n\nAs a senior in 2000, he led the Huskies to the Pac-10 title and a 34-24 Rose Bowl victory over Drew Brees and the Purdue Boilermakers, and was named the MVP of the game. The Huskies finished the season with an 11-1 record, ranked third in the national polls. The season included a victory over the Miami Hurricanes at Husky Stadium in September, the Hurricanes' only loss of the season. Tuiasosopo threw for 225 yards and a touchdown, and ran for 45 yards and another touchdown in the 34-29 win, earning national acclaim while finishing eighth in Heisman voting.\n\nWhile at Washington, Tuiasosopo majored in business administration.\n\nTuiasosopo was selected by the Raiders in the second round of the 2001 NFL Draft, the 59th overall pick and the fourth quarterback selected (behind Michael Vick, Drew Brees, and Quincy Carter).\n\nIn the NFL, Tuiasosopo was primarily a reserve quarterback, the Raiders' backup to Rich Gannon and Kerry Collins. He was on the sidelines for Super Bowl XXXVII at the conclusion of the 2002 season, but did not appear in the game as his team lost 48-21. His first significant playing time came during a Monday Night Football game during the 2003 season, throwing for 224 yards, all in the second half. Marques played well enough to earn his first career NFL start the following week, but struggled, throwing for just 65 yards along with an interception before leaving the game with an injury late in the first half. He did not start another game until late in the 2005 season, where he again struggled losing 26-10. He was promptly demoted back to the sidelines the next week. The team finished just 4-12 in the 2005 season with primarily Collins as the starting quarterback, paving the way for the younger Tuiasosopo to receive more consideration for the job.\n\nTuiasosopo signed a one-year contract with the New York Jets on March 23, 2007.\n\nA free agent in the 2008 offseason, Tuiasosopo re-signed with the Raiders on May 22, on a one-year contract in his final NFL season.\n\nFollowing his playing career, Tuiasosopo became an assistant strength coach in 2009 at his alma mater, the University of Washington. He moved to UCLA in 2011, on the staff of Neuheisel, his former head coach. He remained with UCLA under new head coach Jim Mora as the tight ends coach in 2012, then returned to the University of Washington in 2013 as quarterbacks coach under fifth-year head coach Steve Sarkisian. Upon Sarkisian's acceptance of the USC head coaching job at the end of the 2013 regular season, Tuiasosopo was named interim head coach for Washington's bowl game. Shortly after leading the Huskies to a win in the 2013 Fight Hunger Bowl Tuiasosopo left Washington to join Sarkisian's staff at USC as tight ends coach and was also given the title of associate head coach.\n\nOn January 13, 2016, UCLA announced the hiring of Tuiasosopo as quarterbacks coach/passing game coordinator.\n\nOn January 23, 2017, Tuiasosopo was announced as the quarterbacks coach/passing game coordinator for the University of California, Berkeley.\nIn 2019, the program realigned the coaching staff and he began working with the tight ends.\n\nTuiasosopo is the son of former NFL defensive lineman Manu Tuiasosopo, who played collegiately for UCLA, then professionally from 1979 to 1986 for the Seahawks and 49ers, being a starter at nose tackle and winning Super Bowl XIX. Marques' brother is fullback Zach Tuiasosopo, who played for the Philadelphia Eagles until he was waived on July 11, 2007. Zach and Marques were also teammates on the Raiders for part of a season. His youngest brother, Matt, played baseball for the Seattle Mariners, Detroit Tigers and Atlanta Braves. Their sister Leslie, the eldest of the five siblings, played volleyball for Washington, trained with the U.S. national team, and as of 2013 was the Huskies' associate head coach. Marques' younger sister, Ashley, played outfield for the Washington softball team and helped lead the Huskies to a national championship in 2009. His wife Lisa is a former collegiate volleyball player and they have three children.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1846395", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1846395", "title": "Jungle Cruise", "text": "Jungle Cruise\n\nThe Jungle Cruise is a river boat attraction located in Adventureland at many Disney Parks worldwide, namely Disneyland, Magic Kingdom, Tokyo Disneyland and Hong Kong Disneyland (the attraction at Hong Kong Disneyland is named \"Jungle River Cruise\"). Disneyland Paris and Shanghai Disneyland are the only Magic Kingdom-style Disney parks that do not have the Jungle Cruise in their attraction rosters.\n\nThe attraction simulates a riverboat cruise down several major rivers of Asia, Africa and South America. Park guests board replica tramp steamers from a 1930s British explorers' lodge and are taken on a voyage past many different Audio-Animatronic jungle animals. The tour is led by a live Disney Cast Member delivering humorous narration. This narration is based on a written and practiced script, but generally is largely delivered ad-lib.\n\nSources of inspiration for the attraction include a 1955 \"True-Life Adventure\", \"The African Lion,\" about a pride of lions, and the film \"The African Queen\". Imagineer Harper Goff referenced the \"African Queen\" frequently in his ideas; even his designs of the ride vehicles were inspired by the steamer used in the film. The project was placed on the schedule to open with the July 17, 1955 debut of Disneyland.\n\nWhen plans began to develop, Bill Evans, the Imagineer responsible for landscaping Disneyland and most of Walt Disney World, faced the daunting task of creating a convincing jungle on a limited budget. Aside from importing many actual tropical plants, he made wide use of \"character plants\" which, while not necessarily exotic, could give the appearance of exoticism in context. In a particularly well-known trick, he uprooted local orange trees and \"replanted\" them upside-down, growing vines on the exposed roots. Disney controls the clarity of the water (known as \"turbidity\") in order to obscure from guests' view the boat's guidance system and undesirable items like perches and mechanized platforms of the bathing elephants and hippos. Initially, the clean water was dyed brown but after a few years the colorant was changed to a green hue and in recent years a bluish-green has been used. The water of the Jungle Cruise is approximately 5 feet deep and is part of the park's 'dark' water system which circulates southward from the northern end of Frontierland's Rivers of America, through Fantasyland and creates the moat of Sleeping Beauty Castle. The water's journey continues flowing past Frontierland's entrance and into Adventureland where it meanders alongside the Tiki Room before entering the Jungle Cruise beside the ride's exit. The water returns to the south end of the Rivers of America via a 37\" diameter underground pipe near Tarzan's Treehouse. Originally, the Jungle Cruise waterway was 1,920 feet in length before being slightly shortened and re-routed in 1994.\n\nAlthough Goff and Evans can be credited with the creation and initial design of the ride, Marc Davis, recognized for his work on venerable attractions such as The Haunted Mansion and Pirates of the Caribbean, added his own style to the ride in later versions and Disneyland updates. The \"Indian Elephant Bathing Pool\" and \"Rhinoceros Chasing Explorers up a Pole\" were among his contributions.\n\nThe attraction was in the opening day roster of the park, and has remained open and largely unchanged in theme and story since then. The original plan was to use real animals, but these plans were abandoned once Disney realized that the animals would likely sleep during the day. Aside from alterations and maintenance changes, four completely new show scenes have been added to date. In 1994 the river channel was rerouted to make way for the queue buildings and entrance courtyard of the Indiana Jones Adventure.\n\nWhile the current version and most previous instances have made use of a comedic spiel, filled with intentionally bad puns, the original intent of the ride was to provide a realistic, believable voyage through the world's jungles. Until 1962, the original spiel had no jokes and sounded much like the narration of a nature documentary.\n\nThe queue and station are themed as the headquarters and boathouse of the Jungle Navigation Company, a river trading company located in a British colony (as evidenced by the Union Jack flying above the boathouse) circa 1938. The queuing area is cluttered with appropriate props, such as pinned insects, an old radio on top of a bookshelf, an old typewriter, and a chessboard with miniature animals and decorated shotgun shells replacing the pieces. The extended queue winds upstairs, underneath an Audio-Animatronic great hornbill, and then downstairs again. Big band music from the 1930s and 1940s plays overhead, punctuated by jungle-related news bulletins, helping to reinforce the setting and threading together the show scenes and boat.\n\nOnce aboard the boats, guests are introduced to their skipper and they head into the jungle, allegedly never to return. The first rivers simulated are the Irrawaddy and Mekong rivers, representing tropical Southeast Asia. The boats sail through a dense rainforest inhabited by large butterflies and a pair of toucans, before passing by the Temple of the Forbidden Eye and a shrine to the Hindu monkey deity Hanuman. Passengers then glide precariously under the first of a pair of stone arches severely damaged by an earthquake centuries ago. These are part of the ruins of an ancient Cambodian city where a crumbling temple is one of the few things which have managed to avoid tumbling into the river. Here passengers see an Indo-Chinese tiger, giant spiders, king cobras and mugger crocodiles. Passing a statue of the elephant-headed Hindu deity Ganesha, the boats pass under the second arch and enter the Sacred Indian Elephant Bathing Pool. Here a large herd of Indian elephants frolic and squirt water at the passing vessels.\n\nThe theme moves to the rivers of Africa, and riders see a family of baboons, and a safari camp that has been overrun by gorillas. The boats narrowly avoid the dramatic waterfall, Schweitzer Falls (which riders are told is named after Dr. Albert Falls), and turn down Africa's Nile river where they pass between two African elephants, and large termite mounds. A tableau of the African Veldt follows, showing zebras, wildebeest, giraffes, and gazelles watching a pride of lions feasting on a zebra beneath a rocky outcropping. Beyond the lion's den, an angry rhinoceros has chased a safari party up a tree. Antelope and hyenas watch from nearby. The skipper then pilots the boat into the Congo river disturbing a pod of hippos that signal their intent to attack the boat.\n\nDrums and chanting are heard as the boats come to headhunter territory. The vehicles pass a native village before sailing into an ambush by natives wielding spears, the sound effects for which are usually provided by the skipper.\n\nThe boats now pass behind Schweitzer Falls (referred to as \"the Backside of Water\") to enter the Amazon River. Skeletal animal remains and warning signs featuring pictures of dagger-toothed fish forewarn the next show scene, where the boats encounter a swarm of leaping piranha. The guests then pass a couple of water buffalo and a boa constrictor before they meet shrunken head dealer Trader Sam (\"He'll trade you two of his heads for just one of yours\") before returning to the dock.\n\n\nDescription of specific changes:\nThe baboons at the safari jeep camp previously sat on the African termite mounds. A total of six lions have been removed since opening day: one that growled when the African Veldt was added, two lionesses from the Veldt that were fighting over a bloody strand of zebra meat, a lion and a lioness that each had a zebra leg in their mouth, and a dead lion hanging on a spit over a fire in the native village. Also removed from the Veldt were jackals barking at the pride.\n\nThere are 12 vehicles, with a maximum of 8 in operation at any given time. The boats in 1955 were painted as clean, idealized replicas, but have since been given a more realistic theming reflecting the grunge and wear of actual watercraft due to the addition of Indiana Jones Adventure and its ruggedness.\nNames in use:\n\nNames decommissioned in 1997:\n\nThe skipper introduces himself or herself, and begins to take the boat full of guests down the tropical rivers of the world. The ride starts out in the Amazon River, where the passengers encounter butterflies with one-foot wingspans, or as the skipper might say, twelve inches. The boat then passes Inspiration Falls, which transitions into the Congo River in Africa.\n\nThe skipper explains that there is a pygmy welcoming party waiting for them, but when the boat arrives at the beach, the canoes are empty, and the place deserted. The skipper wonders what scared off the pygmies, and they soon discover that it was a giant python. The boat then passes a camp that has been raided by gorillas, which transitions the cruise into the Nile River.\n\nAfter encountering two elephants, the boat passes along the African Veldt, where numerous African animals watch a pride of lions eat their kill. The boat then passes a lost safari group that has been chased up a pole by an angry rhinoceros and are now trapped. The group then passes by another waterfall, Schweitzer Falls (which riders are told is named after Dr. Albert Falls) and heads past the remains of a plane crash. The boat then encounters a pool of hippos, about to charge the boat until the skipper scares them off. Ominous drums are heard as the group enters headhunter territory. Natives are seen dancing near the boat and guests soon find themselves in an ambush. They escape and proceed into the Mekong River.\n\nThey enter a temple which has been destroyed by an earthquake. Inside, baboons, cobras, giant spiders and a tiger can be found. After they exit, they come across an elephant bathing pool where numerous elephants are relaxing in the water. The boat narrowly avoids being sprayed by water from one of the elephants. The cruise concludes after passing Chief Nami or Trader Sam (Trader Sam-Ta during Christmas), the head salesman of the jungle, who offers two shrunken heads for one of the passengers'.\n\nThe Walt Disney World Jungle Cruise is set as a depression-era British outpost on the Amazon River, operated by the fictional company, The Jungle Navigation Co., whose advertisement poster is painted on the wall near the exit of the attraction. Albert Awol's broadcast is different from that of Disneyland's, being ride specific. Also unlike Disneyland, the queue never extended to a second level.\n\nNear the Hippo Pool, a piece of a downed airplane can be seen along the shoreline. This is the back half of the Lockheed Model 12 Electra Junior previously found at The Great Movie Ride at Disney's Hollywood Studios in the Casablanca scene.\nEach variety of plant throughout the attraction was carefully selected by landscape architect Bill Evans to ensure that the foliage would be able to endure Florida's unique climate: hot summers and relatively cool winters. The most difficult aspect of this was making sure these plants had the appropriate look and feel of traditional tropical plants in the equatorial jungle.\n\nA Holiday overlay, Jingle Cruise, runs during the Holiday season at the Magic Kingdom in Walt Disney World and the Disneyland Resort. This started in the Holiday season of 2013.\n\nA Jungle Cruise themed restaurant, the Skipper Canteen, opened in December 2015 and expanded on the Jungle Navigation Co. storyline, making Dr. Albert Falls into the founder of the company in 1911, with his granddaughter Alberta Falls taking charge of the Navigation Company and the Jungle Cruise in the 1930s.\n\nThe queue of the Jungle Cruise is heavily themed with period artifacts, tools, gear, photos and more. It is intended to resemble a colonial outpost where an exploration of the jungle rivers may be booked. It is divided into four main sections which may be opened or closed in sequence to accommodate crowd fluctuation. The queue was designed to wind about extensively so that guests may see all of the different artifacts in the queue. The most notable section of the queue is the office of Albert Awol.\n\nThere are 15 vehicles, with a maximum of 9 in operation at any given time.\n\nRetired boats\n\nThe Magic Kingdom and Tokyo Disneyland attractions are very similar to each other, with the exception of a few minor differences. While the boats in the Magic Kingdom's attraction travel counter-clockwise, the boats at Tokyo Disneyland travel in a clockwise direction.\n\nIn Tokyo Disneyland, the station and surrounding area are themed to a more upscale African city, as opposed to an isolated jungle outpost. This version shares a station building with the park's steam train ride, Western River Railroad. The spiels in Tokyo Disneyland are delivered in Japanese.\n\nIn 2015, the ride was refurbished to include special effects.\n\nThere are 13 vehicles, with a maximum of 12 in operation at any given time.\n\nAll boat names, except Orinoco Ida, are alliterations.\n\nDisneyland Paris does not have any Jungle Cruise attraction, due to the cold temperature and weather of northern France. Because many copies of the original Jungle Cruise attractions exist in other French theme parks, French guests might be used to the experience and not find it exciting. An indoor jeep ride called \"Jungle Expedition\" was originally planned at the opening of the park, but was cancelled due to financial difficulties.\n\nThe shape of Hong Kong Disneyland's route is significantly different compared to the others, and circumnavigates Tarzan's Treehouse. A grand finale is included with a battle between angry fire and water gods. Three languages are regularly available: Cantonese, English, and Mandarin. Each language has a separate queue, allowing visitors to experience the journey in their preferred language.\n\nThe queue takes place in a small boathouse of The Jungle Navigation Co. that is less elaborate than the boathouses found at the other parks. After winding through the queue, guests board one of the boats and meet their skipper who speaks either English, Cantonese, or Mandarin, to accompany the park's guests who speak many different languages themselves.\n\nThe boats then depart and head down the river, past Tarzan's Treehouse where the skipper tells guests to wave goodbye to the guests traversing the treehouse, for they will never see them again. The boats then drift past an Indian elephant and her calf playing in the water, followed by another elephant showering in a waterfall. A large bull Indian elephant emerges from the water squirting a plume of water at the boats with the guests narrowly avoiding the free shower.\n\nThe vessels then drift down a narrow stream past ancient Cambodian ruins which have been claimed by the jungle. Giant spiders and king cobras watch the boats as they move on. Up ahead several crocodiles are seen resting on a small beach, while a school of hungry piranha are jumping in the hopes of attacking the guests. The boats escape into Africa and they pass a large safari camp where several curious gorillas have discovered clothes, guns, hammocks, and books, as the \"Trashing the Camp\" song from \"Tarzan\" plays on a nearby 1930s radio. The African Veldt comes into view where antelope, giraffes, zebras, and African elephants stare at the boats. The vessels then drift into a small pool where a pod of hippos try to tip the boat. Several feet ahead a rhino is seen chasing a safari group up a tree while several hyenas look on laughing.\n\nSkulls and cloth impaled on broken bamboo sticks appears as tribal drums and horns fill the air. The skipper tells guests that they have entered head hunter country and must quietly sneak by. The boats slowly pass through the main village where several upright shields rest in the tall grass. A native notices the boats and all the shields now revealed to have head hunters behind them begin firing spears and poison darts at the boats as they narrowly escape into a rocky canyon. In the rocky canyon, the boats stop near two unusual rock formations that look like faces, revealed by the skipper to be the fire god and the water god who constantly feud over their differences. The fire god sets the river ablaze while the water god vomits a water bomb, causing the flames to die and the whole canyon to become a cloud of steam. The boats escape the canyon and pass a baby elephant before returning to the boathouse.\n\n\nThere are 9 vehicles, with a maximum of 8 in operation at any given time.\n\nAlbert Awol is a fictional Jungle Cruise boat captain and disc jockey for the Disney Broadcasting Company. Considered the \"Voice of the Jungle\", he broadcasts everything from news, to quizzes, reminders, weather, etc. on the DBC (Disney Broadcast Company). He also serves as a period disc jockey for the station, filling the airwaves with music from the 1930s Depression era.\n\nAlbert Awol was added in 1991 to the Jungle Cruise during a refurbishment. According to one report:\nAlbert's broadcast is projected not just over the Jungle Cruise queuing area, but over Adventureland as a whole, setting the time period. In Disneyland, Albert is replaced by \"Jungle Radio.\" Various air personalities comment on the environment, the luminaries who are in the area (including references to the designers of the attraction - Harper Goff, Bob Mattey, Winston Hibler [True-Life Adventure films, upon which Jungle Cruise is based]). The music is a good deal slower in pace and tempo than the tracks used at Walt Disney World. The music was previously linked with the outdoor speakers at the Temple of the Forbidden Eye (Indiana Jones Adventure), however, two separate tracks of material with similar tone and some songs now exist. The Jungle Radio at Disneyland does connect the setting with the nearby Indiana Jones attraction, and ties in announcements that reference Indiana Jones, and the temple in which the ride is set.\n\nSince 2013, a Christmas overlay called Jingle Cruise has run during the holiday season in the Magic Kingdom and Disneyland versions of the Jungle Cruise except for 2017 at Disneyland in which the overlay was not installed.\n\nIn April 2017, it was reported that the ride will undergo extensive planning to change the ride. The updated re-engineering and redesign has extended to the future-star of the film adaptation Dwayne Johnson, and his film production company. Johnson is working with Disney to implement the changes for Walt Disney Parks and Resorts locations worldwide.\n\nA studio recorded soundtrack of the \"Jungle Cruise\" was released in 1968 by Disneyland Records included as the B side of the album \"Walt Disney Presents The Enchanted Tiki Room and the Adventurous Jungle Cruise\" (ST-3966). The Jungle Cruise attraction has always featured narration by a live Disney Cast Member; for the release the narration was provided by Thurl Ravenscroft. This soundtrack was also used in Disneyland television features as early as 1964.\n\nFor years, Walt Disney Pictures had been toying with the idea of turning the \"Jungle Cruise\" into a full-length action adventure motion picture, which it would be loosely inspired by the theme park attraction of the same name. The film, originally scheduled for release in 2007, experienced various delays and changes. Shooting of the film, originally scheduled for 2006, was postponed. Moreover, the original screenplay by Josh Goldstein and John Norville was reportedly rewritten by Al Gough and Miles Millar. The film plot follows a group's riverboat journey through a jungle in search of a cure. Though initially announced to star \"Toy Story\" duo Tom Hanks and Tim Allen, a new iteration of the project is moving forward with Dwayne Johnson starring. The film is described as a \"period piece in the vein of Humphrey Bogart's \"The African Queen\".\" Later, Johnson signed on as a producer in addition to his starring role, and the film is scheduled to start filming in spring 2018. In April 2017, Johnson expressed his interest in having Patty Jenkins helm the project. In July later that year, Jaume Collet-Serra signed on to direct. In late January 2018, Emily Blunt joined the cast while Michael Green was hired to rework the script which was initially written by J.D. Payne and Patrick McKay. In March 2018, Jack Whitehall joined the cast as a relative of Emily Blunt's character. The next month, Édgar Ramírez and Jesse Plemons were cast as villains. Paul Giamatti joined afterwards as a \"crusty harbormaster\". On October 19, 2018, the film was delayed from October 11, 2019 to July 24, 2020. On April 3, 2020, the film was delayed again to July 30, 2021 with the live-action adaptation of \"Mulan\" taking its slot due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n"}

It has three parishes, two urban parishes, one called La Puntilla and the other called Town of Samborondón \"(Cabecera cantonal)\" . There's another rural parish called Tarifa. La Puntilla's parish is one of the most exclusive residential and entertainment districts in Ecuador, boasting many Gated Communities (\"urbanizaciones cerradas\") and several retail developments are located in the suburb. The proximity to the country's largest city, Guayaquil (merely crossing a bridge), allow many of its residents work there. Most of the upper-class families in Guayaquil live at La Puntilla's Parish in Samborondón.\n\nSamborondón was founded on May 24, 1776 and achieve its independence on October 10, 1820. Since October 31, 1955 the suburb has been a canton. The canton has 105 localities and two urban parishes (\"La Puntilla\") and Samborondón Town (Cabecera cantonal) and one rural parish (\"Tarifa\").\n\nThe name Samborondón comes from Saint Brendan, in Spanish San Borondón. The name of the Saint was commonly used in Spain and subsequently in Latin America for towns and villages.\nThe name Samborondón, in general usage, often refers to the rich downtown area of the canton called\n\"La Puntilla\". In fact Samborondón consists of a much larger area than just \"La Puntilla\", which is a peninsula between the rivers Babahoyo and Daule (where the River Guayas is formed).\n\n\"La Puntilla\" is known as the home of many of the rich and powerful of Guayaquil, including banana tycoon and several-time presidential candidate Álvaro Noboa, Ecuador's richest man. But much the canton is in fact rural and poor, and most of its inhabitants live from the cultivation of rice. Nevertheless, the mayor (who himself lives in Guayaquil) has done a lot to improve their situation and his policies are intended to benefit poorer inhabitants of the canton, as well as the richer inhabitants. Several improvements have been made to the area recently.\n\nA new branch of the \"Kennedy Hospital\", a local private hospital chain, was finished in 2007 and is now in use. There are also a few building complexes specially built for medical practices.\n\nThe local shopping center, \"Riocentro Entrerios\" has many retail stores, a hypermarket, a food court and a cinema.\nThe \"Village Plaza\" was inaugurated on August 2010. A hypermarket from the \"Supermaxi\" chain and other 90 stores have been announced.\n\"Bocca\", \"La Piazza\", \"La Torre\", Las Terrazas, Plaza Lagos, Piazza Villa Club and Plaza Navona are smaller shopping centers, mainly around exclusive restaurants, gyms, night clubs and stores.\n\"Tierra Diversión\" is an amusement park for children aged 2–10 and has a capacity of 100 children. They specialize in children's birthday parties and business events for children.\n\"Riverpark\" is an open-air amusement park for children and young people set with a castle theme.\n\nThe\" Parque Histórico\", a botanical garden and zoo of the local fauna and flora with reconstructions of historical buildings, is one of the main tourist attractions of Guayaquil.\n\nSamborondón has a hotel boutique, Orilla del Rio, located in Entrerios. Its close proximity to Guayaquil (5 minutes by car, pedestrian access prohibited on the bridge) makes this unproblematic for the visitor, except on peak hours (7-8 a.m and 4 - 7 p.m.)\n\nSamborondón is also home to the most exclusive night clubs in Greater Guayaquil and also there are three restaurants-complex with luxurious and innovative cuisine, that otherwise are not found in the city.\n\nDue to the increasing growth of the area, many schools have relocated or established branch campuses from Guayaquil and Quito to Samborondón. Most of them are exclusive private schools, among them Colegio Menor, Abdón Calderón, Torremar and Delta (belonging to Opus Dei), Nuevo Mundo, Liceo Panamericano, Moderna Sergio Pérez Valdez, Centro Educativo Naciones Unidas, La Moderna, CREAR and Monte Tabor. The German School Guayaquil inaugurated a second Kindergarten in Samborondón on April 13, 2009. There are 23 public elementary schools in the Canton.\n\nThe first university located in the suburb was the \"Universidad de Especialidades Espíritu Santo\", which opened its doors on 1994. Another university, Ecotec has relocated to the suburb. Since 2000 the ESPOL (\"Technical University of the littoral\") has an annex called PROTCOM in Samborondón, though it only offers 2 courses, leading to a technical associate degree.\n\n\n"}

The company is a distributor of fuel additives. Among other products, Ethyl Corporation distributes tetraethyllead, an additive used to make leaded gasoline.\n\nFounded in 1923, Ethyl Corp was formed by General Motors and Standard Oil of New Jersey (Esso). General Motors had the \"use patent\" for tetraethyllead (TEL) as an antiknock, based on the work of Thomas Midgley, Jr., Charles Kettering, and later Charles Allen Thomas, and Esso had the patent for the manufacture of TEL. Since the patents affected the marketing of TEL, General Motors and ESSO formed Ethyl Corp; each parent company had a 50% stake in the new corporation. Since neither company had chemical plant experience, they hired Dupont to operate the manufacturing facilities. After patents ran out, Dupont started manufacture of TEL on their own, and Ethyl started running its own operations.\n\nWithin the first year of its operation, the company’s plants were plagued by cases of lead poisoning, hallucinations, insanity, and even the deaths of its employees due to exposure to lead. While the company tried to hush the news, at times it was impossible, for example in 1924 when 5 production workers died and 35 more turned into staggering wrecks at one ill-ventilated facility. \n\nTo counter these accusations, Thomas Midgley, Jr. participated in a press conference to demonstrate the apparent safety of TEL on October 30, 1924, in which he poured TEL over his hands, placed a bottle of the chemical under his nose, and inhaled its vapor for 60 seconds, declaring that he could do this every day without succumbing to any problems. In fact, he knew the dangers of lead poisoning, having been made seriously ill from over exposure a few months earlier. \n\nThe State of New Jersey ordered the Baywater plant to be closed a few days later, and Jersey Standard was forbidden to manufacture TEL again without state permission. \n\nIn 1962, Albemarle Paper Manufacturing Company, in Richmond, borrowed $200 million and purchased Ethyl Corporation (Delaware), a corporation 13 times its size. Albemarle then changed its name to Ethyl Corporation. It is believed that General Motors thought to divest itself of \"Ethyl Corporation,\" owing to concern about liabilities of TEL. The 1962 transaction was the largest leveraged buyout until that time.\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, the Ethyl Corporation expanded and diversified in response to the gradual decline of the market for TEL, as the automotive industry shifted to unleaded gasoline due to the US’ Clean Air Act of 1970 and when leaded patrol became in the US in 1986. In the late 1980s, Ethyl began to spin off a number of divisions. The aluminum, plastics, and energy units became Tredegar Corporation in 1989. In 1993, it spun off its life insurance company, First Colony Life, and then in 1994, the specialty chemicals business was spun off as an independent, publicly traded company named Albemarle Corporation.\n\nIn 2004, Ethyl Corporation became a subsidiary of NewMarket Corporation ().\n\nTetraethyllead has been recognized as a contributor to soil, air and water lead pollution, and is toxic to humans. While leaded gasoline made engines more efficient, lead pollution has increased by over 625 times previous levels in the past century due partly to pollution by leaded fuel. Ethyl Corporation historically denied that tetraethyllead poses significant public health risks in excess of those associated with gasoline itself. \n\nTetraethyllead was supplied for blending with raw gasoline in the form of \"Ethyl Fluid\", which blended tetraethyllead with the lead scavengers 1,2-dibromoethane and 1,2-dichloroethane. Ethyl fluid contained a dye which would distinguish treated gasoline from untreated gasoline and discourage the diversion of gasoline for other purposes, such as cleaning.\n\n"}

He was the eldest son of Sir James Audley of Stratton Audley in Oxfordshire.\n\nWhen the order of the Garter was founded, he was initiated as one of its first members and his stall in St. George's Chapel, Windsor was the eleventh on the side of Edward, the Black Prince. He served in France in 1346, where, at Crecy, he fought in the rearguard under Richard Fitzalan, Earl of Arundel. In August 1350 he took part in the naval Battle of Winchelsea. When hostilities were renewed between England and France in 1354 Sir James was in constant attendance upon the Black Prince, and earned a great reputation for valour.\n\nAt the Battle of Poitiers on September 19, 1356 he took his stand in front of the English army, and after fighting for a long time was severely wounded and carried from the fight. After the victory, the prince inquired after Sir James, who was brought to the royal tent, where Edward told him he had been the bravest knight on his side, and granted him an annuity of five hundred marks. Sir James made over this gift to the four esquires who had attended him during the battle, and received from the prince a further pension of six hundred marks. A variation of this story states that, after commending highly his four esquires, and attributing his success mainly to their enterprising spirit, made over to them the donation of five hundred marks. This act of generosity coming to the ear of the prince Edward, and, approving what he had done, confirmed the grant to the esquires, assigning to sir James an annual rent of six hundred marks.\n\nIn 1359 he was one of the leaders of an expedition into France. In 1360 he took the fortress of Chaven in Brittany, as well as the castle of Ferte-sous-Jouarre, and was present at Calais when peace was made between England and France in October 1360. He was afterwards governor of Aquitaine and great seneschal of Poitou, and took part in the capture of the town of La Roche-sur-Yon by Edmund, earl of Cambridge.

{"id": "1846413", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1846413", "title": "Stinger (medicine)", "text": "Stinger (medicine)\n\nIn medicine, a stinger, also called a \"burner\" or \"nerve pinch injury\", is a neurological injury suffered by athletes, mostly in high-contact sports such as ice hockey, rugby, American football, and wrestling. The spine injury is characterized by a shooting or stinging pain that travels down one arm, followed by numbness and weakness in the parts of the arms, including the biceps, deltoid, and spinati muscles. Many athletes in contact sports have suffered stingers, but they are often unreported to medical professionals.\n\nAnyone who experiences significant trauma to his or her head or neck needs immediate medical evaluation for the possibility of a spinal injury. In fact, it's safest to assume that trauma victims have a spinal injury until proven otherwise because:\nThe three main mechanisms of a stinger include receiving direct blows, extension, and compression of the brachial plexus, with most of the brachial plexus injuries being an extension-compression mechanism.\n\nA stinger is an injury that is caused by restriction of the nerve supply to the upper extremity via the brachial plexus. The brachial plexus is formed by the anterior rami of the nerves at the 5th cervical level of the spinal cord all the way to the nerves at the 1st thoracic level of the spinal cord. The brachial plexus innervates the upper extremity as well as some muscles in the neck and shoulder. Damage to the brachial plexus can occur when the nerves are stretched too far from the head and neck; specifically the upper trunk of the plexus –nerve roots at the 5th and 6th cervical level –are primarily affected. The upper trunk provides part of the nerve to supply to the upper extremity via the Musculocutaneous, Axillary, Radial and Median nerves. It is for this reason that stingers do not affect both arms simultaneously, however it is possible for both arms to accrue injuries. Repeated nerve trauma can cause recurring stingers, chronic pain, and muscle weakness, while recovery can take weeks to months in severe cases.\n\nSince stingers are a nerve injury, a stringer can fall into two different categories of peripheral nerve injury with physiological differences. Grade I is neurapraxia, which involves focal damage of the myelin fibers around the axon, with the axon and the connective tissue sheath remaining intact. The disruption of nerve function involves demyelination. Axonal integrity is preserved, and remyelination occurs within days or weeks. Grade II is categorized by axonotmesis which is the most severe case of nerve injury in the context of stingers and involves the injury of the axon. Grade III is classified as neurotmesis where there is a complete disruption of the axon, where it is unlikely of recovery. If this is to happen it is not considered a stringer, and usually is a high-energy injury to the shoulder-girdle.\n\nStingers are best diagnosed by a medical professional. This person will assess the athlete's pain, range of head and neck motion, arm numbness, and muscle strength. Often, the affected athlete is allowed to return to play within a short time, but persistent symptoms will result in removal. Athletes are also advised to receive regular evaluations until symptoms have ceased, specifically, the restoration of pain-free mobility. If they have not after two weeks, or increase, additional tests such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be performed to detect a more serious injury, such as a herniated disc.\n\nThe order of treatments applied depends on whether the athlete's main complaint is pain or weakness. Both can be treated with an analgesic, anti-inflammatory medication, ice and heat, restriction of movement, and if necessary, cervical collar or traction. Surgery is only necessary in the most severe cases.\n\nReturning from this injury depends on the number of burners that occurs. If a stinger occurs, the athletes usually return to play after they restore full strength, are asymptomatic where no pain persists, and painless range of motion in the cervical spine. At low frequencies of stingers, like 1 or 2, there is a much lower risk of the symptoms reoccurring. If three or more stingers occur in one season, one has a higher increased risk at the symptoms persisting.\n\nIf one is returning from play to contact sports it is important to adopt a strict exercise regimen of the neck muscles so the player has the ability to handle the trauma associated with tackles. \n\nStingers can be prevented by several of the following factors, but first, it is crucial to identify the severity of the stinger because treatment usually depends on that factor. If strengthening treatment starts too early with a severe case, it can prevent one from healing. The dysfunctions that caused the peripheral nerve injury must be identified to treat and prevent future injury. \n\nFlexibility and strength of the neck, shoulder, and upper extremity are essential because stiffness and weakness are predisposing factors for a burner as well as consequences of this injury. Factors that could help in the prevention of stringers could include strengthening the muscles, increasing the range of motion, and improving technique when playing.\n\nSimple measures can be taken to help in the recovery from stingers. A chest-out posture should be adapted to prevent the neck from extending too far because it brings the head over the shoulders. The chest-out posture is emphasized due to it not being commonly adopted by athletes due to developed shoulders and is perpetuated by brachial plexus irritation. The chest-out posture also reduces pressure on the brachial plexus by opening the thoracic outlet.\n\nFinally, stingers can be prevented by wearing protective gear, such as butterfly restrictors, designed to protect the head and neck from being forced into unnatural positions. This equipment is more feasible in positions where unrestricted head and neck movement is not required, such as American football lineman, than in positions like quarterback, where such movement is integral. Regardless of equipment, it is important to report even minor symptoms to an athletic trainer or team physician, and to allow appropriate recovery time.\n\nStingers commonly occur in contact sports like wrestling, hockey, basketball, boxing, rugby, weightlifting, and, most notably, football. One study found that up to 65% of college football players have suffered at least one stringer. However, it is difficult to ping an exact number of athletes that suffer from stringers as stringers are historically under-reported. This could be due to the players fear of being removed from play or the injury being viewed as unimportant.\n\nThe following study found different frequencies in the number of stingers that occur. Incidence of stingers over a six-year study period with only 1.5 stingers per team each season. Most of the stingers reported were either during competitions or preseason. Exactly 93% of stringers were due to player contact, specifically 36.7% occurring while tackling and 25.8% occurring while blocking.\n\nIn 1976 most major American football leagues banned the technique of spearing in the sport due to the risk of injury. When a player makes head-down contact, that player has much more of a chance of a significant spinal cord injury. After the initial rule change, many of the cervical spine injuries stopped. Therefore, this prompted a new tackling technique to be adopted, such as the head-up tackling technique. This technique does prevent catastrophic spine injuries, but it can result in brachial plexus injuries. After the rule change, it has been estimated that stringers have gone up in prevalence.\n\n"}

Political struggles were common between different factions of the scholar-officials. Purges frequently resulted in leading political figures being sent into exile or condemned to death.\n\nThe political system of this period was dominated by a Confucianist bureaucracy. The government officials were ranked in 18 levels, ranging from senior first rank (jeong-il-pum, Hangul: 정1품, Hanja: 正一品) down to junior ninth rank (jong-gu-pum, 종9품, 從九品) based on seniority and promotion, which was achieved through the royal decree based on examinations and recommendations.\n\nThe power of the bureaucrats often eclipsed that of the central authorities, including the monarch. For much of the dynasty, a complex system of checks and balances prevented any one section of the government from gaining overwhelming power until the 19th century when political power became concentrated in a certain family or individual.\n\nThe king ruled for life, unlike any of his appointees. The kings of Joseon were all of the Jeonju Yi clan and notionally descended from Taejo, although some were adopted. For a list of Joseon kings, see List of Korean monarchs. Under Confucian philosophy, the king commanded absolute loyalty from his officials and subjects, but the officials were also expected to try to guide the king to the right path if the latter was mistaken. Natural disasters were thought to be due to the king's failings, and therefore, Joseon kings were very sensitive to their occurrences.\n\nIn order to serve in the positions of responsibility outside the military in Joseon Dynasty, one had to take a series of gwageo literary examinations and pass each of them (usually four to five times). Theoretically, any male other than cheonmin (lowest class) and children of concubines could take gwageo examinations to enter a civil service and thus become yangban (nobility class). In actuality, only the yangban class had the luxury of time and money as well as the necessary connections to pass gwageo exams. In addition, people from the troublesome northern provinces of Hamgyeong and Pyeongan were barred from office for much of the dynasty.\n\nOfficials served in positions for fixed terms, varying from one year to five years. A successful official might serve in tens of positions in the course of a career.\n\nState Council (Uijeongbu, Hangul: 의정부, Hanja: 議政府) was the highest deliberative body of the Joseon Dynasty although it faded in importance after first centuries of rule. It was composed of twelve officials. The Chief State Councillor (Yeonguijeong, 영의정, 領議政), Left State Councillor (Jwauijeong, 좌의정), and Right State Councillor (Uuijeong, 우의정) were the highest-ranking officials in the government (senior first rank). They were assisted by Left Minister (Jwachanseong, 좌찬성) and Right Minister (Uichangseong, 우찬성), both of junior first rank, and seven lower ranking officials. The power of State Council was inversely proportional to the king's power. Sometimes it directly controlled Six Ministries, the chief executive body of Joseon government, but primarily served in advisory role under stronger kings. State councillors served in several other positions including a tutor to the crown prince.\n\nThe Six Ministries (Yukjo, Hangul: 육조, Hanja: 六曹) were the chief executive body of Joseon. Each Minister (Panseo, 판서) was of senior second rank (2a, third highest rank) and was assisted by a Deputy-Minister (Champan, 참판) of junior second rank (2b, fourth highest rank) and a Secretary (Chamui, 참의) of rank 3a. Apart from these three Dangsanggwan (당상관, 堂上官) officials, each Ministry was headed by three Jeongrang (정랑, rank 5a) and three Jwarang (좌랑, rank 6a), adding to nine officials ranked 6a or above.\n\n\nThree Offices (Samsa, Hangul: 삼사, Hanja: 三司) is a collective name for three offices that provided checks and balance on the king and the officials. The officials who served in these offices tended to be younger and of lower rank compared to other offices but enjoyed special privileges and prestige. They went through more thorough review of moral character and family background. \n\nThe Samsa provided a key check on the powers of the other branches of government. The Inspector-General and Censor-General had the unique power to vet potential appointees for all positions, and examine their family backgrounds. They thus played a role in maintaining the integrity of the yangban aristocracy.\n\n\nThe ranked officials were sent from the central government. Sometimes a secret royal inspector (Amhaeng-eosa, 암행어사) was sent to travel incognito and monitor the provincial officials. Secret inspectors were generally young officials of lower rank but invested with royal authority to dismiss corrupt officials.\n\n\nEach county and hyeon was overseen by a local magistrate appointed by the central government. The yangban of each county (\"gun\") composed a Local Office. This interacted with local officials, typically of a lower class, who were known as \"hyangni\". The \"hyangni\" typically served for life in hereditary posts. The \"hyangni\" of each county had an ambassador in the capital who was charged with communicating among them and the central government .\n\nThroughout the dynasty, various regional and ideological factions struggled for dominance in the political system. In the earliest years of Joseon, tension between the capital faction and the Yeongnam-based Sarim faction dominated national politics. The different Seowon across the country, which combined the functions of Confucian shrines with educational institutions, often reflected the factional alignment of the local elite. In the 16th century, a nationwide split occurred between the Easterners (\"Dongin\") and Westerners (\"Seoin\"), and within decades the Easterners eventually split into the Northerners (\"Bukin\") and the more moderate Southerners (\"Namin\") In the seventeenth century, the Westerners too divided into the Patriarchs (\"Noron\") and the Disciples (\"Soron\").\n\nUnder the reigns of Yeongjo and Jeongjo in the 18th century, the kings generally pursued the *tangpyeongchaek*, a policy of balance favoring no faction over another. In Jeongjo's reign, strife emerged between the Intransigents (\"Byeokpa\") and the Expedients (\"Shipa\"), two groups which cut across the earlier factions and differed in their attitudes concerning certain royal policies; the Intransigents were more opposed to the king and largely composed of Patriarchs. In the 19th century, Joseon politics shifted as in-law families (called \"cheokga\") rather than scholarly factions came to dominate the throne. For most of the 19th century, the Jangdong branch of the Andong Kim clan was in control of the government; however, there was a brief interlude in which control shifted to the Pungyang Cho clan.\n\nDuring the reign of Gojong, real power initially belonged to his father the Heungseon Daewongun, who on one hand sought to reform corrupt state institutions but on the other hand pursued a policy of isolationism, opposing the opening of the country to Western and Japanese influences. From the 1870s onwards, Queen Min (known posthumously as Empress Myeongseong) became more dominant and pursued a policy of cautious modernisation and opening up. Her dominance was opposed by reactionaries and progressives alike. The Enlightenment Party (also known as Progressives) sought to modernise the country along Western and Japanese lines. Even amongst the modernisers factions emerged, with one faction favouring the Russian Empire and a second favouring the Japanese Empire, initially the influence of the Russians was strongest but waned with their defeat to Japan in the Russo-Japanese War. These factional struggles led to the Imo Incident and Gapsin Coup, as well as increased foreign interference in Korean affairs.\n\nPurges in Joseon Dynasty were often violent, leading to the execution and internal exile of many members of the losing side. In some cases, even the graves of their ancestors were desecrated. Purges were especially widespread during Sukjong's reign, when there was change of faction in power four times, each time accompanied by cycle of revenge for earlier wrongdoings.\n\nThe most famous rebellions took place in the 19th century, as the social system of Joseon was beginning to collapse: the rebellion of Hong Gyeong-nae in the northern provinces in 1811, the Imo Incident of 1882, and the Donghak uprising of 1894–1895.\n\nOccasional rebellions also took place among the country's small ethnic minorities. The Tungusic tribes of the northeast rose in 1583 under Nitanggae and seized a number of towns; they were put down by the general Shin Rip. Thereafter markets were established in the region to help supply the tribesmen with needed goods. In 1510, Japanese merchants and settlers had risen in rebellion against a local commander; this was followed by the expulsion of all Japanese and the closure of the ports for two years. After the Seven Year War, Japanese access to the country was sharply constrained, and such incidents ceased to occur.\n\nJoseon's international relations implemented Korean Neo-Confucian ideal of \"serving the great\" (\"sadae\") to Chinese Ming dynasty and later Manchu Qing dynasty.\n\nOn a lower level, the country maintained ties with various neighboring nations, including the Jurchen tribes of the north and the Japanese and Ryūkyū states across the sea. To this end, interpreting schools were set up in the capital and in border towns such as Jeju and Busan.\n\nThe Joseon Dynasty endured two major invasions prior its progressive loss of sovereignty in the late 19th century. These were the Seven Year War, a two-stage Japanese invasion led by Toyotomi Hideyoshi in the 1590s, and the First and Second Manchu invasions in the early 17th century. Although the Japanese were ultimately repelled, Joseon was compelled to surrender to the Manchus, who later became the Qing Dynasty.\n\nAfter the Treaty of Ganghwa and the opening of the ports in 1876, the diplomatic approach changed, and the government of Joseon began to enter into diplomatic relations with both neighboring and European countries.\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> Unequal treaty\n\n"}

{"id": "1846451", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1846451", "title": "Dopamine transporter", "text": "Dopamine transporter\n\nThe dopamine transporter (also dopamine active transporter, DAT, SLC6A3) is a membrane-spanning protein that pumps the neurotransmitter dopamine out of the synaptic cleft back into cytosol. In the cytosol, other transporters sequester the dopamine into vesicles for storage and later release. Dopamine reuptake via DAT provides the primary mechanism through which dopamine is cleared from synapses, although there may be an exception in the prefrontal cortex, where evidence points to a possibly larger role of the norepinephrine transporter.\nDAT is implicated in a number of dopamine-related disorders, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, clinical depression, alcoholism, and substance use disorder. The gene that encodes the DAT protein is located on human chromosome 5, consists of 15 coding exons, and is roughly 64 kbp long. Evidence for the associations between DAT and dopamine related disorders has come from a type of genetic polymorphism, known as a VNTR, in the DAT gene (DAT1), which influences the amount of protein expressed.\n\nDAT is an integral membrane protein that removes dopamine from the synaptic cleft and deposits it into surrounding cells, thus terminating the signal of the neurotransmitter. Dopamine underlies several aspects of cognition, including reward, and DAT facilitates regulation of that signal.\n\nDAT is a symporter that moves dopamine across the cell membrane by coupling the movement to the energetically-favorable movement of sodium ions moving from high to low concentration into the cell. DAT function requires the sequential binding and co-transport of two Na ions and one Cl ion with the dopamine substrate. The driving force for DAT-mediated dopamine reuptake is the ion concentration gradient generated by the plasma membrane Na/K ATPase.\n\nIn the most widely accepted model for monoamine transporter function, sodium ions must bind to the extracellular domain of the transporter before dopamine can bind. Once dopamine binds, the protein undergoes a conformational change, which allows both sodium and dopamine to unbind on the intracellular side of the membrane.\n\nStudies using electrophysiology and radioactive-labeled dopamine have confirmed that the dopamine transporter is similar to other monoamine transporters in that one molecule of neurotransmitter can be transported across the membrane with one or two sodium ions. Chloride ions are also needed to prevent a buildup of positive charge. These studies have also shown that transport rate and direction is totally dependent on the sodium gradient.\n\nBecause of the tight coupling of the membrane potential and the sodium gradient, activity-induced changes in membrane polarity can dramatically influence transport rates. In addition, the transporter may contribute to dopamine release when the neuron depolarizes.\n\nPreliminary evidence suggests that the dopamine transporter couples to L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (particularly Ca1.2 and Ca1.3), which are expressed in virtually all dopamine neurons. As a result of DAT–Ca coupling, DAT substrates that produce depolarizing currents through the transporter are able to open calcium channels that are coupled to the transporter, resulting in a calcium influx in dopamine neurons. This calcium influx is believed to induce CAMKII-mediated phosphorylation of the dopamine transporter as a downstream effect; since DAT phosphorylation by CAMKII results in dopamine efflux in vivo, activation of transporter-coupled calcium channels is a potential mechanism by which certain drugs (e.g., amphetamine) trigger neurotransmitter release.\n\nThe initial determination of the membrane topology of DAT was based upon hydrophobic sequence analysis and sequence similarities with the GABA transporter. These methods predicted twelve transmembrane domains (TMD) with a large extracellular loop between the third and fourth TMDs. Further characterization of this protein used proteases, which digest proteins into smaller fragments, and glycosylation, which occurs only on extracellular loops, and largely verified the initial predictions of membrane topology. The exact structure of the Drosophila melanogaster dopamine transporter (dDAT) was elucidated in 2013 by X-ray crystallography.\n\nRegional distribution of DAT has been found in areas of the brain with established dopaminergic circuitry including: nigrostriatal, mesolimbic, and mesocortical pathways. The nuclei that make up these pathways have distinct patterns of expression. Gene expression patterns in the adult mouse show high expression in the substantia nigra pars compacta.\n\nDAT in the mesocortical pathway, labeled with radioactive antibodies, was found to be enriched in dendrites and cell bodies of neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta and ventral tegmental area. This pattern makes sense for a protein that regulates dopamine levels in the synapse.\n\nStaining in the striatum and nucleus accumbens of the mesolimbic pathway was dense and heterogeneous. In the striatum, DAT is localized in the plasma membrane of axon terminals. Double immunocytochemistry demonstrated DAT colocalization with two other markers of nigrostriatal terminals, tyrosine hydroxylase and D2 dopamine receptors. The latter was thus demonstrated to be an autoreceptor on cells that release dopamine. TAAR1 is a presynaptic intracellular receptor that is also colocalized with DAT and which has the opposite effect of the D2 autoreceptor when activated; i.e., it internalizes dopamine transporters and induces efflux through reversed transporter function via PKA and PKC signaling.\n\nSurprisingly, DAT was not identified within any synaptic active zones. These results suggest that striatal dopamine reuptake may occur outside of synaptic specializations once dopamine diffuses from the synaptic cleft.\n\nIn the substantia nigra, DAT is localized to axonal and dendritic (i.e., pre- and post-synaptic) plasma membranes.\n\nWithin the perikarya of pars compacta neurons, DAT was localized primarily to rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi complex, and multivesicular bodies, identifying probable sites of synthesis, modification, transport, and degradation.\n\nThe gene for DAT, known as DAT1, is located on chromosome 5p15. \nThe protein encoding region of the gene is over 64 kb long and comprises 15 coding segments or exons. \nThis gene has a variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) at the 3’ end (rs28363170) and another in the intron 8 region. Differences in the VNTR have been shown to affect the basal level of expression of the transporter; consequently, researchers have looked for associations with dopamine related disorders.\n\nNurr1, a nuclear receptor that regulates many dopamine related genes, can bind the promoter region of this gene and induce expression. This promoter may also be the target of the transcription factor Sp-1.\n\nWhile transcription factors control which cells express DAT, functional regulation of this protein is largely accomplished by kinases. MAPK, CAMKII, PKA, and PKC can modulate the rate at which the transporter moves dopamine or cause the internalization of DAT. Co-localized TAAR1 is an important regulator of the dopamine transporter that, when activated, phosphorylates DAT through protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) signaling. Phosphorylation by either protein kinase can result in DAT internalization ( reuptake inhibition), but phosphorylation alone induces reverse transporter function (dopamine efflux). Dopamine autoreceptors also regulate DAT by directly opposing the effect of TAAR1 activation.\n\nThe human dopamine transporter (hDAT) contains a high affinity extracellular zinc binding site which, upon zinc binding, inhibits dopamine reuptake and amplifies amphetamine-induced dopamine efflux \"in vitro\". In contrast, the human serotonin transporter (hSERT) and human norepinephrine transporter (hNET) do not contain zinc binding sites. Zinc supplementation may reduce the minimum effective dose of amphetamine when it is used for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.\n\nThe rate at which DAT removes dopamine from the synapse can have a profound effect on the amount of dopamine in the cell. This is best evidenced by the severe cognitive deficits, motor abnormalities, and hyperactivity of mice with no dopamine transporters. These characteristics have striking similarities to the symptoms of ADHD.\n\nDifferences in the functional VNTR have been identified as risk factors for bipolar disorder and ADHD. Data has emerged that suggests there is also an association with stronger withdrawal symptoms from alcoholism, although this is a point of controversy. An allele of the DAT gene with normal protein levels is associated with non-smoking behavior and ease of quitting. Additionally, male adolescents particularly those in high-risk families (ones marked by a disengaged mother and absence of maternal affection) who carry the 10-allele VNTR repeat show a statistically significant affinity for antisocial peers.\n\nIncreased activity of DAT is associated with several different disorders, including clinical depression.\n\nMutations in DAT have been shown to cause dopamine transporter deficiency syndrome, an autosomal recessive movement disorder characterized by progressively worsening dystonia and parkinsonism.\n\nThe dopamine transporter is the target of substrates, dopamine releasers, transport inhibitors and allosteric modulators.\n\nCocaine blocks DAT by binding directly to the transporter and reducing the rate of transport. In contrast, amphetamine enters the presynaptic neuron directly through the neuronal membrane or through DAT, competing for reuptake with dopamine. Once inside, it binds to or enters synaptic vesicles through . When amphetamine binds to TAAR1, it reduces the firing rate of the postsynaptic neuron and triggers protein kinase A and protein kinase C signaling, resulting in DAT phosphorylation. Phosphorylated DAT then either operates in reverse or withdraws into the presynaptic neuron and ceases transport. When amphetamine enters the synaptic vesicles through VMAT2, dopamine is released into the cytosol. Amphetamine also produces dopamine efflux through a second TAAR1-independent mechanism involving CAMKIIα-mediated phosphorylation of the transporter, which putatively arises from the activation of DAT-coupled L-type calcium channels by amphetamine.\n\nThe dopaminergic mechanisms of each drug are believed to underlie the pleasurable feelings elicited by these substances.\n\nDopamine transporter has been shown to interact with:\n\nApart from these innate protein-protein interactions, recent studies demonstrated that viral proteins such as HIV-1 Tat protein interacts with the DAT and this binding may alter the dopamine homeostasis in HIV positive individuals which is a contributing factor for the HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders.\n\n"}

However, to prevent her mistress, Aravis Tarkheena, from committing suicide (to escape an arranged marriage), Hwin has revealed her true nature to Aravis, and has persuaded Aravis to flee with her to freedom in Narnia instead. In \"The Horse and his Boy\", (the events of which all occur during the reign of the four Pevensie children in Narnia, an era which begins and ends in the last chapter of \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\"), Hwin and Aravis fall into company with the talking stallion, Bree, to whom Hwin is distantly related, and the boy Shasta. In the course of their adventures, the companions thwart an attempted invasion of Archenland and Narnia, and Hwin, nervous, gentle and humble by nature, passes through testing grounds in which courage and the ability to lead are developed in her.\n\nHwin's name brings to mind the word \"whinny\", a sound that horses make. Primarily, \"Hwin\" is a contraction of \"Hwinhynym\", which, spelled \"Houyhnhnm\" is the name of the race of noble horses from Jonathan Swift's \"Gulliver's Travels\".\n\nHwin was born in Narnia, but was captured as a foal and sold into slavery in Calormen. She became the property of Aravis Tarkeena, a member of the ruling class in Calormen. During her years in slavery, Hwin did not speak, in order to hide her Narnian origin. However, not long before the appearance of Hwin and Aravis in \"The Horse and His Boy\", Hwin has revealed her nature as a talking horse to Aravis, while intervening to prevent Aravis from killing herself to avoid an arranged marriage. Hwin has persuaded Aravis that they should escape together to the free land of Narnia.\n\nIn this chapter, Hwin and Aravis make their first appearance in the story, driven together with Bree and Shasta by roaring lions. Hwin looks up to Bree as \"a noble war horse\", and prefers to accept his \"assistance and protection\" on their journey. Although Aravis is the acknowledged leader of the Aravis-Hwin pair, Hwin defends her right to compare escape stories with Bree: \"No, I won't [be silent], Aravis. This is my escape just as much as yours.\" Hwin and Bree discover that they know the same places in Narnia, and that they are possibly distantly related.\n\nHwin also plays a vital role in their escape through Tashbaan, but her plan of disguising themselves fails when King Edmund of Narnia mistakes Shasta for Prince Corin of Archenland and Aravis is recognised by a friend. Eventually, the group reunite and head to Archenland.\n\nHwin remains friends with Bree, Shasta (who is later revealed to be Prince Cor of Archenland, Prince Corin's long-lost twin) and Aravis throughout her life, and it is mentioned that she later marries (though not to Bree).\n\nHwin's logical thinking and humility serve as the counter to Bree.\n\nHwin is generally very clear-thinking and reasonable, and though she seems a bit shy at times, her advice is usually the smartest of the group's; it is she, for example, who devises the best plan for getting through Tashbaan (though it doesn't work well for reasons beyond their control). Her wisdom is to be compared to Bree, who is somewhat less sensible and not quite as wise. He also seems to be more concerned than her with what others would think of him—for example, that the other Talking Horses might think his rolling in the grass is silly, while she replies she enjoys it and doesn't care what others think.\n"}

Population: \n\nIt was founded in 1891. Between 1891 and 1925 it was called Shikhrany ().\n\nThe town's history is closely linked to the development of the railway. The Moscow–Kazan line was completed, except for the Imperatorsky Romanovsky railway bridge across Volga, in December 1884 by private Moscow Ryazan Railway Company which was renamed to Moscow Kazan Railway Company on July 11, 1891, which provided all train service in the area up to 1918, when all the remaining private railways were nationalized by the Bolsheviks.\n\nThe opening of the station, which was then surrounded by woodland, provided a convenient production point for the timber industry, and windmills were built in the area. In 1911, there were more than forty trading firms in Shikhrany. In 1912, a primary school was opened, and in 1914—a middle school. In 1919, Shikhrany station became a railway junction, when the Arzamas–Shikhrany line, which had been under construction from 1914, when the last section was completed from the Tsarkli River bridge to Shihrany, and opened to full traffic. The line had been in restricted use with limited car loads since summer 1917.\n\nBy 1925, when Kanash was granted town status, its population was approximately 2,200.\n\nAnother station was built in 1926 for goods transit. The first power station, which supplied electricity to the railway station, portions of the town, and thirteen nearby villages, was constructed in 1929.\n\nConstruction of the Kanash–Cheboksary line began in 1939, bringing the number of lines connecting Kanash up to four.\n\nDuring World War II, railway production facilities and transit capacity were substantially increased.\n\nFrom the 1950s to the 1970s, local industry was diversified. Factories producing furniture, tools, polymers, and plastics, and car repair factories were built.\n\nWithin the framework of administrative divisions, Kanash serves as the administrative center of Kanashsky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as the town of republic significance of Kanash—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts.

{"id": "1846551", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1846551", "title": "Kheer", "text": "Kheer\n\nKheer or Payasam is a type of pudding from the Indian subcontinent, made by boiling milk and sugar with one of the following: rice, broken wheat, millet, tapioca, vermicelli, or sweet corn. It is flavoured with desiccated coconut, cardamom, raisins, saffron, cashews, pistachios, almonds or other dry fruits and nuts. It is typically served during a meal or as a dessert.\n\nThe word 'Kheer' is derived from the Sanskrit word for milk, \"Ksheer\"(क्षीर). Ksheer is also the archaic name for sweet rice pudding.\n\nKheer was a part of the ancient Indian diet and is mentioned in the \"Ayurveda\".\n\nAccording to the food historian K. T. Achaya, kheer or \"payas\", as it is known in southern India, was a popular dish in ancient India, first mentioned in ancient Indian literature, it was a mixture of rice, milk and sugar, a formula that has endured for over two thousand years. Payas was also a staple Hindu temple food, in particular, it was associated with Lord Shiva and served as \"Prasāda\" to his devotees.\n\nPayasam was always the main sweet dish at Hindu temples and part of their celebrations. It was mainly served in sadhya in marriage functions of Nair community. Other terms like \"Payasam\" or \"payesh\" (used in the Bengal region) are derived from the Sanskrit word \"Payasa\" or \"Payasam\", which also means \"milk\". It is prepared using milk, rice, ghee, sugar/jaggery, and \"khoya\" but is less thick than original kheer. Some also add a little bit of heavy cream for a richer taste. It is often garnished using almonds, cashews, raisins and pistachios. There is one more popular version of North Indian kheer, prepared during festivals and havan in Varanasi by using only milk, rice, ghee, sugar, cardamom, dried fruit, and \"kesar\" (saffron milk). It is an essential dish in many Hindu feasts and celebrations. While the dish is most often made with rice, it can also be made with other ingredients, such as vermicelli (\"semiya\" in South India, \"seviyan\", \"seviyaan\", \"sayviah\", or other spellings) or tapioca (locally known as sabudana). In Kashmir, firni is made with semolina (\"suji)\", milk, saffron, sugar, dry fruits, etc.\n\nIn Gujarat, a variation of kheer known as \"dūdpāk\", દૂધપાક, is also made. The ingredients remain largely the same, but the cooking process is different and wdudhpak is less dense and thick than kheer.\n\nRice was known to the Romans, and possibly introduced to Europe as a food crop, dating as early as the 8th or 10th Century AD, and so the recipe for the popular English rice pudding is believed by some to be descended from kheer. Similar rice recipes (originally called \"potages\") go back to some of the earliest written recipes in English history.\n\nThe Odia version of rice kheer (known as Kheeri) and (Payas in Northern Odisha) likely originated in the city of Puri, in Odisha more than 2,000 years ago. Although original Kheer Payas originated as two separate dishes, they are increasingly considered by some to be similar but it is not. The Odia version has more fruits and is little less thicker. Payas are cooked to this day within the temple precincts there wheres as Kheer is available in restaurants mostly during Ramadan. Every single day, hundreds of temple cooks work around 752 hearths in what is supposed to be the world's largest kitchen to cook over 100 different dishes, including kheer, enough to feed at least 10,000 people.\n\nPayas is also regarded as an auspicious food and generally associated with annaprashana (weaning ritual of an infant), as well as other festivals and birthday celebrations in an Odia household.\n\nAlthough white sugar is commonly used, adding \"Gurh\" (jaggery) as a sweetener, is a variation prepared in Bengal and Odisha, especially during winter and spring when fresh gurh is available.\n\nIn Bengal, it is called \"payas\" or \"payesh\". A traditional Bengali meal can be traced 2000 years old and it is one of important sweet dishes payas followed by other sweets.\n\nPayesh is also regarded as an auspicious food and generally associated with annaprashana (weaning ritual of an infant) and Janmatithi (birthday) in a Bengali household. Payesh is made with rice (preferably gobindobhog rice), milk, and \"guur\" (jaggery/molasses) or sugar, often with raisins, cashew nuts, and cardamom as well. The people of West Bengal and Bangladesh prepare \"payesh\" variously with \"gurh\", ketaki, glutinous rice (usually gobindobhog rice), vermicelli, semolina and coconut milk, and the result is a stickier and creamier dessert. Bengali \"kheer\" (which is different to payesh and is not to be confused with the Hindi word \"kheer\") does not have rice, and is made by prolonged boiling of milk with either sugar or \"gurh\" till the milk fat solidifies as thick flakes (heating it even longer would make rabri).\n\nIn Assam, it is called \"payoxh\" and in addition to other dried fruits, cherries are added to give it a light delicate pink colour. Sometimes rice may be replaced with sago. It is one of the most significant desserts served in Assamese families and quite often a part of religious ceremonies.\n\nIn Bihar, it is called \"Chawal ki Kheer\". It is made with rice, full fat cream, milk, sugar, cardamom powder, an assortment of dried fruits, and saffron. Another version of this kheer, called Rasiya, is made with jaggery. Jaggery is used instead of sugar in the process. The jaggery version looks brown in color and has a mild, sweet taste.\n\nThe South Indian version, \"payasam\" (Tamil: பாயசம், Malayalam: പായസം, Telugu: పాయసం, Kannada: ಪಾಯಸ), is an integral part of traditional South Indian meals. South Indian payasam also makes extensive use of jaggery (Tamil: வெல்லம் \"vellam\", Telugu: బెల్లం \"bellam\", Kannada: ಬೆಲ್ಲ \"bella\", Malayalam: ശർക്കര \"sharkkara\") and coconut milk in place of sugar and milk. Vermicelli (\"semiya\") is commonly used. The most common types of payasam in South India include milk payasam,sago/tapioca pearl payasam, Semiya (vermicelli) payasam, Paruppu payasam, Nei (clarified butter) payasam (also known as Aravana payasam), Carrot payasam, Wheat payasam, Wheat rava (wheat semolina) payasam, and Arisi Thengai (coconut and rice) payasam, which is a traditional Iyengar-style recipe. It is not exactly Kheer, since most of the process is same it is generalised as Kheer. Payasam is less thicker and it contains semiya/vermicelli which is not a content of original Kheer.\n\nIn a South Indian meal, payasam or payasa, is served first at any formal or auspicious occasion. Payasam is also served after rasam rice, while rice with buttermilk forms the last item of the meal. Payasam also forms an integral part of the Kerala feast (sadya), where it is served and relished from the flat banana leaf instead of cups. In Malayalee or Kerala cuisine, there are several different kinds of payasam that can be prepared from a wide variety of fruits and starch bases, an example being \"chakkapradhaman\" made from jackfruit pulp and \"adapradhaman\" made from flat ground rice.\n\nThe Hyderabadi version is called \"gil-e-firdaus\". It is a thick kheer made with milk and bottle gourd. \"Gil-e-firdaus\", literally translated, means \"the clay of paradise\".\n\nKarnataka has different types of Payasa (ಪಾಯಸ),they maybe prepared with milk or coconut milk. \n1. ಗಸಗಸೆ ಪಾಯಸ/gasa-gase payasa - payasa made with poppy seeds, coconut, jaggery, sometimes almonds are added too. This is also used to make ಅಪ್ಪೆ ಪಾಯಸ/ appey payasa ie poori with payasa.\n2. ಅಕ್ಕಿ ಪಾಯಸ/akki payasa- made with rice, milk and jaggery \n3. ಶಾವಿಗೆ ಪಾಯಸ/shavige payasa- vermicelli added to akki payasa or gasagase payasa \n4. ಹೆಸರು ಪಾಯಸ/hesaru payasa- made with green gram pulses or moong dal, jaggery and coconut milk\n5. ಗೋಧಿ ಹುಗ್ಗಿ/ godhi huggi - made with broken wheat, jaggery and coconut milk \n6. ಎಳನೀರು ಪಾಯಸ/ ela-neeru payasa- coastal dish made of tender coconut\n\nAcross the Subcontinent, \"Payasam/Paisam\" is prepared and eaten at festivals. It is offered to Hindu deities as a \"bhog\" or \"prasadam\". Since it is watery and contains vermicelli, it is tight to call it Payasam/Paisam but not Kheer.\n\nAmong the Muslims of the Indian subcontinent, the dish is mainly consumed during Ramadan and prepared for the feasts of Muslim weddings and festivals, such as Eid ul-Fitr and Eid ul-Adha.\n\nA similar dessert, known as \"firni\", is eaten in \nIran, Azerbaijan, Afghanistan and among the Muslim communities of India, Bangladesh and Pakistan. Today, restaurants offer \"firni\" in a wide range of flavours, similar to kheer. Firni uses ground rice rather than whole rice.\n\n"}

She wrote poems, short stories and radio plays, and won multiple European literary prizes.\n\nAichinger was born in 1921 in Vienna, along with her twin sister, , to Berta, a doctor of Jewish ethnicity, and Ludwig, a teacher. As her mother's family was assimilated, the children were raised Catholic. Aichinger spent her childhood in Linz and, after her parents divorced, she moved to Vienna with her mother and sister, attending a Catholic secondary school. After the Anschluss in 1938, her family was subjected to Nazi persecution. As a half Jew she was not allowed to continue her studies and became a slave labourer in a button factory. Her sister Helga escaped from Nazism in July 1939 through a Kindertransport to England where she eventually gave birth to a daughter, who became English artist Ruth Rix. During World War II, Aichinger was able to hide her mother in her assigned room, in front of the Hotel Metropol, the Viennese Gestapo headquarters. But many relatives from her mother's side, among them her grandmother Gisela, whom she was particularly fond of, were sent to the Maly Trostenets extermination camp near Minsk, and murdered.\n\nIn 1945, Aichinger began to study medicine at the University of Vienna, while writing in her spare time. In her first publication, \"\" (\"The Fourth Gate\"), she wrote about her experience under Nazism. In 1947 she and her mother Berta were able to travel to London and visit Aichinger's twin Helga and her daughter Ruth. The visit was the inspiration for a short story, \"Dover\".\n\nShe gave up her studies in 1948 in order to finish her novel, \"\" (\"The greater hope\", translated as \"Herod's Children\"). The book went on to become one of the top German-language novels of the twentieth century. It is a surrealist account of a child's persecution by the Nazis in Vienna.\n\nIn 1949, Aichinger wrote the short story \"Spiegelgeschichte\" (). It was published in four parts in an Austrian newspaper, and is well known in Austria because it is part of the set of books taught in schools. The story is written backwards, beginning with the end of the biography of the unnamed woman, and ending with her early childhood.\n\nIn 1949, Aichinger became a reader for publishing houses in Vienna and Frankfurt, and worked with Inge Scholl to found an Institute of Creative Writing in Ulm, Germany.\n\nIn 1951, Aichinger was invited to join the writers' group Gruppe 47, a group which aimed to spread democratic ideas in post-war Austria. She read her story \"Spiegelgeschichte\" aloud at a meeting of the group, and leading group members such as Hans Werner Richter were impressed with the unusual narrative construction. The following year, she won the group's prize for best text, becoming the first female recipient. In 1956, she joined the Academy of Arts, Berlin. She was also a guest lecturer at the German Institute at the University of Vienna, teaching on literature and psychoanalysis.\n\nReviewing a 1957 volume of her short works in translation, \"The Bound Man and Other Stories\", Anthony Boucher describes Aichinger as \"a sort of concise Kafka,\" praising the title story, \"\" (\"The Bound Man\"), for its \"narrative use of multi-valued symbolism\", The similarity to Kafka's work has been frequently commented on, however other critics state that Aichinger's work goes beyond Kafka's in her emphasis on the emotional side of human suffering.\n\nAfter the death of her husband, the German poet Günter Eich, in 1972, Aichinger and others edited his works and published them as \"Collected Works of Gunter Eich.\" In 1996, at the age of 75, she was the host of a German radio series \"Studio LCB\" for the Literary Colloquium Berlin.\n\nAichinger died on 11 November 2016, aged 95.\n\nAichinger met the poet and radio play author Günter Eich through the Group 47 and they were married in 1953; they had a son (1954–1998), and in 1958 a daughter, Mirjam.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1846570", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1846570", "title": "Jean Loring", "text": "Jean Loring\n\nJean Loring is a fictional character in comic books published by DC Comics, formerly associated with superhero the Atom for whom she was a supporting character and primary love interest. She first appeared in \"Showcase\" #34 (October 1961), created by writer Gardner Fox and artist Gil Kane. The character appeared continually in minor roles until the 2004 storyline \"Identity Crisis\", in which she suffered a mental breakdown and responsible for the deaths of Sue Dibny, wife of the Elongated Man, and Jack Drake, father of the third Robin (Tim Drake). This would later lead Loring to assume the mantle of the supervillain Eclipso.\n\nJean Loring was a recurring character portraying Oliver Queen and his family’s lawyer on the television series \"Arrow\" played by Teryl Rothery.\n\nJean Loring's career as an attorney in Ivy Town began at almost the same time that her boyfriend, Ray Palmer, became the Atom. Jean encountered the Atom who often helped in her cases many times before learning that he and Ray were the same person. Ray proposed to Jean often, but she rejected him, wanting to make it as a lawyer before becoming a wife. Only when Ray was thought killed in a car accident (engineered by the Bug-Eyed Bandit) did she accept his proposal.\n\nIn \"Atom and Hawkman\" #45 (November 1969), Jean was abducted and driven insane by the sub-atomic Jimberen race. Although quickly freed from the Jimberen by the Atom and Hawkman, Jean remained insane until \"Justice League of America\" #81 (June 1970), when she was cured by the equally insane alien the Jest-Master.\n\nAfter Jean was kidnapped by T. O. Morrow, Ray went into an interdimensional search to retrieve her, asking for help from the Flash, Supergirl, Wonder Woman, Aquaman and Captain Comet. This event direly affected Jean, and also led to the end of their marriage. For a few years, they were happy – but Ray’s adventurous life began taking its toll on their marriage. Ray caught Jean having an affair with another man and they divorced.\n\nDespite the occasional high-profile case, notably her defense of the Justice League of America in \"Justice League of America\" (vol. 1) #19 and #77, Jean did not truly come to national prominence until the divorce. Jean soon remarried and with her new husband, Paul Hoben, opened up a law office in Calvin City. She eventually returned to Ivy Town without him and established the firm of Grabemann, Loring and Ross. In general, Jean was not involved in criminal law anymore and attended to more mundane matters such as the administration of the estates of Carter Hall and David Clinton. She made exceptions, though, as in her defense of Risk of the Teen Titans.\n\nJean suffered a mental breakdown as revealed in the 2004 miniseries \"Identity Crisis\". Wanting to resume her relationship with Ray, she came to believe that the surest way to do this was to endanger the loved one of another superhero. She believed that this would send all of the superheroes, including Ray, running back to their spouses and other relatives. Jean used one of Ray's old costumes to shrink down and enter the brain of Sue Dibny, the Elongated Man's wife. She attempted to cause a minor stroke but accidentally applied too much pressure to Dibny's brain and killed her. Jean panicked and used a flamethrower in an attempt to destroy Sue's body before escaping. Unbeknownst to even Sue's husband, Sue had been pregnant.\n\nJean attempted to divert suspicion away from herself by faking an attack on her own life. She then sent out several mysterious death threats to others such as Lois Lane in order to make everyone think that there was a serial killer on the loose who was targeting the loved ones of superheroes. These events caused the superhero community to launch a massive investigation to identify the killer, which resulted in the death of Firestorm at the hands of the Shadow Thief. In the final stage of her plan, Jean set up Captain Boomerang to attack Jack Drake, the father of Tim Drake, the third Robin. Jean had a gun sent to Jack so that he would be able to kill Boomerang in self-defense. Jean's hope was that afterward, everyone would believe that Boomerang had been the killer. Unfortunately for Jean, she miscalculated again and the situation ended in tragedy. Jack and Boomerang killed each other, leaving both of their sons without their fathers.\n\nAs Jean had originally planned, Ray returned to her. However, during a conversation with Ray about the deaths of Jack and Boomerang, Jean accidentally incriminated herself by asking about the \"Protect Yourself\" note that was sent to Jack along with the gun, something that she should not have known about as Batman had removed the note from the crime scene before reporters had arrived. Caught in her lie, Jean confessed everything, and Ray had her institutionalized at Arkham Asylum.\n\nWhile she is institutionalized, the supernatural entity known as Eclipso (aided by the actions of the Psycho-Pirate and Alexander Luthor of the former Earth-3) manipulates Jean into becoming his new host so she could seduce the Spectre into destroying all of the magical beings in the DC Universe series \"Day of Vengeance\".\n\nDue to Eclipso's actions, the Spectre goes on a mass-murdering rampage, killing over 700 magicians. With all their lives in danger, a group of mystics band together, forming the Shadowpact. They recruited Black Alice, a girl who has the ability to steal a person's magical powers for a short amount of time, leaving the being powerless in the process. The Shadowpact uses Black Alice's power to strip the Spectre of his own, leaving him defenseless. They then attempt to kill the Spectre while he is powerless. The plan hits a snag, as without his powers the Spectre is nothing but an empty spirit, leaving him invulnerable.\n\nDuring her brief possession of the Spectre's powers, Black Alice uses them to help fellow Shadowpact member Nightshade send Eclipso into a perpetual orbit around the sun, weakening Eclipso's powers. However, Eclipso's incapacitation did not help the Shadowpact with the Spectre, who continues to wreak havoc and ends up killing the ancient wizard Shazam.\n\nAfter the Spectre kills Nabu, the last and most powerful of the Lords of Order, the Presence's attention is finally drawn to him, and the Spectre is forced into a human host, finally stopping his mad rampage.\n\nIn Week Twenty-Seven of \"52\", Ralph Dibny approaches the Spectre as part of his quest to restore his wife Sue to life, promising to fulfil any bargain demanded of him in order to accomplish this. The Spectre, desiring revenge on Eclipso, but rendered incapable of taking it owing to his then-lack of a host (the Spectre had given Crispus a year to be by himself before he became his new host), orders Dibny to punish Eclipso in return for his wife's life; Dibny, temporarily granted the power of the Spectre, takes Eclipso back to the point at which she (as Jean Loring) murdered his wife and, restoring Jean's sanity, intends to trap her in a permanent time loop and force her to watch herself murder Sue Dibny over and over for all eternity. But the now-sane Loring tearfully begs for forgiveness and Dibny, affected by her pleas, his sense of compassion and his own feelings on watching his wife's death, finds himself incapable of completing his pact with the Spectre. He thus returns Eclipso to her orbit around the sun.\n\n\"Blue Beetle\" #16 shows Eclipso kidnapping a baby with huge raw magical abilities and attempting to corrupt it into a new host for herself. The combined efforts of Blue Beetle and Traci Thirteen foil her plans, steering her attentions toward Mary Marvel instead.\n\nIn \"Countdown to Final Crisis\" Eclipso tries to corrupt Mary. Feeding the young girl mistrust and lies, Jean manages to sway Mary from the side of the heroes, corrupting the young girl into becoming her follower. Mary Marvel rebels, and refusing to be given to Darkseid as a concubine, strips Eclipso of her black diamond, blasts her unconscious and leaves Eclipso powerless in space. Eclipso retrieves the diamond and attempts to kill Mary, only to find that Mary is too strong for her. During the battle, Mary calls down the magic lightning bolt, removing Eclipso's power from Jean. In \"Countdown to Mystery\" #4, following Mary and Eclipso's battle, the black diamond chooses Bruce Gordon as a host. Jean is shown falling into the ocean near Themiscyra and a shark is seen approaching her.\n\nIn \"Green Lantern\" #43, it is confirmed by Black Hand that Jean Loring had died, since he can hear the voice of Death, which is later revealed to be Nekron, the \"black personification\" of it. In the \"Blackest Night\" storyline, on the night of the superhero's memorial day, her widower, Ray asks Hawkman to visit her grave to be honored as a fallen member of the community, but Hawkman refuses because of what she did in \"Identity Crisis\".\n\nJean is reanimated (off-panel) as a member of the Black Lantern Corps, wearing a costume based on her Eclipso persona. She kills Damage from behind, ripping out his heart as Ray stares in shock. This final kill helps the Black Rings reach a power level of one hundred percent, thus bringing about the rise of Nekron. Jean then uses Ray's own technology to shrink him, Mera and herself into the reanimated Damage's ring. While inside the ring, she relates to Ray and Mera Nekron's origins: that he is the guardian of the darkness that existed before the light entered the universe. Jean is then possessed by Deadman, who had followed the trio into the ring, who forces her to release Ray and Mera, allowing them to return to normal size.\n\nJean then confronts Ray, who has recently been deputised into the Indigo Tribe, tormenting him with a recreation of her murder of Sue Dibny, and summoning Black Lantern versions of the minuscule tribe Ray had befriended in the \"Sword of the Atom\" series to attack him. However, Ray manages to fight back, using his indigo staff to combine the green light of willpower with the indigo light of compassion, using them to destroy Jean and her ring.\n\nJean Loring makes an appearance in Alex Ross' \"Justice\". She called her husband Ray Palmer when he was shot by Giganta. She sat by his side in the hospital. She is among the sidekicks and loved ones attacked by the Legion of Doom.\n\nPre-\"Crisis\"\n\nPost-\"Crisis\"\n\n"}

{"id": "1846574", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1846574", "title": "Polluter pays principle", "text": "Polluter pays principle\n\nIn environmental law, the polluter pays principle is enacted to make the party responsible for producing pollution responsible for paying for the damage done to the natural environment. It is regarded as a regional custom because of the strong support it has received in most Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and European Union countries. It is a fundamental principle in US environmental law.\n\nAccording to the French historian of the environment Jean-Baptiste Fressoz, financial compensation (not named \"polluter pays principle\" at that time) is already the regulation principle of pollution favoured by industrials in the nineteenth century. He wrote that: \"This principle, which is now offered as a new solution, actually accompanied the process of industrialisation, and was intended by the manufacturers themselves.\"\n\nThe polluter pays principle underpins environmental policy such as an ecotax, which, if enacted by government, deters and essentially reduces greenhouse gas emissions. This principle is based on the fact that as much as pollution is unavoidable, the person or industry that is responsible for the pollution must pay some money for the rehabilitation of the polluted environment.\n\nThe state of New South Wales in Australia has included the polluter pay principle with the other principles of ecologically sustainable development in the objectives of the Environment Protection Authority.\n\nThe polluter pays principle is set out in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and Directive 2004/35/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 on environmental liability with regard to the prevention and remedying of environmental damage is based on this principle. The directive entered into force on 30 April 2004; member states were allowed three years to transpose the directive into their domestic law and by July 2010 all member states had completed this. \n\nIn France, the Charter for the Environment contains a formulation of the polluter pays principle (article 4):\nIn Ghana, the polluter pays principle was adopted in 2011.\n\nThe polluter pays principle is also known as extended producer responsibility (EPR). This is a concept that was probably first described by Thomas Lindhqvist for the Swedish government in 1990. EPR seeks to shift the responsibility of dealing with waste from governments (and thus, taxpayers and society at large) to the entities producing it. In effect, it internalised the cost of waste disposal into the cost of the product, theoretically meaning that the producers will improve the waste profile of their products, thus decreasing waste and increasing possibilities for reuse and recycling.\n\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development defines extended producer responsibility as: \na concept where manufacturers and importers of products should bear a significant degree of responsibility for the environmental impacts of their products throughout the product life-cycle, including upstream impacts inherent in the selection of materials for the products, impacts from manufacturers’ production process itself, and downstream impacts from the use and disposal of the products. Producers accept their responsibility when designing their products to minimise life-cycle environmental impacts, and when accepting legal, physical or socio-economic responsibility for environmental impacts that cannot be eliminated by design.\nThe waste management in Switzerland is based on the polluter pays principle. Bin bags (for municipal solid waste) are taxed with pay-per-bag fees in three quarters of the communes (and the recycling rate doubled in twenty years).\n\nThe Environmental Damage (Prevention and Remediation) Regulations 2009 (for England) and the Environmental Damage (Prevention and Remediation) (Wales) Regulations 2009 (for Wales) established the operation of the polluter pays principle.\n\nThe principle is employed in all of the major US pollution control laws: Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (solid waste and hazardous waste management), and Superfund (cleanup of abandoned waste sites).\n\nSome eco-taxes underpinned by the polluter pays principle include:\n\nIn 2003, an amendment was passed negating the \"polluter pays\" provision of the Florida Constitution.\n\nThe US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has observed that the polluter pays principle has typically not been fully implemented in US laws and programs. For example, drinking water and sewage treatment services are subsidized and there are limited mechanisms in place to fully assess polluters for treatment costs.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Environmental Management Act of 2002 prohibits the discharge of pollutants into the environment. In line with the \"Polluter Pays\" principle, the Act requires a polluter to meet the cost of decontaminating the polluted environment.\n\nIn international environmental law it is mentioned in the principle 16 of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development of 1992.\n\n"}

{"id": "1846593", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1846593", "title": "Cats in ancient Egypt", "text": "Cats in ancient Egypt\n\nCats in ancient Egypt were represented in social and religious practices of Ancient Egypt for more than 3,000 years. Several Ancient Egyptian deities were depicted and sculptured with cat-like heads such as Mafdet, Bastet and Sekhmet, representing justice, fertility and power.\nThe deity Mut was also depicted as a cat and in the company of a cat.\n\nCats were praised for killing venomous snakes and protecting the Pharaoh since at least the First Dynasty of Egypt. Skeletal remains of cats were found among funerary goods dating to the 12th Dynasty. The protective function of cats is indicated in the \"Book of the Dead\", where a cat represents Ra and the benefits of the sun for life on Earth. Cat-shaped decorations used during the New Kingdom of Egypt indicate that the cat cult became more popular in daily life. Cats were depicted in association with the name of Bastet.\n\nCat cemeteries at the archaeological sites Speos Artemidos, Bubastis and Saqqara were used for several centuries. They contained vast numbers of cat mummies and cat statues that are exhibited in museum collections worldwide.\nAmong the mummified animals excavated in Gizeh, the African wildcat (\"Felis lybica\") is the most common cat followed by the jungle cat (\"Felis chaus\").\nIn view of the huge number of cat mummies found in Egypt, the cat cult was certainly important for the country's economy, as it required breeding of cats and a trading network for the supply of food, oils and resins for embalming them.\n\nMafdet was the first known cat-headed deity in ancient Egypt. During the First Dynasty 2920–2770 BC, she was regarded as protector of the Pharaoh's chambers against snakes, scorpions and evil. She was often also depicted with a head of a leopard (\"Panthera pardus\"). She was particularly prominent during the reign of Den.\n\nThe deity Bastet is known from at least the Second Dynasty 2890 BC onwards. At the time, she was depicted with a lion (\"Panthera leo\") head. Seals and stone vessels with her name were found in the tombs of the pharaohs Khafra and Nyuserre Ini, indicating that she was regarded as protector since the mid 30th century BC during the Fourth and Fifth Dynasties.\nA wall painting in the Fifth Dynasty's burial ground at Saqqara shows a small cat with a collar, suggesting that tamed African wildcats were kept in the pharaonic quarters by the 26th century BC.\n\nAmulets with cat heads came into fashion in the 21st century BC during the 11th Dynasty.\nA mural from this period in the tomb of Baqet III depicts a cat in a hunting scene confronting a rat-like rodent.\n\nA tomb at the necropolis Umm El Qa'ab contained 17 cat skeletons dating to the early 20th century BC. Next to the skeletons stood small pots that are thought to have contained milk for the cats.\nSeveral tomb murals in the Theban Necropolis show cats in domestic scenes. These tombs belonged to nobles and high-ranking officials of the 18th Dynasty and were built in the 15th and 14th centuries BC. The murals show a cat sitting under a chair during a buffet, eating meat or fish; some show it in the company of a goose or a monkey. A cat in hunting and fowling scenes is another recurring motif in murals of Theben tombs.\n\nThe first known indication for the mummification of a cat was found in an elaborately carved limestone sarcophagus dated to about 1350 BC. This cat is assumed to have been Prince Thutmose’s beloved pet.\n\nFrom the 22nd Dynasty at around the mid 950s BC onwards, the deity Bastet and her temple in the city of Bubastis grew in popularity. She is now shown only with a small cat head.\nDomestic cats (\"Felis catus\") were increasingly worshiped and considered sacred. When they died, they were embalmed, coffined and buried in cat cemeteries. The domestic cat was regarded as living incarnation of Bastet who protects the household against granivores, whereas the lion-headed deity Sekhmet was worshipped as protector of the pharaohs.\nDuring the reign of Pharaoh Osorkon II in the 9th century BC, the temple of Bastet was enlarged by a festival hall.\nCat statues and statuettes from this period exist in diverse sizes and materials, including solid and hollow cast bronze, alabaster and faïence.\n\nMummifying animals grew in popularity during the Late Period of ancient Egypt from 664 BC onwards. Mummies were used for votive offerings to the associated deity, mostly during festivals or by pilgrims. Catacombs from the New Kingdom period in the Bubastis, Saqqara and Beni Hasan necropoli were reused as cemeteries for mummies offered to Bastet.\n\nIn the mid 5th century BC, Herodotus described the annual festival at the Bubastis temple as the largest in the country, attended by several hundred thousand pilgrims.\n\nDuring the Hellenistic period between 323 and 30 BC, the goddess Isis became associated with Bastet and cats, as indicated by an inscription at the Temple of Edfu: “Isis is the soul of Bastet”. In this period, cats were systematically bred to be killed and to be mummified as sacrifices to the gods.\n\nAs described by Diodorus Siculus, killing a cat was regarded a serious crime. In the years between 60 and 56 BC, outraged people lynched a Roman for killing a cat, although pharaoh Ptolemy XII Auletes tried to intervene.\n\nCats and religion began to be disassociated after Egypt became a Roman province in 30 BC. A series of decrees and edicts issued by Roman Emperors in the 4th and 5th centuries AD gradually curtailed the practice of paganism and pagan rituals in Egypt. Pagan temples were impounded and sacrifices prohibited by 380 AD. Three edicts issued between 391 and 392 prohibited pagan rituals and burial ceremonies at all cult sites. Death penalty for offenders was introduced in 395, and the destruction of pagan temples decreed in 399. By 415, the Christian church received all property that was formerly dedicated to paganism. Pagans were exiled by 423, and crosses replaced pagan symbols following a decree from 435.\n\nEgypt has since experienced a decline in the veneration once held for cats.\nThey were still respected in the 15th century, when Arnold von Harff travelled to Egypt and observed mamluk warriors treating cats with honour and empathy.\nGentle treatment of cats is part of Islamic tradition.\n\nIn 1799, members of the French Commission des Sciences et des Arts surveyed the old city of Lycopolis near Asyut for the first time and found mummified cats and remains of other animals.\nThey also found mummified cats and cat skeletons in the Theban Necropolis.\nIn the 1820s, the Louvre Museum exhibited cat statues made of wood, bronze, and enameled pottery that originated mostly in Bubastis.\n\nIn 1830, Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg accounted of having observed three different small cat forms in Egypt: the jungle cat, the African wildcat, and a sacred cat that was intermediate in size between the jungle cat and the domestic cat. He called this cat \"Felis bubastis\".\n\nThe Egypt Exploration Society funded excavations in Bubastis in the late 1880s. Édouard Naville accounted of numerous cat statues already available in Cairo shops at the time. At the city's cemetery of cats, he and colleagues emptied several large pits up to a volume of filled with cat and Egyptian mongoose (\"Herpestes ichneumon\") bones.\nAmong the bones, some embalming material, porcelain and bronze objects, beads and ornaments, and statues of Bastet and Nefertem were also found. By 1889, the cemetery was considered exhausted.\n\nIn the late 1880s, more than 200,000 mummified animals, most of them cats, were found in the cemetery of Beni Hasan in central Egypt. In 1890, William Martin Conway wrote about excavations in Speos Artemidos near Beni Hasan: \"The plundering of the cemetery was a sight to see, but one had to stand well windward. The village children came from day to day and provided themselves with the most attractive mummies they could find. These they took down the river bank to sell for the smallest coin to passing travelers. The path became strewn with mummy cloth and bits of cats' skulls and bones and fur in horrid positions, and the wind blew the fragments about and carried the stink afar.\"\nIn 1890, a shipment of thousands of animal mummies reached Liverpool. Most of them were cat mummies. A large part was sold as fertiliser, a small part was purchased by the zoological museum of the city's university college.\n\nThe Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon received hundreds of cat mummies excavated by Gaston Maspero at Beni Hasan, Sakkara and Thebes. The cats were of all ages from adult to kittens with deciduous teeth. Some of them were contained in statues and sarcophagi. The larger ones were bandaged in cloth of different colours with decorated heads and ears formed of rubberized tissue.\n\nThe Institut Français d'Archéologie Orientale funded excavations near Faiyum where Pierre Jouguet found a tomb full of cat mummies in 1901. It was located in the midst of tombs with crocodile mummies.\n\nIn 1907, the British Museum received a collection of 192 mummified cats and 11 small carnivores excavated at Gizeh by Flinders Petrie. The mummies probably date to between 600 and 200 BC. Two of these cat mummies were radiographed in 1980. The analysis revealed that they were deliberately strangulated before they reached the age of two years. They were probably used to supply the demand for mummified cats as votive offerings.\n\nRemains of 23 cats were found in the early 1980s in a small mastaba tomb at the archaeological site Balat in Dakhla Oasis. The tomb was established during the Old Kingdom of Egypt in the 25th century BC and reused later. The cats were probably mummified as tissue shreds were still stuck in their bones.\n\nExcavations in the Bubasteum area at Saqqara in the early 1980s yielded 200 cat mummies in the tomb of the Vizier Aperel.\nAnother 184 cat mummies were found in a different part of this tomb in the 1990s, comprising 11 packets with a few cat bones and 84 packets containing mud, clay and pebbles. Radiographic examination showed that mostly young cats were mummified; most cats died of skull fractures and had dislocated spinal bones, indicating that they were beaten to death. In this site, the tomb of Tutankhamun's wet nurse Maia was discovered in 1996, which contained cat mummies next to human mummies.\nIn 2001, the skeleton of a male lion was found in this tomb that also showed signs of mummification. It was about nine years old, probably lived in captivity for many years and showed signs of malnutrition. It had probably lived and died in the Ptolemaic period.\nMummified remains of 335 domestic and 29 jungle cats were excavated in the catacombs of Anubis at Saqqara during works started in 2009.\n\nIn the 2nd century, Polyaenus accounted of a stratagem allegedly deployed by the Persian king Cambyses II during the Battle of Pelusium (525 BC): Cambyses II ordered placing of cats and other animals venerated by Egyptians before the Persian front lines. Egyptians purportedly stopped their defending operations, and the Persians then conquered Pelusium.\n\n\n"}

It is the native place of the Shona people.\n\nCurrently, Mashonaland is divided into three provinces,\nIn addition, the Zimbabwean capital of Harare, a province unto itself, lies entirely in Mashonaland.\n\nIt was originally one of the regions that the country was divided into following occupation by the Pioneer Column in 1890 and designated the extent of territory under administration of the British South Africa Company as distinct from the remainder of the territory that was directly under the control of the Matabele king, Lobengula, which was named Matabeleland when it was occupied in 1893. The two had separate administrations for part of the BSA Company colonial period.\n\nRevolt broke out against the British South Africa Company in 1896, led by priests of the Mwari religion. The British prevailed, executed some leaders, and tried to reform the system.\n\nIn 1923, the territory became part of the self-governing colony of Southern Rhodesia and Mashonaland became one of the five provinces. In 1970, an administrative reform led to Mashonaland being divided into a northern and a southern half. Most recently, in 1983, it was divided into the current three sectors and the capital city of Harare was given its own provincial status as well. Since the constitutional amendments that took effect in 1988, each is run by a governor appointed by the president.\n\nThe territory is composed of a broad plateau that slopes gradually to the north and north-west. The lowest land is on its northern border, which is formed by the Zambezi River, with Zambia beyond. A small part straddles the plateau at its south-eastern edge and here the land drains into the Save River but the rest of Mashonaland is part of the Zambezi drainage basin. To the south, the Munyati River forms the border with the current and former province of Midlands. The Nyangadzi river forms the border with Manicaland to the east.\n\nMuch of the landform is rolling low hills divided by river valleys. About half the land is over altitude and the central watershed in the south and centre is at . Only a few isolated mountains and the spine of the Umvukwes Range in the west rise higher. The highest point is in the Wedza Mountains in the south east at .\n\n\n"}

Christened Fox as a compliment to Charles James Fox, the great Whig, he served for a term in the Army.\n\nIn 1835 he entered the House of Commons as member for Perthshire. In the ministry of Lord Melbourne (1835–1841), Maule was Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, and under Lord John Russell, he was Secretary at War from July 1846 to January 1852, when for two or three weeks he was President of the Board of Control.\n\nIn April 1852, he succeeded his father as 2nd Baron Panmure. In February 1855, he joined Lord Palmerston's cabinet, filling the new office of Secretary of State for War. Lord Panmure held this office until February 1858. He was at the War Office during the concluding period of the Crimean War, and met a good deal of criticism. He was Keeper of the Privy Seal of Scotland from 1853 until his death.\n\nAlways interested in church matters, Dalhousie was a prominent supporter of the Free Church of Scotland after it split from the Church of Scotland in the disruption of 1843. In December 1860, he succeeded his kinsman, the 1st Marquess of Dalhousie, as 11th Earl of Dalhousie. He shortly afterwards changed his surname to \"Maule-Ramsay\" (his father had changed his surname to \"Maule\" from the family's patronymic \"Ramsay\" before being created Baron Panmure).\n\nMaule was appointed Senior Grand Warden of the United Grand Lodge of England in 1832, and later (as Lord Panmure) Deputy Grand Master in 1857. He was elected Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Scotland in 1867. In 1860, Panmure Lodge (now No. 723) was warranted, being named after the then Deputy Grand Master.\n\nLord Dalhousie married the Hon. Montague, daughter of George Abercromby, 2nd Baron Abercromby, in 1831. They had no children. She died in November 1853, aged 46. Lord Dalhousie died July 1874, aged 73.

Congress had several session agreements regarding the White Earth Band of Ojibwe. After hearing many complaints about the Pillagers, who were then landless, Congress authorized the relocation of the western Pillagers to the White Earth Indian Reservation. They had not been included in the 1855 Treaty of Washington (), which was made with the eastern Pillagers at the Mississippi River headwaters. Eventually the Otter Tail Pillager Band of Chippewa Indians and Wild Rice River Pembina Band of Chippewa Indians also came to settle alongside the Mississippi Chippewa at White Earth Reservation and effectively became part of the White Earth Band.\n\nUp until the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, the six historical component bands located on the White Earth Indian Reservation acted independently of each other. Following the Reorganization Act, the six wrote a constitution to form the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe. They divided Minnesota into six Band districts, and unified those scattered Ojibwe bands that were not associated with the Red Lake Band of Chippewa, which did not join the Tribe.\n\nThe six component bands located on the White Earth Indian Reservation were unified into the single White Earth Band of Ojibwe of today.

Just as its predecessor, it uses the Build engine. It was Capstone's last proprietary game before they and their parent company Intracorp went bankrupt. In \"Witchaven II\", the player controls the returning knight Grondoval, the hero of the first game, as he is trying to stop an evil witch from carrying a titular blood vengeance in revenge for him having slain her sister in the original game. It received generally negative reviews, with criticism directed at its controls, enemy AI, and general mediocrity as compared to other first-person shooters coming out at the time.\n\nThe sequel's gameplay system is very similar but features some other improvements over the first game, such as possibility to wield two weapons (one in each hand) and to hold a shield in the non-weapon hand. Compared with the previous game the level of difficulty was also increased and the graphics were partially refined. Unlike the first game in the series it came with the Build level editor which meant that the players were able to create their own levels. Unlike in the first game, most enemies are men instead of monsters.\n\n\"Witchaven II\" takes place after the events of the first game, when the forces of darkness were triumphed over: the witch queen Illwhyrin was destroyed in her lair in the isle of Char and the evil curse was lifted. During the victory party celebrating the destruction of Witchaven, the hero of the game, Grondoval, falls into a slumber. After awaking, he is told by the mysterious female golden dragon named Ikethsti that the great witch Cirae-Argoth, one of the most powerful of Nether-Reaches Order of Witches, has arrived to avenge the death of her sister. An army of demons and Argothonian clansmen has abducted Grondoval's beloved princess Elizabeth and the other people of his homeland Stazhia to exact the titular blood vengeance and now it is only up to Grondoval to try and rescue his countrymen before they will all be gone forever. His new quest is fight his way to find and vanquish Cirae-Argoth, thwarting her plot, and to capture the Horned Skull item which would then contain her evil powers forever. The story is told in the intro sequence and further explained in the game's manual.\n\nAfter killing Cirae-Argoth, the game ends with a cinematic sequence showing her corpse turn into a skeleton, which then suddenly rises and attempts to flee while laughing until it's hit and shattered by Grondoval's magic missile. Grondoval loses consciousness and awakens in a different location. The dragon Ikethsti arrives again to tell a cryptic message, saying the whole plot was really an elaborate set up as Cirae-Argoth was not her real master and Grondoval's kindred has never disappeared; it was actually only Grondoval who has vanished. (This scene directly contradicts much of what was written in the game's manual, including text beyond the introduction section) Ikethsti also tells him his trials are far from over, and they will see each other again (apparently hinting at another sequel that has never arrived). In the final scene, the witch's skull swallows a butterfly and vanishes into the ground while ominous music plays. \"Computer Gaming World\", baffled by the ending cutscene, included it in their 1996 list of the least rewarding endings of all time.\n\"Witchaven II\" received mostly poor reviews. \"Computer and Video Games\" criticized the quality of the game's cinematic cutscenes and the enemy AI, as well as its overall feel of a rushed expansion to the first \"Witchaven\" instead of a more proper sequel. A review in \"Next Generation\" said that the game \"is an improvement over the original, but it doesn't stack up to comparable games in its genre.\" The reviewer argued that hand-to-hand combat from a first-person perspective is intrinsically unexciting since the player character can neither aim nor move around as much, and complained of controls that are less than responsive. However, he praised the Build level editor as being better documented than the one in \"Duke Nukem 3D\". Brett Jones of \"PC Gamer US\" wrote: \"Where \"Duke\" takes players on a wickedly frantic and bloody ride, \"Witchaven II\" has you slogging, trundling, and hacking your way through dark levels and mindless enemies from start to finish,\" and adding: \"If the controls weren’t so bad and the enemies so boneheaded, you might find \"Witchaven II\"’s sinister design a welcome change from the norm. But those little touches aren’t enough.\" Daniel Jevons of \"Maximum\" panned the game, saying that \"The graphics are sluggish (despite using the same engine as Duke), the controls are unresponsive, the collision detection is dodgy (particularly on close combat), and the game commits the cardinal sin of having loads of invisible hidden traps that kill you instantly.\" He remarked that the game was a particularly poor choice for buyers given that \"Duke Nukem 3D\" had just been released and \"Quake\" was due out in less than a month. \n\n"}

She has been a member of supervillain groups, including the Alliance of Evil and the Acolytes, as well as the superhero team the X-Men.\n\nFrenzy first appeared in \"X-Factor\" #4 (May 1986) as a member of the Alliance of Evil, and was created by Bob Layton and Keith Pollard.\n\nThough Joanna Cargill's first and last name have been spelled with variations such as Johanna or Cargil, her name was first mentioned in \"Uncanny X-Men\" #298 as Joanna Cargill. Frenzy should not be confused with another Joanna Cargill, a columnist introduced in \"Marvel Comics Presents\" #27.\n\nDuring a March 2, 2011 Marvel Comics Liveblog, it was revealed that Frenzy is joining \"X-Men: Legacy\" in 2011 as a member of Rogue's team of X-Men, alongside Professor X, Magneto, Legion, and Gambit.\n\nThe woman who would one day become the super-powered mutant, Frenzy, began her life as a battered child in an abusive household. Her father, an officer in the Armed Forces, despised her from birth not only because of her gender - he instead doted on his son in whom, according to Cargill, he saw a continuation of the family legacy as soldiers - but also because she was born prematurely, and was a sickly, frail child, greatly increasing the financial burdens on the family. Her mother, meanwhile, was thoroughly cowed by her husband's abuse, and did nothing to stop the beatings he would constantly inflict on his daughter for even seemingly minor infractions. One day, not long after his son was killed in action, he took his rage out on his daughter for the death of his son, seemingly wanting to beat her to death. Either her rage or her fear awakened her mutant powers as he beat her savagely, and she unintentionally punched straight through his body with a single blow, killing him instantly. Shocked at what she had done, albeit accidentally, she ran away from home.\n\nOriginally a freelance mercenary, Frenzy joins together with three other mutants — Tower, Stinger, and Timeshadow — under the employ of Apocalypse, calling themselves the Alliance of Evil. After Tower's failed attempt to kidnap the mutant Rusty Collins, Frenzy is sent and put in direct conflict with X-Factor. Frenzy is unable to convince Rusty to join the Alliance, and fled after suffering defeat from X-Factor. The Alliance later reveals they had a power-enhancing accomplice named Michael Nowlan. After he tries to escape from the Alliance, the group threatens to kill Nowlan's girlfriend, Suzy. X-Factor interferes in the Alliance's plans, eventually defeating them and putting them into custody. Frenzy and the others inevitably break out, opposing the Mutant Registration Act, but were defeated by the Beast.\n\nAfter another mission battling the New Mutants alongside the Alliance, Frenzy is defeated by Warpath. Cable frees Frenzy and questions who had hired her. She admits to being hired by A.I.M. to bodyguard Harness and Piecemeal. Cable then drops Frenzy from the helicopter they were on.\n\nShe eventually receives an invitation to join Superia's Femizons and accepted, joining the superhuman women aboard Superia's cruise-ship. She joins in the en masse attack on Captain America and Paladin, and traveled to Superia's Island to be one of her new Femizons.\n\nUnder unknown circumstances, she was once again imprisoned, but was able to break free from the Vault and created problems for the Avengers.\n\nFrenzy eventually found acceptance under Magneto's teachings, joining the ranks of the second incarnation of the Acolytes. As was common among the Acolytes, she relinquished her codename, preferring to be called by her last name, Cargill. Their first mission was to capture a child with latent mutant powers from Our Mother of the Sacred Heart, a school. During the mission, Cargill killed Sharon Friedlander, and with her teammates Unuscione and the Kleinstocks, battled the gold X-Men team. Having history with Gambit (they met and clashed during a mission when they were mercenaries-for-hire), she immediately went after him and Bishop. However, Gambit was able to defeat her by hitting her with a kinetically charged tire. (The hinted relationship between Cargill and Gambit was supposedly going to be elaborated on in Fabian Nicieza's \"Gambit\" series, but it was canceled before he could get around to it.) The Acolytes were able to retreat, but fought the X-Men once again later that week. There, Cargill battled Iceman, commenting on how she has changed since her days with the Alliance of Evil, but Iceman was able to knock her unconscious using his newly acquired ice powers. Later, Cargill attempted to murder Senator Kelly, but was electrocuted by Wolfsbane.\n\nAfter Magneto was revealed to be alive, Cargill was among the Acolytes who quickly turned on Fabian Cortez and joined Magneto in his mutant sanctuary, . While on a mission to recruit mutants to their cause, Cargill, along with Milan and Unuscione, found the young, meek boy Neophyte. After his betrayal of the Acolytes, Cargill was quick to vote guilty at his trial. During the Fall of Avalon, Cargill allied herself with long-time enemy Cyclops in order to survive, and she and her fellow Acolytes were able to escape the destroyed space station in time. They crash landed in Australia but were given to the authorities.\n\nThe Acolytes escaped prison and found the remains of Avalon, worshiping it and the return of Magneto. Exodus eventually took over leadership of the Acolytes, and Cargill participated in the attack on Mount Wundagore, the High Evolutionary's base of operations.\n\nAfter the Acolytes disbanded, Cargill became the ambassador of Genosha to the United Nations and served as Magneto's right-hand woman. When the Avengers infiltrated Genosha, Cargill attacked She-Hulk with a punch that sent She-Hulk flying. After confronting Quicksilver over his choices with his father, Cargill was defeated by Scarlet Witch. Later, Cargill appeared on television, ordering that every country pledge loyalty to Magneto in order to be given some autonomy. She was eventually captured by the government in an attempt to find out more of Magneto's plans, but she refused to speak. Jean Grey freed Cargill and mind-controlled her. Cargill's knowledge of Genosha helped the X-Men find Magneto's base. The inexperienced X-Men attacked but were quickly defeated. Cargill was used against her will to battle Magneto, but she was ultimately constrained with a metal pillar. After Magneto's defeat, Cargill was freed from her mind-control, where she immediately left the X-Mansion.\n\nFrenzy is one of the few mutants left after M-Day. She resurfaces alongside Random and Tempo as part of a new team of Acolytes led by Exodus. During their first mission, she is sent to distract the X-Men with Tempo, and succeeds in defeating Rogue. She is defeated by the combined effort of Mystique, Northstar, and Aurora by being thrown out of the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier. \n\nShe regrouped with Exodus as he pledged his allegiance to Mister Sinister, and attacked the X-Mansion with her teammates in search of the Destiny Diaries. After discovering the copies in the mansion were fake, Frenzy and the Acolytes battled Shadowcat, Colossus, and the New X-Men. Frenzy, disgusted with Hellion's disrespect, immediately defeated him, and later battled X-23, who was able to draw blood from Frenzy's steel-hard skin. The Acolytes defeated the X-Men and returned to Mr. Sinister, with their mission being a failure.\n\nDuring , Frenzy joined in the battle against the X-Teams, most often battling Colossus.\n\nAfter the events of Messiah Complex, she escaped with the other Acolytes and Professor X's body, taking him to an unknown part of the world. Frenzy in particular did not want anything to do with Professor Xavier, and instead wished to kill him. After arguing with her fellow Acolytes over the matter, Frenzy confronted Xavier, Omega Sentinel, and a depowered Magneto, and attacked, severely damaging Omega Sentinel. She was stopped by Magneto, who used a surgical laser on Frenzy's eye to fry her brain. While Xavier thought she was dead, Magneto revealed she is most likely alive. Exodus, upon learning of this, swore to destroy Magneto.\n\nWhen Xavier returned to the Acolytes' headquarters, he brought Frenzy out of her coma, claiming her \"friends missed her.\" She immediately attempted to kill Xavier, but Xavier warned her if she touched him she would sleep for another year. After Exodus decided to disband the Acolytes, Frenzy angrily deemed him and the other Acolytes cowards, believing them to be giving up simply because the odds were against them. She and Unuscione were the only Acolytes to oppose the notion of disbanding.\n\nFrenzy is seen along with Nekra in the riots in San Francisco by Karma, who tells them to behave. Ms. Marvel arrives and blasts Nekra and Frenzy, taking them out. After this she moves along with many other mutants to the island of Utopia. During the final fight against the Dark Avengers, Frenzy teams up with Nekra and Bling! against Ms. Marvel. Frenzy was later one of the mutants, who were rallied by Cyclops to fight against the attacking Nimrods.\n\nFollowing the end of Age of X, an alternate timeline in which she was married to Cyclops, Joanna had trouble adjusting back to normal life, as her experiences as a more heroic figure have had a profound effect on her. She confronted Cyclops about the time they shared together in the fictitious universe, but he rejected her; despite this, she refused to have her memory wiped of the experience unlike many other citizens of Utopia. Frenzy then starts dressing as her Age of X counterpart and decides that she wants to become an X-Man.\n\nJoining Rogue's squad of X-Men, Frenzy assists in tracking down Legion's escaped personalities. Under the influence of Susan in Sunshine; Frenzy and Gambit share a kiss. After bringing together all of Legion's rogue personalities, Frenzy accompanies Rogue, Gambit and Magneto into space to rescue Havok, Polaris and Marvel Girl.\n\nFollowing the X-Men's Schism, Frenzy decided to leave Utopia alongside Wolverine and other former X-Men to re-open the Jean Grey School For Higher Learning. Her reasons for leaving were based on her love for Cyclops, not wanting to fall back into old habits and to make a positive change in her life. Before departing Utopia, she assists Rogue and a few other X-Men in saving Ariel.\n\nFrenzy allied herself with Wolverine's team in the initial fight between the Avengers and X-Men. Choosing to stay with the Students of the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning, Frenzy was soon drawn into the conflict when a team Avengers consisting of She-Hulk, Falcon and Moon Knight were sent to watch over the Mutants. This soon escalated into a fight between the two teams. When the Phoenix Five returned to Earth to remake the Earth into their own Utopia, Frenzy assisted them in helping to dismantle a Militia force in Narobia.\n\nFollowing the release of the Terrigen Mist clouds on Earth and their threat to Mutants, Frenzy chose to ally herself with Crystal and her team of Inhumans. Working as a covert agent of the Inhumans she helped to save countless Mutants in danger of the Terrigen Clouds.\n\nFrenzy is a mutant who possesses steel-hard skin that makes her resistant to most forms of conventional physical injury, as well as temperature extremes. She has been shown to merely shrug off being covered in flames and is also highly resistant to microwave radiation, though adamantium has been shown to puncture her skin after an encounter with X-23. Frenzy also possesses superhuman strength, approximately on par with Spider-Man. In later years she has been depicted as strong enough to battle characters like Rogue, and She-Hulk.\n\nIn the 2011 \"Age of X\" storyline, Joanna was captured after various attacks against anti-mutant groups and is incarcerated on Ryker's Island. She is later freed by Cyclops, who later marries her.\n\nIn 2006, Cargill appears in the \"Marvel Zombies\" miniseries, along with some of her fellow Acolytes (Fabian Cortez, Scanner, Lisa Hendricks, Reynolds, Burns) and Forge as the few survivors hiding in Asteroid M from the hordes of zombies on Earth. She and the others make a few trips down to Earth in order to gather intelligence.\n\nIn the \"Days of Future Now\" storyline, Cargill appears as a member of Gene Nation.\n\nCargill appears in two issues of \"What If\". The first depicts her as a member of the X-Men, but she eventually splits off with other villains such as Toad, Unus the Untouchable, and Pyro. Another has her fleeing for her life after confronting Apocalypse's Horseman of Death, Archangel, who thinks she is unworthy of living.\n\nCargill also appears in as a member of the X-Men who battle the Skrulls that took the forms of Genesis, Stryfe, and the Goblin Queen. She was one of the few survivors after the X-Mansion had been destroyed.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1846673", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1846673", "title": "Therizinosauria", "text": "Therizinosauria\n\nTherizinosaurs (once called segnosaurs) were small to giant-sized, mainly herbivorous, theropod dinosaurs that have been found across the Early to Late Cretaceous deposits in Mongolia, China and North America. Various features of the forelimbs, skull and pelvis unite these finds as both theropods and maniraptorans, close relatives to birds. The representative genus, \"Therizinosaurus\", is derived from the Greek θερίζω (therízo, meaning scythe, reap or cut) and σαῦρος (sauros, meaning lizard). The older representative, \"Segnosaurus\", is derived from the Latin word segnis (meaning slow) and the Greek σαῦρος (sauros, meaning lizard).\n\nTherizinosaurs were long considered an enigmatic group, whose mosaic of features resembling those of various different dinosaur groups, and scarcity of their fossils, led to controversy over their evolutionary relationships for decades after their initial discovery. The first genus, \"Therizinosaurus\", was originally identified as a turtle when described from forelimb elements in 1954. Perle noted in 1979 that the \"Segnosaurus\" fossils were possibly representative of a new family of dinosaurs, which he tentatively classified as theropods (traditionally thought of as the \"meat-eating\" dinosaurs). He named the family Segnosauridae, with \"Segnosaurus\" as type genus and sole member. He distinguished Segnosauridae from the theropod families Deinocheiridae and Therizinosauridae (then only known from the genera \"Deinocheirus\" and \"Therizinosaurus\", both mainly represented by large forelimbs found in Mongolia) by features of their humeri and hand claws. Later in 1979, Barsbold and Perle found the pelvic features of segnosaurids and dromaeosaurids so different from those of \"true\" theropods that they should be separated into three taxa of the same rank, possibly at the level of infraorder within Saurischia (one of the two main divisions of dinosaurs, the other being ornithischia).\n\nIn 1980, Barsbold and Perle named the new theropod infraorder Segnosauria, containing only Segnosauridae. In the same article, they named the new genus \"Erlikosaurus\" (known from a well-preserved skull and partial skeleton) which they tentatively considered a segnosaurid, and reported a partial pelvis of an undetermined segnosaurian, both from the same formation as \"Segnosaurus\". Combined, the specimens provided relatively complete data on this group; they were united by their opisthopubic pelvis, slender mandible, and the toothless front of their jaws. Barsbold and Perle stated that though some of their features resembled those of ornithischians and sauropods, these similarities were superficial, and were distinct when examined in detail. While they were essentially different from other theropods (perhaps due to diverging from them relatively early), and therefore warranted a new infraorder, they did show similarities with them. Since the \"Erlikosaurus\" specimen lacked a pelvis, the authors were unsure if that of the undetermined segnosaurian could belong to it, in which case they would consider it part of a separate family. Though \"Erlikosaurus\" was difficult to compare directly to \"Segnosaurus\" due to the incompleteness of their remains, Perle stated in 1981 that there was no justification for separating it into another family.\n\nIn 1982, Perle reported hindlimb fragments similar to those of \"Segnosaurus\", and assigned them to \"Therizinosaurus\", whose forelimbs had been found in almost the same location. He concluded that Therizinosauridae, Deinocheiridae, and Segnosauridae, which all had enlarged forelimbs, represented the same taxonomic group. \"Segnosaurus\" and \"Therizinosaurus\" were particularly similar, leading Perle to suggest they belonged in a family to the exclusion of Deinocheiridae (today, \"Deinocheirus\" is recognized as an ornithomimosaur). Barsbold retained \"Segnosaurus\" and \"Erlikosaurus\" in the family Segnosauridae in 1983, and named the new genus \"Enigmosaurus\" based on the previously undetermined segnosaurian pelvis, which he placed in its own family, Enigmosauridae, within Segnosauria. Though the structure of the pelvis of \"Erlikosaurus\" was unknown, Barsbold considered it unlikely the \"Enigmosaurus\" pelvis belonged to it, since \"Erlikosaurus\" and \"Segnosaurus\" were so similar in other respects, while the pelvis of \"Enigmosaurus\" was very different from that of \"Segnosaurus\". Barsbold found that segnosaurids were so peculiar compared to more typical theropods that they were either a very significant deviation in theropod evolution, or that they went \"beyond the borders\" of this group, but opted to retain them within Theropoda. In the same year, Barsbold stated that the segnosaurian pelvis deviated strongly from the theropod norm, and found the configuration of their ilia generally similar to those of sauropods. \nPaleontologist Gregory S. Paul concluded in 1984 that segnosaurs did not possess any theropodan features, but were instead derived, late-surviving Cretaceous prosauropods with adaptations similar to those of ornithischians. He found segnosaurs similar to prosauropods in the morphology of their snout, mandible, and hindfoot, and to ornithischians in their cheek, palate, pubis, and ankle, and similar to early dinosaurs in other respects. He proposed that ornithischians were descended from prosauropods, and that the segnosaurs were an intermediate relict of this transition, which supposedly took place during the Triassic period. In this way, he considered segnosaurians to be to herbivorous dinosaurs what monotremes are to mammals. He did not rule out that segnosaurs could be derived from theropods, or that segnosaurs, prosauropods and ornithischians were each independently derived from early dinosaurs, but found these options unlikely. He considered the common descent of these groups as support for the idea that dinosaurs were a monophyletic (natural) group, which was contested by some paleontologists at the time (who instead thought different dinosaurs groups evolved independently from thecodonts). Paleontologist David B. Norman considered Paul's idea a contentious claim \"bound to provoke much argument\" in 1985. In 1988, Paul maintained that segnosaurs were late surviving ornithischian-like prosauropods, and proposed a segnosaurian identity for \"Therizinosaurus\". He also placed segnosauria within Phytodinosauria, a superorder that palaontologist Robert Bakker had created in 1985 to retain all plant-eating dinosaurs. In a 1986 study of the interrelationships of saurischian dinosaurs, paleontologist Jacques Gauthier concluded that segnosaurs were prosauropods. While he conceded they had similarities with ornithischians and theropods, he proposed these featured had evolved independently. In a 1989 conference abstract about sauropodomorph interrelatonships, paleontologist Paul Sereno also considered segnosaurs as prosauropods, based on skull features. \nIn a 1990 review article, Barsbold and paleontologist Teresa Maryańska found Segnosauria to be a rare and aberrant group of saurischians, in an unresolved position among sauropodomorphs and theropods, probably closer to the former. They therefore listed them as Saurischia \"sedis mutabilis\" (\"position subject to change\"). Though they agreed the hindlimbs assigned to \"Therizinosaurus\" in 1982 were segnosaurian, they did not consider this justification for \"Therizinosaurus\" itself being a segnosaur, since it was only known from forelimbs. In 1993, paleontologists Dale A. Russell and Dong Zhi-Ming described the new genus \"Alxasaurus\" from China, at the time the most complete large theropod from its time and place. While it was similar to prosauropods in some respects, the detailed morphology of its limbs linked it to \"Therizinosaurus\" and segnosaurs. Since it preserved both fore and hindlimbs, \"Alxasaurus\" showed that Perle's assignment of segnosaurian hindlimbs to \"Therizinosaurus\" was probably correct. Russell and Dong therefore proposed that Segnosauridae was a junior synonym of Therizinosauridae (since the latter name was older), with \"Alxasaurus\" being the most completely known representative so far, providing a better understanding of the group. They also named the new higher taxonomic rank Therizinosauroidea to contain \"Alxasaurus\" and Therizinosauridae (since the new genus was somewhat different from its relatives), which they placed in the group Tetanurae within Theropoda. They considered therizinosaurs most closely related to ornithomimids, troodontids, and oviraptorids, which they placed together in the group Oviraptorosauria (since they found Maniraptora, the conventional grouping of these, invalid, and the higher level taxonomy of theropods was in flux at the time).\n\nThe synonymy of Segnosauridae with Therizinosauridae was accepted by Perle himself and co-authors of a redescription of the holotype skull of \"Erlikosaurus\" in 1994, and they considered therizinosaurs maniraptoran theropods, the group that also includes modern birds (since they did find Maniraptora to be valid through their analysis). They also discussed the previous ornithischian and sauropod hypotheses for therizinosaur affinities in detail and demonstrated various faults with them. Palaeontologist Lev Alexandrovich Nessov rejected that therizinosaurs were theropods in 1995, and instead considered them a distinct group within saurischia. In 1996, paleontologist Thomas R. Holtz Jr. found therizinosaurs to group with oviraptorosaurs in a phylogenetic analysis of coelurosauria. In 1999, paleontologist Xing Xu and colleagues described a small, basal therizinosauroid from China, \"Beipiaosaurus\", which confirmed that the group belonged among the coelurosaurian theropods, and that similarities with prosauropods had evolved independently. They published the first ever cladogram showing the evolutionary relationships of Therizinosauria, and demonstrated that \"Beipiaosaurus\" had features of more basal theropods, coelurosaurs, and therizinosaurs.\n\nBy the early 21st century, many more therizinosaur taxa had been discovered, including outside Asia (the first being \"Nothronychus\" from North America), as well as various basal taxa that helped understanding of the early evolution of the group (such as \"Falcarius\", also form North America). Therizinosaurs were not considered as rare or aberrant anymore, but more diverse than previously thought (including in size), and their classification as maniraptoran theropods was generally accepted. The placement of Therizinosauria within Maniraptora continued to be unclear; in 2017, paleontologist Alan H. Turner and colleagues found them to group with oviraptorosaurs, while Zanno and collagues found them to be most basal clade within maniraptora in 2009, bracketed by Ornithomimisauria and Alvarezsauridae. Despite the adittional fossil material, the interrelations within the group were also still uncertain by 2010, when Zanno conducted the most detailed phylogenetic analysis of the Therizinosauria until that point. She cited the inaccessibility, damage, potential loss of holotype specimens, scarcity of cranial remains, and fragmentary specimens with few overlapping elements as the most significant obstacles to resolving the evolutionary relationships within the group.\n\nTherizinosaurs spanned a large range of sizes, from the smaller \"Beipiaosaurus\" ( long) and \"Jianchangosaurus\" ( long) to the large-sized long \"Segnosaurus\" and \"Suzhousaurus\". \"Therizinosaurus\" itself, obtained the top dimensions of the group, growing up to long and weighing over , dimensions that make the genus among the largest-known theropods.\n\nTherizinosaurs had a very distinctive, often confusing set of characteristics. Their long necks, wide torsos, and hind feet with four toes used in walking resembled those of basal sauropodomorph dinosaurs. Their unique hip bones, which pointed backwards and were partially fused together, initially reminded paleontologists of the \"bird-hipped\" ornithischians. Among the most striking characteristics of therizinosaurs are the enormous claws on their hands, which reached lengths of around one meter in \"Therizinosaurus\". The unusual range of motion in therizinosaur forelimbs, which allowed them to reach forward to a degree other theropods could not achieve, also supports the idea that they were mainly herbivorous. Therizinosaurs may have used their long reach and strongly curved claws to grasp and shear leafy branches, in a manner similar to large mammals that lived later on, such as chalicotheres, ground sloths, great apes, and giant pandas. Skin impressions from \"Beipiaosaurus\" indicate that therizinosaurs were covered with a coat of primitive, down-like feathers similar to those seen in the compsognathid \"Sinosauropteryx\", as well as longer, simpler, quill-like feathers that may have been used in display.\n\nBarsbold and Perle named the group Segnosauria as an infraorder of Theropoda in 1980. Dong Zhiming went further, placing the segnosaurs in their own order, Segnosaurischia. This name has been abandoned since the discovery that segnosaurs are a specialized group within the suborder Theropoda. Clark et al. 2004 considered Segnosaurischia a synonym of Therizinosauroidea.\n\nThe superfamily Therizinosauroidea had been established by Maleev in 1954, to include only the bizarre, giant-clawed theropod \"Therizinosaurus\". When it was later realized that \"Therizinosaurus\" was an advanced segnosaur, Therizinosauroidea was given a phylogenetic definition to include both groups, and has largely replaced the use of the older name Segnosauria in phylogenetic studies, mainly because of the association of the name Segnosauria with the discredited idea that these animals were relatives of prosauropods.\n\nThe following taxonomy follows Zanno, 2010 unless otherwise noted.\n\n\nThe clade Therizinosauria was first defined by Dale Russell in 1997 as \"Alxasaurus\", \"Enigmosaurus\", \"Erlikosaurus\", \"Nanshiungosaurus\", \"Segnosaurus\", \"Therizinosaurus\", and all taxa closer to them than to oviraptorosaurs, ornithomimids, and troodontids. Paul Sereno, in 2005, modified this definition to the most inclusive clade containing \"Therizinosaurus\" but not \"Ornithomimus\", \"Oviraptor\", \"Shuvuuia\", \"Tyrannosaurus\", or \"Troodon\".\n\nTherizinosauroidea, previously named as a superfamily with no phylogenetic definition, was first defined by Zhang \"et al.\" in 2001, as the clade containing all theropods more closely related to \"Therizinosaurus\" than to birds (effectively replacing the older name Segnosauria, which has not yet been defined as a clade). This definition, however, defines the same group as the pre-existing Therizinosauria. An alternate definition was given by Clark in 2004 (as the last common ancestor of \"Therizinosaurus\" and \"Beipiaosaurus\" and all its descendants), comprising a narrower group that excludes more primitive therizinosaurs, such as \"Falcarius\", and allows the name Therizinosauria to remain in use for the larger group comprising all therizinosaurs. This definition was followed by Teresa Maryańska and Barsbold (2004), Sereno (2005), Zanno \"et al.\" (2009) and Zanno (2010), though other subsequent studies, such as Senter (2007, 2012) have continued to use Therizinosauroidea for the therizinosaur \"total group\".\n\nThe cladogram below follows the extensive phylogenetic analysis of the Therizinosauria by Lindsay E. Zanno in 2010.\nThe following cladogram is based on the phylogenetic analysis by Phil Senter et al. 2012.\nThe cladogram below is the cladogram based on the phylogenetic analysis of Therizinosauria conducted by Hanyong Pu et al. 2013.\nBelow is the recently performed phylogenetic analysis performed by Hartman et al. 2019 using the data provided by Zanno in 2010:\nCT scans published by Stephan Lautenschlager et al. 2012 focused on the skull and brain cavity of \"Erlikosaurus\", revealing it to have a large forebrain, and suggesting it had well developed senses of balance, hearing and smell, all of which would have been useful in evading predators, finding food, or in performing complex social behavior. These senses were also well-developed in earlier coelurosaurs and other theropods, indicating that therizinosaurs may have inherited many of these features from their carnivorous ancestors and used them for their specialized dietary purposes.\n\nDinosaur eggs with embryos of the Dendroolithidae type from the Nanchao Formation were identified as belonging to therizinosaurs based on anatomical features, and described by paleontologist Martin Kundrát and colleagues in 2007. The development of the embryos (their bones were extensiely ossified) and the fact that no adults were found in association with the nests indicate that theirzinosaur hatchlings were precocial, capabale of locomotion from birth, and able to leave their nests to feed alone, independently of their parents. The development of the teeth of the hatchlings was consistent with an omnivorous diet. Subterraneously constructed nests are also indicative of a lack of parental care during the incubation period.\n\nIn a 2013 conference abstract, paleontologist Yoshitsugu Kobayashi and colleagues reported a nesting ground of theropod dinosaurs at the Javkhlant Formation, which contained at least 17 egg clutches from the same layer within an area of 22 m by 52 m. Each clutch contained 8 spherical eggs with rough surfaces which were in contact with each other and arranged in a circular structure without a central opening. Based on microscopical features in the eggshells, the researchers identified the eggs as the type Dendroolithidae, which had previously been attributed to therizinosaurs. Though therizinosaurs are not known from the Javkhlant Formation, it overlies the Bayan Shireh Formation, where \"Segnosaurus\", \"Erlikosaurus\", and \"Enigmosaurus\" were found. The multiple clutches indicate that some therizinosaurs were colonial nesters, like hadrosaurs, prosauropods, titanosaurs, and birds, and the fact that they were found in a single stratigraphic layer suggests the dinosaurs nested at the site on a single occasion, and therefore did not exhibit site fidelity. The discovery was the first record of colonially nesting non-avian theropods from Asia, as well as the largest known non-avian theropod colony.\n\n"}

He stars with his girlfriend of the time, Beverly Aadland.\n\nIt was written and narrated by Flynn, who was sympathetic to the Cuban revolution being led by Fidel Castro in its early phase.\n\nIn his memoir Flynn called it \"an interesting side venture... I spent many days with Fidel just before the Batistans quit.\" \n\nErrol Flynn arrives in Cuba on behalf of the Hearst Press to do a series of articles on the revolution of Fidel Castro. He notices some changes in Cuba caused by the rebellion.\n\nHe checks into a hotel and is contacted by one of Castro's agents, a female, who takes him to a beach resort. He meets a young man who offers to take Errol behind the lines to meet Castro. Flynn flies his own plane, meets the rebels, and files several articles, including one of the Cuban Rebel Girls.\n\nThe movie then goes into the story of two American girls, Beverly and her friend, Jacqueline, whose brother Johnny (Beverly's boyfriend) is fighting for Castro in Cuba. The two girls decide to visit Cuba.\n\nThey take $50,000 raised by American friends of the revolution to be used to buy guns. They visit Key West and then fly to Cuba.\n\n\n\nRights to the movie were bought by Joseph Brenner Associates. Brenner described the film as \"an authentic and non political background drama.\"\n\n\"The New York Times\" said \"Flynn and his associates provide little that is entertaining, artistic, or informative in this largely static, jerry-built independently made adventure ... Mr Flynn cannot be blamed for giving the appearance of being very, very tired throughout these phlegmatic proceedings.\"\n\nThe \"Los Angeles Times\" said the:\n\nOnly interest this picture could possibly have is that is happens to be the last performance by the late Errol Flynn before the movie camera. That, and the fact that it gives the public a chance to see Beverly Aadland for the first time. Both are disappointing ... The storyline is weak and poor direction and editing merely add to the confusion. The remainder of the cast is inconsequential and their acting, if it can be called that, is on a par with the over-all production, which is uniformly bad. It is a sad ending to one of the most flamboyant actors of our times.\n\n\"Filmink\" magazine wrote that the film \"compels interest mostly by virtue of showing Aadland in a lead role, Flynn on death’s door, and the weirdness of such a pro-Castro film (even though he wasn’t a confirmed commie then) coming from a Hollywood movie star.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1846707", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1846707", "title": "MBTA key bus routes", "text": "MBTA key bus routes\n\nKey bus routes of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) system are 15 routes that have high ridership and higher frequency standards than other bus lines, according to the 2004 MBTA Service Policy. Together, they account for roughly 40% of the MBTA's total bus ridership. These key bus routes ensure basic geographic coverage with frequent service in the densest areas of Boston, and connect to other MBTA services to give access to other areas throughout the region.\n\nIn recognition of their function as part of the backbone MBTA service, the key bus routes have been added to newer basic route maps installed in subway stations and other public locations. These schematic route maps show the rail rapid transit routes, bus rapid transit routes, commuter rail services, and key bus routes. The key routes have been treated as a distinct category for the purpose of service improvement, such as trial runs of late-night service, and due to the high volume of passenger traffic they carry, both individual routes and the category as a whole have been the subjects of urban planning and transportation engineering studies. \n\nIn November 2006, the MBTA launched a concerted effort to improve service quality on key bus routes. The 2008 Service Plan recommended improvements for various lines, including upgrading the 31 bus to Key Route standards. A second round of upgrades, entitled the Key Routes Improvement Project and costing $10 million in all, was supported by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The Silver Line services were originally considered part of this program, but were later split off into a separate enhancement project. The initial Key Routes Improvement Project was concluded in 2013, with some planned upgrades not being made. Due to these changes, the reliability of service (as measured by adherence to posted service frequencies) has been found to be greater on the Key Routes than on others, with 75% versus 61% respectively in June 2017.\n\nA 2012 statistical analysis found that proximity to key bus routes was inversely correlated to taxicab trip generation, whereas taxicab trip generation actually increased with proximity to bus routes overall, suggesting that only the routes with highest frequency were able to compete with taxi service among customers with the option to choose.\n\nIn April 2014, extended late-night service on the key bus routes and rapid transit routes was announced, to be operated on a one-year trial basis with service continuation depending on late-night ridership and on corporate sponsorship. , late-night service was cut back from 2:30am to 2:00am, and extended hours were dropped from 5 of the 15 key bus routes. Late-night service was discontinued altogether in March 2016.\n\nThe category of key bus routes figured into Boston mayor Marty Walsh's \"Go Boston 2030\" initiative, which included the goal of having \"every Boston household\" within a 10-minute walk from a T station or a bus stop on a key route. In addition, a new key route has been proposed to connect the Longwood Medical and Academic Area with JFK/UMass station via Roxbury.\n\nThe MBTA's Service Planning unit uses five criteria when determining if a route is part of the Key Bus Routes program.\n\nA bus route that has been identified as a Key Route must adhere to two policy standards: Span of Service and Frequency of Service, both of which mandate service levels well above a standard local route. The following tables outline these standards as compared to standard local routes.\n\nThere are 15 Key Routes within the MBTA system: 1, 15, 22, 23, 28, 32, 39, 57, 66, 71, 73, 77, 111, 116, and 117. Elected officials and members of the public have asked the MBTA for limited-stop or express service along all of these routes.\n\nThe 1 Harvard/Holyoke Gate - Dudley Station via Massachusetts Avenue, which connects Cambridge with Roxbury, was formed in September 1962 when two routes, split at Massachusetts Avenue (now Hynes Convention Center), were merged — the 76 Harvard-Massachusetts Station and the 47 Massachusetts Station-Dudley. In May 1987, the route was realigned from its former alignment on Washington Street southeast several blocks onto Albany Street and Melnea Cass Boulevard to serve Boston Medical Center. The route now runs mostly along Massachusetts Avenue, from Harvard, past the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, over the Charles River via the Harvard Bridge into Boston, past the Berklee College of Music to Boston Medical Center, then southwest to Dudley via Albany Street and Melnea Cass Boulevard.\n\n, the city of Cambridge planned to install signal priority on the #1 route at some intersections.\nThe 15 Kane Square - Ruggles Station via Uphams Corner route runs from Kane Square, several blocks west of Savin Hill, west on Hancock Street and Dudley Street past Uphams Corner to Dudley, continuing west on Malcolm X Boulevard to Roxbury Crossing and north on Tremont Street to Ruggles station. Buses started running on the 15 Kane Square-Dudley via Uphams Corner and Dudley Street route on April 6, 1962, replacing trackless trolleys. With the relocation of the Orange Line to the Southwest Corridor in May 1987, the route was extended to Ruggles.\n\nThe 22 Ashmont Station - Ruggles Station via Talbot Avenue & Jackson Square begins at Ashmont and runs on a northwesterly route to the former site of Egleston station. From there it continues north on Columbus Avenue and Tremont Street along the course of the Orange Line before ending at Ruggles.\n\nBuses replaced trackless trolleys on the 22 on April 6, 1962, running as the 22 Ashmont-Dudley via Talbot and Warren. This route, rather than turning off Blue Hill Avenue onto Seaver Street, continued north a bit further and then went north on Warren Street to end at Dudley Street Terminal. It was extended to Ruggles in May 1987 along with the relocation of the Orange Line to the Southwest Corridor.\n\nThe 23 Ashmont Station - Ruggles Station via Washington Street has the same endpoints as the 22, but uses a mostly different route. It starts out of Ashmont on Talbot Avenue, but turns north on Washington Street, following that onto Warren Street to Dudley. From Dudley the 23 heads west on Malcolm X Boulevard to Roxbury Crossing and north on Tremont Street to Ruggles station.\n\nBuses replaced trackless trolleys on April 7, 1962 on the 22 Ashmont-Dudley via Washington Street and Warren. It was extended to Ruggles in May 1987 along with the relocation of the Orange Line to the Southwest Corridor.\n\nA 2017 study of fare-card and vehicle-location data suggested that the 23 and 28 routes were overcrowded, and that this could be ameliorated by extending the 29 route and increasing its service frequency.\n\nThe 28 Mattapan Station - Ruggles Station via Dudley Station route provides service through the Grove Hall and Mattapan neighborhoods on Blue Hill Avenue, a major radial arterial. Blue Hill Avenue has long been a busy trunk route; in 1945, route 29 Mattapan-Egleston peaked at 1.5 minute headways during the morning rush hour. Streetcars formerly had a dedicated right-of-way on Blue Hill Avenue; streetcars were moved into mixed traffic in stages between 1940 and 1950, and replaced with busses in 1955. With the May 1987 changes to the bus network, route 28 was established to supplement route 29 service; both ran from Mattapan to Ruggles via different routings. In December 1989, route 28 became the dominant service on Blue Hill Avenue, and route 29 was relegated to a rush-hour-only route running only to Jackson Square. From December 2006 to June 2010, short turn service between Franklin Park and Dudley (Ruggles after March 2007) was operated in the morning peak as route 25.\n\nA number of Silver Line expansion corridors were considered in the 2003 Program for Mass Transportation (PMT); most were given brief consideration but not acted upon. One, a bus rapid transit (BRT) express overlay for the 28, was briefly revived in 2006 as part of Silver Line Phase III plans. In 2009, the state proposed to add a limited-stop BRT line called the 28X on the corridor, which was then the busiest bus corridor in New England. The plan called for dedicated bus lanes on Blue Hill Avenue and queue jumps on Warren Avenue. The project was expected to cost $114 million. Construction was to begin in April 2010, with initial service at the beginning of 2012. \n\nHowever, the proposal quickly drew opposition: it had been announced at a press conference by state officials without local officials having even been informed of the project, leading to accusations that the plan was rushed to qualify for TIGER grant funding without community input. Residents also objected because the dedicated bus lanes would require removing parking spots and the median strip, and the construction process would disrupt traffic on Blue Hill Avenue for over a year. The state withdrew the proposal in late 2009. In June 2010, the MBTA replaced 40-foot buses on the route with 60-foot buses; although the swap added capacity on the busy route, residents objected to the removal of some bus stops in hilly Grove Hall to accommodate the longer vehicles. In 2012, the Roxbury-Dorcester-Mattapan Transit Needs Study recommended the 28X bus to be implemented with no new infrastructure as an express bus adding additional trips to the corridor.\n\nThe 32 Wolcott Square - Forest Hills Station via Hyde Park Avenue routes runs along Hyde Park Avenue from Forest Hills to Readville, serving Jamaica Plain, Roslindale, and Hyde Park. It parallels the commuter rail tracks from Forest Hills to Readville for its entire route.\n\nUp until 1953, Route 32 was a full-service trolley route from Forest Hills to Cleary Square, until it converted to trackless trolleys. In 1958, all trackless trolley services south of Forest Hills were discontinued and replaced by diesel buses. (The trolleys ended in the middle of Hyde Park Ave; however, a loop for the trackless trolleys to turn around was placed on Hyde Park Avenue and Pine St.)\n\nIn 1981, the former Route 31 bus route between Mattapan Square and Wolcott Square was consolidated with Route 32 at Cleary Sq to become Route 32 Forest Hills-Wolcott Square. Route 50, which served Cleary Square and Forest Hills via Roslindale, was rerouted onto River St, Gordon Avenue, Summer St (inbound) and Austin St (outbound) to serve the Summer St Elderly Housing Area (aka Malone Elderly Housing).\nThe 39 Forest Hills - Back Bay via Huntington Avenue route is the replacement (described as \"temporary\" from 1985 until 2011) for Green Line \"E\" Branch service from Heath Street to Arborway which has run since December 1985. Aside from paralleling the Green Line from Heath Street to Copley, there are connections to the Orange Line and commuter rail at both ends (and Amtrak at the latter). Route 39 was the first MBTA route to regularly use articulated buses, which were later introduced to several other routes (including the #28) in late 2005. , the 39 was the second most heavily used bus line in the city. The high ridership of the 39 was one motivation for expanding the Forest Hills station during the Casey Arborway overhaul.\n\nThe 57 Watertown Yard - Kenmore Station route passes through Boston, Newton and Watertown. It is the replacement for the Green Line \"A\" Branch service which was discontinued in 1969. Route 57 was formerly one of the few routes that ran limited-stop service in the Boston city limits (no pickups were made on Commonwealth Avenue between Packard's Corner and Kenmore), but this practice was discontinued in December 2006.\n\nThe 66 Harvard Square - Dudley Station via Allston & Brookline Village route, formerly a trolley line, begins at Dudley Square in Roxbury, and crosses the Southwest Corridor Park at Roxbury Crossing. The route follows Route 39 and the Green Line \"E\" Branch on a short segment from Brigham Circle to the Boston city limits. Traveling via Harvard Street, this bus serves Brookline and Allston, diverting to Union Square (Allston) before following Cambridge Street and North Harvard Street and terminating at Harvard Square, Cambridge. It connects Dudley Station on the Silver Line to Roxbury Crossing on the Orange Line; as well as Fenwood Rd, Mission Park, and Riverway on the Green Line \"E\" Branch; Brookline Village on the Green Line \"D\" Branch; Coolidge Corner on the Green Line \"C\" Branch; Harvard Ave on the Green Line \"B\" Branch; and Harvard on the Red Line.\nThe 71 Watertown Square - Harvard Station via Mt. Auburn Street and 73 Waverley Square - Harvard Station via Trapelo Road are a pair of trackless trolley routes which run out of the Harvard Bus Tunnel. They represent some of the last vestiges of Boston's once-extensive trolley and trackless trolley network. (The preservation of these lines has been attributed to the environmentalist movement of the 1970s.) Both cover parts of Mount Auburn Street; the trolleys are also used on the 72 route and the 77A route to North Cambridge.\n\nIn 2017, the 71 and 73 were selected for a bus rapid transit pilot program.\n\nThe 73 Waverley Square - Harvard Station via Trapelo Road begins in the Harvard Bus Tunnel and runs concurrent with the 71 bus along Mount Auburn Street in Cambridge and Watertown. The route 73 bus splits with the route 71 bus, and travels along Belmont Street and Trapelo Road in Watertown and Belmont.\n\nUntil the 1950s, streetcars served this route. Starting in 1957, trackless trolleys provided short-turn service from Harvard to Benton Square. The entirety of Route 73 was converted from streetcars to trackless trolleys in 1958. The Benton Square short-turn service ended in 1970. The new Harvard Bus Tunnel was completed in 1985.\n\nThe 77 Arlington Heights - Harvard Station via Massachusetts Avenue route provides service between the town of Arlington and Harvard Station along Massachusetts Avenue. The 77A short turn routing, which terminates at North Cambridge Carhouse instead of Arlington Heights, is used to transport 71 and 73 trolleybuses to/from Harvard Square at the beginning and end of service. \n\nUntil the Red Line Northwest Extension opened in the 1980s, routes 77/77A provided the bulk of transit service northwest of Harvard, with combined streetcar headways under one minute during rush hours in 1945. Route 77 was converted to diesel bus in 1955; route 77A was converted to trolleybus in 1958 to free up streetcars for the upcoming Highland Branch conversion, and so that boarding islands on Massachusetts Avenue could be removed to benefit automobiles. Route 77A formerly provided all local service south of the carhouse, with route 77 making limited stops on that segment; however, it was largely replaced by route 77 service in stages from 1998 to 2005. In 2017, Arlington applied for a private grant to add signal priority, queue jumps, and possibly bus lanes on their section of the route.\n\nThe 111 Woodlawn or Broadway & Park Ave. - Haymarket Station via Mystic River/Tobin Bridge provides a route between downtown Boston and parts of Chelsea, via the Charlestown Bridge and the Tobin Bridge. (Some trips continue east as far as Revere.) When the Boston Elevated Railway bought the route in 1936, it ran as streetcars between Chelsea Square and Woodlawn. On October 10, 1936, the line was replaced by an extension of the City Square - Chelsea Square bus route. The line was extended in April 1975 to Haymarket after the closure of the Charlestown Elevated; the partial extension beyond Woodlawn was done in January 2001.\n\nThe 111 is among the most frequent numbered MBTA bus routes, with service running every 5 minutes during rush hour.\n\nThe 116 Wonderland Station - Maverick Station via Revere Street and 117 Wonderland Station - Maverick Station via Beach Street serve East Boston, and the cities of Chelsea and Revere. The 116 and 117 share most of their routes through East Boston and Revere, differing only on the northern end near Wonderland. They operate on 20-minute headways during peak hours, for an effective 10-minute combined headway on the shared segment on Meridian Street and Broadway.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1846735", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1846735", "title": "Sister Nivedita", "text": "Sister Nivedita\n\nSister Nivedita ( ; born Margaret Elizabeth Noble; 28 October 1867 – 13 October 1911) was an Irish teacher, author, social activist, school founder and disciple of Swami Vivekananda. She spent her childhood and early youth in Ireland. From her father, a college professor, she learned the ideal of service to mankind as the true service to God. She worked as a school teacher and later also opened a school. She was engaged to marry a Welsh youth, but he died soon after their engagement.\nSister Nivedita met Swami Vivekananda in 1895 in London and travelled to Calcutta (present-day Kolkata), India in 1898. Swami Vivekananda gave her the name \"Nivedita\" (meaning \"Dedicated to God\") when he initiated her into the vow of \"Brahmacharya\" on 25 March 1898. In November 1898, she opened a girls' school in the Bagbazar area of Calcutta. She wanted to educate girls who were deprived of even basic education. During the plague epidemic in Calcutta in 1899, Nivedita nursed and took care of the poor patients.\nNivedita had close associations with the newly established Ramakrishna Mission. Because of her active contribution in the field of Indian Nationalism, she had to publicly dissociate herself from the activities of the Ramakrishna Mission under the then president Swami Brahmananda. She was very close to Sarada Devi, the spiritual consort of Ramakrishna and one of the major influences behind Ramakrishna Mission, and also with all brother disciples of Swami Vivekananda. She died on 13 October 1911 in Darjeeling. Her epitaph reads, \"Here lies Sister Nivedita who gave her all to India\".\n\nMargaret Elizabeth Noble was born on 28 October 1867 in the town of Dungannon in County Tyrone, Ireland to Mary Isabel and Samuel Richmond Noble; she was named for her paternal grandmother. The Nobles were of Scottish descent, settled in Ireland for about five centuries. Her father, who was a pastor, taught that service to mankind is the true service to God. The Nobles had six children of whom only Margaret (the eldest), May, and Richmond survived.\n\nWhen Margaret was one year old Samuel moved to Manchester, England; there he enrolled as a theological student of the Wesleyan Church. Young Margaret stayed with her maternal grandfather, Hamilton, in Ireland.\n\nWhen she was four years old she returned to live with her parents at Great Torrington in Devonshire. Margaret was her father's favorite child. When Samuel Noble conducted services or visited the poor, she accompanied him.\n\nMargaret's father died in 1877 when she was ten years old. Margaret with her mother and two siblings returned to her grandfather Hamilton's home in Ireland. Margaret's mother, Mary took up a kindergarten course in London and became a teacher. Later, Mary helped her father to run a guest-house near Belfast. Hamilton was one of the first-ranking leaders of the freedom movement of Ireland. Besides her father's religious temperament, Margaret imbibed the spirit of freedom and love for her country through her grandfather Hamilton.\n\nMargaret was educated at Halifax College, run by a member of the Congregationalist Church. The headmistress of this college taught her about personal sacrifice. She studied subjects, including physics, arts, music, and literature.\n\nAt the age of seventeen in 1884, she first started a career in teaching at a school in Keswick. In 1886, she went to Rugby to teach in an orphanage. A year later, she took up a post at the coal-mining area Wrexham in North Wales. Here, she revived her spirit of service and love for the poor which she had inherited from her father. At Wrexham, Margaret became engaged to be married to a Welsh youth who died soon after the engagement. In 1889, Margaret moved to Chester. By this time, her sister May and brother Richmond were living in Liverpool. Soon, their mother Mary joined them. Margaret was happy to be reunited with her family. Occasionally, she went to Liverpool to stay with them.\n\nMargaret resumed her studies in the field of education. She became acquainted with the ideas of the Swiss education reformer Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi and with the German Friedrich Fröbel. Both Pestalozzi and Froebel emphasized the importance of preschool education. They opined that education should begin by gratifying and cultivating the normal aptitude of the child for exercise, play, observation, imitation, and construction. A group of teachers in England was attracted to this novel method of teaching and they tried to put it into practice. Thus, the 'New Education' was advocated and Margaret, too, became a part of it. Soon, she became a favourite writer and speaker at the Sunday Club and the Liverpool Science Club.\n\nIn 1891, Margaret settled in Wimbledon and helped a Mrs. de Leeuw, to start a new school in London. The new experiment in teaching gave her great joy. After a year, in 1892, Margaret started her own independent school at Kingsleygate. At her school, there were no restrictive set methods and formal learning. Children learned through play. At this time, Margaret learned to be a critic of art from one of her staff teachers, Ebenezer Cooke, a well-known art master and reformer of art education.\n\nAs she gained mastery as an educator, she also became a prolific writer in paper and periodicals and a popular speaker. Soon she became a name among the intellectuals of London and became acquainted with some of the most learned and influential people of her time. Among them were Lady Ripon and Lady Isabel Margesson. They were the founders of a literary coterie, which came to be known as the Sesame Club. \"The Times of London\" of 26 October 1911, wrote about Margaret, \"A trained teacher of exceptional gifts, she was one of a group of educationists who in the early nineties founded the Sesame Club.\" Famous writers, such as Bernard Shaw and Thomas Huxley, were some of the regular speakers at the Sesame Club. Discussions were held here on literature, ethics, politics, and other similar subjects.\n\nIn 1892, when the Home Rule Bill for Ireland was before the Parliament, Margaret spoke fearlessly in favor of it.\n\nComing from a religious background, Margaret had learned Christian religious doctrines from young. From childhood, she had learned to venerate all religious teachings. The Baby Jesus was her object of adoration and worship. However, as she bloomed into womanhood, doubt in the Christian doctrines crept in. She found the teachings were incompatible with Truth. As these doubts became stronger, her faith in Christianity was shaken. For seven long years, Margaret was unable to settle her mind and this led to unhappiness. She tried to absorb herself in church service. However, her troubled soul could not find satisfaction and she longed for Truth.\n\nSearch for truth made Margaret take up the study of natural science. Later, in a lecture delivered at the Hindu Ladies' Social Club in Bombay in 1902, she said:\n\nIn November 1895, she met Swami Vivekananda for the first time, who had come from America to visit London and stayed there for three months. On a cold afternoon, Swami Vivekananda was explaining in the drawing room of an aristocratic family in London. Lady Isabel Margesson, a friend of Margaret, invited Ebenezer Cooke, who was part of the teaching staff at Margaret's 'Ruskin School', to this meeting. Margaret went with him, with much curiosity and interest.\nMargaret did not know this evening would change her life completely. Margaret described her experience of the occasion. \"A majestic personage, clad in a saffron gown and wearing a red waistband, sat there on the floor, cross-legged. As he spoke to the company, he recited Sanskrit verses in his deep, sonorous voice.\" Margaret had already delved deeply into the teachings of the East, and the novelty was not what she heard on this occasion, but the personality of Swamiji himself. She attended several other lectures by Swami Vivekananda. She asked a lot of questions, and his answers dispelled her doubts and established her faith and reverence for the speaker.\n\nNivedita wrote in 1904 to a friend about her decision to follow Swami Vivekananda as a result of her meeting him in England in November 1895:\n\nShe started taking interest in the teachings of Gautama Buddha, and her discussions with Swami Vivekananda were an alternate source of peace and benediction. She wrote:\nVivekananda's principles and teachings influenced her and this brought about a visible change in her. Seeing the fire and passion in her, Swami Vivekananda could foresee her future role in India. 25 March 1898, was the holiest and most unforgettable day of Nivedita's (Margaret) life. That was the day on which her guru dedicated her to God and to the service of India.\n\nSwami Vivekananda was deeply pained by the wretchedness and misery of the people of India under the British rule and his opinion was that education was the panacea for all evils plaguing the contemporary Indian society, especially that of Indian women. Margaret was chosen for the role of educating Indian women. In his letter to Margaret, Vivekananda wrote, \"Let me tell you frankly that I am now convinced that you have a great future in the work for India. What was wanted was not a man but a woman, a real lioness, to work for the Indians, women especially.\"\n\nResponding to Swami Vivekananda's call, Margaret travelled to India, leaving behind her friends and family, including her mother. \"Mombasa\", the ship bringing Margaret to India, reached Calcutta on 28 January 1898. On 22 February, Margaret visited Dakshineshwar temple, the place where Ramakrishna did his \"sadhana\".\nSwami Vivekananda devoted the initial few days in teaching her about India and its people, and helping her develop the love for the people; he was broadening her character. He explained India's history, philosophy, literature, the life of the common mass, social traditions, and also the lives of great personalities, both ancient and modern, to her. A few weeks later, two of Swami Vivekananda's women disciples in America, Sara C. Bull, wife of famous Norwegian violinist and composer Ole Bull and Josephine MacLeod arrived in India. The three became lifelong friends.\nOn 11 March 1898, Swami Vivekananda organized a public meeting at Star Theatre to introduce Sister Nivedita to the people of Calcutta. In his speech, Swami Vivekananda said – \"England has sent us another gift in Miss Margaret Noble.\" In this meeting, Margaret expressed her desire to serve India and its people.\nOn 17 March she met Sarada Devi who greeted Margaret affectionately as \"Khooki\" (i.e. little girl).\n\nOn 25 March 1898, at Nilambar Mukherjee Garden, Swami Vivekananda formally initiated Margaret in the vow of Brahmacharya (lifelong celibacy) and gave her the name of \"Nivedita\", the dedicated one. Swami Vivekananda said to her \"Go thou and follow Him, Who was born and gave His life for others five hundred times before He attained the vision of the Buddha.\"\n\nThough Sister Nivedita expressed her desire to take the ultimate vow of Sannyasa, Swami Vivekananda did not approve of it. Later, after the demise of Swami Vivekananda, on 28 July 1902, Nivedita wrote to the Editor of the \"Statesman\" the following letter:\n\nSwami Vivekananda was anxious to mold Nivedita as a Hindu Brahmacharini. He wanted her to be a Hindu in thoughts and actions. He encouraged her to visit Hindu ladies to observe their way of life. He told her:\n\nWithin a few days of her arrival in India, on 17 March 1898, Margaret met Sarada Devi, wife and spiritual consort of Ramakrishna, who, surpassing all language and cultural barriers, embraced her as \"khooki\" or \"little girl\" in Bengali. It was St.Patrick's Day, a very holy & special day in Margaret's life, and Nivedita recounted it as her \"day of days.\" Until her death in 1911, Nivedita remained one of the closest associates of Sarada Devi. On 13 November 1898, the Holy Mother Sarada Devi came to open Nivedita's newly founded school. After worshiping Ramakrishna she consecrated the school and blessed it, saying: ‘I pray that the blessings of the Divine Mother may be upon the school and the girls; and the girls trained from the school may become ideal girls.’ Nivedita was delighted and recorded her feelings later as \"I cannot imagine a grander omen than her blessings, spoken over the educated Hindu womanhood of the future.\" The first photograph of Sarada Devi was taken at Nivedita's house.\nNivedita wrote in a letter to her friend Nell Hammond about Sarada Devi after her first few meetings with her, \"She really is, under the simplest, most unassuming guise, one of the strongest and greatest of women.\"\nAn excerpt is provided here from the Gospel of Holy Mother, where Sarada Devi's impressions about Nivedita are captured vividly:\n\nNivedita travelled to many places in India, including Kashmir, with Swami Vivekananda, Josephine Mcleod, and Sara Bull. This helped her in connecting to the Indian masses, Indian culture, and its history. She also went to the United States to raise awareness and get help for her cause. On 11 May 1898, she went with Swami Vivekananda, Sara Bull, Josephine MacLeod, and Swami Turiyananda, on a journey to the Himalayas. From Nainital, they travelled to Almora. On 5 June 1898, she wrote a letter to her friend Nell Hammond exclaiming, \"\"Oh Nell, Nell, India is indeed the Holy Land\".\" In Almora, she first learned the art of meditation. She wrote about this experience, \"A mind must be brought to change its centre of gravity... again the open and disinterested state of mind welcomes truth.\" She also started learning Bengali from Swami Swarupananda.\nFrom Almora, they went to Kashmir valley where they stayed in houseboats. In the summer of 1898, Nivedita travelled to Amarnath with Swami Vivekananda. Later in 1899 she travelled to the United States with Swami Vivekananda and stayed in Ridgely Manor in upstate New York.\n\nShe later recorded some of her tour and experiences with her master (guru) in the book \"The Master as I Saw Him\" and \"Notes on Some Wanderings with Swami Vivekananda\".\n\nShe often used to refer to Swami Vivekananda as \"The King\" and considered herself as his spiritual daughter (\"Manaskanya\" in Bengali).\n\nSister Nivedita saw Swami Vivekananda for the last time on 2 July 1902 at Belur Math. Vivekananda was observing the Ekadashi fasting on that day. However, when his disciples took their meal, he himself served them joyfully. After the meal, Vivekananda poured water over Nivedita's hands, and dried them with a towel. Nivedita recorded it in \"The Master As I Saw Him\" in the following words: \nSwami Vivekananda died at 9:10 p.m. on 4 July 1902. On that night, Nivedita dreamed Sri Ramakrishna was leaving his body a second time. On the next morning, Swami Saradananda from Belur Math sent a monk with a letter to Sister Nivedita and conveying the message of Vivekananda's death. Instantly everything around Nivedita's eyes became blank. She immediately rushed to the \"Math\" and reached the place around 7 a.m and entered the room of Vivekananda. There she found Swamiji's body was laid on the floor. She sat near Vivekananda's head and fanned his body with a hand fan until his body was taken down at 2 p.m. to the porch leading to the courtyard.\nIn the afternoon of 5 July, Swami Vivekananda's body was taken for cremation. Vivekananda's body was wrapped in a saffron cloth. Nivedita wished to take a small portion of that cloth so that she could send it as a memento to Josephine MacLeod. Understanding the mind of Nivedita Swami Saradananda asked her to cut a small portion of the Swami's cloth. But, Nivedita was unsure whether the act would be proper or not and decided not to take it. When Vivekananda's body was being cremated she sat all the while looking at the burning pyre. Around six o'clock in the evening, the burning flame was about to go out. Suddenly Nivedita felt somebody had pulled her sleeve. She turned around and found a small piece of saffron cloth which had somehow come out of the pyre during cremation. Nivedita lifted and took the cloth considering it as a message from the Swami. In her letter to Josephine MacLeod on 14 September 1902, Nivedita wrote:\n\nNivedita was planning to open a school for girls who were deprived of even basic education. She toured England and America on a lecture tour designed to raise monies to establish a girls school.\n\nThe main reason why Swamiji invited Nivedita to India was to spread education to the women of the country. This is why, when Nivedita informed Vivekananda about her planning, he felt very excited. He organized a meeting at Balaram Bose's house on this issue. Many lay devotees of Sri Ramakrishna, including Mahendranath Gupta ( popularly known as Sri M., the chronicler of \"The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna\"), Suresh Dutta, Haramohan etc. attended this meeting. In this meeting, Nivedita explained her plan of the proposed school and requested everyone to send their girls to the school to study. During her speech, Vivekananda entered the room and took a seat behind everyone. Nivedita did not notice it. But, when Nivedita appealed to collect girl students for the school, she suddenly discovered Vivekananda in the room pushing others and prompting – \"Ye, get up, get up! It’s not good enough to just become girls’ fathers. All of you must cooperate in the matter of their education as per national ideals. Stand up and commit. Reply to her appeal. Say, 'We all agree. We shall send our girls to you.'\" But no one stood up to support Nivedita's proposal. Finally, Vivekananda forced Haramohan to agree to the proposal and behalf of Haramohan Vivekananda promised to send her girls to the school.\n\nOn 13 November 1898, on the day of \"Kali Puja\", at 16 Bosepara Lane in the Bagbazar area of Calcutta, she started the school. The school was inaugurated by Sarada Devi, in the presence of Swami Vivekananda and some of the other disciples of Ramakrishna. Sarada Devi blessed and prayed for the school saying – \"I pray that the blessings of the Divine Mother may be upon the school and the girls; and the girls trained from the school may become ideal girls.\"\nNivedita went from home to home in educating girls, many of whom were in pitiable condition owing to the socio-economic condition of early 20th century India. In many cases, she encountered refusal from the male members of the girl's family. Nivedita had widows and adult women among her students. She taught sewing, elementary rules of hygiene, nursing, etc., apart from regular courses.\n\nCollecting money for the school was not an easy task. She had to earn money from her writings and giving lectures and later she spent all to meet the expenses of the school.\n\nShe took part in altruistic activities. She worked to improve the lives of Indian women of all castes.\n\nDuring the outbreak of a plague epidemic in Calcutta in 1899, Nivedita nursed and took care of the patients, cleaned rubbish from the area, and inspired and motivated many youths to render voluntary service. She inserted appeals for help in the English newspapers and requested for financial support for her plague relief activities. She also organized the day-to-day activities, inspected the work and personally handed over the written instructions for the preventive measures by moving around.\nShe was a friend to many intellectuals and artists in the Bengali community, including Rabindranath Tagore, Jagadish Chandra Bose, Abala Bose, and Abanindranath Tagore. Later she took up the cause of Indian independence. Sri Aurobindo was one of her friends as well.\n\nShe took an active interest in promoting Indian history, culture, and science. She actively encouraged Dr. Jagadish Chandra Bose, the Indian scientist and philosopher to pursue original scientific research and helped him financially as well in getting due recognition when he was faced with an indifferent attitude of the British Government. Bose, whom she called \"khoka\" or the \"little one\" in Bengali, and his wife Abala Bose, were in very close terms with her. Keeping in view Nivedita's contribution to the scientific research work of Jagadish Chandra, Rabindranath Tagore said: \"In the day of his success, Jagadish gained an invaluable energizer and helper in Sister Nivedita, and in any record of his life’s work her name must be given a place of honour.\"\nHer identity as both a westerner by birth and a disciple of Swami Vivekananda enabled her to do several things that might have been difficult for Indians. For example, she promoted pan-Indian nationalism.\n\nNivedita was a prolific writer and extensively toured India to deliver lectures, especially on India's culture and religion. She appealed to the Indian youth to work selflessly for the cause of the motherland along the ideals of Swami Vivekananda. Initially, Nivedita, like contemporary intellectuals from Europe, was optimistic about British rule in India and believed that it was possible for India and England to love each other. However, in the course of her stay, she came to witness the brutal side of the British rule, the repression and oppression and the division between the ruling elite and the ruled; she concluded that it was necessary for India to gain independence to prosper. Therefore, she devoted herself wholeheartedly to the cause of opposing the British rule. In February 1902, Mahatma Gandhi, or Mr.M.K.Gandhi as he was known then, visited Nivedita in Calcutta.\n\nAfter Vivekananda's death, being acutely aware of the inconvenience of the newly formed Ramakrishna Mission on account of her political activities, she publicly dissociated herself from it. However, until her last days, she had a very cordial relationship with the brother disciples of Swami Vivekananda like Swami Brahmananda, Baburam Maharaj (Swami Premananda) and Swami Saradananda, who helped her in her charitable and educational activities in every possible way; she was very close to the holy mother, Sarada Devi.\n\nNivedita had initially worked with Okakura of Japan and Sarala Ghoshal who was related to the Tagore family.\n\nShe later started working on her own and maintained a direct relationship with many of the young revolutionaries of Bengal, including those of Anushilan Samity, a secret organization. She inspired many youths in taking up the cause of freeing India through her lectures. She also exposed Lord Curzon after his speech at the University of Calcutta in 1905 where he mentioned that truth was given a higher place in the moral codes of the West, than in East. She undertook her own research and made it public that in the book \"Problems of The Far East\" by Curzon she had proudly described how he had given false statements about his age and marriage to the president of the Korean Foreign Office to win his favour. This statement when published in newspapers like \"Amrita Bazar Patrika\" and \"The Statesman\" caused a furore and forced Curzon to apologize.\n\nIn 1905 the British Government under Curzon initiated the partition of Bengal which was a major turning point in the Indian independence movement. Nivedita played a pioneering role in organizing the movement. She provided financial and logistical support and leveraged her contacts to get information from government agencies and forewarn the revolutionaries.\nShe met Indian artists like Abanindranath Tagore, Ananda Coomaraswamy and Havell and inspired them to develop pure Indian school of art. She always inspired and guided the talented students of the Calcutta Art School to move along the forgotten tracks of ancient Indian art like Nandalal Bose, Asit Kumar Haldar and Surendranath Gangopadhyay. She exerted great influence on famous Tamil poet, Subrahmanya Bharati, who met her only briefly in 1906. She influenced Bharathi to work for the freedom of women in the country, which he did all through his life Nivedita designed the national flag of India with the thunderbolt as the emblem against a red background.\nNivedita tried her utmost to inculcate the nationalist spirit in the minds of her students through all their daily activities. She introduced singing of the song Vande Màtaram in her school as a prayer.\nNivedita provided guarded support to Annie Besant and was very close to Aurobindo Ghosh (later Sri Aurobindo), one of the major contributors towards the early nationalist movement. She edited \"Karma Yogin\", the nationalist newspaper of Aurobindo.\nThe following piece is from an editorial in \"Karma Yogin\", written by Nivedita, which depicts her intense respect for India:\n\nNivedita died on 13 October 1911, aged 43, at Roy Villa, Darjeeling. Today, her memorial is located below the Railway station on the way to the Victoria Falls (of Darjeeling) with these words inscribed in her epitaph – \"Here lies Sister Nivedita who gave her all to India\".\nSwami Vivekananda wrote a poem to Sister Nivedita, \"A benediction to Sister Nivedita\". In this poem, Vivekananda condensed all his hopes, aspirations, and good wishes for his disciple, Nivedita as \"The mistress, servant, friend in one to India's future son\"–\n<poem>\nThe mother's heart, the hero's will\nThe sweetness of the southern breeze,\nThe sacred charm and strength that dwell\nOn Aryan altars, flaming, free;\nAll these be yours and many more \nNo ancient soul could dream before-\nBe thou to India's future son\nThe mistress, servant, friend in one.\n</poem>\n\nSister Nivedita remains one of the most influential female figures of India. Her book \"Kali, the Mother\" influenced Abanindranath Tagore who painted Bharat Mata. In 2010, the office of the board of West Bengal Board of Secondary Education in Salt Lake City, Kolkata was named after Sister Nivedita. The Sister Nivedita Academy, an institution dedicated to her memory has been established in Chennai, Tamil Nadu. Several schools and colleges have been named after her. In 1968, the Indian Government issued a postal stamp in her memory. The Nivedita bridge near Dakhineswer, Kolkata is named in her honour. In 2015, a new Government Degree College at Hastings House, Alipur, Kolkata was named after Sister Nivedita.\n\nSister Nivedita was one of the important influences on Jagadish Chandra Bose. She supported him by organizing the financial support and editing his manuscripts, she made sure that Bose was able to continue with and share his work.\n\nHer works included \"The Web of Indian Life\", which sought to rectify many myths in the Western world about Indian culture and customs, \"Kali the Mother\", \"The Master as I Saw Him\" on Swami Vivekananda, \"Notes of Some Wanderings with the Swami Vivekananda\" on her travels from Nainital, Almora and other places with Swamiji, \"The Cradle Tales of Hinduism\" on the stories from Puranas, Ramayana and Mahabharata, \"Studies from an Eastern Home\", \"Civil Ideal and Indian Nationality, Hints on National Education in India\", \"Glimpses of Famine and Flood in East Bengal—1906\".\n\n\nA newly annotated edition of \"The Ancient Abbey of Ajanta\", that was serialized in \"The Modern Review\" during 1910 and 1911, was published in 2009 by Lalmati, Kolkata, with annotations, additions, and photographs by Prasenjit Dasgupta and Soumen Paul. Another collection of essays relating to Buddhism has been published by New Age Publishers of Kolkata titled \"Studies in Buddhism\", that has been compiled and annotated by Prasenjit Dasgupta and Soumen Paul.\n\nIn 1952, Ramakrishna Mission Sister Nivedita Girls' School during its Golden Jubilee Celebration, decided to bring out a biography of Sister Nivedita in English and Bengali. Though there were some biographies in English and Bengali before this, they lack in historical facts. The historical account of Sister Nivedita's life in Bengali was written by Pravrajika Muktiprana of Sri Sarada Math and was published in 1959. The materials for the biographies were sourced from Sister Nivedita's own works, letters and diaries, references made to her by some of her contemporaries, and interviews with those who had worked with her and her own students. Later, in 1961, the English version of the book written by Pravrajika Atmaprana was published as \"Sister Nivedita of Ramakrishna-Vivekananda\". Since then, the books had seen several revisions.\n\n\"Letters of Sister Nivedita\" were first published in two volumes in 1960. There were more than 800 letters, half of which were written to Miss Josephine MacLeod. These letters vibrant with her thoughts and feelings cast a lot of light on the versatile genius of Nivedita.\n\nIn 1975, Barbara Fox published in London a biography of Sister Nivedita titled \"Long Journey Home\". This work attempt to gauge Nivedita's work from an English woman's point of view.\n\n\"Nivedita Lokmata\" in Bengali was published in three volumes by Sankari Prasad Basu in 1968, 1987, and 1988 respectively.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Off-reservation holdings are located across the state in Douglas County, in the northwest corner of Wisconsin. The total land area of these tribal lands is . It is the land-base for the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa. Before the establishment of this reservation, the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa were located at the head of Lake Superior, closer to the mouth of the Saint Louis River, where Duluth has developed.\n\nThe tribe ceded land to the US as part of an 1837 treaty along with other Ojibwa bands; the lands were located mainly from east-central Minnesota to north-central Wisconsin. Later, as part of the Treaty of La Pointe in 1842, the Fond du Lac Band and other Ojibwa tribes ceded large tracts of land located mainly in the Lake Superior watershed in Wisconsin and the western Upper Peninsula of Michigan. As part of an 1854 treaty, the tribe and the Lake Superior Band of Chippewa (largely situated along the northern shore of Lake Superior in Minnesota) ceded more land to the US.\n\nUnder this 1854 treaty, the US established the Fond du Lac Indian Reservation farther up the Saint Louis River, at its present location. The original \"Nagaajiwanaang\" Reservation was 1.25 times the current size. In treaty discussions the US representatives were recorded as promising the inclusion of the Perch and Big lakes, but these were excluded from the original reservation. Its boundaries extended westward to the western boundaries of the 1854 Ceded Territory. Upon appeal by the tribe, the US extended the reservation boundaries southward to include the two said lakes, but as a concession, the tribe had to agree to a reduction in the western boundaries, which were placed at the current location.\n\nIt also established a reservation for the Lake Superior Band of Chippewa.\n\nThe FDL adopted a written constitution with an elected government. Its tribal council has x members, who serve staggered terms.\n\nThe FDL operates social services, tribal housing, a tribal police force, a natural resource building, a gas station, three community centers, and a private health clinic and pharmacy called \"Min No Aya Win\" Health Center. The tribe also operates two satellite health clinics, one in Duluth, named The Center for American Indian Resources (CAIR), and another in Minneapolis, the \"Mashkiki Waakaaigan\" Pharmacy (Medicine House). It has numerous members who live in these urban areas.\n\nThe tribe owns two casinos: Black Bear Casino in Carlton, Minnesota and Fond du Luth Casino in Duluth.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Their land base is the Fond du Lac Indian Reservation (Ojibwe language: Nagaajiwanaang), located mainly in Carlton and Saint Louis Counties, Minnesota, 20 miles west of Duluth.\n\nThe Fond du Lac Ojibwe are one of six bands who comprise the federally recognized Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, which was organized in 1934 with a new constitution under the Indian Reorganization Act. In July 2007, their enrolled members numbered 4,044.\n\nThe Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa originally inhabited the area along the lower courses of the Saint Louis River, where the present-day cities of Duluth, Minnesota and Superior, Wisconsin developed. The \"Wayekwaa-gichigamiing\" controlled the river access to both the Saint Louis and the Nemadji River rivers, major trade-routes during the decades of the fur trade with European traders. In the same area is Spirit Island of the \"Sixth Stopping Place\", one of the former seven Anishinaabe administrative centers.\n\nThe Fond du Lac Band's regional economic influence helped establish the American Fur Company's trading post in what now is the Fond du Lac neighborhood of Duluth. Two different Treaties of Fond du Lac were signed by the Fond du Lac Band.\n\nFond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa is one of six members of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe (MCT), from which it receives certain administrative services and support. The tribal government issues its own license plates. In the 2000 United States Census, the reservation recorded a population of 3,728 people and in July, 2007, MCT reported 4,044 people enrolled through Fond du Lac.\n\nThe largest community on the reservation is the city of Cloquet, of which only the sparsely populated western half of the city is on reservation land. That part has a population of 1,204 persons out of the city's total of 11,201. The only community completely on the reservation is Brookston, at the reservation's northern end.\n\nThe Band operates two casinos, the Fond du Luth Casino in Duluth and the Black Bear Casino Resort on the reservation. An agreement signed with the City of Duluth, in which property with-in city limits was given to the tribe to build the Fond du Luth Casino in return for profit sharing $6 million, approximately 20%, from slot machine gross revenue, was agreed upon in 1994. Profits are no longer shared with the city due to violation of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. This decision has been widely controversial, but each battle in court has seen the Band prevailing.\n\nOn August 31, 2018, the Band reached an agreement to let Enbridge build its Line 3 replacement pipeline across the Reservation. The agreement extended Enbridge's rights of way on the Reservation by 10 years, to 2039. The financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed.\n\nThe revised Constitution and By-Laws of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe were approved by the Secretary of Interior on March 3, 1964. The governing body of the Fond du Lac Indian Reservation is the Reservation Business Committee, which is composed of a Chairman, Secretary-Treasurer, and three Representatives: one from District I (Cloquet), one from District II (Sawyer) and one from District III (Brookston). All are elected to four-year terms on a staggered basis, with the Chairman and Secretary-Treasurer also serving as members of the Executive Committee of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe.\n\nThe current members of the Reservation Business Committee are:\n\n\n\n"}

He joined the Dominican Order at the age of eighteen and was one of the many of that Order who promulgated the Renaissance. Afterwards, however, he left the Dominicans and entered the Franciscan Order. Giocondo began his career as a teacher of Latin and Greek in Verona, where Julius Caesar Scaliger was one of his pupils.\n\nAs a young priest, Friar Giovanni was a learned archaeologist and a superb draughtsman. He visited Rome, sketched its ancient buildings, wrote the story of its great monuments, and recorded, deciphered and explained many defaced inscriptions. He stimulated the revival of classical learning by making transcriptions of ancient manuscripts, one of which, completed in 1492, he presented to Lorenzo de' Medici.\n\nGiocondo soon returned to his native town where he built bridges and planned fortifications for Treviso, acting as architect engineer, and head-builder during the construction.\n\nIn Verona, Giocondo designed the for Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor. It is considered one of the finest buildings in Verona and is famed for the decorations of its loggia. Thomas de Quincey also attributes the church of Santa Maria della Scala to Giocondo. He was then summoned to Venice, along with a number of other well-known architects, to discuss the protection of the lagoons against the rivers. Giocondo's plan of altering the Brenta's bed and leading this river to the sea was accepted by the Venetians, and the undertaking was a complete success.\n\nBetween 1496 and 1499 Giocondo was invited to France by Louis XII, and made royal adviser. There he built one bridge of remarkable beauty, the Pont Notre-Dame (1500-1512) in Paris, and designed the Palace of the Chambre des Comptes, the Golden Room of the Parliament, and the Chateau of Gaillon (Normandy), one portal of which has been removed to Paris, and stood for years in the courtyard of the École des Beaux-Arts to serve as a model for students of architecture, and was returned in 1977.\n\nBetween 1506 and 1508 Giocondo returned to Italy and constructed the Fondaco dei Tedeschi (1508), which was decorated by Titian and Giorgione. In 1513 the Rialto Bridge and its environs were burned. Giocondo was one of those who presented plans for a new bridge and surrounding structures. The designs of a rival were chosen. Giocondo left Venice for Rome where he was employed by the Vatican from 1514.\n\nIn a letter to Giuliano di Lorenzo de' Medici, in 1513, Giocondo referred to himself \"an old man\". On Donato Bramante's death he was made part of a team with Raphael and Giuliano da Sangallo to superintend the erection of the new St. Peter's Basilica. The work included strengthening the foundations. He died in 1515, while involved with this project.\n\nIn 1498 Giocondo published Pliny's \"Epistles\" in Bologna. He published another edition with Aldus Manutius's press (1508), which he dedicated to King Louis XII. Between 1506 and 1508 Giocondo wrote four dissertations on the waters and waterways of Venice.\n\nGiocondo was among the first to produce a corrected edition of De architectura by the classical Roman writer Vitruvius, a treatise that had a major influence on the development of Renaissance architecture. It was an illustrated edition, printed in Venice in 1511, and dedicated to Pope Julius II. Giocondo also published the works of Julius Obsequens, Aurelius Victor, and Cato the Elder's \"De re rustica\". He also edited Julius Caesar's \"Commentaries\" and made the first drawing of Caesar's bridge across the Rhine.\n\nIn addition to his classical and mathematical knowledge, he was a master of scholastic theology.\n\nGiocondo is sometimes identified as the author of the widely quoted inspirational letter, \"A Letter to the Most Illustrious the Contessina Allagia degli Aldobrandeschi, Written Christmas Eve Anno Domini 1513.\" The British Museum, however, stated in 1970 that the authorship of the letter was uncertain.\n\n"}

Later, it had been rejected and had the chassis of the Type 74 tank used instead as a basis for producing the Type 87 SPAAG.\n\nPrior to its development, tests had begun underway in 1982 with a prototype SPAAG unit manufactured in 1983.\nIn 2010, it was reported that the Japan Self-Defense Forces had 52 of these vehicles in service.\n\n\n"}

Recent classification places this species and its close relative, the Whitehead, in the family Mohouidae.\n\nThe yellowhead and the whitehead have allopatric distributions as, conversely, the latter is found only in the North Island and several small islands surrounding it. Although abundant in the 19th century, particularly in beech forests from Nelson and the Marlborough Sounds to Southland and Stewart Island/Rakiura, they declined dramatically in the early 20th century due to the introduction of black rats and mustelids. Today they have vanished from nearly 75% of their former range. A quarter of the mohua population now lives in the beech forests of the Catlins area.\n\nIn New Zealand, mohua have the status of a \"protected threatened endemic\" species. Conservation efforts are being made to ensure its survival and mohua populations have been established on several predator-free offshore islands, such as Breaksea Island in Fiordland and Ulva Island.\n\nPest control efforts by the Department of Conservation have managed to stabilise some mainland mohua populations. For example, where biodegradable 1080 poison was used to control rats in the Dart valley, there was a more than 80% survival rate, compared with just 10% in untreated areas. The population of mohua in the Landsborough valley has increased four-fold since 1998, thanks to an intensive programme of pest control, including aerial 1080. The population is now strong enough for birds to be transferred out to establish a new population on Resolution Island. Similar aerial 1080 operations in the Catlins and the Hurunui, Hawdon and Eglinton valleys have had equally encouraging results. DOC and TBfree New Zealand accounted in March 2014 a significant repopulation in the Catlins of other avian species, including bellbird and tomtit due to the reduction in predators.\n\nThe yellowhead appears on the reverse side of the New Zealand $100 note.\n\n"}

Its creation was groundbreaking in that it was the first time a leading university had combined all three (theater, film and television) of these aspects into a single administration. The undergraduate program is often ranked among the world's top drama departments. The graduate programs are usually ranking within the top three nationally, according to the \"U.S. News & World Report\". Among the school's resources are the Geffen Playhouse and the UCLA Film & Television Archive, the world's largest university-based archive of its kind, celebrating its 50th anniversary in 2015. The Archive constitutes one of the largest collections of media materials in the United States — second only to the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. Its vaults hold more than 220,000 motion picture and television titles and 27 million feet of newsreel footage. The film, television, and digital media program is one of the most prestigious film programs in the world. It is the most selective film school as the film and television major selects about only 15 freshman out of thousands of applicants and a handful of transfer students.\n\nThe School's enrollment, in 2014, consisted of 631 students. For Fall 2014, the School received 4,442 applications and offered admission to 346 applicants (7.8%).\n\nWith 140 faculty members teaching 335 undergrads and 296 graduate students, the teacher to student ratio is about 1:5.\n\nThe roots of the UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television go back to 1947 when the Theater Arts Department was created at UCLA and chaired by German theater director William Melnitz. When the department became the UCLA College of Fine Arts in 1961, Melnitz was named the founding dean, and drama critic and film producer Kenneth Macgowan became the chair of the Department of Theater Arts. The College of Fine Arts grew in standing and within seven years, its two departments had moved into their own facilities: Macgowan Hall became home to Theater in 1963, and the Department of Motion Pictures, Television and Radio moved into Melnitz Hall in 1967.\n\nTwenty years later, in 1987, The College of Fine Arts was disbanded. The School of Theater, Film and Television was created in 1990, and Gilbert Cates, a renowned film, television and Broadway director, became its founding dean. The curriculum was expanded, new faculty was hired, and entertainment industry connections were strengthened.\n\nIn 1999, Robert Rosen became UCLA TFT’s second dean. A professor and film historian, Rosen had earlier spearheaded the expansion of the UCLA Film & Television Archive into one of the largest collections of moving image material. As dean, Rosen expanded the School’s international influence with strong alliances, particularly in China.\n\nUCLA alumna Teri Schwartz became the dean of UCLA TFT in 2009. A former award-winning feature film producer, she was previously the founding dean of the School of Film and Television at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles.\n\nIn 2020, established and award-winning theater director Brian Kite has been named the interim dean of TFT. Kite is the recipient of the 2018 Joel Hirschhorn Award from the Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle, for distinguished achievement in musical theater. He is a Los Angeles Ovation Award winner for Best Direction of a Musical for his production of \"Spring Awakening\" and was again nominated for his productions of \"Les Misérables\" and \"American Idiot\". Kite is a chair emeritus of the Board of Governors of the L.A. Stage Alliance, holds an appointment as a visiting professor at the Shanghai Theatre Academy and is the artistic director of the award-winning Buffalo Nights Theatre Company. \n\nThe Skoll Center for Social Impact Entertainment at UCLA TFT was created in partnership with Participant Media founder and CEO Jeffrey Skoll in 2014. Skoll donated $10 million for the center, the first of its kind dedicated solely to advancing entertainment and performing arts to inspire social change. The idea for the center came to Teri Schwartz, later Dean of the UCLA TFT, in 2003; after meeting Skoll in 2007, she shared the idea for the center with him, and 7 years later the center was founded. The work of the Center is organized around three pillars: research, education and special initiatives, and public programming and exhibition. The Skoll Center for SIE is one of about a dozen dedicated research institutions focusing on Social impact entertainment.\n\nThe different areas of studies in the Department of Theater consist of:\n\nThe undergraduate program requires an interview/audition process for all applicants. The program teaches the general studies of theater broadly, before allowing the student to study their specified area of study.\n\nOffering Master of Fine Arts and Doctor of Philosophy degrees, the graduate program requires an audition for all acting applicants and a possible interview for other candidates. Each applicant must apply for a specific area of study.\n\nThe different areas of studies in the Department of Film, Television and Digital Media consist of:\n\nThe undergraduate program in Film, Television and Digital Media gives students the opportunity to learn about the history and theory of film and television while also teaching practical, creative and technical skills. Students must concentrate on one of the following areas:\n\n\nStudents must all complete one internship during their senior year.\n\nOffering Master of Arts, Master of Fine Arts and Doctor of Philosophy degrees, the graduate program offers two main areas of study. A Master of Arts and a Doctor of Philosophy degree are available for critical studies. The Master of Fine Arts degree can be obtained with the choice of five specializations:\n\n\nThe School also offers non-degree certificate programs modeled after the MFA curriculum. The UCLA Professional Programs in Screenwriting, Video Game Writing, Producing and Acting for the Camera are the only non-degree screenwriting and producing programs that have oversight by the UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television, and the only viable alternatives to the UCLA MFA Screenwriting and Producing programs.\n\nIn the UCLA Professional Program in Screenwriting (offered both on-campus and online), students focus on the theory and craft of professional screenwriting, without having to take the critical studies seminars and related electives that are required to obtain a degree. The goal of this graduate-level program, which takes place over one academic year, is for the student to start and complete two original feature-length screenplays.\n\nThe UCLA Professional Program in Producing is a 10-week program that provides an intensive overview of the contemporary film and television industries and introduces students to the tools needed to navigate the studio and independent marketplace. The program consists of a series of lectures, discussions, and appearances by entertainment industry guests.\n\nThe School of Theater, Film and Television consists of a linked network of professional theaters, sound stages, and television studios.\n\nMade possible by a $5 million gift from Audrey L. Wilder and designed by Michael Maltzan Architecture, the 295-seat Billy Wilder Theater is situated on the Courtyard level of the Hammer Museum in Westwood Village.\n\nThe Geffen Playhouse was founded in 1995 by former UCLA TFT Dean Gilbert Cates. The theater is owned by UCLA and named after entertainment executive and philanthropist David Geffen, who gave a substantial initial gift for the restoration of the theater’s building, originally constructed in 1929.\n\n"}

The name \"combi\" comes from the word \"combination\", and is derived from the famous Volkswagen Type 2 van, often called the \"Kombi\" van, specifically the \"Kombinationskraftwagen\" (combination motor vehicle) variant, with side windows and removable rear seats, which both a passenger and a cargo vehicle combined.\n\nCombi aircraft typically feature an oversized cargo door, as well as tracks on the cabin floor to allow the seats to be added or removed quickly.\n\nTypically, configured for both passenger and cargo duty, the passenger compartment is pressurized to a higher pressure, to prevent potential fumes from cargo entering the passenger area.\n\nOne U.S. air carrier that flew propeller-driven combi aircraft was Northwest Airlines.\n\nIn 1963, Northwest was operating a domestic and International routing with a Douglas DC-7C four engine propeller aircraft between New York Idlewild Airport (which would subsequently be renamed JFK Airport) and Tokyo that was configured to transport a mixed passenger/cargo load.\n\nThe round trip routing for this flight which was operated once a week was New York-Chicago-Seattle-Anchorage-Tokyo.\n\nThe DC-7C was configured with all economy seating in the passenger cabin.\n\nBy 1966, Northwest was operating jet combi service with Boeing 707-320C aircraft between the U.S. and Asia.\n\nAnother U.S. airline that operated combi aircraft was Braniff International.\n\nIn 1968, Braniff was flying Boeing 727-100QC (\"Quick Change\") jetliners in a configuration that facilitated the transportation of palletized freight containers as well as 51 passengers in an all-economy-class cabin in scheduled airline operations.\n\nAccording to a Braniff system timetable dated July 1, 1968, the airline was operating weekday \"red eye flights\" with round trip services at night with its B727 combi aircraft on the following routings: New York (JFK) - Washington, D.C. (IAD) - Nashville (BNA) - Memphis (MEM) - Dallas Love Field (DAL); Seattle (SEA) - Portland (PDX) - Dallas Love Field (DAL); and Denver (DEN) - Dallas Love Field (DAL).\n\nThe freight pallets were loaded in the front section of the aircraft by forklift via a large cargo door located on the side of the fuselage aft of the flight deck while passengers boarded and deplaned via the integral air stairs located at the rear underneath the trijet's engines.\n\nThese aircraft could also be quickly changed to fly either all cargo or all passenger operations and Braniff flew the B727QC in both configurations besides operating in a mixed passenger/freight combi mode.\n\nAn additional U.S. operator of the Boeing 727-100 Combi was Continental Micronesia (known as \"Air Mike\") which in 1983 was operating mixed passenger/freight flights with the aircraft between Honolulu and Guam on its \"Island Hopper\" service.\n\nOne such 727 combi service operated by Continental Micronesia was flight 562 which departed Guam every Tuesday at 3:30pm and then arrived in Honolulu at 7:41am the next morning with en route stops being made at such Pacific island destinations as Truk, Pohnpei (formerly Ponape), Kwajalein, Majuro and Johnston Island.\n\nLAN-Chile (now LATAM Chile) was operating Boeing 727-100 combi service between the U.S. and Latin America three times a week in 1970 with service from New York City John F. Kennedy Airport (JFK) and Miami (MIA). According to its October 25, 1970 system timetable, 727 combi routings operated by LAN-Chile included New York JFK - Miami - Cali, Colombia - Guayaquil, Ecuador - Lima, Peru - Santiago, Chile - Buenos Aires, Argentina - Montevideo, Uruguay as well as New York JFK - Miami - Panama City, Panama - Cali, Colombia - Lima, Peru - Santiago, Chile - Buenos Aires, Argentina - Montevideo, Uruguay and New York JFK - Miami - Panama City, Panama - Guayaquil, Ecuador - Lima, Peru - Santiago, Chile - Buenos Aires, Argentina.\n\nAn Asian operator of combi aircraft was Royal Brunei Airlines flying Boeing 737-200QC aircraft.\n\nIn 1983, Royal Brunei was operating nonstop combi service with the 737 between its home base of Bandar Seri Begawan in Brunei and Bangkok, Hong Kong and Singapore.\n\nA long time user of combi aircraft is KLM Royal Dutch Airlines.\n\nAccording to the May 15, 1971 KLM system timetable, the airline was operating Douglas DC-8 combi jetliners in mixed passenger/freight services between its hub located at the Amsterdam Schiphol Airport (AMS) and the following destinations: Amman, Anchorage, Bangkok, Brazzaville, Chicago O'Hare Airport, Houston Intercontinental Airport, Jakarta, Johannesburg, Kuala Lumpur, Mexico City, Montreal, New York City JFK Airport, Singapore, Teheran, Tokyo, Tripoli and Zurich. KLM's DC-8 combi aircraft featured all coach service with no first class cabin.\n\nKLM retired its last 747-400M in 2020\n\nOther European airlines operating combi aircraft in the past included Air France and Lufthansa which both operated Boeing 747 combis.\n\nAccording to the Official Airline Guide (OAG), during the early 1980s Air France was flying 747 combi service between France and destinations in Africa, Asia, Canada, Mexico, the Mideast, South America and the U.S. including Anchorage, Chicago O'Hare Airport, Houston Intercontinental Airport and Los Angeles while Lufthansa was operating 747 combis between Germany and destinations in Africa, Asia, Australia, the Mideast, South America and the U.S. including Anchorage, Boston, Dallas/Fort Worth, Los Angeles, New York JFK Airport, Philadelphia, San Francisco and San Juan.\n\nIn both cases, Anchorage was used as a technical stop by the Air France and Lufthansa combi services on the polar route between Europe and Japan.\n\nA number of other airlines also flew Boeing 747 combis during the 1980s including Air Canada, Air Gabon, Air India (Boeing 747-300 combi version), Alitalia, Avianca, CAAC Airlines, Cameroon Airlines, China Airlines, El Al, Iberia Airlines, Iraqi Airways, Pakistan International Airlines, Qantas, Royal Jordanian Airlines, Sabena, South African Airways, Swissair, UTA and Varig. Air Canada also earlier operated Douglas DC-8 combi aircraft. In addition, Sabena was operating McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 combis at this time as well. There was also a combi version of the successor to the DC-10 being the McDonnell Douglas MD-11C which was operated by Alitalia. Uganda Airlines operated Boeing 707 combi aircraft. During the early 1990s, Garuda Indonesia Airlines was operating Boeing 747 combis between Jakarta and Los Angeles via Honolulu. Alaska Airlines also flew the 737-400 combi on a multi-stop “milk run” route from Anchorage to Ketchikan to Wrangell to Petersburg to Seattle and then back to Anchorage as well as on other routes in Alaska.\n\nSome now defunct airlines from embattled nations flew combi aircraft. Air Rhodesia had a Boeing 720 combi that it operated when Rhodesia was a nation, acquired in 1967 and flown till shortly after the dissolution of the nation and state airline. It was sold to South African Airways which because of the apartheid regime flew a number of combi aircraft. One of the most infamous of these was the South African Airways Flight 295, a Boeing 747 combi named Helderberg, which was a scheduled commercial flight from Taiwan to South Africa that suffered a catastrophic in-flight fire in the cargo area and crashed into the Indian Ocean east of Mauritius on 28 November 1987, killing everyone on board. Air Vietnam the official state airline of South Vietnam possessed at least one Boeing 727-100 combi that it had obtained from Continental Air Services (CASI), a subsidiary airline of Continental Airlines set up to provide operations and airlift support in Southeast Asia, in the mid-1960s. Under this agreement, CASI would share passengers and cargo routes with Air Vietnam on certain domestic and international routes. During the Fall of Saigon it was destroyed during shelling of Tan Son Nhat International Airport.\n\nTwo airlines based in Iceland also operated combi aircraft including Icelandair flying Boeing 727-100 and Boeing 737-200 combis, and Eagle Air (Iceland) flying Boeing 737-200 combis. Both air carriers operated their Boeing combi jets on flights between Iceland and western Europe.\n\nAir Marshall Islands was a somewhat exotic combi aircraft operator flying a Douglas DC-8-62CF jetliner in mixed passenger/freight operations. According to the Official Airline Guide (OAG), Air Marshall Islands was operating a DC-8 combi on scheduled services linking Honolulu with the Pacific islands of Kwajalein and Majuro during the early 1990s. Air Marshall Islands is still currently in existence flying regional turboprops but no longer operates combi jet aircraft.\n\nAlaska Airlines was a long time combi operator flying various Boeing jet models in combi configuration (see below). There were several other combi aircraft operators as well in Alaska in the past including MarkAir with Boeing 737-200s and de Havilland Canada DHC-7 Dash 7s, Reeve Aleutian Airways with Boeing 727-100 jets and Lockheed L-188 Electra turboprops, Western Airlines with Lockheed L-188 Electras and Wien Air Alaska with Boeing 737-200s and Fairchild F-27B turboprops. Wien was the launch customer for the combi version of the B737-200 while Wien predecessor Northern Consolidated Airlines was the first operator of the Fairchild F-27B which was combi version of the Fairchild Hiller FH-227.\n\nA number of airlines in Canada also flew combi aircraft besides Air Canada and its Douglas DC-8 and Boeing 747 combi services including First Air with Boeing 727-100 and 727-200 jetliners in addition to Hawker Siddeley HS 748 turboprops. First Air continues to operate combi aircraft at the present time including Boeing 737-200 and 737-400 jetliners as well as the ATR 42 turboprop. Two other current combi operators in Canada are Air North operating the Boeing 737-200 jet and Hawker Siddeley HS 748 turboprop, and Canadian North flying Boeing 737-200 jets and de Havilland Canada DHC-8-100 Dash 8 turboprop aircraft. Other combi operators in Canada in the past included CP Air and Pacific Western with both airlines flying Boeing 727-100 and Boeing 737-200 combi aircraft as well as Nordair operating Boeing 737-200 combi aircraft.\n\nIn 2008 Aviation Traders designed a Boeing 757-200 combi aircraft leased from Astraeus Airlines for the heavy metal band Iron Maiden. The front of the aircraft was configured for passengers, with the rear holding six tonnes of cargo consisting of Iron Maiden's equipment for their tour. The band supported their most recent tour with a Boeing 747-400 leased from Air Atlanta Icelandic.\n\nNowadays, many airlines have converted their combis into full passenger service or full freighter service for the potential of more profitable operations.\n\nAlaska Airlines operated converted narrow body Boeing 737-400 combis that were previously flown in full passenger configuration. According to the Alaska Airlines website, the airline was operating several Boeing 737-400 combi aircraft with each jetliner configured with 72 passenger seats in the coach compartment. The airline then announced the retirement of these aircraft with the last combi flight scheduled for October 18, 2017. On that date, Alaska Airlines flight 66 was the airline's last scheduled combi flight with the Boeing 737-400 (N764AS) operating a routing of Anchorage (ANC) - Cordova (CDV) - Yakutat (YAK) - Juneau (JNU) - Seattle (SEA).\n\nThe 737-400 aircraft replaced Boeing 737-200 combis that were formerly operated by Alaska Airlines, which was the only major U.S. air carrier still flying scheduled combi operations domestically with service between Seattle and Alaska and also between Anchorage, Fairbanks and remote destinations in Alaska.\n\nAlaska Airlines previously operated Boeing 727-100C aircraft which were also capable of combi operations and has now added Boeing 737-700 freighter all-cargo aircraft to its fleet which have replaced its Boeing 737-400 combi aircraft.\n\n"}
{"id": "1846791", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1846791", "title": "Ivan Martin Jirous", "text": "Ivan Martin Jirous\n\nIvan Martin Jirous (23 September 1944 – 9 November 2011) was a Czech poet and dissident, best known as the artistic director of the Czech psychedelic rock group The Plastic People of the Universe, and later one of the key figures of the Czech underground during the communist regime. He is more frequently known as Magor, which can be roughly translated as \"shithead\", \"loony\", or \"fool\" (though meant as a positive title), a nickname given to him by the experimental poet .\n\nTrained as an art historian but unable to work in this field in Czechoslovakia under the Communist regime, Jirous became a member of the dissident subculture, and during the period of normalisation, Jirous was imprisoned five times for his activities. His particular contribution to the dissident movement was the concept of \"second culture\", according to which simply expressing oneself through forbidden cultural and artistic activities would ultimately undermine the totalitarian system, a concept closely related to his friend Vaclav Havel's \"living in truth\", and Vaclav Benda's \"parallel polis\".\n\nJirous won the Jaroslav Seifert Prize in 2006 and the Tom Stoppard Prize in 1985 for the poem \"Magor's Swan Song\" ().\n\nJirous was born in Humpolec in Vysočina. His mother was a teacher, and his father worked in tax. He completed his secondary education at Dr. A Hrdlička's Secondary Comprehensive and Primary School in Humpolec (now known as Dr A Hrdlička's Gymnasium).\n\nInitially, Jirous wanted to study at the Film and TV School of the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague (FAMU), but his cousin Jiří Padrta, editor of the journal \"Výtvarná práce\", steered him towards art history. In 1962, Jirous sat the entrance exam to study history of art at the Philosophy Faculty of Charles University in Prague. A condition of entry for students at the time was the completion of a year in industry before beginning their studies; in Jirous' case, he had to work as a construction worker and stoker. Jirous studied between 1963 and 1968. The topic of his diploma thesis was visual poetry in the works of the poets Jiří Kolář and Henri Michaux. His sister Zara, who was two years older than him and married to the photographer , also pursued fine art.\n\nIn 1967, Jirous became familiar with the underground group The Primitives Group, and later in 1969 became the artistic director and manager of The Plastic People of the Universe (PPU). His wife, Věra Jirousová, wrote a lot of the band's early lyrics. Due to his opposition to his country's totalitarian regime, Jirous was prohibited from publishing his literature. Instead, he had to work as a night watchman and gardener to avoid being unemployed, which was a punishable offence.\n\nJirous was imprisoned five times for his underground organisation and artistic activities. He was often cautioned under paragraph 202 - \"disturbing the peace\".\n\nJirous was first imprisoned between 1973 and 1974 for an incident in a pub with a retired Security Service Major. Jirous was convicted alongside Eugen Brikcius, Daníček and Jaroslav Kořán. After singing the song \"Send the Russian killers to hell where they belong\" and exchanging words with the Major, Jirous ate the middle of the newspaper \"Rudé právo\" and exclaimed \"Today I ate \"Rudé právo\", just like one day we will gobble up the Bolsheviks\". In June 2011, his conviction was overturned by the Supreme Court.\n\nJirous's most influential work was \"Notes on the Third Czech Musical Revival\", which he published in exile in 1975. The work was considered a policy statement for the non-political Czech underground and included:\n\nAccording to Jirous, \"the aim of the underground is to create an alternative culture. A culture which will be independent of official communication channels, social evaluation, and the hierarchy of values as imposed by the establishment. A culture which cannot aim to destroy the establishment, for that will only play into the establishment's hands.\"\n\nJirous compiled an anthology of underground poetry entitled \"Egon Bondy to the 45th birthday of the disabled siblings\". He also organised several \"festivals of independent culture\"; the first took place in Postupice in September 1974, forcefully broken up by police, followed by another in Bojanovice in 1976, which also served as a belated celebration of Jirous' marriage to his second wife Juliana. In early 1976 Jirous was introduced to Vaclav Havel for the first time, via a mutual friend, František Smejkal. The two men became friends and allies, and Jirous is mentioned several times in Havel's \"Letters to Olga\".\n\nOn 16 March 1976, Jirous was arrested again, along with the PPU and many other musicians. The whole trial was widely publicised by the regime as a deterrent against troublemakers and hooligans; Czechoslovak Television released a documentary about them called \"An attack on culture\", and an episode of television series \"Thirty Cases of Major Zeman\", entitled \"Mimicry\" and starring Jiri Labus, portrayed the group as drug addicts and terrorists. The trial took place on 21–23 September 1976, and Jirous was convicted for \"aggravated hooliganism\", along with the musician and pastor Svatopluk Karásek, Pavel Zajíček of the group DG 307, and Vratislav Brabenec from PPU, and imprisoned for a second time, for 18 months. The trial became a cause célèbre, and organised opposition to the charges brought together for the first time the originally apolitical underground groups and political dissidents led by Havel, which eventually led to the creation of Charter 77. On his release from prison in 1977, Jirous signed the Charter, and also organised a third \"festival of independent culture\", at Vaclav Havel's country house at Hrádeček in Trutnov District.\n\nFuture concerts could only be held as private events since public performances by PPU had been banned. A month after returning home, Jirous was again sentenced to time in prison after he made a speech at a exhibition about the insuperable distinction between official and unofficial culture. He served this sentence between 1977 and 1978. In 1979 he helped create the samizdat \"Vokno\", and wrote the unfinished work \"The True Story of the Plastic People\". He also became a member of the Committee for the Defense of the Unjustly Prosecuted (VONS).\n\nJirous's fourth spell in prison was due to his role in producing, publishing and distributing the magazine \"Vokno\", along with , Michal Hýbek, Milan Frič, and Jaroslav Chnápek. The trial took place in May 1982 with strict security and attended by specially selected people, loyal to the regime. The judgement deemed that articles from \"Vokno\" were antisocial, with grossly indecent subject matter and a disrespect for society.\n\nBetween 1981 and 1985, Jirous was again imprisoned, officially for disturbing the peace, but also, according to Amnesty International and VONS, for unsubstantiated charges of illegal possession of marijuana, allegedly found during a house search. In 1984, Jirous was named Prisoner of the Month by Amnesty International. It was during this time that he wrote the poems later collected as \"Magor's Swan Song\" (), for which he later won the Tom Stoppard Award. Between 1985 and 1987, Jirous was under supervision as part of his previous convictions, and had to report daily to the Public Security Office.\n\nHis fifth imprisonment was in response to his signature on the petition \"Tak dost\", created in response to the death of the dissident Pavel Wonka. Jirous was imprisoned for \"an attack on the state and social organisation\" together with Jiri Tichy, and was in prison from 1988 until 25 November 1989, when the President of the Republic waived the rest of his sentence.\n\nAfter the Velvet Revolution in 1989, Jirous became a member of the Czech PEN club. He and wrote to the Interior Ministry in protest against the police intervention at CzechTek 2004. Until his death, Jirous lived in Prague and in a converted farmhouse in Vysocina, where the Magorova Vydri music festival took place every year from the revolution until 2005. Since 2006 it has been held at Skalákovy mlýn.\n\nAlthough his friend Jaroslav Eri Fric described him as \"a devotee of purity, tenderness and justice\", Jirous was vulgar and confrontational, often intentionally, and sometimes physically aggressive when drunk.\n\nJirous died suddenly on 9 November 2011. His memorial service took place on 17 November 2011 in the Church of Saint Ignatius in Prague, with the service conducted by Bishop Václav Malý. He was buried in a local cemetery to his home in Vysocina.\n\nJirous's first wife was (1944–2011), a poet and art historian. In 1972 their son was born, Tobiáš, now an actor, writer and DJ. Jirous is named as Tobias's father on his birth certificate, but Tobias's biological father is in fact the philosopher Jiří Němec.\n\nIn 1976, Jirous married for a second time, to the painter Juliána Stritzková (born 1943), the granddaughter of Josef Florian. Jirous and Juliána had two daughters, (1980) and Marta (1981). Jirous spent a large proportion of his daughters' childhoods in prison, but remained in contact with his family. The marriage broke down shortly after his release. His daughter Františka is a novelist, and the chair of the organisation Magor's Estate, which aims to transform Jirous's estate in Vysočina into a monument to poets. Marta continued her father's poetry in the collection \"Walk with an Angel\".\n\nJirous also had a son, Daniel (born 1992), with translator Daniela Degtěvová. Daniel studies architecture and lives in Prague.\n\nJirous was in a relationship with the songwriter, Dáša Vokatá, from the 1990s until his death in 2011.\n\nIvan Martin Jirous first started publishing art criticism during the 1960s. At first, he focused on foreign modern art (Russian avant-garde, Lucio Fontana, Andy Warhol), then later examined the relationship between beat music and art, and later, he specialised in the \"Křižovnická school of clean humour without the joke\" (Naděžda Plíšková, Karel Nepraš and Jan Steklík). Jirous was also interested in older art, such as the sculptures of Václav Levý. Jirous contributed to journals including \"Ateliér\", \"Divadlo\" (\"Theatre\"), \"Host do domu\" (\"Guesthouse\"), \"Sešity pro literaturu a diskusi\" (\"Notebooks for literature and discussion\"), \"Výtvarná práce\" (\"Visual works\"), \"Výtvarné umění\" (\"Fine art\"), \"Výtvarný život\" (\"Visual life\"), to the international periodicals \"Art Canada\" and \"Exile Testimony\", as well as the samizdat publication \"Vokno\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1846797", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1846797", "title": "Jerry Ordway", "text": "Jerry Ordway\n\nJeremiah Ordway (born November 28, 1957) is an American writer, penciller, inker and painter of comic books.\n\nHe is known for his inking work on a wide variety of DC Comics titles, including the continuity-redefining \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" (1985–1986), his long run working on the Superman titles from 1986–1993, and for writing and painting the Captain Marvel original graphic novel \"The Power of Shazam!\" (1994), and writing the ongoing monthly series from 1995–1999. He has provided inks for artists such as Curt Swan, Jack Kirby, Gil Kane, John Buscema, Steve Ditko, John Byrne, George Perez and others.\n\nJerry Ordway was inspired in his childhood by Marvel Comics, and dreamed of drawing Daredevil, Spider-Man, and the Avengers. To date he has only worked on the latter. Ordway is Jewish.\n\nAmong the artists he considers influential are Curt Swan, Jack Kirby, Gil Kane, John Buscema, Steve Ditko, all of whose pencils he would later ink over. He cites Gene Colan, Wally Wood, Alex Raymond, Hal Foster and Roy Crane as early inspirations. He names contemporaries such as Lee Weeks, John Romita Jr., Ron Garney, Mike Weiringo and Alan Davis, and inkers such as Joe Sinnott, Dick Giordano, Tom Palmer and Klaus Janson.\n\nOrdway attended Milwaukee Technical High School, where he took a three-year commercial art course, before joining a commercial art studio as a typographer in 1976. He subsequently worked his way \"from the ground floor up at the art studio\" between 1978 and 1981.\n\nBefore beginning his professional career as an inker, Jerry Ordway entered the comics industry as an artist and publisher for small-press comics fanzines. Ordway discovered Marvel comics in \"June of 1967,\" and wrote in 1975 (aged 17) that he had \"been drawing superheroes [ever] since.\" His first published work, a story entitled \"The Messenger\", appeared in \"Tim Corrigan's Superhero Comics\" No. 4 (April, 1975), and his own self-published fanzine \"Okay Comix\" followed in May–June, 1975. \"Okay Comix\" featured stories by Ordway and his friend Dave Koula, and art predominantly by Ordway himself. Ordway's own hero \"Proton\" headlined the 'zine, which featured a pin-up of a character \"called Acrobat\" who was \"the first superhero [Ordway] created. His birth was Dec. 1969.\"\n\nSpending the late 1970s working as a painter in a commercial art studio in Milwaukee, between 1978 and 1979, he provided illustrations for a number of fanzines and pro-zines, including \"Omniverse\" and \"The Comics Journal\". His first professional work was for Western Publishing's Golden Books on young-reader Marvel books, and the \"Superheroes Golden Beginning Stampbook '79\".\n\nHaving produced comics-related artwork for fanzines and licensed publishers, Ordway attended \"a talent search at the 1980 Chicago Comicon,\" held by DC Comics. After showing them his \"DC related artwork from the Golden Books,\" he \"walked away with a promise of work.\" This work began in the summer of 1980 for \"DC's anthology comics,\" (including \"Weird War Tales\" and \"Mystery in Space\") in which he \"inked Carmine Infantino, Trevor Von Eeden, as well as Joe Staton, and Dave Cockrum.\" After continuing to work at the art studio for a further six months, inking comics for DC by night, Ordway began \"freelancing full time in February 1981.\" During the mid-1980s, he \"shared a studio with other artists, including Machlan, Pat Broderick, and Al Vey.\"\n\nAt DC, he would illustrate \"All-Star Squadron\", a series which he helped launch in an insert preview in \"Justice League of America\" No. 193 (Aug. 1981). With writer Roy Thomas, he co-created \"Infinity, Inc.\" in \"All-Star Squadron\" No. 25 (Sept. 1983) and the new team was launched in its own series in March 1984. Ordway inked \"DC Comics Presents Annual\" No. 4 (1985) over artist Eduardo Barreto's pencils, was one of several artists on \"Batman Annual\" No. 9 (July 1985), inked George Pérez's pencils on the epic crossover miniseries \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" in 1985 and Superman artist Wayne Boring's pencils for a retelling of the definitive Golden Age Superman origin story written by Roy Thomas in \"Secret Origins\" No. 1 (April 1986), which he considers a particular favorite. Ordway was the penciller and inker for the DC Comics adaptation of the 1989 \"Batman\" film which was published as a \"movie special\".\n\nOrdway has noted that \"Inking is a weird job, because as much as you put into it, the page still belongs to the penciler.\"\n\nIn 1986, along with writer/artist John Byrne and writer Marv Wolfman, Ordway revamped Superman, in the wake of the Ordway-inked continuity-redefining maxiseries \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\". Launching, with a revised origin and new continuity, in Byrne's miniseries, \"The Man of Steel\", Superman soon returned to featuring in a number of titles. After the titular title \"Superman\" was cancelled and replaced with \"The Man of Steel\", it was relaunched as \"The Adventures of Superman\", continuing the numbering of the original \"Superman\" series, with Wolfman as writer and Ordway as artist.\n\nWhen Wolfman departed the title with issue #435, Byrne briefly took over script writing duties before Ordway assumed the mantle of writer-artist and took over the series solely with issue #445 (Oct. 1988), making his writing debut two issues earlier with #443 (Aug. 1988). Ordway had also served as co-plotter on a few issues during both Wolfman and Bryne's writing tenures (issues #426, 435-437, 439-442, and 444). Switching from \"The Adventures of Superman\", Ordway became the writer-artist on the companion title \"Superman vol. 2\" between #34 (Aug. 1989) and #55 (May 1991), before later returning to \"Adventures of Superman\" as writer and sometimes as cover artist from issues #480 (July 1991) to #500 (June 1993). Ordway was the writer and primary artist for the story in which Clark Kent proposes to Lois Lane. While writing for the Superman family of titles, Ordway cowrote such storylines as \"Panic in the Sky\" and \"The Death of Superman\" storyline in 1992. After seven years working on the character, Ordway largely left the Superman titles in 1993, although he would make frequent returns to the character as writer and throughout his career, co-writing \"Adventures of Superman\" with Karl Kesel from issues #539–540, 558–562, 564–567 in 1996, and 1998–1999. In Nov. 2017, he drew the variant cover for \"Action Comics\" #992 (cover dated Jan. 2018). \nDuring the 50th anniversary celebrations for Superman, he inked John Byrne's pencils for the cover of the March 14, 1988 issue of \"Time\" magazine and an interior spread celebrating the Man of Steel's anniversary. Ordway has produced a large number of covers for DC from 1982 onwards, including for issues of \"Secret Origins\" and the painted cover art to the hardcover reprint collection \"The Greatest Golden Age Stories Ever Told\". He produced the cover art for the prestige format graphic novels, \"Superman: The Earth Stealers\" in 1988 where he inked Curt Swan's pencils and \"Superman For Earth\" (1991), among other work.\n\nIn 1994, Ordway masterminded the return of the original Captain Marvel to the DC Universe with the 96-page hardcover graphic novel \"The Power of Shazam!\", which he both wrote and painted. The story saw Ordway depict the revamped origins of the former-Fawcett Comics superhero. It proved to be a success, and was followed by an ongoing monthly series, also titled \"The Power of Shazam!\" (which ran between 1995 and 1999). Ordway wrote and provided painted covers for the entire run of the regular series, as well as illustrating fill-in issues between series-regular artists Peter Krause and Mike Manley. Towards the end of the series run, he again took on the dual role of writer & artist.\n\nDuring the mid-1980s, Ordway provided covers and occasional artwork to titles from a number of different comics companies. Companies included Wendy and Richard Pini's WaRP Graphics, AC Comics, Charlton Comics, Paragon Publications and fan-turned-pro Marty Greim. For Eclipse Comics, Ordway provided pencils for a short \"Epilogue\" story in Mark Evanier's \"DNAgents\" No. 18 (Jan. 1985). He produced \"Munden's Bar\" for First Comics, and provided pencils and inks on an issue of \"T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents\".\n\nFor Image Comics, Ordway co-created the character WildStar with Al Gordon in 1993, and published his creator-owned one-shot \"The Messenger\" in July 2000.\nAlthough the vast majority of Ordway's professional work has been produced for DC, Ordway inked issues of Marvel's \"Fantastic Four\". He produced occasional work for Marvel between 1984 and 1988, then returned a decade later to write and illustrate a three-issue arc of \"The Avengers\" vol. 3 #16–18 (1999), guest artist on \"Captain America\" (vol. 3) #32 (Aug. 2000) with writer Dan Jurgens, as well as penciling the four-issue crossover mini-series \"Maximum Security\" (#1–3 and prologue \"Dangerous Planet\"), and writer/penciller on a \"U.S. Agent\" mini-series in 2000–2001. He was artist for the one-shot \"Captain America and the Invaders: Bahamas Triangle\" with writer Roy Thomas, released in July 2019.\n\nAs well as inking most of \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", Ordway inked the second of DC's continuity-redefining event titles in 1994 by inking writer-artist Dan Jurgens' pencils on \"\". In 2001, he drew the one-shot \"Just Imagine... Stan Lee with Jerry Ordway Creating the JLA\" as part of Marvel-stalwart Stan Lee's foray into the DC Universe, in which the two of them re-imagined DC's Justice League of America. He inked the last year (May 2002–May 2003) of the Batman-related title \"Azrael: Agent of the Bat\" (#88–100), and provided the artwork for a six-issue story arc in \"Wonder Woman\" (vol. 2, issues #189–194), with writer Walt Simonson in 2003. In 2004, Ordway was inker on \"JLA\" issues #94–99, the “Tenth Circle” story arc which reunited the former \"Uncanny X-Men\" creative team of writer Chris Claremont and artist John Byrne. From 2003–2008, he provided new covers to the \"Superman: The Man of Steel\" series of six trade paperbacks, collecting the early adventures of the Post-Crisis Superman. To celebrate the twentieth anniversary of the original \"Crisis\", DC published Geoff Johns' \"Infinite Crisis\" limited series (Dec. 2005–June 2006), for which Ordway provided the artwork for the flashback scenes set on Earth-Two, including a recreation of the cover to \"Action Comics\" #1, which he cites as another favorite piece of his. In the wake of \"Infinite Crisis\", he inked Dan Jurgens' pencils once again in the \"History of the Multiverse\" back-up stories in the weekly comic book \"\"Countdown\"\" (issues No. 39 and No. 38, Chapters 11 and 12) (October 2007).\n\nHis work since 2008 includes pencilling three issues of \"The Brave and the Bold\" (volume 2) (#11–13, May–July 2008) with writer Mark Waid, and pencils for \"Justice Society of America Annual\" No. 1 (Sept. 2008), alongside some interior artwork for the ongoing \"Justice Society of America\" series during late 2008. In 2012, Ordway worked on a Challengers of the Unknown storyline for \"DC Universe Presents\" with DC Co-Publisher Dan DiDio. Later that same year, he drew a \"Human Bomb\" limited series which was written by Justin Gray and Jimmy Palmiotti. Ordway and artist Steve Rude produced a Superman story for DC's \"Adventures of Superman\" digital series in 2014. Ordway drew the \"Five Minutes\" chapter in \"Action Comics\" #1000 (June 2018). He drew the new cover art for the trade paperback collection \"Wonder Woman By Walter Simonson and Jerry Ordway\", collecting \"Wonder Woman\" vol. 2, issues #189-194 in 2018.\n\nOrdway received an Inkpot Award in 1994. In 2017, he was awarded the Inkwell Awards Joe Sinnott Hall of Fame Award for \"an inking career in American comic books of outstanding accomplishment.\"\n\nOrdway is married to Peggy May Ordway (b. 1959).\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1846803", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1846803", "title": "The Hoya", "text": "The Hoya\n\nThe Hoya, founded in 1920, is the oldest and largest student newspaper of Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., serving as the university’s newspaper of record. The Hoya is a student-run paper that prints every Friday and publishes online daily throughout the year, with a print circulation of 4,000 during the academic year. The newspaper has four main editorial sections: News, Opinion, Sports and The Guide, a weekly arts and lifestyle magazine. It also publishes several annual special issues including a New Student Guide, a basketball preview and a semesterly fashion issue.\n\nAlthough The Hoya is not financially independent from the university, it is produced, managed and edited entirely by students and maintains editorial independence. Over 250 students are involved in the publication of the paper.\n\nThe first issue of The Hoya was published on January 14, 1920, under the editorship of Joseph R. Mickler, Jr. Student journalism at Georgetown can be traced as far back as 1824 and the appearance of a hand-copied publication titled Minerva\".\" The Hoya, however, was distinguished from previous student publications by its intent to be a comprehensive university newspaper. The publication took its name from the phrase “Hoya Saxa,” which had been adopted as a common chant at Georgetown sports events in the 1890s. The popularity of the term spread as local newspapers often cited The Hoya, and \"Hoya\" began to be widely applied to campus organizations and to athletic groups themselves.\n\nBeginning in the 1940s, the publication shifted its main coverage from athletic to campus events. Weathering the Great Depression, World War II, student unrest in the 1960s and funding cuts in the 1970s, The Hoya has appeared almost continuously since its founding, providing a student perspective on issues and events.\n\nIn its early years, The Hoya published once a week, focused mainly on internal, campus affairs, promoting student organizations and school functions, and devoted a large part of its coverage to sports. In 1930, The Hoya received the highest rating given to a college weekly publication by the National Collegiate Press Association.\n\nIn the late 1930s, international events began to influence content. The Hoya was one of the few student groups to remain active during the war years, and its pages at this time juxtapose coverage of blood drives, war bond programs and alumni casualties with details of tea dances and intramural athletics.\n\nIn the post-war era, the paper’s focus returned to internal campus issues, perhaps reflecting the desire of veterans, who made up most of the student body, to return to normal life. The 1950s saw the introduction of two recurring features: the Basketball Preview Issue, which first appeared on December 3, 1957, and the April Fools’ issue.\n\nOne of the high points of The Hoya’s entertainment reporting came in 1964, when one of its reporters managed to interview The Beatles, who were in Washington for their first live concert appearance in the U.S. The interview appeared in the February 20, 1964, issue.\n\nIn the 1970s, university support for the paper fell significantly; for example, funding was cut more than 55 percent between 1971 and 1975. As a result, the newspaper was forced to increase its advertising fourfold and full page advertisements became common. The paper changed its format from tabloid to broadsheet in the fall of 1976. As the Georgetown student body became more diverse, coverage of minority student groups increased, and articles on the activities and concerns of African American and Jewish students appeared.\n\nWomen’s athletics received more detailed coverage, as did the impact of Title IX, and by the end of the decade, references to “girls” and “hoyettes” had been eliminated from the sports pages. Issues in the spring of 1973 contained coverage of attempts by gay students to organize and obtain official recognition.\n\nThe years of 1973 and 1974 saw a number of articles on the Nixon Administration and the Watergate scandal. The coverage of Watergate is possibly linked to the fact that a number of players in the Watergate investigations had Georgetown connections.\n\nIn the post-Watergate era, perhaps influenced by the event, The Hoya began to run investigative journalism pieces. As a result, the paper went from being viewed as generally supportive of the administration to being one of the university’s chief antagonists. The spring of 1977 brought perhaps the most significant example of this when a story about the firing of five resident assistants led to a university hearing about the entire residence life system and, ultimately, to the resignation of both a vice president and a dean.\n\nA number of significant changes to The Hoya’s production occurred during the 1980s. The first issue of 1980, produced on January 25, was the first to appear without the approval of a faculty moderator who had previously been a member of the editorial board. And, after six decades of appearing once a week, The Hoya moved to a twice-weekly schedule beginning in the fall of 1987. Other changes included the adoption of the current masthead in 1982 and the development of standard typefaces for headlines and copy.\n\nThe 1990s saw the consolidation and expansion of The Hoya’s entertainment coverage into a pullout arts and lifestyle section titled The Guide. The paper already had a long tradition of providing coverage and reviews of both on-campus and off-campus entertainment, with reviews of off-campus plays and movies first appearing in 1929.\n\nIn 1998, The Hoya launched a website. The Hoya also has two official blogs, The Fourth Edition, launched in 2012, which provides a lighthearted take on Georgetown and D.C. news, and Hoya Paranoia, launched in 2008, which covers university athletics throughout the year as well as providing commentary on national and international sports news.\n\nThe Hoya joined Facebook in 2008 and has been on Twitter since 2009.\n\nIn 2017, The Hoya announced its transition into an online-daily format, publishing articles on a daily rather than biweekly basis. In the move to an online format, the paper also reduced its print publication from two issues a week to one, cutting its Tuesday issue while retaining the weekly Friday edition.\n\nIn 2004, the newspaper began its official bid to gain financial independence from the university. The Hoya receives around $25,000 from Georgetown University for its operation annually. Late in 2004, the newspaper launched a publicity bid to build grassroots support for the proposition; the school seemed willing to allow the paper to split off, but not with the name \"The Hoya\", which administrators claimed belonged to the school. In 2007, the school filed for a trademark on the name.\n\nThe newspaper relaunched the campaign in early 2008 and circulated a petition that gained over 600 signatures from students and alumni. Though this campaign may have been successful, an April Fool's issue in 2009 put a hold on the independence movement. The issue included several articles that were perceived as racist and insensitive. The newspaper faced significant sanctions for the issue. In a Letter from the Editor in the first issue of the fall 2010 semester, The Hoya acknowledged that the notorious April Fools’ day issue of 2009 was distasteful, but assured its readers that the newspaper would no longer participate in satirical issues. No April Fools’ issues have been published since 2009. The Hoya's Board of Directors voted in 2010 to delay independence until the national economy and the paper's financial situation becomes more favorable.\n\nThe editorial division is responsible for decisions regarding the content of The Hoya. Two executive editors and the managing editor are selected at the end of the fall and spring semesters and serve for one-semester terms. Senior editors of each section are elected at the end of the fall and spring semesters. Each section’s deputy editors are appointed by the respective senior editor. Senior editors serve one-semester terms at a time, although the editor-in-chief serves for an entire calendar year. The current editor-in-chief is Kiera Geraghty.\n\nThe Editorial Board is composed of three staff members and three community members, and is chaired by the opinion editor. The Editorial Board, which produces The Hoya’s editorials, is an autonomous body whose views do not represent the opinions of The Hoya.\n\nThe publishing division manages the business operations. The general manager and departmental directors are hired by the Board of Directors. The current general manager is Dave Towell.\n\nThe Board of Directors oversees the overall strategic direction of the newspaper. The current chair of the board of directors is Amber Gillette.\n\nThe Hoya has won several national awards, including:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He also served as Government House Leader in the House of Commons of Canada during his tenure. On July 21, 2010, Hill announced that he would be retiring at the May 2011 federal election. In October 2010, he announced he would retire on October 25, 2010.\n\nOn June 12, 2018 it was announced that Hill would be joining western-based public affairs firm, New West Public Affairs, which is headed by former Conservative cabinet colleague, Monte Solberg.\n\nHill was born in Fort St. John, British Columbia. Before entering politics, Hill had served as the president of the B.C. Grain Producers Association, and as the Director for Grain with the B.C. Federation of Agriculture.\n\nHill was first elected as a member of the Parliament of Canada with the Reform Party of Canada in 1993. Hill generally voted along official party lines. He opposed changes to divorce laws that would reduce the amount of time divorced fathers spend with their children, and has attempted to help refugees get admitted to Canada. Additionally, Hill called for an inquiry into the Canadian Security Intelligence Service's role in the 1985 Air India bombing. Generally, he is viewed as a right wing Conservative, he has repeatedly called all Government surpluses overtaxation.\n\nAfter the Reform Party transformed into the Canadian Alliance in 2000, Hill was one of seven Members of Parliament ejected from caucus in 2001 for questioning the abilities of then-leader Stockwell Day. This group remained committed to the ideals of the Canadian Alliance, and formed the Democratic Representative Caucus (DR) as a way to maintain their efforts.\n\nHill served in various roles for his party, including Chief Whip as well as the opposition critic for National Defence, Transport and Justice ministries.

It mainly operates scheduled domestic and regional services. Its main bases are Talagi Airport and Moscow Domodedovo Airport. Nordavia is a joint-stock company.\n\nThe airline was formed in 1963 as Arkhangelsk United Aviation Squadron () and became AVL Arkhangelsk Airlines () in 1991. In August 2004 Aeroflot acquired 51% of the airline, with the rest being held by Aviainvest. The company was renamed Aeroflot-Nord, becoming Aeroflot's second regional airline. It joined the European Regions Airline Association in December 2006.\n\nSince the contract with Aeroflot ended on 1 December 2009, the airline has operated independently as Nordavia. Because of the bad press the subsidiary received following the Aeroflot Flight 821 disaster, and Russian aviation officials' 15 July 2009 imposition of restrictions (including a ban on international charter tours) on then Aeroflot-Nord flight operations due to insufficient security and bad finances, Aeroflot has distanced itself from Nordavia.\n\nIn March 2011, Aeroflot sold the airline to Norilsk Nickel for a reported US$7 million. Kommersant has quoted experts who believe that Norilsk Nickel may merge Nordavia with Taimyr Air Company, which is already owned by the company. On December 1, 2011 Norilsk Nickel reported that Nordavia is to be merged in Taimyr Air Company. Ultimately, due to the Federal Antimonopoly Service having blocked the merge of Nordavia with Taimyr Air Company, Nordavia was ultimately sold to Sergey Kuznetsov, the owner of Red Wings Airlines in March 2016.\n\nTo increase business power, Red Wings Airlines and Nordavia decided to merge. In April 2017, under Red Wings' ownership, it was announced that the airline would change its name to SmartAvia from Q3 2017. In addition to the new brand, the airline planned to also introduce a new livery, still in Nordavia's colors (blue, orange, gray) but with a design that moves away from its Aeroflot ancestry. The new branding was planned to debut on the airline's Airbus A320-200 aircraft, however these aircraft were instead delivered to Red Wings after the airline decided to continue using its Boeing 737 aircraft, accepting its first Boeing 737-700 in May 2018, by then still retaining its Nordavia name and brand identity.\n\nOn 20 March 2019, it was announced that the merging of Nordavia with Red Wings airlines was canceled. Instead, the airline is renamed to Smartavia, as part of re-branding. The airline will operate the aircraft under Nordavia brand until the end of 2019. The first aircraft with Smartavia brand arrived in April 2019.\n\nSmartavia Airlines has codeshare agreements with the following airlines:\n\n\n, the Nordavia fleet consists of the following aircraft:\n\n\n"}

F. Lawton and starring Shannon Tweed and Bill Maher. The film sends up many pop culture motifs and societal trends, including feminism (and feminist movements' fragmentation around various issues), B movies (particularly \"Cannibal Holocaust\"), celebrities, major writers and political figures, centred around a spoof of \"Heart of Darkness\". It was the first feature directed (under the pseudonym J. D. Athens) by screenwriter J. F. Lawton, who also authored \"Pretty Woman\", \"Under Siege\" and , and television show \"V.I.P.\"\n\nThe U.S. government grows worried for the nation's avocado supply after some confrontations with the \"Piranha\" tribe of cannibal women, who live in the mysterious \"Avocado Jungle\" (westernmost outpost: San Bernardino) and ritually sacrifice and eat men. The government recruits Margo Hunt (Tweed), a professor of feminist studies at a local university (\"Spritzer College\"), to travel into the Avocado Jungle and make contact with the women to attempt to convince them to move to a reservation/condo in Malibu. Along the way, she and her travelling companions — male chauvinist guide Jim (Maher) and ditzy undergraduate Bunny (Karen Mistal) — meet a tribe of subservient men called the \"Donnahew\" (a reference to talk-show host Phil Donahue) and face dangers in their path.\n\nEventually, the trio (Margo, Bunny and Jim) meets the Piranha women, who have recently taken Dr. Kurtz (played by Adrienne Barbeau) as their \"empress.\" Kurtz is Dr. Hunt's former colleague in feminist studies (the internationally famous author of \"Smart Women, Stupid Insensitive Men\") and now her nemesis; she has joined the tribe of Piranha women with her own exploitative agenda. The two argue about the morality of sacrificing men and the exploitation of the Piranha women, and Bunny decides to join the tribe, her first sacrifice being Jim. Bunny cannot go through with the kill, however, and Dr. Hunt escapes, aided by the handsome, intelligent, and sensitive Jean-Pierre (Brett Stimely), who also was to be sacrificed.\n\nDr. Margo Hunt finds in the jungle a rival tribe of cannibal women, the Barracuda Women, who are at war with the Piranha women due to differences over which condiment (guacamole or clam dip) most appropriately accompanies a meal of sacrificed man. Hunt returns to the Piranha stronghold with this other tribe and rescues Bunny and Jim as well as Jean-Pierre.\n\nMargo Hunt challenges Kurtz to a duel for supremacy, and they argue while fighting with various weapons; eventually, Margo impales Kurtz with a fencing sword. Kurtz explains her motives to Hunt in her last words: After ruling the Piranha tribe, she cannot return to civilization and the talk-show circuit. She then kills herself by plunging into a pit filled with water and piranha fish.\n\nHaving discovered the government plot to domesticate the Piranha women by providing aerobics classes and frequent exposure to \"Cosmopolitan\" magazine, Hunt refuses to bring the Piranha women with her, and instead persuades the warring cannibal tribes to reunite, maintaining the peace by means of consciousness raising groups.\n\nThe film ends happily for the trio of main characters: Bunny and Jim are to be married, and Jean-Pierre has enrolled at Dr. Hunt's university as a feminist studies major, becoming in the process the ideal companion for Hunt.\n\n\nThe film's plot loosely parallels that of novel \"Heart of Darkness\" by Joseph Conrad, as well as \"Apocalypse Now\", which was also partly based on \"Heart of Darkness\". Both \"Heart of Darkness\" and \"Apocalypse Now\" feature a character named Kurtz who has gone deep into the jungle to become the deranged leader of a group of \"savages\"; these peoples engage in barbaric rites as an alternative to the rigid and restrictive values of the outside world. The name of the character Ford Maddox, one of the men who recruits Margo to enter the jungle, refers to author Ford Madox Ford, who collaborated on three novels with Conrad (though not on \"Heart of Darkness\"). When Kurtz and Hunt battle with fencing swords, Kurtz is stabbed, and her dying words are: \"You don't know what it's like, trying to face David Letterman with a book on male insensitivity ... All right, I was exploiting the Piranha women. You don't know what it was like. David Letterman, God, the horror ... the horror of that show ... the horror.\" In \"Heart of Darkness\", Kurtz's dying words are: \"The horror! The horror!\"\n\n\nReviews for the film run the gamut.\n\nOne reviewer described it as \"a brilliantly absurd story\" and \"a hilariously tongue-in-cheek premise, wonderfully layered humor that runs from broad slapstick to clever satire, and a cast that's filled to the brim with beautiful women wearing very, very little.\"\n\nThe Digital Fix's reviewer wrote:\n\n\"TV Guide\" granted the movie 2 out of 4 stars: \"This film is not nearly as bad as it might have been, thanks largely to the leads. Moreover, CANNIBAL WOMEN does manage to be on target with its humor from time to time. But there are far more misses than hits as the movie also goes for the corny, the obvious, and the ancient.\"\n\nJulian White of \"Starburst\" (a British science fiction magazine), rated the movie 6 out of 10 stars, calling it \"a light-hearted romp\" and saying, \"It's all unashamedly joky and facetious, but also very likeable. The look of the film is rough and ready ... Even the biggest fans of this film would have to admit that director J. F. Lawton is unlikely to go down in history as one of cinema's great visual stylists. That said, he's a very capable screenwriter (as he subsequently demonstrated by penning such perennial favourites as \"Pretty Woman\" and \"Under Siege\"), and there are some surprisingly sophisticated one-liners lurking among the slapstick. True, the constant ribbing at feminists now seems very dated, but it's never mean-spirited, and anyway the girls give as good as they get.\"\n"}

It is played every hour on the hour, four times in succession in each of the four cardinal directions, by a trumpeter on the highest tower of the city's Saint Mary's Church. The noon performance is broadcast via radio to all of Poland and the world.\n\nThe real origin and author of the \"hejnał\" are unknown. The earliest written mention of it appears in civic pay records of 1392. The word \"hejnał\" comes from \"hajnal\", the Hungarian word for \"dawn\". These two facts fit well with a putative origin under King Louis I \"the Hungarian\" (r. in Poland 1370–82) or his daughter Jadwiga, Queen of Poland (r. 1384–99). Trumpet calls were used in many European cities to signal the opening and closing of city gates at dawn and dusk. The four directions in which the St. Mary's Trumpet Call is currently sounded correspond roughly to the four main Kraków gates before 3 out of 4 of the gates were demolished in the 19th century. 16th-century sources mention other trumpeters on other towers, and it is possible that the “interrupted” anthem was originally meant to allow a second trumpeter at a gate to signal the completion of the opening or closing of the gate. In historic times, trumpet calls on the St. Mary's Church tower were also used to warn of fires and other dangers.\n\nAccording to a popular 20th-century legend, during a Mongol invasion of Poland (the invasion usually cited is that of 1241), Mongol troops led by General Subutai approached Kraków. A sentry on a tower of St Mary's Church sounded the alarm by playing the \"Hejnał\", and the city gates were closed before the Tatars could ambush the city. The trumpeter, however, was shot in the throat and did not complete the anthem, and this is the legendary reason as to why performances end abruptly before completion.\n\nThe earliest written version of this legend is from the prologue to American Eric P. Kelly’s 1928 children's book \"The Trumpeter of Krakow\". Kelly, who was teaching at the Jagiellonian University on a scholar exchange in 1925-26, admitted that he did not speak the Polish language very well when he wrote the story, and had relied on French-speaking friends to translate. Part of the current legend may come from a more recent historic incident when a trumpeter died of natural causes while on duty at midnight on 7 July 1901. A 1926 tourist guide vaguely states that the death of a trumpeter was the reason for the premature ending of the anthem, but does not mention the Tartar siege or arrows.\n\nAnother possible reason is Ludwik Anczyc's 1861 version of the \"Lajkonik\" legend, which describes the sentry and the invading Tatars without mentioning arrows or the sentry's death. It is possible that Kelly was simply the first to write down the full version of an existing Cracovian legend that had escaped earlier collectors. It is also possible that he was the victim of a hoax or accidentally conflated two different stories. It is certainly remarkable that Professor Karol Estreicher, Jr.’s thorough 1931 guide to Kraków does not include the story.\n\nWhatever the origins of Kelly's story, it proved popular in Kraków. The first written version of the full Tartars and arrows version in Polish is from a 1935 tourist guide. The second appears in a fiction sequel by Ksawery Pruszyński (who was a student at the Jagiellonian University while Kelly was teaching and was later Estreicher's assistant) entitled \"The Trumpeter of Samarkand\" which also ties into the Lajkonik legend. After the Second World War, Kelly's role in the legend was largely forgotten and the legend began to be passed down in true folk fashion.\n\nAnother recent tradition has it that the four directions in which the tune is played are in honour of the King (southwards towards Wawel Castle); the Mayor or Bishop towards City Hall or Bishop's Palace on Kanonicza Street, the citizens towards Main Market Square, and the peasants and visitors (towards the fields outside Kraków and the Barbican of Krakow). At the end of each tune the trumpeter waves at the people in the square who are expected to wave back.\n\nThe \"Hejnał\" was traditionally played twice a day, usually at dawn and dusk; noon was added later. Today, the trumpeter plays hourly, though sleepy trumpeters are sometimes reported to have missed one of the early morning hours. Since 1927 the \"Hejnał\" has been broadcast live on Polskie Radio (the Polish national radio station) from St Mary's Church daily at noon.\n\nThe Kraków \"Hejnał\" is well known throughout Poland and has been used as a national symbol. During the Second World War, a bugler from the 2nd Polish Corps played the tune to announce the Polish victory in the Battle of Monte Cassino on 18 May 1944.\n\nHistorical records show that the practise of playing the \"Hejnał\" has been cancelled and then later reinstated several times, with a particularly long gap before it was reinstated in 1810. The \"Hejnał Mariacki\" was replaced twice by the mourning song \"Łzy Matki\" (English: \"The Tears of the Mother\"). The first time was at noon on 3 April 2005, due to the death of Pope John Paul II the previous day, and the second at two minutes after noon on 11 April 2010 following the deaths of President Lech Kaczyński and his consort, Maria Kaczyńska.\n\nOriginally played by the town guard, since the 19th century the \"Hejnał\" has been performed by active members of the fire brigade, who also use the church tower as a lookout post. Currently, there are at least four different buglers serving in shifts at the tower.\n\nThe longest-serving trumpeter was Adolf Śmietana, who played the \"Hejnał\" for 36 years beginning in 1926. The Kołton family has played the \"Hejnał\" for three consecutive generations. In October 2004, Jan Kołton retired after 33 years of service at the tower. His father had been a \"Hejnał\" bugler for 35 years previously, while his son is one of the four current buglers.\n\nOn 11 June 2000 the melody was listed in the \"Guinness Book of Records\" after it was played by almost 2,000 trumpeters from all over the world. They included military orchestras from Poland, the United Kingdom, Belgium and Spain, as well as civilians. The youngest bugler was eight years old; the oldest was 79.\n\n\n\n"}

A United Artists movie theater opened in August 1984, to close in 1999; the space has been converted for retail use. May Company closed in January 1993 as one of the 12 J. W. Robinson's and May Company stores closing due to the merging of the two department stores to form Robinson's-May and in November of that same year, the closed May Company became a discount chain Fedco.\n\nThe mall was neglected in the 1980s and 1990s even as the local retail market changed. In 1995 a group controlled by the Pritzker family of Chicago bought the mall for $41 million from Australia's City Freeholds, Inc., and planned a $120 million renovation.\n\nThe modernization was stalled for several years. After FedCo closed, the leaseholder sought to sublet the space to Gigante, a Mexican supermarket chain, and opposed a major renovation. Target, which had acquired FedCo in 1999, refused to allow the lease to be transferred to another discount retailer. Finally, in late 2001, the city of Buena Park itself paid $3.2 million to take over the Fedco lease and transfer it to Walmart, which now occupies the space.

He was first elected to the post in 2001 after four terms as mayor of Glen Cove, New York. In 2006, he ran unsuccessfully against Eliot Spitzer for the Democratic nomination for Governor of New York. Suozzi was narrowly defeated for re-election in 2009 by Republican nominee Ed Mangano, and in a rematch in 2013 was again defeated, this time by a much larger margin of 59% to 41%. He was first elected to United States House of Representatives in 2016 and then reelected in 2018.\n\nSuozzi currently sits on the House Ways and Means Committee and the Congressional Executive Commission on China. Suozzi formerly sat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the House Armed Services Committee.\n\nThe son of former Glen Cove mayor Joseph A. Suozzi, Thomas Suozzi was born on August 31, 1962 in Glen Cove. His father, Joseph, was born in Italy and his mother, Marguerite, is of Irish and English descent. The youngest of five siblings, Tom Suozzi attended Catholic schools, graduating from Chaminade High School, Boston College, and Fordham University School of Law. He is trained as both a lawyer and a CPA. Suozzi and his wife, Helene, have three children.\n\nIn 1993, Suozzi was elected mayor of Glen Cove, New York. He was in that municipality's mayoral office for four terms.\n\nHis father and his uncle, Vincent Suozzi, respectively, were mayors of Glen Cove prior to Tom Suozzi. \n\nAs mayor, Suozzi focused on environmental cleanup of commercial and industrial sites in Glen Cove. A focal point of his administration was redeveloping brownfield and superfund sites. In 1994, the Glen Cove incinerator was permanently closed and dismantled. Under Suozzi's tenure, Glen Cove was also given a credit rating of A-3. At the time, this was the cities highest rating since the 1970s. Suozzi also helped to revitalize downtown Glen Cove by building a new city hall, courthouse, police station, EMS building, new sidewalks, new street lamps, and construction of a multilevel parking garage.\n\nIn 1998, the city demolished and redeveloped the defunct Li Tungsten Refinery grounds, a federal superfund site.\n\nHe was recognized by then-Vice President Al Gore for the city's environmental cleanup efforts and Glen Cove was awarded the Brownfields Award in 1998.\n\nIn 2000, Glen Cove won first place in the New York Conference of Mayors’ Main Street Award for its downtown revitalization efforts, while Suozzi was Mayor. \n\nSuozzi was elected Nassau County Executive in 2001, becoming the first Democrat elected to the position in traditionally Republican Nassau in 30 years. He assumed office in the midst of a fiscal crisis. By 1999, Nassau was on the brink of financial collapse: the county faced a $300 million annual deficit, was billions of dollars in debt, and its credit rating had sunk to one level above junk status. According to \"The New York Times\", he \"earned high marks from independent institutions for his signature achievement, the resuscitation of Nassau's finances.\"\n\nWhile in office, Suozzi cut spending and reduced borrowing and debt. He also oversaw 11 county bond upgrades over the course of two years, eliminated deficits in Nassau, and accumulated surpluses. In 2005, \"Governing Magazine\" named Suozzi one of its Public Officials of the Year, calling him \"the man who spearheaded Nassau County, New York's, remarkable turnaround from the brink of fiscal disaster.\" According to \"The New York Times\", Suozzi garnered praise for social services like his \"no wrong door\" program, which centralized access to social services.\n\nIn 2004, Suozzi launched the \"Fix Albany\" campaign which aimed to root out corruption in the New York State government. At the time, \"The New York Times Editorial Board\", wrote an op-ed titled \"Thomas Suozzi's Excellent Idea.\" \n\nIn 2008, Suozzi was named New York State Environmentalist of the Year by the League of Conservation Voters for sourcing \"25 percent of the county’s energy from renewable sources, and he helped pass a $150 million bond program to preserve open space and protect Long Island Sound.\" \n\nSuozzi was also named the previously named as Person of the Year by the New York Immigration Coalition for his work as County Executive for \"creating an environment of welcome and inclusion for immigrants in Nassau during his tenure.\"\n\nIn 2004, Georgina Morgenstern, a former Nassau County planning department employee, alleged Suozzi and Chief Deputy County Executive Anthony Cancellieri used county employees, resources and functions for illegal fundraising. Morgenstern said she was retaliated against and terminated without due process, and she subsequently filed a multimillion-dollar lawsuit. Suozzi was dismissed from the case and a federal jury in Central Islip rejected Morgenstern's claim that she was fired in retaliation for her criticism of Suozzi.\n\nSuozzi declared that he was running for Governor of New York in the Democratic primary against Eliot Spitzer on February 25, 2006. The bid appeared from the start to be somewhat of a long shot given Spitzer's reputation as a \"corporate crusader\", though Suozzi often pointed out that he prevailed as a long shot before when he first ran for Nassau County Executive. During the campaign, Suozzi pointed to his experience as a Chief Executive with the campaign slogan being, \"I can do it, because I’ve done it”.\n\nFew prominent Democrats outside of Nassau County Democratic Party Chairman Jay Jacobs supported his bid; most of New York's Democratic legislators and mayors campaigned with Spitzer. The campaign was funded in part by Home Depot co-founder Kenneth Langone, former NYSE CEO Richard Grasso, David Mack of the MTA, and many individuals on Wall Street who had been investigated and prosecuted by Eliot Spitzer.\n\nOn June 13, 2006, Suozzi spoke before the New York State Conference of Mayors along with Spitzer and John Faso. Suozzi received a standing ovation by the crowd of mayors. On July 6, 2006, Suozzi announced to his followers that he had collected enough petitions to place himself on the ballot in the primary against Spitzer. He claimed victory to the press in the debate on July 25, 2006 with New York State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer held at Pace University. He stated he had presidential aspirations during the course of this debate.\n\nOn August 7, 2006, Suozzi announced after much speculation that he would not seek an independent line were he to lose the primary to Spitzer.\n\nSuozzi lost the 2009 county executive election to Ed Mangano by 286 votes out of 250,000 which were cast that year. In a post election editorial, \"A Misguided Tax Revolt\" \"The New York Times\" wrote: \"Mr. Suozzi was elected in 2001 to pull Nassau out of a fiscal ditch, and he did over the hard-core opposition of an intransigent Republican minority. He brimmed with ideas to reinvigorate the local economy and was an early leader of the crusade to repair Albany’s rancid political culture. He had big plans for a third term, but they were whomped by the recession and a little-known Republican, Edward Mangano, who also ran for the newly invented Tax Revolt Party.\" \n\n\"The Times\" also noted that: “tax weary voters went after the wrong party,” and they further stated “The prime reformer for cutting taxes and putting the county economy on solid footing has been Mr. Suozzi. He led a campaign to curb costly state mandates on local governments and pushed an ambitious plan for development in faded downtowns and in central Nassau.”\n\nAfter first working in the private sector as an attorney, Suozzi announced that he would seek a rematch against Mangano in 2013. He attacked Mangano for \"presiding over a decline in the county\", while also emphasizing that, while he was County Executive, Suozzi had eight years of balanced budgets and reduced crime. In November, Mangano easily defeated Suozzi, 59 percent to 41.\n\nIn June 2016, Suozzi won a five-way Democratic primary in New York's 3rd congressional district. Suozzi received endorsements from \"The New York Times\", \"Newsday\", and \"The Island Now\". He narrowly defeated Republican state Senator Jack Martins in the general election on November 8, 2016, and began representing New York's 3rd congressional district in the 115th United States Congress in January 2017.\n\nIn June 2018, Suozzi won the unchallenged Democratic primary. In 2018, Suozzi defeated Republican Dan DeBono, future Trump Administration Chief Infrastructure Funding Officer and former trader and investment banker with an 18 point margin. \n\nSuozzi has led multiple initiatives with the entire New York congressional delegation (Republicans and Democrats), which resulted in federal money for hospitals being allocated based on the number of COVID-19 positive cases in a state. He helped lead the entire Long Island congressional delegation in convincing the Federal Reserve to allow Nassau and Suffolk counties to access hundreds of millions of dollars in federal relief. Suozzi has also been a voice in Congress in calling on banks and financial institutions to ensure that every small business has access to loans and grants provided for in the \"CARES Act\", regardless of size.\n\nOn Long Island, Suozzi has personally helped deliver thousands of gowns, masks, and gloves directly to front line workers and meals to the elderly and vulnerable. He has also worked to keep his constituents updated on the latest news regarding the pandemic, sending messages and hosting town halls to keep more than 100,000 NY-03 residents up-to-date on best practices, the latest federal action, and the resources that are available to his constituents.\nSuozzi lead the introduction for legislation, which then passed the House in December 2019, that would help to fully restore the State and Local Tax (SALT) Deduction], which was capped at $10,000 in 2017. According to CNN, Suozzi \"has railed about the negative effect a 2017 cap on the state and local tax deduction has had on his Long Island district for years.\" \n\nAt the start of the 116th Congress and at Suozzi's urging, a congressional SALT working group was formed to explore the impact of limiting the SALT deduction and build consensus for a repeal of the limit.\nSuozzi cosponsored and helped pass the \"Climate Action Now Act\", a bill that reverses President Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris Agreement. As a member of the House Ways and Means Committee, Suozzi helped introduce the \"Growing Renewable Energy and Efficiency Now (GREEN) Act\". This legislation encourages and incentivizes the deployment and production of cleaner, safer, and more sustainable energy technologies such as solar, wind, and geothermal.\n\nOnL ong Island Suozzi has, since arriving to Congress in 2017, increased federal funding to protect and preserve the Long Island Sound by almost 500%. He has also secured tens of millions of dollars in funding increases to clean up the Navy-Grumman Plume while holding both the Navy and Northrop Grumman accountable. \nSuozzi is a cosponsor of and voted for the \"DREAM\" Act, which would provide a path to legal status for DACA recipients. He has also co-sponsored, voted for, and helped secure support for several House-passed bills which would improve conditions at the border.\n\nSuozzi visited the United States southern border, twice, to inspect conditions at detention facilities housing migrants. As a first-generation American, Suozzi has opposed Trump Administration’s immigration policies. While he favors strong borders, he is committed to restoring American values to our debate on immigration.\nSuozzi has said we need to “mend, not end,” the \"Affordable Care Act\". He believes that we must build on President Obama’s signature law to expand access to healthcare and lower costs for all Americans.\n\nSuozzi also believes that the cost of prescription drugs must be reduced and supports allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical companies. As a member of the Ways and Means Committee, Suozzi was instrumental in the House passage of the \"Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Cost Now Act\", which will ensure that Americans can afford the medication they need to remain healthy.\nSuozzi has voted for legislation to support universal background checks and the banning of assault weapons and continues to support \"red flag\" laws.\n\nOn Long Island, Suozzi has worked closely with gun violence prevention activist, Linda Beigel Schulman, who lost her son Scott in the tragic 2018 Parkland shootings. Together, they have held rallies, press conferences, and other events to emphasize that this should not be a partisan issue. This is about the safety of our communities and the lives of our loved ones. \n\nSuozzi has been endorsed by the Brady Campaign and has been named a Gun Sense Candidate by Moms Demand Action and Everytown for Gun Safety.\nIn Washington, Suozzi has secured tens of millions of dollars for housing and other programs that would ease new veterans’ transition back to civilian life. He has also worked to combat the veteran suicide crisis across the United States by introducing and supporting legislation which would expand access to mental health for all veterans, regardless of discharge status.\n\nOn Long Island, Suozzi has worked closely with each Northport VA Director, and the Department of Veterans Affairs, to improve services for veterans and address the physical conditions of the facilities, including expediting the demolition of buildings 1 and 2. Suozzi's goal is to work with the Northport VA, the Department, and all stakeholders to turn the Center into a model for VA facilities across the nation and will continue to push for ongoing improvements to realize that goal.\nAs a member of the Congressional Executive Commission on China, Suozzi helped write bills that will allow the United States government to put additional pressure on the Chinese government's inhumane policy of holding more than 1 million Uighur Muslims in detention camps. Suozzi has also voiced support for Democracy Activists in Hong Kong. \n\nSuozzi has also used his voice as a member of Congress to advocate for people around the world who have faced persecution for simply practicing their faith. From the persecution of Muslims in China to anti-Semitism here in the United States, Suozzi has spoken out in order to help those who wish to practice their faith without fear of oppression and mistreatment.\nSuozzi describes himself as a strong supporter of the state of Israel. He has traveled to Israel in both a personal and congressional capacity over the years. \n\nIn the House of Representatives, Suozzi has:\n\nSuozzi’s priorities for infrastructure reform include: waste and drinking water improvements; ensuring upgrades for the Long Island Railroad; increasing access and updates to Glen Cove Ferry and New York City public transit; stabilizing the Highway Trust Fund to improve local roads on Long Island; green energy production, electric vehicles, and the accompanying infrastructure to support them; public school modernization; and funding, expediting and advancing Gateway.\nIn 2019, the House passed Suozzi's resolution, H.Res.585, \"Reaffirming support for the Good Friday Agreement\" and other agreements to ensure a lasting peace in Northern Ireland.\" The House of Representatives has also passed Suozzi's resolution calling for concluding a \"mutually agreeable, multi-year\" defense cost-sharing deal with South Korea.\n\nIn January 2020, Suozzi led the Long Island delegation in sending a letter to top national security officials asking them to investigate whether foreign countries are contributing to the rise of hate in the United States.\nSuozzi is a member of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, the United States Congressional International Conservation Caucus and the Climate Solutions Caucus.\n\nHe is vice-chair of the Bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus, which consists of 22 Democrats and 22 Republicans.

{"id": "1846915", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1846915", "title": "Stadion Maksimir", "text": "Stadion Maksimir\n\nMaksimir Stadium (), is a multi-use football stadium based in the Croatian capital, Zagreb. It takes its name from the surrounding neighbourhood of Maksimir. The venue is primarily the home of Dinamo Zagreb, the top club of the country with 20 league titles, but it is also the home venue of the Croatia national football team. First opened in 1912, it has undergone many facelifts, and its current layout dates from a 1997 rebuilding. The stadium also sometimes hosts other events such as rock concerts.\n\nThe stadium was first opened on 5 May 1912. On 26 May 1941, a representative of the Ustashe fascist government of the Independent State of Croatia addressed young Zagreb students at their meeting at the Maksimir Stadium, and at one point ordered the Serbian and Jewish students to be segregated, but the children disobeyed. Soon afterwards, in June 1941, rebel youths burned the stadium down. In 1977, a movie \"Operation Stadium\" was made to commemorate the segregation incident.\n\nWhen the UEFA Euro 1976 final tournament was held in Yugoslavia, Maksimir hosted the Netherlands v. Czechoslovakia semi-final match and the Netherlands v. Yugoslavia third place match.\n\nMaksimir was the central venue for the 1987 Summer Universiade hosted by the city of Zagreb.\n\nIn 1990, several events happened at Maksimir. On 13 May, the Dinamo Zagreb–Red Star Belgrade riot took place, an infamous riot involving Dinamo Zagreb and Red Star Belgrade supporters. The last match of the Yugoslavia national football team was hosted at Maksimir on 3 June. On 17 October of the same year, Croatia played the United States in what was Croatia's first match in the modern era.\n\nIn 1998, plans were made for a massive renovation, and the first phase started the same year. The old northern stand was demolished and a new one built within a year. This renovation increased Maksimir's seating capacity to 38,079.\n\nAfter 1992, for 16 years the Croatian football team had a proud unbeaten record at this stadium in any competitive match, however on 10 September 2008 (two years after suffering a 2-0 defeat at the same venue) England became the first team to beat Croatia in Zagreb, winning 4-1, ending a thirty match undefeated streak.\n\nIn the summer of 2011, a little, but much needed \"facelifting\" was made on the stadium. All seats were replaced, a new drainage system, under-soil heating and automatic watering were installed along with a new turf, the athletic track was covered with blue artificial grass and all brick surfaces were covered in blue cloth.\n\nFour stands (8 sectors) contribute to the total seating capacity of 35,423:\n\n\nThe stadium has also been used as the venue for some big concerts, including:\n\nAccording to the 1998 plans, renovation was to include lowering the lawn and making the \"ring\" round the pitch in the place of running track and thus gain 16,000 new seats with the annex to the south stand with the final addition of a modern roof structure. Maksimir was to have 60,000 comfortable sitting places and was to be an exclusively football stadium like many others in Europe.\n\nIt has additionally been planned to build: new premises for Club's Management, Elegant \"Blue Lounge\", Big \"Trophy room\", football school premises, changing room, coach staff room, sports hall with gym, out patient clinic, restaurant, luxury hotel (\"A\" category) with 46 beds for visiting teams special importance will be given to the building which will connect west stand to the north stand. By this, all the conditions for hosting and organizing big European matches would be fulfilled, including UEFA offices, press club, press center, V.I.P. hospitality, etc. With that, the venue was to be one of the best equipped stadiums in Europe. However, in the beginning of the 2000s, the renovations were suspended.\n\nAs of December 2007, the public was awaiting the presentation of new stadium, and in 2008 city government presented two potential stadiums, new Maksimir and Vulkan (Volcano) which is supposed to be built on another location (Kajzerica) in Zagreb and old Maksimir should then be knocked down, the citizens were to choose which one they want on the referendum predicted to take place somewhere in the near future. However, the city government never made any progress with referendum or these plans and the stadium remains to be a problem to the city for a decade now.\n\nBetween 1997 and 2015, a total of HRK 800 million (c. €108 million) has been spent renovating the stadium.\n\nStadion Kajzerica was a proposed new football stadium to be built in the Kajzerica neighborhood in Zagreb, intended to replace Stadion Maksimir as the home of the Croatia national football team and Dinamo Zagreb.\n\nThe design competition for the new stadium was won by architect Hrvoje Njirić in May 2008. The winning design, nicknamed The Blue Volcano () by the press, would have a capacity of 55,000 and would include a blue-coloured polycarbonate dome exterior and a cloud-like structure suspended above the stadium covered in photovoltaic panels.\n\nThe project had originally been intended to go ahead after it gained approval in a public referendum in which citizens of Zagreb would vote whether they would rather have the current Stadion Maksimir torn down and re-built in the same location (which would cost at least 264 million euros, according to offers submitted by construction companies) or replaced by an entirely new stadium at Kajzerica (whose construction cost is still unknown).\n\nAccording to the initial plan the first option would include building a smaller venue at Kajzerica between 2009 and 2011 which would then be used to host Dinamo Zagreb's matches while Maksimir stadium is undergoing rebuilding in the period between 2011 and 2014. The other option would include building the purpose-built 55,000 capacity Blue Volcano at Kajzerica, which would then become the Blues' permanent home.\n\nHowever, the referendum about the stadium, which had originally been scheduled for June 2008, was postponed several times since and has not been held.\n\nIn October 2012, the project was abandoned, to be briefly revived in 2013 with an eye to a possible UEFA Euro 2020 bid, and again in 2018, following Croatia's historic success in the World Cup.\n"}

The British series was inspired by the Lonely Planet travelbooks and began airing in 1994. \"Globe Trekker\" is broadcast in over 40 countries across six continents. The program won over 20 international awards, including six American Cable Ace awards.\n\nEach episode features a host, called a \"traveller\", who travels with a camera crew to a country/major city and experiences the sights, sounds, and culture that the location has to offer. Special episodes feature in-depth city, beach, ape, nature, road trip, pilgrimage, slave trade, historic site, pirate, animal, dive, volcano, war, shopping, journey, history, festival, and food guides.\n\nThe show often goes far beyond popular tourist destinations in order to give viewers a more authentic look at local culture. Presenters usually participate in different aspects of regional life, such as attending a traditional wedding or visiting a mining community. They address the viewer directly, acting as tourists-turned-tour guides, but are also filmed interacting with locals and discovering interesting locations in (mostly) unrehearsed sequences. \"Globe Trekker\" also sometimes includes brief interviews with backpackers who share tips on independent travel in that particular country or city.\n\nIt usually takes 12 to 15 weeks to complete an episode of the show from start to finish, including at least four weeks of research, three weeks of planning and preparation (speaking to tourist boards, making travel arrangements), two to three weeks of actual filming, and three weeks of editing and post-production.\n\nThe traveller is often accompanied by five or six members of camera and production crew, who almost never appear on camera. Specifically, the crew consists of a camera operator and a sound technician, plus a producer and a director, who scout locations two weeks before filming. A driver, pilot, or other type of facilitator is often hired locally. A traveller and crew almost never spend more than three nights in one particular area.\n\nThe series is known for its distinctive theme and background music, which consists largely of instrumental, downtempo, electronic dance compositions containing global folk music elements. Most of the music is written for the show by Ian Ritchie, Michael Conn, Colin Winston-Fletcher, with additional music from Makoto Sakamoto, Nainita Desai & Malcolm Laws, Nomad, Jesper Mattsson, The Insects, The West India Company, Stephen Luscombe, and Pandit Dinesh. Several collection of tracks from the show have been released as albums, including \"Globe Trekker: Ambient Journeys\", \"Globe Trekker: Earth Journeys\" (volumes 1 and 2), \"Globe Trekker: Music From The TV Series\" (volumes 1 and 2), \"Globe Trekker: Asian Journeys\", \"Globe Trekker: Latin American Journeys\", and \"Globe Trekker: World Jam\".\n\nPilot Productions employs several presenters for its variety of programs which include Planet Food, Bazaar, World Cafe, and Treks in a Wild World.

{"id": "1846941", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1846941", "title": "Ricky Morton", "text": "Ricky Morton\n\nRichard Wendell Morton (born September 21, 1956) is an American professional wrestler, currently performing on the independent circuit. For most of his career, Morton has performed with Robert Gibson as The Rock N' Roll Express, described as \"the consummate baby face tag team\". Morton has wrestled for multiple promotions in the United States including the Continental Wrestling Association, Mid-South Wrestling, Jim Crockett Promotions, World Championship Wrestling, Smoky Mountain Wrestling, the World Wrestling Federation, and Extreme Championship Wrestling, as well as the Japanese promotions All Japan Pro Wrestling, New Japan Pro Wrestling, and Wrestle Association R. \n\nMorton has held dozens of championships throughout his career, including the NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship, NWA World Tag Team Championship, USWA Unified World Heavyweight Championship, USWA World Tag Team Championship, and WCW World Six-Man Tag Team Championship. He has been inducted into the NWA Hall of Fame, Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame, and WWE Hall of Fame. His skill at driving audiences into a sympathetic frenzy by convincingly selling pain gave rise to the expression \"playing Ricky Morton\".\n\nMorton was trained by his father, Paul, and by veteran wrestler Ken Lucas. He debuted in 1978, facing Ken Wayne in his debut match. He wrestled primarily for the Continental Wrestling Association in Memphis, Tennessee, often teaming with Lucas or Eddie Gilbert. Morton quickly became a popular performer thanks to his \"athletic prowess\", \"sensational looks\", and \"spiky blond mullet\". His popularity with female fans saw him dubbed a \"teen idol\".\n\nIn early 1983, promoters Jerry Jarrett and Jerry Lawler paired Morton with Robert Gibson as The Rock 'n' Roll Express in an attempt to replicate the popularity of The Fabulous Ones. They won the Mid-South Tag Team Title three times and feuded with the team that would become their archrivals, The Midnight Express of Bobby Eaton and Dennis Condrey. Because of his small stature and good looks, he was usually made the \"Face in Peril\", meaning he would be the one to take most of the punishment in the matches to get the fans behind the team. He was also the one that always suffered a humiliation or \"injury\" to further the storyline the team would be involved in. Nowadays, this is sometimes referred to as \"Playing Ricky Morton\". In the early 80s Ricky formed a successful tag team with Robert Gibson in Joe Blanchard's South West wrestling territory feuding with The Grapplers.\n\nIn 1984, Morton took part in a high profile angle with Randy Savage which saw Savage piledrive him through a table at ringside.\n\nIn 1981, Morton began wrestling for NWA Tri-State. He formed a tag team with Eddie Gilbert, winning the NWA Tri-State Tag Team Championship twice. His second reign ended in August 1981 when he left the promotion.\n\nIn 1984, Morton and Gibson began wrestling regularly for Mid-South Wrestling, the successor to NWA Tri-State. They won the Mid-South Tag Team Championship three times during 1984, trading the titles with The Midnight Express. Their third and final reign lasted until March 1985, when they lost to Steve Williams and Ted DiBiase. They continued to appear with Mid-South Wrestling until June 1985.\n\nMorton and Gibson reappeared with Mid-South Wrestling, by then renamed the Universal Wrestling Federation, throughout 1986. At the \"Superdome Extravaganza\" supercard in the Louisiana Superdome in June 1986, Morton unsuccessfully challenged Ric Flair for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship.\n\nIn 1985, both teams moved on to the NWA's Jim Crockett Promotions and became famous due to the national television exposure of TBS. Ricky and Robert had a major feud with the \"Russians\", Ivan and Nikita Koloff and won the NWA World Tag Team Title. They traded the title again with the Russians and lost them to their hated rivals the Midnight Express on February 2, 1986 during \"Superstars on the Superstation\" due to their manager, Jim Cornette. Cornette used his tennis racket on Robert to help his team win.\n\nFearing that his self-proclaimed sex appeal with women was being threatened by Morton, NWA Champion Ric Flair began a feud with Morton in 1986. In the spring of that year, Morton was having an interview at ringside when Flair came onto the set and insulted Morton's fans (who consisted mostly of tween girls) by calling them \"teenyboppers in their training bras.\" He gave Morton a training bra as a \"gift from one of Flair's girlfriends\" and told Morton that he couldn't handle real, grown-up women. In response, Morton stomped on Flair's sunglasses. This led to a fight and then a series of matches, the most notable being their Steel Cage match at the 1986 Great American Bash. To help build Morton as a serious title contender, it was pointed out that he once went to a one-hour draw with then-AWA Champion Nick Bockwinkel. Morton never won the title but he proved that he was of the same caliber as Flair was in the ring. At one point in the feud with Flair, after a six-man tag team elimination match in which Morton pinned Flair to become the winner, Flair and the other three Four Horsemen invaded the Rock 'n' Roll Express' dressing room and attacked Morton, rubbing his face on the concrete floor, causing a grotesque-looking facial injury. They also broke his nose in another attack. Horsemen member Arn Anderson would also make fun of Morton, calling him \"Punky Morton,\" which was a play on the popular 1980s sitcom \"Punky Brewster\". The term used to belittle Morton backfired when fans began to use it as a term of endearment. Morton and Gibson won the title back from the Midnight Express and feuded with Ole and Arn Anderson for the rest of the year. They culminated this feud with a win over the Andersons in a cage match at Starrcade on November 28. This victory started the Horsemen's dissatisfaction with Ole, who was kicked out of the stable just months later. Morton and Gibson then lost the title to Rick Rude and Manny Fernandez on December 6, 1986, whom they feuded with from December 1986 to June 1987. When Rude left for the World Wrestling Federation, the title was given back to the Rock & Roll Express, with the explanation that they won the title accompanied by footage of a prior non-title match won by the Rock & Roll Express where they pinned the champions.\n\nMorton and Gibson then feuded briefly with the New Breed, Sean Royal and Chris Champion, but this feud ended when the New Breed were injured in an auto accident. Their next feud was with Arn Anderson and Tully Blanchard, who won the title from them on September 29, 1987 after Jim Cornette's new Midnight Express of Bobby Eaton and Stan Lane attacked them and injured Morton's arm and shoulder. Morton came out in the middle of the match and blindly tagged Gibson and courageously tried to wrestle but the Horsemen soon took advantage and Gibson gave up the match to save Morton more pain. They feuded for a few months with the Horsemen keeping the titles by getting themselves disqualified, and injuring Gibson's ribs.\n\nIn May 1988, Morton and Gibson toured Japan with All Japan Pro Wrestling, competing in the Super Power Series and facing teams including Samson Fuyuki and Toshiaki Kawada, Shinichi Nakano and Tiger Mask, and Isamu Teranishi and Masanobu Fuchi. They returned for a second tour on October 1988, this time competing in the October Giant Series. In the final match of their tour they unsuccessfully challenged Fuyuki and Kawada for the All Asia Tag Team Championship.\n\nIn 1989, Morton and Gibson went to United States Wrestling Association were they feuded with Wildside (Chris Champion and Mark Starr) and The Blackbirds, King Parsons and Action Jackson. Later that year he teamed with his cousin, Todd Morton and won the CWA Tag team titles.\n\nThey returned to World Championship Wrestling in 1990. Gibson injured his knee and Morton teamed with Big Josh and Junkyard Dog to win the WCW World Six-Man Tag Team Championship.\n\nOn June 12, 1991, at Clash of the Champions XV, Morton was in the ring to accept an invitation by Alexandra York to join her York Foundation. Gibson appeared and said he was healthy and ready to go and to everybody's shock, Morton turned on Gibson and beat him down before leaving with York, Mr. Hughes and Terrence Taylor. He changed his name to Richard Morton and they soon added Tommy Rich, who became Thomas Rich. They feuded with Gibson, Dustin Rhodes and Bobby Eaton and won the WCW World Six-Man Tag Team Title. At The Great American Bash in July 1991, Morton defeated Gibson. In October 1991 at Halloween Havoc, Morton lost to Flyin' Brian in a bout for the newly created WCW Light Heavyweight Championship.\n\nThey disbanded in early 1992 and Morton was used as a preliminary heel jobber where he teamed with various heels like Diamond Dallas Page. Morton made his last WCW TV appearance in a match against Barry Windham on July 18, 1992.\n\nMorton and Gibson returned to World Championship Wrestling in January 1993 feuding with The Heavenly Bodies. They appeared at SuperBrawl III and defeated Heavenly Bodies.\n\nIn 1992, Morton joined Smoky Mountain Wrestling and reformed the Rock & Roll Express with Gibson on August 8, 1992 in a match at Johnson City Tennessee. They went back and forth to the two promotions. They feuded with two versions of The Heavenly Bodies for the next year and a half, Stan Lane and Tom Prichard, and Prichard and Jimmy Del Ray. They feuded with The Gangstas (New Jack and Mustafa Saed) in 1994 and went to the NWA to win the Tag Title again in 1995. During 1995 he also teamed briefly with David Jericho. Later that year, he reunited with Gibson and they feuded with PG-13. Both Morton and Gibson left USWA in 1996.\n\nIn 1993, Morton and Gibson debuted in the World Wrestling Federation on the September 27, 1993, episode of \"Monday Night Raw\", defeating Barry Hardy and Duane Gill. Recognized on WWF television as the SMW Tag Team Champions, they went on to defend the championship in bouts on \"WWF All American Wrestling\" and \"WWF Superstars\". At Survivor Series on November 24, 1993, they lost the championship to The Heavenly Bodies (Tom Prichard and Jimmy Del Ray), leaving the WWF thereafter.\n\nMorton and Gibson briefly returned to the WWF in July 1994, joining the WWF Summer Fest tour of Germany and losing a series of matches to The Smoking Gunns.\n\nIn July 1993, Morton and Gibson toured Japan with Wrestle Association R, facing Último Dragón and Yuji Yasuraoka in a series of bouts. They returned for a second tour in November 1994 as part of the WAR-ISM 1994 event, facing members of Fuyuki-Gun on several occasions.\n\nMorton and Gibson returned to World Championship Wrestling on the June 3, 1996 episode of \"WCW Monday Nitro\". They briefly feuded with The Four Horsemen. They remained with the promotion until October 1996.\n\nIn May 1996, Morton and Gibson wrestled four bouts for the Japanese promotion Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling (FMW). At the FMW 7th Anniversary Show in Kawasaki Stadium, Morton, Gibson and Ricky Fuji defeated Boogie Man, Crypt Keeper, and Freddy Krueger in a six-man tag team bout.\n\nMorton returned for a second tour with FMW in April 1997, participating in the \"Fighting Creation\" tournament as part of a three-man team with Fuji and Hayabusa. At the FMW 8th Anniversary Show in Yokohama Arena, he and Fuji defeated Dragon Winger and Hido. Morton returned once more in August 1997, teaming with Fuji in the \"Super Dynamism\" tournament. During the tournament, Morton, Fuji, and Jinsei Shinzaki lost to Mr. Gannosuke, The Gladiator, and Super Leather in a \"no ropes barbed wire street fight\".\n\nMorton debuted in the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania-based promotion Extreme Championship Wrestling at ECW House Party 1997 on January 11, 1997. He teamed with Tommy Rich in a loss to The Gangstas; following the bout, Morton and Rich faced one another in an impromptu match that was won by Rich. He returned to ECW the following month at Crossing the Line Again, losing to Big Stevie Cool.\n\nIn January 1998, both Ricky Morton and Robert Gibson returned to WWF as part of the \"NWA\" angle as the NWA Tag Team Champions. They lost the titles to The Headbangers on February 17 episode of Raw IS War. They competed at WrestleMania XIV for the tag team battle royal won by The Legion of Doom. In the spring they feuded with the NWA Tag Team Champions New Midnight Express Bart Gunn and Bob Holly. This took them to their match at which Gunn and Holly won.\n\nAfter leaving WWF in May 1998, they went to work for Ohio Valley Wrestling and Power Pro Wrestling until 1999. Morton then appeared on Juggalo Championship Wrestling's JCW Vol. 1 in a battle royal.\n\nOn September 7, 2002 he defeated his former rival Bobby Eaton at Ultimate Championship wrestling.\n\nIn 2003, they briefly were part of Vince Russo's S.E.X. group in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). They feuded with America's Most Wanted. Morton lost to Kid Kash on July 30.\n\nSince leaving TNA, Morton wrestles all over the independent circuit in the Southeast and on the East Coast and often wins regional titles. Occasionally, he teams with Gibson as the Rock 'N Roll Express. In 2003/2004, he, along with Robert Gibson, joined the All World Wrestling league/Big Time Wrestling. On March 31, 2007 in Logan, West Virginia, Morton defeated Bobby Eaton in an NWA Legends Match during ASW's Rumble In The Jungle show. On April 27, 2007 in Memphis, Tennessee at the \"PMG Clash of Legends\" event put on by Memphis Wrestling, Morton and Kid Kash captured the MW Southern Tag Team Championship, defeating Too Cool II. On June 30, 2007 The Rock & Roll Express (Ricky and Todd Morton) beat Big and Tasty (Sweet William Valentine and Playboy Mike Trusty) to win the AWA Supreme Tag Team titles. On October 24, 2007 The Rock & Roll Express lost the AWA Supreme Tag Team Titles to Chaos Theory (Khris Kaliber and Karma). On January 4, 2014, Morton defeated Chase Owens to win the NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship. He re-lost the title to Owens on March 7.\n\nIn 2014, Morton opened a wrestling school (The School of Morton) in Chuckey, Tennessee.\n\nIn 2016, The Rock N' Roll Express made a special appearance as part of TNA's weekly televised program \"Impact Wrestling\"'s Total Nonstop Deletion episode, where they took part in the Tag Team Apocalypto match along with other tag teams.\n\nIn 2017, The Rock N' Roll Express were inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame.\n\nThe team made their New Japan Pro Wrestling debut during the Fighting Spirit Unleashed 2019 event, 3 events promoted by NJPW in the United States.\n\nIn 2019, Morton and Gibson wrestled three bouts for New Japan Pro-Wrestling and also appeared in All Elite Wrestling.\n\nThe Rock N Roll Express participated in the 2019 edition of the Jim Crockett Cup, but were defeated by The Briscoe Brothers in the first round. During the NWA television tapings on October 1, 2019, they won the NWA World Tag Team Championship. In January 2020, Morton entered a rivalry with Nick Aldis, leading to a Heavyweight Championship match on \"NWA Powerrr\" which Morton lost.\n\nMorton made his WWE video game debut as DLC for WWE 2K18 along with Robert Gibson.\n\nMorton's father, Paul, was a professional wrestling referee. His cousin Todd Morton also wrestled, occasionally teaming with Morton.\n\nMorton was arrested in October 2005 for failing to pay child support. Morton contended that the outstanding payments were due to the child support amount having been set when he was earning a significant income working for major promotions as a part of The Rock N' Roll Express, and failed to reflect the much lower amount he was able to earn on the independent circuit. At least two benefit shows were put together in February 2006 to raise money towards his legal fees. A United Wrestling Association show in Alcoa, Tennessee on February 2, 2006, raised $2,475 for this cause. On February 15, 2006, Morton was released under the condition that he continue working and making efforts to catch up on the delinquent payments owed to his ex-wife. He returned to the ring the next night for the United Wrestling Association. In September 2007, while camping with his children at a Tennessee park, Morton was rearrested on the same charges. It was estimated he owed a remaining balance of $63,000. A website was established, and raised enough funds to secure his bail.\n\nRicky currently operates School of Morton in Chuckey, Tennessee, where he lends his ring experience to all his students. He also still works the independent circuit and cameos in several films and videos.\n\n"}

He perished in the Neuengamme concentration camp in Northern Germany. Pfeffer was given the pseudonym Albert Dussel in Frank's diary, and remains known as such in many editions and adaptations of the publication.\n\nFritz Pfeffer was born in Gießen, Germany, one of the six children of Ignatz Pfeffer and Jeannette Hirsch-Pfeffer, who lived above their clothing and textiles shop at 6 Marktplatz in Giessen. After completing his education, Pfeffer trained as a dentist and jaw surgeon, obtained a license to practice in 1911 and opened a surgery the following year in Berlin. He served in the German army during the First World War.\n\nIn 1926, Pfeffer married Vera Bythiner (31 March 1904 – 30 September 1942), who was born in Posen in Imperial Germany (now Poznań, Poland). The marriage produced a son, Werner Peter Pfeffer (3 April 1927 – 14 February 1995), but the couple divorced in 1932. Pfeffer was granted custody of the boy and raised him alone until November 1938, when the rising tide of Nazi activity in Germany persuaded him to send his son into the care of his brother, Ernst, in England. Werner Pfeffer emigrated to California in 1945 after his uncle's death and changed his name to Peter Pepper, later establishing a successful office supplies company under that name.\n\nThe tide of antisemitism in Germany, which increased with the rise to power of Adolf Hitler in 1933, forced most of Pfeffer's relatives to flee the country. His mother had died in 1925, and his father remarried and remained in Germany, only to be arrested. He died in Theresienstadt in October 1942. Of Pfeffer's brothers, Julius had died in 1928, Emil emigrated to South Africa in 1937, Ernst moved to England and died in 1944 and Hans left for New Jersey. His sister Minna remained with their father in Germany and died in Nazi custody, and sister Vera escaped to the Netherlands but was arrested in 1942 and died in Auschwitz.\n\nIn 1936, Fritz met a young woman, Charlotte Kaletta (1910–1985), born in Ilmenau, Thuringia in central Germany, who shared his history of a broken marriage. She was estranged from her first husband, Ludwig Löwenstein and had a son, Gustav, both of whom were deported on 26 September 1942 from Berlin to Raasiku, Estonia and were murdered in the Holocaust. The couple moved in together but were prohibited from marrying under the 1935 Nazi Nuremberg Laws, which forbade marriages between Jews and non-Jews.\n\n\"Kristallnacht\" cemented the Pfeffers' decision to leave Berlin; they fled to Amsterdam in December 1938. They were there for two years before the German invasion, and subsequent anti-Jewish laws prohibiting cohabitation of Jews and non-Jews forced them to officially separate and register under different addresses. After establishing a dental practice in Amsterdam's Rivierenbuurt, Pfeffer became acquainted with the Van Pels and Frank families. Miep Gies met Pfeffer at one of the Franks' house parties and became a patient in his dental practice.\n\nIn the autumn of 1942, Pfeffer decided to go into hiding and asked Miep Gies about some suitable addresses. She consulted Otto Frank, whose family Gies had been hiding in secret rooms in the Franks' office building along with the Van Pels family. Frank agreed to accommodate Pfeffer, and he was taken into the hiding place on 16 November. Pfeffer's medical degree was valuable to the two families, as they could not contact a doctor while in hiding.\n\nMargot Frank moved into a room with her parents to allow Pfeffer to share a small room with Anne, beginning what would become a torturous relationship for both. It has been suggested by at least one biographer that Anne's extreme discomfort at sharing her room with a middle-aged man while she was going through puberty may have been at the root of her problems with Pfeffer, but the pressures of being in hiding and the generational differences of their forty-year age gap undoubtedly exacerbated the differences in their natures. Pfeffer felt his age gave him seniority over Anne and wrote off her writing activities as unimportant compared to his own studies. His observance of orthodox Judaism clashed with her liberal views. Her energy and capriciousness grated on his nerves, while his pedantry and rigidity frustrated her. Anne's irritations and growing dislike of Pfeffer led to complaints and derisory descriptions of him in her diary, against which his son Werner and wife Charlotte defended him once the book was published. The relationship of Anne and Fritz was the toughest of all.\n\nPfeffer left a farewell note to his wife and they stayed in touch through Gies, who met her on a weekly basis to exchange their letters and take provisions from her. His letters never disclosed the location of his hiding place and Gies never revealed it, but on 4 August 1944, Pfeffer and the seven other occupants of the hiding place were arrested for deportation to Nazi concentration camps.\n\nWith the rest of the group and two of their protectors, Johannes Kleiman and Victor Kugler, Pfeffer was taken to the Nazi headquarters in Amsterdam-South, then to a prison for three days before being transported to Westerbork on 8 August. Pfeffer was taken to the Punishment Barracks with the others, where he undertook hard labour, until he was selected for deportation to Auschwitz on 3 September. He was separated from the others on arrival on 6 September and sent to the men's barracks, where he was reunited with Otto Frank. On 29 October, he was transferred with 59 other medics to Sachsenhausen and from there to Neuengamme on an unknown date. In the infirmary there, Pfeffer died of enterocolitis at age 55 on 20 December 1944, according to the camp's records.\n\nAccording to research done by Melissa Müller for her book \"\", Charlotte Pfeffer married Fritz Pfeffer posthumously in 1950, with retrospective effect to 31 May 1937. She had become estranged from his son Werner, but both were united in their defense of Pfeffer after the publication of Anne Frank's diary in 1947, feeling that Frank's portrait of him—and of the pseudonym she had chosen for him, Mr. Dussel (German for \"nitwit\")—was injurious to his memory. Otto Frank tried to placate them by reminding them of his daughter's youth and of her unflattering portraits of some of the other people in hiding. The subsequent exaggerations of this portrait in the 1955 play and 1959 film (in which Pfeffer was played by comic actor Ed Wynn) led Charlotte Pfeffer to contact screenwriters Albert Hackett and his wife Frances Goodrich to complain that they were libeling her deceased husband, who was depicted as ignorant about Jewish traditions. The Hacketts replied that their script did not mirror reality and that to inform a non-Jewish audience of the significance of Judaic ceremonies, one character had to be ignorant of them. Pfeffer pointed out that her husband was a devout Jew and master of Hebrew, but the character of \"Mr. Dussel\" remained unchanged.\n\nEmbittered by the unrepresentative portrait, Charlotte Pfeffer severed her links with Otto Frank and Miep Gies as Anne Frank's fame grew in the decades after the war, and refused interview requests.\n\nWerner Pfeffer remained in touch with Otto Frank and had the opportunity to meet Gies shortly before dying of cancer in 1995, to thank her for her attempt to save his father's life. The meeting was recorded for the documentary film \"Anne Frank Remembered\".\n\nA collection of letters written by Fritz Pfeffer to his wife and a box of photographs of him were rescued, with some of Charlotte Pfeffer's possessions, from an Amsterdam flea market after her death in 1985.\n\nEd Wynn's portrayal of Pfeffer (as Dussel) in George Stevens' film \"The Diary of Anne Frank\" (1959) earned him a nomination for an Academy Award as Best Supporting Actor.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1846986", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1846986", "title": "OMA DRM", "text": "OMA DRM\n\nOMA DRM is a digital rights management (DRM) system invented by the Open Mobile Alliance, whose members represent mobile phone manufacturers (e.g. Nokia, LG, Motorola, Samsung, Sony-Ericsson, BenQ-Siemens), mobile system manufacturers (e.g. Ericsson, Siemens, Openwave), mobile phone network operators (e.g. Vodafone, O2, Cingular, Deutsche Telekom, Orange), and information technology companies (e.g. Microsoft, IBM, Sun). DRM provides a way for content creators to set enforced limits on the use and duplication of their content by customers. The system is implemented on many recent phones. To date, two versions of OMA DRM have been released: OMA DRM 1.0 and OMA DRM 2.0.\n\nIn order to ensure that all manufacturers' implementations of OMA DRM can work with each other, the Open Mobile Alliance provides specifications and test tools for OMA DRM.\n\nThe OMA DRM group is chaired by Sergey Seleznev (Samsung Electronics).\n\nOMA DRM version 1.0 was first drafted in November 2002, and approved in June 2004. It provides basic Digital Rights Management, without strong protection. The standard specifies three main methods: Forward Lock, Combined Delivery (combined rights object / media object), and Separate Delivery (separated rights object + encrypted media object). Forward Lock prevents the user from forwarding content such as ringtones and wallpapers on their phone.\n\nThe content can be distributed using HTTP or MMS.\n\nVersion 2.0 was drafted in July 2004 and approved in March 2006. The primary new feature is the extension of DRM 1.0's Separate Delivery mechanism.\n\nEach participating device in OMA DRM 2.0 has an individual DRM Public key infrastructure (PKI) certificate, with a public key and the corresponding private key. Each Rights Object (RO) is individually protected for one receiving device by encrypting it with the device public key. The RO in turn contains the key that is used to decrypt the media object. Delivery of Rights Objects requires a registration with the Rights Issuer (the entity distributing Rights Objects). During this registration, the device certificate is usually validated against a device blacklist by means of an Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) verification. Thus, devices known to be hacked can be excluded once they try to register with an Rights Issuer in order to receive new Rights Objects so they can access the content.\n\nStarted in September 2005 and approved in March 2009, the goal of the Secure Removable Media (SRM) Work Item is to define the protection and consumption of digital content and associated usage rights on an SRM. An SRM is a removable medium that implements means to protect against unauthorized access to its internal data, such as a secure memory card or smart card. The SRM Work Item does not stand alone; it extends the existing OMA DRM 2.0 specifications. While OMA DRM 2.0 defines a general framework for downloading Rights to devices and sharing Rights in a domain, the SRM Work Item defines mechanisms and protocols for the SRM. It extends OMA DRM version 2.0 or 2.1, allowing users to move Rights between devices and SRMs, and to consume Rights stored in SRMs without generating and managing complex groups of devices in a domain.\n\nStarted in December 2008 and approved in June 2011, SRM 1.1 is an extension of SRM 1.0 introducing such functions as content license move between two SRMs, direct license provisioning to SRM and support for OMA Broadcasting (OMA BCAST) tokens. Latter allows to turn SRM into a secure electronic wallet capable to store credits that are used to subscribe to mobile broadcast and multicast services.\n\nOMA SCE 1.0 started in September 2005 and was approved in December 2008 as a Candidate enabler. The goal of Secure Content Exchange (SCE) is to extend OMA DRM v2.0, enabling seamless sharing of purchased content between multiple devices, including all the devices owned by a subscriber (phone, PC, home electronics system, car audio system, etc.) and the temporary sharing of content on any device that is in close proximity to the subscriber’s device (e.g., a television set at a friend’s house or in a hotel room while the user is travelling). Because there will be no single DRM system deployed across all these different devices, the SCE also enhances the interoperability between OMA and non-OMA DRM systems, by defining an Import function for OMA DRM.\n\nOMA DRM 1.0 has been implemented in over 550 models of mobile phone. Many mobile operators use OMA DRM for their content services. The first OMA DRM 2.0 implementations were released in early 2005; implementations were installed on mobile phones by the end of 2005. Software implementations for personal computer and PDA clients are also available.\n\nMost of the ringtones pre-installed on mobile phones have implemented DRM. Many commercial ringtone vendors who are not part of any mobile phone carrier do not bother with any form of DRM, perhaps because the number of ringtone vendors is huge, and people will choose to download unprotected ringtones if they can get them. The record industry does not mandate that DRM be implemented on ringtones, unlike most digital music stores. Many ringtones are reverse-engineered by the ringtone provider themselves, so it is their choice whether to implement the DRM.\n\nSince 2006, OMA has been working on DRM 2.0.1 and 2.1, and on new features such as SRM (Secure Removable Media) and SCE (Secure Content Exchange).\n\nBroadcast services requirements being completely different from video-on-demand, the OMA BCAST Smartcard profile has been recommended by all the industries to be the unified standard used for Mobile TV broadcast.\n\nCommercial OMA DRM providers include:\n\nAn open source solution for OMA DRM 2.0 is also available.\n\nThe OMA DRM specification uses a profile of the Open Digital Rights Language for expressing its licenses.\n\nOn Nokia Series 40 phones, an installed file with DRM will have its \"Send\" option greyed out in its options menu. If the user attempts to send such a file via MMS, a message stating \"The file is copyright protected\" will appear. A Bluetooth file transfer will fail if the user tries to extract the file using Bluetooth, yet the file will still appear as present, and will still be deletable via Bluetooth.\n\nHowever, if the file (such as a music track) is received with separate delivery—the key is sent separately from the actual download of the file, and the file contains a license URL—it is possible to forward the file to other devices. Once the file is activated on the new device, it will prompt the user to access the URL embedded in the file, and give the user the option to acquire the key.\n\nSome vendors implement broad DRM systems, restricting consumer rights beyond the scope documented by the OMA DRM standards. For example, some Nokia Symbian-based devices will completely refuse to send \"all\" files of certain types over Bluetooth. For these phones, this blocks sending of MIDI files, Java Applets, and Symbian programs regardless of whether or not they are protected by DRM. Such phones will refuse any attempts to send such files with the message \"Unable to send protected objects\" or a similar error. This prevents sending such content, even when the content license explicitly allows or even depends on redistribution.\n\n"}

{"id": "1847001", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1847001", "title": "François René Mallarmé", "text": "François René Mallarmé\n\nFrançois-René-Auguste Mallarmé (25 February 1755 – 25 July 1835) was a French statesman of the French Revolution and a supporter of Napoleon Bonaparte and the French Empire. His career is of particular interest because he was among political figures such as Joseph Fouché who at first aggressively supported the Terror, only to betray its leaders (including Maximilien Robespierre) and support the various conservative reactionary régimes that followed. His was a chevalier de l'Empire from 22 November 1808 and a baron de l'Empire from 31 January 1810.\n\nBorn in Nancy, Lorraine, the son of a lawyer, he was brought up in his father's profession. During the first phase of the French Revolution under the National Assembly he was appointed (1790) procureur-syndic of the district of Pont-à-Mousson in his home department of Meurthe.\n\nElected (31 August 1791) as a representative of the Département of Meurthe to the Legislative Assembly (1791–1792), and then again elected (4 September 1792) to the National Convention (1792–1795) as a deputy for Meurthe. For Convention he was appointed a member of the committee for finances, and briefly was appointed to the Committee of Public Safety (27 June 1793 – 10 July 1793) by resolution of the National Convention to present his plan for food procurement, but did not join the committee's sessions.\n\nMallarmé attached himself to the Montagnard faction and voted for the death sentence in the trial of Louis XVI. He served as President of the National Convention (30 May 1793 – 13 June 1793) and presided over the debates about proscription of the Girondin faction, rivals of the Montagnards, but vacated the chair at vital moments. Mallarmé did not chair the evening meeting of 1 June 1793 (Henri Grégoire presided) and chaired only the first part of the session of 2 June 1793, when Marie-Jean Hérault de Séchelles replaced him in chair until the end of the session.\n\nHe served on several missions, including to the Departments of Meurthe, Vosges and Haute-Saône (23 August 1793 – 3 November 1793) which was in support of the levée en masse, to the army of the Rhine (13 September 1793 - 3 November 1793), and again over winter 1793-1794 to establish revolutionary government in Meuse and Moselle. While on the latter mission he earned a notorious reputation for senseless arrests and executions. The most heinous example is when he ordered the execution of the sentence of death decreed by the Revolutionary Tribunal on some young girls at Verdun who had offered flowers to the Prussian soldiers when they entered the town. He thus joined the ranks of Tallien, Fréron, and Fouché as perpetrators of the worst excesses of Terror, and like them found his position growing tenuous. He secured his survival when he spoke against Maximilien Robespierre in the course of the Thermidorian coup (27 July 1794).\n\nIn the reactionary political order that followed the demise of Robespierre, Mallarmé was sent on mission to Haute-Garonne and Gers (21 August 1794 - 23 October 1794, 6 November 1794 - 15 January 1795). It was an entirely different part of France than he had been involved with heretofore, and similarly, he pursued a very different set of goals, closing down the terrorist Jacobin clubs and setting free prisoners who had been locked away during the Terror as enemies of the state. Alas, his own terrorist activities caught up with him and he was denounced and arrested (1 June 1795), but he was released soon after the amnesty of 26 October 1795.\n\nIn 1796 he was appointed by the Directory commissioner for the organization of the \"départements\" of Dyle and Mont-Tonnerre. Under the Empire, Mallarmé was collector of the \"droits réunis\" (sales taxes) at Nancy, and lost his money in 1814 in raising the \"levée\" of volunteers.\n\nAppointed \"sous-préfet\" of Avesnes during the Hundred Days, he was imprisoned by the Prussian authorities in revenge for the death of the maidens of Verdun, and held for six months in Wesel. He took refuge in Brussels and then Mechelen (with the Cellite monks), and remained in exile during the Bourbon Restoration. He died in Mechelen.\n\n"}

The Source is now owned by BCE Inc., which purchased the assets of InterTAN from its parent, American retailer Circuit City, in 2009. The Source is a unit of 4458729 Canada Inc. and is based in Barrie, Ontario.\n\nThe Source began as the Canadian branch of Radio Shack (later \"RadioShack\"). The chain was originally owned by Radio Shack's American parent company Tandy Corporation, but was spun off in June 1986, along with the rest of Tandy's international operations, as InterTAN. A licensing agreement with what became RadioShack Corporation allowed InterTAN to continue to use the chain's name and logo. InterTAN abandoned its non-profitable West German stores in 1987, left Belgium and France in 1993, sold its British stores to Carphone Warehouse in 1999 and sold its Australian stores to Woolworth subsidiary Dick Smith Electronics in 2002, leaving just the Canadian Radio Shack, Battery Plus, and Rogers Plus stores.\n\nIn May 2004, InterTAN was acquired by Circuit City. One week after the acquisition was completed, RadioShack Corporation filed a lawsuit in the 352nd Judicial District Court in Tarrant County, Texas, to end the licensing agreement. RadioShack Corporation claimed that InterTAN had breached the terms of their agreement. On March 24, 2005, the district court judge ruled in favour of RadioShack and cancelled the agreement. The ruling prohibited InterTAN from using the brand name on its stores or in any of its products, packaging, and advertising after June 30, 2005.\n\nOn April 26, 2005, Circuit City announced that the stores would be renamed \"The Source by Circuit City\" (\"La Source par Circuit City\" in Quebec). The rebranding process was completed in the majority of the chain's Canadian stores by July 1, 2005. The chain also introduced new house brands, including Nexxtech and Vital, in place of RadioShack store brands.\n\nIn February 2007, The Source announced it would close down 62 low volume stores across Canada. On March 30, 2007, Circuit City announced to its shareholders that it was seeking options including selling off the InterTAN/The Source subsidiary to cut losses. On November 10, 2008, InterTAN sought protection from its creditors, after Circuit City filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\n\nCircuit City announced on January 16, 2009, that its namesake U.S. stores would be liquidated. The Source was not affected by the announcement, and a process followed to sell the Canadian operations as a growing concern.\n\nOn March 2, 2009, Canadian telecommunications firm Bell Canada announced it would acquire The Source and continue to operate it as an independent division. The acquisition was completed July 1 for the final purchase price of $135 million US, following which the chain removed the \"by Circuit City\" from its name. Prior to January 2010, the stores sold mobile phone services from Bell's main competitor, Rogers Wireless; at that point, the chain began to exclusively market Bell-owned wireless (including value brand Virgin Mobile), television, and internet services.\n\nThe Source continues to sell a full array of consumer electronics products.\n\nThe Source stocks a wide array of products. Most of the products are consumer electronics, including: cellular phones, computers, computer accessories, televisions, DVD players, Blu-ray players, home theatre systems, clock radios, traditional telephones, toys, SiriusXM satellite radios, console gaming equipment, cables (such as HDMI, DVI, component, composite/RCA, VGA, S-Video, USB, serial, etc.), Bell devices, Virgin Mobile devices, Bell TV, and MP3 players, as well as a large selection of headphones including models by Sony and Skullcandy.\n\nThe Source also carries house brand products under brands such as Bright, Headrush, Kapsule, Nexxtech, Vital and Xtreme Gaming.\n\n"}
{"id": "1847013", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1847013", "title": "Hoarding (animal behavior)", "text": "Hoarding (animal behavior)\n\nHoarding or caching in animal behavior is the storage of food in locations hidden from the sight of both conspecifics (animals of the same or closely related species) and members of other species. Most commonly, the function of hoarding or caching is to store food in times of surplus for times when food is less plentiful. However, there is evidence that some amount of caching or hoarding is done in order to ripen the food, called ripening caching. The term hoarding is most typically used for rodents, whereas caching is more commonly used in reference to birds, but the behaviors in both animal groups are quite similar.\n\nHoarding is done either on a long-term basis – cached on a seasonal cycle, with food to be consumed months down the line – or on a short term basis, in which case the food will be consumed over a period of one or several days.\n\nSome common animals that cache their food are rodents such as hamsters and squirrels, and many different bird species, such as rooks and woodpeckers. The western scrub jay is noted for its particular skill at caching. There are two types of caching behavior: larder-hoarding, where a species creates a few large caches which it often defends, and scatter-hoarding, where a species will create multiple caches, often with each individual food item stored in a unique place. Both types of caching have their advantage.\n\nCaching behavior is typically a way to save excess edible food for later consumption - either soon to be eaten food, such as when a jaguar hangs a partially eaten prey in a tree to be eaten within a few days, or long term where the food is hidden and retrieved many months later. Caching is a common adaptation to seasonal changes in food availability. In regions where winters are harsh, food availability typically becomes low, and caching food during the times of high food availability in the warmer months provides a significant survival advantage. This phenomenon is referenced in the fable The Ant and the Grasshopper.\n\nHowever, in ripening caching behavior, animals collect and cache food which is immediately inedible but will become \"ripe\" and edible after a short while. For instance, tayras (a Central American weasel) have been observed to harvest whole green plantains, hide them, and then come back to eat them after they have ripened. Leafcutter ants harvest pieces of inedible leaves and then cache them in underground chambers to ripen with a fungus which is the main food for the colony. Contrary to popular belief, there is no scientific evidence that Crocodillians such as the American Alligator cache large prey underwater to consume later. \n\nScatter hoarding is the formation of a large number of small hoards. This behavior is present in both birds (especially the Canada jay) and small mammals, mainly squirrels and other rodents, such as the eastern gray squirrel, fox squirrel, and wood mouse. Specifically, those who do not migrate to warmer climates or hibernate for winter are most likely to scatter hoard. This behavior plays an important part in seed dispersal, as those seeds that are left uneaten will have a chance to germinate, thus enabling plants to spread their populations effectively.\n\nCache spacing is the primary technique that scatter hoarders use to protect food from pilferers. By spreading the food supply around geographically, hoarders discourage competitors who happen upon a cache from conducting area-restricted searching for more of the supply. Despite cache spacing, however, hoarders are still unable to completely eliminate the threat of pilferage. However, having multiple cache sites is costly because it requires a good memory. Scatter-hoarders generally have a large hippocampus.\n\nIn larder hoarding, the hoard is large and is found in a single place termed a larder, which usually also serves as the nest where the animal lives. Hamsters are famous larder hoarders. Indeed, the German verb \"hamstern\" (to hoard) is derived from the noun \"Hamster\" which refers to the rodent; similar verbs are found in various related languages (Dutch \"hamsteren\", and Swedish \"hamstra\"). Other languages also draw a clear connection between hamsters and hoarding: Polish \"chomikować\", from \"chomik\" – hamster; Hebrew \"hamster\"; \"oger\" (אוגר) comes from \"to hoard\"; \"le'egor\" (לאגור). A disadvantage of larder hoarding is that if a cache is raided, this is far more problematic for the animal than if it were a scatter hoarder. While the hoard is much easier to remember the location of, these larger hoards must also be more staunchly defended.\n\nMost species are particularly wary of onlooking individuals during caching and ensure that the cache locations are secret. Not all caches are concealed however, for example shrikes store prey items on thorns on branches in the open.\n\nAlthough a small handful of species share food stores, food hoarding is a solo endeavor for most species, including almost all rodents and birds. For example, a number of jays live in large family groups, but they don't demonstrate sharing of cached food. Rather, they hoard their food supply selfishly, caching and retrieving the supply in secret.\n\nThere are only two species in which kin selection has resulted in a shared food store, i.e. beavers (\"Castor canadensis\") and acorn woodpeckers (\"Melanerpes formicivorous\"); the former live in family groups and construct winter larders of submerged branches, while the latter are unusual in that they construct a conspicuous communal larder.\n\nPilferage occurs when one animal takes food from another animal's larder.\nSome species experience high levels of cache pilferage, up to 30% of the supply per day. Models of scatter hoarding suggested the value of cached food is equal to the hoarders ability to retrieve it.\n\nIt has been observed that members of certain species, such as rodents and chickadees, act as both hoarder and pilferer. In other words, pilfering can be reciprocal and, thus, tolerable. Although this kind of food caching system seems cooperative, it has been suggested that it is actually driven by the selfish interests of the individual.\n\nAnimals recache the food that they've pilfered from other animal's caches.\nFor example, 75% percent of mildly radioactive (thus traceable) Jeffrey pine seeds cached by yellow pine chipmunks were found in two cache sites, 29% of the seeds were found in three sites, 9.4% were found in four sites and 1.3% were found in five sites over a 3-month period. These results, and those from other studies, demonstrate the dynamic nature of the food supplies of scatter hoarding animals.\n\nGroup-foraging common ravens, (\"Corvus corax\"), scatter hoard their food and also raid the caches made by others. Cachers withdraw from conspecifics when hiding their food and most often place their caches behind structures, obstructing the view of potential observers. Raiders watch inconspicuously and keep at a distance to cachers close to their cache sites. In response to the presence of potential raiders or because of their initial movements towards caches, the cachers frequently interrupt caching, change cache sites, or recover their food items. These behaviors suggest that ravens are capable of withholding information about their intentions, which may qualify as tactical deception.\n\nSimilarly, Eurasian jays (\"Garrulus glandarius\") when being watched by another jay, prefer to cache food behind an opaque barrier rather than a transparent barrier, suggesting they may opt to cache in out-of-view locations to reduce the likelihood of other jays pilfering their caches.\n\n\nJenkins, Stewart H. and Breck, Stewart W.

Generally, two or more waves are combined and as the phase difference between them varies, the power or intensity (probability or population in quantum mechanics) of the resulting wave oscillates, forming an interference pattern. The pattern may be visible all at once because the phase difference varies as a function of space, as in a 2-slit experiment. Alternately, the phase difference may be manually controlled by the operator, for example by adjusting a vernier knob in an interferometer. The ratio of the size or amplitude of these oscillations to the sum of the powers of the individual waves is defined as the visibility.\n\nThe interferometric visibility gives a practical way to measure the coherence of two waves (or one wave with itself). A theoretical definition of the coherence is given by the degree of coherence, using the notion of correlation.\n\nIn linear optical interferometers (like the Mach–Zehnder interferometer, Michelson interferometer, and Sagnac interferometer), interference manifests itself as intensity oscillations over time or space, also called \"fringes\". Under these circumstances, the interferometric visibility is also known as the \"Michelson visibility\" or the \"fringe visibility.\" For this type of interference, the sum of the intensities (powers) of the two interfering waves equals the average intensity over a given time or space domain. The visibility is written as:\n\nin terms of the amplitude envelope of the oscillating intensity and the average intensity:\n\nSo it can be rewritten as:\n\nwhere \"I\" is the maximum intensity of the oscillations and \"I\" the minimum intensity of the oscillations. If the two optical fields are ideally monochromatic (consist of only single wavelength) point sources of the same polarization, then the predicted visibility will be\n\nwhere formula_6 and formula_7 indicate the intensity of the respective wave. Any dissimilarity between the optical fields will decrease the visibility from the ideal. In this sense, the visibility is a measure of the coherence between two optical fields. A theoretical definition for this is given by the degree of coherence. This definition of interference directly applies to the interference of water waves and electric signals.\n\nSince the Schrödinger equation is a wave equation and all objects can be considered waves in quantum mechanics, interference is ubiquitous. Some examples: Bose–Einstein condensates can exhibit interference fringes. Atomic populations show interference in a Ramsey interferometer. Photons, atoms, electrons, neutrons, and molecules have exhibited interference in double-slit interferometers.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1847022", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1847022", "title": "Electric vehicle conversion", "text": "Electric vehicle conversion\n\nIn automobile engineering, electric vehicle conversion is the replacement of a car's combustion engine and connected components with an electric motor and batteries, to create an all-electric vehicle. Another option is to replace a large combustion engine with an electric motor and a small combustion engine, creating a hybrid electric vehicle or a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle.\n\nThe general trend appears to be that ground vehicles will \"go electric,\" and automakers have responded to public demand by producing both hybrid electric vehicles which get gasoline, and electric vehicles which get similar or better mileage by mpg equivalent efficiency rating.\n\nIn general, commercially-manufactured electric vehicles are inhibited by the limited range per charge of batteries (up to ), battery charge times that are slower than gasoline filling times, apparent greater initial cost over combustion engines, and potentially high service costs for used or worn-out batteries. Electric conversions are often inhibited by either the difficult labor and specialized knowledge involved in a do-it-yourself (DIY) conversion, or the expense of a purchased conversion service with conversion components, often costing . There is a small but steadily growing DIY community for electric conversions.\n\n\nHobbyists often build their own EVs by converting existing production cars to run solely on electricity. There is a cottage industry supporting the conversion and construction of BEVs by hobbyists. Universities such as the University of California, Irvine even build their own custom electric or hybrid-electric cars from scratch.\n\nShort-range battery electric vehicles can offer the hobbyist comfort, utility, and quickness, sacrificing only range. Short-range EVs may be built using high-performance lead–acid batteries, using about half the mass needed for a range. The result is a vehicle with about a range, which, when designed with appropriate weight distribution (40/60 front to rear), does not require power steering, offers exceptional acceleration in the lower end of its operating range, and is freeway capable and legal. But their EVs are expensive due to the higher cost for these higher-performance batteries. By including a manual transmission, short-range EVs can obtain both better performance and greater efficiency than the single-speed EVs developed by major manufacturers. Unlike the converted golf carts used for neighborhood electric vehicles, short-range EVs may be operated on typical suburban throughways (where speed limits are typical) and can keep up with traffic typical on such roads and the short \"slow-lane\" on-and-off segments of freeways common in suburban areas.\n\nFaced with chronic fuel shortage on the Gaza Strip, Palestinian electrical engineer Waseem Othman al-Khozendar invented in 2008 a way to convert his car to run on 32 electric batteries. According to al-Khozendar, the batteries can be charged with worth of electricity to drive from . After a 7-hour charge, the car should also be able to run up to a speed of .\n\nIn 2008, several Chinese manufacturers began marketing lithium iron phosphate () batteries directly to hobbyists and vehicle conversion shops. These batteries offered much better power-to-weight ratios allowing vehicle conversions to typically achieve per charge. Prices gradually declined to approximately per kW·h by mid-2009. As the cells feature life ratings of 3,000 cycles, compared to typical lead acid battery ratings of 300 cycles, the life expectancy of cells is around 10 years. cells require more expensive battery management and charging systems than lead acid batteries.\n\nOn-board solar cells can be used to power an electric vehicle.\nThe small power generated by solar cells mounted on a vehicle means that the other components in the system must be special to compensate for this.\n\nMost conversions in North America are performed by hobbyists who typically will convert a well used vehicle with a non-functioning engine, since such defective vehicles can be quite inexpensive to purchase. Other hobbyists with larger budgets may prefer to convert a later model vehicle, or a vehicle of a particular type. In some cases, the vehicle itself may be built by the converter, or assembled from a kit car.\n\nA two-stage vehicle is a vehicle that has been built by two separate manufacturers. The result is a standard, complete vehicle. In this process, vehicles may be converted by a manufacturer (as was done by Ford Motor Company to create the Ford Ranger EV). Alternatively, in a process known as \"third-party (power)trainization\", an independent converter will purchase new vehicle gliders (vehicles without a motor or related equipment) and then perform the conversion, to offer a two-stage vehicle.\n\nIn some countries, the user can choose to buy a converted vehicle of any model in the automaker dealerships only paying the cost of the batteries and motor, with no installation costs (it is called pre-conversion or previous conversion).\n\nThe electric vehicle conversion industry has grown to include conversion car garages, aftermarket kits and vehicle components.\n\nAn electric bicycle is a conventional bicycle that has been fitted with an electric motor. Most often electric bicycles or \"e-bikes\" are powered by rechargeable batteries however some experimental electric bicycles run directly on or recharge their batteries via solar panels, fuel cells, gas generators or other alternative energy sources. Using an on-board generator may impact the legal jurisdictional definition of an electric bicycle. A few types of electric bicycles are able to re-capture a small amount of energy from braking and can re-charge the batteries while braking or traveling down hills (regenerative braking).\n\nSome electric bikes have features where the motor can move the bicycle by itself (immediate start) if the rider chooses not to pedal with a button or throttle controller, while others require the rider to pedal at all times (pedal assist). This latter type may in some jurisdictions allow the vehicle to be used on bicycle trails that otherwise prohibit motorized vehicles of any kind (See motorized bicycle).\n\nMany battery technologies are available for powering electric bikes. The most common and least expensive battery technology is sealed lead acid but LiFePO is fast becoming the battery of choice for the e-bike.\n\nConverting one's bike to electric with a conversion kit is an easy and affordable solution for most people interested in learning more about electric vehicle conversion.\n\nThe ease of registration will vary by state. Some states require safety inspections, usually to ensure body integrity in areas subject to severe corrosion from winter road de-icing materials. In any case, for general registration all functional safety equipment should be operating – turn signals, brake lights, headlights, horn, etc. The windshield should have no running cracks (small stone chips and \"stars\" may be acceptable if not in the driver's principal line of vision). If the vehicle has been reconstructed from a salvage vehicle (a vehicle whose registration has been forfeited) inspection may be more severe to ensure compliance and the legitimacy of sources of salvage components by presentation of proper purchase receipts.\n\nRegistration procedures will vary by state and will usually be more difficult in states with strict emissions requirements.\n\nOn the other hand, changing the registration allows a conversion to qualify for tax incentives available in some states, such as Oregon, for either the vehicle, the charging system, or both.\n\nRegistration of a converted existing, or newly self-constructed electric vehicle in California is no longer difficult.\n\nThis falls into two categories; First, if the vehicle is built from new frame components and possibly some salvage parts, (\"i.e.\", it has never been a previously titled motorcar previously, but it has brakes or axles that were obtained used/rebuilt.) In California if you \"create\" a car from scratch and want to register and title it with DMV, you need to go through the \"Specially Constructed Vehicle Emission Control Program\" or SPCNS for short, this is also called California \"SB100\" program. Or Second, a previously registered vehicle converted to electric propulsion.\n\nSPCNC: In the past, the process of registering an SPCNS vehicle required meeting with an outside referee at a community college or one of the states mobile referee stations to verify the vehicle. The current process happens at the DMV with the inspection being done by A DMV inspector. The inspector will need to be able to see the motor and batteries and verify that there in no internal combustion engine. The vehicle will still need a brake and light inspection By an outside inspector to verify its compliance with other vehicle codes.\n\nCurrently Registered Vehicles: If you are converting an existing vehicle and it is older than 1975, you may opt to not bother to get the vehicle converted to the \"E\" code unless you are looking for the Diamond Lane stickers, since these vehicles don't require a smog inspection. For vehicles newer than 1975 you will need to go the DMV and have the vehicle inspected as a conversion. The batteries and motor will have to be exposed so the inspector can see them and verify that there is no internal combustion engine.\n\nThe next step requires the clerk at the local California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) office to call the Sacramento office. Only the Sacramento office can make this entry into the computer system. If the local clerk tries, the system will default to the \"Q\" code for hybrid. (These procedures are in place to inhibit fraudulent registration of ICE vehicles as Electric in order to avoid smog inspections.) A hybrid is not exempt from smog inspection. Before you leave the DMV make sure your printout has the proper \"E\" code or you will have to go back to do it again.\n\nThere is weight fee of $87 for vehicles under or $266 for vehicles from . This is in addition to any regular registration fees.\n\nIn Spain, the conversion (called transformation) is regulated by \"Real Decreto 866/2010, de 2 de julio, por el que se regula la tramitación de las reformas de vehículos\".\n\n"}

The aim of the Tollbooth was to offer dynamic and challenging installation and video art in an outdoor urban setting. Tollbooth Gallery was created and curated by Jared Pappas-Kelley and Michael Lent.\nFor each exhibition an artist or artist team was commissioned and tasked with the realization of their project at the site, while taking advantage of the freestanding concrete structure. Art critic Regina Hackett characterized the project as “mind-expanding art packed into cramped quarters” and described the approach as: “Art that is eager to wrestle with reality.” Hackett noted: “What it lacks in space, it achieves in time,” and “on top of that, it's fabulous.”\n\nThe Tollbooth commissioned eight exhibitions per year, focusing on varied approaches and engagement with the site and viewer, with an emphasis on video art, time-based work, photography, printmaking, and installation art. The gallery’s stated mission was to bring video and gallery work outside of the traditional museum setting, challenging artists and audience to approach site in different ways. Participant and curator Fionn Meade described the Tollbooth site as a “challenging space to work with but in a good way,” commenting that “the limitations of a format make you be more decisive.” This decisive approach to exhibiting contemporary art allowed the Tollbooth Gallery to program work that might be considered “edgier,” which was furthered by the temporary nature of the commissions. As the journal Public Art Review noted, the project benefited from the “dynamics” of its temporary exhibitions as they allowed for experimentation and “delivered on a short timeline.”\nOver the years the Tollbooth Gallery was selected by Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles to be included as part of their curriculum, presented as part of the panel Conduit to Contemporary Art at Americans for the Arts National Conference, and Make Your Own: Art in and out of Cologne at Henry Art Gallery.

As the reservation covers 972.517 sq mi (2,518.806 km²) of land and 337.392 sq mi (873.841 km²) of water, about one-fourth of its territory is covered by lakes. The largest lakes on the reservation are Leech Lake, Lake Winnibigoshish, and Cass Lake. The band uses 40 lakes for the production of wild rice, and the community produces more rice than any other reservation in the state. The reservation is the second-largest in Minnesota (after the White Earth Indian Reservation) in terms of land area, and the largest in terms of total area.\n\nThe core areas of the reservation were established by the 1855 treaty of Washington, which formed three smaller reservations for the Pillager Band of Chippewa Indians, and modified several times thereafter. Under the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, the present \"Greater\" Leech Lake Indian Reservation was formed from the merger of the Leech Lake, Cass Lake, and Lake Winnibigoshish reservations of the Pillager Band, the Chippewa Indian Reservation of the Lake Superior Band, and the White Oak Point reservation of the Mississippi Band. A minimal percentage of reservation land is owned by citizens of the Band; additionally, most of the reservation land is now within the Chippewa National Forest, making settlement expansion extremely difficult.\n\nThe reservation consists of eleven villages; two additional communities have a substantial number of Leech Lake Band members. Nearly all Leech Lake communities are located in or near the woods of the Chippewa National Forest. The largest community is Cass Lake, situated on the southwestern shores of the eponymous lake. The next largest settlements are Ball Club, Onigum, Inger, and Bena. In some communities, housing is located along only one road, with each side lined with homes.\n\n\n"}

The band had 9,426 enrolled tribal members as of March 2014. The band's land base is the Leech Lake Indian Reservation, which includes eleven communities aggregated into three districts, as defined in the tribal constitution,\n\nAs a member of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, which also includes the bands of Bois Forte, Fond du Lac, Grand Portage, Mille Lacs, and White Earth, the Leech Lake Band is governed by a tribal constitution, written following the 1934 Indian Reorganization Act. The tribe's constitution established a corporate system of governance with \"reservation business committees,\" also referred to as \"Reservation Tribal Councils\", as the governmental body. The committees are composed of a chairperson, a secretary-treasurer, and three district representatives. The representatives are elected for four-year terms. Their elections are staggered.\n\nThe current Tribal Council is as follows (with the year of next election for the position in parentheses):\n\nThe Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe operates three casinos: Cedar Lakes Casino and Hotel in Cass Lake on the Leech Lake Reservation; Northern Lights in Walker; and White Oak in Deer River. The Band's Business Development Division also operates the Che-We-Ka-E-Gon Complex in Cass Lake, which consists of a convenience store and gas station, a gift shop, and an office supply store. Additionally, the Band operates the Northern Lights Express, a gas station near the Northern Lights Casino. The Palace Casino and Hotel is set to replaced by the new Cedar Lakes Casino Hotel, which is scheduled to open on August 8, 2019 in Cass Lake, MN.\n\nIn addition to economic initiatives, the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe has founded two major educational initiatives: the Bug-O-Nay-Ge-Shig School, an open enrollment K-12 school, and Leech Lake Tribal College, which grants associate degrees.\n\nLike the Red Lake and White Earth Bands, the Leech Lake Band is known for its tradition of singing hymns in the Ojibwe language.\n\n\n"}

The others are the Kigali Memorial Centre, Ntarama Memorial Centre and others at Nyamata, Bisesero and Nyarubuye.\n\nThis was the site of a during the 1994 Rwandan genocide. When the killings started, Tutsis in the region tried to hide at a local church. However, the bishop and mayor lured them into a trap by sending them to the technical school, claiming that French troops would protect them there. On April 16, 1994, an average of 65,000 Tutsis traveled to the school. Once the victims arrived, no water or food was provided. This was done to ensure the people were too weak to resist. After defending themselves for a few days using stones, the Tutsi were overrun on April 21. The French soldiers disappeared and the school was attacked by Hutu Interahamwe militiamen. Some 45,000 Tutsi were murdered at the school, and almost all of those who managed to escape were killed the next day when they tried to hide in a nearby church. According to the guide at the memorial, the French brought in heavy equipment to dig several pits where many thousands of bodies were placed. They then placed a volleyball court over the mass graves in an attempt to hide what happened. Among the bodies currently displayed are those of children and infants.\n\nOnly 34 people are thought to have survived the massacre in Murambi.\n\nThe memorial was founded on 21 April 1995. The site contains 50,000 graves. The school building is now a genocide museum exhibiting the skeletons and mummified bodies of some of the thousands of people killed in Gikongoro Province in 1994. In his study of Rwandan genocide memorials, Timothy Longman argues that although the bodies on display at Murambi are presented as those of people killed on site, in reality they are bodies brought to Murambi from throughout the surrounding area. Those killed at Murambi were buried in mass graves on site in 1996.\n\n"}

While the Cal Band is student-run, it is administered under the auspices of the university and represents Cal at sporting events and social gatherings. The name of the band is \"The University of California Band\" by the constitution, but is typically called \"The University of California Marching Band\" or \"The Cal Band\". When the band marches out of Memorial Stadium's North Tunnel for football pre-games, it is referred to as \"The Pacesetter of College Marching Bands, the Pride of California\".\n\nUnlike most other collegiate marching bands, the Cal Band is not under the University's Department of Music but rather the Department of Student Musical Activities, with other student-led organizations such as the University of California Jazz Ensembles and University of California Choral Ensembles. The Band is entirely student-run, save for one University-paid employee, its Director. Five students, each heading a specific point of leadership within the band—the Drum Major, Student Director, Executive Secretary, Public Relations Director, and Senior Manager—are elected by their peers and serve for terms of one calendar year. The five student leaders and the Director form the Executive Committee. The Senior Manager, who is the band's formal liaison with the university, is elected by the previous Executive Committee. All the other student Executive Committee positions are elected by a majority vote of the Band membership.\n\nUnlike other major collegiate bands, students run rehearsals, pick the songs, chart shows, arrange trips, and handle promotions through committee vote. This allows members to build their resumes and gain work experience.\nAs of the fall of 2017, the Band has 244 members (no color guard or auxiliary).\n\nAfter Robert Calonico's retirement in June 2018, Dr. Matthew Sadowski was named the University's new director of bands.\n\nThe Cal Band has its roots in the University Cadet Band established in 1891. In 1923, the Band was sponsored by the Associated Students of the University of California (ASUC) and its student leadership structure was formalized two years later. In the early years (prior to 1971), various faculty from the Music department were appointed director of the band through an arrangement with the ASUC.\n\nAfter the 1950 Rose Bowl against Ohio State University, the Cal Band decided to adopt its present chair step marching style after they discovered their performance looked lackluster in comparison to Ohio State's marching band. It is one of only three bands in the Pac-12 (the others being the Spirit of Troy and the University of Washington Husky Marching Band), and one of the few outside the Big Ten Conference, to use this physically demanding style. The Straw Hat Band, a subset of the Cal Band, was also established that same year.\n\nAfter Professor Cushing (director from 1934 to 1950) resigned, the Music Department was asked to provide the ASUC with a new Director for the Band. Coincidentally, James Berdahl (Student Director in 1938) was returning to Berkeley to work on his doctoral studies in music. The Music Department Chairman, Albert Elkus, convinced Berdahl to serve as acting Director of the Cal Band until the department could find a permanent replacement for Professor Cushing. Berdahl became permanent Director of the Cal Band at the end of the 1951 season, and remained in that position until 1971.\n\nIn the fall of 1968, Dr. David W. Tucker (Ph.D, Cal, 1969) was hired as arranger and composer. He was appointed Associate Director in 1969. His responsibilities with the Cal Band included rehearsing, auditioning prospective new members, and directing on the football field opposite director James Berdahl. For the 1971 season, during Berdahl’s sabbatical year in Japan, Tucker was named Acting Director. At the end of the 1971 season, Tucker left the Cal Band to accept the newly created position of Director of the University of California Jazz Ensembles, after having been the volunteer director since 1969.\n\nDuring the 1971 season, substantial podium time was taken by Assistant Director Robert O. Briggs. He was appointed acting director in 1972, and was made director in 1973.\n\nIn the 1970s, the Band's leadership structure was reorganized, a new band constitution written, and sponsorship moved from ASUC to the University. In the Spring Quarter of 1973, the all-male band voted to admit women, in the face of Title IX sanctions against the University, which was now the Band's primary funding source. There were fewer than 10 dissenting votes, against more than 100 votes in favor of admitting women. In the Fall 1973 marching season, 23 woman marched, together with 120 men. Although they rehearsed, marched and performed with the Band beginning in 1973, women were not entirely accepted by the Band's \"inner fellowship\" until through attrition the dissenting all-male band veterans had rotated out of the Band. More recently, the Band's membership has consisted of an even split of men and women, thus successfully broadening and improving the performance repertory possible for the Band's live performances.\n\nIn 1993, the Cal Band History Committee published a comprehensive history of the Cal Band. While this volume is now out of print, the text of the History Book can be found online at Cal Band History Book\n\nDirector Emeritus Robert O. Briggs died in 2008, leaving a legacy of musicianship spanning two generations of musicians.\n\nThe Cal Band has been seen and heard at a variety of performance venues. In the recent past, the Cal Band has appeared at the San Francisco Symphony's \"Black and White Ball,\" performed for such names as George Shultz (former U.S. Secretary of State), Peter E. Haas and family (UC Berkeley benefactors and the owners of Levi Strauss & Co.), and George Lucas. In addition, the Cal Band has been seen on \"The Ed Sullivan Show,\" the nationally syndicated game show \"Wheel of Fortune,\" Santa Rosa TV 50's morning program, KTVU Channel 2's \"Mornings on Two,\" KRON Channel 4's newscasts, \"Bay Area Backroads,\" and sportscaster Vernon Glen's \"Mr. Involvement.\" The Cal Band sound has been heard on dozens of Bay Area radio stations, such as WiLD 94.9 and KMEL 106.1, Live 105, and K101, and rounds out its exposure on the pages of numerous Bay Area newspapers. In 2010, 2012, and 2014, the band also led the San Francisco Giants victory parade in downtown San Francisco.\n\nIn 2016, the band played alongside Coldplay, Beyoncé, and Bruno Mars in the Super Bowl 50 halftime show. On May 18, 2016, the Cal Band traveled to Beijing, China and performed at the Juyongguan Pass section of the Great Wall.\n\nWintertime activities include playing at various on campus sporting events and trips to play at various ski resorts in the Lake Tahoe region.\n\nBefore 2002, in the spring, the Band performed a traditional \"\"Spring Show\"\" in UC Berkeley's Zellerbach Auditorium, combining the marching and playing talents of the band with other, hidden talents usually reserved for off the football field. Spring Show was discontinued in 2002 after financial burdens to the band resulting from funding cuts to the University of California system. In 2009, the Spring Show was brought back, to be discontinued again after the spring of 2011.\n\nIn a different sort of performance, the Cal Band was asked to help with the Nobel Lecture by George Smoot in 2006 by recreating \"The Big Bang.\" \n\nDuring weeks of home football games the Cal Band gives several performances. On Fridays before a game, the Cal Band plays at the noon rallies on Sproul Plaza. On game days the Cal Band gives a concert on Sproul Plaza an hour and a half before kickoff. Following this performance, the Band marches in formation to California Memorial Stadium, leading a procession of Cal alumni and fans. During home football games the band gives a pre-game show, a half time show, and typically a musical performance after the game as the crowd leaves. During the game, the band is seated to the left of the primary student section, and plays stand songs, as well as fight songs throughout the game. A \"break off\" band performed in the front of each major section during the third quarter prior to the 2012 renovation of California Memorial Stadium. In 2017, the band played alongside University of Washington Husky Marching Band in their “Tribute to Horn Bands” show, featuring music from The Blues Brothers, Tower of Power, Earth, Wind & Fire, and Chicago (band).\n\nIn the Bleacher Report's power ranking of the top 25 college marching band pregames shows and traditions, the Cal Band was named 9th (of 25) as having a show that \"beckons [the] former glory days, full of school songs and traditional formations\" and is \"a stand-alone classic\".\n\nThe Cal Band uses a fairly standard military band instrumentation with glockenspiels, piccolos, clarinets, alto saxophones, tenor saxophones, trumpets, mellophones, trombones, baritones, sousaphones, snare drums, tenor drums, bass drums, and cymbals.\n\nThe California Alumni Band, usually shorted to Cal Alumni Band, is a marching band consisting of former Cal Band members. The Cal Alumni Band is run by the non-profit Cal Band Alumni Association and is a subset of the Cal Alumni Association, an organization that handles alumni affairs of the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nThe Cal Alumni Band performs at various events such as: San Francisco AIDS Walk, Alumni Band Day, the Fourth of July Parade in Sausalito, California, Cal Basketball Games, and many other performances in the San Francisco Bay Area and across California.\n\n"}
{"id": "1847057", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1847057", "title": "Predicate (grammar)", "text": "Predicate (grammar)\n\nIn traditional grammar, a predicate is one of the two main parts of a sentence (the other is the subject, which is what the predicate modifies). For example, \"John [\"is yellow\"]\". \"John\" is the subject, and \"is yellow\" is the predicate, which modifies the description of the subject. It is usually headed with a verb. \n\nIn linguistic semantics, a predicate is an expression that can be \"true of\" something. Thus, the expressions \"is yellow\" or \"is like broccoli\" are correct descriptions of the subject, if the subject is yellow, or is like broccoli, respectively.\n\nThe predicate in traditional grammar is inspired by propositional logic of antiquity (as opposed to the more modern predicate logic). A predicate is seen as a property that a subject has or is characterized by. A predicate is therefore an expression that can be \"true of\" something. Thus, the expression \"is moving\" is true of anything that is moving. This classical understanding of predicates was adopted more or less directly into Latin and Greek grammars; and from there, it made its way into English grammars, where it is applied directly to the analysis of sentence structure. It is also the understanding of predicates as defined in English-language dictionaries. The predicate is one of the two main parts of a sentence (the other being the subject, which the predicate modifies). The predicate must contain a verb, and the verb requires or permits other elements to complete the predicate, or it precludes them from doing so. These elements are objects (direct, indirect, prepositional), predicatives, and adjuncts:\n\nThe predicate provides information about the subject, such as what the subject is, what the subject is doing, or what the subject is like. The relation between a subject and its predicate is sometimes called a nexus. A \"predicative nominal\" is a noun phrase, such as in a sentence \"\"George III is the king of England\"\", the phrase \"\"the king of England\"\" being the predicative nominal. The subject and predicative nominal must be connected by a linking verb, also called a copula. A \"predicative adjective\" is an adjective, such as in \"Ivano is attractive\", \"attractive\" being the predicative adjective. The subject and predicative adjective must also be connected by a copula.\n\nThis traditional understanding of predicates has a concrete reflex in many phrase structure theories of syntax. These theories divide an English declarative sentence (S) into a noun phrase (NP) and verb phrase (VP), e.g. \n\nThe subject NP is shown in green, and the predicate VP in blue. This concept of sentence structure stands in stark contrast to dependency structure theories of grammar, which place the finite verb (= conjugated verb) as the root of all sentence structure and thus reject this binary NP-VP division, even for English. Languages with more flexible word order (often called nonconfigurational languages) are often treated differently also in phrase structure approaches.\n\nMost modern theories of syntax and grammar take their inspiration for the theory of predicates from predicate calculus as associated with Gottlob Frege. This understanding sees predicates as relations or functions over arguments. The predicate serves either to assign a property to a singular term argument or to relate two or more arguments to each other. Sentences consist of predicates and their arguments (and adjuncts) and are thus predicate-argument structures, whereby a given predicate is seen as linking its arguments into a greater structure. This understanding of predicates sometimes renders a predicate and its arguments in the following manner:\n\nPredicates are placed on the left outside of brackets, whereas the predicate's arguments are placed inside the brackets. One acknowledges the valency of predicates, whereby a given predicate can be avalent (not shown), monovalent (\"laughed\" in the first sentence), divalent (\"helped\" in the second sentence), or trivalent (\"gave\" in the third sentence). These types of representations are analogous to formal semantic analyses, where one is concerned with the proper account of scope facts of logical quantifiers and logical operators. Concerning basic sentence structure, however, these representations suggest above all that verbs are predicates, and the noun phrases that they appear with their arguments. On this understanding of the sentence, the binary division of the clause into a subject NP and a predicate VP is hardly possible. Instead, the verb is the predicate, and the noun phrases are its arguments. \n\nOther function words – e.g. auxiliary verbs, certain prepositions, phrasal particles, etc. – are viewed as part of the predicate. The matrix predicates are in bold in the following examples:\n\nNote that not just verbs can be part of the matrix predicate, but also adjectives, nouns, prepositions, etc. The understanding of predicates suggested by these examples sees the main predicate of a clause consisting of at least one verb and a variety of other possible words. The words of the predicate need not form a string nor a constituent, but they can be interrupted by their arguments (or adjuncts). The approach to predicates illustrated with these sentences is widespread in Europe, particularly in Germany. \n\nThis modern understanding of predicates is compatible with the dependency grammar approach to sentence structure, which places the finite verb as the root of all structure, e.g. \n\nThe matrix predicate is (again) marked in blue and its two arguments are in green. While the predicate cannot be construed as a constituent in the formal sense, it is a catena. Barring a discontinuity, predicates and their arguments are always catenae in dependency structures.\n\nSome theories of grammar seek to avoid the confusion generated by the competition between the two predicate notions by acknowledging \"predicators\". The term \"predicate\" is employed in the traditional sense of the binary division of the clause, whereas the term \"predicator\" is used to denote the more modern understanding of matrix predicates. On this approach, the periphrastic verb catenae briefly illustrated in the previous section are predicators. Further illustrations are provided next: \n\nThe predicators are in blue. These verb catenae generally contain a main verb and potentially one or more auxiliary verbs. The auxiliary verbs help express functional meaning of aspect and voice. Since the auxiliary verbs contribute functional information only, they do not qualify as separate predicators, but rather each time they form the matrix predicator with the main verb.\n\nThe seminal work of Greg Carlson distinguishes between types of predicates. Based on Carlson's work, predicates have been divided into the following sub-classes, which roughly pertain to how a predicate relates to its subject.\n\nA \"stage-level predicate\" is true of a \"temporal stage\" of its subject. For example, if John is \"hungry\", then he typically will eat some food. His state of being hungry therefore lasts a certain amount of time, and not his entire lifespan. Stage-level predicates can occur in a wide range of grammatical constructions and are probably the most versatile kind of predicate.\n\nAn \"individual-level predicate\" is true throughout the existence of an individual. For example, if John is \"smart\", this is a property that he has, regardless of which particular point in time we consider. Individual-level predicates are more restricted than stage-level ones. Individual-level predicates cannot occur in \"presentational\" \"there\" sentences (a star in front of a sentence indicates that it is odd or ill-formed):\n\nStage-level predicates allow modification by manner adverbs and other adverbial modifiers. Individual-level predicates do not, e.g.\n\nWhen an individual-level predicate occurs in past tense, it gives rise to what is called a \"lifetime effect\": The subject must be assumed to be dead or otherwise out of existence.\n\nA \"kind-level predicate\" is true of a kind of thing, but cannot be applied to individual members of the kind. An example of this is the predicate \"are widespread\". One cannot meaningfully say of a particular individual John that he is widespread. One may only say this of kinds, as in\n\nCertain types of noun phrases cannot be the subject of a kind-level predicate. We have just seen that a proper name cannot be. Singular indefinite noun phrases are also banned from this environment:\n\nPredicates may also be collective or distributive. Collective predicates require their subjects to be somehow plural, while distributive ones do not. An example of a collective predicate is \"formed a line\". This predicate can only stand in a nexus with a plural subject:\n\nOther examples of collective predicates include \"meet in the woods\", \"surround the house\", \"gather in the hallway\" and \"carry the piano together\". Note that the last one (\"carry the piano together\") can be made non-collective by removing the word \"together\". Quantifiers differ with respect to whether or not they can be the subject of a collective predicate. For example, quantifiers formed with \"all the\" can, while ones formed with \"every\" or \"each\" cannot.\n"}

Shankar and produced by V. Ravichandran of Aascar Films. The plot centres on a disillusioned everyman whose frustration at what he sees as increasing social apathy and public negligence leads to a split personality that attempts to right the system. Vikram stars as Ambi, an idealistic, law-abiding lawyer who has multiple personality disorder and develops two other identities: a metrosexual fashion model named Remo, and a murderous vigilante named Anniyan. Sadha plays his love interest, Nandini. Actors Nedumudi Venu, Vivek, Prakash Raj, and Nassar also feature in the film.\n\nShankar conceived the film in mid-2003 during the post-production period of his previous film, \"Boys\". He based the film on his own life experiences during his formative years when he was disturbed by what he saw around him, and his eventual displeasure with society. Pre-production for \"Anniyan\" began in November 2003 and principal photography in March 2004. The making of the film, which included numerous production delays, took 14 months. The film was shot at Hyderabad, Thanjavur, Viluppuram and Chennai, and the song sequences were filmed in Mumbai, Malaysia, Amsterdam and Tenkasi. The film was notable for its recreation of the \"Tyagaraja Aradhana\" music festival and the extensive use of time slice photography in an action sequence.\n\nCinematographer V. Manikandan abandoned the project halfway through, until he was replaced with Ravi Varman. The technical departments were headed by V. T. Vijayan (editing), Sabu Cyril (production design), and Peter Hein (stunt choreography), and the soundtrack was composed by Harris Jayaraj, who was in his first collaboration with the director. The film was touted as the director's \"magnum opus\" and was budgeted at 263.8 million, making it at the time of its release the most expensive South Indian film ever made. Notably, it was the first South Indian film to obtain institutional finance, and it had the highest insurance coverage available for films at that time.\n\nOriginally filmed in Tamil, and released simultaneously in the four South Indian states on 17 June 2005, the film was dubbed into Telugu as \"Aparichithudu\" and in Hindi as \"Aparichit\" was released a year later on 19 May 2006. Further, the film was also dubbed into French and released in French-speaking countries worldwide by Columbia Tristar. While the film was a commercial success across South India, the Hindi version received a lukewarm response and was a box-office failure. \"Anniyan\" received positive responses from critics grossed 570 million in its lifetime run. In addition to winning eight Filmfare Awards and six State Film Awards, the film won a National Award in the Special Effects category.\n\nRamanujam Iyengar alias Ambi is a straightforward consumer protection advocate. He expects everyone to follow the law and prosecutes those who violate it. However, his efforts fail as circumstantial evidences always seem to favour the accused. His efforts to raise civic awareness go in vain due to pervasive corruption and a general lack of seriousness. Frustrated at his inability to bring about a change in society, his suppressed anger manifests itself in an alter ego named Anniyan, a grim reaper-themed vigilante who murders corrupt and indifferent people. Anniyan creates a website, compiles a list of wrongdoers in it and kills them using punishments described in the Garuda Puranam, one of the ancient Hindu scriptures.\n\nAmbi is secretly in love with his neighbour Nandini, a medical student and aspiring Carnatic singer, but never expresses his feelings due to fear of rejection. When he does get the courage to do so with help of his friend, Sub-inspector Chari, she rejects him as she cannot bear his strict adherence to rules. Distraught, Ambi attempts suicide, almost drowning himself before having second thoughts. Subsequently, he develops another personality named Remo, a metrosexual fashion model. Nandini is smitten by Remo and falls in love with him, unaware that Remo is one of Ambi's split personalities. Their marriage is eventually fixed.\n\nWhile purchasing a plot of land for her dowry, Nandini decides to undervalue the property to evade stamp duty. Ambi, who accompanies her as she registered the property, refuses to help her. Later, when Nandini and Remo are on a date, Remo transforms into Anniyan and attempts to punish her for her corrupt act. As he is about to kill her, Nandini calls out for Ambi. Anniyan then reverts to Ambi, who collapses and loses consciousness. Nandini takes Ambi to NIMHANS where he is diagnosed with multiple personality disorder. Through recovered-memory therapy, Vijaykumar, the chief psychiatrist of the hospital, uncovers Ambi's past. It is revealed that, when Ambi was fourteen years old, he witnessed the accidental death of his younger sister Vidya due to civic apathy. The incident left a deep emotional scar, which is the reason for his lofty ideals. It is also discovered that while Anniyan and Remo are aware of Ambi as a separate person, Ambi is oblivious to their existence within him. Vijaykumar declares that Remo will cease to exist if Nandini reciprocates Ambi's feelings, but Anniyan will cease only when the society reforms. Nandini accepts Ambi's love and Remo disappears.\n\nMeanwhile, DCP Prabhakar and Chari investigate the murders committed by Anniyan. In disguises, they discover clues left behind by Anniyan, which are the names of the punishments he meted out to his victims. Prabhakar is personally determined to bring Anniyan to justice as one of Anniyan's victims, Chockalingam, was his elder brother. In a dramatic publicity stunt, Anniyan admits to the murders he committed when he appears amidst the public and the press at the Nehru Stadium. He explains the rationale behind them and says that only when every Indian is responsible and sincere will the country prosper on par with developed nations. His methods draw both praise and criticism. Prabhakar tries to catch Anniyan, but he escapes.\n\nOn investigating the recorded footage, Prabhakar discovers that Anniyan is Ambi and arrests him. Ambi is brutally interrogated by Prabhakar; he is stabbed, slashed, and thrown into salt water by Prabhakar as revenge for Chockalingam's death. This leads to Ambi almost being killed, triggering Anniyan's reappearance. Ambi's personality alternates between Ambi and Anniyan; he brutally subdues Prabhakar as Anniyan, while begging for mercy as Ambi. Chari secretly records the interrogation through CCTV and uses it as evidence of Ambi's condition during his trial. Ambi is sentenced to psychotherapy in a mental hospital and will be eligible for release when cured.\n\nWhen Ambi is released two years later, his rigid adherence to protocol has diminished. He marries Nandini. While travelling on a train during their honeymoon, Ambi notices a man (an electrician who was indirectly responsible for his sister's death) drinking amidst fellow passengers. Suffering a relapse, he transforms into Anniyan and throws the man off the train, killing him. However, he hides the incident from Nandini, indicating that he has successfully blended his personalities into one instead of eradicating them.\n\n\n\nDuring the making of his Bollywood directorial debut \"Nayak\" in early 2001, director S. Shankar had conceived a science fiction film titled \"Robot\". A futuristic techno-thriller set in the 22nd century Chennai, the film was to feature Kamal Haasan and Preity Zinta in the lead roles. However, after completing a photo-shoot featuring the two, the production was shelved due to various reasons, including Haasan's unavailability of dates and creative differences with the director. Shankar postponed the project indefinitely and made the coming of age film, \"Boys\" (2003). When the post-production work of \"Boys\" was underway, Shankar was awaiting the return of its composer A. R. Rahman, who was then outside India, to complete the background score. In the meantime, Shankar had an idea for a storyline and called Vikram, who expressed enthusiasm for the subject.\nFollowing the release of \"Boys\" in August 2003, Shankar began work on his next directorial venture entitled \"Anniyan\". It was initially thought to be Shankar's pet project \"Robot\" revived with a new title, but this was later proven not to be correct. Shankar said the film was his \"dream project\" and disclosed that it would be a racy, fantasy-thriller. When questioned on how the idea behind the film had come to him, the director revealed, \"The seeds of all my movies were sown when I was young, long before I started making movies. So many things disturbed me, and these stayed with me. Those were the seeds. I make films based on them.\"\n\nWith the highest production value among Tamil films of its time, the film was touted to be the director's \"magnum opus\" and was labelled \"the most eagerly awaited film of the year\" by the media. The film deals with a person having dissociative identity disorder, commonly known as \"multiple personality disorder\" (MPD) or \"split personality syndrome\". It was compared to \"Chandramukhi\", released two months before, as it also focused on a character with the same syndrome.\n\nTo portray the lead character, Shankar needed a performer who could play an action hero. He chose Vikram as he felt that the actor, in addition to being a performer, had the image of an action hero. While his casting was made public in a November 2003 news report announcing the project's inception, the director revealed that Vikram was added to the cast in mid-2003 and refuted theories that the actor's casting was to capitalise on his new-found popularity following his success at the National Film Awards, where he won the National Film Award for Best Actor for his performance in the film \"Pithamagan\" (2003). Stating that Vikram was selected for the lead role months before the theatrical release of \"Pithamagan\", Shankar added, \"I don't look at actors that way.\" He further remarked that Vikram was the \"life and soul\" of \"Anniyan\".\n\nThe heroine role of a \"devoted Iyengar Brahmin girl\" was originally offered to Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, who was too busy to accommodate production dates. After months of waiting for her call sheet, Shankar eventually offered the role to Sadha. Expressing hope that it would be \"an important movie\" in her career, Sadha accepted the offer, working on the film for 120 days, adding, \"I have a major role to play in \"Anniyan\". There are few heavy portions involving me in the movie that I have given my best.\" She considered being a part of a Shankar film, especially during the early stages of her career, as a \"god's gift\" and a \"once-in-a-lifetime experience\". However, when offered similar roles following the film's success, she refused to be typecast and stated, \"I am now looking for roles where my creative potential is tapped. I don't want to be part of such cinema where all one has to do is dance around trees.\"\n\nVivek, Prakash Raj, Nedumudi Venu and Nassar appear in supporting roles. Mohan Vaidhya, a carnatic vocalist and occasional actor, plays a minuscule role as Sadha's father Krishna. Malavika Avinash was approached to play Vikram's mother; she rejected the offer, stating, \"I am too young to do a screen mom and too old to be a heroine!\" Cochin Haneefa, Charle, Kalabhavan Mani, Shanmugarajan and Saurabh Shukla make cameo appearances as delinquent citizens. Haneefa played an indifferent car owner who refuses to help an accident victim as he does not want his \"brand new car\" to be soiled with blood. Following Haneefa's death in February 2010, Vikram recalled the actor's appearance in the film and said, \"Though he'd come only in a few scenes no one could miss him. For roles that have some ambiguity about whether it's a good guy or a bad guy, he is one of the best choices. Until the end, one cannot really guess if he'll end up being good or bad.\" Comedian and character artiste Charle played an unnamed wastrel and alcoholic who extorts money from his ageing parents for his expenses and is considered by Anniyan to be a liability to society. Charle was instructed by Shankar, \"People should see only the character. Only later should they realise that it was Charle.\"\n\nThe role of the younger Ambi was played by child actor Hari Prashanth alias Viraj. When he came to the recording studio to voice his lines, he was accompanied by his father S. N. Surendar, a singer and dubbing artiste. Shankar recognised Surendar and asked him to lend his voice for Nedumudi Venu as the latter was a Malayali. In the 2004 comedy film \"Aethirree\", which featured Sadha in the female lead, Kanika played the second lead role of a \"naughty\" Brahmin girl. Shankar, apparently impressed with Kanika's performance in the film, asked her to attend a voice test. When the film-makers preferred Kanika's accent and modulation among the thirty females whose voices were tested, she was selected to dub for Sadha's Brahmin role.\n\nThe film was produced by V. Ravichandran under his film production and distribution company 'Oscar Films' (presently 'Aascar Films'). The screenplay was written by Shankar and the film had dialogue written by writer Sujatha Rangarajan. Shankar retained Sabu Cyril, his production designer from \"Boys\", to handle the set design; the scenes were edited by V. T. Vijayan. While the action sequences were orchestrated by Peter Hein and assisted by Stunt Silva, the dance sequences were choreographed by Raju Sundaram, Kalyan and Ahmed Khan. Film institute student Prabhu Raja Chozhan, who would later turn director with \"Karuppampatti\" (2013), joined Shankar as his protégé and worked as his assistant.\n\nShankar, who grew up admiring the works of cinematographer P. C. Sreeram in films like \"Nayakan\" (1987), \"Agni Natchathiram\" (1988) and \"Idhayathai Thirudathe\" (1989), desired to collaborate and was in talks with him to handle the photography. While Sreeram was intent on working in \"Anniyan\", he could not accept the offer due to prior commitments. It was initially reported in the media that Sreeram had been recruited; however, Shankar chose V. Manikandan as the director of photography, impressed with his work in \"Main Hoon Na\" (2004). Manikandan had earlier collaborated with Shankar when he shot the music video of the song \"Secret of Success\" in \"Boys\". Manikandan gave six months of bulk dates for the project; but, when the production was troubled by delays, Shankar demanded three more months to complete the film. Manikandan walked out in October 2004 citing scheduling conflicts and Shankar replaced him with Ravi Varman.\n\nDuring the casting stage of \"Boys\", the film's cinematographer Ravi K. Chandran was temporarily unavailable and his then-assistant Ravi Varman handled the camera to film Genelia D'Souza's makeup test. Subsequently, Varman nurtured a desire to work with Shankar. Before Shankar commenced work on \"Anniyan\", Varman expressed his desire to work in the film and was hopeful of landing the assignment. He was disappointed when Shankar recruited Manikandan for the project. However, when Manikandan abandoned the project after completing almost half the film, Shankar asked Varman to shoot the remaining portions of the film. Varman had committed to work in Bengali director Buddhadeb Dasgupta's next film, work on which was scheduled to begin shortly; he dropped out of it to accept Shankar's offer and termed working in \"Anniyan\" \"a dream come true\".\n\nVikram allotted 18 months and 190 days of his call sheet for the film, including 165 days of bulk dates spread across six months. Speaking on the extent of his involvement in the filmmaking process, Vikram said, \"Before beginning the film, I was totally involved in the research and preparation, but once on the sets, I go by what the director says.\" He further clarified that he discussed every shot with Shankar, went for re-takes where necessary to make the scenes better, and gave suggestions, but left the \"ultimate verdict\" to the director. Disclosing that, among the three shades to his character, he found playing Ambi to be the toughest, he reasoned, \"Because as a hero you are not used to being a wimp on screen. It's difficult digesting getting beaten up.\" In contrast, being a graduate in English literature, he found playing Remo much easier and more in his comfort zone.\n\nIn an interview with \"Gulf News\", Vikram spoke of the challenges in portraying all three characters while wearing the same costumes. He said, \"I love such challenges. [...] Although the costume defined each of the three characters in \"Anniyan\", there were scenes where Ambi would suddenly become Remo and Remo would become Anniyan. There I made it dramatic to bring out each character.\" He credited his wife Shailaja Balakrishnan, a psychologist, for helping him in fleshing out the character of Ambi, a person who has multiple personality disorder. In a conversation with film critic Baradwaj Rangan, Shailaja recalled the times the film was being made and spoke of Vikram, saying, \"I felt we should live in two houses. It's not easy to live with a man who can get that eccentric, an actor who wants to be that difficult on himself. I wouldn't say he becomes the character, but there's definitely some kind of internalisation.\" Vikram confessed that he had a tough time during the film's making as playing different characters affected him and he found himself going mad. He added that he would take a break after a 15-day shoot and watch the pigeons on his terrace as a way of dealing with the pressure.\n\nVikram grew a tummy to portray Ramanujam while he sported a \"macho look\" for Anniyan. He also grew his hair long in preparation for his role and rejected other film offers to maintain the continuity in his looks. Together with his character looks and those that he sported in the song sequences, Vikram appears in the film in 18 different getups. Vikram's look in the film was created by make-up artiste Banu. For those parts that show him as metrosexual Remo, he coloured his hair in streaks of copper and blonde. Unwilling to reveal his 'new look' until the film was ready, Vikram avoided the media despite winning the aforementioned National Award for the year 2003. Meanwhile, Sadha's make-up and hair styling were done by Mumbai-based celebrity stylist Ojas M. Rajani.\n\nThe film was officially launched with a traditional \"puja\" and muhurat shot on 4 March 2004 at AVM Studios, Chennai. The studio was decorated with life-sized stills showing Vikram in three distinct looks, \"a voodoo hunter, a pious 'sami' and a bubbling youth\"; this led the media to speculate that Vikram would be playing either a triple role or a character with three shades. The film's caption was 'He who comes from hell is not afraid of hot ashes'. During the launch function, Shankar expressed hope of completing the film in six months and releasing the film on 12 November 2004, coinciding with the Diwali festival. However, the production, which began shortly afterwards in May 2004, was marred by several delays and took 14 months to complete. The film was shot in Amsterdam, Malaysia, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Tenkasi, Thanjavur, Villupuram and Chennai.\n\nThe film features a scene at the \"Thiruvaiyaru Thyagaraja Utsavam\". The \"Utsavam\" is a week-long music festival which commemorates the 18th-century saint-composer Tyagaraja, revered as one of the greatest composers of carnatic music, and is held annually at his resting place in Thiruvaiyaru, Thanjavur. With the use of sets, the art department recreated the \"Tyagaraja Aradhana\" near Mahabalipuram in Tamil Nadu. For filming the scene, the crew recreated a performance of the famous kriti \"Jagadānanda kārakā\", the first of the five Pancharatna Kriti compositions of Tyagaraja, as performed during \"Tyagaraja Aradhana\". The \"aradhana\", held on the fifth day of the festival, witnesses exponents of carnatic music from across the world converging at his \"samaadhi\", where they sing his pancharatna kritis in unison as an homage to the saint.\n\nShankar approached violin maestro Kunnakudi Vaidyanathan, a regular participant at the actual event, to conceive and orchestrate the sequence. Vaidyanathan was serving as the secretary of Sri Thyagabrahma Mahotsava Sabha, the committee which organises the \"aradhana\". The scene features him in a cameo and was shot in June 2004 at a studio in Chennai. Realistic sets were erected to resemble the actual venue and leading carnatic vocalists Sudha Ragunathan, Sirkazhi G. Sivachidambaram, O. S. Arun, P. Unni Krishnan and instrumentalists such as violinist A. Kanyakumari, mridangam exponent Umayalpuram K. Sivaraman were recruited to add a touch of authenticity. The two-minute scene was brought to life in \"painstaking detail\". The sequence was much talked about and well appreciated.\nIn a fight sequence, Anniyan encounters about a hundred martial artists inside the fictional International Martial Arts School, Vodao. The stunt scene was shot at the JJ Indoor Stadium in Chennai over a period of 25 days. Peter Hein, the stunt choreographer, is a native of Vietnam. 127 professionally trained fighters were brought in from Vietnam for the shoot. During the rehearsals, the rope, to which the stuntmen were tied and hung upside down, gave in. About a dozen stuntmen crashed down from the balcony, injuring themselves badly. The action sequence was shot using 120 cameras for employing the time slice photography technique, a visual effect known as \"bullet time\" and popularised by the American film \"The Matrix\" (1999), to achieve the frozen-time effect. Shankar had earlier toyed with the idea of time-slice and tried it while filming the song \"Ale Ale\" in his \"Boys\". While the time-freeze sequence in \"Boys\" was achieved by the linking of 60–62 cameras to attain a 180° rotation, \"Anniyan\" employed 120–122 cameras for a 270° rotation.\n\nThe scene where Anniyan addresses a huge gathering was shot in a stadium in Hyderabad. As he speaks to the audience, the lights turn on and off in the background. Speaking on how the sequence was filmed, Ravi Varman said that they decided not to light up the entire stadium as they felt it would have looked flat. As the sequence was important to the film, he juxtaposed the stadium with light and shadow so that it would look different. During the pre-climax scene, when Ambi is held custody and enquired by Prabhakar, Ambi's persona keeps switching between the characters Ambi and Anniyan. Dubbed the \"chameleon act\" in the media, Vikram claims to have completed the sequence in a single take.\n\nAn action sequence was filmed in a set erected in Campa Cola grounds, Chennai. For the scene where Remo courts Nandini, a chemical tube brought from Malaysia was used to measure how attractive a person is. For filming scenes based on the punishments, buffaloes and snakes were transported in hundreds exclusively from Vellore and the sequence was shot for about three days. The \"Anthakoopam\" punishment sequence featuring the buffaloes was filmed in a set erected in Chennai's Prasad Studios. The animals were transported in 15 lorries containing 20 buffaloes each. For the scene where Charle's character is killed by Anniyan, the studio was filled with snake charmers who were brought in to handle the large number of snakes.\n\nThe semi-classical song \"Kumari\" was the first of the scenes to be shot. Filmed at the World Flower Show in May 2004, the sequence was picturised in a large tulip garden located in the city of Vijfhuizen near Amsterdam, Netherlands. The song was shot during the Netherlands International Flower Show called Floriade, a decennial event which was held between 10 April and 20 October 2004. While the crew had planned to film another song at a garden in Keukenhof, they were denied permission by the authorities as a previous Indian film crew had damaged the habitat a few weeks before.\n\nThe song features the lead pair singing amidst a flower farm as mridangam and flute players accompany them in the background. It was choreographed by Raju Sundaram who also appears in a cameo, playing a harmonium. As part of their roles, the male supporting actors who appear in the song were required to wear a \"panjakkacham\" and \"angavastram\", leaving most of their body exposed to the freezing cold. The shoot began as early as 5:30 AM and the locals, who thought they should be out of their mind to be dressed so, came up to them and warned that they might freeze to death.\n\n\"Iyengaru Veetu\", a semi-classical song, begins with a prelude of the Pancharatna Kriti \"Jagadānanda kārakā\". The actual song which follows later was picturised on a set erected at AVM Studios made to look like an old traditional Iyengar home in Thanjavur. The song was shot extravagantly with the lead pair and the dozens of support dancers sporting rich, colourful costumes.\n\nIn December 2004, a ten-day shoot was held in Mumbai for the item number \"Kadhal Yaanai\" featuring Vikram alongside a top model, whose identity was initially undisclosed to generate curiosity. It was later revealed to be Czech-based model Yana Gupta. Filmed by Ravi Varman and choreographed by Ahmed Khan, the song was filmed like a fashion show where Vikram and Yana Gupta wear fashionable clothes and sashay along a ramp. The song was filmed in a set erected in a studio to resemble a famous night-spot in London.\n\nThe track \"Kannum Kannum Nokia\", a peppy and trendy love duet choreographed by Raju Sundaram, was picturised on the lead pair and had them wearing costumes made entirely of designer labels. The song was picturised in Malaysia at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport and Petronas Towers. The song, filmed during the night, was reportedly the first song to be shot at the airport. Ravi Varman revealed in an interview that the song was shot like a commercial. The song was also filmed at the Nokia Headquarters in Espoo, Finland. \n\nThe folk song \"Andangkaaka\" was shot in a village near Sengottai. For filming the song, a huge set was erected to resemble a village. The sets were visualised and created by Sabu Cyril, the film's art director. Shankar adopted a village near Tenkasi and Sabu Cyril painted all the houses, roads, rocks and even a bridge in varied colours. They then hired hundreds of lorries and old model ambassador cars and painted faces on them. The lead pair were joined by hundreds of dancers and the total cost of the song worked out to 10 million. In all, 350 houses were painted.\n\nIn the narrative, Ambi is referred to the website, codice_1. Shankar envisioned that the website would take visitors through all the punishments that await sinners in hell. For designing the website, Shankar wanted to recreate hell and approached the Visual Computing Labs (VCL) of Tata Elxsi, a Mumbai-based company with which he had collaborated earlier for the song \"Girlfriend\" in \"Boys\". The team at VCL conceptualised and created a 'hell' in 3d animation with the punishments taken from ancient scriptures. They also designed a grim reaper astride his bull who guides visitors through hell. Pankaj Khandpur, creative director of VCL said, \"We tried to stay true to the scriptures, while creating imagery that wasn’t too gory. [...] an interesting project since we had to visualise it all without any reference point.\" The animation was done in a span of three months.\n\nVCL also did the CGI for a \"cosmic zoom\" scene, where the camera zooms from beyond the clouds to the streets of Chennai city, which no real camera can achieve. Aerial views and paintings of the city were stitched together along with computer generated images (CGI) of clouds to create the long, one-piece camera zoom. Animator and special effects designer L. I. Kannan, who would later turn director with the long-delayed period film \"Karikalan\" with Vikram in the lead, also worked on the special effects. Meanwhile, the special effects for the time-slice sequence were rendered by Big Freeze in London.\n\nThe scene where Anniyan addresses a packed audience in Nehru Stadium was filmed with the space empty. The crowd was created through visual effects using crowd multiplication methods. The VFX for the sequence was done under the supervision of visual effects consultant Zameer Hussain of Land Marvel Animation Studios, Chennai. The scene, in which hundreds of buffaloes chase down a delinquent car owner into an abandoned sand quarry and trample him to death, was accomplished through CGI using just one buffalo. The CG work was supplied by Jayakumar and V. Srinivas Mohan of the Chennai-based firm, Indian Artists Computer Graphics. Srinivas and his team had earlier worked with Shankar in \"Boys\". Speaking of the sequence, Srinivas quipped, \"The animals are lethargic and listless in their movements. Nothing can make them agile.\"\n\nThe storyline in \"Anniyan\" is typical of Shankar's yen for showcasing society's ills and targets the inept, rules-flouting public. The film sheds light on the increasing social apathy and public negligence, and attempts to address these issues which plague the society and hamper the development of India. S. Anand of Outlook noted that most of Shankar's films portrays the hero as a \"one-man agent of change\" and cited, \"From the neo-Nazi character Kamalahaasan plays in \"Indian\" to his last film \"Anniyan\", featuring a schizophrenic Brahmin serial killer who butchers 'wrongdoers', Shankar has always offered fascist-fantastic solutions to what he perceives as social ills resulting from typical governmental inertia.\"\n\nIn an interview with \"The Hindu\", Shankar elaborated on the message he conveys through the film:\n\nFollowing the release of the trailer on 7 May 2005, the film was believed to be inspired by the 1886 Robert Louis Stevenson novel, \"Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde\". Upon the film release, \"The Hindu\" drew parallels between it and the 1998 novel \"Tell Me Your Dreams\" by Sidney Sheldon. Shankar denied that the film was inspired by \"Tell Me Your Dreams\", claiming that he knew of the novel only after completing the script. Sify compared the character of Ambi to the protagonist of \"The Mask\" (1994), a film about a \"mild mannered guy changing into a one-man army, craving to see natural justice realised\".\n\nThe methods of punishment meted out to the sinners by Anniyan in the film is based on Garuda Purana, a Vaishnavite \"purana\" which speaks of life after death and punishments for wrongdoers. Shankar pointed out that he \"worked tirelessly day and night and intense research was done with the help of a professor in department of Vaishnavism in Madras University.\"\n\nThe film's soundtrack album and background score were composed by Harris Jayaraj. The lyrics for the songs were written by Vairamuthu, Na. Muthukumar and Kabilan. The album was released as a soft launch on 13 May 2005.\n\nThe album marked Shankar's first collaboration with Harris Jayaraj; all his previous directorial ventures had A. R. Rahman composing the music. As Rahman was busy with his debut Broadway musical Bombay Dreams and had also signed up for another musical Lord of the Rings, Rahman and Shankar decided to part ways. In early 2004, Harris Jayaraj went on a trip to Phuket Islands in Thailand for some inspiration for the album; he was accompanied by Shankar and Vairamuthu. Eventually, the three songs penned by the lyricist were composed in the island. The visit took place much before the tragic 2004 tsunami struck the countries bordering the Indian Ocean and wreaked havoc. In a chat with Shankar, Harris Jayaraj said \"the music was a challenge because the film was a mix of genres – action, comedy, thriller. In essence, it was a cock-mocktail ..\" Harris Jayaraj commenced the film's re-recording in April 2005 and took more than a month to complete, delaying the film's release.\n\nThe soundtrack album has five songs set to tune by Harris Jayaraj apart from a theme music. The album marks the playback singing debut of Nakul, Andrea Jeremiah and Saindhavi. The first song to be composed was \"Kumari\", a semi-classical folk melody sung by Shankar Mahadevan and Harini. \"Iyengaaru Veetu Azhage\", written by Vairamuthu is a pure carnatic song sung by Hariharan and Harini. The track begins with \"Jagadananda Karaka\", one of the Pancharatna Kritis by Saint Tyagaraja. \"Kadhal Yaanai\", a peppy club song, was sung by G. V. Prakash Kumar and Nakul. G. V. Prakash, who would later turn a composer, was working as a keyboard programmer for Jayaraj when Shankar noticed him and made him sing. While Kumar had already sung a few songs as a kid under Rahman (his maternal uncle), this was his first song as an adult. Again, it was Shankar who recommended using Nakul's voice to Jayaraj. Nakul had earlier sung for the backing vocals of Shankar's \"Boys\" which also marked his acting debut. Na. Muthukumar's lyrics for the song predominantly contains Tanglish words interspersed among Tamil words. The music of \"Andangkaka\", an aesthetic folk number, took three days to compose while the singers rehearsed for another five days to get the words right. The lyrics by Vairamuthu is written in pure Tamil in a dialect spoken in the region surrounding Theni and Madurai districts of Tamil Nadu. The song was rendered by Jassie Gift, Shreya Ghoshal and Saindhavi. The song \"Lajjavathiye\" from the soundtrack of the Malayalam film \"4 the People\" (2004) was composed and sung by Gift; it was a viral hit in Kerala. Jayaraj was impressed with him and made him sing, making it his first song in a Tamil film. The song also happens to be Saindhavi's maiden attempt at playback singing.\n\nT. Krithika Reddy of \"The Hindu\" remarked, \"Harris has steered clear of dreary conventions in music making. \"Anniyan\" too proves his relentless quest for freshness.\" Sreedhar Pillai of \"The Hindu\" said that the audio was impressive, with a combination of peppy songs and semi-classical numbers that will appeal to all. Another music critic pointed out that songs in Shankar's films become a rage only after the release of the films, as his lavish picturisation enriches the music.\n\nComparing the music with those of Rahman's in Shankar's previous films, Krishnakumar of Rediff.com said, \"Jayaraj doesn't disappoint, but while ARR wafted and lingered, Jayaraj explodes and fizzles away. Kumaari and Iyengar veetu azhage try to seep into your head and Randakka tempts you to tap your feet. But only momentarily. [...] you won't recollect them once the songs are over.\" The music was received well by the audience and the tracks \"Kadhal Yaanai\" and \"Kannum Kannum\" topped the charts.\n\nThe film cleared the censors without any cuts and was rated \"U\" (Universal) by the Central Board of Film Certification. While Shankar had hoped to release the film on Diwali 2004, there were numerous production delays which postponed the release date through early 2005. While production was completed in March 2005, the re-recording which began in April took more time than anticipated lasting nearly 45 days with Harris Jayaraj being blamed for further delays. After the film was postponed from 20 May 2005, and later, from 27 May 2005, the film was finally scheduled for 10 June 2005. But, Shankar released it a week later on 17 June 2005 as he considered 8 as his lucky number (1+7 yielding 8).\n\nThe film was dubbed into other South Indian languages and was released simultaneously in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala. The film was also released in key overseas countries like the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, Malaysia and Singapore. The film was released with 404 prints in Tamil and Telugu alone. Later, the film was dubbed into French by Paramount Pictures. Reportedly, \"Anniyan\" is the first Indian film to be dubbed into French and released in French-speaking countries worldwide by Columbia Tristar. The film was further dubbed and released in Hindi as \"Aparichit: The Stranger\" on 19 May 2006. It is the first film featuring Vikram in the lead to have a theatrical release in Hindi. At a private screening held a day before its Hindi theatrical release, the film received a \"warm reception\".\n\nThe film received mostly positive reviews from critics. Malathi Rangarajan of \"The Hindu\" said that the film works as it melds an interesting screen line with racy action. She also noted that the story resembled Shankar's \"Indian\" (1996) a lot while also bearing semblance to his \"Gentleman\" (1993). She remarked that the story and screenplay deserved to be lauded for its \"ingenious sparks in narration\" but problems arose with respect to its plausibility. She then declared, \" [...] some of the best camera shots, stunts and locations on a mind-boggling scale have been showcased. If you enjoy magnificence in cinema you will like this \"Anniyan\".\" Krishnakumar wrote for Rediff.com that learning from the debacle of \"Boys\", the director went back to his strength by taking a social theme, spicing it up and serving the perfect commercial fare. He added that in trying to explain multiple personality disorder in the simplest of terms, the director has only succeeded to a certain extent as a majority of viewers who are not that well informed might not even comprehend what is being said. Labelling the film as a \"must see\", a reviewer at Sify acclaimed that the film holds the viewers riveted with its racy narration, a relevant message backed with technical wizardry, never-seen before colourful song picturisation and particularly the performance of Vikram. Yet, the reviewer criticised that the film was too lengthy and the story too thin on logic.\n\nReviewing \"Aparichithudu\", the Telugu version of the film, \"The Hindu\" said that it was watchable. Regarding the Hindi version of the film, Raja Sen of Rediff.com derided the pathetic dubbing though saying that it was refreshing and watchable, despite boasting of enough masala to make the viewers sneeze. He concluded his review by saying, \"Overall, \"Aparichit\" is a slickly made, well-paced actioner that works quite well, despite the dub. The film is engaging and crisply scripted, and the action is never too excessive, lightened by jokes and general tomfoolery that never offensively interrupts the actual plot.\"\n\nFollowing the commercial success of the Telugu version \"Aparichitudu\", which was a runaway hit in Andhra Pradesh, Shankar was felicitated by Sri Venkateswara Social and Cultural Organisation (SVESCO) of Tirupati and was conferred the title 'Darsaka Brahma'. In a conversation with athlete Shiny Wilson, actor Jayaram remarked, \"\"Anniyan\" was a runaway hit in Kerala. But if a Malayalam star had tried out an \"Anniyan\"-kind of role with a weird hairdo, it would have been a disaster!\"\n\nThe film received numerous awards and nominations. Although Vikram had hoped that the film would get him his second National Award, the film won its only National Award in the Special Effects category. \"Anniyan\" became the fourth film directed by Shankar to receive that award; the other three are \"Kadhalan\" (1994), \"Indian\" (1996) and \"Jeans\" (1998). It also won eight out of the total 15 awards awarded by Filmfare for the best of Tamil cinema.\n\nBy the time the production was nearing completion, the trade sources had estimated the film to cost around 120–150 million; but, as often happens with films directed by Shankar, the budget was overshot. Made at a cost of 263.8 million, \"Anniyan\" was touted as the most expensive South Indian film to be ever made during the time of its release.\n\nIndiaGlitz estimates that the total production cost, excluding the remuneration cost of the cast and technicians, is 90 million. It was the first Tamil film and the first in South India to get institutional finance. For its institutional finance, it procured a sum of 95 million from IDBI Bank. \"Anniyan\" was insured by United India Insurance for 150 million, thereby making it the first south Indian film to be insured and also the largest insurance cover extended to a south Indian film at that time.\n\nWith the amount of hype the film generated in the media, theatre owners eagerly came forward and offered hefty prices as Minimum Guarantee (MG). In Tamil Nadu, funds amounting to 120 million were gathered as MG and advance. The MG raised through audio rights and movie distribution to theatres in Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Karnataka and overseas fetched a combined sum of 224 million. The film was distributed and released throughout Tamil Nadu by Aascar Films.\n\nThe rights for \"Aparichithudu\", the Telugu-dubbed version, was bought by a producer for an all-time record price. Meanwhile, the film was sold in Kerala for 13 million, which was again a record for a Tamil film there. The US rights was bought by the distribution house Bharat Creations. With the theatrical rights and pre-release booking, the trade circuit predicted that the film would recover its cost within ten days of its release.\n\nThe advance booking for the film began on 14 June 2005 across Tamil Nadu and received overwhelming response from the audience which the trade circuit felt was \"phenomenal\". The film took a \"historic opening\" worldwide and set multiple records at the box office. A day after release, the film was touted as a hit. In its opening weekend (17–19 June), \"Anniyan\" grossed 5.024 million from only six multiplexes in Chennai and reached #1 position at the Chennai box-office. In Sathyam Cinemas alone, the film grossed 1.4 million, the highest ever three-day opening from a single multiplex in South India.\n\nA week after release, the film grossed more than 10 million in Chennai, 2.7 million in Sathyam Cinemas, 7.1 million from 10 prints in Salem and netted 4.1 million in Coimbatore which were all box office records. And beyond Tamil Nadu, the film earned the distributors 12.7 million from Nizam in Andhra, 5 million in Karnataka and 1 million from 3 screens in Mumbai. The film got a hundred percent opening and surpassed \"Chandramukhi\" as the top-grossing Tamil film of the week, a position occupied by the latter since its release on 14 April 2005. IndiaGlitz likened the Vikram-Shankar combo to that of Sachin Tendulkar and Brian Lara batting together. The trade pundits estimated that V. Ravichandran would get a distributor's share of 80–100 million in its first week from cinemas across Tamil Nadu. A week after its release, the Telugu-dubbed version \"Aparichithudu\" was declared a hit in Andhra Pradesh. Distributor Karunakara Reddy of Megha Films in Hyderabad quipped, \"\"Aparichitudu\" has taken an opening just like a Telugu superstar film and should collect a distributor's share of Rs. 5–7 crores for the Nizam area alone.\" In Kerala, \"Anniyan\" released in 35 screens across the state, receiving a \"record opening\" for a Tamil film and became the first Tamil film to get a distributors' share of 6.2 million in its first week. A fortnight after its release, the film was labelled a \"super hit\" in Tamil cinema's half-yearly report compiled by film trade analyst for \"The Hindu\" Sreedhar Pillai.\n\nIn exactly a six-week theatrical run, \"Anniyan\" netted 10.5 million with a distributor's share of around 5.2 million. It was an \"all India record for collections, the highest share in least number of days from any theatre in India.\" However, in Tamil Nadu, collections began dropping five weeks after its release and it was estimated that the film would earn a share of 160 million. In September 2005, the film's gross earnings surpassed the 2 million milestone. At the completion of a 50-day run at Sathyam Cinemas, \"Anniyan\" \"recorded the highest 50 days collection for a Tamil film from a single screen in the world\" earning 11.29 million.\n\n\"Anniyan\" was declared a blockbuster at the close of the year and, together with \"Chandramukhi\", earned an estimated gross of 1.1 billion worldwide. The film also collected a distributor's share of 20 million. In Andhra Pradesh, \"Aparichitudu\" was named the biggest hit of 2005. The film did better business than straight Telugu films. It was the highest grosser among all Telugu films released that year. The film's success earned Vikram a big fan-following in Andhra. It also prompted producers in the Telugu film industry, which had hit a rough patch following a spate of box-office duds, to acquire the dubbing rights to Vikram's previous Tamil films and release them in Telugu.\n\nIn Kerala, the film ran for more than 150 days and grossed over 60 million, the most by a Tamil film there. In Karnataka too, the film was a \"big success\" although the exact box-office figures are not known. However, the film's Hindi version \"Aparichit\" opened to poor reception earning only 21 million across 150 screens and was declared a flop by Box Office India. While acknowledging that the film underperformed at the box-office, Vikram stated that it nevertheless made an impact. He further added that the film got him recognition from people in the remote corners of India as the drama and the action sequences greatly appealed to them. By the end of its theatrical run, the film had grossed 570 million in its lifetime.\n\nIn an August 2005 seminar titled \"Revisiting psychiatric disorders in Tamil films\", where the discussion revolved around the films \"Chandramukhi\" and \"Anniyan\", psychiatrist Asokan found many logical faults in both films. While acknowledging that \"Anniyan\" was a technically better film, he stated that it did not explain some of the medical theories. In another August 2005 seminar conducted to mark the anniversary of the Quit India Movement, where participants were urged to actively fight corruption, the convener T. Hema Kumari referred to the films \"Bhaarateeyudu\" (the Telugu dubbed version of \"Indian\") and \"Aparichitudu\". She noted that while such films which depict a fight against corruption were appreciated, people were reluctant to join movements against such issues.\n\nDuring the 20th Vijayawada Book Festival held at Vijayawada in January 2009, \"Garuda Puranam\", one of the 18 puranas of Hinduism, was a best-seller. Writing for \"The Hindu\", G.V. Ramana Rao said that the book was made popular following several mentions in the film and sold like \"hot cakes\". Following the stupendous success of \"Aparichitudu\" in Andhra Pradesh, the State Transport Corporation of Warangal named a bus Remo, after the character played by Vikram in the film. When stand-up comedian and television anchor Bosskey launched a quirky play titled \"Dada\" (Don) in October 2005, he named the cast after famous characters in Tamil films. Accordingly, Anniyan (one of Vikram's character in the film), Badshah (Rajinikanth in \"Baashha\") and Velu Nayakkar (Kamal Haasan's role in \"Nayakan\") play the central characters of a family of brothers. Similarly, in the 2013 comedy film \"Onbadhule Guru\", in which the characters were named after popular protagonists of Tamil cinema, a member of the supporting cast was christened Anniyan.\n\nThe characters played by Vikram were spoofed by Vadivelu in the Tamil film \"Aaru\" (2005); the comedy sequence also features four songs from the film's soundtrack album. \"Aparichitudu\", the film's Telugu version, was parodied by comedian Venu Madhav in the Telugu films \"Chatrapati\" (2005) and \"Seenugadu Chiranjeevi Fan\" (2005). It was also parodied, along with \"Chandramukhi\", in the film \"Rajababu\" (2006). In the 2010 film \"Thamizh Padam\", a full-length parody on stereotypical characters and clichéd sequences in Tamil cinema, the lead actor Shiva recreates the \"Anthakoopam\" punishment sequence to comic effect, where he tries to force a herd of buffaloes into stampeding a villain but fails in his attempt. Later, the comedy sequence was re-enacted by Allari Naresh in \"Sudigadu\" (2012), an official remake of \"Thamizh Padam\". In the 2012 Kannada film \"Yaare Koogadali\", a remake of the Tamil film \"Poraali\" (2011), the long and unkempt hair sported by Puneeth Rajkumar was reportedly inspired by the look of Anniyan. The character Remo inspired Sivakarthikeyan's film to have a title of the same name.\n\n\n"}

He made his senior debut for United on 24 October 1956, when he played in the 1956 FA Charity Shield at the age of 16 years and 19 days, making him the youngest player ever to have played for the club. His league debut came over a year later, in a 4–3 home defeat to Tottenham Hotspur on 30 November 1957.\n\nHe was not with the Manchester United squad when their aeroplane crashed at Munich on the way home from a European Cup tie on 6 February 1958, killing eight players.\n\nBy the early 1960s, he had become a regular in the United first team, covering for first choice goalkeeper Harry Gregg. The zenith of Gaskell's career came in 1963, when he kept goal for United in their 1963 FA Cup Final win over Leicester City.\n\nA succession of injuries to Gregg meant that Gaskell was in and out of the first team on a regular basis, but the signing of Pat Dunne in May 1964 meant that Gaskell was relegated to the position of third-choice goalkeeper. Both Gregg and Dunne left in 1966, but the arrival of Alex Stepney and the emergence of young Jimmy Rimmer meant that Gaskell was still third-choice at the club, so he left in the summer of 1969.\n\nOn departing from Old Trafford, Gaskell signed for Wrexham and remained there for three years. He worked for Post Office Telephones (now BT) for a short period before moving to South Africa, where he played for Arcadia Shepherds until his retirement.\n\n"}

First elected as a Conservative MP, Greening had the Conservative whip removed on 3 September 2019 and sat as an independent MP after that.\n\nGreening served in the Cameron Government as Economic Secretary to the Treasury and Secretary of State for Transport, prior to being appointed Secretary of State for International Development in September 2012. From 14 July 2016 to 8 January 2018, she served as Secretary of State for Education and Minister for Women and Equalities in the May Government. She resigned as Education Secretary in the January 2018 Cabinet reshuffle. On 3 September 2019, Greening announced she would not be standing as a Conservative at the next general election and subsequently had the whip withdrawn.\n\nGreening was born in Rotherham, where she attended Oakwood Comprehensive School. She studied Business Economics and Accounting at the University of Southampton, graduating with a first class honours degree in 1990. She obtained an Executive MBA from the London Business School in 2000.\n\nBefore entering parliament, she trained and qualified as an accountant, working as an accountant/finance manager for, amongst others, PricewaterhouseCoopers, GlaxoSmithKline and Centrica.\nShe contested the constituency of Ealing, Acton and Shepherd's Bush in 2001; Greening finished second with a reduced share of the vote for the Conservatives.\n\nGreening gained the seat of Putney from Labour in the 2005 general election on 5 May 2005. Greening won 15,497 votes (42.4% of the vote) giving her a majority of 1,766 (4.8%). She unseated Tony Colman, who had held the seat for Labour since defeating David Mellor in 1997.\n\nAs the first Conservative elected on the evening of the election, her victory was the first real sign that the Conservative Party was to reduce the Labour Government's majority and begin to recover from the landslide defeats of the 1997 and 2001 general elections. Michael Howard, who had visited Putney to give a speech on his first day as Conservative Leader, returned there on the morning after the election to congratulate Putney Conservatives and give the speech in which he announced his intention to step down. Greening was the youngest female Conservative MP in the House of Commons until Chloe Smith was elected to Parliament on 12 October 2009.\n\nGreening was appointed a vice-chair (with responsibility for youth) of the Conservative Party on 15 December 2005, having earlier that year been appointed a member of the Work and Pensions Committee. In July 2007, following a shadow ministerial reshuffle, she was promoted to be a Junior Shadow Minister for The Treasury.\n\nIn January 2009, following a further shadow ministerial reshuffle, Greening was promoted to Shadow Minister for London, within the Communities and Local Government Team with responsibility for Local Government Finance. Within this brief, she focused on transport and local community benefits.\n\nIn March 2010, she was put in charge of co-ordinating the Conservative campaign for the 2010 general election in London. She held the post of Economic Secretary to the Treasury from 13 May 2010 to 14 October 2011, where she helped deliver the emergency budget in 2010. \n\nIn 2018, she established the Social Mobility Pledge upon returning to the backbenches, a new scheme aimed at broadening social mobility and opportunity in Britain. Later that year, she became the first senior Conservative to come out in favour of a new EU referendum, arguing that Parliament was unable to make a decision on Brexit and therefore it had to be put back to the people. In October 2018, in an interview on \"Good Morning Britain\" she was asked if she would be interested in launching a leadership bid. Greening said: \"Well, things need to change, don't they, and people need to have some hope for the future that Britain can be a country that runs differently and more fairly.\" Questioned again on whether she would stand for the Conservative leadership if there were a vacancy, Greening said: \"I might be prepared to, but I'm more interested in the Conservative party actually showing what it can do for this country.\"\n\nIn early 2019, she co-founded the group Right to Vote alongside Dominic Grieve and Phillip Lee calling for a new referendum. After the formation of The Independent Group, Greening suggested that she could resign the Conservative whip if there was a 'no deal' Brexit. In April 2019, Greening indicated again that she would run for the Tory leadership if a 'centrist' did not run. She also unveiled possible policies such as scrapping tuition fees in favour of a graduate tax and increasing the number of Opportunity Areas. \n\nIn October 2011, she was appointed Secretary of State for Transport and was sworn of the Privy Council.\n\nWhilst Greening represented the London constituency of Putney she had always campaigned against a third runway at Heathrow Airport. In the run up to the 2012 Cabinet reshuffle, Greening said it would be difficult to serve in a Cabinet which was in favour of a third runway.\n\nIn her role as Secretary of State for Transport, Greening oversaw the award of new rail franchises, including the award of the Intercity West Coast franchise to First Group in 2012. In October 2012, Greening announced that the government was cancelling the franchise competition for the InterCity West Coast franchise after discovering significant technical flaws in the way the franchise process was conducted, reversing the decision to award it to FirstGroup. Subsequently, Sir Philip Rutnam, then Permanent Secretary at the Department for Transport, issued an apology to Greening stating the problem “clearly the responsibility of officials and not ministers\". A report by the Transport Select Committee found fault with Greening and revealed that the cost to the taxpayer of the flawed franchise process was at least £40 million.\n\nOn 4 September 2012, she was replaced by Patrick McLoughlin at the Department for Transport and became Secretary of State for International Development. The move was strongly criticised by the Mayor of London Boris Johnson who believed it was linked to her opposition to a third runway at Heathrow. As Secretary of State for International Development, Greening became a member of the National Security Council.\n\nWhilst in the role of International Development Secretary, the UK became the first G8 country to meet the commitment to spend 0.7% of it’s gross national income on international development, meeting the UN official development assistance target subsequently legislating for this. Greening lead the UK response to international natural disasters such as Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines in 2013 and the Nepal earthquake in 2015.\n\nIn 2014, Greening held the first ever Girl Summit in London, which saw leaders and young people from all over the world come together to work to help combat female genital mutilation and early and forced marriage. \n\nGreening led the UK response to the Syria crisis including the UK work in Lebanon and Jordan to support local economies to provide work for refugees as well as local people. Greening pioneered the “No Lost Generation” initiative with then UNHCR boss Antonio Guterres and UNICEF to enable Syrian refugee children to still continue their education.\n\nGreening led the international response to the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone in 2014-2015, committing a £230 million aid package including support for 700 treatment beds and funding for children orphaned by the crisis. Greening stated that children would not be “left behind once Ebola was defeated.” “Operation Gritrock” was the first ever UK military campaign led by DFID, and was also supported by NHS personnel. \n\nIn 2015, Greening announced a new economic empowerment programme for women at the Global Goals Summit and campaigned successfully for Sustainable Development Goal 5: Gender Equality to be included amongst the UN Sustainable Development goals during international negotiations. \n\nFollowing an initiative by Greening, Ban Ki Moon, then UN Secretary General, announced in 2016 the creation of the UN’s first high-level panel on women’s economic empowerment. Greening joined other founding panel members including Jim Kim, the then President of the World Bank, and Christine Lagarde, the then head of the International Monetary Fund, to make recommendations on how to support the realisation of women’s economic potential around the world. \n\nDuring the refugee crisis, Greening oversaw £1 billion pounds of aid spending to support Syrian refugees with water, food, shelter and medical care. Greening further pressured UK businesses and other countries to “put their hands in their pockets” to help before warning the European migrant crisis could last 20 years if nothing was done. Greening argued during negotiations for the Paris Climate Change Agreement that climate change would continue to be a root cause of refugee migration and launched an insurance scheme to help developing nations deal with natural disasters caused by climate change. \n\nGreening was appointed Secretary of State for Education and Minister for Women and Equalities by Theresa May on 14 July 2016, replacing Nicky Morgan in both roles. During her time in these posts, she announced the creation of social mobility 'opportunity areas', and the approval of additional free schools. She has also spoken in favour of creating new grammar schools and retaining university tuition fees.\n\nIn the June 2017 general election, after which the Conservatives formed a minority government, she held her Putney constituency with a reduced majority and a loss in vote share of 9.7%. She remained Education Secretary and Minister for Women and Equalities after the election until her resignation from government on 8 January 2018, during a cabinet reshuffle: it was reported that she had rejected the post of Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, interpreted variously as the offer of a \"sideways move\" or a demotion.\n\nWhilst Education Secretary, Greening developed targeted Opportunity Areas across England which saw targeted funding to link schools and employers in areas with weak social mobility. In December 2017, Greening launched the Department for Education’s Social Mobility Action Plan to improve social mobility through education which included four ambitions on further education, skills, early years and attainment gaps. Other departments in Whitehall have followed the example and have also created their own social mobility action plans.\n\nOn 3 September 2019, Greening joined 20 other rebel Conservative MPs to vote against the Conservative government of Boris Johnson. The rebel MPs voted with the Opposition against a Conservative motion which subsequently failed. Effectively, they helped block Johnson's \"no deal\" Brexit plan from proceeding on 31 October. Subsequently, all 21 were advised that they had lost the Conservative \"whip\", expelling them as Conservative MPs, requiring them to sit as independents. If they decided to run for re-election in a future election, the Party would block their selection as Conservative candidates. Greening, however, said she was not planning to stand for re-election.\n\nSince leaving Parliament, Greening is a leading UK voice on social mobility and campaigns for equality of opportunity across Britain through the Social Mobility Pledge. In 2020, following the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus, and ensuing United Kingdom lockdown, Greening launched the C-19 Business Pledge, galvanising the UK business response by asking them to provide extra support to their employees, customers and communities during the crisis. Some of the UK’s biggest businesses signed onto support including BP, RBS, and Experian.\n\nIn June 2016, Greening revealed on Twitter that she was in a \"happy same-sex relationship\". Referring to the EU membership referendum, she added: \"I campaigned for Stronger In but sometimes you're better off out!\" Greening was previously in a relationship with Mark Clarke, a former Conservative parliamentary candidate for Tooting who was expelled from the party for his involvement in a bullying scandal of young members.\n\n"}

{"id": "1847118", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1847118", "title": "Language module", "text": "Language module\n\nThe language module, also known as the \"language faculty\", is a hypothetical structure in the human brain or cognitive system which contains innate capacities for language, originally posited by Noam Chomsky. There is ongoing debate about this in the fields of cognitive science and neuroscience.\n\nThe notion of a dedicated language module in the human brain originated with Noam Chomsky's theory of Universal Grammar (UG). The debate on the issue of modularity in language is underpinned, in part, by different understandings of this concept. There is, however, some consensus in the literature that a module is considered committed to processing specialized representations (domain-specificity) (Bryson and Stein, 2001) in an informationally encapsulated way. A distinction should be drawn between anatomical modularity, which proposes there is one 'area' in the brain that deals with this processing, and functional modularity that obviates anatomical modularity whilst maintaining information encapsulation in distributed parts of the brain.\n\nThe available evidence points towards no one anatomical area solely devoted to processing language. The Wada test, where sodium amobarbital is used to anaesthetise one hemisphere, shows that the left-hemisphere appears to be crucial in language processing. Yet, neuroimaging does not implicate any single area but rather identifies many different areas as being involved in different aspects of language processing. and not just in the left hemisphere. Further, individual areas appear to subserve a number of different functions. Thus, the extent to which language processing occurs within an anatomical module is considered to be minimal. Nevertheless, as many have suggested, modular processing can still exist even when implemented across the brain; that is, language processing could occur within a functional module.\n\nA common way to demonstrate modularity is to find a double dissociation. That is two groups: First, people for whom language is severely damaged and yet have normal cognitive abilities and, second, persons for whom normal cognitive abilities are grossly impaired and yet language remains intact. Whilst extensive lesions in the left hemisphere perisylvian area can render persons unable to produce or perceive language (global aphasia), there is no known acquired case where language is completely intact in the face of severe non-linguistic deterioration. Thus, functional module status cannot be granted to language processing based on this evidence.\n\nHowever, other evidence from developmental studies has been presented (most famously by Pinker) as supporting a language module, namely the purported dissociation between Specific Language Impairment (SLI), where language is disrupted whilst other mental abilities are not, and Williams Syndrome (WS) where language is said to be spared despite severe mental deficits. More recent and empirically robust work has shown that these claims may be inaccurate, thus, considerably weakening support for dissociation. For example, work reviewed by Brock and Mervis and Beccera demonstrated that language abilities in WS are no more than would be predicted by non-linguistic abilities. Further, there is considerable debate concerning whether SLI is actually a language disorder or whether its aetiology is due to a more general cognitive (e.g. phonological) problem. Thus, the evidence needed to complete the picture for modularity intact language coupled with gross intellectual deterioration is not forthcoming. Consequently, developmental data offers little support for the notion that language processing occurs within a module.\n\nThus, the evidence from double dissociations does not support modularity, although lack of dissociation is not evidence against a module; this inference cannot be logically made.\n\nIndeed, if language were a module it would be informationally encapsulated. Yet, there is evidence to suggest that this is not the case. For instance, in the McGurk effect, watching lips say one phoneme whilst another is played creates the percept of a blended phoneme. Further, Tanenhaus, Spivey-Knowlton, Eberhard and Sedivy (1995) demonstrated visual information mediating syntactic processing. In addition, the putative language module should process only that information relevant to language (i.e., be domain-specific). Yet evidence suggests that areas purported to subserve language also mediate motor control and non-linguistic sound comprehension. Although it is possible that separate processes could be occurring but below the resolution of current imaging techniques, when all this evidence is taken together the case for information encapsulation is weakened.\n\nThe alternative, as it is framed, is that language occurs within a more general cognitive system. The counterargument is that there appears to be something ‘special’ about human language. This is usually supported by evidence such as all attempts to teach animals human languages to any great success have failed (Hauser et al. 2003) and that language can be selectively damaged (a single dissociation) suggesting proprietary computation may be required. Instead of postulating 'pure' modularity, theorists have opted for a weaker version, domain-specificity implemented in functionally specialised neural circuits and computation (e.g. Jackendoff and Pinker’s words, we must investigate language “not as a monolith but as a combination of components, some special to language, others rooted in more general capacities”).\n\nThe debate is ongoing.\n\n\n"}

The first artist signed to David Geffen's Asylum label, she released two albums on Asylum and partially completed a third album before dying of a drug overdose in 1979. \nHer eponymous debut album was released in late 1971 and was followed about 18 months later by \"Heart Food\". In 1974, she recorded demos for a third album, which never was completed. The demos were released posthumously with other rarities on the 2005 two-disc collection \"Dreams Come True\".\n\nSill was influenced by Bach, especially his suites, while lyrically her work drew substantially on Christian themes of rapture and redemption.\n\nJudith Lynne Sill was born in Studio City, California on October 7, 1944, and spent her early childhood in the Oakland, California area. Her father, Milford \"Bun\" Sill, an importer of exotic animals for use in films, owned a bar in Oakland, in which Sill learned to play the piano. When he died of pneumonia in 1952, Sill's mother Oneta moved with Judee and her older brother Dennis to Los Angeles, where Oneta soon met and married \"Tom and Jerry\" animator Kenneth Muse.\n\nIn a 1972 \"Rolling Stone\" magazine interview, Sill described her home life after her mother's remarriage as unhappy and frequently violent due to physical fights between Sill and her parents. She transferred from a public high school (Birmingham High School in Van Nuys) to a private school, where she met other rebellious teenagers, some of whom were allegedly involved in crime. Either during high school or after her graduation (depending on the source), Sill and a man she had met committed a series of armed robberies of businesses such as liquor stores and gas stations. Sill and her robbery partner were soon arrested and she spent nine months in reform school, where she served as church organist and \"learned a lot of good music\" including gospel music.\n\nAfter being released, Sill briefly attended San Fernando Valley Junior College as an art major. She also played piano in the school orchestra and worked in a piano bar. In 1964, her mother died, and she left college and moved out of her stepfather's home. She started doing LSD and other drugs, moved in with an LSD dealer and joined a jazz trio.\n\nIn April 1966, Sill married pianist Robert Maurice \"Bob\" Harris. \nThe couple lived in Las Vegas for a time, but both developed crippling heroin addictions within months. When Sill moved back to California, she resorted to sex work, scams, and check forgery to support her habit. A string of narcotics and forgery offenses sent her to jail, and she learned that her brother Dennis had suddenly died of a liver infection. When she got out, she immediately set to work as a song composer.\n\nSill encountered Graham Nash and David Crosby and toured with them for a time as their opening act. After some initial interest from Atlantic Records, David Geffen offered her a contract with his new Asylum label. She sold her song \"Lady-O\" to the Turtles, and was featured on the cover of \"Rolling Stone\". Harris worked on her first album and was involved with the Turtles (which led to her short stint as keyboardist with Frank Zappa's Mothers of Invention in 1971).\n\nGraham Nash produced her first album's first single, \"Jesus was a Cross Maker\", released to radio on October 1, 1971. The album \"Judee Sill\" was released on September 15, 1971. It featured Sill's voice in multiple overdubs, often in a four-part chorale or fugue. She worked with engineer Henry Lewy, noted for his work with Joni Mitchell throughout the 1970s. The album was not a commercial success.\n\nSill took over the orchestration and arrangements on her second album \"Heart Food\", which included \"The Donor\". \"Heart Food\" was released in March 1973 and was critically acclaimed, but sold poorly, leading to the end of her association with Geffen and Asylum Records. Sill's friends have said that she lacked the resilience to cope with poor album sales and bad reviews of her work, and that she was dropped after she refused to perform as an opening act, a task she disliked. According to another source, Geffen pulled support for \"Heart Food\" and refused to release any more of her records after Sill, frustrated over what she perceived as his lack of support for her career, publicly referred to him by using a homophobic slur (she either called Geffen \"fat fag” on stage or referred to his “faggoty pink shoes”).\n\nShe continued to write songs, and in 1974, began to record new material for a planned third album. By this time, Sill was once again suffering from drug abuse and other health problems, and her music was not regarded as marketable. She also was beginning to lose interest in music and focus on other pursuits, including theosophy and animals. In the mid-1970s, she worked for a time as a cartoonist with a Los Angeles animation studio. Her 1974 recordings were never finished. Twenty-six years after Sill's 1979 death, the unfinished songs were mixed by Jim O'Rourke and released, along with a collection of rarities and home demos, as the album \"Dreams Come True\" on the Water label.\n\nSill's personal life was turbulent, and she was affected by the early deaths of her father, mother and brother. Sill claimed to have been married twice, saying in interviews that she was briefly married either during or just after high school to a classmate, that her parents had the marriage annulled, and that he later died in a rafting accident. A friend of Sill's has written that she claimed to have married her robbery partner as a teenager. Sill's second marriage was to Robert Maurice \"Bob\" Harris on April 27, 1966 in Clark County, Nevada. They divorced in 1972. She married Samir Ben Taieb Kamoun, a Tunisian actor, mime, and Charlie Chaplin impersonator, on January 24, 1979 in Clark County, Nevada.\n\nSill was openly bisexual and had relationships with both men and women. Her romance with singer-songwriter J.D. Souther inspired her song \"Jesus Was a Cross Maker\". Souther later wrote the song \"Something in the Dark\" about her. She had a long-term relationship with poet David Omer Bearden, who contributed lyrics to \"Heart Food\" and toured and performed with her; Sill dedicated \"Heart Food\" to him. As Asylum's first published artist, Sill also had a close friendship with David Geffen, which went awry after comments she made in frustration at not receiving enough promotion for her second UK tour.\n\nAfter a series of car accidents and failed surgery for a painful back injury, Sill struggled with drug addiction and dropped out of the music scene. She died of a drug overdose, or \"acute cocaine and codeine intoxication,\" on November 23, 1979 at her apartment on Morrison Street in North Hollywood. The Los Angeles coroner ruled her death a suicide, taking into account a note found near her body, but some who knew her have contended that the note, which reportedly contained \"a meditation on rapture, the hereafter, and the innate mystery of life\", was not a suicide note but rather a diary entry or song concept. Her ashes were scattered into the Pacific Ocean after a ceremony organized by a few close friends at the Self-Realization Fellowship in Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles. According to a 2006 \"Washington Post\" story, by the time of Sill's death, she had become so obscure that no obituary was published, and for many years, a number of her friends were unaware she had died.\n\nAlthough Sill's music was not commercially successful, a number of later songwriters have been fans of her work, including Andy Partridge, Liz Phair, Warren Zevon, Shawn Colvin, Steven Wilson and Terra Spencer. She was included in \"The Billboard Guide to Contemporary Christian Music\"; her faith was debatable, but she made frequent use of Christian symbolism in her lyrics, combined with a \"lack of sensuality\" and the \"denial of the physical\". Her music has been described as \"intensely devotional\".\n\nA BBC Radio 4 program titled \"The Lost Genius of Judee Sill\" was broadcast on September 9, 2014.\n\nThe Okkervil River song \"Okkervil River R.I.P.\" speaks of Sill as having died \"in some trailer park of cocaine and codeine, all alone.\"\n\nSinger-songwriter Laura Veirs's \"Song for Judee\" on the 2016 album \"case/lang/veirs\" is about Sill's life and death. In an interview with CBC music, Veirs said of the track \"We weren’t sure we were going to track this one because not everyone in the band loved it. We recorded it on a whim and all fell in love with it. It’s about a tragic songwriter from the ’70s named Judee Sill. I love how the bouncy chorus offsets the darkness of her story.\"\n\nTerry Hounsome's 1981 book \"New Rock Record\" lists a Sill album titled \"Tulips From Amsterdam\". Unsure of the information's source, Hounsome later removed the listing from his database.\n\nSill appears on Tommy Peltier's \"Chariot of Astral Light (featuring Judee Sill)\", which was recorded in the 1970s but not released until 2005 on the Black Beauty label. She contributed guitar, organ and backing vocals to six tracks on the album and is pictured with Peltier on the cover. Also in 2005, Sill's unfinished recordings, mixed by Jim O'Rourke, were released along with other rarities and unreleased demos as \"Dreams Come True,\" a two-CD set on Water Records. Sill's two original albums, \"Judee Sill\" and \"Heart Food\", were released that year as individual CDs, each with bonus tracks, on the Rhino Handmade label. The next year, Rhino released \"Abracadabra: The Asylum Years,\" a two-CD set of both albums with bonus tracks.\n\nIn 2007, an album of Sill's live performance tracks performed for the BBC was released as \"Live in London: The BBC Recordings 1972-1973\".\n\nIn 2017 independent record label Intervention Records released 180-gram double 45rpm LP reissues of Sill’s self-titled album and \"Heart Food\".\n\n\"Jesus Was a Cross Maker\" has been covered by the Hollies on their 1972 album \"Romany\"; by Cass Elliot on her self-titled 1972 album; by Judie Tzuke on her 1991 album \"Left Hand Talking\"; by Warren Zevon on his 1995 album \"Mutineer\"; and by Rachael Yamagata in 2005 for the soundtrack of the Cameron Crowe film \"Elizabethtown\", in which The Hollies’ version is played over the opening credits. The soundtrack album for the film contains versions by both Yamagata and the Hollies.\n\nShawn Colvin performed \"There's a Rugged Road\" on her 1994 collection of covers titled \"Cover Girl\".\n\nJane Siberry contributed vocals to a cover of \"The Kiss\" for Ghostland's album \"Interview with the Angel\". This version was also released on Siberry's 2001 compilation \"City\".\"The Kiss\" was also covered by Bonnie \"Prince\" Billy on his 2004 CD single \"No More Workhorse Blues\"; by Neil Cavanagh on his 2008 album \"Short Flight to a Distant Star\"; and by Matt Alber, using Sill's original piano arrangement, on his 2011 album \"Constant Crows\".\n\nIn 2009, the independent label American Dust announced the release of \"\", featuring covers of Sill's songs done by Beth Orton, Bill Callahan, Ron Sexsmith, Daniel Rossen, Final Fantasy, Marissa Nadler, Frida Hyvönen and Meg Baird, among others.\n\nActress Greta Gerwig covered \"There's a Rugged Road\" in the 2010 Noah Baumbach film, \"Greenberg\".\n\nIn November 2016, in conjunction with Record Store Day, the Fruit Bats released \"The Glory of the Fruit Bats\", a limited edition LP comprising previously unreleased originals, select covers, and cinematic instrumentals, including a cover of \"My Man on Love\" from Sill's 1971 debut album.\n\n\n"}

Its taxonomy is highly complex and a matter of dispute, with some splitting it into two or three species: Falkland skua (\"S. antarcticus\"), Tristan skua (\"S. hamiltoni\"), and subantarctic skua (\"S. lönnbergi\"). To further confuse, it hybridizes with both the south polar and Chilean skuas, and the entire group has been considered to be a subspecies of the great skua, a species otherwise restricted to the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nIt feeds on fish (often via kleptoparasitism), penguin chicks and other seabirds, small mammals, eggs and carrion.\n\nThis is the heaviest species of skua and rivals the largest gulls, the great black-backed gull and glaucous gull, as the heaviest species in the shorebird order although not as large in length or wingspan. It is in length, in wingspan and has a body mass of . \"S. a. hamiltoni\" measured on Gough Island, weighed an average of in 9 males and in 9 females. \"S. a. lonnbergi\" measured in the Chatham Islands weighed an average of in 30 males and an average of in 32 females.

Their sound is diverse with quiet instrumental jazz influenced sections and aggressive black metal blast beats and vocals. Ved Buens Ende means \"By the end of the bow\" referring to the mythological rainbow Bifröst.\n\nVed Buens Ende was formed in Oslo in 1993 by the drummer Carl-Michael Eide and guitarist Vicotnik, who were then joined by bassist Skoll. Prior to this, Carl-Michael Eide had been playing in Ulver and Vicotnik in his own project Manes which eventually became Ved Buens Ende, not to be confused with other Norwegian band Manes, known as Perifa, and later, Manii. They were signed to the British label Misanthropy Records. The band was unique by their mixture of many unusual musical elements for Metal, such as atonality and dissonance, a very prominent bass sound as well as Eide's crooning and Vicotnik's characteristic shrieks.\n\nThe band split up in 1997, after releasing only one full-length album, \"Written in Waters\".\n\nOn 26 April 2006, Blabbermouth.net announced that Ved Buens Ende had reformed, and were working on new material.\n\nAlong with Vicotnik and Carl-Michael Eide, who now plays guitar instead of drums, there are two new members; Petter \"Plenum\" Berntsen on bass and Einar \"Esso\" Sjursø on drums. They are also members of Carl-Michael Eide's band Virus. Many fans of the band were surprised by the absence of Hugh Mingay (aka Skoll), whose place was taken by Petter Berntsen.\n\nThe band's drummer, Einar Sjursø, had this to say about the band on Blabbermouth.net:\n\"We will record a new album this year, to be released in 2007 by an as-yet-undetermined label (interested parties get in touch) and we also aim at playing live, where we will perform material both from 'Written In Waters' and the [post-VED BUENS ENDE project] VIRUS 'Carheart' album plus of course new compositions. The new material is being developed at the moment and will differ from both 'Written In Waters' and 'Carheart' yet still retain the trademark off the wall guitar sounds of those releases.\"\n\nThe band broke up again in early 2007, without having released another album. Several songs intended for this album ultimately appeared on Virus' \"The Black Flux\".\n\nAs of 2019, they have reunited again. The current lineup is Skoll on bass, Carl-Michael Eide on guitars/clean vocals, Vicotnik on guitars/harsh vocals, and Øyvind Myrvoll on drums.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1847135", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1847135", "title": "Eugen Richter", "text": "Eugen Richter\n\nEugen Richter (30 July 183810 March 1906) was a German politician and journalist in Imperial Germany. He was one of the leading advocates of liberalism in the Prussian Landtag and the German Reichstag.\n\nSon of a combat medic, Richter attended the Gymnasium in his home town of Düsseldorf. In 1856 he began to study Law and Economics, first at the University of Bonn, and later at the Berlin and Heidelberg. He obtained a law degree in 1859. Richter became a strong advocate of free trade, a market economy, and a Rechtsstaat; views he held for all his life. In 1859 he became a civil servant in the judiciary. He achieved some renown for his essay \"Über die Freiheit des Schankgewerbes\" (On the liberty of the tavern trade). His liberal views caused some trouble with the Prussian bureaucracy. In 1864 he was elected the mayor of Neuwied, but the president of the provincial government refused to confirm his election result. Richter left the civil service, and became the parliamentary correspondent of the \"Elberfelder Zeitung\" in Berlin. In 1867 he entered the Reichstag, and after 1869 also became a member of the Prussian Lower House.\n\nHe became the leader of the German Progress Party (Deutsche Fortschrittspartei), after 1884 the German Freeminded Party (Deutsche Freisinnige Partei), after 1893 the Freeminded People's Party (Freisinnige Volkspartei), and was one of the leading critics of the policies of Otto von Bismarck. Richter opposed the Anti-Socialist Laws of 1878 that banned the Social Democratic Party. He said: \"I fear Social-Democracy more under this law than without it\". In response to rumours that Bismarck was planning to introduce a tobacco monopoly, Richter unsuccessfully sought to persuade the Reichstag to pass a resolution that condemned such a monopoly as \"economically, financially, and politically unjustifiable\". When Bismarck proposed a system of social insurance that was to be paid for by the state, Richter denounced it as \"not Socialistic, but Communistic\". From 1885 to 1904 he was the chief editor of the liberal newspaper \"Freisinnige Zeitung\".\n\nHis novel \"Pictures of the Socialistic Future\" (1891) is a dystopian novel which predicts what would happen to Germany if the socialism espoused by the trade unionists, social democrats, and Marxists was put into practice. It is a 19th-century version of George Orwell's 1984. He aims to show that government ownership of the means of production and central planning of the economy would lead to shortages, not abundance as the socialists claimed. He seeks to draw attention to the problem of incentives in the absence of profits, and the public choice vested interests of bureaucrats and politicians. He also focuses on the connection between economic and political liberty. Written in the form of a diary by a supporter of the socialist revolution who comes to see the horrors he has wrought, the narrator begins by applauding expropriation, the use of force to prevent emigration, and the reassignment of people to new tasks, all the while assuring doubters that paradise is just around the corner. At one point he asks rhetorically: \"What is freedom of the press if the government owns all the presses? What is freedom of religion if the government owns all the houses of worship?\" highlighting the abuse of power possible when these are owned by the state. Society however begins to deteriorate as shortages begin to occur, the wealth generated by capitalism declines, while the military and the police forces grow. His work has been described as \"prophetic\" of what socialism (in Germany and elsewhere) would mean practically, with the protagonist (a committed socialist) still justifying every abuse to himself throughout the novel even as every goal of the socialists' fails.\n\nAnti-semitism was prevalent in the 1870s in Germany, but when the historian Heinrich von Treitschke and the Court Preacher Adolph Stöcker endorsed it in 1879, what had been a fringe phenomenon gained national attention. Various newspapers (such as the \"Berliner Antisemitismusstreit\") published articles attacking Jews. A petition to the Reich Chancellor Otto von Bismarck called for administrative measures banning Jewish immigration, and restricting their access to positions in education and the judiciary ().\n\nAlthough anti-semitism was opposed by Eugen Richter's Progress Party and some National Liberals led by Theodor Mommsen and Heinrich Rickert (father of the philosopher Heinrich Rickert), other National Liberals, and the other parties — Conservatives, Center Party, and Socialists — mostly either stayed aloof or flirted with anti-semitism. In November 1880, a declaration by 75 leading scientists, businessmen, and politicians was published in major newspapers condemning anti-semitism (\"Notabeln-Erklärung\"). It was signed by among others the Mayor of Berlin Max von Forckenbeck, the anthropologist Rudolf Virchow, the historian Theodor Mommsen, and the entrepreneur and inventor Werner Siemens (founder of Siemens AG).\n\nOn 20 November 1880 the Progress Party brought the issue before the Prussian Landtag, asking the government to take a stand on whether or not legal restrictions were to be introduced (\"Interpellation Hänel\"). The government confirmed that the legal status of Jews was not to be altered, but fell short of condemning anti-semitism. Rudolf Virchow complained in the ensuing debate:\nWhile on the first day of the debate a consensus seemed to emerge against the anti-semitic movement, on the second day, November 22, 1880 some politicians began to declare their anti-semitism. In his speech, Eugen Richter predicted the eventual consequences of the anti-semitic movement:\n\nHe concluded his speech with the words:\n\nResponding to an anti-semitic meeting on 17 December 1880, the Progress Party invited all electors for the Prussian Landtag to a meeting in the Reichshallen on 12 January 1881 to demonstrate that the citizens of Berlin did not support anti-semitism. Eugen Richter delivered a speech before an audience of 2.500 electors, attacking anti-semitic university students:\n\nHe turned the anti-semitic accusations around:\n\nAlready in February 1880, the German Crown Prince and latter Emperor Frederick III had called the anti-semitic movement in a private conversation with the president of the Jewish corporation of Berlin, Meyer Magnus, \"a disgrace for Germany\" (in some reports also \"a disgrace of our time\" or \"a disgrace for our nation\"). Eugen Richter referred to these words, which the Crown Prince confirmed two days later:\n\nHe rejected the claim that the anti-semitic movement had grown from the ranks of craftsmen, workers, and businessmen:\n\nIn his concluding words, he called upon his audience:\n\nOn 27 October 1881 the Progress Party defeated the anti-semitic \"Berliner Bewegung\" (Berlin Movement), winning all six seats for the capital, with Eugen Richter gaining 66% of the vote in the first round.\n\n\n"}

Presently the only official Triple Tiara is the three race series in New York; they are: The Acorn Stakes, run at Belmont Park at a distance of 1 mile, The Coaching Club American Oaks, run at Saratoga Race Course at a distance of 1⅛ miles and The Alabama Stakes, also run at Saratoga at a distance of 1¼ miles.\n\nThere have been attempts to develop a \"Filly Triple Crown\" or a Triple Tiara for fillies only, but no set series of three races consistently remained in the public eye. At least four different configurations of races have been designated as such. Two fillies won the series of the Kentucky Oaks, the Pimlico Oaks (now the Black-Eyed Susan Stakes), and the Coaching Club American Oaks, in 1949 and 1952, but the racing press did not designate either accomplishment as a \"triple crown.\" The New York Racing Association designated three of its races as a filly triple crown of sorts, but the races so designated changed over the years. Eight fillies won variations of the NYRA Triple Tiara between 1968 and 1993.\n\nThe original Triple Tiara consisted of three races at Belmont Park: the 1 mile Acorn Stakes, the 1⅛ mile Mother Goose Stakes and the Coaching Club American Oaks, which varied in distance between 1¼ and 1½ miles.\n\nEight horses have won the series under this system:\n\n\n\nIn 2003, the Triple Tiara was reconfigured for a time to consist of the Mother Goose Stakes, Coaching Club American Oaks, and the Alabama Stakes, a 1¼ mile race held in August at Saratoga Race Course in Saratoga Springs, New York.\nThe New York Racing Association, the operator of Belmont Park and Saratoga Race Course, once offered a $2 million bonus to any filly that swept the three races. The bonus was discontinued in 2005. In 2007 the New York Racing Association reverted to the original three races of the tiara; the Acorn, Mother Goose and Coaching Club American Oaks. No filly swept this reconfigured series.\n\nThe Triple Tiara is now a set of three horse races in New York which is open to three-year-old fillies. The three races that compose the series now are The Acorn Stakes, run at Belmont Park at a distance of 1 mile, The Coaching Club American Oaks, run at Saratoga Race Course at a distance of 1⅛ miles and The Alabama Stakes, also run at Saratoga at a distance of 1¼ miles. The current race system was implemented in 2010 by the New York Racing Association and the series is sponsored by Betfair and TVG. No filly has swept this reconfigured series.\n\nIn recent years, many owners and trainers of fillies have submitted proposals to the National Thoroughbred Racing Association to change the three races that compose the Triple Tiara. Although a great deal of prestige is attached to winning one or more of the current Triple Tiara races, all three are held in New York; because of this, the series is skewed to fillies that race in the northeast. Some from outside the area even modify the name of the series by calling it the \"New York Triple Tiara.\"\n\nSeveral options of races have been suggested to compose the \"National Triple Tiara.\" The most popular proposal of a \"National Triple Tiara\" are three races that are on the undercard of the three Triple Crown races. The Kentucky Oaks, run at Churchill Downs in Louisville; the Black-Eyed Susan Stakes, run at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore; and the Acorn Stakes, run at Belmont Park. These three races are run on the same or similar date, and on the same racetrack, as the three races in the Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing. \n\nA second proposal has been to use the Kentucky Oaks, the Black-Eyed Susan Stakes and the Mother Goose Stakes. This version would allow more time for fillies to recuperate between races. Using the Mother Goose would also allow the New York Racing Association to keep the New York Triple Tiara (the Acorn Stakes, the Coaching Club American Oaks, and the Alabama Stakes) in place without interfering with the three National races.\n\n\nA prime reason for favouring the National Triple Tiara is that the Kentucky Oaks is the most popular races for fillies and draws one of the biggest crowds of any stakes races throughout the year (behind only the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes). The Kentucky Oaks consistently outdraws the Belmont Stakes, the Travers Stakes and the Breeders' Cup series. On the other hand, the Black-Eyed Susan is currently only a Grade II race as few modern trainers are willing to race their fillies with only two weeks rest after the Kentucky Oaks.\n\n"}

Scripps\n\nEdward Willis Scripps (June 18, 1854 – March 12, 1926), was an American newspaper publisher and, together with his sister Ellen Browning Scripps, founder of The E. W. Scripps Company, a diversified media conglomerate, and United Press news service. It became United Press International (UPI) when International News Service (INS) merged with United Press in 1958. The E. W. Scripps School of Journalism at Ohio University is named for him.\n\nE. W. Scripps was born and raised in Rushville, Illinois, to James Mogg Scripps from London, and Julia Adeline Osborne (third wife) from New York. E. W. was the youngest of five children born to James and Julia. James had seven children from previous marriages.\n\nE. W., as with many businessmen of his day, went by his initials rather than writing out his first and middle name. He often signed his middle name as \"Wyllis\".\n\nE. W. was a prolific consumer of whisky and cigars, according to his confidential assistant Gilson Gardner, and was said to drink a gallon (3.79 l) each day while bearing a lit cigar at all waking hours.\n\nBoth E. W. and his half-sister Ellen worked with his older half-brother, James when he founded \"The Detroit News\" in 1873. E. W. started as an office boy at the paper. In 1878, with loans from his half-brothers, E. W. went on to found \"The Penny Press\" (later the \"Cleveland Press\") in Cleveland. With financial support from sister Ellen, he went on to begin or acquire some 25 newspapers. This was the beginning of a media empire that is now the E. W. Scripps Company.\n\nE. W. would lend money to promising young, local newspaper publishers, and buy the most successful one, having 51% share of the paper. Once bought, he did not \"sell out,\" but held on to the paper. A guiding tenet of E. W. was that local editors know best about running local newspapers. Editors were carefully groomed and given considerable autonomy. Among the innovations E. W. made were distributing newspapers to the suburbs and, with his brother James, of getting the bulk of income from advertisers instead of subscribers.\n\nIn 1907, Scripps created United Press Associations, now United Press International (UPI), from smaller regional news services. Scripps later said \"I regard my life's greatest service to the people of this country to be the creation of the United Press\", to provide competition to the Associated Press.\n\nScripps believed in editorial independence, stating,\n\nIn 1898, he finished building a home in San Diego, where his half-sister lived nearby, thinking that the dry, warm climate would help his allergic rhinitis that he had all his life. He built it as a winter home to escape the cold of West Chester, (Butler County), Ohio but eventually lived there year-round, and conducted his newspaper business from the ranch. His ranch encompassed what is today the community of Scripps Ranch as well as Marine Corps Air Station Miramar.\n\nIn 1903, he and his half-sister Ellen were the founding donors of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Initially Scripps was reluctant to support the venture, thinking scientists could not be businesslike. However, he developed a deep friendship with the scientific director, William Emerson Ritter, and together they began to plan projects for the Institute. As the Institute started to succeed, he became an enthusiastic supporter, and took a great interest in its work. William Randolph Hearst and Scripps were often at loggerheads as to who owned the better newspaper conglomerate.\n\nIn 1921, Scripps founded \"Science Service\", now named the Society for Science & the Public, with the goal of keeping the public informed of scientific achievements. The organization continues to run as a non-profit dedicated to the promotion of science. Scripps College is also named in his step sister, Ellen Browning Scripps', honor, because a large part of its endowment derives from the media fortune they had built About Scripps College.\n\nScripps died at the age of 71 on March 12, 1926. As requested, his body was buried at sea by being dumped overboard from his yacht. Among his descendants was Samuel H. Scripps (1927 – 2007), grandson, who became a leading philanthropist for theater and dance in America in the late 20th century.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1847149", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1847149", "title": "Johann Baptist Wanhal", "text": "Johann Baptist Wanhal\n\nJohann Baptist Wanhal (12 May 1739 – 20 August 1813) was a Czech classical music composer. He was born in Nechanice, Bohemia, and died in Vienna. His music was well respected by Mozart, Haydn and Beethoven. He was an instrumental performer as well. While being a prolific Organist, he also played the Violin and Cello.\n\nWanhal and at least one of his publishers used the spelling Waṅhal, the dot being an archaic form of the modern háček. Other attested variants include Wanhall, Vanhal and Van Hall. The modern Czech form Jan Křtitel Vaňhal was introduced in the 20th century.\n\nWanhal was born in Nechanice, Bohemia, into serfdom in a Czech peasant family. He received his first musical training from his family and local musicians, excelling at the violin and organ from an early age. From these humble beginnings he was able to earn a living as a village organist and choirmaster. He was also taught German from an early age, as this was required for someone wishing to make a career in music within the Habsburg empire.\n\nBy the age of 21 Wanhal must have been well under way to become a skilled performer and composer, as his patron, the Countess Schaffgotsch, took him to Vienna as part of her personal train in 1760. There he quickly established himself as a teacher of singing, violin and piano to the high nobility, and he was invited to conduct his symphonies for illustrious patrons such as the Erdődy families and Baron Isaac von Riesch of Dresden. During the years 1762–63, he is supposed to have been the student of Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf, even though they were born the same year. Baron Riesch sponsored a trip to Italy in 1769, so that Wanhal could learn the Italian style of composition, which was very much in fashion. To return the favour, Wanhal was supposed to become Riesch's Kapellmeister.\n\nThe details of Wanhal's journey to Italy are scant, but it is known that he met his fellow Bohemians Gluck and Florian Gassmann in Venice and Rome respectively. The Italian journeys present the only knowledge we have of Wanhal writing operas: He is supposed either to have written operas over the Metastasian operas Il Trionfo di Clelia and Demofonte, either by himself, or as a cooperation with Gassmann, where Wanhal supplied some or all of the arias; these works have been lost. In additions to his documented travels in northern and central Italy, Wanhal was supposed to travel to Naples – arguably the most important centre of music in Italy at the time – but never seems to have gotten there.\n\nAfter his journey to Italy, Wanhal returned to Vienna rather than to go to Riesch in Dresden. Claims have been made that Wanhal became heavily depressed or even insane, but these claims are likely to have been overstated. During this period he is supposed to have acted occasionally as a de facto Kapellmeister for Count Erdődy in Varaždin, although the small number of compositions by him remaining there suggests that this was not the full-time role that would have been expected if he had worked with Riesch; Vanhal might have preferred such employment with the Count precisely because of its part-time nature. There is no evidence of visits after 1779.\n\nAround 1780, Wanhal stopped writing symphonies and string quartets, focusing instead on music for piano and small-scale chamber ensembles, masses and other church music. The former, written for a growing middle class, supplied him with the means to live a modest, economically independent life; for the last 30 years of his life he did not work under any patron, probably being the first Viennese composer to do so. During these years, more than 270 of his works were published by Viennese printers. In the 1780s he was still an active participant in Viennese musical life. In 1782 he met Mozart, who admired Wanhal's Symphonies. He enjoyed playing music with Mozart and some of his friends who were composers, as testified in Michael Kelly's account of the string quartet Wanhal played in together with Haydn, Mozart and Dittersdorf in 1784. After 1787 or so, however, he seems to have ceased performing in public, but he nevertheless was economically secure, living in good quarters near St. Stephen's Cathedral. He died in 1813, an elderly composer whose music was still recognized by the Viennese public. \n\nHe learned to play the Organ from his teacher Anton Erban, who was one of his most prized mentors. He spent the first two decades of his life training to play both string and wind instruments, and to sing as well.\n\nJohann Baptist Wanhal died having never having married and never had any children. His life was rather long and lacked stress.\n\nWanhal had to be a prolific writer to meet the demands made upon him, and attributed to him are 100 quartets, at least 73 symphonies, 95 sacred works, and a large number of instrumental and vocal works. The symphonies, in particular, have been committed increasingly often to compact disc in recent times, and the best of them are comparable with many of Haydn's. Many of Wanhal's symphonies are in minor keys and are considered highly influential to the \"Sturm und Drang\" movement of his time. \"[Wanhal] makes use of repeated semiquavers, pounding quavers in the bass line, wide skips in the themes, sudden pauses (fermatas), silences, exaggerated dynamic marks ... and all these features ... appear in Mozart's first large-scale \"Sturm und Drang\" symphony, no. 25 in g minor (K. 183) of 1773.\" This kind of style also appears in Joseph Haydn's Symphony No. 83 in g minor, The Hen (1785), and\nMuzio Clementi's Sonata in g minor, Op.34, No.2 (circa 1795).\n\nAround 1780 Wanhal seems to have stopped writing large-scale instrumental music, and rather contented himself with writing piano music for the growing middle class, and church music. In the former category his programmatic pieces, often related to recent events such as \"the Battle of Würzburg\", \"the Battle of Abukir\", and \"the Return of Francis II in 1809\". Judging from the number of extant manuscripts available, these works must have been highly popular.\nWanhal was also the most prolific writer of Masses and other Catholic church music of his generation in Vienna. Despite this, it appears that he was never in the employ of any religious institution. This means that his late Masses are both testaments to a genuine personal faith, and evidence of how lucrative his focus on incidental piano music must have been.\n\nRobert O. Gjerdingen sees a change in Wanhal's style as he redirected his attention towards the middle class, his music becoming didactic in the sense that it employed musical figures in a clear and self-referential manner, rather than the seamless continuity from figure to figure that had characterized his earlier pieces. In this, Gjerdingen sees Wanhal as prefiguring Beethoven.\n\nSuch was his success that within a few years of his symphonies being written, they were being performed around the world, and as far distant as the United States. In later life, however, he rarely moved from Vienna, where he was also an active teacher.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1847150", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1847150", "title": "Ice Ice Baby", "text": "Ice Ice Baby\n\n\"Ice Ice Baby\" is a hip hop song written by American rapper Vanilla Ice, K. Kennedy, and DJ Earthquake. It was based on the bassline of \"Under Pressure\" by Queen and David Bowie, who did not receive songwriting credit or royalties until after it had become a hit. Released on his debut album, \"To the Extreme\", it is his best known song. It has appeared in remixed form on \"Platinum Underground\" and \"Vanilla Ice Is Back!\" A live version appears on the album \"Extremely Live\", while a nu metal version appears on the album \"Hard to Swallow\", under the title \"Too Cold\".\n\n\"Ice Ice Baby\" was first released as the B-side to Vanilla Ice's cover of \"Play That Funky Music\", but the single was not initially successful. When disc jockey David Morales played \"Ice Ice Baby\" instead, it began to gain success. \"Ice Ice Baby\" was the first hip hop single to top the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. Outside the United States, the song topped the charts in Australia, Belgium, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Ireland and the United Kingdom, thus helping the song diversify hip hop by introducing it to a mainstream audience. It was also used in \"Smallfoot\" and in the first trailer for \"The Angry Birds Movie 2\".\n\nRobert Van Winkle, better known by his stage name Vanilla Ice, wrote \"Ice Ice Baby\" in 1983 at the age of 16, basing its lyrics upon his experiences in South Florida. The lyrics describe a shooting and Van Winkle's rhyming skills. The chorus of \"Ice Ice Baby\" originates from the signature chant of the national African American fraternity Alpha Phi Alpha. Of the song's lyrics, Van Winkle stated in a 2001 interview that \"If you released 'Ice Ice Baby' today, it would fit in today's lyrical respect among peers, you know what I'm sayin'? [...] My lyrics aren't, 'Pump it up, go! Go!' At least I'm sayin' somethin'.\"\n\nThe song's hook samples the bassline of the 1981 song \"Under Pressure\" by Queen and David Bowie, who did not receive credit or royalties for the sample. In a 1990 interview, Van Winkle claimed the two melodies were slightly different because he had added an additional note on the \"and\" of the fourth beat, an anacrusis (\"pickup\") between odd-numbered and subsequent even-numbered iterations of the \"Under Pressure\" sample. In later interviews, Van Winkle readily admitted he sampled the song and claimed his 1990 statement was a joke; others, however, suggested he had been serious. After representatives for Queen and Bowie threatened a copyright infringement suit against him, the matter was settled out of court, with Van Winkle being required to pay financial recompense to the original artists. Bowie and all members of Queen were also given songwriting credit for the sample.\n\nIn December 1990, Van Winkle told British youth music magazine \"Smash Hits\" where he came up with the idea of sampling \"Under Pressure\":\n\nVan Winkle described himself as the first rapper to cross into the pop market and said that although his pioneer status forced him to \"take the heat for a lot of people\" for his music's use of samples, the criticism he received over sample use allowed sampling to become acceptable in mainstream hip hop.\n\n\"Ice Ice Baby\" was initially released by Ichiban Records as the B-side to Van Winkle's cover of \"Play That Funky Music\". The 12-inch single featured the radio, instrumental and a cappella versions of \"Play That Funky Music\" and the radio version and \"Miami Drop\" remix of \"Ice Ice Baby\". When a disc jockey named David Morales played \"Ice Ice Baby\" instead of the single's A-side, the song gained more success than \"Play That Funky Music\". A music video for \"Ice Ice Baby\" was produced for $8000. The video was financed by Van Winkle's manager, Tommy Quon, and shot on the roof of a warehouse in Dallas, Texas. In the video, Van Winkle is shown rapping the lyrics while he and others dance to the song. Heavy airplay of the video by The Box while Van Winkle was still unknown increased public interest in the song. \"Ice Ice Baby\" was given its own single, released in 1990 by SBK Records in the United States, and EMI Records in the United Kingdom. The SBK single contained the \"Miami Drop\", instrumental and radio mixes of \"Ice Ice Baby\" and the album version of \"It's A Party\". The EMI single contained the club and radio mixes of the song, and the shortened radio edit. The single was quickly pulled from the American market soon after the song reached number one, in a successful attempt to drive consumers to buy the album instead.\n\n\"Ice Ice Baby\" garnered critical acclaim, and was the first hip hop single to top the \"Billboard\" charts. It has been credited for helping diversify hip hop by introducing it to a mainstream audience.\n\n\"Entertainment Weekly\" reviewer Mim Udovitch wrote that \"[Vanilla Ice] probably would have scored with his hit rap single 'Ice Ice Baby' even if he hadn't been white. There's just something about the way its hook – a sample from Queen and David Bowie's 'Under Pressure' — grabs you and flings you out onto the dance floor.\" \"The Network Forty\" wrote that \"like Mellow Man Ace, the rap melts slowly and is as much a mood piece as it is a cruising tune. A motocross champion from Dallas via Miami, the 22-year-old Ice says it's time to chill out.\"\n\nFollowing the song's success, California rapper Mario \"Chocolate\" Johnson, an associate of record producer Suge Knight, claimed that he had helped in writing the song, and had not received credit or royalties. Knight and two bodyguards arrived at The Palm in West Hollywood, where Van Winkle was eating. After shoving Van Winkle's bodyguards aside, Knight and his own bodyguards sat down in front of Van Winkle, staring at him before finally asking \"How you doin'?\" Similar incidents were repeated on several occasions before Knight showed up at Van Winkle's suite on the fifteenth floor of the Bel Age Hotel, accompanied by Johnson and a member of the Los Angeles Raiders. According to Van Winkle, Knight took him out on the balcony by himself, and implied that he would throw Van Winkle off unless he signed the rights to the song over to Knight.\n\nAfter audiences began to view Van Winkle as a novelty act and a pop star rather than a legitimate rapper, his popularity began to decline. Detroit-based rapper Eminem states that when he first heard \"Ice Ice Baby\", \"I felt like I didn't want to rap anymore. I was so mad, because he was making it real hard for me.\" Van Winkle lost some credibility among hip hop fans, but later began to regain some success, attracting a new audience outside of the mainstream audience that had formerly accepted him and then rejected him. \"Ice Ice Baby\" continues to be the song that Van Winkle is best known for internationally, although Van Winkle states that his American fans like his newer music better.\n\nAccording to \"Rolling Stone\", the \"Ice Ice Baby\"–\"Under Pressure\" controversy is a landmark music copyright case, since it \"sparked discussion about the punitive actions taken in plagiarism cases\". The magazine's Jordan Runtagh added: \"Though [Vanilla Ice] paid the price, some argue that isn't enough to make up for the potential credibility lost by Queen and David Bowie, who are now linked to him through a collaboration they had no choice in joining.\"<ref name=\"Runtagh/RollingStone\"></ref>\n\nA live version of the song appeared on the album \"Extremely Live\". \"Ice Ice Baby\" was rerecorded in a nu metal version titled \"Too Cold\". Originally intended to be released as a hidden track or B-side, \"Too Cold\" was featured on Van Winkle's 1998 album \"Hard to Swallow\", and became a radio hit in some markets. In 2000, a remix titled \"Ice Ice Baby 2001\" was released in Europe as a single, with a newly produced music video. The remix generated new international interest in Van Winkle's music.\n\nVH1 and \"Blender\" ranked \"Ice Ice Baby\" fifth on its list of the \"50 Most Awesomely Bad Songs Ever\". It was also given the distinction by the \"Houston Press\" as being the worst song ever to emanate from Texas. In 1999, the song's music video was \"retired\" on the MTV special \"25 Lame\", in which Van Winkle himself appeared to destroy the video's master tape. Given a baseball bat, Van Winkle ended up destroying the show's set. However, in December 2007, VH1 ranked the song in 29th place of their 100 Greatest Songs of the 90's.\n\nIn November 2011 \"MTV Dance\" ranked \"Ice Ice Baby\" at No. 71 in their list of \"The 100 Biggest 90's Dance Anthems Of All Time\".\n\nIn 1991, Alvin and the Chipmunks released a cover version entitled \"Ice Ice Alvin\" for their album \"The Chipmunks Rock the House\". \"Weird Al\" Yankovic included the chorus as the final song in \"Polka Your Eyes Out\", the polka medley from his 1992 album \"Off the Deep End\". In 2004, the song was featured in the \"13 Going on 30\" in the movie. In 2010, the song was featured in the \"Glee\" episode \"Bad Reputation\" as performed by Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1847159", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1847159", "title": "Hank Henshaw", "text": "Hank Henshaw\n\nHank Henshaw is a fictional supervillain featured in the DC Comics universe, who normally goes by the name Cyborg Superman. While originally featured primarily as an enemy of Superman, he has in recent years also been an enemy of the Green Lantern Corps.\n\nAt times, he is also referred to as \"The Cyborg\" (not to be confused with Victor Stone a.k.a. Cyborg from Teen Titans).\n\nWhile the character debuted in \"The Adventures of Superman\" #465 (May 1990) and was created by Dan Jurgens, he was reintroduced as the original Cyborg Superman during the \"Reign of the Supermen\" storyline following Superman's death.\n\nHank Henshaw first appeared as a crew member on board the doomed NASA Space Shuttle \"Excalibur\" in \"Superman\" (vol. 2) #42, and Henshaw and the other crew members were next seen in \"Adventures of Superman\" #465.\n\nHank and the other three members of the \"Excalibur\" crew, including his wife Terri, are part of a radiation experiment designed by LexCorp that is affected by a solar flare, causing their shuttle to crash. As a result of their radiation exposure, the human bodies of two crew members were destroyed. However, their minds survived and they were able to construct new bodies out of cosmic radiation and bits of earth and wreckage from the shuttle, respectively. Initially, Henshaw and his wife suffer no ill effects from the radiation (though Hank's hair turns white), and the crew travels to Metropolis in the hopes of using LexCorp facilities to cure their mutated crewmates. During a brief battle with Superman, one crew member, now composed of radiation, becomes unhinged and flies into the Sun, destroying himself. By this time, Henshaw's body has started to rapidly decay, while his wife is beginning to phase into an alternate dimension. With Superman's help, Henshaw is able to use the LexCorp facilities to save Terri. The remaining member of the shuttle crew commits suicide, using an MRI booth to tear apart the metallic components of his body.\n\nThough Henshaw's physical body expired, he was able to transfer his consciousness into the LexCorp mainframe. Now able to control technology, Henshaw appears to his wife in a robotic body. The shock of this bizarre rebirth is too much for Terri to bear and in a fit of insanity, she jumps to her death. By this point, Henshaw's electronic consciousness has begun to disrupt Earth's communications networks. Using NASA communications equipment, Henshaw beams his mind into the birthing matrix which had carried Superman from Krypton to Earth as an infant. He creates a small exploration craft from the birthing matrix and departs into outer space alone.\n\nHenshaw spends some time traveling between planets, bonding with local lifeforms to learn about the culture and history of various worlds. Henshaw comes to believe that Superman was responsible for the tragedy of the \"Excalibur\" after learning that around the time of the accident, the Man of Steel had thrown a rogue Kryptonian artificial intelligence (the Eradicator) into the Sun. Henshaw believes that this created the solar flare that resulted in the \"Excalibur\" crew's transformations (although Superman had shared this concern with Terri after he had saved her life and she had confirmed that the flares would have been triggered \"before\" Superman disposed of the Eradicator). Over time, Henshaw becomes delusional and paranoid, believing that the Man of Steel had intentionally caused the deaths of himself, his wife, and his crew, then driven him from Earth. Arriving on a planet controlled by alien overlord and Superman foe Mongul, Henshaw learns of Warworld and forcibly recruits Mongul as part of a plan for revenge against Superman.\n\nWith Superman apparently dead after his battle with Doomsday, Henshaw decides to pose as him in order to destroy his reputation. To that end, the Cyborg claims to be Superman reborn, the result of the hero's body being pieced together and revived with technology. The Cyborg then uses knowledge obtained from Superman's birthing matrix to construct a body that is genetically identical to Superman's. When analyzed closely by Professor Hamilton, the Cyborg passes for the real thing, due to components within himself that include Kryptonian alloys, combined with the fact that the replaced body parts correspond with those parts of the original Superman's body that were most severely injured in his fight with Doomsday.\n\nAfter destroying a Superman memorial plaque in front of the \"Daily Planet\", the Cyborg exiles Doomsday into space, prevents a nuclear meltdown, and saves the President of the United States from an assassination attempt. The White House then endorses the Cyborg as the 'true' Superman. When confronted by Lois Lane, the Cyborg claims his memory is \"blurry\", but he can see a \"spaceship on a farm and the name Kent\", suggesting that Henshaw may be aware of Superman's secret identity.\n\nHenshaw's arrival as Superman is simultaneous with that of three others: John Henry Irons (the self-styled Man of Steel), the Eradicator (the self-styled Last Son of Krypton), and the modern Superboy. The endorsement of the President ensures that the Cyborg eclipses the rest of the heroes claiming to be Superman's heir. During this time, two cults spring up in anticipation of Superman's return from the dead: one that deifies the Eradicator and another that venerates the Cyborg. Supporters of both eventually come to blows over which is the real Superman.\n\nWhen an alien ship appears over Coast City, the Cyborg attacks and severely injures the Eradicator, allowing Mongul's craft to destroy the city. The Cyborg also murders an entire family of vacationers trying to find a way out of the devastated area. The Cyborg was then able to convince the White House and the public that the Eradicator was responsible. After tricking and defeating Superboy, Henshaw prepares to launch a nuclear warhead intended to convert Metropolis into a second Engine City.\n\nSuperboy is able to escape and warn John Henry Irons, Supergirl, and the resurrected (but powerless) original Superman of the Cyborg's plans. The quartet travels to the site of the former Coast City, and Superman (whose powers are slowly returning), Supergirl, and Steel confront Mongul and the Cyborg, while Superboy stops the missile from hitting Metropolis. While Green Lantern defeats Mongul, the Cyborg lures Superman and the Eradicator to the Engine City main reactor and attempts to kill Superman with the kryptonite that powers the engine. When Henshaw tries to kill Superman with a concentrated blast of kryptonite radiation, the Eradicator intercepts the blast at the expense of his own life. As the kryptonite energy passes through the Eradicator, the radiation is altered and acts to fully restore Superman's powers. Superman is then able to easily defeat the already weakened Cyborg by sticking his arm through Henshaw's chest, killing him and shattering his body. When Henshaw panics and states that he will \"somehow\" find a way to come back, a doubting Superman simply says that if Henshaw does, he will be waiting.\n\nIt was later revealed that Henshaw chose to attack Coast City first because he and his late wife were former residents. This was part of an effort to erase his former life.\n\nBefore exiling Doomsday into space, Henshaw had installed a device on the monster to allow him to detect if Doomsday were to ever escape. After the destruction of his Cyborg Superman form, Henshaw transfers his consciousness into this device as Doomsday is \"the safest place in the galaxy\" for the Cyborg to hide. Doomsday is brought on board a space cruiser and, despite frantic efforts of the crew to jettison him, kills the crew, and upon landing on Apokolips, proceeds to pillage the planet.\nWhen Superman, his power now boosted by being repowered by \"purple kryptonite\", arrives; Henshaw emerges by reconfiguring an armored Apokoliptian trooper, brutally murdered by Doomsday, into a new body (which, by all accounts, had its DNA overwritten with the Kryptonian DNA Henshaw had obtained while in Superman's birthing matrix, and thus still retains a portion of Superman's abilities and still looks the way the Cyborg Superman looked, except for a change in the color of the Cyborg's metallic components) and proceeds to lay siege to the planet alongside Doomsday. The Cyborg successfully takes over most of Apokolips but is captured by Darkseid's Omega Beams during a battle with Superman.\n\nDarkseid did not kill the Cyborg; rather, the Omega Effect captured Henshaw in a small orb, with Darkseid planning to use the Cyborg against Superman at a later date. Darkseid eventually frees Henshaw with the understanding that Henshaw is to leave Apokolips and never return.\n\nThe Cyborg eventually aligns himself with an intergalactic Tribunal which is seeking to bring Superman to trial for the crimes of his ancestors. Henshaw assists the Tribunal in capturing the Eradicator, Superboy, Supergirl, Steel, and Alpha Centurion, who had intended to rescue Superman. However, the Cyborg betrayed the Tribunal and attempted to conquer their planet for conversion into a new Warworld. Superman and his allies stop the Cyborg's plan and, when Henshaw's involvement in the destruction of Coast City is brought to the attention of the Tribunal, they find him guilty of genocide and sentence him to death. As an electronic consciousness, Henshaw cannot be killed by normal means and is transported beyond the event horizon of a black hole, where not even light can escape from the gravity.\n\nRather than being destroyed, the Cyborg is transported (unknowingly by another villain, Thanos) to a Marvel Multiverse dimension designated as 616, as seen at the beginning of the \"Green Lantern/Silver Surfer: Unholy Alliances\" crossover one-shot issue. The Cyborg destroys a planet in another attempt to recreate Warworld, attracting the attention of the Silver Surfer. Their short battle is interrupted by the arrival of Parallax, who has been tracking the Cyborg for some time, seeking vengeance for the destruction of Coast City. In the confusion, Henshaw escapes and is returned to the DC Universe. Parallax undoes the destruction of the planet that Henshaw had caused using power donated from the Silver Surfer.\nThe Cyborg encounters Hal Jordan again at the Source Wall, a nexus of statues that channels vital energy to preserve the Fourth World. Parallax uses his powers to generate representations of the victims of Coast City, which tear the Cyborg's body apart. Jordan then disperses Henshaw's consciousness, and the Cyborg is seemingly destroyed once again.\n\nDuring a crisis involving the Godwave, Superman (wearing his blue energy costume at the time) travels to New Genesis and encounters Henshaw again. Henshaw has taken part of the Source Wall's structure and crafted a small world made up of his memories, which he uses to taunt Superman before being defeated again. Unknown to Superman, the Cyborg stored his own consciousness in Superman's high-tech containment suit. After Superman returns to Earth, Henshaw escapes and constructs a new body, this time posing as an art teacher at a high school in an attempt to start over. He is a popular teacher and befriends the blind Ashbury Armstrong (daughter of Dirk Armstrong), but ultimately his rage towards Superman causes him to reveal his true identity and his new body is lost in a fight with Superman. To escape detection, Henshaw stores his consciousness in a clay statue. This statue is later stolen by the Toyman and the two villains join forces to kill Superman. To this end, the Cyborg designs a machine that will break Superman's energy form down into multiple components and beam them to different points in the galaxy, preventing Superman from reforming. A malfunction in the machine causes Superman to split into Superman Blue and Superman Red, the latter of whom eventually defeats and recaptures the Cyborg.\n\nThe Cyborg later attempts to take over Kandor, but fails when he is defeated by Superman and sent to the Phantom Zone. Shortly after the \"Superman Y2K\" story, Henshaw escapes the Zone and attacks Superman, who was suffering from Kryptonite poisoning. Henshaw is defeated with the help of the Kandorians and sent back to the Phantom Zone, swearing revenge. However, he is not encountered on subsequent visits to the Zone.\n\nHenshaw returns in a form similar to his original body, when he is revealed to be the Manhunters' new Grandmaster. With his influence, the Manhunters have been upgraded with organic material, most notably with blood. On the Manhunter home world of Biot, in sector 3601, Henshaw is holding captive several assumed-to-be-dead Green Lanterns, most of whom appeared to die during the \"Emerald Twilight\" saga.\n\nHenshaw has also used Kryptonian technology to upgrade the Manhunters. During the \"Green Lantern\" story arc \"No Fear\", Kryptonian robots are seen servicing the Manhunters. Henshaw, the Grandmaster, allowed the Green Lantern Corps to rebuild for unspecified reasons as a part of his master plan. While Henshaw explains that he first encountered the Manhunters around the time he was imprisoned in the Source Wall by Parallax, it has yet to be revealed how the Cyborg was able to escape the Phantom Zone and take control of Biot. Henshaw is defeated when Biot explodes, destroying most of his body aside from his head.\n\nHenshaw's head is then brought by a Guardian back to Oa so that they can learn of how he was able to take control of Biot, what he has learned from the Manhunters and to learn about \"the 52\" (referring to the 51 alternate Earths created during the second Crisis as well as their own reality). It is also revealed that the Cyborg knows of the 52, though exactly how he came by this knowledge is not made completely clear. It is stated that he has explored \"The Bleed\"; the space between dimensions, which could have occurred either when he was imprisoned there, when he was imprisoned in the Source Wall, or in his past exploration of the Marvel Universe.\n\nHenshaw's head is taken by the Sinestro Corps after their invasion of Oa to Qward. Henshaw is later seen as a herald of the newly returned Anti-Monitor. He reconstructs his cyborg body and replaces the S-symbol on his chest with the symbol of the Sinestro Corps. He now wields ten Qwardian power rings. It is revealed that Henshaw has joined the Sinestro Corps so that the Anti-Monitor can later kill him and allow him to rest in peace.\n\nHenshaw was the focus of the \"Tales of the Sinestro Corps Presents: Cyborg Superman\" one-shot that was released on October 3, 2007. In this book, Henshaw and his Manhunters head to Earth to assist the Sinestro Corps in their attack. En route, Henshaw stops leading the Manhunters which continue to their preprogrammed destinations. As he watches them go, he remembers everything that has happened to him, from their dreadful shuttle accident to his wife's suicide when she sees him in his robot form. He finishes this journey down memory lane by going to his wife's grave. He digs her corpse out and rips it into two, shouting that all he wants is not to be with her, but for these memories to fade.\n\nMeanwhile, the Manhunters begin an assault on the JLA satellite. Hawkgirl, Black Lightning, and Red Arrow retaliate; however, all three are neutralized when Henshaw assists in the attack and he successfully tampers with the mechanics of the satellite core. As the satellite is thrown out of orbit, Superman appears and engages Henshaw in battle. Their fight continues on Earth, while Sinestro transports his crew and his ship from the anti-matter universe. At first Superman seems to have the upper hand; however after two punches, Henshaw strikes with great power and rage, punching him through the Statue of Liberty. By the end, Henshaw has Superman in a choke hold, thinking that the victory is near.\n\nHe is later seen briefly in \"Tales of the Sinestro Corps Presents: Superman-Prime\", having presumably been beaten back by the combined strength of Superman, Supergirl, and Power Girl.\n\nWhen the Green Lantern Corps decide to detonate New Warworld and the central power battery of the Sinestro Corps to destroy the Anti-Monitor, Henshaw allows himself to be trapped behind a shield and exposed to the massive explosion. Before he is destroyed, however, he thanks the Green Lantern Corps.\n\nMost of Henshaw's body survived the explosion, but it took further damage when Superman-Prime hurled the Anti-Monitor into space. The upper part of his skull was retrieved by the android Manhunters. Unable to detect any life signs and confused without his leadership, the Manhunters reanimated the brain of the Cyborg Superman. He shed a tear when he realized he was still alive.\n\nIn the \"Brightest Day\" crossover, Henshaw would eventually return and work with the Alpha Lanterns as they attempted to augment every Green Lantern, including Ganthet, into an Alpha. This was apparently at the suggestion of the robed figure holding Ion and Parallax, who told him that Ganthet held the knowledge to destroy him permanently, after Henshaw's attempts to provoke Nekron into killing him during the \"Blackest Night\" failed because he lacked a heart to attract Nekron's interest. By threatening to make the Alpha Lanterns kill themselves if Ganthet does not cooperate, Henshaw forces Ganthet to work on reversing the augments that turned the Green Lanterns into Alpha Lanterns, hoping that he can use the resulting information to restore his original mortal body.\n\nHenshaw was seemingly killed when his lifeforce was finally separated from his nearly indestructible body by the combined full powered blasts of several Lanterns and Ganthet, and appeared on the mental plane of Alpha-Lantern Boodikka in an attempt to take her bio-mechanical body over, where both beings were their original, un-powered selves. Her essence, gifted with her innate, formidable combat skills, engaged his in one-on-one combat, and she quickly overpowered and killed his astral form.\n\nAfterwards, however, Ganthet noted immediately that there was something different about her. Boodikka claims this is because Ganthet's newly discovered emotions allowed him to see her as she is (Boodikka's true self, now in control of her body again), not by what she is (an Alpha Lantern).\n\nIn the \"Reign of Doomsday\" crossover, Boodikka was attacked by Doomsday while investigating the remains of New Krypton, and Henshaw was revealed to still be alive inside her, forming a new body out of her internal circuitry to fight Doomsday while Batman and Supergirl were trying to repair Boodikka. Henshaw uses his abilities to take control of the JLA Watchtower and uses the satellite's defenses in an attempt to kill Doomsday, reasoning that if he could manage to destroy the creature that killed Superman, it would prove once and for all that he is superior to Superman. After the creature is violently dismembered by Henshaw, it somehow absorbs the nanotechnology from Henshaw's body and repairs itself, becoming a new being dubbed Cyborg Doomsday. Cyborg Doomsday somehow manages to negate Henshaw's ability to repair himself, which leads Henshaw to believe that he might finally meet his demise. Supergirl bursts onto the scene and attempts to stop Doomsday herself, but Henshaw fires an energy blast at her, stating that he would not allow her to defeat the creature that had humiliatingly beaten him only moments before. With Supergirl distracted, Cyborg Doomsday knocks her out and then tears one of Henshaw's arms off before departing with both of his unconscious captives. Trapped in a satellite with the other Supermen, the heroes conclude that Henshaw has been trapped with them to keep them disorganized due to the tensions caused by his presence, prompting Henshaw to depart and search the satellite himself. After Superman arrives to rescue his comrades, Henshaw reveals that the Doomsdays that fought them were actually all clones of the original created by Lex Luthor. Henshaw tries to fight them, but Superman rips his central node off, knowing that they would not survive a confrontation with the Doomsdays. After the Doomsday clones are sent to another dimension, Henshaw is in custody of S.T.A.R. Labs.\n\nIn September 2011, \"The New 52\" rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, a fully human Henshaw appears as a doctor working for the Advanced Prosthetic Research Centre and colleague of Caitlin Fairchild. He is tasked into reactivating the android Spartan.\n\nWhile in space and after saving a planet called I'noxia, Supergirl discovers an amnesiac Cyborg Superman living there. This version is revealed to be Zor-El, who survives Krypton's destruction and is reconfigured as a half-human half-machine by Brainiac to be his scout looking for stronger species in the universe. His heart was switched with that of a human to remove his ability to be affected by kryptonite.\n\nWhen the human Henshaw is sent into space on the \"Excalibur\" on a long-term mission, he is monitored by the Clark Kent and Lois Lane of the pre-\"Flashpoint\" universe, who were trapped in the New 52 world following the \"Convergence\", with Superman seeking to prevent the rise of some of his former adversaries in this world. When the \"Excalibur\" crashes after returning from a ten-year journey to Jupiter and back, Superman saves the ship, but is puzzled to see that Henshaw is the only person on board. Taking Henshaw to a base he has established in the Arctic regions to better assess if this Henshaw is a threat or not, Superman is briefly forced to face both Henshaw and a new foe called Blanque, who possesses powerful telepathic and telekinetic abilities and was also kept in the fortress, but once Blanque is focused on fighting Superman, Henshaw helps Superman defeat this new foe with the weapons of a spaceship that was also kept in the fortress. It is later revealed that Henshaw acquired part of an object known as 'the Oblivion Stone' on Jupiter, with Superman forced to face an alien warrior seeking both Henshaw's part of the stone and another part kept in the fortress, but Superman drives her off, Henshaw claiming when questioned that he had no memory of anything that happened on the \"Excalibur\" or between it landing and him being discovered.\n\nAfter the reality disruption caused by Mister Mxyzptlk caused the histories of the pre-\"Flashpoint\" and \"New 52\" Superman to merge during the \"DC Rebirth\" reboot, Henshaw's memories of his past as the Cyborg Superman were restored. With this knowledge, he set out to assemble various old foes of Superman like Metallo, the Eradicator, Blanque, and his old 'ally' Mongul to form the Superman Revenge Squad before using the Oblivion Stone to restore his body to its Cyborg Superman state. He even expressed interest into recruiting General Zod to his group. The new Superman Revenge Squad then set out for Kal-El's Fortress of Solitude to obtain the Phantom Zone Projector, still in need of Zod's Kryptonian army to defeat the Superman family. What the Cyborg did not realize was that Zod was using the Squad to achieve his own ends. After finding his family trapped within the Zone's confines, Zod betrayed them, leaving Henshaw trapped within the Phantom Zone.\n\nHe would soon be released by his hated enemy, Superman, on account of an epiphany Clark had while on a time traveling excursion with Booster Gold. To keep the maddened bionic menace docile while he came up with a more humane means of detaining him, Superman gave Henshaw a Kryptonian memory crystal that would pacify the Cyborg Superman's rage by letting him relive his happiest memories in an fantasy world fabricated by his own mind. This self-imposed incarceration would not last, however, as the demented machine man found another means of escape. While he was trapped, a part of his mind escaped into the universe, where he sought to manipulate the Guardians and their appointed intergalactic law enforcement bureau, the Green Lantern Corps, to facilitate his escape. \n\nEven trapped within Superman's Kryptonian dwelling, Henshaw was able to influence the Central Power Battery back on Oa a universe away. From within his cell, he orchestrated a mystery surrounding the death of a Guardian to find a powerful weapon, the Phantom Ring. After hacking into the Lantern ring network, Henshaw used the unsuspecting Corpsmen Simon Baz, to break the Cyborg out of the Fortress of Solitude and deliver him the Phantom Ring. Though Henshaw was able to capture the Green Lanterns as his hacking into their main central Power Battery rendered their rings useless, however due to John Stewart and Simon Baz using the Kryptonian weapons that Simon borrowed from the Fortress, along with the fact that any Green Lantern who had not recharged their rings prior to Henshaw hacking into the main battery (such as Hal Jordan and Kilowog) were immune, allowing them to fight back. In retaliation, Henshaw retreated to Earth with the intention to recreate the disaster of destroying Coast City with the power of the Phantom Ring. With the help of other Green Lantern Corpsmen (such as Sodam Yat), Henshaw was defeated and forced to retreat with the Phantom Ring.\n\nHank Henshaw is a \"technomorph.\" Unlike a simple technopath which can physically manipulate technology with their mind, Henshaw can extend his consciousness into any machine.\n\nThrough his technomorphing ability, Henshaw also gained Kryptonian powers similar to Superman, while editing out weaknesses such as vulnerability to kryptonite. He can even commandeer complex alien technology such as power rings, controlling and assimilating the energy fueling the rings and their batteries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

She first came to public attention in 2003 as a contestant on the singing competition show \"American Idol\". Davis began performing in \"Rent\" on Broadway soon afterward, and was a member of the cast for four years. In 2011 Davis reached the top 8 on the first season of singing competition \"The Voice\".\n\nDavis was born in Washington, DC and raised in Los Angeles, CA. She graduated from Howard University in 2014 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts.\n\nIn the year 2000, she began her performing career in productions of \"Little Shop of Horrors\" and \"Jesus Christ Superstar\" with the Freilichtspiele Theatre Company in Schwabisch Hall, Germany.\n\nDavis was a contestant on the second season of \"American Idol\" in 2003, but was disqualified early in the season due to topless photos taken earlier in her career.\n\nAccording to Davis, she was up-front about her pictures:\n\nThe \"Idol\" staff took no action then, but two months later, they decided that Davis's participation would be inappropriate. \"They had decided that because \"American Idol\" was a family show, that they could not have me on the show because of the pictures I had taken –though they had never seen the pictures,\" she told EuroWeb. She also added that no one was able to find the pictures in question as the website that featured them had been taken down.\n\nIn 2007, revealing pictures of season six \"American Idol\" contender Antonella Barba surfaced on the internet, but Barba was kept on the show (though she was voted off shortly afterward). Many drew parallels to Davis's earlier situation. In an interview conducted for \"The New York Post\" on Monday, March 5, 2007, Davis said,\n\nThe discrepancy was discussed on talk show \"The View\" on March 6, 2007. Co-host Elisabeth Hasselbeck argued that the difference was that Davis was paid for her pictures whereas Barba was not. Co-host Rosie O'Donnell disagreed, saying, \"I think it's racist. I do... I think it's because she's black\". \"American Idol\" was also accused of racism by Project Islamic H.O.P.E. activist Najee Ali: \"obvious that it's a racial bias... when you have a situation where a black contestant is punished and a similar situation happens to a white contestant and there is no punishment and they're allowed to continue on the show.\"\n\nAfter \"American Idol\", Davis appeared in the Broadway musical \"Rent\" in 2003. She sang the solo in the opening song of Act Two, \"Seasons of Love\", and in ensemble roles such as Mrs. Jefferson (Joanne's mom), a woman with bags, a coat vendor, Mrs. Marquez (Mimi's mom) and others. She also occasionally played the part of Joanne. On June 1, 2005, Davis returned to her previous role in the Broadway production of \"Rent\". Davis had previously announced that she would leave \"Rent\" in May 2007, but announced her final performance following a mid-April 2007 show. During the weeks leading up to the April 29 performance of \"Rent\"'s 10-year reunion, Davis appeared in an iTunes Podcast (\"Rent: The PodCast\"). She also joined the original cast for a special encore performance.\n\nIn 2004, Davis was cast in the role of Effie in a West Coast-touring production of \"Dreamgirls\", which appeared in Sacramento, San Jose, and Seattle, and later went to the Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera.\n\nFrom August 3–19, 2007, Davis starred alongside Miche Braden and JMichael in the role of Mahalia Jackson in the Hartford Stage production of \"Mahalia: A Gospel Musical\", written by Tom Stolz and directed by Jeremy B. Cohen.\n\nIn 2008, Davis, along with fellow second-season \"American Idol\" participants Ruben Studdard and Trenyce Cobbins, starred in the 30th-anniversary national tour of the musical revue \"Ain't Misbehavin'\". The tour ran until May 2009, and was nominated for a Grammy award in the Best Musical Show Album category.\n\nIn the fall of 2010, Frenchie was cast in the role of the Fairy Godmother in Rodgers & Hammerstein's \"Cinderella (Enchanted Edition)\" at the Berkeley Playhouse, the resident theatre company at the Julia Morgan Center for the Arts in Berkeley, California.\n\nIn 2011, Davis competed in the first season of reality competition series \"The Voice\". In the first episode, she performed \"I Kissed a Girl\" by Katy Perry, advancing to the next round as a member of mentor/judge Christina Aguilera's team of 8.\n\nOn the May 10 episode, Frenchie competed in a sing off against Tarralyn Ramsey, both singing \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\" by Beyoncé. Frenchie won and made it to the next round.\n\nOn the June 7 episode, Frenchie performed \"When Love Takes Over\" by David Guetta and Kelly Rowland. She was told, \"You may very well have the strongest voice in this whole competition.\"\n\nIn the next week, it was announced that Frenchie did not win the fan vote from the previous week's performance, which would have allowed her to move on in the competition. However, Aguilera used her own vote to move Frenchie onto \"The Voice\"'s Elite 8.\n\nOn the June 21 episode, featuring the Showdown of the Elite 8, Davis performed \"Like a Prayer\" by Madonna.\n\nFrenchie Davis was eliminated during the semi-finals, finishing fifth overall. She did, however, join the other members of the final eight contestants of the show: Javier Colon, Dia Frampton, Vicci Martinez, Beverly McClellan, Casey Weston, Xenia and Nakia on a U.S. tour summer 2011.\n\nIn December 2012, Frenchie starred in the musical \"God Doesn't Mean You Get To Live Forever\" at the Baruch Performing Arts Center in New York with legendary pastor Dr. James A.

You all are the reason that I chose to be out. Because it is important that you see people in the public eye who are not ashamed of who they are. It is ok to be true to you.\"\"\n\nIn 2014 Davis created a stir when she spoke out bluntly in response to the verdict in the Shooting of Jordan Davis by Michael Dunn where the jury deadlocked on the charge of first-degree murder, saying \"\"As an LGBT woman of color, I am having an extremely difficult time grasping WHY Matthew Shephard’s life is so much more valuable than Trayvon’s or Jordan’s????!?!?!

He spoke with the directors of these two Universities, as well as those at the University of Bonn and the Free University of Berlin, to explore the possibility of joint exchange programs with Wayne State University. President Keast reported that both programs were running effectively, and that \"they enjoy the confidence and esteem of the German professors and administrators who are involved in them.\" The University of Munich program (the older of the two), and run exclusively by Wayne State University, reported 82 American students, from all over the U.S. (including Alaska and Hawaii) in residence. Attending courses entirely in German (and those available to German students as well) in their major field of study at Wayne, Keast reported that the University of Munich's responses to the program had been favorable, and that up to 100 spaces had been authorized in Munich for students from the program.\n\nPresident Keast also noted that Wayne State University's student representation in the program was low, due largely to the expense to students. Although a scholarship program supported some students who excelled but could not afford to participate in the program, enlargement of those scholarship funds was desirable to increase the opportunities for Wayne State students.\n\nIn 1967 the JYM program was approved by the LMU Munich Academic Senate as an affiliated academic institute, and was conferred the title “Junior Year in Munich an der Universität München” by LMU Munich in 1974 when the Bavarian State Ministry of Culture approved the program as an official course of study (Teil-Studiengang) at the university.\n\nStudents are enrolled at LMU Munich where they take coursework related to their degree studies in the US. Additional area studies courses and advanced language instruction are provided by the JYM program. Students are immersed in German language and culture by living alongside other university students in Studentenstadt Freimann.\n\nMore than 3500 students from 500 US colleges and universities have participated in the Junior Year in Munich program since 1953. Directing the JYM program today are Mark Ferguson (Ph.D. University of Wisconsin-Madison), program director in Detroit, and Hans-Peter Söder (Ph.D. Cornell University), resident director in Munich.\n"}
{"id": "1847173", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1847173", "title": "Landing Craft Utility", "text": "Landing Craft Utility\n\nThe Landing Craft Utility (LCU) is a type of boat used by amphibious forces to transport equipment and troops to the shore. They are capable of transporting tracked or wheeled vehicles and troops from amphibious assault ships to beachheads or piers.\n\nThe Golfo de Tribugá-class landing craft is an LCU developed by COTECMAR for the Colombian National Navy. The vessel class is also known as BDA () and an unarmored version for logistical and humanitarian services has also been developed, known as BALC ().\n\nThe Engin de débarquement amphibie rapide (EDA-R) landing catamaran or L-CAT, entered service in January 2011. They can carry a main battle tank like other European LCUs but are capable of much higher speeds, up to .\n\nGermany has two Barbe-class utility landing craft (Type 520), dating from the mid-1960s, which remain in service under the SEK-M Naval Special Forces' command. Germany is looking to acquire more such crafts. Five Barbe landing crafts were transferred to Greece at the end of the Cold War.\nIndia currently has three Kumbhir class LCU and six Mk IV class LCU. Currently two more MK IV class of LCU are under construction at GRSE.\n\nWith the launch of the amphibious transport ship in 1998 there was a need for LCUs. The Dutch LCUs are similar to the British LCU Mk.10 with the bridge being set to one side allowing for a roll-on roll-off design. Until 2005 the Netherlands Marine Corps used the LCU Mark I (NL).\n\nIn 2005 and 2006 the five vessels were modernized to the type Mark II. The vessels have been stretched by 9 meters to decrease their draft, which increased their load carrying capacity by 20 tons and allows them to come closer to shore. In addition they were fitted with a strengthened bow ramp, and they can now accommodate the Royal Netherlands Army Leopard 2 A6 main battle tank.\nBecause of the lengthening of the Mark II, the \"Rotterdam\" can take two LCUs (plus three LCVPs) in its dock. The dock of \"Rotterdam\"s sister ship, HNLMS \"Johan de Witt\", has the capacity to transport two LCUs, but carries four LCVPs in davits.\n\nThe Dyugon-class landing craft are operated by the Russian Navy\n\nSweden operates 16 small and fast (25 kt) water jet landing crafts (Swedish: ) with a displacement of 65 tones. They are armed with one 12,7 mm machine gun but can also lay out mines and is equipped with armour for anti submarine warfare. The vessel type has been exported to the United Arab Emirates. \n\nIn addition, HSwMS \"\" (A344) is a larger vessel at a displacement of 305 tones, capable of carrying 150 tones. The ship has a crew of 7 and is armed with two 7,62 mm machine guns.\n\nThe Armada has 26 LCM-1E in service since 2001 and has been exported to Australia and Turkey.\nThe LCU Mk.9 was built for use on the LPDs and where they were operated from the dock in the rear of the ships. Each ship carried four LCUs and four davit mounted LCVPs. The Mk.9 was to see many changes and upgrades during its service including a move from propeller to jet in many cases. The Mk.9 was capable of traveling as an ocean-going vessel and a number would be converted into a version, affectionately known as the \"Black Pig\", for use in Norway. The crew had full living quarters aboard with galley and heads. The opinion that the successful British amphibious operations during the Falklands War were only possible because of the two LPDs and their landing craft is well documented. In the Falklands War during the Bluff Cove Air Attacks LCU F4 from was bombed and sunk in Choiseul Sound by an Argentine Air Force A-4B Skyhawk of Grupo 5. The Mk.9, like the LPDs, served longer than ever anticipated, providing the backbone of Britain's amphibious assault capabilities.\n\nThree Mk.9s, pennant numbers 701, 705, and 709, remained in service by 2012. However, by 2014, they had all been withdrawn from service.\n\nThe LCU Mk.10 class vessels are operated by the Royal Marines. They are intended for use on board the new assault ships and and can use the Bay class landing ships. Deliveries of the class started from 1998 and the fleet currently consists of ten vessels, bearing pennant numbers 1001 to 1010. Both Albion and Bulwark are capable of carrying four LCUs each. These vessels are capable of operating independently for up to 14 days with a range of 600 nautical miles. They are capable of operating worldwide, from Arctic operating areas to tropical operating areas. The Mk.10 differs greatly from the Mk.9 with the bridge being set to the side allowing for a roll-on roll-off design. This greatly increases efficiency over the old Mk.9 as loading of the rear LCUs can take place without the LCUs being launched, the LPD having to dock down to do so, to change over and load up, which was a problem prior to the Falklands landings. The LCU Mk.10 has a 7-man crew and can carry up to 120 Marines or alternatively 1 battle tank or 4 lorries. British assault ships also carry smaller LCVPs on davits to transport troops and light vehicles.\n\nAll ten Mk.10s, pennant numbers 1001 to 1010, remain in service as of 2012.\n\nThe LCU 1466, 1610 and 1627 class vessels are operated by the United States Navy at support commands. They are a self-sustaining craft complete with living accommodations and mess facilities for a crew of thirteen. They have been adapted for many uses including salvage operations, ferry boats for vehicles and passengers, and underwater test platforms. Each LCU is assigned a non-commissioned-officer-in-charge (NCOIC) (Craft Master) who is either a Chief Petty Officer or Petty Officer First Class in the Boatswain’s Mate, Quartermaster or Operations Specialist rating. These vessels have bow ramps for onload/offload, and can be linked bow to stern gate to create a temporary pier-like structure. Its welded steel hull provides high durability with deck loads of 800 pounds per square foot. Arrangement of machinery and equipment has taken into account built-in redundancy in the event of battle damage. The craft features two engine rooms separated by a watertight bulkhead to permit limited operation in the event that one engine room is disabled. An anchor system is installed on the starboard side aft to assist in retracting from the beach. These vessels are normally transported to their areas of operation onboard larger amphibious vessels such as LSDs, LHDs and LHAs. The 40-year-old craft will be replaced under the Surface Connector (X) Recapitalization, or SC(X)R, project starting in FY2017.\n\nThe Runnymede class large landing craft or LCU 2000 class vessels are operated by the United States Army.\nThey transport rolling and tracked vehicles, containers, and outsized and general cargo from ships offshore to shore, as well as to areas that cannot be reached by oceangoing vessels (coastal, harbor, and intercoastal waterways). It can be self-deployed or transported aboard a float-on/float-off vessel. It is classed for full ocean service and one-man engine room operations and is built to U.S. Coast Guard standards. The vessel can sustain a crew of 2 warrant officers and 11 enlisted personnel for up to 18 days, and 10,000 miles. This class is also equipped with an aft anchor to assist in retracting from the beach. \n\n\"Cap'n Fatso\" is the second book in a series of three by Daniel V. Gallery that feature Boatswain's Mate First Class John \"Fatso\" Gioninni. Fatso is the commander of an LCU that, while on a special supply errand for his LSD's captain, is left behind in the Mediterranean Sea when the whole Sixth Fleet unexpectedly leaves for Vietnam. Through a series of accidents and misunderstandings Fatso and his crew are left without orders or attachment to any fleet and decide to \"search the Mediterranean Sea for the Sixth Fleet\". Hilarity ensues when they play practical jokes on the Russian fleet and make an \"official\" visit to Israel during the Six-Day War.\n\n"}
{"id": "1847177", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1847177", "title": "José Martínez Ruiz", "text": "José Martínez Ruiz\n\nJosé Augusto Trinidad Martínez Ruiz, better known by his pseudonym Azorín (; June 8, 1873, Monòver – March 2, 1967, Madrid), was a Spanish novelist, essayist and literary critic. As a political radical in the 1890s, he moved steadily to the right. In literature he attempted to define the eternal qualities of Spanish life. His essays and criticism are written in a simple, compact style. Particularly notable are his impressionistic descriptions of Castilian towns and landscape.\n\nJosé (\"Pepe\") Martínez Ruiz was born in Monòver, a village in the province of Alicante on 8 June 1873. Known as Pepe, he was the oldest of nine children but a lonely child who loved reading. His father, a middle-class lawyer, was an active conservative politician and later became a representative and mayor, and a follower of Romero Robledo. His mother, a landowner, was born in nearby Petrer.\n\nFrom the age of eight, until he was 16, he attended a boarding school run by the Escolapius Fathers (Piarists) in his father's home town of Yecla in the province of Murcia, a time he recalled as opposed to “truth, rebelliousness, and freedom” in \"Memorias inmemoriales\", but also nostalgically in \"Las confesiones de un pequeño filósofo\".\n\nFrom 1888 to 1896 he studied law at the University of Valencia, but did not complete his studies. Instead, he began to write, publishing a monograph on literary criticism in 1893. Here he began to write for local newspapers, contributing articles to the radical journal \"El pueblo\", edited by Blasco Ibáñez. He became interested in the ideas of Karl Krause, who argued that man could be reformed through education, and that openness to other nation's cultures could overcome national conservatism (see [in Spanish]).In 1895, Ruiz published \"Anarquistas literarios\" and \"Notas sociales\", in which he presented the main anarchist theories of the time. During this time he was a political radical. Ruiz became an admirer of the liberal Prime Minister Antonio Maura, who fought the culture of \"caciques\" (local political bosses), and who had become the figurehead of a youth movement, the Mauristas, who wanted him as a new head of state of Spain at a time of substantial resentment of King Alfonso XIII.\n\nRuiz’s journalism developed on moving to Madrid in 1896. He wrote for the republican newspaper \"El País\" until he was dismissed due to his radicalism in February 1897. He also wrote for the Paris-based anarchist magazine \"La Campaña\", and other Spanish journals including \"El Progreso\" (\"Progress\"), and \"El Imparcial\" (\"The impartial\"). His output during this period displayed anti-establishment views, including anarchist ideas, seeing writing as a catalyst for change, and depreciating aesthetics and faith.\n\nHowever, by 1899 his outlook was beginning to change. His work began to display a new philosophical and artistic consciousness, and an interest in the past. His book \"El alma castellana\" (The Castilian Soul), and his essay collections, \"La ruta de Don Quijote\" (The Route of Don Quixote) and, much later, \"Una hora de España 1560–1590\" (Spain's Hour, 1560–1590) capture the essence of being Spanish. He was abandoning revolutionary ideas, but becoming more nihilist, though respecting the dignity of human beings, and using irony to stand at arm's length from the world. This pessimism would eventually lead him to a period of political conservatism.\n\nIn 1902 he published the first of three intensely biographical novels, \"La voluntad\" (Volition), followed by \"Antonio Azorín\", and \"Las confesiones de un pequeño filósofo\" (The Confessions of a Minor Philosopher). Early in his career, Ruiz had used pen names, such as \"Cándido\" (in honor of Voltaire) and \"Ahrimán\" (the Persian god of destruction), and in 1904 he discarded his own name and began to use the surname of one of his characters, \"Azorín\". Using mostly short sentences, in both his fiction and his essays he emphasized the small but enduring elements and events in history and in one's life. In his view, time consisted of a series of repetitions, a notion of time described as \"timeless\".\n\nHe married Julia Guinda Urzanqui in 1908; she was to remain beside him for the rest of life and outlive him. She died in 1974 aged 98. They had no children.\n\nBy 1913 he was writing for \"ABC\", the popular pro-monarchy, conservative newspaper, including a series of articles on “La generación de 1898” (Generation of 98), a literary and artistic group to which he belonged.\nRuiz served as a conservative deputy in the Cortes Generales from 1907 to 1919, eventually becoming an under-secretary for the Ministry of Public Instruction. He gave up politics in opposition to the dictatorship of Gen. Primo de Rivera, though he never opposed him publicly.\n\nHe had by now become noted as a drama critic and essayist. His literary criticism, such as \"Al margen de los clásicos\" (Marginal Notes to the Classics), \"Don Juan\" and \"Doña Inés\", helped to open up new avenues of literary taste and to arouse a new enthusiasm for the Spanish classics at a time when a large portion of Spanish literature was virtually unavailable to the public. In 1924, he was elected to the Real Academia Española.\n\nHis first of a dozen plays, \"Old Spain\", appeared in 1926, followed by \"Brandy mucho brandy\" and \"La comedia del arte\", but had difficulty in adapting his slow and meticulous style to the dynamics and rhythm of drama. A wry comedy about journalists increasing newspaper sales by inventing stories, \"El Clamor\" (The Cry), led to the leadership of the \"Asociación de la Prensa\" expelling him, an act which Azorín likened to that of the Inquisition. He began to be influenced by the avant-garde movement, experimenting in a personal version of surrealism in a short trilogy, \"Lo invisible\" (The Invisible).\n\nThe outbreak of the Republic saw him re-adopt his old progressive political ideals. He abandoned \"ABC\" to write for the republican newspapers \"El Sol\", \"La Libertad\" and \"Ahora\"). He edited \"Revista de Occidente\", founded by José Ortega y Gasset, a journal promoting European philosophy, from 1923 to 1936.\n\nAt the outset of the Spanish Civil War, in 1936, Azorín fled to Paris, where he continued his literary career writing for the Argentine newspaper \"La Nación\". A book reflecting on this period of exile, \"Españoles en París\", was published in 1939.\n\nWhen he returned to Spain on 23 August 1939, he found himself in \"inner exile\", along with other intellectuals who had not overtly supported the Franco regime during the conflict. He was at first denied a press identification card (\"tarjeta de periodista\"), but was supported by Ramón Serrano Suñer, at that time Franco's Interior Minister and president of the Falange. Accepting Franco’s regime was the price he had to pay in order to be admitted back, and he aligned with the dictatorship in a noted article in the right-wing journal \"Vértice\". He contributed again to \"ABC\" from 1941 to 1962. He published numerous new works which were redolent of his earlier literary successes, including 'Pensando en España\" and \"Sintiendo España\".\n\nIn his old age, Azorín became a film enthusiast, writing numerous articles, some of which are reprinted in \"El cine y el momento\", and claiming that \"Cinema is the greatest form of art\".\n\nHe died in Madrid on March 2, 1967, at the age of 93, the longest-lived of the Generation of 98.\n\nThe political evolution that transformed Ruiz, a committed journalist as well as a revolutionary anarchist, into Azorín, a conservative member of parliament, as well as a sceptic and indulgent writer intimidated by Franco's regime, is key to understanding the division of his critics. Two different images of him were sustained, successive and irreconcilable personalities that cannot be studied at the same time without understanding the contradictions.\n\n\n\n"}

The contemporary Mille Lacs Band reservation has significant land holdings in Mille Lacs, Pine, Aitkin and Crow Wing counties, as well as other land holdings in Kanabec, Morrison, and Otter Tail Counties. Mille Lacs Indian Reservation is also the name of a formal Indian reservation established in 1855. It is one of the two formal reservations on which the contemporary Mille Lacs Band retains land holdings. The contemporary Mille Lacs band includes several aboriginal Ojibwe bands and villages, whose members reside in communities throughout central Minnesota.\n\nThe main reservation of the Mille Lacs Indian Reservation is the Mille Lacs Lake Indian Reservation (Misi-zaaga'iganiing in the Ojibwe language), at , and commonly referred to as the \"Mille Lacs Indian Reservation\", at the southern end of Mille Lacs Lake and composes about of land (commonly rounded in citations as \"61,000 acres\"), consisting of Township 42 North, Ranges 25, 26 and 27 West, and Township 43 North, Range 27 West, and islands in the southern part of Mille Lacs Lake. Before the raising of the lake level, \"United States v. Mille Lac Band of Chippewa Indians\" (229 U.S. 498 (1913)) cites the reservation as being of land. It was initially established in 1855 under the Treaty of Washington () for the Mille Lacs Indians and other Mississippi Chippewa (Ojibwe) Bands of Indians. Under later treaties and statutes the reservation was reserved for the exclusive occupancy of the Mille Lacs Band, and was later opened to non-Indian timber harvesting and settlement. The US Census Bureau designates this reservation as part of \"2270: Mille Lacs Indian Reservation and Off-Reservation Trust Land\".\n\nThis reservation contains the communities of \"Neyaashiing\" (Vineland) and \"Chi-minising\" (Isle). \"Neyaashiing\" houses the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe Government Center, Nay-Ah-Shing Lower and Upper Schools and the Ne-Ia-Shing Clinic. It hosts Minnesota Historical Society's Mille Lacs Indian Museum. Grand Casino Mille Lacs is also located in \"Neyaashiing\". The central offices for Woodland National Bank, which is owned by the Mille Lacs Band, and the offices of the Band's Circle of Health supplementary Health Insurance, are both located in Onamia, Minnesota, within the Mille Lacs Indian Reservation. \"Chi-minising\" houses the Chiminising Community Center and District IIa Government Services Center.\n\nThe reservation is located in Kathio Township, South Harbor Township, and Isle Harbor Township in Mille Lacs County. Other lands held in trust by the United States on behalf of the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe is also found, contiguous to the Mille Lacs Indian Reservation, in southwest corner of Idun Township in Aitkin County.\n\nThe contemporary Mille Lacs Indian Band also has land holdings with the Sandy Lake Indian Reservation (Gaa-mitaawangaagamaag in the Ojibwe language) in Aitkin County, which surrounds Big Sandy Lake and comprises about of land. Like \"Misi-zaaga'iganiing\", it too was initially established in 1855 under the Treaty of Washington for the Mississippi Bands of Chippewa Indians. Under a later treaty it was reserved for the exclusive occupancy of the Sandy Lake Band, and it was later opened to non-Indian settlement. The US Census Bureau designates this reservation as \"2385: Sandy Lake Indian Reservation\".\n\nToday, nearly all of the land within this reservation is non-Native American owned. The \"Gaa-mitaawangaagamaag\" community of the historical Sandy Lake Band of Mississippi Chippewa is located adjacent to and within the northern portion of the reservation. The \"Manoominikaan-zaaga'iganiing\" community of the historical Rice Lake band of Mississippi Chippewa is located adjacent to the reservation on the southern portion of the reservation. The United States Army Corps of Engineers operate a small flood-control dam within this Indian Reservation.\n\nThe reservation is located in parts of Libby, Shamrock, Turner, and Workman Townships in Aitkin County.\n\nAggregated as part of the US Census Bureau designated \"2270: Mille Lacs Indian Reservation and Off-Reservation Trust Land\", Mille Lacs Indian Reservation have scatted trust parcels less than each in Pine, Kanabec, southern Aitkin, Crow Wing and Morrison Counties, Minnesota. In addition, Mille Lacs Indian Reservation maintains the land upkeep on the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe ricing parcel at Star Lake. Furthermore, each Minnesota Chippewa Tribe member reservation, including the Mille Lacs Indian Reservation, hold equal one-sixth (/) interest on all Minnesota Chippewa Tribe member reservations, though asserting jurisdiction only on their own reservation.\n\nDue to the large territorial spread of the contemporary Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe, the Mille Lacs Band's statutes divide its territory into three administrative districts and one special services district.\n\nThe \"Neyaashiing\" District (District I) serves the Band members living in the western two-thirds of the \"Misi-zaaga'iganiing\" and service area from that portion of the reservation. In addition, any requested services outside of the pre-defined service districts are coordinated though this district. Its administrative center is located in \"Neyaashiing\" Community (Vineland, Minnesota), a Census-designated community located approximately north of Onamia, Minnesota.\n\n\"Gaa-mitaawangaagamaag\" District (District II) serves the Band members living in the eastern one-third of the \"Misi-zaaga'iganiing\" Reservation, all of \"Gaa-mitaawangaagamaag\" Reservation, the \"Manoominikaan-zaaga'iganiing\" Community and the \"Minisinaakwaang\" Community and service area from those locations.\n\nThis district is further sub-divided into two sub-districts: Districts IIa and IIb. District IIa is associated with the \"Chi-minising\" Community (Isle, Minnesota). District IIb comprises the rest of District II. The \"Minisinaakwaang\" Community (East Lake, Minnesota) is located approximately south of McGregor, MN. \"Minisinaakwaang\" Community houses the Mille Lacs Indian Reservation District II Community and Government Services Center, serving primarily District IIb.\n\n\"Aazhoomog\" District (District III) of the Mille Lacs Indian Reservation is located primarily in Pine County, comprises the \"Ne-zhingwaakokaag\" (Pine City-Rock Creek-Pokegama Lake) community of the historical Snake and Knife Rivers Band of the St. Croix Chippewa Indians of Minnesota, \"Gaa-zhiigwanaabikokaag\" (Hinckley) and \"Asinikaaning\" (Sandstone) communities of the historical Kettle River Band of St. Croix Chippewa Indians of Minnesota, and the \"Aazhoomog\" (Lake Lena) Village of the historical St. Croix Chippewa Indians of Minnesota, and service area from those locations. Though historically forming the western half of the St. Croix Chippewa Indians, these communities associated with the Mille Lacs band since the 1800s and are a part of today's contemporary Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe. The contemporary St. Croix Chippewa Indians of Wisconsin, located east of the St. Croix River, is considered a federally recognized tribe, which is not associated with the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe, located west of the St. Croix River.\n\n\"Aazhoomog\" Village houses the Mille Lacs Indian Reservation District III Community and Government Service Center and the Aazhoomog Clinic of the Ne-Ia-Shing Health Clinic system. Operating out of \"Gaa-zhiigwanaabikokaag\" is Grand Casino Hinckley and their various enterprises, including a golf course, RV park and a concert hall.\n\nThe Urban District of the Mille Lacs Indian Reservation is a special services district serving the large number of Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe living in the Twin Cities urban area. Originally in the Band's statutes, the urban area was established and defined as being Anoka, Hennepin and Ramsey Counties, providing TANF services to Band members in those three counties. While TANF services are still at the core for services provided to Band members living in the urban area, the Urban District has grown in providing other tribal supportive services, before available only on the Mille Lacs Indian Reservation proper. With a cooperative agreement with the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota, the Urban District provides affordable rental housing units to eligible low-income Band members.\n\nThough only nine communities are cited in the Band's statutes, the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe has ten formal communities and additional six informal communities.\n\nTen formal communities:\nSix informal communities:\n\n\n"}

He was previously a Member of Parliament (MP) for Tooting from 2005 until 2016. A member of the Labour Party, Khan is on the party's soft left and has been ideologically characterised as a social democrat. \n\nBorn in Tooting, South London, to a working-class British Pakistani family, Khan earned a law degree from the University of North London. He subsequently worked as a solicitor specialising in human rights issues and chaired the Liberty advocacy group for three years. Joining the Labour Party, Khan was a Councillor for the London Borough of Wandsworth from 1994 to 2006 before being elected MP for Tooting at the 2005 general election. Under Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown, Khan was appointed Minister of State for Communities in 2008, later becoming Minister of State for Transport. A key ally of the next Labour leader, Ed Miliband, he served in Miliband's Shadow Cabinet as Shadow Secretary of State for Justice, Shadow Lord Chancellor and Shadow Minister for London.\n\nAs the London Labour candidate, Khan was elected Mayor of London at the 2016 mayoral election, defeating London Conservatives rival Zac Goldsmith and then resigning as an MP. In office, he froze all Transport for London fares until he offered HM Government a 1% above-inflation fare rise in return for a £1.6bn bailout for TfL amid the COVID-19 pandemic, introduced the Hopper fare for unlimited bus and tram journeys for an hour, the Toxicity Charge (T-Charge) on older and more polluting vehicles, and the 24/7 Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) fee on all but the cleanest vehicles in Central London, and backed expansion at London City Airport and Gatwick Airport. He was a vocal supporter of the unsuccessful Britain Stronger in Europe and People's Vote campaigns for the UK to remain in the European Union and a second referendum on Brexit, respectively. As well as having a strained relationship with former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, whose socialist platform Khan thought unelectable, he attracted international attention for his Twitter arguments with United States President Donald Trump.\n\nHe has been included in the \"Time\" 100 list of most influential people in the world. Khan has been praised for promoting mutual tolerance among London's varied communities, making transport more accessible, and reducing the number of polluting vehicles in Central London; however, he has been criticised for the rise of knife crime and his response to Crime in London.\n\nKhan was born on 8 October 1970 at St George's Hospital in Tooting, South London to a working-class Sunni Muslim family. His grandparents migrated from Lucknow in United Provinces, British India to Pakistan following the partition of India in 1947.\nHis father Amanullah and mother Sehrun arrived in London from Pakistan in 1968. Khan was the fifth of eight children, seven of whom were boys. In London, Amanullah worked as a bus driver and Sehrun as a seamstress.\nKhan and his siblings grew up in a three-bedroom council flat on the Henry Prince Estate in Earlsfield. He attended Fircroft Primary School and then Ernest Bevin School, a local comprehensive. Khan studied science and mathematics at A-level, in the hope of eventually becoming a dentist. A teacher recommended that he read law instead, as he had an argumentative personality. The teacher's suggestion, along with the American television programme \"L.A. Law\", inspired Khan to do so. He read Law at the University of North London (now London Metropolitan University). His parents later moved out of their council flat and purchased their own home. Like his brothers, Khan was a fan of sport, particularly enjoying football, cricket, and boxing.\n\nFrom his earliest years, Khan worked: \"I was surrounded by my mum and dad working all the time, so as soon as I could get a job, I got a job. I got a paper round, a Saturday job—some summers I laboured on a building site.\" The family continues to send money to relatives in Pakistan, \"because we're blessed being in this country.\" He and his family often encountered racism, which led to him and his brothers taking up boxing at the Earlsfield Amateur Boxing Club. While studying for his degree, between the ages of 18 and 21, he had a Saturday job at the Peter Jones department store in Sloane Square.\n\nBefore entering the House of Commons in 2005, Khan practised as a solicitor.\nAfter completing his law degree in 1991, Khan took his Law Society finals at the College of Law in Guildford. In 1994 he married Saadiya Ahmed, who was also a solicitor.\n\nAlso in 1994, Khan became a trainee solicitor at a firm of solicitors called \"Christian Fisher\"; the firm undertook mainly legal aid cases. The partners were Michael Fisher and Louise Christian. Khan became a partner at the firm in 1997, and like Christian, specialised in human rights law. When Fisher left in 2002, the firm was renamed \"Christian Khan\". Khan left the firm in 2004, after he became the prospective Labour candidate for the Tooting parliamentary constituency.\n\nDuring his legal career, he acted in actions against employment and discrimination law, judicial reviews, inquests, the police, and crime, and was involved in cases including the following:\n\nBefore entering Parliament, Khan represented Tooting as a councillor on Wandsworth Council from 1994 to 2006, and was granted the title of Honorary Alderman of Wandsworth upon his retirement from local politics.\n\nIn 2003, Tooting Constituency Labour Party decided to open its parliamentary selection to all interested candidates, including the incumbent MP since 1974, Tom Cox. This prompted Cox, then in his mid-70s, to announce his retirement rather than risk de-selection. In the subsequent selection contest, Khan defeated five other local candidates to become Labour's candidate for the seat. He was elected to Parliament at the 2005 general election.\n\nKhan was one of the Labour MPs who led the successful opposition to Prime Minister Tony Blair's proposed introduction of 90 days' detention without charge for those suspected of terrorism offences. In recognition of this, \"The Spectator\"—a right-wing magazine then edited by Boris Johnson—awarded him the \"Newcomer of the Year Award\" at the 2005 Parliamentarian of the Year Awards. The magazine's editorial board stated that he had received the award \"for the tough-mindedness and clarity with which he has spoken about the very difficult issues of Islamic terror\". In August 2006, he was a signatory of an open letter to Tony Blair that was signed by prominent Muslims and published in \"The Guardian\". The letter criticised UK foreign policy and in particular the 2003 invasion of Iraq, stating that Blair's policies had caused great harm to civilians in the Middle East and provided \"ammunition to extremists who threaten us all\".\n\nKhan had to repay £500 in expenses in 2007 in relation to a newsletter sent to constituents featuring a 'Labour rose', which was deemed to be unduly prominent. While the content of the newsletter was not deemed to be party political, the rose logo was found to be unduly prominent which may have had the effect of promoting a political party. There was no suggestion that Khan had deliberately or dishonestly compiled his expenses claims, which were not explicitly disallowed under the rules at that time. The rules were retrospectively changed disallowing the claim, which had previously been approved by the House of Commons authorities.\n\nOn 3 February 2008, \"The Sunday Times\" claimed that a conversation between Khan and prisoner Babar Ahmad – a constituent accused of involvement in terrorism – at Woodhill Prison in Milton Keynes had been bugged by the Metropolitan Police Anti-Terrorist Branch. An inquiry was launched by the Justice Secretary, Jack Straw. There was concern that the bugging contravened the Wilson Doctrine that police should not bug MPs. The report concluded that the doctrine did not apply because it affected only bugging requiring approval by the Home Secretary, while in Khan's case the monitoring was authorised by a senior police officer. The Home Secretary, Jacqui Smith, then announced a further policy review and said the bugging of discussions between MPs and their constituents should be banned.\n\nIn June 2007, Blair stood down as both Prime Minister and Labour Party leader, to be replaced by Gordon Brown. Brown thought highly of Khan, who moved up the parliamentary ranks under Brown's Premiership. Brown made Khan a party whip, who was therefore charged with ensuring that Labour-sponsored legislation made it through the parliamentary process to become law. In July 2008, Khan helped push through a government proposal to permit the detention of those suspected of terror offenses for 42 days without charge. For his part in this, Khan was criticised by Liberty's Shami Chakrabarti and others, who claimed that Khan had contravened his principles on civil liberties issues.\n\nOn Prime Minister Gordon Brown's Cabinet reshuffle of 3 October 2008, Khan was appointed Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government.\nIn 2008, the Fabian Society published Khan's book, \"Fairness Not Favours\". In this work, Khan argued that the Labour Party had to reconnect with British Muslims, arguing that it had lost the trust of this community as a result of the Iraq War. He also said that British Muslims had their own part to play in reconnecting with politicians, arguing that they needed to rid themselves of a victim mentality and take greater responsibility for their own community. In the House of Commons in January 2009, Khan criticised Pope Benedict XVI for the rehabilitation of Bishop Richard Williamson following his remarks about the Holocaust, a move he described as \"highly unsavoury\" and of \"great concern\".\n\nIn June 2009 he was promoted to Minister of State for Transport. In what was believed to be a first for an MP, Khan used his Twitter account to self-announce his promotion. Though Khan was not a member of the cabinet, he attended meetings for agenda items covering his policy area, thus becoming the first Muslim to sit in on the British Cabinet. As Transport Minister, Khan supported plans to expand Heathrow Airport with the addition of a third runway.\n\nDuring this period, Khan served as chairman of the socialist Fabian Society, remaining on its Executive Committee. In 2009, he won the Jenny Jeger Award (\"Best Fabian Pamphlet\") for his writing \"Fairness not Favours: How to re-connect with British Muslims\".\n\nIn March 2010, Khan publicly stated that for a second successive year he would not be taking a pay rise as an MP or Minister, declaring \"At a time when many people in Tooting and throughout the country are having to accept pay freezes I don't think it's appropriate for MPs to accept a pay rise.\"\n\nIn 2010, Khan was re-elected as the MP for Tooting despite a swing against his party of 3.6% and a halving of his previous majority. His campaign in Tooting had been supported by Harris Bokhari, who reportedly used anti-Ahmadiyya sentiment to mobilise Muslim voters at a mosque in Tooting to vote for Khan instead of the rival Ahmadiyya candidate, Nasser Butt. In 2019, Bokhari was appointed to join Khan's new Diversity, Equality and Inclusion Advisory Group. In the subsequent Labour leadership election Khan was an early backer of Ed Miliband, becoming his campaign manager. In the wake of Labour's 2010 election defeat, Acting Leader Harriet Harman appointed Khan Shadow Secretary of State for Transport. Khan orchestrated Ed Miliband's successful campaign to become Labour leader, and was appointed to the senior roles of Shadow Lord Chancellor and Shadow Justice Secretary.\n\nIn April 2010 it was revealed that Khan had repaid falsely claimed expenses on two occasions, when literature was sent to his constituents. The first incident concerned letters sent out before the 2010 General Election which were ruled to have the \"unintentional effect of promoting his return to office\", the second a £2,550 repayment for Christmas, Eid, and birthday cards for constituents, dating back to 2006. Under House of Commons rules, pre-paid envelopes and official stationery can only be used for official parliamentary business. Khan's claim for the greetings cards was initially rejected, but he presented a new invoice no longer identifying the nature of the claim, and this was accepted. Khan attributed the improper claim for the cards to \"inexperience\" and human error and apologised for breaking the expenses rules.\n\nIn early 2013, Miliband appointed Khan as the Shadow Minister for London, a position that he held in addition to his other responsibilities. In December 2013, the Fabian Society published a collection of essays edited by Khan that was titled \"Our London\". Khan was also tasked with overseeing Labour's campaign for the 2014 London local elections, in which the party advanced its control in the city, gaining hold of twenty of the thirty-two boroughs. By this point, there was much talk of Khan making a bid for the London Mayoralty in 2016, when incumbent Mayor Boris Johnson would be stepping down. His options were affected by the outcome of the 2015 general election; if Labour won, then he would be expected to become a government minister, but if they lost then he would be free to pursue the Mayoralty. In December 2015, Khan voted against the Cameron government's plans to expand the bombing of targets in the Islamic State.\n\nPolls had suggested that Labour could be the largest party in a hung parliament following the 2015 general election, but ultimately the Conservatives secured victory. In the vote, Khan was returned for a third term as MP for Tooting, defeating his Conservative rival by 2,842 votes. He was one of 36 Labour MPs to nominate Jeremy Corbyn as a candidate in the Labour leadership election of 2015, but has said that he was \"no patsy\" to Corbyn and would stand up to him. He later stated that he nominated Corbyn to \"broaden the debate\" but did not then vote for him.\n\nOn 9 May 2016, Khan resigned as an MP by his appointment to the ancient office of Crown Steward and Bailiff of The Three Chiltern Hundreds, a customary practice in the UK. This triggered a by-election in Tooting to be held in June 2016.\n\nHe is regularly named among the Top 100 London politicians in the \"London Evening Standard\"s annual poll of the 1,000 most influential Londoners and is an Ambassador for Mosaic Network, an initiative set up by Prince Charles.\n\nIn 2016, Sadiq Khan ran to become the mayor of London and was elected with 57% of the vote. He is London's first Muslim mayor and first ethnic minority mayor. Khan was officially sworn in as Mayor in a multi-faith ceremony held in Southwark Cathedral the following day. His first act as mayor was his appearance at a Holocaust memorial ceremony in a rugby stadium in North London, although due to delays with the results of the election, he officially took office on 9 May.\n\nAfter Labour's defeat at the 2015 general election, Khan resigned from the Shadow Cabinet. He then announced himself as a candidate to be the Labour nominee for the London Mayoral elections of 2016. Khan soon gained the support of prominent figures in the party, including former Mayor of London Ken Livingstone, who was on Labour's leftist, socialist wing, and Oona King, who was on its centrist, Blairite wing. He also received the backing of the Labour-affiliated GMB and Unite unions, and the nomination of 44 of Labour's 73 parliamentary constituent parties in London, leaving him as one of the top two contenders.\n\nKhan's main rival was Conservative candidate Zac Goldsmith; Khan described him as a spoiled dilettante who \"never finishes anything he starts\". A YouGov poll for LBC suggested that while the other main contender to be the Labour nominee, Tessa Jowell, would defeat Goldsmith in a mayoral election, Khan would not. In hustings, Khan placed an emphasis on his working-class origins, which would play against Jowell's wealthier upbringing, and argued for the need for change in London, thereby insinuating that Jowell would represent too much continuity with the outgoing Johnson administration. In September 2015, Khan was announced as the winning nominee. He gained 48,152 votes (58.9%) against Jowell's 35,573 (41.1%). He was the favourite candidate in all three voting categories; Labour Party members, members of affiliated trade unions and organisations, and registered supporters who had paid £3 in order to vote.\n\nKhan vowed that if elected, he would freeze public transport fares in London for four years. He claimed that this would deprive Transport for London (TfL) of £452 million, but TfL stated that it would deprive them of £1.9 billion, taking into account projected population growth over this period. Although he had previously backed Heathrow expansion, he now opposed it, instead calling for expansion at Gatwick Airport; he was likely aware that supporting the former was a vote loser in London. Aware of the severe housing shortage in London, he also spoke of clamping down on foreign property investors, and proposed the establishment of both a \"London living rent\" tenure and a not-for-profit lettings agency that could undercut commercial operators in order to ease the high cost of renting in the city. He also called for house building on land owned by TfL, insisting that at least 50% of those constructed should be \"genuinely affordable\".\n\nThe YouGov poll had revealed that 31% of Londoners stated that they would not be \"comfortable\" with a Muslim mayor. Aware that many voters were suspicious regarding the loyalties of British Muslims to the British state, Khan emphasised his commitment to liberal social values. As part of this, he declared his opposition to homophobia, and said that he would have \"zero tolerance for anti-Semitism\". He openly condemned Islamic extremism and called on the Muslim community to take a leading role in combating it, although at the same time acknowledged the Islamophobia that many British Muslims faced. He also distanced himself from Corbyn, rebuking Labour's socialist leader for his links to armed anti-Israel groups, and criticising him for not singing the national anthem at an event commemorating the Battle of Britain. Concerned that Corbyn's socialist platform was alienating many of London's businesses, Khan declared that he would be \"the most pro-business mayor ever\", and met with groups such as the Federation of Small Businesses and City of London Corporation. He also ensured that his campaign was run entirely separate from Corbyn. Conversely, Goldsmith's Conservative campaign emphasised connections between Khan and Corbyn. Both the Conservative campaign and several Conservative-aligned newspapers sought to tar Khan as an apologist for, or even sympathiser with, Islamic extremism.\n\nInternational press sources often focused on his religious identity, with many right-wing American media outlets reacting with horror at his election.\n\nKhan won the election with 57% of the vote. The 1.3 million votes he received are the largest any UK politician has personally received to date. Various press sources noted that Khan's election made him the first actively affiliated Muslim to become mayor of a major Western capital. \n\nIn the buildup to the referendum on the UK's continuing membership of the European Union (EU), Khan was a vocal supporter of the 'Remain' camp. He agreed to attend a Britain Stronger in Europe campaign event with the Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron to demonstrate cross-party support for remaining within the EU, for which he was criticised by Labour Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell, who claimed that sharing a platform with the Conservatives \"discredits us\". After the murder of MP Jo Cox during the campaign, Khan called for the country to \"pause and reflect\" on the manner in which the Leave and Remain camps had been approaching the debate, stating that it had been marred by a \"climate of hatred, of poison, of negativity, of cynicism\". Following the success of the 'Leave' vote, Khan insisted that all EU citizens living in London were welcome in the city and that he was grateful for the contribution that they made to it. He endorsed the Metropolitan Police's 'We Stand Together' campaign to combat the rise in racial abuse following the referendum, and later backed the 'London is Open' campaign to encourage businesses, artists, and performers to continue coming to the city despite Brexit.\n\nWhile fasting for the Islamic holy month of Ramadan in 2016, Khan declared that he would use the period as an opportunity to help \"break down the mystique and suspicion\" surrounding Islam in Britain and help to \"get out there and build bridges\" between communities, organising iftars to be held at synagogues, churches, and mosques. He then appeared at a Trafalgar Square celebration of Eid al-Fitr, endorsing religious freedom and lambasting \"criminals who do bad things and use the name of Islam to justify what they do\". Following the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, Khan attended a vigil in Old Compton Street, Soho, and insisted that he \"will do everything in [his] power to ensure that LGBT Londoners feel safe in every part of our city\"; later that month he marched in the LGBT Pride London parade.\n\nIn August 2016, Khan declared his support for Owen Smith's bid to oust Jeremy Corbyn as Leader of the Labour Party. Although describing him as a \"principled Labour man\", Khan said that Corbyn had failed to gain popularity with the electorate and that Labour would not win a general election under Corbyn's leadership.\n\nOn transport, Khan immediately announced the introduction of a \"Hopper\" bus ticket which would allow a passenger to take two bus and tram journeys within an hour for the price of one; it was intended to benefit those on low incomes most. In January 2018, this system was upgraded to offer unlimited journeys and allowing travel on Tube or rail services in between. In June 2016, Khan announced that his electoral pledge to prevent transport fare rises would only apply to \"single fares\" and pay as you go fares, and not daily, monthly, weekly, or yearly railcards; he was widely criticised for this. That same month, he ordered TfL to ban any advertising on its network that was deemed to body shame or demean women. In July he urged the government to allow TfL to take control of the failing Southern rail service, and in August launched the 24-hour Night Tube service on Fridays and Saturdays, an idea initially proposed by Johnson.\n\nIn his first weeks as Mayor, Khan criticised foreign investors for treating homes in London as \"gold bricks for investment\", instead urging them to invest in the construction of \"affordable homes\" for Londoners through a new agency, Homes for Londoners, which would be funded by both public and private money. However, in contrast to one of his pre-election statements, he revealed that he no longer supported rent freezes in the city. Insisting that he would \"oppose building on the Green Belt, which is now even more important than when it was created\", Khan vetoed the construction of a football stadium and two blocks of flats on Green Belt land in Chislehurst, after the plan had already been supported by Bromley Council.\n\nKhan backed expansion of London City Airport, removing the block on this instituted by Johnson's administration; environmentalist campaigners like Siân Berry stated that this was a breach of Khan's pledge to be London's \"greenest ever\" mayor.\nOpposing expansion at Heathrow Airport, he urged Prime Minister Theresa May to instead support expansion at Gatwick Airport, stating that to do so would bring \"substantial economic benefits\" to London.\n\nKhan launched a \"No Nights Sleeping Rough\" taskforce to tackle youth homelessness in London in October 2016.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020 Khan was criticized for closing stations and reducing services on the tube network resulting in overcrowding and putting Key workers travelling to work at risk.\n\nKhan has called air pollution “the biggest public health emergency of a generation.” In October 2017, he introduced the Toxicity Charge (T-charge); operating within the same hours and zone as the London congestion charge, the T-Charge levied a £10 fine on top of that for older and more polluting vehicles (typically diesel and petrol ones registered before 2006) that do not meet . In that same year, he announced plans to establish a replacement: an \"Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ)\" across London that would charge owners of the most polluting cars a fine of £12.50 per day on top of the congestion charge. The all day, every day (except on Christmas Day) zone was introduced in 2019 in Central London, applying to diesel cars and vans whose engines aren't at the latest as well as most petrol cars over 14 years old; in addition, non-compliant buses, coaches and lorries will have to pay £100. The zone will be extended to the North and South Circulars in October 2021. It resulted in a drop of the worst polluting vehicles entering the zone each day from 35,578 in March 2019 to 26,195 in April after the charge was introduced.\n\nKhan criticised Great Britain's government in June 2017 for its lack of drive in improving general air quality. He stated that the government's action plan on the issue lacked “serious detail, fails to tackle all emission sources, such as from buildings, construction or the river, and does not utilise the government’s full resources and powers”, reflecting its low prioritisation of the issue in the past.\n\nIn September, he announced that the first 50 air quality audits for primary schools in the worst-polluted areas of the city had been launched with the objective to reduce air pollution around public schools. The audits will continue until the end of 2017, with reports being published in 2018.\n\nIn an interview with LBC, Khan accepted responsibility for knife crime in London as the Police and Crime Commissioner for the city, but blamed budgetary cuts by the UK Conservative Government. Khan stated that knife crime is \"rising across England & Wales\" and that it is \"clearly a national problem that requires national solutions.\" Following the 2019 London Bridge stabbing Khan stated, “You can’t disaggregate terrorism and security from cuts made to resources of the police, of probation, the tools that judges have … The key thing is we need to support the police and security service. (...) The point I am making is we can be safer, with more police and more resources.”\n\nWriting for \"The Spectator\", the political commentator Nick Cohen described Khan as a centre-left social democrat, while the journalist Amol Rajan termed him \"a torch-bearer for the social democratic wing\" of the Labour Party. The BBC describe Khan as being located on the party's soft left. In an article for Al Jazeera, the Marxist commentator Richard Seymour described Khan as a centrist, while Matt Wrack, the General Secretary of the Fire Brigades Union, characterised Khan as belonging to \"that part of the Labour Party that was in government under Blair and Brown\". The journalist Dave Hill described Khan as a social liberal.\n\nKhan has described himself as a \"proud feminist\". In April 2019, Khan joined the Jewish Labour Movement.\n\nKhan considers himself as a practising Muslim. He quotes from the Quran and hadith when discussing terrorism. He received death threats from Islamic extremists after voting in favour of the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act. He was also threatened by the far-right group Britain First, which in 2016 threatened to take \"direct action\" against Khan where he \"lives, works and prays\" as part of an anti-Muslim campaign.\n\nJournalist Dave Hill has said that Khan was \"savvy, streetwise and not averse to a scrap\", whilst also describing him as having a \"joshing, livewire off-stage personality\" which differed from the formal image he often projected while onstage.\nKhan used to perform stand-up comedy before running for Mayor, including a ten-minute money-raising \"Stand Up for Labour\" routine. Comedian Arthur Smith stated that Khan could become a \"good club-level comedian one day\". During the 2016 Mayoral campaign, Goldsmith referred to Khan as \"a caricature machine politician... the sort of politician who justified peoples' mistrust in politics\", as evidence citing Khan's U-turn on supporting Heathrow expansion.\nAnother rival in the 2016 Mayoral campaign, George Galloway of the Respect Party, referred to Khan as a \"flip-flop merchant\" and a \"product of the Blairite machine\".\n\nThere has been an ongoing political feud between Khan and US president Donald Trump since 2016, when Khan criticised Trump over his proposed \"Muslim ban\" and Trump responded by attacking Khan a number of times on Twitter over the next several years. Shortly before Trump's 2019 state visit to the UK, Khan compared Trump to \"European dictators of the 1930s and 40s\". Upon arrival, Trump responded on Twitter by calling him a \"stone-cold loser\" and comparing him to another mayor he also targets, Bill de Blasio.\n\n\nKhan is a practising Muslim who observes the fast during Ramadan and regularly attends Al-Muzzammil Mosque in Tooting. Journalist Dave Hill described Khan as \"a moderate, socially liberal Muslim\". Khan has expressed the view that \"too often the people who are 'representing' the Islamic faith aren't representative, they're angry men with beards. And that is not what Islam is about.\"\n\nKhan married Saadiya Ahmed, a fellow solicitor, in 1994. They have two daughters, both raised in the Islamic faith.\n\n\n\n"}

The Band has 4,302 members as of 2012. Its homeland is the Mille Lacs Indian Reservation, consisting of District I (near Onamia), District II (near McGregor), District IIa (near Isle), and District III (near Hinckley).\n\nThe Mille Lacs Band is one of six members of the federally recognized Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, which they organized in 1934. The other members are the White Earth Band, Leech Lake Band, Grand Portage Band, Bois Forte Band, and Fond du Lac Band. \"Chippewa,\" is a term commonly used in the United States to refer to Ojibwe people; the Mille Lacs Band prefers the term \"Ojibwe,\" which is also more common in Canada.\n\nThere are eight major \"doodem\" (or clan) types found among the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe. They are \"Bizhiw\" (Lynx), \"Makwa\" (Bear), \"Waabizheshi\" (Marten) \"Awaazisii\" (Bullhead), \"Ma'iingan\" (Wolf), \"Migizi\" (Bald Eagle), \"Name\" (Sturgeon) and \"Moozens\" (Little Moose).\n\nThe historical Mille Lacs Band of Mdewakanton Dakota was part of the historical Mille Lacs Indians. The Snake River Band of Isanti Dakota became part of the historical St. Croix Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, which is today known as the St. Croix Chippewa Indians of Minnesota. Due to some of these Dakota ancestry, Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe have a high degree of \"Ma'iingan-doodem\" members.\n\nAccording to oral traditions, the Ojibwe, part of the Algonquian languages-speaking peoples, coalesced on the Atlantic coast of North America. About 500 years ago, the ancestors of the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe began migrating west. This tradition has been confirmed by linguistic and archeological evidence.\n\nBy the mid-1700s, the Ojibwe had become established in the region around Mille Lacs Lake in what is today East Central Minnesota. They had a varied diet based on the resources of the area and hunted deer, bear, moose, waterfowl, and small game; fished the area's lakes and streams; gathered wild rice, maple sugar, nuts and berries; and cultivated some plants.\n\nEuropeans started arriving, among them French, British and American fur traders. Some European colonists stayed and began to compete with the Mille Lacs Band for resources and to encroach on their land. Such settlers continued to violate the treaties and agreements which the Mille Lacs Band made with the United States and British representatives over the decades.\n\nThe Ojibwe also suffered because of new infectious diseases, which killed many. By the end of the nineteenth century, only a few hundred Ojibwe remained on the Mille Lacs Indian Reservation. At that time, pressing for assimilation, the United States government prohibited the Ojibwe from practicing their religion (many had converted to Catholicism but still combined it with traditional prayers and rituals), tried to have their children sent to boarding schools at which they were forced to learn and speak English, and virtually denied their right to govern themselves. Their traditional way of life was nearly impossible to follow.\n\nOver the next century, Ojibwe bands in the Mille Lacs region struggled with poverty and despair. With the passage of the 1934 Indian Reorganization Act, the bands of the Mille Lacs region joined five others in forming the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, organized 1934-1936. The four historical bands in the Mille Lacs region (Mille Lacs Indians, Sandy Lake Band, Rice Lake Band of Mississippi Chippewa, and Snake and Kettle River Bands of St. Croix Chippewa Indians of Minnesota) were reorganized as the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe.\n\nIn the early 1990s, the Band opened Grand Casino Mille Lacs and Grand Casino Hinckley. Since then, casino revenues have allowed the Mille Lacs Band to strengthen its cultural identity, return to economic self-sufficiency, rebuild its reservation, and increase the prosperity of the entire region.\n\nThe Mille Lacs Band has a separation-of-powers form of government, making it one of the few Native American governments with three branches of government, similar to the government structure of the United States.\n\nThe current Chief Executive of the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe is Melanie Benjamin.\n\nThe Chief Executive, who is elected by Band members every four years, is the head of the executive branch. She appoints commissioners who are ratified by the Band Assembly to oversee the various departments in the executive branch. \n\nThe legislative branch of the Band’s government, known as the Band Assembly, consists of one Representative from each of the reservation’s three districts and a Secretary/Treasurer who presides over the Band Assembly as its Speaker. Each Representative is elected by the people of his or her district to serve a four-year term in the Band Assembly. Band members who live off the reservation select a home district and vote only for a Representative from that district. The Secretary/Treasurer is elected by all Band members.\n\nThe current Secretary/Treasurer of the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe is Sheldon Boyd, Speaker of the Band Assembly elected in April 2018.\n\n\nThe Chief Justice of the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe is Rayna Mattinas. The judicial branch includes the Chief Justice and the Court of Central Jurisdiction, which consists of three appellate justices and one district judge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1847201", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1847201", "title": "Milk &amp; Cheese", "text": "Milk &amp; Cheese\n\nMilk & Cheese are a pair of comic book characters created by Evan Dorkin and published largely by Slave Labor Graphics. Their comics follow an anthropomorphic, misanthropic carton of milk and a wedge of cheese. The eponymous \"dairy products gone bad\" tend to drink copious quantities of gin and become violent.\n\nCheese began as an in-joke involving two friends of Dorkin who were sometimes called the \"cheesy\" Garcia sisters. He continued drawing little cheeses that would eventually become \"Cheese\" on cocktail napkins at clubs during the mid to late 1980s. One night, at a restaurant, Dorkin scribbled a little Milk character next to the cheese drawing, with the pair hitch-hiking and holding beers in their hands.\n\nDorkin continued to sketch the two characters at conventions until Kurt Sayenga of the now defunct \"Greed Magazine\" saw them at a San Diego comic book convention and offered Dorkin a spot for a Milk & Cheese strip in the magazine. The strip ran in the final issue of \"Greed\", published in 1989. Several more strips were printed in various comic books and magazines before Slave Labor Graphics collected them and published \"Milk & Cheese\" #1. Since that time the company has published six more comic books featuring the characters. Several issues of the title were numbered as number one issues, making fun of the practice of buying comic books as an investment instead of as entertainment.\n\nIn 2011, Dark Horse Comics released a hardcover collection containing nearly every strip featuring the characters from 1989 to 2010.\n\nDorkin has turned down several offers to turn \"Milk & Cheese\" into an animated series or a movie, feeling that the characters would not translate well to the small or large screen. Merchandise such as magnets, Zippo lighters and lunchboxes have been produced though, and vinyl action figures of the pair have also been produced.\n\n\n\n"}

The band was founded by front man and singer Casey Chaos and combines elements of punk rock, hardcore, and heavy metal. Amen has released four studio albums, one live album, and the songs \"Coma America\", \"The Price of Reality\", and \"California's Bleeding\". The band saw continuous changes in membership, with Casey Chaos remaining the sole original member. In 2007, Amen went on hiatus and returned in 2014 with an appearance at that year's Knotfest.\n\nAmen was formed in 1994 in Los Angeles, California, after the disbanding of its frontman and singer Casey Chaos's previous band, Disorderly Conduct. The name \"Amen\" is a reference to the title of Disorderly Conduct's 1986 album of the same name. \n\nThe band's first album, \"Slave\", was written and performed almost entirely by Chaos himself, with Greg Barrybauer performing guitars and keyboards on a few tracks. \"Slave\" was recorded at Sandbox & Marquee West and mixed at Convent Studio in Los Angeles, California, and was limited to a run of only 2000 copies.\n\nThis led to lead singer Chaos being introduced to producer Ross Robinson, and the two collaborated and soon secured a deal with Roadrunner Records.\n\nAfter being signed to Roadrunner Records and working with producer Ross Robinson, Chaos went on to write the songs for Amen's major-label debut, the self-titled album \"Amen\". For the album, the band expanded to include one-time Ugly Kid Joe drummer Shannon Larkin, bassist John Fahnestock, a.k.a. Tumor, and guitarists Paul Fig and Sonny Mayo. On September 21, 1999, \"Amen\" was the band's major label debut. However, the band parted ways at the end of that same year due to lack of support; this resulted in their tour schedule being shortened, including the cancellation of a whole tour of Europe.\n\nThe EP \"Coma America\" was released in the United Kingdom the same year. In December 1999, \"Kerrang!\" magazine named it its Single of the Week, and called it \"without a doubt the Album of the Decade.\"\n\nBy 2000, Amen was signed to Virgin Records to record their third album. Retaining the same line-up as the previous album, in May 2000 the band recorded their follow-up album at Sound City in Los Angeles, California. \"We Have Come for Your Parents\" was released on October 31, 2000. The name was a reference to The Dead Boys album \"We Have Come for Your Children\".\n\nThe album became a quick success in the UK, landing them at Number 77 on the UK charts in November 2000. Two singles became hits for Amen in the UK; \"Too Hard to Be Free\" went to Number 72, and \"The Waiting 18\" reached Number 61.\n\nThe song \"The Price of Reality\" was released as a single before the album's release. A promotional video was created for the song that featured the same iconic styling and art direction as the album cover and artwork used by Amen during this time. In 2002, it was included on the \"Streetwise\" DVDs at FYE and was named \"Metal Hammer\" magazine's Video of the Year.\n\nThe success of the album would spawn years of touring in support of the album, including a 2002 re-release of the album in Australia for Big Day Out, before which Paul Fig left the band and Rich Jones joined on guitar.\n\nBy 2002, \"We Have Come for your Parents\" was voted the second best album of the year by \"Rock Sound\" magazine and fourth best album of the year by \"Kerrang!\". The band had also spent several months towards the end of 2001 recording their fourth album, again with producer Ross Robinson. However, disputes with Virgin Records led to the album being ultimately shelved. In spite of fans campaigning for the release of the album, it remained unreleased. Chaos stated that the band were left with financial struggles during this time, which almost resulted in the end of the band.\n\nIn 2003, the band was no longer on Virgin Records. During this time, Amen released \"Join, or Die\", a collection of b-sides and rare songs recorded by the band. The album was released through Chaos's new label, Refuse Music, and was initially limited to only 2000 copies, the first 1000 signed in Chaos's own blood. The album was sold by Amen during their 2003 tour in the United Kingdom. During this time, guitarist Sonny Mayo and bassist John Fahnestock left the band.\n\nIn 2003, Chaos worked with Daron Malakian of System of a Down on a demo tape for his project Scars on Broadway. When Malakian started his own record label EatUrMusic, an imprint of Columbia Records, Amen became the first band he signed; he also went on to produce their next album. The band added bassist Scott Sorry, guitarist Matt Montgomery (Piggy D.) and drummer Luke Johnson, who would in turn record the band's next album, their fourth release, \"Death Before Musick\", which was released on April 13, 2004.\n\nThe lead single, \"California's Bleeding\", would become Amen's highest-ranking track, reaching Number 52 on the UK charts and staying there for two weeks in April 2004. A promotional video was made featuring the band slowly getting more and more bloodied, with a second version of the video showing less blood.\n\nDuring this time, Rich Jones left the band, and Acey Slade joined. \n\nThe February 1, 2003, show, recorded at Manchester Academy, was released by Amen in 2004, for their first live video, \"Caught in the Act\", on DVD. On August 2, 2005, the same show was released on CD by Snapper Records under the title \"Gun of a Preacher Man\".\n\nIn 2005, Casey Chaos released \"Pisstory: A Catalogue of Accidents, a Lifetime of Mistakes\" through his label, Refuse Music, which included a number of previously unreleased Amen songs. Also in this year, the band toured the UK, with a line-up including Jinxx, Joe Letz, John King and Nate Manor. \n\nIn 2007, Amen appeared on Season 2, Episode 14 of \"The Henry Rollins Show\", where they performed their first single, \"Coma America\" (renamed \"Coma Amerikkka\" for this performance) in front of an Iraqi flag. The line-up at this point welcomed back John Fahnestock, Duke Decter and new member Chris Alaniz, while still including John King. Soon after the performance, the band toured the UK. This became their most recent tour. \n\nThat same year, Chaos was voted Number 53 among the \"All-Time Top 100 Underground Stars\" in a 2007 issue of Hit Parader.\n\nAfter being inactive for several years, Amen announced on February 26, 2014, that they would be playing the UK event Alt-Fest on August 16, 2014. The festival was canceled, but the band reunited on October 25, 2014 at Knotfest. There, they were accompanied by Stone Sour drummer Roy Mayorga and debuted a new song. This was one of several new songs recorded by Ross Robinson with Amen and Slayer drummer Dave Lombardo for an upcoming fourth Amen album release.\n\nIn an August 2014 interview with the UK's \"Rock-A-Rolla\" magazine, Lombardo stated that he didn’t join Amen as a full-time member: \"Actually, that is not all true, I simply helped the singer of Amen with his new album. He's a good friend.\" \n\nAs of May 2015, Amen was currently nearing completion of their next studio album, which was due in late 2015, but was not released. The new release date is presently not known. This will be the longest ever gap between studio releases by the band, with their next album being their first in over 13 years since 2004's \"Death Before Musick\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The film concentrated on Ellsworth \"Bumpy\" Johnson (Laurence Fishburne), Dutch Schultz (Tim Roth), and Lucky Luciano (Andy García).\n\nIn 1934, Ellsworth “Bumpy” Johnson (Laurence Fishburne) is released from Sing Sing and returns to Harlem, where mobster Dutch Schultz (Tim Roth) asserts his control of the lucrative numbers game. Schultz begrudgingly reports to Mafia boss Charles “Lucky” Luciano (Andy Garcia), who pays bribes to special prosecutor Thomas E. Dewey (William Atherton) to protect his business.\n\nReuniting with his cousin \"Illinois\" Gordon (Chi McBride), Bumpy returns to the employ of Harlem crime boss Madame Queen (Cicely Tyson), whose business is threatened by Schultz. Bumpy is introduced to Francine (Vanessa Williams), a friend of Illinois’ girlfriend Mary (Loretta Devine). Schultz’s meeting with the Queen ends in a standoff when he presents her with a rival’s testicles. Walking Francine home from a club, Bumpy charms her with his poetry.\n\nMadame Queen is attacked by Schultz’s men, led by black enforcer Bub Hewlett (Clarence Williams III), but Bumpy and fellow mobster Whispers (Paul Benjamin) repel the assassins and rescue her. At a meeting of the Commission, Schultz states his determination to take over Harlem. After robbing Schultz’s operation with Illinois, Bumpy is chastised by Madame Queen for making his own decisions. Schultz then hires two hitmen, the Salke brothers, to kill Bumpy, and has his police contact, NYPD Captain Foley (Richard Bradford), arrange for Madame Queen to be arrested. At a party, a 17-year-old named Tyrone asks Bumpy for a job, and Francine struggles to reconcile her feelings for Bumpy with his criminal ways.\n\nThe Salkes break into Bumpy’s home, killing his guards, but Bumpy ambushes them and kills one while the other is shot dead by a terrified Francine. Illinois is beaten and robbed by Foley and his officers, while Madame Queen is arrested for illegal gambling. Taking over her operation, Bumpy enlists Tyrone as a runner, and ignores the Queen’s orders to avoid violence. By May 1935, he is locked in an all-out war with Schultz. His wealth and power grow, as does the body count, including Tyrone. Bumpy’s attempt to comfort Tyrone’s mother at his funeral is rejected.\n\nAt an ice cream parlor with Francine, Bumpy realizes his banana split has been poisoned. When the shop owner reveals that Bumpy’s associate Vallie ordered him to hire the new employee responsible, Bumpy forces the employee to eat the poisoned ice cream. Whispers then kills Vallie with a razor. Bumpy confronts Schultz at the Cotton Club with Vallie’s severed finger, demanding he cease his Harlem operations; Schultz refuses.\n\nDisguised as truck drivers, Bumpy and Illinois deliver a bomb to one of Schultz’s illicit breweries, narrowly escaping before the warehouse explodes. Illinois returns home to find Schultz had Mary killed in retaliation. Threatened by Dewey to end the bloodshed in Harlem, Luciano invites Bumpy and Schultz to a meeting, against both their wills.\n\nVisiting Madame Queen in prison, Bumpy is rebuked for inciting a gang war. Finding she can no longer accept who he is, Francine leaves him, and Illinois drunkenly confronts him over the innocent lives lost. Illinois is abducted and tortured by Foley, to Hewlett’s disgust, but refuses to betray his cousin. At Luciano’s meeting, Bumpy and Schultz refuse to settle their dispute. After finding Illinois’ corpse left as a message, Bumpy slits Foley’s throat while he's with a black prostitute, but spares Hewlett’s life and offers him a partnership.\n\nBumpy accepts an alliance with Luciano, and Luciano’s driver – on Bumpy’s orders – informs Schultz that Bumpy will be meeting with Luciano’s accountant. Schultz and his men burst in but find only the accountant, who Schultz kills. At a restaurant, Schultz’s long-suffering henchman Lulu (Ed O'Ross) shoots him in the bathroom, and Schultz calmly returns to his table before dying. Meeting Luciano outside for payment, Lulu is shot dead. With Dutch eliminated and the gang war settled, Dewey – having received an enormous bribe from Bumpy, delivered by Hewlett – warns Luciano to stay away from Harlem. Hewlett and Bumpy part ways, and Bumpy arrives at Illinois’ funeral. After exchanging looks with Francine and Madame Queen, Bumpy walks out into the rain alone.\n\n\nA soundtrack containing hip hop and R&B music was released on August 12, 1997 by Interscope Records. It peaked at #94 on the \"Billboard\" 200 and #23 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews from critics. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 43% based on 21 reviews. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B on scale of A to F.\n\nCritic Roger Ebert noted that \"the film is being marketed as a violent action picture, and in a sense, it is\" and that director Bill Duke having made \"a historical drama as much as a thriller, and his characters reflect a time when Harlem seemed poised on the brink of better things, and the despair of the postwar years was not easily seen on its prosperous streets.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1847262", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1847262", "title": "Leading-edge slot", "text": "Leading-edge slot\n\nA leading-edge slot is a fixed aerodynamic feature of the wing of some aircraft to reduce the stall speed and promote good low-speed handling qualities. A leading-edge slot is a spanwise gap in each wing, allowing air to flow from below the wing to its upper surface. In this manner they allow flight at higher angles of attack and thus reduce the stall speed.\n\nAt an angle of attack above about 15° many airfoils enter the stall. Modification of such an airfoil with a fixed leading-edge slot can increase the stalling angle to between 22° and 25°.\n\nSlots were first developed by Handley Page in 1919 and the first aircraft to fly with them was the experimental H.P.17, a modified Airco DH.9A. The first aircraft fitted with controllable slots was the Handley Page H.P.20. Licensing the design became one of Handley Page's major sources of income in the 1920s.\n\nSimilar, but retractable, leading-edge devices are called slats. When the slat opens, it creates a slot between the slat and the remainder of the wing; retracted, the drag is reduced.\n\nA fixed leading-edge slot can increase the maximum lift coefficient of an airfoil section by 40%. In conjunction with a slat, the increase in maximum lift coefficient can be 50% or even 60%.\n\nUnlike trailing edge flaps, leading-edge slots do not increase the lift coefficient at zero angle of attack since they do not alter the camber.\n\nA leading-edge slot is a fixed (non-closing) gap behind the wing's leading edge. Air from below the wing can accelerate through the slot towards the low pressure region above the wing, and exit from the slot moving parallel to the upper wing surface. This high-speed flow then mixes with the boundary layer attached to the upper surface and delays boundary layer separation from the upper surface.\n\nSlots naturally exact a penalty on the aircraft in which they are used. This is because they contribute to drag compared to an unslotted wing. The extra drag at low speed is acceptable because of the beneficial reduction in stall speed and improvement in handling characteristics, but at higher speeds the extra drag contributed by slots is a significant disadvantage because it reduces cruising speed and increases fuel consumption per unit distance flown.\n\nOne way to reduce the cruise drag of slots is to make them able to be closed. This arrangement is known as leading-edge slats. Aerodynamically, slats work in the same way as fixed slots but slats can be retracted at higher speeds when they are not needed. Slats, in turn, are heavier and more complex than slots.\n\nAt low angles of attack the airflow through the slot is insignificant, although it contributes to drag. At progressively higher angles of attack, the flow of air through the slot becomes increasingly significant, accelerating from the higher pressure region below the wing to the lower pressure region on top of the wing. At high angles of attack the fastest airspeed relative to the airfoil is very close to the leading edge, on the upper surface. In this region of high local airspeed, skin friction (viscous force) is very high and the boundary layer arriving at the slot on the upper wing has lost much of its total pressure (or total mechanical energy) due to this friction. In contrast, the air passing through the slot has not experienced this high local airspeed or high skin friction, and its total pressure remains close to the free-stream value. The mixing of the upper surface boundary layer with air arriving through the slot re-energises the boundary layer which then remains attached to the upper surface of the wing to a higher angle of attack than if the slot were not there. The leading-edge slot was therefore one of the earliest forms of boundary layer control.\n\nLeading-edge slots are generally of two types: those that are full-span and those that are partial-span.\n\nFull-span slots are generally found on Short Take-off and Landing STOL aircraft like the Fieseler Storch, Dornier Do 27, PZL-104M Wilga 2000, and Zenair CH 701 STOL. Their primary purpose is to allow the aircraft to fly at a higher angle of attack before reaching the stalling angle.\n\nIn aircraft other than specialist STOL aircraft, full-span slots have serious drawbacks because, to take advantage of the high angle of attack at the stall, they usually necessitate long undercarriage legs that either cause high drag or are longer than can be accommodated easily inside the airframe.\n\nPartial-span slots are usually found only on the outboard portion of the wing where they ensure airflow over that portion of the wing will remain unstalled at higher angles of attack than the inboard portions of the wing. This ensures the wing root stalls first and contributes to docile stall behaviour and maintaining aileron control throughout the stall. Using slots in this manner produces a similar result to employing washout on a wing, but through a different means. Examples of aircraft with partial-span, fixed slots are the Stinson 108, Bristol Beaufort, Lockheed Hudson, and Dornier Do 28D-2 Skyservant.\n\n\n\n"}

Its administrative headquarters is two miles south of Morton. The reservation is located southeast of Redwood Falls, the county seat.\n\nThe area was established as part of a reservation for the Mdewakanton and Wahpekute bands of the Lower Sioux under the Treaty of Traverse des Sioux in 1851 with the federal government. It originally extended about along the Minnesota River and was wide. It was greatly reduced following the Dakota War of 1862 and various other actions. As of the 2000 census, this lower reservation had a population of 335, and a land area of 2.705 sq mi (7.006 km²).\n\nThe area around the reservation is primarily rural, developed in the 21st century for agricultural commodity crops of corn and soybeans. The conversion of area creeks to agricultural ditches has also altered habitat and reduced the diversity of the ecology.\n\nFrom the 1940s to the 1960s, the United States government (including Congress) had a policy of terminating tribes, that is, ending the special relationships that they had with the federal government. The belief was that tribes would be selected that appeared to have adapted successfully to mainstream culture: in the process, any communal land would be distributed to individual households, and individuals would become residents of their respective counties and states, and under their jurisdiction.\n\nFour Native American tribes (each associated with separate reservations) in Minnesota were identified for termination in the 1950s. A memo dated January 19, 1955 for the BIA issued from the Department of the Interior indicates additional terminations were being reviewed in proposed legislation for what were primarily Dakota tribes in southern Minnesota, including the Lower Sioux Community in Redwood and Scott counties, the New Upper Sioux Community in Yellow Medicine County, the Prairie Island Community in Goodhue County, and about 15 individuals living on restricted tracts in Yellow Medicine County.\n\nDiscussions between the BIA and the tribal Indians from the targeted area began in 1953 and continued throughout 1954. Though the Prairie Island and Lower Sioux communities drafted agreements for distribution of land to individual households and ownership, the Upper Sioux strongly opposed fee-simple title to tribal lands. On January 26, 1955 Senator Edward Thye introduced a bill (S704) to provide for termination of the tribes. In addition to opposition by the Dakota, regional residents objected to termination, saying that county and state expenditures might increase for the areas then within reservations, and they expressed their opposition to the committee reviewing the bill. The Minnesota Governor's Commission on Human Rights also opposed the legislation, indicating that it would \"not adequately protect the interests of the Indians...\". The bill died in committee, never reaching the Senate floor.\n\nThe Mdewakanton tribe operates Jackpot Junction Casino Hotel, which began in 1984 as a bingo facility. The casino has become a major employer for the surrounding communities. The Lower Sioux Agency, a historic site on the reservation associated with the Dakota War of 1862, is managed by the community in partnership with the Minnesota Historical Society.\n\nJackpot Junction Casino Hotel was the state of Minnesota's first casino. In addition to the gaming areas, Jackpot Junction features three bars, three restaurants, an amphitheater for live performances, and two grand ballrooms. Live music is played every weekend, usually country and occasionally rock. The casino is open twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week.\n\nCounty Highway 2 runs through the reservation, connecting it to U.S. Route 71 and Minnesota State Highway 19 to the northwest.\n\n\n"}

All 135 seats in the Parliament were up for election.\n\nThe Parliament of Catalonia was the devolved, unicameral legislature of the autonomous community of Catalonia, having legislative power in regional matters as defined by the Spanish Constitution and the Catalan Statute of Autonomy, as well as the ability to vote confidence in or withdraw it from a President of the Government. Voting for the Parliament was on the basis of universal suffrage, which comprised all nationals over eighteen, registered in Catalonia and in full enjoyment of their political rights.\n\nThe 135 members of the Parliament of Catalonia were elected using the D'Hondt method and a closed list proportional representation, with a threshold of 3 percent of valid votes—which included blank ballots—being applied in each constituency. Parties not reaching the threshold were not taken into consideration for seat distribution. Additionally, the use of the D'Hondt method might result in an effective threshold over three percent, depending on the district magnitude. Seats were allocated to constituencies, corresponding to the provinces of Barcelona, Girona, Lleida and Tarragona. Each constituency was allocated a fixed number of seats: 85 for Barcelona, 17 for Girona, 15 for Lleida and 18 for Tarragona.\n\nThe electoral law provided that parties, federations, coalitions and groupings of electors were allowed to present lists of candidates. However, groupings of electors were required to secure the signature of at least 1 percent of the electors registered in the constituency for which they sought election. Electors were barred from signing for more than one list of candidates. Concurrently, parties and federations intending to enter in coalition to take part jointly at an election were required to inform the relevant Electoral Commission within ten days of the election being called.\n\nThe term of the Parliament of Catalonia expired four years after the date of its previous election, unless it was dissolved earlier. The President of the Government was required to call an election fifteen days prior to the date of expiry of parliament, with election day taking place within sixty days after the call. The previous election was held on 19 November 1995, which meant that the legislature's term would have expired on 19 November 1999. The election was required to be called no later than 4 November 1999, with it taking place on the sixtieth day from the call, setting the latest possible election date for the Parliament on Monday, 3 January 2000.\n\nThe President of the Government had the prerogative to dissolve the Parliament of Catalonia and call a snap election, provided that no motion of no confidence was in process and that dissolution did not occur before one year had elapsed since a previous one under this procedure. In the event of an investiture process failing to elect a regional President within a two-month period from the first ballot, the Parliament was to be automatically dissolved and a fresh election called.\n\nBelow is a list of the main parties and coalitions which contested the election:\n\nThe table below lists voting intention estimates in reverse chronological order, showing the most recent first and using the dates when the survey fieldwork was done, as opposed to the date of publication.

She played tympani and double bass in school and local orchestras as a teenager, until the day she discovered the electric bass guitar.\n\nAfter playing with a couple of local bands, she moved to London and worked as a secretary at Polydor Records. Here she was discovered by King Crimson leader Robert Fripp, who was encouraged to stay at a show to see \"a girl who works in the office. \" Fripp invited her to join his band, The League of Gentlemen.\n\nLee went on to work with Robyn Hitchcock on his album \"Groovy Decay\" and recorded two albums with famed political, post punk band Gang of Four in England. Later she moved to the United States. Lee became a sought-after session, concert and recording artist, playing with the Thompson Twins before she crossed paths with The B-52's during the recording of their \"Cosmic Thing\" album, and can be seen in the \"Love Shack\" and the \"Roam\" videos. Following a stint on the Cosmic tour, Sara formed \"The Raging Hormones\" with B-52 session drummer Charley Drayton. She then started a seven-year run with the Indigo Girls, contributing \"sterling performances\". In 1996 and 1997 she accompanied singer-songwriter Ani DiFranco on tours of Europe and North America, as documented on the double-live album \"Living in Clip\".\n\nLee has played with many other artists, including Joan Osborne, Ryuichi Sakamoto and Fiona Apple, and is a close friend of former David Bowie bassist Gail Ann Dorsey.\n\nLee re-joined the B-52's as a touring member in 1999.\n\nOn 12 September 2000 she released her debut solo album \"Make It Beautiful\" on Difranco's Righteous Babe records. Lee recorded instrumental tracks, which were sent to musicians with whom she had previously worked to provide lyrics, including Ani DiFranco, Emily Saliers of the Indigo Girls, Pal Shazar, Barbara Gogan of The Passions and Kristen Hall.\n\nShe replaced Rachel Haden for the final dates of Todd Rundgren's 2009 \"Arena\" tour.\n\nLee was also a judge for the fifth annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists' careers.\n\n"}

It was founded in 1944 in Moscow by an outstanding native biologist academician Vladimir Nikolayevich Sukachev. The institute was named after him in 1967. In 1959 the Institute was assigned to the Siberian Division of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR and transferred to Krasnoyarsk.\n\nIn various years the Institute was headed by academicians V.N.Sukachev (1944-1959), A.B.Zhukov (1959-1977), and A.S.Isayev (1977-1988). Since 1994 the Institute has been headed by academician Y.A.Vaganov. The Institute of Forest is the largest forest-biologic institution in the Russian Academy of Sciences. Its staff consists of 170 scientific researchers, 1 academician, 33 doctors and 95 candidates of sciences including. Among them there are 3 Honoured Scientists of the Russian Federation and 4 Honoured Foresters of the Russian Federation. More than 60 people take a Ph.D. course simultaneously in a number of forest specialties: forest science, forestry, forest management, forest taxation, sylvicultures, forest pyrology, genetics and selection, ecology, botany, forest soil science, entomology, microbiology, physiology and biochemistry of wood plants, and bioinformatics. From 1947 to 2003 at the Institute 140 prominent native foresters have defended their doctor’s theses. A part of them were then elected members of the Russian Academy of Sciences.\n\nSince 1947 the Institute has been a collective member of the International Union of Forest Research Institutions, and since 1991 it has entered the International Association of Boreal Forest Researchers.\n\nThe library of the Institute is a depository of scientific literature on the forest themes for the regions of Siberia and Far East. It makes up more than 150 units of storage. The readers of the library (550 people) are not only employees of the Institute but also lecturers, Ph.D. students, and university students.\n\nThe structure of the Institute (4 departments, 10 laboratories and a branch in Novosibirsk) provides development of fundamental and applied research in a wide range: biospherical role, ecologic functions and biodiversity of forest ecosystems, monitoring of their condition, and rational use of forest resources.\n\nThe scientific schools formed at the Institute: taiga forestry and productivity of forests, permafrost forestry, taxation and forest exploitation, forest morphology, cartography, aerospace information usage, forest genetics and selection, pyrology, zoology, microbiology, physiology and biochemistry of wood plants, dendrology and dendroclimatology and other spheres of forest biological science are the basis for mutual investigations with the scientists of the United States, Canada, England, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, Belarus, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Japan, China, Korea, Mongolia. In 1992 there has been founded Siberian international center of ecological investigations of boreal forests which favours the participation of employees in foreign grants, projects, programs including the problems of climate changes, atmosphere gas composition and biodiversity.\n\nIn different landscape-ecological conditions on the territory of Siberia a net of basic research points (stationaries) to carry out experimental work and durable monitoring of forest ecosystems function was created.\n\nAvailability of experts of various profiles at the Institute makes it possible to estimate scientific and applied forest problems. So, in the 1960s a complex research of mountain Siberian pine forests of Siberia was finished by development of “Instructions” on forest management in them.\n\nIn it for the first time the primary significance of forestforming functions of this forest formation and their hydrology role in particular was stressed.\n\nIn the activities of the Institute a great place is taken by investigations in the forests of Lake Baikal started on the initiative of academician A.B.Zhukov yet in the early 1970s. The developed approaches regulate exploitation of the region forests. They scientifically ground the monitoring of forest exploitation. It is proved by the regional evaluation scale of reforestation evaluation, by the landscape approach to location of wood-cutting areas and by rating of the technogenic load on the ground. This provides the level of ecological security corresponding to the legislation of the Russian Federation on Lake Baikal protection and UNESCO requirements to the objects of world heritage.\n\nFor a number of years the Institute has been developing application methods of information coming from flying vehicles (planes, satellites) to estimate condition of forest cover of taiga zone under the impact of anthropogenic and natural factors. Under the leadership of academician A.S. Isayev in 1970-1980 there was worked out a system of aerospace information analysis. It includes etalon polygons on which on-ground and remote information was compared. Forest territories were differentiation on natural basis, experimental research of interaction of electromagnetic radiations with typical forest vegetation was made. Real expression of these investigations became a thematic cartography of resourcefully perspective single regions, compilation of forest fund maps.\n\nContinuation of this work nowadays is the development of the technique of woodstand taxation and morphology structure investigation on the basis of laser, digital photo and video survey, digital satellite survey and three-dimensional taxational computer analysis of images. On its basis regularities of taxational structure and dynamics of phytomass in plantations forming after fires and cuttings were found out.\n\nTwo receiving and analyzing satellite information stations available at the Institute make it possible to estimate ecological information in real time in the interests of various institutions.\n\nIn cooperation with foreign scientists the Institutes is working out the system approach to forest management with the help of GIS technologies and databases characterizing the main components of forest biocenoses.\n\nOn the basis of modern techniques of receiving and analysis of scientific information estimation of ecological condition of forests in the zones of huge technogenic impact (oil-gas complex of West Siberia, Norilsk industrial region) is carried out.\n\nIn two dendrariums of the Institute for more than 30 years about 450 species, subspecies and forms of trees and bushes from different botanico-geographical regions have been investigated. Their acclimatization, growth and development in new conditions are estimated to select perspective species for planting of greenery in towns and other settlements.\n\nLong-term investigations of Siberian forests are reflected in more than 450 books and collections of papers of the Institute employees. The information about features of forest forming process contained in them is widely used by home and foreign scientists and design organizations. On its basis normative documents (rules, directions, recommendations) regulating the main forest production works in Siberia.\n\n"}

CIWL soon developed a dense network of luxury trains all over Europe, whose names are still remembered today and associated with the art of luxury travel. Examples of such luxury travel include the Blue Train, the Golden Arrow, the North Express and many more. CIWL became the first and most important modern multinational dedicated to transport, travel agency, hospitality with activities spreading from Europe to Asia and Africa.\n\nNow part of the French Newrest group, Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits (et des grands express européens) (English: \"The International Sleeping-Car (and European Great Expresses) Company\") was founded by the Belgian Georges Nagelmackers in 1872, in Belgium. CIWL quickly established itself as the premier provider and operator of European railway sleepers and dining cars during the late 19th and the 20th centuries.\n\nThe holding company, CIWLT, is a fully owned subsidiary of the Accor Group, the historical brands were transferred to Wagons-Lits Diffusion in 1996.\n\nDuring his trip to the United States in 1867–1868 the 23-year-old Belgian Georges Nagelmackers was impressed by the Pullman night trains. Upon his return home, he decided to establish a network of such trains in Europe. He envisioned that such trains should be luxurious and travel across borders.\n\nIn 1874 Nagelmackers founded the \"Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits\" and the \"et des Grands Express Européens\" addition became part of the name ten years later. By 1886 his company had become the main organiser for most European heads of state. The symbol \"WL\" held by two lions became a well-known trade mark.\n\nThe company ran either complete trains of \"Wagon-Lits\" cars or individual sleeping and dining cars were coupled onto services operated by the state railways of the European countries through which the \"Wagon-Lits\" cars passed. These cars were always drawn by locomotives of the various state railways, as \"Wagon-Lits\" did not operate its own fleet of locomotives.\n\nPrior to World War I, CIWL held a monopoly being the only group catering to the needs of the international railroad traveller. The company introduced famous services, such as the \"Orient-Express\", the \"Nord Express\", and the \"Sud Express\" and expanded to markets outside Europe with involvement in the \"Trans-Siberian Railway\" across Russia. The Company's trains also reached Manchuria (\"Trans-Manchurian Express\"), China (Peking, Shanghai, and Nanking) and Cairo.\n\nIn 1894 the \"Compagnie Internationale des Grands Hotels\" was founded as a subsidiary and began operating a chain of luxury hotels in major cities. Among these were the \"Hôtel Terminus\" in Bordeaux and Marseille, the \"Hôtel Pera Palace\" in Istanbul, the \"Hôtel de la Plage\" in Ostend, and the \"Grand Hôtel des Wagons-Lits\" in Beijing (Peking).\n\nWith the start of World War I CIWL's coaches were confiscated for military use. In Germany and Austro-Hungary Mitropa was founded to take over the property and services of CIWL. In 1919, the communists in Russia expropriated CIWL's local rolling stock and hotels. After the conclusion of World War I CIWL demanded to have its central European service routes restored. It regained these for Austria, Poland, and Czechoslovakia; however, in Germany the Reichsbahn and Mitropa sabotaged this process. On April 23, 1925, CIWL and Mitropa agreed to separate spheres of influence. CIWL received transit routes through Germany and routes between Germany and Belgium, France, Italy, Poland, Latvia, Lithuania and Czechoslovakia. Mitropa took over the routes between Germany and the Netherlands and Scandinavia, as well as trains within Germany, and to Gdańsk. Trains between Germany and Austria were served by both companies.\n\nIn the interbellum period CIWL flourished again. The company's blue and gold livery was introduced. In 1925 Wagon-Lits opened its first \"Travel Palace\" in Paris. Services extended to the Middle Eastern cities of Aleppo, Baghdad, Cairo, and Tehran. Metal coaches, replacing older wooden ones constructed of teak, became available in 1926. In 1931 the fleet reached its maximum of 2268 vehicles. This period can be considered the zenith of luxury rail travel. CIWL's carriages were decorated by such renowned artists as Réné Prou, René Lalique and Morrison. CIWL also commissioned renowned artists such as Adolphe Mouron Cassandre to design posters advertising its services.\n\nWith anschluss in 1938, the Austrian market was lost to Mitropa (it was recovered after 1945). Because of World War II and the subsequent communist expansion, CIWL lost more markets in central and eastern Europe.\n\nAfter World War II, CIWL increasingly focused on the travel agency and management business. Accordingly, it was renamed \"Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits et du Tourisme\" (CIWLT) in 1967, and later just called \"Wagons-Lits\".\n\nBy 1971 the rolling stock of CIWL had become aged and outdated, and the renovation and replacement needed was beyond the company. It sold or rented its coaches to the SNCF, FS, SBB, DB, ÖBB, NMBS/SNCB, NS, DSB and RENFE. An international sleeping car pool named TEN (Trans Euro Night) was founded at that time and took over and managed (until 1995) many of the carriages of CIWL and of the Mitropa-successor DSG.\n\nWagons-Lits is headquartered in Paris. Currently CIWL provides service on night trains in Austria, Italy and Portugal and meal and catering services in daytime trains of France, Italy, Portugal and on Eurostar services to the United Kingdom.\n\nA number of sleeping-cars on the European continent are owned by CIWL. The cars are maintained by the sister company Rail Service International (RSI) in the Netherlands and leased to train operating companies.\n\nThe company currently operates in Austria, France, Italy, Portugal, Spain, and the UK. The specifics of the services provided vary based on mergers and splits within the company and the surrounding business climate.\n\nIn 1927, Thomas Cook was sold to CIWL after poor financial results; CIWL took a back-role in the running of the subsidiary.\n\nIn 1991, \"Wagons-Lits\" became part of the French multi-national Accor Hotel and Leisure Group.\n\nAt the time, CIWL included the hotel brands Altea, Arcade, Etap, PLM and Pullman. Catering organisation Eurest and, in the automobile world, Wagons-Lits included Europcar rental and motorway break specialists Relais Autoroute.\n\nFollowing the 1992 purchase, the Pullman hotels were gradually rebranded to Sofitel, allowing the Pullman name to be reused in 2007 for a new class of conference hotel. Sixty-eight existing Accor hotels will be transferred over, including some Sofitel that were originally Pullman hotels.\n\nIn May 2011, Accor announced plans to auction residual historic assets of Wagons-Lits, including posters and tableware.\n\nIn 1996, all copyrights and trademarks concerning the use of historical brands and archive photographs were transferred to Wagons-Lits Diffusion in Paris.\nWagons-Lits Diffusion manages the historic brands and logos derived from Compagnie des Wagons-Lits past activities.\n\nIn July 2010, the rail catering operations of Wagons-Lits were transferred from Accor to the catering company \"Newrest\", since then operating under the name \"newrest wagons-lits\".\n\nIn 1997, the Europe business travel and leisure retail arm of Wagons-Lits (Wagonlit Travel) was merged on an equal basis with that of Carlson Travel Network (operating in the United States). The result was a new company called \"Carlson Wagonlit Travel\" jointly owned by Accor and Carlson Holdings Inc., the former parent companies of the merged entities.\n\nThe Carlson side of the merger had grown from a travel agency founded by Ward Forster in the United States in 1888. Originally called \"Ask Mr. Foster Travel Agency\", the chain was renamed to \"Carlson Travel Network\" following an earlier purchase by the Carlson Group and later to CWT.\n\nAccor sold its 50% of Carlson Wagonlit Travel in 2006 for €500m to Carlson Companies and One Equity Partners. However, Accor maintains its interest in the railway service sector of Wagon Lits.\n\nFrom 1883, the Orient Express operated between Paris and Istanbul in three nights and three times per week in each direction. The Orient Express deployed the first sleeping and dining cars for long-distance train travel in Europe. In 2003, the company restored seven cars of the famous \"Pullman Orient Express\" and made it available for tourist events. After 2007, the night sleeper service named Orient Express only operated between Strasbourg and Vienna. Made obsolete by Europe's high-speed rail network, the Orient Express made its last run on 14 December 2009.\n\nThe Northern Express connected Paris with St. Petersburg (later Riga), via Germany, Poland and Eastern Europe. Begun in 1884, the service is now run by DB NachtZug from Paris as far as Hamburg, although it previously served Copenhagen.\n\nThe famous Art Deco poster \"Nord Express: (1927) by Cassandre (Adolphe Mouron Cassandre) shows a stylised version of the train that traveled from London and Paris to Riga and Warsaw (Varsovie)\n\nThe Southern Express connected Paris–Lisbon starting in 1887, to provide the second-half of the through connection from St. Petersburg (Finland/Russia) via Paris to the west coast of Portugal. In Lisbon, travellers could transfer to trans-Atlantic steamships.\n\nThe Blue Train linked Paris/Calais–Southern France overnight and used Wagons-Lits cars up until 1938. It was actually operated by French company called Chemins de fer de Paris à Lyon et à la Méditerranée.\n\nThe Trans-Siberian Express operated with the permission of the Russian Tsar until 1917 during World War I. The service ran from Moscow to Vladivostok and Peking, taking over one week in each direction.\n\nThe \"Night Ferry\" was a through London Victoria to Paris Gare du Nord overnight boat train. Wagons-Lits operated the service from October 1936 until December 1976 with specially constructed cars designed to fit the smaller British loading gauge. It was taken over by British Rail in January 1977, before ceasing in October 1980. Before the introduction of high-speed Eurostar services, this was the only through service. The train's English Channel segment between Dover and Dunkirk was made by train ferry.\n\nThe Londres-Vichy Pullman Express ran between London and Vichy in France primarily to serve visitors to Vichy's famous thermal baths. Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits operated the service from 14 May 1927 until 19 September 1930.\n\nBasic data is listed. Further details are in the article regarding the specific train.\n\nThe 1918 Armistice with Germany was signed in CIWL #2419 (\"\"). Returned to CIWL service afterwards, it was retired later to join the French presidential train before being withdrawn in 1921 and placed on display in the Cour des Invalides, Paris until 1927, when it was moved to Compiègne for display. It remained on display in its own building, the \"Clairiere de l'Armistice\" until 1940, when it was removed by the German army and used to receive the 1940 Armistice with France between France and Nazi Germany. Following this, the carriage itself was taken to Berlin as a trophy of war, along with pieces of a large stone tablet which bore the inscription (in French):\n\nFollowing this period of display in Berlin, CIWL #2419 was moved to Ohrdruf in Thuringia for storage in 1945. Following the Allied advance into Germany in early 1945, the detachment of SS troops protecting the carriage set it ablaze before burying the remains to prevent them from falling into Allied hands. Some remnants were later exhumed and moved back to the restored Compiègne site for display, while CIWL later donated another carriage from the same construction order, 1913-built CIWL #2439, in 1950 as a replacement. This carriage had also been at Compiègne on 11 November 1918, and it was renumbered as #2419D for display at Compiègne where it was installed on Armistice Day 1950.\n\nCIWL archives are rich of more than 100 years of posters, historical photos, plans and communication material that represent a tremendous interest for cultural, academic or commercial projects. The greatest creators and artists have been hired by CIWL since 1883 in order to create luxury conditions and confort in travel, as well as a particular graphic style that is now recognized worldwide by its quality. Great effort are made to digitalize images (photos, plans and posters), where as vast paper archives are preserved, waiting to be sorted and classified in a near future.\nAs of today, available digital archives consist of more than 250 CIWL posters, 800 Paris–Lyon–Méditerranée (PLM) posters and more than 6,000 archives photos. Probably one of the most extensive poster collection in the world from the end of nineteenth century to the late 1950s. \nThese archives are regularly used for all types of publishing and media projects, all over the world, as well as Cultural Events.\nAgatha Christie set two of her Hercule Poirot mysteries on or around CIWL trains:\n\nSidney Gilliat and Clifford Grey wrote the script for the 1932 British film directed by Walter Forde:\n\nIn 1991, David Copperfield performed a televised illusion which caused a recently restored \"Orient Express dining car\" (in fact an American dining car decorated in Wagon-Lits colours) to seemingly vanish into thin air.\n\nCIWL model railway cars have been manufactured by many companies including Märklin, Fleischmann, Trix, Jouef, Bachmann, France Trains, LS Models and Tri-ang.\nRivarossi also produced very detailed models, discontinued in the late nineties, production restarted lately with the new society affiliated to Hornby.\n\n\n\n"}

A prolific director since the 1970s, among his films is the 2001 historical epic, \"The Legend of Suriyothai\". A member of the Thai royal family, his official royal title is Mom Chao, or M.C., the most junior title still considered royalty. For \"Suriyothai\" as well as his 2007 historical epic, \"King Naresuan\", Chatrichalerm was backed by Queen Sirikit.\n\nFour of his films have been submitted by Thailand for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film: \"The Elephant Keeper\", \"Song for Chao Phya\", \"Daughter 2\" and \"King of Fire\". In 1981, he was a member of the jury at the 31st Berlin International Film Festival.\n\nIn June 2012, he was adjudged bankrupt, causing his ongoing film project to be halted indefinitely.\n\nPrince Chatrichalerm's parents, Prince Anusorn Mongkolkarn and Mom Ubol Yukol Na Ayudhya were filmmakers and co-founders of the Lavo Pappayon Company. His uncle was Prince Bhanu Yukol, a pioneering Thai filmmaker.\n\nChatrichalerm was sent to Australia for schooling, and from there he went to UCLA, where he graduated with a degree in geology. His minor was film studies, and he shared classes with Francis Ford Coppola and Roman Polanski. He also worked as an assistant to director and producer Merian C. Cooper. (Chatrichalerm's grandfather, Prince Yugala Dighambara, had helped \"King Kong\" makers Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack with the filming of \"Chang\" in 1927.)\n\nThough he's best known for his work on \"Suriyothai,\" Chatrichalerm's filmography stretches back to the 1970s. His first film, 1971's \"Out of the Darkness\", was the first Thai science fiction film.\n\nHe was among the first of a new wave of Thai directors to produce films reflecting changes in society. One of these films was his \"Khao Chue Karn\" (\"Dr. Karn\"), based on a well-known story by Suwannee Sukhontha. Released in the months leading up to the bloody pro-democracy student uprisings of 1973, \"Dr. Karn\" dared to address corruption in Thai society.\n\nEven Chatrichalerm's status as a prince didn't rate when the authoritarian government's censor wanted to cut the film. Chatrichalerm personally showed the film to Field Marshal Thanom Kittikachorn and was able to persuade the dictator to let the film be released uncut.\n\nMost of Chatrichalerm's films have some kind of social message, such as the downside of prostitution (\"Hotel Angel\", 1974), teenage sex and delinquency (\"Daughter\" and \"Daughter 2\"), protecting the environment (\"The Elephant Keeper\", 1987), or the evils of the drug trade (\"Powder Road\", 1991). His films resist depicting any glamor, focusing on the poor, downtrodden working classes, such as \"Freedom of Taxi Driver\" (1984) or \"Song for Chao Phya\" and often with gritty action, such as \"Gunman\" (1983), \"Salween\" (1993), and \"The Colonel\" (1974).\n\nThree of his films from this period were submitted by Thailand for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film: \"The Elephant Keeper\", \"Song for Chao Phya\" and \"Daughter 2\".\n\nAround 1999, Chatrichalerm embarked on the most ambitious film project of his career, \"The Legend of Suriyothai\", a lavish production about a 16th-century Siamese queen, Suriyothai. For his production, he received the backing of Queen Sirikit and the royal family. The film was at first conceived as being eight hours long. By the time it premiered in Thai cinemas, it was nearly three hours long. An even-more-condensed version was released in the United States in 2003, edited and \"presented by\" Francis Ford Coppola, a former classmate of Chatrichalerm's from UCLA.\n\nAfter \"Suriyothai\", Chatrichalerm started work on an even bigger project, \"King Naresuan\", about the 16th century Siamese monarch, Naresuan. More epic in scope than \"Suriyothai\", \"Naresuan\" was initially released in two parts in early 2007. Under the title \"King of Fire\", the second part of the series was submitted by Thailand for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. As of late 2007, a third part is scheduled to start production in early 2008.\n\nOn June 5, 2012, Chatrichalerm was adjudged bankrupt by the Central Bankruptcy Court and was placed under an absolute receivership, causing his ongoing \"King Naresuan\" project to be halted.\n\n\n\n\n"}
