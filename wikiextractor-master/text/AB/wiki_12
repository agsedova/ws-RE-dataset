When she left anthropology she attacked the concept of skull size as a determinant of intelligence distinguishing the sexes.\n\nFollowing her break with anthropology Pelletier went on to become a psychiatrist. In 1903, Pelletier conducted a campaign with the support of the feminist newspaper \"La Fronde\" to support the eligibility of women for all types of medical specialisation, most relevantly to the examination for psychiatric internships. In 1906, Pelletier alongside Constance Pascal became two of the first French women to sit the examination to become a psychiatrists; they were also the first women to work as interns in state asylums.\n\nOutside her professional life, Pelletier was a committed activist. As a teenager, Pelletier attended feminist and anarchist groups. By 1900, Pelletier was actively involved in feminism and socialist activism. In 1906, she became secretary of \"La Solidarité des femmes\" (\"Women’s Solidarity\"), and established the organization as one of the most radical feminist organizations at the time. In 1908 she represented the group at the Hyde Park demonstrations for women’s suffrage. She published \"La suffragiste\".\n\nDuring this period, in 1905, she also helped to found the unified French Socialist Party (as the \"Section française de l'Internationale ouvrière\"), sat on its national council until World War I, and represented the party at most international socialist congresses before the War. She worked for the Red Cross during the War, treating the injured from both sides.\n\nShe was also notable as a female Freemason. Pelletier was a member of the \"La Nouvelle Jérusalem\" lodge, becoming a member in 1904. The lodge had both male and female members, and, although politically active, she was often at odds with her lodge in her efforts to promote the emancipation of women. Her views in favor of birth control and abortion were closely aligned with the French neo-Malthusian movement, supporting the use of birth control and abortion by women, she also wrote for the periodical \"Le Néo-Malthusian\".\n\nPelletier wrote extensively on the subject of women's rights, some publications include: \"La femme en lutte pour ses droits\" (\"Woman Struggling for Her Rights\") (1908), \"Idéologie d'hier: Dieu, la morale, la patrie\" (\"Yesterday's Ideology: God, Morals, the Fatherland\") (1910), \"L'émancipation sexuelle de la femme\" (\"Sexual Emancipation of Women\") (1911), \"Le Droit à l'avortement\" (\"The Right to Abortion\") (1913), and \"L'éducation féministe des filles\" (\"The Feminist Education of Girls\") (1914).\n\nPelletier displayed her beliefs in her dress and social behavior. She wore her hair short and was known for her cross-dressing and celibacy. Her actions were perceived by her contemporaries as a challenge to gender-identity. She wrote of her image, \"\"I will show off mine [breasts] when men adopt a special sort of trouser to show off their...\"\".\n\nShe traveled illegally to the Soviet Union in 1921, wrote \"Mon voyage aventureux en Russie communiste\" (\"My Adventurous Voyage in Communist Russia\"), first published in \"La Voix de la Femme\" (\"The Woman's Voice\") at the end of 1921, and published as a separate volume in 1922. She joined the French Communist Party upon its creation, but left it in 1926; following her break with Communism she embraced Anarchism. Pelletier wrote utopian novels following her return from the Soviet state, as well as her autobiography \"La femme vierge\" (\"The Virgin Woman\") in 1933.\n\nPelletier was partially paralyzed by a stroke in 1937. However, she continued to openly practice abortion, and was arrested in 1939. Following her arrest she was interned in an asylum and her physical and mental health deteriorated. She died within the year.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1928941", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1928941", "title": "AP site", "text": "AP site\n\nIn biochemistry and molecular genetics, an AP site (apurinic/apyrimidinic site), also known as an abasic site, is a location in DNA (also in RNA but much less likely) that has neither a purine nor a pyrimidine base, either spontaneously or due to DNA damage. It has been estimated that under physiological conditions 10,000 apurinic sites and 500 apyrimidinic may be generated in a cell daily.\n\nAP sites can be formed by spontaneous depurination, but also occur as intermediates in base excision repair. In this process, a DNA glycosylase recognizes a damaged base and cleaves the N-glycosidic bond to release the base, leaving an AP site. A variety of glycosylases that recognize different types of damage exist, including oxidized or methylated bases, or uracil in DNA. The AP site can then be cleaved by an AP endonuclease, leaving 3' hydroxyl and 5' deoxyribosephosphate termini (see DNA structure). In alternative fashion, bifunctional glycosylase-lyases can cleave the AP site, leaving a 5' phosphate adjacent to a 3' α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. Both mechanisms form a single-strand break, which is then repaired by either short-patch or long-patch base excision repair.\n\nIf left unrepaired, AP sites can lead to mutation during semiconservative replication. They can cause replication fork stalling and are bypassed by translesion synthesis. In \"E. coli\", adenine is preferentially inserted across from AP sites, known as the \"A rule\". The situation is more complex in higher eukaryotes, with different nucleotides showing a preference depending on the organism and experimental conditions.\n\nAP sites form when deoxyribose is cleaved from its nitrogenous base, breaking the glycosidic linkage between the two. This can happen spontaneously, as a result of chemical activity, radiation, or due to enzyme activity. The glycosidic linkages in DNA can be broken via acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. Purine bases can be ejected under weakly acidic conditions, while pyrimidines require stronger acidity in order to be cleaved. Purines may even be removed at neutral pH, if temperature increases sufficiently.\nAP site formation can also be caused by various base-modifying chemicals. Alkylation, deamination, and oxidation of individual bases can all lead to the weakening of the glycosyl bond, so exposure to agents that cause those modifications can encourage AP site formation.\n\nIonizing radiation can also lead to AP site formation. Irradiated environments contain radicals, which can contribute to AP sites in multiple ways. Hydroxyl radicals can attack the glycosidic linkages, directly creating an AP site, or make the glycosl bond less favorable by linking to the base or the deoxyribose ring.\n\nEnzymes, namely DNA glycosylases, also commonly create AP sites, as part of the base excision repair pathway. In a given mammalian cell, 5000–10,000 apurinic sites are estimated to form per day. Apyrimidinic sites form at a rate roughly 20 times slower, with estimates at around 500 formation events per day, per cell. At rates this high, it is critical for cells to have a robust repair apparatus in place in order to prevent mutation.\n\nAP sites are extremely reactive. They fluctuate between a furanose ring and an open-chain free aldehyde and free alcohol confirmation. Exposure to a nucleophile can cause a β-elimination reaction, wherein the 3' phosphoester bond is broken, causing a single-stranded break. This reaction can be catalyzed by AP lyase. In the presence of excess reagent, an additional elimination can occur on the 5' side. The free aldehyde can also react with nucleophilic, amine-containing aldehydes. These reactions can further promote phosphoester bond cleavage. Aldehydes containing O-HN groups can serve to stabilize the abasic site by reacting with the aldehyde group. This interaction does not cleave the phosphoester bond.\n\nAP sites in living cells can cause various and severe consequences, including cell death. The single-stranded breaks occurring due to β-elimination require repair by DNA Ligase in order to avoid mutation. When DNA polymerase encounters an abasic site, DNA replication is usually blocked, which may itself lead to a single-stranded or double-stranded break in the DNA helix. In \"E. coli\", when the enzyme manages to bypass the abasic site, an adenine is preferentially incorporated into the new strand. If AP sites in DNA are not repaired, DNA replication cannot proceed normally, and significant mutations can result. If mutations are merely single nucleotide polymorphisms, then the cell can potentially be unaffected. However, if more serious mutations occur, cell function can be severely impaired, growth and division may be impaired, or the cell may simply die.\n\nAP sites are an important feature of the base excision repair pathway. DNA glycosylases first create abasic sites by recognizing and removing modified bases. Many glycosylase variants exist to deal with the multiple ways a base can be damaged. The most common circumstances are base alkylation, oxidation, and the presence of a uracil in the DNA strand. Once an AP site has been successful created, an AP endonuclease catalyzes the breakage of one phosphoester bond, creating a nick in the backbone of the helix. The breakage can be either 3' or 5' of the site, depending on the variant of the enzyme. End processing enzymes then prepare the site for nick \nligation, which is performed by DNA polymerase. The base inserted into the nick is determined by the corresponding base on the opposite strand. The nick is then sealed by DNA ligase.\n"}

The school's primary mission is to provide a specialized education to adolescents and young adults with nonverbal learning disabilities (NLD) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Students matriculate both domestically and internationally, and both boarding and day school programs are available. Its student to faculty ratio is currently approximately 2:1.\n\nThe founding headmaster of Franklin Academy is Frederick Weissbach. The school officially opened in September 2003 with 33 students and currently enrolls approximately 80. It is accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges, and is also a member of the National Association of Independent Schools.\n\nFranklin Academy is designated as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.\n\nEnrollment at Franklin Academy has generally increased with time. Its opening enrollment of 33 students climbed to 57 to start 2005, then 68 in 2006. Since at least 2010, the enrollment total seems to have steadied around 80 students annually, according to statements by both the school and independent organizations. It accepts students who are diagnosed with non-verbal learning disabilities and autism spectrum disorders. The students are boys and girls in grades 8-12 as well as some doing a post-graduate program. According to the school's own website, international students from several countries have also attended Franklin.\n\nTuition at Franklin Academy includes payment for all services at the school, including room and board, counseling, and laundry. As of January 2018, Franklin Academy estimates its total annual tuition to be between $67,000 and $82,000, depending on if a family is granted certain discounts, or whether a student chooses to board or not. These tuition fees have been criticized in the past for being too expensive. Franklin also requires a submission of a recent neuropsychological evaluation during the application process.\n\nStudents at Franklin Academy are divided into \"teams,\" with each team consisting of between 18 and 24 students. Teachers are also assigned to specific teams, and each team is headed by a \"leadership\" group of faculty. The leadership for each team is made up of a counselor who deals with the team's clinical matters, a learning specialist who oversees academic performance and development in the team's students, and a residential dean who is in charge of the team's dormitory structure and residential life. \n\nFranklin Academy's high school program operates on a five-term structure. These terms are referred to as \"quints,\" and each quint is five weeks long. During quints, core academic classes — mathematics, science, humanities, and Individual & Community — are taught, along with a selection of elective options. Individual & Community (I&C) is a class unique to Franklin Academy's curriculum. According to Franklin's website, I&C is a class which focuses on self-awareness, self-care, and social pragmatics in order to equip students with important life skills. Two \"mini-terms\" called \"Intersessions\" also occur. These are two week periods of all-day study in one subject matter. Course offerings during Intersessions are generally more hands-on, project-based, or practical than core academic classes. \n\nIn July, the school runs a Summer Sojourn program which focuses on experiential learning.\n\nThe East Haddam property on which Franklin Academy's campus currently sits was previously home to three other institutions. The first of these was Becket Academy, a residential school for boys aged eight to fifteen established in 1964. The exact year of Becket Academy's closure is unknown, but in 1988 it was merged with the Founders School. The Founders School was a separate residential facility opened in 1992 that closed in 1998 after a brief lifespan due to concerns about its quality of care. Shortly thereafter in 1998, Haddam Hills Academy was incorporated and opened. It served as a residential facility for many students from the Long Lane School of Middletown. Throughout its brief lifetime, Haddam Hills Academy saw numerous incidents of abuse, neglect, suicidal behavior, and alleged criminal behavior by both students and staff, all of which raised serious concern from the Connecticut Department of Children and Families (DCF). In 2001, following an investigation by the DCF as well as significant public attention, Haddam Hills had its license revoked by the DCF and it was closed.\n\nIn November 2001, Franklin Academy was incorporated. In 2002, an administrative team was hired and preparations for opening began. The school was granted approval to operate by the Connecticut Department of Education, and $2.5 million was spent on campus facilities. In September 2003, the school opened with an enrollment of 33 students. As of 2016, that number had grown to around 85.\n\nIn December 2015, Franklin closed on the purchase of its campus property.\n"}

It is known for its dense population of great white sharks and as a whale-watching location.\n\nThe main tourist attraction in Gansbaai since approximately 1995 has been cage diving with great white sharks. It is said that after Kruger National Park, the great white sharks attract some of the highest numbers of tourists to South Africa for any single activity.\n\nKlipgat Cave is located in the Walker Bay Nature Reserve, next to De Kelders, the residential shore area of Gansbaai. As one of only three places in South Africa where such old remains have been excavated, Klipgat Cave is one of the most important historical sites in the Western Cape. The reserve and the cave are open to the public who has a wild card.\n\nThe earliest evidence of the presence of sheep-herding Khoi people (after the hunter-gatherer-\"San\", the original indigenous population of the Western Cape) in the Western Cape has been found in Klipgat Cave as well. Until the arrival of the first white settlers at the end of the 18th century, the Khoi people thrived in this region. An expedition sent by Jan van Riebeeck to the area, described meeting people of the so-called Chainouqua-tribe near Baardskeerdersbos, a rural hamlet, from Gansbaai. The river flowing through the Baardskeerdersbos Valley is still called \"Boesmansrivier\" (Afrikaans for Bushman's river). \"Bushman\" is a name commonly used for the San-people, but will in this case have reflected Khoi-people.\n\nIt was people of Khoi-descent that erected the first permanent settlement in the Gansbaai vicinity. In 1811 fishing-cottages were built under the dense Milkwood Forests in Stanfords Bay near De Kelders.\n\nThe first white settlers in the area were \"trekboere\" (nomadic farmers). They copied the Khoi herding techniques of using a grazing area until it was exhausted, then moving on to greener pastures. The area was big and fertile enough for such purposes. On many of the large farms around Gansbaai, the old and original homesteads and mudstone-houses tell of the days that the white farmers settled down.\nThe troopship HMS \"Birkenhead\" was wrecked off Danger Point in 1852. A barely visible rock from Danger Point (now aptly called \"Birkenhead Rock\") was fatal for the troopship carrying young Welsh, Scottish and English soldiers and their officers and family on their way to Eastern Cape to fight the Xhosa. The \"Birkenhead\" became famous because it was the first shipwreck where the \"women and children first\" protocol was applied. All women and children were saved but 445 of the men, mostly soldiers, perished. Most of the horses swam ashore and were the ancestors of a feral herd that roamed the plains east of Gansbaai until late in the 20th century.\n\nMore than 140 ships have been wrecked and thousands of lives lost between Danger Point and Cape Infanta, to the east of Gansbaai. In 1895, the Danger Point Lighthouse was built, providing more security for the ships in these dangerous waters.\n\nGansbaai was founded, according to local storytellers, in 1881 after 18-year-old fisherman Johannes Cornelis Wessels walked there across the dunes from Stanford and discovered excellent fishing in the area. He settled there, and soon after other families followed suit. The settlers called it \"Gansbaai\" after the colony of Egyptian geese that gathered at the freshwater fountain in the present day Gansbaai Harbor. Up until the 20th century, however, it was little more than a simple fishing village due to its isolation and lack of communication with the outside world.\n\nGansbaai's economy received an economic boost in 1939 when a small factory was built to process sharks' livers for Vitamin A and lubricant, which was in great demand during World War II. After the war, however, demand fell and the few years of prosperity were over.\n\nIt wasn't until local school principal Johannes Barnard persuaded village fishermen to set up the first Fishery Cooperative in South Africa that the economy began to recover. Barnard helped the fishermen obtain capital from the Fisheries Development Corporation, deepen the harbor and establish a modern fish meal factory. It is still believed to be the primary and employment generator in Gansbaai and the canning division is the largest of its kind in the southern hemisphere. The town became a municipality in 1963.\n\nToday, Gansbaai's economy still revolves around its fishing industry, but an increasingly large part of it now comes from tourism. It is considered the great white shark capital of the world, drawing National Geographic Society film crews and researchers from around the globe to study the wildlife. It has also become a popular whale-watching spot for the southern right whale.\n\nThe southern right whale can be seen in large numbers, especially from the rocky shores of De Kelders on Walker Bay. This is also the site of an old whaling station. The lookout platform and the steps leading to it are still standing. Today whales are protected in South Africa.\n\nThe hinterland is known for its vast mountainous landscapes covered with unspoilt vegetation of the Cape Floral Kingdom ('fynbos'). Despite being the smallest of the world's six floral kingdoms, the Cape Floral Kingdom, with 9000 species, is the richest.\n\nGansbaai is home to the annual Reforest Fest in Platbos Forest, the southern most indigenous forest South Africa. The event is focused on restorative measures to rehabilitate the ecosystems that where once there. The event, hosted by environmental group Greenpop and Platbos Reserve is focused on environmental action. The Reforest Fest in the Platbos Forest Reserve serves annually as a prime example of sound wilderness engineering, driven by the social connection of exciting weekend recreation and conservation.\n\nThe original name of Dyer Island was Ilha da Fera (Island of wild creatures), so named by Portuguese seafarers in the 15th century.\n\nDyer Island is the largest of a group of islands about offshore from Gansbaai and less than that from Danger Point peninsula. It is named after Samson Dyer, an emigrant from the USA to the Cape Colony in 1806, who lived on the island collecting guano, which he sold to mainlanders as fertilizer. The island is home to a declining colony of African penguins (ca. 5000 individuals in 2015).\n\nGeyser Rock is a smaller island nearby, and is home to around 60,000 Cape fur seals.\n\nThe shallow channel between the two islands is popularly known as Shark Alley. \n\nDyer Island is a nature reserve and cannot be accessed by the general public.\n\nGansbaai is located in the Overstrand Local Municipality, which falls within the Overberg District Municipality. The Overstrand council governs the southwestern coast of the Overberg, from Pringle Bay to Pearly Beach; its headquarters are in Hermanus but there is an office in Gansbaai.\n\nIn the 2011 census, the population of Gansbaai was recorded as 11,598 people, living in an area of , giving the town a population density of . 45% of the inhabitants described themselves as \"Black African\", 30% as \"Coloured\", and 24% as \"White\". 53% spoke Afrikaans as their first language, 40% spoke Xhosa, 3% spoke English, and 4% spoke some other language.\n\nThere are three public primary schools in Gansbaai: \nA public high school, Gansbaai Academia, was opened in 2010. It has approximately 600 students who are taught in Afrikaans and English.\n\n\n"}

It is the home ground of Raith Rovers, who have played there since 1891. The ground has an all-seated capacity of .\n\nThe ground was opened in 1891 (this is actually when Raith started using it, it has been around longer) and seats . It is located in Kirkcaldy, Fife. The park can clearly be seen from the railway line on the route between Edinburgh and Aberdeen.\n\nThe unusual L-shaped main stand that houses the players dressing facilities and the supporters lounge was designed by the renowned \"Grandstand\" architect Archibald Leitch and was built with part funding from the sale of Alex James to Preston North End in 1925. Other funding came from a loan scheme that was not finally paid off until 1946. The terracing was open to the elements except for a covered enclosure affectionately known as the \"coo shed\" which stood opposite the main stand and ran approximately two-thirds of the length of the pitch. The ash and railway sleeper terracing which surrounded all sides of the ground except the stand enclosure was replaced with new concrete works in the north and south enclosures behind the goals. This work being carried out in the 1950s when a shed was erected at either end to give partial covering to the supporters. Typical of several football grounds of the time the club sold advertising space on the pitched asbestos roofs of the covered areas to companies such as R'bt Hutchison & Co (Youma Bread), The Evening Dispatch, Nelsons Cigarettes and Barnett & Morton Ltd, the local ironmonger who had erected the sheds. Shortly after the above terrace was upgraded, four large floodlighting pylons similar to those at Tynecastle Park were erected to allow evening midweek fixtures to be played all year round. Most of the cost of the above work was covered (as had become the norm) by the sale of assets, the most notable of those being Jackie Stewart to Birmingham City, Jim Baxter to Rangers and Jimmy MacEwan to Aston Villa, the latter deal also leading to Villa travelling north to play in the first match under the new lights.\n\nBarr Construction were appointed to redevelop the stadium. Two 3,370 seat stands with inbuilt floodlight towers behind each goal and a 1000-seat stand to join onto the 1980s railway (new) stand were erected. This work brought the ground capacity up to a creditable 10,700 all seater. During all of the above changes the main pavilion remained totally unchanged with its asbestos roof, concrete steps and wooden seats and benches. A new metal roof and plastic seating were finally installed in 1999 which slightly reduced the spectator capacity to 8,473. As of the 2017/2018 season the railway stand is to be converted into a standing support section adding to the total capacity which will become 11,198.\n\nIn the 2018 close season, an artificial pitch was laid.\n\nThe ground is often referred to by fans as the \"San Starko\", in jesting reference to the San Siro.\n\n\n"}

Originally released for the Atari 8-bit computers in 1982, it was ported to the VIC-20, Commodore 64, TRS-80 Color Computer, TI-99/4A, and IBM PC. Several of these ports were made by Atarisoft. According to Ihor Wolosenko, co-founder of Synapse, \"Shamus\" made the company famous by giving it a reputation for quality. It was followed by a sequel, \"\", with the same characters but different gameplay.\n\nMataga's original version is 16K in size and was released on disk and tape for the Atari 8-bit family, and later sold by Atari on cartridge following the launch of the Atari XEGS in 1987. The VIC-20 port is 8K and contains only 32 levels, unlike the 128 in every other version. In 1999, Mataga developed a remake for the Game Boy Color, and later, both \"Shamus\" and \"Shamus: Case II\" for iOS.\n\n\"Funeral March of a Marionette\", the theme song from \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\", plays on the title screen.\n\nInspired by the arcade game \"Berzerk\", the objective of the game is to navigate the eponymous robotic detective through a 4-skill level, 128-room maze of electrified walls. The ultimate goal at the end of this journey is \"The Shadow's Lair\". \"Shamus\" differs from \"Berzerk\" in that there's a persistent world instead of rooms that are randomly generated each time they are entered. There are also items to collect: bottles containing extra lives, mystery question marks, and keys which open exits.\n\nOpposing the player are a number of robotic adversaries, including spiral drones, robo droids and snap jumpers. Shamus is armed with \"Ion SHIVs\", SHIV being an acronym for Short High Intensity Vaporizer, and is able to hurl up to two at a time at his enemies. Like many other games in this genre, touching an electrified wall results in instantaneous death. Upon the completion of each level, the gameplay speeds up, increasing the chances of running into a wall.\n\nThe main gameplay involves clearing the room of all enemies, picking up special items on the way and then leaving through an exit. Upon returning to the room, the enemies are regenerated and returned to their original positions. In exactly the same way as \"Berzerk\", the player is attacked if he or she spends too much time in a room. In this case, the Shadow himself emerges from off-screen and hops directly at Shamus, unhindered by the walls. If shot, the Shadow briefly freezes in place.\n\nThe combination of locks and keys requires the player to complete each of its four levels in a particular order. To complete the game in its entirety would take several hours, which combined with the lack of a pause function (except on the IBM version), the necessity of remembering the location of dozens of rooms and keys, and the frenetic gameplay meant that this was extremely difficult to accomplish.\n\nEach maze layout is named after a famous fictional detective or agent.\n\n\"Softline\" in 1983 stated that \"\"Shamus\" is the best cross between arcade and adventure games currently on the Atari market ... To know it is to love it, play it constantly, and not get enough of it\". That year \"Softline\"'s readers named the game seventh on the magazine's Top Thirty list of Atari 8-bit programs by popularity, and in 1984 they named \"Shamus\" in tenth place for 1983. \n\n\"Electronic Fun\" gave the Atari version a 3 out of 5 review, calling the graphics \"superb\" and saying \"this doesn't look like it could ever get boring.\" \"ROM Magazine\" gave the Atari version a 9.4 out of 10 rating, and \"Creative Computing\" suggested \"Make sure you have no pressing appointments before becoming involved in a round of \"Shamus\". Once you get going, you won't want to stop for a while.\" \"Ahoy!\" wrote in 1984 that \"Shamus\" for the Commodore 64 \"is a thoroughly enjoyable game with all the action and suspense that both novices and sophisticated gamers will demand\".\n\nIn 1982, \"Computer Gaming World\" reviewed the Atari original, praising the animation and the \"vastly superior graphics\" over \"Berzerk\", but complaining of the inability to pause the action and of a bug in the speed control. \"Shamus\" was considered \"the most addictive\" of the four games reviewed.\n\nMatthew J. Costello reviewed \"Shamus\" in \"Space Gamer\" No. 68. Costello commented that \"\"Shamus\" is not easy, but the folks at Synapse are giving Atari owners their money's worth.\"\n\n"}

It is situated on the B6195, not far from the A627(M) close to Chadderton Fold and opposite St Matthew's Church near Chadderton Hall Park.\n\nNorth Chadderton County Secondary School was a secondary modern school, which was split into girls' and boys' sections. South Chadderton County Secondary School, another secondary modern, was on \"Butterworth Lane\" in Chadderton.\n\nChadderton Grammar School on Broadway, a mixed school, was officially opened in October 1930 by David Lindsay, 27th Earl of Crawford. It was for 300 pupils from Chadderton, Failsworth, Royton, Crompton and Lees. Extensions to the school were opened in September 1935. By 1950 it had 700 boys and girls, 800 by 1954 and 900 by 1958. In 1957 it was decided to split the school into two single sex schools. In 1959, the boys left for the new grammar school, and the girls stayed at the old site. Parents protested about the move. Chadderton Grammar School for Boys was on Chadderton Hall Road, and concentrated more on science and maths. It had around 600 boys.\n\nIn 1974, the school's administration moved from the Lancashire Education Committee to Oldham MBC, and secondary schools were re-organised in September 1975 and the school became a comprehensive mixed school. The lower school on \"Broadway\" of the North Chadderton secondary modern school was merged with the school.\n\nNorth Chadderton underwent a transformation in 2012-13 by constructing a new school on the same site.

The second series introduces Freesia Yagyu, daughter of Yagui Jubei and self-proclaimed heir to the Lovely Eyepatch. \"The Counter Attack of Siberian Yagyu\" focuses on Jiyu and Freesia's developing friendship and subsequent rivalry.\n\nThe series was broadcast worldwide through Animax. \"The Secret of the Lovely Eyepatch\" was licensed in North America by Bandai Entertainment. The rights to \"The Counter Attack of Siberian Yagyu\" were held by Geneon Entertainment. Both series were licensed by Media Blasters in 2012. The series premiered on Toku in the United States in January 2016.\n\nThe main conflict in is between the Yagyu Jubei and Ryujoji schools. The rivalry was seemingly ended 300 years before the events of the series, when Yagyu Jubei defeated the Ryujoji school champion. Dying from his wounds, Jubei told his loyal companion Koinosuke to find someone with \"plump, bouncy bon bons\" and give her his eyepatch that contained a lifetime's worth of sword techniques. Unknowingly to Koinosuke, the Ryujoji clan plots their revenge.\n\nAfter 300 years of searching, Koinosuke finds Jiyu Nanohana in modern Japan. Her figure makes her the ideal candidate to be the next Jubei. He approaches her and tries to give her the eyepatch but she steadfastly refuses. Only when they are attacked by a Ryujoji swordsman does she don the eyepatch and dispose of him. They eventually find out that the Ryujoji clan believes it will be vindicated once the reincarnation of Jubei is defeated.\n\nThe introductory episodes follow the \"Monster of the Week\" formula, in this case, her teachers and peers constantly challenging her. Later episodes delve into Sai's pain of losing Jiyu's mother, the sacrifice that Jiyu has to make in order to live a double-life as Jubei, and the Ryujoji Family Curse.\n\nLike the previous series, the plot of begins in Yagyu Jubei's lifetime. The Northern Yagyu were driven out of Japan into Siberia by the Edo Yagyu. After living several years in Siberia, they changed their name to the Siberian Yagyu. The leader of the Edo Yagyu sent Jubei Yagyu to assassinate Kita Ressai, the head of the Siberian clan. Jubei did not wish to carry out the order, but traveled to Siberia anyway. During his time there, he fell in love and had a daughter named Freesia. Some time later he caught up with Kita Ressai, the leader he had been sent to assassinate. Over Jubei's objections, Kita Ressai provoked a duel between the two while on a frozen body of water. In the heat of the battle, Kita Ressai broke through the ice, drowning Jubei Yagyu's wife and daughter along with him. Freesia remained frozen in a glacier for 300 years, until global warming caused enough of the glacier to melt to free her.\n\nFreesia then learns of the Lovely Eyepatch that her father left to his successor. Freesia is furious when she learns that the Lovely Eyepatch was not left to her, but rather Jiyu Nanohana. Determined to claim the Lovely Eyepatch as the daughter of Jubei Yagyu, she tracks down Jiyu Nanohana, intent on defeating Jiyu and making her suffer. At the same time, the Siberian Yagyu learn of the appearance of Jubei Yagyu the Second and track down Jiyu Nanohana in an attempt to satisfy their 300-year-old grudge against Jubei Yagyu.\n\nWhat ensues is a three way battle between the Siberian Yagyu, Freesia Yagyu and Yagyu Jubei's successor, Jiyu Nanohana. A major theme of the series is power and how differently people react to it. Jiyu does not want the responsibility and she's afraid to lose herself for power while Freesia does not understand anyone who is not willing to have more power.\n\n\n\"The Secret of the Lovely Eyepatch\"\n\"The Counter Attack of Siberia Yagyu\"\n"}

Kortchmar's work with singer-songwriters such as Linda Ronstadt, James Taylor, David Crosby, Carole King, David Cassidy, Graham Nash, Neil Young, and Carly Simon helped define the signature sound of the singer-songwriter era of the 1970s. Jackson Browne and Don Henley have recorded many songs written or co-written by Kortchmar, and Kortchmar was Henley's songwriting and producing partner in the 1980s.\n\nKortchmar is the son of manufacturer Emil Kortchmar and author Lucy Cores. Kortchmar first came to prominence in the mid-1960s playing with bands in his native New York City, such as The King Bees and The Flying Machine, which included the then-unknown James Taylor (Kortchmar having been a long-time friend of Taylor's; both of them summered in Martha's Vineyard in their teens); in Taylor's autobiographical composition \"Fire and Rain\", the line \"sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground\" is a reference to the breakup of that band. During 1966, Kortchmar traveled to England, where he spent time as a session musician.\n\nIn 1967, Kortchmar joined The Fugs, appearing on their 1968 \"Tenderness Junction\" album before following bassist Charles Larkey to California, where they joined Carole King in forming a trio named The City. The group produced an album in 1968, \"Now That Everything's Been Said\", which received scattered good reviews but was not a commercial success. The group subsequently broke up, but Kortchmar continued backing King on her more successful solo career, including the groundbreaking 1971 album \"Tapestry\". In 1970, Kortchmar reunited with Taylor on his breakthrough album \"Sweet Baby James\". Kortchmar's work with Taylor and King made him one of the top LA session guitarists in the 1970s and 1980s. He toured and recorded extensively with Linda Ronstadt during this time, even appearing in several of her classic 'Get Closer' era music videos. In 1983, he played Linda's love interest in the music video for \"What's New?\".\n\nKortchmar worked on his own, reuniting with Larkey in the band Yo Mama in 1970 and 1971 and recording solo albums \"Kootch\" (1973) and \"Innuendo\" (1980), but he experienced his greatest success backing other artists such as Linda Ronstadt, Warren Zevon, Harry Nilsson and Jackson Browne (when Browne recorded Kortchmar's song \"Shaky Town\" for the \"Running on Empty\" album, Kortchmar sang harmony vocals). In the 1970s he made three albums with Leland Sklar, Russ Kunkel, and Craig Doerge, as The Section.\n\nKortchmar recorded two albums as part of the band Attitudes, with Jim Keltner, David Foster and Paul Stallworth, for George Harrison's Dark Horse record label. The self-titled album \"Attitudes\" included Kortchmar's \"Honey Don't Leave L.A.\" which was recorded by James Taylor. The second album \"Good News\" included several Kortchmar compositions.\n\nHe wrote music for the Cheech & Chong film \"Up in Smoke\" and he has also produced recordings by Don Henley, Neil Young, Jon Bon Jovi, Stevie Nicks, Billy Joel, Hanson, Tracy Chapman, Louise Goffin and others. He is featured on guitar on Carole King's 1975 album, \"Thoroughbred\".\n\nIn 1982 Danny appeared in Linda Ronstadt's popular MTV music video, 'Get Closer'. He also appeared with Linda when she performed on the twenty-fifth anniversary Grammy Awards telecast. He appeared again in Ronstadt's 'What's New' music video the following year.\n\nHe had a cameo as Ronnie Pudding (Spinal Tap's bass player in their early years) in the \"Gimme Some Money\" video segment of the 1984 mockumentary \"This Is Spinal Tap\".\n\nIn 1984, he co-produced and played on Don Henley's album \"Building the Perfect Beast\". On that album, he wrote the songs \"You're Not Drinking Enough\" and \"All She Wants To Do Is Dance\". Also on that album, he co-wrote the songs \"You Can't Make Love\", \"Man with a Mission\", \"Not Enough Love in the World\", \"Building the Perfect Beast\", \"Sunset Grill\", and \"Drivin' With Your Eyes Closed\".\n\nIn 1989, he co-produced and played on Don Henley's album \"The End of the Innocence\". Also on that album, he co-wrote the songs \"How Bad Do You Want It?\", \"I Will Not Go Quietly\", \"New York Minute\", \"Shangri-La\", \"Little Tin God\", and \"If Dirt Were Dollars\".\n\nIn 1990, he co-produced and played on Jon Bon Jovi's # 1 album Blaze of Glory. In 1993, he co-produced and played on Billy Joel's album \"River of Dreams\"\n\nHe was brought on board to produce Van Halen's abandoned second album with former Extreme singer Gary Cherone in 1999. \n\nDanny Kortchmar mentored children's musician Mister G and recorded some of his early demos.\n\nKortchmar started a new group, the Midnight Eleven, in 2004, and the band released its first album in 2005.\n\nIn 2006 he co-produced Hanson's album \"The Walk\", which was released in the U.S. in the summer of 2007.\n\nAlso in 2006, Kortchmar participated in the Japan tour of the Verbs, a unit consisting of Steve Jordan and Jordan's wife, Meegan Voss.\n\nRecently, Kortchmar has formed the group \"Slo Leak\" playing primarily blues rock on 2 cds.\n\nIn 2010 Kortchmar joined the Troubadour Reunion Tour supporting Taylor and King along with Section bandmates Lee Sklar and Russ Kunkel.

The species was first described from Germany. It prefers cool, moist mixed or evergreen forests and rock crevices on alpine slopes, often growing on rotting logs and tree stumps and rocky slopes. It is characteristically riparian in nature, and is especially associated with stream banks.\n\nIt has a stout, woody, creeping or ascending stock with large, green lacy fronds typically and rarely long. The deltate fronds are bipinnate at the base, pinnate toward the apex. The rhizome is erect or ascending, often producing offshoots. Sori occur medially on the underside of the pinnae. Propagation is by spores and vegetatively by division of the rhizome.\n\nIt is easily confused with the related \"Dryopteris dilatata\" (broad buckler fern), differing in the usually smaller fronds, and in the pale brown scales on the frond stem being more uniform in color, rarely having a dark central stripe. It also differs in cytology in having 2n = 82 chromosomes (164 in \"D. dilatata\"). Leaves of \"D. expansa\" are very similar to those of \"D. arguta\".\n\nThe species name of this fern, \"expansa\", is from the Latin \"expando\", meaning \"to spread out, spread apart, to expand\". Other common names include northern wood fern, arching wood fern, spiny wood fern and crested wood fern.\n\nThe root contains filicin, a substance that paralyses tapeworms and other internal parasites and has been used in herbal medicine as a worm expellent.\n\n"}

It was a branch of the UK's national museum of applied arts, the Victoria and Albert Museum. It opened in 1974, and closed in 2007, being replaced by new galleries at the V&A's main site in South Kensington.\n\nThe Theatre Museum told the story of the performing arts in Britain from the sixteenth century to the present. It covered all the live performing arts including drama, dance, opera, musical theatre, circus, puppetry, music hall and live art. It claimed to have the largest collections of documents and artefacts on these subjects in the world. Costumes, designs, manuscripts, books, video recordings, including the National Video Archive of Performance, posters and paintings were used to reconstruct the details of past performances and the lives of performers, past and contemporary.\n\nThe museum received its main funding from the British government via the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, and admission was free.\n\nThe origins of the museum can be traced back to 1911 when collector Gabrielle Enthoven began a campaign for the creation of a \"National Museum of Theatre Arts\". The Victoria & Albert Museum accepted custodianship of Enthoven's collection in 1924, and she continued to add to it until her death in 1950.\n\nIn 1971 Harry R. Beard donated his collection of over 20,000 theatrical and operatic prints, texts, and programmes. The Theatre Museum was created as a separate institution in 1974 when the two collections held by the V&A were combined with those of the \"British Theatre Museum Association\", which had been founded in 1957 to collect theatrical material to increase the impetus for the creation of a separate national museum, and of the \"Friends of the Museum of Performing Arts\", another private endeavour towards the creation of a theatrical museum, which owned much Ballets Russes material.\n\nThe new museum acquired many further collections through gift, purchase and bequest. These included the archives of the English Stage Company at the Royal Court Theatre and of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company (relating to Gilbert and Sullivan operas), the design collections of the Arts Council and British Council, the \"Antony Hippisley Coxe Circus Collection\" and the \"British Model Theatre and Puppet Guild Collection\". In 1987 the Museum moved into converted premises in Covent Garden. In the 1990s it placed renewed emphasis on the acquisition of 20th century material. In 1993 the National Video Archive of Stage Performance (later renamed National Video Archive of Performance) filmed its first production, Richard III starring Ian McKellan. The collection included over 200 productions by 2008.\n\nOn 26 September 2006, it was announced that the museum would close in January 2007 because of a lack of funds. A group called \"The Guardians of The Theatre Museum\" was formed in late Autumn 2006, by the theatre community, to try to support the museum.\n\nIn December 2006, it was announced that the Victoria and Albert Museum and Blackpool Council were in discussions to move the archives to Blackpool, where a new National Museum of Performing Arts would be located. The reasons given by the local council are that Blackpool has a strong theatre history, has one of the most diverse and thriving theatre districts in the UK and also houses the National Theatre of Variety.\n\nOn 7 January 2007, after failing to raise £5 million for refurbishment of the premises in Covent Garden, the closure of the museum was confirmed.\n\nThe Theatre Museum was temporarily called the V&A Theatre Collections and has moved permanently to the Victoria and Albert Museum. The department has contributed to the exhibitions \"Collaborators: UK Design for Performance 2003–2007\" (in association with the Society of British Theatre Designers), \"Kylie – The Exhibition\" and \"The Story of the Supremes\". From March 2009, to coincide with the opening of new Performance Galleries within the V&A, it became the Theatre & Performance Department. The collections will continue to be displayed in touring exhibitions and object loans worldwide. The reading room remains open to researchers at Blythe House, Kensington Olympia.

The controversy surrounding the book, as well as the young age of its author, contributed to make it a huge bestseller in Italy and the novel was translated in many languages and published across the rest of Europe, in Brazil and Korea.\n\nA film based on the novel, titled \"Volevo i pantaloni\", came out in 1990.\n\nIn 1991 she wrote \"Intorno a Laura\", a novel based on an original structure which combines the traditional novel structure and that of theatrical drama, showing she was able to experiment new solutions and themes.\n\n\"Fedra se ne va\" and \"Una ragazza normale\" followed, in 1992 and 1994 respectively, but none of them matched the enormous success of her first book.\n\nIn 1995, perhaps in the effort of renewing her success as a writer, she wrote the sequel to her first novel: \"Volevo i pantaloni 2\".\n\nShe then changed publisher, leaving Mondadori for Rizzoli.

{"id": "1929037", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1929037", "title": "Haploinsufficiency", "text": "Haploinsufficiency\n\nHaploinsufficiency in genetics describes a model of dominant gene action in diploid organisms, in which a single copy of the standard (so-called wild-type) allele at a locus in heterozygous combination with a variant allele is insufficient to produce the standard phenotype. Haploinsufficiency may arise from a \"de novo\" or inherited loss-of-function mutation in the variant allele, such that it produces little or no gene product (often a protein). Although the other, standard allele still produces the standard amount of product, the total product is insufficient to produce the standard phenotype. This heterozygous genotype may result in a non- or sub-standard, deleterious, and (or) disease phenotype. Haploinsufficiency is the standard explanation for dominant deleterious alleles. \n\nIn the alternative case of haplosufficiency, the loss-of-function allele behaves as above, but the single standard allele in the heterozygous genotype produces sufficient gene product to produce the same, standard phenotype as seen in the homozygote. Haplosufficiency accounts for the typical dominance of the “standard” allele over variant alleles, where the phenotypic identity of genotypes heterozygous and homozygous for the allele defines it as dominant, \"versus\" a variant phenotype produced by only by the genotype homozygous for the alternative allele, which defines it as recessive. \n\nHaploinsufficiency can occur through a number of ways. A mutation in the gene may have erased the production message. One of the two copies of the gene may be missing due to a deletion. The message or protein produced by the cell may be unstable or degraded by the cell.\n\nA haploinsufficient gene is described as needing both alleles to be functional in order to express the wild type. One can not describe a mutation as haploinsufficient; instead, one may describe a gene as being haploinsufficient if a mutation in that gene causes a loss of function and if the loss-of-function phenotype is inherited in a recessive manner relative to the wild-type allele.\n\nThe alteration in the gene dosage, which is caused by the loss of a functional allele, is also called allelic insufficiency. An example of this is seen in the case of Williams syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by the haploinsufficiency of genes at 7q11.23. The haploinsufficiency is caused by the copy-number variation (CNV) of 28 genes led by the deletion of ~1.6 Mb. These dosage-sensitive genes are vital for human language and constructive cognition.\n\nAnother example is the haploinsufficiency of telomerase reverse transcriptase which leads to anticipation in autosomal dominant dyskeratosis congenita. It is a rare inherited disorder characterized by abnormal skin manifestations, which results in bone marrow failure, pulmonary fibrosis and an increased predisposition to cancer. A null mutation in motif D of the reverse transcriptase domain of the telomerase protein, hTERT, leads to this phenotype. Thus telomerase dosage is important for maintaining tissue proliferation.\n\nA variation of haploinsufficiency exists for mutations in the gene \"PRPF31\", a known cause of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa. There are two wild-type alleles of this gene—a high-expressivity allele and a low-expressivity allele. When the mutant gene is inherited with a high-expressivity allele, there is no disease phenotype. However, if a mutant allele and a low-expressivity allele are inherited, the residual protein levels falls below that required for normal function, and disease phenotype is present.\n\nCopy-number variation (CNV) refers to the differences in the number of copies of a particular region of the genome. This leads to too many or too few of the dosage sensitive genes. The genomic rearrangements, that is, deletions or duplications, are caused by the mechanism of non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR). In the case of the Williams Syndrome, the microdeletion includes the \"ELN\" gene. The hemizygosity of the elastinis is responsible for supravalvular aortic stenosis, the obstruction in the left ventricular outflow of blood in the heart. \n\nThese include:\n\n"}

Macy's announced March 10, 2006, that the store would be closed on June 1, but it actually shut its doors on May 23, 2006.\n\nOn February 1, 2006, the former May Company divisions were dissolved and operating control of the Strawbridge's stores was assumed by Macy's East. On September 9, 2006, the Strawbridge's and Hecht's nameplates were completely phased-out in favor of Macy's.\n\nStrawbridge & Clothier began as a dry goods store founded by Quakers Justus Clayton Strawbridge (1838–1911) and Isaac Hallowell Clothier (1837–1921) in Philadelphia in 1868. Strawbridge & Clothier purchased the 3-story brick building on the northwest corner of Market and 8th Streets in Center City Philadelphia that had been Thomas Jefferson's office from 1790 to 1793 while he served as Secretary of State, and opened their first store. They soon replaced the old building with one of 5 stories, and then expanded into neighboring buildings as well.\n\nIn 1928, the company decided to replace all but one of its buildings with a new edifice, and began construction in phases on the 13-story building which stands on the corner of Market and North 8th Street today. Designed in the Beaux Arts-style by the Philadelphia architectural firm Simon & Simon, the cost of the limestone building was expected to be $6.5 million, an amount which caused some concern to the store's owners. By the time of the ribbon-cutting in 1931 in the depth of the Great Depression, the staggering $10 million cost of such grand construction nearly suffocated the cash-strapped company.\n\nThe building subsequently became the eastern anchor in 1977 of The Gallery, an urban mall connecting Strawbridge & Clothier with Gimbels, which had relocated from across Market Street to join the mall. It was the vision of S&C Chairman Stockton Strawbridge that was instrumental in revitalizing the Market East retail district in the 1970s, a vision that is still apparent today despite the demise of both Gimbels and Strawbridge's. He once said that his goal was to transform fading east Market Street into \"the \"Champs-Élysées\" of Philadelphia.\"\n\nAfter successfully fighting off a hostile takeover attempt by Ronald S. Baron in 1986, Strawbridge & Clothier survived as an independent, locally owned department store into the 1990s. In 1995, in an attempt to become the dominant retailer in the Philadelphia region, S&C partnered with Federated Department Stores, Pomeroys, and the Rubin Brothers real estate development company to acquire their rival Wanamaker's, but were outbid in bankruptcy court by May Department Stores Company. Subsequently, the 13 Strawbridge & Clothier department stores were themselves bought by May Department Stores Company in 1996, when the Strawbridge & Clothier directors (mostly members of the Strawbridge and Clothier families) elected to liquidate operations over the vehement objections of patriarch Stockton Strawbridge. Strawbridge died not long after the sale. \"He was the store, and the store was him,\" said his attorney Peter Hearn to the \"Philadelphia Daily News\". Store employees and the public-at-large felt a sense of loss as well: many employees rushed to pay off their credit card accounts in full before the sale was finalized, \"hoping that the proceeds would go to the founding families rather than [the new buyers].\"\n\nAt the time of the acquisition by May, it retained the Strawbridge's name, and the Philadelphia area Hecht's stores – the former John Wanamaker locations – also adopted the name. However, the Strawbridge & Clothier head office was closed and its operations were consolidated with Hecht's in Arlington, Virginia. After the sale, the stores operated simply as \"Strawbridge's\", although exterior signage reading \"Strawbridge & Clothier\" remained in place at many locations until the stores became Macy's in 2006.\n\nFor 13 years, from 1922 to 1935, the store operated WFI, an AM radio station. In 1935, the station merged with WLIT, owned by the Lit Brothers store across the street, to form WFIL, an NBC Blue network affiliate. WFIL remains on the air today on its original frequency, AM 560.\n\nIn May 1930, Strawbridge & Clothier helped remake the American retail scene by opening one of the first suburban branch department stores in the nation, located in the Suburban Square shopping center in Ardmore, Pennsylvania.[9] In 1931, it followed with its second suburban \"satellite\" store at Jenkintown, Pennsylvania, the building for which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.[10] Strawbridge's opened up a number branch stores throughout Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware. These branch stores typically were opened in shopping malls. Prominent stores throughout the Philadelphia area included the stores in Jenkintown, Pennsylvania, Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania, Bensalem Township, Pennsylvania, Exton, Pennsylvania, and Wilmington, Delaware. By the 1970s, Strawbridge's had nearly a dozen branch stores in malls across eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey, and northern Delaware. The branches proved to have been a wise step, as the flagship store posted only a few years of actual profitability, all of them during the 1940s.[4] In 1969, Strawbridge set his sights on competing with the emerging Target-grade retailers,[6] launching the Clover discount store chain; the first Clover store opened in 1971. Located in strip centers rather than malls for the most part, Clover grew to have 26 locations, more than the 21 full-service S&C stores. Most Clover stores closed in the winter of 1997.\n\nSome Strawbridge's stores had restaurants inside, like at Christiana Mall in Newark, Delaware as well as the Strawbridge & Clothier store at Exton Square Mall. The Jenkintown store also had a restaurant. The company also revolutionized retailing with their introduction of revolving charge account cards. Strawbridge's was well known for its handled shopping bags which kept up with the fashion of each era. It was a paper bag, with navy blue handles with Strawbridge's printed in blue twice and red once on one side of the bag, and vice versa on the other. Once May assumed the company, the Strawbridge & Clothier Seal of Confidence was no longer a prominent marketing image. Late 1970s and 1980s bags were a bright glossy yellow with that era's pseudo calligraphic trademark in a vertical orientation in black along the bag's edge. 1960s bags featured a \"modern\" script-like trademark with their famous \"seal of confidence\". Strawbridge's was also known for its friendly employees. In the center of the flagship store was a large bronze statue of a wild boar, a replica of Pietro Tacca's \"Il Porcellino\". The legend had it that good luck would follow those who rubbed the boar's nose. The boar consequently had a very shiny nose from all the rubbing.\n\nIn July 2006, The Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust (PREIT), owners of The Gallery at Market East, agreed to purchase the lower floors of the flagship Strawbridge's store. PREIT sought retail tenants for the areas of the building closest to street level and converted some higher floors to office space. The uppermost floors had previously been sold and converted to offices; they are currently owned by American Financial Realty Trust of Jenkintown.\n\nOn February 26, 2009, it was announced that the developers of Foxwoods Casino Philadelphia were looking into locating their new casino on three floors of the former Strawbridge's flagship store currently owned by PREIT.\n\nIn April 2012, it was reported by one of the sub-contractors that the building was undergoing additional renovation for both office and residential use. In July 2012, \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\" and \"Philadelphia Daily News\" relocated to the third floor of the building from their former headquarters at 400 North Broad Street.\n\nOn October 23, 2014, the Century 21 Department Store company of New York City opened its first location outside of the greater New York City area on a portion of the street level, and the entire second level of the Strawbridge building.\n\n\n"}

Kennedy International Airport, New York; Richmond, Virginia; Charlotte, North Carolina; and Greenville, South Carolina. On the night of February 8, 1965, the aircraft serving the flight, a Douglas DC-7, crashed near Jones Beach State Park, New York, just after taking off from JFK Airport. All 79 passengers and five crew aboard perished.\n\nThe Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) investigation determined that evasive maneuvers undertaken by Flight 663 to avoid an oncoming Pan Am Boeing 707 caused the pilot to suffer spatial disorientation and lose control of the aircraft. The accident is the third-worst accident involving a DC-7.\n\nThe Douglas DC-7 serving Flight 663 made its first flight in 1958, and had subsequently accumulated a total of 18,500 hours of flight time. It was piloted by Captain Frederick R. Carson, 41, who had been employed by Eastern Air Lines for 19 years and who had accumulated 12,607 hours of flight time. His copilot, First Officer Edward R. Dunn, 41, a nine-year veteran of Eastern Airlines, had 8,550 hours of flight time. The flight engineer was Douglas C. Mitchell, 24, with two years' employment and 407 pilot hours and 141 hours flight engineer time. All had passed proficiency checks with the DC-7B aircraft. The two flight attendants aboard were Linda Lord and Judith Durkin.\n\nThe flight from Logan International Airport in Boston, Massachusetts, to John F. Kennedy International Airport, in New York, proceeded normally. Flight 663 departed JFK at 6:20 p.m. EDT on an instrument flight rules (IFR) clearance to Byrd Field (now Richmond International Airport), in Richmond, Virginia. Take-off proceeded normally, and \nthe airport control-tower prepared to hand over control to the New York Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) on Long Island, noting that Flight 663 was executing a \"Dutch seven departure\", a routine takeoff procedure that required a series of turns over the Atlantic Ocean in order to avoid flying over New York City. The New York ARTCC responded with the information that Pan American Airways Flight 212, a Boeing 707, was descending to in the same airspace.\n\nThough the control tower responded that Flight 663 was at a higher altitude than Flight 212, it was, in fact, lower. Subsequently, the control tower radioed the Pan Am flight that there was traffic in his airspace at \"11 o'clock\", six miles away travelling southeast of Pan Am's position, climbing above . Pan Am 212 acknowledged. Air traffic control then radioed Flight 663 a similar advisory: at \"2 o'clock\", five miles away travelling, below Flight 663's position. In reality, the traffic, Pan Am 212, was above Flight 663, descending from . Captain Carson acknowledged that he saw the traffic, that he was beginning to turn into the Dutch seven departure, and signed off, saying, \"good night\".\n\nFlight 663's radioed \"good night\" at 6:25 p.m. was the last transmission received from the flight.\n\nThe night of February 8 was dark, with no visible moon or stars, and no visible horizon. As the two airliners approached similar positions, their pilots had no points of reference with which to determine actual separation distance or position. Flight 663's departure turn, and Pan Am's subsequent turn left to its assigned heading, had placed the two aircraft on an apparent collision course. The Boeing rolled right and initiated a descent in an attempt to avoid a collision. In response, Eastern 663 initiated an extreme right turn in order to pass safely. The captain of Pan Am 212 later estimated that the two aircraft had passed between of each other, while the first officer estimated that the distance was only .\n\nFlight 663 was unable to recover from its unusually steep bank and plunged into the icy waters of the Atlantic Ocean, where it exploded with bright orange flames. The Pan American 707 was the first to relay news of the crash, as it was receiving permission to land. Air Canada Flight 627, which had departed a few minutes prior to Flight 663, also radioed news of an explosion in the water.\n\nAfter the initial explosion, the wrecked aircraft sank to the bottom in of water. Numerous air crews, including Pan Am 212, Air Canada 627, and Braniff Airlines Flight 5, radioed ATC controllers in the area with news of an explosion. The aircraft broke up upon impact, and was destroyed. All five crewmembers and 79 passengers died on impact.\n\nFifteen ships, accompanied by eleven helicopters and numerous rescue divers converged on the scene of the crash in hopes of rendering aid to survivors. Two hours after impact, debris began floating up to the surface. By sunrise, seven bodies had been recovered; three more were discovered in the course of the following three days. In locating the wreckage, the United States Navy provided underwater sonar to assist with the operation. Thirteen Coast Guard vessels helped searching the shores of Long Island and provided salvage efforts. Rescue workers and volunteers scoured of beaches, collecting debris that washed ashore.\n\nThe Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) investigated the accident. The DC-7 was not required to be equipped with a flight recorder, which would have automatically recorded the pilots' every control input. Thus, the CAB was forced to rely on witness testimony, radio recordings, and a best guess based on experience. Nevertheless, the CAB determined that the evasive maneuvers taken by the pilot of Flight 663 in order to avoid the oncoming Pan Am jet caused spatial disorientation. The disorientation, coupled with the extreme maneuver, made it impossible for the pilot to recover from the roll in the few seconds remaining before the DC-7 crashed into the Atlantic Ocean. The CAB also determined that Captain Carson had neither the time nor adequate information to assess Flight 663's position relative to Pan Am 212 and, given the illusion of a collision course, he had acted appropriately in initiating evasive maneuvers. The CAB made no recommendations in the final accident report. Although early news reports reported the near miss of Flights 663 and 212, the FAA denied that there was ever any danger of a collision.\n\nAt that time, the crash of Flight 663 was the fifth worst aviation accident to have occurred in the United States. It is the third deadliest crash of a DC-7 (after Caledonian Airways Flight 153 and Northwest Airlines Flight 293), and is the 25th deadliest single-plane accident to have occurred in the United States.\n\n"}

Rat carcasses were filled with plastic explosives, and were to be distributed near German boiler rooms, where it was expected they would be disposed of by burning, with the subsequent explosion having a chance of causing a boiler explosion.\n\nThe explosive rats never saw use, as the first shipment was intercepted by the Germans; however, the resulting search for more booby trapped rats consumed enough German resources for the SOE to conclude that the operation was a success.\n\nDuring World War II, the British Special Operations Executive procured about a hundred rodents for medical experiments. The rodents were killed and plastic explosives sewn inside them.\n\nThe idea, developed in 1941, was that when the dead rat was discovered in the boiler room of a locomotive, factory, power station, or similar installation, the stoker tending the boiler would dispose of the unpleasant discovery by shoveling it into the furnace, causing the booby trapped rat to explode. A rat could contain only a small amount of explosive; however, a penetration of a highly pressurized steam boiler could trigger a devastating boiler explosion. A rat bomb could also be set with a delayed fuse.\n\nThe first shipment of carcasses was intercepted by the Germans, and the SOE plan was dropped. The Germans exhibited the rats at top military schools and conducted searches for further exploding rats. The SOE concluded: \"The trouble caused to them was a much greater success to us than if the rats had actually been used.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "1929122", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1929122", "title": "Eastern Air Lines Flight 512", "text": "Eastern Air Lines Flight 512\n\nEastern Air Lines Flight 512 was a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Charlotte, North Carolina, to New York City that crashed on November 30, 1962, killing 25 of the 51 people on board. The aircraft, a Douglas DC-7B operated by Eastern Air Lines, crashed at Idlewild Airport in heavy fog while attempting to perform a go-around. One of the plane's wings struck the ground and the plane crashed into soft sand in a marsh about from the runway, where it burst into flames. Emergency equipment responded, but rescuers were delayed by the thick fog and the soft terrain. An investigation launched after the crash found that the probable cause of the accident was that the pilots had made critical mistakes during the go-around that prevented the aircraft from gaining altitude.\n\nThe flight left Charlotte Municipal Airport at 7:41p.m. Eastern Standard time en route to Idlewild Airport in New York City. Federal Aviation Agency (FAA) notifications had made the crew aware that the precision approach radar system at the airport was out of service. The weather forecast called for clear skies or scattered clouds. While the flight was en route, patches of ground fog started developing at Idlewild. At 8:57p.m., the pilots were advised that there would be a delay of an undetermined length due to the fog. The flight entered a holding pattern until 9:33p.m. when it was instructed to enter the approach path to runway 4R. Other aircraft landing ahead of the flight reported dense fog at ground level with extremely low visibility; pilots of one flight that had been cleared to take off requested a delay because the fog was too dense for safe operation. Runway visual range instruments in the United States Weather Bureau office at the airport recorded visibility that had dropped to virtually zero shortly before the instruments failed completely, but this information was not communicated to the tower personnel. As a result, the pilots of inbound aircraft were not made aware of the reduced visibility. Instead, the tower reported visibility of , although flight crews would have likely heard radio traffic from other pilots describing the poor conditions. Rules that were in effect at the airport required a visibility of at least feet for a runway to remain open.\n\nAs Flight 512 approached the runway, the pilots descended to as low as 25 feet above the ground, about feet beyond the touchdown point on the runway, when the crew decided to abandon the approach. They retracted the landing gear and changed the flaps setting from 40 degrees to 20 degrees, and rotated the nose of the aircraft to between 3 and 5 degrees above the level position. Because they had retracted the flaps without adding additional engine power, the aircraft lost lift and struck the ground. \n\nThe fuselage separated from the wings on a mound of earth approximately high, located down the runway. The fuel tanks in the left wing ruptured, igniting a fire on the ground. The fuselage broke apart approximately at the divider between the tourist and first class sections. At 9:45p.m., tower personnel saw a bright orange flash and initiated emergency procedures. American Airlines Flight 8, which was on approach immediately after Flight 512 was instructed to overfly the runway to see if they could see what had happened. The flight reported back that they could see a fire to the left of the runway.\n\nAfter the crash, emergency vehicles were dispatched to the accident site, but they were delayed by the thick fog and the soft marshy terrain where the aircraft ended up. One ambulance driver reported that visibility was as low as , which made it difficult to locate the crash victims. The arrival of some of the emergency vehicles was delayed by slow-moving traffic on nearby roads. Police prevented all but emergency traffic from entering the area, but curious onlookers still caused traffic congestion in the area. Many were seen walking around the perimeter of the airport, having left their vehicles on surrounding roads. The airport was closed to air traffic until 7:10a.m. the following morning.\n\nSurvivors said that the plane burst into flames immediately after the crash. While the rear section of the fuselage remained relatively intact, other sections of the fuselage, engine parts, and broken pieces of propellers, were scattered around the crash site.\n\nMany of the survivors were thrown clear of the aircraft when it hit the ground, still strapped to their seats. Others climbed out of the broken fuselage and were assisted by the two flight attendants to safety. Victims were taken to the airport's medical center, Peninsula General Hospital, or Queens General Hospital. Two victims had critical injuries, while others were less seriously injured.\n\nThe aircraft was a Douglas DC-7B four-engined passenger aircraft. It was manufactured in September 1956 and had manufacturer's serial number 45084. It was registered by Eastern Airlines with tail number N815D and had a total flying time of 18,411 hours at the time of the crash. It was powered by four Wright model 972TC18DA piston propeller engines.\n\nThe captain of the flight was Edward Bechtold, aged 43. He had been employed at Eastern Air Lines since April 1945 and had logged a total of 15,644 hours of flight time, including 2,700 on the DC-7 type aircraft. In 1943, he received the Air Medal for meritorious achievement from Lieutenant General George C. Kenney, commander of Allied air forces in the Southwest Pacific. He was the chairman of the New York Air Safety Committee. The copilot was Julius Wagner, aged 45. He had been employed at the airline since March 1951 and had accumulated a total of 9,042 hours of flight time, including 1,610 hours in the DC-7. The flight engineer was Robert Voorhees, age 31. He had accumulated a total of 4,080 hours of flight time, which included 149 hours as a flight engineer and 718 hours as a pilot in DC-7 aircraft. He had been employed at the airline since August 1957. All three pilots were killed in the crash.\n\nThe two flight attendants, Helen Fournier, aged 21, and Patricia Richards, aged 22, survived the crash and assisted with the evacuation of survivors of the crash. They were credited with saving the lives of people who might have otherwise died in the fire that consumed the aircraft after the crash. Fournier had started her employment with Eastern Air Lines in April 1962, and was on only her third flight at the time of the crash.\n\nThe plane carried 51 passengers at the time of the crash. All of the passengers were from the United States except one, who was from Canada. Twenty one of the passengers were killed, and some of the survivors were injured. All of the survivors were seated in the rear half of the plane, which remained intact long enough for them to escape.\n\nA team of 80 flight experts, including a team of 24 from the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB), began an investigation, supervised by G. Joseph Minetti and assisted by George A. Van Epps, supervisory air safety investigator for the New York Region. The overall investigation was directed by Arthur E. Newsmann, the person in charge of the Denver office.\n\nOn October 10, 1963, the CAB released its final accident report. In it, they found that the probable cause of the accident was the technique employed by the crew during their abandonment of the aircraft's approach in the unexpected fog conditions. The board concluded that if the crew had either rotated the aircraft to a higher nose-up position, or had used more engine power, the plane's descent would have been arrested and the accident avoided.\n"}

He played English county cricket for Sussex, Warwickshire and Somerset. He is a former Hong Kong sports personality of the year, gained for his cricketing efforts in that country.\n\nReeve was born in Hong Kong in 1963 to parents who were working in the territory as teachers. His mother, Monica, later served as a scorer for a number of England Test matches. He also played for KJS football team alongside captain of the team Steven Markbreiter, who now coaches the Hong Kong based team Sai Kung Bulldogs.\n\nReeve first played cricket in England as a member of the Marylebone Cricket Club Young Cricketers – an academy of up and coming young players between the ages of 18 and 20, who are based at Lord's. He signed for Sussex in June of the 1983 English season, and took 42 wickets in the County Championship at 29.35 apiece. He was given little opportunity with the bat, batting at number 10, but performed the duties of night watchman. This helped Reeve show his batting ability when, as night watchman, he made his maiden first class hundred against Surrey at Guildford. He remained with Sussex for six seasons, his most successful being 1987 when he managed a batting average of over 40, and took 42 wickets at .\n\nHis lack of a high enough batting position at Sussex led to his move to Warwickshire in 1988, and it was here that he gained his greatest successes. In the batsman-friendly summer of 1990 his average was 54 runs. He also made his highest first-class score of 202 not out (against an attack including Curtly Ambrose), and two other centuries on the way to a total of 1,412 runs. He averaged over 40 runs for Warwickshire during his time at the Midlands club proving the move a good decision and helping him gain international selection.\n\nReeve was made captain in 1993, and in 1994 led the county to an unprecedented domestic treble; winning the County Championship, the AXA Equity and Law League, and the Benson & Hedges Cup - though they were defeated in the final of the NatWest Trophy. This achievement came alongside well-publicised differences of opinion with Warwickshire's star batsman, Brian Lara, vividly described a few years later by Reeve in his book \"Winning Ways\". He was known for his inventive cricket brain and once held the bat left handed and swept Ravi Shastri against Glamorgan - today known as the switch hit.\n\nOne of his improvisations against left-arm spinner, Rajesh Maru, of Hampshire was to drop his bat to avoid being caught out by the close fielders.\n\nWarwickshire retained their Championship and NatWest Trophy crowns the following season, but Reeve left Warwickshire halfway through the 1996 season. Reeve made over £400,000 tax free during his benefit year with Warwickshire. Reeve was named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1996, and received the OBE for services to cricket that same year. He moved on to become coach to Somerset (for whom he also played several games in one-day cricket in 1998), and also began to work as a cricket commentator for Channel 4 Television.\n\nReeve played for Hong Kong at the 1982 ICC Trophy, averaging 34.50 with the bat and 15.71 with the ball. He returned to international cricket in 1991, playing for England. Reeve played only three Test matches for England, but his improvising style was better suited to One Day Internationals and he made 29 appearances in this form of the game, appearing in both the 1992 and 1996 World Cups. However, he never scored highly in ODIs, and his batting average would have been considerably lower, but for his high proportion of not-out innings.\n\nFollowing his retirement from cricket, Reeve was involved with the Channel 4 broadcasting coverage of cricket from the start when the channel won the rights from the BBC to show England Tests in the UK. Duties included fronting the studio discussions with pundits, commentary, introducing and presenting awards after televised matches, and interviewing both present and past players. In May 2005, Reeve admitted that he had an addiction to cocaine, and had used the drug prior to commentating on the 2004 first Test between England and New Zealand at Lord's. Reeve duly quit Channel Four after working for five years as part of their commentary team. He also admitted to using marijuana whilst he was an active player for Warwickshire but only out of season.\n\nIn more recent years, Reeve has worked as a commentator on the BBC radio show \"Test Match Special\". He also commentated on the Indian Premier League (IPL) English-language television coverage.\n\nFollowing his cocaine revelations in 2005, Reeve's family built a new life in Australia and New Zealand. Their assets included a $3 million waterfront mansion at Clontarf.\n\nFurther scandal was to follow Reeve at the end of 2009, when he was exposed as a seller of Donald Bradman \"signatures\" on plain card which were later confirmed by the Bradman Museum to be poor copies of the legendary player's signature.\n\nReeve relocated with his family to New Zealand in 2006, and was named as coach of the Central Districts States Team in July 2008. Despite leading the side to the Plunket Shield four-day final in 2008–09, before winning the 2009–10 Twenty20 competition, his tenure as coach was at times controversial - one particular incident seeing him fined and censured for accusing England international Ravi Bopara of ball-tampering during a domestic one-day match. On 7 April 2010, he ended his stint as coach of the by mutual consent to spend time with his family, now living in Sydney, Australia.\n\nHe served as an assistant coach for the Pune Warriors India in the 2011 Indian Premier League.\n\n"}

It was created in Mexico in 1951 and represents the union of all the separate academies in the Spanish-speaking world. The association publishes reference works on the Spanish language and commemorative editions of Hispanic literature, among other publications.\n\nThrough the initiative of then-president of Mexico Miguel Alemán Valdés, the first congress of academies convened with the purpose of maintaining the integrity of and fostering the further growth of Spanish. The meeting was held from 23 April to 6 May 1951 and resulted in the creation of the association and its permanent commission. The Royal Spanish Academy (Spanish: or ) was not present at the initial meeting but participated in the permanent commission. Ever since the second congress convened in 1956, the has been a regular participant.\n\nIn 2000 the association organised the School of Hispanic Lexicography and the Carolina Foundation to promote Spanish lexicography, and together with the , the association earned the Prince of Asturias Award for peace.\n\nAn academy for Equatorial Guinea was created in 2013 and joined the association in 2016.\n\nThe collaboration between and the other academies was expressed in the coauthorship, since the 22nd edition published in 2001, of the Dictionary of the Spanish Language (Spanish: ), and the 1999 edition of the Orthography (Spanish: ) was considered a true pan-Hispanic work. Joint projects include the editing of the Grammar (Spanish: ) and the compilation of the Dictionary of Americanisms (Spanish: ).\n\nThe association convenes every four years, led by a Permanent Commission composed of a President (position held by the Director of the Spanish Royal Academy.), a Secretary General (one of the directors of the other academies), a Treasurer (chosen by the Spanish Royal Academy), and at least two board members drawn from the associated academies, whose nomination rotate annually. During the Third Congress of Academies, held in Bogotá, Colombia, in 1960, an agreement was reached whereby the governments of countries with a member in the association would be obliged to provide financial support to their respective academies and the greater association.\n\nAlthough Israelis mainly speak Hebrew, Arabic, English, and Russian, an ASALE conference on Judaeo-Spanish held in 2015 led to plans for the creation of an Israeli branch. A group of academics was founded by ASALE in 2018 and submitted to the government of Israel for recognition. The National Academia of Judaeo-Spanish in Israel will then have the ability to petition to join as a full member, likely in 2019. There are no plans for Belize, Gibraltar, or Andorra to have their own academies, despite each having a majority Spanish-speaking population either as a first or second language. There is also a substantial Spanish population in Brazil and Western Sahara.\n\n"}

The character appears in particular in \"Young Avengers\", a team of which Iron Lad is a member. He first appeared in \"Young Avengers\" #1 (April 2005), created by writer Allan Heinberg and illustrator Jim Cheung. He is an adolescent version of Kang the Conqueror, armed with a bio-metal suit that responds to mental commands. He is named after the father of Reed Richards.\n\nSixteen-year-old Nathaniel \"Nate\" Richards is rescued by his time-traveling adult self, the villainous Kang the Conqueror, moments before bullies would cause him to be hospitalized for years of his life from a knife attack, an event that originally shaped his development into a villain. Kang takes his teenage self through time to witness the future battles and glory that would result in his transformation into Kang the Conqueror, hoping to inspire his younger self. However, it backfires and Nate is horrified at the life of evil his future self shows him. Kang presses Nate to accept his future by killing the bully who would have hospitalized him. Instead, Nate takes the time travel technology given to him by Kang and transports himself to the past, hoping to avoid his sinister destiny.\n\nHe seeks the Avengers for assistance, but finds the Avengers disbanded. Seeking answers, he downloads the remnants of the destroyed Vision's operating system into his armor. This reveals a fail-safe plan created by the android to reform the Avengers should they disband or fall in action by locating the next generation of Avengers, all of whom have some tie to the original team. Using this plan, Nate assembles his new team, the Young Avengers, with the sole purpose of defeating his future self and reshaping his own future. He models his armor after the Avenger Iron Man, calling himself Iron Lad. He forms a brief romantic relationship with fellow Young Avenger teammate Stature.\n\nEventually, Kang comes to the past looking for Nate, wanting to return his younger self to his proper place in the timestream. Nate refuses to return, unwilling to become the infamous future villain. The team battle the Growing Man, a robot created by Kang, and are able to defeat him. Kang battles the remaining Avengers and the teen heroes, seemingly gaining the upper hand until Iron Lad runs Hawkeye's sword through Kang's chest. This kills Kang, but the ramifications cause several changes to the timeline, including all the Avengers being dead and Young Avengers Wiccan and Hulkling disappearing as well as Jessica Jones losing her baby. Iron Lad realizes that the only way to restore everything is to go back to his time and assume his role as Kang the Conqueror. In doing so he will also lose his memories of his time in the past as a Young Avenger. Before he goes back in time, he asks his teammates to forgive him for the actions he will commit in the future and kisses Stature goodbye. He leaves behind his armor, which has activated the Vision's operating software, effectively recreating the armor into a sentient being—an inexperienced \"young\" Vision. The new Vision carries Nate's brain patterns, similar to the original Vision and Wonder Man.\n\nStature and the Vision eventually feel attracted to one another, due initially to Nate's mental imprint. They later begin a relationship. While fighting the cosmic cube-altered Absorbing Man, during the \"Dark Reign\" storyline, the new Vision (now a joint member of the Young Avengers and the Mighty Avengers) is affected by the cube's cosmic radiation and splits into both Iron Lad and the original Vision. Iron Lad appears to maintain the memories of the events prior to going back in time. After the Absorbing Man is defeated, the original Vision and Iron Lad merge back together as the new Vision once again.\n\nIron Lad appears in the 2010-12 miniseries, \"\", in which he prevents Wolverine from killing an amnesiac and de-powered Wanda Maximoff (whom Wolverine feels presents too great a threat). Iron Lad states that he does this because the future depends on their survival. Soon thereafter, Stature's deceased father Ant-Man (Scott Lang) is plucked from the past and saved, but Stature is killed. Iron Lad insists upon travelling back to the past to save her, and he kills the new Vision when he protests. When the Young Avengers tell Iron Lad that this is most likely the event that will lead him down the path to becoming Kang the Conqueror, he states that \"I will be better than Kang the Conqueror\", and disappears into the timestream.\n\nNate, now going by the name Kid Immortus, later provides information to Doctor Doom regarding the Future Foundation. He is also seen in the company of a young Ravonna.\n\nAfter Doom's plan fails, Iron Lad returns and rescues Captain America from the timestream. He and two of his future counterparts, Kang the Conqueror and Immortus, attempt to hold Captain America prisoner so that he cannot interfere with the Illuminati's plan to save Earth by destroying numerous alternate worlds during the \"Time Runs Out\" storyline, but Captain America manages to escape.\n\nRichards returns once again as Iron Lad in the \"Exiles\" series alongside original member Blink and new members including Wolvie, Sharon Carter and Valkyrie.\n\nNate's Iron Lad armor is composed of neuro-kinetic nano-metal and he can alter its appearance and shape with his thoughts. The armor grants Iron Lad superhuman strength and allows him to fly. It also enables him to fire blasts of various kinds of energy, hack into computer systems, create magnetic fields and travel through time. Kang's psychic link with his armor also enables him to mentally control the Iron Lad armor from a close range.\n\n\n\n"}

It first appeared in \"Project: Twilight\", written by Cavan Scott and Mark Wright. Its agents can sometimes be identified with the use of the code phrase or motto, \"For King and Country.\" \n\nIt is similar to the Torchwood Institute in the television series, though the Forge's introduction in the audio plays predates it.\n\nIn the Sixth Doctor audio play \"Cryptobiosis\", taking place in 1901, the Chief Mate of the cargo ship \"Lankester\" was transporting a captured mermaid to an unknown buyer. However, his use of the \"King and Country\" code phrase during a radio communication implies that the Forge was involved.\n\nThe Forge's first known operations were during World War I. \"Project: Twilight\" involved the infection of human subjects with the so-called Twilight Virus, which incorporated DNA from vampires to create human-vampire hybrids as super-soldiers. However, the test subjects escaped into the community in October 1915 and slaughtered the base personnel. The Forge's chief scientist, Dr William Abberton, was mortally wounded and injected himself with the virus to survive. He then assumed the code name of Nimrod and dedicated himself to tracking down the escaped vampires. The Seventh Doctor, Ace and Hex Schofield encounter the Forge several times. In 1917, they find The Forge running a secret project at Charnage Hospital to brainwash British soldiers into becoming more aggressive, with a possible side effect of making several subjects time-sensitive (No Man's Land). Then in 1945 they find The Forge in Postwar London, trying to recapture alien technology which was stolen after the van carrying it crashed in transit (Forty Five: Casualties of War).\n\n\"Project: Dionysus\" was the next known operation, which took place during the early 1950s, when Dr Stone attempted to create a rift in spacetime, which was almost used by a race known as the Divergence to break through into our reality (\"Zagreus\"). Although there was no explicit mention of the Forge in \"Zagreus\", it was heavily implied that Stone was working for them, as she also uses the \"King and Country\" code phrase.\n\nIn the latter half of the twentieth century, the Forge secretly operated on behalf of British interests, while the international UNIT (which the Forge viewed with contempt) dealt with more public alien threats.\n\nIn \"Project: Twilight\", it is 1999, and Nimrod has tracked down the Twilight vampire ringleaders, Reggie Mead and Amelia Dooney, to the South-East London casino \"Dusk\", established to hide their activities. The Sixth Doctor and Evelyn Smythe befriend casino worker Cassie Schofield and with her help, they learn what they can about Dusk. This is also the point in the Doctor's life when he first learns about the Forge, as well as meeting Nimrod for the first time. Eventually, the vampires infect Cassie with a new and stronger form of the Twilight virus. The Forge's mission ended with the destruction of the casino and the deaths of most of the Twilight vampires. The Doctor offers to take Cassie with him while he tries to create a cure for her infection, but she chooses to stay on Earth. He drops her off in Norway and promises to return.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of \"Project: Twilight\", Nimrod captured Cassie and returned her to the Forge. Over a period of time, she was heavily brainwashed, trained to become a field agent and groomed into becoming Nimrod's replacement as primary northern-European field agent, code-named Artemis. Nimrod was put in charge of a new operation, \"Project: Valhalla\", to scavenge alien technology from a crashed alien spaceship in Lapland. The mission turned into a disaster and the area had to be sterilised when the ship turned out to be a prison for a world-killing Lovecraftian monster known as Nyathoggoth.\n\nAfter this operation, Nimrod replaced former UNIT-head Colonel Crichton as Deputy Director of the Forge and began \"Project: Lazarus\". The Sixth Doctor creates a cure for the Twilight Virus, so he and Evelyn track down Cassie in 2004. Nimrod captures the Doctor and takes DNA samples from him. Evelyn manages to free Cassie from her brainwashing, mostly by reminding her of her child, Tommy, who she hasn't in years. The Doctor and Evelyn race to take Cassie back to the TARDIS to be cured, but Nimrod murders her with his crossbow. After the TARDIS escapes, \"Project: Lazarus\" commences. Using DNA gathered from the Doctor, they attempted to clone him in order to discover the secret of regeneration. They manage to create dozens of clones, physically identical to the Sixth Doctor, but unable to regenerate, no matter how they're killed. Also, the clones don't live for very long. Nimrod dresses the clones like the Doctor and employees them, one at a time, convincing them that they are the real Doctor, reluctantly working with the Forge to stave off an alien invasion. \n\nIt was around this time that Nimrod himself recovered the fabled Spear of Destiny from a private collection in Edinburgh as part of \"Project: Longinus\". At present there is no information of what became of the artifact. Artemis and Nimrod were also responsible for locating and abducting the last member of \"the Gryphus clan\", with Artemis using honeypot methods to accomplish this.\n\nIn 2015, The Forge acquired the leader of a Ukrainian cult who had been possessed by an ancient alien who causes jealousy and obsession in others. The Forge hoped to clone him to use as a distraction in war zones. However, while the train was transporting him, the Seventh Doctor arrived and trapped the creature's consciousness. (\"Project Nirvana\")\n\nMeanwhile, the Seventh Doctor and Ace start traveling with Hex, a young nurse from 2021. While searching through his records, the Doctor realizes that Hex is actually Thomas Hector Schofield, Cassie's son, now a grown man. The Hospital he worked at, St Gart's, had direct connections to the Forge, particularly department C4, researching Cyber technology (\"The Harvest\"). Their advanced computer network, called \"System\", was obtained in Australia, in 2006, from future Cyber tech (\"The Gathering\"). \n\nLong after Ace and Hex stop traveling with him, the Seventh Doctor arrives at the Forge in 2007, during the provocation of an alien invasion. And assisting them is what looks like the Sixth Doctor. When the real Doctor shows his clone the truth about his origins, he turns on Nimrod, engaging the Hades Protocol, destroying the entire facility, including employees, clones and other living experiments. However, Nimrod and some of the staff survived and moved to a secondary facility with a new version of their supercomputer, \"Oracle\", adapted from \"System\". Although the clone actually destroyed the Forge, Nimrod and the other survivors believed it was the real Doctor's doing.\n\nBy 2026, the Forge had rebuilt and re-branded itself as the official public face of alien encounters, held accountable by the government. Even Nimrod had become a public figure. Once again going by his name William Abberton, he had even been knighted. But a careless mistake by a someone at the Forge released a deadly mutagen, forcing most of London to be evacuated. A younger Seventh Doctor (still traveling with Ace and Hex and unaware of his future self's connection to the destruction of the Forge decades in the past), arrived in the middle of this emergency. From Nimrod's perspective, this is the fourth meeting with the Doctor (but only the Doctor's third meeting with Nimrod). Nimrod knows who Hex is and tells him about the secrets the Doctor has been keeping. But what Nimrod really wants is the Doctor's Twilight Virus, which he re-engineers to kill all the mutants in London. The Forge's second in command, Captain Aristedes, is soon convinced that her employers are evil. She overthrows Nimrod and engages \"Project: Destiny\", the final destruction of the Forge. Nimrod himself is killed by a sort of zombie version of Cassie.\n\nIn \"A Death in the Family\", the Doctor and UNIT pick over the remains of the Forge, looking for dangerous technology. And the Doctor in particular searches for a Time Lord casket that he had been told was somewhere in their archives. Inside it, he finds an older version of himself, not dead, but in a sort of trance. His future self was engaged in a complicated battle with a Word Lord named Nobody No-One, when the Forge obtained the casket. No-One meanwhile was hiding at the Forge for decades, disguising his wordship as their catch-phrase \"For King and Country\".\n\nYears later, The Forge rose again, using the profits from their technology to break away from the government and build a new headquarters. Their new skyscraper was the most scientifically advanced building in the world. Once again, \"Oracle\" controlled the building, but now it was hardwired to the remains of Nimrod, kept in a sealed vault deep below the property. The book contains the short story \"Twilight's End\", in which Nimrod subconsciously summons the Seventh Doctor. \"Oracle\" refuses him entry, recalling the destruction of their first two facilities. Nimrod overrides the decision, reuniting with the Doctor for the final time (but not the final time from the Doctor's perspective). The Doctor leaves a syringe containing the Twilight Cure, giving Nimrod the choice to use it.\n\n\"Gods and Monsters\" implied that the true origins of The Forge were far older than anyone had imagined. An ancient Elder God, Weyland the Smith claimed he had forged The Forge. And he had manipulated its most notable personnel, and the Seventh Doctor and several of his companions, all as part of an eternal game against another Elder God, Fenric.\n\nForge personnel have included:\n\n\n"}

Recent research favours the authorship of Jakub Auguston, an architect of Italian descent living in Pilsen (Plzeň in Czech). The extravagant layout and decoration of the house set it apart from Auguston's other works in provincial style, so Trpisty either is his best and most mature project or it has been designed by somebody else. The layout of the building is based on two pavilions (the North and South Wing) connected by two large oval rooms protruding in the middle of the East and West facades. The piano nobile on the first floor is lavishly decorated with allegorical baroque frescoes in stucco mirrors, while the main drawing room boasts a large fresco on its entire vaulted ceiling depicting an apotheosis of the Sinzendorf family and historic scenes from the Ottoman Court.\n\nThe large formal garden was landscaped in the English style in the 19th century and contains today a rich collection of rare trees, among them a 19th-century female Ginkgo tree.\n\nThe château, its park and outbuildings are among the last remaining examples of 18th century Bohemian country houses embedded in its original landscape without visible changes in the wake of industrialisation or subsequent destruction during the communist rule and belong to the most valuable historic estates in Central Europe.\n\n \n"}

In Vietnam, they are recognized as (literally \"Khmer people\") and (which mean the same), one of Vietnam's fifty-three ethnic minorities.\n\nIn Khmer, Krom means \"low\" or \"below\". “Krom” is added to differentiate from Khmer in Cambodia. Most Khmer Krom lives in Kampuchea Krom, the southern lowland region of historical Cambodia covering an area of around modern day Ho Chi Minh City and the Mekong Delta, which used to be the southeasternmost territory of the Khmer Empire until its incorporation into Vietnam under the Nguyễn lords in the early 18th century. This marks the final stage of the Vietnamese \"March to the South\" (nam tiến).\n\nKhmer Krom have been members of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization (UNPO) since 15 July 2001.\n\nAccording to the US-based Human Rights Watch (HRW) \"the Khmer Krom face serious restrictions of freedom of expression, assembly, association, information, and movement\".\n\nThe majority of Khmer Krom live in Kampuchea Krom. According to Vietnamese government figures (2009 census), there are 1,260,640 Khmer Krom in Vietnam. Other estimates vary considerably, with at least 7 million (consistent with the data from Khmer Kampuchea-Krom Federation) to over ten million, reported in Taylor (2014) in his \"The Khmer lands of Vietnam\".\n\nThere are also significant Khmer Krom fled to Cambodia with an estimate of 1.2 million.\n\nIn other parts of the world, there are approximately 40,000 Khmer Krom emigrants notably in the USA (30,000), France (3,000), Australia (1,000), Canada (500), …\nKhmer Krom emigrant communities in the US are located near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and in Washington State.\n\nThe Khmer Krom identify ethnically with the Khmer people who constitute a distinct people at least since the late eighth century and the foundation of the Khmer Empire by Jayavarman II in 802 C.E. They retain deep linguistic, religious, customary and cultural links to Cambodia proper. The Mekong Delta region constituted for more than 800 years an integral part of the empire and the subsequent kingdom. The region's economic center was the city Prey Nokor, now Ho Chi Minh City.\n\nIn the 17th century a weakened Khmer state left the Mekong Delta poorly administered after repeated warfare with Siam. Concurrently Vietnamese refugees fleeing the Trịnh–Nguyễn War in Vietnam migrated into the area. In 1623 Cambodian king Chey Chettha II (1618–1628) officially sanctioned the Vietnamese immigrants to operate a custom house at Prey Nokor, then a small fishing village. The settlement steadily grew soon becoming a major regional port, attracting even more settlers.\n\nIn 1698 the Nguyễn Lords of Huế commissioned Nguyễn Hữu Cảnh, a Vietnamese noble to organize the territory along Vietnamese administrative lines, thus by \"de facto\" detaching it from the Kingdom of Cambodia and incorporating it into Vietnam.\n\nWith the loss of the port of Prey Nokor, then renamed Sài Gòn, Cambodia's control of the area grew increasingly tenuous while increasing waves of Vietnamese settlers to the Delta isolated the Khmer of the Mekong Delta from the Cambodian kingdom. By 1757 the Vietnamese had absorbed the provinces of Psar Dèk (renamed Sa Đéc in Vietnamese) on the Mekong itself, and Moat Chrouk (Vietnamized to Châu Đốc) on the Bassac River.\n\nMinh Mạng enacted assimilation policies upon the Khmer such as forcing them to adopt Sino-Vietnamese surnames, culture, and clothing. Minh Mang sinicized ethnic minorities including the Cambodians, in line with Confucianism as he diffused Vietnamese culture with China's Han civilization using the term Han people 漢人 for the Vietnamese. Minh Mang declared that \"We must hope that their barbarian habits will be subconsciously dissipated, and that they will daily become more infected by Han [Sino-Vietnamese] customs.\" These policies were directed at the Khmer and hill tribes.\n\nOn June 4, 1949 the French President Vincent Auriol signed the accord reincorporating Cochinchina to Vietnam. This was done without consulting the indigenous Khmer Krom.\n\nKhmer nationalist Son Ngoc Thanh (1908–77) was a Khmer krom, born in Trà Vinh, Vietnam. Thanh was active in the independence movement for Cambodia. With Japanese support he became the prime minister of Cambodia in March 1945 but was then quickly ousted with the return of the French later that year. Widely supported by the Khmer Krom during the First Indochina War, Thanh's role faded in Vietnam after 1954 as he became more embroiled with politics in Cambodia proper, forming an opposition movement against Prince Sihanouk.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War and direct American involvement between 1964 and 1974, the Khmer Krom were recruited by the United States Armed Forces to serve in MIKE Force. The force fought on the side of South Vietnam against the Viet Cong but in time the militia regrouped as the \"Front for the Struggle of Kampuchea Krom\" (). Headed by a Khmer Krom Buddhist monk, Samouk Sen, the group was nicknamed the \"White Scarves\" (; ) and allied itself with FULRO against South Vietnam. FULRO was an alliance of Khmer Krom, Montagnard, and Cham groups.\n\nThe anti-Communist prime minister of the Khmer Republic (1970 - 1975) Lon Nol planned to recapture the Mekong Delta from South Vietnam.\n\nAfter the Fall of Saigon in 1975 and the Communist take-over of all of Vietnam, the Kampuchea Krom militia found itself embattled with People's Army of Vietnam. Many of the fighters fled to Khmer Rouge-controlled Democratic Kampuchea hoping to find a safe haven to launch their operations inside Vietnam. The \"White Scarves\" arrived in Kiri Vong District in 1976, making overture to the Khmer Rouge and appealing to the leader Khieu Samphan directly for assistance. The force was disarmed and welcomed initially. Subsequent orders from the Khmer Rouge leadership however had Samouk Sen arrested, taken to Phnom Penh, tortured, and killed. His force of 67 Khmer Krom fighters were all massacred. During the following months, some 2,000 \"White Scarves\" fighters crossing into Kampuchea were systematically killed by the Khmer Rouge.\n\nIn the late 1970s, the Kampuchean Revolutionary Army attacked Vietnam in an attempt to reconquer the areas which were formerly part of the Khmer Empire, but this military adventure was a total disaster and precipitated the invasion of Democratic Kampuchea by the People's Army of Vietnam and subsequent downfall of the Khmer Rouge, with Vietnam occupying Kampuchea.\n\nMany independent NGOs report that the human rights of the Khmer Krom are being violated by the Vietnamese government. Khmer Krom are reportedly forced to adopt Vietnamese family names and speak the Vietnamese language. As well, the Vietnamese government has cracked down on non violent demonstrations by the Khmer Krom.\n\nUnlike some other minority people groups in Vietnam, the Khmer Krom are largely unknown by the Western world, despite efforts by associations of exiled Khmer Krom such as the Khmers Kampuchea-Krom Federation to publicize their plight with the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organisation. No Western government has yet raised the matter of the Khmer Krom's human rights with the Vietnamese government.\n\nThe \"Human Rights Council Universal Periodic Review Working Group\" was visited by the Khmer Kampuchea Krom Federation.\n\n\n\n"}

It is active in petrochemicals, chemicals, industrial polymers, fertilizers, and metals. It is the second largest public company in the Middle East and Saudi Arabia as listed in Tadawul. 70% of SABIC's shares are owned by Saudi Aramco. Private shareholders are from Saudi Arabia and other countries of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).\n\nSABIC was the world's fourth-largest chemical producer in 2013. It is currently the second-largest global ethylene glycol producer and is expected to top the list after the introduction of new projects. SABIC is the third-largest polyethylene manufacturer, the fourth-largest polyolefins manufacturer, and the fourth-largest polypropylene manufacturer. SABIC is also the world's largest producer of methyl tert-butyl ether, granular urea, polycarbonate, polyphenylene and polyether imide.\n\nIn 2017, SABIC was ranked fourth in the world among chemical companies by Fortune Global 500. By the end of 2018 SABIC was the world's 281th-largest corporation. In 2010, SABIC grew to be the second-largest diversified chemical company, or first when measured only by asset value. Measured over all its branches, it became (as of 2014) the world's 98th-largest corporation on the Forbes Global 2000 ranking (which lists only publicly traded companies), with sales revenues of $50.4 billion, profits of $6.7 billion and assets standing at $90.4 billion.\n\nThe company is based in Riyadh and has interests in 17 affiliated companies, which range from full ownership to significant partial participation.\n\nSABIC was founded in 1976 by royal decree to convert oil by-products into useful chemicals, polymers, and fertilizers. The first chairman of the company was Ghazi Abdul Rahman Al Gosaibi, the Minister of Industry and Electricity, and the first CEO was Abdul Aziz Bin Abdullah Al Zamil.\n\nSABIC's founding transformed the small fishing villages of Jubail on the Persian Gulf and Yanbu on the Red Sea into modern industrial cities. Production in 1985 was 6.5 million tons; five years later production rose to 13 million tons and by 2003 production had risen to 42 million metric tons and by 2012 to over 60 million tons. SABIC employs more than 40,000 people globally and has 60 manufacturing and compounding plants in over 40 countries.\n\nSABIC's manufacturing network in Saudi Arabia consists of 18 affiliates. Most of these are based in the Al-Jubail Industrial City on the coast of the Persian Gulf. Two are located in Yanbu Industrial City on the Red Sea and one is in the eastern city of Dammam. SABIC is also partners in three regional ventures based in Bahrain. SABIC is a market leader in key products such as ethylene, ethylene glycol, methanol, MTBE and polyethylene. SABIC's wholly owned subsidiary, the Saudi Iron and Steel Company (Hadeed), based in Al Jubail, is one of the world's biggest fully integrated producers.\n\nSABIC underwent a business restructuring in October 2015, that saw the absorption of the commodity chemicals produced under the Innovative Plastics SBU into the Chemicals and Polymers SBUs. Along with this, the Specialties SBU was created to house the remainder of the Innovative Plastics products that did not fall under the commodity umbrella and the Innovative Plastics SBU would cease to exist by January 1, 2016. This change follows the reallocation of the Performance Chemicals portfolio into the Chemicals SBU. The business units are currently: Chemicals, Polymers, Fertilizers (SABIC has three fertiliser affiliates: Safco, Samad and Ibn Al-Baytar ), Metals and Specialties, plus manufacturing. Along with this change it was announced that the Innovative Plastics headquarters in Pittsfield, United States, would be closed, and the SABIC Regional Headquarters for the Americas would be relocated to Houston.\n\nIn July 2002, SABIC commenced operations in Europe after the $2 billion acquisition of the petrochemicals business of Dutch group DSM. SABIC Europe, SABIC's European subsidiary, produces over 2 million metric tonnes of polymers and over 5 million metric tonnes of basic chemicals. It employs over 3,000 people and has two major manufacturing locations in Geleen in the Netherlands and Gelsenkirchen in Germany. After forming SABIC Europe, SABIC became the 11th-largest petrochemicals company in the world. The purchase of DSM signified SABIC's intent to expand and become a true global company.\n\nIn 2004, the value of SABIC shares, listed on the Saudi Stock Exchange (Tadawul), increased 170% while its net profits increased by 112% from 2003 to 2004.\n\nIn 2005, SABIC was the Middle East's largest (in terms of market capitalization) and most profitable publicly listed non-oil company, the world's 11th-largest petrochemical company, ranked 331 on the \"Fortune Global\" 500 for 2005, the second-largest producer of ethylene glycol and methanol in the world, the third-largest producer of polyethylene and overall the fourth-largest producer of polypropylene and polyolefin. Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings claimed SABIC to be the world's largest producer of polymers and the Persian Gulf region's largest steel producer for 2005; they assigned SABIC an \"A\" corporate credit rating. That same year, Bloomberg ranked SABIC as the 13th-largest company in the world in terms of market capitalization (at the beginning of 2005 it exceeded billion, the equivalent of billion) and the second-largest by market value outside the US and UK.\n\nIn June 2006, SABIC established the \"SABIC Sukuk Company\" to issue Islamic bonds (Sukuk) that are estimated to range between billion ( million) and billion ( million).\n\nIn January 2007, SABIC Europe took over Huntsman Corporation plants in the UK. Headquartered in Sittard, Netherlands, SABIC Europe has a European wide network of sales offices and logistic hubs, as well as three petrochemical production sites in Europe: Geleen (Netherlands), Teesside (United Kingdom), and Gelsenkirchen (Germany).\n\nIn 2008, SABIC Europe produced 7.3 million metric tons of petrochemicals, mainly for the European market.\n\nOn May 21, 2007, SABIC acquired General Electric's Plastics division, in a billion cash deal, including billion of its liabilities, and launched SABIC Innovative Plastics. In that year, the company ranked 145 (previous rank: 301) in the Forbes Global 2000 list. As of 2014, SABIC Innovative Plastics is a multibillion-dollar company with operations in more than 25 countries and over 9,500 employees worldwide.\n\nIn July 2009, SABIC received approval from the Chinese government to build a billion petrochemical complex in China, in order to gain a foothold in the world's fastest-growing chemicals market.\n\nIn January 2018, SABIC announced that it had acquired a 24.99% stake in Clariant, the Swiss specialty chemical manufacturer. The stake was acquired from activist investor White Tale, and at Clariant's prevailing market-capitalisation would have been valued in the region of $2.4bn. The actual transaction price was undisclosed. SABIC CEO Yousef Al-Benyan had previously stated, in November 2017, that the company was looking to spend $3bn-$10bn on acquisitions over the next 10 years.\n\nOn March 27, 2019, SABIC announced that state-owned energy company Saudi Aramco signed a share purchase agreement to acquire a 70% majority stake in SABIC from the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia in a private transaction worth $69.1 billion.\n\nExpansion operations and investments are projected to amount to billion in 2007 and billion until 2020. The overall total production in 1985 was 6.3 million metric tons; by the end of 2008 it had reached 56 million metric tons.

{"id": "1929215", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1929215", "title": "Diadumenos", "text": "Diadumenos\n\nThe Diadumenos (\"diadem-bearer\"), together with the \"Doryphoros\" (spear bearer), are two of the most famous figural types of the sculptor Polyclitus, forming a basic pattern of Ancient Greek sculpture that all present strictly idealised representations of young male athletes in a convincingly naturalistic manner. \n\nThe \"Diadumenos\" is the winner of an athletic contest at a games, still nude after the contest and lifting his arms to knot the diadem, a ribbon-band that identifies the winner and which in the bronze original of about 420 BCE would have been represented by a ribbon of bronze. The figure stands in contrapposto with his weight on his right foot, his left knee slightly bent and his head inclined slightly to the right, self-contained, seeming to be lost in thought. Phidias was credited with a statue of a victor at Olympia in the act of tying the fillet around his head; besides Polyclitus, his successors Lysippos and Scopas also created figures of this kind.\n\nBoth Pliny's Natural History and Lucian's \"Philopseudes\" described Roman marbles of a \"Diadumenos\" copied from Greek originals in bronze, yet it was not recognized until 1878 that the Roman marble from Vaison-la-Romaine (Roman Vasio) in the British Museum and two others recreate the lost Polyclitan bronze original. Pliny recorded that the Polyclitan original fetched at auction the extraordinary price of a hundred talents, an enormous sum in Antiquity, as Adolf Furtwängler pointed out. Indeed, Roman marble copies must have abounded, to judge from the number of recognizable fragments and complete works, including a at the Louvre, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, another complete example at the Prado Museum, and another complete example of somewhat different character, the somewhat below lifesize Roman marble Farnese Diadumenos at the British Museum, which preserves the end of the ribband falling from the right hand. Another version in the British Museum, slightly damaged but in otherwise reasonable condition, is from Vaison in France. Freer versions were executed in reduced scale as bronze statuettes, and the head of Diadumenos-type appears on numerous Roman engraved gems. \n\nThe marble \"Diadumenos\" from Delos at the National Museum, Athens (\"right\") has the winner's cloak and his quiver laid upon the tree stump, hinting that he is the victor in an archery match, with perhaps an implied reference to Apollo, who was conceived, too, as an idealised youth.\nA mark of the continuing artistic value placed on the \"Diadumenos\" type in the modern era, once it had been reconnected with Polyclitus in 1878, may be drawn from the facts that a copy was among the sculptures ranged on the roof of the National Archaeological Museum, Athens, when it was completed in 1889, and that the Esquiline Venus has sometimes been interpreted as a female version of the diadumenos type (a diadumene, or woman tying a diadem).\n\n"}
{"id": "1929217", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1929217", "title": "Fruitopia", "text": "Fruitopia\n\nFruitopia was a fruit-flavored drink introduced by The Coca-Cola Company in 1994 and targeted at teens and young adults. According to \"New York Times\" business reports, it was invented as part of a push by Coca-Cola to capitalize on the success of Snapple and other flavored tea drinks. The brand gained substantial hype in the mid-1990s before enduring lagging sales by decade's end. While still available in Canada and Australia as a juice brand, in 2003, Fruitopia was phased out in most of the United States where it had struggled for several years. However, select flavors have since been revamped under Coca-Cola's successful Minute Maid brand. Use of the Fruitopia brand name continues through various beverages in numerous countries, including some McDonald's restaurant locations in the United States, which carry the drink to this day.\n\nFruitopia was a pet project of Coke's former marketing chief, Sergio Zyman. The company spent an initial marketing budget of $30 million, allowing Fruitopia to quickly gain hype in the mid-1990s. \"TIME magazine\" named Fruitopia one of the Top 10 New Products of 1994, and the beverage would even be mentioned on the popular animated series, \"The Simpsons\".\n\nThe brand's flagship flavor would be Strawberry Passion Awareness. This flavor was available at drink fountains as well at McDonald's as Coca-Cola pushed this drink to market in many places. Fruitopia vending machines have also appeared in schools and college campuses in addition to, or as a replacement of, soda.\n\nIn addition to the popular Strawberry Passion Awareness, other flavors included The Grape Beyond, Tangerine Wavelength, Citrus Consciousness, Fruit Integration, Pink Lemonade Euphoria, Lemonade Love & Hope, Raspberry Psychic Lemonade, Strawberry Kiwi Ruckus, and Beachside Blast. These flavors were available in the United States while a much wider array was available in the UK. On March 23, 1995, a Fruitopia fruit tea line featuring Born Raspberry, Peaceable Peach, Lemon Berry Intuition, and Curious Mango was introduced in 16-ounce glass bottles. In a drive to remake the brand and remarket it as more relevant to Generation X, however, Coca-Cola dropped several Fruitopia flavors in 1996, added others (such as Beachside Blast and Banana Vanilla Inclination), and renamed others (Citrus Consciousness becoming Citrus Excursion).\n\nFruitopia had rather unusual commercials despite the simplicity of the product behind them. They featured animation using imagery of fruit arrayed in colorful, spinning kaleidoscope patterns. This was accompanied by idealistic aphorisms reminiscent of hippie poetry of the 1960s, such as might be found in advertisements which ran in underground press newspapers of the period. Background music on several of the ads was provided by The Muffs, Kate Bush, and the Cocteau Twins. Ad copy ran as follows:\n\n\"There is a beautiful person<br>\n\"living inside you!<br>\n\"Please share a Raspberry Psychic Lemonade<br>\n\"with him or her.\"\n\nIts recurring slogan was \"Fruitopia: for the mind, body, and planet.\" \n\nIn 1997, Greek writer Eugene Trivizas won the first stage of a legal battle against Coca-Cola. This prevented the multinational company from registering \"Fruitopia\" as a trademark for soft drinks, as it was already trademarked for the title of his TV serial and comic-strip books. The court decided that Coca-Cola had unlawfully appropriated his intellectual property. Coca-Cola appealed against the decision and, in December 1999, the relevant court of appeal ruled once again in his favour prohibiting the use of his intellectual property as a trademark for soft drinks.\n\nBy the end of the 1990s, Fruitopia had struggled to maintain a profitable profile. In 2003, the Fruitopia line was all but discontinued in the United States, with some flavors being revamped under the Minute Maid moniker; Minute Maid, the world's largest juice brand, was largely responsible for the lagging sales of Fruitopia. A similar situation occurred with PepsiCo, who replaced their own Fruitopia clone, Fruit Works, with the enduring Tropicana moniker. Fruitopia Strawberry Passion Awareness is still available in the United States (branded as Minute Maid) in McDonald's fountain machines nationwide.\n\nDue to its success in the region, Fruitopia juice is still available in Canada in a wide variety of flavours and continues to be sold in Australia as a juice brand. The ingredients in Canadian and former American Fruitopia drinks are not the same and taste(d) different; notably, the United States version has preservatives added. In 2007, Coca-Cola GmbH Germany released a new fruit juice line under the name \"Fruitopia by Minute Maid\".\n\nIn 2001, Fruitopia was relaunched in Australia as a juice brand but was unable to gain major success. Four years later, it held only 4% of the Australian juice market, prompting Coca-Cola Australia's then general manager for Non Carbs, John McLoughlin, to invest several million dollars into revitalizing the brand in what was seen as a challenge to the reigning Berri brand. This was based on research suggesting that while consumers did not hold the product experience in high esteem, they chose Fruitopia as their favorite brand name. The plan involved the launch of Fruitopia J, an ambient juice, and Fruitopia Classic, a chilled juice, as well as $100 million in dedicated Fruitopia coolers. Critics did not agree with the strategy, and within two years, Fruitopia maintained only a weak market share.\n\nA drink to dilute with the same name is being sold by the Coca-Cola Company in Argentina, under their Cepita branch.\n\n\n"}

Mahudel, member of the Académie des Inscriptions , presented several of those stones and showed that they have evidently been cut by the hand of man. \"An examination of them,\" he said, \"affords a proof of the efforts of our earliest ancestors to provide for their wants, and to obtain the necessaries of life.\" \n\nHe established the stone - bronze - iron sequence after he had compared several burial sites.

{"id": "1929224", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1929224", "title": "Culture of Afghanistan", "text": "Culture of Afghanistan\n\nThe culture of Afghanistan has persisted for over three millennia, tracing record to at least the time of the Achaemenid Empire in 500 BCE. Afghanistan translates to \"\"Land of the Afghans\"\" or \"\"Place of Afghans\"\" in the nation's official languages, Dari and Pashto. It is mostly a tribal society with different regions of the country having its own subculture. Nearly all Afghans follow Islamic traditions, celebrate the same holidays, dress the same, consume the same food, listen to the same music and are multi-lingual to a certain extent.\n\nIn the southern and eastern region, as well as western Pakistan which was historically part of Afghanistan, the Pashtuns live according to the Pashtun culture by following Pashtunwali (meaning \"the way of the Pashtuns\"). The western, northern, and central regions of Afghanistan are influenced by neighboring Central Asian and Persian cultures. Some of the non-Pashtuns who live in close proximity with Pashtuns have adopted Pashtunwali in a process called Pashtunization (or \"Afghanization\") while some Pashtuns and others have learned to speak Dari-Persian.\n\nThe lands of Afghanistan have a long history of art, with the world's earliest known usage of oil painting found in cave murals in the country. A notable art style that developed in Afghanistan and eastern Pakistan is Gandhara art, produced by a fusion of Greco-Roman art and Buddhist art between the 1st and 7th centuries CE.Later eras saw increased use of the Persian miniature style, with Kamaleddin Behzad of Herat being one of the most notable miniature artists of the Timurid and early Safavid periods. Since the 1900s, the nation began to use Western techniques in art. Abdul Ghafoor Breshna was a prominent Afghan painter and sketch artist from Kabul during the 20th century.\n\nAfghanistan's art was originally almost entirely done by men, but recently women are entering the arts programs at Kabul University. Art is largely centered at the National Museum of Afghanistan, the National Gallery of Afghanistan and the National Archives of Afghanistan in Kabul. There are a number of art schools in the country. The Center for Contemporary Arts Afghanistan (CCAA) in Kabul provides young people to learn contemporary paintings.\nTraditionally, only women have been involved in theater acting. Recently, in theater arts, women have begun to take center stage.\n\nOther known forms of art in the country are music, poetry, and several sports. The art of making carpets has been prominent for centuries. Afghanistan is known for making beautiful oriental rugs. The Afghan carpet has certain prints that make them unique to Afghanistan.\n\nSince the 1980s, the nation has witnessed several wars so music has been suppressed and recording for outsiders minimal. During the 1990s, the Taliban government banned instrumental music and much public music-making. Many musicians and singers continued to play their trade in the cities of other countries. Pakistani cities such as Peshawar, Karachi and Islamabad are important centers for the distribution of Afghan music. Kabul has long been the regional cultural capital, but outsiders have tended to focus on the cities of Herat and Mazar-i-Sharif with its \"Qataghani\" style. Lyrics across the country are typically in both Dari-Persian and Pashto. Hindi songs from Bollywood films are also very popular in Afghanistan.\nAfghans enjoy music by playing many types of instruments. They also enjoy performing the Attan, which is considered the national dance of Afghanistan. What is typically heard in the country are folk songs or ballads. Many of the songs are known by almost everyone and have been around for many years. The main traditional Afghan music instruments include:\n\n\nPoetry in Afghanistan has long been a cultural tradition and passion. It is mainly in Persian/Dari and Pashto languages, although in modern times it is also becoming more recognized in Afghanistan's other languages. Classic Persian and Pashto poetry plays an important role in the Afghan culture. Poetry has always been one of the major educational pillars in the region, to the level that it has integrated itself into culture. Some notable poets include Khushal Khan Khattak, Rahman Baba, Massoud Nawabi, Nazo Tokhi, Ahmad Shah Durrani, and Ghulam Muhammad Tarzi. Some of the famous Persian poets and authors from the 10th to 15th centuries are Rumi, Rabi'a Balkhi, Khwaja Abdullah Ansari, Jami, Alisher Navoi, Sanai, Abu Mansur Daqiqi, Farrukhi Sistani, Unsuri, and Anvari. Contemporary Persian language poets and writers include Khalilullah Khalili and Sufi Ashqari.\n\nAfghans prize wit and cleverness in speech. \"Zarbul Masalha\" (pronounced zar-bull mah-sal-HAA) means \"proverbs\" in Dari, and these \"zarbul masalha\" deeply reflect Afghan culture. U.S. Navy Captain Edward Zellem pioneered the use of Afghan proverbs as a positive relationship-building tool during the war in Afghanistan, and in 2012 he published two bilingual collections of Afghan proverbs in Dari and English.\n\nThe region has made major contributions to the world's architecture. UNESCO has acknowledged Afghanistan's role by declaring the Minaret of Jam and the Valley of Bamiyan, home of the famous Buddhas destroyed by the Taliban, World Heritage Sites.\n\nOther examples of important contributions to architecture may be found in Herat, Mazar-I-Sharif, Ghazni Kandahar, and Firuzkoh in Ghor Province.\n\nAfghanistan has a wide varying landscape allowing for many different crops. Afghan food is largely based upon cereals like wheat, maize, barley and rice, which are the nation's chief crops. Fresh and dried fruits is the most important part of Afghan diet. Afghanistan is well known for its fine fruits, especially pomegranates, grapes, and its extra-sweet jumbo-size melons.\n\nThe sports in Afghanistan are organized by the Afghan Sports Federation, which promotes football, cricket, basketball, volleyball, golf, handball, boxing, taekwondo, track and field, bowling, skating and several others.\n\nCricket and football are the most popular sports in Afghanistan. The Afghanistan national cricket team, which was formed in 2001, has held matches against all other international cricket teams. The Afghan team rapidly rose through the World Cricket League since early 2008. It participated in the 2009 ICC World Cup Qualifier, 2010 ICC World Cricket League Division One, and 2010 ICC World Twenty20 where they played India and South Africa. The team won four times in a row, the ACC Twenty20 Cup in 2007, 2009, 2011, and 2013. It played against top ranking teams in the 2012 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup and the 2012 ICC World Twenty20. In the national level, cricket matches are played between provinces, mainly between the south and eastern provinces of the country. In the other sports, Afghans usually play with challengers of neighboring states and sometimes with other Asian countries.\n\nThe Afghanistan national football team was founded in 1922, joined FIFA in 1948 and the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) in 1954. Although it did not play in any international games from 1984 to 2003 due to the war, it is now striving and hoping to make it to FIFA. The Afghanistan women's national football team was formed in 2007. The Ghazi Stadium, which was built during the reign of King Amanullah Khan, was once used for a venue for public executions by the Taliban government. The stadium is currently used mostly for football matches between teams from different provinces of the country as well as neighboring countries. Basketball has existed in Afghanistan since at least the 1970s, and is slowly becoming popular again. It is played by both Afghan men and women. Additionally, Afghans in the north of the country enjoy the sport of buzkashi.\n\nEducation in Afghanistan includes K-12 and higher education, which is supervised by the Ministry of Education and Ministry of Higher Education in Kabul, Afghanistan. There are about 10,000 schools of which 4,000 were built in the last decade. More than 100,000 teachers were trained and recruited in the same period. It was reported in 2011 that more than seven million male and female students were enrolled in schools. Some of the well known schools in Kabul are Habibia High School, Lycée Esteqlal, Amani High School, Aisha-i-Durani School, Ghazi High School and Rahman Baba High School. The Ahmad Shah Baba High School and Zarghuna Anna High School are two of the oldest schools in Kandahar.\n\nSince the country has one of the lowest literacy rates in the world, the United States began establishing a number of Lincoln learning centers to help with this problem and promote American culture in Afghanistan. They are set up to serve as programming platforms offering English language classes, library facilities, programming venues, Internet connectivity, educational and other counseling services. A goal of the program is to reach at least 4,000 Afghan citizens per month per location. The military and national police are now provided with mandatory literacy courses. In addition to this, Baghch-e-Simsim (based on the American Sesame Street) was launched in late 2011 to help Afghan children learn from preschool onward. Programs in the show \"will be partly filmed in Afghanistan with the rest\" lifted from other versions in Muslim countries including Egypt and Bangladesh, as well as Mexico and Russia.\n\nHigher education is provided by various universities throughout the country, which include the American University of Afghanistan, Kabul University, Polytechnical University of Kabul, Herat University, Balkh University, Nangarhar University, Kandahar University, Khost University, Bakhtar University, and a heap of others. There is also one military college, located in Kabul. Recently with help from UNESCO, over 1,000 women have taken the university entrance exam. As of 2011, about 62,000 students are enrolled in different universities around the country.\n\nDari and Pashto are both the official languages of Afghanistan, although Dari (Afghan Persian) serves as the lingua franca for the majority. People in the northern and central areas of the country usually speak Persian/Dari, while those living in the south and east speak Pashto. Afghans living in the western regions of Afghanistan speak both Dari and Pashto. Most citizens are fluent in both languages, especially those living in major cities where the population is multi-ethnic. Several other languages are spoken in their own regions, which includes Uzbek, Turkmen and Balochi. English is gradually becoming popular among the young generation. There are smaller number of Afghans who can understand Russian, mainly among the northern Tajik, Uzbek and Turkmen groups.\n\nIslam is the main religion of Afghanistan and over 99% of Afghans are Muslims. An estimated 84.7–90% of the population adhere to Sunni Islam, while an estimated 7–15% practice Shia Islam, and approximately 1% are followers of other religions. \n\nIn addition to Muslims, there are thousands of Afghan Sikhs and Hindus living in the country. They are usually found in the major cities such as Kabul, Kandahar, Herat, Mazar-i-Sharif, Jalalabad, and Lashkar Gah.\n\nHouses in rural Afghanistan are traditionally made out of mud, and have a series of rooms located around a private rectangular courtyard where women and children play, cook and socialize. Married sons share the same house as their parents in most cases, although they have separate quarters. Afghan houses contain a special room where men socialize with each other known as a \"hujra\". In the cities, many Afghans live in modern style houses or apartments. There are many new housing schemes being built in all the major cities of the country. Some of these include the \"New Kabul City\" next to the capital, the \"Ghazi Amanullah Khan City\" near Jalalabad, and the \"Aino Mina\" in Kandahar. The nomadic kuchi people live in large tents because they are constantly on the move from one part of the country to another.\n\nAfghanistan's religious holidays are nearly the same as Islamic holidays. Some of the most important include Eid al-Fitr (end of Ramadan), Eid al-Adha, Ashura, and Mawlid. Religious minorities of Afghanistan, such as the Hindus, Sikhs, Zoroastrians, and others celebrate holidays unique to their respective religion.\n\nFarmer's Day, also known as Nauruz (Nowruz), is an ancient annual Afghan festival which celebrates both the beginning of spring and the New Year. The observances usually last two weeks, culminating on the first day of the Afghan New Year, March 21, and corresponds to the first day of the Persian Calendar.\n\nNauruz is related to a religion called Zoroastrianism which was in practice in ancient Persia before the emergence of Islam. This festival is to celebrate the arrival of spring as plants, trees, and flowers start to bloom making the weather pleasant. On the day of Nauruz, families usually celebrate the festival by cooking food and going out for a picnic. Families cook various kinds of meals, Samanak, and Haft-mewah or dry fruits that start with the letter (س) or (S) which represents the arrival of spring season. Haft-mewah contains seven dry fruits which families place in warm water two to three days before Nauruz. Samanak is another type of dessert made from wheat and sugar. Women usually get together days before Nauruz to prepare Samanak. They pour the ingredients into a big pot placed on an open fire and take turns to stir the wheat and sugar in the pot before it turns into a thick paste. Once prepared, the dessert is then served on the day of Nauruz.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1929230", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1929230", "title": "Section 377A of the Penal Code (Singapore)", "text": "Section 377A of the Penal Code (Singapore)\n\nSection 377A is a Singaporean law criminalising sex between consenting male adults. The item of legislation was added to the Penal Code in the 1930s. The item remained part of the Singapore body of law after the Penal Code review of October 2007 that removed most of the other provisions in Section 377. The section is entitled and reads:\n\nIts mother statute, Section 377, criminalised any sexual act that went \"against the order of nature\":\n\nThe British Parliament formed the Indian Law Commission in 1833. Lord Thomas Macaulay was appointed to chair the commission. The 1837 draft of the Indian Penal Code was largely his work. It took 23 years for his work to be reviewed by the commission and the Supreme Court judges in Mumbai, Calcutta, and Madras. The code was adopted in 1860 and took effect 1 January 1862.\n\nMacaulay's draft did not reflect existing Indian laws or customs. It was largely a rewrite of the British Royal Commission's 1843 draft code. The adopted draft included a Section 377 (quoted above), but there were many ambiguities in the section, including the question of what had to penetrate what. These in turn let future jurists redefine what these provisions actually punished. Under Hindu law, consensual intercourse between members of the same sex was never an offence. In the new Indian Penal Code, however, Section 377 criminalised \"carnal intercourse against the order of nature\", derived from words attributed to Sir Edward Coke in the seventeenth century.\n\nSection 377A (Outrages on decency) was added to the sub-title \"Unnatural offences\" in the Straits Settlements in 1938. Both sections were absorbed unchanged into the Singapore Penal Code when the latter was passed by Singapore's Legislative Council on 28 January 1955.\n\nThe term \"gross indecency\" used in the statute was based on the wording of the Labouchere Amendment, also known as Section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885 of the UK. It was not a euphemism for buggery or sodomy, which was already a crime but rather, any other sexual activity between men.\n\nIt was worded thus:\n\n\"Any male person who, in public or private, commits, or is a party to the commission of, or procures, or attempts to procure the commission by any male person of, any act of gross indecency shall be guilty of a misdemeanour, and being convicted shall be liable at the discretion of the Court to be imprisoned for any term not exceeding two years, with or without hard labour.\"\n\nThe almost identical phrasing between the Labouchere Amendment and Section 377A is the best evidence that the latter was derived from the former.\n\nUnnatural sex or sodomy was not defined in the Indian Penal Code drafted by the British. Legal records show that Indian legislators in the 19th and early 20th centuries interpreted \"carnal intercourse against the order of nature\" between individuals (of all sexes - the law being non-gender specific with its use of the word \"whoever\") to include anal sex, bestiality and, often after much courtroom deliberation, oral sex as well, namely, any form of sexual intercourse which did not have the potential for procreation.\n\nTherefore, both heterosexual and homosexual oral and anal sex were criminal offences. In this particular narrow sense, Section 377 did not discriminate against homosexuals. However, early cases tried in India mainly involved forced fellatio with unwilling male children and one unusual case of sexual intercourse with the nostril of a buffalo.\n\nIn the Singaporean context, the Court of Appeal had held that heterosexual fellatio was exempted if indulged in as foreplay which eventually leads to coitus:\n\nThe Singaporean margin note of the original Section 377 further explained that mere penetration of the penis into the anus or mouth even without orgasm would constitute the offence. The law applied regardless of the act being consensual between both parties and done in private.\n\nSection 377 was repealed on 23 October 2007. A new Section 377, which criminalises sex with dead bodies (\"Sexual penetration of a corpse\"), was substituted in its place.\n\nSection 377A was introduced into the Singapore Penal Code in 1938 to criminalise all other non-penetrative sexual acts. It is descended from the Labouchere Amendment.\n\nIn the local context, \"gross indecency\" is a broad term which, from a review of past cases locally, has been applied to mutual masturbation, genital contact, or even lewd behaviour without direct physical contact. As with the former Section 377, performing such acts in private does not constitute a defence.\n\nAdvocates of the repeal often cited reasons of civil liberty, Gay Civil Rights human rights, and increasing scientific evidence that homosexuality was inborn and found in nature.\n\nOpponents of the repeal believe that a repeal of Section 377A would result in a breakdown of the family unit, compromise Singapore's position on procreation. Opponents of the repeal also believe that the majority support the retainment of 377A.\n\nThe Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) was quoted in \"The Straits Times\" of 18 September 2007 saying that public feedback on the issue had been \"emotional, divided and strongly expressed\", with a majority of people calling for Section 377A to be retained. The MHA also said that it recognised that \"we are generally a conservative society and that we should let the situation evolve\".\n\nOn 3 October 2007, an online appeal was launched via the \"Repeal 377A\" website to gather signatories for an open letter to the Prime Minister calling for the repeal of Section 377A. In response, a counter-petition on the website \"Keep 377A\" was set up to give citizens a channel to voice support for the Government's retention of the law. By 1:30 p.m. on 20 October, Keep377A had overtaken Repeal377A by 7,068 to 7,058 signatories. (The content of the Keep377A.com website was removed in 2009, although its web address remains.)\n\nAs online petitions, both websites suffered the same doubts regarding the credibility of the numbers of their signatories. There was no mention of whether technical measures were taken to ensure that multiple-voting by the same person was prevented.\n\nShortly after the Penal Code review report was released on 9 September 2018, a movement known as Ready4Repeal launched a petition to campaign for Section 377A to be repealed, even though MHA and MinLaw said there were no plans to do so. It also held a town hall meeting on 30 September 2018, attracting 44,650 people. In contrast, a petition that wants Section 377A kept attracted more than 109,000 signatures after it closed on 24 September 2018.\n\nEngland & Wales, the former British colony of Hong Kong, Australia have since repealed laws prohibiting sex between men in 1967, 1991, and 1997 (in the state of Tasmania; the last Australian state to do so) respectively. India's Supreme Court has also decriminalised sex between two people of the same sex in 2018, which is significant as Section 377A of the Penal Code is similar to Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code. Elsewhere in East and South-east Asia, apart from Singapore, only Myanmar, Malaysia and Brunei, all former British colonies, and recently Indonesia's Aceh province (applicable only to Muslims), continue to criminalise sex between men.\n\nSection 377A has been repeatedly challenged before the courts of Singapore as being unconstitutional. So far, all of the challenges have been chiefly based on Article 12 of the Constitution of Singapore, which guarantees all persons equality before the law, and Article 9 of the Constitution of Singapore, which guarantees all persons the right to life and the right to personal liberty.\n\nOn 24 September 2010, criminal lawyer M. Ravi filed an application in the High Court to challenge the constitutionality of Section 377A on behalf of his client Tan Eng Hong, who was charged for allegedly having oral sex with another consenting adult male in a locked cubicle of a public toilet.\n\nOn 19 March 2011, Tan's case was thrown out of court by High Court justice Lai Siu Chiu, citing \"a lack of a real controversy\" for the court to deal with. This is important, as according to the Supreme Court of Judicature Act of Singapore Rules of Court (), only cases which are not \"frivolous\" may be argued. However, on 21 August 2012, the Court of Appeal reversed Lai's decision, ruling that 377A did \"affect the lives of a not insignificant portion of [Singaporeans] in a very real and intimate way\" and that the case would proceed once again in the High Court.\n\nTan's case was finally heard on 6 March 2013, and decided against him by justice Quentin Loh on 2 October 2013. In his ruling, Loh wrote that the issue was one of \"morality and societal values\" and if it were to be changed, it would have to be by Singapore's Parliament. Tan appealed the ruling to the Court of Appeal, and his case was joined at his request as an intervening party with \"Lim Meng Suang and another v. Attorney-General\" (below), which was also pending before the Court of Appeal, on 11 October 2013.\n\nAfter Tan's successful appeal to be heard by the court, a separate constitutional challenge was filed on 30 November 2012 on behalf of Lim Meng Suan and Kenneth Chee Mun-leon, a gay couple of fifteen years, by attorney Peter Low. The case was heard \"in camera\" on 14 February 2013, and decided against them by justice Quentin Loh on 9 April 2013, for much the same reasons as his decision against Tan (above). Lim and Chee appealed to the Court of Appeal on 30 April 2013. In July 2013, after a successful crowdfunding campaign, they hired two highly esteemed lawyers: Deborah Barker, Senior Counsel at KhattarWong LLP, and British lawyer, Debevoise & Plimpton partner and former Attorney General for England and Wales Lord Peter Henry Goldsmith. Goldsmith had agreed to take the case without pay, but that September was disallowed from arguing the case before the court by Justice V. K. Rajah, as he believed that the legal issues were arguable by domestic lawyers, which is preferred by Singapore law.\n\nOn 29 October 2014, more than four years after the original challenge by Tan, the Court of Appeal, the highest court in Singapore, rejected Lim and Chee's challenge, finally ending the case. The court held that 377A was consistent with Article 9 as it is meant to protect against unlawful imprisonment, and that it was consistent with Article 12 as it only mentions religion, race and place of birth—not gender, sexual orientation, or sex. As in all judgments before, the court held that any legal remedy would have to come about through an Act of Parliament.\n\nCompared to news of LGBT rights in other nations such as Russia and the United States, the case and final appeal received little attention outside Singapore. \"The Huffington Post\" featured Chee and Lim's story prominently under the headline \"How One Of The World’s Richest Countries Is Limiting Basic Human Rights\", while \"Bloomberg\" published a more neutral piece.\n\nOn 29 August 2018, Professor Ho Kwon Ping in his talk questioned the need for Section 377A in Singapore. After India's Supreme Court decriminalised sex between two people of the same sex, with Professor Tommy Koh encouraging a constitutional challenge of Section 377A and chief of Singapore government communications Mr Janadas Devan hoping that Section 377A would go, several constitutional challenges have been brought to the Supreme Court. \n\nThe first challenge after India's ruling was filed on 10 September 2018 by Johnson Ong, known by stage name DJ Big Kid, and was based on Article 9 of the Constitution. The second challenge was filed by LGBT rights activist Choong Chee Hong in November 2018 and argues that Section 377A is inconsistent with Articles 9, 12 and 14 of the Constitution. A third was filed by retired general practitioner Tan Seng Kee on 20 September 2019, also based on Articles 9, 12 and 14 of the Constitution. In addition, he argued that although the Government will not enforce the law on acts done in private, the Public Prosecutor can decide whether to prosecute someone under Section 377A, which would be inconsistent with Section 14 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which requires the police to \"unconditionally investigate all complaints of suspected arrestable offences\".\n\nOn 30 March 2020, justice See Kee Oon consolidated the three challenges into one case and ruled against them, arguing that the law was intended to safeguard morals and prosecute all forms of indecency between men whether in public or private, and not just male prostitution when the law was made in 1938. He also stated that there's no strong scientific evidence that a person's sexual orientation is unchangeable, and once again ruled that Parliament is the proper venue for repeal. Appeals were filed on 31 March 2020.\n\n\n\n"}

They alternated home stands with the Birmingham Barons in Birmingham's Rickwood Field, usually drawing larger crowds and equal press.\n\nDrawing largely from a successful American Cast Iron Pipe Company Industrial League team, the Black Barons were organized in 1920 for the inaugural season of Rube Foster's Negro Southern League, which operated mainly as a minor league. They played in that league for three years before making the leap to the larger Negro National League, which operated as a major league. They were unable to keep their position due to irregularities with the team finances and returned to the Southern League for three more years. Their return to the National League in 1927 was marked by the emergence of star pitcher Satchel Paige, who led the Black Barons to the second half pennant. They lost the Negro National League title to the Chicago American Giants in four straight games.\n\nFor the next decade or so they alternated leagues before being bought by Memphis, Tennessee, funeral home director Tom Hayes and joined the Negro American League in 1940. Early in the decade the team was sold again to Abraham Saperstein who also owned the Harlem Globetrotters basketball team. In 1943 and 1944 they won back-to-back pennants. Starting in 1945, they became full members of the Negro American League and continued their success, winning a third pennant in 1948 with the help of teenage outfielder Willie Mays. They ended up losing three Negro World Series to the Homestead Grays that decade, forging a notable rivalry. As the Major Leagues started signing talented African American players, the Black Barons tried to form a new Negro Southern League with three other Southern teams.\n\nThe franchise was owned by William Bridgeforth from 1952 to 1955, and by Sid Lynor and Floyd Meshac in 1955. Dr. Anderson Ross purchased the franchise in 1956 and renamed the team the Birmingham Giants.\n\nThe Black Barons played their last game in 1960.\n\nThe 1999 Rickwood Classic honored the Black Barons, with the Birmingham Barons and Huntsville Stars wearing throwback uniforms. Some 35 former Negro Leagues players, including former Black Baron Charley Pride attended.\n\nOn February 26, 2006, ESPN Classic broadcast a throwback game from Rickwood Field featuring amateur players in the uniforms of the Birmingham Black Barons and fictitious \"Bristol Barnstormers\". The style of play, the equipment and the umpires all reflected the 1940s game. Willie Mays and Charley Pride were both in attendance. The Black Barons rallied to break an eighth inning tie and win the game, 9–8.\n\nIn addition to Satchel Paige, Willie Mays also played as center fielder during both the 1948 and 1949 seasons. Mule Suttles was a member of the Black Barons in 1924 and 1925 seasons. Suttles was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2006. Other players, like Artie Wilson, Bill Greason, and Jay Heard also saw limited time (under 20 games each) in the Major Leagues.\n\n\n\n"}

The bulky cup nest is built in a tree and the normal clutch is of two to three grey-blotched whitish eggs. The female incubates the eggs, but is fed by the male.\n\nThe blue dacnis is 12.7 cm long and weighs 13 g. Despite its alternative name, it is not a honeycreeper, which are longer-billed. The adult male is turquoise blue with a black around the eyes, and on the throat and back. The wings and tail are black, edged with turquoise. The female and immature are mainly green with a blue head, paler green underparts and green-edged brown wings.\n\nThese are social birds which eat mainly insects gleaned from foliage, flowers or bromeliads.

The brand began in 1947, when International Latex Corporation (ILC) created a division named Playtex to produce and sell latex products. Playtex was the first to advertise undergarments on national television in 1955 and the first to show a woman wearing only a bra from the waist-up in a commercial in 1977.\n\nPlaytex-branded tampons were introduced in the 1960s and became the primary competition to incumbent Tampax. Playtex invented the plastic tampon applicator in 1973. It was one of the tampon manufacturers that were sued for aggressively advertising over-absorbent tampons, which led to toxic shock syndrome.\n\nPlaytex was acquired by Esmark in 1975, and then by Beatrice Foods in 1985. A year later it was acquired for $1.25 billion and its cosmetics brands were sold to Revlon. In 1988, Playtex split into two companies, Playtex Apparel Inc. and Playtex Products LLC. Playtex Apparel was sold to Sara Lee in 1991, and to HanesBrands in 2007.\n\nAbram Nathaniel Spanel founded Playtex's predecessor parent company, the International Latex Corporation, in Rochester, New York in 1932 to produce latex products, like bathing caps, swimwear and baby pants. ILC moved to Dover, Delaware, in 1939, making it the first large, non-agricultural business in the city.\n\nILC did not produce apparel for adults until the introduction of the Living Girdle in 1940, after patenting a method of manufacturing latex girdles that would not tear at the seams if they had a small tear or hole. The Living Girdle was advertised with images of mobility and comfort, such as women playing tennis or leaping while wearing it, though the solid rubber girdle was actually very uncomfortable.\n\nDuring World War II, the bombing of Pearl Harbor and the Japanese invasion of Malaysia cut off Allied manufacturers from their largest sources of latex. As supplies ran out and demand for consumer products fell, ILC halted production; sales would not resume until 1946. The company almost went out of business during the war, so it created an industrial division to find government and military applications for latex. Playtex was founded in 1947 as one of four divisions ILC re-organized into. Its name was a portmanteau of \"play\" and \"latex\", reflecting its focus on latex products. Playtex's marketing in the post-war era was influential in creating the shift from custom-tailored undergarments to manufactured sizes. For example, the company introduced large floor displays with fitting charts, so women could find the right size without a custom fitting.\n\nIn 1954, ILC was sold to Stanley Warner Corporation for $15 million($ in modern dollars). The following year, it was the first to advertise under-garments on network television. In 1962, the industrial division of Playtex was awarded a contract to develop space suits for the Apollo mission to the moon. Two years prior to the 1969 moon landing that used its latex suits, Playtex's industrial division was spun off, eventually becoming ILC Dover.\n\nPlaytex created a consumer products subsidiary, Playtex Products Inc., in 1960, which produced baby products, tampons and other consumer goods. It introduced and patented the first plastic tampon applicator in 1973.<ref name=\"Lafley/Charan2010\"></ref> By 1975, the five largest tampon manufacturers began competing with multimillion-dollar advertising budgets and Playtex became the primary competitor to market-leader Tampax. Playtex introduced a scented tampon that was advertised with the slogan, \"When you're wearing a tampon you don't worry about odor. But should you?\" After complaints were raised by Planned Parenthood a warning label was added saying that some women may experience irritation from the chemicals. Tampon manufacturers, including Playtex, were sued for aggressively advertising and competing over absorbency, when some studies found that excessive absorbency leads to toxic shock syndrome. In 1985, a judge offered to reduce an $11 million verdict against Playtex if they recalled their super-plus tampons and admitted they were killing women.\n\nJoel Smilow became chief executive officer (CEO) of Playtex in 1969 and was associated with the company through five owners. The company was acquired by Esmark in 1975 for $210 million ($ in modern dollars).\n\nBy the early 1980s, Playtex controlled 25 percent of the market for bras, giving it the largest market-share in the industry. In 1982, Playtex acquired the skin and hair products brand, Jhirmack Enterprises Inc., for $28.3 million ($ in 2018 dollars). Three years later Esmark sold Playtex to Beatrice Foods. Four years later an investor group led by Smilow bought Playtex for $1.25 billion ($ in modern dollars). To help fund the acquisition, the company's cosmetics brands, Max Factor, Almay and Halston, were sold to Revlon for $345 million ($ in modern dollars). \n\nThe following year, the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) relaxed rules regarding partial nudity on television, which previously forced undergarment manufacturers to use mannequins in their commercials, despite bathing suits and equally revealing swimwear being allowed. Playtex was the first to advertise with a live model wearing only a bra from the waist up. This attracted criticisms from members of the American Family Association and the Eagle Forum. \"The New York Times\" called the ads \"totally inoffensive\" and CBS's spokesman said they were \"well done, tasteful and not exploitative.\"\n\nOwnership of the remaining apparel and consumer products divisions were split among the company's leadership (28 percent), BCI Holdings (20 percent), Drexel Burnham (19 percent) and institutional investors (33 percent). The following year the company attempted to sell the Family Products division to Johnson and Johnson but the deal fell through.\n\nIn 1988 Playtex split into two companies, Playtex Apparel and Playtex Family Products, in a series of financial transactions totaling $1.3 billion. The transactions allowed Smilow to buy out other Playtex shareholders and put ownership of the brand into two separate investment groups that were owned by Smilow and other Playtex executives. In 1990 Playtex Products acquired cosmetics brand Maybelline for $300 million.($ in modern dollars). The next year Smilow sold Playtex Apparel to the Sara Lee Corporation, owner of the Bali and Hanes brands, for $571 million, ($ in modern dollars) but keeping the Playtex Family Products Corporation.\n\nIn November of that year, Sara Lee also bought a 25 percent stake in Playtex Family Products for $62.5 million ($ in modern dollars). Playtex Products Inc. went public in 1994. In 1995, another 40 percent of Playtex Products Inc. was sold to Haas Wheat & Harrison Investment Partners for $180 million ($ in modern dollars).\n\nPlaytex Products continued to erode Tampax's' market share throughout the late 20th century. The two companies had divided the market almost evenly by the late 1990s. Both makers increased profits primarily by reducing the tampon count per box, and prepared to enter emerging markets, particularly in Asia, where many women still used homemade pads. In 1997 Procter & Gamble (P&G), makers of Always sanitary napkins and pantiliners, bought Tambrands for $1.25 billion, its largest acquisition up to that point, returning to the tampon sector almost two decades after pulling Rely from the market over Toxic Shock Syndrome concerns.\n\nDue to its strong advantage among younger women, and baby boomers reaching menopause, Playtex continued to gain market share on Tampax. After extensive market research, Tampax reversed that trend with the 2002 introduction of Pearl, with an applicator designed to be as visually appealing as it was functional, and making the brand once again appealing to teens.\n\nPlaytex responded by litigating. In one suit, it alleged patent infringement over Pearl's applicator design. It also alleged that advertising claiming Tampax Pearl had better leakage protection and comfort than Gentle Glide was false. Playtex won a verdict prohibiting Tampax from making claims of superiority, until the decision was reversed in 2007, when Tampax made improvements in materials and manufacturing.\n\nIn 2006, Sara Lee spun off its clothing sector into HanesBrands Inc., which now runs the Playtex apparel business. The next year Playtex Products acquired the Hawaiian Tropic sunscreen company for $83 million. Later that year Playtex Products was acquired by Energizer Holdings for $1.16 billion. Playtex Products was sued in 2008, when a mother accused the company of not adequately disclosing their baby bottles contained bisphenol A. After Canada considered banning the chemical, the company took it out of their bottles the following year.\n\nIn 2013, the Playtex intimate apparel brand launched a $10 million integrated marketing campaign called \"Be Uniquely You.\" This 360 rebranding included new bra styles and packaging and a strong presence in social media and national TV ads. The new campaign was created by KraftWorks NYC.\n\nIn 2015, Energizer Holdings spun out several businesses including Playtex Products into a new company called Edgewell Personal Care. \n\nThe Playtex trademark is owned by Playtex Marketing Corp. in the United States and Canada. They license the trademark to HBI Branded Apparel Enterprise (a subsidiary of Hanesbrands) for Playtex-branded apparel and Playtex Products Inc (a subsidiary of Energizer Holdings) for baby products, gloves and feminine products. Hanesbrands and Energizer Holdings each own a fifty percent interest in Playtex Marketing Corp. Hanesbrands also owns the rights to the brand name for use with apparel internationally, except in Europe and South Africa, where DBA Apparel (itself acquired by Hanes in 2014) sells Playtex-branded apparel products. Playtex Products LLC is managed under the Personal Care Division of Energizer Holdings.\n\nAccording to Energizer Holdings' 2012 annual report, Playtex Products LLC is the largest producer of household gloves, hand wipes and sunscreen, as well as the second largest producer of tampons in the US. The best-selling Playtex tampon is the Gentle Glide brand, which was first introduced in 1973. It also manufactures the Playtex Sport tampon, which targets young athletes. Both brands are sold in regular, super and super-plus absorbency. Playtex had a 29 percent share of a $550 million market for tampons in 1994 and a 30 percent share of a $780 million market by 2000.\n\nHistorically baby products were a small portion of Playtex Products' revenues, but by 2000 they made up 38 percent of the company's revenues. As of that year it had a 60 percent share of the market for \"sippy cups\" and an 84 percent share of the market for disposable baby-bottle liners. Other baby products include Chubs Baby Wipes, Baby Magic toiletries (until 2007), and Diaper Genie. Playtex Products also manufactures the Banana Boat and Hawaiian Tropic sunscreen brands, household gloves, diaper pails, cleansing cloths and the Ortho-Pro and Binky pacifiers.\n\nPlaytex-branded apparel products sold by Hanesbrands include bras, panties and shapewear. According to Hanesbrands, Playtex is the fourth largest brand by revenue in its portfolio. The brand has the strongest loyalty among customers who prioritize fit. As of 2002, Playtex was the second most popular brand of bras. In addition to panties and shapewear, Playtex bra brands include:\n\nThe company has been producing and marketing the Cross Your Heart bra since 1954 under the slogan that it \"lifts and separates,\" a phrase that is now well known in popular culture. The Eighteen Hour bra has been marketed on the premise of comfort since the 1970s.\n\n"}

In 1908 Pope Pius X changed its name to the Congregation for Religious. In 1967 Pope Paul VI changed its name to the Congregation for Religious and Secular Institutes. Pope John Paul II gave the Congregation its current name.\n\nThe Congregation is responsible for everything which concerns religious orders and congregations, and societies of apostolic life regarding their government, discipline, studies, etc. It is competent also for matters regarding hermits, consecrated virgins, and new forms of consecrated life. It has no territorial limits, although certain questions may be remanded to other Vatican Congregations. The Congregation also handles matters concerning associations of the faithful formed with the intention of becoming institutes of consecrated life or societies of apostolic life, and for Third Orders Seculars. \n\nIn 1994, the Congregation noted,\"In some places it seems that religious community has lost its relevance in the eyes of women and men religious and is perhaps no longer an ideal to be pursued. ...In many countries, increased state programs in areas in which religious have traditionally been active—such as social service, education and health—together with the decrease in vocations, have resulted in a diminished presence of religious in works which used to be typically those of apostolic institutes. ...it is necessary to have religious communities with a clear charismatic identity, assimilated and lived, capable of transmitting them to others and disposed to share them, religious communities with an intense spirituality and missionary enthusiasm for communicating the same spirit and the same evangelizing thrust; religious communities who know how to animate and encourage lay people to share the charism of their institute, according to their secular character and according to their different style of life, inviting them to discover new ways of making the same charism and mission operative.\"\n\nOn the Feast of the Presentation of the Blessed Virgin Mary, November 21, 2014 Pope Francis declared a \"Year of Consecrated Life\" to begin on November 30, 2014, the First Sunday of Advent and continue to the Feast of the Presentation of Jesus at the Temple, February 2, 2016. The Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and for Societies of Apostolic Life planned a number of initiatives to facilitate encounters between members of different expressions of consecrated and fraternal life in the various Churches.\n\nPope Francis addressed the Congregation in January 2017 on the theme of \"Fidelity and perseverance\" saying, \"it is clear that one must first let oneself be evangelised in order to engage in evangelisation.\"\n\nInstitutes of consecrated life are canonically erected institutes in the Roman Catholic Church whose members profess the evangelical counsels by vows of chastity, poverty, and obedience. There are two types:\nReligious institutes are characterized by the public profession of vows, communal life, and a degree of separation from the world. \nSome Institutes are called Orders. These are Institutes in which, for historical reasons or because of their character or nature, solemn vows are made by at least some of the members. All members of these orders are called regulars (because they are governed by a Rule (i.e. \"regula\")), and if they are women they are called nuns (\"moniales\"). The orders are older than the congregations.\n\nOther religious institutes are called congregations. Their members make simple vows; women are called sisters. \n\nSecular Institutes is an organization of consecrated individuals who, unlike members of a religious institute who live in community, live in the world, and work for the sanctification of the world from within. \n\nInstitutes may also be classified as a \"clerical\" or \"lay institute\" depending on whether the members exercise Holy Orders.(can. 588.2, and (can. 588.3).\n\nA society of apostolic life is a group of men or women within the Catholic Church who have come together for a specific purpose and live fraternally.\n\nBoth Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life need the written approval of a bishop to operate within his diocese, although a diocesan bishop can establish an institute of consecrated life or society in his own territory, after consulting the Apostolic See.\n\nThe current Prefect is Cardinal João Braz de Aviz. The current Secretary is Archbishop José Rodríguez Carballo, O.F.M. The two Undersecretaries of the Congregation have been Father Pier Luigi Nava, S.S.M. since 27 November 2018 and Sister Carmen Ros Nortes, a member of the Sisters of Our Lady of Consolation, since 23 February 2018.\n\nOn 8 July 2019, in naming 21 new members to the Congregation, Pope Francis included women for the first time. all seven of them were superiors of their orders: Six are leaders of international religious orders, and one leads an institute of consecrated laywomen: Kathleen Appler, Yvonne Reungoat, Françoise Massy, Luigia Coccia, Simona Brambilla, Rita Calvo Sanz and Olga Krizova. Catherine Clifford, of Saint Paul University in Ottawa, said \"The recent move of Pope Francis represents a new and significant development in that it would give women a deliberative voice in the governing body of the congregation, which until now has been the domain of cardinals, bishops, and the heads of men's religious orders.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1929244", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1929244", "title": "Muscat and Oman", "text": "Muscat and Oman\n\nThe Sultanate of Muscat and Oman ( \"\") was a thalassocratic nation that encompassed the present-day Sultanate of Oman and parts of present-day United Arab Emirates and Gwadar, Pakistan. The country is not to be confused with the Trucial States, which were sheikhdoms under British protection since 1820. Muscat courts' verdicts were based on Ibadi Islamic sharia law and appeals were raised to the Sultan of Muscat, who exercised supreme ruling.\n\nThe expelling of the Portuguese colonizers happened during the Yaruba Imams era in the 17th century. The Yaruba Imams later succeeded in driving out the Portuguese colonizers from east Africa and established a maritime empire that extended its powers to the Persian Gulf and Zanzibar. The Yaruba dynasty later lost power to the Persian colonizers. In 1749, the Persian colonizers were defeated by the elected Imam Ahmad bin Said. The British empire was keen to dominate southeast Arabia to curb the influence of other European powers and to weaken the Omani Empire in the 18th century. The British empire thus backed the Albusaidi Sultans of Muscat that came to power in the second half of the 18th century. The British empire established a series of treaties with the Sultans with the objective of increasing British political and economic influence over Muscat. The Sultanate eventually became increasingly dependent on British loans and political advice.\n\nHistorical differences always existed between the more secular, rich, seafaring coastal Sultanate of Muscat and the tribes of the interior. Though the inland territories were under nominal control of the Sultans of Muscat, they were in practice run by tribal leaders and the conservative Imams of Oman, practitioners of the Ibadi sect of Islam.\nThe Sultanate of Muscat possessed a powerful naval force, which enabled the creation of a maritime empire dating from the expulsion of the Portuguese in 1650 through the 19th century, at times encompassing modern Oman, the United Arab Emirates, southern Baluchistan, and Zanzibar and the adjacent coasts of Kenya, Tanzania and Mozambique. The Sultanate of Muscat also engaged in a very lucrative slave trade across east Africa.\n\nIn the early 1820s, the Sultanate lost most of its territories in the Persian Gulf, which became the Trucial States under British protection. The fifth Sultan of the Al Said dynasty, Said bin Sultan, consolidated the Sultanate's territorial holdings and economic interests and Oman prospered. However, the Omani fleet was unable to compete with the more technically advanced European fleets and the Sultanate lost much of the trade with South Asia. Pressure by the British to abandon the slave trade further led to the loss of political and economic clout of the Sultanate.\n\nOn June 4, 1856, Said bin Sultan died without appointing an heir to the throne and members of the Al Said dynasty could not agree on a ruler. Through British mediation, two rulers were appointed from the Al Said clan; the third son of the Sultan, Thuwaini bin Said became ruler of the mainland. His sixth son, Majid bin Said, became ruler of an independent Sultanate of Zanzibar on October 19, 1856. The Sultans of Zanzibar were thereafter obliged to pay an annual tribute to Muscat.\n\nThe Imamate cause was renewed in the interior of Oman due to the development of British imperialism in the coastal Oman, the Sultanate of Muscat. In 1913, a rebellion was led by Imam Salim Alkharusi against Muscat to reestablish an Imamate in the interior region of Oman. The Imamate, similar to the Sultanate, was ruled by the Ibadi sect, however, the dispute between both parties was for the most part political. The Omanis in the interior believed that the ruler should be elected and rejected British control over the Sultanate. The Sultanate was however able to defend itself with British help. This historical split continued throughout much of the twentieth century with Sultan Taimur bin Feisal granting limited autonomy to the Imamate of Oman under the Ibadi clergy through the Treaty of Seeb in 1920.\n\nThe last overseas possession, the port of Gwadar across the Gulf of Oman, was sold to Pakistan in 1958. However, the sultanate did gain some territory in 1967, when Britain returned the Khuriya Muriya Islands (originally granted as a gift from the sultan to Queen Victoria in 1854).\n\nThe discovery of oil in the Persian Gulf exacerbated the dispute between the Sultan in Muscat and the Imams of Oman. Oil exploration had begun in the early 1920s by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. The course of the Second World War severely disrupted such activities. Further, the Sultanate of Muscat during that time was experiencing terrible social, economic and political conditions. The Sultunate was underdeveloped with no infrastructure or telephones, and Sultan Said bin Taimur prohibited anything that he considered \"decadent\", including radios. The British government continued to have vast political control over the Sultanate as the chief adviser to the Sultan, defense secretary and all ministers of the Sultanate except for one were British. The British government, Iraq Petroleum Company and the Sultan were keen to search for oil and made early plans (1946) to establish an army that could occupy the Imamate of Oman.\n\nThe last Imam of Oman, Ghalib Bin Ali, started an uprising in 1954 when the Sultan granted licenses to the Iraq Petroleum Company despite the fact that the largest oil fields lay inside the Imamate. The hostilities were put down in 1955, but the longer conflict would evolve into the Jebel Akhdar rebellion, where Sultan Said bin Taimur relied heavily on continued British military support. Iraq Petroleum, along with its operator of oil exploration, Petroleum Development Oman, was owned by European oil giants including Anglo-Iranian Oil's successor British Petroleum which encouraged the British government to extend their support to the Sultan.\n\nThe insurgency erupted again in 1957, when Saudi Arabia began supporting the Omani rebels, but eventually the Sultan was able to establish pre-eminence over most of the inland. The same year, British forces bombarded the town of Nizwa, the capital of the Imamate, and toppled the Ibadi theocracy. Ghalib Bin Ali went into exile in Saudi Arabia and the last rebel forces were defeated two years later, in 1959. The Treaty of Seeb was terminated and the autonomous Imamate of Oman abolished.\n\nThe frequency of uprisings such as the Dhofar Rebellion, supported by the communist government of South Yemen, motivated the British to supplant the Sultan. The British chose the Western-educated son of the Sultan, Qaboos bin Said who was locked up in the palace, because his paranoid father feared a coup. On his release, Qaboos bin Said, with the help of British military forces, staged a successful palace coup and was proclaimed Sultan of Muscat and Oman in 1970. The newly consolidated territories along with Muscat were reorganized into the present-day unified Sultanate of Oman by August 1970.\n\nIn 1976, again with British aid, the Sultan secured his hold over the entire interior and suppressed the Dhofar rebellion.\n\nThe Sohar Sultanate lasted from 1920 until about 1932. In 1920, Sheik Ali Banu Bu Ali, a relative of Sultan Taimur bin Faisal, rebelled in the northern town of Sohar and proclaimed himself Sultan but was deposed by the British in 1932.\n\n\n"}

They became Mariner teammates in 1990. In Ken Sr.'s first game as a Mariner, on August 31, 1990, the pair hit back-to-back singles in the first inning and both scored. On September 14, in the top of the first off California Angels pitcher Kirk McCaskill, the pair hit back-to-back home runs, becoming the first and only father-son duo to ever accomplish such a feat. The duo played a total of 51 games together before Ken Sr. retired in June 1991.\n\nIn 2001, Tim Raines and Tim Raines Jr. also played as teammates with the Baltimore Orioles.\n\nCecil and Prince Fielder are the only father-son combination each to hit 50 or more home runs in any season. Cecil Fielder hit 51 homers in 1990. Seventeen years later, his son, Prince, hit 50. Coincidentally, both Prince and Cecil hit exactly 319 home runs in their careers. \n\nFive families have had a father and son serve as manager: the Macks (Connie and Earle), the Sislers (George and Dick), the Skinners (Bob and Joel), the Boones (Bob and Aaron), and the Bells, (Buddy and David).\n\nIn 1992, Bret Boone became the first third-generation MLB player.\n\nAltogether, there have been five third-generation MLB-player families:\n\n\nThere have been four third-generation families affiliated with MLB in roles other than player:\n\n\nIn 2017, the Boone family was on the verge of becoming the first family to have produced four generations of players who reached the major leagues: Ray, Bob, Bob's sons, Aaron and Bret, and Bret's son, Jake, who was selected by the Washington Nationals in the 38th round of the 2017 MLB Draft. However, Jake did not sign and is currently not a professional as he instead plays for Princeton University. Because he is attending college, he will not be eligible for the draft or to sign a professional contract until 2020. More recently, the Bell family, consisting of Gus, Buddy, and Buddy's sons, David and Mike, is poised to become the first fourth-generation family. Mike's son, Luke, was selected by the Arizona Diamondbacks in the 34th round of the 2019 MLB Draft. Mike is currently the vice president of player development for the Diamondbacks.\n\nWhether any of the Boones or Bells see their great-grandson play in the majors, they will not represent the first great-grandfather/great-grandson combo in MLB history. In 1985, Bill Wilkinson made his big-league debut with the Seattle Mariners; his great-grandfather was Jim Bluejacket, who played for Brooklyn in the Federal League in 1914-15 and for the Cincinnati Reds in 1916.\n\nThe MacPhail family is the first family to have four generations affiliated with Major League Baseball in roles other than as players. Larry was the general manager of the Reds and Dodgers as well as the president, general manager, and co-owner of the Yankees. Larry's son, Lee, was president and general manager of the Orioles, executive vice president and general manager of the Yankees, and president of the American League. Larry and Lee are also the only father and son pair to have been inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. As an executive with the Reading Phillies of the Eastern League, until his untimely death at age 27 in an automobile accident in 1969, Lee MacPhail III secured the MacPhail family's baseball legacy as being the first to have had three generations of family members involved in baseball. Lee II's other son, Andy, is the current president of the Phillies and was previously general manager of the Twins, president and chief executive officer of the Cubs, and president of baseball operations for the Orioles. Lee MacPhail III's son, Lee MacPhail IV, has been the director of scouting for the Indians, Expos, Nationals, and Orioles. With Lee MacPhail IV's appointments, the MacPhail family's legacy extended to a fourth generation of family members involved in baseball.\n\nThe following families had a parent play top-level professional baseball in a league other than Major League Baseball, and a son who played in Major League Baseball:\n The National and American Leagues consolidated umpiring crews beginning in the season; umpires who worked after the consolidation are denoted with \"MLB\".<br>\n\n"}

{"id": "1929258", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1929258", "title": "Rastislav of Moravia", "text": "Rastislav of Moravia\n\nRastislav or Rostislav, also known as St. Rastislav, (Latin: \"Rastiz\", Greek: Ῥασισθλάβος / \"Rhasisthlábos\") was the second known ruler of Moravia (846–870). Although he started his reign as vassal to Louis the German, king of East Francia, he consolidated his rule to the extent that after 855 he was able to repel a series of Frankish attacks. Upon his initiative two brothers, Cyril and Methodius. sent by the Byzantine Emperor Michael III in 863, translated the most important Christian liturgical books into Slavonic. Rastislav was dethroned by his nephew Svatopluk I of Moravia, who handed him over to the Franks.\n\nAccording to the \"Annals of Fulda\", Rastislav was a nephew of Mojmir I, the first known ruler of Moravia. His career before 846 is unknown, but it is conceivable that he served as a hostage for his uncle at Louis the German's court. The latter invaded Moravia in 846, deprived Mojmir I of his throne, and installed Rastislav as the new duke of Moravia. Rastislav seems to have already been Christian when he became duke, but there is no doubt that he was baptized at the latest in 846 as part of the conditions for his support by the East Frankish king.\n\nIn the first eight years of Rastislav's reign there is no report of Moravian rebellion, which suggests that he remained loyal to Louis the German. In this period Rastislav seems to have acquired new territories in the east and established a border with the First Bulgarian Empire. According to the \"Annals of St-Bertin\", in 853 Charles the Bald, king of West Francia, bribed the Bulgarians to ally with the Slavs (apparently the Moravians) and together attack Louis the German's kingdom. In the course of the Bulgarian–Moravian attack, Louis the German deposed his prefect of the Eastland, Ratpot, who soon allied with Rastislav. The alliance suggests that, by this time, Rastislav felt secure enough to challenge Frankish overlordship.\n\nIn 855 the East Frankish king gathered a large army to invade Moravia. His army, however, foundered before the walls of one of Rastislav's strongholds, perhaps at Mikulčice (now in the Czech Republic) that seems to have been rebuilt in the previous years. Unprepared for a prolonged siege, the king was forced to withdraw from the region. As the king was retreating, his army defeated a large Moravian force that attacked his camp. Nevertheless, Rastislav's army followed the Franks and pillaged many of their estates on the river Danube.\nIn 856 Louis the German turned over the command of the southeastern marches of his kingdom to his son, Carloman with the responsibility to hold the Moravians in check. According to the \"Annals of Fulda\", Carloman led a new expedition against Rastislav in 858, but this campaign was also a failure, for Rastislav remained defiant. Carloman even struck an alliance with Rastislav against his father.\n\nPribina, the Slavic \"dux\" of Lower Pannonia, died fighting the Moravians in 861, which suggests that Carloman also had conceded this province to Rastislav. In response to the ongoing rebellion of his son and Rastislav, Louis the German negotiated a counteralliance with Boris I of Bulgaria. The king made it seem that he was leading a new campaign against Rastislav, but at the last moment he moved against Carloman, who thus had no choice but to surrender.\n\nIn order to increase his maneuverability, Rastislav attempted to curtail the activities of the Frankish missionaries in his realm. For this purpose, in around 862 he turned first to Rome. Having met with no success, he then asked for \"teachers\" in Constantinople, in order to educate local Moravians as priests. His embassy also emphasized the need for \"teachers\" capable of working in Slavic language.\n\nRastislav's request was granted when Constantine and Methodius, two brothers who had learned the Slavic dialect spoken in Thessaloniki (Greece), arrived with a few disciples in Moravia in 863. The two brothers undertook the task assigned to them by using the Slavonic language for teaching and for divine mass, and Constantine even created a script for the Slavs. The Frankish clergy soon came to realize that the activities of the two Byzantine brothers represented a threat to their influence. As the Byzantine missionaries enjoyed Rastislav's protection, Louis the German dispatched Bishop Solomon of Constance to Rome where he described how the diocese of Passau had been \"fragmented and brought to ruin\" by the defection of the Moravians.\n\nLouis the German was also planning to launch a major campaign against Rastislav with the support of Boris I of Bulgaria. Although at the last minute the latter pulled out of the campaign, Louis' new expedition against Rastislav was a success. In August 864 Louis the German invaded Moravia, crossing the Danube to besiege the \"civitas Dowina\" (identified, although not unanimously, with Devín Castle in Slovakia). The king apparently took Rastislav by surprise, and trapped him within the fortress. Unable to escape the Frankish siege, Rastislav surrendered, turned over a numerous high-ranking hostages and swore a new oath of fidelity.\n\nThe king's campaign, however, did not result in the subjugation of Rastislav. In 865, according to the \"Annals of St-Bertin\", Louis the German sent his hosts against the \"Wends\" (Slavs), and the \"Annals of Fulda\" reports for the same year that Werner, a count in Upper Pannonia, was summoned before the king, accused of conspiring with Rastislav. In late 866 Constantine and Methodius departed from Moravia for Venice where the pope's envoys persuaded them to come to Rome. Here Pope Hadrian II approved their Slavic translations of the Scriptures, consecrated their Slavic disciples as priests, and even allowed them to sing the Slavic liturgy in Rome's churches.\n\nEarly in 868 Louis the German's son Carloman fought two successful engagements against Rastislav and returned with plunder. In August the king himself was planning to invade Moravia again, but he suddenly fell ill. Now the king's youngest son, Charles the Fat, advanced on Rastislav's stronghold and burned all of his fortifications, seized treasures, and defeated all who came against him in battle. By that time, according to the \"Annals of Fulda\", Rastislav, who had earlier granted his \"old city\" to his nephew Svatopluk, ruled from his \"indescribable fortress\" that might be identified with Mikulčice (Czech Republic). In 869 Pope Hadrian II who had decided to revive the archdiocese of Illyricum consecrated Methodius archbishop of Sirmium (Sremska Mitrovica, Serbia) and papal legate of all the Slavs living in the territories ruled by Rastislav, Svatopluk and Pribina's son, Koceľ.\n\nSvatopluk, in the meantime, entered into negotiations with Carloman without Rastislav's knowledge, and accepted Carloman's lordship over his person and his realm. Rastislav was \"beside himself with rage\" when he learned of his nephew's betrayal, and arranged for assassins to strangle Svatopluk at a banquet. The latter, however, was warned of the plan and evaded death by pretending to go hawking. When Rastislav set out with his soldiers to hunt down his nephew, Svatopluk captured his uncle and sent him in bonds to Carloman.\n\nRastislav was dispatched under guard to Regensburg (Louis' capital city) while Carloman invaded Rastislav's realm and subdued all of his fortresses. Louis the German had Rastislav presented to him bound with a heavy chain. While the assembled Franks, Bavarians, and Slavs condemned Rastislav to death for treason, the king commuted his punishment to blinding and imprisonment. Rastislav died in prison. Rastislav was canonised in 1994 by the Czech and Slovak Orthodox Church in Prešov.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1929260", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1929260", "title": "Paisa (region)", "text": "Paisa (region)\n\nA Paisa is someone from a region in the northwest of Colombia, including the part of the Andes in Colombia. The Paisa region is formed by the departments of Antioquia, Caldas, Risaralda and Quindío. Some regions of Valle del Cauca Department (north) and Tolima Department (west) culturally identify as \"paisas\". The main cities of the Paisa region are Medellín, Pereira, Manizales and Armenia.\n\nThe name Paisa derives from the Spanish apocope of \"Paisano\" (countryman), but they are also known as \"Antioqueños\" (those from the old Antioquia, which included the other Paisa provinces, which was a single administrative body until the creation of the Caldas State in 1905). Although many refer to Paisas as an ethnic group (\"raza antioqueña\" or \"raza paisa\"), they are a part of the Colombians and Latin American peoples.\n\nPaisas can be found in other regions of Colombia and the Americas where they have migrated. They have such a particular way of speaking Spanish that some writers refer to as \"español antioqueño\".\nThe Paisas have been considered a genetically isolated population according to scientific studies. As evidenced by the analysis of direct-line mitochondrial DNA or mtDNA (inherited from mother-to-child) and Y-chromosomal DNA or Y-DNA (inherited from father-to-son), the initial founding of the Paisa population occurred primarily through the admixture of male Iberians (mostly from various Spaniard ethnic groups, and a smaller Sephardic Jewish element) and female Amerindians.\n\nSubsequently, within the emerging Paisa colonial society, a continued flow of additional male Spaniards immigrating into the Paisa region in the following generations encouraged marriages of these males to the early established Paisa population. This increased the overall European component and resulted in the \"racial whitening\" of the founding mixed-race population by preventing the mixed-race individuals marrying among themselves and growing in numbers, as well as preventing further unions of either Spaniards or mixed-race individuals with unmixed Amerindians.\n\nUltimately, this led to the overall predominantly European ancestry of today's Paisa population according to testing of autosomal DNA or atDNA, despite the asymmetrical sex-specific genetic markers that they inherited from the founding population which indicates their Y-DNA as being predominantly from European male forebears and mtDNA as being predominantly from Amerindian female ancestors.\n\nThe mountains played a large role in isolating the Paisa population until the end of the nineteenth century and the area's industrial revolution. The nineteenth and early twentieth century also brought further Spanish, European non-Spanish, and Middle Eastern immigrants to the region, notably from France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany and Switzerland. Most of these immigrants ended up intermixing with the Paisa population, further diluting the overall Amerindian atDNA.\n\nThe ancestors of the Paisa are primarily Spanish immigrants from Extremadura, Spain (sixteenth century). The first colonizers were Extremaduran like Gaspar de Rodas of Trujillo, who was the first colonial governor of the region. Several towns, cities and places in the Paisa Region are also Extremaduran: Medellín for Medellín of Badajoz; Cáceres for the Province of Cáceres; Valdivia for conqueror Pedro de Valdivia.\n\nSome conquerors from Andalusia like Marshall Jorge Robledo of Jaén, came also with the Extremadurans during the sixteenth century. However, during the seventeenth century a group of Andalusian migrants is said to have settled the region.\n\nThe presence of Basque ancestry in the Paisa Region is exhibited by the proliferation of Basque surnames. Some scholars point out that this may be one of the regions of Hispanic America with the greatest concentration of ancestry from the Iberian region. The Basques arrived in Antioquia during the seventeenth century.\n\nThe use of Basque language (Euskera) terminology in the present territory of Colombia goes back to the early exploration which occurred in 1499, during the third voyage of Columbus. It is said that from that time the territory experienced a strong influx of Basques including prominent figures such as the pilot and geographer Juan de la Cosa, nicknamed \"El Vizcaino\" (although some reputable sources claim that he was not a native of the Basque Country, but was instead born in Santoña, Cantabria).\n\nThereafter, the Basques began to come regularly and distributed throughout the country. Due to this presence, the Colombian department of Antioquia has been considered a major point of Basque-Navarre immigration. This occurred mainly during the colonial era, when hundreds of Basques migrated to be linked to the Spanish colonization companies.\n\nTo people interested in investigating the presence of Euskal Herria in the department of Antioquia, one of the questions that troubles them relates to the use and retention of the Basque language in the department.\n\nIt is estimated that for Antioquia, a region where hundreds of Spaniards arrived, of which a good portion were Basque, limited aspects of the Basque culture and traditions were brought over, without even mentioning the particular language. It has been difficult to track the use of Euskara in Antioquia and Colombia because the Basque language was always an outcast, which apparently left no written evidence in Antioquia.\n\nThis is likely because the Spanish crown, to maintain the monopoly of its overseas companies and to restrict those people not belonging to Spanish rule, did not allow languages other than Castilian to be spoken. This meant that those invited to participate in the colonization of Indian companies, and foreigners in general, had to learn the official language, i.e., Castilian, hence the prevalence of Castilian-Basque-speaking bilinguals.\n\nDespite these restrictions, it is still possible to trace the history of Colombia's ties to the ancient language of the Basques. A reference that has use of Euskara in Colombian territory occurred in relation to Lope de Aguirre, a native of Gipuzkoa nicknamed \"The Madman\". Aguirre's rebellion defied the Spanish empire, carrying out acts against the subjects of the Spanish crown. Pedro de Ursúa, a Navarrese faithful to the Spanish king, who was also the founder of Pamplona in eastern Colombia, said that he could persuade the soldiers to be part of Aguirre's revolt, if they spoke in Euskera.\n\nDuring the seventeenth and eighteenth century Basque families from Northern Spain settled in the Aburrá Valley where Medellín and Envigado are located, as well as small towns in eastern Antioquia, such as Marinilla, El Retiro and El Santuario. This part of Antioquia reminded these families of northern Spain.\n\nThere is debate about Jewish ancestry in the Paisa people.\n\nIt was known that some Spanish and Portuguese New Christians of Sephardic Jewish ancestry (some of whom continued to practice Judaism secretly, and were also known as marranos, Spanish for swine) fled the Cartagena de Indias Inquisition and took refuge in the Antioquian mountains during the sixteenth and seventeenth century. Some Colombian authors like Jorge Isaacs and Miguel Ángel Osorio have claimed that it is indisputable that Paisas have Jewish ancestry. Several Paisa surnames are known to have been prevalent among New Christian conversos of Sephardic Jewish origin, for example Espinosa, Pérez, Mejía, and many others.\n\nSome scholars state that the presence of Sephardic Jews among the ancestors of Paisas is a fact, but it does not mean that all Paisas descend from them, nor that it is the only or predominant element among those that do, as is proven by the Paisas' descent from other groups like Basques, Extremadurans, Andalusians and Catalans.\n\nThere are records also of presence of some Canarians and Canarian families, at least some of them known to be from Lanzarote, who settled in Cáceres, Antioquia, in the second half of the 16th century. Others emigrated in 1678 by the terms of the\"Tributo de Sangre\" to Santa Marta. In 1536, Pedro Fernández de Lugo led an expedition of 1,500 people, 400 of whom were Canarians from all the different islands that make up the archipelago), for the conquest of the area around what became Santa Marta. This contingent pacified the warring tribes on the coast and penetrated into the interior (including Paisa region). On the way, they founded several cities, two which, Las Palmas and Tenerife, still exist. In addition, Pedro de Heredia led 100 men from the Canary Islands to Cartagena de Indias.\n\nAlthough the facts of the presence of Catalan people in the origins of all Colombians have been a matter of studies, the Catalan genetic and influence in the Paisa Region has been also of particular analysis, especially in the way Paisas use their Spanish language and elements of the traditional customs as well as surnames.\n\nAlthough the expression \"Paisa\" is of popular use as apocope of \"Paisano\" (person from one's own country; fellow countryman), the origin of the expression goes back to a separatist movement that brewed through the region in the mid nineteenth Century. Those politicians that secretly supported secession would refer to the new country as \"País A\", short for País Antioquia. The moniker eventually was fused to create the word \"paisa\". Consequently, \"\"Paisa Region\"\" is the region where the Paisa people live. A more ancient expression is \"Antioqueño\" (Antioquean; one from Antioquia). This one is more official, especially during the Colony (16th - eighteenth centuries) and the nineteenth century after the Independence of Colombia. All the region made a single body as \"Province of Antioquia\" first and \"State of Antioquia\" after. In 1905 the Caldas Department was created from the southern part of Antioquia, rendering the word \"\"Antioqueño\"\" remain only applicable to those of Antioquia, while \"Paisa\" became a more cultural one for both the new Antioquia and the former Antioquia and the rest of the Eje cafetero.\n\nAlthough some sources argue that the American Indians that populated most of the Paisa Region were extinguished through European diseases and fights against the Spaniard conquerors, this has not been fully demonstrated.\n\nFrancisco César made an expedition in 1537 from Urabá to the Cauca River to the lands of Dabeiba, but his troops were rejected by the Nutibaras. In 1540 Marshall Jorge Robledo founded Cartago. In 1541 he founded Arma in what is today the south of Antioquia, near today Aguadas and Santa Fe de Antioquia, at the banks of the Cauca River. This last town would become the provincial capital in 1813.\n\nThe first colonial governor was Don Gaspar de Rodas (1518–1607). The mountains of Antioquia attracted the Spaniards for its gold and lands for cattle, and the first towns were located near gold mines and rivers. Despite that, the region did not attract a population interested in creating important centers for the Spanish civilization like Cartagena de Indias, Popayán or Bogotá and it remained almost entirely isolated from the rest of the colony. This is the main reason for the cultural identity of the Paisas within the Colombian national context.\n\nSince the seventeenth century and until the end of the nineteenth centuries, Paisa families moved to the southern regions of Antioquia, in what is today the Colombian Coffee-Growers Axis or the \"\"Viejo Caldas\"\" (Old Caldas), though now most Colombian nationals refer to this region as the Eje cafetero. This constant internal migration is known in history as the \"\"Colonización Antioqueña\"\" (Antioquean Colonization). Most of the cities and towns founded in the Old Caldas (Caldas, Risaralda, Quindío and some towns of the north of Valle del Cauca and the west of Tolima) are from that time.\n\nDuring the wars for the independence of Colombia, the most important Paisa figure was General José María Córdova. He was from Rionegro and fought important battles to free the region from the Spanish regime under the orders of Simón Bolívar, who never went to the region. During Bolívar's campaign to liberate New Granada, Córdoba participated in the Battle of Boyacá and was entitled \"Lieutenant Colonel\" by the Libertador, despite his young age (he was only 20). Then he was charged by Bolívar to defend the Province of Antioquia and in fact he defeated the Spaniards during the Campaign of Nechí between the end of 1819 and the beginning of 1820.\n\nIn 1826 Medellín was declared the capital of the Province of Antioquia. In 1856 a Federalist Political Constitution created the State of Antioquia and it faced some civil wars among Liberals and Conservatives. In 1877 the president of the federal state was Pedro Justo Berrío, who was one of the most prominent political leaders of the region at the end of the century and developed an active politic in education, transportation (including connecting the region with the rest of the country by train in 1874) and economic development.\n\nIn 1886, with a centralized Political Constitution, the \"Department of Antioquia\" was created. Although the region was not affected directly by the Thousand Days War (1899–1902), one of the main characters of the fighting, General Rafael Uribe Uribe at the side of the Liberal Party rebels, came from the area.\n\nThe progressive government of General Rafael Reyes (1904–1909) was of benefit in the development for the region. One of his projects was the creation of new departments, including the Caldas Department to be taken from the southern part of Antioquia in 1905. During the twentieth century both Paisa departments (Antioquia and Caldas), would continue their development in industry, mining and agriculture. In 1966 the Caldas Department was divided in three parts: Caldas itself, Quindío and Risaralda.\n\nAt the end of the century the region faced the crisis of growing drug traffic mafias, paramilitary groups and guerrillas, especially in Antioquia with the Medellín Cartel and the north of Valle del Cauca. However, development has proved to be a Colombian model in regions like the Metropolitan Area of Medellín according to the Inter-American Development Bank.\n\nAlthough what is known as \"Paisa Region\" is a cultural entity and it is not defined by administrative divisions, it is possible to locate some areas as the natural space of the Paisa people.\n\n\nAlthough they are very attached to their country land, Paisas have been always prompt to migrate in search of better opportunities. This fact has been of great benefit for the development of some regions in Colombia, first during the \"Antioquean Colonization\" of the Colombian Coffee Axis between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries, and currently to other regions of the nation like the Llanos Orientales (East of Colombia). They keep their traditions and love for commerce, agriculture and mines wherever they go. In the Llanos Orientales, for example, several haciendas of cattle are owned by Paisa families. They are one of the main Colombian groups to migrate to foreign countries, especially to United States (including Puerto Rico), Spain and some Latin American countries like Panama, Mexico, Argentina and Costa Rica.\n\nPaisas are distinguished in Colombia for their natural love and abilities for business and commerce. The Paisa Region coincided with the important economic centers of Colombia like the Metropolitan Area of Medellín (textile, industries like appliances, automobiles and chemicals, services like health care and fashion); the Colombian Coffee-Growers Axis in agriculture and other economic activities like flower growing, cattle, gold and coal mines, tourism and others.\n\nThe way Paisas speak Spanish, also known as \"\", is distinctive within Colombia. Paisas are said to speak Spanish fast and soft. They have many local and regional expressions that are opaque even for other Colombians. From the rural Paisa dialect, a popular urban version called developed.\n\n\nPaisas are very attached to their families and land. As their natural cultural space is on the mountains, it is also a symbol of their land. They give a great importance to surnames and ancestors. They even associate surnames to towns (\"\"los Pérez son de San Pedro de los Milagros\"\", the Pérez [family] are from San Pedro de los Milagros). Though the patrilinear character is very important for families, Paisas keep a strong matriarchal culture.\n\nPaisas are well known in Colombia for their kindness and welcoming aptitude to persons from other regions and visitors. They are known to joke and exaggerate creating enjoyable conversations, though this can confuse those who are not used to their way of speaking. They speak proudly of their land, towns, cities, history, traditions and abilities in commerce. It is common that Paisas do not use their local demonym (for example, \"\"medellinenses\", \"manizalitas\", etc), but they refer to themselves as \"Paisas\".\n\nThe Paisa cuisine is very influenced by their traditional rural background of the mountains. It belongs to the Colombian Andes cuisine with abundance of beans, rice, maize, pork and cattle meat, tropical fruits, potato and several types of vegetables.\n\n\nThe Paisa Region is center of different genres of music among traditional, modern and adopted. The most important instruments of music by tradition are the tiple and the guitar.\n\n\nRoman Catholicism in Colombia arrived in the region with the Spaniard colonizers at the beginning of the sixteenth century. Franciscans settled along with colonizers and built churches and monasteries in the towns founded by the Spaniards. Perhaps Spanish and Portuguese marranos arrived in the region as well. Roman Catholicism became the predominant religion and Paisas remained devout and churchgoing. The 1991 Colombian Political Constitution that decreed freedom of religion opened the gates to other religious denominations, though Paisas are considered Catholics by culture. The theory of Jewish origins has benefited the Jewish communities in the region as well. The two first Colombian persons recognized by the Catholic Church as blessed or saints are from the Paisa Region: Laura Montoya (from Jericó) and Mariano de Jesús Euse (from Yarumal). A Paisa prelate from Tolima, Cardinal Alfonso López Trujillo, was close to the Pope John Paul II.\n\nSeveral Paisa personalities have been famous in regional, national and international contexts in every field of science, sport, music, technology, economy, politics and even crime. Some of the most notable in an international context:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1929263", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1929263", "title": "Field Day Theatre Company", "text": "Field Day Theatre Company\n\nThe Field Day Theatre Company began as an artistic collaboration between playwright Brian Friel and actor Stephen Rea. In 1980, the duo set out to launch a production of Friel's recently completed play, \"Translations\". They decided to rehearse and premiere the play in Derry with the hope of establishing a major theatre company for Northern Ireland. The production and performance of \"Translations\" generated a level of excitement and anticipation that unified, if only for a short time, the various factions of a divided community.\n\nAlthough Field Day has never put forth a formal mission statement, their intention was to create a space, a 'fifth province,' that transcended the crippling oppositions of Irish politics. The term 'fifth province' — Ireland now consists of four provinces, but the Irish term \"cúige\" signifies 'a fifth portion' and there were five historic provinces – was coined by the editors of an Irish Journal, \"The Crane Bag\", to name an imaginary cultural space from which a new discourse of unity might emerge. In addition to being an enormous popular and critical success, Field Day's first production created just such a space. After the production of \"Translations\", Seamus Heaney, Ireland's most prominent poet, recognised the importance of what they had accomplished and urged Brian Friel to continue with the project: \"this was what theatre was supposed to do\" (cited in Richtarik, 65).\n\nThat the company was established in Derry, Northern Ireland's \"second city,\" is significant. Although Friel knew the city well (he had lived there until 1967), Derry, being close to the border, was a hot-spot in the north-south tensions during \"The Troubles\". Furthermore, its western location and its relationship to Belfast, Northern Ireland's east coast capital, underline a second historically older division in Ireland – the division between the cosmopolitan east and the rural, romantic west.\n\nWhat began with a desire to develop a local Northern Irish theatre and make it available to a popular audience, quickly grew into a much larger cultural and political project. Even before the company's opening performance, four prominent Northern Irish writers were invited to join the project — Seamus Deane, David Hammond, Seamus Heaney, and Tom Paulin; they would eventually become Field Day's board of directors. (Thomas Kilroy, the only member born in the Republic, joined the board in 1988). All of the members of Field Day agreed that art and culture had a crucial role to play in the resolution of what had come to be known as \"the Troubles\":\n\nThe directors believed that Field Day could and should contribute to the solution of the present crisis by producing analyses of the established opinions, myths and stereotypes which had become both a symptom and a cause of the current situation. (Ireland's Field Day vii)\n\nField Day became an artistic response to the violence, history and politics which divided Northern Ireland into a series of seemingly irresolvable dichotomies; Orange/Green, Unionist/Nationalist and Protestant/Catholic are only the most prominent.\n\nEvery year saw a new production open in Derry and begin a tour of venues large and small throughout both Northern Ireland and the Republic. While Field Day's artistic venture continued to fulfil its original mandate of bringing \"professional theatre to people who might otherwise never see it\" (Richtarik 11), in September 1983 they launched a project whose target audience was primarily the academic community. The Field Day Theatre Company began publishing a series of pamphlets \"in which the nature of the Irish problem could be explored and, as a result, more successfully confronted than it had been hitherto\" (Ireland's Field Day viii).\n\nThe first set of three pamphlets were written by directors of the Field Day Company – Tom Paulin, Seamus Heaney and Seamus Deane. The pamphlets were largely responsible for entering Field Day into the political debate whose calcified terms the project had originally wanted to explode. With Tom Paulin's \"Riot Act\" (1984) the division between critic and artist began to crumble, the politics of the pamphlets were finding their way into the plays (Richtarik 242).\n\nIn the 1990 introduction to \"Nationalism, Colonialism, and Literature\" — a collection of three Field Day Pamphlets by Terry Eagleton, Fredric Jameson and Edward Said — Deane writes: \"Field Day's analysis of the (Northern Irish) situation derives from the conviction that it is, above all, a colonial crisis\" (Eagleton 6). In this essay Deane calls for a re-engagement with the concept of nationalism, and positions Field Day in a squarely antithetical position to those he refers to as revisionist historians and critics, whose chief aim is \"to demolish the nationalist mythology\" (6). The categories of revisionist and anti-revisionist were all too easily superimposed onto the categories of unionist and nationalist, and the space between them, created by the production of Translations, was closing fast. For some, Seamus Deane had become the de facto spokesman, and Field Day became increasingly associated with republican politics and post-colonial theory.\n\nBy this time Field Day was no longer a novel experiment; it was part of the establishment: \"That Field Day was attacked for being nationalist and for being anti-nationalist was a positive sign insofar as it proved that the company was raising questions generally, but the fact that the debate had narrowed so quickly to the old terms indicated that Field Day was losing the moral and artistic high ground\" (Richtarik 249).\n\nIn 2005, Field Day Publications was launched in association with the Dublin school of the Keough-Naughton Institute for Irish Studies at the University of Notre Dame, Indiana. With Seamus Deane as General Editor, the company's first publication was \"Field Day Review 1\", an annual journal primarily concerned with Irish literary and political culture, but in an international context. To critical acclaim, \"Field Day Review\" has published essays and interviews by numerous eminent academics, including Benedict Anderson, Giovanni Arrighi, Tariq Ali, Terry Eagleton, Seamus Deane, Pascale Casanova, Alan Ahearne, Kevin Whelan, David Lloyd, Brendan O'Leary, Luke Gibbons, and Joe Cleary. \"Field Day Review 10\" was published in October 2014.\n\nTo date, Field Day Publications has published 24 titles in the fields of literary criticism, history, Irish art music, cultural studies, art history and 18th-century Irish poetry.\n\nFrom the beginning Field Day struggled to establish a cultural identity, not just for the North, but for the Irish. Much like the stated intentions of the Irish National Theatre established by W. B. Yeats and Lady Gregory almost one hundred years earlier (Harrington vii), the goal was not just to reach or represent an audience, but to create an audience. History, and Field Day's post-colonial sensibilities, determined that the construction of Irishness would often be worked out against notions of Britishness. In a pointed and humorous verse epistle, \"An Open Letter,\" Heaney responds to his inclusion in \"The Penguin Book of Contemporary British Poetry\":\n\nThe Field Day directors recognised that in order for Ireland to claim \"Its proper name\" Irish literature would need its own comprehensive anthology .\n\nIn 1990 Field Day Published the three-volume \"Field Day Anthology of Irish Writing\", edited by Seamus Deane. The project, according to Deane, was nothing less than an \"act of definition\", one which he hoped would be inclusive and representative of the plurality of Irish identity: \"There is a story here, a meta-narrative, which is, we believe, hospitable to all the micro-narratives that, from time to time, have achieved prominence as the official version of the true history, political and literary, of the island's past and present\". The \"Anthology\" was immediately attacked by Field Day's critics as politically biased. The anthology's most conspicuous flaw, however, was the paucity of women writers. In response to the accusations that Field Day had elided the female voice, a new all-female board of editors issued two additional volumes, which exceeded the first three in length.\n\nStarting in early 2017, Field Day started to commission articles for every issue of Village Magazine, a leftist current affairs publication issued in Dublin. The Field Day Podcast appeared in January 2018.\nThe annual Seamus Deane Lecture was inaugurated in 2015 with a lecture by Deane himself. The 2016 lecture was delivered by Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, and in 2017-18 a set of three lectures were delivered by Dr Bryan McMahon, Dr. Conor Kenny of Médecins sans Frontières, and by Seamus Deane himself.\n\n"}

Gouryella was originally a Dutch production team, comprising Corsten and Tiësto, who later left. The word itself means \"heaven\" in the Australian aboriginal language. \n\nIn 2015, his track \"Anahera\" was chosen as \"Tune of the Year\" on Armin van Buuren's show A State of Trance.\n\nIn 1998, Dutch musicians Ferry Corsten and Tiësto collaborated to create Gouryella. In time there were twenty separate album releases of the first four Gouryella tracks from nine different record labels. One of those albums was \"In Search of Sunrise\". Gouryella has produced eight tracks: \"Gouryella\", \"Gorella\", \"Walhalla\", \"In Walhalla\", \"Tenshi\", \"Ligaya\", \"Anahera\" and \"Neba\". \"Gorella\" and \"In Walhalla\" were B-sides and were not released in the UK, although they did appear on the respective German and Dutch import albums.\n\nThe first single, \"Gouryella\", was released in May 1999 and became a huge hit scoring various chart positions around the world, including a top fifteen position in the UK Singles Chart. A remix vinyl, containing remixes by Armin van Buuren and Colin Tevendale and Stuart Crichton under their Gigolo alias, was released later. After the success of \"Gouryella\", Corsten and Tiësto hit the studio together again and came up with their more commercially orientated follow-up single, entitled \"Walhalla\". The single, which also included a remix from Armin, as well as Hybrid, was released in September. Complemented with vocals by Rachel Spier, \"Walhalla\" became again an international success and solidified Gouryella's status as a production duo. This reputation was backed up when both singles were certified Gold on record sales. On October 24, 1999, Corsten and Tiësto were profiled on an episode of the Dutch TV show Lola da Musica, documenting their gigs in Ibiza and Glasgow, and the making of \"Walhalla\".\n\nAlso in 1999, Gouryella remixed two tracks for other artists: Binary Finary - 1999 and Solange - Messages. Additionally, Ferry Corsten and Tiësto released two tracks under the name of Vimana. \"We Came\" appeared on Tiësto's Black Hole Recordings and featured a B-side \"Dreamtime\". The release of \"Tenshi\" (Japanese for \"angel\") in 2000 featured some remixes from Transa, ATB and Ratty (Scooter). The single has been included in video games such as \"FIFA Football 2002\" and \"Dance Dance Revolution X2\". \n\nIn late 2001, there were rumours in the forums of Trance.nu that Gouryella had suffered a split when Tiësto left the act. To get the rumours confirmed, the site's staff sent a mail to Black Hole Recordings, to which Arny Bink, the co-founder of the label, replied and said: \"I can confirm that Gouryella have split up, and although there will be new Gouryella tracks, Tiësto will no longer produce them. This is for artistical reasons only, Ferry and Tiësto are still good friends.\" After the article about DJ Tiësto's album \"In My Memory\" in Mixmag's November 2001 issue where Tiësto stepped on Ferry Corsten's feet by saying \"It's great to show the world I'm not just another Ferry Corsten\" many took the rumours about a possible Gouryella split as the result. But according to Purple Eye Entertainment's Brian Dessaur it was not at all the background to the split of Gouryella. \"Due to the very busy schedule's of Ferry and Tijs, they aren't able to get together in the studio at the moment. This does not mean that there will never be a new Gouryella single in the near future,\" he said. On December 27, 2001, Bink contacted the site and handed over a statement from Tiësto, which read: \n\nJust a few minutes after this statement was handed to Trance.nu another mail was sent to the site, this time from Dessaur, who announced that there would be a new single in the spring of 2002 on Purple Eye. Despite his statement, and his desire to produce an album together with Ferry Corsten, Tiësto did not rejoin the act and left Corsten by himself to write and produce Gouryella's next singles.\n\nFollowing the departure of Tiësto, Corsten would collaborate with Dutch composer John Ewbank to produce the fourth Gouryella single. In the beginning of 2002, they started to work on the track. Titled \"Ligaya\" (Tagalog for \"happiness\"), it was released with a remix pack from Hiver & Hammer and Green Court, plus an extra Ferry Corsten Remix. Dutch duo Rank 1 also did a remix which, although not officially released, did see Rank 1 play it in some of their sets in 2002 and 2003. A stream of remixes by fans soon followed the original release, most notably by Airbase who allowed people to download his own remix for free before the original was released to the public. 2003 saw the release of \"Ligaya\"'s hard mixes by Yoji Biomehanika and Walt. Resident Advisor reviewed \"Ligaya\" and gave it a score of 4.5 out of 5, saying: \"Regardless this track is big, the percussion is used to perfection in the break giving the track enough emotion to compete the best of them, similar in style to William Orbit’s Barber’s Adagio for Strings which also received massive recognition with a Ferry Corsten mix. Truly an example of what kind of emotion can be used within dance music Ligaya must be heard to be believed, another massive release from Gouryella. Brilliant!.\"\n\nIt took several years for Gouryella to resurface as news. Rumours circulated the internet that Gouryella were due to release a track called \"Maya\" in 2012, however a status update on Facebook posted on November 7, 2011 by Ferry Corsten suggested that this rumour was in fact untrue. Ferry commented \"I've read some rumors on the internet about a new track called \"Maya\"... Can somebody send me a link, I'm very curious to hear it myself too!.\" In 2013, the Facebook page and YouTube channel called \"Trance Classics\" started a campaign in order to get the first Gouryella single to the #1 position of the Beatport Trance Chart. With the support of Corsten, Tiësto and Aly & Fila, in just a few days time the track made it to the #3 position, with proceeds being donated to the Ronald McDonald House Charities.\n\nAfter a 13-year break, Ferry Corsten announced the return of his Gouryella alias with a new uplifting trance track called \"Anahera\", which was released on June 15, 2015 through Flashover Recordings. The single was voted as \"Tune of the Year\" by the listeners of A State of Trance. \"Anahera\" also became the best selling trance track of 2015 on Beatport, the longest #1 trance track in Beatport history and the first ever trance track to reach the Beatport Main Top 10. When asked about his decision to revive his trance moniker, Corsten told \"Fuse\": \"I felt like bringing Gouryella back for a certain personal tiredness of what was going on in the scene. I was sick and tired of all the 'Put your hands up, put your fucking hands up!' whatever. Without getting too sentimental, I felt like I wanted to bring back that old sentiment and emotion from the turn of the century type-of-thing. I thought it was the right moment.\" \n\n2015 also saw Gouryella take a leap from the studio to the stage with Ferry deciding to bring classics songs such as the self-titled \"Gouryella\", \"Ligaya\" and many more to life in a full Gouryella live show concept. Launching it in Sydney and Melbourne with two Australian arena shows, Ferry then hit the road taking the world tour to the mainstage of the Dreamstate arena at Insomniac's \"Beyond Wonderland\" and later \"Electric Daisy Carnival: New York\". From here the Rotterdam native will continue his charge of international festivals as he takes Gouryella to events such as \"Ultra Europe\", \"Balaton Sound\", \"Tomorrowland\" and many more.\n\nOn Monday 13 June 2016, Flashover Recordings released the sixth Gouryella single titled \"Neba\". The track reached #1 on Beatport Trance and #24 on Beatport Main and has been featured in numerous compilations, including David Pearce's \"Delirium Summer Trance\" and Armin van Buuren's \"A State of Trance Year Mix 2016\". Following the second run of Gouryella live performances across the globe, Ferry Corsten unveiled \"From The Heavens\", featuring new versions of the first four Gouryella tracks as well as \"Anahera\" and \"Neba\".\n\nDuring his set at Dreamstate Europe in Gliwice, Poland he premiered his next single \"Surga\", which is going to be released on May 3, 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1929314", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1929314", "title": "Carnegie International", "text": "Carnegie International\n\nThe Carnegie International is the oldest North American exhibition of contemporary art from around the globe. It was first organized at the behest of industrialist and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie on November 5, 1896 in Pittsburgh. Carnegie established the International to educate and inspire the public as well as to promote international cooperation and understanding. He intended the International to provide a periodic sample of contemporary art from which Pittsburgh's Carnegie Museum of Art could enrich its permanent collection.\n\nThe work of thousands of artists has been exhibited in the Carnegie International, including that of Winslow Homer, Salvador Dali, James Abbott McNeill Whistler, Mary Cassatt, Camille Pissarro, Auguste Rodin, Willem de Kooning, Henry Moore, Jackson Pollock, René Magritte, Joan Miró, Alberto Giacometti, Andy Warhol, Joseph Beuys, Sigmar Polke, and William Kentridge.\n\nEstablished in 1896 as the Annual Exhibition, the Carnegie International was held every fall with few exceptions until the second half of the twentieth century and focused almost solely on painting. By 1955, the show had adopted a triennial schedule and, in 1958, became known as the Pittsburgh International Exhibition of Contemporary Paintings and Sculpture, a title which remained until the 1970 edition. After an interruption due to soaring costs and the construction of the Institute’s new wing, the Sarah Scaife Gallery, the exhibition resumed in 1977 and 1979 as the International Series, single-artist shows intended as a parallel to the Nobel Prize for the arts. In 1982, it reappeared under its original triennial survey format as the Carnegie International, and has been mounted every three to five years since. After the Venice Biennale, the Carnegie International is the oldest international survey exhibition in the world.\n\nThe International was selected by Carnegie Museum of Art director John. W. Beatty, on his own in 1896, and after that, in consultation with a group of foreign advisory committees and a jury of award. The jury of award at this time was composed of artists. The exhibition selection system was two-tiered: some artists were invited to participate directly, shipping their work straight to Pittsburgh and bypassing the selection process, while some were invited to submit works to a selection committee, often at their own expense. Exceptions include 1902, when the exhibition was a historical overview of well-known works by international artists; 1906, when the show was suspended to accommodate the enlargement of the museum; and a five-year hiatus between 1915 and 1919 due to World War I.\n\nThe Institute’s second director, Homer Saint-Gaudens, instituted a new streamlined system whereby foreign representatives scouted promising works for his annual trips to Europe. Juries of award still included artists, but museum directors also served. Saint-Gaudens instituted the display of works by country during these years and introduced the Popular Prize, voted upon by the public, in 1924; he retired after the 1950 show. Exceptions include three domestic shows mounted by assistant director John O’Connor during the WWII years, while the director was in the military, American Painting, 1940; Directions in American Painting, 1941; and Painting in the United States, 1943-1949.\n\nGordon Bailey Washburn maintained his predecessor’s use of foreign advisors, but dropped nationality as the organizing structure. He organized four Internationals, which were distinguished from larger competitors (the Venice Biennale and São Paulo Bienal) in press materials as the only international survey curated by a single person, “one man’s view of contemporary art” in a few hundred works. Concurrent with the 1958 International and in celebration of the Pittsburgh bicentennial, his assistant director, Leon Arkus, organized a retrospective exhibition including 95 paintings from previous editions. That year, Marcel Duchamp and Vincent Price sat on the jury of award.\n\nThe 1964 and 1967 Internationals were organized by the Museum’s fourth director, Gustave von Groschwitz in consultation with seven national correspondents based in Europe, who he referred to as “informal co-jurors.” Von Groschwitz returned to a nationality-based display structure and did away with numbered prizes, opting for six equal awards and several purchase prizes.\n\nThe 1970, 1977, and 1979 Internationals were organized by fifth director, Leon Arkus. Arkus eliminated prizes for the 1970 show, and switched to a single-artist, retrospective format for the 1977 (Pierre Alechinsky) and 1979 (split between Eduardo Chillida and Willem de Kooning) shows, awarding a $50,000 prize each of those years.\n\nJohn R. Lane became director in 1980, but hired curator Gene Baro to organize the 1982 International. This format has remained in place through all of the successive editions, with a twist in 1985, when Lane co-curated the exhibition with John Caldwell. All the curators since 1980, with the exception of Baro, have relied on the advice and/or assistance of advisory committees which also served on award-granting juries. The committees were most directly involved in the 1985 and 1988 shows, when the advisors were considered part of the curatorial team. The International was organized by John Caldwell in 1988; Lynn Cooke and Mark Francis in 1991; Richard Armstrong in 1995; Madeleine Grynsztejn in 1999; Laura Hoptman in 2004; and Douglas Fogle in 2008. Advisory committees in recent years have been composed of other curators, critics, and artists; committee members also participate in the jury of award, alongside the museum director and select trustees.\n\nFranz Ackermann, Matthew Barney, Janet Cardiff, John Currin, Hanne Darboven, Thomas Demand, Mark Dion, Willie Doherty, Olafur Eliasson, Kendell Geers, Felix Gonzalez-Torres, Ann Hamilton, José Antonio Hernández-Diez, Pierre Huyghe, Alex Katz, William Kentridge, Bodys Isek Kingelez, Suchan Kinoshita, Martin Kippenberger, Kerry James Marshall, Takashi Murakami, Shirin Neshat, Ernesto Neto, Chris Ofili, Gabriel Orozco, Markéta Othová, Laura Owens, Edward Ruscha, Gregor Schneider, Ann-Sofi Sidén, Roman Signer, Sarah Sze, Sam Taylor-Wood, Nahum Tevet, Diana Thater, Luc Tuymans, Kara Walker, Jeff Wall, Jane and Louise Wilson, Chen Zhen\n\nTomma Abts, Pawel Althamer, Francis Alÿs, Mamma Andersson, Chiho Aoshima, Kaoru Arima, Kutlug Ataman, John Bock, Lee Bontecou, Robert Breer, Fernando Bryce, Kathy Butterly, Maurizio Cattelan, Paul Chan, Anne Chu, Robert Crumb, Jeremy Deller, Philip-Lorca diCorcia, Peter Doig, Trisha Donnelly, Harun Farocki, Saul Fletcher, Isa Genzken, Mark Grotjahn, Rachel Harrison, Carsten Höller, Katarzyna Kozyra, Jim Lambie, Mangelos, Julie Mehretu, Senga Nengudi, Oliver Payne and Nick Relph, Araya Rasdjarmrearnsook, Neo Rauch, Ugo Rondinone, Eva Rothschild, Yang Fudong\n\nDoug Aitken, Kai Althoff, Mark Bradford, Vija Celmins, Phil Collins, Bruce Conner, Cao Fei, Peter Fischli & David Weiss, Ryan Gander, Daniel Guzmán, Thomas Hirschhorn, Richard Hughes, Mike Kelley, Friedrich Kunath, Maria Lassnig, Sharon Lockhart, Mark Manders, Barry McGee, Mario Merz, Marisa Merz, Matthew Monahan, Rivane Neuenschwander, Manfred Pernice, Susan Philipsz, Noguchi Rika, Wilhelm Sasnal, Thomas Schütte, Ranjani Shettar, David Shrigley, Paul Sietsema, Rudolf Stingel, Katja Strunz, Paul Thek, Wolfgang Tillmans, Rosemarie Trockel, Apichatpong Weerasethakul, Andro Wekua, Richard Wright, Haegue Yang\n\nThe 2013-2014 Carnegie International opened on October 5, 2013 and ran until March 16, 2014.

McLaughlin (February 12, 1861 - January 19, 1927) was an American National Champion jockey in Thoroughbred racing and a Hall of Fame inductee.\n\nOrphaned and homeless in his early teens, McLaughlin was taken in by horse trainer \"Father Bill\" Daly who taught him how to ride. Daly's 1931 \"Brooklyn Daily Eagle\" obituary was headlined as someone who \"Developed Many Great Jockeys.\" While individual statistics from all of McLaughlin's career races aren't documented, McLaughlin began his career riding in Tennessee in the late 1870s. Records show that he first competed in the Kentucky Derby in 1880 for the Dwyer Brothers Stable with trainer James G. Rowe, Sr. The following year the team won the race on the future Hall of Fame horse, Hindoo. McLaughlin finished second in the 1882 Derby and fifth in 1884. \n\nThe horse he claimed was the best he'd ever ridden was Luke Blackburn.\n\nJim McLaughlin won the 1885 Preakness Stakes riding Tecumseh but finished third with the horse in the Belmont Stakes. He rode three consecutive Belmont Stakes winners on two separate occasions, claiming victory six out of seven years. He won the race in 1882, 1883, and 1884 then finished third in 1885 and won then next three in 1886, 1887, and 1888. The last five of his Belmont winners were all for the Dwyer Brothers. McLaughlin's six Belmont wins still stands as the most for any jockey and is shared with Eddie Arcaro who won his sixth in 1955.\n\nMcLaughlin won more races than any jockey in the United States four consecutive times from 1884 through 1887. He rode in his last races in 1892 after which he worked for a time as a trainer and as a racetrack official.\n\nJim McLaughlin died in 1927 a few weeks short of his sixty-sixth birthday.

It is located between the valley of the River Derwent, and the watershed to the River Tyne.\n\nDespite being close to a major city, Hedley is typically Northumbrian and rural in character. Situated close to the villages of Stocksfield and Chopwell as well as to the rural market town of Hexham it is a small, placid village offering stunning views across the Tyne valley.\n\nHedley is not typical of Northumberland in many respects. Firstly, it appears to have escaped rather unscathed in the wars between England and Scotland that occurred before the union. There are no records of any battles in the area. Similarly, there is no record of any activity involving border reivers (tribal leaders and outlaws that fought across the Scottish/English border) in the village. This has enabled it to develop in relative isolation, with mining and quarrying being the prominent industries since the eighteenth century.\n\nThe village holds numerous events including the annual barrel race in which contestants, usually in pairs, run up the hill to the pub with a barrel of beer. It is also popular with gliding enthusiasts, being the closest village to the Northumbria Gliding Club in Leadgate.\n\nHedley on the Hill is also close to Hadrian's Wall a World Heritage Site and located in the far south of \"Hadrian's Wall Country\".\n\nThe village is said to have once been home to a bogle known as The Hedley Kow.\n\nBarrel Race is run every bank holiday Monday, and organised by The Feathers Inn.

{"id": "1929332", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1929332", "title": "Tick-borne encephalitis", "text": "Tick-borne encephalitis\n\nTick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is a viral infectious disease involving the central nervous system. The disease most often manifests as meningitis, encephalitis, or meningoencephalitis. Long-lasting or permanent neuropsychiatric consequences are observed in 10 to 20% of infected patients.\n\nThe number of reported cases has been increasing in most countries. TBE is posing a concerning health challenge to Europe, as the number of reported human cases of TBE in all endemic regions of Europe have increased by almost 400% within the last three decades. \n\nThe tick-borne encephalitis virus is known to infect a range of hosts including ruminants, birds, rodents, carnivores, horses, and humans. The disease can also be spread from animals to humans, with ruminants and dogs providing the principal source of infection for humans.\n\nThe disease typically follows a biphasic pattern in 72–87% of patients and the median incubation period is 8 days (range, 4–28 days) after tick bite. Non-speciﬁc symptoms of mild fever, malaise, headache, nausea, vomiting and myalgias may be present as ﬁrst manifestation of the disease and spontaneously resolve within 1 week. After another week the patient may develop neurological symptoms.\nThe virus can result in long neurological symptoms, infecting the brain (encephalitis), the meninges (meningitis) or both (meningoencephalitis).\nIn general, mortality is 1% to 2%, with deaths occurring 5 to 7 days after the onset of neurologic signs.\n\nIn dogs, the disease also manifests as a neurological disorder with signs varying from tremors to seizures and death.\n\nIn ruminants, neurological disease is also present, and animals may refuse to eat, appear lethargic, and also develop respiratory signs.\n\nTBE is caused by tick-borne encephalitis virus, a member of the genus \"Flavivirus\" in the family Flaviviridae. It was first isolated in 1937. Three virus sub-types also exist: European or Western tick-borne encephalitis virus (transmitted by \"Ixodes ricinus\"), Siberian tick-borne encephalitis virus (transmitted by \"I. persulcatus\"), and Far-Eastern tick-borne encephalitis virus, formerly known as Russian spring summer encephalitis virus (transmitted by \"I. persulcatus\").\n\nRussia and Europe report about 5,000–7,000 human cases annually.\n\nThe former Soviet Union conducted research on tick-borne diseases, including the TBE viruses.\n\nIt is transmitted by the bite of several species of infected woodland ticks, including \"Ixodes scapularis\", \"I. ricinus\" and \"I. persulcatus\", or (rarely) through the non-pasteurized milk of infected cows.\n\nInfection acquired through goat milk consumed as raw milk or raw cheese (Frischkäse) has been documented in 2016 and 2017 in the German state of Baden-Württemberg. None of the infected had neurological disease.\n\nDetection of specific IgM and IgG antibodies in patients sera combined with typical clinical signs, is the principal method for diagnosis. In more complicated situations, e.g. after vaccination, testing for presence of antibodies in cerebrospinal fluid may be necessary . \n\nPCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) method is rarely used, since TBE virus RNA is most often not present in patient sera or cerebrospinal fluid at the time of clinical symptoms.\nPrevention includes non-specific (tick-bite prevention, tick checks) and specific prophylaxis in the form of a vaccination. Tick-borne encephalitis vaccines are very effective and available in many disease endemic areas and in travel clinics. Trade names are \"Encepur N\" and \"FSME-Immun CC\".\n\nThe disease is incurable once manifested, so there is no specific drug therapy for TBE. Symptomatic brain damage requires hospitalization and supportive care based on syndrome severity. Anti-inflammatory drugs, such as corticosteroids, may be considered under specific circumstances for symptomatic relief. Tracheal intubation and respiratory support may be necessary.\n\nAs of 2011, the disease was most common in Central and Eastern Europe, and Northern Asia. About ten to twelve thousand cases are documented a year but the rates vary widely from one region to another. Most of the variation has been the result of variation in host population, particularly that of deer. In Austria, an extensive free vaccination program since the 1960s reduced the incidence in 2013 by roughly 85%. \n\nIn Germany, during the 2010s, there have been a minimum of 95 (2012) and a maximum of 584 cases (2018) of TBE (or FSME as it is known in German). More than half of the reported cases from 2019 had meningitis, encephalitis or myelitis. The risk of infection was noted to be increasing with age, especially in people older than 40 years and it was greater in men than women. Most cases were acquired in Bavaria (46 %) and Baden-Württemberg (37%), much less in Saxonia, Hesse, Niedersachsen and other states. Altogether 164 Landkreise are designated FSME-risk areas, including all of Baden-Württemberg except for the city of Heilbronn.\n\nIn Sweden, most cases of TBE occur in a band running from Stockholm to the west, especially around lakes and the nearby region of the Baltic sea. It reflects the greater population involved in outdoor activities in these areas. Overall, for Europe, the estimated risk is roughly 1 case per 10,000 human-months of woodland activity. Although in some regions of Russia and Slovenia, the prevalence of cases can be as high as 70 cases per 100,000 people per year. Travelers to endemic regions do not often become cases, with only 5 cases reported among U.S. travelers returning from Eurasia between 2000 and 2011, a rate so low that as of 2016 the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended vaccination only for those who will be extensively exposed in high risk areas.\n\n"}

Pope Benedict XV declared it independent on 1 May 1917 with the \"motu proprio Dei Providentis\" and named it \"Congregatio pro Ecclesia Orientali\". Pope Paul VI gave it its current name by adopting the plural \"Congregatio pro Ecclesiis Orientalibus\" with the apostolic constitution \"Regimini Ecclesiae Universae\" of 15 August 1967, reflecting the major decree \"Orientalium Ecclesiarum\" of the Second Vatican Council.\n\nIn May 1917, Pope Benedict XV established a congregation for the Eastern Catholic Churches. It was presided over by the pope and included several Cardinals, one of whom filled the role of Secretary.\n\nThere were also Councillors, chosen from among the more distinguished clergy and those experienced in things oriental.\n\nThe current Cardinal Prefect of the Congregation is Leonardo Sandri.

According to anthropologist Carleton Coon, the countries of the northern part of Western Asia, namely Anatolia, the Caucasus, Iran, and the Levant, were considered the center of distribution of the Armenoid race.\n\nThe term was used by Austrian anthropologist Felix von Luschan and Eugen Petersen in the 1889 book \"Reisen in Lykien, Milyas und Kibyratis\" (\"Travel in Lycia, Milyas and Kibyratis\").\n\nProminent Nazi and racial theorist Hans F. K. Günther used the term 'Near Eastern race' to describe the Armenoid type, and ascribed Near Eastern characteristics to several contemporary peoples, including: Armenians, Jews, Greeks, Georgians, Iranians, Assyrians, Syrians, and Turks. Günther regarded Jews as people of multiple racial origins but defined the Near Eastern race as their major basis, and described the race's characteristics such as its \"commercial spirit\" and as being \"artful traders\" who had strong psychological manipulation capacities that helped their trade, as well as being known to exploit people. Günther's conception has been criticized for pseudoscientific analysis. Nazis historically identified Jews as within the Armenoid type in the name of the Near Eastern race.\n\nThe Nazis never fully clarified their racial doctrine, and Günther' s work was never canonised or entirely accepted even by the SS, which switching freely between race definitions.\n\nRenato Biasutti described the Armenoid race as having: \"Opaque-white to brown skin, brunet hair and dark eyes, abundant pilosity; medium stature (166), sturdy body build; wide head with rounded occiput (87); very long face, straight and narrow nose (57) with high bridge; thin lips, narrow eye opening. \n\nCarleton S. Coon wrote that the Armenoid racial type is very similar to the Dinaric race, most probably due to racial mixture with the Mediterraneans (who often have olive skin) and the Alpines (who often have brown skin). The only difference is that Armenoids have a slightly darker pigmentation. He described the Armenoid as a sub-race of the Caucasoid race. Armenoids were said to be found throughout Eurasia. However, the largest concentrations occurred within Armenia, Transcaucasia, Iran, and Mesopotamia. \n\nConsidered to be the \"true\" Caucasians, Armenoids were relatively tall (170), usually with medium to dark brown or black hair, wavy to curly in form, fair to light-brown skin color, large round eyes that were usually dark brown; a round, brachycephalic head shape with a straight backing (planocciput) (see Cephalic index), high cheekbones and medium-prominent chins. Lips were thin, and noses were often aquiline. Armenians are as a rule thin-lipped, with medium to great chin prominence, a palpable bilateral cleft in the chin, and flaring gonial angles. Large minority of Armenoids have blond hair and blue, green, or hazel eyes. This racial type was believed to be prevalent among some Armenians, Assyrians, and northern Iraqis.\n\nThe Armenoid race type was claimed to exist to the west and north of the Arabid race, and encompasses Armenians, Georgians, Assyrians, Jews, Syrians, Maronites, Druze, Greeks, Turks, Kurds, Iranians, Arab Israelis, Yazidis, among other peoples of the Middle East region. It was found in ancient Sumerians, Babylonians, Hittites, and Cypriots.\n\n\n\n"}

It is Money's highest-selling album.\n\nThe album was a studio rendering of Money's live show at the time, and was recorded during the summer of 1977. Featuring almost entirely original compositions that the band had written and honed during their live performances in Bay Area venues. Containing two songs that achieved generous radio airplay (\"Two Tickets to Paradise\" and \"Baby Hold On\"), the album peaked at #37 on the charts, establishing Money as a successful artist. \"Two Tickets to Paradise\" remains one of his most frequently played songs. A third single, a unique take on the Motown classic \"You Really Got A Hold On Me\" received considerable airplay but failed to crack the top 20.\n\nManaged by Bill Graham and booked by Frank Barcelona's Premier Talent, Money quickly established himself as both the consummate performer and record peddler who often spent afternoons doing record store promotions and radio interviews prior to his on stage appearances.\n\nThis album features Money on vocals, Jimmy Lyon on guitar, saxophone player Tom Scott, and former Steve Miller Band members, bassist Lonnie Turner and drummer Gary Mallaber. Lyon also co-wrote about half of the album's tracks, yet he would leave the band in 1982.\n\n\"Village Voice\" critic Robert Christgau was unenthusiastic about the album and wrote in his \"Consumer Guide\": \"Sorry, girls (and guys)—live inspection reveals that the sleek stud on the cover (and in the ads) is as pudgy and sloppy as his voice. He even has jowls. Watch those cheeseburgers, Eddie boy, or you'll never get to the caviar.\" AllMusic's Mark Allan, on the other hand, found it \"long on craft but not without inspiration\" and observed \"deservedly shot radio-ready tunes\" in \"Two Tickets to Paradise\" and \"Baby Hold On\", while highlighting \"Wanna Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star\" as the album's \"spirited\" highlight that \"spells out the game plan\" of Money and his collaborators. In \"The Rolling Stone Album Guide\" (1992), the singer was appraised by the time of his first album as \"defiantly retrograde\" and a distillation or dilution of \"the Seger-Springsteen approach into a pop formula\", as \"Eddie Money parlayed his straining vocals and average-guy stance into a pair of unremarkable but catchy hit singles. 'Baby, Hold On' and 'Two Tickets to Paradise' (both from the debut) came as a godsend to meat-and-potatoes rockers — and radio programmers — who felt vaguely threatened by the encroaching onslaught of punk and disco.\"\n\n\n"}

It is currently 75%-held by the conglomerate. Jardine Cycle & Carriage Limited seeks to grow with Southeast Asia by investing in market leading businesses based on the themes of urbanisation and the emerging consumer class. The Group works closely with its businesses to enable them to achieve their potential and to elevate their communities. Together with its subsidiaries and associates, it employs more than 250,000 people across Southeast Asia.\n\nThe company was listed on the Singapore Exchange in 1969 as Cycle & Carriage Limited before it renamed to Jardine Cycle & Carriage Limited in 2004 following the integration into the Jardine Matheson Group in 2002. It is one of Singapore's largest publicly listed companies by market capitalization, valued at S$11.9 billion and a component stock on the Straits Times Index. The company’s underlying profit for 2019 was US$0.863B. \n\n2019 marked the 120th Anniversary of Jardine Cycle & Carriage Limited in Southeast Asia, and 50 years of being listed on the Singapore Exchange.\n\nIt was first founded as Federal Stores in 1899 by a trader in nutmeg and sundries on Jalan Bandar (High Street) in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. On 15 June 1899, it was renamed Cycle & Carriage by its founders, the Chua brothers, and thereafter, it expanded to sell bicycles, motorcycles, and eventually motor cars. In 1904, Cycle & Carriage shifted to the corner of High Street, Market Street and Market Square and subsequently expanded to Ipoh, Penang and Singapore. \n\nDuring World War I, Cycle & Carriage suffered economically as a result of the shortage of supply for cars. The war, however, encouraged the development of automobile technology, stimulating interest in the motor car, and spurring demand for Cycle & Carriage's products in 1918. In that year, Cycle & Carriage was registered in the Federated Malay States with SG$250,000 in registered capital. In 1926, Cycle & Carriage shifted its headquarters to Orchard Road in Singapore, with capital of SG$5 million and registered as a public company known as The Cycle & Carriage Company (1926) Limited.\n\nWorld War II caused the company to cease operations, and its workshops, motor cars and trucks were absorbed by the Japanese during the Japanese occupation of Malaya and the Japanese occupation of Singapore. Following that in 1951, Cycle & Carriage was awarded the Mercedes-Benz franchise in Singapore, the first to carry the marque in Southeast Asia.\n\nCycle & Carriage launched plans to build an assembly plant in Hillview, Singapore. On 4 March 1965, the Minister for Finance (Singapore) Goh Keng Swee laid the foundation stone for the SG$2.5 million plant, and predicted that it would create 10,000 new jobs over the following five years. In 1969, the company launched an initial public offering, which was oversubscribed by 73 times, with a total offering of SG$241.65 million - which amounted to just a little short of the budget for the Ministry of Interior and Defense for that year.\n\nBy 1999, Jardine Matheson was a major shareholder in Cycle & Carriage Limited, with a 24.6% stake. In 2002, Cycle & Carriage Limited became a subsidiary of Jardine Matheson when Jardine Strategic increased its stake to over 50%.

{"id": "1929358", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1929358", "title": "Revelle College", "text": "Revelle College\n\nRevelle College is the oldest residential college at the University of California San Diego in La Jolla, California. Founded in 1964, it is named after oceanographer and UC San Diego founder Roger Revelle. UC San Diego—along with Revelle College—was founded at the height of the Space Race between the United States and the Soviet Union. As a result, the initial class of 181 undergraduates comprised only 30 non-science majors. Revelle College focuses on developing \"a well-rounded student who is intellectually skilled and prepared for competition in a complex world.\"\n\nRevelle's general education requirements are rigorously structured in the tradition of a classical liberal arts college. Revelle's stated goal of creating \"Renaissance scholars\" is reflected in these requirements, which ensure that a graduate has experience in humanities, calculus, physical science, biology, social science, a fine art, and a foreign language. Revelle College's core writing course, Humanities (HUM), is a challenging Western Civilization course that incorporates writing, history and other social science requirements into a five-quarter (1 year) sequence through which students examine the greater social and literary developments throughout Western culture.\n\nIn 2014, the college celebrated its fiftieth anniversary. The same year, UCSD Housing and Dining opened a new dining commons named \"64 Degrees\" to replace the old Plaza Cafe and Incredi-Bowls food truck. Most of the Revelle residential campus was renovated from 2009 to 2015.\n\nMuch of Revelle College's initial history mirrors that of UC San Diego itself, as the development of the first undergraduate college was instrumental in founding the university. The Institute of Technology and Engineering was established in 1958 on a ridge northeast of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO). The Institute, soon renamed to the School of Science and Engineering, was initially housed at Scripps and headed by Roger Revelle. Ninety-nine faculty were planned to instruct 450 graduate students in earth sciences, biology, physics, chemistry, engineering, and mathematics. Roger Revelle and several recently recruited professors, including Keith Brueckner, James R. Arnold, and David Bonner, began to aggressively recruit professors from across the country to their new university. In 1961, construction began on the first permanent building at the new campus. Buildings A and B, now Urey Hall and Mayer Hall respectively, housed laboratories, office space, and lecture halls. They were completed and inaugurated in 1963.\n\nLater in 1963, Chancellor Herbert York began to implement the 1959 master plan as visualized by Revelle, Arnold, and University of California President Clark Kerr. The plan called for the creation of twelve loosely related undergraduate colleges, the first of which York formed by renaming the School of Science and Engineering to simply The First College. Simultaneously, York created the Division of Letters and Science to handle the nascent university's academics; this division would house the original departments of physics, chemistry, and biological sciences, as well as the recently formed departments of philosophy and literature. The first undergraduates enrolled in late 1964.\n\nThe First College continued to grow to accommodate increasing undergraduate and graduate enrollment at the university. In early 1965, the Regents of the University of California voted to rename the college in Roger Revelle's honor. Revelle had recently resigned his posts as UCSD Dean of Research and SIO Director to become director of the Center for Population Studies at Harvard University. Revelle College remains the only undergraduate college at UCSD named for a living honoree.\n\nBy the start of the 1965-1966 school year, Revelle College had grown to loosely resemble the modern campus, surrounding a central plaza. The completion of the sixth academic building, Building F (now York Hall), marked the end of its growth and the beginning of the establishment of John Muir College. In addition to a library in Building E (Galbraith Hall), the college was equipped to house 440 undergraduates in the newly constructed Fleet residence halls. An 800-seat cafeteria, the Plaza Cafe, was constructed to replace the canteen in the basement of Building C (Mayer Hall). Blake and Argo Halls were added in 1968.\n\nThe Revelle College grounds encompass the southwest corner of the UC San Diego campus. Revelle is bounded to the west by North Torrey Pines Road, to the north by Muir College's athletic facilities and the Old Student Center, to the east by Gilman Drive and the School of Medicine, and to the south by Scholars Drive South and the Theater District. The college's buildings are laid around a central plaza, with the residential buildings west of the plaza and the academic buildings surrounding the remaining three sides. The southern section of Revelle College is occupied by two large parking lots and grassy hills, and the administration building sits in a grove in the southeast corner.\n\nRevelle Plaza is the centerpiece of Revelle College, and has served as an important space for campus activities and socialization since its creation. During the mid-to-late sixties, Revelle Plaza was the location of many protests. The May 1970 Peace Memorial in its southeast corner commemorates the anti-war self-immolation of Revelle student George Winne, Jr. The adjacent fountain was donated by Pacific Southwest Airlines in 1965.\n\nThe residential section of the Revelle College campus is located to the west of the plaza. Blake and Argo Halls are between the plaza and the courtyard containing the Anchor. North of this courtyard lies the Revelle Commons complex. In addition to four conference rooms, this complex houses Roger's Market and the Revelle dining commons, 64 Degrees. 64 Degrees serves burgers, Chinese-inspired plates, salads, sandwiches, and American cuisine. In 2015, a full-service restaurant called 64 North was opened to complement 64 Degrees and provide the southern part of campus with an upscale dining option.\n\nThere are two major lecture halls in Revelle College, with one located in Galbraith Hall and another in York Hall. The other academic buildings in Revelle are the Natural Sciences Building, Pacific Hall, Mayer Hall, Bonner Hall, and Urey Hall. Collectively, these eight buildings house the Division of Biological Sciences, the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, the Humanities Program, the Department of Physics, and the Department of Theatre and Dance. York, Mayer, and Bonner Halls are noted for the unique hexagonal breezeways that connect the buildings.\n\nRevelle College has two Stuart Collection pieces, \"La Jolla Project\" by Richard Fleischner and \"What Hath God Wrought?\" by Mark Bradford. The former, referred to by the campus community as Stonehenge, gives its nickname to the surrounding Stonehenge Lawn. Other public works of art around Revelle College include El Mac's \"Enduring Spell\" mural in the Argo courtyard, murals on the side of the Ché Café, a giant red chair by Galbraith Hall, the Stuart Collection works \"Red Shoe\", \"La Jolla Vista View\", and \"The Wind Garden\" in the nearby Theatre District, a surrealist mural by Howard Warshaw on the east interior wall of 64 Degrees, and a 56 ft × 22 ft surfer graphic on the east exterior wall of 64 Degrees.\n\nThe Revelle general education curriculum has been one of the most stringent on campus since the college's inception. Provost Daniel Wulbert described the curriculum as having \"something there for almost everyone to dislike.\" Students are expected to complete courses in calculus, science, language, social science, and the fine arts, as well as a five-quarter writing sequence focusing on the literature, history, and philosophy of Western civilization. The curriculum crosses traditional academic disciplinary boundaries in order to encourage the development of \"Renaissance men and women.\"\n\nThe five-quarter Humanities sequence forms the cornerstone of Revelle's academic requirements. The sequence requires students to examine and respond to humanistic philosophy and literature. The first two courses, usually taken by first-year students, focus on intensive writing instruction while covering literature and history from the Hebrew Bible, ancient Greece, ancient Rome, the Bible, and the Middle Ages. The following three courses cover the remainder of Western civilization, from Renaissance literature to modern socialist and nationalist movements. Since 2007, Revelle students have also had the option of taking Humanities 3 in Italy through the Revelle in Rome program.\n\nThe Revelle Residence Life office organizes over 500 events each year for students in the residence halls and apartments. Students also participate in organizations and leadership programs funded by Revelle College Council. Revelle's residence halls for first-year students are all named after famous exploring ships:\n\n\nThe largest residence hall, Argo Hall, is a six-story building that houses 350 students. Each floor has its own study lounge and kitchen, and the base of the building houses conference rooms, two social lounges, a postal center, and piano practice rooms. Argo Hall was most recently renovated in 2015. Blake Hall is a four-story building with 180 residents, as well as two patios and a large study lounge and kitchen on the uppermost floor. The six remaining residence halls comprise the Fleet residences, each of which houses 110 students above a study lounge. Approximately 40% of the students living in Fleet residence halls are from colleges other than Revelle.\n\nRevelle College offers apartment housing for continuing undergraduates in the Charles David Keeling Apartments. The Keeling Apartments, completed in 2009, are the first LEED platinum-certified residential buildings in the University of California system. The complex is composed of three connected towers that collectively house 510 students. The three buildings—North Tower, West Bar, and South Tower—are divided into eight communities named after the Hawaiian islands of Hawai'i, Moloka'i, Kaho'olawe, Maui, Lana'i, O'ahu, Ni'ihau and Kaua'i.\n\nThe most well-known Revelle College tradition, the annual Watermelon Drop, takes place every June prior to finals week. The tradition began in 1965, when a physics professor asked his students to calculate the terminal velocity of a watermelon dropped from the seventh floor of Urey Hall. Prior to the event, Revelle College hosts a pageant to name a Watermelon Queen, who drops the watermelon from the same building each year.\n\nOther traditions at Revelle include painting the Revelle Anchor, a centrally-located anchor that serves as a bulletin board and artistic outlet. UCSD students can spray-paint the anchor every night. Revelle College students also celebrate Roger Revelle's birthday at the end of winter quarter with a barbecue lunch. In the spring, Revelle College Council organizes the Revellution concert, which features local stars and rising independent artists.\n\n"}

{"id": "1929375", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1929375", "title": "Lacombe, Alberta", "text": "Lacombe, Alberta\n\nLacombe () is a city in central Alberta, Canada. It is located approximately north of Red Deer, the nearest major city, and south of Edmonton, the nearest metropolitan area. The city is set in the rolling parkland of central Alberta, between the Rocky Mountains foothills to the west and the flatter Alberta prairie to the east.\n\nLacombe became Alberta's 17th city on September 5, 2010.\n\nLacombe is named after Albert Lacombe (28 February 1827 — 12 December 1916), a French-Canadian Roman Catholic Oblate missionary what lived among and evangelized the Cree and Blackfoot First Nations of western Canada. He is now remembered for having brokered a peace between the Cree and Blackfoot, negotiating construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway through Blackfoot territory, and securing a promise from the Blackfoot leader Crowfoot to refrain from joining the North-West Rebellion of 1885. The Lacombe Police Service have policed the community since 1900.\n\nIn 1880 the first land surveys of the Lacombe area took place and three years later, in 1883, the first permanent settler arrived, Ed Barnett. Barnett was a retired member of the North-West Mounted Police (NWMP) who had served a mere three years. He left Fort Macleod in August 1881 at 23 years of age. According to his own diary and his official obituary in the RCMP Quarterly, spring 1940, on July 19, 1881, Barnett was among a small NWMP party that escorted Chief Sitting Bull and his people to the Canada–US border. Along the Calgary-Edmonton Trail, he established a \"stopping house\" for travelers on a land grant given to him for serving his service in the NWMP. His family and friends from Ontario moved out and the community began to grow. The stopping house then became known as Barnett's Siding. \nThe Canadian Pacific Railway arrived in 1891. This provided better access to the area and new opportunities for settlement. By 1893 the downtown blocks and lots were surveyed. Village status was granted in 1896 and town status in 1902.\n\nIn 1907, the federal government set up an experimental farm to research grain and livestock production. The President of the C.P.R. William Van Horne renamed Barnett's Siding as Lacombe in honour of Father Lacombe.\n\nLacombe experiences a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification \"Dfb\").\nThe population of the City of Lacombe according to its 2019 municipal census is 13,985, a change of from its 2014 municipal census population of 12,728.\n\nIn the 2016 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the City of Lacombe recorded a population of 13,057 living in 4,797 of its 5,034 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2011 population of 11,707. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2016.\n\nIn the 2011 Census, the City of Lacombe had a population of 11,707 living in 4,413 of its 4,686 total dwellings, a change of 8.9% from its 2006 adjusted population of 10,752. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2011.\n\nNestled in one of Central Alberta's most fertile valleys between Calgary and Edmonton, the local economy includes a strong agricultural base supplemented by oil and gas industry.\n\nThe city is also home to the Lacombe Research Centre where the first livestock breed developed in Canada, the Lacombe hog, was produced.\n\nFor more than a century, the federal government has funded agricultural research through a network of research centres strategically placed in almost every province. This research program has played a major role in developing the more than $120-billion Canadian agrifood industry.\n\nThe Lacombe Research Centre (LRC) is one of a network of 19 national agricultural research centres operated by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. The Centre conducts research in field crops and livestock production relevant to the central Alberta region. The Centre's main research focuses on the factors that influence red meat: yield, quality, safety and preservation. The Centre also develops integrated, sustainable crop and animal production systems and crop varieties for the short-season environments of the parkland and northwestern Canada.\n\nThe LRC developed a variety of hog called Lacombe. Work began in 1947. It took 12 years to develop the 'Lacombe' variety which is noted for its characteristics suitable to the harsh prairie environment. 'Lacombe' is 55% Danish Landrace, 22% Chester White, and 23% Berkshire. The 'Lacombe' hog was the first livestock breed to be developed in Canada.\n\nBeaverlodge and Fort Vermilion Part of the Lacombe Research Centre\n\nThe Beaverlodge Research Farm and its sub-station Fort Vermilion are part of the Lacombe Research Centre and form the most northern agricultural research establishment in Canada. The Beaverlodge Research Farm specializes in research and development of technology for improved production systems for crops, honey bees and other pollinating insects adapted to environmental conditions in northwestern Canada. Research at the Fort Vermilion site focuses primarily on the adaptation of technologies for this northern agricultural area.\n\nThe Lacombe Generals of Allan Cup Hockey West played out of the Gary Moe Auto Group Sportsplex from 2016–19.\n\nThe city's Seventh-day Adventist university, Burman University (formerly Canadian University College), was established near Lacombe in 1909 and continues to operate today. It and the nearby Hamlet of College Heights were annexed by Lacombe in 2000.\n\nLacombe is home to many public schools within the Wolf Creek Public School Division, including École Secondaire Lacombe Composite High School – a Grade 10-12 school with approximately 800 students that recently underwent extensive renovations completed in 2009. Other public schools include École J.S. McCormick School (K-3), École Lacombe Upper Elementary School (4-6), Terrace Ridge School (K-7), École Lacombe Junior High School (7-9), and Lacombe Outreach School.\n\nThe city's private schools include Lacombe Christian School (Preschool-Grade 9) and it has two campuses one for pre-2 and the other side from 3-9, Central Alberta Christian High School (10-12), College Heights Christian School (K-9) and Parkview Adventist Academy (10-12), as well as Father Lacombe Catholic School (K-9).\n\nSeveral times, the main street of this community has been used in films, since it was remodelled to resemble a town in the early 1900s.

It was mandated to return a single member to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta by the first past the post method until 1917, and by instant-runoff voting from 1926 until it was abolished in 1940.\n\nAlberta inherited Victoria from the North-West Territories when it became a province in 1905. The old electoral district had covered the part of the District of Alberta directly north and east of Edmonton. The new province moved Victoria's boundary further east to the Fourth Meridian, to reflect the change in Alberta's shape, while the northwest part of Victoria became the new district of Sturgeon.\n\nIn 1909, the area north of the North Saskatchewan River was split off to create the Pakan district, named for the town at Fort Victoria. This greatly reduced Victoria's size and moved its namesake outside of its boundaries. It covered approximately the same area as the present-day Lamont County, along with Fort Saskatchewan.\n\nVictoria disappeared in 1940 when it was merged with Whitford to create Willingdon.\n\nVictoria's first MLA was Francis A. Walker, defeating incumbent N.W.T. MLA Jack Shera. He served as a backbencher with the Liberal government for all four terms it was in power. In 1917, he was returned to the Legislature by acclamation because the province declared all active servicemen in World War I re-elected.\n\nHowever, in 1921 William Fedun, a Ukrainian immigrant, narrowly defeated Walker to capture Victoria for the upstart United Farmers of Alberta, which formed government after the election. He chose to retire after one term.\n\nUFA candidate Rudolph Hennig again narrowly won Victoria in 1926 on the second count, despite another strong challenge from Walker. He served one term but did not win the UFA nomination in the next election.\n\n1930 saw the closest election yet in Victoria, with UFA candidate Peter Miskew defeating his Liberal opponent by less than 100 votes. However, Miskew would almost immediately cross the floor to the Liberal opposition.\n\nWhen the United Farmers were swept out of power in 1935, Social Credit candidate Samuel Calvert, another WWI veteran, easily captured Victoria for his party. After his first term, Victoria was abolished in time for the 1940 election, and Calvert chose to retire from politics.\n\nThe returning officer for the 1905 election in Victoria was Albert Ernest Archer.\n\nIn 1909, no candidates stood against Francis Walker, and he was declared acclaimed.\n\n\"1913 swing is calculated from the 1905 election.\"\n\nIn 1917, because Walker was an active serviceman in World War I, he was automatically re-elected by acclamation for a second time.\n\n\"1921 swing is calculated from the 1913 election.\"\n\nFor the 1926 election, the UFA government introduced alternative vote in rural constituencies.

{"id": "1929401", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1929401", "title": "Tick-borne encephalitis virus", "text": "Tick-borne encephalitis virus\n\nTick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is a virus associated with tick-borne encephalitis.\n\nTBEV is a member of the genus \"Flavivirus\". Other close relatives, members of the TBEV serocomplex, include \"Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus\", \"Kyasanur Forest disease virus\", Alkhurma virus, \"Louping ill virus\" and \"Langat virus\".\n\nTBEV has three subtypes:\n\nThe reference strain is the Sofjin strain.\n\nTBEV is a positive-sense single stranded RNA virus, contained in a 40-60 nm spherical, enveloped capsid. The TBEV genome is approximately 11kb in size, which contains a 5' cap, a single open reading frame with 3' and 5' UTRs, and is without polyadenylation. Like other flaviviruses, the TBEV genome codes for ten viral proteins, three structural, and seven nonstructural (NS). The structural proteins are C (capsid), PrM (premembrane, which is cleaved to produce the final membrane protein, M), and E (envelope). The seven nonstructural proteins are: NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5. The role of some nonstructural proteins is known, NS5 serves as RNA-dependent polymerase, NS3 has protease (in complex withwith NS2B) and helicase activity. Structural and nonstructral proteins are not required for the genome to be infectious. All viral proteins are expressed as a single large polyprotein, with the order C, PrM, E, NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5.\n\nInfection of the vector begins when a tick takes a blood meal from an infected host. This can occur at any part of the tick's life cycle but a \"horizontal\" transmission between infected nymphs and uninfected larvae co-feeding on the same host is thought to be key in maintaining the circulation of TBEV. TBEV in the blood of the host infects the tick through the midgut, from where it can pass to the salivary glands to be passed to the next host. In non-adult ticks, TBEV is transmitted transtadially by infecting cells that are not destroyed during molting, thus the tick remains infectious throughout its life. Infected adult ticks may be able to lay eggs that are infected, transmitting the virus transorvarially.\n\nIn humans, the infection begins in the skin (with the exception of foodborne cases, about 1% of infections) at the site of the bite of an infected tick, where Langerhans cells and macrophages in the skin are preferentially targeted. TBEV envelope (E) proteins recognize heparan sulfate (and likely other receptors) on the host cell surface and are endocytosed via the clathrin mediated pathway. Acidification of the late endosome triggers a conformational change in the E proteins, resulting in fusion, followed by uncoating, and release of the single-stranded RNA genome into the cytoplasm. The viral polyprotein is translated and inserts into the ER membrane, where it is processed on the cytosolic side by host peptidases and in the lumen by viral enzyme action. The viral proteins C, NS3, and NS5 are cleaved into the cytosol (though NS3 can complex with NS2B or NS4A to perform proteolytic or helicase activity), while the remaining nonstructural proteins alter the structure of the ER membrane. This altered membrane permits the assembly of replication complexes, where the viral genome is replicated by the viral RNA-dependent polymerase, NS5. Newly replicated viral RNA genomes are then packaged by the C proteins while on the cytosolic side of the of the ER memebrane, forming the immature nucleocapsid, and gain E and PrM proteins, arranged as a heterodimer, during budding into the lumen of the ER. The immature virion is spiky and geometric in comparison to the mature particle. The particle passes through the golgi apparatus and \"trans\"-golgi network, under increasingly acidic conditions, by which the virion matures with cleavage of the Pr segment from the M protein and formation fusion competent E protein homodimers. Though the cleaved Pr segment remains associated with protein complex until exit. The virus is released from the host cell upon fusion of the transport vesicle with the host cell membrane, the cleaved Pr now segments dissociate, resulting in a fully mature, infectious virus. However, partially mature and immature viruses are sometimes released as well; immature viruses are noninfectious as the E proteins are not fusion competent, partially mature viruses are still capable of infection.\n\nWith the exception of food-borne cases, infection begins in the skin at the site of the tick bite. Skin dendritic (or Langerhans) cells (DCs) are preferentially targeted. Initially, the virus replicates locally and immune response is triggered when viral components are recognized by cytosolic pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Recognition causes the release of cytokines including interferons (IFN) α, β , and γ and chemokines, attracting migratory immune cells to the site of the bite. The infection may be halted at this stage and cleared, before the onset of noticeable symptoms. Notably, tick saliva enhances infection by modulating host immune response, dampening apoptotic signals. If the infection continues, migratory DCs and macrophages become infected and travel to the local draining lymph node where activation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, monocytes and the complement system are activated.\n\nThe draining lymph node can also serve as a viral amplification site, from where TBEV gains systemic access. This viremic stage corresponds to the first symptomatic phase in the prototypical biphasic pattern of tick-borne encephalitis. TBEV has a strong preference for neuronal tissue, and is neuroinvasive. The initial viremic stage allows access to a number of the preferential tissues. However, the exact mechanism by which TBEV crosses into the central nervous system (CNS) is unclear. There are several proposed mechanism for TBEV breaching the blood-brain barrier (BBB): 1)The \"Trojan Horse\" mechanism, whereby TBEV gains access to the CNS while infecting an immune cell that passes through the BBB; 2) Disruption and increased permeability of the BBB by immune immune cytokines; 3) Via infection of the olfactory neurons; 4) Via retrograde transport along peripheral nerves to the CNS; 5) Infection of the cells that make up part of the BBB.\n\nCNS infection brings on the second phase in the classic biphasic infection pattern associated with the European subtype. CNS disease is immunopathological; release of inflammatory cytokines coupled with the action of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and possibly NK cells results in inflammation and apoptosis of infected cells that is responsible for many of the CNS symptoms.\n\nTBEV specific IgM and IgG antibodies are produced in response to infection. IgM antibodies appear and peak first, as well as reaching higher levels, and typically dissipates in about 1.5 months post infection, though there exists considerable variation from patient to patient. IgG levels peak at about 6 weeks after the appearance of CNS symptoms, then decline slightly but do not dissipate, likely conferring life long immunity to the patient.\n\nThe ancestor of the extant strains appears to have separated into several clades approximately 2750 years ago. The Siberian and Far Eastern subtypes diverged about 2250 years ago.\n\nA second analysis suggests an earlier date of evolution (3300 years ago) with a rapid increase in the number of strains starting ~300 years ago.\n\nThis virus has been transmitted at least three times into Japan between 260–430 years ago.\n\nThe strains circulating in Latvia appear to have originated from both Russia and Western Europe while those in Estonia appear to have originated in Russia. The Lithuanian strains appear to be related to those from Western Europe.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis indicates that the European and Siberian TBEV sub-types are closely related while the Far-eastern sub-type is closer to the Louping Ill Virus. However, in antigenic relatedness, based on the E, NS3, and NS5 proteins, all three sub-types are highly similar, and Louping Ill virus is the closest relative outside the collective TBEV group.\n\nThough the first description of what may have been TBE appears in records in the 1700's in Scandinavia, identification of the TBEV virus occurred in the Soviet Union in the 1930's. The investigation began due to an outbreak of what was believed to be Japanese Encephalitis (\"Summer encephalitis\"), among Soviet troops stationed along the border with the Japanese empire (present day People's Republic of China), near the Far Eastern city of Khabarovsk. The expedition was lead by virologist Lev A. Zilber, who assembled a team of twenty young scientists in a number of related fields such as acarology, microbiology, neurology, and epidemiology. The expedition arrived in Khabarovsk on May 15, 1937, and divided into squads, Northern- led by Elizabeth N. Levkovich and working in the Khabarovski Krai- and Southern- led by Alexandra D. Sheboldaeva, working in the Primorski Krai. \n\nInside the month of May, the expedition had identified ticks as the likely vector, collected I. persucatus ticks by exposure of bare skin by entomologist Alexander V. Gutsevich, and virologist Mikhail P. Chumakov had isolated the virus from ticks feeding on intentionally infected mice. During the summer, five expeditions members became infected with TBEV and while there were no fatalites, three of the five suffered damaging sequelae. \n\nThe expedition returned in mid August and in October of 1937 Zilber and Sheboldova were arrested, falsely accused of spreading Japanese encephalitis. Expedition epidemiologist Tamara M. Safonov, was arrested the following January for protesting the charges against Zilber and Sheboldova. As a consequence of the arrests, the one of the important initial works was published under the authorship of expedition acarologist, Vasily S. Mironov. Zilber was released in 1939 and managed to restore, along with Sheboldova, co-authorship on this initial work; however, Safanov and Sheboldova (who was not released) spent 18 years in labor camps.\n\n"}

As a result of the elaborate front drivetrain, the Type 53 used the only independent front suspension system ever approved for use by Ettore Bugatti.\n\nThe Type 53 was notoriously difficult to steer.

In June 1932, Jean Bugatti rolled a Type 53 at the Shelsley Walsh Speed Hill Climb. The hard steering was attributed to not having constant-velocity joints for the front halfshafts and to unequal-length halfshafts without matching torsional characteristics.

He is particularly noted for commissioning the design and construction of Holkham Hall in north Norfolk. Between 1722 and 1728, he was one of the two Members of Parliament for Norfolk. He was honoured by being created first Earl of Leicester, in a recreation of an ancient earldom.\n\nHe was the son of Edward Coke (Coke is pronounced \"Cook\") and Carey Newton. His great-great-great-grandfather was the noted judge and politician Sir Edward Coke. He married Lady Margaret Tufton, 19th Baroness de Clifford, 3rd daughter of Thomas Tufton, 6th Earl of Thanet by his wife Lady Catherine Cavendish. The title of \"19th Baroness de Clifford\" was eventually granted in favor to her after falling into abeyance between her co-heir sisters. As a young man, Coke embarked on a six-year 'Grand Tour', returning to England in the spring of 1718. During his time in Rome in 1715, he made the acquaintance of Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington, the aristocratic architect at the forefront of the Palladian revival movement in England, and of William Kent. Both were later to be engaged by Coke to work on his mansion at Holkham Hall constructed in Palladian style which housed the considerable collection of works of art that Coke had accumulated on his travels. During these travels in 1717, he purchased the Codex Leicester, containing some of the works of Leonardo da Vinci, the Italian artist and scientist.\n\nCoke was later raised to the peerage as Baron Lovel and became known as Lord Lovel on 28 May 1728. However, Coke was badly affected by financial losses when his investments in the South Sea Company proved worthless. This delayed the building of Coke's planned new country estate for over ten years. On top of that, he seemed to have lived a reckless life of drinking, gambling, and hunting, as well as being a leading supporter of cock fighting. It was not until around 1732 that Burlington and Kent made their first drawings for the new country house. Norfolk architect Matthew Brettingham was also influential in the design of the mansion (though he attributed the design of the Marble Hall to Coke himself). Work on the foundations began in 1734, but it was to be 30 years before work was completed. As he surveyed the result of his long years of labour and achievement, Lord Leicester lamented: \"It is a melancholy thing to stand alone in one's own country. I look around not a house to be seen but my own. I am Giant of Giant Castle and have ate up all my neighbours my nearest neighbour is the King of Denmark.\"\n\nCoke, who had been made Earl of Leicester on 9 May 1744, died on 20 April 1759, five years before the completion of Holkham Hall, having never fully recovered his financial losses. Thereafter, his wife Lady Margaret oversaw to the completion and furnishing of the house. He had been predeceased by his only son, the rake Edward Coke, Viscount Coke (1719–1753), whose marriage to the diarist Mary Campbell proved disastrous - he virtually imprisoned her at Holkham Hall - and childless. Therefore, Holkham Hall was inherited by Thomas Coke's nephew Wenman Roberts, the son of Major Philip Roberts and Thomas's sister Anne Coke.\n\nWenman took the name of Coke after inheriting the Coke estates and was succeeded on his death in 1776 by his son, another Thomas Coke, later 1st Earl of Leicester of Holkham, the MP and agricultural reformer.\n\n"}

Established in 1924, the NCAA is the oldest athletic association in the Philippines. The Philippine NCAA is not affiliated with the NCAA of the United States.\n\nThe Policy Board and the Management Committee handles the affairs of the league. The Board and the Committee are composed of representatives of the ten member schools, and determine the acceptance and suspension of member schools, game reversals and replays, and other official actions.\nDuring the nearly yearlong season from June to March, each school participates in 11 sports; each sport is conducted in two divisions: the Juniors for male high-school students, and the Seniors for college students. There are male and female Seniors divisions for some events. The Juniors and Seniors divisions each award a General Championship trophy at the end of the academic year to the school which had the best performance in all sports, based on the total number of points scored in a Championship tally.\n\nThe current president of the Policy Board is Paulino Cayco from the Arellano University, while the Management Committee is headed by Peter Cayco of Arellano University.\n\nRivalries developed in the hotly contested basketball event. These rivalries resulted in brawls among fans of member schools. Some brawls were full-blown that several schools decided to withdraw from the league. The NCAA authorities took measures to prevent brawls, such as the segregation of supporters of opposing schools in the playing venues. With the withdrawal of member schools came the admission of new members into the league. In season 2006–07, the league contemplated an expansion by establishing a Division II. After season 2008–09, PCU took an indefinite leave of absence after it was discovered that several high school players used spurious documents to enroll in the school. As a result, the league had only seven members in season 2009–10. Two schools (Arellano Chiefs and EAC Generals), were welcomed as probationary members in season 2010–11. In season 2011–12, the league welcomed the Lyceum Pirates as a guest team. In the 2013–14 season, Arellano was promoted to regular membership after four years in probation, while EAC and Lyceum remained in probationary membership. And in the 91st season of the league, the two probationary schools (EAC and LPU) was upgraded into regular members.\n\nThe number and composition of NCAA members has changed over the years. The association is currently composed of the following colleges and universities, with their corresponding team names, affiliation, and year of admission.\n\n The Policy Board, composed of the presidents of member schools, manages the NCAA's external and internal affairs. It handles matters such as acceptance, replacement, and suspension of member schools. The NCAA presidency rotates among member schools.\n\nThe other main administrative body in the NCAA is the Management Committee (MANCOM), which determines matters of athletic concern, such as determining the proper conditions for playing, suspension of players, coaches, and referees, reversal or review of game results, and investigation of ineligible players. The Management Committee is composed of the athletics moderators (or athletic directors) of the member schools, who are selected by their respective university presidents, and the league chairperson, who is selected by the Policy Board. Like the league president, the chair of the Management Committee rotates among member schools.\n\nThe president of the Policy Board and the chairperson of the Management committee come from the school currently hosting the basketball tournament. The rotation is determined by the order of when each school joined the league. For the 2019–2020 season, the host will be Arellano University.\n\nThe host school manages the logistics, expenses, labor and security in the venues. Each sport has its own host, with the host for basketball being the head of all hosts.\n\nThe NCAA sponsors thirteen (juniors) and fourteen (seniors) sports, which are divided into two divisions: the Juniors division for high school students and the Seniors division for college students. There are male and female Seniors divisions for some events.\n\nEach member college or university has an affiliated high school that competes in the Juniors division. For example, San Beda University's affiliated high school is its campus at Taytay, Rizal, while Colegio de San Juan de Letran's high school is found within its college campus at Intramuros. While these two high schools are integrated within their colleges, De La Salle-College of Saint Benilde is not directly connected with its high school affiliate, La Salle Green Hills (LSGH), except that they are both administered by the Lasallian Brothers. As a result, DLSU-CSB labels \"St. Benilde\" instead of \"La Salle\" on their jerseys.\n\nThe NCAA sponsors the following sports for Juniors and Seniors: basketball, soccer, poomsae, swimming, taekwondo, track and field, chess, tennis (lawn and soft), table tennis, badminton, volleyball, and beach volleyball. The last three sporting events have a women's division.\n\nIn the 87th season of the NCAA, cheerleading has been upgraded to a \"regular sport\" which means it will contribute points in the overall championship race. In the 91st season of the league, poomsae was added as a \"demonstration sport\" being part of the taekwondo event.\n\nThe General Champion for the each division in an academic year is determined by a points system similar to the one used in Formula One, where the school with the highest accumulated score from all events in a division wins the General Championship. A championship in an event entitles a school with 40 points, the second placer 30, up to eighth place, with five points. For an example, see the tabulation of points for Season 84.\n\nCurrently, the De La Salle-College of Saint Benilde, Arellano University and San Beda University compete in all Seniors' sports, while La Salle Green Hills, San Beda College-Rizal and University of Perpetual Help System DALTA participates in all Juniors' sports.\n\nThe NCAA was founded in 1924 on the initiative of Dr. Regino R. Ylanan, a physical education professor of the University of the Philippines (UP). The original members were the Ateneo de Manila, De La Salle College, Institute of Accounts (now as Far Eastern University), National University (NU), San Beda College (SBC), the University of Manila, the University of the Philippines, and the University of Santo Tomas (UST).\nThe decision of the Board of Directors to file papers of incorporation with the then Bureau of Commerce in 1930 led to protests from the University of the Philippines, which was the only public institution among member schools, saying that it would lead to commercialization. National University and the University of Santo Tomas sided with the University of the Philippines on the matter. This led into the formation, via an Article of Agreement, of a triangular meet among NU, UP and UST, with the Board of Control's condition that NCAA events should take precedence. The league established came to be known as the \"Big Three,\" and in 1932, the Article of Agreement was renewed.\n\nIn 1936, the University of the Philippines and University of Santo Tomas withdrew permanently from the NCAA and continued with their own league, while Far Eastern University (FEU) withdrew on its own. Six schools remained in the league and became known as the \"old-timer six\" – Ateneo de Manila, Colegio de San Juan de Letran, De La Salle College, José Rizal College, Mapúa Institute of Technology and San Beda College. Also in 1936, league's basketball games were transferred to the newly completed Rizal Memorial Coliseum, owing to its accessibility among the schools, since most schools were in Manila.\n\nIn 1938, Far Eastern University, National University, the University of the Philippines and the University of Santo Tomas formed the University Athletic Association of the Philippines, a rival intercollegiate league.\n\nThe NCAA experienced a golden age during the postwar years. The Loyola Center at the Ateneo campus became the new home of the league. Due to the home court advantage of the Ateneo, Blue Eagles' games were held on the old Rizal Memorial.\n\nThe 1950s will be known in the annals of history as one of the best decades of the NCAA. The start of the decade was the glory year of the fabled Letran Murder Inc. Eventually, it will be the Ateneo de Manila Blue Eagles and San Beda Red Lions who would be locking horns during the fabled era.\n\nThe decade produced legendary collegiate players like Carlos Loyzaga (San Beda), Lauro \"the Fox\" Mumar (Letran), and Frankie Rabat (Ateneo) among others.\n\nThe 1950s was also known as the decade of the Crispulo Zamora Cup. The Crispulo Zamora Cup was the trophy to be awarded by the NCAA for the first team to get three championship crowns.\n\nThe Letran Knights started with their 1950 campaign bannering their legendary Murder Inc. However, they lost steam when San Beda and Ateneo traded championships thereafter. San Beda won the crown in 1951 and the 1952 season. Ateneo stopped San Beda in 1953 and secured the 1954 championship. The 1955 season was the deciding year for the Crispulo Zamora Cup which San Beda eventually won.\n\nIn the post Zamora Cup era, La Salle made their own statement by winning the crown in 1956. Still, Ateneo was undaunted and secured the 1957 and 1958 trophy. A third straight post-Zamora crown was only foiled by San Beda in 1959 ending the legendary decade of the 1950s.\n\nNCAA basketball champions formed the core of the Filipino team sent to international competitions during 1960 and 1961 in Japan. The opening of the Araneta Coliseum, the largest indoor arena in the Philippines, prompted the league to transfer the championship round there.\n\nBy the 1960s, the league experienced problems such as eligibility of players and interscholastic hooliganism. This led to disagreements among member schools, and as a result the 1962–63 season was suspended, and the following two seasons were held in a loose conference format, where the home and away system was used. San Sebastian College - Recoletos joined the league in 1969. Trinity College of Quezon City also joined in 1974, the league's golden anniversary, according to newspapers and other publications of that year. (However, the NCAA's official website states that Trinity joined the league in 1985; see next section.)\nAfter the riotous games of the late 1970s, several of the founding members left the league. The Ateneo de Manila University left the league in 1978 due to violence, which also marred a championship series with San Beda, while La Salle left after a riotous game with Letran in 1980. Ateneo de Manila was accepted in the UAAP in 1978, while La Salle had to wait for six years to become a UAAP member. San Beda left the league in 1983, reasoning that the college focused on school-based sports activities like intramurals.\n\nWith the withdrawal of Ateneo de Manila, league games returned to the old Rizal Memorial and to the PhilSports Arena, since the Loyola Center was now the location of the UAAP tournament. Also with the withdrawal of the three founding members, most daily publications tagged the NCAA as \"an ironic journey from sports to violence.\"\n\nAs the league was reduced to four members, new membership was actively pursued. Perpetual Help College of Rizal was accepted as a member in 1984. A year later, Trinity College of Quezon City finally was accepted as a full member after being a probationary member for more than a decade, according to publications of that period). However, Trinity was not able to meet league requirements and was dropped from the league in 1986, the same year San Beda returned (despite sports articles in newspapers that year stating Trinity voluntarily left the league).\n\nMeasures were taken to prevent major brawls from starting such as the patrolling by the respective faculties of the member schools, to control the behavior of the crowd were implemented as part of the remedy to ensure the security during the NCAA games.\n\nThe addition of Philippine Christian University and De La Salle-College of Saint Benilde in the late 1990s brought the league membership to eight schools .\n\nTelevision coverage of NCAA basketball games was discontinued in the 1980s and 1990s by the TV networks due to the bad image of the League due to the frequent brawls during games. After several years of non television coverage of NCAA basketball games, television coverage was resumed by Vintage Television in 1998. The majority of the basketball games were aired live on IBC 13 until 1999. In 2000, the league switched the TV coverage from Vintage to the MCI group and games aired on People's Television Network but which aired only a single game of each playing day until the NCAA games were produced by Silverstar Sports in 2001.\n\nA major breakthrough occurred when the league, upon the initiative of host school San Beda, made a move that switched the television coverage of NCAA games from MCI group to ABS-CBN on March 18, 2002. Previously, only the Final Four and the Championship games were televised, but with the five-year contract inked with ABS-CBN, a majority of the elimination round basketball games were also aired, giving the league bigger exposure to fans, students and alumni. ABS-CBN would later air the games on its international affiliate, The Filipino Channel, making the games viewable to alumni and fans abroad.\n\nThe NCAA has set its plan of expansion. Division II, as it will be called, will be composed of newly admitted schools. The league has already visited and issued invitations to schools such as Arellano University, Emilio Aguinaldo College and the Lyceum of the Philippines University.\n\nIn 1998, the affiliated schools in the CALABARZON region and southern Metro Manila established NCAA South, an offshoot of the league. The schools of NCAA South do not compete with the schools in the main league.\n\nThe return of a Mapúa Juniors team, which took a leave of absence beginning NCAA Season 81 (2005–06) was scheduled in NCAA Season 83 (2007–08). Malayan High School will represent the Mapúa Institute of Technology in the Juniors Division of the NCAA. This newly established High School would only be fully operational by school year 2007-08. However, the scheduled return of the Mapua Junior varsity team in NCAA Season 83 (2007–08), did not materialize and instead it resumed participation in NCAA Season 84 (2008–09).\n\nAfter it was revealed that several players of the PCU juniors' basketball team enrolled with spurious documents, PCU's seniors and juniors teams were suspended in the 2007–08 season. The seniors teams participated in the 2008–09 season, but all teams would take an indefinite leave of absence starting at the 2009–10 season. As a result, the Management Committee conducted a search for PCU's replacement but it was decided that such replacements would be deferred to the 2010–11 season. The league opted to invite guest teams instead, with Angeles University Foundation, Arellano University (AU) and Emilio Aguinaldo College (EAC) being the invitees, and being eligible to win championships. On the next season, AU and EAC's status was upgraded to probationary membership. Lyceum of the Philippines University, which had earlier sought membership, was accepted as a guest team in the 2011–12 season. Arellano became a regular member since the 2013–14 season after meeting the league requirements. EAC and Lyceum remained on probation (the latter elevated from guest status), and their performances will be evaluated at the end of the current season.\n\nAlmost all of the rivalries of the NCAA originated from the basketball court, since basketball is the sport most covered by the media, especially on television. Most of the rivalries started due to the schools' compositions, because four of the old-timer six were schools exclusively for males from affluent families. These rivalries have declined in recent years with the withdrawal of two of the old-timer six, Ateneo and La Salle.\n\nWith the addition of new members to the league, rivalries shifted to more of a geographical nature. However, the former members would still face their old rivals in other leagues during the off-season, such as the Home and Away Invitational League, the Philippine Collegiate Championship, and the Shakey's V-League.\n\nA rivalry between the Ateneo de Manila and the University of the Philippines existed even before the formation of the NCAA. UP students would troop from Padre Faura to the Ateneo campus in Intramuros to play basketball with the Ateneans, which led to Ateneo forming the first organized cheering squad and pep band in the Philippines and what is now known as the Blue Babble Battalion.\nThis would later become \"UAAP's Battle of Katipunan\" when both universities transferred to their respective campuses along Katipunan Avenue in Quezon City, and when the two schools began competing in the UAAP.\n\nArguably the most popular rivalry in Filipino sports was forged in the NCAA: the Ateneo–La Salle rivalry. Historical records are unclear on when the rivalry began, although there are arguments pointing to La Salle's 1939 defeat of a top-seeded Ateneo basketball team and their being dethroned by the Ateneans who beat the Lasallites in the elimination round. While La Salle held their victory parade, they threw fried chickens at the Padre Faura gate of the Ateneo. However. the La Salle cage team was disbarred for fielding an ineligible player the following year (although the title would not become Ateneo's until 1941, two years after the defeat).\n\nAteneo–La Salle games were always heated, for both schools were exclusively for males. However, La Salle during its stint in the NCAA was not as strong a contender as Ateneo was \"(see Ateneo–San Beda rivalry)\", with Ateneo not meeting La Salle again until the 1958 Finals, where Ateneo prevailed. Ateneo–La Salle games are now some of the most anticipated games of the UAAP season.\n\nWith the departure of University of the Philippines, the Ateneo de Manila and San Beda College fielded the dominant basketball teams for several seasons, having won the last six titles between them. It was in this context that the fierce rivalry between the Ateneo and San Beda emerged. The two teams traded championships in the 1930s that was halted when La Salle scored an upset over Ateneo in the 1939 season. By the time World War II began, Ateneo already had the most number of NCAA senior's basketball titles with six, whereas San Beda had five titles to its name.\n\nThe ensuing years saw the two schools trade championships and end one another's winning streaks. The rivalry between the Blue Eagles and Red Lions continued and there were memorable games in the 1950s that ensued between the two teams. Carlos Loyzaga's San Beda Red Lions toppled the Ateneo Blue Eagles from 1951 to 1952. Then, the Blue Eagles under the leadership of Frankie Rabat captured the 1953 and 1954 NCAA titles. 1955 was the year when the Crispulo Zamora trophy was awarded to San Beda when they defeated Ateneo for the coveted crown. The Blue Eagles again prevailed with 1957 and 1958 back-to-back crown only to be defeated by San Beda in 1959.\n\nThe rivalry continued in the 1970s, when their sons, Chito Loyzaga and Louie Rabat met in the NCAA. The rivalry came to an end in the 1977 Finals series. In Game One, a brawl ensued among fans of the competing teams, which led to the third game being played behind closed doors, with San Beda winning the basketball championship, after Ateneo's last second shot was ruled invalid. The violence surrounding this championship series, coupled with the violence that was plaguing the league, led to the withdrawal from the NCAA of both Ateneo and San Beda. The Blue Eagles left with 14 seniors titles, a record for the most number of seniors titles that would only be tied and surpassed decades later. San Beda later won its 14th title in 2008. The Ateneo de Manila joined the UAAP, while San Beda College eventually came back to the NCAA.\n\nIn the 1970s, La Salle started its own rivalry against Letran. Letran then had 6 championships while La Salle got its fifth championship at the expense of Letran in the diamond (75th year) championship series. De La Salle College then was managed by Ambassador Eduardo Cojuangco, a known crony of then President Ferdinand Marcos. Coincidentally, Cojuangco controlled the FIBA-recognized Basketball Association of the Philippines (BAP) and was appointed by Marcos as project-director for basketball.\n\nThe rivalry came into a climax on an August 16, 1980 La Salle–Letran game. The Letran bleachers were totally unoccupied minutes before the game began; Letran school authorities would not let their students get inside unless De La Salle's team manager's \"guests\" leave the south end bleachers that are part of the Letran stands.\nThe group moved over to the north end (La Salle side) after talks between Ambassador Cojuangco and Letran Rector Fr. Regino Cortes. Only then did the Letran bleachers fill up. With the game on the way, Letran was toting a 22–18 lead when they called a time-out halfway through the first half; then, the south end reserve section (Letran side) erupted with at least five burly men (part of the guests of La Salle's team manager) ganging up on a hapless Letran high school sophomore student for a full minute before police could intervene. But for the mauled student, none was picked up (by the police). Almost simultaneously, the La Salle bench suddenly stood up, the players hunched and protecting their heads with towels and jackets against various missiles pelted on them.\n\nThe \"guests\" of De La Salle's team manager were also present during that time when La Salle was able to win over Letran on August 6. Should La Salle win on August 16, it still has to face San Beda (the other qualifier) and win to clinch the round championship; a victory by Letran over La Salle gives it the first round flag.\n\nCojuangco never explained why his \"guests\" just happened to be positioned in the Letran side of the Coliseum. La Salle for its part, claims that the five men who beat up the Letran student were La Salle students, and both teams went immediately to their respective dugouts. A large number of spectators were hurt, and a great portion of the coliseum was damaged. The game was called off by the NCAA and ordered a replay behind closed doors, but the BAP ordered the remainder of the season to be canceled. La Salle then announced on a press conference on September 1981 that they will withdraw from the NCAA effective at the end of the 1980–81 season.\n\nThe BAP had its findings released that the rumble was started by Letran students thus giving Letran a one-year layoff in the NCAA. Letran was immediately reinstated back in 1981.\n\nAfter the former members transferred to the UAAP, new rivalries were formed and the NCAA slowly revived its former glory.\n\nAfter both Ateneo and La Salle left, San Sebastian (frequently shortened to \"Baste\") strengthened their basketball program. The recruitment of Paul Alvarez by San Sebastian and Samboy Lim by Letran provided several close games in the 1980s which led to the birth of the rivalry.\n\nIn the 1980s, Letranites were notorious for yelling profanities at the San Sebastian players, and on one occasion, led to a rumble at Vito Cruz Avenue when at the last second, a power interruption occurred, causing confusion on what team won the championship. The rumbles between the two schools have become more frequent which solidified the intense rivalry between the two schools. Paul Alvarez would later play for the Pennsylvania Valley Dawgs of the United States Basketball League.\n\nThe rivalry continued in the turn of the millennium when the Stags met the Knights in the finals twice. This led to several memorable games in which the Knights won the 1998 edition with a barrage of three-pointers and free way ows by Letran's Nicholas Pacheco with a few seconds remaining to win their 13th championship. The Knights also became the first 4th seed to upset the 1st seed in the Final Four when they defeated the Stags twice during the 1999 NCAA Final Four. That feat would soon be duplicated the following year when the 4th seed Stags upended top seed JRC Heavy Bombers in the 2000 NCAA Final Four. The Knights went on to win the 1999 NCAA championship. In the 2003 NCAA Finals, the Stags (defending champs) made a rally in the 4th quarter in the 3rd game of their series and kept Letran scoreless for almost 6 minutes that led them to take the lead but Boyet Bautista started the comeback by tying the game at 48-all and then his teammates Jonathan Piñera and Aaron Aban finished the game to win their 15th championship at the expense of the Stags. In 2004, they renewed their rivalry in the second round of eliminations wherein Letran denied Baste's Final 4 hopes and eventually broke their streak of Final Four appearances (since the inception of the final four format in 1998 San Sebastian is always in the Final Four) making it their worst performance in 6 years.\n\nIn 2009, Letran ended San Sebastian's 15 winning streak as they gave out the Stags' first loss of the season, and the Knights prevented the Golden Stags from sweeping the 18 game elimination round to qualify outright in the Finals\n\nIn 2010, Letran gave San Sebastian a scare as the Stags escaped the Knights with a one-point lead.and The Stags put the Knights in the brink of elimination\n\nIn 2011, Letran once again ended the Stags' 15-game winning streak and gave its first loss of the season via overtime.\n\nIn 2012, Letran swept the series against San Sebastian at the elimination round. With the Stags had a twice-to-beat advantage over the Knights, Letran once again beat San Sebastian to force another game as Kevin Alas scored 43 points, in the do-or-die game, Letran came back in the fourth quarter to beat the Stags, 73–70, eliminating the Stags from the Finals contention versus San Beda.\n\nIn 2017, Both schools met in the playoffs for the first time since 2013 but this time in a hard way with Lyceum sweeping the regular season 18-0 and automatically advances to the finals. 3 teams tied for the number 4 seed in the stepladder semifinals with San Sebastian has the highest quotient among the 3 against Letran & Arellano with the latter 2 needed to figure it out in a knock out match (in which Letran won) in the right to face against San Sebastian. In the 4th-seed playoff game, San Sebastian's Michael Calisaan scored a season-high and a career-high double double performance of 36 points and 10 rebounds to eliminate Letran anew with a score of 74-69(with the Golden Stags scoring the last 5 points including a 3-point shot going into regulation that put away the game from the Knights) to advanced to the 1st round of the stepladder semifinals facing off against their other archrivals the JRU Heavy Bombers.\n\nThe \"Battle of Intramuros,\" which is so named because the two schools are three blocks apart from each other in Intramuros, is the name given to the Letran-Mapúa games. The Cardinals have had the mastery of the Knights in recent years. For eight consecutive years from 1998, Letran has failed to beat Mapúa in the eliminations rounds at least twice (either they will split the eliminations or Mapúa will win twice), even though the Knights were more successful in the league.\n\nThe Knights were finally able to beat Mapúa in the first round of the 2005 tournament, but the Cardinals avenged that loss in the second round when they dealt the Knights with their first and only defeat of the season. Letran Knights were on their way on scoring a rare a 14–0 sweep of the elimination round when they were stopped by the Mapúa Cardinals in their twelfth game of the eliminations Letran and Mapúa would split their games in subsequent seasons.In 2009 Letran finally end its 2nd-round losing streak against Mapúa and its first sweep against their Intramuros rivals in league history\n\nAlthough the only instance where Letran and Mapúa met in the Finals was in the 1979 season where the Knights prevailed, the championship won by the Cardinals in 1981 (the games were suspended in the 1980 season due to the La Salle–Letran fracas) proved to be a spoiler once again as it denied Letran the bragging rights to the unprecedented honor of being the first ever NCAA team to win five consecutive seniors championships (Letran also won the 1982, 1983, and 1984 crowns), a feat that would later on be achieved by the San Sebastian Stags from 1993–97.\n\nThis short lived rivalry sparked when the De La Salle - College of Saint Benilde, who joined only in 1998, met San Sebastian College - Recoletos (or simply Baste) in the finals of 2000, and 2002. CSB won in the Finals of 2000, bannered by what is dubbed as the best CSB Blazers team ever assembled. With 1999 NCAA Rookie of the Year and 2002 NCAA MVP Sunday Salvacion, Jondan Salvador, and 2000 NCAA Rookie of the Year Alejandro Magpayo leading the charge, the St. Benilde Blazers beat the formidable San Sebastian Stags and won their first NCAA seniors basketball championship title, despite joining the league a season earlier. This marks the fastest win for any new school in the league since the World War.\n\nHowever, the Stags avenged their defeat and triumphed over CSB in the Finals of 2002, where they swept Blazers, 2–0. The Stags' Leomar Najorda was adjudged the 2002 NCAA Finals MVP.\n\nThe rivalry started in 1972 when José Rizal was playing in the championship against new member San Sebastian. The Heavy Bombers was bannered by Philip Cezar, David Cezar, Ed Carvajal, Jess Sta. Maria, Cris Calilan, Olimpio Santos, Jimmy Santos and Norberto Rivera. San Sebastian has their own superstar with the like of Dave Supnet. JRU (JRC then) captured the NCAA crown which up to this date is the last time José Rizal won a championship. Years later the two teams again figured in a mini rivalry, San Sebastian's Paul Alvarez and José Rizal's Vergel Meneses figured in a PABL Slam Dunk contest in 1987 in which Meneses won the contest. As contrasted with SSC-R's five consecutive championships in the 1990s, JRC continued to struggle and not until 1999 where the Heavy Bombers made it to the finals but lost to the defending champion Letran Knights.\n\nIn 2000, the Golden Stags and the Heavy Bombers met in the Final Four. JRC clinched the  1 seed while SSC-R got the 4th seed. The Stags defeated the Bombers twice to advance to the Finals against CSB. Thus, the Stags became the second (Letran did the trick in 1999 also against the Stags) 4th seed to upset the 1st seed in the Final Four. SSC-R and JRU also met in the 2001 Finals. JRU was bannered by Ariel Capus, season MVP Ernani Epondulan, Rodel Milla, Joel Finuliar and razzle dazzle pointguard Erwin Estebal while San Sebastian was led by Mark Macapagal, Christian Coronel and Jam Alfad. JRU lost in the series, which included a 33-point blowout loss in the deciding Game 3. Coronel was named as the 2001 NCAA Finals MVP.\n\nThe rivalry continued during Final Four appearances of both schools from 2002 and 2003. Not until the 2007 NCAA season when San Sebastian's Final Four chances was denied by José Rizal via a 7-point winning margin in a come from behind victory. The Stags was ahead by 7 points against the Heavy Bombers 1:10 to go in regulation. José Rizal capitalized on the errors of San Sebastian and force an overtime to win the game. This allowed JRU to grab the number 3 spot in the Final Four. JRU had another part in eliminating SSC-R in the 2008 season when they were tied for the number 2 seed with two other teams; in the ensuing classification playoffs JRU and San Sebastian met in the first round to decide which team will figure in a playoff for the No. 2 seed; the Heavy Bombers won the game and relegated San Sebastian to the fourth-seed playoffs where they were eliminated. In 2009 San Sebastian and JRU renewed their rivalry once again in the Final Four wherein a Jimbo Aquino-less-Golden Stags (whose serving a one game-suspension after committing a flagrant foul against San Beda for the 1st-seed playoff which also barred him from getting any individual awards) were beaten by the Heavy Bombers 72-65 in Game 1, But in Game 2 of their semifinals series with Jimbo Aquino returning from his suspension The Stags defeated The Heavy Bombers 79–64 and the Stags entered the Finals for the first time since 2003 wherein the Stags loses against the Letran Knights in 3 games. Eventually the Stags won the championship against the four-peat seeking Red Lions wherein the Stags had its vengeance on the Red Lions via sweep The Stags' Jimbo Aquino was named the 2009 NCAA Finals MVP and ending San Beda's dynasty San Sebastian won its last title since 2002 when they swept the St. Benilde Blazers. In 2010 San Sebastian and JRU once again met in the playoffs for the third consecutive year and second in the semifinals with San Beda's sweep of the elimination round which led to a stepladder format in the semifinals JRU and Mapúa figure it out in the first round in which JRU won 60–54 The Heavy Bombers advance to the next round against the defending champions San Sebastian Stags. But in that Part III of San Sebastian-JRU. San Sebastian won the game 61–52, completing a season series sweep against the Heavy Bombers (also in 2002 and 2003) and making it a second consecutive finals appearance for the Golden Stags and faces last years' Finals tormentor and losing finalist San Beda Red Lions. In 2017 both San Sebastian & JRU met in the semifinals for the first time since 2010 with the top-seeded Lyceum swept the regular season. the 3rd-seeded Heavy Bombers (who swept the Golden Stags in the regular season that will give them an advantage) faces the 4th-seeded Golden Stags (who survive a scare from a stubborn Letran team that pave the way for them to enter the semifinals) but in that San Sebastian-JRU game was different as the Golden Stags emerged victorious after San Sebastian blew the game wide open as they led by 26 points heading in the 4th quarter despite JRU putting San Sebastian into the penalty situation early in the 4th quarter and managing to cut the deficit by at least 15 points but the resilient Golden Stags still won the game over the Heavy Bombers 85-73, to advanced to another knockout match against defending champions San Beda Red Lions.\n\nThe rivalry started on October 28, 1950 when Letran and San Beda meet in the finals for the first time. Letran then was led by Lauro Mumar while San Beda was led by Carlos Loyzaga. Letran is on the verge of sweeping the tournament to become eventual champions (the Final 4 format was not yet implemented), but San Beda spoiled it and beat them to arrange a championship showdown with the Knights. In the finals, Letran got their sweet revenge as they beat San Beda to get their second title in the NCAA. The Letran team was called \"Murder Inc.\" by the late Willie Hernandez because of their merciless brand of basketball, very unforgiving. After that historic match, San Beda kept on winning many championships until the 1970s while Letran ended the 1970s with only six championships. During the 1980s the NCAA has seen the downfall of the San Beda basketball program while Letran peaked and became a powerhouse team that will continue until the millennium decade.\n\nWith the exit of their fierce rivals, Ateneo for San Beda and La Salle for Letran, some say the rivalry has died down because of their heaven and earth situation not until in 2006 when the Lions won their 12th championship after 28 years. During that same year San Beda won twice against Letran and denied the Knights to gain a twice-to-beat advantage in the Final Four.\n\nIn 2007, San Beda and Letran played for the championship for the second time and was dubbed \"The Dream Finals\" because it featured two NCAA teams who have very rich basketball history and tradition and in this series, San Beda has a championship score to settle with Letran (to avenge their defeat in the finals 57 years ago). The Red Lions eventually swept the Knights, 2–0. San Beda's Rogemar Menor was named as the 2007 NCAA Finals MVP. Right now they are the most anticipated games in the NCAA which led to bringing the games at the Araneta Coliseum. They are also compared to UAAP's Ateneo–La Salle where in some columnists say it is the \"icing in the cake\" of today's NCAA.\n\nAlso called the \"New Age Rivalry\", Perpetual has established itself as a perennial contender for the modern times, their path to the title has always been blocked by San Beda.\n\nThe University of Perpetual Help has made the Final Four in four out of the previous five seasons only to be ousted by eventual champion San Beda College every single time.\n\nThis rivalry is totally different and interesting. It is started on Season 86. Arellano and Perpetual are tight and wild contenders in many sports, such as Basketball, Track and Field, and especially in Beach Volleyball, volleyball, and cheerleading. Through the following years, the 2 schools are the team to beat in volleyball and cheerleading. In these particular sports, these two schools are always in the Final 2, they are always compete with each other and vie for the win. Even if this rivalry is tough, the 2 schools had a great relationship at each other. Key players for this rivalry are Arellano's Jiovanni Jalalon, Zach Nicholls, John Pinto, and Keith Agovida, in basketball; Christine Joy Rosario, Menchie Tubiera, Rialen Sante, and Danna Henson in volleyball. While on Perpetual are: Scottie Thompson, Bright Akhuetie, Gerald Dizon, in basketball; Royse Tubino, Coleen Bravo, and Lourdes Clemente in volleyball.\n\n\n\n"}

Kimiyo Hoshi is a distinct character from the DC villain of the same name. She has, however, crossed paths with the villainous Doctor Light on several occasions.\n\nDoctor Light appeared in the sixth season by Emmie Nagata in the television series \"The Flash\".\n\nDoctor Light first appeared in \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" #4 and was created by Marv Wolfman and George Pérez.\n\nKimiyo Tazu Hoshi, a brilliant but overly-driven scientist, was the supervising astronomer at an observatory in Japan, overseeing a group of astronomers charting the unnatural effects of the \"Crisis on Infinite Earths.\" (She is also a medical doctor, as shown in \"Justice League Annual\" #3 (1989) and \"Justice League America\" #55 (October 1991).)\n\nAs the Crisis continued, Hoshi's fascination with the phenomenon grew into an obsession while the men grew concerned for their safety. Disgusted by their mounting fear, Hoshi arrogantly insulted them and ordered an evacuation, leaving her to study the Crisis alone through her telescope.\n\nMeanwhile, the Monitor, a being linked with all positive matter, senses his enemy, the Anti-Monitor, absorbing yet another positive-matter Earth with his antimatter cloud. In order to tip the scales for the heroes of the positive universe, the Monitor activates one last warrior.\n\nHe sends a devastating beam of energy from the star Vega to Earth, which strikes the observing Hoshi, leaving massive destruction in its wake. Granted the power of photonics and the name Doctor Light, Hoshi is assigned by the Monitor to guard one of the vibrational forks needed to save the Earth. Teen Titans member Starfire and Outsiders member Halo set out to destroy the machine. Since Doctor Light can't speak to them in English, she resorts to blasting them away from the machine. Superman is the first to communicate with her, given his knowledge of most of Earth's languages.\n\nOnce the Earth's heroes and villains are brought aboard the Monitor's satellite, the Japanese-speaking Katana takes over as Kimiyo's translator.\n\nDoctor Light, granted the ability to understand English, accompanies several heroes to the anti-matter universe to confront the Anti-Monitor. She and Superman soon discover the machines that the villain has deployed to destroy the remaining Earths. The Anti-Monitor ambushes the Man of Steel; Doctor Light defends Superman as best she can. Supergirl arrives, and sacrifices her life, allowing Doctor Light to carry the unconscious Superman to safety.\n\nSeeing Supergirl's sacrifice makes Doctor Light realize how selfish she has been, and she resolves to change.\n\nWhen Harbinger summons her to fight in the final battle, Doctor Light is ready. As the other heroes barrage the Anti-Monitor, she absorbs the energy of a gigantic star that he is using as a power source. Scoring the first fall of the Anti-Monitor during that battle, she blasts a gaping hole through him.\n\nIn the post-\"Crisis\" continuity, Supergirl was written out of existence, so it is explained that Doctor Light was inspired by the other heroes.\n\nShe is potentially one of the most powerful superheroines in the DC Universe, but she has not tapped into the heightened levels of power she used during the Crisis. (Although few remember those events, Doctor Light is one of the few who do, seeing as how she once mentioned in \"Showcase '96\" #9 (October 1996) that she's faced \"Anti-Matter Gods\").\n\nDoctor Light has joined the Justice League a few times over the years, most notably as a member of Justice League Europe during the latter half of its incarnation. She also joined an incarnation of the Doom Patrol for a period of time. During her time on the Justice League Europe, she believed that her anti-social attitude during the Crisis was due to the food she regularly ate, after Power Girl is diagnosed with a similar condition. However, it is revealed that her behavior in Crisis was, in fact, her genuine behavior. While a member of the Justice League, Doctor Light formed significant friendships with The Flash (Wally West) and Power Girl. There is a protracted period of animosity with the member of the Global Guardians known as Rising Sun. His romantic endeavours win out and the two enter into a relationship\n\nIn \"Green Arrow\" vol. 3, #54 (November 2005), following his recovery from the mind-wipe he suffered at the hands of the Justice League, Arthur Light, the villainous male Doctor Light attacked Doctor Hoshi and drained her of her powers.\n\nIt appeared that her de-powerment was temporary; in \"Infinite Crisis\" #5 (February 2006) she used her powers to aid in the evacuation of Tokyo, Japan. In that same issue she was warned by Bart Allen, in the costume of the Silver Age Flash, of the escape of an enraged Superboy-Prime. She was later seen in \"Infinite Crisis #7\" (April 2006) battling the evil Doctor Light.\n\nA flashback in \"Action Comics\" #838 (June 2006) reveals that Doctor Light and The Ray, heroes possessing solar-based powers, took part in an unsuccessful attempt to re-activate Superman's powers.\n\nHowever, an article discussing the destruction of Star City (and, by extension, Kimiyo's depowerment) appeared at the \"52\" website, which is designed to complement the weekly comic series. The article places a date on the city's destruction, which was depicted in the final 2 Pre-OYL Green Arrow arcs, specifying that the event took place on May 15. Problematically, this dating places the story \"after\" the events depicted in \"Infinite Crisis\".\n\nGiven this dating, Kimiyo's depowerment took place during the events of \"52\" - Week 2 which, given Kimiyo and Green Arrow's appearances at the end of \"52\" - Week 1, would appear to make sense, although it in turn makes nonsense of information contained in \"Green Arrow\" vol. 3, #54, where it is revealed that Kimiyo has not used her powers for two years.\n\nThe story arc also concludes with Green Arrow experiencing a strange multiplying effect that places the story during Infinite Crisis, not two weeks after the event's conclusion. (Several other characters in the DCU experienced this effect in the issue of their titles that immediately preceded the OYL jump).\n\nKimiyo Hoshi appeared in costume in \"52\" Week 35, alongside various other heroes. All are assisting the injured victims of Lex Luthor, who had caused a rain of 'supermen' by deactivating their powers. She is also shown in \"52\" Week 50, in the climactic battle of World War III.\n\nDr. Light appears in \"World War III: United We Stand\", the fourth issue of the \"World War III\" mini-series that coincided with \"52\" Week 50. She is one of the first wave of heroes who confront (and are taken down by) Black Adam. He grasps her neck with such force that she instantly blacks out; he throws her aside.\n\nGeoff Johns has revealed on his message board that he is working on storylines involving Doctor Light.\n\nOracle invites Kimiyo to join the Birds of Prey (issue #100), but she was not selected to take part in the first mission. She does, however, appear in \"Birds of Prey\" #113 (January 2008), assisting Oracle by scanning the electromagnetic spectrum for any evidence that might lead her to the parties responsible for an influx of hi-tech weaponry being smuggled into Metropolis. She is, however, unable to locate any such evidence.\n\nDoctor Light is only occasionally active in the superhero community because she is a single mother with two children: Imako, her daughter, and Yasu, her son. Gail Simone confirmed in a chat on comicbloc.com that Kimiyo's children have not been retconned out of existence by the recent changes to DC continuity (that resulted from the transformation of The Post Crisis Earth into \"New Earth\" during \"Infinite Crisis\").\n\nDoctor Light works in S.T.A.R. Labs and has an interior monologue about the erratic fluctuations in her powers that lead to her retirement from superheroing. Upon returning home from work, she is ambushed by the Dakota-based super-team the Shadow Cabinet. After briefly talking with the heroes, she becomes enraged and attacks them after coming to believe they have harmed her children, only to be quickly neutralized and kidnapped by the team. However, this is later revealed to have been orchestrated by Superman and Icon, as a way for both Shadow Cabinet and the League to gain information on each other. Hardware uses the candle that was once Arthur Light (Arthur having been recently killed by the Spectre) to restore Kimiyo's powers, allowing her to quickly defeat a powered-up Shadow Thief and his master, a restored and more powerful Starbreaker.\n\nKimiyo has been confirmed to be a member of the newest incarnation of the Justice League. In the \"Blackest Night\" crossover, Kimiyo and the remaining members of the League arrive at the Hall of Justice in order to find Firestorm after hearing of the Black Lantern attacks taking place across the globe. Upon entering the Hall, Kimiyo senses the presence of her villainous counterpart, and separates from the group, believing this Black Lantern is hers alone to face. However, Kimiyo soon finds herself at the mercy of the Black Lantern Arthur Light. Although initially her powers seem to be ineffectual against the Black Lantern Light, when he threatens the lives of her children, Kimiyo manages to generate a light strong enough to destroy him and his black ring. She then proceeds to do the same to the Black Lantern versions of former JLA members Steel and Vibe, before passing out.\n\nIn the aftermath of the ordeal, Vixen tells Kimiyo that she is taking a leave of absence from the team in order to recover from her injuries. With Red Tornado destroyed, John Stewart temporarily offworld, and Firestorm unable to return to the team, Kimi is left with no members for the JLA. Luckily, she is approached by Donna Troy, who joins the team alongside her friends Cyborg, Dick Grayson, and Starfire. With the costume given to her by Hardware destroyed, Kimiyo designs a new one, and then travels to Metropolis in order to recruit Mon-El and the Guardian. Kimiyo briefly appears during the \"War of the Supermen\", where she and the rest of the JLA attempt to repel General Zod's invasion forces.\n\nAfter just three issues together, the new JLA team loses most of its members, with Kimiyo temporarily leaving the team in order to be with her children. Back in Metropolis, Kimiyo helps Supergirl rescue her friend Lana Lang after her body is possessed by the Insect Queen. A short time later, Kimiyo and Gangbuster investigate an object that crashes into a Metropolis park and leaves a massive crystallized crater in its center. While searching the crater, the two heroes discover a Bizarro-like creature that resembles Supergirl. Before Kimiyo can call for help, the creature lashes out and attacks her. The Bizarro Supergirl takes Kimiyo and her associates hostage, but is ultimately defeated in battle by the real Supergirl. It is revealed that the Bizarro Supergirl is a refugee from the cube-shaped Bizarro World, and was sent to Earth by her cousin after their planet was attacked by a being known as the Godship. Kimiyo attempts to take the Bizarro Supergirl to S.T.A.R. Labs, only to be knocked unconscious by Supergirl, who then absconds with her doppelganger and her ship, hoping to stop the Godship and save Bizarro World.\n\nDespite resigning from active duty, Doctor Light appears as one of the numerous heroes assembled at Washington, D.C. in order to break an energy dome trapping the Justice League and the Crime Syndicate of America within the city, as well as a member of the JLA's reserve roster during the team's battle against Eclipso. She also assists the League (as well as several other teams) during a battle against the Secret Six, where she is gunned down by Deadshot.\n\nKimiyo appears in the \"Rebirth\" storyline Heroes in Crisis and is among many superheroes that are interviewed in the Sanctuary, a therapeutic facility to help heroes deal with the emotional costs of their pursuits. Kimiyo is revealed to be Arthur Light's ex-wife, as previously mentioned in the \"Trinity War\" storyline, and mother of their three children Tommy, Emma and Sakura.\n\nExposure to energy from the star Vega granted Doctor Light photokinesis: control over all forms of light sources, without relying on equipment. She can absorb all forms of illumination as energy, which allowed her to survive Starbreaker's attack, as well as absorb the energy of the sun to attack the Anti-Monitor. She can project energy, allowing her to shoot destructive laser beams and other blasts of destructive energy, blind her opponents with blinding flashes of light (capable of dispersing Shadow Thief's shadow constructs), and create protective barriers. She can focus photons into \"hard light\" (a fictional form of energy which acts like a solid object). She can refract lightwaves to create holographic images. She can turn into light, rendering her invisible to the naked eye. Her abilities also allow her to disperse radiation and holographic illusions, scan and \"see\" the electromagnetic spectrum, track ionized molecules, and convert her body to near light to minimize her mass and escape gravitational pull. She can sense the light around her, which she describes as a \"sixth sense\" allowing her to know when somebody enters the room. She can ride lightwaves in order to fly, capable of reaching the speed of light, and outrunning the Superman of Earth-1. She has used her powers to generate sunlight from a yellow sun to heal injured Kryptonians and Daxamites. Her light abilities appear to have granted her enhanced durability, as she has survived attacks that have knocked out Power Girl and other enhanced metahumans. She can also teleport, from Earth to the Watchtower.\n\nOutside of her light-based abilities, she is also a brilliant scientific mind; in early appearances, she considered herself a scientist foremost and superhero second. She is a prominent astronomer, the world's foremost authority on light technology. She even ran S.T.A.R. Labs for a time. On several occasions, she has also displayed knowledge of medicine. Conversations with Batman have also revealed knowledge of Asian martial arts, if not the ability to use it effectively in combat.\n\nHer primary weakness is that she requires a light source to fuel her powers, and being placed in an area of absolute darkness severely weakens her abilities; she can, however, store energy for such occasions. Her other weakness is that she's afraid of the dark. On occasions when she has been surrounded by unnatural darkness, however, Kimiyo has been able to use logic to overcome her fear and win the day.\n\nDoctor Light appears as a major character and member of the Justice League in the \"JLA/The 99\" limited series, which takes place in an alternate continuity where the characters of the DC Universe and Teshkeel Comics coexist on the same world. Along with Vixen, Doctor Light is touted as an example of the racial and cultural diversity that the League encompasses.\n\nThe Kimiyo Hoshi version of Doctor Light made a cameo in the tie-in comic to the \"Teen Titans\" animated series. In an alternate universe, she serves as the heroic counterpart to Titans villain Doctor Light and is allied with the Brotherhood of Justice to stop the Teen Tyrants.\n\nIn the alternate timeline of the \"Flashpoint\" event, Dr. Kimiyo Hoshi is a member of the H.I.V.E. council. She voted against using nuclear weapons to end the war in Western Europe between Aquaman and Wonder Woman.\n\nIn an alternate history version of World War II, Kimiyo Hoshi is the chief scientist for Amanda Waller's Bombshells project. She acts as one of Kate Kane's handlers. In addition, she has powers similar to her mainstream counterparts and is in a romantic relationship with Big Barda.\n\n\n\nDoctor Light appears in \"DC Super Hero Girls\". She is a background student at Super Hero High.\n\nDoctor Light appears in \"DC Universe Online\".\n\n"}

It is located on Highway 2A, south of the provincial capital, Edmonton, and north of Calgary, the nearest major city. The closest neighbouring communities are the towns of Didsbury and Crossfield. Carstairs is located entirely within the rural Mountain View County.\n\nNamed after Carstairs, Scotland, Carstairs began life as a loading platform on the railway connecting Calgary to Edmonton. The first post office opened in 1900. The first school district was established in 1901.\n\nIn the 2016 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the Town of Carstairs recorded a population of 4,077 living in 1,544 of its 1,590 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2011 population of 3,442. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2016.\n\nIn the 2011 Census, the Town of Carstairs had a population of 3,442 living in 1,311 of its 1,397 total dwellings, a change of 27.5% from its 2006 adjusted population of 2,699. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2011.\n\nFirst Student Canada provides commuter bus service to Calgary from Didsbury and Carstairs. The service loads commuters at the Carstairs Curling Club.\n\nCarstairs is home to an 18-hole golf course, a Memorial Complex with abundant parks and playgrounds, and Tourist Information Center. Just west of town is the Silver Willow 9-hole golf course. Carstairs has historically been an agricultural community, as it once had seven grain elevators. It celebrates each year with the Ranch Rodeo in June, Beef & Barley Days and the annual rodeo in July, the High School Rodeo in September, 4-H Calf Show and Sale, Bull-A-Rama, Horticultural Show, and Pumpkin Festival.\n\nThere are seven churches in the town, including the Carstairs Church of God, St. Agnes Catholic Church, and the Carstairs Bancroft United Church. One of the churches is being used as a museum that often has religious services.\n\nThe origins of the Town of Carstairs dates back centuries to a network of trails collectively known as the Ancient Trail (also referred to as The Old North Trail and the Wolf Track). This important transportation corridor passed through the Carstairs area. Several prominent rock formations along river and creek beds were found in the district, and these were known resting and stopping sites for First Nations people as they moved up-and-down this corridor.\n\nAs the fur trade developed and settlement grew, the newcomers to the region adopted the same network of trails that had been used for centuries. In 1883, one of those newcomers, Sam Scarlett, set up a Stopping House at one of the prominent rock formations along the Rosebud River. \"Scarlett's\" became an important and popular stop along the Calgary Edmonton Trail - frequented by freighters, the NWMP, military and the various stage coach lines.\n\nWhen the Calgary & Edmonton Railway arrived in 1890, the surveyors made an allotment for a siding, station house, and townsite to be built in relative proximity to Scarlett's Stopping House. However, to avoid crossing the Rosebud River at that point, the rail line was laid approximately 4 km west of Scarlett's.\n\nNamed 'Carstairs' the new townsite's development started-off slowly, but by the turn of the 20th Century, the area began a steady growth pattern that allowed it to be official recognized as Carstairs, NWT on May 15, 1903. The name changed to Carstairs, Alta in 1905 when Alberta received official Provincial status.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1929429", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1929429", "title": "Gastão Rosenfeld", "text": "Gastão Rosenfeld\n\nGastão Rosenfeld (born Budapest, July 26, 1912; died São Paulo, July 15, 1990), was a Brazilian physician and biomedical scientist, one of the co-discoverers of bradykinin, together with Maurício Rocha e Silva and Wilson Teixeira Beraldo, in 1949.\n\nRosenfeld was born in 1912 in Budapest, Hungary, to a family of Jewish origin, and came with his parents to Brazil in 1913, graduating in medicine in 1938. Since 1932, he began to devote himself to Hematology. His work at the Butantan Institute, a research institution located in São Paulo. began in 1945, invited by Prof. William Otto Bier a famous bacteriologist (then director of the Institute), and soon was charged with organizing and heading the Laboratory of Hematology and being responsible for its research line on Experimental Hematology. \n\nIn 1947 Dr. Rosenfeld started to work at São Paulo's Instituto Biológico, but returned to the Institute in 1951. and in 1954 took over as chief physician at the Hospital Vital Brazil, where he served until 1966.\n\nThe hospital was founded by Dr. Vital Brazil, one of the world pioneers in the study of animal envenomation and was purposed as a unit of acute care for the victims of venomous animals. As such, Dr. Rosenfeld was concerned about the lack of medical knowledge about the actions of venoms on the human body and its medical therapy, at the time. Due to the fact that it was the only hospital in Brazil which was exclusively dedicated to these episodes, and, besides, since it was attached to a research and educational institution, Dr. Rosenfeld favored from the beginning the systematic observation of patients, resulting over the years in a large and original body of new knowledge about symptoms and treatment of victims of animal poisoning. This, in addition, spurred the realization of a large number of laboratory studies. Based on his experience in the field of hematology, Dr. Rosenfeld published many studies on the pathophysiology of snake bite poisoning in experimental animals, and was able to apply this rich knowledge to the clinical area. \n\nRosenfeld was interested in the study of biochemistry of the action of snake venom toxins in animals and humans, particularly those of the Bothrops family (lancehead or jararaca), which is extremely abundant all over Brazil and which caused a great number of accidents and deaths at his time. Among other things, he investigated the action of the venom of this snake on fibrinolysis and blood coagulation. \n\nIn 1948, as part of a research team at the Instituto Biológico, Dr. Rosenfeld co-discovered, with two other Brazilian physiologists and pharmacologists, Drs. Maurício Rocha e Silva and Wilson Teixeira Beraldo, a new endogenous peptide capable of causing a powerful fall of blood pressure on animal preparations, which they called bradykinin. The substance, a short kinin with nine amino acids only, was detected in the blood plasma of dogs after the addition of venom extracted from the \"Bothrops jararaca\" snake, brought by Rosenfeld from the Butantan Institute. The discovery was part of a continuing study on circulatory shock and proteolytic enzymes related to the toxicology of snake bites, started by Rocha e Silva as early as 1939.\n\nBradykinin was to prove a new autopharmacological principle, i.e., a substance that is released in the body by a metabolic modification from precursors, which are pharmacologically active. The discovery of bradykinin led to a new understanding of many physiological and pathological phenomena including circulatory shock induced by venoms and toxins. Ultimately, the extensive study of the origins of its formation in the body, by Sérgio Henrique Ferreira, a noted Brazilian pharmacologist, and others, led to the development of new anti-hypertensive agents in humans, such as captopril, developed by Squibb under the name of Capoten, and still widely used. However, the team of Brazilian scientists, including Rocha e Silva, Beraldo, Rosenfeld and Ferreira never came to enjoy the royalties of such discovery, since they always published in the public domain of pure scientific knowledge.\n\nAmong his many other contributions to biomedical sciences are the development of a rapid staining for blood smears combining May–Grunwald and Giemsa techniques in 1947 (Rosenfeld staining), the introduction a new treatment for chronic leukemia using personal control of maintenance dosis (1955) and described hementerin, an anticoagulant isolated of a Brazilian species of leech (\"Haementeria depressa\") jointly with Eva Maria Antonia Kelen in 1975.\nDr. Rosenfeld was also an important scientific leader, having been involved in the foundation of the Brazilian Society for the Advancement of Science, in 1949. \n\nIn addition, he was an accomplished amateur photographer. A part of his photographic collection between 1962 and 1976 has been preserved at the Instituto Moreira Salles.\n\n\n\n"}

These can be intentional or produced by error. This type of error is highly sought after by collectors, and examples can fetch high prices.\n\nThe earliest mules are found among ancient Greek and Roman coins. Opinion is divided between those who think that they are accidental, the result of an incorrect combination of a new die with one that had officially been withdrawn from use, or the work of coiners working with dies stolen from an official mint, perhaps at a time when one of them should have been destroyed.\n\nThe name derives from the mule, the hybrid offspring of a horse and a donkey, due to such a coin having two sides intended for different coins, much as a mule has parents of two different species.\n\nIn March 2014 the Royal Mint confirmed a pair of mule 2014 bullion coins struck in 999 fine silver: approximately 38,000 £2 Lunar Horse coins and 17,000 £2 Britannia coins. The Lunar Horses were struck with the denticled Britannia obverse while the Britannias were stuck with the non-denticled Lunar Horse obverse. \n\nIn February 2009, \"Coin World\" reported that some 2007 Abigail Adams medals, from the U.S. Mint, were struck using the reverse from the 2008 Louisa Adams medal, apparently by mistake. These pieces were contained within the 2007 First Spouse medal set. The U.S. Mint has not released an estimate of how many mules were made. eBay prices in March 2009 were reported as high as $925.99.\n\nIn 1967, a New Zealand 2 cent coin was issued, featuring the obverse of the Bahamian 5 cent coin, see Coins of the New Zealand dollar.\n\nIn June 2009 a rare dateless British 20 pence mule was reported to be in circulation, resulting from the accidental combination of old and new dies in production following a 2008 redesign of UK coinage, with an estimated 50,000 to 200,000 mules released before the error was noticed.\n\nThe Winter Olympic coins produced in the Royal Canadian Mint Olympic coins program for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver featured several mules which entered circulation.\n\nOne of the first authentic mule errors to be released by the U.S. Mint (as opposed to the deliberate mules of the mid-1800s) was the 2000 Sacagawea dollar – Washington quarter mule. It features the obverse of a Washington state quarter and the reverse of a Sacagawea dollar. This coin was struck on a Sacagawea dollar planchet. The mint confirmed in July 2000 that the coin was a legitimate error, created by the accidental replacement of a cracked Sacagawea obverse die with a Washington obverse die. Several thousand of the coins were reported to have been minted before the error was discovered, and mint employees recovered and destroyed most of them. As of May 2019, 18 are publicly known to exist and have been certified, of which 14 are owned by a coin collector named Tommy Bolack. A specimen was sold in August 2012 for $155,250.\n\nSometimes mints use proof dies in the production of business coins. Coins produced when an identifiable proof die is \"married\" with a business die are known as \"handsome\" mules. The details on proof coins are often noticeably sharper.\n"}

Flower Alley sired the 2012 Kentucky Derby Winner and Preakness Stakes winner, I'll Have Another.\n\nThree Chimneys was the first thoroughbred breeding farm to advertise on the Internet. It also launched a series of commercials in 2006 to be aired during the Triple Crown races. The first one was a CGI of swimming sperm patterned after the positions in the 2000 Breeders' Cup Mile, won in dramatic fashion by Three Chimneys stallion War Chant, with the message, \"To make a champion, begin with the first race.\" The rest were in the form of dating personals from several of the farm's stallions, seeking mares.

{"id": "1929452", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1929452", "title": "Kyasanur Forest disease", "text": "Kyasanur Forest disease\n\nKyasanur forest disease (KFD) is a tick-borne viral haemorrhagic fever endemic to South-western part of India. The disease is caused by a virus belonging to the family \"Flaviviridae.\" KFDV is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected hard ticks (Haemaphysalis spinigera) which act as a reservoir of KFDV.\n\nThe symptoms of the disease include a high fever with frontal headaches, chills, Severe muscle pain with vomiting, gastrointestinal symptoms and bleeding problems may occur 3–4 days after initial symptom onset. Patients may experience abnormally low blood pressure, and low platelet, red blood cell, and white blood cell count. After 1–2 weeks of symptoms, some patients recover without complication, However, the illness is biphasic for a subset of patients (10-20%) who experience a second wave of symptoms at the beginning of the third week. These symptoms include fever and signs of neurological manifestations, such as severe headache, mental disturbances, tremors, and vision deficits. The convalescent period is typically very long, lasting for several months. Muscle aches and weakness also occur during this period and the affected person is unable to engage in physical activities.\n\nThe KFD virus is a typical flavivirus measuring about 40-60 nm in diameter. The genome of KFDV consists of 10,774 nucleotides of single-stranded, positive-sense RNAencoding a single polyprotein that is cleaved post-translationally into three structural (C, prM/M and E) and seven non-structural (NS1, NS2a, NS2b, NS3, NS4a, NS4b and NS5) proteins. The genome of KFDV is very similar (>92% homologous) to that of Alkhurma Hemorrhagic Fever Virus which is primarily found in Saudi Arabia. These two species both belong to the family \"Flaviviridae\" and diverged over 700 years ago and have thus remained geographically separated.\n\nA variety of animals are thought to be reservoir hosts for the disease, including porcupines, rats, squirrels, mice, and shrews. Monkeys are the main amplifying hosts for KFD virus and they are also sufferers. Langur-presbytis entellus and Bonnet monkey-Macaca radiata are very susceptible to the KFD virus.They develop tremendous viremia and infect the ticks. The vector for disease transmission is \"Haemaphysalis spinigera\", a forest tick. Humans contract infection from the bite of nymphs of the tick. Man is a terminal host and there no man to man transmission because the domestic environment cannot sustain the ticks.\n\nThe pathogenesis of KFDV is not completely understood. Research using mice models found that KFDV primarily replicated in the brain. Other research has expanded on this by described neurological changes that occurred within infected organisms. This experiment was completed by using KFDV-infected mice and discovered that KFDV caused gliosis, inflammation, and cell death in the brain. They posited that KFDV could be primarily a neuropathic disease and other symptoms are due to this pathogenesis.\n\nIn earlier days suspected case were confirmed in a laboratory by serum inoculation into suckling mice(Swiss Albino mice) and subsequent death of mice was leveled as KFD Positive case. Other methods of diagnosis included hemagglutination inhibition (HI), complement fixation, neutralization tests. However, new research has introduced more efficient molecular based methods to diagnose KFDV. These methods include: RT-PCR, nested RT-PCR, TaqMan-based real-time RT-PCR, Immunoglobin M antibodies and Immunoglobin G detection by ELISA. The two methods involving RT-PCR are able to function by attaching a primer to the NS-5 gene, which is highly conserved among the genus to which KFDV belongs. PCR positivity is limited to 8–10 days from the onset of symptoms. The ELISA based methods allows for the detections of anti-KFDV antibodies in patients typically from 5th day of onset of symptoms upto 3 months.\n\nPrevention is by vaccination, as well as preventive measures such as protective clothing and tick population control. The vaccine for KFDV consists of formalin-inactivated KFDV. The vaccine has a 62.4% effectiveness rate for individuals who receive two doses. For individuals who receive an additional dose, the effectiveness increases to 82.9%. Specific treatments are not available.\n\nThe spill-over of Kyasanur forest disease happens at the crossroads of the animal-human interaction, especially villages adjoining forest areas and inter-state borders. People who frequently visit the forest areas of the Western Ghats region such as forest guards and officials, range forest officer (RFO), forest watchers, shepherds, firewood collectors, dry leaf collectors, hunters, people who handle dead animal carcasses,  travelers who camp in the forest areas, tribal communities living inside the forest areas (Jenu kurubas and Betta kurubas), cashew nut workers especially those who engage in cleaning the dry leaves before the harvest season (seen in Pali and Mauxi outbreaks, North Goa), and areca nut farm workers working in infected tick areas will have a high risk of acquiring KFD infection. People who live in the KFD endemic areas and refuse to take KFD vaccination are at risk in contracting the infection.\n\nThe disease was first reported from Kyasanur Forest of Karnataka in India in March 1957. The disease first manifested as an epizootic outbreak among monkeys, killing several of them in the year 1957. Hence the disease is also locally known as \"monkey disease\" or \"monkey fever\". The similarity with Russian spring-summer encephalitis was noted and the possibility of migratory birds carrying the disease was raised. Studies began to look for the possible species that acted as reservoirs for the virus and the agents responsible for transmission. Subsequent studies failed to find any involvement of migratory birds, although the possibility of their role in initial establishment was not ruled out. The virus was found to be quite distinctive and not closely related to the Russian virus strains. Antigenic relatedness is, however, close to many other strains including the Omsk hemorrhagic fever (OHF) and birds from Siberia have been found to show an antigenic response to KFD virus. Sequence based studies note the distinctiveness of OHF. Early studies in India were conducted in collaboration with the US Army Medical Research Unit and this led to controversy and conspiracy theories.\n\nSubsequent studies based on sequencing found that the Alkhurma virus found in Saudi Arabia is closely related. In 1989 a patient in Nanjianin, China was found with fever symptoms and in 2009 its viral gene sequence was found to exactly match with that of the KFD reference virus of 1957. This has been questioned, though, since the Indian virus shows variations in sequence over time and the exact match with the virus sequence of 1957 and the Chinese virus of 1989 is not expected. This study also found using immune response tests that birds and humans in the region appeared to have been exposed to the virus. Another study has suggested that the virus is recent in origin dating the nearest common ancestor of it and related viruses to around 1942, based on the estimated rate of sequence substitutions. The study also raises the possibility of bird involvement in long-distance transfer. It appears that these viruses diverged 700 years ago.\n\nThe very recent outbreak, which has claimed two deaths in Siddapura, Karnataka, India. The peak season for this disease in Malnad is “March to May” but has arrived early this year in January. There are 55 positive cases reported from Shivamogga, Karnataka, but the situation is under control as described by health professionals.\n\nThe disease initially reported from Shimoga district of Karnataka which is a primitive sylvan territory in Western Ghats of India. The disease spread out to other districts of Karnataka involving districts of Chikkamagalore, Uttara Kannada, Dakshina Kannada, Udupi, Chamarajanagar (2012), Belagavi (2016). In 2013, KFDV was detected in monkey autopsies from Nilgiris district of Tamil Nadu state. Monkey deaths and human cases have now been reported from three neighbouring states bordering Karnataka, i.e., Wayanad (2013) and Malappuram districts of Kerala (2014), North Goa district of Goa state (2015), and Sindhudurg district of Maharashtra (2016).\n\nThere are reported serological evidence for KFD detected in humans in other parts of India, namely Kutch and Saurashtra regions of Gujarat state, Kingaon and Parbatpur of West Bengal state. A seroprevalence study in Andaman and Nicobar islands in 2002 revealed a high prevalence of hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibodies against KFDV. Also, earlier KFDV variant was isolated from Saudi Arabia and China .\n\nThe disease has a fatality rate of 3-10%, and it affects 400-500 people annually.\n\nThe disease was first noted at Kyasanur village near Sagar in Shivamogga district of Karnataka. The virus has been detected in monkeys in parts of Bandipur National Park (Chamarajnagar) and parts of the Nilgiris. Human infection occurred in Bandipur through handling of dead monkeys that were infected. A human carrier was also detected in Wayanad (Kerala). The disease has shown its presence in the adjacent states of Karnataka including Kerala, Maharashtra, Goa, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat.\n"}

Hindoo was sired by Virgil (sire of the Kentucky Derby winners, Vagrant and Ben Ali). His dam, Florence, was by the great racehorse and sire Lexington. He was a brother to Florida, who was the dam of the very good racemare Firenze, who won 47 of her 82 starts.\n\nHe was trained by future Hall of Fame inductee Edward D. Brown. Hindoo was sold for $15,000 during his two-year-old season to the Dwyer Brothers Stable of Mike and Phil Dwyer, and his training was taken over by another future Hall of Fame inductee, James G.

Examples include optical microscopy, spectroscopy, endoscopy, scanning laser ophthalmoscopy, laser Doppler imaging, and optical coherence tomography. Because light is an electromagnetic wave, similar phenomena occur in X-rays, microwaves, and radio waves.\n\nOptical imaging systems may be divided into diffusive and ballistic imaging systems.\n\nDiffuse optical imaging (DOI) is a method of imaging using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) or fluorescence-based methods.\nWhen used to create 3D volumetric models of the imaged material DOI is referred to as diffuse optical tomography, whereas 2D imaging methods are classified as diffuse optical topography.\n\nThe technique has many applications to neuroscience, sports medicine, wound monitoring, and cancer detection. Typically DOI techniques monitor changes in concentrations of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin and may additionally measure redox states of cytochromes. The technique may also be referred to as diffuse optical tomography (DOT), near infrared optical tomography (NIROT) or fluorescence diffuse optical tomography (FDOT), depending on the usage.\n\nIn neuroscience, functional measurements made using NIR wavelengths, DOI techniques may classify as functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS).\n\nBallistic photons are the light photons that travel through a scattering (turbid) medium in a straight line. Also known as ballistic light. If laser pulses are sent through a turbid medium such as fog or body tissue, most of the photons are either randomly scattered or absorbed. However, across short distances, a few photons pass through the scattering medium in straight lines. These coherent photons are referred to as ballistic photons. Photons that are slightly scattered, retaining some degree of coherence, are referred to as \"snake\" photons.\n\nIf efficiently detected, there are many applications for ballistic photons especially in coherent high resolution medical imaging systems. Ballistic scanners (using ultrafast time gates) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) (using the interferometry principle) are just two of the popular imaging systems that rely on ballistic photon detection to create diffraction-limited images. Advantages over other existing imaging modalities (e.g., ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging) is that ballistic imaging can achieve a higher resolution in the order of 1 to 10 micro-meters, however it suffers from limited imaging depth. Furthermore, more scattered 'quasi-ballistic' photons are often measured as well to increase the signal 'strength' (i.e., signal-to-noise ratio).\n\nDue to the exponential reduction (with respect to distance) of ballistic photons in a scattering medium, often image processing techniques are applied to the raw captured ballistic images, to reconstruct high quality ones. Ballistic imaging modalities aim to reject non-ballistic photons and retain ballistic photons that carry useful information. To perform this task, specific characteristics of ballistic photons vs. non-ballistic photons are used, such as \"time of flight\" through coherence gated imaging, collimation, wavefront propagation, and polarization.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1929509", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1929509", "title": "Fashion District Philadelphia", "text": "Fashion District Philadelphia\n\nFashion District Philadelphia is a shopping mall in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States, located in Center City along Market Street. It opened in 2019 on the site of a previous mall known as the Gallery at Market East. The area was originally planned to be an outlet mall to be called \"Fashion Outlets of Philadelphia\", but the plans were later changed to be a new \"retail district\" consisting of clothing stores and a movie theater. The new mall opened on September 19, 2019. Planners envisioned that Philadelphia, as the sixth largest city, did not have a major retail center when even compared with Kansas City, the 37th largest city. The mall was envisioned to fill that \"void\" that even smaller cities have, to sell items to the Center City market that had previously only been available elsewhere. Many of the new retailers planning to open have never had a presence in Center City before. The Fashion District Philadelphia currently has Burlington, Century 21, AMC Theatres, and Round One Entertainment as anchors.\n\nPrior to the Fashion District Philadelphia, the space was called The Gallery at Market East and was opened in 1977. It was later expanded as Galleries I and II in the early 1980s. The Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust (PREIT) acquired Gallery I in April 2003 from The Rouse Company and Gallery II in the third fiscal quarter of 2004 from the state's Public School Employees' Retirement System. The total complex measures approximately of retail space and at its peak had over 130 stores.\n\nFormerly, the space was anchored by Strawbridge's department store at 8th Street. It is also the main entrance for SEPTA's Jefferson Station at 11th and 12th Streets. The mall also provides access to an underground concourse that connects to the Market-Frankford Line at its 8th and 11th street stations.\n\nIn September 2008, the developers of Foxwoods Casino Philadelphia changed their proposed casino location to The Gallery at Market East after receiving opposition from residents near the original proposed site in South Philadelphia. The new proposal was endorsed by both Mayor Michael Nutter and Governor Ed Rendell. The original proposal for the Foxwoods Casino at The Gallery at Market East was for a 3,000-slot-machine casino on two floors that were occupied by Burlington, which would have forced that store to relocate. However, on February 26, 2009, it was announced that the developers of the Foxwoods Casino were looking to locate their new casino on three floors of the former Strawbridge's.\n\nIn January 2014, it was announced that Kmart would be closing its Gallery store in late April. There are plans to turn the former Kmart space into multiple street-facing stores centered on an atrium and to redevelop the mostly-vacant top level of the mall. It was announced in April 2014 that Century 21 would open an anchor store at the mall. In July 2014, Macerich acquired a 50% stake in The Gallery at Market East and invested $106.8 million to redevelop the mall in a joint venture with PREIT. many stores in The Gallery, including most restaurant concessions, have closed in preparation for the renovation.\n\nAs of June 19, 2015, the $325 million remodeling of \"The Gallery\" had been officially approved by the city council, and the legislation had been approved by Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter. Demolition started in August 2015, with construction expected to last two years and a grand opening sometime in 2017. According to the website for the Fashions Outlets of Philadelphia, the Burlington and Century 21 anchor stores will remain open during reconstruction.\n\nIn August 2017, the developers announced that outlets plan has been abandoned and the mall will instead feature a mix of retail, entertainment, and dining venues, much to that of a traditional shopping mall. The mall will effectively be renamed Fashion District Philadelphia. It was initially slated to reopen in the spring of 2018. However, the decision to move Burlington and add an AMC Theatres multiplex led PREIT to delay opening most of the revamped complex until 2019. \n\nThe grand opening for Fashion District Philadelphia took place on September 19, 2019, with a ribbon-cutting ceremony held. The AMC Dine-In Fashion District 8 dine-in movie theater opened on November 4, 2019. The opening of this movie theater marked the first time since 2002 that Center City Philadelphia had a multi-screen movie theater; Philadelphia had previously been the only major city in the United States without a multi-screen movie theater in the downtown area. On December 21, 2019, a Round One Entertainment bowling and entertainment center opened at Fashion District Philadelphia.\n\nIn October 2019, it was announced that Primark will open a store at Fashion District Philadelphia at the corner of 11th and Market streets. The store is expected to open by 2021.\n\nThe following rail stations are connected to Fashion District Philadelphia\n\nBesides the SEPTA rail connections, various SEPTA city bus routes and NJ Transit bus routes have stops next to Fashion District Philadelphia.

The event was sponsored by the Association of Iron and Steel Electrical Engineers. The approximately 200 attendees, representing industry and government, resolved to “organize and create a permanent body for the promotion of the safety to human life in the industries of the United States.\n\nAt the Second Safety Congress in 1913, the National Council for Industrial Safety was established. It was headquartered in Chicago, Illinois and Robert W. Campbell served as first president and William H. Cameron served as secretary.\nThe name was changed to National Safety Council in 1914, to reflect the organization's expanded scope to include traffic and home safety. As membership increased, the NSC began producing posters, technical fact sheets, and other publications.\nIn 1953, the U.S. Congress and President Dwight D. Eisenhower recognized the importance of the NSC’s efforts with a Congressional charter to: “…arouse and maintain the interest of the people of the United States… in safety and in accident prevention, and to encourage the adoption and institution of safety methods by all persons, corporations, and other organizations.\"\n\n\nNSC is governed by a Board of Directors and a Board of Delegates. The Board of Directors manages fiduciary and strategic affairs. The Board of Delegates develops the mission agenda, creates public policies, and tracks safety, health and environmental trends. More than 2,000 volunteers, drawn from NSC industry volunteer divisions, assist the boards in determining policies, operating procedures and programs to be developed and implemented by the Council’s professional staff.\n\nThe National Safety Council’s network of 21 local chapters conducts safety, health and environmental efforts at the community level, providing training, conferences, workshops, consultation, newsletters, updates and safety support materials, as well as networking avenues.\n\nMembers of NSC are segmented into Divisions, also known as special interest groups. Division members plan and create programs for the annual NSC Congress & Expo, and participate in discussions of research findings, new concepts, trends, and ideas for safety challenges. Divisions meet twice a year. The divisions are Business & Industry, Construction, Highway Traffic Safety, Labor, Motor Transportation, and Utilities. Some divisions are further segmented into sections.\n\nHeld each fall, the NSC Congress & Expo attracts between 15,000-18,000 safety and health professionals, plus industry suppliers from several countries. The event promotes safety and health products and services, and new safety technologies and training methods. Members attending the annual Congress can also earn continuing education credits by participating in technical sessions and professional development seminars.\n\nIn 1996 NSC established June as National Safety Month, aiming to increase awareness of the leading safety and health risks and ultimately decrease the number of unintentional injuries and deaths. Each week focuses on a specific safety venue: workplace, traffic, home, and community.\n\n\n"}

He played nine seasons with the Edmonton Oilers and almost six seasons with the Anaheim Ducks, along with just over a season with the Columbus Blue Jackets and a game with the New York Rangers. He also played 49 games in the American Hockey League (AHL) between his time with the Binghamton Rangers and Cape Breton Oilers.\n\nMarchant played high school hockey at Williamsville East High School. He then played two years in the NCAA with Clarkson University, from 1991–1993. He was drafted by the Rangers in the 1993 NHL Entry Draft in the seventh round, 164th overall. In 1993–94, his first pro season, he played games with the Rangers, their AHL affiliate in Binghamton. He was acquired by the Oilers in a trade for Craig MacTavish and continued play with their affiliate in Cape Breton (and in his last couple of seasons with the Oilers, had the distinction of being one of the few NHL players to be coached by an ex-player for whom he was once traded).\n\nMarchant played nine full seasons as an Oiler (1994–2003), serving as an alternate captain for his last few seasons in Edmonton. He was known as one of the fastest players in the NHL, and used his speed mostly in a defensive capacity. He scored the first round Game 7 overtime goal that eliminated the Dallas Stars from the 1997 playoffs, taking a pass from alternate captain Doug Weight and speeding by a stumbling Grant Ledyard to score on Andy Moog. Marchant would go on to lead all players in shorthanded goals in the 1997 playoffs, with 3. In doing so, he became the first player in 8 years to score 3 shorthanded goals in the playoffs. The last player to do it was Chicago Blackhawks forward Wayne Presley in 1989.\n\nIn the summer of 2003, Marchant was signed by the Blue Jackets after he gained early unrestricted free agency from the Oilers. He played the full 2003–04 season with Columbus, along with fellow ex-Oilers Tyler Wright and Luke Richardson.\n\nMarchant then refused to waive his no trade clause, which would have allowed Columbus to send him to Anaheim as part of the Sergei Fedorov trade. After trading for Fedorov, Columbus placed Marchant on waivers in order to free up some salary cap space (as Marchant makes $2.5 Million/Year). Anaheim picked Marchant up on waivers on November 21, 2005 to make him a Mighty Duck.\n\nMarchant played with the Mighty Ducks in the last half of the 2005–06 NHL Season. Marchant and the Ducks advanced all the way to the Western Conference Finals but were eliminated by Marchant's former team, the Edmonton Oilers.\n\nHe returned to the roster of the newly named Anaheim Ducks for the 2006–07 NHL season. The season began as a record-breaking year, with the Ducks setting franchise records and also setting a league-wide record for the longest streak of being undefeated in regulation at the beginning of the season.\n\nMarchant was injured halfway through the year, missing over 20 games. He did not return to play in good condition until the Ducks were midway through the 2007 NHL Playoffs. Marchant returned in the series against the Detroit Red Wings in the Conference Final, and played a vital role in killing penalties. Marchant went on to win his first Stanley Cup when the Ducks defeated the Ottawa Senators in the 2007 Stanley Cup Finals.\n\nThe Ducks were eliminated in the first round of the 2008 Stanley Cup Playoffs by the Dallas Stars, a series in which Marchant scored twice. He contributed 5 goals during the 2008-09 NHL Season as the Ducks entered the playoffs as the last seed and upset the first seed San Jose Sharks. Marchant scored the game-winning goal in triple overtime in Game 2 of the Ducks second round series with the Detroit Red Wings, a series Detroit would ultimately win in seven games.\n\nMarchant announced his retirement after 17 seasons in the NHL on June 29, 2011.

Solar neutrinos constitute by far the largest flux of neutrinos from natural sources observed on Earth, as compared with e.g. atmospheric neutrinos or the diffuse supernova neutrino background.\n\nSolar neutrinos are produced in the core of the Sun through various nuclear fusion reactions, each of which occurs at a particular rate and leads to its own spectrum of neutrino energies. Details of the more prominent of these reactions are described below.\n\nThe main contribution comes from the proton-proton reaction. The reaction is:\n\nor in words:\n\nOf all Solar neutrinos, 86% are produced from this reaction. As shown in the figure titled \"Solar neutrinos (proton-proton chain) in the Standard Solar Model\", the deuteron will fuse with another proton to create a He nucleus and a gamma ray. This reaction can be seen as:\n\nThe isotope He can be produced by using the He in the previous reaction which is seen below.\n\nWith both helium-3 and helium-4 now in the environment, one of each weight of helium nucleus can fuse to produce beryllium:\n\nBeryllium-7 can follow two different paths from this stage: It could capture an electron and produce the more stable lithium-7 nucleus and an electron neutrino, or alternatively, it could capture one of the abundant protons, which would create boron-8. The first reaction via lithium-7 is:\n\nThis lithium-yielding reaction produces 14% of the solar neutrinos. The resulting lithium-7 later combines with a proton to produce two nuclei of helium-4. The alternative reaction is proton capture, that produces boron-8, which then beta decays into beryllium-8 as shown below:\n\nThis alternative boron-yielding reaction produces about 0.02% of the solar neutrinos; although so few that they would conventionally be neglected, these rare solar neutrinos stand out because of their higher average energies. The asterisk (*) on the beryllium-8 nucleus indicates that it is in an excited, unstable state. The excited beryllium-8 nucleus then splits into two helium-4 nuclei:\n\nThe highest flux of solar neutrinos come directly from the proton-proton interaction, and have a low energy, up to 400 keV. There are also several other significant production mechanisms, with energies up to 18 MeV. From the Earth, the amount of neutrino flux at Earth is around 7·10 particles·cm·s . The number of neutrinos can be predicted with great confidence by the Standard Solar Model. However, the number of electron neutrinos detected on Earth was only of the predicted number, and this was known as the “solar neutrino problem”.\n\nThe absence of electron neutrinos, and the fact that it is one of three known types of neutrino, eventually prompted the idea of neutrino oscillation and the fact that neutrinos can change flavour. This was confirmed when the total flux of solar neutrinos of all types was measured and it agreed with the earlier predictions of the expected flux of only electron neutrinos, as seen by Sudbury Neutrino Observatory. The fact that the electron neutrinos could spontaneously change in flight through empty space also confirmed that neutrinos must have mass. Solar models additionally predict the location within the Sun's core where solar neutrinos should originate from, depending on the nuclear fusion reaction which leads to their production. Future neutrino detectors will be able to detect the incoming direction of these neutrinos with enough precision to measure this effect.\nThe energy spectrum of solar neutrinos is also predicted by solar models. It is essential to know this energy spectrum because different neutrino detection experiments are sensitive to different neutrino energy ranges. The Homestake Experiment used chlorine and was most sensitive to solar neutrinos produced by the decay of the beryllium isotope Be. The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory is most sensitive to solar neutrinos produced by B. The detectors that use gallium are most sensitive to the solar neutrinos produced by the proton-proton chain reaction process, however they were not able to observe this contribution separately. The observation of the neutrinos from the basic reaction of this chain, proton-proton fusion in deuterium, was achieved for the first time by Borexino in 2014. In 2012 the same collaboration reported detecting low-energy neutrinos for the proton-electron-proton (pep reaction) that produces 1 in 400 deuterium nuclei in the sun. The detector contained 100 metric tons of liquid and saw on average 3 events each day (due to C production) from this relatively uncommon thermonuclear reaction.\n\nNote that Borexino measured neutrinos of several energies; in this manner they have demonstrated experimentally, for the first time, the pattern of solar neutrino oscillations predicted by the theory. Neutrinos can trigger nuclear reactions. By looking at ancient ores of various ages that have been exposed to solar neutrinos over geologic time, it may be possible to interrogate the luminosity of the Sun over time, which, according to the Standard Solar Model, has changed over the eons as the (presently) inert byproduct helium has accumulated in its core.\n\n"}

{"id": "1929545", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1929545", "title": "History of superconductivity", "text": "History of superconductivity\n\nSuperconductivity is the phenomenon of certain materials exhibiting zero electrical resistance and the expulsion of magnetic fields below a characteristic temperature. The history of superconductivity began with Dutch physicist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes's discovery of superconductivity in mercury in 1911. Since then, many other superconducting materials have been discovered and the theory of superconductivity has been developed. These subjects remain active areas of study in the field of condensed matter physics.\n\nJames Dewar initiated research into electrical resistance at low temperatures. Dewar and John Ambrose Fleming predicted that at absolute zero, pure metals would become perfect electromagnetic conductors (though, later, Dewar altered his opinion on the disappearance of resistance, believing that there would always be some resistance). Walther Hermann Nernst developed the third law of thermodynamics and stated that absolute zero was unattainable. Carl von Linde and William Hampson, both commercial researchers, nearly at the same time filed for patents on the Joule–Thomson effect for the liquefaction of gases. Linde's patent was the climax of 20 years of systematic investigation of established facts, using a regenerative counterflow method. Hampson's designs was also of a regenerative method. The combined process became known as the Hampson–Linde liquefaction process.\n\nOnnes purchased a Linde machine for his research. On March 21, 1900, Nikola Tesla was granted a patent for the means for increasing the intensity of electrical oscillations by lowering the temperature, which was caused by lowered resistance. Within this patent it describes the increased intensity and duration of electric oscillations of a low temperature resonating circuit. It is believed that Tesla had intended that Linde's machine would be used to attain the cooling agents.\n\nA milestone was achieved on July 10, 1908 when Heike Kamerlingh Onnes at Leiden University in the Netherlands produced, for the first time, liquified helium, which has a boiling point of 4.2 kelvins at atmospheric pressure.\n\nHeike Kamerlingh Onnes and Jacob Clay reinvestigated Dewar's earlier experiments on the reduction of resistance at low temperatures. Onnes began the investigations with platinum and gold, replacing these later with mercury (a more readily refinable material). Onnes's research into the resistivity of solid mercury at cryogenic temperatures was accomplished by using liquid helium as a refrigerant. On April 8, 1911, 16:00 hours Onnes noted \"Kwik nagenoeg nul\", which translates as \"[Resistance of] mercury almost zero.\" At the temperature of 4.19 K, he observed that the resistivity abruptly disappeared (the measuring device Onnes was using did not indicate any resistance). Onnes disclosed his research in 1911, in a paper titled \"\"On the Sudden Rate at Which the Resistance of Mercury Disappears.\"\" Onnes stated in that paper that the \"specific resistance\" became thousands of times less in amount relative to the best conductor at ordinary temperature. Onnes later reversed the process and found that at 4.2 K, the resistance returned to the material. The next year, Onnes published more articles about the phenomenon. Initially, Onnes called the phenomenon \"\"supraconductivity\"\" (1913) and, only later, adopted the term \"\"superconductivity.\"\" For his research, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1913.\n\nOnnes conducted an experiment, in 1912, on the usability of superconductivity. Onnes introduced an electric current into a superconductive ring and removed the battery that generated it. Upon measuring the electric current, Onnes found that its intensity did not diminish with the time. The current persisted due to the superconductive state of the conductive medium. \n\nIn subsequent decades, superconductivity was found in several other materials; In 1913, lead at 7 K, in 1930's niobium at 10 K, and in 1941 niobium nitride at 16 K.\n\nThe next important step in understanding superconductivity occurred in 1933, when Walther Meissner and Robert Ochsenfeld discovered that superconductors expelled applied magnetic fields, a phenomenon that has come to be known as the Meissner effect. In 1935, brothers Fritz London and Heinz London showed that the Meissner effect was a consequence of the minimization of the electromagnetic free energy carried by superconducting current. In 1950, the phenomenological Ginzburg–Landau theory of superconductivity was devised by Lev Landau and Vitaly Ginzburg.\n\nThe Ginzburg–Landau theory, which combined Landau's theory of second-order phase transitions with a Schrödinger-like wave equation, had great success in explaining the macroscopic properties of superconductors. In particular, Alexei Abrikosov showed that Ginzburg–Landau theory predicts the division of superconductors into the two categories now referred to as Type I and Type II. Abrikosov and Ginzburg were awarded the 2003 Nobel Prize in Physics for their work (Landau having died in 1968). Also in 1950, Emanuel Maxwell and, almost simultaneously, C.A. Reynolds \"et al.\" found that the critical temperature of a superconductor depends on the isotopic mass of the constituent element. This important discovery pointed to the electron-phonon interaction as the microscopic mechanism responsible for superconductivity.\n\nThe complete microscopic theory of superconductivity was finally proposed in 1957 by John Bardeen, Leon N. Cooper, and Robert Schrieffer. This BCS theory explained the superconducting current as a superfluid of Cooper pairs, pairs of electrons interacting through the exchange of phonons. For this work, the authors were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1972. The BCS theory was set on a firmer footing in 1958, when Nikolay Bogolyubov showed that the BCS wavefunction, which had originally been derived from a variational argument, could be obtained using a canonical transformation of the electronic Hamiltonian. In 1959, Lev Gor'kov showed that the BCS theory reduced to the Ginzburg-Landau theory close to the critical temperature. Gor'kov was the first to derive the superconducting phase evolution equation formula_1.\n\nThe Little–Parks effect was discovered in 1962 in experiments with empty and thin-walled superconducting cylinders subjected to a parallel magnetic field. The electrical resistance of such cylinders shows a periodic oscillation with the magnetic flux through the cylinder, the period being \"h\"/2\"e\" = 2.07×10 V·s. The explanation provided by William Little and Ronald Parks is that the resistance oscillation reflects a more fundamental phenomenon, i.e. periodic oscillation of the superconducting critical temperature (\"T\"). This is the temperature at which the sample becomes superconducting. The Little-Parks effect is a result of collective quantum behavior of superconducting electrons. It reflects the general fact that it is the fluxoid rather than the flux which is quantized in superconductors. The Little-Parks effect demonstrates that the vector potential couples to an observable physical quantity, namely the superconducting critical temperature.\n\nSoon after discovering superconductivity in 1911, Kamerlingh Onnes attempted to make an electromagnet with superconducting windings but found that relatively low magnetic fields destroyed superconductivity in the materials he investigated. Much later, in 1955, George Yntema succeeded in constructing a small 0.7-tesla iron-core electromagnet with superconducting niobium wire windings. Then, in 1961, J. E. Kunzler, E. Buehler, F. S. L. Hsu, and J. H. Wernick made the startling discovery that at 4.2 kelvins, a compound consisting of three parts niobium and one part tin was capable of supporting a current density of more than 100,000 amperes per square centimeter in a magnetic field of 8.8 tesla. Despite being brittle and difficult to fabricate, niobium-tin has since proved extremely useful in supermagnets generating magnetic fields as high as 20 teslas. In 1962, Ted Berlincourt and Richard Hake discovered that less brittle alloys of niobium and titanium are suitable for applications up to 10 teslas. Promptly thereafter, commercial production of niobium-titanium supermagnet wire commenced at Westinghouse Electric Corporation and at Wah Chang Corporation. Although niobium-titanium boasts less-impressive superconducting properties than those of niobium-tin, niobium-titanium has, nevertheless, become the most widely used “workhorse” supermagnet material, in large measure a consequence of its very high ductility and ease of fabrication. However, both niobium-tin and niobium-titanium find wide application in MRI medical imagers, bending and focusing magnets for enormous high-energy particle accelerators, and a host of other applications. Conectus, a European consortium for superconductivity, estimated that in 2014, global economic activity, for which superconductivity was indispensable, amounted to about five billion euros, with MRI systems accounting for about 80% of that total.\n\nIn 1962, Brian Josephson made the important theoretical prediction that a supercurrent can flow between two pieces of superconductor separated by a thin layer of insulator. This phenomenon, now called the Josephson effect, is exploited by superconducting devices such as SQUIDs. It is used in the most accurate available measurements of the magnetic flux quantum \"h\"/2\"e\", and thus (coupled with the quantum Hall resistivity) for Planck's constant \"h\". Josephson was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for this work in 1973.\n\nIn 1973 found to have \"T\" of 23 K, which remained the highest ambient-pressure \"T\" until the discovery of the cuprate high-temperature superconductors in 1986 (see below).\n\nIn 1986, J. Georg Bednorz and K. Alex Mueller discovered superconductivity in a lanthanum-based cuprate perovskite material, which had a transition temperature of 35 K (Nobel Prize in Physics, 1987) and was the first of the high-temperature superconductors. It was shortly found (by Ching-Wu Chu) that replacing the lanthanum with yttrium, i.e. making YBCO, raised the critical temperature to 92 K, which was important because liquid nitrogen could then be used as a refrigerant (at atmospheric pressure, the boiling point of nitrogen is 77 K). This is important commercially because liquid nitrogen can be produced cheaply on-site with no raw materials, and is not prone to some of the problems (solid air plugs, etc.) of helium in piping. Many other cuprate superconductors have since been discovered, and the theory of superconductivity in these materials is one of the major outstanding challenges of theoretical condensed-matter physics.\n\nIn March 2001, superconductivity of magnesium diboride () was found with \"T\" = 39 K.\n\nIn 2008, the oxypnictide or iron-based superconductors were discovered, which led to a flurry of work in the hope that studying them would provide a theory of the cuprate superconductors.\n\nIn 2013, room-temperature superconductivity was attained in YBCO for picoseconds, using short pulses of infrared laser light to deform the material's crystal structure.\n\nIn 2017 it was suggested that undiscovered superhard materials (e.g. critically doped beta-titanium Au) might be a candidate for a new superconductor with Tc, substantially higher than HgBaCuO (138 K), possibly up to 233 K, which would be higher even than HS. A lot of research suggests that additionally nickel could replace copper in some perovskites, offering another route to room temperature. Li+ doped materials can also be used, i.e. the spinel battery material LiTiO and the lattice pressure can increase Tc to over 13.8 K. Also LiHx has been theorized to metallise at a substantially lower pressure than H and could be a candidate for a Type 1 superconductor.\n\nPapers by H.K.

M. Barrie, and one of the inspirations for the boy characters in the story of Peter Pan. He served in the Royal Navy during World War I. He was the first cousin of the English writer Daphne du Maurier.\n\nDavies and his elder brother George first met the writer on their regular outings in Kensington Gardens with their nurse Mary Hodgson and infant brother Peter in 1897. They took part in play adventures with Barrie which provided much of the inspiration for the adventures in the 1904 stage play \"Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up\". Shortly before writing the play, Barrie created a photo book titled \"The Boy Castaways\", featuring the three oldest brothers pretending to be shipwrecked on an island and fighting pirates, themes that later appeared in the Peter Pan story. The character of John Darling, the older of Wendy's brothers, was named after him.\n\nIn 1906 Davies was recommended by Barrie to Captain Robert F. Scott for a position at Osborne Naval College, unlike his brothers, who all attended Eton College. Following the deaths of his parents Arthur (1907) and Sylvia (1910), Barrie became the main guardian of the five boys, supporting them financially. Jack reportedly harboured some resentment towards Barrie, at times believing the writer was trying to take his father's place (especially after his father died). He was not as close to the writer as were his brothers, especially George and Michael.\n\nJust before his mother's death, Davies became an officer in the Royal Navy, after attending the Royal Naval College at Osborne. As a regular naval officer he served in the North Atlantic during World War I. His brother George was killed in action on the Western Front in 1915. His brother Michael drowned in an apparent accident in 1921. His brothers Peter and Nico (the youngest) outlived him.\n\nHe married 19-year-old Geraldine \"Gerrie\" Gibb in 1917, without first asking permission of Barrie, who only grudgingly approved of the relationship. Nonetheless, Barrie gave the couple charge of the Davies family house, where Michael and Nico still lived during school holidays, in the care of Mary Hodgson. Friction between Gerrie and Hodgson led to the elder woman's resignation. Davies had two children: Timothy (1921-1965) and Sylvia Jocelyn (named after Davies's mother, but always known as Jane)(1924-1969).\n\nJohn Davies was appointed to the naval rank of Lieutenant Commander in 1924. Upon retirement from the Royal Navy he and Geraldine moved to a cottage in St Endellion, Northern Cornwall. During the late 1940s his brother, the publisher Peter Davies, consulted with him regarding details of a family history informally titled \"The Morgue\". \n\nJohn Davies died on 17 September 1959 at the age of 65 from lung disease, almost seven months before his brother Peter committed suicide.\n\nIn the 1978 BBC mini-series \"The Lost Boys\", he was portrayed at various ages by Nicholas Borton, Guy Hewitt, David Wilson, and Osmund Bullock.\n\nIn the 2004 film \"Finding Neverland\", he was portrayed as a child by Joe Prospero.\n"}

{"id": "1929556", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1929556", "title": "Peterborough Lift Lock", "text": "Peterborough Lift Lock\n\nThe Peterborough Lift Lock is a boat lift located on the Trent Canal in the city of Peterborough, Ontario, Canada, and is Lock 21 on the Trent-Severn Waterway.\n\nFor many years, the lock's dual lifts were the highest hydraulic boat lifts in the world, raising boats . This was a considerable accomplishment in the first years of the 20th century, when conventional locks usually only had a rise.\n\nIn the 1980s, a visitor centre was built beside the lock. It offers interactive simulations of going over the lift lock in a boat, and historical exhibits detailing the construction of the lift lock.\n\nResidents and visitors skate on the canal below the lift lock in the winter.\n\nThe Peterborough Lift Lock was designated a National Historic Site in 1979, and was named an Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in 1987.\n\nThe Trent-Severn has a similar hydraulic lift lock, the Kirkfield Lift Lock, at its summit near Kirkfield, with basins of the same dimensions, but which has a smaller vertical lift.\n\nThe lock has two identical bathtub-like ship caissons in which vessels ascend and descend. Both caissons are enclosed at each end by pivoting gates, and there are pivoting gates at the upper and lower reaches of the canal at the junctions with the caissons. The gates on the caissons fit into slots on the gates on the reaches, so that they open in unison.\n\nEach caisson sits on a diameter ram, the shafts for which are sunk into the ground, are filled with water, and are connected with a pipe that has a crossover control valve. The caissons are guided up and down on either side by rails affixed to concrete towers.\n\nThe caissons are long, wide, and deep and when filled with of water weigh .\n\nNo external power is needed: the lift lock functions by gravity alone using the counterweight principle. One caisson always ascends and the other always descends during each locking cycle. When one caisson reaches the top position, it stops below the water level of the upper reach, and the control valve is closed; Siemens ultrasonic sensors are used to help determine the differential. The upper reach and top caisson gates open, and water flows into the top caisson until the level equalizes. The weight of the extra foot of water is , making the total weight of the upper caisson . Any vessels that just ascended in the top caisson exit into the upper reach, and any new vessels making a transit of the lock then enter the bottom or top caisson from the lower or upper reach respectively. Once the vessels are secured, all gates are closed and the crossover valve in the connecting pipe between the ram shafts is opened. Since the upper caisson weighs more than the lower caisson (1,844 vs 1,700 tons), it pushes down on its ram, forcing out water from its shaft via the connecting pipe into the shaft of the bottom caisson. The force pushes up on the bottom caisson's ram, raising the caisson up to the top position. When the gate of the newly descended top caisson and lower reach gates open at the bottom, the extra foot of water flows out and equalizes with the water level in the lower reach of the canal, and any descended vessels exit, allowing the cycle to start over again.\n\nSept 6th, 2019 the right lift lock was closed following an inspection. Only the right caisson is working until further notice, taking 3.5 to go up (powered by external pump) and over 30 minutes to go down. Access is now restricted.\n\nThe lift lock was designed by Richard Birdsall Rogers, a superintendent of the Trent Canal (part of the Trent-Severn Waterway). In 1896, he travelled to France, Belgium and England to see existing examples in operation.\n\nPart of the reason that the lift lock was built was political. At the time a federal election was taking place and in order to shore up local support the project was fast tracked. In 1896 construction was approved and contractors signed on prior to any real working drawings being ready. The government still fell, and Richard Rogers, who was concerned about his links to the former administration, only released portions of the working drawings bit by bit. It worked, allowing him to remain on the job as the main designer.\n\nThe final project included many engineering firsts. It was the first lock to be built out of concrete, and at the time was the largest structure ever built in the world with unreinforced concrete.\n\nConstruction was by Corry and Laverdure of Peterborough, which excavated the site and built the concrete towers and lock, and Dominion Bridge Company of Montreal, which completed the metal work including rams, presses and large caissons, and was finished in 1904. The lift lock officially opened to the public to a crowd of thousands on 9 July 1904, and remains in full use today.\n\n\n"}

His reputation is mainly due to the novel \"Gli occhi di una donna\", which earned him the important Italian award Premio Campiello in 1985. He has a keen interest in Central Asia and Tibetan history and culture, and in recent years has travelled all of the Silk Road through Turkey, Iran, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan and many provinces of China, among which Gansu, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Qinghai and obviously Xizang (Tibet).\n\nBorn in Milan and grown up near Lake Como, he graduated from Bocconi University and then worked for sixteen years in publishing (Einaudi, Sansoni, Longanesi), as Chief Press Officer before becoming a freelance author. He has been constantly active in Anglo-American narrative, of which he is also a translator and reviewer for several dailies, weeklies and monthlies. He was a professional novelist for more than twenty years, and a publicist for more than thirty.\n\nIn 1973 he published a small collection of poems, \"Per rompere qualcosa\", followed by other poems published on various literary publications or anthologies (Il Verri, Altri termini, Pianura etc.).\n\nHe has also published fourteen novels and, more recently, three books of travel memories (see detailed lists below).\n\nTrivia: In the very first youth he also wore the Italian blue jersey of the junior and university teams of athletics, being included in the first prospective team for the Olympic Games in Rome, 1960, where unfortunately he could not participate due to injury. In 1994 he was awarded the Literary Prize of CONI, Comitato Olimpico Nazionale Italiano.\n\nBiondi has begun his travels in 1968, and in 2003 he has collected his memories in his first book of travels \"Güle Gule. Parti con un sorriso\". 35 years of voyages from New York City to Iran, through Algeria, Albania, Syria, Jordan, Turkey, Egypt. In 2004 he realized that he had unknowingly travelled most of the Silk Road, so he completed the route crossing Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan, reaching China at Kashgar through the Tien Shan (Mountains of Heaven) and from there crossing the Taklamakan Desert to Turpan (Caves of the Thousand Buddhas, Bezeklik). And in 2005 he collected his new memories in his second book of travels, \"Strada bianca per i Monti del Cielo\".\n\nBetween 2005 and 2007, Biondi has also completed \"philologically\" the Silk Road to its eastern end, represented by the ancient Chinese capitals Xi'an and Luoyang, proceeding from there to Beijing, Shanghai and Lhasa (with the famous Qingzang Railway from Xining, Qinghai). But above all visiting, in addition to Xizang (Tibet), large areas of other Tibetan Autonomous Regions in Gansu (the monasteries of the Gelugpas (Yellow Hats) in Labrang and Langmu-Si, the famous Buddha caves of Bingling-Si on the Yellow River), in Qinghai (Gelugpa complex of Kumbum, the birthplace of Tsongkhapa, monasteries of Rebkong/Tongren etc.) and in Sichuan (Great Buddha of Leshan and Mount Emei). \n\nFrom these complex experiences was born in 2008 his third book of travels, \"Con il Buddha di Alessando Magno\", long and passionate journey along the paths of the Art of Gandhara, that's to say the syncretism of the preaching of Buddha and the Hellenistic culture brought by Alexander to the Indus. A syncretism that has extended its influence to the Far East.\nIn 2008, still in China, he has visited Ningxia, the autonomous province of the Muslim Hui, but especially, again, Qinghai, divided in the two large territories of Amdo and part of Kham (Yushu-Jyekundo), respectively inhabited by Tibetans Amdowas and Khampas.\nIn 2009 he has continued the exploration of said territories, reaching in 2010 Mount Kailash, Lake Manasarovar and the remains of the ancient Kingdom of Guge, in Western Tibet. From there Biondi's travels continued to some Holy Festivals of Bhutan (Tsechu and Drupchhoe) and Nepal (Indra Jatra).\n\n\n\n\nHe has translated 71 works mostly by American and English authors, including Bernard Malamud, John Updike, Edith Wharton, Anne Tyler, Peter Carey and Nobels Isaac Bashevis Singer, William Golding, Wole Soyinka and Orhan Pamuk (from the American edition of \"Kara Kitab - The Black Book\" as expressly requested by Pamuk to his first Italian publisher, Frassinelli).\n\nMario Biondi has always had a keen interest in technology and its future expectations, as evidenced by the novels \"Una porta di luce\" (1998) and \"Codice Ombra\" (1999). Logical consequence, his interest in the Internet. Connected to a network from mid-1994, in April 1995 he created his Web site, first Italian writer to do so and perhaps also in Europe (they were still very few even in the USA). A site of service, which apart from providing information about the writer and his work - including the possibility of downloading narratives and critics -, offers some databases for the analysis of text in a variety of classics: Aeneid (in Latin), Bible, The Divine Comedy, Jerusalem Delivered, Orlando Furioso, The Betrothed (all in Italian). Using his knowledge of the world of Opera, Biondi has also created and posted on his site a powerful (and very used) Database of Opera.\n\nA semi-professional hobby, strictly connected to the passion for travel that has always animated Biondi, who has posted on the Net many more than 5000 photos taken since 1968 in Italy - Algeria - Turkey - United States - Cuba - Syria - Yugoslavia - Albania - Iran - Uzbekistan - Kyrgyzstan - Pakistan - China - Nepal - Bhutan, freely visible in the proper spaces on his Web Site.\n\n Biondi has always cultivated a deep interest in Opera, and over the years has accumulated thousands of recordings, creating a simple but very informed Database of Opera with data about more than 1700 titles of operas by some 600 composers in more than 5000 recordings. (Who has directed, who played, who has sung (and with whom), when, where, how ...

His primary position was in centre midfield, though he was also an able right winger and full back.\n\nDuring his career, McAteer played for five professional clubs, Bolton Wanderers, Liverpool, Blackburn Rovers, Sunderland and finally Tranmere Rovers, as well as winning over 50 international caps for the Republic of Ireland. His total transfer values reach over £9 million. He announced his retirement from professional football on 12 June 2007.\n\nMcAteer got his big break aged 20, at local non-league team Marine, when impressing for Marine Reserves against the Bolton Wanderers A team in 1992. He had no contract with Marine, and Bolton purchased the young midfielder for £500 plus a large bag of footballs. He made his first team debut against Burnley in a Division Two game at Burnden Park on 28 November 1992, finishing on the winning side in a 4–0 triumph. He made a total of 21 appearances in the 1992–93 season for Bolton, who finished the season as runners-up and secured promotion to Division One. Bolton were FA Cup quarter-finalists in the 1993–94 season and achieved a comfortable position in Division One, but it was the 1994–95 season which proved most memorable, as Bolton reached the final of the Football League Cup (their first appearance in a major cup final for 37 years), but lost 2–1 to Liverpool.\n\nMcAteer and his colleagues returned to Wembley the following month on 29 May 1995, as they reached the final of the Division One playoffs having finished third in the league. Their opponents on this occasion were Reading. In an epic contest, Reading took a 2–0 lead in the first half and led the match until the 86th minute when Bolton scored a late equaliser to make the game 2–2 and force extra-time. Bolton went on to win the match 4–3 after extra time and McAteer was given his first chance of FA Premier League football.\n\nEarly in the 1995–96 season, Liverpool captured the midfielder in a £4.5 million deal after he played against them in the 1995 Football League Cup Final for Bolton. McAteer came close to joining Blackburn Rovers in 1995, but when Liverpool declared an interest, McAteer decided to sign for the team he had supported as a boy. He appeared 139 times for Liverpool and scored 6 goals for the Reds.\n\nDuring his time at Anfield, McAteer also filled in at right back for certain spells despite being primarily a central midfielder. He broke his leg whilst playing against Blackburn Rovers at Anfield. He made a full recovery and on his return to the first team scored two goals dedicated to his close friend Rob Bond, against West Ham United. He also played in the 1996 FA Cup Final against Manchester United in which Liverpool lost to a single goal scored by Eric Cantona.\n\nTowards the end of the 1998–99 season, Blackburn Rovers manager Brian Kidd signed McAteer for £4 million. Rovers were relegated that season, but McAteer would help the club to promotion back to the Premiership in 2001 during his second full season with the club. During his time with Rovers, McAteer had a vicious argument one day with Blackburn's manager Graeme Souness. McAteer later said of Souness: \"He almost ruined my career and I cannot help but despise him for it.\"\n\nSouness sold McAteer to Sunderland for £1 million. He made 27 appearances that season, but was unable to prevent the Black Cats' relegation to the First Division in 2002–03. McAteer remained at the Stadium of Light for another year, playing in both legs of the play-off semi-final against Crystal Palace before being released at the end of the year. McAteer missed time during the season after suffering a broken nose in a clash with Manchester United's Roy Keane; the beginnings of which are likely to have been critical comments made by McAteer of Keane after the Saipan Incident at the 2002 World Cup.\n\nMcAteer had said of Keane: \"Everything is black or white with Roy, there is no such colour as grey. I do not always understand his rage.\" McAteer said that when they clashed during Sunderland's match against Manchester United, he had said to Keane: \"Put it all in your next book\". Keane responded by elbowing McAteer on the side of the head.\n\nAfter being left without a club for the majority of the close season in 2004, McAteer then made the decision to head back to Birkenhead, signing a two-year deal with Tranmere Rovers, hoping to play out his career with his hometown club. He trained as a coach ready to embark on a career in that department after his retirement. He was made club captain by manager Brian Little, skippering the side to the League One play-off semi-finals, where they eventually lost on penalties to Hartlepool United.\n\nHe was released by Tranmere Rovers in May 2007 and announced his retirement shortly afterwards. His domestic successes include winning two promotions and reaching a League Cup final in three seasons with Bolton, reaching an FA Cup final with Liverpool and winning promotion to the Premiership with Blackburn.\n\nMcAteer played 52 times for Republic of Ireland (ROI) between 1994 and 2004. He made his debut for ROI on 23 March 1994 against Russia in a friendly match at Lansdowne Road and was selected by manager Jack Charlton for the Republic's 1994 World Cup squad. McAteer came on as a substitute in ROI's famous 1–0 World Cup victory over Italy.\n\nMcAteer played in his second World Cup for the Republic of Ireland in 2002. He scored the decisive goal for the Irish in a crucial 1–0 World Cup qualifying win against the Netherlands in September 2001, which helped ROI stay on course for their place in the 2002 World Cup.\n\nMcAteer has regularly appeared for the Liverpool legends who play in various charity games around the world. In 2005, with the help of friends, McAteer organised \"Tsunami Soccer Aid\" which generated over half a million pounds. This was used by Save The Children, Merlin and other charities to help rebuild the worst affected areas of the disaster.\n\nIn April 2011, while participating in a charity football match between Darndale F.C. and Liverpool/Manchester United Legends in aid of Autism Ireland, McAteer clashed with Dublin GAA Goalkeeper Stephen Cluxton. Cluxton punched McAteer and knocked him to the ground. Cluxton and McAteer were both sent off.\n\nMcAteer now works in the media with Asia-based ESPN Star Sports. On 15 June 2009, he was appointed assistant manager to John Barnes at Tranmere Rovers. On 9 October 2009, McAteer was sacked along with Barnes after a run of just two league wins from 11 games.\n\nAs of 2013 he regularly appears as a match analyst on LFC TV. In October 2013, McAteer married Lucy Edwards in Limerick.\n\nMcAteer featured in EA Sports' \"FIFA\" video game series; he was on the cover for the International edition of FIFA 96, alongside Frank de Boer.\n\n\n"}

He was only a year old when \"Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up\" hit the stage in 1904, and as such was not a primary inspiration for the characters of Peter and the Lost Boys. However he was eight years old when the novel adaptation \"Peter and Wendy\" was published, and in later editions of the play, the character Michael Darling's middle name was changed to \"Nicholas.\" He was the first cousin of the English writer Daphne du Maurier.\n\nWhen Davies was born, Barrie was already a friend of his brothers and mother Sylvia. Following the deaths of the boys' father Arthur (1907) and mother (1910), Barrie became their guardian (along with their uncles Guy du Maurier and Crompton Llewelyn Davies, and their grandmother Emma du Maurier). Two of Davies's brothers died before he was an adult: George was killed in combat in World War I in 1915, Michael drowned with a close friend in 1921. Davies attended Eton College, and started at Oxford University in 1922, but continued to spend holidays with Barrie.\n\nIn 1926 he married Mary James, daughter of Walter John James, 3rd Baron Northbourne, and they had a daughter Laura, born in 1928. Barrie became godfather to Laura. In 1935 he joined his brother's publishing firm, Peter Davies Ltd. His brother Jack died in 1959, and Peter committed suicide in 1960. As the last surviving subject of the 1978 BBC mini-series \"The Lost Boys\", he was a consultant to writer Andrew Birkin. He died on 14 October 1980 at his home in Eythorne, Kent.\n\nIn \"The Lost Boys\", he was portrayed at various ages by Stephen Mathews, Jason Fathers, Matthew Ryan, and David Parfitt (later award-winning producer).\n\nHe was not included in the 2004 film \"Finding Neverland\" based on the story of Barrie's relationship with the family and the writing of the play. It took the dramatic licence of placing the dates of Davies's father's death and his mother's illness much earlier relative to the writing of the play, leaving no practical place in its timeline for his birth.\n\n"}

It may be as an alternative to, or additional to, radio communications between the aircraft and air traffic control. The usual equipment of a marshaller is a reflecting safety vest, a helmet with acoustic earmuffs, and gloves or marshalling wands–handheld illuminated beacons.\n\nAt airports, the marshaller signals the pilot to keep turning, slow down, stop, and shut down engines, leading the aircraft to its parking stand or to the runway. Sometimes, the marshaller indicates directions to the pilot by driving a \"Follow-Me\" car (usually a yellow van or pick-up truck with a checkerboard pattern) prior to disembarking and resuming signalling, though this is not an industry standard.\n\nAt busier and better equipped airports, marshallers are replaced on some stands with a Visual Docking Guidance System (VDGS), of which there are many types.\n\nOn aircraft carriers or helipads, marshallers give take-off and landing clearances to aircraft and helicopters, where the very limited space and time between take-offs and landings makes radio communications a difficult alternative.\n\nPer the most recent U.S. Air Force marshalling instructions from 2012, marshallers \"must wear a sleeveless garment of fluorescent international orange. It covers the shoulders and extends to the waist in the front and back. [...] During daylight hours, marshallers may use high visibility paddles. Self-illuminating wands are required at night or during restricted visibility.\"\n\nMarshallers, like other ground personnel, must use protective equipment like protective goggles or \"an appropriate helmet with visor, when in rotor wash areas or in front of an aircraft that is being backed using the aircraft's engines.\"\nIt also prescribes \"earplugs, muff-type ear defenders, or headsets in the immediate area of aircraft that have engines, Auxiliary Power Unit, or Gas Turbine Compressor running.\"\nExcessive noise can cause hearing loss in marshallers, either imperceptibly over years or after a one-time acoustic trauma. In the United States noise limits at work are set by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).\n\nAircraft signals vary slightly among the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Standardization Agreement 3117, Air Standardization Coordinating Committee Air Standard 44/42A, the Appendix 1 of the Annex 2 to the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation, and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) signals. the US Air Force generally follows ICAO guidance if its guidance conflicts with FAA, ICAO, or NATO documents.\nThe ICAO defines numerous important codes for use in international aviation.\n\n"}

Seyðisfjörður is surrounded by mountains with the most prominent Mt. Bjólfur to the west (1085m) and Strandartindur (1010m) to the east. The fjord itself is accessible on each side from the town, by following the main road that leads through the town. Further out the fjord is fairly remote but rich with natural interests including puffin colonies and ruins of former activity such as nearby Vestdalseyri, from where the local church was transported.\n\nSettlement in Seyðisfjörður traces back to the early period of settlement in Iceland. The first settler was Bjólfur, who occupied the entire fjord. The burned down ruin of a stave church at Þórunnarstaðir has been carbon-dated to the 10th century, with earlier graves exhumed dating back to the 8th century.\n\nThe town settlement in the Seyðisfjörður area started in 1848. The town was settled by Norwegian fishermen. These settlers also built some of the wooden buildings which still exist in the town. Another now-deserted settlement nearby in the fjord, Vestddalseyri was the site for the world's first modern industrialized whaling station. It was established in 1864 by the renowned American whaler Thomas Welcome Roys and run by him and his workforce until 1866. Both settlements served primarily as fishing and trading posts. The first telegraph cable connecting Iceland to Europe made landfall in Seyðisfjörður in 1906, making it a hub for international telecommunications well past the middle of last century. In 1913, a dam was made in the main river, harnessing power for the country's first high-voltage AC power plant together with a distribution network for street lighting and home use, also the first of its kind in Iceland. Seyðisfjörður was used as a base for British/American forces during World War II and remnants of this activity are visible throughout the fjord, including a landing strip no longer in use and an oil tanker that was bombed and sunk.

Voigt was the son of the historian Johannes Voigt. Voigt belonged to the founders of modern research into the Italian Renaissance along with Jacob Burckhardt.\n\nIn 1860 Voigt was called by Heinrich von Sybel to the University of Rostock as professor of history. 1866 he became professor of history at the University of Leipzig, following the historian Wilhelm Wachsmuth. His research was into the topics of humanism in the 15th and 16th centuries and the history of the Schmalkaldic war. Unlike Burckhardt, Voigt described only the first century of a movement which came from Renaissance Florence and spread all through Europe. Burckhardt described all features of Italian society of the Renaissance. Their research methods were very different. Burckhardt was more a cultural historian with a historic-philosophical method. Voigt, in the methodical scholarship of Leopold von Ranke, worked more with a philological method. Voigt wrote \"Wiederbelebung des classischen Alterthums oder das erste Jahrhundert des Humanismus\" (Revival of Classical Antiquity or the First Century of Humanism). In Voigt's opinion Francesco Petrarca was the origin of Italian humanism. What was very important to him was the new relationship of man in the Renaissance to Classical antiquity especially to Cicero and his \"humanitas\" (humanity). Cicero's \"humanitas\" is the terminological origin of humanism in general. Despite the connection between Dante Alighieri and Roman authors such as Seneca and Cicero, he is not, in Voigt's opinion, a typical Renaissance man like Petrach and his successors, because Dante stood in the late mediaeval world and the corporative structures. In recognizing his own self as a human in context with the studies of the Classical authors, Petrarch left the old mediaeval world and its structures behind. The consciousness of being a human was the new quality. In the tradition of Ranke and Johann Gustav Droysen, Voigt used the term \"humanism\" for the description of a historical period.\n\nFurthermore, Voigt wrote on Maurice of Saxony. Voigt's biography about the elector is the first, which is compare to the standards of an objective historical science. He realized within a postulate from the German historian Wilhelm Maurenbrecher.\n\n\n"}

The platforms were rebuilt in 1948 so that they faced each other in the conventional side platform arrangement. One platform was taken out of service in the 1960s, as were a number of sidings. Fenny Stratford was reduced to an unstaffed halt in 1968, freight facilities having been withdrawn the previous year. , the station remains unstaffed.

Joanna Grossman, writing for FindLaw, emphasized \"the need for the federal courts to weigh in\", rather than for states to continue making a public-policy exception when deciding the status of same-sex relationships independently of the decisions of other states, as states have been permitted to do in the case of incestuous marriages. The Act was designed to protect DOMA by prohibiting federal courts from hearing cases like that of Nancy Wilson, who sued to have her relationship with Paula Schoenwether treated as marriage in Florida because it had been treated as marriage in Massachusetts. In that case, the federal court upheld DOMA.\n\nThe U.S. Constitution permits Congress to make exceptions to court jurisdiction. The degree to which such exceptions may undermine federal separation of powers, the Equal Protection Clause, or the Due Process Clause, may render the Marriage Protection Act unconstitutional, according to Grossman.\n\n"}

Marie-Dominique Philippe, to teach these seminarians personally, Lefebvre approached the Bishop of Fribourg, who, three months before resigning his see, approved, with a document predated by six days to 1 November 1970, the founding of SSPX at the level of a \"pia unio\", the preliminary stage towards becoming an officially recognized religious institute or Society of Apostolic Life. Affluent Swiss laymen offered the seminary at Écône in Switzerland to the newly formed group.\n\nThe seminary received a reputation as a \"wildcat seminary\" for its teaching of traditional practices which were being abandoned in most other parts of the church. The statements made by two apostolic visitors to the seminary in November 1974 resulted in Lefebvre's \"Declaration\" as a rebuttal. At the seminary, in 1988, he consecrated four bishops without papal approval, an act which was met with his excommunication \"latae sententiae\". Lefebvre resided in a private apartment on the property until his death in 1991 and is buried in a tomb nearby, which was visited by Cardinal Silvio Oddi in 1992.\n\n"}

These tarantulas are fast growing, usually taking around 3–4 years to reach a mature leg-span of 8.5 inches for females.\n\nThese tarantulas have been much prized as pets, due to their size, hardiness, and striking colouration. They are usually somewhat defensive, and their urticating hairs can be quite irritating to human skin, as with most other tarantulas found in the Americas.\n\nThese spiders, like many undomesticated pets, can bite when provoked. However, as they have urticating hairs, biting is typically not their first line of defense. Their venom is not considered medically significant, but due to their large size, they can cause mechanical damage.\n\n"}

It is 47 miles (75 km) northwest of , about 32 miles (51 km) east of and 17 miles (27 km) west of , and is one of the six railway stations serving the Milton Keynes urban area.\n\nIt includes junctions of the West Coast Main Line with the Bletchley-Bedford Marston Vale Line and the disused Bletchley-Oxford Varsity line. It is the nearest main line station for Bletchley Park (the World War II codebreaking centre) and Stadium MK (the home of Milton Keynes Dons F.C).\n\nThe London and Birmingham Railway, now part of the \"West Coast Main Line\", was officially opened from Euston as far as (approximately one mile north of Bletchley station) on 9 April 1838, where a temporary station was built. The line was fully opened in September 1838, and Bletchley station opened some time between 2 November 1838 and 20 June 1839. The station was known as Bletchley & Fenny Stratford between 1841 and 1846 and after the opening of the Marston Vale line was referred to in timetables as Bletchley Junction from 1851 to 1870. Originally a major intercity station, that role passed to Milton Keynes Central in 1982 when the latter was built, long after the east–west route had been downgraded, taking Bletchley's importance as a junction with it.\n\nThe eastward route (to ) opened in 1846. The westward route (to ) opened in 1850. This east–west route subsequently became the Oxford – \"Varsity Line\".\n\nThere are six platforms in use, numbered 1 to 6 from west to east. Platforms 1 and 2 primarily serve the WCML fast lines used by Avanti West Coast expresses that do not stop at the station and consequently normally see little or no use unless other platforms are unavailable. Platforms 3 and 4 serve the WCML slow lines and are used by London Northwestern Railway services between Euston and Birmingham New Street, along with Southern's Milton Keynes Central trains. Platforms 5 and 6 are located on the eastern side and are the only ones that give access to the Marston Vale line to Bedford (though they can also be used exceptionally by main line trains). Bedford trains normally start and terminate at platform 6, but can use platform 5 if required. There are carriage sidings to the north of the station (along with the now closed train maintenance depot), whilst the high level flyover carrying the former Varsity Line towards Oxford crosses the main lines to the south. The main buildings and station entrance are located on the west (Bletchley Park) side of the complex, off Sherwood Drive.\n\nThere are ticket barriers controlling access to the platforms.\n\nAs well as being on the national north–south West Coast Main Line, Bletchley is also on the east–west former Cambridge–Oxford Varsity line, though only the central section, the Marston Vale line, between Bletchley and Bedford and the section between Oxford and are open for passenger services.\n\nBletchley, in common with other stations on this line, is covered by the Marston Vale Community Rail Partnership, which aims to promote the line by encouraging local users to take an active interest in it.\n\n, the route beyond Bletchley to the west through Winslow to Bicester is closed.\n\nThe high level crossing over the WCML, officially named the \"Bletchley Flyover\" and comprising seven spans and built in 1959 as part of the British Rail Modernisation Plan, by-passes Bletchley station. At the time it was expected to carry as many as 80 trains a day and though it remains in place, it is not in use. There is a funded, scheduled, plan to re-open this route to passenger traffic via Bicester to Oxford by 2025 and an unfunded plan to re-open the entire route between Oxford and Cambridge. In the view of Milton Keynes Council, a key element of the plan is to build high level platforms at Bletchley so that passengers may transfer between the lines. \n\nIn April and May 2020, the flyover was refurbished, with sections of the deck being replaced.\n\nAs part of a project to regenerate Bletchley as a whole, Milton Keynes Council has proposed the creation of a new eastern pedestrian access to the station by extending the existing platform overbridge across the tracks to reach Saxon Street. The proposed eastern entrance is to open out into a new station square and a transport interchange where an at-grade pedestrian crossing across Saxon Street would give access to the town centre and bus station. In the longer term it is planned to construct an underground concourse to link the eastern and western station entrances.\n\nFollowing approval on 29 November 2011 of the western section of East West Rail between Oxford and Bedford via Bletchley, the route was expected to open in 2019. The plan provides for new high level platforms to be built on the flyover as the line has no direct route through the existing station without reversing.\n\nOn 7 July 2014, the South East Midlands Local Enterprise Partnership announced that the Government had allocated £64.6 million funding for various projects that includes a £1.5 million contribution towards the cost of this work. However, , work on the high-level platforms or the Saxon Street entrance had yet to begin.\n\nIn July 2017, Network Rail began a public consultation on the details of its proposals for the Bicester–Bedford section of East West Rail. The consultation documents provide detailed drawings for the high-level platforms but do not include any details about the station itself. In December 2017, the Transport Minister Chris Grayling announced to a press conference at Bletchley Park that a new private sector company, the East West Railway Company, was being established to build and operate the line.\n\nIn mid September 2012, the Transport Minister Norman Baker announced in a 'written answer' that the Government had approved London Midland's request to reduce the opening hours of the ticket office, so that the station would close at 21:00 on Mondays and 20:00 on Tuesdays to Fridays. Defending the Government's decision to reduce the opening hours at Bletchley and at , local MPs Iain Stewart and Mark Lancaster said that most passengers use ticket machines to buy or retrieve their tickets. Speaking for the opposition Cooperative and Labour Party, prospective parliamentary candidate Andrew Pakes called it the \"thin end of the wedge\", that would put into question the opening hours of the station toilets and waiting room.\n\nServices at Bletchley are operated by London Northwestern Railway and Southern. As of December 2019, off-peak services (with units in TPH or 'trains per hour') are:\n\n\n\nThe station is on Sherwood Drive in Old Bletchley, near the B4034. The nearest post-code is MK3 6DZ. In the chainage notation traditionally used on the railway, its location on the West Coast Main Line is from Euston; to Oxford on the former Varsity line the distance is ; and to Bedford it is .\n\n\n"}

He held the position of Chief Rabbi of the United Kingdom from 1913 until his death in 1946, in a period encompassing both world wars and the Holocaust.\n\nHertz was born in Rebrín/Rebrény, Kingdom of Hungary (presently part of the village of Zemplínska Široká, Slovak Republic), in 1872 and emigrated to New York City in 1884. He was educated at New York City College (BA), Columbia University (PhD) and the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (Rabbi, 1894, the Seminary's first graduate). His first ministerial post was at Syracuse, New York.\n\nIn 1898, he moved to Transvaal, South Africa, to the Witwatersrand Old Hebrew Congregation in Johannesburg. He stayed there until 1911, despite attempts by President Paul Kruger in 1899 to expel him for his pro-British sympathies and for advocating the removal of religious disabilities of Jews and Catholics in South Africa. He was Professor of Philosophy at Transvaal University College (later known as the University of the Witwatersrand), 1906-8.\n\nIn 1911, he returned to New York to the Orach Chayim Congregation.\n\nIn 1913, Hertz was elected Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the British Empire; he received 298 votes against 39 for Dayan Moses Hyamson. His rival candidates had also included Lewis Daly, and Bernard Drachman. (Ironically, Hyamson took the rabbi's post of Orach Chayim in New York, which Hertz had vacated for the British Chief Rabbi appointment.)\n\nHertz held the post until his death. His tenure was affected by arguments with a wide variety of people, mainly within the Jewish community; the \"Dictionary of National Biography\" describes him as a \"combative Conservative\". It was said that he was in favour of resolving disagreements by calm discussion – when all other methods had failed.\n\nDespite his title, he was not universally recognised as the final rabbinical authority, even in Britain. While he was Chief Rabbi of the group of synagogues known as the United Hebrew Congregations of the British Empire, led by the United Synagogue, a minority of new immigrants who had arrived since the 1880s regarded it as insufficiently orthodox. Hertz tried both persuasion and such force as he could muster to influence them; he added to his credibility among these immigrants by persuading Rabbi Yehezkel Abramsky to become head of the London \"Beth Din\".\n\nHertz antagonised others by his strong support for Zionism in the 1920s and 1930s, when many Jews were against it, fearing that it would lead to accusations against the Jewish community of divided loyalty. Hertz was strongly opposed to Reform and Liberal Judaism, though he did not allow this to create personal animosities, and had no objection in principle to attending the funerals of Reform Jews.\n\nHowever, despite all this, his eloquent oratory, lucid writing, erudition and sincerity earned him the respect of the majority of British Jews and many outside the Jewish community. His commentary on the Torah is still to be found in most Orthodox synagogues and Jewish homes in Great Britain. Despite there being some Ultra-Orthodox Jews who do not look up to Hertz, prominent Ultra-Orthodox Rabbi Nosson Scherman maintained that Hertz \"was a great man,\" a courageous Rabbi, and that although he was affiliated with the Jewish Theological Seminary Hertz \"was Orthodox, without any question.\"\n\nAlthough Hertz vigorously denounced the horror of the Holocaust (at one point relating an eyewitness claim that \"German soldiers in football attire entered [a] stadium [near Kiev]. They snatched the infants from their mothers' arms and used them as footballs, bouncing and kicking them around the arena.\"), Hertz was opposed to the \"Kindertransport\" if it meant Jewish refugee children would be raised in the homes of gentiles. Hertz saw the British war effort in the noblest of terms, wishing Prime Minister Winston Churchill a happy 70th birthday in late 1944 with the message, \"But for your wisdom and courage there would have been a Vichy England lying prostrate before an all-powerful Satanism that spelled slavery to the western peoples, death to Israel, and night to the sacred heritage of man.\"\n\nHe was \"ex officio\" President of Jews' College, and Acting Principal, 1939–45. He was President of the Jewish Historical Society of England, 1922-3, and of the Conference of Anglo-Jewish Preachers. He was on the Board of Governors of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Chairman of the Governing Body of its Institute of Jewish Studies. He was Vice-President of a wide variety of Jewish and non-Jewish bodies, including the Anglo-Jewish Association, the London Hospital, the League of Nations Union, the National Council of Public Morals and King George's Fund for Sailors. In 1942, with the Archbishop of Canterbury, William Temple, Hertz founded the Council of Christians and Jews to combat anti-Jewish bigotry.\n\nHis daughter Judith married Rabbi Solomon Schonfeld. His great granddaughter is the economist Noreena Hertz.\n\nIn the 1920s, Hertz successfully organised international opposition to a proposed calendar reform. The League of Nations was considering a calendar amendment, The World Calendar, such that a given date would fall on the same day of the week every year. This requires that one day every year (two in leap years) is not any day of the week but a \"world day\". Thus, once or twice a year there would be eight days rather than seven between consecutive Saturdays. Thus the Jewish Sabbath, which must occur every seventh day, would be on a different weekday each year. The same applies to the Christian Sabbath. Hertz realised that this would cause problems for Jews and Christians alike in observing their Sabbaths, and mobilised worldwide religious opposition to defeat the proposal.\n\nHe was made a Companion of Honour in 1943. He was also Commander of the Order of Léopold II of Belgium and had a Columbia University medal.\n\nA memorial plaque on his former London home at 103 Hamilton Terrace, Maida Vale was unveiled on 12 March 1996.\n\n\nHertz edited a Hebrew-English edition of the Jewish Prayer Book or Siddur (1946), and contributed to the \"Jewish Encyclopedia\" and the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\".\nHe also edited a significant commentary on the Torah (1929–36, one volume edition 1937). Popularly known as the Hertz Chumash, this classic Hebrew-English edition of the Five Books of Moses, with corresponding Haftorahs, is used in many synagogues and classrooms throughout the English-speaking world. \n\nIt is also referred to as the \"Hertz Pentateuch\", and it includes the following features:\n\nIt also includes views of the most important medieval Jewish commentators, such as Abraham ibn Ezra, Rashi, Ramban, Radak, Sforno and Ralbag (Gersonides).\n\nThe actual writing, which produced five volumes, was done by four other people, but \"Hertz recast their material into his own style.\"\n\nWhen the five volumes were combined into a single volume (and published by Soncino Press), the Revised Version translation, but not the non-Jewish commentaries, were replaced with the 1917 Jewish Publication Society translation. Both translations were lightly edited by Hertz (e.g., at Lev. 27:29 RV and Num. 10:33 JPS).\n\n\n"}

They were owned by Diamond Sports & Entertainment, previous owners of the GBL and primary investors in the North American League.\n\nTheir home stadiums included Tony Gwynn Stadium, named after former Padres great Tony Gwynn and located on the campus of San Diego State University, and then Desert Sun Stadium in Yuma, Arizona, as part of the AWL and ASL. They were the inaugural GBL Champions in 2005 managed by current Tucson Padres manager Terry Kennedy. They were awarded the 2010 ASL Championship.\n\nThe Surf Dawgs were one of the eight original GBL charter teams that began play in 2005 along with the Chico Outlaws, Fullerton Flyers and Long Beach Armada in California; Mesa Miners, Surprise Fightin' Falcons and Yuma Scorpions in Arizona and the traveling Japan Samurai Bears. They were known for playing in the same city as a Major League Baseball team, the National League's San Diego Padres.\n\nThe signing of Rickey Henderson gave the team national exposure. (Henderson had also played for the Padres from 1996 to 1997 and in 2001.) Former first-round draft pick Matt Wheatland is among five San Diegans on the roster.\n\nThe 2005 team won the first ever GBL California Division title, and on Labor Day weekend 2005 they won the inaugural GBL Championship tournament, coming back on the last day to win two games.\n\nThe team again made news in June 2006 by signing former Major League player José Canseco. He made his debut on July 3, 2006 and struck out 4 times. Prior to the game, the \"\" author looked like the Bash Brother of old during batting practice, knocking multiple pitches out of the park. After playing in one game with the Surf Dawgs, Canseco requested to be traded to a team closer to his home in Los Angeles and was sent to the Long Beach Armada.\n\nThe team joined the Arizona Winter League as the Sonora Surf Dawgs in January 2007, but reverted to San Diego for the 2008 season. During the AWL regular season, they are managed by Cory Snyder, who also manages the GBL's St. George RoadRunners. In 2008, they were placed in the new American Division for the 2009 season along with the Blythe Heat, Palm Springs Chill and Yuma Scorpions.\n\nThe Surf Dawgs participated in a Lucha & Baseball exhibition game on June 25, 2009, along with some professional wrestlers against the Tucson Toros, which they won 8-3.\n\nThe Surf Dawgs became a charter team of the new Arizona Summer League in June 2009. They played alongside the El Centro Imperials and Canada Miners in 2009 and then the Long Beach Armada and Bisbee Miners in 2010. They replaced the San Luis Atleticos and Yuma Scorpions, who were originally scheduled to play in the league, but were dropped prior to the start of the inaugural season. They began play on July 2. The Surf Dawgs, instead of the Scorpions, have become the first team to have played in all three leagues within the GBL system.\nThey were awarded the ASL Championship in 2010 and 2011.\n\nThe GBL has mentioned the possibility of the Surf Dawgs return to the league for 2010. The team still does not have a suitable ballpark to play on, but the league website is saying that it should change by 2010. The team's official website was temporarily shut down in late June 2009, possibly for revamping as the team is expected to return according to the league. But the website returned in August. It is uncertain whether or not the team is up for sale.\n\nThe Surf Dawgs finally went dormant and eventually folded after the Arizona Winter League and Arizona Summer League ceased operations following the folding of the North American League in 2011.\n\nGolden Baseball League:\nArizona Winter League:\nArizona Summer League:\n\n\n"}

Penicillin began with Chisato on vocals, Gisho on bass, O-Jiro on drums and both Yuuji and Shaisuke on guitar. Before anything was recorded however the band's line-up changed to Hakuei on vocals, Gisho on bass, O-Jiro on drums and both Shaisuke and Chisato on guitar. Their name was taken from the punk rock group \"Penicillin Shock\" in the manga series \"To-y\" and they titled their first album, which was released in 1994 and produced by Kiyoshi of Media Youth, after the fictional band. However, after their first album, Shaisuke left Penicillin to join Deshabillz.\n\nThe band made their major debut in 1996 with \"Blue Moon\" on Pioneer LDC. In 1997 the released \"Limelight\", which was named one of the top albums from 1989-1998 in a 2004 issue of the music magazine \"Band Yarouze\".

{"id": "1929708", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1929708", "title": "Meccano Ltd", "text": "Meccano Ltd\n\nMeccano Ltd was a British toy company established in 1908 by Frank Hornby in England to manufacture and distribute Meccano and other model toys and kits created by the company. During the 1920s and 1930s it became the biggest toy manufacturer in the United Kingdom and produced three of the most popular lines of toys in the twentieth century: Meccano, Hornby Trains and Dinky Toys.\n\nFinancial problems beset the company in the early 1960s and Meccano Ltd was taken over by Lines Bros Ltd in 1964.\n\nIn 1901 Frank Hornby, a clerk from Liverpool, England, invented a new construction toy called \"Mechanics Made Easy\", which soon became known as Meccano. To manufacture and distribute Meccano, Hornby needed to raise capital to invest in factory and plant, and this resulted in the establishment of Meccano Ltd in 1908, with Hornby as the sole proprietor. A factory was acquired in West Derby Road in Liverpool and the company began producing Meccano sets for sale across the UK.\n\nIn 1909 Meccano Ltd added to its range by launching the \"Hornby System of Mechanical Demonstration\". This was an educational set Hornby had created for use in schools which included a 44-page manual, showing all dimensions in centimetres. However, it was not a commercial success and it was discontinued after five years. This was the first use of the Hornby name, which later was to become synonymous with the company's Hornby Dublo 00 gauge model railway system.\n\nBy 1910 Meccano was exported worldwide, and its success prompted Meccano Ltd to expand its operations. In 1912, Hornby and his son, Roland, formed Meccano (France) Ltd in Paris to manufacture Meccano, and an office was opened in Berlin, Germany where Märklin began to manufacture Meccano under licence. Meccano factories were also established in Spain and Argentina. In 1912 Hornby started importing clockwork motors from Märklin, but when the supply from Germany stopped after the outbreak of World War I in 1914, he began manufacturing his own clockwork motors in Liverpool.\n\nUp to this point Meccano was being manufactured in England at the small factory in West Derby Road, Liverpool, but it soon became apparent that it could not meet the growing demand for Meccano, and in 1914 a new factory was built in Binns Road, Liverpool. The Binns Road factory became the company headquarters for over 60 years.\nIn 1920 the company started to produce 0 gauge model railways, and this production line continued into the 1960s. In 1922, Meccano Ltd opened a factory in Elizabeth, New Jersey where it produced its building sets for the North American market. In 1927 it started producing clockwork lithographed tinplate 0 gauge trains there as well. However, in 1929, it sold its New Jersey factory to the A. C. Gilbert Company, whose similar Erector Set toy was popular in the United States, and Meccano's trains and construction sets disappeared from the U.S. market by 1930.\nIn early 1934 Meccano Ltd introduced Dinky Toys, a new line of die-cast miniature model cars and trucks under the trade mark \"Meccano Dinky Toys\". In the same year, they also introduced a construction toy for younger children called Dinky Builder. It comprised rectangular and triangular hinged metal plates that could be quickly and easily assembled. The parts were painted jade green and salmon pink in an attempt to draw girls into the otherwise boys-only toy market.\n\nIn 1938 Meccano Ltd launched the 00 gauge Hornby Dublo model railway system, comprising both clockwork and electric train sets. Production continued until 1964.\n\nIn 1942 the production of all toys ceased due to wartime legislation and the company switched to manufacturing for the war effort. Despite the heavy bombing of Liverpool during the war, the Binns Road factory was not damaged. The production of Meccano, Dinky Toys and Hornby Dublo slowly resumed after the war in 1945, but was interrupted again in 1950 by the Korean War due to a shortage of metal.\n\nIn 1960 Meccano Ltd purchased Bayko, a Bakelite building model construction toy, from Plimpton Engineering in Liverpool, and moved all its production to Meccano's factory in Speke, Liverpool. The construction sets were updated and polystyrene was used for all the plastic parts instead of Bakelite. Manufacture of Bayko continued until 1967. Meccano Ltd also manufactured Kemex (chemistry sets) and Elektron (electrical sets).\n\nBy the early 1960s Meccano Ltd began experiencing financial problems, in spite of exports worth over £1m, and was bought out by Lines Bros Ltd (Tri-ang), Meccano's biggest competitor, in February 1964. This purchase included both the British and French Meccano factories. Sweeping changes were implemented, including the removal from office of the last members of the Hornby family and applying the Hornby name to the Tri-ang plastic trains. In 1970 Lines Brothers changed the company name to Meccano-Tri-ang.\n\nIn 1971 the Lines Brothers Tri-ang group went into voluntary liquidation and Meccano-Tri-ang was eventually sold to Airfix industries in 1972, the company name reverting to Meccano Ltd. At the same time, General Mills, a United States toy manufacturer, purchased the majority of shares of Meccano France S.A., renaming the French company Miro-Meccano.\n\nWith competition from other manufacturers from around the world and the increasing popularity of television, Meccano Ltd's dominance of the toy market diminished sharply. To cut their losses, Airfix closed Meccano Ltd's flagship Binns Road factory in Liverpool in November 1979, bringing to an end three-quarters of a century of British toy making. The manufacture of Meccano, however, still continued in France. Airfix were eventually liquidated two years later and in 1981 General Mills purchased Meccano Ltd UK, giving it complete control of the Meccano franchise. It shifted all Meccano and Airfix operations to France and completely revamped the Miro-Meccano construction sets.\n\nIn August 1985 French accountant Marc Rebibo bought Miro-Meccano from General Mills, reverted the French company name to Meccano S.A. and reintroduced some of the discontinued Meccano sets. In 1989 Rebibo was bought out by Finamec (Financière de Serbie), who continued the manufacture of Meccano in France. In 1990 Meccano France purchased the \"Erector\" trademark in the U.S.A. and started selling Meccano sets marked \"Erector Meccano\" in the U.S.A.\n\nBy 2000 Meccano France was faltering and was bought out in May 2000 by the Japanese toy company Nikko, who continue to manufacture Meccano sets in France and China, although very different from the Meccano originally manufactured by the Binns Road factory.\n\nIn 2013 Meccano was acquired by Spin Master.\n\n\n"}

The Outlaws were a member of the Northern Division of the independent North American League, which is not affiliated with either Major League Baseball or Minor League Baseball. From the 2005 season to the 2011 season, the Outlaws played their home games at Nettleton Stadium, on the campus of Chico State University. The team officially folded on February 29, 2012, and some of its remnants (including management and on-field staff) have gone to the NAL's newest team, the San Rafael Pacifics.\n\nThe rights to the Outlaws were owned by Diamond Sports & Entertainment (DSE). DSE Board Chairman was Joel Yarmon and CEO was Brian MacInnes. Those rights are now up in the air.\n\nThe Outlaws began play in May 2005, three years after their predecessors, the Chico Heat were forced to cease operations due to the folding of the Western Baseball League and not being able to find a new league to join. After the formation of the Golden Baseball League in 2004, Chico was granted one of the eight original charter teams in the league along with the Fullerton Flyers, Long Beach Armada and San Diego Surf Dawgs in California; Mesa Miners, Surprise Fightin' Falcons and Yuma Scorpions in Arizona and a traveling team the Japan Samurai Bears. The Outlaws, Flyers and Scorpions are the remaining charter teams still active in the league today. Chico, Long Beach and Yuma were former WBL cities. Former Heat minority owner and Western League president Bob Linscheid was the team's first president and general manager. He served those positions from 2004 to 2008. The Outlaws played in the GBL's Western Division.\n\nThey opened their inaugural season on May 27, 2005, against the Flyers at Nettleton Stadium, bringing professional baseball back to Chico for the first time since the Chico Heat's 2002 championship campaign with the Western League. They won that inaugural ball game 9-4. Their first manager was former Major League Baseball catcher Mark Parent, a native of Cottonwood, California. Linscheid was named the league's first-ever \"Executive of the Year\".\n\nContinuing the winning tradition in Chico, the Outlaws made the playoffs the first year but lost in the early rounds. In 2006 they were on the verge of winning the second half that would have put them in the Championship Series versus the Fullerton Flyers, but in an epic collapse they lost a 6 game lead with 10 games to play as they were beaten in 7 of their last 8 games by the Reno Silver Sox. The Silver Sox went on to win the 2006 GBL Championship defeating the Flyers 3 games to 1. It would take three years, but the Outlaws made it to their first GBL Championship Series in 2007 and beat the Long Beach Armada in four games, 3-1, to bring Chico their first professional championship since 2002. After winning the championship, Parent stepped down as manager and handed the reins over to former Heat player and Outlaws coach Jon Macalutas. The Outlaws lead the average attendance in the league with over 2,000 fans in 2008. On November 12, 2008, Macalutas realized that the job was not a good fit for him and resigned as manager of the Outlaws after his team went 34-51. In 2009, the Outlaws named former major league pitcher Greg Cadaret their manager but he failed to last the season and was fired midway through for his inability to be successful with his players on and off the field. Hitting coach Kory DeHaan took over and the team responded well with a much better record under DeHaan and improved 10 games over their dismal 2008 season. DeHaan was asked to return in 2010, but the San Diego Padres took note of his managing success in Chico and offered him a coaching job in their organization in his hometown of Phoenix.\n\nOn January 13, 2010, the Outlaws officially named former Major Leaguer and former Flyers and Armada manager Garry Templeton as their new manager. He led the team to their best ever record as the squad won the South Division First Half title with a mark of 33-12. They went on to sweep defending Champion Calgary in the first round of the playoffs. They signed 18-year-old female Japanese knuckleball pitcher Eri Yoshida, the first woman to play pro baseball in Japan, on April 9, 2010, to play the 2010 season. She is the first female pro baseball player in the United States in ten years. On June 24, the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum was on-hand and after Yoshida's start presented her with a plaque and collected her jersey and bat for inclusion in Cooperstown.\n\nThe Outlaws were one of six former GBL teams to join the newly formed North American League in 2010 and played in 2011. In February 2012, the team folded. (See below)\n\nOn July 4, 2007, the Outlaws and Reno Silver Sox were involved in a huge brawl that would be considered one of the most talked about events in GBL history. After Outlaws pitcher Nick Singleton gave up a Juan Sanreso 2-run home run, he plunked the next Sox batter and words were exchanged. Next, Outlaws batter Ricky Bambino was struck by Sox pitcher Dusty Bergman in apparent retaliation. More words were then exchanged, Bambino charged the mound, and the brawl was on. After about a one-minute fight, order was restored. Bambino, Bergman and Silver Sox manager Les Lancaster were all ejected for the altercation. The Outlaws would win the game 6-4.\n\nOn August 27, 2008, Bob Linscheid announced that he was stepping down as president and chairman of the board of the Outlaws to pursue other interests. He will remain a priority shareholder for the league. Curt Jacey took over operations following the end of the 2008 season while remaining as the team's now-full-time general manager, having left his GM post with the Reno Silver Sox.\n\nOn August 30, 2008, Linscheid was honored in a post-game ceremony for his hard work in helping to bring professional baseball to Chico in 1996 and for the many years afterward. The jersey #1 (which has never been worn by a player from either the Chico Heat or Chico Outlaws) was retired at Nettleton Stadium in his honor.\n\nLinscheid says the league is looking to expand and they plan on using the Outlaws as a model franchise.\n\nThough the Outlaws have averaged around 2,500 to 3,000 fans in attendance over their five-year existence, they made history by setting a new all-time attendance record at Nettleton Stadium against the Edmonton Capitals on July 3, 2009, when 5,037 fans packed the ballpark, including 400 seated \"inside\" along both the first base and third base lines next the dugouts. This shatters previous records held by the Chico Heat and the Outlaws. The Outlaws won the game, 8-5.\n\nChico Outfielder Daniel Nava was the 2007 GBL Most Valuable Player and had his contract purchased by the Boston Red Sox. On June 12, 2010 against the Philadelphia Phillies he was the first Chico Outlaw to make it to the Major Leagues and responded by becoming only the fourth player in major league history in hit a grand slam in his first at bat as he went deep to centerfield on the first pitch thrown to him.\n\n\nOn June 1, 2010, Eri Yoshida, a 5 foot, 1 inch female knuckleball pitcher from Japan, pitched for the Outlaws.\n\nThe Outlaws made history and defied the odds to sweep the Calgary Vipers to win the GBL North Division Title, then sweep Na Koa Ikaika Maui to capture their second GBL Championship in 2010, becoming the first team in league history to accomplish that feat, as well as going undefeated in the playoffs.\n\nDavid Kaval, co-founder and C.E.O. of the GBL since its inception in 2005, resigned to take the job as team president of the San Jose Earthquakes of Major League Soccer. Kaval will remain on board as chairman of the GBL Board of Directors. Team president Mike Marshall indicated that the team will return for the 2011 season.\n\nThe Outlaws identity was given to a new expansion team in the Arizona Winter League, the Calexico Outlaws. The team currently plays in the International Division.\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>The #1 jersey was never worn by any player from either the Chico Heat \"or\" Chico Outlaws.\n\nAll Outlaws games were originally heard on NewsTalk 1290 KPAY and ESPN Radio 101.7 FM/1340 AM from 2005 to 2008 with Rory Miller on the call. Due to declining advertising interest in radio, the games were made available live on the internet at the team's website.\n\nBroadcasts of the Outlaws games were moved from the radio to the internet full-time courtesy of VistaNet in 2009, with Joe Rauschenberger announced as the new play-by-play commentator. He was later replaced by Scott Navarro and Levi Funderburk close to the end of the season.\n\nOn March 26, 2010, Dan Hawkins was named as the \"Voice of the Outlaws\" and called Outlaws baseball live on the internet for that season.\n\nFor the 2011 season, Marshall Kelner, a graduate of the University of Southern California, was named broadcaster and brought play by play action online at ChicoOutlaws.com\n\nThe Chico Outlaws have one of the few female public address announcers in professional baseball, Shelly Rogers; 2011 was her fourth season with the Outlaws and second full-time.\n\nAs of October 6, 2011, Outlaws VP/GM Mike Marshall told the local Chico newspaper he was laid off and the office closed. Meanwhile, the team, which is owned by the North America League, has no lease next season for Nettleton Stadium—and with no one working in the closed office, there are no sales efforts underway for 2012.\n\nOn December 16 & 17, 2011, the Chico Enterprise-Record reported that the Outlaws will sit out the 2012 season as they regroup. But it is unclear if the franchise will ever return to Chico.\n\nOn January 9, 2012, the Chico Enterprise-Record reported the Chico Outlaws are discussing contract options for leasing Nettleton Stadium from CSU Chico for the upcoming 2012 season.\n\nOn February 29, 2012, Outlaws CEO Brian MacInnes announced that the team would not play in Chico, or \"anywhere else\", in 2012... thus, ending the franchise's run in town.\n\nThough, there have been rumors of possible returns of professional franchises to Chico, there has been nothing concrete set of as yet.\n\n"}

The Armada was a member of the North Division of the now-defunct Golden Baseball League (GBL), which was not affiliated with either Major League Baseball or Minor League Baseball. The Armada played its home games at Blair Field. \n\nThe Armada fielded a team for the Arizona Summer League in 2010 months after suspending GBL operations, and then a team in the Arizona Winter League in 2011. The franchise has been owned by Diamond Sports & Entertainment, primary investors in the current North American League (NAL), since 2005. \n\nThe team had 13 different players during its first five seasons that played at the major league level. In addition, 21 Long Beach Armada players have had their contracts purchased by major league organizations.\n\nThe team was one of the original eight GBL charter teams that began play in 2005. They began play in May 2005, three years after their predecessors, the Long Beach Breakers, folded along with the Western Baseball League. Former Armada manager Steve Yeager managed the Breakers to the WBL Championship in 2001, that team's inaugural season, beating the Chico Heat 3 games to 2.\n\nOn December 18, 2009, the Long Beach Armada, to protect its ability to play at Blair Field, engaged lawyers to take action against the City of Long Beach and Long Beach State University alleging that the two public entities conspired to prematurely end the Armada's permit to play at Blair Field that still had three years left. The City of Long Beach made an arrangement to either sell or provide a long-term lease to Long Beach State University for the college to take over the maintenance and cost of running Blair Field, but first had to revoke the Armada's permit, which was standing in the way of completing a deal and had usage and concessions rights. As a result, the Armada suspended operations following the 2009 season.\n\nThe Armada fielded a team in the Arizona Summer League in June 2010. They played alongside the Bisbee Miners and San Diego Surf Dawgs. They replaced the El Centro Imperials.\n\nOn January 5, 2011, the Arizona Winter League released their schedule and it was announced the Armada would be joining the league along with the returning Sonora Pilots and two new teams, the Arizona RoadRunners and Team Mexico and would become the second team (behind the Surf Dawgs) to have played in all three leagues within the GBL/NABL system.\n\nNotable former Armada players include former MLB star José Canseco; ex-Yankee Hideki Irabu; outfielder Josh Womack, who became a web sensation in June 2009 with the video of his \"spinning bat trick\"; and former Dodger José Lima, who was on the roster at the time of his death in May 2010.\n\nIn February 2008, The Armada signed Tony Torcato, who has since been traded to the Chico Outlaws. One month later, in March 2008, the Long Beach Armada signed former Major League Baseball pitcher Jerome Williams.\n\nOther ex-major leaguers who have played for the Long Beach Armada include Bud Smith, Nick Bierbrodt, Adam Pettyjohn (the only Armada to have made it back to the big leagues from the club), Mark Quinn, Alan Newman, Chris Wakeland, Cleatus Davidson, Steve Smyth, and Seth Etherton.\n\nGolden Baseball League (2005–2009):\n\nArizona Summer League (2010):\n"}

A driver and owner in the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series circuit and the winner of the 2004 NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series championship, Hamilton owned Bobby Hamilton Racing. Hamilton's son, Bobby Hamilton Jr., is also a NASCAR driver.\n\nHamilton may be best remembered for two of his Winston Cup Series wins. His first career victory at the 1996 Dura Lube 500 at Phoenix was the first win for the No. 43 Petty car since Richard Petty's last win in 1984. He also had a memorable win at the Talladega 500 in April 2001 driving the No. 55 car for owner Andy Petree. The entire 500-mile race was run caution-free and was under intense scrutiny from both NASCAR and the media at large, being the first superspeedway race run since the death of Dale Earnhardt at the 2001 Daytona 500 two months earlier. A physically and mentally exhausted Hamilton slumped to the ground after exiting his car and was given oxygen from a tank before giving the standard post-race Victory Lane interview while sitting on the ground, leaning against the drivers door.\n\nBorn in Nashville, Tennessee, Hamilton lost his parents very young to illness. Hamilton quit school at the age of thirteen and began his racing career at Nashville Speedway USA, now Fairgrounds Speedway, racing on the weekly circuit at the legendary track, where he won the track championship in 1987. Hamilton began to be noticed within the NASCAR ranks after racing in a special four-car \"Superstar Showdown\" at Nashville in 1988 against Cup Series drivers Sterling Marlin, Darrell Waltrip, and Bill Elliott.\n\nHamilton broke into the Winston Cup ranks in a very unusual way. He was asked to drive one of the \"movie cars\" for the 1990 film \"Days of Thunder\", qualifying fifth in a movie car at the 1989 Autoworks 500 in Phoenix, in a car that was not intended to be competitive. The car was the No. 51 Exxon-sponsored machine, portrayed in the movie as being driven by the character Rowdy Burns.\n\nIn 2006, Kyle Busch, at the time a driver for Hendrick Motorsports, which fielded the movie cars, drove a Billy Ballew Motorsports truck in the Craftsman Truck Series featuring a \"throwback\" paint scheme visually echoing Hamilton's car from that movie. It was raced at Lowe's Motor Speedway in 2006, in support of Hamilton, who was undergoing cancer treatment. The name on top of the door on Busch's truck was listed by the nickname \"Rowdy Busch\" (clearly referencing the Rowdy Burns name on the original car), and won the event.\n\nAfter Busch departed the team, BBM kept the paint scheme, uniform design, and No. 51 for their Truck Series campaign as the reverse number to their regular No. 15. After BBM closed its doors in 2011, Busch took the number to his own team Kyle Busch Motorsports and continues to run the \"Rowdy\" decal in races he is in the truck.\n\nHamilton made his NASCAR debut in the Busch Series in 1988 at Charlotte Motor Speedway driving his own No. 16 Chevrolet, finishing 14th. He competed in the next race at Rockingham and finished 20th. He drove full-time in 1989 driving the No. 8 Lighting & Fans-sponsored Buick for FILMAR Racing. He finished 11th in points and won his only career Busch race at Richmond International Raceway. He made his Winston Cup debut in a \"Days of Thunder\" car owned by Hendrick Motorsports. He led five laps but finished 32nd after an engine failure. He matched his 11th-place points finish in 1990 with FILMAR, when he was promoted to Winston Cup full-time. He drove the No. 68 Country Time Lemonade-sponsored Oldsmobile for Tri-Star Motorsports, posting four Top 10 finishes and narrowly defeating Ted Musgrave for Rookie of the Year.\n\nIn 1992, he had two Top 10s and finished 25th in points. He began 1993 with Tri-Star but was released early in the season. He spent the rest of the season in the Cup and Busch Series, posting two Top 10s for Akins-Sutton Motorsports. Hamilton also made five Busch Series starts in the No. 05 Key Motorsports Chevrolet. In 1994, he joined SABCO Racing to driving the No. 40 Kendall Motor Oil-sponsored Pontiac Grand Prix. He had just one Top 10 finish and left at the end of the season.\n\nFor the 1995 season, Hamilton moved to Petty Enterprises to drive the No. 43 STP-sponsored Pontiac. He posted 10 Top 10s and moved up to 14th in the final standings. The next season, he finished a career-best ninth in the points standings and won his first race at Phoenix, the first for Petty Enterprises since 1983. He also formed his own Craftsman Truck Series team and began competing in the series part-time. He won at Rockingham in 1997, but departed the team after falling to 16th in points.\n\nHe then signed with Morgan-McClure Motorsports in 1998 and in their eighth race together, he won from the pole at Martinsville Speedway. He ended the season, finishing 10th in the points. He had another ten Top 10 finish in 2000 and finished that season off 30th in points. He left for Andy Petree Racing to drive the No. 55 Square D-sponsored Chevy. He won his final career race at Talladega and finished 18th in points. He posted three Top 10s in 2002 but suffered a broken shoulder late in the season, causing him to miss several races.\n\nAlthough his Cup Series run in 2000 was not successful, he made history regardless as he joined Ken Schrader, Terry Labonte, and Mark Martin as one of the drivers to, at that point, win a race in each of NASCAR's Top 3 series when he won a Craftsman Truck Series race at Martinsville.\n\nDue to the injury as well as an unstable financial situation at Petree Racing, Hamilton left the Winston Cup Series for the Truck Series driving for his own team, taking the Square D sponsorship with him. Driving the No. 4 Dana Dodge Ram Hamilton picked up two wins in his first year on the circuit and finished sixth in points. The following season, he picked up four wins and clinched the championship, marking the first time since Alan Kulwicki's championship in 1992 that an owner-driver won a NASCAR championship. He switched to the No. 04 in 2005.\n\nIn 2005, he started his Truck series season with a bizarre finish. He led the final laps of the 2005 Dodge Dealers 250 at Daytona International Speedway when Jimmy Spencer got by with a few laps left and the white flag flew just before a crash occurred in turn 1. During the accident, Hamilton passed Spencer for the lead. Due to the scoring loop rules before the accident it was initially believed that Spencer won. Spencer drove to victory circle but not long afterwards it was determined that Hamilton won; Hamilton was at the final scoring loop as he was in the lead.\n\nHamilton later won at Mansfield and went on his way to another sixth-place points finish.\n\nHe drove the No. 18 Fastenal Dodge for three races in 2006, but was diagnosed with cancer and never raced again, with his son finishing out the season.\n\nOn March 17, 2006, Hamilton announced that he had been diagnosed with head and neck cancer. He took part in the Craftsman Truck Series race that night, before starting therapy the following Monday.\n\nKyle Busch paid tribute to Hamilton two months later for the Truck race at Lowe's Motor Speedway by driving a truck painted to resemble the Rowdy Burns car in \"Days of Thunder\", complete with the No. 51 and \"Rowdy\" decals, a tribute that Busch continues today in late model and truck racing.\n\nHamilton returned to the track for the race at Kentucky Speedway, overseeing his team's operations. Knowing he would not be well enough to drive in 2007, he hired Ken Schrader to drive his No. 18 Fastenal-sponsored Dodge for the full 2007 schedule while Hamilton continued his cancer treatment. Hamilton died on January 7, 2007 at his home in Mt. Juliet, Tennessee with his family by his side.\n\n\n"}

They were to have joined the American West Baseball League, but left the league due to a fallout with the league's founder and C.E.O. Michael Cummings. They were sold to Godfather Media, Inc. in 2012 and had announced a name change to the Yuma Panthers, but they never played. They were sold to Tim Ferguson for 2013 and renamed the Desert Rats, but they never played either.\n\nThe team also played as the Scorpions in the Arizona Winter League from 2007 to 2011.\n\nThe Yuma Scorpions were one of the Golden Baseball League charter members in 2005 along with the Chico Outlaws, Fullerton Flyers, Long Beach Armada and San Diego Surf Dawgs in California; Mesa Miners and Surprise Fightin' Falcons in Arizona and the Japan Samurai Bears, the league's first (and so far only) traveling team. The Panthers, along with the Outlaws, Armada and Flyers remain the only charter teams still active in the league.\n\nThe team replaced the former Bullfrogs as the city of Yuma's professional baseball team. The Bulldogs played in the defunct Western Baseball League from 2000 to 2002, but folded after being financially unsuccessful and leaving a legacy of lawsuits and a trail of unpaid bills, players and employees. Other baseball teams are the Yuma Desert Dawgs of the defunct Golden State League (1995–96) and American West Leagues (1997–99). The San Diego Padres inhabited Desert Sun Stadium as their spring training complex and used it from 1968 to 1994 before they went to a new facility in Peoria, Arizona.\n\nOn May 20, 2009 the \"Yuma Sun\" reported that the team had signed an affiliation agreement with the Colombian Professional Baseball League (CPBL), a league owned by Edgar and Edinson Rentería. Edgar played for the San Francisco Giants of Major League Baseball at the time of the signing. Under the terms of the affiliation, the CPBL handled all on-field personnel and player issues while the team retained control of promotions, concessions, and other front-office business. The Scorpions acted as a farm team for all four CPBL teams. It was reported by some news outlets to be the first time an independent American baseball club had formed an affiliation with a foreign team or league, however, in 1972 and 1973 the California League's team based in Lodi, California had an affiliation with Nippon Professional Baseball's Nishitetsu Lions. Yuma's partnership with the CPBL was at one point reportedly being made into a feature story for ESPN.\n\nIn early 2010 the \"Yuma Sun\" reported that the Scorpions had ended their affiliation with the CPBL, but had signed a new three-year affiliation agreement with the Venezuelan Baseball Federation (VBF).\n\nThe move was also portrayed as one that would improve the Scorpions on-field performance. Under the affiliation with the CPBL, the Scorpions went 29-47, worst in the GBL, including a 3-13 start. Several factors justify this assertion. Baseball is more popular in Venezuela than Colombia, leading to the Sun to speculate that that country will provide superior prospects to the CPBL agreement. Additionally, the previous agreement with the CPBL was only concluded hours before the start of the season, so that players had to literally get on a plane in Colombia, got off in Yuma and immediately play the season opener. The agreement with the VBF was agreed to three months prior to the start of the 2010 season. The Scorpions' Manager for 2010, Darryl Brinkley, had experience playing in Venezuela.\n\nThe Scorpions were one of six former GBL teams to join the newly formed North American League in 2010 and began play in 2011.\n\nOn April 11, 2011, Jose Canseco and his twin brother, Ozzie, were added to the teams' roster, with Jose being a manager.\nIn August of that year, 52-year-old former Major League player and then-Scorpions infielder Tony Phillips was involved in an altercation with former Scorpions manager Mike Marshall, then with the Chico Outlaws. Phillips punched Marshall in the face during the incident, causing the latter to press battery charges against the infielder.\n\nThe team was sold to Godfather Media, Inc on January 31, 2012. The new owners announced they would be changing the team name to Yuma Panthers shortly thereafter on February 8, in time for the 2012 season. Additionally they announced that former Major League shortstop Garry Templeton would be replacing Canseco as field manager. The Arizona Winter League team is still known as the Scorpions.\n\nOn April 27, 2012, Godfather Media, LLC C.E.O. Michael Cummings announced that the Panthers were withdrawing from the North American League and were sitting out the 2012 season along with a team they acquired, the Orange County Flyers.\n\nIn 2012, Godfather Media, then owners of the Panthers, started a new league called the American West Baseball League and entered the Panthers as a member team.\n\nThe team was then sold to local investor Tim Ferguson and the name changed again. This time, becoming the Desert Rats. However, before they could throw a pitch, the team folded after Ferguson and the AWBL parted ways.\n\nGolden Baseball League:\nNorth American League:\n\n"}

They began as a member of the Arizona Division of the now-defunct Golden Baseball League in 2005. The original team became known as the Reno Silver Sox in 2006, and then the Tucson Toros in 2009, but the league could bring the Miners back as an expansion team should they decide to do so.\n\nThey returned to play in 2011 after a six-year absence as a member of the Arizona Summer League, one of two instructional leagues affiliated with the North American League, which is not affiliated with either Major League Baseball \"or\" Minor League Baseball.\n\nThe Miners started as one of eight charter teams in the GBL along with the Chico Outlaws, Fullerton Flyers, Long Beach Armada and San Diego Surf Dawgs in California, the Surprise Fightin' Falcons and Yuma Scorpions in Arizona and a traveling team, the Japan Samurai Bears that began play in May 2005. All teams were league-owned and the team names and logos also belong to the league. In their one year of play, the team won the first ever GBL Arizona Division title and played in the Championship Game against the Surf Dawgs.\n\nUnfortunately, the Miners had the league's worst overall attendance, (which is somewhat dubious because of the highly inflated attendance numbers that the Fightin' Falcons allegedly received) and was dropped from the Golden Baseball League in November 2005. The league dropped Surprise largely due to not having another team in central Arizona and to give the league an even number of six teams instead of seven. The low attendance numbers both teams received were due largely to the fact that many of their home games were played in the scorching afternoon heat of central Arizona. The Miners roster and coaching staff were carried over to the league's new Reno Silver Sox team, which won the League Championship in 2006. The franchise has since been purchased and relocated to Tucson, Arizona, and has been renamed the Tucson Toros.\n\nThe GBL has said publicly that they would reconsider the Arizona market (Mesa and Surprise) if the league, the city of Mesa and the concessionaire at HoHoKam Park could agree on a revenue sharing agreement for concessions sales. In 2005 the Miners received none of the sales proceeds from their own games. The Miners were the only team in the league without revenue sharing on concessions. HoHoKam Park has played host to the Arizona Fall League's Mesa Solar Sox since 1992.\n\nShould the Miners return to Mesa, they would be an expansion team since the original team was absorbed by the Silver Sox. The Miners name, logo and uniforms (owned by the league) have been used by the Western Canada Miners of the Arizona Winter League, the NAL's instructional league started by the GBL in 2007.\n\nIf the brand does not return to Mesa, some suggest that the new expansion franchise which adopts the \"Miners\" identity should be placed in possibly Canada because of the history of mining in the western part of the country. Other suggest California for the obvious state nickname of the \"Golden State\".\n\nAfter one season representing Bisbee, Arizona, the Miners' representation was returned to Mesa as the team returned to play as the newest member of the Arizona Summer League in July 2011. They joined fellow former Golden Baseball League teams the Long Beach Armada and San Diego Surf Dawgs in the league as well as Arizona Winter League's Team Canada.\n\n"}

The band reached its biggest success with the single \"There but for the Grace of God Go I\", which became a disco hit in 1979.\n\nThe band was formed by singer Jay Stovall in 1977 New York City with the intent to create the disco equivalent of R&B message songs.\n\nThe band released its self-titled debut album in 1979, which produced its most famous single \"There but for the Grace of God Go I\". The song describes two Latino parents named Carlos and Carmen Vidal who move out of the Bronx to protect their baby daughter. In their new surroundings, their daughter is cut off from her own heritage and becomes self-destructive from the Vidals' cosseting. When the daughter grows up, her parents find she is the type of person from whom all their peers are trying to protect their own children. It ends with the mother's conclusion that \"Too much love is worse than none at all.\" The song ended up being censored twice: the original lyrics in the 3rd verse \"Popping Pills and Smoking Weed\" were changed to \"Gaining Weight and Losing Sleep\" and later the first verse lyrics \"Let's Find a Place they say, Somewhere Far Away, with No Blacks, No Jews and No Gays\" was changed to \"Let's Find a Place they say, Somewhere Far Away, where only upper class people stay\".\n\n\"There but for the Grace of God Go I\" was a hit for the band, reaching number 77 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and spending ten weeks on the chart. In \"\" (1981), Robert Christgau said the song was \"irresistible musically—still the disco disc of [1979]\", although he found the rest of Machine's first album either \"mildly arresting musically\" or \"ordinary Isleys-influenced black pop/funk/rock\". \"Slant Magazine\" later named it the sixth greatest dance song, and \"Pitchfork Media\" included it in its collection of \"The Pitchfork 500\".\n\nMachine released its second and final album \"Moving On\" in 1980 with two accompanying singles, but the album suffered from poor sales. The group disbanded the following year, and August Darnell went on to form Kid Creole and the Coconuts, who released a cover of \"There but for the Grace of God Go I\" in 1980. In 2009, three of the band's original members, Jay Stovall, Kevin Nance, and Clare Bathé, reformed the act for a tour.\n\n\n\nAn altered version of \"There but for the Grace of God Go I,\" was featured in the 2016 Netflix series \"The Get Down\". In season 1, episode 2 (\"Seek Those Who Fan Your Flames\"), Mylene Cruz (portrayed by Herizen F. Guardiola) enlists the help of Ezekiel \"Zeke\" Figuero (portrayed by Justice Smith) to write a song for her church solo so that she may impress music producer Jackie Moreno (portrayed by Kevin Corrigan). The song that Zeke writes is untitled, but it is known that it is \"There but for the Grace of God Go I,\" as Zeke muses aloud on the lyrics. Mylene gives a powerful introduction to the song, seemingly overtaken by the Holy Spirit, and the chorus is chanted/sung in Spanish (\"antes de la gloria de Dios, ay voy yo\") by Mylene and a few members of the choir before she launches into the song in English, with piano accompaniment by Zeke. The lyrics were changed in this version; for instance, \"let's find a place they say, somewhere far away, with no Blacks, no Jews and no gays\" was changed to \"let's find a place to stay, somewhere far away, where they do and play and sing as they may.\"\n\nJay Stovall appeared in 2017 on \"The People's Court \" in episode titled \"Sizzling Mad Disco Singer\".\n\nThe song was featured in \"\".\n"}

A company of colonial militia from Virginia under the command of Lieutenant Colonel George Washington, and a small number of Mingo warriors led by Tanacharison (also known as \"Half King\"), ambushed a force of 35 Canadiens under the command of Joseph Coulon de Villiers de Jumonville.\n\nA larger French Canadien force had driven off a small crew attempting to construct a British fort under the auspices of the Ohio Company at present-day Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, land claimed by the French. A British colonial force led by George Washington was sent to protect the fort under construction. The French Canadians sent Jumonville to warn Washington about encroaching on French-claimed territory. Washington was alerted to Jumonville's presence by Tanacharison, and they joined forces to ambush the Canadien camp. Washington's force killed Jumonville and some of his men in the ambush, and captured most of the others. The exact circumstances of Jumonville's death are a subject of historical controversy and debate.\n\nSince Britain and France were not then at war, the event had international repercussions, and was a contributing factor in the start of the Seven Years' War in 1756. After the action, Washington retreated to Fort Necessity, where Canadien forces from Fort Duquesne compelled his surrender. The terms of Washington's surrender included a statement (written in French, a language Washington did not read) admitting that Jumonville was assassinated. This document and others were used by the French and Canadiens to level accusations that Washington had ordered Jumonville's slaying.\n\nThroughout the 1740s and early 1750s, British and Canadien traders had increasingly come into contact in the Ohio Country, including the upper watershed of the Ohio River in what is now western Pennsylvania. Authorities in New France became more aggressive in their efforts to expel British traders and colonists from this area, and in 1753 began construction of a series of fortifications in the area.\n\nThe French action drew the attention of not just the British, but also the Indian tribes of the area. Despite good Franco-Indian relations, British traders had become highly successful in convincing the Indians to trade with them in preference to the Canadiens, and the planned large-scale advance was not well received by all. In particular, Tanacharison, a Mingo chief also known as the \"Half King\", became decidedly anti-French as a consequence. In a meeting with Paul Marin de la Malgue, commander of the French and Canadien construction force, the latter reportedly lost his temper, and shouted at the Indian chief, \"I tell you, down the river I will go. If the river is blocked up, I have the forces to burst it open and tread under my feet all that oppose me. I despise all the stupid things you have said.\" He then threw down some wampum that Tanacharison had offered as a good will gesture. Marin died not long after, and command of the operations was turned over to Jacques Legardeur de Saint-Pierre.\n\nVirginia Royal Governor Robert Dinwiddie sent militia Major George Washington to the Ohio Country (a territory that was claimed by several of the British colonies, including Virginia) as an emissary in December 1753, to tell the French to leave. Saint-Pierre politely informed Washington that he was there pursuant to orders, that Washington's letter should have been addressed to his commanding officer in Canada, and that he had no intention of leaving.\n\nWashington returned to Williamsburg and informed Governor Dinwiddie that the French refused to leave. Dinwiddie commissioned Washington a lieutenant colonel, and ordered him to begin raising a militia regiment to hold the Forks of the Ohio, a site Washington had identified as a fine location for a fortress. The governor also issued a captain's commission to Ohio Company employee William Trent, with instructions to raise a small force and immediately begin construction of the fort. Dinwiddie issued these instructions on his own authority, without even asking for funding from the Virginia House of Burgesses until after the fact. Trent's company arrived on site in February 1754, and began construction of a storehouse and stockade with the assistance of Tanacharison and the Mingos. That same month a force of 800 Canadien militia and French troupes de la marine departed Montreal for the Ohio River valley under the command of the Canadien Claude-Pierre Pécaudy de Contrecœur, who took over command from Saint-Pierre. When Contrecœur learned of Trent's activity, he led a force of about 500 men (troupes de la marine, militia, and Indians) to drive them off (rumors reaching Trent's men put its size at 1,000). On April 16, Contrecœur's force arrived at the forks; the next day, Trent's force of 36 men, led by Ensign Edward Ward in Trent's absence, agreed to leave the site. The French then began construction of the fort they called Fort Duquesne.\n\nIn March 1754, Governor Dinwiddie ordered Washington back to the frontier with instructions to \"act on the [defensive], but in Case any Attempts are made to obstruct the Works or interrupt our [settlements] by any Persons whatsoever, You are to restrain all such Offenders, & in Case of resistance to make Prisoners of or kill & destroy them\". Historian Fred Anderson describes Dinwiddie's instructions, which were issued without the knowledge or direction of the British government in London, as \"an invitation to start a war\". Washington was ordered to gather up as many supplies and paid volunteers as he could along the way. By the time he left for the frontier on April 2, he had recruited fewer than 160 men.\n\nAlong their march through the forests of the frontier, Washington was joined by more men at Winchester. At this point he learned from Captain Trent of the French advance. Trent also brought a message from Tanacharison, who promised warriors to assist the British. To keep Tanacharison's support, Washington decided not to turn back, choosing instead to advance. He reached a place known as the Great Meadows (now in Fayette County, Pennsylvania), about south of the forks, began construction of a small fort and awaited further news or instructions.\n\nContrecœur operated under orders that forbade attacks by his force unless they were provoked. On May 23, he sent Joseph Coulon de Villiers de Jumonville with 35 soldiers (principally Canadien recruits, but also including French recruits and officers) to see if Washington had entered French territory, and with a summons to order Washington's troops out; this summons was similar in nature to the one Washington had delivered to them four months earlier.\n\nOn May 27, Washington was informed by Christopher Gist, a settler who had accompanied him on the 1753 expedition, that a Canadien party numbering about 50 was in the area. In response, Washington sent 75 men with Gist to find them. That evening, Washington received a message from Tanacharison, informing him that he had found the Canadien camp, and that the two of them should meet. Despite the fact that he had just sent another group in pursuit of the Canadiens, Washington went with a detachment of 40 men to meet with Tanacharison. The Mingo leader had with him 12 warriors, two of whom were boys. After discussing the matter, the two leaders agreed to make an attack on the Canadiens. The attackers took up positions behind rocks around the Canadien camp, counting not more than 40 Canadiens.\n\nExactly what happened next has been a subject of controversy and debate. The few primary accounts of the affair agree on a number of facts, and disagree on others. They agree that the battle lasted about 15 minutes, that Jumonville was killed, and that most of his party were either killed or taken prisoner. According to Canadian records, most of the dead were Canadiens: Desroussel and Caron from Québec City, Charles Bois from Pointe-Claire, Jérôme from La Prairie, L'Enfant from Montréal, Paris from Mille-Isles, Languedoc and Martin from Boucherville, and LaBatterie from Trois-Rivières.\n\nWashington's accounts of the battle exist in several versions; they are consistent with each other, but the details are compressed, according to historian Fred Anderson, with intent to obscure post-battle atrocities. He wrote in his diary, \"We were advanced pretty near to them ... when they discovered us; whereupon I ordered my company to fire ... [Wagonner's] Company ... received the whole Fire of the French, during the greatest Part of the Action, which only lasted a Quarter of an Hour, before the Enemy was routed. We killed Mr. de Jumonville, the commander ... also nine others; we wounded one, and made Twenty-one Prisoners\".\nContrecœur prepared an official report of the action that was based on two sources. Most of it came from a Canadien named Monceau who escaped the action but apparently did not witness Jumonville's slaying: Contrecœur's second source was an Indian from Tanacharison's camp, who reported that \"Mr. de Jumonville was killed by a Musket-Shot in the Head, whilst they were reading the Summons\". The same Indian claimed that the Indians then rushed in to prevent the British from slaughtering the Frenchmen.\n\nA third account was made by a private named John Shaw who was in Washington's regiment, but not present at the affair. His account, based on detailed accounts from others who were present, was made in a sworn statement on August 21; the details on Tanacharison's role in the affair are confirmed in a newspaper account printed on June 27. In his account, the French were surrounded while some still slept. Alerted by a noise, one of the Frenchmen \n\nHistorian Anderson documents a fourth account, by a deserter from the British–Indian camp named Denis Kaninguen; Anderson speculates that he was one of Tanacharison's followers. His report to the French commanders echoed that of Shaw: \"notwithstanding the discharge of musket fire that [Washington] had made upon him, he [Washington] intended to read [the summons] and had withdrawn himself to his people, whom he had [previously] ordered to fire upon the French[. T]hat [Tanacharison], a savage, came up to [the wounded Jumonville] and had said, \"Tu n'es pas encore mort, mon père!\" [Thou art not yet dead, my father!] and struck several hatchet blows with which he killed him.\" Anderson notes that Kaninguen apparently understood what Tanacharison said, and understood it to be a ritual slaying. Kaninguen reported that 30 men were taken prisoner, and 10 to 12 had been killed. The Virginians suffered only one killed and two or three wounded.\n\nWashington wrote a letter to his brother after the battle, in which he said \"I can with truth assure you, I heard bullets whistle and believe me, there was something charming in the sound.\" Following the battle, Washington returned to the Great Meadows and pushed onward the construction of a fort, which was called Fort Necessity. The dead were left on the field or buried in shallow graves, where they were later found by the French.\n\nOn June 28, 1754, a combined force of 600 French, Canadien and Indian soldiers under the command of Jumonville's brother, Louis Coulon de Villiers, left Fort Duquesne. On July 3, they captured Fort Necessity in the Battle of the Great Meadows, forcing Washington to negotiate a withdrawal under arms. The capitulation document Washington signed, which was written in French (a language Washington did not know how to read, and which may have been poorly translated for him), included language claiming that Jumonville and his men were assassinated.\n\nWhen news of the two battles reached England in August, the government of the Duke of Newcastle, after several months of negotiations, sent an army expedition the following year to dislodge the French. Major General Edward Braddock was chosen to lead the expedition. He was defeated at the Battle of the Monongahela, and the French remained in control of Fort Duquesne until 1758, when an expedition under General John Forbes finally succeeded in taking the fort.\nWord of the British military plans leaked to France well before Braddock's departure for North America, and King Louis XV dispatched a much larger body of troops to Canada in 1755. Although they arrived too late to participate in Braddock's defeat, the French troop presence led to a string of French victories in the following years. In a second British act of aggression, Admiral Edward Boscawen fired on the French ship \"Alcide\" in a naval action on June 8, 1755, capturing her and two troop ships carrying some of those troops. Military matters escalated on both North American soil and at sea until France and Britain declared war on each other in spring 1756, marking the formal start of the Seven Years' War.\n\nBecause of the inconsistent nature of the record of the action, contemporary and historical coverage of it has been easily colored by preferences for one account over another. Francis Parkman, for example, accepted Washington's account, and was highly dismissive of the accounts by Monceau and the Indian.\n\nFrench authorities assembled a dossier of documents to counter British accounts of the affair. Entitled \"Mémoire contenant le précis des faits, avec leurs pièces justificatives, pour servir de réponse aux 'Observations' envoyées par les Ministres d'Angleterre, dans les cours de l'Europe\", a copy was intercepted in 1756, translated, and published as \"A memorial containing a summary view of facts, with their authorities, in answer to observations sent by the English ministry to the courts of Europe\". It used Washington's capitulation statement and other documents, including extracts of Washington's journal taken at Fort Necessity, to suggest that Washington had actually ordered the assassination of Jumonville. But not all Frenchmen agreed with the story: the Chevalier de Lévis called it a \"pretended assassination\". The French story contrasted with that of the British account. Based on Washington's report, the British suggested that Jumonville, rather than being engaged on a diplomatic mission, was spying on them. Jumonville's orders included specific instructions to notify Contrecœur if the summons was read, so that additional forces might be sent if needed.\n\nHistorian Fred Anderson theorizes about the reasons for Tanacharison's action in the killing, and provides a possible explanation for why one of Tanacharison's men reports the event as a British killing of a Frenchman. Tanacharison had lost influence over some of the local tribes (specifically the Delawares), and may have thought that conflict between the British and French would bring them back under his influence as allies of the British. According to Parkman, after the Indians scalped the French, they sent a scalp to the Delawares, in essence offering them the opportunity to \"take up the hatchet\" with the British and against the French.\n\nA portion of the battlefield, along with the Great Meadows where Fort Necessity was located, has been preserved as a part of Fort Necessity National Battlefield. Jumonville's name has been given to a Christian retreat center near the site. The non-profit Braddock Road Preservation Association, named for the road General Braddock constructed to reach Fort Duquesne, sponsors research and promotes the French and Indian War history of the area.\n\n\n"}

They were based in the Arizona Division. The team, which existed for one season, played all of its games on the road in order to keep an even number of teams in the league.\n\nThe manager of the team was Warren Cromartie (aka \"Cro\"), an American who had played for a number of years in the Japanese Nippon Professional Baseball league. The team was almost entirely made of players from Japan, but did include some US-born players of Japanese descent to fill out the roster.\n\nThe Samurai Bears were one of eight charter teams in the Golden Baseball League that began play in 2005 joining the likes of the Chico Outlaws, Fullerton Flyers, Long Beach Armada and San Diego Surf Dawgs of California; the Mesa Miners, Surprise Fightin' Falcons and Yuma Scorpions of Arizona. They were the first, and so far only, \"traveling team\" in league history. They replaced the Tijuana Toros, who were supposed to be one of the original eight teams, but who were unable to play due to the Baja California State Government seizing their stadium with police troops and turning it over to the Mexican League a few months before the start of the GBL season.\n\nIn their only season, the Samurai Bears finished last in the Arizona division with a league worst 33-57 record. Though the team struggled, there were some bright spots for the season. They had 3 pitchers (Hideki Nagasaka, Takaaki Igarashi, and Rentaro Seki) on the Arizona Division all-star team. First baseman Yuji Nerei was a Gold Glove winner and led the team in home runs and RBI, in addition to several other offensive categories.

It is 10–15 driving minutes from downtown and has scheduled service to the city of Calgary, Alberta. The airport is classified as an airport of entry by Nav Canada and is staffed by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) on a call-out basis from the Sweetgrass-Coutts Border Crossing. CBSA officers at this airport can handle general aviation aircraft only, with no more than 15 passengers. The airport hosts the biennial Lethbridge International Airshow.\n\nOriginally known as Kenyon Field, this aerodrome began passenger services in October 1938, but officially opened in June 1939. Prior to this, the city operated aviation activities in areas now occupied by Exhibition Park and Lethbridge Collegiate Institute.\n\nFrom 1939 to 1948, Lethbridge operated as western Canada's primary airline hub. According to the Trans-Canada Air Lines (TCA) system timetable dated January 1, 1940, Lethbridge was a stop on Trans-Canada's transcontinental flights linking Montreal, Ottawa, Winnipeg, Regina and Vancouver with connecting service to and from Toronto via North Bay (which was one of the stops on the TCA transcontinental flights between Montreal and Vancouver) operated with Lockheed piston engine twin prop aircraft. This same timetable also lists connecting TCA service between Lethbridge and Calgary and Edmonton. U.S. air carrier Western Air Lines served Lethbridge at this time as well with flights to Salt Lake City with connecting service to Las Vegas and Los Angeles. Western operated Boeing 247D twin prop aircraft with a routing of Lethbridge-Cut Bank-Great Falls-Helena-Butte-Idaho Falls-Pocatello-Salt Lake City. According to the route map in the above referenced timetable, Lethbridge was the only international destination served by Western at this time.\n\nIn approximately 1942 the aerodrome was listed at with a Var. 22 degrees E and elevation of . Four runways were listed as follows:\n\nAt the outbreak of World War II, Kenyon Field became a training facility under the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan (BCATP). The station was operated and administered by the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) and called RCAF Station Lethbridge. Beginning in July 1940, the aerodrome hosted No. 5 Elementary Flying Training School (EFTS). Instruction was provided by members of the local flying club. Since the airport often experienced significant wind, the flying school moved to less windy High River in June 1941.\n\nLate in 1941, the No. 8 Bombing and Gunnery School, also a BCATP training facility, opened at the station. Since land was required for gunnery and bombing practice, about was leased from the Blood Indian Reserve located nearby. Aircraft used by this school included Fairey Battles, Lysanders, Ansons, and Bolingbrokes.\n\nNo. 133 (Fighter) Squadron was formed here in June 1942, flying Hurricanes and Harvards. The squadron moved to Boundary Bay Airport, British Columbia in October 1942. The RCAF left Lethbridge in 1944.\n\nIn 1947, the RCAF's mess hall was converted by the Department of Transportation (now Transport Canada) into an air terminal building, which was replaced by the current facility in 1979.\n\nBy 1962, passenger flights operated by Trans-Canada Air Lines had become more regional in nature. According to Trans-Canada's system timetable dated April 29, 1962, the airline was operating Vickers Viscount turboprop service on a routing of Lethbridge-Calgary-Edmonton and was also flying Douglas DC-3 service with a routing of Lethbridge-Medicine Hat-Swift Current-Regina-Yorkton-Brandon-Winnipeg. Trans Canada would become Air Canada which in turn continued to operate Vickers Viscount turboprop service on the Lethbridge-Calgary-Edmonton route before ceasing all scheduled passenger service to Lethbridge during the early 1970s.\n\nTime Air was a regional airline that initiated operations in Lethbridge. Founded in 1966 as Lethbridge Air Service, Time Air flew a variety of turboprop aircraft and also operated jet service as well with Fokker F28 Fellowship twin jets. In February 1976, the Official Airline Guide (OAG) listed up to eight round trip flights a day operated by Time Air nonstop between Lethbridge and Calgary with Fokker F27 Friendship and de Havilland Twin Otter turboprops. According to the November 15, 1979 edition of the OAG, Time Air was operating up to ten flights a day nonstop to Calgary with DHC-6 Twin Otter and Short 330 turboprop aircraft. By April 1985, the airline was operating larger Dash 7 turboprops on the Lethbridge-Calgary route in addition to the Short 330 aircraft with up to nine flights a day. In 1995, Time Air was flying the Fokker F28 twin jet on a daily basis between Calgary and Lethbridge in addition to other flights operated on the route with Dash 8 turboprops. This appears to have been one of the few times that Lethbridge had scheduled passenger jet service. Time Air was also flying at this time as a Canadian Partner air carrier as part of a code sharing agreement with Canadian Airlines International (formerly CP Air). There was also competition on the Lethbridge-Calgary route at this time as Air BC was operating Dash 8 turboprops as an Air Canada Connector air carrier via a code sharing agreement with Air Canada. Air BC also operated British Aerospace BAe Jetstream 31 between Lethbridge and Calgary at one point. Time Air operated other flights as well from Lethbridge including direct service to Vancouver via an intermediate stop in either Kelowna or Penticton, British Columbia during the 1980s and also nonstop service in 1988 to Great Falls, Montana. In 1993, Time Air and Ontario Express began operating as Canadian Regional Airlines on behalf of Canadian Airlines International which then eventually acquired Time Air and merged the airline with Ontario Express. By 1999, Time Air was operating Dash 8 turboprops as well as Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner on its flights to Calgary as Canadian Regional while Alberta Citylink was flying BAe Jetstream 31 turboprops on its services to Calgary as Air Canada Connector.\n\nLethbridge County assumed ownership of the airport on January 1, 1997, and it was renamed Lethbridge County Airport .\n\nOn July 26, 2009, the Evergreen Supertanker successfully landed and took off from runway 05 as part of the 2009 airshow, marking the first time a Boeing 747 has used the airport. On August 1, 2013, the County of Lethbridge approved renaming the airport to Lethbridge Airport.\n\nOn March 16, 2018, Lethbridge County along with the City of Lethbridge agreed to transfer the airport to the City.\n\nThe airport is a Canadian Air Transport Security Authority (CATSA) Designated Aerodrome, thus providing full passenger screening. It also serves as a regional airport, offering a number of on-site charter, maintenance, flight training and specialty aviation services . There are roughly 40 aircraft based at the airport, including commercial, corporate, recreational, flight training, aerial spray and rotary-wing.\n\nBetween 50 and 60 percent of typical annual aircraft movements are flight training and scheduled air carrier services. In 2003, aircraft movements for the year were roughly 30,000 and passenger movements were roughly 55,000.\n\nAircraft services are available through Airwest Flight Support and Southern Aero Aviation/Lethbridge Esso . Both offer Avgas 100LL, Jet A1 FSII, GPU, de-icing, a pilot lounge, hangarage, and tie downs. Airwest also provides inspections, repairs, and aircraft sales, and Southern Aero also provides courtesy vehicles, and sleeping quarters. Respectively, frequencies are 130.75 and 123.4, and they are found at aprons 2 and 3.\n\nOn February 7, 2009, a general aviation Cessna 150 crash-landed in a field at the airport. The pilot was landing when a gust of wind apparently overtook the aircraft. The pilot escaped uninjured, however the plane sustained major damage. The crash was investigated by Transport Canada and the Transportation Safety Board.\n\nOn July 23, 2010, a Royal Canadian Air Force McDonnell Douglas CF-18 Hornet crashed during a practice run for the upcoming Alberta International Airshow. The pilot ejected from the aircraft less than 2 seconds before it struck the ground nose first, exploding into a fireball. Captain Brian Bews survived with three compressed vertebrae.\n\n\n\n"}

Named Broken Hill until 1966, it was founded when lead and zinc deposits were discovered in 1902. Kabwe also has a claim to being the birthplace of Zambian politics as it was an important political centre during the colonial period. It is an important transportation and mining centre.\n\nThe name Kabwe or \"Kabwe-Ka Mukuba\" means 'ore' or 'smelting' but the European/Australian prospectors named it Broken Hill after a similar mine in Broken Hill, New South Wales, Australia. The mine was the largest in the country for around thirty years until it was overtaken in the early 1930s by larger copper mining complexes on the Copperbelt. Apart from lead and zinc it also produced silver, manganese and heavy metals such as cadmium, vanadium, and titanium in smaller quantities. \n\nIn 1921 a human fossil, a skull, dubbed \"Kabwe 1\", also \"Broken Hill Man\" or \"Rhodesian Man\" (classified as \"Homo rhodesiensis\" or \"Homo heidelbergensis\") was found in the mine.\n\nThe mine, which occupies a 2.5 km² site 1 km south-west of the town centre, is closed but metals are still extracted from old tailings. A study by the Blacksmith Institute found Kabwe to be one of the ten most polluted places in the world due mostly to heavy metal (mostly zinc and lead) tailings making their way into the local water supply. A 2014 report indicates that children's blood lead levels continue to be elevated even though mining has stopped.\n\nThe first railway in the country, operated by Rhodesian Railways when the territory was administered as North-Western Rhodesia and North-Eastern Rhodesia, reached the Broken Hill mine as early as 1906, and the town became the northern base for the railway, which was the second biggest employer after the mining industry. A locomotive maintenance facility was constructed there. In 1909 the railway reached Ndola in what was to become the Copperbelt. \n\nThe railway workers' unions played a large role in the politics of the country. In racially segregated colonial times before Africans had the vote, the town was the seat of Roy Welensky, leader of the powerful Rhodesia Railway Workers Union (RRWU), who became Prime Minister of the ill-fated Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, which was opposed by the Northern Rhodesia Railway Trade Union (the black Africans' union) led by Dixon Konkola and also based in Kabwe.\nToday, the town is the headquarters of Zambia Railways but employment levels on the railway have been heavily cut.\n\nReflecting Kabwe's central location and railway union base, it was chosen as the site for a rally held on October 26, 1958 at Mulungushi Rock north of the city by the Kaunda-Kapwepwe breakaway group from the Zambian African National Congress. Later, they founded the political party UNIP which led the successful independence movement and continued to hold conferences at Mulungushi Rock, which became known as the 'birthplace of independence' in Zambia.\n\nAs well as being on the main Lusaka-Copperbelt railway line, it lies on the Great North Road.\n\nClosure of the mine led to economic decline for Kabwe. It has a number of manufacturing industries including the Zambia-China Mulungushi Textiles plant established with Chinese investment in the 1980s, but after suffering large losses this plant closed (temporarily according to management) at the beginning of 2007. \n\nOther industries include pharmaceuticals, milling and cotton ginning, and Kabwe's first Drinking Water Plant (Aquador Purifed Water) and leather tanning.\n\nTo the east of the city are the hydro-electric power stations of the Mulungushi Dam, Mita Hills Dam and Lunsemfwa Falls, built to power the mine and town.\n\nCommercial farming areas surround the city about 10 km from the centre, and the road and rail links provide ready access to the markets of the Copperbelt and Lusaka.\n\nTo the east and west of Kabwe are a number of areas with good but so-far undeveloped tourist potential, advantaged by Kabwe's central location and proximity to Lusaka and its international airport:,\n\n\nOn February 7, 2013, a bus collided with two cars near Kabwe, killing 53 people. It was one of the worst road accidents in Zambian history.\n\n\n"}

The league owns the naming rights to the team as well as the other seven original teams. In their only season, they finished 3rd in the Arizona Division with a 46-44 record. The team included the league's first ever MVP, Desi Wilson, who during the year had a league record 30-game hitting streak. Outfielder Billy Brown hit a team high 14 home runs and won a gold glove. The team was managed by Ozzie Virgil, Jr. and their mascot was Luke the Falcon.\n\nThe team, which played for one season, was based in the Arizona Division. Following the league suspending operations and relocation of the Miners in November 2005, the Fightin' Falcons were also dropped from the league partially to achieve a balance of six clubs instead of seven also because of no other teams being based in central Arizona, and the fact that game attendance averaged about 60 spectators per game, and extreme lack of team support.\n\nThe GBL has stated publicly that they would reconsider the Arizona market (Surprise and Mesa) if the league, the city of Mesa and the concessionaire at HoHoKam Park in Mesa could reach agreement on a revenue sharing agreement for concessions sales at Miners games. The Miners were the only team in the league not to receive any funds from concessions sales at their games.\n\nShould the Fightin' Falcons return to the league (which owns the rights to the team), they could be brought back as either an expansion or relocated team and there could be a push to have the team play at Surprise Stadium, the spring training home of the Kansas City Royals and Texas Rangers and home of the Arizona Fall League's Surprise Rafters. That stadium is on the grounds of the Recreation Campus. But nothing is definitive. If not, the team name could be placed with an expansion team elsewhere.\n\nThe team cap logo and colors were being used by the Sonora Pilots of the Arizona Winter League, the GBL's instructional league.

The film is directed by Attila Dargay and written by Attila Dargay, István Imre and Ede Tarbay, and released in 1981. \nA computer animated and widely panned sequel, \"A Fox's Tale\", was released in 2008. \nThe film tells the story of a little fox kit, Vic (Vuk in the original Hungarian version), who ventures away from his family's den and, upon his return, learns from his uncle Karak that his entire family has been shot and killed by a human hunter (called \"Smoothskinner\" in the cartoon). Karak then offers for Vic to stay with him, and Karak continues to raise him.\n\nAs Vic grows older, he develops much cunning and cleverness. Now a young adult fox, he even dares to infiltrate the hunter's house, during which he finds a vixen, named Foxy, held captive in a cage. He tricks the guard dogs and other animals, as well as the hunter himself, and eventually helps the vixen escape by smashing the cage open with a loaded wagon.\n\nFoxy joins Vic and Karak in the woods, but when Autumn comes, Vic's uncle is shot by the hunter during the seasonal hunt. Vic swears revenge on the hunter and finally accomplishes it: first by breaking into the food locker and eating up all the eggs, then taking away all the poultry from the cages while playing many jokes on the hunter's stupid dogs (which results the two dogs to become strays at the end). Eventually, the hunter decides to set up bear-traps around his house, luring Vic with goose roast; however, the two hunting dogs fall into said traps, and the third one seriously injures the hunter himself as well. At the end of the film, Vic and Foxy have cubs of their own.\n\nThe English-language dub of the film, titled simply \"The Little Fox\", was made in 1987 and released in the United States on home video by Celebrity Home Entertainment. The English dub changes Vuk's name to \"Vic\" and his wife's name to \"Foxy,\" although Karak's name remained unchanged.\n\n\nThe film was released on VHS in 1987 by Celebrity Home Entertainment (re-released 4 November 1994).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1929841", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1929841", "title": "Judenplatz", "text": "Judenplatz\n\nJudenplatz (English: \"Jewish Square\") is a town square in Vienna's Innere Stadt that was the center of Jewish life and the Viennese Jewish Community in the Middle Ages. It is located in the immediate proximity of Am Hof square, Schulhof, and Wipplingerstraße. It exemplifies the long and eventful history of the city and the Jewish community focused on this place. Archaeological excavations of the medieval synagogue are viewable underground by way of the museum on the square, Misrachi-Haus. Two sculptural works, a carved relief and several inscribed texts are located around the square that all have subject matter relating to Jewish history. One of these sculptures is a statue of Gotthold Ephraim Lessing. The other is a memorial to Austrian Holocaust Victims, a project based on an idea of Simon Wiesenthal and unveiled in 2000. Created by British artist Rachel Whiteread, the memorial is a reinforced concrete cube resembling a library with its volumes turned inside out.\n\nThe Austrian Supreme Administrative Court has its seat on the square.\n\nJews began settling in Vienna and in the area that was to become Judenplatz around 1150, coinciding with the settlement of the House of Babenberg. The first written mention names named the area \"\"Schulhof\"\" in 1294, a name which lasted until the pogrom of 1421. By the year 1400, 800 inhabitants lived here including merchants, bankers, and scholars. The Jewish city extended north up to the church Maria am Gestade, the west side became Tiefer Graben street, the east side was bounded by Tuchlaubenstreet, and the south side formed the square \"Am Hof\". The Ghetto possessed 70 houses, which were arranged so that their back walls formed a closed delimitation wall. The Ghetto could be entered by four gates, the two main entrances lay on the Wipplingerstrasse.\n\nAt Judenplatz was the Jewish hospital, the Synagogue, the bath house, the house of the Rabbi and the Jewish school- all among the most important in German speaking countries. The synagogue lay between the later Jordangasse and Kurrentgasse streets. Because of the school the square bore the name \"\"Schulhof\"\" as it was a schoolyard at that time. Later this name was transferred to a smaller square situated in the immediate neighborhood, and the neighborhood is still called so today. The designation \"\"Neuer Platz\"\" was given to the original schoolyard in 1423, and since 1437 it has been called Judenplatz.\n\nIn Vienna under Duke Albrecht V, the persecution of the Jews in the autumn of 1420 grew to a bloody climax in 1421. In the beginning were many imprisonments, with starvations and tortures leading to executions. Children were deprived and deceived into eating unclean foods, those that were defiant were \"sold into slavery\" or baptized against their will. The poor Jews were driven out, while the wealthy were imprisoned. The few Jews still living in freedom took refuge in the Or-Sarua Synagoge at Judenplatz, in what would become a three-day siege, through hunger and thirst, leading to a collective suicide, A contemporary chronicle exists, entitled the \"\"Wiener Geserah\"\", translated from German and Hebrew as the \"Viennese Decree\". It reported that the Rabbi Jonah set the Synagogue on fire for the Jews at Or-Sarua to die as martyrs. This was a form of \"Kiddush Hashem\" in order to escape religious persecution and compulsory baptism.\n\nAt the command of Duke Albrecht V, the approximately two hundred remaining survivors of the Jewish community were accused of crimes such as dealing arms to the Hussites and host desecration and on 12 March 1421 were led to the pyre at the so-called goose pasture (\"Gänseweide\") in Erdberg and burned alive. The Duke decided at that time that no more Jews would be allowed in Austria henceforth. The properties that were left behind were confiscated, the houses were sold or given away, and the stones of the synagogue were taken for the building of the old Viennese university. However, Jewish settlement in Vienna would not cease as the Duke intended, and a second major ghetto would emerge in Vienna's Leopoldstadt district in the seventeenth century.\n\nIn the middle of the northern end of the square, the Judenplatz Holocaust Memorial stands for the Austrian Jewish victims of the Shoah, made by the English artist Rachel Whiteread. It consists of a 10 by 7 metre block that is 3.8 metres tall. It is located in the northwestern end of the square before the Misrachi-Haus and faces the Lessing Monument in the southeast, with its walls parallel to the length of the square. The memorial is site-specific in many ways and is therefore dependent on the setting of Judenplatz. One facet of this site-specificity is that it was designed at a domestic scale. It was imagined as if one of the surrounding buildings had a room cast inside out and placed in public in the middle of the square. The walls of the memorial resemble library walls of petrified books. However, the spines of the books on the walls are not legible; they all are turned inwards. On a concrete plinth, the names of the 41 places at which Austrian Jews went to their death during Nazi rule are written. Although this \"nameless\" library has a symbolic entrance, it is not accessible. The memorial stands in close relation with the exhibition of the Holocaust that is installed in the neighboring Misrachi-Haus, where the names and data of 65,000 murdered Austrian Jews are documented and accessible through computer terminals.\n\nExcavations were undertaken to establish the Memorial from July 1995 to November 1998; these are considered the most important urban archaeological investigations in Vienna. Uncovered on the eastern half of the square were quarrystone walls, a well and cellars of a whole block from the time of a medieval synagogue. Controversy arose over the placing of the memorial over the archaeological excavations, which resulted in moving the memorial one meter from its original position on the site. The complete reorganization of the square and its transformation to a pedestrian plaza were completed in the autumn of 2000 with the inauguration of the Holocaust memorial.\n\nAt Judenplatz 8 is the Misrachi-Haus. It was built in 1694 and is today a branch of the Jewish Museum Vienna. Under the square archaeologists found, in 1995, the foundation walls of one of Europe's biggest medieval synagogues and exposed them. With the archaeological findings came the idea to unite the memorial and excavations into a commemorative museum complex.\n\nThe erection of a museum sector in the Misrachi-Haus was conceived in 1997 to supplement the show area at Judenplatz 8. In addition to the archaeological findings, exhibitions by a branch of the Jewish Museum Vienna would document Jewish life in the Middle Ages as well as the data base produced by the Documentation Archive of the Austrian Resistance with the names and fates of Austrian Holocaust victims.\n\nIn the exhibition, importance is particularly attached to the circumstances of the Jews in \"\"Wiener Geserah\"\", the pogrom in the year 1421. Remains of the synagogue from before the pogrom are to be seen in three areas; these consist of the men's teaching and praying area called the \"men's shul\", a cultivated smaller area that was used by the women, and the foundation of the hexagonal bimah, the elevated platform for Torah reading.\n\nIn the center of the southern end of the square is the monument to the German poet Gotthold Ephraim Lessing created by Siegfried Charoux (1896-1967). Charoux won the commission in 1930 in a competition with eighty two other sculptors. The monument was completed in 1931/32, unveiled in 1935, and soon removed in 1939 by the National Socialists to be melted down for the purpose of making weaponry. Lessing was in Vienna in 1775/76, had an audience with Joseph II., and was therefore in a position to influence and shape the Viennese cultural climate. Lessing's \"\"Ringparabel\"\" in the drama \"\"Nathan der Weise\"\" is considered a key text of the Enlightenment and helped in the formulation of the idea of tolerance. From 1962 to 65, Charoux created a second Lessing monument out of bronze, that was unveiled at Ruprechtskirche in 1968 and moved to Judenplatz in 1981. This is the monument that stands on the square today.\n\nThe former Bohemian Court Chancellery (\"Böhmische Hofkanzlei\"), Judenplatz 11, is the seat of the Austrian Supreme Administrative Court (\"Verwaltungsgerichtshof\").\nThe building was erected from 1709 to 1714 to the designs of Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach. After 1749, the remaining lots of the block were bought up and Matthias Gerl was put in charge of the expansion of the palace from 1751 to 1754, symmetrically doubling the construction westward. Further rebuilding took place in the 19th century, the palace essentially received its present-day look at that time. The façade on Judenplatz was originally the back of the building, only since changes in the 20th century has the main entrance gate been found there. The female figures over the gates of this building represent the Cardinal virtues (moderation, wisdom, justice and bravery), and above are the coats of arms of Bohemia and Austria. In the middle of the attic line, an angel stands with trombone, at whose feet a Putto crouches. Four vases and two male figures who are presumably Bohemian Kings Wenceslaus I and Wenceslaus II are at the angel's sides.\n\nThe building was originally the official seat of the Bohemian Court Chancellery, which was united organizationally with the Austrian Court Chancellery in 1749. In 1848, occupancy changed to the Ministry of the Interior which remained in the palace until 1923. From 1761 to 82 and 1797 to 1840 resided also the \"Oberste Justizstelle\", the forerunner of the Austrian Supreme Court (\"Oberster Gerichtshof\"). In 1936, the \"Bundesgerichtshof\" moved into the palace, and on 12 March 1945 a part of the building was destroyed by a bomb strike. The rebuilding was under the management of the architect Erich Boltenstern and was completed in 1951.\nFrom 1946 to 2014, the palace was the seat of both the Supreme Administrative Court and the Constitutional Court;\nin 2014, the Constitutional Court moved to the Freyung.\n\n"}
{"id": "1929842", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1929842", "title": "Scottish mythology", "text": "Scottish mythology\n\nScottish mythology is the collection of myths that have emerged throughout the history of Scotland, sometimes being elaborated upon by successive generations, and at other times being rejected and replaced by other explanatory narratives.\n\nThe myths and legends of Scotland have a \"local colour\" as they tell about the way of life during the olden times, apart from giving a perspective of the nature of the country during various seasons of the year. It was the belief that Beira, the Queen of Winter, had a firm hold on the country by raising storms during January and February thus preventing greenery to emerge. She was considered a tough and brutal old woman who stirred the deadly spiraling action of Corryvreckan, ushering snow, as well as torrents resulting in the overflow of rivers. Even the creation of lochs and mountains were attributed to her.\n\nScottish mythology is not like the Greek and Roman myths as it deals with various aspects of nature. In this context the most powerful and feared goddess representing winter is Beira who rules winter for its entire duration. Immediately, the following season she readily concedes to Dual Lord and Lady who then enjoy equal power during the ensuing season. This myth is akin to the popular myth of the Mayans and deals with female power in the \"creation and the cycle of the year\". However, Donald Mackenzie in his book \"Scottish Wonder Tales from Myth and Legend\" states that the goddesses of the Scottish myths are not glorified, very much unlike the goddesses of ancient Greece.\n\nThe rivers in Scotland were considered the dwelling places of goddesses with their characteristic denoting the nature of the river, such as the River Forth being called \"deaf or soundless river\" on account of its silent flow conditions, and the River Clyde called as \"the purifying river\" as it caused scouring and cleansing, carrying \"mud and clay\" during the flood season.\n\n The Celtic goddesses were authoritative and were associated with female fertility as related to female divinity and earth. In olden times the Celtics land and national societies were both linked with the body of the goddess (also attributed as \"tribal goddess\") and her representative on earth was the queen. Another \"ambivalent\" character in Scottish myths was the \"hag\", the Goddess, the Gaelic Cailleach, and the Giantess, a divine being who is harmful. The hag is also considered a \"healer\" and helpful during childbirth and is divine and said to have \"long ancestry and incredible longevity\". She is also known as \"at once creator and destroyer, gentle and fierce, mother and nurturer\".\n\nSeveral origin legends for the Scots arose during the historical period, serving various purposes.\n\nOne Scottish origin legend, or pseudo-historical account of the foundation of the Scottish people, appears in adapted form in the tenth-century Latin \"Life\" of St. Cathróe of Metz. It relates that settlers from Greek Asia Minor sailed the seas and arrived at Cruachan Feli \"the mountain of Ireland\", probably for Cruachan Éli (Croagh Patrick, Co. Mayo), a well-known place in Hiberno-Latin hagiography since Tírechán's \"Collectanea\". As they roamed through Ireland, from Clonmacnoise, Armagh and Kildare to Cork, and finally, to Bangor, they were continually engaged at war with the \"Pictanei\". After some time, they crossed the Irish Sea to invade Caledonia North of Roman Britain, successively capturing Iona, the cities of \"Rigmhonath\" and \"Bellathor\" in the process. The latter places are echoed by the appearance of \"Cinnrígmonaid\" and \"Cinnbelathoir\" in the \"Chronicle of the Kings of Alba\". The territory so conquered was then named Scotia after Scota, the Egyptian wife of Spartan commander Nél or Niul, and St. Patrick converted the people to Christianity.\n\nOnce the Picts adopted Gaelic culture and their actual characteristics faded out of memory, folkloric elements filled the gaps of history. Their \"sudden disappearance\" was explained as a slaughter happening at a banquet given by Kenneth MacAlpin (an international folklore motif) and they were ascribed with powers like those of the fairies, brewing heather from secret recipes and living in underground chambers. In the eighteenth century the Picts were co-opted as a \"Germanic\" race.\nIn the Celtic domains of Scotland, also known as \"Gàidhealtachd\", there were ancient pre-Christian structures. In the farthest end of northwest Scotland there are standing stones at Callanish on the Isle of Lewis, in a vertical position, which are akin to the Stonehenge; these are believed to be older than Stonehenge and are standing for more than 5000 years and said to be denoting sun worship.\n\nBecause of the movement of people from Ulster to west Scotland, which resulted in close linguistic links between Ulster and the west of Scotland, much of Gaelic mythology was imported to Scotland, and possibly some of it was written in Scotland. The Ulster Cycle, set around the beginning of the Christian era, consists of a group of heroic stories dealing with the lives of Conchobar mac Nessa, king of Ulster, the great hero Cúchulainn, and of their friends, lovers, and enemies. These are the Ulaid, or people of the North-Eastern corner of Ireland and the action of the stories centres round the royal court at Emain Macha, close to the modern city of Armagh. The Ulaid had close links with Gaelic Scotland, where Cúchulainn is said to have learned the arts of war.\n\nThe cycle consists of stories of the births, early lives and training, wooings, battles, feastings and deaths of the heroes and reflects a warrior society in which warfare consists mainly of single combats and wealth is measured mainly in cattle. These stories are written for the most part in prose. The centrepiece of the Ulster Cycle is the \"Táin Bó Cúailnge\". Other important Ulster Cycle tales include \"The Tragic Death of Aife's only Son\", \"Fled Bricrenn\" \"Bricriu's Feast\", and \"Togail Bruidne Dá Derga\" \"The Destruction of Da Derga's Hostel\". This cycle is, in some respects, close to the mythological cycle of the rest of the Gaelic speaking world. Some characters from the latter reappear, and the same sort of shape-shifting magic is much in evidence, side by side with a grim, almost callous realism. While it may be supposed that a few characters, such as Medb or Cú Roí, of once being deities, and Cúchulainn in particular displays superhuman prowess, the characters are firmly mortal and rooted in a specific time and place. Scottish Gaelic adaptations of Ulster Cycle tales appear in the Glenmasan manuscript.\n\nThe stories of Finn (Old, Middle, Modern Irish: Find, Finn, Fionn) mac Cumhaill and his band of soldiers the Fianna, appear to be set around the 3rd century in Gaelic Ireland and Scotland. They differ from other Gaelic mythological cycles in the strength of their links with the Gaelic-speaking community in Scotland and there are many extant texts from that country. They also differ from the Ulster Cycle in that the stories are told mainly in verse and that in tone they are nearer to the tradition of romance than the tradition of epic.\n\nThe single most important source for the Fenian Cycle is the \"Acallam na Senórach\" (\"Colloquy of the Old Men\"), which is found in two 15th-century manuscripts, the Book of Lismore and Laud 610, as well as a 17th-century manuscript from Killiney, County Dublin. The text is dated from linguistic evidence to the 12th century. The text records conversations between the last surviving members of the Fianna and Saint Patrick and runs to some 8,000 lines. The late dates of the manuscripts may reflect a longer oral tradition for the Fenian stories, the same oral tradition which was interpreted from Gaelic to English by James Macpherson in the Ossian stories.\n\nThe Fianna of the story are divided into the Clann Baiscne, led by Fionnghall, and the Clann Morna, led by his enemy, Goll mac Morna. Goll killed Fionnghall's father, Cumhal, in battle and the boy Fionn was brought up in secrecy. As a youth, while being trained in the art of poetry, he accidentally burned his thumb while cooking the Salmon of Knowledge, which allowed him to suck or bite his thumb in order to receive bursts of stupendous wisdom. He took his place as the leader of his band and numerous tales are told of their adventures. Two of the greatest Gaelic tales, \"Tóraigheacht Dhiarmada agus Ghráinne\" (The Pursuit of Diarmuid and Gráinne) and \"Oisin in Tír na nÓg\" form part of the cycle. The Diarmuid and Grainne story, which is one of the few Fenian prose tales, is a probable source of Tristan and Iseult.\n\nThe world of the Fenian Cycle is one in which professional warriors spend their time hunting, fighting, and engaging in adventures in the spirit world. New entrants into the band are expected to be knowledgeable in poetry as well as undergo a number of physical tests or ordeals. There is no religious element in these tales unless it is one of hero-worship.\n\n\"The Blue men of the Minch\" (also known as storm kelpies), who occupy the stretch of water between Lewis and mainland Scotland, looking for sailors to drown and stricken boats to sink.\n\n\"Kelpies\" are fabled water-spirits in the Lowland Scotland which are said to assume different shapes. Normally, they appear in the form of a horse. There is another spirit known as water-kelpie which reportedly \"haunts\" lakes and rivers, and indulge in drowning people. It is also reported to help running mills during night hours.\n\n\"Seonaidh\" was a Celtic water-spirit which the residents of Lewis used to worship with offer of a glass of ale. According to Dr. Martin, one night the people of Lewis appeased Seonaidh. They assembled at the church of St. Mulway, each person carried food and necessities needed for the worship. Then, from the bag of malt collected from each family, ale was brewed. Then a chosen member of the congregation waded into the sea to waist deep level holding the ale filled cup, and offered ale to Seonaidh with the prayer: \"I give thee this cup of ale, hoping that thou wilt be so good as to send us plenty of seaware for enriching our ground during the coming year\". This event occurred in the night. After performing the offering the person who made the offering returned to the beach, and all the assembled people moved to the church where at the altar a lighted candle was shining. After some time, when the time was appropriate, the candle was put out. The inhabitants then assembled in a field behind the church and celebrated by drinking ale. They then went back home with the hope that they would be blessed with a surfeit of crops in the coming season.\n\n\"Changeling\" is a fairy tale in which a fairy abducts a baby from the crib and then substitutes with another fairy. It is usually normal and grown up though it appears like a child.\n\n\"Selkies\" are said to live as seals in the sea but shed their skin to become human on land, often to dance in the light of the full moon. If they lose their skin whilst in human form, they will however, be stuck in their human form forever. When taking human form they are said to have beautiful green hair. They will often reside on rocks and islands that are hidden among the waves, in order to protect themselves from humans. Selkies are mortal creatures. The legend is apparently most common in Orkney and Shetland and is very similar to those of swan maidens.\n\n\"Wulvers\" are good natured creatures, similar to werewolves. They are said to leave food for poor families.\n\nMyth is sometimes an aspect of folklore, but not all myth is folklore, nor is all folklore myth or mythological. People who express an interest in mythology are often most focused on non-human (sometimes referred to as \"supernatural\") beings. There have been numerous groups of such entities in Scottish culture, some of them specific to particular ethnic groups (Gaelic, Norse, Germanic, etc.), others of them probably evolving from the circumstances unique to Scotland.\n\nThe Aos-sídhe, Sìdhichean, or \"Fairies\" were originally the pre-Christian divinities of Gaelic Scotland. Christianity began to supersede most original mythology, causing the myths to diminish in power and prominence. The medieval Gaelic literati grouped them together as the Tuatha Dé Danann, who share certain characteristics with other characters in Celtic literature. Folk beliefs about the Banshee also reflect aspects of these beings. There are other supernatural beings whose characteristics reflect folkloric patterns from around the world. Ancestral spirits, and giants who help to form the landscape and represent the forces of nature, are ubiquitous and may point to non-elite registers of mythology.\n\nThe Loch Ness Monster is a legendary aquatic creature reported from many sightings over many years. A popular belief is that the monster is a lone survivor of the \"long-extinct plesiosaurs\". Although the sighting of the monster was reported as far back as the 6th century, in recent times the sightings were reported once the road around the loch was built. The first reporting of sighting of Nessie on land was about 20 yards from the loch as the monster was approaching towards the loch; it was seen by Spicer and his wife on 22 July 1933. In April 1934 a photograph was taken by a London surgeon when he was traveling to Inverness but its authenticity has been disputed. Sightings were even reported during the World War II days in May 1943 by C.B. Farrel of the Royal Observer Corps.\n\nLoch Ness measures and has a width of at the widest. Its depth is and the bed of the loch is flat like a \"bowling green\". The Loch's volume is the largest in Great Britain.\n\nThe first reported sighting of the Loch Ness Monster was in the River Ness in 565 AD. The Irish monk Saint Columba was staying in the land of the Picts with his companions when he came across the locals burying a man by the River Ness. They explained that the man had been swimming the river when he was attacked by a \"water beast\" that had mauled him and dragged him under. They tried to rescue him in a boat, but were able only to drag up his corpse. Hearing this, Columba stunned the Picts by sending his follower Luigne moccu Min to swim across the river. The beast came after him, but Columba made the sign of the cross and commanded: \"Go no further. Do not touch the man. Go back at once.\" The beast immediately halted as if it had been \"pulled back with ropes\" and fled in terror, and both Columba's men and the pagan Picts praised God for the miracle.\n\nMost Arthurian mythology native to Scotland has been passed down through Celtic speech in Scots Gaelic songs like 'Am Bronn Binn'. In Arthurian legend Mordred, nephew of King Arthur, was raised in Orkney and it is speculated that Camelon in Stirlingshire may have been the original 'Camelot'. There is a tradition that Arthur had a Scottish son called Smervie More.\n\n\nCitations\nBibliography\n\n"}

Then realizing that customers may likely still require transport while their own aircraft are being maintained, he also began offering aircraft charter and management services to European and Middle Eastern customers.\n\nIn the 1970s, the company expanded its services to provide aircraft management and charter services for European and Middle Eastern customers. The first maintenance base outside of Switzerland was established in 1975 in Düsseldorf, Germany, and in 1979, a partnership was formed with a group of Saudi businessmen in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to operate an FBO facility in Jeddah. In 1977, Jet Aviation added outfitting services as a new line of business at its Basel operation and the facility has since then grown to become the largest independent completions center in world.\n\n1980s brought further expansion to the company in Europe and the Middle East, but more importantly, Jet Aviation successfully entered the U.S. market to become the first global player in the business aviation industry. Since the mid '80s, the company bought existing FBOs in Boston/Bedford, Massachusetts, Palm Beach, Florida and added a FBO in Teterboro, New Jersey, in 1988 to serve the strategically important New York City corporate marketplace. The same year, Jet Aviation acquired Teterboro based Executive Air Fleet - the largest aircraft management and charter company in North America.\n\nThe consolidation and steady growth in the EMEA region - with the opening of a maintenance and FBO facility in Singapore in 1995. Jet Aviation Basel, Switzerland and the three U.S. FBOs in Boston/Bedford, Palm Beach and Teterboro were expanded to enhance the overall quality and services at these facilities. In 1994, Jet Aviation was granted the right to expand its airline handling services in Zurich and Geneva, Switzerland to provide services to scheduled airlines and IATA carriers. A major move into the Asian market was the opening of a maintenance and FBO facility in Singapore in 1995. Two more locations, including a maintenance facility in Hannover, Germany and a full-service FBO operation in 1999 at Love Field in Dallas, Texas, in the United States were added to Jet Aviation's global network.\n\nIn October 2005 Jet Aviation was acquired by the Permira Funds, which marked the end of 38 years of family entrepreneurship and in March 2006, the company, under new ownership, announced the acquisition of St. Louis, Missouri-based Midcoast Aviation, one of the leading maintenance, repair and overhaul, modifications and completions companies in North America. After almost 40 years as part of the group, Jet Aviation sold its airline and cargo handling division in Switzerland on November 6, 2007 to Dnata, the largest supplier of air travel services in the Middle East. Since December 2007 Jet Aviation also provides line maintenance, defect rectification and AOG services at Moscow's Vnukovo International Airport. In January 2008, Jet Aviation acquired U.S.-based maintenance and completions company Savannah Air Center located at Savannah / Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport. In Spring 2008, Jet Aviation and Beijing-based Deer Air, signed a joint venture to operate a FBO and line maintenance facility at Beijing's Capital International Airport.\n\nNovember 5, 2008 marked another chapter in Jet Aviation's history when the company was acquired by U.S.-based General Dynamics, headquartered in Falls Church, VA. General Dynamics is a market leader in business aviation; land and expeditionary combat systems, armaments and munitions; shipbuilding and marine systems; and information systems and technologies. As part of General Dynamics, Jet Aviation will operate as an independent business unit within the General Dynamics Aerospace Group to continue with its successful business model.\n\nJet Aviation Business Jets Limited is the Hong Kong branch of Jet Aviation. It is based at Hong Kong International Airport, operating non-scheduled passenger services in the region. The branch operates one Bombardier BD-700 Global Express aircraft and two Gulfstream G550 with 15 seats capacity. The branch was established in 2002.\n\nAs of August 2019 Jet Aviation Malta operates 2 Boeing 737-700(BBJ) aircraft.\n\n"}

Imprisoned for running up a 140,000 kronor (US$20,500) bill in one of Sweden's top restaurants and then refusing to pay, Cronin is infamous for a string of sex offences against women, most notably against \"Judy X\", a Conservative Party worker, in May 1992. On 20 March 2013 at Antrim Crown Court, Cronin pleaded guilty to the burglary of Drumalis House (a Retreat and Conference Centre in Antrim) on 15 February 2012 and the theft of money belonging to the Church.\n\nCronin is also the centre of current debate in Scotland over the reporting and handling of sex offenders and how they are dealt with once out of prison.\n\nCronin was born in Edinburgh, the son of Michael Cronin (of Limerick, Ireland) and Jeanette Cronin (of East Lothian, Scotland). Cronin's early years were marked with frequent moves between East Lothian, Limerick, and the U.S. (where the elder Cronin was a member of the U.S. Army). In 1978, the Cronins moved back to East Lothian to care for Jeanette's father, who was ill. It was about this time they discovered that Cronin was in need of assistance.\n\nBy the age of three, he was already difficult for his parents to control, smashing light bulbs and breaking various things in the home. At age five, he was enrolled in a private school, but was expelled shortly thereafter for disruptive behaviour, including overturning desks, urinating on the floor and attacking teachers.\n\nThe remainder of his school years were said by Cronin to be filled with repeated difficulties; the exception to this pattern was between the ages six to eight, where he was educated by nuns at St Margaret's convent in Edinburgh, where he developed a deep respect for the nuns. He went through several schools, where he built up a record for repeat offences at the schools, from theft and assault to openly urinating and defecating on school property. \n\nCronin finally obtained four O-grades at a boarding school in Newton Stewart in 1989. Shortly after leaving the school he committed his first criminal act, sexually assaulting a 14-year-old female classmate, for which he served a three-month sentence.\n\nAround this time Cronin discussed with a social worker his plans to take his father's military records and alter them so that he could join the IRA; it was later revealed that he tried to join another Irish terrorist group around that time.\n\nThere was a period between 1990 and 1992 that he served short prison sentences in Ireland for various crimes.\n\nSometime in the early 1990s, he began to pass himself off as a visiting Irish Catholic priest. His skill was competent enough that he was able to celebrate Mass with and to exploit genuine priests, often stealing from them after being given hospitality. In one case, he stole the purse of a janitor at St. Mary's Cathedral in Edinburgh after having fooled the monsignor present.\n\nIt was this guise he used when entering the home of Judy X, a Conservative Party activist on 21 May 1992. Posing as a priest who wished to donate money to the party, he came in and sexually assaulted her repeatedly as well as beating her with a fireplace poker. Arrested shortly afterwards, his trial was brief, and in August 1992, having been called by the Scottish High Court a \"Walter Mitty gone mad\", Cronin was sentenced to life in prison for the crime. A December 1992 appeal resulted in a six-year prison sentence.\n\nShortly after release from prison in 1997, he was jailed again, this time for making harassing phone calls and threats to various female politicians. By May 2005, he had been jailed repeatedly on various charges from petty theft to fraud to bank robbery in 2001. Cronin was severely bullied by other prisoners whilst serving a two-year sentence in Ireland's Cork Prison for the bank robbery, spending much of the time in voluntary solitary confinement. He was arrested for petty theft only hours after his release.\n\nIn August 2007 he ran up a $20,500 bill at the exclusive Operakällaren restaurant in Stockholm, Sweden. He ordered a three course meal, with a different bottle of wine for each course. When presented with the bill, he told waiters that he could not pay it, and asked them to call the police. He was sentenced to four months jail to be served in Sweden, after which he was deported, and banned from re-entering Sweden for 5 years.\n\nHe was considered enough of a threat that the East Lothian Police set up a special unit to deal exclusively with tracking Cronin.\n\nFrom the earliest points of childhood, Cronin had been involved with mental health specialists.\n\nAt the age of four, he was sent to a child psychologist who later wrote that even from the beginning, \"it was clear he was not one of us.\" Two years later, at age five, he was referred to the family psychiatry department of the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh, where he was considered to be highly aggressive and mercurial.\n\nCronin's school years expanded his psychiatric profile, with numerous instances of disruptive behaviour, most notably a 1987 incident when he was interned for a night at a psychiatric hospital in Edinburgh, after threatening to burn down a homeless shelter. In the case of the hospital stay, he became agitated and repeatedly threw faeces at a nurse.\n\nRobert Waite, a psychiatrist who assessed Cronin in the wake of his first offence, found marked discrepancies in Cronin's intellectual abilities; his verbal skills operated at the university level, while his visual-spatial skills were below average. Cronin had revealed to Waite that he had felt suicidal while serving his sentence for the initial assault. Waite later concluded: \"\"It is clear he has a severe disorder of his personality, which has grossly interfered with his social adjustment and might be expected to do so for some considerable time.\"\" During his discussions with the social worker, Cronin was said to be defiant and arrogant, interested in politics and expressing admiration for Nazism and dictatorship, which he felt was a form of true leadership.\n\nDr. John Baird, whose report on Cronin was instrumental in the initial 1992 life sentence, did a study on him. By this time, Cronin had a long criminal record and was considered by some psychiatrists as untreatable. Baird later wrote: \"Regarding the question of dangerousness, his life-long behaviour pattern has been one of senseless, dishonest, unreliable and unacceptable behaviour. I have not been able to find any evidence of other behaviour similar to that which he displayed on 21 May 1992, when he committed a very serious and sustained sexual assault, nor have I been able to find any reason for his behaviour on that day.\" \n\nOf the 1992 assault on Judy X, Cronin told Baird that in his mind, she had not been there, but instead, he was imagining an assault on his maternal grandfather, with whom he had a lengthy love-hate relationship. He did talk at length about his parents; though he knew he didn't have a good relationship with them, he described his father as a hero, while disparaging and almost disowning his mother.\n\nOf other issues, Cronin told Baird of his need for prostitution and alcohol. Baird noted Cronin grew distressed only when discussing the 1992 attack or past abuse. Cronin also discussed with Baird his beliefs that he was reincarnated, that he'd been a soldier with the Charge of the Light Brigade. He also believed himself to be Nazi Reinhard Heydrich, as well as other persons in history.\n\nUltimately, Baird wrote that Cronin suffered no mental disorder that would justify institutionalising him. However, in his final notes, he added:\n\n\"[Cronin] has never, while in the community, lived in a calm, uneventful manner. The likelihood is that for a considerable time to come, he will, when in the community, behave again as he has done in the past...Personality disorders can cover a range of ills and affect different people in different ways. If a psychiatrist says such a condition is untreatable, it means there is no medication to help, but I don’t accept that any condition is entirely untreatable. There is work that could be done with John Cronin. The stumbling block is that he needs to want to be helped.\"\n\nThere has been some controversy over Cronin's case both with Cronin's treatment himself and the issues surrounding him.\n\nThe initial criticism comes from neighbours of the Cronins during John's childhood, in that one neighbour reported that \"[f]or the first few years of his life, his mum dressed him up as a girl. She wanted a girl so she dressed John in bows and frilly blouses. No wonder he’s such a mess now\", a condition that persisted until the Cronins had a daughter in 1978.\n\nThere have also been questions regarding his relationship with his grandfather, whom Cronin claims sexually abused him during the ages of 5 to 12. This has been contradicted somewhat in cases where Cronin also referred to his grandfather as a confidant and friend.\n\nAdditionally, there has also been some controversy over his conversion to Islam while in prison. While some British Muslims welcomed his conversion, others have recalled that the 1992 Judy X incident was done while Cronin pretended to be a priest, and that conversion could be no more than a smokescreen. In particular, Dr Prem Misra, a psychiatrist at Parkhead Hospital in Glasgow, said: \"He has used religious pretence to commit crime and nothing suggests that this will be different. He is remorseless.\"\n\nIn a similar vein is his response to his love of politics. Though initially involving himself with the Tories, in his later years he involved himself with the British National Party, though due to issues in 2003 regarding fraud charges the BNP announced that they had denied him membership and would campaign to have him evicted from his then-residence.\n\nLastly is media controversy. Several Scottish media outlets have followed his case, leading to some criticism of overzealotry and stalking. \"Scottish News of the World\" reported that vigilantes threatened to lynch him, while reporters from \"The Sun\" exposed his home, reporting that they found \"the monster in hiding\" and printed a picture of where Cronin was \"holed up.\" Another tabloid printed on its front page a plea to \"HELP US KEEP TABS ON THE BEAST. Women and children are living in fear because sick Cronin is to walk free. Help us to keep them safe by telling us what you know of his whereabouts.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "1929856", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1929856", "title": "Direct cinema", "text": "Direct cinema\n\nDirect cinema is a documentary genre that originated between 1958 and 1962 in North America, principally in the Canadian province of Quebec and the United States, and developed by Jean Rouch in France. It is defined as a cinematic practice employing lightweight filming equipment, hand-held cameras and live, synchronous sound that was available to create due to the new ground-breaking technologies that were being developed in the early 1960s. This offered early independent filmmakers the possibility to do away with the large crews, studio sets, tripod-mounted equipment and special lights in the making of a film, expensive aspects that severely limited these low-budget early documentarians. Similar in many respects to the cinéma vérité genre, it was characterized initially by filmmakers' desire to directly capture reality and represent it truthfully, and to question the relationship of reality with cinema.\n\n\"Direct cinema is the result of two predominant and related factors—The desire for a new cinematic realism and the development of the equipment necessary to achieving that desire\" (Monaco 2003, p. 206). Many technological, ideological and social aspects contribute to the direct cinema movement and its place in the history of cinema.\n\nDirect cinema was made possible, in part, by the advent of light, portable cameras, which allowed the hand-held camera and more intimacy in the filmmaking. It also produced movements that are the style's visual trademark. The first cameras of this type were German cameras, designed for ethnographic cinematography. The company Arriflex was considered the first to widely commercialize such cameras, that were improved for aerial photography during World War II. Easily available, portable cameras played an important part, but the existence of these cameras in itself did not trigger the birth of direct cinema.\n\nThe idea of cinema as an objective space has been present since its birth. The \"Kino-Pravda\" (literally \"Cinema Truth\") practice of Dziga Vertov, which can be traced back to the 1920s, gave an articulated voice to this notion, where one can also see the influence of futurism.\n\nBefore the 1960s and the advent of direct cinema, the concepts of propaganda, film education and documentary were loosely defined in the public. Cinema in its ontological objectivity was seen by many viewers as reality captured and a means of universal education, as had been photography in its early period. Documentaries from the 1950s provide insight into the level of understanding that viewers of that day had of manipulation and \"mise-en-scène\" in films shot on \"documentary sets.\" Direct cinema gained its importance in the perspective of the popular evolution of ideas about reality and the media.\n\nBefore the use of pilottone (invented in 1954) and the 1961 Nagra III, sound recording machinery was either extremely heavy or unreliable. Many attempts were made to solve this problem during the 1950s and 1960s. At the National Film Board of Canada (NFB), for example, a system called \"Sprocketape\" was designed, but was not implemented.\n\nIn the best case scenario, documentary sound was recorded before, in interviews, or much later on location, with a portable studio located in a sound-proofed truck. The sounds that were captured were later \"synched\" (synchronized) in sound editing, thus providing the film with sound. In other cases, the soundtrack was recorded, as in fiction films: with layers of ambient sound, archival sound effects, foley, and post-synced voices.\n\nIn other cases the documentary subject was brought into a studio. Sound taken directly from the studio made the documentary nature of the recording arguable. For example, a production might reconstruct a stable in the studio, with a sound engineer close by in a soundproof booth. This mimics the production of some studio films and TV series, but often results in surreal situations, such as cows being in a studio for a documentary on farming, rather than in their natural habitat.\n\nSynchronized sound was used by French filmmaker Jean Rouch in 1960 when he shot \"Chronicle of a Summer\", a landmark film in direct cinema history, in style of \"cinéma-vérité\", using a 16 mm camera connected through pilottone with a prototype of Nagra III, a transistorized tape recorder with electronic speed control, developed by Stefan Kudelski.\n\nWith improved sound, lighting and camera equipment available, the technical conditions necessary for the advent of direct cinema were present. The social and ideological conditions that led to direct cinema also appeared.\n\nDirect cinema seemed to reflect this new attitude. It emerged from a desire to compare common opinion with reality. It attempted to show how things really are, outside the studio, far from the editorial control of the establishment—be it governmental or big press. What was noteworthy was that the desire to test common opinion and show reality was constantly kept in check with an acute awareness that it is easy to lie with sound and image. This tension was at the center of direct cinema and resulted in its formal style and methodology.\n\nThe awareness of cinema's potential to lie would result in filmmakers' trying precise ways of shooting. For Michel Brault of the National Film Board of Canada, who pioneered modern hand-held camera work, it meant the ability to go amidst the people with a wide angle. Other filmmakers would develop different methods. Some insisted that their subject needed to get used to them before they started any real shooting, so it would seem the camera was being ignored Still another group of direct cinema filmmakers would claim that the most honest technique was for a filmmaker to accept the camera as a catalyst and acknowledge that it provoked reactions. This allowed filmmakers to feel free to ask their film subject to do something they would like to document.\n\nThe desire to capture reality led to some questioning the ability of filmmakers to properly film someone whom they could not fully understand. As an example, Jean Rouch went so far as to hand the camera to the \"subject\" (and co-author) of \"Moi, un Noir\".\n\nRegardless of these practices, one thing is certain: direct cinema had more to do with the ethical considerations in documentary film making than with the technology. This could explain why the movement began in two North American societies that were in social and ideological mutation, French Canada (Quebec) and the United States, before spreading to South America and France.\n\nDirect cinema began in 1958 at the National Film Board of Canada in Quebec, at the dawning of the Quiet Revolution, a period of intense social and political change.\n\nAt that time, a university education was a rare thing for a Québécois. The people of Quebec were seen by its young emerging intelligentsia as alienated and abused. This period of complex cultural and economical change for French-speaking Quebecers can be summarized by the convergence of three phenomena:\n\n\nThe consequences of these three movements deeply modified Quebec society and resulted in a myriad of perspectives by intellectuals and artists in their colonized society. Filmmakers would simultaneously try to share their social conscience, improve the living conditions of the Québécois and attempt to bring national independence—provoking, documenting this transformation, and at the same time keeping a record of disappearing traditions in a rapidly changing society. The landmark film \"Les Raquetteurs\" (1958), co-directed by Michel Brault and Gilles Groulx, is a key example, as is Groulx's 1961 \"Golden Gloves\".\n\nDirect cinema techniques were also incorporated into a number of key fiction films of the period, such as \"The Cat in the Bag\" (\"Le Chat dans le sac\") (1964) and \"La vie heureuse de Léopold Z\" (1965).\n\nIn the United States, Robert Drew, a journalist with \"Life\" magazine after the war, decided to apply the photojournalist method to movies. He founded Drew Associates, which included Richard Leacock, D.A. Pennebaker, Terence Macartney-Filgate, and Albert and David Maysles.) They started experimenting with technology, syncing camera and sound with the parts of a watch. In 1960, this group produced three films for Time-Life Broadcast: \"Yanqui, No!\", \"Eddie (On the Pole)\", and \"Primary\".\n\n\"Yanqui, No!\" focused on South America and its tense relations with the U.S. It documented the underlying anti-American sentiment in the population. \"Primary\" (a documentary about the 1960 Wisconsin Democratic presidential primary campaign between Senators John F. Kennedy and Hubert H. Humphrey), helped define direct cinema style and made it known to a wide public with the help of Time-Life Broadcast. The film reveals how primary elections worked in the U.S. at the time and raised the profile of direct cinema. After these hotly debated experiments, Time Life Broadcast withdrew from its agreement with Drew Associates. Drew Associates would continue on its own.\n\nOn June 11, 1963, the Alabama Governor George Wallace blocked the entrance of the University of Alabama to oppose integration. His defiance of court order rapidly became a national issue in the U.S. Drew Associates had a cameraman in the Oval office and recorded the meetings over the crisis. The result played on TV in October 1963. \"\" not only fueled discussions over the Civil Rights Movement, it also triggered a profound questioning over the political power of direct cinema. Politicians became more cautious about allowing access by documentary filmmakers.\n\nCinéma vérité has many resemblances to direct cinema. The hand-held style of camera work is the same. There is a similar feeling of real life unfolding before the viewer's eyes. There is also a mutual concern with social and ethical questions. Both cinéma vérité and direct cinema rely on the power of editing to give shape, structure and meaning to the material recorded. Some film historians have characterized the direct cinema movement as a North American version of the cinéma vérité movement. The latter was exemplified in France with Jean Rouch's \"Chronicle of a Summer\" (1961). For these historians cinéma vérité is characterized by the use of the camera to provoke and reveal.\n\nDirect cinema, on the other hand, has been seen as more strictly observational. It relies on an agreement among the filmmaker, subjects and audience to act as if the presence of the camera does not substantially alter the recorded event. Such claims of non-intervention have been criticized by critics and historians.\n\nIn a 2003 interview (Zuber), Robert Drew explained how he saw the differences between cinéma vérité and direct cinema:\nJean Rouch claimed cinéma vérité came from Brault and the NFB. Yet the NFB pioneers of the form Brault, Pierre Perrault and the others, never used the term \"cinéma vérité\" to describe their work and, in fact, found the term pretentious. They preferred \"Cinéma Direct\". Cinema vérité, the phrase and the form, can thus be seen as France's spin on the idea of the Cinéma Direct of Brault and his colleagues of the French section of the NFB in Canada.\n\nCinéma vérité came to be a term applied in English to everything from a school of thought, to a film style, and a look adopted by commercials.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The school has been accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Secondary Schools since 1935.\n\nAs of the 2018–19 school year, the school had an enrollment of 1,180 students and 112.6 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 10.5:1. There were 276 students (23.4% of enrollment) eligible for free lunch and 117 (9.9% of students) eligible for reduced-cost lunch.\n\nThe school was renovated in 2003–04, giving students new classrooms as well as a new student center. Teaneck has implemented two academies that focus on the sciences and the arts.\n\nTeaneck's sports teams are nicknamed the Highwaymen; girls' teams are called the Highwaywomen. The team name comes from the highwaymen who would seize money and belongings from those traveling along highways during the 17th and 18th century and for the school's location overlooking Route 4.\n\nThe school was opened in the current building, which resembles a Tudor palace, in 1928, and a new wing was added in 1936. Honors courses were introduced in the 1960s. Teaneck has been a four-year high school since the 1980s.\nIn 1934, Teaneck High School became the first in the nation to offer a program in aviation as a vocational component of its academic program. Using a plane purchased for $1,800, students were trained in class regarding the technical aspects of flying during the first year of the two-year program, with students getting at least the minimum 50 hours of flight training during the second year needed to obtain a pilot's license.\n\nIn May 1964, Teaneck's schools were officially desegregated, after the district's board of education voted to implement a centralized sixth grade school that would serve the entire township.\n\nIn 1972, the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey represented Teaneck High School student Abbe Seldin in her legal battle to play tennis at the school. The coach would not let her play for the men's team, although no women's team existed. Seldin won her case and later became the first woman at Syracuse University to win an athletic scholarship.\n\nIn 1987, the school was the subject of a \"20/20\" documentary on the effects of Heavy Metal on students.\n\nOn May 1, 2014, more than 60 students were taken into police custody following a senior prank at Teaneck High School. A police officer described the overturned tables and vaseline-smeared doorknobs as \"the craziest thing [he'd] ever seen\" in his 19-year career. Initial reports claimed that students had also urinated in the halls, which was refuted by the district's superintendent.\n\nIn \"Newsweek's\" May 22, 2007 issue, ranking the country's top high schools, Teaneck High School was listed in 1080th place, the 33rd-highest ranked school in New Jersey.\n\nThe school was the 156th-ranked public high school in New Jersey out of 339 schools statewide in \"New Jersey Monthly\" magazine's September 2014 cover story on the state's \"Top Public High Schools\", using a new ranking methodology. The school had been ranked 126th in the state of 328 schools in 2012, after being ranked 114th in 2010 out of 322 schools listed. The magazine ranked the school 121st in 2008 out of 316 schools. The school was ranked 102nd in the magazine's September 2006 issue, which surveyed 316 schools across the state.\n\nSchooldigger.com ranked the school 266th out of 367 public high schools statewide in its 2009-10 rankings which were based on the combined percentage of students classified as proficient or above proficient on the language arts literacy and mathematics components of the High School Proficiency Assessment (HSPA).\n\nIn the fall of 2002, two academies, or \"schools within a school,\" were launched. The T.E.A.M.S. Academy (Technology-Enriched Academy for Mathematics and Science) is a three-hour daily program that seeks to integrate technology, mathematics, science, and computer science in a smaller learning environment. The TAA Performing Arts Academy aims to integrate various art forms such as dance, film making, instrumental music and technical theatre to prepare students for college majors and internships in the Fine and Performing Arts.\n\nTeaneck High School won the New Jersey State High School Chess Championship in 1997. Shearwood McClelland won the national high school chess championship in 1994 and 1995, the first repeat champion in tournament history.\n\nTeaneck High School Highwaymen / Highwaywomen compete in the Big North Conference, following a reorganization of sports leagues in Northern New Jersey by the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association (NJSIAA). In the 2009-10 school year, the school competed in the North Jersey Tri-County Conference, which was established on an interim basis to facilitate the realignment. Until the NJSIAA's 2009 realignment, the school had participated in Division A of the Northern New Jersey Interscholastic League, which was made up of high schools located in Bergen County, Essex County and Passaic County, and was separated into three divisions based on NJSIAA size classification. With 986 students in grades 10-12, the school was classified by the NJSIAA for the 2015-16 school year as North I, Group III for most athletic competition purposes, which included schools with an enrollment of 786 to 1,074 students in that grade range.\n\nSports offered include:\nBoys and Girls Cross Country, Football, Boys and Girls Soccer, * Girls Volleyball and Girls Tennis\nBoys and Girls Basketball, Boys and Girls Swimming, Indoor track, Scholastic wrestling, Boys and Girls Bowling, and Boys and Girls Fencing\nBaseball, Softball, Tennis, Boys Track, Girls Track, Golf, Boys Volleyball, Boys and Girls Crew\n\nTeaneck won the Group IV cross country state championship in 1961. The school's Dave Hunt was the individual champion in Group IV in 1964.\n\nThe boys' basketball team won the Group III state championship in 1999 (vs. Rancocas Valley Regional High School) and 2003 (vs. Trenton Central High School). The team won the Group IV state championship in 1999 and advanced to the Tournament of Champions final, finally losing to Seton Hall Preparatory School. The team won the 2003 Group IV state championship with a 61–54 win over Elizabeth High School in the semis and a 68–56 win against Trenton Central in the finals. Winning their 28th consecutive game that season, the Highwaymen took the 2011 North I Group III state sectional title with a 68-40 win over Passaic Valley Regional High School during their first year under head coach Jerome Smart. That same season, head coach Shenee Clark led the Highwaywomen to a state sectional title in the North I Group III region with a 63-42 win over Ramapo High School.\n\nThe THS homecoming football game has been held annually on Thanksgiving Day against rival Hackensack High School since 1931, alternating each year with each school as host.\n\nRunner Kahlia Taylor won the Group III state championships in 2012 in both the 100m and 200m sprints, becoming only the sixth female runner from a public school in North Jersey to achieve this accomplishment.\n\nIn 2020, the girls' bowling team won the Group II state championship, the first state title in program history.\n\nThe school's principal is Clifton Thompson. His core administration team includes two vice principals.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Shaft drives were introduced over a century ago, but were mostly supplanted by chain-driven bicycles due to the gear ranges possible with sprockets and derailleurs. Recently, due to advancements in internal gear technology, a small number of modern shaft-driven bicycles have been introduced.\n\nShaft-driven bikes have a large bevel gear where a conventional bike would have its chain ring. This meshes with another bevel gear mounted on the drive shaft. The use of bevel gears allows the axis of the drive torque from the pedals to be turned through 90 degrees. The drive shaft then has another bevel gear near the rear wheel hub which meshes with a bevel gear on the hub where the rear sprocket would be on a conventional bike, and canceling out the first drive torque change of axis.\n\nThe 90-degree change of the drive plane that occurs at the bottom bracket and again at the rear hub uses bevel gears for the most efficient performance, though other mechanisms could be used, e.g. hobson's joints, worm gears or crossed helical gears.\n\nThe drive shaft is often mated to a hub gear which is an internal gear system housed inside the rear hub. Manufacturers of internal hubs suitable for use with shaft drive systems include NuVinci, Rohloff, Shimano, SRAM, and Sturmey-Archer.\nThe first shaft drives for cycles appear to have been invented independently in the United States and Britain. In 1880, the Orbicycle (which as actually a tricycle) by Thomas Moore used a shaft drive. A. Fearnhead, of 354 Caledonian Road, North London, developed one in 1890 and received a patent in October 1891. His prototype shaft was enclosed within a tube running along the top of the chainstay; later models were enclosed within the actual chainstay. In the United States, Walter Stillman filed for a patent on a shaft-driven bicycle on Dec. 10, 1890, which was granted on July 21, 1891.\n\nThe shaft drive was not well accepted in Britain, so in 1894 Fearnhead took it to the United States where Colonel Pope of the Columbia firm bought the exclusive American rights. Belatedly, the British makers took it up, with Humber in particular plunging heavily on the deal. Curiously enough, the greatest of all the Victorian cycle engineers, Professor Archibald Sharp, was against shaft drive; in his classic 1896 book \"Bicycles and Tricycles\", he wrote \"The Fearnhead Gear ... if bevel-wheels could be accurately and cheaply cut by machinery, it is possible that gears of this description might supplant, to a great extent, the chain-drive gear; but the fact that the teeth of the bevel-wheels cannot be accurately milled is a serious obstacle to their practical success\".\n\nIn the United States, they had been made by the League Cycle Company as early as 1893. Soon after, the French company Metropole marketed their Acatane. By 1897 Columbia began aggressively to market the \"chainless\" bicycle it had acquired from the League Cycle Company. \"Chainless\" bicycles were moderately popular in 1898 and 1899, although sales were still much smaller than regular bicycles, primarily due to the high cost. They were also somewhat less efficient than regular bicycles: there was roughly an 8 percent loss in the gearing, in part due to limited manufacturing technology at the time. The rear wheel was also more difficult to remove to change flats. Many of these deficiencies have been overcome in the past century.\n\nIn 1902, The Hill-Climber Bicycle Mfg. Company sold a three-speed shaft-driven bicycle in which the shifting was implemented with three sets of bevel gears. While a small number of \"chainless\" bicycles were available, for the most part, shaft-driven bicycles disappeared from view for most of the 20th century. There is, however, still a niche market for \"chainless\" bikes, especially for commuters, and there is a number of manufacturers who offer them either as part of a larger range or as a primary specialization. A notable example is Biomega in Denmark.\n\nShaft drives operate at a very consistent rate of efficiency and performance, without adjustments or maintenance, though their efficiency has been lower than that of a properly adjusted and lubricated chain, possibly because of insufficiently precise machining or alignment of the bevel gears. Shaft drives are typically more complex to disassemble when repairing flat rear tires, and the manufacturing cost is typically higher.\n\nA fundamental issue with bicycle shaft-drive systems is the requirement to transmit the torque of the rider through bevel gears with much smaller radii than typical bicycle sprockets. This requires both high quality gears and heavier frame construction.\n\nSince shaft-drives require gear hubs for shifting, they accrue all the benefits and drawbacks associated with such mechanisms.\n\nMost of the advantages claimed for a shaft drive can be realized by using a fully enclosed chain case. Some of the other issues addressed by the shaft drive, such as protection for clothing and from ingress of dirt, can be met through the use of chain guards. The reduced need for adjustment in shaft-drive bikes also applies to a similar extent to chain or belt-driven hub-geared bikes. Not all hub gear systems are shaft compatible.\n\n\n"}

It is a critically endangered species; it has been successfully bred in captivity, and is available, if not common, as a pet. It is also sometimes known in the literature as Lafresnaye's macaw, named for the French ornithologist Frédéric de Lafresnaye, who was one of the first to describe the species.\n\nThe red-fronted macaw is long. It is mostly green, and has a red forehead, a red patch over the ears and bright red to orange edged under wing coverts. It has an area of pinkish skin around the eyes extending to the beak. It has red at the bend of wings and blue primary wing feathers.\n\nThe red-fronted macaw is native to a small mountainous area of south-central Bolivia situated about 200 km west of Santa Cruz, in the department of the same name, where the climate is medium altitude semi-desert. The natural vegetation consists mostly of cactus (large and small) and thorny trees and scrub. The climate is semi arid with cold nights and hot days. Rain comes in infrequent heavy storms. It is unusual in that it is the only macaw to inhabit such a climatic zone. Most macaws nest in holes in large trees, however here there are no very large trees in its range so it nests in vertical fissures in cliff faces. The bird has been captured for the pet trade in the past and killed by local farmers because it raids their crops.\n\n"}

The battle was initiated by Narathihapate, who invaded the Yunnan, a province of the Yuan dynasty. Mongol defenders soundly defeated the Pagan forces.\n\nHostility between the two empires had already been established by that time: when Kublai Khan had sent emissaries to regional powers of eastern Asia to demand tribute, Narathihapate refused the khan's representatives the first time they visited (in 1271), and they were killed by bandits in 1273. When Kublai Khan did not immediately respond to this insult, Narathihapate gained confidence that the Mongols would not fight him. He subsequently invaded the state of Kaungai, whose chief had recently pledged fealty to Kublai Khan. Local garrisons of Mongol troops were ordered to defend the area, and although outnumbered were able to soundly defeat the Pagan forces in battle and press into the Pagan territory of Bhamo. The presence of war elephants initially caused Mongol horses to shy in terror, but Mongol general Khudu (Qutuq) ordered his men to shower the elephants with arrows. The wounded elephants stampeded and destroyed everything in their path. In the end, Mongol troops abandoned their offensive and returned to Yunnan, a province of Yuan dynasty with their wounded general Khudu.\n\nThe Battle of Ngassaunggyan was the first of three decisive battles between the two empires, the others being the Battle of Bhamo in 1283 and the Battle of Pagan in 1287. By the end of these battles, the Mongols had conquered the entire Pagan empire and installed a puppet government.\n\nIn the end of 1277, Yunnan governor's son Naser ad-Din attacked Bhamo again and tried to establish postal system which had already covered Mongol Empire after defeating enemies. But deadly heat forced him to leave Burma. He returned to Khanbaliq with 12 elephants and gave them to his master Kublai Khan in 1279.\n\nThe battle was later reported back to Europe by Marco Polo, who described the battle vividly in his reports. His description was presumably pieced together by accounts he heard while visiting the court of Kublai Khan.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1929890", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1929890", "title": "Maurice, Elector of Saxony", "text": "Maurice, Elector of Saxony\n\nMaurice (21 March 1521 – 9 July 1553) was Duke (1541–47) and later Elector (1547–53) of Saxony. His clever manipulation of alliances and disputes gained the Albertine branch of the Wettin dynasty extensive lands and the electoral dignity.\n\nMaurice was the fourth child but first son of the future Henry IV, Duke of Saxony, then a Catholic, and his Protestant wife Catherine of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. Henry was the younger brother of George, Duke of Saxony.\n\nIn December 1532, Maurice, aged 11, came to live at the castle of his godfather Cardinal Albert of Brandenburg, Archbishop of Magdeburg and Archbishop of Mainz. For two years, he lived a contemplative life until his uncle Duke George demanded his return to Saxony. George began the training of the future Duke and educated him as a Catholic. But in 1536 Maurice's father became a Protestant, and when he succeeded George as Duke in 1539, he made the Duchy Protestant. Henry and Catherine took the education of their son into their hands. That same year, Maurice, now 18 years old, went to live in Torgau with his older cousin John Frederick I, Elector of Saxony, whom he despised; this led to a strong hatred between them. With another cousin, however, Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse, whom he met in Dresden, Maurice struck up a lifelong friendship.\n\nAfter Maurice came of age, in 1539, his parents began to look for a wife for him. The favorite was Philip's eldest daughter, Agnes. The marriage plans threatened to fail, however, because of the illegal double marriage of the Landgrave. Without the knowledge of his parents, Maurice remained committed to his engagement with Agnes. The wedding, particularly disapproved of by his mother, took place in Marburg on 9 January 1541. Letters from that time illustrate the strong mutual devotion of the couple. Together they had two children:\n\n\nOn 18 August 1541 Duke Henry died, and Maurice, as the eldest son, succeeded him as Duke of Saxony and Head of the Albertine Line. He replaced most of his advisors, because they had been opposed to his marriage with Agnes from the very start. George von Carlowitz, one of the new confidants of the Duke, advised Maurice (in order to prevent a war with Emperor Charles V and his brother Ferdinand, at the same time King of the Romans and his neighbour as King of Bohemia) not to endanger the survival of the Protestant Movement.\n\nThus he participated in the emperor's army in the war against the forces of the Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent of the Ottoman Empire (1542), Duke William of Jülich-Cleves-Berg (1543), and King Francis I of France (1544). However, on the other hand, the Duke confiscated the properties of the Catholic Church in his lands. From the wealth of dissolved monasteries in his country Maurice founded the princes' schools (\"Fürstenschulen\") of Schulpforta (100 places), Meissen (60 places) and Grimma (70 places). The legal basis for this was the \"New National Order\" (\"Neue Landesordnung\") of 1543.\n\nLater, Maurice refused to join the Protestant Schmalkaldic League, although the Landgrave Philip of Hesse, his friend and father-in-law, was its leader. The principal reason for his refusal to do so is generally regarded as his hate for his Ernestine cousin John Frederick I and the Imperial promise of the Saxon electorship, then held by John Frederick. In the Holy Week of 1542, in the process of the Wurzener Feud (\"Wurzener Fehde\") it nearly came to a \"fratricidal war\", because John Frederick occupied the jointly administered \"Wurzener Country\". There had previously been a controversy between Maurice and John Frederick over the use of tax funds from this area. The intervention of the Landgrave Philip of Hesse and Martin Luther prevented the war.\n\nDue to the energetic persistence of the Elector John Frederick in establishing the Protestant Faith, the Emperor Charles V, on 20 July 1546, imposed the Imperial Ban (\"Reichsacht\") on him, with the agreement of the Catholic Imperial Estates, the enforcement of which was laid on Maurice after the Wurzener Feud. The emperor tried in this way to drive a still deeper wedge into the Protestant camp in order to prevent a further propagation of the Protestant Faith. In the case of a successful enforcement, Maurice hoped to be invested by the emperor with the Electorship. Maurice hesitated for a long time, since by this punitive action his father-in-law Philip of Hesse would have been affected also. But when the brother of the emperor, Ferdinand I, himself wanted to initiate a campaign against the Electorate of Saxony, he had to call it off, in order not to lose the initiative in his own lands to the Habsburgs.\n\nMaurice returned to Charles's camp. After initial successes — he occupied the Electorate of Saxony nearly without a fight — Maurice with his army was driven back by the Schmalkaldic League and retreated towards Bohemia. In the crucial Battle of Mühlberg on the Elbe, the Emperor and his brother Ferdinand, as well as Maurice, were able to defeat the Schmalkaldic League by capturing Landgrave Philip and John Frederick. According to contemporary chronicles, all of this happened on the same day, 24 April 1547. In order to escape being beheaded, John Frederick ceded the Electorate and sizable lands to Maurice in the Surrender of Wittemberg. In a brief ceremony in the field camp after the battle on 4 June 1547 Duke Maurice of Saxony was raised to the dignified position of Elector of Saxony. The official appointment took place later, but at a high price: He had betrayed the Protestant Faith and had brought his father-in-law, Philip of Hesse, into a hopeless situation. Maurice assured him that he would not be imprisoned, if he would surrender to the emperor. However, Philip was taken prisoner and exiled, after he had fallen on his knees before Charles V.\n\nMaurice, insulted after these incidents by his compatriots and called a \"Judas\", was also disappointed by the emperor's attitude (because now Charles V tried to reintroduce Catholicism into the Empire's Protestant territories and continued the imprisonment of his father-in-law, Landgrave Philip of Hesse, whose freedom Charles V had guaranteed), he hid his feelings from him up to the Diet of Augsburg on 25 February 1548, where the ceremony of the formal inauguration of Maurice as Elector of Saxony took place. Charles V hoped that, with Maurice's appointment as the Elector of Saxony, with the signing of the agreement known as the Augsburg Interim, and with his own assistance, they could put an end to the religious strife that was splitting his empire.\n\nWhen commissioned to capture the rebellious Lutheran city of Magdeburg (1550), Maurice seized the opportunity to raise an army and signed anti-Habsburg compacts with France and Germany's Protestant princes.\n\nIn the Treaty of Chambord signed with the French King Henry II in January 1552 Maurice promised the King money and weapons to assist him in his campaign against Charles V. In return, Henry was able to take four Imperial cities (Metz, Toul, Verdun and Cambrai) as well as their bishoprics, although Maurice had no right to them.\n\nIn March 1552 the rebels overran the southern German states, including parts of Austria, forcing the Emperor to flee and release Philip of Hesse. While Henry advanced up to the Rhine and occupied the promised Imperial lands, the emperor surprised by the attack fled over the Alps to Villach in the Austrian Duchy of Carinthia. In view of this success, Maurice abandoned his alliance with Henry II and negotiated a treaty with Charles's brother King Ferdinand I, to which Charles willingly agreed. When the Peace of Passau, was signed in August 1552, the Lutheran position was provisionally guaranteed. As part of the Peace, his former opponents from the Schmalkaldic War, John Frederick I of Saxony and the Landgrave Philipp of Hesse were released. The war was terminated in 1556 by Ferdinand I; the Imperial cities remained in possession of the French.\n\nWhen Maurice returned to Saxony after the Peace of Passau, he was no longer seen as a traitor; both Protestants and Catholics rendered him equal respect. In addition the emperor in correspondence to both parties exhorted them to maintain peace in his empire; shortly after, he campaigned against the Ottomans in Hungary. The Margrave Albert Alcibiades of Brandenburg-Kulmbach (who had rejected the Passau armistice) soon afterwards conquered the bishoprics of Würzburg and Bamberg — which had been under his control for eleven years previously, after their former owner, John Frederick had ceded them to him. This was the beginning of the Second Margrave War, which only ended with the Peace of Augsburg of 1555.\n\nIn 1552 Maurice with the army of the Holy Roman Empire (11,000 men) marched into Hungary. The Ottomans besieged Eger, but the Black Death broke out in Hungary, and Maurice did not dare to move up his forces.\nAlbert Alcibiades was a former ally of Maurice, who had fought in the Schmalkaldic War on his side. But now Maurice, involved in an alliance of princes, with Ferdinand I amongst others, was compelled to fight against Albert Alcibiades. On 9 July 1553 the Battle of Sievershausen took place at Lehrte. Maurice won this battle, but was badly wounded in the stomach by a shot from the rear and succumbed two days later in the field camp at the age of 32. He was buried in Freiberg Cathedral. In 1853, 300 years after the battle, the place of his death was commemorated by a monument erected to his memory. The 7.5 ton heavy granite monument came from his native Saxony.\n\nBecause Maurice died without a surviving male heir, his brother Augustus succeeded him as Elector. In Dresden, shortly after the death of Maurice, he erected the Maurice Monument (\"Moritzmonument\"), the first historical monument to be erected in Saxony.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1929895", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1929895", "title": "National identity", "text": "National identity\n\nNational identity is a person's identity or sense of belonging to one state or to one nation. It is the sense of \"a nation as a cohesive whole, as represented by distinctive traditions, culture, and language.\" National identity may refer to the subjective feeling one shares with a group of people about a nation, regardless of one's legal citizenship status. National identity is viewed in psychological terms as \"an awareness of difference\", a \"feeling and recognition of 'we' and 'they'\".\n\nAs a collective phenomenon, national identity can arise as a direct result of the presence of elements from the \"common points\" in people's daily lives: national symbols, language, the nation's history, national consciousness, and cultural artefacts.\n\nThe expression of one's national identity seen in a positive light is patriotism which is characterized by national pride and positive emotion of love for one's country. The extreme expression of national identity is chauvinism, which refers to the firm belief in the country's superiority and extreme loyalty toward one's country.\n\nNational identity is not an inborn trait and it is essentially socially constructed. A person's national identity results directly from the presence of elements from the \"common points\" in people's daily lives: national symbols, language, colors, nation's history, blood ties, culture, music, cuisine, radio, television, and so on. Under various social influences, people incorporate national identity into their personal identities by adopting beliefs, values, assumptions and expectations which align with one's national identity. People with identification of their nation view national beliefs and values as personally meaningful, and translate these beliefs and values into daily practices.\n\nPolitical scientist Rupert Emerson defined national identity as \"a body of people who feel that they are a nation\". This definition of national identity was endorsed by social psychologist, Henri Tajfel, who formulated social identity theory together with John Turner. Social identity theory adopts this definition of national identity, and suggests that the conceptualization of national identity includes both self-categorization and affect. Self-categorization refers to identifying with a nation and viewing oneself as a member of a nation. The affect part refers to the emotion a person has with this identification, such as a sense of belonging, or emotional attachment toward one's nation. The mere awareness of belonging to a certain group invokes positive emotions about the group, and leads to a tendency to act on behalf of that group, even when the other group members are sometimes personally unknown.\n\nNational identity requires the process of self-categorization and it involves both the identification of in-group (identifying with one's nation), and differentiation of out-groups (other nations). By recognizing commonalities such as having common descent and common destiny, people identify with a nation and form an in-group, and at the same time they view people that identify with a different nation as out-groups. Social identity theory suggests a positive relationship between identification of a nation and derogation of other nations. By identifying with one's nation, people involve in intergroup comparisons, and tend to derogate out-groups. However, several studies have investigated this relationship between national identity and derogating other countries, and found that identifying with national identity does not necessarily result in out-group derogation.\n\nNational identity, like other social identities, engenders positive emotions such as pride and love to one's nation, and feeling of obligations toward other citizens. The socialization of national identity, such as socializing national pride and a sense of the country's exceptionalism contributes to harmony among ethnic groups. For example, in the U.S, by integrating diverse ethnic groups in the overarching identity of being an American, people are united by a shared emotion of national pride and the feeling of belonging to the U.S, and thus tend to mitigate ethnic conflicts.\n\nNational identity can be most noticeable when the nation confronts external or internal enemy and natural disasters. An example of this phenomenon is the rise in patriotism and national identity in the U.S after the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. The identity of being an American is salient after the terrorist attacks and American national identity is evoked. Having a common threat or having a common goal unites people in a nation and enhances national identity.\n\nSociologist Anthony Smith argues that national identity has the feature of continuity that can transmit and persist through generations. By expressing the myths of having common descent and common destiny, people's sense of belonging to a nation is enhanced. However, national identities can disappear across time as more people live in foreign countries for a longer time, and can be challenged by supranational identities, which refers to identifying with a more inclusive, larger group that includes people from multiple nations.\n\nNational identity can be thought as a collective product. Through socialization, a system of beliefs, values, assumptions and expectations is transmitted to group members. The collective elements of national identity may include national symbols, traditions, and memories of national experiences and achievements. These collective elements are rooted in the nation's history. Depending on how much the individual is exposed to the socialization of this system, people incorporate national identity to their personal identity to different degrees and in different ways, and the collective elements of national identity may become important parts of individual's definition of the self and how they view the world and their own place in it.\n\nIn countries that have multiple ethnic groups, ethnic identity and national identity may be in conflict. These conflicts are usually referred to as ethno-national conflict. One of the famous ethno-national conflicts is the struggle between the Australian government and aboriginal population in Australia. The Australian government and majority culture imposed policies and framework that supported the majority, European-based cultural values and a national language as English. The aboriginal cultures and languages were not supported by the state, and were nearly eradicated by the state during the 20th century. Because of these conflicts, aboriginal population identify less or do not identify with the national identity of being an Australian, but their ethnic identities are salient.\n\nAs immigration increases, many countries face the challenges of constructing national identity and accommodating immigrants. Some countries are more inclusive in terms of encouraging immigrants to develop a sense of belonging to their host country. For example, Canada has the highest permanent immigration rates in the world. The Canadian government encourages immigrants to build a sense of belonging to Canada, and has fostered a more inclusive concept of national identity which includes both people born in Canada and immigrants. Some countries are less inclusive. For example, Russia has experienced two major waves of immigration influx, one in the 1990s, and the other one after 1998. Immigrants were perceived negatively by the Russian people and were viewed as \"unwelcome and abusive guests.\" Immigrants were considered outsiders and were excluded from sharing the national identity of belonging to Russia.\n\nAs the world becomes increasingly globalized, international tourism, communication and business collaboration has increased. People around the world cross national borders more frequently to seek cultural exchange, education, business, and different lifestyles. Globalization promotes common values and experiences, and it also encourages the identification with the global community. People may adapt cosmopolitanism and view themselves as global beings, or world citizens. This trend may threaten national identity because globalization undermines the importance of being a citizen of a particular country. \n\nSeveral researchers examined globalization and its impact on national identity found that as a country becomes more globalized, patriotism declined, which suggests that the increase of globalization is associated with less loyalty and less willingness to fight for one's own country. However, even a nation like Turkey that occupies an important geographic trade crossroads and international marketplace with a tradition of liberal economic activity with an ingrained entrepreneurial and foreign trade has degrees of ethnocentrism as Turkish consumers may be basically rational buyers by not discriminating against imported products, but they exhibit preferences for local goods that are of equal quality to the imports because buying them assists the nation's economy and domestic employment.\n\nIn some cases, national identity collides with a person's civil identity. For example, many Israeli Arabs associate themselves with the Arab or Palestinian nationality, while at the same time they are citizens of the state of Israel, which is in conflict with the Palestinian nationality. Taiwanese also face a conflict of national identity with civil identity as there have been movements advocating formal \"Taiwan Independence\" and renaming \"Republic of China\" to \"Republic of Taiwan.\" Residents in Taiwan are issued national identification cards and passports under the country name \"Republic of China\", and a portion of them do not identify themselves with \"Republic of China,\" but rather with \"Republic of Taiwan\". Also many Kashmiri Indians associate themselves with the Muslim or Pakistani nationality, while at the same time they are unwilling citizens of the Republic of India, which is in conflict with the Pakistani nationality.\n\nNational identity markers are those characteristics used to identify a person as possessing a particular national identity. These markers are not fixed but fluid, varying from culture to culture and also within a culture over time. Such markers may include common language or dialect, national dress, birthplace, family affiliation, etc.\n\n"}

Tanaka debuted on July 23, 1993 in Saga City, facing Ricky Fuji. He quickly began moving up the card in FMW, widely regarded as the top hardcore professional wrestling promotion in Japan. Wrestling in matches featuring explosions and barbed wire, Tanaka earned a variety of scars, and the nickname \"Dangan\", which he would often shout during his matches. By 1996 he was one of the promotion's major stars, and had feuded with such luminaries as Mr. Pogo, Mr. Gannosuke, Terry Funk and Mike Awesome. His feud with Awesome would eventually span ten years and two continents. In December 1999, he left FMW for ECW, after he and Tetsuhiro Kuroda lost to H and Mr. Gannosuke.\n\nExtreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) owner Paul Heyman became interested in Tanaka through ECW's working relationship with FMW, and eventually hired him. Tanaka debuted in ECW on March 1, 1998 at Living Dangerously, defeating Doug Furnas in a match that, compared to Tanaka's extremely well-received future matches, was very much hated by the fans in attendance, who greeted the unusually sloppy wrestlers with a chorus of boos throughout their fumbled offense. In July 1998 he reprised his feud with Awesome, who he defeated at Heat Wave 1998.\n\nTanaka formed a short-lived tag team with Balls Mahoney, and at November to Remember on November 1, 1998 they defeated The Dudley Boyz to win the ECW World Tag Team Championships. In doing so, he became the first person to ever kick out of the Dudleys' \"3D\" finisher. The Dudley Boyz would regain the titles five days later, and Tanaka returned to Japan to attend the wedding of his friend Sabu in December and eventually returning to FMW in January 1999.\n\nTanaka returned to ECW in the summer of 1999, this time vying for the ECW World Heavyweight Championship. On September 19 at Anarchy Rulz, Taz, about to leave ECW for the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), defended the ECW World Heavyweight Championship against the returning Mike Awesome and Tanaka in a three-way dance. After just two minutes Taz was eliminated by a combined assault at the hands of his opponents. After a further eleven minutes of brawling, Awesome pinned Tanaka with a Kamikaze Awesome Bomb to become the new ECW World Heavyweight Champion.\n\nTanaka faced Awesome for the title at November to Remember on November 7, but was defeated once more. He finally overcame Awesome on December 17, 1999 at an \"ECW on TNN\" TV Taping in Nashville, Tennessee, becoming the first ECW World Heavyweight Champion not to be an American citizen. After the match, Awesome shook Tanaka's hand and fastened the belt around his waist in a show of respect, then attacked him as he left the ring and powerbombed him through a table. Awesome would regain the title at the next weeks TV Taping in White Plains, New York on December 23.\n\nContinuing his rivalry with Awesome, Tanaka joined forces with Tommy Dreamer to face Raven and Awesome. Dreamer and Tanaka defeated the Impact Players for the ECW World Tag Team Championship on February 26, 2000 in Cincinnati, but lost them to Mike Awesome and Raven on March 4, 2000 at The ECW Arena. This led to a tag team three-way dance at Living Dangerously on March 12, with Tanaka and Dreamer facing ECW World Tag Team Champions Mike Awesome and Raven and the Impact Players. Tanaka pinned Awesome, who had already defended his ECW World Heavyweight Title earlier that night beating Kid Kash, costing Awesome and Raven the tag team titles, but lost the match after Dreamer was pinned by the Impact Players.\n\nTanaka's feud with Awesome was brought to an abrupt end when Awesome left ECW for WCW in April 2000. He faced Balls Mahoney in at ECW on TNN and at Hardcore Heaven 2000. He remained with ECW until mid-2000 before returning to Japan.\n\nTanaka returned to FMW in the spring of 2000, briefly feuding with H, before joining forces with H (by now back under the Hayabusa persona) to feud with Team No Respect, until leaving in February 2001, allegedly as a result of animosity between him and the owner of FMW, Shoichi Arai, mostly over Kodo Fuyuki's role as booker. Before departing FMW, Tanaka formed the \"Complete Players\" stable with former Fuyuki protégés Gedo and Jado, as well as real-life sweetheart Kaori Nakayama. They would work on the Japanese independent circuit, making appearances for Pro Wrestling ZERO-ONE (ZERO-ONE) and All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW). Tanaka wrestled Shinya Hashimoto on the March 2 ZERO-ONE anniversary show, impressing ZERO-ONE officials and earning himself a job.\n\nIn January 2002 Tanaka formed a tag team named \"Emblem\" with Shinjiro Otani, with whom he twice won the NWA Intercontinental Tag Team Championships. In February 2004, he turned heel and sided with the \"Apache Army\". In September 2004 he formed his own stable, \"Team Erotics\", continuing his feud with Otani. In late 2007, he was chosen to lead a new stable named \"Sword Army\", the name was chosen by fans in a contest. Takao Omori was also given a stable named \"Axe Army\" to compete against Tanaka.\n\nIn mid-2009 Tanaka returned to New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) as an outsider. He reformed the Complete Players with Jado and Gedo, and he participated in the 2009 G1 Climax tournament, although he failed to advance past the block stages. In New Japan, he's an ally of the stable, Chaos, especially Jado, Gedo and Yujiro Takahashi. On October 10, 2011, at Destruction '11, Tanaka defeated MVP to win the IWGP Intercontinental Championship, becoming only the second champion in the title's history. He would make his first successful title defense on November 12 at Power Struggle against Hirooki Goto. On December 4, Tanaka defeated MVP in a rematch, with help from Yujiro Takahashi, to retain the IWGP Intercontinental Championship. On January 4, 2012, at Wrestle Kingdom VI in Tokyo Dome, where Tanaka and Takahashi were defeated by MVP and Shelton Benjamin in a tag team match. On February 12 at The New Beginning, Tanaka lost the IWGP Intercontinental Championship to Hirooki Goto in his fourth defense.\n\nOn November 15, 2012, Tanaka entered a tournament to determine the inaugural NEVER Openweight Champion. After wins over Kushida, Taishi Takizawa and Tomohiro Ishii, Tanaka defeated Karl Anderson in the finals of the tournament on November 19 to become the inaugural NEVER Openweight Champion. Tanaka made his first successful title defense on January 4, 2013, at Wrestle Kingdom 7 in Tokyo Dome, where he defeated Shelton Benjamin. Tanaka's second successful title defense took place on February 3, when he defeated Chaos stablemate Tomohiro Ishii. On May 3 at Wrestling Dontaku 2013, Tanaka made his third successful title defense against Tomoaki Honma. On July 20, Tanaka made his fourth successful title defense against Tetsuya Naito. On September 29 at Destruction, Tanaka lost the NEVER Openweight Championship in a rematch with Naito, ending his reign at 314 days.\n\nAfter forming the Dangan Yankies stable in Zero1, Tanaka began working for Pro Wrestling Noah in early 2014, teaming with stablemate Takashi Sugiura. On April 27, the two defeated Katsuhiko Nakajima and Naomichi Marufuji to win the 2014 Global Tag League. On May 6, Tanaka and Sugiura won the NWA Intercontinental Tag Team Championship. On May 31, Tanaka and Sugiura became double champions, when they defeated Maybach Taniguchi and Takeshi Morishima for Noah's GHC Tag Team Championship. They lost the GHC Tag Team Championship to TMDK (Mikey Nicholls and Shane Haste) on January 10, 2015. On May 4, Tanaka and Sugiura won their second Global Tag League in a row.\n\nOn November 9, 2002, Tanaka debuted for Ring of Honor (ROH), wrestling on ROH's \"All Star Extravaganza\" show, where he teamed with Shinjiro Otani to defeat Steve Corino and Low Ki.\n\nOn June 12. 2005 Tanaka revived his feud with Mike Awesome at the World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) produced ECW One Night Stand 2005 reunion PPV. He was defeated after Awesome delivered a running Awesome Bomb through a table outside the ring and followed up with an Awesome Splash. He returned to WWE one year later at ECW One Night Stand 2006, losing to Balls Mahoney. On October 26, 2007, Tanaka beat Takao Omori for the AWA World Heavyweight Championship.\n\nOn January 23, 2010, Tanaka made his debut for Jersey All Pro Wrestling (JAPW) at the promotion's 12th Anniversary Show, where he was defeated by Homicide.\n\nOn April 4, 2014, Tanaka returned to the United States, he performed at his first Wrestlecon defeating Kevin Steen. Later in the night he defeated Chris Hero at a Dragon Gate USA event.\n\nIn December of 2018 Tanaka made another return to the United States. He would face PCO in a match for the Game Changer Wrestling Extreme Title at GCW's The Dynasty event.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The government decided to consult Alberta voters to decide on liquor sales and mixed drinking after a divisive debate in the Legislature. The plebiscite was intended to deal with the growing demand for reforming antiquated liquor control laws.\n\nThe plebiscite was conducted in two parts. Question A asked in all districts, asked the voters if the sale of liquor should be expanded in Alberta, while Question B asked in a handful of districts within the corporate limits of Calgary and Edmonton asked if men and woman were allowed to drink together in establishments.\n\nProvince wide Question A of the plebiscite passed in 33 of the 50 districts while Question B passed in all five districts.

It has an area of of retail space and contains around 130 shops, including major retailers such as, John Lewis and Partners, Marks and Spencer, Zara, Schuh, Waterstone's, Hollister Co., Apple, and many more top brand names.\n\nIt is situated in the city centre, close to the docks, with entrances on the main High Street (\"Above Bar Street\"), on Portland Terrace, through Waterstone's and through John Lewis, and on Harbour Parade, through the new (2016-2017) Westquay South. There is a built-in multi-storey car park with an entrance into the centre along with a 3 tier car park beneath. Building work began in 1997 as the former Daily Echo building and Pirelli Cable Works were demolished to make way for the centre. Westquay North was opened on 28 September 2000.\n\nThe building is heated using geothermal energy, as is the civic centre. A centralised plant uses heat from an aquifer underground and then distributes it to the buildings in the city centre via a district heating scheme.\n\nThe John Lewis store replaced the local department store \"Tyrrell & Green\" (a branch of the John Lewis Partnership), which met with mixed emotions from the local people. Marks & Spencer relocated from Above Bar Street to take the second anchor store.\n\nThere have been a few major changes to the Westquay North's shops since its opening. Tower Records (which faced fierce competition from the HMV store across the street) was replaced with a Nike store, which closed after just a few months. This unit is now Pret A Manger, a sandwich retailer. Waitrose moved to Portswood in 2006 and the old Waitrose space has now been replaced by New Look, which was originally located in a smaller store a floor above. The former New Look store is now River Island. In early 2019 River Island relocated to Above Bar Street and the Unit was divided into two with Lego taking one of the newly created units. Waitrose did return, however, to Westquay North in 2015 within the lower ground floor of the John Lewis store, branded as Little Waitrose.\n\nIn mid-May 2009 the first Hollister store to be opened outside of the extended London area opened in Westquay North; this is considered to be a major coup for Westquay as it reflects well on the strength of the retail offering available within Westquay.\n\nRebranded from WestQuay in January 2017, Westquay has been constructed on the former site of the Pirelli Cable Works and the 1960s Arundel Towers development (two office tower blocks above a multi-storey car park) and it measures approximately ¼ of a mile from one end of the site to the other. Demolition of the previous buildings began in September 1997 and Westquay opened on 28 September 2000.\n\nThe development crosses over three major roads: The 20 m support structure from the two-storey glazed retail link over Portland Terrace weighs 400 tonnes, and Western Esplanade, opened in 1900 to link the Royal Pier with the West (now Central) Railway Station, was cut in half by the centre. Harbour Parade is crossed by a footbridge to the adjacent multi-storey car park.\n\nIt absorbs a 4½ metre change in ground level between east and west boundaries and the length of the mall from Above Bar to Harbour Parade is 400 m, and on top of the mall, The roof lights extend to around 350 m in length. There is a total of 32 lifts throughout the development. The steelwork took 20 weeks to design, order and manufacture, 13 tower cranes worked on the site. The tallest crane had a 66 m mast and a reach of 65 m.\n\nSouthampton's nearby Geothermal Heat Station supplies heat and chilling facilities to the centre.\n\nDuring the late-2000s, Hammerson thought up plans for a £70 million extension entitled Watermark WestQuay. In December 2012, the model of the master plan was unveiled to the public, designed by London architects Acme Space and structural engineer, AKT II. On 11 April 2013, it was announced that Hammerson had submitted the planning application to Southampton City Council, on which the council approved the outline planning application on 23 July 2013.\n\nOn 14 April 2014, Hammerson submitted detailed designs for phase one of its Watermark WestQuay scheme to Southampton City Council. On 25 June 2014, the designs for phase one of the development were approved. With the new name of WestQuay Watermark, the building work for phase one began in January 2015, with the closing of the existing walkway and the demolition of the entrance ramp.\n\nThe first phase comprises a landmark 10 screen cinema, owned by Showcase Cinemas as part of their Cinema De Lux brand, a bowling alley from Hollywood Bowl, and twenty-one restaurants (Wahaca, Zizzi, Byron Hamburgers, Five Guys, Nando's, Bill's Restaurant, Cabana, Comso, Cau, Red Dog Saloon, All Bar One, T.G.I. Friday's, The Diner, Franco Manca, Thaikhun, The Real Greek, Casa Brasil, Kupp and L'Osteria as of December 2016) alongside a large public piazza.\n\nOn 29 November 2016, it was announced that the first wave of restaurants (CAU, The Real Greek, Red Dog Saloon, Franco Manca, Thaikhun, Byron, Cabana, and COSMO) would be open on 8 December 2016. Several remaining restaurants, Hollywood Bowl and Showcase Cinema de Lux opened throughout December 2016 and early 2017.\n\nWestQuay Watermark was renamed Westquay South when the development first opened its first five restaurants (CAU, The Real Greek, Franco Manca, Thaikhun, and Byron) on 8 December 2016.\n\nShowcase Cinema de Lux, located on the 4th level of Westquay South opened on 10 February 2017.\n\nDuring summer 2012, the food terrace was re-developed. Completed by the Autumn of 2012, the updated food terrace had new restaurants, including: Wagamama; Café Rouge; Pizza Express; Ed's Easy Diner; and Tortilla Mexican Grill. The existing restaurants (McDonald's, KFC, Pizza Hut, Harry Ramsden's, and Toby's Carvery) were also refurbished.\n\nThe outside terrace area became enclosed for all-weather access, with the seating updated to include a mixture of soft and hard furnishings; and inside, a glass bridge was installed, linking Café Rouge with Wagamama. The food terrace was rebranded as 'Dining at WestQuay', for a more casual dining option.\n\nAs of March 2016, Café Rouge was replaced by The Handmade Burger Company, and Toby's Carvery was converted into a Subway\n\nAs of November 2019 the available choice on the Dining Level is McDonalds, Subway, KFC, Wagamama, Handmade Burger Co, Tortilla, Chopstix, Harry Ramsdens, Pizza Hut, Pizza Express, Ed's Easy Diner, Nando's and YO!

He established a publishing business in New York City in (1770), but quit that business after five years. He was appointed first postmaster of the city under the Continental Congress.\n\nIn 1776, he was appointed as surveyor general of the Continental Post Office. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1781.\n\nIn 1782 Hazard succeeded Richard Bache as the United States Postmaster General, serving until 1789. (From 1785 to 1790, New York City served as the capital of the United States.) During his tenure as Postmaster General under the new Federal Constitution, Hazard reorganized the Post Office. He established a system to transport mail by stagecoaches on main routes in order to increase capacity, displacing the old horse and rider system.\n\nHazard did not keep President George Washington's favor, however; because during the Constitutional Convention, he had put a stop to the customary practice by which newspaper publishers were allowed to distribute copies by mail. Washington wrote an indignant letter to John Jay about this action. He said that it was doing \"mischief\" by \"inducing a belief that the suppression of intelligence at that critical juncture was a wicked trick of policy contrived by an aristocratic junto.\" As soon as Washington could take action, he had Hazard replaced by Samuel Osgood. As a member of the old Congress Osgood had served on a committee to examine the post-office accounts.\n\nAfter being replaced, Hazard moved back to Philadelphia. He helped to establish the Insurance Company of North America in that city. He worked at this until his death. Long interested in history, in 1792 he printed the first English translation of Johannes Megapolensis' \"A Short Account of the Mohawk Indians, their Country, Language, Figure, Costume, Religion, and Government,\" first published in the Netherlands in 1644. It was a record of the Dutch missionary's observations of the Mohawk and their territory west of Albany, New York during the period of Dutch rule. Megapolensis is considered the first Protestant missionary to Native Americans.\n\nHazard also published at Philadelphia his two-volume \"Historical Collections; Consisting of State Papers, and Other Authentic Documents; Intended as Materials for an History of the United States of America.\" The first volume appeared in 1792 and the second in 1794.\n\n"}

Venezuela has distinctive and original art, literature and music.\n\nVenezuela has a rich cultural heritage. From the original Venezuelan natives to the Spanish and Africans who arrived after the Spanish conquest, the 17th century waves of immigration brought many Italians, Portuguese, Arabs, Germans, Moroccan Jews, and others from the bordering countries of South America. About 93% of Venezuelans live in urban areas in the northern part of the country. Even though almost half of the land area is south of the Orinoco River, only 5% of the population lives in that area. More than 71% of the population call themselves Catholic. The rest belong to other churches, mainly the Protestant church. The music is a part of Venezuela's heritage, art, and culture.\n\nVenezuela's heritage, art, and culture have been heavily influenced by the Caribbean context. These elements extend to its historic buildings, architecture, art, landscape and boundaries.\n\nVenezuelan art was initially dominated by religious motives but began emphasizing historical and heroic representations in the late 19th century, a move led by Martín Tovar y Tovar. Modernism took over in the 20th century. Notable Venezuelan Artists include Arturo Michelena, Cristóbal Rojas, Antonio Herrera Toro, Armando Reverón, Manuel Cabré; the kinetic artists Jesús-Rafael Soto and Carlos Cruz-Díez; and contemporary artist Yucef Merhi.\n\nIn Venezuela, there are all kinds of ancient architectural buildings. Each ancient building has its own background from where it began. All sorts of different buildings represent the country's varied past.\n\nVenezuelan literature originated soon after the Spanish conquest of the mostly pre-literate indigenous societies; it was dominated by Spanish influences. Following the rise of political literature during the War of Independence, Venezuelan Romanticism, notably expounded by Juan Vicente González and Fermin Toro emerged as the first important genre in the region. Although mainly focused on narrative writing, Venezuelan literature was also advanced by poets such as Andrés Eloy Blanco and Fermín Toro.\n\nMajor writers and novelists include Rómulo Gallegos, Teresa de la Parra, Arturo Uslar Pietri, Adriano González León, Miguel Otero Silva, and Mariano Picón Salas. Andrés Bello was also an educator and poet. Other, such as Laureano Vallenilla Lanz and José Gil Fortoul, contributed to Venezuelan positivism.\n\nIndigenous music of Venezuela is exemplified by the groups \"Un Solo Pueblo\" and Serenata Guayanesa. The national musical instrument is the \"cuatro\". Typical musical styles and pieces mainly emerged in and around the \"llanos\" region, including \"Alma Llanera\" (by Pedro Elías Gutiérrez and Rafael Bolívar Coronado), \"Florentino y el Diablo\" (by Alberto Arvelo Torrealba), \"Concierto en la Llanura\" (by Juan Vicente Torrealba), and \"Caballo Viejo\" (by Simón Díaz).\n\nThe Zulian \"gaita\" is also a popular style, generally performed during Christmas. The national dance is the \"joropo\". Teresa Carreño was a world-famous 19th-century piano virtuoso. In the last years, classical music has had great performances. The Simon Bolivar Youth Orchestra has realized excellent presentations in many European concert halls, notably at the 2007 Proms\n\nOne of the major festivals in Venezuela is the celebration of Corpus Christi where masks and uniforms of Dancing Devils, which are now almost world-famous are dancing at the streets. The tradition dates back to Spanish colonization which established deep roots and identity in Venezuela where many traditional events are made such as the celebration of Corpus Christi.\nOther minor festivals include weddings of individuals where couples are tied together in the holy matrimony.\nAt festivities in Venezuela, they like to dance salsa and merengue, as it is a popular dance in Venezuela.\n\nBaseball is Venezuela's most popular sport, although football, spearheaded by the [Venezuela national football team], is gaining influence.\n\nVenezuela is well known for its successes in beauty pageants. [Miss Venezuela] is a big event in the country, and Venezuela has received 7 [Miss Universe],6 [Miss World],8 [Miss International] titles and 2 Miss Earth titles.\n\nThe World Values Survey has consistently shown Venezuelans to be among the happiest people in the world, with 55% of those questioned saying they were \"very happy\".\n\nNick Wood\n"}

It has some of the deepest precipitous cliffs of any canyon on the planet. It is the second largest canyon in Africa, after the Fish River Canyon, and is known as one of the great wonders of nature on the continent.\n\nPossibly the best view in the whole of the Blyde River Canyon is of the \"Three Rondavels\", huge, round rocks, thought to be reminiscent of the houses or huts of the indigenous people, known as rondavels. This canyon is part of the Panorama Route. This route starts at the town Graskop and includes God's Window, the Pinnacle and Bourke's Luck Potholes.\n\nBlyde means \"glad\" or \"happy\" in old Dutch, a name derived from a voortrekkers' expedition. The 'happy river' was thus named in 1844, when Hendrik Potgieter and others returned safely from Delagoa Bay to the rest of their party of trekkers who had considered them dead. While still under this misapprehension they had named the nearby river where they had been encamped, Treurrivier, or 'mourning river'.\n\nIn 2005, the Blyde River was renamed to the Motlatse River, and the Mpumalanga Provincial Government announced that the canyon would be renamed as well. \n\nThe Blyde River Canyon supports large diversity of life, including numerous fish and antelope species as well as hippos and crocodiles, and every primate species that may be seen in South Africa (including both greater and lesser bushbabies, vervet monkeys and Samango monkeys). The diversity of birdlife is similarly high, including the beautiful and much sought Narina trogon as well as species such as the Cape vulture, black eagle, crowned eagle, African fish eagle, gymnogene, jackal buzzard, white-rumped vulture, bald ibis, African finfoot, Knysna lourie, purple-crested lourie, Gurney's sugarbird, malachite sunbird, cinnamon dove, African emerald cuckoo, red-backed mannikin, golden-tailed woodpecker, olive bush shrike, green twinspot, Taita falcons (very rarely sighted, a breeding pair lives in the nearby Abel Erasmus Pass), Cape eagle owl, white-faced owl, wood owl, peregrine falcon, black-breasted snake eagle, Wahlberg's eagle, long-crested eagle, lanner falcon, red-breasted sparrowhawk, rock kestrel and others.\n\nAt , the Kadishi Tufa waterfall is the second tallest tufa waterfall on earth. A tufa waterfall is formed when water running over dolomite rock absorbs calcium, and deposits rock formations more rapidly than they erode the surrounding rock. In the case of the Kadishi Tufa fall, the formation that has been produced strikingly resembles a face which is crying profusely, and is thus sometimes known as 'the weeping face of nature'.\n\nThe canyon and the surrounding Drakensberg escarpment is a very popular tourist region with a well-developed tourism industry supported by good public infrastructure.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1929955", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1929955", "title": "Complement (complexity)", "text": "Complement (complexity)\n\nIn computational complexity theory, the complement of a decision problem is the decision problem resulting from reversing the \"yes\" and \"no\" answers. Equivalently, if we define decision problems as sets of finite strings, then the complement of this set over some fixed domain is its complement problem.\n\nFor example, one important problem is whether a number is a prime number. Its complement is to determine whether a number is a composite number (a number which is not prime). Here the domain of the complement is the set of all integers exceeding one.\n\nThere is a Turing reduction from every problem to its complement problem. The complement operation is an involution, meaning it \"undoes itself\", or the complement of the complement is the original problem.\n\nOne can generalize this to the complement of a complexity class, called the complement class, which is the set of complements of every problem in the class. If a class is called C, its complement is conventionally labelled co-C. Notice that this is \"not\" the complement of the complexity class itself as a set of problems, which would contain a great deal more problems.\n\nA class is said to be \"closed under complement\" if the complement of any problem in the class is still in the class. Because there are Turing reductions from every problem to its complement, any class which is closed under Turing reductions is closed under complement. Any class which is closed under complement is equal to its complement class. However, under many-one reductions, many important classes, especially NP, are believed to be distinct from their complement classes (although this has not been proven).\n\nThe closure of any complexity class under Turing reductions is a superset of that class which is closed under complement. The closure under complement is the smallest such class. If a class is intersected with its complement, we obtain a (possibly empty) subset which is closed under complement.\n\nEvery deterministic complexity class (DSPACE(f(n)), DTIME(f(n)) for all f(n)) is closed under complement, because one can simply add a last step to the algorithm which reverses the answer. This doesn't work for nondeterministic complexity classes, because if there exist both computation paths which accept and paths which reject, and all the paths reverse their answer, there will still be paths which accept and paths which reject — consequently, the machine accepts in both cases.\n\nSome of the most surprising complexity results shown to date showed that the complexity classes NL and SL are in fact closed under complement, whereas before it was widely believed they were not (see Immerman–Szelepcsényi theorem). The latter has become less surprising now that we know SL equals L, which is a deterministic class.\n\nEvery class which is low for itself is closed under complement.\n"}

It was opened in the Fratton area of Portsmouth on 1 July 1885 as an interchange station between the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway and the short-lived Southsea Railway branchline.\n\nFratton railway station and the Southsea Railway were jointly opened on 1 July 1885 by Lady Ada Mary Willis, wife of General Sir George Willis, the Lieutenant Governor of Portsmouth.\n\nOn 4 July 1905, Fratton railway station's name was changed to \"Fratton & Southsea\" to promote its Southsea Railway branchline link to the seaside resort of Southsea. After the Southsea Railway branchline was closed on 6 August 1914, the name of the station was eventually changed back to \"Fratton\" on 1 December 1921. The \"Southsea\" name was later reused in 1925 to rename Portsmouth's main \"Portsmouth Town\" station to \"Portsmouth & Southsea\", as Portsmouth would be elevated from a town to city status in 1926.\n\nOne mile to the east of Fratton railway station is Fratton Park, built in 1899 as the home football ground of Portsmouth F.C.. Fratton Park's naming was purposely influenced by its proximity to the convenient Fratton railway station, although the stadium is actually located in the Milton district of Portsmouth.\n\nToday, Fratton station is located on the Portsmouth Direct Line which runs between London Waterloo and Portsmouth Harbour.\n\nFratton is one of the four railway stations on Portsea Island. Due to its location as the last south-bound stop before the main Portsmouth & Southsea railway station, Fratton has been adopted in naval slang as a euphemism for the withdrawal method of contraception, \"\"to get off at Fratton\"\".\n\nNormally, platforms 2 and 3 serve and , with platform 1 serving all other destinations. Platforms 2 and 3 are also signalled to allow northbound passenger departures.\n\nBetween 1885 and 1914, a separate island platform at Fratton station served as the interchange platform to the short-lived Southsea Railway branchline. The island was accessed from a staircase built on the south-east side of the main footbridge. This island was demolished after the Southsea Railway was closed. A modern train washing machine structure is now located on the site.\n\nThe line through Fratton and into central Portsmouth was laid on the abandoned dry canal bed of the unsuccessful Portsmouth and Arundel Canal, which was opened in 1823 and closed in 1827, after seawater from the canal contaminated some of Portsmouth's fresh water wells. In 1845 parts of this section were sold to the Chichester to Portsmouth Branch Railway company with another section being sold to the company in 1851. The former canal walls are still clearly visible between Fratton and Portsmouth city centre today.\n\nThe railway line through Fratton was planned by the Brighton and Chichester Railway as part of the Chichester to Portsmouth Branch Railway, approved in 1845. The line was completed in 1847, the Brighton and Chichester railway merging with several other companies to form the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway in 1846, who went on to operate the line.\n\nFratton railway station was planned and built to serve as an interchange station between Portsmouth and the new one-and-a-quarter mile (2 km) long Southsea Railway branch line, built to serve the fashionable Victorian seaside resort of Southsea. It was built with an additional island platform to the south of the station's three main platforms, which specifically served the Southsea Railway and was reached by a staircase leading from the main overhead footbridge. (\"this island platform and staircase was removed after the Southsea Railway was closed, its location is now used as a modern train washing facility\")\n\nOriginally, an alternative interchange station for the Southsea Railway was to be built at Copnor, Portsmouth - at the purposely built Station Road - but was never was, with Fratton being the later preferred location. Ironically, Station Road still survives in Copnor today. The unbuilt station site, near today's Copnor Bridge, has since been developed with a short row of terraced houses, a bus stop and a public lavatory block.\n\nFratton railway station and the Southsea Railway were jointly opened on 1 July 1885 by Lady Ada Mary Willis (née Neeld), wife of General Sir George Willis, the Lieutenant Governor of Portsmouth. Fratton railway station was used as the interchange station to the Southsea Railway branch line, whose original 1885 terminus at Southsea station was built on Granada Road, Southsea, replaced by East Southsea in 1904. On 4 July 1905, Fratton railway station's name was changed to \"Fratton & Southsea\".\n\nIn 1891, the main \"Portsmouth Town\" engine sheds were moved to the railway sidings at Fratton. By 1914, with the threat of the First World War and an urgent need to expand railway freight sidings in Fratton, the loss-making Southsea Railway branch line was closed to passengers on 6 August 1914 and became an overflow freight siding, and never reopened. After the war, \"Fratton & Southsea\" reverted to its original name of \"Fratton\" on 1 December 1921. The \"Southsea\" name was later reused to rename the main \"Portsmouth Town\" station in 1925, to \"Portsmouth & Southsea\".\nAfter the Motive power depot closed in the late 1950s, some former sidings were used during the withdrawal of the South West Trains greyhound fleet around 2003. The same sidings were then used in 2007 and in 2009 for freight trials, this involved DB Schenker Rail (UK) hauling small container trains to and from Eastleigh. The Idea was abandoned in 2010 due to running costs.\n\nThe Portsmouth Area Resignalling project was instigated in late 2006, aiming to improve the flexibility of the track layout in the Fratton area. Platform 1 became the Up Main, Platform 3 became the Down Main with Platform 2 as a bidirectional through platform (although the main function of platform 2 is down line trains). Prior to the project, trains could not reverse south to north at Fratton in service.\n\nThe work, scheduled by Network Rail to take place between 23 December 2006 and 4 February 2007, was subject to a massive overrun. The works were first extended six weeks into mid-March 2007 but in late February it became obvious that there were major problems with the new equipment being installed by the contractor Siemens AG.\n\nUntil 1 April 2007 there were only three trains per hour between Fratton and Portsmouth Harbour with the remaining services terminating at Fratton and passengers using a replacement bus service. After 2 April 2007 there were five trains per hour running between Fratton and Portsmouth - three South West Trains services, one Southern service and one Great Western Railway service with some services still terminating at Fratton with passengers forced to change to continue their journey. The 'six-week project' was eventually completed in October 2007 - some ten months after it started.\n\nA new footbridge is now operational, linking the island platform (platforms 2 and 3) with the Up Main platform (1). This has stairs and lifts to allow disabled users full access to all trains, with lifts designed for easy wheelchair use.\n\nThe London Brighton and South Coast Railway and the London and South Western Railway jointly built a motive power depot at Fratton in 1891, replacing an earlier one at Portsmouth Town station. It was of the double roundhouse type. It came under the ownership of Southern Railway (Great Britain) in 1923 and British Railways in 1948. This building was badly damaged by bombs during the Second World War but repaired in 1948. It closed 2 November 1959, but the building continued to be used for stabling locomotives for several years. They were demolished in 1969. Fratton Traction Maintenance Depot, operated by South Western Railway now occupies part of the site.\n\n\nRail Atlas Great Britain & Ireland, S.K. Baker \n"}

They have thick handles which are easier to grip for long periods and have better leverage, allowing more precise control and pressure.\n\nOccasionally the terms \"whittling\" and \"carving\" are used interchangeably, but they are different arts. Carving employs the use of chisels, gouges, with or without a mallet, while whittling involves only the use of a knife.

Soft woods with a small grain, such as basswood, are easier to whittle and are relatively inexpensive. Hardwoods are more difficult to whittle.\n\n"}

They also represent the bank abroad, for example at the G20. The officeholder is appointed by a qualified majority vote of the European Council, \"de facto\" by those who have adopted the euro, for an eight-year non-renewable term.\n\nWim Duisenberg was President of the European Monetary Institute (EMI) when it became the ECB, just prior to the launch of the euro, on 1 June 1998. Duisenberg then became the first President of the ECB.\n\nThe French interpretation of the agreement made with the installation of Wim Duisenberg as ECB President was that Duisenberg would resign after just four years of his eight-year term, and would be replaced by the Frenchman Jean-Claude Trichet. Duisenberg always strongly denied that such an agreement was made and stated in February 2002 that he would stay in office until his 68th birthday on 9 July 2003.\n\nIn the meanwhile Jean-Claude Trichet was not cleared of legal accusations before 1 June 2002, so he was not able to begin his term after Duisenberg's first four years. Even on 9 July 2003 Trichet was not cleared, and therefore Duisenberg remained in office until 1 November 2003. Duisenberg died on 31 July 2005.\n\nJean-Claude Trichet became President in 2003 and served during the European sovereign debt crisis. Trichet's strengths lay in keeping consensus and visible calm in the ECB. During his tenure, Trichet has had to fend off criticism from French President Nicolas Sarkozy who demanded a more growth-orientated policy at the ECB. Germany supported Trichet in demanding the bank's independence be respected. \n\nHowever, he was also criticised from straying from his mandate during the crisis by buying the government bonds of eurozone member states. ECB board members Axel A. Weber and Jürgen Stark resigned in protest at this policy, even if it helped prevent states from defaulting. IMF economist Pau Rabanal argued that Trichet \"maintained a relatively expansionary monetary policy,\" but even \"sacrificed the ECB's inflation target for the sake of greater economic growth and jobs creation, and not the other way round.\" While straying from his mandate, he has however still kept interest rates under control and maintained greater price stability than the Deutsche Bundesbank did before the euro.\n\nAs well as defending the ECB's independence and balancing its commitment to interest rates and economic stability, Trichet also fought Sarkozy for automatic sanctions in the EU fiscal reforms and against Angela Merkel against private sector involvement in bail outs so as not to scare the markets. He had however made some mistakes during the crisis, for example by: raising interest rates just after inflation topped out and just prior to the recession triggered by the Lehman Brothers collapse; also by its early timidity in buying eurozone state bonds.\n\nIn his final appearance (his 35th) before the European Parliament, Trichet called for more political unity, including; significant new powers to be granted to the ECB, the establishment of an executive branch with a European Finance Ministry and greater oversight powers for the European Parliament. He also asserted that the ECB's role in maintaining price stability throughout the financial crisis and the oil price rises should not be overlooked. He stated, in response to a question from a German newspaper attacking the ECB's credibility following its bond-buying;\n\nAlthough Axel Weber was tipped as one of the possible successors, he resigned from the ECB in protest at the bail out policies. Mario Draghi was chosen to become the next President of the ECB on 24 June 2011. Draghi was President from 1 November 2011 until 31 October 2019 (succeeded by Christine Lagarde). \n\nPascal Canfin, Member of the European Parliament for France, asserted that Draghi had been involved in swaps for European governments, namely Greece, trying to disguise their countries' economic status. Draghi responded that the deals were \"undertaken before my joining Goldman Sachs [and] I had nothing to do with\" them, in the 2011 European Parliament nomination hearings.\n\nIn December 2011, Draghi oversaw a €489 billion ($640 billion), three-year loan program from the ECB to European banks. The program was around the same size as the US Troubled Asset Relief Program (2008) though still much smaller than the overall US response including the Federal Reserve's asset purchases and other actions of that time.\n\nIn February, 2012, a second, somewhat larger round of ECB loans to European banks was initiated under Draghi, called long term refinancing operation (LTRO). One commentator, Matthew Lynn, saw the ECB's injection of funds, along with Quantitative easing from the US Fed and the Asset Purchase Facility at the Bank of England, as feeding increases in oil prices in 2011 and 2012.\n\nIn July 2012, in the midst of renewed fears about sovereigns in the eurozone, Draghi stated in a panel discussion that the ECB \"...is ready to do \"whatever it takes\" to preserve the Euro. And believe me, it will be enough.\" This statement led to a steady decline in bond yields (borrowing costs) for eurozone countries, in particular Spain, Italy and France. In light of slow political progress on solving the eurozone crisis, Draghi's statement has been seen as a key turning point in the fortunes of the Eurozone.\n\nVice President Christian Noyer was only appointed for four years so that his resignation would coincide with the expected resignation of Duisenberg. His successors, starting with Lucas Papademos, are granted eight-year terms.\n\n"}
{"id": "1930009", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1930009", "title": "British Rail Class 142", "text": "British Rail Class 142\n\nThe British Rail Class 142 is a class of \"Pacer\" diesel multiple-unit passenger trains used in England and Wales. 96 units were built by British Rail Engineering Limited's Derby Litchurch Lane Works between 1985 and 1987. They were a development of the earlier Class 141, which were introduced in 1984. The first batch (142001-050) was delivered in 1985, with the remaining units (142051-096) being delivered between 1986 and 1987.\n\nThe unit's body is based on that of the original Leyland National bus; many fixtures and fittings of the bus can be found on the units. Each unit has a seating capacity of any number between 102 and 121 passengers per two-car set. In theory there should be 106 or 121 seats per unit. However, many units have had seats removed to provide additional space for wheelchair access. The same engines and mechanical transmissions were used as on Class 141, as also the same double-folding external doors. Each car has a fuel capacity of 125 gallons.\n\nExcessive flange squeal on tight curves has been a problem on many routes operated by 142s, caused by the long wheelbase and lack of bogies. The rough ride which can result has led to the units being nicknamed (along with the related ) \"Nodding Donkey\".\n\nThe 142s that were (briefly) allocated to Cornwall in the mid-1980s were officially known as \"Skippers\". They were transferred to the north when the Cornish branch lines proved unsuitable for the Class 142; the tight bends caused excessive screeching and caused the wheels to become damaged. All Skippers left the West Country in the late 1980s.\n\nThe class was mechanically upgraded starting in the early 1990s, as the original parts were already starting to fail by then. All units carry a more powerful Cummins L10 series engine – 230 bhp per car, which equals 460 bhp (340 kW) per twin-car unit – and Voith T211r two-stage hydraulic transmission, starting with a torque converter which switches to fluid coupling drive once the unit is up to . All units were fitted with new Voith transmission by late 1991 and Cummins engines were fitted between 1993 and 1996 to improve reliability. This has proven successful, although incidents have occurred, such as when a Northern Rail unit derailed en route from Blackpool to Liverpool in June 2009, due to a cardan shaft failure. During the period of conversion, the fleet were renumbered into either the 142 2xx series or the 142 5xx series, before reverting to their original numbers (some units received the transmission change before the engine change). The original bi-folding doors fitted on the Class 142 were replaced in the 1990s due to reliability issues.\n\nFrom new, some units were painted according to the region they operated in. For example, the first 14 Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive sponsored units (142001-014) received GMPTE orange and brown, then the next 13 West Country based units (142015-027) were painted in a Great Western Railway inspired chocolate and cream livery and marketed as 'Skippers'.\n\nUpon the privatisation of British Rail, the Class 142 Fleet was divided between North Western Trains in the North West and Northern Spirit in the North East.\n\nNorthern Spirit started its operations in 1997 and continued until 2000. At this point, parent company MTL ran into difficulties and the company was sold to Arriva, who renamed it as Arriva Trains Northern.\n\nIn 1998 ATN swapped seven Class 142s (142085-142091) for seven Class 150/2 units from Valley Lines. In October–December 2002 these were swapped for unrefurbished units 142072-77 and 080–3, as 142086-091 had only recently been refurbished by Northern Spirit and Valley Lines wished to start their refurbishment from scratch.\n\nIn 2004 First North Western and Arriva Trains Northern was merged into the Northern rail franchise, which inherited a combined fleet of 79 Class 142s.\n\nAll 79 Class 142s are now painted in Northern Rail livery. Due to rising passenger numbers in the north of England (by about 10% per annum and even by over 25% per annum at some stations where 142s are in operation), some units have been replaced by Sprinter trains.\n\nFive Class 142 Pacers, in service with First Great Western, were returned to Northern Rail in December 2008; the rest returned to Northern Rail by November 2011, much later than originally planned.\n\nDespite being built for branch-line stopping services, the Class 142s are mainly used on urban commuter services in and out of cities like Liverpool, Manchester, Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle and can be seen on longer-distance services of up to three hours including the 1632 Middlesbrough-Carlisle service (nearly 110 miles); they had also been used on services between Blackpool North and Chester via Stockport, which ceased to operate in December 2008. All 79 passed with the Northern franchise to Arriva Rail North in April 2016, and any remaining units transferred to the government-owned operator Northern Trains on 1 March 2020.\n\nA total of seventeen Class 142 units based at Newton Heath TMD (142041-049 and 142051-058) were refurbished for use on Merseyside Passenger Transport Executive's City Line on services around the Liverpool and Greater Manchester areas. The refurbishment included dot-matrix route indicators, a new design of individual low-backed seating and the units were repainted into Merseyrail's livery. Upon privatisation, these units passed to First North Western in March 1997. All of these sets transferred to Northern in 2016, however remained in the livery of previous operator Northern Rail.\n\nValley Lines acquired its Class 142s by swapping Class 150/2 units with Arriva Trains Northern. The Class 142s were initially painted in Valley Lines livery.\n\nTransport for Wales uses its Class 142 \"Pacer\" trains on the commuter lines around Cardiff, Barry and Penarth known as the Valley lines. All of its Class 142 \"Pacer\" fleet now bear the turquoise and cream house colours of Arriva Trains Wales.\n\nThe Class 142s are frequently used for the Cardiff to Penarth service calling at Grangetown, Dingle Road, and Penarth.\n\nThe Class 142 units are also primarily used on South Wales Valley line routes and routes through the Vale of Glamorgan. On Valley and Vale of Glamorgan services, Class 142s are often coupled together with Class 143 or Class 150 units to cope with demand on the busy Valley Lines network. The Class 142s have received minor refurbishments with retrimmed seats in new moquette, plus the installation of ceiling-mounted CCTV cameras.\n\nTwelve Class 142 \"Pacers\" were received by First Great Western in 2007, and started operations in December 2007. These were loaned from Northern (where they had been stored), in part to cover for the refurbishment of FGW's Sprinter fleets but also to allow the Class 158s to be reformed as three-coach sets.\n\nThe 142s were based at Exeter TMD, working alongside the similar on services in Devon and Cornwall, including the Avocet Line, Riviera Line and Tarka Line.\n\nFive 142s were returned to Northern Rail in the autumn of 2008, following the completion of the refresh of Class 150 Sprinter units. The remaining seven units were returned to Northern Rail in November 2011 after being replaced by class 150 units cascaded from London Overground and London Midland.\n\nAll 94 Class 142s will be withdrawn by mid-2020, as they do not comply with the Persons with Reduced Mobility Technical Specification for Interoperability (PRM-TSI).\n\nBidders for the Northern franchise that commenced in April 2016 were required to order new DMUs and take on \"Sprinters\" and \"Turbostars\" (Classes 150, 156, 158 and 170) released by other franchises as replacement. The Long Term Passenger Rolling Stock Strategy for the Rail Industry indicates up to 500 non-electric carriages will need to be built in the short term. Northern withdrawals were scheduled to commence in November 2018 with the last to be removed from traffic in October 2019. This has been slightly delayed until the first Class 195s enter service.\n\nWales & Borders franchise holder KeolisAmey Wales will replace all of its Class 142s by mid-2020.\n\nIn August 2019, Northern retired seven and placed them in store at Heaton TMD. Scrapping commenced in December 2019 with 142005 taken to CF Booth, Rotherham. In December 2019, three withdrawn Northern units were transferred to Transport for Wales for spare parts.\n\nIn December 2019, both Northern and Transport for Wales were issued derogations to allow use into 2020. Northern Trains are permitted to the use the units until the 31 May 2020, but only whilst coupled to a compliant unit, whilst Transport for Wales are permitted to use the units until 31 July 2020 and can be operated alone.\n\nFifteen class 142s have so far been saved/earmarked for preservation. The majority all being ex-Northern operated units. Unit no 142001 is part of the National Collection and preserved at the National Railway Museum Shildon. Additionally, three further units are to be preserved. Unit 142003 is to be purchased by a private individual, two further units 142023 and 142036 are to also be preserved following withdrawal from service in May 2020. 142023 will be based at the Plym Valley Railway and 142036 at the East Kent Railway. \n\nA further two units are also preserved on the Chasewater Railway, the Wensleydale Railway and Whitrope Heritage Centre each.\n\n142027 was purchased as a spares donor for the Chasewater Railway's two operational Class 142 units (142029 and 142030).\n\nAlongside the operational preserved class 142s, one has already been acquired by South Wales Police.\n\nIn 1987, Hornby Railways launched its first version of the BR Class 142 (Pacer) railbus in OO gauge.\n\nSelect units have previously carried names.\n\n\nJohn Pugh, the then Liberal Democrat MP for Southport, described the 142 trains as \"unsafe\". However the UK Government's Transport Secretary at the time Geoff Hoon denied this claim saying, \"I would not accept that any of that rolling stock is unsafe\", and that they constantly upgrade them.\n\n"}

There is a variety of football Naadan panthukali in which they use a small leather ball the size of a cricket ball. This game has five innings, and normally it will take three hours to get finished. \n\nThe mythological belief associated with Manarcad Sri Bhagavathy Temple is: There lived a pious Brahmin in Thanniyil Ellam in Elambanakkadu. He was a great devotee of Kodugalloor Amma, and visited Kodugalloor Temple often. Due to his old age and failing health, he prayed to continue his devotion towards kodugalloor amma\".That day night Amma told him in a dream \"When you wake up, you will find a Kuda (traditional umbrella) near you.I will be with that Kuda. You will never again need to come to Kodugalloor to worship me. \nhe found it as directed. When he reached near Elambanakkadu, he broke his journey to take some rest placing the Kuda on the ground. But after taking rest, he was not able to lift the Kuda. He met the local ruler and informed the matter. An Astrologer was summoned and he detected the holy presence of Kodugalloor Amma. He again got Amma’s direction in his dream – to build a Bhagavathy Temple in the nearby Choorakkadu (bamboo forest) which was the abode of a Nagarajan (Snake God). Thus the Temple was built with popular support. \nDuring that time, a Yakshi (Demon) named Elambi was creating problems in that area. It is believed that Amma killed Elambi and her cronies. Elambi’s Mani (bell) was thrown southwards in the area. Since the Mani was thrown, Elambanakkadu came to be known as the forest where the bell was thrown, which worded Maniyerkadu – later became Manarcad.\n\nThe desire of forefathers for a holy place to pray and perform religious ceremonies for the Pilgrim Christians was the root cause of construction of the church. They fasted and prayed for this purpose. On the eighth day of their prayer, they all had a vision. Holy fathers compared Virgin Mary with The 'Sakshipettakam' which was created by Mossaih according to the order of God. The circumference of this 'Sakhshipettakam' was 8 \"muzhams\" (around 12 feet). The number connected with the salvation secrets of Virgin Mary and her son Jesus Christ was also considered to be 8). The vision was to build the church in the forest where a calf and cow were lying down, where the fish and deer could be caught and Acacia Instia and canes were scattered around. (Acasia Redhirama, the wood which used to fabricate the 'Sakshipettakam' and Acasia Instra which was the Holy Fathers dreamt of were of the same species.\nThe stone inscriptions found at the church reveal that the church was built more than 1000 years ago. Archaeologists have found that these stone inscriptions were memorial stones set up at the tombs in 910 A.D. and 920 A.D. and the writing on them is in Malayalam and Tamil scripts prevalent 600 years ago.\nAfterwards, on several occasions, the church was rebuilt and renewed. In the 16th century, there was not a single church in the land which was not re-built in the Portuguese style. It is believed that the Manarcad church also was re-built at that time in the model of the Kottayam Cheriya Pally. This church is under the faith of Jacobite /Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church. The head of the Jacobite church is Patriarch of Antioch Moran Mor Ignatius Aphrem II and the head of the Malankara Jacobite Church of Catholicose Baselios Thomas I\n\n\n"}

One ball is fixed at each end of the string, and the center ball is free to slide along the string between the two end balls. Inside each ball is a metal weight. The metal weight lowers the moment of inertia of the center ball so it can rotate rapidly in response to torques applied by the string. This prevents the string from snagging or tangling around the center ball.\n\nRoughly, Astrojax play is a cross between juggling, yo-yo, and lasso. A wide variety of tricks and maneuvers can be performed with it. The basic orbits are vertical orbits, horizontal orbits and a figure-eight (butterfly) pattern.\n\nAstrojax has been used to teach physics at the grade school, high school, and college levels, NASA has taken Astrojax into outer space as part of its Toys in Space education program, and Astrojax has even been the subject of research on nonlinear dynamics, chaos, and the N-body problem on a sphere using sophisticated computer modeling and advanced mathematics. Astrojax can, for instance, be used to demonstrate conservation of angular momentum, how reducing an object's moment of inertia will increase the object's angular velocity, and how the earth's gravity keeps the moon in its orbit.\n\nAstrojax was invented by Cornell University physics graduate student Larry Shaw in 1986 while fiddling with hex nuts and dental floss. It first appeared on the market in 1994 as a polyurethane foam version, when it was sold through The Nature Company, under the name of \"Orbit Balls.\" Over the next several years it was sold by New Toy Classics. From 2000 to 2015, Astrojax was licensed by Active People, a Swiss company specializing in yo-yos, juggling toys, kites and open-ended toys such as Bilibo. In 2003 corporate chains such as Target, Walmart, KB Toys, and Toys-R-Us started to carry the product.\n\nSeveral different types of Astrojax were sold by Active People, including: \n\nIn 2014, Larry Shaw terminated Active People's license for Astrojax due to breaches of contract, including failure to pay royalties. In 2015, Larry Shaw initiated an international arbitration against Active People due to their continuing sales of Astrojax. The Final Award of the arbitration lawsuit included an injunction against Active People's sales of Astrojax and award to Shaw of back royalties. The Final Award assigned fees and expenses for the arbitration to Active People, indicating Active People had no legal grounds for their failure to pay royalties or honor the termination of their license for Astrojax. In 2017, a US District Court issued an award which included a federal injunction against Active People's sales of Astrojax.\n\nIn late 2017, Larry Shaw relaunched Astrojax with the Astrojax Weave. The Astrojax Weave has hand-made, fair trade crocheted balls which are stuffed with environmentally-friendly recycled cork granules. The Weave has balls which are 4.5 cm in diameter, which is larger than any previous version of Astrojax. The Weave comes in three Maya versions which have lighter balls on a shorter string, six Spectra versions which have intermediate weight balls on an intermediate length string, and two Pro versions which have heavier balls on a longer string.\n\nAstrojax, Weave, Aqua, Maya, Spectra, vortex, string bud, Free-Dimensional Orbiter, Saturn, Blue Diamond, are trademarks of New Toy Classics of San Francisco, CA.\n\nAstrojax has won a number of toy awards, has been taken into outer space by NASA for their \"Toys in Space\" program.\n\nThere are three Astrojax categories in the Guinness Book of World Records database.\n\n1. Horizontal Orbit: One of the balls is held in the user's hand, the other two maintain horizontal orbits underneath. The two spinning balls counterbalance each other. This is maintained by small movements of the top ball to keep the orbits from slowing. The trick can be started by holding both the top and bottom balls (the top one directly below the bottom one), and spinning the middle ball. Then releasing the bottom ball creates a horizontal orbit.\n\n2. Vertical Orbit: Similar to the horizontal orbit, but with the bottom and middle balls orbiting perpendicular to the ground. By tugging slightly on the ball in hand, the orbit continues however long the user desires. This is the starting movement for both tricks.\n\n3. Butterfly: Starting with a vertical orbit the top hand is moved left and right quickly, in time with the rotation of the bottom ball. This causes the balls to move in a shape resembling a helix.\n\n4. Switch: During a vertical orbit the top ball is released and the bottom ball is caught. The orbit now continues with their positions reversed. This trick can be performed repeatedly to add to the effect.\n\n5. Venus: The bottom ball of a vertical orbit is pulled hard so that it travels over the users arm, followed by the middle ball. This trick can also be repeated for added effect.\n\n6. Thriller or \"Eskimo Yo-Yo\": Hold the middle ball in one hand and start swinging the right ball around it. Then, throw the left ball around and around and watch them swing.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1930042", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1930042", "title": "Mr. Sandman", "text": "Mr. Sandman\n\n\"Mr. Sandman\" (sometimes rendered as \"Mister Sandman\") is a popular song written by Pat Ballard which was published in 1954 and first recorded in May of that year by Vaughn Monroe & His Orchestra and later that same year by The Chordettes and The Four Aces. The song's lyrics convey a request to \"Mr. Sandman\" to \"bring me a dream\" – the traditional association with the folkloric figure, the sandman. The pronoun used to refer to the desired dream is often changed depending on the sex of the singer or group performing the song, as the original sheet music publication, which includes male and female versions of the lyrics, intended. Emmylou Harris' recording of the song was a hit in multiple countries in 1981.\n\nVaughn Monroe with Orchestra was the first to record the song in 1954. It was released as the B-side of \"They Were Doin' the Mambo\", on RCA Victor label as catalog number 20-5767 / 47-5767.\n\nIn December 1954, the song reached No. 1 on the \"Cash Box\" Top 50, in a tandem ranking of the versions by the Chordettes, the Four Aces, Buddy Morrow, Vaughn Monroe, Les Elgart, the Lancers, and the Song Singers, with the Chordettes and the Four Aces' versions marked as bestsellers. It also reached No. 1 on \"Cash Box\"s chart of \"The Nation's Top Ten Juke Box Tunes\", in the same tandem ranking, and No. 1 on \"Cash Box\"s chart of \"The Ten Records Disk Jockeys Played Most This Week\", with only the Chordettes version listed initially, but later in a tandem ranking of the Chordettes and the Four Aces' versions.\n\nThe song also reached No. 1 on \"Billboard\"s \"Honor Roll of Hits\", with the Chordettes and the Four Aces' versions listed as best sellers, and was ranked No. 12 on \"Billboard\"s ranking of \"1955's Top Tunes\" based on the Honor Roll of Hits.\n\nThe chord progression in each chorus follows the circle of fifths through a lengthy series of secondary dominant chords (VII7, III7, VI7, II7, V7, Imaj7).\n\nThe Chordettes' recording of the song was released on the Cadence Records label. Cadence's founder, Archie Bleyer, was the orchestra conductor on the recording and provided a rhythmic beat on the recording, using his knees. Bleyer's voice is heard in the third verse, when he says the word \"Yes?\" The piano is played by Moe Wechsler. Liberace's name is mentioned for his \"wavy hair\", and a glissando (a flourish common in his music) immediately follows. Pagliacci is mentioned for having a lonely heart, which is a reference to the opera \"Pagliacci\" by Ruggero Leoncavallo.\n\nIn the United States, the Chordettes' single reached No. 1 on all three of \"Billboard\"s popular music charts, and was ranked No. 9 in \"Cash Box\"s ranking of \"1955's Top Pop Records as Voted in the \"Cash Box\" Poll\".\n\nIn 1954, The Four Aces released a version of the song, backed by the Jack Pleis Orchestra. The Four Aces' version was a top-ten hit in the United States, United Kingdom, and Flanders. The Four Aces' version was notably featured in the movie \"Back to the Future\", when Marty first realizes he is in 1955.\n\nOn November 17, 1954, Chet Atkins recorded an instrumental version during a four-song recording session at RCA Victor's Nashville recording studio. Atkins used the Ray Butts EchoSonic guitar amp on this recording, and was backed by celesta, piano, bass, and drums. Atkins' version was released as a single in January 1955. It was Atkins' first single to chart on \"Billboard\"s country charts, and reached No. 15 on \"Billboard\"s Country & Western Records chart of \"Best Sellers in Stores\" and No. 13 on \"Billboard\"s Country & Western Records chart of \"Most Played by Jockeys\".\n\nAtkins re-recorded \"Mister Sandman\" for his 1990 album \"The Magic of Chet Atkins\".\n\n\nIn 1968, Bert Kaempfert and His Orchestra released an instrumental version as a single and on the album \"My Way of Life\". It reached No. 12 on \"Billboard\"s Easy Listening chart, No. 14 on \"Record World\"s \"Top Non-Rock\" chart, No. 3 on \"Record World\"s chart of \"Singles Coming Up\", and No. 1 on \"Cash Box\"s \"Looking Ahead\" chart of singles with potential of entering the \"Cash Box\" Top 100.\n\nIn January 1978, Emmylou Harris, Dolly Parton, and Linda Ronstadt recorded a version of the song for a planned trio album which was ultimately scrapped. (The three would eventually reunite and release the first of two \"Trio\" albums nearly a decade later in 1987). Harris included the trio recording of \"Mr. Sandman\" on her 1981 album \"Evangeline\", though with the stipulation that it not be released as a single (given that Parton and Ronstadt both were affiliated with other record labels). However, when Harris later changed her mind and wanted to put the song out as a single, she rerecorded it, singing all three parts herself, and releasing it in 1981, under the title \"Mister Sandman\". The single reached number 10 on the \"Billboard\" Hot Country Singles chart, and number 37 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, making it Harris' only single to reach the top 40 on that chart.\n\nHarris's single version did not appear on an album until the 1984 compilation \"\".\n\n\nBuddy Morrow and His Orchestra released a version in 1954, which reached No. 20 on \"Billboard\"s chart of \"Most Played by Jockeys\".\n\nIn January 1955, a version by Max Bygraves reached No. 16 on the UK's \"New Musical Express\" chart.\n\nThe most successful recording of the song in the UK was by Dickie Valentine, which peaked at No. 5 on the \"New Musical Express\" chart in February 1955.\n\nThe Fleetwoods released a version in 1964, as a single and on the album \"Before and After\". Their version reached No. 113 on \"Billboard\"s Bubbling Under the Hot 100 chart and No. 19 on \"Cash Box\"s \"Looking Ahead\" chart of singles with potential of entering the \"Cash Box\" Top 100.\n\nTommy O'Day released a version in 1978, which reached No. 96 on \"Billboard\"s Hot Country Singles chart.\n\nIn 1996, German power metal band Blind Guardian released a CD maxi single with a cover version of \"Mr. Sandman.\"\n\nBette Midler recorded the song for her 2014 album \"It's the Girls!.\n\nIn 2017 SYML released a cover, which was described as \"an ominous and brooding song full of dark waves of emotion.\"\n\nSome time later, Ballard also rewrote the lyrics for Christmas use as \"Mr. Santa\". Singer Dorothy Collins released \"Mr. Santa\" in 1955, which reached No. 51 in \"Music Vendor\". Amy Grant recorded a version included on the 1999 album \"A Christmas to Remember\".\n\n"}

{"id": "1930044", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1930044", "title": "Mickey Tettleton", "text": "Mickey Tettleton\n\nMickey Lee Tettleton (born September 16, 1960), is an American former professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball for the Oakland Athletics, Baltimore Orioles, Detroit Tigers, and Texas Rangers. Although Tettleton played mostly as a catcher, he also played as a first baseman, an outfielder, and as a designated hitter.\n\nTettleton was named after Baseball Hall of Fame member and fellow Oklahoman, Mickey Mantle. Like the former Yankee star, Tettleton was a switch hitter. He was recognized for having an unusual batting stance: he stood almost straight up at the plate, holding his bat horizontal and bending only when the pitcher began his delivery. He was also distinguished by the huge wad of chewing tobacco he kept in his cheek during games, as well as his claim that Froot Loops were the source of his hitting power.\n\nTettleton grew up in Oklahoma City, where he attended Southeast High School before enrolling at Oklahoma State University. In 1980, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Wareham Gatemen of the Cape Cod Baseball League. He played for the Oklahoma State Cowboys baseball team that reached the finals in the 1981 College World Series, before losing to the Arizona State Sun Devils. Tettleton was named to the 1981 College World Series All-Tournament Team as an outfielder.\n\nTettleton was drafted by the Oakland Athletics in the fifth round of the 1981 Major League Baseball draft. He spent three seasons in the minor leagues playing for the Modesto Athletics of the California League. He began the 1984 season with the Double-A Albany A's but was promoted to the major leagues in June when Athletics catcher Jim Essian suffered a broken hand. Tettleton made his major league debut with Oakland on June 30, 1984, at the age of 23. He served as a backup catcher to Mike Heath until December 1985, when the Athletics traded Heath and Tim Conroy to the St. Louis Cardinals for Joaquín Andújar, keeping Tettleton as their starting catcher.\n\nTettleton was given the starting catcher's job for the 1986 season, but his offensive statistics failed to impress. He posted a .204 batting average in 90 games, along with 10 home runs and 35 runs batted in. His defensive abilities were termed as adequate. By the end of the season, Athletics manager Tony La Russa had Tettleton platooning with the left-hand hitting catcher, Jerry Willard. Tettleton began the 1987 season as the Athletics starting catcher. However, injuries and weak hitting limited him to 82 games, as newcomer Terry Steinbach began to make a positive impression. He ended the year with a dismal .194 batting average. On March 28, 1988, the Athletics released Tettleton during spring training. On April 5, he signed a contract to play for the Rochester Red Wings in the Baltimore Orioles organisation.\n\nTettleton started the season in Rochester but was soon called back to the major leagues, where he shared catching duties with Terry Kennedy in 1988, and improved his batting average significantly to .261. 1989 was a breakout year for Tettleton as he started the season hitting 13 home runs in April and May, setting a new major league record for catchers. He hit 20 home runs by midseason, earning him a place as a reserve player for the American League team in the 1989 All-Star Game. In August, Tettleton had to undergo surgery to remove a cyst from his left knee and missed almost one month. He finished the season with a .258 batting average, 26 home runs, 65 runs batted in, and an impressive .369 on-base percentage, helping the Orioles improve from last place in the American League East in 1988 to second place in 1989, two games behind the Toronto Blue Jays. Tettleton's hitting performance earned him the 1989 American League Silver Slugger Award, which is awarded annually to the best offensive player at each position.\n\nTettleton's offensive output dropped in 1990 with a .223 batting average, 15 home runs, and 51 runs batted in. Although he struck out 160 times, setting a major league strikeout record for switch hitters, his on-base percentage increased from the previous year to .376, in part due to the 106 base on balls. In October, he was selected to the Associated Press All-Star team. At the end of the year, Tettleton opted for free agency, then surprised the Orioles by accepting their salary arbitration offer. They had expected him to accept a higher offer from another team and were not prepared to pay him more than $1 million. Two days after acquiring high-priced players Glenn Davis and Dwight Evans, the Orioles traded Tettleton to the Detroit Tigers for pitcher Jeff Robinson in what was seen as a cost-saving measure on the part of the Orioles.\n\nTettleton's batting rebounded in 1991, producing his highest home run totals, including a stretch in late June when he hit 7 home runs in seven games. He also became only the fifth player in major league history to hit two home runs over the right field roof of Tiger Stadium. By the end of the season, he had compiled a .263 batting average with 31 home runs, 89 runs batted in, and a .387 on-base percentage, earning his second Silver Slugger Award and helping the Tigers to finish second in the American League East Division. In October, he was selected to the Associated Press All-Star team for a second time. On October 27, 1991, the Tigers rewarded his performance by signing him to a three-year contract worth $8.5 million.\n\nTettleton had another productive year in 1992. On April 20, he became the first player to hit a ball onto Eutaw Street which runs behind right field at Baltimore's Camden Yards. In a poll of American League managers prior to the 1992 All-Star Game, Tettleton came out on top as their choice to be the starting All-Star catcher. However, the fans voted for Sandy Alomar, Jr. Tettleton produced a .238 batting average, a career-high 32 home runs, 83 runs batted in, a .379 on-base percentage, and led the American League with 122 base on balls, to win his third Silver Slugger Award. He also led American League catchers with a .996 fielding percentage, committing only 2 errors in 113 games as a catcher. In a 1992 computer ranking of major league players, which used offensive and defensive statistics over the previous two seasons, Tettleton was ranked first among American League catchers. In October, he was selected as the catcher for the \"Sporting News\" American League All-Star team.\n\nTettleton continued to produce respectable offensive statistics in 1993. By midseason, he was tied with Barry Bonds for the major league home run lead of 24, along with 73 runs batted in, yet he was once again snubbed by fans in the voting for the 1993 All-Star Game. Cito Gaston, the American League manager for the All-Star game, also received criticism for failing to name Tettleton as a reserve player. In order to get more bats in the lineup, Detroit manager Sparky Anderson began to use Tettleton at other positions: he played 59 games as a first baseman, 56 games as a catcher, and 55 games as an outfielder. He ended the season with a .245 batting average and a .372 on-base percentage, along with 32 home runs and a career-high 110 runs batted in, helping the Tigers lead the American League in runs for the second consecutive year.\n\nTettleton had 14 home runs and 41 runs batted in at the All-Star break in 1994 and was selected by Cito Gaston as a reserve player in the 1994 All-Star Game, perhaps to make amends for the previous year's snub. He continued to play as a first baseman and an outfielder; however, the majority of his games were played as catcher until the season ended prematurely when major league players decided to go on strike in August. In the final year of his contract with the Tigers, Tettleton's offensive statistics dropped to a .248 average with 17 home runs and 51 runs batted in, although he posted a career-high .419 on-base percentage.\n\nTettleton was granted free agency, and in April 1995, he signed a one-year contract for $550,000 to play for the Texas Rangers. With Iván Rodríguez having a secure hold on the Rangers' catching job, Tettleton played mostly as a right fielder and designated hitter. He posted a .238 batting average and matched his career high with 32 home runs along with 72 runs batted in.\n\nIn December 1995, he turned down a lucrative offer from the New York Yankees and chose to remain with the Rangers, signing a two-year contract worth $2.5 million. He continued to play mostly as a designated hitter and occasional first baseman, ending the year with a .246 average, 24 home runs, and 83 runs batted in, to help the Rangers clinch the 1996 American League West Division title. In the 1996 American League Division Series against the New York Yankees, Tettleton struggled in the only post-season appearance of his career, striking out seven times and hitting for just an .083 batting average, as the Rangers lost the series in four games.\n\nPlaying exclusively as a designated hitter in 1997, he was hitting for just a .091 average in 17 games when he announced his retirement in July at the age of 36.\n\nIn a thirteen-year major league career, Tettleton played in 1,485 games, accumulating 1,132 hits in 4,698 at bats, for a .241 career batting average, along with 245 home runs, 732 runs batted in, and a .369 on-base percentage. He retired with a .991 fielding percentage in 872 games as a catcher, a .979 fielding percentage in 142 games as an outfielder, and a .986 fielding percentage in 125 games as a first baseman.\n\nA two-time All-Star, Tettleton was considered one of the best-hitting catchers of his era, winning three Silver Slugger Awards. At the time of his retirement, he ranked eighth in major league history in career home runs by a switch-hitter. Tettleton's .369 on-base percentage ranks him 10th highest all-time among major league catchers. His .821 on-base plus slugging percentage is 11th highest all-time among major league catchers.\n\nTettleton hit over 30 home runs four times in his career, and was also known for his patience at the plate, accumulating 949 career walks. He led the American League in 1992 with 122 walks and finished in the top ten in six other seasons, including second three times. But his selective style at the plate, combined with his power-hitting mentality, led to Tettleton's 1,307 career strike-outs, 105th on baseball's all-time list as of 2010.\n\nIn his book, \"The Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract\", baseball historian Bill James ranked Tettleton 37th all-time among major league catchers.\n\nTettleton and his wife, Shannon have four children – Tyler, who is the offensive quality control coach for the Cleveland Browns., Jessica, Shanny and Tate.\n\nIn 1994, Tettleton made a cameo appearance in the film, \"Little Big League\", about a 12-year-old boy who inherits a major league baseball team.\n\n\n, or Retrosheet, or Pura Pelota\n"}

Funding takes the form of contracts or grants. The recipient projects must have the potential for commercialization and must meet specific U.S. government R&D needs.\n\nThe SBIR program was created to support scientific excellence and technological innovation through the investment of federal research funds in critical American priorities to build a strong national economy ... one business at a time. In the words of program founder Roland Tibbetts: \"to provide funding for some of the best early-stage innovation ideas -- ideas that, however promising, are still too high risk for private investors, including venture capital firms.\" For the purposes of the SBIR program, the term \"small business\" is defined as a for-profit business with fewer than 500 employees, owned by one or more \"individuals\" who are citizens of, or permanent resident aliens in, the United States of America.\n\nFunds are obtained by allocating a certain percentage of the total extramural (R&D) budgets of the 11 federal agencies with extramural research budgets in excess of $100 million. Approximately $2.5 billion is awarded through this program each year. The United States Department of Defense (DoD) is the largest agency in this program with approximately $1 billion in SBIR grants annually. Over half the awards from the DoD are to firms with fewer than 25 people and a third to firms of fewer than 10. A fifth are minority or women-owned businesses. Historically a quarter of the companies receiving grants are receiving them for the first-time. Besides the DoD, there are also programs with the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the Department of Agriculture, and others.\n\nThe SBIR program agencies award monetary contracts and/or grants in phases I and II of a three-phase program:\nThe company owns the intellectual property and all commercialization rights. Companies such as Symantec, Qualcomm, Da Vinci Surgical System, Jawbone, Lift Labs, Natel Energy and iRobot received early-stage funding from this program.\n\nEach Federal agency with an extramural budget for R&D in excess of $100,000,000 must participate in the SBIR Program and reserve at least 3.2% of such budget in fiscal year 2017 and each fiscal year after. A Federal agency may exceed these minimum percentages. In 2010, the SBIR program across 11 federal agencies provided over $2 Billion in grants and contracts to small U.S. businesses for research in innovation leading to commercialization.\n\n, SBIR programs are in place at the following agencies:\n\nA similar program, the Small Business Technology Transfer Program (STTR), uses a similar approach to the SBIR program to expand public/private sector partnerships between small businesses and nonprofit U.S. research institutions. The main difference between the SBIR and STTR programs is that the STTR program requires the company to have a partnering research institution which must be awarded a minimum of 30% of the total grant funds. As of 2014 federal agencies with external R&D budgets over $1 billion were required to fund STTR programs using an annual set-aside of 0.40%.\n\nThe Small Business Technology Council, a member council of the National Small Business Association, hands out the Tibbetts Award annually \"to small firms, projects, organizations and individuals judged to exemplify the very best in SBIR achievement.\"\n\nFederal and State (FAST) is a program of State-based business mentoring and assistance to aid small businesses in the preparation of SBIR proposals and management of the contracts. It is more active in some states than others.\n\nThe program was established with the enactment into law of the Small Business Innovation Development Act in 1982 to award federal research grants to small businesses. The SBIR program has four original objectives: to stimulate technological innovation; to use small business to meet Federal research and development needs; to foster and encourage participation by minority and disadvantaged persons in technological innovation; and to increase private sector commercialization innovations derived from Federal research and development.\n\nThe program must be periodically reauthorized by the United States Congress, but reauthorization is generally included in each new budget. The program was re-authorized through FY2017 by the 2012 Defense Authorization Act (P.L.112-81).\n\nRep. Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI) has proposed the SBIR Enhancement Act of 2011 as HR 447 of the 112th Congress, which increases the funding for SBIR by increasing the funding tax from the original 2.5% up to 5%, raises the Phase 1 amount to $200,000 and provides for economic adjustments every five years.\n\nHistorical minimum percentages of their \"extramural\" R&D budgets for awards to small business concerns are:\n\n\nA Federal agency may exceed these minimum percentages.\n\n\n"}

As of , Monaco is the only microstate which has won the contest.\n\nMonaco finished last at its first contest in 1959 before achieving three top three results in the 1960s. Two of these were achieved by François Deguelt, who finished third in and second in . Romuald also finished third in . Severine's victory in 1971 was the first of five top four results in eight years. The others were achieved by Romauld (who returned to place fourth in ), Mary Christy who was third in , Michèle Torr, fourth in and Caline & Olivier Toussaint who were fourth in . After participating in , Monaco was absent from the contest for 25 years.\n\nMonaco is the only country to have internally selected all of their participants. While some countries organise televised national finals, it is believed that TMC does not have enough money to organise national finals.\n\nMonaco returned to the contest for three years from to but failed to qualify for the final on all three occasions. The Monegasque broadcaster then withdrew from the contest, stating that regional voting patterns in the contest have effectively given Monaco no chance of qualifying for the final.\n\nMonaco participated in the contest 21 times between its debut in 1959 and 1979. Afterwards the country withdrew from the contest for financial reasons. It only returned in 2004, 25 years after its last participation. It withdrew again in 2007, after failing to qualify for the final for three consecutive years.\n\nMonaco won the contest in , with the song \"Un banc, un arbre, une rue\", performed by Séverine. The Monegasque victory is rather particular in the history of Eurovision as neither the songwriter, the singer, nor director were from the country they represented, something which also was the case with four of Luxembourg’s five victories. Séverine even declared to journalists that she had never set foot in Monaco, forgetting that the video-clip was filmed there. Séverine's producer was dishonest with her and stole her prize, thus she never got paid for her victory, even after suing him. Nevertheless, the singer is still a great fan of the contest.\n\nMonaco's next best placing is second place, which it has achieved once in .

After winning in 1971, the country decided to organise the 1972 contest as an open-air show, setting the date in June rather than early spring. However, because of a lack of funds and material, Télé Monte Carlo sought help from the French public broadcaster, ORTF, which accepted to organise the contest. Because TMC wanted the show to be held in Monaco while ORTF wanted it in France, negotiations never succeeded. Monaco left it up to the EBU. The EBU asked Spain and Germany, who respectively finished second and third at the 1971 contest, but the countries were not interested in organising the 1972 contest. It was eventually organised by the BBC in Edinburgh.\n\nMonaco was absent from the contest between 1980 and 2003, before returning for three years from 2004–2006, but Maryon (2004), Lise Darly (2005) and Séverine Ferrer (2006) all failed to progress from the semi-finals. TMC broadcast the 2007 contest, opening the way for participation in the Eurovision Song Contest 2008. However, TMC decided against it.\n\nTMC had announced that it was possible Monaco would return to the contest in 2009 after a two-year absence, following talks with the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), the organiser of the contest, as well as new voting measures implemented in the contest that year. Despite this, Monaco did not compete in Moscow in 2009. The EBU announced they would work harder to bring Monaco back into the Contest in alongside other lapsed participants.\n\nFormer head of the Monégasque delegation Philippe Boscagli has accused certain countries of geopolitical voting, alleging the existence of Eastern European, Nordic and Old European blocs, hindering Monaco's chances of qualification. With regards to the non-qualification of the Monégasque entry in 2006, \"La Coco-Dance\", he claimed that the audience voted more for the show than the song. Furthermore, TMC is now part of the TF1 Group, the leading private broadcaster in France, and is now available everywhere in France. TMC programs no longer revolve around the principality. As TF1 Group being the biggest competitor to the French public channels, it is very unlikely that TMC will again broadcast the contest. When TMC did so between 2004 and 2006, its audience was much smaller than the one of the French public channel. In those years, it was the government and the municipality of Monaco who chose the contestant and funded the delegation, while it is usually the responsibility of a broadcaster or a producer.\n\nDue to the country's very small size, all Monaco's entrants came from outside the principality, although French-born Minouche Barelli, who represented the principality in 1967, shared her time between Paris and Monaco, acquired Monegasque citizenship in 2002, and died in the principality on 20 February 2004 at the age of 56.. The large majority of the participant were French, with also one Yugoslavian, Tereza Kesovija, and one Italian, Mary Christy (born Marie Ruggeri). Several singers selected to represent Monaco are key figures of the French scene, such as Françoise Hardy and Michèle Torr. Luxembourg, another small country, also sent a great number of French artists to the contest. At the 1967 contest, the Monegasque entry, \"Boum Badaboum\", sung by Minouche Barelli, was written by Serge Gainsbourg. He had already composed the winning entry in 1965, \"Poupée de cire, poupée de son\", sung by France Gall for Luxembourg. Jean Jacques, who represented Monaco in 1969, was the first child to take part in Eurovision. He was 12.\n\nFrom 1959 to 1970, Monaco did not have its own commentators in the festival, Télé Monte Carlo used French commentary instead (RTF 1959–1964 and ORTF 1965–1970). From 1971 until 1979, and between 2004 and 2006, TMC did broadcast the contest with its own commentators, but they were French. As TMC had been available in the South-East of France since the 1980s and by digital terrestrial television throughout the country since 2005, French audience was able to watch the Eurovision Song Contest on both France 3 and TMC in 2004, 2005 and 2006 (the semi-final of 2004 only on TMC though).\n"}

{"id": "1930089", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1930089", "title": "Thermotropism", "text": "Thermotropism\n\nThermotropism or thermotropic movement is the movement of a plant or part of a plant in response to a change in temperature. A common example is the curling of \"Rhododendron\" leaves in response to cold temperatures. \"Mimosa pudica\" also show thermotropism by the collapsing of leaf petioles leading to the folding of leaflets, when temperature drops.\n\nThe term \"thermotropism\" was originated by French botanist Philippe Van Tieghem in his 1884 textbook \"Traité de botanique\". Van Tieghem stated that a plant irradiated with an optimum growth temperature on one side laterally, and a much higher or lower temperature on the opposite side, would exhibit faster growth on the side exposed to optimum temperature.\n\nThe precise physiological mechanism enabling plant thermotropism is not yet understood. It has been noted that one of the earliest physiological responses by plants to cooling is an influx of calcium ions from the cell walls into the cytosol, which increases calcium ion concentration in the intracellular space. This calcium influx is dependent upon mechanical changes in the actin cytoskeleton that alter the fluidity of the cell membrane, which allows calcium ion channels to open. From this information, a hypothesis has formed that the plant cell plasma membrane is an important site of plant temperature perception.\n\nGardening hobbyists have frequently noted the dramatic change in the shape of Rhododendron or \"Rhodie\" leaves during warm versus cold weather. In warm weather, the leaf has a flat oblong shape. As the temperature of the leaf drops, the blade curls inward, giving the leaf a tubular, cigar-like shape.\n\nResearch on Rhododendron leaf thermotropism suggests that the curling response might help prevent damage to cell membranes caused by rapid thawing after a freeze. During the winter months, wild Rhododendrons in the Appalachian Mountains regularly drop to freezing temperatures at night, then thaw again in the early morning. Because a curled leaf has less of its surface area exposed to the sunlight, the leaf will thaw more slowly than it would if it were unfurled. Slower thawing minimizes damage caused to leaf cell membranes by ice crystal formation.\n\nThe roots of some plants, including \"Zea mays\", have been shown to bend differently when exposed to different temperature conditions. In general, growing roots tend to bend away from warmer temperatures, and towards cooler temperatures, within a normal range. It has been suggested that this growth behavior is beneficial because in most natural environments, soil closer to the ground's surface is warmer in temperature, while deeper soil is cooler.\n\nYoung corn roots have been shown to grow upwards, against the normal gravitropic orientation, in order to bend towards an artificially created cooler temperature zone at the surface of the growth medium. This overriding behavior suggests integration between the plants' gravitropic and thermotropic systems. \n\n"}

The series have varied in length, consisting of between one and seven Test matches, but since 1998 have been consistently five matches. It is one of sport's most celebrated rivalries and dates back to 1882. It is generally played biennially, alternating between the United Kingdom and Australia. Australia are the current holders of the Ashes, having been the incumbent holders, after drawing the 2019 series 2–2.\n\nAlthough the first Test series played between England and Australia was in the 1876–77 season, the Ashes originated from the solitary Test which the two nations contested in 1882. England lost the match, played at The Oval, and a mock obituary was posted in \"The Sporting Times\", declaring the death of English cricket. It stated that: \"The body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia.\" The Honourable Ivo Bligh adopted the term and, as captain of the English party that travelled to Australia the following winter, promised to bring the \"Ashes\" home.\n\nAfter its loss to Australia in 1882, England won the next eight series between the two sides, during which time it lost only four of the 22 Tests. Australia won an Ashes series for the first time in 1891–92, when it beat England 2–1. The 1932–33 tour was known as the \"Bodyline series\" as, in response to the talented Australian batsman Don Bradman, England developed a tactic of bowling quickly at the body of the batsmen with most of the fielders placed in a close ring on the leg side. England won the series, but the tactic prompted changes to the laws of cricket, and the Australians, buoyed by the batting of Bradman, regained the Ashes during the next series and then held them for six series, spanning nineteen years. It was during this period that the Australians travelled to England in 1948, and remained unbeaten during the whole tour, gaining the nickname of \"The Invincibles\". In addition to winning the five match Test series 4–0, Australia won or drew all of its 29 other matches against county and representative sides.\n\nAustralia has won more Ashes Tests than England, winning 136 of the 335 matches, compared to England's 108 victories. Australia also holds the edge in Ashes series won, having won on 33 occasions compared to England's 32. There have been six drawn series, and on five of these occasions, Australia has retained the Ashes due to being holders going into the series. England has retained the Ashes after a drawn series once. On only three occasions has a team won all the Tests in an Ashes series; Australia has achieved the feat 5–0 in 1920–21, 2006–07 and 2013–14. England's largest winning margin in an Ashes series was in 1978–79, when it won 5–1. England's largest unbeaten winning margin of 3–0 in an Ashes series was achieved in 1886, 1977 and 2013. Both England and Australia have held the Ashes for a record eight consecutive series, England doing so between 1882–83 and 1890, while Australia achieved the feat from 1989 to 2002–03. Since 1882, a small number of Test series have been played between the two sides that have not been allocated as Ashes series; those played in 1976–77, 1979–80, 1980 and 1987–88.\n\n\n"}

This term is used in condensed matter physics to describe the entropy at zero kelvin of a glass or plastic crystal referred to the crystal state, whose entropy is zero according to the third law of thermodynamics. It occurs if a material can exist in many different states when cooled. The most common non-equilibrium state is vitreous state, glass.\n\nA common example is the case of carbon monoxide, which has a very small dipole moment. As the carbon monoxide crystal is cooled to absolute zero, few of the carbon monoxide molecules have enough time to align themselves into a perfect crystal, (with all of the carbon monoxide molecules oriented in the same direction). Because of this, the crystal is locked into a state with formula_1 different corresponding microstates, giving a residual entropy of formula_2, rather than zero.\n\nAnother example is any amorphous solid (glass). These have residual entropy, because the atom-by-atom microscopic structure can be arranged in a huge number of different ways across a macroscopic system.\n\nOne of the first examples of residual entropy was pointed out by Pauling to describe water ice. In water, each oxygen atom is bonded to two hydrogen atoms. However, when water freezes it forms a tetragonal structure where each oxygen atom has four hydrogen neighbors (due to neighboring water molecules). The hydrogen atoms sitting between the oxygen atoms have some degree of freedom as long as each oxygen atom has two hydrogen atoms that are 'nearby', thus forming the traditional HO water molecule. However, it turns out that for a large number of water molecules in this configuration, the hydrogen atoms have a large number of possible configurations that meet the 2-in 2-out rule (each oxygen atom must have two 'near' (or 'in') hydrogen atoms, and two far (or 'out') hydrogen atoms). This freedom exists down to absolute zero, which was previously seen as an absolute one-of-a-kind configuration. The existence of these multiple configurations (choices for each H of orientation along O--O axis) that meet the rules of absolute zero (2-in 2-out for each O) amounts to randomness, or in other words, entropy. Thus systems that can take multiple configurations at or near absolute zero are said to have residual entropy.\n\nAlthough water ice was the first material for which residual entropy was proposed, it is generally very difficult to prepare pure defect-free crystals of water ice for studying. A great deal of research has thus been undertaken into finding other systems that exhibit residual entropy. Geometrically frustrated systems in particular often exhibit residual entropy. An important example is spin ice, which is a geometrically frustrated magnetic material where the magnetic moments of the magnetic atoms have Ising-like magnetic spins and lie on the corners of network of corner-sharing tetrahedra. This material is thus analogous to water ice, with the exception that the spins on the corners of the tetrahedra can point into or out of the tetrahedra, thereby producing the same 2-in, 2-out rule as in water ice, and therefore the same residual entropy. One of the interesting properties of geometrically frustrated magnetic materials such as spin ice is that the level of residual entropy can be controlled by the application of an external magnetic field. This property can be used to create one-shot refrigeration systems.\n\n"}

{"id": "1930147", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1930147", "title": "Swords Castle", "text": "Swords Castle\n\nSwords Castle is a historic castle located in Swords, Dublin.\n\nThe castle was built as the manorial residence of the first Anglo-Norman Archbishop of Dublin, John Comyn, around 1200 or a little later in Swords, just north of Dublin. The castle was never strong in the military sense, but is unusual in that the perimeter wall of 305 metres is far larger than normal for an Irish castle. The walls enclose a large pentagonal walled area of nearly 6,000 m² (1.5 acres) with a tower on the north, probably the Constable's residence, and an impressive gateway complex on the south. Within the castle were the Archbishop's apartments, apartments for knights and a banqueting hall. The warder may have occupied the quarters to the left of the gate, while to the right was the janitor's room with the priest's room overhead. The adjoining chapel, built in the late 13th century, was probably used as the Archbishop's private oratory. Other buildings, recorded for an inquisition in 1326, have now vanished, including the great hall on the east side of the enclosure.\n\nA monastic settlement attributed to St. Columba (or Colmcille) existed in Swords from the 6th century, which in the 17th century was brought under the control of the Archbishop of Dublin. In 1181 John Comyn succeeded Laurence O'Toole as Archbishop and it appears that he chose Swords at some point as his chief residence, probably because the prebend of Swords was of considerable wealth and was much sought after. The evidence is that he had a manor in Swords by 1192, as a patent was granted to him there on that date authorising him to hold an annual fair lasting a week on the feast day (June 9) of St. Columba. It is generally accepted that the castle was then built around 1200 or a little later as the manorial residence of the Archbishop. The archbishop had his own seneschal at Swords and an ecclesiastical court was also held there. In 1216 the manor of Swords was granted to Henry de Loundres, the second English Archbishop, and it is recorded that in 1220 one William Galrote held the position of chief constable of the castle.\nIt appears that the castle was occupied for the next hundred years by successive Archbishops of Dublin until Archbishop Alexander de Bicknor, who built a new Archiepiscopal palace at Tallaght in 1324. It appears by this stage that Swords Castle had been abandoned. The evidence for this is that in 1326 de Bicknor was accused of mishandling the treasury and the profits of his See were seized by the king and an inquisition held before the Sheriff of Dublin on 14 March 1326. The purpose of the inquisition was to ascertain the profits of the See, and as part of this a detailed description of Swords Castle was recorded. It is clear from this description that the castle had fallen into disrepair. In all likelihood Swords was abandoned because of damage sustained during the Bruce campaign in Ireland of 1317, which was known to have devastated the country south from Dundalk to the gates of Dublin. Although there is no direct evidence that Swords Castle had been attacked by Bruce's forces, it was not well fortified enough to withstand assault, and the probability is that the Archbishop had removed himself to Tallaght for safety reasons. \nIt is doubtful if all the buildings of the castle were ever repaired, but the stepped battlements suggest some form of occupancy during the 15th century, when it appears the castle was granted to retired Archbishops. There is no documentary evidence to show that any of them resided there however. Instead it seems that a portion at least of the castle was occupied by a constable during the 14th, 15th and early 16th centuries. As late as 1547 Thomas Fitzsimons of Swords was appointed constable, and subsequently the Barnewall family retained an interest in the constableship and tenancy of the castle. But by 1583, when briefly occupied by Dutch Protestants, it was described as \"the quite spoiled old castle\". The viceroy, Sir Henry Sydney, had some of the building repaired for the use of the colony of Dutch weavers who he hoped might 'show some example of industry to the lazy natives'.\nDuring the 1641 Rebellion the castle was chosen as the rendezvous for the Anglo-Irish Catholic families of The Pale On 9 December of that year they assembled under arms at the castle in order to join the rebellion, but were attacked by Sir Charles Coote under orders of the Lords Justices. Coote put them to flight, chasing them out of their fortifications and killing two hundred of them. It is possible that some burials found during modern excavations of the castle relate to this incident.\n\nNot much is known about the castle after that, but an Ordnance Survey map of 1837 shows the grounds or Bawn of the castle had been converted into a garden. After the Church of Ireland was disestablished in 1870 the castle was sold to the Cobbe family, who leased it to local shopkeeper Robert Savage. Savage turned the grounds of the castle into an orchard and sold the produce in his shop. In the 1930s the site was placed under the guardianship of the Office of Public Works, and in 1985 Dublin County Council (later Fingal County Council) purchased the castle with a view to its restoration. \n\nThe Parks Department of Fingal County Council carried out a number of studies, including a conservation study of the entire area, and in 1995 a plan was agreed by the council for the long term phased restoration of the castle. In 1996 work commenced on the restoration of Constable's Tower, and this was completed in 1998. The restoration of the rest of the castle is still ongoing and when complete, Swords Castle is intended to become a tourist attraction. The newly renovated castle was used as a film location for the production of TV series \"The Tudors\" in spring 2010. In 2019, the chapel opened its doors to weddings. Swords Castle and Courtyard is open to the public from Tuesday to Sunday.\n\n\n"}

She ran away from her small town in Minnesota and proceeded to appear in over 30 pornographic films, earning up to $100,000 in her two-year career. Grant killed herself after the arrest of her partner in March, 1984. She was inducted into the XRCO Hall of Fame in 1999. She was sometimes credited as Callie Aimes, Callie Aims, or Colleen Applegate.\n\nBorn in Bellflower, California, Colleen Applegate grew up in the small town of Farmington, Minnesota. Her family moved there in 1973, when her father took a managerial position with Central Telephone Company of Minnesota. Applegate was a cheerleader in high school and graduated from Farmington High in 1981. She stayed in the small town, working first as a cashier and then as a repair clerk with the phone company.\n\nOne night in December of that same year, she consumed a handful of prescription sinus pills in an attempt at suicide. Her father, Phillip Applegate, said that he never discussed the suicide attempt with his daughter; he and his wife at the time (Colleen's mother, Karen Lee Applegate) believed their daughter was merely seeking attention. According to the \"Frontline\" documentary, the entire family had at least one group session at a counseling center during which no one really talked about the situation.\n\nIn March 1982, when the news spread about her overdose, Applegate ran away from home with her boyfriend, Mike Marcell, and moved to California. Applegate left behind her parents, a brother, and three sisters. After her death, her parents divorced.\n\nAfter arriving in Los Angeles, Applegate and Marcell unsuccessfully pursued several employment leads in the first month. Then Marcell saw an ad for the World Modeling Agency in Van Nuys, which diligently sought attractive new recruits for \"figure modeling\". Accompanied by Marcell, Applegate visited the agency's owner, Jim South, who set up a photo session with legendary soft-core photographer J. Stephen Hicks, whose work was frequently featured in \"Penthouse\".\n\nHer first pictorial's theme featured a mock camping set and was to be published by \"Club\". Hicks reflected on Applegate's appearance and personality, saying: \"I deal with a lot of girls who are new in the business, a lot of young girls and a lot of girls from out of town. Colleen was so incredibly young and naive. She was completely un-hip and non-L.A.\"\n\nHer wholesome, \"girl next door\" looks soon landed her work posing for other magazines such as \"Chic\", \"Hustler\", \"Swank\", and \"Penthouse.\" But Hicks advised Applegate to get out of nude modeling quickly, because when all of the magazines had used her, the only thing left for her would be hardcore movies. \"You know, you take a typical girl that's used to working at McDonald's or at a shoe store, where she's used to making a minimum wage, and suddenly she's given the opportunity to get made up, and be in front of people who tell her she's beautiful, and make as much money in a day as she was making in three weeks and, um, they change. They change. And that's sad.\"\n\nAlmost immediately, Applegate progressed to filming hardcore photo sessions for Suze Randall.\n\nApplegate's relationship with her boyfriend did not endure their first two months in California; Marcell left her to return to Minnesota and ultimately joined the U.S. Army. Before his induction, he informed some residents of her small town that Applegate was involved with pornography, which caused her family much embarrassment. In the \"Frontline\" documentary, Marcell refused to speak to the show's reporter about his relationship with Applegate, except to say that he no longer cared about her.\n\nIgnoring Hicks's advice, Applegate continued working with World Modeling Agency, where she met veteran porn producer Bobby Hollander. Hollander launched her adult film career, suggesting what he felt was a \"classy\" stage name, Shauna Grant.\n\nAs a fast-rising adult entertainment personality, she was featured in \"Virginia\", \"Suzie Superstar\", and \"Flesh and Laces 1 & 2\", among many other films. Her pay rose from $300 a day to nearly $1,500. As Shauna Grant, she made dozens of popular adult movies, usually plot-oriented. In \"Suzie Superstar\", she played the lead singer of a rock band.\n\nOff-screen she traveled in limousines and stayed in first class hotels.\n\nGrant was provided with her own make-up artist, 27-year-old Laurie Smith (who was also an adult star). Smith, who co-starred with Grant in several movies (including \"Suzie Superstar\", \"The Young Like It Hot\", and \"Bad Girls IV\"), also became Grant's best friend and fellow cocaine user during that period. She quit the adult film business for a short time following Grant's suicide.\n\nGrant's popularity earned her three acting nominations at the March 1984 Erotic Film Awards. However, despite these accolades and her beauty, Grant had some difficulty getting work due to her cocaine addiction and lack of \"enthusiasm\" during sex scenes. In some circles she acquired the nickname \"Applecoke\" and gained a reputation for being flaky.\n\nBy industry standards, Grant was early in her career when it suddenly came to an end.\n\nIn 1983, Grant retired from the adult film industry after less than a year and just over 30 films and videos, in which she had sex on screen with 37 men, and after contracting herpes and having an abortion. She disliked the industry, although she regarded Joey Silvera well.\n\nOn March 14, 1984, she was a multiple nominee and presenter (with John Leslie) at the 8th Annual Adult Film Association Awards show at the Coconut Grove Ambassador Hotel. While her desire to act in mainstream films had generated no offers, she was so prestigious at the time that famed director Francis Ford Coppola was seated at her table.\n\nThat night she agreed to work on her first adult film in 10 months. \"Matinee Idol\" was due to begin filming in eight days in San Francisco, California. A few days after the awards show, her Minnesota boyfriend flew to Los Angeles to see her but Grant forgot about his arrival. Grant and Smith had partied and slept in the days following the awards show and lost track of time. At the same time Jake Ehrlich, another boyfriend and cocaine dealer of Grant, telephoned from prison saying that their relationship was over and that Grant needed to move out of his Palm Springs home.\n\nGrant persuaded her friend, veteran porn performer Kelly Nichols, to take the role intended for Grant. Grant also had the option of returning to Minnesota. Her parents offered to pay for her college expenses, but she believed she would no longer be comfortable at home in Minnesota.\n\nOn March 21, 1984, Grant committed suicide in Palm Springs by shooting herself with a .22. Shortly after 7 p.m. she lay down, placed the gun horizontally against her head, and pulled the trigger. The shot passed through her right temple, out the left, and into the bedroom wall, according to police reports. Grant was rushed to Desert Hospital, where, on March 23, her life support system was eventually disconnected.\n\nGrant's funeral was held on March 28, 1984, at St. Michael's Church, a Catholic parish near the center of Farmington, Minnesota. Members of the adult film industry did not attend the ceremony, believing their presence would only exacerbate the family's anguish. Instead, they contributed flowers and letters. Grant was buried in her favorite color, pink.\n\nShe was buried at the Saint Michaels Catholic Cemetery, Farmington.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1930156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1930156", "title": "Henry Plummer", "text": "Henry Plummer\n\nHenry Plummer (1832–1864) was a prospector, lawman, and outlaw in the American West in the 1850s and 1860s, who was known to have killed several men, some in what was considered self-defense. He was elected sheriff of Bannack, Montana from 1863 to 1864, during which period he was accused of being the leader of a \"road agent\" gang of outlaws known as the \"Innocents,\" which preyed on shipments from Virginia City to other areas. In response some leaders in Virginia City formed the Vigilance Committee of Alder Gulch, and began to take action against Plummer's gang, gaining confessions from a couple of men they arrested in early January 1864. On January 10, 1864 Plummer and two associates were arrested in Bannack by a company of the Vigilantes and summarily hanged.\n\nPlummer was given a posthumous trial in 1993 which led to a mistrial. The jury was split 6–6.\n\nPlummer was born William Henry Handy Plumer in 1832 in Addison, Maine, the last of six children in a family whose ancestors had first settled in Maine in 1634, when it was still a part of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. He changed the spelling of his surname to Plummer after moving West. His father died while Henry was in his teens.\n\nIn 1852, at age 19, Plummer headed west to the gold fields of California. His mining venture went well: within two years he owned a mine, a ranch, and a bakery in Nevada City. In 1856, Plummer was elected sheriff and city manager. Supporters suggested that he should run for state representative as a Democrat. However, the party was divided, and without its full support, he lost.\n\nOn September 26, 1857, Plummer shot and killed John Vedder. As city marshal of Nevada City, California, Plummer had been providing protection of Lucy Vedder, John's wife, who was seeking to escape from her abusive husband. Plummer claimed he was acting in self-defense in the incident, but was convicted of second-degree murder. He won an appeal for a retrial and was convicted again and sentenced to ten years in San Quentin. But in August 1859, supporters of his wrote to the governor seeking a pardon based on his alleged good character and civic performance. The governor granted the pardon due to Plummer's poor health as a result of tuberculosis, then incurable.\n\nIn 1861, Plummer tried to carry out a citizen's arrest of William Riley, who had escaped from San Quentin; in the attempt, Riley was killed. Plummer turned himself in to the police, who accepted that the killing was justified. Fearing that his prison record would prevent a fair trial, they allowed Plummer to leave the state.\n\nPlummer headed to Washington Territory where gold had been discovered. There he became involved in a dispute that ended in a gunfight won by Plummer. He decided to leave the West and return to Maine.\n\nOn the way back east, waiting for a steamboat to reach Fort Benton, Montana on the Missouri River, Plummer was approached by James Vail. He was recruiting volunteers to help protect his family from Indian attacks at the mission station he was attempting to found in Sun River, Montana. No passage home being available, Plummer accepted, along with Jack Cleveland, a horse dealer who had known Plummer in California. While at the mission, both Plummer and Cleveland fell in love with Vail's attractive sister-in-law, Electa Bryan; Plummer asked her to marry him and she agreed. As gold had recently been discovered in nearby Bannack, Montana, Plummer decided to go there to try to earn enough money to support them both. Cleveland followed him.\nIn January 1863, Cleveland, nursing his jealousy, forced Plummer into a fight and was killed. The altercation took place in a crowded saloon, and observers agreed that Plummer had killed his foe in self-defense. Plummer was viewed very favorably by most town residents and, in May, he was elected sheriff of Bannack.\n\nBetween October and December 1863, the rate of robberies and murders in and around Alder Gulch increased significantly, and the citizens of Virginia City grew increasingly suspicious of Plummer and his associates.\n\nNotable criminal acts by alleged members of the Plummer gang included:\n\nAt the time Bannack and Virginia City, Montana were part of a remote region of the Idaho Territory; there was no formal law enforcement or justice system for the area. Some residents suspected that Plummer's road agent gang was responsible for numerous robberies, attempted robberies, murders and attempted murders in and around Alder Gulch in October–December 1863.\n\nFrom December 19 to 21, 1863, a public trial was held in Virginia City by a miners' court for George Ives, the suspected murderer of Nicholas Tiebolt, a young Dutch immigrant. Hundreds of miners from around the area attended the three-day outdoor trial. George Ives was prosecuted by Wilbur F. Sanders, convicted, and hanged on December 21, 1863.\n\nOn December 23, 1863, two days after the Ives trial, leading citizens of Virginia City and Bannack formed the Vigilance Committee of Alder Gulch in Virginia City. They included five Virginia City residents, led by Wilbur F. Sanders, and including Major Alvin W. Brockie, John Nye, Captain Nick D. Wall, and Paris Pfouts. Between January 4 and February 3, 1864, the vigilantes arrested and summarily executed at least 20 alleged members of Plummer's gang.\n\nShortly after its formation, the Vigilance Committee dispatched a posse of men to search for Aleck Carter, \"Whiskey Bill\" Graves, and Bill Bunton, known associates of George Ives. The posse was led by vigilante Captain James Williams, the man who had investigated the Nicolas Tiebolt murder. Near the Rattlesnake Ranch on the Ruby River, the posse located Erastus \"Red\" Yeager and George Brown, both suspected road agents. While traveling under guard back to Virginia City, Yeager made a complete confession, naming the majority of the road agents in Plummer's gang, and Henry Plummer. The posse found Yeager and Brown to be guilty and hanged them from a cottonwood tree on the Lorrain's Ranch on the Ruby River.\n\nOn January 6, 1864, vigilante Captain Nick Wall and Ben Peabody captured \"Dutch John\" Wagner, a road agent wounded in the Moody robbery, on the Salt Lake City trail. The vigilantes transported Wagner to Bannack, where he was hanged on January 11, 1864. By this time, Yeager's confession had mobilized vigilantes against Plummer and his key associates, deputies Buck Stinson and Ned Ray. Plummer, Stinson, and Ray were arrested on the morning of January 10, 1864, and summarily hanged.\n\nThe two youngest members of the gang were said to be spared. One was sent back to Bannack to tell the rest to get out of the area, and the other was sent ahead to Lewiston, Idaho to warn gang members to leave that town. (Lewiston was the connection from the Territory to the world, as it had river steamboats that traveled to the coast at Astoria, Oregon via the Snake and Columbia rivers.) Plummer was known to have traveled to Lewiston during the time when he was an elected official in Bannack. The hotel registry records with his signature during this period have been preserved. The large-scale robberies of gold shipments by gangs ended with Plummer's and the alleged gang members' deaths. Gang member Clubfoot George was hanged at about the same time with Plummer.\n\nPlummer was given a posthumous trial in 1993 which led to a mistrial. The jury was split 6–6.\n\n\n"}

He is the paternal 3rd great-grandfather of Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester, and the maternal 4th great-grandfather of Prince William of Gloucester and Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester.\n\nMuch of the family's lands and wealth were accumulated during Henry's tenure as Duke. He integrated the surnames \"Montagu\" and \"Douglas\" with the Scott family name to form the unhyphenated compound surname \"Montagu Douglas Scott\".\n\nHenry Scott was the fourth child of five born to Francis Scott, Earl of Dalkeith (son of Francis Scott, 2nd Duke of Buccleuch) and his wife, Caroline Campbell, and the third-born and only surviving male heir. He was baptised on 29 September 1746 at St. George's Church, St George Street, Hanover Square, London, England. His father, Francis Scott died of smallpox at the age of 29, just one year before the death of Henry's grandfather, the 2nd Duke of Buccleuch. It was young Henry who succeeded his grandfather as Duke of Buccleuch on 22 April 1751, at the age of just four.\n\nEducated at Eton College, through his stepfather Charles Townshend, Henry was given the opportunity to travel abroad with Adam Smith as his tutor from 1764 to 1766. The Duke remained lifelong friends with Smith and is credited with bringing him out of his shell.\n\nOn 2 May 1767, he married Lady Elizabeth Montagu, the eldest daughter of Lady Mary Montagu and George (Brudenell) Montagu, 1st Duke of Montagu. The couple were married in Montagu House, Whitehall, London. Elizabeth's maternal and paternal grandparents were, respectively, Sir John Montagu, 2nd Duke of Montagu and Lady Mary Churchill, and George Brudenell, 3rd Earl of Cardigan and Lady Elizabeth Bruce. Two of her maternal great-grandparents were John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough and Lady Sarah Jenyns (later Churchill).\n\nHenry and Elizabeth had seven children together:\n\n\nWhen Sir John Montagu, 2nd Duke of Montagu died on 5 July 1749, his estate had been entailed to his daughter, Lady Mary Montagu, who was married to Sir George Brudenell, the 4th Earl of Cardigan. The Montagu peerages, like most English peerages, were limited to heirs male, and became extinct with the 2nd Duke. However, within ten days after Montagu's death, Cardigan adopted the Montagu name and coat of arms for both himself and his two children, in order that the Montagu name should continue. Seventeen years later, in 1766, King George III created him \"Duke of Montagu and Marquess of Monthermer\".\n\nThe first Duke of the 1766 creation died 23 May 1790—also survived only by a daughter, Elizabeth, now Duchess of Buccleuch. Once again the Montagu peerages became extinct. Elizabeth inherited only the unentailed Montagu assets, which included Boughton House in Weekley, Northamptonshire. Like his father-in-law, Buccleuch wished to perpetuate the Montagu name, and adopted the unhyphenated surname Montagu Scott.\n\nWilliam Douglas, 4th Duke of Queensberry never married; when he died on 23 December 1810, his peerages and entailments passed to his 2nd cousin once removed, Sir Henry Montagu Scott, 3rd Duke of Buccleuch, through Sir Henry's grandmother, Lady Jane Douglas, Queensberry's first cousin once removed. Buccleuch then added the surname to his own, forming the unhyphenated surname Montagu Douglas Scott which the family bears to this day.\n\nBuccleuch was Governor of the Royal Bank of Scotland from 1777 to 1812. He was joint founder of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and its first President, serving from 1783 until death 1812. He was Lord-Lieutenant of Haddington from 1794 to 1812, and Lord-Lieutenant of Midlothian from 1794 to 1812. In 1778, he raised successfully a regiment of Fencibles. He was appointed a deputy lieutenant of Northamptonshire on 9 May 1803.\n\nBuccleuch died at Dalkeith Palace, Midlothian, Scotland, on 11 January 1812, aged 65. He was buried in the family crypt of the Buccleuch Memorial Chapel in St. Mary's Episcopal Church, Dalkeith, Midlothian. The church is located on High Street in Dalkeith, at the entrance to Dalkeith Country Park.\n\n"}

The title is anglicized in various ways, including \"Völundarkvitha\", \"Völundarkvidha\", \"Völundarkvida\", \"Volundarkvitha\", \"Volundarkvidha\" and \"Volundarkvida\".\n\nThe poem is preserved in its entirety among the mythological poems of the thirteenth-century Icelandic manuscript Codex Regius, and the beginning of the prose prologue is also found in the AM 748 I 4to fragment.\n\nThe vocabulary and some of the formulaic phrasing of the poem is clearly influenced by West Germanic, with the strongest case being for influence specifically from Old English (a West Germanic dialect). It is thought likely, therefore, that \"Vǫlundarkviða\" was composed in, or otherwise influenced by traditions from, the Norse diaspora in England. This would suggest origins around the tenth or eleventh century. This fits in turn with the fact that most of the analogues to \"Vǫlundarkviða\" are West-Germanic in origin.\n\nIn visual sources, the story told in \"Vǫlundarkviða\" seems also to be portrayed on the front panel of the eighth-century Northumbrian Franks Casket and on the eighth-century Gotlandic Ardre image stone VIII, along with a number of tenth-to-eleventh-century carvings from Northern England, including the Leeds Cross Shaft, a fragment in Leeds City Museum, and Sherburn-in-Elmet fragments 2 and 3.\n\nIn written sources, a largely similar story (\"Velents þáttr smiðs\") is related in the Old Norse \"Þiðrekssaga af Bern\" (translated from lost Low German sources), and an evidently similar story is alluded to in the first two verse-paragraphs of Old English poem \"Deor\".\nThe poem relates the story of the artisan Völundr, his capture by Níðuðr, implicitly a petty-king of Närke (currently in Sweden), and Vǫlundr's brutal revenge and escape.\n\n\"Vǫlundarkviða\" begins with a prose introduction, setting the scene, giving background about the characters, and partly summarising the poem. It is possible that this passage is much younger than the verse.\n\nThe poem opens by describing the flight of three swan-maidens identified in stanza 1 as \"meyjar\", \"drósir\", \"alvitr\" and \"suðrœnar\" ('young women, stately women, foreign beings, southerners') to a 'sævar strǫnd' ('lake/sea-shore') where they meet the three brothers Egill, Slagfiðr and Vǫlundr. Each maid takes one of the brothers as her own.\n\nHowever, nine winters later, the women leave the brothers. The poem does not explain this, simply saying that the women depart 'ørlǫg drýgja' ('to fulfil their fate'). Slagfiðr and Egill go in search of their women, but Vǫlundr remains at home instead, forging \"baugar\" (‘(arm-)rings’) for his woman.\n\nDiscovering that Vǫlundr is living alone, a local king, Níðuðr, ‘lord of the Njárar’, has him captured in his sleep\n(stanzas 7–12).\n\nNíðuðr takes Vǫlundr's sword and gives one of the rings which Vǫlundr made for his missing bride to his daughter Bǫðvildr, and, at his wife's instigation, he has Vǫlundr's hamstrings cut, imprisoning him on an island called Sævarstaðr, where Vǫlundr makes objects for Níðuðr (stanzas 13–19).\n\nVǫlundr takes his revenge on Níðuðr first by enticing Níðuðr's two sons to visit with promises of treasure, killing them, and making jewels of their eyes and teeth (stanzas 20–26). He then entices Bǫðvildr by promising to mend the ring which she was given, getting her drunk, and implicitly having sex with her (stanzas 27–29).\n\nThe poem culminates in Vǫlundr taking to the air by some means which is not clearly described and telling Níðuðr what he has done, laughing (stanzas 30–39). It focuses finally on the plight of Bǫðvildr, whose lament closes the poem (stanzas 40–41):\n\nThe poem is appreciated for its evocative images.\n\n\"Völundarkviða\" 6, Thorpe's translation\n\n\n\n"}

As of September 9, 2016, only the Sturgis, Michigan location remains in operation. The majority of the chain's locations focused entirely on drive-thru service, featuring a small-footprint building with a tall, slanted roof style. Some previous locations were more traditional fast-food locations, complete with seating, and others were combined with gas stations.\n\nHot 'n Now was founded in Kalamazoo, Michigan in 1984 by William Van Domelen. Van Domelen had opened the first Michigan Wendy's restaurants and a franchisee of Burger Chef in Southwest Michigan.\n\nBy 1990, the chain operated more than 100 stores in 15 different states. That same year, it was acquired by PepsiCo, which placed operations under its Taco Bell unit.

Lee, former Black Sabbath members Ray Gillen (vocals), Eric Singer (drums), as well as former Surgical Steel bass player Greg Chaisson.. After the first Badlands album, Eric Singer was replaced by Jeff Martin. The group lasted from 1988 to 1993 and released three albums. \"Badlands\" (1989) and \"Voodoo Highway\" (1991) were released before Gillen left and was replaced by singer John West from New York. Gillen's death in 1993 effectively ended any hopes of re-uniting the project. The album \"Dusk\" (a demo recorded in 1992-93) was released in 1998 with the then deceased Gillen on vocals.\n\nAfter touring with Ozzy Osbourne in support of the \"Ultimate Sin\" album, Jake E. Lee was fired by Sharon Osbourne. Lee first learned of his dismissal from the band through his roommate and guitar tech. Ultimately, Lee's firing was confirmed when he called Sharon Osbourne and asked her about it directly. Lee set about looking for a charismatic front man with whom to launch a new band. He met Ray Gillen, a vocalist who had recently worked briefly with Black Sabbath. Within weeks, the duo had enlisted bassist Greg Chaisson, whom Lee had met during an Ozzy audition. Gillen recruited his former Black Sabbath bandmate Eric Singer to be the band's drummer. With melodic sensibilities and solid instrumental skill, the new band worked together to present energetic live shows.\n\nThe band released \"Badlands\" in June 1989 to good reviews. The band released videos for the songs \"Dreams in the Dark\" and the Zeppelin-like \"Winter’s Call,\" both of which received airplay on MTV. This boosted the album to its peak of no. 57 on Billboard's album charts.\n\nEric Singer soon quit Badlands; he later joined Paul Stanley's solo club band and played with KISS following the death of drummer Eric Carr. Badlands picked up Jeff Martin, former vocalist for Racer X and Chaisson's bandmate in Phoenix-based bands Surgical Steel and St. Michael, to take over on drums. Disagreements arose between the band and Atlantic Records about musical direction, and also between Gillen and his bandmates about the inclusion on the planned album of songs he had written. Lee has recalled that, shortly after the first album's tour in 1990, Gillen was first diagnosed with AIDS, and was starting to get \"really thin and didn't look quite as healthy.\" After the band released \"Voodoo Highway\" in 1991, Gillen left the band as friction increased during the UK tour in 1992. Lee at the time announced he had hired Los Angeles native Debby Holiday, from the band Stiletto, to replace Gillen on their UK tour; however, before this occurred, the band quickly drafted Gillen back to complete the tour before he officially left the band.\n\nAfter Gillen left the band and announced Holiday as his replacement, Lee was interviewed about her by \"Kerrang!\" magazine. A black woman, Holiday was the daughter of songwriter Jimmy Holiday (best known for penning the Dolly Parton hit \"Put a Little Love in Your Heart\"). She was raised in Beverly Hills, and had performed in many of the Sunset Strip's major clubs. Few of Badlands' fans were familiar with her prior musical activities. The interview with Lee was published in issue No. 399; he talked only briefly about Gillen's replacement and described his erratic behavior.\n\nOn July 2, the band played at the London Astoria. Just a few songs in, Gillen pulled out a copy of the \"Kerrang!\" magazine that had been released with Lee's story in it and shouted to the crowd \"there's two sides to every story\" while Lee mouthed \"It's all true.\" Still, the band played the rest of its set. In \"Kerrang!\" issue No. 400, Neil Jeffries reviewed the gig and claimed that he had never seen a band with so much tension play so superbly. He praised Lee's guitar work and claimed the band were absolutely superb despite their obvious feuds.\n\nAfter the UK tour was complete, Gillen was officially fired from the band. Lee insisted to the press that the band would continue with singer John West. The band wrote and recorded some new songs; however, the combination of band discord and the general decline in the popularity of heavy metal music ultimately led Atlantic Records to drop the band from its label. Gillen then appeared with George Lynch’s solo band on the album \"Sacred Groove\". Following that, he formed Sun Red Sun with guitarist Al Romano, former Alice in Chains bassist Mike Starr, and drummer Bobby Rondinelli. However, just as the new group was established, Gillen was diagnosed with HIV. On December 1, 1993, about three years after his initial diagnosis, he died at his New Jersey home as a result of AIDS-related complications, caused by previous drug use. John West, Gillen's onetime Badlands replacement, was brought in to finish the Sun Red Sun recordings, and in 1998 toured with George Lynch. Five years later, the unreleased Badlands album \"Dusk\" (1998) was released in Japan.\n\n"}

It delivered breaking news, headline news each half-hour, and wide range of entertainment and lifestyle programs. The channel was available in the United States and in Europe. This station's \"Talk Back\" feature allowed viewers to voice their own input through the submission of videos and personal thoughts on controversial issues and current topics.\n\nAfter having attempted a 20-minute online news program three times a week hosted by Sam Donaldson in 1999, ABC News launched a forerunner of ABC News Now in March 2003. The service was fee based except for the customers of America Online, Comcast, and a few other Internet providers. Later, mobile phone users could access the programming through Sprint's MobiTV. The ABC News Now service launched on July 24, 2004, with extended coverage of the Democratic National Convention and Republican National Convention. The station was carried by digital subchannels of 70 ABC-owned stations and affiliates. The service was also available online as a subscription-based outlet. \n\nOn January 31, 2005, ABC News removed ABC News Now from owned and operated and affiliated TV stations' subchannel as the channel ended its experimental phase originally expected to end after election day but extended past inauguration. The channel would continue on the internet and wireless devices. 20/20 senior broadcast producer Mike Clemente was then hired as executive producer to head up the channel as a part of an increasing capacity being developed for the channel to returns a permanent channel in the Spring. The channel was relaunched as a cable channel and broadband service in early April 2005.\n\nOn November 5, 2007, Disney-ABC International Television announced plans to launch the channel in international territories, including Germany, Spain and Belgium in 2008 on IPTV service Zattoo, with more territories, including the United Kingdom, planned for the next 6 months. This marked the second international channel launched under ABC branding, the first being the United Kingdom general entertainment channel ABC1 which closed on September 26, 2007.\n\nOn October 28, 2013, ABC News launched a new cable news channel, Fusion, as a joint venture with Univision and contributing its ABC News Now operations. ABC News however later exited the joint venture.\n"}

These earliest known specimens were found in the Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania by Louis Leakey in the 1930s. The name Oldowan was given to the tools after the site in which they were excavated. These types of tools were used an estimated time range of 2.5 to 1.2 million years ago.\n\nTo create this tool, one would have to use a hammerstone to chip away flakes on the stone to create a side of the stone with a very sharp edge, allowing for the cutting and hacking of an object. This is a unique type of lithic reduction, as only a single side of the stone is retouched to produce the cutting surface of the stone. The side that does not do the cutting is left unscathed, an unusual practice. These old instruments were made from specific materials. Initially, they were composed of quartz, quartzite, basalt, or obsidian. In the later years of the Oldowan age, two other materials were used: flint and chert. These materials could hold an edge while still being fairly easy to craft into the shape desired. The tool is designed to fit in the palm of the hand, and it is not attached to any other mount that could possibly be used. Known as one of the earliest tools (if not the earliest), its design is a very simple piece of technology, but its performance was very successful in many different scenarios. Seeing the history of these objects and how many cultures used them, it is not a surprise to find them spread throughout the world. A potential stone mass found today could be classified as a chopper if it has a worn edge showing evidence of tool use.\n\nChoppers are not solely limited to a single area on Earth:\nAlthough many choppers have been found in each region, this does not mean that the tools found are similarly made. Differences include the shape, length, material used, and other factors. This shows the variation among ancient cultures of the time and how each suited specific needs for each community.\n\nThe ancient peoples that inhabited the earth had many different stone tools to perform various activities. Choppers were used in equal amounts for woodworking, presumably for sharpening spears, and meat processing. However, choppers were used for many different purposes. Used for hacking, cutting, and chopping, choppers allowed early peoples to sever soft materials, especially meat and wood. One of the main uses of choppers was to cut through the meat and skins of hunted animals to obtain food, hide, and fur. The sharpness of the tool improved the overall process. Ridges and cut marks on bones can prove their use for the task. Also, these tools were used on plants, such as digging up roots and shaving and chopping wood.\n\nLater in history, it seems that choppers were being rendered obsolete by newer technology. The handheld tools for scraping and cutting were no longer sought after, for tools with shapes that fit the hand seemed to be the upcoming trend. Starting about 1.6 million years ago, this new technology evolution emerged, known as the Acheulean tradition. Tools classified under this category are known as the earliest indicators of hand axe usage. The biggest difference from the early Oldowan tools, or choppers, is the fact that two sides have had flakes chipped off, versus the single side of the chopper.\n\nInitial theories proposed by G. Isaac (1970s) that choppers were used for hunting and butchering. However, the size of the choppers did not suggest that it could be powerful enough to actually kill animals like the hippopotamus. L. Binford then proposed that animals were killed by carnivores and \"Homo\" was just a scavenger. This theory was tested by P. Shipman and R. Potts. Since the cut marked bones were tooth marked and there were no carcasses or disarticulation of any leftovers, the evidence pointed at the idea of \"Homo\" being a scavenger.\n\n\n"}

Unlike many other mantid families, the Empusidae are a monophyletic lineage. Empusidae mantids are ambush predators, with mouthparts adapted to feeding on other insects and small animals. The majority of Empusidae species are distributed throughout Africa, but they are also found in Southeast Asia and in the southern parts of Europe.\n\nThe Empusidae species \"Gongylus gongylodes\" (Linné, 1758) was the first mantid species ever to be described. Since \"Gongylus\" mantids have been fascinating entomologists and have been bred in captivity for a long time, their behavior and breeding preferences are well known, such as a defensive behavior of displaying a hissing noise by rubbing the anterior edges of its serrated fore wings to the femur of the hind legs.\n\nThe about 28 species of empusid mantids are all relatively large and bizarre looking. The prothorax is always surrounded by a crest and the femur of the middle and hind legs often have flap-like appendages. The pronotum is characteristically elongated and the abdomen is often lobed. Members of the Mantoidea superfamily possess a cyclopean ear, an organ situated on the metathorax, which has been proven to be an adaptation to bat predation. The presence of this adaptation has been dated to originate in the early Eocene.\nThe Empusidae belong to the superfamily Mantoidea, (“higher” mantises), together with the Mantidae and Hymenopodidae. Phylogenetic studies place the Empusidae as a sister group to the Hymenopodidae. The Empusidae and Hymenopodidae are, in turn, placed as sister groups to all other ambush mantids. [3]. Two subfamilies are placed within the Empusidae, Blepharodinae, and Empusinae. The Blepharodinae subfamily holds three genera, Blepharodes, Blepharopsis and Idolomantis. The Empusinae subfamily is divided into two tribes, the Empusini and Idolomorphini. The Empusini tribe holds five genera, \"Dilatempusa, Empusa, Gonglyus\", and \"Hypsicorypha\". The Idolomorphini tribe holds the three remaining genera, \"Hemiempusa, Idolomorpha\", and \"Chopardempusa\". The latest phylogeny was revised by Svenson et al. 2015.\n\n\n"}

It was the first commercial bank in the Western United States, the second-richest bank in the nation, and considered instrumental in developing the American Old West.\n\nThe ancestor of the bank was the banking firm of Garrison, Morgan, Fretz & Ralston, established in San Francisco in January 1856 by a group that included Ralston, Cornelius K. Garrison and R.S. Fretz. Ralston established the Bank of California in 1864 when he sold shares to 22 of the state's leading businessmen for $100 a share. The bank opened on July 4, 1864, with Darius Ogden Mills as president and Ralston as cashier; Louis McLane was on the board of directors. A branch was opened in Gold Hill, Nevada, near Virginia City, on September 4, 1864. William Sharon was long the bank's Nevada agent.\n\nBuilt of stone quarried on nearby Angel Island in San Francisco Bay, the Bank of California Building at the NW corner of California and Sansome streets in San Francisco was said to be \"one of the handsomest structures on the coast …\"\n\nThe Bank of California financed a number of mining operations of the Comstock Lode, and repossessed some mines when their owners defaulted, and ultimately generated enormous profits as a result. However, Ralston sometimes lent money to mine owners in circumstances that would inevitably lead to default and repossession. At the height of their power, Ralston and his \"Ring\" (as his associates were known) were able to exert monopolistic influence over sections of commerce and industry in San Francisco and in Virginia City.\n\nIn July 1869, Ralston averted a run on the bank by exchanging nearly $1 million worth of gold bars for an equivalent value in gold coin from the United States Sub-Treasury in San Francisco. The transfer was carried out in the middle of the night by two of Ralston's associates, Asbury Harpending and Maurice Dore. When the bank opened in the morning, the sight of tray after tray of gold coin at the tellers' windows quashed any thought by depositors of mounting a run on the bank.\n\nMills retired as president of the Bank of California in October 1873 and was succeeded by Ralston, who kept Mills on the board of directors for the prestige of his name.\n\nAt a time of volatile trading of Nevada mining stocks, a run on the Bank of California occurred on Thursday, August 26, 1875. The bank failed, and Ralston was ruined. The next morning he executed a deed of trust, turning over everything he owned to Sharon, and the deed was notarized. Ralston then admitted irregularities in banking practices to the board of directors and was ousted as president. He walked to the North Beach to get away from the angry crowds and went to the Neptune Bath House, where he was accustomed to swim in the ocean on summer days. He swam out as far as he could go, and did not return. When his body was recovered, it was found he had died of a stroke.\n\nThe bank reopened on October 2, 1875, with $2 million in gold coin on hand and Mills again president. When the San Francisco clearing house was established in 1876, the city's leading banks, in order of importance, were the Bank of California, the Nevada Bank (opened in 1875 with McLane as president), the Anglo-California Bank, Ltd., and Wells Fargo & Company. During the economic slump of 1878 the bank's capital was reduced by $2 million.\n\nUpon the retirement of Mills in 1878, William Alvord, a prominent merchant, was elected president of the bank. Under his leadership the Bank of California became one of the chief centers of exchange between European money markets and those of Japan and China.\n\nIt was Alvord who, in 1887, warned James C. Flood of signs of irregularities at the Nevada Bank, enabling Flood to avert the collapse of the Nevada Bank following the speculation of its cashier in the wheat market.\n\nAlvord was president of the Bank of California until his death in San Francisco on December 21, 1904. In January 1905, Homer S. King left Wells Fargo & Company to assume the presidency of the Bank of California.\n\nOn April 1, 1996, the bank merged with Union Bank to form Union Bank of California, becoming the third largest commercial bank in California.\n\nIn 2008 it became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Japanese Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, and was renamed MUFG Union Bank.\n\n"}

{"id": "1930288", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1930288", "title": "Anti-discrimination law", "text": "Anti-discrimination law\n\nAnti-discrimination law or non-discrimination law refers to legislation designed to prevent discrimination against particular groups of people; these groups are often referred to as protected groups or protected classes. Anti-discrimination laws vary by jurisdiction with regard to the types of discrimination that are prohibited, and also the groups that are protected by that legislation. Commonly, these types of legislation are designed to prevent discrimination in employment, housing, education, and other areas of social life, such as public accommodations. Anti-discrimination law may include protections for groups based on sex, age, race, ethnicity, nationality, disability, mental illness or ability, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity/expression, sex characteristics, religious, creed, or individual political opinions.\n\nAnti-discrimination laws are rooted in principles of equality, specifically, that individuals should not be treated differently due the characteristics outlined above. At the same time, they have often been criticised as violations of the inherent right of free association. Anti-discrimination laws are designed to protect against both individual discrimination (committed by individuals) and from structural discrimination (arising from policies or procedures that disadvantage certain groups). Courts may take into account both discriminatory intent and disparate impact in determining whether a particular action or policy constitutes discrimination.\n\nEquality and freedom from discrimination are outlines as basic human rights by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). While the UDHR is not binding, nations make a commitment to uphold those rights through the ratification of international human rights treaties. Specific treaties relevant to anti-discrimination law include the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, and the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.\n\nThe Racial Discrimination Act 1975 was the first major anti-discrimination legislation passed in Australia, aimed at prohibiting discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or national origin. Jurisdictions within Australia moved shortly after to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex, through acts including the Equal Opportunity Act 1977 and the Anti-Discrimination Act 1977. The Australian parliament expanded these protections with the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 (SDA) to cover all Australians and provide protections based on sex, relationship status, and pregnancy. Additionally, the SDA has been expanded to include gender identity and intersex status as protected groups. Discrimination based on disability status is also prohibited by the Disability Discrimination Act 1992.\n\nThe first Belgian anti-discrimination law of 25 February 2003 was anulled by the Belgian Constitutional Court. The Court ruled that the law was discriminative since its scope didn't include discrimination on the basis of a political opinion or language and thus violated the articles 10-11 of the Belgian Constitution, instituting the principle of equality before law. \n\nA new law came into force on the 9th of June 2007. This law prohibits any use of direct or indirect discrimination on the basis of age, sexual preference, marital status, birth, wealth, religion or belief, political or syndical opinion, language, current or future state of health, disability, physical or genetical property or social origin.\n\nThe European Union has passed several major anti-discrimination directives, the Racial Equality Directive and the Employment Equality Directive, and the Equal Treatment Directive. These directives set standards for all member countries of the European Union to meet; however each member state is responsible for creating specific legislation to achieve those goals.\n\nAll EU member states are also member states to the European Convention on Human Rights. Thus, article 14 of the Convention applies, which concerns a prohibition on discrimination on the ground of sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.\n\nLaws forbidding discrimination in housing, public facilities and employment were first introduced in the 1960s covering race and ethnicity under the Race Relations Act 1965 and the Race Relations Act 1968.\n\nIn the 1970s, anti-discrimination law was significantly expanded. The Equal Pay Act 1970 allowed women to bring action against their employer if they could show that they were being paid less compared to a male colleague for equal work or work of the same value. The Sex Discrimination Act 1975 forbade both direct and indirect discrimination on the basis of sex, and the Race Relations Act 1976 expanded the scope of anti-discrimination law on the basis of race and ethnicity.\n\nIn the 1990s, protections against discrimination on the basis of disability was added primarily through the Disability Discrimination Act 1995.\n\nIn the 2000s, the scope of employment anti-discrimination laws were expanded to cover sexual orientation (with the passage of the Employment Equality (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2003), age (the Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006), and religion/belief (Employment Equality (Religion or Belief) Regulations 2003).\n\nIn 2010, existing anti-discrimination law was combined into a single Act of Parliament, the Equality Act 2010. The Equality Act contains provisions forbidding direct, indirect, perceptive and associative discrimination on the basis of sex, race, ethnicity, religion and belief, age, disability, sexual orientation and gender reassignment. Employment law also protects employees from worse treatment based on being part-time workers, agency workers or being on fixed-term contracts.\n\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1964 was the first major development in anti-discrimination law in the US, though prior civil rights legislation (such as the Civil Rights Act of 1957) addressed some forms of discrimination, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was much broader, providing protections for race, color, religion, sex, or national origin in the areas of voting, education, employment, and public accommodations. This landmark legislation led the way for other federal legislation, which expanded upon the protected classes and forms of discrimination prohibited under federal legislation, such as the Fair Housing Act or the Americans with Disabilities Act. These protections have also been expanded through the courts interpretation of these pieces of legislation. For example, the 7th and 2nd circuit courts have both ruled that employment discrimination based on sexual orientation is a violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. In addition to federal legislation, there are numerous state and local laws that address discrimination that is not covered by these laws.\n\nEmployment rates for all disabled men and disabled women under 40 have decreased since the implementation of the ADA. This effect is especially pronounced for those with mental disabilities and for those with lower levels of education. However, there is evidence to suggest that the decrease in employment rates is partially explained by increased participation in educational opportunities. These decreases can be attributed to increased costs for employers to remain in compliance with ADA provisions; rather than bearing increased costs, companies hire fewer workers with disabilities. While popular conception is that the ADA has created the opportunity for legal recourse for those with disabilities, less than 10% of ADA related cases find in favor of the plaintiff.\n\nDavid Neumark and Wendy Stock find some evidence that sex discrimination/equal pay laws boosted the relative earnings of black and white females and reduced the relative employment of both black women and white women.\n\nWhere anti-discrimination legislation is in force, exceptions are sometimes included in the laws, particularly affecting the military and religious organizations.\n\nIn many nations with anti-discrimination legislation, women are excluded from holding certain positions in the military, such as serving in a frontline combat capacity or aboard submarines. The reason given varies; for example, the British Royal Navy cite the reason for not allowing women to serve aboard submarines as medical and related to the safety of an unborn fetus, rather than that of combat effectiveness.\n\nSome religious organizations are exempted from legislation. For example, in Britain the Church of England, in common with other religious institutions, has historically not allowed women to hold senior positions (bishoprics) despite sex discrimination in employment generally being illegal; the prohibition was confirmed by a vote by the Church synod in 2012.\n\nSelection of teachers and pupils in schools for general education but with a religious affiliation is often permitted by law to be restricted to those of the same religious affiliation even where religious discrimination is forbidden.\n\n\n"}
