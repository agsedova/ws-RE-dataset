This was solved by Margaret Potter, the wife of their producer, Trevor Hill, who also discovered them, when she woke him up one night announcing \"I've got it! Pinky and Perky!\" They were created by Czechoslovakian immigrants Jan and Vlasta Dalibor who moved to the village of Hundhill, leaving the pigs under the cupboard in The Bungalow. The characters of pigs were chosen because the pig is seen as a symbol of good luck in the former Czechoslovakia. The puppets, who had only very limited movements, looked very alike. Pinky wore red clothes and Perky wore blue, but this distinction was of little use on monochrome TV, so Perky often wore a hat.\n\nPinky and Perky spoke and sang in high-pitched voices, created by re-playing original voice recordings at twice the original recorded speed; the vocals were sung by Mike Sammes while the backing track was played at half normal speed (Sammes did the same job for Ken Dodd's Diddymen, as Ross Bagdasarian did for the \"original\" Chipmunks in the early 1960s)—hence the expression \"Pinky and Perky speed\", when an LP record is played at 45 rpm or 78 rpm instead of the correct 33⅓ rpm. Pinky and Perky would often sing cover versions of popular songs, but also had their own theme song, \"We Belong Together\".\n\nThey had their own fictional TV station \"PPC TV\". They also performed comedy sketches usually with a human foil (similar to Basil Brush). Actor John Slater worked with them as a straight man for many years, enduring soakings from water pistols and similar pranks. Other human companions included Roger Moffat, Jimmy Thompson, Bryan Burdon and Fred Emney.\n\nTheir show included other puppets such as \"the Beakles\" (an avian parody of the Beatles), Topo Gigio, a mouse puppet who appeared in many later episodes, as well as a female pig. Other puppets included Ambrose Cat, Basil Bloodhound, Bertie Bonkers the baby elephant, Conchita the Cow, Horace Hare and Vera Vixen.\n\nPinky and Perky also performed guest slots on other shows, including several appearances on \"Sunday Night at the London Palladium\".\n\nThe puppets also appeared on TV in the United States on a number of episodes of \"The Ed Sullivan Show\": 532 (14 September 1958), 548 (4 January 1959), 573 (5 July 1959), 740 (10 March 1963), 780 (23 February 1964, where they shared the bill with the Beatles and Morecambe and Wise) and 908 (26 February 1967).\n\nThe pigs featured in series, such as \"Pinky and Perky's Pop Parade\" and \"Pinky and Perky's Island\", for 11 years until 1968 on the BBC before transferring to ITV until 1972. There were no real people, sketches or stories in the shows at all. Instead, the puppets would be seen lip-synching and dancing to songs by the likes of Petula Clark. In this incarnation, each episode would end with the characters singing the Scaffold's hit \"Thank U Very Much\". At this point, there would be the only piece of spoken dialogue, which went along these lines:\n\nThe characters enjoyed a brief revival in the 1990s, on the short-lived children's series \"The Pig Attraction\". A children's annual was also produced in the '60s featuring their adventures.\nThe \"Pinky and Perky Show\" reappeared in an all-new CGI-animated television series on CBBC, beginning in November 2008 on BBC One. There are 52 episodes, each 13 minutes in length. Some of the old characters remained in the show, such as Vera Vixen (who often hatches schemes to try to get rid of the two pigs) and Morton Frog (who works in the production control room, usually running the end titles [or in \"Cartoon Mash-Up\", cueing the end music] at the end of an episode.). Alongside them, there were a host of new characters, such as K.T. the studio manager cat, Wilberforce the tortoise security guard (who comes up with impractical ideas for new acts or games for the show), and a pair of poodle receptionists called Tara and Tamara (who, in a recurring gag, often get Pinky and Perky's names wrong). There is also a steady stream of special 'celebrity' guests, many of which spoof better-known franchises, such as Doctor Who as \"Dr. Roo\" and Harry Potter as \"Harry Trotter\". The series was produced by Lupus Films, and line produced by Sally Marchant.\n\nA DVD of the new look Pinky and Perky, featuring eight episodes from the new series, entitled \"Licence to Swill\" was released in 2009.\n\nA comic strip based on the TV series was drawn by Jim Turnbull. \n\nAll singles were released on 7\" vinyl format unless otherwise stated:\n\n\n\n\n"}

It releases mostly (but not necessarily) mainstream music, and it has signed many prominent Croatian musicians of various music genres such as Dražen Zečić, Arsen Dedić, Mišo Kovač, Josipa Lisac, Goran Bare, Teška industrija, Thompson, Maksim Mrvica, Crvena jabuka, Jelena Rozga, Novi fosili, Opća opasnost, Rade Šerbedžija, Jacques Houdek, Parni valjak, Leteći odred, Mladen Grdović, Dino Dvornik, Dino Merlin, Hari Rončević, Adastra, Radojka Šverko, Klapa Sveti Florijan, Giuliano, Dječaci, Mate Bulić, Disciplin a Kitschme, Srebrna krila, Divlje jagode, Bosutski bećari, Indexi, Sinan Alimanović, Lu Jakelić, Mia Dimšić, Mia Negovetić, Nina Donelli and others. Today, Croatia Records claims to have 70% share of the Croatian music market and has 30 record stores. Being a continuation of Jugoton, from which it inherited a comprehensive audio and video collection, Croatia Records is also active in re-releasing numerous digitally remastered former Yugoslav pop and rock titles. Following the global retro trend, the company decided to re-introduce gramophone records as well.\n\nThe company that is today Croatia Records was founded in 1947 in Zagreb, the capital of the then-People's Republic of Croatia under the name Jugoton, a publicly owned company which was the largest record label and chain record store in the former SFR Yugoslavia. During several decades of its successful existence, Jugoton signed many eminent ex-Yugoslav artists such as: Indexi, Bijelo Dugme, Električni Orgazam, Haustor, Idoli and Leb i Sol, and also numerous important foreign stars for the domestic market including: Elvis Presley, The Beatles, Rolling Stones, Madonna, U2, David Bowie, Queen, Deep Purple, Pink Floyd, Iron Maiden, Kraftwerk, Depeche Mode etc. The company also owned a chain of record shops across Yugoslavia. Many Yugoslav entries in the Eurovision Song Contest were signed with Jugoton including the 1989 winners Riva.\n\nAfter the transition from socialist state to parliamentary democracy in 1989, the question of Croatia's self-determination from Yugoslavia was raised. In 1991, shortly before the declaration of Croatian independence and the breakup of Yugoslavia, the company's name Jugoton, a portmanteau word of \"Jugoslavija\" (Yugoslavia) and \"tone\", was changed to Croatia Records. Parallelly, the major labels in Serbia and Slovenia such as PGP RTB and ZKP RTLJ were renamed to PGP-RTS and ZKP RTVS respectively. The company was inherited by the now-independent Republic of Croatia and since the previous economic system was abandoned, it was privatized. Since the year of 2000, Croatia Records is managed by professionals from the music industry joined in the partnership company called AUTOR d.o.o. (limited company). In 2001, the musician Miroslav Škoro became the leader of Croatia Records, until his resignation in 2006.\n\nCroatia Records Music Publishing (CRMP d.o.o.) is a company owned by Croatia Records d.d. that specializes in the regulation of conditions of use of copyright music and digital distribution. Their activities include regulating the conditions of using music in media, advertising campaigns, on film, in the mobile industry, legal protection and promotion of copyright work, cooperation with a discography, associations for the collective protection of copyright and related rights.\n\nFounded in 1947. as a copyright department of former Jugoton and Since 1991 as a part of a major label house Croatia Records, today Croatia Records Music Publishing stands as an independent company. Croatia Records Music Publishing has the largest catalog of Croatian songs and the largest catalog of master recordings made in the last 40 years of the most famous Croatian singers, songwriters and composers such as Arsen Dedić, Đorđe Novković, Damir Urban, Nenad Ninčević, Zlatan Stipišić - Gibonni, Zdenko Runjić.\n\nCroatia Records Music Publishing has begun digitization of musical works issued by Croatia Records and is developing relationships between advertising agencies and production companies in the regulation of all rights necessary for the commercial exploitation of music. It also works on digital distribution of music in direct cooperation with the iTunes, Rebeat GMBH, Roba Music Verlag and other similar online stores.\n\nOften, the company was a target of public criticism on various issues.\n\nCroatia Records has been the object of a controversy raised by singer Branimir Štulić over royalty rights. Štulić claims royalties of songs by former rock band Azra, whose lead singer and songwriter he was in the 1980s, and which was then managed by Croatia Record's predecessor Jugoton. Štulić has named a sum of 12 million Euros he believes the company owes him but has not opted to take legal action to claim it. Želimir Babogredac replied that Croatia Records has all the legal rights to release titles by Štulić and Azra, as the company is a direct successor of Jugoton, whom these artists were signed for. He also said that the sum Štulić claims is exaggerated. However, he added that Croatia Records is proud to have the highly acclaimed Štulić in the list of its artists and that he may receive a payment from the sale of audio CDs only if he joins the Croatian Composers' Society - ZAMP.\n\n\n"}

He has a brother, a half-sister from his father's side, Enid, who is 20 years older than him and a half-brother Michael from his mother.\n\nByford was just 11 years old when his mother died. “Being so young,” he says, “it was a crushing blow. But that, I think, is when that will to survive was built in.”\n\nOnly two years later his father, whom Byford describes as a violent alcoholic, suffered a terrible accident while at work at a textile mill, losing an arm after it was entangled in a piece of heavy machinery.\n\nHe joined a youth club band at 14. When he was 15, in 1966, having left school to work as a junior carpenter, his first steady girlfriend, Linda, fell pregnant. They were promptly married. But the marriage didn't last, even though the couple had two children.\n\nAt 18, in 1969, he was employed at the Shuttle Eye pit at Flockton, near Huddersfield. At six-foot-one he was considered too tall to work underground, in tunnels only three feet high. So instead he worked in the boiler house, manning a giant steam engine that drew up the coal from a mile deep.\n\nHe was taught to play guitar by his best friend's brother, who led a local blues group. Byford switched to bass, and passed through various bands in the Barnsley area. His first appearance on an album was in 1971 when he played flute and wrote a few of the songs on the self titled debut album by psychedelic rockers Jumble Lane, a Holyground Records release. He started singing backing vocals when he joined the Iron Mad Wilkinson Band, named after a local industrialist.\n\nByford sang and played bass with a local power trio called Coast from around 1973 to 1976 along with drummer Al Dodd and future Saxon guitarist Paul Quinn, when he formed Saxon with guitarists Graham Oliver and Paul Quinn, bassist Steve Dawson and former Glitter Band drummer Pete Gill. The band was originally called Son of a Bitch, but changed to Saxon in 1978. They released their self-titled debut album in 1979, and became part of what was known as the new wave of British heavy metal, which also included bands like Iron Maiden, Demon and Def Leppard. The band had commercial success as well, charting eight consecutive UK Top 40 albums and five Top 40 singles between 1980 and 1986.\n\nAt the end of the 1980s, the band declined in popularity, with 1988's Destiny being their last UK charting album until 2007. Oliver and Dawson left the band and formed a new band with the same name, though they were later forced to change it to Oliver/Dawson Saxon. (Byford's) Saxon maintained a recording and touring career centred on Germany for much of the 1990s, before coming back into broader attention with 2007's \"The Inner Sanctum\".\n\nIn April 2007, Byford released his autobiography, entitled \"Never Surrender\" after the Saxon song of the same name. Gigwise.com reported on 18 January 2010 that Byford was launching a campaign to have Britons declare heavy metal as their religion in the United Kingdom Census 2011, inspired by the Jedi census phenomenon (where 2001 Census results suggested that Jediism was the UK's fourth most popular religion).\n\nByford is currently in the studio recording his upcoming debut solo album. The disc, titled \"School of Hard Knocks\", features guest appearances by Phil Campbell, Alex Holzwarth, Nicholas Barker, Dave Kemp and Nibbs Carter is tentatively due for release in February 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

According to Dai, the historical imagery of their films tend to produce \"oriental landscapes\" that are oriented towards Western reception and prize recognition.\n\nIn addition, she has written extensively about the representation of women in Chinese film. In one of her most well-known critiques, she examines the trope of gender-crossing through the myth of Hua Mulan (a woman who disguises herself as a man to join the army as a substitute for her father) in a series of women-centered films such as New Women, and revolutionary operas such as White-Haired Girl and the Red Detachment of Women. For her, this myth usefully indicates how drag, which can be subversive of patriarchal systems, can also reinforce them.\n\nDai's work is generally critical of capitalism—she has been associated with the New Left. One of her analyses of consumerism in China traces the transformation of the word \"guangchang,\" which referred to the politicized space of the public square, but now is often used in the names of shopping centers. She has also described the market for souvenirs and historical tours related to the Maoist era as \"imaginary nostalgia\" that acts as a “substitute for historical consciousness.\" \n\n\n\n"}

It is a puzzle video game played on a three-dimensional tower-like grid viewed in vector graphics with filled polygons.\n\nThe plot of the game is based on the biblical story of the Tower of Babel. At the height of the tower's construction, while it failed in its original purpose to directly contact God, it caught the attention of a passing Zantorian alien spaceship. The Zantorians descended and left three spider-like robots to help the Shinarians in constructing the tower. However, distrust broke out among the two species, and the humans betrayed the robots, stealing their energy packs (called \"Klondikes\"). Playing the robots, it is the player's job to find the energy packs to be able to get back home to Zantor.\n\nThe game play is purely puzzle-based. The famous Tower of Babel itself does not actually appear; instead there are several differently-configured 8*8*4 towers (four floors of 8*8 squares each).\n\nThe Zantorians robots are called the Grabber, the Pusher and the Zapper. Each of these has different abilities. The Grabber can collect Klondikes and operate various devices, the Pusher can push things further away, and the Zapper can destroy things. In a tower, players can be assigned any combination of these robots, depending on the tower's design. In each tower, the player's goal is either to destroy a set number of objects, collect a set number of Klondikes, or both. Towers with Klondikes to collect need the Grabber, but the other robots can sometimes be superfluous, and indeed, the destruction of these robots is sometimes necessary for the completion of a tower.\n\nEverything in the game is viewed in a realistic 3D vector graphics view, but the actual movement in the game is far more contained than in games usually associated with such graphics, only allowing square-by-square movement in rectangular directions and vertical movement using special lifts.\n\nVarious devices, sentry mechanisms and autonomous robots also inhabit each tower. Some of these can be used to gain an advantage, while some hinder progress.\n\n\"Tower of Babel\" also includes a construction kit where players can design their own towers and save them to disk for later play and distribution. The towers can be password-protected to avoid spoiling them by looking directly at the design.\n\nOne feature of the game is the ability to program the robots. Each robot can be given up to eight orders (for example: Forward, Forward, Left, Fire, Right, Forward). In some levels, programming the robots is mandatory, as they need to coordinate their actions in order to solve the level.\n\n\n\"Triogical\" is a Freeware puzzle game for Microsoft Windows inspired by \"Tower of Babel\".\n\nDue to its unique nature and the easily usable editor the game has acquired a small, but very dedicated community of fans. Thanks to emulation software like WinUAE the game can be played on modern PCs and homemade towers swapped via the Internet. Currently there is one remake in the making.\n\nIn July 2015, a remake for iPhone and iPad was released by Laser Point Software Ltd.\n\n"}

Given the differences in climate and crops around the world, harvest festivals can be found at various times at different places. Harvest festivals typically feature feasting, both family and public, with foods that are drawn from crops that come to maturity around the time of the festival. Ample food and freedom from the necessity to work in the fields are two central features of harvest festivals: eating, merriment, contests, music and romance are common features of harvest festivals around the world.\n\nIn North America, Canada and the US each have their own Thanksgiving celebrations in October and November.\n\nIn Britain, thanks have been given for successful harvests since pagan times. Harvest festival is traditionally held on the Sunday near or of the Harvest Moon. This is the full Moon that occurs closest to the autumn equinox (22 or 23 September). The celebrations on this day usually include singing hymns, praying, and decorating churches with baskets of fruit and food in the festival known as Harvest Festival, Harvest Home, Harvest Thanksgiving or Harvest Festival of Thanksgiving.\n\nIn British and English-Caribbean churches, chapels and schools, and some Canadian churches, people bring in produce from the garden, the allotment or farm. The food is often distributed among the poor and senior citizens of the local community, or used to raise funds for the church, or charity.\n\nHarvest festivals in Asia include the Chinese Mid-Autumn Festival (中秋節), one of the most widely spread harvest festivals in the world. In Iran Mehrgan was celebrated in an extravagant style at Persepolis. Not only was it the time for harvest, but it was also the time when the taxes were collected. Visitors from different parts of the Persian Empire brought gifts for the king, all contributing to a lively festival. In India, Makar Sankranti, Thai Pongal, Uttarayana, Lohri, and Magh Bihu or Bhogali Bihu in January, Holi in February–March, Vaisakhi in April and Onam in August–September are a few important harvest festivals.\n\nJews celebrate the week-long harvest festival of Sukkot in the autumn. Observant Jews build a temporary hut or shack called a sukkah, and spend the week living, eating, sleeping, and praying inside it. A sukkah has three walls and a semi-open roof, designed to allow the elements to enter. It is reminiscent of the tabernacles Israelite farmers would live in during the harvest, at the end of which they would bring a portion of the harvest to the Temple in Jerusalem.\n\nAn early harvest festival used to be celebrated at the beginning of the harvest season on 1 August and was called Lammas, meaning 'loaf Mass'. The Latin prayer to hallow the bread is given in the Durham Ritual. Farmers made loaves of bread from the fresh wheat crop. These were given to the local church as the Communion bread during a special service thanking God for the harvest.\n\nBy the sixteenth century a number of customs seem to have been firmly established around the gathering of the final harvest. They include the reapers accompanying a fully laden cart; a tradition of shouting \"Hooky, hooky\"; and one of the foremost reapers dressing extravagantly, acting as 'lord' of the harvest and asking for money from the onlookers. A play by Thomas Nashe, \"Summer's Last Will and Testament\", (first published in London in 1600 but believed from internal evidence to have been first performed in October 1592 at Croydon) contains a scene which demonstrates several of these features. There is a character personifying harvest who comes on stage attended by men dressed as reapers; he refers to himself as their \"master\" and ends the scene by begging the audience for a \"largesse\". The scene is clearly inspired by contemporary harvest celebrations, and singing and drinking feature largely. The stage instruction reads:\n\n<poem>\"Enter Haruest with a sythe on his neck, & all his reapers with siccles, and a great black bowle with a posset in it borne before him: they come in singing.\"</poem>\nThe song which follows may be an actual harvest song, or a creation of the author's intended to represent a typical harvest song of the time:\n\n<poem>\nMerry, merry, merry, cheary, cheary, cheary,\nTrowle the black bowl to me ;\nHey derry, derry, with a poupe and a lerry,\nIle trowle it again to the:\n\nHooky, hooky, we have shorn,\nAnd we have bound,\nAnd we have brought Harvest\nHome to town.\n</poem>\n\nThe shout of \"hooky, hooky\" appears to be one traditionally associated with the harvest celebration. The last verse is repeated in full after the character Harvest remarks to the audience \"Is your throat cleare to helpe us sing \"hooky, hooky\"?\" and a stage direction adds, \"Heere they all sing after him\". Also, in 1555 in Archbishop Parker's translation of Psalm 126 occur the lines:\n\n<poem>\n\"He home returnes: wyth hocky cry,\nWith sheaues full lade abundantly.\"\n</poem>\n\nIn some parts of England \"Hoakey\" or \"Horkey\" (the word is spelled variously) became the accepted name of the actual festival itself:\n\n<poem>\n\"Hoacky is brought Home with hallowing\nBoys with plum-cake The Cart following\".\n</poem>\n\nAnother widespread tradition was the distribution of a special cake to the celebrating farmworkers. A prose work of 1613 refers to the practice as predating the Reformation. Describing the character of a typical farmer, it says:\n\n<poem>\"Rocke Munday..Christmas Eve, the hoky, or seed cake, these he yeerely keepes, yet holds them no reliques of popery.\"</poem>\n\nEarly English settlers took the idea of harvest thanksgiving to North America. The most famous one is the harvest Thanksgiving held by the Pilgrims in 1621.\n\nNowadays the festival is held at the end of harvest, which varies in different parts of Britain. Sometimes neighbouring churches will set the Harvest Festival on different Sundays so that people can attend each other's thanksgivings.\n\nUntil the 20th century most farmers celebrated the end of the harvest with a big meal called the harvest supper, to which all who had helped in the harvest were invited. It was sometimes known as a \"Mell-supper\", after the last patch of corn or wheat standing in the fields which was known as the \"Mell\" or \"Neck\". Cutting it signified the end of the work of harvest and the beginning of the feast. There seems to have been a feeling that it was bad luck to be the person to cut the last stand of corn. The farmer and his workers would race against the harvesters on other farms to be first to complete the harvest, shouting to announce they had finished. In some counties the last stand of corn would be cut by the workers throwing their sickles at it until it was all down, in others the reapers would take it in turns to be blindfolded and sweep a scythe to and fro until all of the Mell was cut down.\n\nSome churches and villages still have a Harvest Supper. The modern British tradition of celebrating Harvest Festival in churches began in 1843, when the Reverend Robert Hawker invited parishioners to a special thanksgiving service at his church at Morwenstow in Cornwall. Victorian hymns such as \"We plough the fields and scatter\", \"Come, ye thankful people, come\" and \"All things bright and beautiful\" but also Dutch and German harvest hymns in translation helped popularise his idea of harvest festival, and spread the annual custom of decorating churches with home-grown produce for the Harvest Festival service. On 8 September 1854 the Revd Dr William Beal, Rector of Brooke, Norfolk, held a Harvest Festival aimed at ending what he saw as disgraceful scenes at the end of harvest, and went on to promote 'harvest homes' in other Norfolk villages. Another early adopter of the custom as an organised part of the Church of England calendar was Rev Piers Claughton at Elton, Huntingdonshire in or about 1854.\n\nAs British people have come to rely less heavily on home-grown produce, there has been a shift in emphasis in many Harvest Festival celebrations. Increasingly, churches have linked Harvest with an awareness of and concern for people in the developing world for whom growing crops of sufficient quality and quantity remains a struggle. Development and Relief organisations often produce resources for use in churches at harvest time which promote their own concerns for those in need across the globe.\n\nIn the early days, there were ceremonies and rituals at the beginning as well as at the end of the harvest.\n\n\"Encyclopædia Britannica\" traces the origins to \"the animistic belief in the corn [grain] spirit or corn mother.\" In some regions the farmers believed that a spirit resided in the last sheaf of grain to be harvested. To chase out the spirit, they beat the grain to the ground. Elsewhere they wove some blades of the cereal into a \"corn dolly\" that they kept safe for \"luck\" until seed-sowing the following year. Then they plowed the ears of grain back into the soil in hopes that this would bless the new crop.\n\n\n"}

Located on the Menashe plateau between the Carmel mountain range and the Jezreel Valley, it falls under the jurisdiction of Megiddo Regional Council. In , it had a population of .\n\nRamot Menashe is located in the Menashe Heights, after which the kibbutz is named. The kibbutz is surrounded by open terrain, mostly agricultural lands worked by members of the kibbutz. The main traffic routes connecting the kibbutz to its surroundings are Highway 6 and Route 672.\n\nAccording to Benny Morris, the kibbutz is located on land close to Daliyat al-Rawha', a depopulated Palestinian village, while Walid Khalidi notes that the land of Ramot Menashe actually belonged to the former village of Sabbarin.\n\nIn 1946, a gar'in of the Hashomer Hatzair movement, made up of Holocaust survivors and Jewish insurgents from Austria and Poland was established. The gar'in was named \"Bone HaNegev\" (\"builders of the Negev\") and the members planned to build a settlement in the Negev. In April 1946, the members of the gar'in boarded a ship in La Spezia, Italy along with 1,400 other Jewish holocaust survivors, but the British discovered the ship and prevented it from sailing. The citizens of La Spezia sent food and aid to the ship and put pressure on the British to allow the ship to sail to Palestine, and eventually the British allowed the ship to sail. On 18 May 1946, the members arrived in Palestine. Despite their desire to settle in the Negev, they were sent to Ein HaShofet and Dalia for training and on 29 July, 1948, they settled as a kibbutz, numbering 64 members. The kibbutz served as a military outpost during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, and after the war, the members moved to a nearby location. They started clearing the land and planting trees. Living conditions were harsh during the early days, when the members lived in barracks and tents, disconnected from water and electricity. In November 1948, the kibbutz adopted the name \"Ramot Menashe\".\n\nDuring the early years, the kibbutz absorbed several gar'ins of Hashomer Hatzair from South America. In 1950, the kibbutz absorbed a group 95 Hashomer Hatzair members from Chile and Uruguay. In 1955, another group of 23 Uruguayan immigrants arrived, and in 1962 another 31 members of a youth group called \"Eshet\".\n\nIn the 1980s, the kibbutz entered an economic crisis as part of the national bank stock crisis. The economic crisis ended in the 1990s, when a strict recovery plan was activated: unprofitable economic sectors were closed, some of the kibbutz's assets were sold to private hands, the community budget was cut and a gradual process of privatization took place. The kibbutz switched the traditional collective structure and moved to a \"safety net\" structure.\n\nIn the early 2000s, the kibbutz built a new neighborhood of 138 households. The residents of the neighborhood are not members of the kibbutz, but enjoy the kibbutz's community services. Thus, the kibbutz reached the limit of households per Israel's National Outline Plan no. 35, which limits the maximum number of households in the kibbutz to 400 until 2020. In 2011, during the nationwide social justice protest, the members of the kibbutz demanded that the government will release land around the kibbutz for its expansion. The main motive was to allow previous members of the kibbutz to return and build their homes in it.\n\nThe main source of Ramot Menashe's profits comes from industrial activity, while some agricultural sectors are active, such as cowsheds, Avocado groves and field crops. Tourism and entertainment also developed in the kibbutz.\n\nUntil the 1980s, Ramot Menashe's economy was based on agriculture: crops, plantations, cotton and livestock. In parallel, an effort was made to develop industrial activity, which led to the establishment of the Arad factory.\nThe social structure was collective, where all members received the same salary for different roles and the kibbutz owned most of the property and businesses. After an economic crisis in the 1990s, the kibbutz underwent a series of privatizations and reforms, including the cancellation of equal salaries and the reducing of the collective structure to a social safety net.\n\nThe kibbutz owns part of the Arad Ltd. company which manufactures water-meters in a factory located in the kibbutz. The company is run by the kibbutz in partnership with Kibbutz Dalia (the company is based in Dalia). In 2004, the company was issued in the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. The company owns several other minor companies under the \"Arad Group\".\n\n\n"}

Prior to his return to the Defense Intelligence Agency as its director, Williams served as Deputy Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence, United States Army, and the Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence, United States Army, Europe, leading the first team of DOD analysts to provide strategic early warning of Contingency Planning for Martial Law in Soviet-dominated Poland vice Warsaw Pact intervention. In September 1981, he was appointed the Director of DIA.\n\nWilliams culminated 31 years service with a four-year tour as Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency(DIA). He was the senior intelligence officer (SIO) for the Department of Defense (DoD) and directed intelligence analysis for DoD and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He initiated widespread use of open source collection of foreign scientific and technical information by DIA as well as establishment of the Military Intelligence Integrated Data System(MIIDS). Under the General's supervision DIA, in conjunction with the Central Intelligence Agency, brought into operation the Secure Analyst File Environment(SAFE) an interactive system of intelligence analyst files. Under his direction DIA established the first formal requirements for imagery from civilian satellites such as LANDSAT. Williams was also instrumental in creating the first computerized threat methodologies for DoD and established the first threat validation system for the Defense Acquisition Cycle\n\nWilliams focused the Agency on enhancing support to tactical and theater commanders, improving capabilities to meet major wartime intelligence requirements, and strengthening indications and warning assets. In this regard he was responsible for establishing the first terrorism warning billets in the Agency and for placing the first United States Coast Guard Attachés on station. During his tenure the Defense Intelligence College was chartered by Congress to award a master's degree of Strategic Intelligence, the first federally chartered institution to be authorized to award a graduate level degree.\n\nIn December 1981, President Reagan signed Executive Order 12333 giving the Intelligence Community a mandate for the years ahead. In response to a requirement to improve intelligence support to the Unified & Specified Commands' war-fighting capabilities, the functional manager for intelligence processing was established in 1982. The Central America Joint Intelligence Team (CAJIT) was established in 1984 as an interagency analytical task organization focused on insurgency in Central America. DIA also created the Intelligence Communications Architecture to improve DoD's ability to disseminate national level intelligence to tactical commanders during contingency situations. The concept of intelligence as a “force multiplier in crises” became a predominant theme in planning as DIA began structuring an all source integrated database to support the Unified & Specified Commands in assessing the threat in the field Williams established a Research Crisis Support Center to provide a centralized, operationally secure, all-source, crisis management center to support the National Military Intelligence Center (NMIC) and the Unified & Specified Commands. As events deteriorated in Nicaragua, DIA analysts provided extensive support to the U.S. Southern Command.\n\nOther analysis focused on the Falkland Islands War and Israel's invasion of Lebanon. When 6,000 U.S. troops invaded Grenada during Operation URGENT FURY in 1983, DIA's Task Force responded to numerous formal taskings for briefings and information, and distributed a wide variety of intelligence summaries to assist field commanders during the operation. The planning process for URGENT FURY was greatly facilitated by a number of intelligence products that had been prepared as early as 1979, bringing high praise for DIA's support and services. Other DIA analytical efforts during the year centered on the continuing crises in Nicaragua, Lebanon (the attack on the Marine barracks), Iran and Iraq, and Afghanistan, as well as the Soviet shoot-down of KAL 007, the civil war in Chad, and unrest in the Philippines. A significantly larger number of hijackings, bombings, kidnappings, murders, and other acts of terrorism led to characterizing 1985 as the \"Year of the Terrorist.\"\n\nFinally, Williams oversaw the Agency's move into its new headquarters at Bolling Air Force Base from Arlington Hall Station. The Defense Intelligence Analysis Center (DIAC) was dedicated on May 23, 1984.\n\nSince his retirement from the U.S. Army in 1985, Williams has served as senior consultant for a variety of projects dealing with the collection, processing and analysis of intelligence; integration of intelligence data processing systems and revitalization of the civil remote sensing program. Williams played a major role as an advisor for two projects to improve imagery collection management. He also serves as a member of intelligence advisory panels for Los Alamos and Sandia National Laboratories and is a member of the Special Technologies Advisory Panel for the Department of Energy.\n\nWilliams was one of the pioneers in the use of open source data for commercial purposes. Since 1987 he has been President of the Direct Information Access Corporation (DIAC), which specializes in the production of commercial intelligence.\n\nWilliams served for five years as the Chairman of a task force overseeing the creation of the Defense HUMINT Service. He also served as an advisor for the Army on the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Program and played a major role on two projects to improve imagery collection management.\n\nFollowing are some of the programs and groups that he has participated in:\n\n\nWilliams' military decorations include the Defense Superior Service Medal, Legion of Merit with Oak Leaf Cluster, the Bronze Star with \"V\" Device and Oak Leaf Cluster, the Meritorious Service Medal with two Oak Leaf Clusters, the Air Medal, Joint Service Commendation Medal, the Army Commendation Medal, The National Defense Service Medal, the Vietnam Service Medal with four stars, the Army Service Ribbon, the Army Overseas Service Ribbon, the Vietnam Armed Forces Honor Medal, and the Vietnam Campaign Medal.\n\nUnit awards include the Army Meritorious Unit Commendation, and the Vietnam Gallantry Cross Unit Citation, the French Legion of Honor and the German Order of the Knights Commander.\n\nBadges include the Office of the Secretary of Defense Identification Badge, Joint Staff Identification Badge, the Army General Staff Identification Badge, the Defense Intelligence Agency Badge, and the Expert Marksmanship Badge.\n\nWilliams is also the recipient of the National Intelligence Distinguished Service Medal, He is a member of the Military Attaché Hall of Fame and is a Distinguished Member of the Military Intelligence Hall of Fame.\n\n"}

He was a radio disc jockey and news anchor and reporter while stationed on Okinawa, Japan, in the early 1990s. As a civilian, Morrison began his career at WGMC-TV in Worcester, Massachusetts. He later worked at WWLP-TV in Springfield, Massachusetts, and in Hartford, Connecticut. As a foreign correspondent, he reported from Iraq and Qatar during the Second Gulf War; Afghanistan, where he embedded with the Marines during Operation Enduring Freedom in 2001; and Haiti.\n\nIn 1999, Morrison began a nine-year period at WNBC, the New York City, flagship station of the NBC television network. There he co-anchored \"Today in New York\" and \"Weekend Today in New York\", the station's early-morning, local-news-and-entertainment television program. n 2001, Morrison moved to the station's weekend-evening newscasts.\n\nIn 2004, he was made a co-anchor of the weekday edition of \"Today in New York\", alongside Darlene Rodriguez, and stayed in that position until 2008 when he left the station. During Morrison's time with WNBC, he also served as a correspondent for NBC News, as well as a news reader for \"Weekend Today\", also an early-morning, news-and-entertainment television program and a production of NBC News.\n\nAfter leaving WNBC and NBC, Morrison wrote a blog, \"Daddy Diaries Confessions of a Stay-at-Home Anchorman\", which was published on \"The Huffington Post\", a news website and content-aggregating blog.\nIn 2009, he joined WCBS, a local broadcast-television station also located in New York City and the flagship station of the CBS broadcast-television network where Morrison has anchored the station's morning and evening weekend newscasts.

The village is situated high on the North Downs, immediately west of Caterham and south of Charing Cross, the traditional centre of London.\n\n\"Chalvedune\" is the first written record of the place in 675 AD, meaning the hill (down) where calves were pastured, in a grant of land to Chertsey Abbey. Prior to this period of human history, White Hill on the borders of Chaldon and Caterham has yielded neolithic flints.\n\nThe village lay within the Anglo-Saxon administrative division of Wallington hundred.\n\nIn the Domesday Book the manor of \"Calvedone\" appears in Wallington hundred rendering £4 to its lord Ralph Fitz Turold, holding it as was most of the hundred of Bishop Odo of Bayeux. Prior to the conquest it had been held by the Saxon lord Dernic of King Edward. It consisted of two hides, land for two lord's plough teams and a church. In medieval times the parish included a narrow strip of land below the southern foot of the Downs and a wedge of land to the north of the church that in the 19th century were transferred to Bletchingley and Coulsdon respectively — these are omitted from this article.\n\nAn inscribed stone dedicates a pond for use by residents not animals dated to the late 18th or early 19th century illustrates the lack of water in the village during summer months. St Catherine's south chancel chapel in the church became devoted to the memory of Christian Hane (d.1752) of an aedicular type with a white stone rectangular panel flanked by Doric pilasters with red marble inlay, swan-neck pediment and crowning shell.\n\nThe Grade I architecturally listed church of Saints Peter and Paul (built before 1086 AD) contains a large wall painting of around 1170 depicting images of the ways of salvation and damnation and their result \n\nUnder Rev. James Legrew, the tithes were commuted for £335. 11s 3d, however as rector retaining a glebe of 31 acres, with a glebe house. A tower and spire were added to the church in 1843 from a bellcote before. Given its steep, dry landscape on top of the North Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, Chaldon did not develop new homes substantially even in the 19th and 20th centuries; though replacements to farmhouses were built in this period. In 1848 the population was 197 and the population in 1901 was only 266\nand it consisted of little more than \"the church and six scattered farms\". By 1911 Viscount Hylton connected his farms and cottages with the East Surrey Water Company's mains; otherwise the supply depended upon the shallow wells and ponds, filled in a wet season and empty in a dry one.\n\nChaldon has received by some locals the epithet \"Little Switzerland\" because of the microclimate resulting in heavier snowfall here than in other parts of the region when there is snow in Winter. Caterham-on-the-Hill is centred ENE of Chaldon and London is north.\n\nThe civil parish of Chaldon fell within the Reigate Poor Law Union upon its creation in 1837, subsequently coming under control of Reigate Rural Sanitary District from 1875 and Reigate Rural District from 1894 until its abolition in 1933. Thereafter it became part of the Caterham & Warlingham Urban District until 1 April 1974 when the major local government reorganisation brought Chaldon under the newly formed Tandridge District.\n\nFor the purposes of parliamentary elections, Chaldon became part of the Eastern Division of the Surrey county constituency upon its creation in 1832. It moved to the Mid Division in 1867, to the South Eastern Division in 1885, to the Reigate Division in 1918 and to the East Surrey Division in 1948 where it remains to this day.\n\nSurrey County Council, headquartered in Kingston, elected every four years, has one representative councillor as follows: \nChaldon has a representative on Tandridge District Council, headquartered in Oxted:\nChaldon's residents can participate in the Civil Parish Council with five village councillors and the parish clerk.\n\nIn 2001, there were 1,821 residents in 639 households of which 18.8% were aged over 65; 4.5% of the population were in full-time further education; 70.9% of all men were economically active whereas 3.2% were unemployed, 5.2% worked part-time; 58.9% of all women were economically active whereas 1.2% were unemployed, 37.7% worked part-time.\n\nAs to ethnicity, 97.3% of the population identified themselves as being white, 0.5% as mixed, 1.0% as of Indian descent, and 1.5% as other of the three main categories.\n\nIn terms of religion, 80.1%% of the population responded as being Christian, 0.6% as Muslim, 2.0% other religions, 11.1% as atheist and 6% declined to answer.\n\nChaldon's economy is predominantly a service sector economy reflected by the lower end of the official categorisation table of occupation given, compiled from the 2001 census:\n\nWhereas in this census, 24% of the population worked in lower managerial and professional occupations and 7.9% in higher professional occupations.\nThe average level of accommodation in the region composed of detached houses was 28%, the average that was apartments was 22.6%.\nThe proportion of households in the civil parish who owned their home outright compares to the regional average of 35.1%. The proportion who owned their home with a loan compares to the regional average of 32.5%. The remaining % is made up of rented dwellings (plus a negligible % of households living rent-free).\n\nAlong the north street, Church Lane, is a line of houses ending with the Church Green. Here is a close cluster of five listed buildings including the two most highly ranked listed buildings plus farm outbuildings. This area forms a conservation area. Its booklet with hand-drawn illustrations was produced in 1975, year of European Architectural Heritage.\nOn Roffes Lane at no. 18 and no. 20 are two unusual Arts and Crafts elm timber framed and panelled cottages by the architect Ernest George Trobridge. There was a third at no. 22; however, this was demolished in 2015 and no. 18 is under threat from developers.\n\nSee above.\n\nThis Grade II* listed timber-framed building was built in the 14th century and encased in brick and flint in the 18th century; its door is of the Tudor period. Its large gable ends have a large window housing a third floor; however, its extension at a right-angle has instead two taller storeys, slightly lower in height.\n\nAlthough almost a plateau, the highest part of Chaldon is White Hill, which overlooks Caterham and south-east London beyond and is occupied by Surrey National Golf Course.\n\n"}

When William Morris the founder of Morris Motors was honoured with a title and elevated to the peerage he chose the name of his Nuffield, Oxfordshire village. When in 1948 the Morris Motors Agricultural Division launched its tractor range, the name Nuffield was chosen to be the brand name for the company's agricultural products. The design was similar to the new David Brown built tractors as the designer Dr. Merit had also worked on the design of the David Brown 50D before moving to Nuffield.\n\nMorris Motors Limited vice chairman, Sir Miles Thomas, announced to the I.S.M.A at Hull in 1946 \"Nuffield to Make Tractors\". Production started in 1948 with the Nuffield Universal tractor, launched at the Smithfield Show in December 1948. Designed by former David Brown tractor designer Dr. H E Merritt, who had been involved in tank design during the war.\n\nTractor manufacture was undertaken at the former Wolseley factory in Birmingham.\n\nPetrol-paraffin engine models introduced at the 1948 Smithfield Show were the Nuffield Universal M4 and the tricycle-wheeled M3. Both tractors were powered by an engine based on the side-valve Morris Commercial four-cylinder lorry engine, running on tractor vaporising oil and delivering 42 hp.\n\nThe first diesel powered Nuffield was the Universal DM4 which was powered by a 38 hp Perkins P4 (TA) engine. After Morris Motors became part of the British Motor Corporation (BMC) in 1951, the Perkins engine was retained until 1954 when it was replaced by a 45 h.p. BMC diesel engine.\n\nOriginal engine for both M4 and M3 was a Morris Commercial 4-cylinder sidevalve engine running on tractor vaporising oil, delivering 42 hp.\n\n\n\nBuilt from 1952 to 1961:\n\nBuilt from 1961 to 1964. All tractors built at Bathgate in Scotland from 1962.\n\nBuilt from 1964 to 1967 with 10 forward gears:\n\nIn 1968, BMC's holding company British Motor Holdings was amalgamated with the Leyland Motor Corporation which also owned Standard Triumph and Rover to become British Leyland. Tractor production continued under the Nuffield name until 1969 when the tractors were renamed as Leyland Tractors and the familiar poppy red livery was changed to a new two-tone blue Leyland corporate colour scheme.\n\n"}

In 2008, the Cerato was replaced by the Kia Forte, however, the \"Cerato\" name continues to be used in some markets.\n\nThe Kia Cerato was introduced in South Korea in 2003, sharing a platform with the Hyundai Elantra (XD) and using Hyundai's \"Beta II\" (\"G4GC\") (CVVT-enabled) four-cylinder engine.\n\nIt replaced the Sephia/Mentor sedan and Shuma hatchback.\n\nIn North America, the \"\"Spectra\"\" name was used when introduced for the 2004 model year, with \"Spectra5\" designating the hatchback. For Latin American markets, the Cerato was still named Sephia until 2005, when it was discontinued in favor of the name Spectra. In Europe, the Cerato was replaced by the Kia Cee'd.\n\nFor the Malaysian market, the first generation Spectra was launched in Malaysia on August 15, 2007 as the \"Spectra5\" available only with one trim level and with the hatchback bodystyle powered by a 1.6 litre four cylinder 16 valve DOHC CVVT engine with a 4-speed automatic transmission.\n\nIn 2006 a facelift version was introduced, including revised Gamma engines. Stylistically, the bumper and headlamps lost their pronounced crease near the grille area, the trunk lid became more rounded, and the taillights were reshaped.\n\nThe Kia Cerato R is the extensive facelift of the Kia Cerato to extend sales within the Chinese market, while the second generation Kia Cerato was sold as the Kia Forte in China at the same time. The design was significantly updated to be in line with other newer Kia products. The Horki 300EV is an compact electric sedan with the design being essentially a rebadged version of the Kia Cerato R from the Chinese market, it was unveiled on the 2016 Guangzhou Auto. The platform is the same as the first generation Kia Cerato, which is still in production in China as the Cerato R. \n\nThe second generation Kia Cerato was launched in South Korea in late 2008 under the Kia Forte name – a name that was used in most international markets. The \"Cerato\" name has been retained in some markets, such as Australia, Iran, South Africa and Brazil. In Singapore, the second generation model is badged \"Kia Cerato Forte\".\n\nAt the Sydney Motor Show, held from 9 to 19 October 2008, Kia introduced a new version of the Cerato sedan, which in Europe and North America was called Kia Forte. In the CIS countries, the second generation Cerato retained its name, and its sales began in March 2009.\nThe changes affected the elements of the interior and suspension. The car received a wider (4 cm) and longer (3 cm) body, a longer (4 cm) wheelbase and a wider (7 cm) gauge. However, ground clearance was reduced by a centimeter, thereby reducing the height by a centimeter. At the same time, the design of the rear suspension was simplified, which instead of independent multilink thrust became semi-dependent double-lever, with an elastic beam, which made it more reliable and easy to repair and maintain\n\nIn July 2012, Kia unveiled the next-generation Cerato as the Korean-market Kia K3. The sedan is sold in the United States as the Forte. A coupe and five-door hatchback were released later on.\n\nThe new Cerato is produced in South Korea at Kia's Hwasung Plant and in Mexico at Kia's Pesquería Plant.\n\nOn January 15, 2018 at the 2018 North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan, Kia unveiled the third generation Forte sedan. Taking styling cues from the Kia Stinger, the new Forte adopts a cab rearward exterior, resulting in a fastback profile and a short trunklid. The car is constructed with 54% advanced high-strength steel that is stronger than the outgoing model. The Forte will be offered with a 2.0L I4 carried over from the second generation model mated to either a six-speed manual transmission or Kia's first CVT.\n\nThe Kia Forte is available in three trim levels: base LX, mid-level S, and top-level EX, and went on sale in the fall of 2018 as a 2019 model year vehicle.\n"}

Carlson was the 1989 Miss America while representing her native state of Minnesota. She graduated from Stanford University with honors before embarking on a career in television. Gaining experience as anchor and reporter for several local network affiliates, she joined CBS News as a correspondent in 2000 and became the co-host of the Saturday edition of \"The Early Show\".\n\nIn 2005, Carlson moved to the Fox News television channel and became the co-host of the morning show \"Fox & Friends\" along with Steve Doocy and Brian Kilmeade. In 2013, she announced her departure from \"Fox & Friends\" and soon thereafter launched a new program called \"The Real Story with Gretchen Carlson\". Her contract with Fox News expired on June 23, 2016. On July 6, she filed a lawsuit against then Fox News Chairman and CEO Roger Ailes claiming sexual harassment. Subsequently, dozens of other women also stepped forward to accuse Ailes of harassment, and Ailes resigned under pressure. In September 2016, Carlson and 21st Century Fox settled the lawsuit for $20 million.\n\nHer autobiography, \"Getting Real\", was published in 2015 by Viking. Her second book, \"Be Fierce: Stop Harassment and Take Your Power Back\" was published by Hachette in 2017 and became a \"New York Times\" Bestseller.\n\nCarlson was raised in a Lutheran family in Anoka, Minnesota, the daughter of Karen Barbara (Hyllengren) and Lee Roy Carlson. She is of Swedish descent. Her grandfather was the pastor of the then second-largest Lutheran church in the United States. She graduated from Anoka-Hennepin School District 11's Anoka High School, where she was a 1984 class valedictorian. One of her childhood babysitters was Michele Bachmann, the future Republican congresswoman.\n\nGrowing up, Carlson was a violinist, who played on radio and television.\n\nIn 1984, Carlson was elected as one of the Anoka Homecoming attendants. She won the title of Miss Minnesota in 1988.\n\nCarlson graduated from Stanford University, where she studied organizational behavior. While there, she spent a study-abroad year at Oxford University, studying the works of Virginia Woolf.\n\nIn September 2011, Carlson was named to the inaugural class of the Anoka High School Hall of Fame.\n\nA year after becoming Miss America in 1989, Carlson secured a role on WRIC-TV as a co-anchor on the network and political commentator. \"Style Weekly\" deemed it a coup for WRIC-TV as it was a \"low-rated channel\" at the time. In 1992, she joined WCPO-TV as a media commentator and remained at the station for a period of two years. She later worked at WOIO, where Carlson and her colleague Denise Dufala, became the first women to co-anchor a primetime major-market newscast.\n\nNext, Carlson was the co-anchor of the Saturday edition of \"The Early Show\" on CBS along with Russ Mitchell. She joined CBS News as a correspondent in 2000 and began working on \"The Early Show\" in 2002. Before her tenure at CBS, she served as a weekend anchor and reporter for KXAS-TV in Fort Worth, Texas, and was an anchor and reporter at WOIO-TV in Cleveland, Ohio, and for WCPO-TV, in Cincinnati. She began her television career in Richmond, Virginia, as a political reporter for WRIC-TV.\nShe was moved to \"Fox & Friends\" initially as a weekend substitute host. But on September 25, 2006, a shifting of anchors, which included E.D. Hill moving to the 10 a.m. hour of \"Fox News Live\", opened a weekday slot on \"Fox & Friends\", which she filled. She co-hosted with Steve Doocy and Brian Kilmeade for several years. She left \"Fox & Friends\" in September 2013 to anchor a one-hour daytime program, \"The Real Story with Gretchen Carlson\", beginning in the fall of 2013, taking part of the slot opened by Megyn Kelly's move to primetime.\n\nOn July 6, 2016, Carlson filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against Fox News chairman Roger Ailes in the Superior Court of New Jersey and confirmed on her Twitter account that she was no longer with Fox News. In her complaint, Carlson alleged that she was fired from her program for refusing Ailes' sexual advances. Ailes at the time claimed the accusations were false, while the law firm representing Carlson claimed ten other women had contacted them to speak of Ailes' behavior at Fox News.\n\nCarlson's allegations received widespread media coverage. After Carlson came forward, six more women spoke to Gabriel Sherman of \"New York\" magazine, alleging that Ailes had sexually harassed them and that Ailes \"spoke openly of expecting women to perform sexual favors in exchange for job opportunities.\" Shortly thereafter, Carlson sat down for an interview with John Koblin of \"The New York Times\", saying, \"I wanted to stand up for other women who maybe facing similar circumstances.\"\n\nAs the case progressed, Carlson reached out directly to her fans, thanking them in a series of Twitter videos and offering her support for fellow victims of sexual harassment. She also criticized Fox's attempt to force her claims to be adjudicated via closed-door mandatory arbitration rather than in court. Fox filed court papers arguing that Carlson was compelled by her contract to adjudicate her claims in arbitration. Carlson said: \"Forcing victims of sexual harassment into secret arbitration proceedings is wrong, because it means nobody finds out what really happened.\"\n\nAfter Ailes resigned on July 21, 2016, Carlson said she felt \"relief that now I would be believed,\" though she also \"felt angry that it took so long\" for Ailes to step down.\n\nOn September 6, 2016, 21st Century Fox announced that it had settled the lawsuit with Carlson. The settlement was reportedly $20 million. As part of the settlement, 21st Century Fox apologized to Carlson, saying, \"We sincerely regret and apologize for the fact that Gretchen was not treated with the respect and dignity that she and all of our colleagues deserve.\"\n\nIn April 2018, Carlson reached a first-look development deal with A&E Networks, under which she would host three documentary specials across its channels, such as Lifetime. \"Gretchen Carlson: Breaking the Silence\" focuses on the every woman story of workplace sexual harassment and premiered on Lifetime on January 14, 2019.\n\nIn December 2019, Carlson wrote an opinion article in New York Times, stating that she still cannot disclose what happened to her due to a nondisclosure agreement, but that it was her desire to be able to do so. \n\nIn 2017, Carlson released her second book, \"Be Fierce\". The book discussed cases of sexual harassment and went onto be a \"New York Times\" bestseller. She also appeared on two TED talks, one discussing women's rights and sexual harassment in the workplace, and the other discussing the hyper-partisan political times we live in and how we might come together as a nation to solve issues.\n\nOn January 1, 2018, Carlson was elected chairwoman of the board of directors of the Miss America Organization, a volunteer position. Shortly after joining as Chairwoman, Carlson's first major decision was to remove the swimsuit competition from the pageant, following a unanimous vote from the Board of Directors. It was reported in CNN that Carlson's goals were to transition the pageant into \"Miss America 2.0\", where the swimsuit competitions would be replaced with on-stage interviews. The move aimed to shift focus from appearances to achievements, in light of the recent Me Too movement.\n\nThe move divided opinion mostly within the organization. Months into her tenure as Chair of the Board of Miss America, 22 states held a vote of no confidence in the leadership of both Carlson and CEO Regina Hopper demanding their resignations, citing a lack of transparency and adherence to best practices.\n\nCalls for resignation came as several board members (according to themselves) were abruptly forced to resign. Former Miss Americas Kate Shindle and Laura Kaeppeler Fleiss listed \"toxic culture\" as their reason for departing from the board in June 2018. Former Miss North Carolina Jennifer Vaden Barth and Former Miss Maine Valerie Crooker Clemens, detailed they were forced to resign when Carlson issued a letter stating they were trying to gain control of the organization, the \"Wall Street Journal\" reported.\n\nOn August 10, 2018, 11 former Miss Americas released a statement calling for both Carlson and Hopper to resign. The former Miss Americas say that following an email scandal that resulted in the exit of the former CEO and chairman of the board Sam Haskell in December 2017, they were given the opportunity to install \"our very own sisters.\" Former titleholders assumed temporary co-chair roles on the board. From there, Carlson was supposed to head up a national search to find a new CEO. The letter continued on to say that Carlson \"selected the sole candidate for board consideration and together they have taken the organization in a direction that we do not condone.\" Hopper helped orchestrate the removal of previous leadership by leaking emails to the attention of Dick Clark Productions, which eventually dropped the organization. In August 2018, Miss America 2018 Cara Mund wrote a letter to her fellow Miss America titleholders alleging that Carlson and Hopper \"silenced me, reduced me, marginalized me, and essentially erased me in my role as Miss America.\" Mund went on to say that after the new board took over in January, she \"was given three talking points\" and told to stick to them: That \"Miss America is relevant\"; that \"the #MeToo movement started with a Miss America\"; and that both she and Carlson were graduates of elite colleges.\n\nIn early 2019, it was announced that the Miss America brand would return to NBC. The return was seen as a coup for Miss America under Carlson's leadership, as it would raise much-needed funds prior to its 100th anniversary. After securing the network deal, Carlson resigned from the pageant in June 2019.\n\nIn 2019, Carlson's career at Fox News was portrayed on the Showtime miniseries, \"The Loudest Voice\". Her role as co-anchor at Fox News was depicted by actress Naomi Watts. Watts stated in interviews that the story of Carlson was \"inspiring\" and that she dealt with multiple scenarios with \"dignity and grace.\"\n\nOther cast members included Russell Crowe as Roger Ailes, Seth MacFarlane as Brian Lewis and Sienna Miller as Beth Tilson. The fifth episode in the series portrayed the deteriorating working relationship between Carlson and Ailes from 2012 onwards. Many incidents were portrayed to the public for the first time, since Carlson was unable to speak directly about the events, due to a confidentiality clause in the settlement between her and Fox News.\n\n\"The Loudest Voice\" portrayed a number of events at Fox News which were set up by executives to discredit Carlson shortly before she left the organization. Naomi Watts spoke of one such event in an interview, where a random guest was put on her show shortly before it aired live, with the sole goal of attacking Carlson on live television.\n\nThe series aired the audio recordings taken by Carlson during her time at Fox News for the first time. The recordings were of various incidents at Fox where Carlson was sexually harassed by Ailes and other colleagues at Fox News. The show also follows the incidents leading up to Carlson reporting the sexual harassment she received. \"The Loudest Voice\" then portrayed her demotion and the events that followed her filing the internal complaint, many of which were recorded. The recordings went on to play a major part in the settlement negotiations between Carlson and Fox News.\n\n\"Bombshell\", a film portraying Carlson's career at Fox News, was released on December 13, 2019. Carlson is played by Nicole Kidman, with other cast members including Margot Robbie as Kayla Pospisil (a composite character), Charlize Theron as Megyn Kelly, and John Lithgow as Roger Ailes. The film follows events at Fox News in the run-up to Ailes resigning from the organization.\n\n\"Getting Real\" was Carlson's first book, which was released in 2015. Since the book was released prior to her leaving Fox News, the book focuses predominantly on Miss America and the challenges women face when in certain roles. During an interview with \"The National Review\", Carlson stated \"I faced negative stereotypes immediately after becoming Miss America. It was like my résumé evaporated...When people don't want to debate you on the smart issues of the day, it's just a lot easier to call you a dumb blonde from Fox.\"\n\nIn her memoir, Carlson alluded to sexism and other forms of discrimination she and others had faced. Following the Roger Ailes case, many media commentators revisited \"Getting Real\" with a fresh approach. Some stated that the book was Carlson's first steps to standing up to the harassment she had faced while working at Fox News.\n\nIn 2017, she released her second book, \"Be Fierce: Stop Harassment And Take Your Power Back\". Carlson used the publication as a platform to tell the stories of women from across the United States who had experienced sexual harassment. During interviews, women gave multiple examples of how they had been objectified by male coworkers.\n\nIn 2017, Carlson created the \"\"Gift of Courage Fund\"\" and also the Gretchen Carlson Leadership Initiative (GCLI). The GCLI partnered with All In Together, with the aim of helping individuals who had suffered from \"\"gender-based violence, discrimination, and harassment.\"\" At the time of launch, the initiative was held across thirteen cities in the United States.\n\n\"USA Today\" reported that Carlson would be donating all the proceeds from her second book to the Gift of Courage fund. In 2018, the fund also supplied the grant to create the Gretchen Carlson March of Dimes Advocacy Fellows, a program that selected 20 women from across the country to become more civically involved in promoting legislation and policies benefitting women and children.\n\nCarlson has frequently supported Miss You Can Do It, a pageant where it is \"\"more important than the contestant's outfits is what is in their hearts.\"\" Founded by Abbey Curran, a former Miss Iowa USA winner who was born with cerebral palsy, the pageant honors girls and young women who live with special needs and challenges.\n\nIn 2016, Carlson served as the pageant's MC.\n\nOn October 4, 1997, Carlson married sports agent Casey Close. They live in Greenwich, Connecticut, with their two children.\n\nShe announced on \"Fox & Friends\" on June 9, 2009, also repeated on Glenn Beck's Fox News program, that her parents' car dealership had been selected for closure as part of the General Motors reorganization and bankruptcy. A year later, the \"Star Tribune\" reported that \"It took an act of Congress, a national TV appeal and maybe a little bit of history on the owners' side, but Main Motor, the Anoka car dealership that Lee and Karen Carlson's family has owned for 91 years, will keep its General Motors dealership after all.\"\n\nDespite both having worked for Fox News, she is of no relation to commentator Tucker Carlson.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2085832", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2085832", "title": "Homeroom", "text": "Homeroom\n\nHomeroom or advisory is the classroom session in which a teacher records attendance and makes announcements. It can also be called registration or planning period. The concept is used in schools around the world.\nIn Afghanistan, the home room concept (نگران) is widely used in schools. The home room teacher is responsible for almost everything concerning their class. At the start of the school year, it's the homeroom teacher's responsibility to make sure that everyone gets their textbooks and materials, which are supplied by the government. The teacher is also responsible for recording attendance.\n\nHome room is a concept that does not exist in Argentinian schools, as a single classroom is often used for all assignments (except for lab work or outdoors exercise). Students usually stay in groups of twenty to forty for at least two years without being reshuffled, and often maintain the same grouping throughout both primary and secondary education, with only the group's room and assigned member of staff changing.\n\nTypically, Argentine schools will have a 15-30 minute \"form period\" in the morning, a one-hour period for lunch, and a similar period after lunch, albeit not all schools are required to have classes in both the morning and the afternoon. Schools (particularly private ones) will often use classes in the afternoon for secondary languages (English, French, etc.) and sports activities.\n\nStudents are usually not given much choice in the subjects they study and they all are subject to most academic subjects. The main choice a student has to make in entering secondary school is in deciding a high school that leans towards general knowledge (\"bachiller\", which encompasses arts and a general overview of science), economics (\"comercial\", whose orientation is towards math, primarily oriented towards accounting and business), engineering (\"técnico\" whose orientation is towards engineering and sciences) or pedagogical (\"normal\", whose orientation is forming elementary school teachers). Each school is given a lot of latitude in terms of extracurricular activities (teaching of secondary languages, sports, etc.).\nArgentina educational system is often in flux, as the government changes the curriculum and number of required classes every five years or so.\n\nAustralian homeroom is similar to the US concept, however it varies from school to school. Some schools do not have home room at all, and attendance and announcements are made during the first period of the school day in a \"student bulletin\", while other schools run a home room system which is identical to that run in American schools.\n\nAlternative names for home room in Australia are \"admin\" or \"administration,\" \"form-class,\" \"form-period,\" \"roll-call\" or \"DEAR\" (drop everything and read).\nMost schools, as well as having a form-class, also have an \"assembly\" which is attended by the entire population of the school. This often entails announcements, advertising for various aspects of school life and listening to or singing along with the national anthem.\n\nIn many private schools, usually Catholic schools, home room is referred to as \"PCG\" (pastoral care group) where the teacher is called a \"PCA\" (pastoral care advisor). As in Romania, a 'PCA' also performs the role of a counsellor.\n\nIn Austrian education, from lower secondary schools on, each class mostly stays in the same classroom and teachers move between the classes. Each class has a homeroom teacher (named \"Klassenvorstand\" in Austrian German, \"form teacher\" in British English). There may be special hours reserved for announcements etc., but Homeroom teachers perform such activities either during regular lesson periods, or a so-called \"Klassenvorstandsstunde“, which could roughly be translated as \"form teacher period“, which are mandatory for the students. Additionally the attendance is usually checked at the beginning of every period.\n\nIn Bangladesh a homeroom teacher, also referred to as \"class teacher\", has the duty of taking attendance records of students in a class and making any minor announcements not covered during assembly.\n\nHome room in Canadian schools follows the US model as well, but the timing of it differs depending on the school district (and, in many cases, varies by the individual school). Some schools do not have homerooms but the day is broken into 5 periods.\n\nIn China, students often do not move between classes for different lessons and have a 10-minute period in which additional home room tasks can be done. Often these tasks include the collection or distribution of homework or the cleaning of the classroom. In competitive schools, the composition of home room classes is sometimes based on ability in one or more core subjects. For example, students with a talent for science and math might be grouped together in one home room, while students with more practical or artistic skills are put together in another. In such cases, the class' home room teacher often specializes in one of the core areas used to select his or her class, in addition to provide both academic and life advice to students. There will usually also be a student elected by the others as a class monitor to assist their teachers with homeroom tasks and act as intermediary between the teachers and students.\n\nThe equivalent in France is the \"professeur(e) principal(e)\", who teaches the class in a specific subject (as do other teachers) but accepts additional duties such as distributing administrative documents, giving advice on courses to follow, acting as intermediary in cases of conflict, collating other teachers' impressions of the class and of individual students in preparation for the quarterly report, and various other tasks. For this they receive a small salary bonus.\n\nFor Germany, basically the same is true as for Austria (the teacher is called \"Klassenlehrer\"). Teachers normally do not receive a salary bonus but are expected to take classes in turn.\n\nIn India a homeroom teacher is referred to as a class teacher. A class teacher teaches his or her subject in the homeroom and takes the attendance records of students in a class and distributes administrative documents, gives advice on courses to follow, acts as intermediary in cases of conflict, collates other teachers' impressions of the class and of individual students in preparation for the quarterly report, and does various other tasks such as making small announcements regarding trips, etc.\n\nHome room in Japanese schools forms a greater part of students' lives, with home room teachers acting as a substitute parent in many ways. Students usually have the same home room teacher and fellow students during their entire life at a given school. Students are expected to take on tasks for their home room, including cleaning, day duty (note-taking and classroom organisation), and the organisation of competitive events between home room classes. Students also often eat lunch in their home room. Since teachers must usually travel to the students' home room, rather than students going to a classroom dedicated to a particular subject, the depth of lessons often suffers. Teachers must carry all materials needed for multiple classes, therefore the lessons usually end up taking on a lecture style with students simply taking notes in preparation for testing.\n\nIn Jordan, the home room concept (مربي الصف) is widely used in schools. The homeroom teacher is responsible for almost everything concerning their class. At the start of the school year, it's the homeroom teacher's responsibility to make sure that everyone gets their textbooks and materials, which are supplied by the government.\n\nIn Malaysia, most government national schools uses a homeroom system similar to the Japanese as schools and the school life of students in Malaysia have retained some form of influence from them during the Japanese Occupation. \n\nStudents in primary school often stay in the same homeroom from Standard 1 to Standard 6. In secondary school, students also stay in the same homeroom from Form 1 to 3. In Form 4-5, the students will be separated based on the streams (Science or Arts) they chose, however this may change in 2020 as the government is currently changing its education policy. However, some schools have a segregation system where better performing students get shifted to a different class (usually with better teachers) while those who perform poorly or have disciplinary issues get shifted to the more under-performing classes (naughty classes or behind classes), these classes usually have newer teachers. The performances of the students are taken from their annual examination average or overall position in the school near the end of the school year to determine their classes in the following school year. This encourages competition among the students and acts as an incentive to do well in exams while discouraging complacency among the smarter students. However there has been plans since 2018 to abolish such system, allowing equal treatment and opportunities among all the students while allowing the better performing students to help the under-performing ones. This also prevents segregation among the students and bias from the teachers.\n\nSince the students stay in the same classroom for all subjects, the teachers are the ones that have to travel to the classes, except for subjects that require the use of lab equipment, art equipment or other specialised tools. Students are also given tasks and a duty roster to clean their classroom, decorate their classrooms for events and celebrations, plan and organise events for carnival day or sports day. Most meetings are held before classes start, during the short break times between subjects or during recess. These meetings are often managed by the class monitor, assistant monitor, secretary, treasurer and other members of the class committee. Sometimes, these meetings are held with the school prefects or teachers. The schools will also have assemblies before the students go their class.\n\nA 'big assembly' is held every Monday to raise the national flag, sing the anthems and is often when the principal give important speeches or announcements, along with other teachers. This assembly is longer than the usual ones held on other days of the week, where students just gather for a short while before entering their classes. 'Small assemblies' like these are often just announcements without the principal or singing of the anthems. Sometimes prefects are the ones running these small assemblies with or without the supervision of a teacher. It gives them a chance to perform surprise spot-checks or uniform checks.\n\nThe term \"homeroom\" is hardly used, instead students use \"form teacher\" or \"guru tingkatan\" or \"主任老师\" referring to the teacher in charge of the class. Usually one teacher is assigned to one class who will manage the same class until they graduate. Since these teachers spent years with their students, many of them will return to thank their teachers and keeping in touch after graduation have never been easier since the advent of social media.\n\nIn the Netherlands, the students are put in a group which more or less stays the same during their high school career. Those groups are sorted into levels, depending on a test children take at the end of primary school and their teachers' advice. Those levels determine how long you stay in high school and what kind of school you can attend after high school. Usually, the only reason to switch groups is when you go up a level or drop a level at the end of a year, based on your grades and performance. \nThis, students always take all classes with exactly the same group, have lunch breaks at the same time, etcetera.\n\nEach group is assigned a mentor, which is a teacher who teaches a certain subject to multiple groups at every level. In the meantime, these mentors are responsible for their students well-being, grades and performance, group dynamics and more. They're also there to advice students regarding choices they have to make like, what school to go to next or what career to pick and help them with personal issues, and most of them plan a few fun activities or trips during the school year. \nAll of this has to happen during the mentor's own class, as there is no homeroom. \nHowever, some schools schedule a mentor class once a week or once a month, and most mentors make time to talk to each student once or twice in private before or after school.\n\nHome room (or \"form-class\") in New Zealand is similar to the US concept, however it varies from school to school. It's mostly used in high schools, because classes are taught by different subject teachers. Classmates in the same form class often split up for different subjects. Morning form combine form period and roll call in the morning, and a period called DEAR (\"Drop Everything and Read\"), \"SSR\", or silent sustained reading occurs after lunch. Form classes can precede the first period and take place after the school assembly.\n\nHome room in Panamanian schools is similar to the US model. However, it is not an optional period as all students are required to attend home room sessions every Monday morning (in rare cases, every day). It is called 'Consejería' (Counseling) and takes place every Monday morning as the first period. The teacher fulfills the role of a counselor (consejero), as s/he is in charge of registering attendance, collecting homework and other assignments, and make announcements. Students are expected to take on tasks for their home room including cleaning, leading morning prayer, leading classroom organization, homework and handling homework and assignments. The homeroom period may also be used for reading and writing after main activities have been fulfilled.\n\nHomeroom is practiced in all educational institutions in Romania under the name of \"Dirigenţie\", which takes its name from the title of the homeroom teacher, called \"Diriginte\". He or she also fulfills the role of a counselor.\n\nHomeroom period in Russian schools is called \"klassny chas\" (class hour). Students of the same grade (\"the parallel\") are divided into \"classes\" - groups of on average 20-30 people; this varies by school and grade. Classes are assigned letters to distinguish between them, for example, 6th grade students may be divided into 5 classes - A, B, C, D, E, and each class gets a homeroom teacher (klassny rukovoditel). This homeroom teacher schedules the homeroom period approximately once a month and uses it to make announcements and lead students in deciding various matters by voting.\n\nHomeroom periods vary between schools in Singapore. Usually homeroom periods are used for class contact time and as an opportunity to discuss what is going on around the school itself. Sometimes students go to the hall for briefing on any important events like a marathon or an exam. Most secondary schools call it Assembly or Form Teacher (FT) period, as the term \"homeroom\" is rarely used.\n\nHomeroom hour in South Korea takes a significant role in a child's education. Homeroom teachers play many roles; acting as counselors, administrators, and disciplinarians. Homeroom classes in high school are especially important as the students make their transition to college. Homeroom hour starts before first period and also after the last period, lasting between twenty and thirty minutes each time. Teachers use this time to make announcements, discipline students, and take care of other administrative duties. More importantly, teachers take this time to establish order in class. If a teacher is easygoing, the class is more likely to be disruptive. Likewise, if the teacher is strict, the class is more likely to be orderly. School administrators and staff see the homeroom classes as a reflection on the teachers. Moreover, if the class has bad test scores, it is subsequently blamed on the teacher. The homeroom teacher is responsible for pushing the students to do their best. Students often see their homeroom teachers as their role models, and often visit them in the staff room. It is also common for students to stop by to tease the teacher or ask frivolous questions. In the twelfth grade, homeroom teachers especially press the students to do well on their college entrance exams. The twelfth grade homeroom teacher is considered to be the most important teacher in the student's education. Consequently, twelfth grade teachers have a lot of work and are reluctant to take on teaching this grade. After graduating, students often come back and visit their homeroom teachers. It is customary to come with gifts or food.\n\nIn Spain, home room is basically the same as in France. There is one main teacher called \"tutor\". Some schools do have an hour a week of homeroom, being called \"tutoría\", which is usually placed in high school education.\n\nAlthough the term homeroom is not used in the United Kingdom, students are usually assigned to a tutor group or form, with a daily registration period which generally serves the same purpose as a homeroom. The groupings and activities within a tutor group vary between schools and age groups; generally speaking, primary school students remain in their form groups for the majority of the time and there is no defined 'form time'. In secondary school, registration periods (or extensions thereof, such as weekly tutorials) may be the only period a form has with their form tutor - their first point of pastoral contact within a school - and the time is often used for a variety of purposes from administration (taking the register, making announcements, university and career applications) to more general studies such as personal, social and health education.\n\nIn Scotland, the use of SEEMIS software to monitor attendance has been trialed, which may lead to more integrated period-by-period registration of pupils.\n\nIn the United States, homeroom is considered a planning period or registration. It is scheduled often at the first period of the day or it may follow the lunch break. Sometimes it can be at the end of the day after all lessons have finished; some schools have both AM and PM homerooms, in which case the later period is the time to return to the homeroom class and pack up for the day. In schools where the first period of the day is optional, homeroom may be deferred to the second period. During morning homeroom, teachers take attendance registers, may collect lunch orders, and carry out other administrative activities. Announcements may be made, correspondence distributed, and the Pledge of Allegiance recited with the right-hand-on-heart civilian salute rendered. It may be used for a period of reading, or finishing homework. In some schools, students are permitted to socialize, do group activities, watch television news or read. The home room teacher is often believed to serve a pastoral role for their students, as well as an educational one. Homerooms are sometimes also considered a free period. Homeroom rosters are often randomized by the school.\n"}

He was commissioned by the first Governor-General, Lord Hopetoun to form the inaugural Federal Government. He was unable to attract sufficient support to form a cabinet and returned the commission. The unsuccessful commissioning of Lyne is known as The Hopetoun Blunder. Lyne subsequently served as a minister in the early Protectionist governments.\n\nThe Division of Lyne was created in a redistribution in 1949 and was represented by the National Party (previously the Country Party and National Country Party) for almost 60 years. This reflects the area's history as a strongly conservative and rural region. The division covers parts of southern Port Macquarie Hastings City and almost the entire Mid-Coast Council local government areas. The area has recently undergone significant demographic changes with the arrival of a large number of retired people and city dwellers seeking a sea-change. Despite these changes the Australian Labor Party has made little headway in increasing its vote.\n\nIn 1993, after the exclusion of minor candidates, the Nationals' Mark Vaile led over the Liberals by only 233 votes on the third count. Labor had taken a large first-count lead which it held for most of the night, but Vaile won after Liberal preferences flowed overwhelmingly to him. However, had 120 votes gone the other way, the Liberals would have taken the seat. Vaile later went on to become leader of the Nationals and Deputy Prime Minister during the latter stages of the Howard Government. He retired in July 2008, triggering a by-election later that year. The seat was lost to independent candidate and former state MP Rob Oakeshott, who retained the seat at the 2010 election.\n\nOakeshott announced on 26 June 2013 that he would not contest the 2013 election. It was widely expected that the seat would revert to the Nationals; despite Oakeshott's previous personal popularity, Lyne was still a comfortably safe National seat in a \"traditional\" two-party matchup with Labor. As expected, David Gillespie, who had been Oakeshott's opponent in 2010, easily reclaimed the seat for the Nationals.\n\n"}
{"id": "2085836", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2085836", "title": "Legowelt", "text": "Legowelt\n\nLegowelt (real name Danny Wolfers) is a Dutch electronic musician who describes his musical style as \"a hybrid form of slam jack combined with deep Chicago house, romantic ghetto technofunk and EuroHorror Soundtrack.\" The majority of his work under the alias has been released on the Dutch label Bunker in addition to a number of compilation appearances, including the successful \"Disco Rout\" in 2002.\n\nAlready having spent a few years in the business, Legowelt has released a dozen or so projects on various formats, most of them on vinyl released on Bunker records, an electronic music label based in The Hague. He has had some mainstream exposure with \"Disco Rout\", originally released on a Ghostly International compilation but licensed by Cocoon Recordings for a full vinyl release, and subsequently voted track of the year 2002 by the German music magazine, \"Groove\".\n\nLegowelt began producing music in the early 1990s after he came in contact with the sounds of Detroit's Underground Resistance, Model 500, Blake Baxter (probably his all-time favourite producer) and Chicago heroes such as Farley Jackmaster Funk, Armando Gallop and Mr. Fingers. Later this palette of influences grew with early µ-Ziq, Aphex Twin, Drexciya, and various releases from the Irdial Discs label.\n\nHe marks his major influence as Unit Moebius, after he heard them on the radio. He describes their sound as \"a punky palette of RAW freaked out Lo-fi Chicago trax and deep detroit jams made with machines which were found next to the garbage can.\"\nIt was a surprise to him when he later learned that this music came out of The Hague, Holland, the same city he lived in. He later visited the Bunker Records office where he was taken under the wing of such musical mentors as I-f and Melvin White (aka pametex). He claims they \"lectured him with even more unknown sounds such as early electro and the obscure pre-1983 Italian disco whose production secrets were closely studied.\"\nIn 1998 Bunker released Legowelt's first vinyl album, \"Pimpshifter\", a 6-track which became an instant cult hit with tracks such as \"Sturmvogel\" and \"Total Pussy Control\".\nApart from producing, Legowelt has been playing live all over the world for the last five years, spending a lot of time together with Orgue Electronique and the infamous Bunker Team.\n\nSome aliases and side projects he has are Catnip (with Luke Eargoggle), The Chicago Shags (with Orgue Electronique), Gladio, Smackos, Smackulator (with Speculator), Squadra Blanco, Salamandos, Raheem Hershel and Venom 18.\nMost of the music of Danny Wolfers is published by Clone Publishing from Rotterdam. Clone also co-released Legowelt's greatest hits album together with Bunker records. In 2006 Legowelt started his own label called Strange life records.\n\nDanny Wolfers is the host of the weekly \"Astro Unicorn Radio Show\" on Intergalactic FM, an internet radio station. He presents the show using his Smackos alias, and plays a broad range of music including many of his own productions. It was in 2007 that Wolfers started hosting this show on the Cybernetic Broadcasting System, the predecessor of Intergalactic FM.\n\nSpace Force (Cass) M.O.C. 1996\nReports From The Backseat Pimp (CDr, Ltd) Goldcoast 1998\nPimpshifter (12\") Bunker Records 2000 \nWirtschaftswunder (12\") Bunker Records 2000 \nKaihoisa Pt.2 (7\") Eat This Records 2001 \nDisco Rout (12\") Cocoon Recordings 2002 \nKlaus Kinski EP (12\") Bunker Records 2002 \nStarcruiser (10\") Kapellmeister Grammofon 2002 \nTracks From The Tube (12\") Stilleben Records 2002 \nClassics 1998–2003 (CD) Clone 2003 \nClassics 1998–2003: A Selection of Tracks From The Archive Bunker (2xLP) Bunker Records 2003 \nReports From The Backseat Pimp (LP) Crème Organization, Goldcoast 2003 \nTower of the Gipsies (12\") Bunker Records 2003 \nDark Days (CDr) Strange Life Records 2004 \nUnder The Panda Moon (12\") Crème Organization 2004 \nBeyond The Congo (12\") Bunker Records 2005 \nAstro Cat Disco (File, MP3) Clone 2006 \nThe Land of Lonzo (12\") Strange Life Records 2006 \nDark Days 2 (CDr) Strange Life Records 2008 \nThe Rise And Fall of Manuel Noriega (CDr) Strange Life Records 2008 \nAmiga Railroad Adventures (CDr) Strange Life Records 2009 \nThe Liechtenstein Account (5xFile) Open Concept Recording 2009 \nNarrominded Split LP No. 4 (LP) Narrominded 2009 \nVatos Locos (12\") Crème Organization 2009 \nSlompy Jitt EP (12\") M>O>S> Recordings 2009 \nBayville Cove (12\") Clone West Coast Series 2010 \nGardens of the Ghetto (12\") Crème Organization 2010 \nSark Island Acid EP (12\") Long Island Electrical Systems 2011 \nMoves For CeeCee (12\") Clone Store Only Series 2011 \nThe Teac Life (MP3, Album) Self-Released 2011 \nPoverties Paradise EP (12\") Echovolt Records 2011 \nThe Paranormal Soul (CD & 12\") Clone 2012 \nCrystal Cult 2080 (CD, MP3, 12\", Cass, Album) Crème Organization 2012 \nLegendary Freaks in the Trash of Time (CD & 12\") Clone 2017\n\nRaginakudo Parto Een (12\") NN (Legowelt Remix) Eat This Records 1999 \nFwd: Dedication (12\" + CD) Transit (Legowelt Remix) Eat This Records 2000 \nThe Synthesizer Greatest Vol. 1 (12\") White BMW (Legowelt Re...

It was created to compete with the \"New York Daily News\" which was then a sensationalist tabloid and the most widely circulated newspaper in the United States. Hearst preferred the broadsheet format and sold the \"Mirror\" to an associate in 1928, only to buy it back in 1932.\n\nHearst hired away the Daily News's Philip Payne as managing editor of Mirror. Payne's circulation building stunts ranged from reviving the sensational Hall-Mills murder case to sponsoring and being a passenger on the \"Old Glory\" transatlantic flying record attempt, in which he was killed. Early on, several bright young writers and photographic journalists joined the \"Daily Mirror\", such as Ring Lardner, Jr., Hy Peskin and the political commentator Drew Pearson. The poet-songwriter Nick Kenny was the paper's radio editor, and Edward Zeltner contributed a column. The gossip columnist Walter Winchell and managing editor Emile Gauvreau were both hired away from the \"New York Evening Graphic\", the city's third sensational tabloid. Winchell was given his own radio show and syndicated, in his prime—the 1940s and early 1950s—in more than 2000 daily papers.\n\nDuring the three tabloids' 1920s circulation war, management of the \"Mirror\" estimated that its content was 10% news and 90% entertainment. For example, the \"Mirror\" and \"Graphic\" both had devoted substantial resources to the exploitation of scandal with repeated stories on such events as the divorce trial of real estate tycoon Edward West \"Daddy\" Browning who at age 51 had married 16-year-old Frances Belle \"Peaches\" Heenan, as well as constant coverage of the decade's celebrities like Rudolph Valentino, Babe Ruth and Charles A. Lindbergh. \nBy the 1930s, the \"Daily Mirror\" was one of the Hearst Corporation's largest papers in terms of circulation. However, the paper never became a significantly profitable property as its earnings were mostly destined to support the company's faltering afternoon papers, and in its later years it declined substantially despite numerous efforts to turn things around.\n\nDespite having the second-highest daily circulation of an American newspaper at the time, the \"Daily Mirror\" closed in 1963, after the 114-day 1962–63 New York City newspaper strike. The Great Newspaper Strike of 1962-63 also contributed to the death of the Herald-Tribune, the Journal-American and the World-Telegram Sun. On Oct. 16, 1963, the \"Daily Mirror\" published its last issue. The \"Daily Mirror\" name rights were at that point acquired by its rival the \"Daily News\". \n\nOn January 4, 1971, publisher Robert W. Farrell revived the \"New York Daily Mirror\" in name only, as a tabloid, published in Long Island City, Queens. Operating on a shoestring budget, the paper faced obstruction from the \"Daily News\" (from whom it had acquired the \"Daily Mirror\" name rights after the \"Daily News\" let them lapse). This new iteration of the \"Daily Mirror\" ceased publication on February 28, 1972.\n\n\n"}

Although they had existed in a different incarnation since the very early 1990s, the band's classic line-up consisted of Andrew Caldwell (vocals), Paul Carroll (bass), Eric Lindsay (guitar) and Stuart Smith (drums). The name came from a slang term for the disorientating effects of alcohol. They were the first guitar band to sign to the Silvertone label after their enormous success with the Stone Roses. Whiteout's principal recordings were the albums \"Bite It\" (1995) and \"Big Wow\" (1998). Their music was influenced by the country rock and glam rock of the early 1970s, as well as the aforementioned Stone Roses.\n\nWhiteout achieved minor success during the Britpop era in the UK, co-headlining a tour with Oasis and supported The Charlatans and Pulp. They opened both the Glasgow Sound City event and the Phoenix festival in 1994 before releasing their second single, \"Starrclub\" (which included the line, \"Look at me, i'm on TV\"). The singles \"Detroit\" and \"Jackie's Racing\" followed and the group began to achieve a growing reputation in Japan.\n\nOn 11 October 1994 Whiteout performed at BBC Radio 1's \"Peel Sessions\". They played four songs: \"Everyday\", \"Time and Again\", \"Get Me Through\", and \"Higher\".\n\nAndrew Caldwell left the group in 1996, after \"Bite It\" (replaced briefly by Warren McIntyre) and by the time the (now three piece of Carroll, Lindsay & McDermott) band reemerged with their second album \"Big Wow\" in 1998 (The last track of which included the refrain \"We'll all go down in history\") it was to a largely dismissive reception from the music media. Original drummer Mark Fairhurst ('Fudge') had replaced McDermott on drums in 1997, appearing on two of \"Big Wow\"'s tracks, but Whiteout split soon after, around 1999, shortly after becoming a 4-piece again with Eric Russell on keys.\n\nThe only recorded material since has come from Eric Lindsay's outfit 'Eli', and the album 'Dreams Are The Foundations of Reality' (2009), though there have been brief outings by combinations of Lindsay, Carroll and Russell since the split in various acoustic and electric incarnations. Eric can currently be found playing guitar with ex-Superstar frontman Joe McAlinden's band Linden.\n\n"}

T. Bell (1883–1960). After a brief chapter on three ancient mathematicians, it covers the lives of about forty mathematicians who flourished in the seventeenth through nineteenth centuries. The book is illustrated by mathematical discussions, with emphasis on mainstream mathematics.\n\nTo keep the interest of readers, the book typically focuses on unusual or dramatic aspects of its subjects' lives. \"Men of Mathematics\" has inspired many young people, including the young John Forbes Nash Jr. and Freeman Dyson, to become mathematicians. It is not intended as a rigorous history, includes many anecdotal accounts, and presents a somewhat idealised picture of mathematicians, their personalities, research and controversies.\n\nIn July 1935, Bell signed a contract with Simon and Schuster, for a book to be titled \"The Lives of Mathematicians\". He delivered the manuscript at the beginning of November 1935 as promised, but was unhappy when the publishers made him cut about a third of it (125,000 words), and, in order to tie in with their book \"Men of Art\" (by Thomas Craven), gave it the title \"Men of Mathematics\" which he did not like. He was also unhappy with how long they took to print it: even before he had received his first printed copy in March 1937, he had written and got into print another book, \"The Handmaiden of the Sciences\".\n\n (1850–1891)\nIn the opinion of Ivor Grattan-Guinness the mathematics profession was poorly served by Bell's book:\n\nEric Bell was criticized in 1983 for incorrectly ascribing the origin of spacetime to Joseph Lagrange:\n\nIn reviewing the faculty that served with Harry Bateman at Caltech, Clifford Truesdell wrote:\n\nAn impression of the book was given by Rebecca Goldstein in her novel \"36 Arguments for the Existence of God\".

Among Withnall's votes as an elected member included voting against the abolition of capital punishment and opposing women jurors, stating that the latter would happen \"over my dead body\".\n\nAs a Member of the Legislative Council, Withnall made a name for himself as a fierce advocate of self-determination, and took part in the campaign which ultimately led to the creation of the Assembly in 1974. He ran as an independent in the seat of Port Darwin in the first elections, and ultimately became one of only two non-Country Liberal Party members (the other being fellow independent Dawn Lawrie) in the first Assembly. However, he was to only serve one term in the Assembly, and was replaced by the Country Liberal Party's Tom Harris.\n\nWithnall died in late 1990, and several condolence motions were presented in the Assembly upon his death. Shane Stone, in his introductory speech upon his election to the Port Darwin electorate in 1990, referred to Withnall as a \"fearless and uncompromising advocate of self-government and statehood for the Territory\". In 1994, then-Chief Minister Marshall Perron also praised Withnall's role in the Territory's achievement of self-governance.

The parish includes the hamlet of Tanis.\n\nThe village now mainly consists of modern brick-built houses, but a number of 17th-century buildings still remain in the centre of the village, including the \"George & Dragon\" public house. This was pre-dated in the village by another pub, a timber framed and thatched building that was destroyed by fire in 1938; a replacement, the \"Cross Keys\" now stands in its place.\n\nOn the outskirts of Rowde are the Caen Hill flight of locks of the Kennet and Avon Canal. The canal rises 237 feet by means of 29 locks, 16 of them in a straight line at Caen Hill. The canal was constructed between 1794 and 1810 and served to link Devizes with Bristol and London. It fell into disuse after the coming of the railway but has been restored, and is now used for leisure purposes.\n\nThe small unsignposted hamlet of Rowde Hill, consisting of around 10 houses, lies around west of the village towards Sells Green and Melksham, at the junction of The Common and Berhills Lane.\n\nThe parish has a village hall, built in 1887 as Rowde Reading Room and Coffee Tavern.\n\nRowde C of E Primary Academy serves Rowde and nearby villages. Built in 2006, it replaced a school in Marsh Lane which was built in 1841 and extended in 1907. Rowdeford School, to the north of the village, is a Special Needs school built around a country house of 1812.\n\nThe Church of England parish church is dedicated to St. Matthew and has a 15th-century tower, the rest having been rebuilt in 1832–3 to designs of Henry Goodridge. It has a font designed in 1850 by Sir Matthew Digby Wyatt, architect, who was born in Rowde and lived for a time at Rowdeford House (now the home of Rowdeford School). The six bells in the tower were cast in 1870 by John Taylor & Co. The building was Grade II* listed in 1962. Today the parish is part of the Rowde and Bromham benefice, which also covers Sandy Lane.\n\nRowde is a civil parish with an elected parish council. It is in the area of the Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which is responsible for all significant local government functions. In the 2001 census, the district ward of Bromham & Rowde had a population of 2,880 persons.\n\nThe Devizes Branch Line was built through the parish in 1857 and a small station – Bromham and Rowde Halt – was added in 1909 at Sells Green, to the west just outside the parish. The line was closed in 1966.\n\n"}
{"id": "2085900", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2085900", "title": "Chimera Beast", "text": "Chimera Beast\n\nChimera Beast is an unreleased coin-operated arcade video game developed by C.P. Brain and planned to be released by Jaleco in 1993. It is a scrolling shooter with primarily horizontal movement.\n\n\"Chimera Beast\" takes place on a planet which is described as distant and Earth-like. The planet is overrun by monsters known as \"eaters\", capable of eating other creatures and acquiring their abilities or characteristics. The player controls one of these eaters and progresses through the game by means of the food chain, consuming microscopic organisms in the first stage, fish in the second, and so on. When the player's creature gets big enough to take on humanity, the goal of the game is revealed. The planet's humans have developed space travel, which the player must thwart, so as not to give the eaters a means of escaping the planet. There are two possible endings: one in which the player is able to stop the eaters from escaping the planet, and one in which the eaters do escape and, we are told, eventually make their way to Earth.\n\nThe chief innovation of \"Chimera Beast\" is its power-up system. Instead of collecting gun upgrades as in most games of this genre, the player's eater enhances itself by eating other creatures and assuming their abilities and defenses. Instead of simply having various types of projectile weaponry, the game attempts to make these new abilities as varied as possible. Consuming a crustacean might give the player's eater a hard protective shell, for example, while an insectoid creature might offer a venomous tail instead. The game even includes the ability to use cancer as a weapon.\n\nAnother difference from typical shooter mechanics is that the player's eater does not die after being hit. It has a life bar, which can be charged by consuming enemies. It is even possible to eat enough to charge the life bar past its starting position, creating a larger eater which is not only more powerful but can take more damage as well.\n\nThe enemies in \"Chimera Beast\" are mostly animals, some with equivalent Earth versions and some without. Some of the enemy creatures include jellyfish, a lamprey, clownfish, clams, flying squirrels, and moles. Once the player reaches the human stage, they face war vehicles such as tanks and jets.\n\n\"Chimera Beast\" runs on dual 68000 processors. Sound is provided by a Ym2151 and dual OKI-M6295 chips. Like most games of its time, it uses a standard JAMMA connector. The game uses the Jaleco Mega System 1 Hardware.\n\n"}

Introduced in 2002, the Arena is the only form of pickup by Proton, and is the only Proton model to enjoy significantly more popularity in its export market than domestically.\n\nThe suspension configuration of the Arena consists of a combination of independent MacPherson strut suspensions from a saloon car at the front, and torsion beam, leaf sprung suspensions at the rear. Other modifications include the use of a rigid rear axle, an uprated front stabiliser bar, and 14\" front ventilated discs and 9\" rear drum brakes with load sensing proportioning valves (LSPV), optimised weight distribution and the use of reinforced high profile tyres. Lotus Engineering provided additional ride and handling enhancements.\n\nSimilar to the car it is based on, the Arena is powered by a 1.5-litre, 12-valve Electronically Fuel Injected (EFI) Mitsubishi 4G15 engine fitted with Proton's proprietary EMS 400 engine management system. The Arena was proclaimed to have met Europe's Euro 2 emission standards, and was also claimed to provide a good power-and-fuel efficiency balance by producing an output of per litre and a power-to-weight ratio of per tonne. While the engine offers a respectable fuel consumption rating (5.8-litre per 100 km on the highway and 8.5-litre per 100 km in the city), it struggles under heavy loads.\n\nThe Arena is based largely on Proton's Wira/Persona saloon, sharing similar frontal designs of the then current Wira and mechanics, but having a reduced seating capacity of two confined to a Wira-based cabin and featuring a rear cargo bed measuring x x with a maximum payload of and a maximum load area of x .\n\nIn Malaysia, the Arena is offered in three variants, which features a variety of cargo bed accessories and trims but does not vary mechanically from the export edition:\n\n\nIn Australia, the Jumbuck was available in two variants, GLi and GLSi.\n\nLike the Wira, the Arena is of unibody construction, but in order to sustain additional loads from the cargo bed, the Arena includes a load-bearing ladder frame connected to a \"torque box\" for improved body durability and strength.\n\nWhile freely sold in Malaysia, no stringent third-party safety tests on the Arena were conducted or published publicly in the country. In September 2009, the Jumbuck was crash tested by the Australasian New Car Assessment Program (ANCAP). The Jumbuck fared poorly, receiving a one-star rating out of five. The Jumbuck lacks many of the safety features offered in other modern automobiles, such as airbags and anti-lock brakes. The absence of such safety features in an attempt to lower retail pricing is suspected to be one factor for the one-star crash test result. Proton Cars Australia has criticised the choice of the Jumbuck for the test, arguing the vehicle is the last of an old platform and is due for a replacement in the middle of 2010.\n\nIn Malaysia, the Arena was often marketed for both commercial and recreational use. The stripped down Freestyle variant was specified to be targeted exclusively for a variety of commercial interests, while the Sportdeck variant was offered for both private owners and businesses. The Fastback variant, the top-of-the-line Arena, was targeted at private owners. While the three Arena variants were advertised as models for specialised tasks, all three models may be used in any way.\n\nAlthough the Arena was offered in Malaysia, the Arena was not popular in the local market and was mostly an export model (particularly to the United Kingdom, Australia and South Africa, where coupé utilities are more marketable).\n\nThe Jumbuck remains a relevant model more than a decade after its British launch. Of the estimated 1,800 units registered between 2003 and 2006 in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, over 1,300 units remain licensed as of Q3 2015, with a further 153 units on SORN. Over 80% of all Proton Jumbucks sold in the U.K. are still on the roads.\n\n"}

The saccule and utricle, in turn, together make the \"otolith organs\". These organs are what allows an organism, including humans, to perceive linear acceleration, both horizontally and vertically (gravity). They have been identified in both extinct and extant vertebrates.\n\nCounting the annual growth rings on the otoliths is a common technique in estimating the age of fish.\n\nEndolymphatic infillings such as otoliths are structures in the saccule and utricle of the inner ear, specifically in the vestibular labyrinth of all vertebrates (fish, amphibians, reptiles, mammals and birds). In vertebrates, the saccule and utricle together make the \"otolith organs\". Both statoconia and otoliths are used as gravity, balance, movement, and directional indicators in all vertebrates and have a secondary function in sound detection in higher aquatic and terrestrial vertebrates. They are sensitive to gravity and linear acceleration. Because of their orientation in the head, the utricle is sensitive to a change in horizontal movement, and the saccule gives information about vertical acceleration (such as when in an elevator).\n\nSimilar balance receptors called statocysts can be found in many invertebrate groups but are not contained in the structure of an inner ear. Mollusk statocysts are of a similar morphology to the displacement-sensitive organs of vertebrates; however, the function of the mollusk statocyst is restricted to gravity detection and possibly some detection of angular momentum. These are analogous structures, with similar form and function but not descended from a common structure.\n\nStatoconia (also called otoconia) are numerous grains, often spherical in shape, between 1 and 50 µm; collectively. Statoconia are also sometimes termed a statocyst. Otoliths (also called statoliths) are agglutinated crystals or crystals precipitated around a nucleus, with well defined morphology and together all may be termed endolymphatic infillings.\n\nThe semicircular canals and sacs in all vertebrates are attached to endolymphatic ducts, which in some groups (such as sharks) end in small openings, called endolymphatic pores, on the dorsal surface of the head. Extrinsic grains may enter through these openings, typically less than a millimeter in diameter. The size of material that enters is limited to sand-sized particles and in the case of sharks is bound together with an endogenous\norganic matrix that the animal secretes.\n\nIn mammals, otoliths are small particles, composed of a combination of a gelatinous matrix and calcium carbonate in the viscous fluid of the saccule and utricle. The inertia of these small particles causes them to stimulate hair cells when the head moves. The hair cells are made up of 40 to 70 stereocilia and one kinocilium, which is connected to an afferent nerve. When the body changes position or begins a movement, the weight of the membrane bends the stereocilia and stimulates the hair cells. Hair cells send signals down sensory nerve fibers, which are interpreted by the brain as motion. The brain interprets the orientation of the head by comparing the input from the utricles and saccules from both ears to the input from the eyes, allowing the brain to discriminate a tilted head from the movement of the entire body. When the head is in a normal upright position, the otolith presses on the sensory hair cell receptors. This pushes the hair cell processes down and prevents them from moving side to side. However, when the head is tilted, the pull of gravity on otoliths shift the hair cell processes to the side, distorting them and sending a message to the central nervous system that the head is no longer level but now tilted. (see: Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo) This theory may have to be reevaluated because of an experiment in which a blindfolded owl in zero gravity was able to keep its head level while a handler was rocking its body back and forth.\n\nThere is evidence that the vestibular system of mammals has retained some of its ancestral acoustic sensitivity and that this sensitivity is mediated by the otolithic organs (most likely the sacculus, due to its anatomical location). In mice lacking the otoconia of the utricle and saccule, this retained acoustic sensitivity is lost. In humans vestibular evoked myogenic potentials occur in response to loud, low-frequency acoustic stimulation in patients with the sensorineural hearing loss. Vestibular sensitivity to ultrasonic sounds has also been hypothesized to be involved in the perception of speech presented at artificially high frequencies, above the range of the human cochlea (~18 kHz). In mice, sensation of acoustic information via the vestibular system has been demonstrated to have a behaviourally relevant effect; response to an elicited acoustic startle reflex is larger in the presence of loud, low frequency sounds that are below the threshold for the mouse cochlea (~4 Hz), raising the possibility that the acoustic sensitivity of the vestibular system may extend the hearing range of small mammals.\n\nAfter the death and decomposition of a fish, otoliths may be preserved within the body of an organism or be dispersed before burial and fossilization. Dispersed otoliths are one of the many microfossils which can be found through a micropalaeontological analysis of a fine sediment. Their stratigraphic significance is minimal, but can still be used to characterize a level or interval. Fossil otoliths are rarely found \"in situ\" (on the remains of the animal), likely because they are not recognized separately from the surrounding rock matrix. In some cases, due to differences in colour, grain size, or a distinctive shape, they can be identified. These rare cases are of special significance, since the presence, composition, and morphology of the material can clarify the relationship of species and groups. In the case of primitive fish, various fossil material shows that endolymphatic infillings were similar in elemental composition to the rock matrix but were restricted to coarse grained material, which presumably is better for the detection of gravity, displacement, and sound. The presence of these extrinsic grains, in osteostracans, chondrichthyans, and acanthodians indicates a common inner ear physiology and presence of open endolymphatic ducts.\n\nThe composition of fish otoliths is also proving useful to fisheries scientists. The calcium carbonate that the otolith is composed of is primarily derived from the water. As the otolith grows, new calcium carbonate crystals form. As with any crystal structure, lattice vacancies will exist during crystal formation allowing trace elements from the water to bind with the otolith. Studying the trace elemental composition or isotopic signatures of trace elements within a fish otolith gives insight to the water bodies fish have previously occupied. Fish otoliths as old as 172 million years have been used to study the environment in which the fish lived. Robotic micromilling devices have also been used to recover very high resolution records of life history, including diet and temperatures throughout the life of the fish, as well as their natal origin.\n\nThe most studied trace and isotopic signatures are strontium due to the same charge and similar ionic radius to calcium; however, scientists can study multiple trace elements within an otolith to discriminate more specific signatures. A common tool used to measure trace elements in an otolith is a laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer. This tool can measure a variety of trace elements simultaneously. A secondary ion mass spectrometer can also be used. This instrument can allow for greater chemical resolution but can only measure one trace element at a time. The hope of this research is to provide scientists with valuable information on where fish have traveled. Combined with otolith annuli, scientists can add how old fish were when they traveled through different water bodies. All this information can be used to determine fish life cycles so that fisheries scientists can make better informed decisions about fish stocks.\n\nFinfish (class Osteichthyes) have three pairs of otoliths – the sagittae (singular sagitta), lapilli (singular lapillus), and asterisci (singular asteriscus). The sagittae are largest, found just behind the eyes and approximately level with them vertically. The lapilli and asterisci (smallest of the three) are located within the semicircular canals. The sagittae are normally composed of aragonite (although vaterite abnormalities can occur), as are the lapilli, while the asterisci are normally composed of vaterite.\n\nThe shapes and proportional sizes of the otoliths vary with fish species. In general, fish from highly structured habitats such as reefs or rocky bottoms (e.g. snappers, groupers, many drums and croakers) will have larger otoliths than fish that spend most of their time swimming at high speed in straight lines in the open ocean (e.g. tuna, mackerel, dolphinfish). Flying fish have unusually large otoliths, possibly due to their need for balance when launching themselves out of the water to \"fly\" in the air. Often, the fish species can be identified from distinct morphological characteristics of an isolated otolith.\n\nFish otoliths accrete layers of calcium carbonate and gelatinous matrix throughout their lives. The accretion rate varies with growth of the fish – often less growth in winter and more in summer – which results in the appearance of rings that resemble tree rings. By counting the rings, it is possible to determine the age of the fish in years. Typically the sagitta is used, as it is largest, but sometimes lapilli are used if they have a more convenient shape. The asteriscus, which is smallest of the three, is rarely used in age and growth studies.\n\nIn addition, in most species the accretion of calcium carbonate and gelatinous matrix alternates on a daily cycle. It is therefore also possible to determine fish age in days. This latter information is often obtained under a microscope, and provides significant data to early life history studies.\n\nBy measuring the thickness of individual rings, it has been assumed (at least in some species) to estimate fish growth because fish growth is directly proportional to otolith growth. However, some studies disprove a direct link between body growth and otolith growth. At times of lower or zero body growth the otolith continues to accrete leading some researchers to believe the direct link is to metabolism, not growth per se. Otoliths, unlike scales, do not reabsorb during times of decreased energy making it even more useful tool to age a fish. Fish never stop growing entirely, though growth rate in mature fish is reduced. Rings corresponding to later parts of the life cycle tend to be closer together as a result. Furthermore, a small percentage of otoliths in some species bear deformities over time. \n\nAge and growth studies of fish are important for understanding such things as timing and magnitude of spawning, recruitment and habitat use, larval and juvenile duration, and population age structure. Such knowledge is in turn important for designing appropriate fisheries management policies.\n\nSince the compounds in fish otoliths are resistant to digestion, they are found in the digestive tracts and scats of seabirds and piscivorous marine mammals, such as dolphins, seals, sea lions and walruses. Many fish can be identified to genus and species by their sagittal otoliths. Otoliths can therefore, to some extent, be used to reconstruct the prey composition of marine mammal and seabird diets.\n\nSagittal otoliths (sagittae) are bilaterally symmetrical, with each fish having one right and one left. Separating recovered otoliths into right and left, therefore, allows one to infer a minimum number of prey individuals ingested for a given fish species. Otolith size is also proportional to the length and weight of a fish. They can therefore be used to back-calculate prey size and biomass, useful when trying to estimate marine mammal prey consumption, and potential impacts on fish stocks.\n\nOtoliths cannot be used alone to reliably estimate cetacean or pinniped diets, however. They may suffer partial or complete erosion in the digestive tract, skewing measurements of prey number and biomass. Species with fragile, easily digested otoliths may be underestimated in the diet. To address these biases, otolith correction factors have been developed through captive feeding experiments, in which seals are fed fish of known size, and the degree of otolith erosion is quantified for different prey taxa.\n\nThe inclusion of fish vertebrae, jaw bones, teeth, and other informative skeletal elements improves prey identification and quantification over otolith analysis alone. This is especially true for fish species with fragile otoliths, but other distinctive bones, such as Atlantic mackerel (\"Scomber scombrus\"), and Atlantic herring (\"Clupea harengus\").\n\n\n"}

The Latvian Foreign Minister had met with Pilsudski in Vilnius (then Wilno in Polish) in October 1919, and asked for assistance at Dunaburg. The Poles wanted to prevent the Soviet XVth and XVIth armies from consolidating at this juncture, and readily agreed. A final agreement was reached on 30 December 1919, and a military alliance was signed between the governments of Poland and Latvia.\n\nGeneral Rydz-Śmigły was given the command over a small Operational Group composed of his 1st Legions Infantry Division, as well as the 3rd Legions Infantry Division and several minor Latvian auxiliary forces.

{"id": "2085977", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2085977", "title": "PLDT", "text": "PLDT\n\nPLDT, Inc., formerly known as the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (), is a telecommunications, internet, and digital service holdings company in the Philippines. It is one of the country's major telecommunications providers, along with Globe Telecom. Founded in 1928, it is the oldest and largest telecom company in the Philippines, in terms of assets and revenues.\n\nIts core businesses are fixed-line telecommunications, mobile telephony services, broadband, and internet of things services under various brands. It also has investments in broadcasting, print media, utilities, and direct-to-home satellite services, among others. As of 2019, PLDT is listed in the Philippine Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange (the only Philippine company to be listed in NYSE) and it is being controlled by First Pacific, a Hong Kong-based investment management company; Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, through its subsidiaries; and JG Summit, a major conglomerate that operates airliner Cebu Pacific and food manufacturer Universal Robina.\n\nPLDT was established on November 28, 1928, by a Philippine Government act. Philippine legislature and approved by then Governor-General Henry L. Stimson by means of a merger of four telephone companies under operation of the American telephone company GTE. Known as Act 3436, the bill granted PLDT a 50-year charter and the right to establish a Philippine telephone network linking major points nationwide. However, PLDT had to meet a 40-day deadline to start implementing the network, which would be implemented over a period of one to four years.\n\nBy the 1930s, PLDT had an expansive fixed-line network and for the first time linked the Philippines to the outside world via radiotelephone services, connecting the Philippines to the United States and other parts of the world.\n\nTelephone service in the Philippines was interrupted due to World War II. At the end of the war, the Philippines' communications infrastructure was in ruins. U.S. military authorities eventually handed over the remains of the communications infrastructure to PLDT in 1947, and with the help of massive U.S. aid to the Philippines during the 1940s and 1950s, PLDT recovered so quickly that its telephone subscribers outpaced that of pre-war levels by 1953.\n\nOn December 20, 1967, a group of Filipino entrepreneurs and businessmen led by Ramon Cojuangco took control of PLDT after buying its shares from the American telecommunications company GTE. The group took control of PLDT's management on January 1, 1968, with the election of Gregorio S. Licaros and Cojuangco as chairman and president of PLDT, respectively. A few months later, PLDT's main office in Makati (known today as the Ramon Cojuangco Building) was opened, and PLDT's expansion programs begin, hoping to bring reliable telephone services to the rural areas. It was also during that time that PLDT was able to use Intelsat II F-4 communications satellite to beam international events such as the Apollo 8 mission and the funeral of Robert F. Kennedy in 1968.\n\nPLDT was permitted to operate during Martial Law. During the 1970s, PLDT was nationalized by the government of then-President Ferdinand Marcos and in 1981, in compliance of then existing policy of the Philippine government to integrate the Philippine telecommunications industry, purchased substantially all of the assets and liabilities of Republic Telephone Company, becoming the country's telephone monopoly. Under this monopoly, service expansion were severely curtailed or practically nonexistent. In the Martial Law years people would apply for phone service only to wait for years and years on end behind an impossibly long application backlog. It is not unheard of for people and small businesses back then to barter for a single telephone line in the black market for tens of thousands of pesos. The incumbent Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew referred to the situation when visiting the Philippines during the term of President Fidel V. Ramos. He said, albeit in jest, “In the Philippines 95% of the population has no telephone, while the remaining 5% are waiting for that dial tone.”\n\nAfter President Marcos was overthrown in 1986, the company was re-privatized and Cojuangco's son, Antonio \"Tonyboy\" O. Cojuangco, Jr. became chief executive. By 1995, with the passage of the Telecommunications Act and the subsequent deregulation of the Philippine telecommunications industry, the company has been de-monopolized. \n\nIn 1992, PLDT partnered with AT&T Corporation to expand its services into rural communities; including USA Direct Roving Van Service, a mobile van equipped with cellular phones, to provide toll service to some previously unserved rural communities; point-to-point international digital leased line service; payphone services; and magnetic prepaid telephone cards. By 1997, the company, through Mabuhay Satellite Corporation, launched the Philippines' first local communications satellite Agila II (It was later divested to Asia Broadcast Satellite in 2009).\n\nIn 1998, Hong Kong-based First Pacific Company Ltd. acquired a 17.5% controlling stake in PLDT for approximately P29.7 billion. Following the acquisition by the First Pacific group, Manuel V. Pangilinan became the new president and CEO of PLDT, replacing Cojuangco, who assumed the post of Chairman until 2004. An additional investment was added in 2000 through a share-swap agreement; where NTT Communications, a subsidiary of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, acquired a share in PLDT in exchange for its co-owned wireless telecom company Smart Communications.\n\nPLDT acquired 51.55% of the shares of Digital Telecommunications Philippines from JG Summit Holdings in March 2011 with the cost of ₱69.2 Billion. Because of this, the shares of Digitel and JG Summit in the PSE surges while PLDT's shares remained unchanged. In the deal, JG Summit will have a 12% share in PLDT. It was finalized by the National Telecommunications Commission on October 26, 2011. In exchange of the transaction, PLDT's subsidiary Smart Communications surrendered the mobile frequency and spectrum being used by its service Red Mobile to the government, which was finalized in 2016.\n\nIn April 2016, the company, then known as the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company, dropped the \"long distance telephone\" from its corporate name and was renamed PLDT Inc. Its board of directors approved the new corporate name to reflect on the company's new range of services, mainly focusing on data services. On June 13, 2016, PLDT and its subsidiary Smart unveiled their new logos and identity as part of the company's continuing digital pivot.\n\nPLDT's fixed line business offers services intended for enterprises, small and medium enterprises, and corporate consumers - including corporate data, ICT solutions, data networking, and cybersecurity solutions. PLDT also offers local exchange telephone services for Subic Bay Freeport, Clark Freeport Zone, Bonifacio Global City, and selected cities in Mindanao through its subsidiaries.\n\nPLDT's retail fixed line services are branded under PLDT Home brand. It offers home broadband, IPTV, and triple play packages with devices from TP-Link and Roku.\n\nPLDT operates its wireless cellular services through its brands, namely Smart, TNT, and Sun Cellular.\n\nSmart, its flagship brand, offers commercial wireless services through its 2G, 3G, 3.5G HSPA+, and 4G LTE networks, with LTE-A and 5G currently being tested and deployed in key areas in the Philippines. Smart also offers terrestrial satellite communication services and wireless complimentary offerings.\n\nTNT provides a wide range of offerings in low-cost call, text, and mobile internet packages, as well as other value-added services. Sun Cellular, on the other hand, offers unlimited call, text and internet data services.\n\nPLDT currently invests in media through Pilipinas Global Network and MediaQuest Holdings, funded through its Beneficial Trust Fund. MediaQuest's assets include broadcasting firms TV5 Network and Nation Broadcasting Corporation, direct-to-home satellite operator Cignal TV, and major newspaper companies The Philippine Star and BusinessWorld, among others. \n\nPLDT also has investments in energy utility (Meralco, through PLDT Communication and Energy Ventures), business jet transportation (Pacific Global One Aviation Company), and e-commerce and financial technology development (Voyager Innovations), among others.\n\nThe Company's ownership is divided among the public (53.86%), Philippine Telephone Investments Corporation (12.05%), Metro Pacific Resources, Inc. (9.98%); non-Philippine subsidiaries of First Pacific Company Limited (25.6%), NTT DoCoMo, Inc. (14.5%), NTT Communications Corp. (5.85%) and Manuel V. Pangilinan (0.11%).\n\nIn October 2015, PLDT introduced so-called \"volume boosters\" (instead of 30% bandwidth throttling in 2014 and 256kbit/s bandwidth throttling in 2015) when exceeding monthly 30GB to 70GB bandwidth cap for TD-LTE connection plans (Ultera). \"In case your usage exceeds your monthly volume allowance, you can still enjoy the internet by purchasing additional volume boosters. Otherwise, connectivity will be halted until your monthly volume is refreshed on your next billing cycle.\" Globe followed the suit with a similar \"volume boost\" arrangement.\n\nThis practice has since been weaned off for fixed broadband such as DSL and fiber optic, particularly with capped rates being silently retired. Globe, who previously retired all their unlimited data rates to capped ones, have reintroduced uncapped rates too.\n\nIn 2015, PLDT increased lock-in period for TD-LTE connection plans from 24 to 36 months (3 years) with the pre-termination fee equal to the full balance for the remaining period. After the lock-in period the contract is automatically renewed for another 36 months subject to the same terms and conditions. As of now the Globe lock-in period is still 2 years with no pre-termination fee outside of the lock-in period. The PLDT TD-LTE contract allows PLDT to change the terms and conditions at any time with the only way left for subscribers to opt out of the altered service through paying the full pre-termination fee: \"8.3 Modification. SBI reserves the right at its discretion to modify, delete or add to any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement at any time without further notice. It is the Subscriber’s responsibility to regularly check any changes to these Terms and Conditions. The Subscriber’s continued use of the Service after any such changes constitutes acceptance of the new Terms and Conditions.\" Even as the Consumer Act of the Philippines states \"Unfair or Unconscionable Sales Act or Practice ... the following circumstances shall be considered ... that the transaction that the seller or supplier induced the consumer to enter into was excessively one-sided in favor of the seller or supplier\", the practice of inducing extremely long term contracts with the ultimate pre-termination penalty has not been legally challenged yet.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Like the damaru, the idakka's pitch may be bent by squeezing the lacing in the middle. The idakka is slung over the left shoulder and the right side of the instrument is gently beaten with a thin curve-ended stick.\n\nIt is believed that the word comes from the Malayalam word \"idakku\", meaning \"centre\". The word is said to allude to the instrument's position between the temple idol and the devotees.\nSimilar to the talking drum, The Idakka consists of two circular drum heads each of which is mounted within a circular ring. The hourglass-shaped body is placed between the two heads and lacing is used to pull the two rings towards each other, stretching each drum head over an open end of the body. Snare-like strings made of natural fiber are stretched across the open ends of the drum body, under each drum head. It is not uncommon for the diameter of the drum heads to be larger than the diameter of the body, with the result that the drum heads are often seen mounted significantly off-center.\n\nThe Idakka is a small, high pitched drum with definite pitch. The snares running under the drum heads have been found to interact with the vibrating membrane in a way that causes the pitch of the instrument to be determinate. Different pitches can be obtained by squeezing the lacing around the instrument, which changes the amount of tension in the skins.\n\n"}

{"id": "2086000", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2086000", "title": "Krill fishery", "text": "Krill fishery\n\nThe krill fishery is the commercial fishery of krill, small shrimp-like marine animals that live in the oceans world-wide. The present estimate for the biomass of Antarctic krill (\"Euphausia superba\") is 379 million tonnes. The total global harvest of krill from all fisheries amounts to 150–200,000 tonnes annually, mainly Antarctic krill and North Pacific krill (\"E. pacifica\").\n\nKrill are rich in protein (40% or more of dry weight) and lipids (about 20% in \"E. superba\"). Their exoskeleton amounts to some 2% of dry weight of chitin. They also contain traces of a wide array of hydrolytic enzymes such as proteases, carbohydrases, nucleases and phospholipases, which are concentrated in the digestive gland in the cephalothorax of the krill.\n\nMost krill is used as aquaculture feed and fish bait; other uses include livestock or pet foods. Only a small percentage is prepared for human consumption. Their enzymes are interesting for medical applications, an expanding sector since the early 1990s. \n\nKrill are small animals, considered a type of zooplankton, and hence need to be fished with fine-meshed plankton nets. Such nets pose several problems: they tend to clog fast, and they have high drag, producing a bow wave that deflects the krill to the sides. Trawling must hence be done at low speeds. Additionally, fine nets are delicate, and the first krill nets designed exploded while fishing through the krill schools. Furthermore, fine nets increase unwanted bycatch, such as fish fingerlings, which might have unforeseen side-effects on the ecosystem, even though large krill aggregations tend to be monospecific.\n\nAnother problem is bringing the krill catch on board. When the full net is hauled out of the water, the organisms compress each other, resulting in great loss of the krill's liquids. Experiments have been carried out to pump Antarctic krill, while still in water, from the cod end of the net through a large tube on board. This method had already been used by the small fishing boats in Japanese waters; it increases the capture capacity and the processing rate of krill.\nOne of the first Antarctic krill trawlers to use this technique was the \"FV Atlantic Navigator\", registered in Vanuatu and owned by the Norwegian-based company Aker ASA, which used this technique in the 2003/04 and 2004/05 fishing seasons. In these seasons, this ship alone caught 25% and 38% of the whole krill catch in CCAMLR regions. The successor ship of the \"Atlantic Navigator\", the \"FV Saga Sea\", can fish up to about 120,000 tonnes of krill annually, and Aker announced plans to build more such ships -- Antarctic Endurance launching early 2019.\n\nKrill must be processed within one to three hours after capture due to the rapid enzymatic breakdown and the tainting of the meat by the intestines. They must be peeled because their exoskeleton contains fluorides, which are toxic in high concentrations.\n\nMost krill is processed to produce fish food for use in aquariums and aquacultures. The krill is sold freeze-dried, either whole or pulverized. Krill as a food source is known to have positive effects on some fish, such as stimulating appetite or resulting in an increased disease resistance. Furthermore, krill contains carotenoids and is thus used sometimes as a pigmentizing agent to color the skin and meat of some fish. About 34% of the Japanese catch of \"E. superba\" and 50% of \"E. pacifica\" are used for fish food; the Canadian catch is used almost exclusively for this purpose.\n\nOne quarter of the Japanese catch of \"E. superba\" is used in the form of fresh frozen krill as fish bait and half the \"E. pacifica\" catch is used as chum for sport fishing. The Japanese industry produces boiled, frozen krill and peeled tail meat. Other uses include krill pastes or processed krill as food additives, e.g. in the form of krill oil gel capsules. Only a small amount of \"E. superba\" is processed for human consumption.\n\nMedical applications of krill enzymes include products for treating necrotic tissue and as chemonucleolytic agents. Of the 376 krill-related patents that had been registered world-wide until 2002, 17% related to medical uses. Most of these medical patents had been registered after 1988.\n\nKrill fishery in the Southern Ocean targets the largest species of krill existing, the Antarctic krill (\"Euphausia superba\"), which can grow to about . Fishing began in the early 1960s, when the Soviet Union launched its first experimental operations. All throughout the decade, preparatory activities were carried out, resulting in small catches of a few tens of tonnes per year. Scientists mapped the locations of krill swarms to determine the best fishing grounds, and engineers developed and improved the equipment necessary to fish and process krill. In 1972, the Soviets set up a permanent fishery in Antarctic waters, landing 7,500 tonnes in 1973 and then expanding quickly. The Japanese began experimental krill fishing operation in the area in 1972 and started full-scale commercial operations in 1975.\n\nKrill catch increased rapidly. In the 1980s, a few additional nations started operating in the area: Poland, Chile, and South Korea. Their catches amounted to a few thousand tonnes annually; the lion's share went to the Soviet Union, followed by Japan. A peak in krill harvest was reached in 1982 with a total production of over 528,000 tonnes, of which the Soviet Union produced 93%. In the following two years, production declined. It is unclear whether this was due to the discovery of fluorides in the krill's exoskeleton or to marketing problems. The trade recovered quickly, though, and reached more than 400,000 tonnes again in 1987.\n\nWith the demise of the Soviet Union, two of its successor nations, Russia and Ukraine, took over the operations. Russian operations and catches dwindled, and were abandoned altogether in 1993. Since then, Japan is one of the top producers, but facing stiff competition by other countries. Since 2000, the small South Korean Antarctic krill fishery has also expanded considerably. A U.S. company entered the market in 2001. The Norwegian company Aker ASA entered the business in 2003 with a ship registered in Vanuatu.\n\nIn 1982, the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) came into force, as part of the Antarctic Treaty System. The CCAMLR was originally signed by fifteen states; as of 2004 it had 24 members. Its purpose is to regulate the fishery in the Southern Ocean to ensure a long-term sustainable development and to prevent overfishing. In 1993, the CCAMLR set forth catch quotas for krill, which amount to nearly five million tonnes per year.\n\nThe annual catch of \"Euphausia superba\" since the mid-1990s is about 100–120,000 tonnes annually, i.e., about one fiftieth of the CCAMLR catch quota. Still, the CCAMLR is criticized for having defined its catch limits too generously, as there are no precise estimates of the total biomass of Antarctic krill available and there have been reports indicating that it is declining since the 1990s. Plans to take up to 746,000 tonnes a year were disclosed at the 2007 meeting of CCAMLR.\n\nFishing for Antarctic krill was commonly done from large stern trawlers using midwater trawls before the purpose built krill trawlers like Antarctic Endurance were planned and put into use. For scientific purposes, vertical trawls using, for example, a bongo net, are also employed.\n\nIn 2018 it was announced that almost every krill fishing company operating in Antarctica will abandon operations in huge areas around the Antarctic Peninsula from 2020, including “buffer zones” around breeding colonies of penguins.\n\nThe krill fishery in Japanese waters primarily targets the North Pacific krill (\"Euphausia pacifica\"), which reaches a size of about . The annual catch is of the order of 60–70,000 tonnes. Minor fisheries for \"Euphausia nana\" (a few thousand tonnes) and \"Thysannoessa inermis\" (a few hundred tonnes annually) also exist. The fishing ground are all above the continental shelf close to the coast and at most deep. \"E. nana\" reaches only 1.2 cm, and \"T. inermis\" can grow to .\n\n\"E. pacifica\" was fished as early as the 19th century. Fishing is done with small boats. The traditional technique uses bow-mounted trawls, augmented by fish pumps since the 1980s. A bow-mounted trawl can exploit only surface swarms of krill up to a depth of about eight metres. In the 1970s, the krill fishery expanded drastically and began to use also one- or two-boat seines, which can catch swarms as deep as . A peak in the krill production was reached in 1992 with over 100,000 tonnes. The following year, catch regulations were enforced, and since then the annual catch has been reduced by about 30%.\n\nSmall-scale fisheries for krill also exist in other areas. In Canada, fishing for \"E. pacifica\" takes place in the Strait of Georgia off British Columbia; there is a government-imposed catch limit of 500 tonnes per year. Fisheries targeting the Northern krill (\"Meganyctiphanes norvegica\"), a medium-sized krill reaching body lengths of more than , as well as \"Tysanoessa raschii\" (2 cm) and \"T. inermis\" in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and on the Scotian Shelf have been proposed, but didn't get beyond early experimental stages. They are limited to harvesting a few hundred tonnes of krill per year, and Nicol & Foster consider it unlikely that any new large-scale harvesting operations in these areas will be started due to the opposition from local fishing industries and conservation groups.\n\n\nThe main reference for this article is a report from 1997:\n\n\n"}

This action can signal the telephone exchange to do something. A common use of a hook flash is to switch to another incoming call with the call waiting service. Another use is to indicate a request for voice conferencing, for example, a user may use a procedure like the following to initiate three-way calling:\n\n\nThe second \"flash\" signals the Central Office Switch to link the two active conversations, so that all three parties are connected to the same logical telephone line.\n\nIn contrast to PBX conferencing systems, the two calls are joined at the Central Office switch, rather than at the customer premises PBX.\n\nOn payphones, this function is usually provided with a button labeled \"Follow-on call\", which is mainly used for requesting another dial tone after finishing a call. This allows remaining credit to be used on another call as payphones don't usually return changes. With payphones that do not have this button, flashing the handset on and off-hook quickly will also perform the same action.\n\nThe switchhook is the device that senses whether the handset or receiver is in its cradle. The term \"flash\" originated from the cord circuit of the early telephone switchboard that telephone company operators used to connect calls. The calling party and called party each had an indicator light on the cord circuit. When the subscriber cycled the telephone on-hook/off-hook, the light would flash. Actors in old movies often demonstrate this method, seeking the operator's attention. The user does a \"tap-tap-tap\". When an operator comes on the line, the actor says, \"Hello? Operator? We've been cut off.\" Then the operator attempts to reestablish the connection. The flashing light of this equipment of bygone days is the origin of the phrase \"flashing the switchhook\".\n\nCentrex telephones added a hook-flash button in the 1960s, after some users incorrectly attempted the attendant-recall function.\n"}

Its creator, Giuseppe Bertani, intended LB to stand for lysogeny broth, but LB has also come to colloquially mean Luria broth, Lennox broth, or Luria-Bertani medium. The formula of the LB medium was published in 1951 in the first paper of Bertani on lysogeny. In this article he described the modified single-burst experiment and the isolation of the phages P1, P2, and P3. He had developed the LB medium to optimize \"Shigella\" growth and plaque formation.\n\nLB media formulations have been an industry standard for the cultivation of \"Escherichia coli\" as far back as the 1950s. These media have been widely used in molecular microbiology applications for the preparation of plasmid DNA and recombinant proteins. It continues to be one of the most common media used for maintaining and cultivating laboratory recombinant strains of \"Escherichia coli\". For physiological studies however, the use of LB medium is to be discouraged.\n\nThere are several common formulations of LB. Although they are different, they generally share a somewhat similar composition of ingredients used to promote growth, including the following:\n\n\nSodium ions for transport and osmotic balance are provided by sodium chloride. Tryptone is used to provide essential amino acids such as peptides and peptones to the growing bacteria, while the yeast extract is used to provide a plethora of organic compounds helpful for bacterial growth. These compounds include vitamins and certain trace elements.\n\nIn his original 1951 paper, Bertani used 10 grams of NaCl and 1 gram of glucose per 1 L of solution; Luria in his \"L broth\" of 1957 copied Bertani's original recipe exactly. Recipes published later have typically left out the glucose.\n\nThe formulations generally differ in the amount of sodium chloride, thus providing selection of the appropriate osmotic conditions for the particular bacterial strain and desired culture conditions. The low salt formulations, Lennox and Luria, are ideal for cultures requiring salt-sensitive antibiotics.\n\n\nThe following is a common method for the preparation of 1 litre of LB:\n\n\nPrior to autoclaving, some labs adjust the pH of LB to 7.5 or 8 with sodium hydroxide. However, sodium hydroxide does not provide any buffering capacity to the media, and this result in rapid changes to the pH during bacteria cultivation. To get around this some labs prefer to adjust the pH with 5-10 mmol/L TRIS buffer, diluted from 1 mol/l TRIS stock at the desired pH. However, it is not absolutely necessary to adjust the pH for most situations. Some labs adjust the pH to 7.0 merely as a precaution.\n\nSince the buffering with Tris will also be largely ineffective in the face of substantial bacterial growth, adjusting the pH of LB in this particular manner is usually unnecessary. As such, use of Tris in some broth recipes (especially when the culture will be stored at room temperature conditions for extended periods of time) may be considered a superstitious procedure without much scientific merit.\n\n"}

He was a professor of art history at the University of Vienna and a famous member of the Vienna School of Art History, employing a \"Geistesgeschichte\" methodology.\n\nDvořák was born on 4 June 1874 in Roudnice nad Labem, Bohemia, the son of a Bohemian archivist and librarian.\n\nHe studied at the universities of Prague and Vienna. In 1897, he completed a PhD thesis in history at the Institut für Österreichische Geschichtsforschung, Vienna. Having been impressed by the teaching of art historian Franz Wickhoff, he focused his attention to art history and wrote his \"Habilitationsschrift\" on Bohemian thirteenth- and fourteenth-century manuscript illumination by Johannes von Neumarkt (1901).\n\nIn 1902, Dvořák was appointed lecturer in art history at the University of Vienna. After Alois Riegl's death in 1905, he became, with the help of Julius von Schlosser, curator of public monuments in Austria. In 1909, he was appointed full professor of art history at the University of Vienna, which caused some problems among the nationalists of the art faculty because of Dvořák's Czech origin. Therefore, Josef Strzygowski set up his own, competing art history institute, known as the \"Wiener Institut\", within the same university, resulting in Dvořák and Strzygowski teaching from two different art history \"centers\". \n\nHe was one of the main representatives of the Vienna School of Art History, his most important publication being on the concept of art history as a history of ideas (\"Kunstgeschichte als Geistesgeschichte\"). In 1905, he succeeded Riegl as general curator of the Imperial Central Commission for the study and conservation of art and historical monuments, today Bundesdenkmalamt. He helped save many Austrian art treasures for post-World War I war reparation. He also continued the publication of the \"Kunstgeschichtliches Jahrbuch der Zentralkommission für die Erhaltung der Kunst- und historischen Denkmale\", and in 1907, he established an inventory of Austrian and Hungarian monuments, called \"Österreichische Kunsttopographie\". Also in 1907, he created the first complete catalogue of The Lobkowicz Collections. In 1916 he published his standard work, \"Katechismus der Denkmalpflege\", in which he was able to raise a broad understanding for the concerns of monument protection.\n\nDvořák died from a stroke on 8 February 1921 during a visit to his friend Count Khuen von Belasi at castle near Hrušovany nad Jevišovkou in South Moravia. He left a widow and two children. He was buried in Grusbach cemetery, in an honorary grave.\n\nDvořák influenced several art historians, among them Frederick Antal, Otto Benesch, Dagobert Frey, Guido Kaschnitz von Weinberg, Emil Kaufmann, Ludwig Münz, Karl Maria Swoboda, Hans Tietze and Lionello Venturi. According to Matthew Rampley, \"In many respects his writing acts as a barometer of many of the tensions of the early-twentieth-century intellectual life\", casting \"important light on the socio-cultural situation that produced art historical discourses in the early decades of the twentieth century.\" \n\nHis archives are housed at the University of Vienna.\n\nIn 1921, fellow Austrian Adolf Loos designed a mausoleum for Dvořák that has remained unbuilt.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Upon promotion to the rank of Lieutenant General, Soyster served as the Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency at Bolling Air Force Base, Washington D.C. Soyster served in this role from December 1988 to September 1991. Upon retirement he was the VP for International Operations for the private military firm Military Professional Resources Inc. He later served as Special Assistant to the SEC ARMY for World War II 60th Anniversary Commemorations. Soyster is a member of the Military Intelligence Hall of Fame and currently serves on numerous boards of directors and participates in studies on current issues. Lieutenant General Soyster has three daughters (Karin Soyster Fitzgerald, Megan Soyster-Heinz, and Allison Moser) and six grandchildren (Julia Moser, Sloan Soyster-Heinz, Stephen Moser, Maxwell Soyster-Heinz, Reed Soyster-Heinz, and Clark Soyster-Heinz). \nHarry Edward Soyster was born on 6 June 1935 in Altoona, Pennsylvania and was raised in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania. He attended school there and was subsequently appointed to the United States Military Academy at West Point, NY. General Soyster was an Eagle Scout, Class President, member of the first all-star football team from Hollidaysburg, and captained the first undefeated basketball team in the history of the school. Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute recognized General Soyster for the highest average grade in math and science in his school. He was also recognized as best \"All-Around Boy\" by local town officials. General Soyster worked in a stone quarry and in construction during summer breaks from school.\n\nLieutenant General Soyster was commissioned a second lieutenant and awarded a BS in Engineering from the United States Military Academy. He also holds a master of science degree in chemistry from Pennsylvania State University and a master of science degree in management from the University of Southern California and attended programs at Harvard University. His military education includes completion of the Field Artillery School, Basic and Advanced Courses; the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College graduating in 1968, and the National War College at Fort McNair, Washington DC graduating in 1977.\n\nSoyster has held a wide variety of important commands and staff positions including tours in Vietnam and Korea. He was chief of staff, 24th Infantry Division and Fort Stewart, Georgia, and Deputy Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence Systems and Automation, Office of the Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence, Headquarters, Department of the Army.\n\nGeneral Soyster served in diverse and significant assignments before becoming DIA director. His initial overseas assignment was in Italy with the 1st Battalion, 80th Artillery as platoon commander and assistant operation officer. He was next an assistant professor of chemistry at the US Military Academy.\n\nIn Vietnam, he was executive officer and subsequently operations officer of the 2nd Battalion, 35th Artillery, II Field Force, U.S. Military Assistance Command Vietnam (MACV).\n\nOn return to the United States he was assigned as a personnel staff officer, Strength Requirements Branch, Capabilities and Analysis Division, Procurement and Distribution Directorate, Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel, U.S. Army, Washington, D.C. He served as staff operations watch officer and later operations and plans officer, Joint Reconnaissance Center, Operations Directorate, J3, Organization of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Washington, D.C.\n\nHe returned overseas to serve as commander of the 1st Battalion, 31st Field Artillery, 2nd Infantry Division, Korea, and later as commander, 2nd Battalion, 17th Field Artillery, 2nd Infantry Division, Korea.\n\nUpon return to the United States, he served at Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania, as chief of oral history, U.S. Army Military History Research Collection. After attending the National War College at Fort McNair, he was assigned chief of the Audit and Inspection Compliance Division, U.S. Army Inspector General Agency, Washington, D.C.\n\nHe then served as commander, Division Artillery and then Chief of Staff, 24th Infantry Division, Fort Stewart, Georgia. Upon promotion to brigadier general he was assigned as Deputy Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence, Department of the Army, Washington, D.C.\n\nHe was promoted to major general and assigned as Commanding General of the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command, Arlington Hall Station, Virginia. Then promoted and assigned, Director, Defense Intelligence Agency\n\nGeneral Soyster oversaw the Defense intelligence effort in support of the successful U.S. intervention in Panama in 1989 (Operation JUST CAUSE). This operation demonstrated the benefits of increased cooperation and planning that had been achieved between DIA and operational force planners, especially when compared to the 1983 Grenada incursion (Operation URGENT FURY). The Agency provided threat data on \"hot spots\" throughout the Middle East, Africa, and Asia, and weighed the impact of changes in the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and to a lesser degree, Asia, on the rest of world. It supplied decision makers with intelligence support concerning the final Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, events surrounding the downing of two Libyan jets, the civil war in Liberia, the Flight 103 investigation at Lockerbie, Scotland, and the Tiananmen Square incident in China. Weapons acquisition issues, counternarcotics, counterterrorism remained a high priority throughout the Defense Intelligence Community.\n\nThe end of the Cold War resulted in a reevaluation of the intelligence mission throughout the Intelligence Community as a new era began with the fall of the Communist Party in many East European countries, the reunification of Germany, and ongoing economic reforms in the region. Emphasis was placed on improved management of DoD-wide intelligence production, but reduced resources threatened to have a negative impact on Agency objectives and manpower levels. Organizationally, the general emphasized the functional manager system as a programming mechanism for addressing the issues of the Unified & Specified Commands.\n\nThe Assistant Secretary of Defense (Command, Control, Communication, and Intelligence) relationship to DIA was enhanced with authority, direction, and control prerogatives. The deputy director position became a civilian position to insure that a substantive intelligent officer would hold that position. The previous two-star position was moved to J-2 and the title changed accordingly.\n\nIraq's invasion on 2 August 1990 of Kuwait resulted in a coalition of UN forces that resolved to liberate that country. DIA warned of the Iraqi threat in late July. An intensive and extensive 24-hour operation went into effect in DIA with daily tailored intelligence support to coalition forces, participation in daily press briefings, and the full range of printed product support to numerous consumers. All phases of the Agency's workforce and more than 2,000 people contributed to Operation DESERT SHIELD. A Joint Intelligence Center (JIC) was established to integrate intelligence produced by all sectors of the community. No set of combat commanders has ever had as full and complete a view of his adversary as did U.S. and coalition field commanders during DESERT STORM, and this conflict remains one of the greatest examples of intelligence support to operational forces in modern times. For its achievements during the crisis and conflict, DIA received its second Joint Meritorious Unit Award from the Secretary of Defense, personally presented by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Colin L. Powell, on 26 June 1991.\n\nIn post-military work General Soyster was employed by L-3 Communications Corporation's Military Personnel Resources Incorporated (MPRI), retiring in 2005.\n\nIn response to a query regarding his view on torture in 2007 – in the aftermath of the disclosure of \"waterboarding\" of Al-Qaeda terrorists – General Soyster gave the following opinion:\n\nExperienced military and intelligence professionals know that torture, in addition to being illegal and immoral, is an unreliable means of extracting information from prisoners. Much is being made of former CIA official John Kiriakou's statement that waterboarding \"broke\" a high-value terrorist involved in the 9/11 plot. There are always those who, whether out of fear or inexperience, rush to push the panic button instead of relying on what we know works best and most reliably in these situations. I would caution those who would rely on this example. It is far from clear that the information obtained from this prisoner through illegal means could not have been obtained through lawful methods. The FBI was getting good intelligence from this prisoner before the CIA took over. And there are numerous examples of cases where relying on information obtained through torture has disastrous consequences. The reality is that use of torture produces inconsistent results that are an unreliable basis for action and policy. The overwhelming consensus of intelligence professionals is that torture produces unreliable information. And the overwhelming consensus of senior military leaders is that resort to torture is dishonorable. Use of such primitive methods actually puts our own troops and our nation at risk.\"\n\nPersonal awards and decorations include the Defense Distinguished Service Medal, Army Distinguished Service Medal with oak leaf cluster, Legion of Merit, Bronze Star for Valor and one oak leaf clusters, one Bronze Star for Meritorious Service, Purple Heart, Army Meritorious Service Medal with oak leaf cluster, the Air Medal with 2 oak leaf clusters, the Joint Service Commendation Medal, the Army Commendation Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, the Vietnam Service Medal with four stars, Army Service Ribbon, Army Overseas Service Ribbon with numeral 2, the Vietnam Campaign Medal, and the Korea Defense Service Medal.\n\nUnit awards include the Joint Meritorious Unit Award, the Vietnam Gallantry Cross Unit Citation, and the Vietnam Civil Actions Unit Citation.\n\nBadges include the Parachutist Badge, Ranger tab, the Army General Staff Identification Badge, and the Joint Staff Identification Badge, the Defense Intelligence Agency Badge, and the Expert Marksmanship Badge.\n\nGeneral Soyster is also the recipient of the National Intelligence Distinguished Service Medal and the Military Intelligence Corps Knowlton Award.\n\nHe is a member of the Military Intelligence Hall of Fame.\n\n"}

He graduated in 1951 with an M.S. degree, then became a member of the faculty there.\n\nIn 1954 Overton moved into a New York City loft at 821 Sixth Avenue, known as the Jazz Loft, where he lived alongside legendary photographer W. Eugene Smith, musicians Dick Cary and Jimmy Stevenson, painter David X. Young and other established and rising musicians and artists. This provided the perfect setting for the musicians to jam and learn together. Smith recorded many of these sessions, which were released in October 2000 as part of the Jazz Loft Project, a large ongoing project involving Smith's photos and tapes from that period.\n\nWhile Overton was writing classical compositions, he was also deeply immersed in jazz, and recorded with such jazz notables as Stan Getz, Duke Jordan, Jimmy Raney and Teddy Charles. Thelonious Monk selected him to score his piano works for orchestra; a performance of these compositions in New York City was recorded live on February 28, 1959 and released on the album \"The Thelonious Monk Orchestra at Town Hall\". In 1963, Monk recorded a second live album with orchestral arrangements by Overton at the New York Philharmonic Hall, released as \"Big Band and Quartet in Concert\".\n\nIn later years, Overton taught at the Yale School of Music and the New School of Social Research. He received awards from The Koussevitzky Foundation and the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation.\n\nOverton died on November 24, 1972, aged 52, from cirrhosis of the liver. Just a few months earlier, his opera \"Huckleberry Finn\", commissioned by the Barney Jaffin Foundation, was presented by The Juilliard Opera Company.\n\nOverton married Nancy Swain (1926–2009) in 1949, with whom he had two sons, Richard Adair (Rick) Overton and Steven Swain Overton.\n\nAbout his music, Hall Overton said:\n\nWith Jimmy Raney\nWith Teddy Charles\n\n"}

{"id": "2086055", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2086055", "title": "Perpendicular recording", "text": "Perpendicular recording\n\nPerpendicular recording (or perpendicular magnetic recording, PMR), also known as conventional magnetic recording (CMR), is a technology for data recording on magnetic media, particularly hard disks. It was first proven advantageous in 1976 by Shun-ichi Iwasaki, then professor of the Tohoku University in Japan, and first commercially implemented in 2005. The first industry-standard demonstration showing unprecedented advantage of PMR over longitudinal magnetic recording (LMR) at nanoscale dimensions was made in 1998 at IBM Almaden Research Center in collaboration with researchers of Data Storage Systems Center (DSSC) – a National Science Foundation (NSF) Engineering Research Center (ERCs) at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU).\n\nPerpendicular recording can deliver more than three times the storage density of traditional longitudinal recording. In 1986, Maxell announced a floppy disk using perpendicular recording that could store . Perpendicular recording was later used by Toshiba in 3.5\" floppy disks in 1989 to permit 2.88 MB of capacity (ED or extra-high density), but they failed to succeed in the marketplace. Since about 2005, the technology has come into use for hard disk drives. Hard disk technology with longitudinal recording has an estimated limit of due to the superparamagnetic effect, though this estimate is constantly changing. Perpendicular recording is predicted to allow information densities of up to around . , drives with densities of were available commercially, and there have been perpendicular recording demonstrations of .\n\nThe main challenge in designing magnetic information storage media is to retain the magnetization of the medium despite thermal fluctuations caused by the superparamagnetic limit. If the thermal energy is too high, there may be enough energy to reverse the magnetization in a region of the medium, destroying the data stored there. The energy required to reverse the magnetization of a magnetic region is proportional to the size of the magnetic region and the magnetic coercivity of the material. The larger the magnetic region is and the higher the magnetic coercivity of the material, the more stable the medium is. Thus, there is a minimum size for a magnetic region at a given temperature and coercivity. If it is any smaller it is likely to be spontaneously de-magnetized by local thermal fluctuations. Perpendicular recording uses higher coercivity materials because the head's write field penetrates the medium more efficiently in the perpendicular geometry.\n\nThe popular explanation for the advantage of perpendicular recording is that it achieves higher storage densities by aligning the poles of the magnetic elements, which represent bits, perpendicularly to the surface of the disk platter, as shown in the illustration. In this not-quite-accurate explanation, aligning the bits in this manner takes less platter area than what would have been required had they been placed longitudinally. This means cells can be placed closer together on the platter, thus increasing the number of magnetic elements that can be stored in a given area. The true picture is a bit more complex, having to do with the use of a magnetically \"stronger\" (higher coercivity) material as the storage medium. This is possible because in a perpendicular arrangement the magnetic flux is guided through a magnetically soft (and relatively thick) underlayer underneath the hard magnetic media films (considerably complicating and thickening the total disk structure). This magnetically soft underlayer can be effectively considered a part of the write head, making the write head more efficient, thus making it possible to produce a stronger write field gradient with essentially the same head materials as for longitudinal heads, and therefore allowing for the use of the higher coercivity magnetic storage medium. A higher coercivity medium is inherently thermally more stable, as stability is proportional to the product of bit (or magnetic grain) volume times the \"uniaxial anisotropy constant\" K, which in turn is higher for a material with a higher magnetic coercivity.\n\nVertimag Systems Corporation, founded by Professor Jack Judy of the University of Minnesota. As a colleague of Iwasaki, created the first perpendicular disk drives, heads and disks in 1984. 5 MB removable floppy drives were demonstrated in IBM PCs to major computer manufacturers. Vertimag went out of business during the PC crash of 1985.\n\nToshiba produced the first commercially available disk drive (1.8\") using this technology in 2005. Shortly thereafter in January 2006, Seagate Technology began shipping its first laptop sized hard drive using perpendicular recording technology, the Seagate Momentus 5400.3. Seagate also announced at that time that the majority of its hard disk storage devices would utilize the new technology by the end of 2006.\n\nIn April 2006, Seagate began shipping the first 3.5 inch perpendicular recording hard drive, the Cheetah 15K.5, with up to 300GB storage, running at 15,000 rpm and claim to have 30% better performance than their predecessors with a data rate of 73–125 Mbyte/s.\n\nIn April 2006, Seagate announced the Barracuda 7200.10, a series of HDDs utilizing perpendicular recording with a maximum capacity of 750 GB. Drives began shipping in late April 2006.\n\nHitachi announced a 20 GB Microdrive. Hitachi's first laptop drive (2.5-inch) based on perpendicular recording became available in mid-2006, featuring a maximum capacity of 160 GB.\n\nIn June 2006, Toshiba announced a hard drive of 200-GB capacity with mass production starting in August, effectively raising the standard of mobile storage capacity.\n\nIn July 2006, Western Digital announced volume production of its WD Scorpio hard drives using WD-designed and manufactured perpendicular magnetic recording (PMR) technology to achieve 80 GB-per-platter density.\n\nIn August 2006 Fujitsu extended its lineup to include SATA models utilizing perpendicular recording, offering up to 160GB capacity.\n\nIn December 2006 Toshiba said its new 100GB two-platter HDD is based on perpendicular magnetic recording (PMR) and was designed in the \"short\" 1.8-inch form factor.\n\nIn December 2006 Fujitsu announced its MHX2300BT series of hard disk drives, with capacities of 250 and 300 GB.\n\nIn January 2007 Hitachi announced the first 1-terabyte hard drive using the technology, which they then delivered in April 2007.\n\nIn July 2008 Seagate Technology announced a 1.5 terabyte SATA hard drive using PMR technology.\n\nIn January 2009 Western Digital announced the first 2.0 terabyte SATA hard drive using PMR technology.\n\nIn February 2009 Seagate Technology announced the first 7,200rpm 2.0 terabyte SATA hard drive using PMR technology with choice of SATA 2 or SAS 2.0 interface.\n\n\n"}

After the successes of their 1996 Royal Albert Hall performance and their subsequent album \"Dark Fields\" (1997), the duo decided to record a limited edition album featuring the duo's renditions of traditional folk music. It was recorded in September 1998 as a project to connect the band to their roots.\n\nIt was released as a limited edition release in late 1998 on the band's own label Hands on Music. It was only released via postal order and at the band's concerts and was not reviewed by music press. It was out of print for many years before being re-released in 2015 as a free download to those on the duo's mailing list.\n\nAfter Show of Hands performed an unexpectedly highly successful performance at the Royal Albert Hall in 1996, they released the concert as a live album entitled \"Live at the Royal Albert Hall\", which became the duo's best-selling album. Steve Knightley of the duo noted that as a result of the success of the performance, \"it's easier to get in local papers. But we now need to replace that with a story about the music. That's the dilemma.\" The duo followed the success with \"Dark Fields\" (1997), an album which the duo had intended to build on their success. Whilst very much a critical success, the single released from the album, \"Crazy Boy\", commercially underperformed.\n\nIn 1998, the duo promoted \"Dark Fields\" with a tour. During the tour, the duo decided that they would not so quickly release a new album of music that the duo had composed. Knightley had begun writing songs, but would use them for his first solo album \"Track of Words\" (1999). The duo decided to release a limited edition album of the band's renditions of traditional folk music to \"connect them to their roots\". The duo recorded the album in September 1998 and were pleased with the results. The album contains ten versions of traditional folk songs, as well as a hidden track featuring a short version of \"High Germany\", a song that the duo had previously recorded live for their previous album \"Dark Fields\".\n\nTrack 10, “The Train” / “Blackwaterside”, includes \"The Train\". This is the third appearance on a Show of Hands album for the song, following its inclusion on \"Dark Fields\" and the 10-minute reprise of the song which takes the form of a hidden track also on \"Dark Fields\". “The Train” / “Blackwaterside” is the only song still available from the album on CD, as it was released on the best-of album \"\".\n\nThe album was released by the duo's own label Hands on Music in late 1998 as a limited edition. It was only ever made available via post order and at the band's concerts, and only for a short time. The unusual release meant that the album was not reviewed by any professional music critics. Nonetheless, the duo said that the concept \"to connect them to their roots\" worked well.\n\nThe duo were not quick to follow the album with another album of the duo's own material. They followed \"Folk Music\" with an album of re-recordings of their old material, \"Anglicana\" (1999), and an album of contemporary cover versions, \"Covers\" (2000), before returning to recording an album of new material with \"Cold Frontier\" (2001). During 1999, the duo also undertook solo projects, including Knightley's solo album \"Track of Words\" and Beer's projects \"Ridgeriders\" and \"The Fiddle Collection\".\n\nThe tenth song, \"The Train\"/\"Blackwaterside\", was featured on the band's 2007 compilation album \"\", becoming the first time music from the album had been available in some eight to nine years. In February 2015, after sixteen years of unavailability, the band re-released \"Folk Music\" as a free download to anyone who subscribed to their mailing list.\n\nAll tracks are traditional arrangements of folk songs by Steve Knightley and Phil Beer, except where noted.\n\n\n"}

It was founded in 1867, and works in partnership with individuals and churches across the world. The organization's stated aim is to use the Bible to inspire children, young people and adults to know God.\n\nScripture Union is an autonomous organisation in each country, linked together by Scripture Union International. It is primarily a volunteer organisation with a small number of full-time staff training, encouraging and coordinating ministry workers around the world. Scripture Union is also a member of the Forum of Bible Agencies International.\n\nIn 1867 Josiah Spiers spoke to 15 children in a drawing room in Islington, London, and began the work of sharing the Christian message with children in a way that related to their real needs. This led to the founding of the Children's Special Service Mission (CSSM) which was later to become \"Scripture Union\".\n\nAt about the same time as Spiers held his meeting in Islington, brothers Samuel and James Tyler and Tom Bond Bishop started a similar meeting in Blackfriars Road, south of the river Thames. Similarly Henry Hankinson and Henry Hutchinson had started meetings in Mildmay Park. All of them had come under the influence of Rev Edward Payson Hammond, a controversial American preacher who had visited London in the early summer of 1867 and held meetings for both children and Sunday School teachers. Hammond's idea was simple: informal, special services for children. Despite the controversy which it sparked amongst Sunday School teachers, Spiers and the others were convinced.\n\nThe following year, Spiers travelled to Llandudno, North Wales on holiday and began to tell the children there about his faith. He drew the text \"God is Love\" in the sand, invited children to decorate it, and then told them a Bible story.\n\nSpiers quickly established the CSSM as a mission to oversee his work in Islington. By August 1868 Bishop had joined the committee and by the end of the year, Hankinson was also a member, bringing in the Mildmay Park meetings as well. Whilst Spiers was the engaging children's speaker, Bishop had the organising ability and became the honorary secretary. The working partnership of Bond and Spiers was to last for more than 40 years and be the foundation of a movement which has spread to more than 130 countries.\n\nIn 1879 CSSM started the Children's Scripture Union, a system of daily Bible reading.A membership card had a list of daily readings, and this was soon complemented by explanatory notes in children’s magazines. Booklets of notes were published for troops in the trenches during the First World War and led to the first issue of Daily Notes in 1923.\n\nIn 1892 the first Boys’ Camp was started in Littlehampton by Major Leibenrood, a veteran from the Zulu War. The following year, the Caravan Mission to Village Children (CMVC) was started using a bakers’ cart. The CMVC became part of CSSM, but in 1960 Scripture Union became the official name of the organisation.\n\nIn the 1950s CSSM / Scripture Union held an annual book writing competition, resulting in the publication of many children's novels including several by Patricia St John (Treasures of the Snow), still in print today. These were hard back books with illustrations and dust jackets by artist LF Lupton.\n\nSU's work is carried out through local people in ways which are seen as appropriate to each country, culture and situation in which a movement is based.This can include running camps, and missions (e.g. holiday beach mission), working in schools and with student groups or producing resources for Bible reading, family counselling, AIDS education, urban children and youth ministry and ministry to the handicapped.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2086071", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2086071", "title": "Rail transport in Finland", "text": "Rail transport in Finland\n\nThe Finnish railway network consists of a total of 5,919 km of railways built with Russian gauge track. Passenger trains are operated by the state-owned VR. They serve all the major cities and many rural areas, though railway connections are available to fewer places than bus connections. Most passenger train services originate or terminate at Helsinki Central railway station, and a large proportion of the passenger rail network radiates out of Helsinki. VR also operates freight services. Maintenance and construction of the railway network itself is the responsibility of the Finnish Rail Administration, which is a part of the Finnish Transport Agency (). The network is divided in six areal centres, that manage the use and maintenance of the routes in co-operation. Cargo yards and large stations may have their own signalling systems.\n\nFinnish trains have a reputation for being spacious, comfortable and clean. The scenery surrounding the railway lines is considered to be of outstanding natural beauty, especially in Eastern Finland with its many lakes. Because in most parts of Finland the density of population is low, Finland is not very well suited for railways. Commuter services are nowadays rare outside the Helsinki area, but there are express train connections between most of the cities. As in France, passenger services are mostly connections from various parts of the country to the capital, Helsinki. Currently there are c. 260 passenger round trips driven daily in Finland, excluding Helsinki commuter rail. Nightly passenger trains only operate on the busiest lines between Helsinki or Turku via Oulu to Lapland (minimum distance of c. 650 km (405 mi.)). This leaves most of the tracks free for nightly freight traffic (c.40 M tons/y). In addition there are also good long distance bus and airplane connections, both of which are generally little or a lot more expensive than trains. Buses are sometimes faster and/or cheaper than trains (e.g. Helsinki–Pori).\n\nThe first rail line between Helsinki and Hämeenlinna was opened on January 31, 1862. As Finland was then the Grand Duchy of Finland, a region of Imperial Russia, railways were built to the broad Russian track gauge of . An extension from Riihimäki to the new Finland Station in Saint Petersburg was opened in 1870.\nHowever, the Finnish and Russian rail systems remained unconnected until 1912. Russian trains could not have used the Finnish rail network due to a narrower load gauge. Later the Finnish load gauge was widened to match the Russian load gauge, with hundreds of station platforms or tracks moved further apart from each other.\n\nFurther expansion occurred in the 1800s and by 1900 much of the network had been constructed with 3,300 km of track built.\n\nThe Finland Railway Bridge across the River Neva in Saint Petersburg, opened in 1912, connected the Finnish State Railways to Russian Railways. Following Finnish independence, the Russian part of the line was handed over to Russian authorities.\n\nTrack doubling projects are taking place in various sections of the Finnish rail network. Following a previous project to double the single-line sections of railway from Seinäjoki to Oulu which was completed in 2017, the Luumäki-Imatra(-Simpele) section will be fully doubled by 2023.\n\nSince the 1970s the Finnish Transport Agency has been discussing the possibility of building a second railway line from Helsinki to Turku, allowing for a faster journey time between the two cities. This line is known as the 'ELSA' line, as it would pass through the city of Espoo and the towns of Lohja and Salo. An updated feasibility study was undertaken in 2005, and in 2016 the line was included as a policy in the Finnish Transport Agency's report. This line forms part of the Finnish government's plans to build high-speed rail links from Helsinki to Turku, Tampere and Kouvola.\n\nThe planned Itärata (East Rail) would link Helsinki and Kouvola via Porvoo, shortening journey times to eastern Finnish cities such as Kuopio and Joensuu, along with St Petersburg, Russia. More direct lines from Helsinki to Pori and Jyväskylä have also been studied.\n\nIn November 2017 a freight train left Kouvola between Helsinki and the Russian border carrying 41 containers for Xi’an in China. This was the first freight train of its type to travel between the two countries. The 9,110 km journey via Russia and Kazakhstan is expected to take 17 days, compared to around 30 days by sea and rail. This service is expected to become a daily departure in the coming months.\n\nProposals for a rail link to Lapland in northern Finland, via Kemijärvi or Kolari, from the Norwegian port of Kirkenes are in the planning stages. However, environmental and cultural sensitivities exist which affect these plans, with concerns from the indigenous Sámi people that the proposed line would pass through reindeer grazing lands.\n\nAlso, new rail link from Simpele to Elisenvaara, with track doubling and electrification at 25 kV 50 Hz AC from Elisenvaara via Sortavara and Suoyarvi to Petrozavodsk is now proposed, for passenger trains (with Finnish bilevel coaches) from Helsinki to Petrozavodsk, Kirov, Krasnoyarsk, and Khabarovsk (via Baikal-Amur Mainline).\n\nThe national railway company VR has a monopoly on passenger transport. In Helsinki local traffic, class Sm5 EMUs are owned by Pääkaupunkiseudun Junakalusto Oy, but are operated by VR. The new class Sm6 \"Allegro\" trains are owned and operated by Karelian Trains, a 50/50 joint venture of VR and Russian railway company RZD. The trains are operated by VR personnel while on Finnish soil.\n\nWhile private rail operators can transport freight since 2007, most trains are still run by VR. Ratarahti Oy was granted its safety certificate by the Finnish Transport Safety Agency in September 2011 and it will start shunting work at the Imatra rail yard in 2013, with first test runs on . Proxion Train Oy received its safety certificate in May 2011 and is set to start freight traffic in 2014 after problems with acquiring used equipment from VR. Another new operator, Fenniarail, has found used locomotives in Czech Republic which are convertible to broad gauge, in operation 2016.\n\nVR prefers scrapping unneeded rolling stock rather than selling them, in order to limit competition. Used vehicles can't be imported from other countries because of a different rail gauge which vehicles normally can't be converted to. Used vehicles from former Soviet union do not fulfil Finnish regulations. New locomotives are too expensive since they are not constructed for broad gauge.\n\nOne private railway company exists in Finland, the Karhula–Sunila Railroad, a short branch line with freight traffic only, in Karhula, near Kotka. The branch line is not managed by the Finnish Transport Authority, but by the railway owner.\n\nSeveral museum railways exist that are unrelated to VR Group.\n\n\nWhile some private Finnish railways were electrified already at the end of the 19th century, work on the electrification of the main rail network started only in the late 1960s. Most main lines are now electrified. The system used is 25 kV 50 Hz AC overhead wiring, with wire height normal at and varying from beyond to . The largest class of electric locomotives are the Sr1 locomotives that were taken into use in 1973. They are now supplemented by the Sr2- and Sr3-class electric locomotives and the high-speed Sm3 Pendolino units.\n\nThe first electric trains started to operate on in Helsinki local traffic, initially between Helsinki and Kirkkonummi and slowly extending to Riihimäki on . Heading northwards, the electric wires reached Seinäjoki in 1975, Kokkola in 1981, Oulu in 1983, Rovaniemi in 2004, and their current northernmost point in Kemijärvi in 2014. In addition to the line to Kemijärvi, another line recently electrified was the line from Seinäjoki to Vaasa in 2011.\n\nThe next railway line to be electrified is the railway from Turku to Uusikaupunki, electrification is scheduled to begin in 2019.\n\nThe maximum speed for passenger traffic is , but is achieved only on the Kerava–Lahti railway line. Freight trains have a maximum speed of . Actual speed limits vary depending on the train type and track portion. Some delays can occur in autumn and winter due to weather conditions (e.g. high winds).\n\nThe signalling system used on the railway network in Finland comprises color-light signals and fixed signs. They are used together with ATP-VR/RHK (EBICAB 900), a train protection system usually referred to as JKV () which has to be used on rolling stock. The system is set to be upgraded to ERTMS/ETCS in the upcoming years, however later than in other European countries due to the low age of the current train protection system. The first ETCS units are set to be installed in rolling stock during 2013, and the first ERTMS signalled portion of track should be opened between 2019 and 2025.\n\n\n\nMost passenger rail services in Finland radiate from Helsinki Central, serving most major cities including Tampere, Turku, Oulu, Rovaniemi, Kouvola, Kuopio, Jyväskylä and Joensuu among others. Some towns are connected to the rail network by their own branch lines, yet are not served by passenger trains; examples include Porvoo, Uusikaupunki, Raahe and Rauma.\n\n\nRussia is the most important adjacent country regarding railway traffic. The freight traffic is much more intensive between Russia and Finland, compared to between Sweden and Finland. There are several daily passenger trains between Russia and Finland, but none between Sweden and Finland.\n\n\n"}

From an early age he showed signs of exceptional talent for music although formal training opportunities did not immediately become available to him. In 1892 he was apprenticed to a London concert agency and six years later he attracted the attention of several influential musicians including members of the Rothschild family which enabled him to raise sufficient monies to study at the Royal College of Music in London.\n\nWhile at RCM, Boughton studied under Charles Villiers Stanford and Walford Davies from 1898 to 1901. He later took up ad hoc work first in the pit of the Haymarket Theatre then as official accompanist to the baritone David Ffrangcon-Davies (whose daughter, Gwen, later became associated with the Glastonbury Festivals in her famous role Etain in The Immortal Hour). In 1903, he married former Aylesbury neighbour's daughter, Florence Hobley; he lived to regret the marriage. It was in 1905 (the year he completed his first symphony \"Oliver Cromwell\") that he was approached by Sir Granville Bantock to become a member of staff at the Birmingham and Midland Institute of Music (now the Birmingham Conservatoire).\n\nIt was while at Birmingham (1905 to 1911) that Boughton was presented with many new opportunities and made many friends. He proved an excellent teacher and an outstanding choral conductor which won him much recognition. He was drawn into socialist ideas through the writings of John Ruskin, William Morris, Edward Carpenter and George Bernard Shaw, the last with whom he developed a lifelong relationship. It was also during those years that he became attached to the young art student, Christina Walshe, who was later to become his partner and artistic \"right-hand man\" for his Glastonbury projects. His friendship with Shaw had begun when Boughton had been turned down from his invitation to collaborate on an opera. Shaw initially refused to be associated with any of Boughton's music but Boughton would not be dissuaded and eventually Shaw realised they had something in common that was to endure.\n\nOut of his process of self-discovery and self-education came the artistic aims that were to occupy Boughton for all his life. As a young man, he planned a fourteen-day cycle of dramas on the life of Christ in which the story would be enacted on a small stage in the middle of an orchestra while soloists and the chorus would comment on the action. Although this did not come to anything, the idea remained with him and by 1907 Boughton's discovery of the theories and practises of Richard Wagner, combined with his impression that the church's vision of Christianity had somewhat failed, resulted in another subject – King Arthur.\n\nBased upon the Ring Cycle at Bayreuth, and parallel to the ideas of the young poet Reginald Buckley in his book \"Arthur of Britain\", Boughton set out to create a new form of opera which he later called \"choral drama\". At this point, the three collaborators – Boughton, Buckley and Walshe – sought to establish a national festival of drama. Whilst London's Covent Garden was ideal for the established operatic repertoire, it would not prove to be so for the plans that Boughton and Buckley had and eventually they decided that they should build their own theatre and, using local talent, set up a form of commune or cooperative.\n\nAt first Letchworth Garden City in Hertfordshire was deemed a suitable location for the project (the Arts and Crafts Movement was significant at that time) but they later turned to the Somerset town of Glastonbury, the alleged resting place of King Arthur and in an area steeped in legend. Meanwhile, Sir Dan Godfrey and his Bournemouth orchestra had established a reputation for supporting new English music and it was here where Boughton's first opera from the Arthurian cycle, \"The Birth of Arthur\", received its first performance. It was also at Bournemouth where Boughton's 2nd Symphony had a first hearing and \"The Queen of Cornwall\" performed for the first time using an orchestra, and attended by Thomas Hardy on whose poem the opera was based.\n\nBy 1911, Boughton had resigned from Birmingham and moved to Glastonbury where, together with Walshe and Buckley, he began to focus on establishing the country's first national annual summer school of music. The first production was not the projected Arthurian Cycle but that of Boughton's new choral-drama, \"The Immortal Hour\", composed in 1912, which with a national appeal to raise funds was produced with the full backing of Sir Granville Bantock, Thomas Beecham, John Galsworthy, Eugene Goossens, Gustav Holst, Dame Ethel Smyth and Shaw and others. Sir Edward Elgar promised to lay the foundation stone and Beecham to lend his London orchestra. However, in August 1914, the month set for the opening of the first production, World War 1 had been declared and the full plans had to be postponed. Boughton, however, was determined to proceed and the Festival began and in place of Beecham's orchestra, he used a grand piano and instead of a theatre, the local Assembly Rooms that were to remain the centre of activities until the end of the Festivals in 1926, by which time Boughton had mounted over 350 staged works, 100 chamber concerts, a number of exhibitions and a series of lectures and recitals – something never previously witnessed in England. In 1922, Boughton's Festival Players went on tour and became established at Bristol in the Folk Festival House (now demolished) and at Bournemouth.\n\nThe most notable and most successful of Boughton's works is the opera \"The Immortal Hour\", an adaptation of the play by Fiona Macleod (the pseudonym of William Sharp) based on Celtic mythology. Having been successful in Glastonbury and well received in Birmingham, the director of the then new Birmingham Repertory Theatre, Barry Jackson, decided to take the Glastonbury Festival Players' production to London where it achieved the record breaking run of over 600 performances. On its arrival at the Regent Theatre in 1922, it secured an initial run of over 200 consecutive performances and a further 160 in 1923, with a highly successful revival in 1932. People came to see the opera on more than one occasion (including members of the Royal family) and especially to see and hear the young Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies whose portrayal as Etain began her professional acting career.\n\nIn addition to \"The Immortal Hour\" and \"Bethlehem\", his other operas \"The Queen of Cornwall\" (1924) based on Thomas Hardy's play, and \"Alkestis\" (1922) based on Gilbert Murray's translation of the Greek play \"Alcestis\", by Euripides (which was performed at Covent Garden by the British National Opera Company and was broadcast by the nascent British Broadcasting Company, both in 1924), were also very well received. These latter works have not been publicly heard since the mid-1960s when the original Boughton Trust, organised by Adolph Borsdorf, sponsored professional concert performances in London and Street in Somerset.\n\nThe downfall of the Glastonbury Festivals was hastened when Boughton, sympathising with the miners' lock-out and general strike of 1926, insisted on staging his very popular Nativity opera \"Bethlehem\" (1915) at Church House, Westminster, London, with Jesus born in a miner's cottage and Herod as a top-hatted capitalist, flanked by soldiers and police. The event caused much embarrassment to the people of Glastonbury who withdrew their support from Boughton, causing the Festival Players to go into liquidation.\n\nFrom 1927 until his death in 1960, Boughton lived at Kilcot, near Newent in Gloucestershire where he completed the last two operas of his Arthurian cycle (\"Avalon\" and \"Galahad\", which to this day have not been performed) and produced some of his finest works, the quality of which has only been realised within the past twenty years. These include his 2nd and 3rd symphonies (the latter was first performed at the London Kingsway Theatre in 1939 in the presence of, among others, Ralph Vaughan Williams, Clarence Raybould and Alan Bush), a number of pieces for oboe (including two concertos, one dedicated to his talented daughter Joy Boughton and the other to Léon Goossens), chamber music and a number of orchestral pieces. In 1934 and 1935, Boughton attempted to repeat his earlier successes at Glastonbury with festivals commissioned at Stroud and Bath, and these saw the release of new works, \"The Lily Maid\" (the third opera in the Arthurian Cycle) and \"The Ever Young\". Boughton's reputation was, however, affected by his political leanings towards Communism, and his music was subsequently neglected for the next forty years. Boughton died at the home of his daughter, Joy, in Barnes, London, in 1960.\n\n\nThe Rutland Boughton Music Trust was established in 1978, the year of the composer's Centenary, to encourage performances and sponsor recordings of his works. Many of these, including some world premieres, now appear on disc with the Hyperion Records label. The \"Oliver Cromwell\" symphony – first heard in 2005 – and three of the \"Songs of the English\" (last heard around 1904/5) have been released by Dutton, as well as a selection of Songs for mezzo and pianoforte on the British Music Society's own label. Dutton has also released the world premiere recording of Boughton's adaptation of Thomas Hardy's play, \"The Queen of Cornwall\", sponsored by the Trust.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViolin Sonata (1921)\n\n\n\nMost of Boughton's original manuscript scores can be viewed at the British Library, Euston Road, London.\n\nEnquiries about the availability of scores for performance should be made to The Rutland Boughton Music Trust or in some cases via the appropriate publisher.\n\n\n\"Rutland Boughton Promotions\" - Ian R Boughton, Director.

{"id": "2086103", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2086103", "title": "Hulkling", "text": "Hulkling\n\nHulkling (Dorrek VIII, also known as Theodore \"Teddy\" Altman) is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character has been depicted as a member of the Young Avengers, a team of superheroes in the Marvel Universe. Hulkling's character is patterned on the Hulk. He has shapeshifting abilities that go far beyond the ability to mimic the Hulk, and superhuman strength.\n\nHulkling was created by writer Allan Heinberg and artist Jim Cheung and first was in \"Young Avengers\" #1 (April 2005) along with other teenage heroes patterned after founding Avengers members.\n\nHulkling was originally planned to be a female character. According to Tom Brevoort, \"Originally, Allan pitched Hulkling as a female character using her shape-changing abilities to pose as a man. I suspect this was as close as Allan felt he could get to depicting an openly gay relationship in a Marvel comic. But as we got underway... he started to have second thoughts and approached me about maintaining Hulkling and Wiccan as two involved male characters\".\n\nHe was also featured in \"\" and appeared in the \"Civil War\" crossover event.\n\nHulkling most recently appeared in the 2013 \"Young Avengers\" series by Kieron Gillen and Jamie McKelvie, and appeared with Wiccan in New Avengers as part of All-New All-Different Marvel.\n\nIn his first appearance, little is revealed about Hulkling except for the fact he is raised by a single mother. All this changes when the shapeshifting extraterrestrial known as the Super-Skrull appears, stating that Teddy is a Skrull. The Super-Skrull is surprised to learn that Teddy has super strength and wonders \"perhaps the rumors about his father are true.\" The Super Skrull follows the Young Avengers to Wiccan's house, where Teddy's mother is waiting for him. The Super-Skrull releases a device designed to turn Teddy into his true form in an attempt to prove his Skrull heritage. While the device does not change Teddy's physical appearance, Ms. Altman, who is also caught in the device's beam, turns into a Skrull. When the Super-Skrull accuses her of being a traitor to her race, she responds by saying that the Empress ordered her to protect Teddy, even from the likes of the Super-Skrull, pulling out a gun. The Super-Skrull responds by killing her, though it was unintentional.\n\nThe Super-Skrull reveals that, years ago, during the Kree-Skrull War, he kidnapped Captain Mar-Vell, Quicksilver, and the Scarlet Witch, presenting them to the Skrull Emperor Dorrek VII. Though the heroes later escaped, the Emperor's daughter Princess Anelle conceived a child with Mar-Vell. At birth, the child was marked for death by Dorrek VII. However, his nurse smuggled him to Earth and raised him as Teddy.\n\nThe Super-Skrull reveals that his intention is to bring Teddy back to the Empire so that he may unify his people. However, Kree soldiers arrive to take Teddy as one of their own. A battle erupts between the Kree and the Skrull. Teddy ends the conflict by surrendering himself. It is settled that Teddy will spend half an Earth-year with the Kree and the other half with the Skrull, at which time he will declare his ultimate allegiance. However, the \"Teddy\" that left Earth is actually the Super-Skrull in disguise. The real Teddy remains on Earth.\n\nAlong with the rest of his team, Hulkling sides with Secret Avengers against the Superhuman Registration Act during the \"Civil War\" storyline. He plays a pivotal role in Captain America's plan for the final confrontation with Iron Man's forces, impersonating Yellowjacket in order to free the imprisoned heroes of Prison 42.\n\nHulkling contacts the mysteriously revived Captain Marvel to confront him about his identity as Mar-Vell's son. Mar-Vell confirms the Super Skrull's story concerning Teddy's origins and that he could be Teddy's father, though he was unaware of Teddy's existence because he and the Skrull Princess Anelle never saw each other again. Mar-Vell comforts a frustrated Teddy, who is upset at Mar-Vell's intention to return to the past, expressing an interest in spending more time with him before he dies. Later, Teddy asserts that he never saw Mar-Vell alive again.\n\nTeddy exhibits frustration with being essentially orphaned during the events of \"Family Matters\" and his hopes of establishing a father-son relationship with Mar-Vell, his last remaining parent. Later storylines reveal that the \"revived\" Captain Marvel that Teddy met was a Skrull imposter named Khn'nr, intended by Skrull scientists to impersonate the original Kree soldier. Due to some misprogramming, the Skrull actually believed himself to be Mar-Vell.\n\nIn the \"Children's Crusade: Young Avengers One Shot\" a future version of Teddy is shown to have taken up the mantle of Captain Marvel wearing a version of his father's classic costume with the white and green coloring of his original Kree uniform.\n\nThe Young Avengers confront a group of rampaging super-powered Skrulls. He tries to use his Skrull heritage to calm them but is instead battered down with energy blasts. It was revealed that Veranke and a few higher up in position of the invasion have specifically ordered Teddy's death, without informing the soldiers of his royal heritage, for fear that it could confuse and divide the loyalties of their soldiers. Teddy is saved from execution at the last second by Xavin. With the aid of Xavin, Speed and Wiccan, Hulkling survives an attack by X'iv, a Skrull assassin with the powers of Daredevil, Elektra, and Cloak and Dagger.\nLater a Skrull reveals to Hulkling, Wiccan and Hawkeye that taking over the Earth was the last chance they had since all their planets have been destroyed.\n\nHulkling is featured in the \"Original Sins\" mini-series as part of the \"Original Sin\" storyline. With his friends Marvel Boy and Prodigy (David Alleyne), Hulkling tries to save innocent people from being overwhelmed by cosmic secrets that are driving them insane.\n\nAs part of the \"All-New, All-Different Marvel\" event, Hulkling (alongside Wiccan) became a member of Sunspot's New Avengers. Eventually, a small group of Kree–Skrull hybrids arrive on Earth and kidnap Teddy so that he can assume his position as king and unite the two warring alien races. Teddy gains the sword of the prior king and uses it to defeat ghost wizard Moridun but announces that he has commitments to protect Earth and will return to fulfill his destiny if and when he is ready. Later, he manages to rescue Billy who was taken over by Moridun by convincing him to fight.\n\nTeddy later accepts his heritage and the mantle of \"Dorrek VIII\", and, at the cost of leaving Billy, becomes the new ruler of the Kree-Skrull Alliance, upon which he begins preparations to invade Earth for \"the final war\".\n\nExchanges between Wiccan (when Wiccan was known as Asgardian) and Hulkling (and the latter's character design) in early issues of \"Young Avengers\" led some readers to speculate that the two young men had a much more intimate bond than mere friendship. As early as \"Young Avengers\" #2, each issue's letters page included an exchange of reader opinions between people who supported and people who were against the portrayal of gay superheroes. Allan Heinberg confirmed this speculation at a San Diego convention panel, stating that his intent was to reveal the relationship in issue #12, and he was surprised that his subtle clues were picked up on so quickly.\n\nIn \"Young Avengers Special\", the team agrees to give an interview to Kat Farrell and Jessica Jones, and warns Billy and Teddy that Farrell will probably ask if the rumors about them are true. After some deliberation, the two decide to tell her, referencing one of Marvel's most prominent gay superheroes when Teddy adds, \"Why should Northstar have all the fun?\"\n\nIn \"Cable & Deadpool\" #30, Deadpool is caught by Captain America's Secret Avengers, with whom the Young Avengers had merged. Deadpool, a typical breaker of the fourth wall, made a subtle dig at Hulkling and Wiccan's sexuality by referring to the team as \"...The Ripe, Nubile Young Avengers! And I'm especially discomfited to admit that Wiccan and Hulkling are looking especially nubile...\"\n\nIn \"Avengers: The Children's Crusade\" #9, Teddy proposes to Billy and the two share their first on-panel kiss.\n\nIn \"New Avengers\", the hybrids refer to Teddy as King Dorrek VIII and Billy as his \"prince consort\". A flashforward to 20XX shows an older Billy and Teddy living happily together with a daughter, Katie.\n\nHulkling is the extraterrestrial hybrid offspring of an enhanced Kree warrior, Captain Marvel, and Skrull royalty, Princess Anelle, resulting in various abilities derived from the unique combination of his parents' genetic material. His powers exceed those of ordinary individuals of either race; they most likely are much stronger than those of other potential hybrids due to his father's various enhancements prior to Hulkling's conception. His shape-shifting and accelerated healing factor derive from his Skrull heritage, while his superhuman strength originates from his enhanced Kree background.\n\nHis shape-shifting abilities allow him to impersonate others, independently alter parts of his body, and manifest different physical abilities. For example, he can form claws, extend his reach, create body armor, and grow wings (which enable him to fly). Hulkling can use his shapeshifting to increase his body's density and composition, giving him a very strong resistance to pain and injury. He is able to withstand great impact forces, such as falls from great heights, repeated bludgeoning from superhumanly strong beings, and powerful energy blasts without sustaining injury. High caliber bullets and bladed weapons are also unable to pierce his skin. Hulkling's shapeshifting also demonstrated the ability to operate without his conscious thought in order to protect himself from injury; his body shifted its biomass to protect vital organs, while the Warden of The Cube was attempting to vivisect him in .\n\nHis healing factor allows him to heal wounds quickly, but not on a scale with Wolverine or Hulk.\n\nHulkling's alien anatomy also prevents him from being controlled by pheromone-based powers, such as those used by Daken. \nIn recent stories Teddy has come into possession of Excelsior, a mystical cosmic sword owned by his ancestor Dorrek Supreme, which only passes down to those of Dorrek's line. Its wielder, as unmitigated ruler of both Kree and Skrull and Lord of the Knights of Infinity, is entitled to inherit rulership of the entire cosmos.\n\nIts skein alone has arcane abilities such as negating and absorbing magic as well as canceling out eldritch entities (i.e., an entity from the universe before the present one) using its knife edge.\n\nIn the one-shot \"Avengers Fairy Tales\", Hulkling appears as The Hatter in an adaptation of \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\".\n\nHulkling is one of the 142 superhumans who are registered, implying he had joined the Initiative. Hulkling is seen briefly in Camp Hammond. However, this version of Hulkling was from another dimension who later returned to Earth-A, and the real Hulkling remains unregistered.\n\nOn Earth-15061 (which takes place in an alternate future in the year 20XX), Dorrek VIII is a member of that reality's version of the Avengers under the name \"King Hulk\".\n\nHulkling is seen briefly in the \"Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness\" mini-series. While Ashley G. Williams is trying to save the city, he confronts a zombified Hulkling. With little effort, he chainsaws off his arms and head, and destroys the zombie.\n\n\n\n"}

It is between Godalming and Guildford. It has a medieval church and a close connection to fine art and pottery, being the later life home of artist George Frederic Watts. The village has considerable woodland and agriculture, and the undeveloped portions are in the Metropolitan Green Belt. The village is traversed by the North Downs Way and has a large western conservation area. Central to the village are the Watts Gallery, the cemetery chapel commissioned by his wife for him, two inns and the parish church.\n\nThe village is just off the Compton junction of the A3 road and is crossed parallel to its linear street by the North Downs Way. Compton contains the Watts Mortuary Chapel, built to the memory of Symbolist painter George Frederic Watts, a resident of the village. Development can be classed as ribbon development around the through road, the 2001 census gives a population of 972 living in 384 households. The maximum elevation is on the Hog's Back at 152m, the minimum at a small brook flowing east of the village centre, at its lowest on outflow at 45m above sea level.\n\nThe western part of the village forms a conservation area (as well as a very small eastern part between The Avenue and Compton Wood).\n\nRelics from the structure of the tower of the village's church, St Nicholas', suggest that the area was settled during the period of Roman occupation of Britain. Compton appears in Domesday Book of as \"Conton(e)\". It was held by Walter, son of Othere. Its domesday assets were: 11 hides; 1 church, 9 ploughs, of meadow. It rendered £9.\n\nSt Nicholas' Church contains one of the oldest surviving carved Norman screens. The basic structure, including the tower, is Anglo-Saxon, but it has been much altered over the centuries. For example, the influence of the Normans can be seen in the arches, the timber roofing (thought to date back to 1165) and the unique carved wooden screen in the chancel. Other features were added in the generations that followed, such as the spire (14th century), the pulpit and the clock (17th century). The church is grade I.\n\nOn the outskirts of Compton is the 16th century stately home Loseley Park. The Great Hall contains panelling taken from Henry VIII's palace at Nonsuch Park.\n\nThe Withies Inn is one of the oldest buildings in the village. Just off the main road, it was built in the 16th century.\n\nThe manor of Field Place was bought in 1709 by the London publisher Samuel Manship (1665-1720), passing to his widow Anne and then their son John. His son John only had one child Anne, who eloped, and the manor was sold.\n\nThe ashes of Aldous Huxley were brought from the US on 27 October 1971 and interred in his parents' grave at Watts Cemetery.\n\nOne of Compton’s most decorated residents by his profession was the artist who was primarily a painter, George Frederic Watts, who lived his later life at a house he called \"Limnerslease\", close to which is the early 20th century Watts Gallery, dedicated to his work. The gallery is open to visitors. After his death, Watts Mortuary Chapel and cloister designed by his wife Mary Seton Watts were built on a hill overlooking the village. Among his subjects were \"Hope\" (part of his \"House of Life\" cycle), \"Orpheus and Eurydice\" and \"Dante Gabriel Rossetti\".\n\nThe Compton Potters' Arts Guild was formed in 1899 by Mary Fraser-Tytler (her name before marriage to G. F. Watts) and initially used a source of local clay discovered during the building of Limnerslease. It continued until 1954.\n\nArtist and historian Mary Wondrausch lives and works in the parish at the site of a former brickworks. Made of local clay from the foundations of the pottery of Mary Wondrausch, sculptor Jon Edgar's Compton Triptych was unveiled in November 2011. The three terracotta heads celebrate the parish of Compton and the diverse figures who have contributed to this community.\n\nArthur Conan Doyle's novels \"Sir Nigel\" and \"The White Company\" refer to the key characters Nigel Loring and Mary Loring, their daughter Maude and her husband Alleyne Edricson, 'their children and children’s children' as having their dust laid unmarked and unbrassed before the steps of the ancient altar of Compton Church. The archer Samkin Aylward is marked by a mound near the old yew in the churchyard. A production company was registered in late 1960s until the 1970s as Sir Nigel Films/Compton Films and produced \"The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes\". Compton is the home village of characters described in Freeman Wills Crofts' 1933 murder mystery \"The Hog's Back Mystery\".\n\nThe proportion of households in Compton who owned their home outright was 8% above the regional average. The proportion who owned their home with a loan was 3.6% lower than the regional average; social housing formed 13.7% of homes, providing overall a greater proportion of social rented housing and lower proportion of privately rented housing relative to the average of Surrey, the district and of the United Kingdom.\n\nThe average level of accommodation in the region composed of detached houses was 28%, the average that was apartments was 22.6%.\n\nCompton is in Guildford (UK Parliament constituency), which since its inception has fluctuated between political parties. Local government is administered by Guildford Borough Council and Surrey County Council.\n\nAt Surrey County Council, one of the 81 representatives represents the area within the \"Shalford\" division.\n\nAt Guildford Borough Council small wards of the borough are deemed appropriate to be best represented under the current constitution of councillors by two councillors.\n\n\n\n"}

Formerly carrying U.S. Route 91, which had been the main highway between Los Angeles and Salt Lake City, it has been bypassed by Interstate 15 and serves mainly local traffic.\n\nState Route 604 exists in two discontinuous sections. The first is a section of Las Vegas Boulevard at the intersection of Tropicana Avenue.\n\nThe second is the section of Las Vegas Boulevard going northeast from Carey Avenue in North Las Vegas. SR 604 enters the unincorporated town of Sunrise Manor, where it has intersections at Cheyenne Avenue (SR 574), Lamb Boulevard (SR 610) and Nellis Boulevard (SR 612). After that, SR 604 then passes Nellis Air Force Base where it intersects Craig Road (SR 573) and the main entrance of Nellis AFB. The highway then continues northeast as SR 604 passes the Las Vegas Motor Speedway and later re-enters an undeveloped area of the city of North Las Vegas. The highway leaves the city of North Las Vegas shortly after just before SR 604 ends at Interstate 15 at exit 58 near Apex. The I-15 frontage road stretching northeast 11.823 miles (19.027 km) from Apex to a point between Garnet and Crystal is also state maintained as FRCL07, and was mileposted as SR 604.\n\nState Route 604 was created in the 1970s from what had been State Route 6 between Jean, where it intersected with State Route 161, and a point north of Las Vegas. However, it has been truncated over time, as segments were given to the city of Las Vegas and Clark County to maintain. Recently, the portion between Jean, Nevada and Russell Road was given to Clark County. The portion of Las Vegas Boulevard between Tonopah Avenue and Carey Street was turned over to local control by 2017, though the 2017 NDOT map of Northeast Las Vegas still shows state jurisdiction extending south to Tonopah Avenue. From the mid-1980s to 2005, this highway was used as the course for the start and a significant portion of the Las Vegas Marathon.\n\n"}

He was the inventor of the \"planh\" (the Provençal dirge), of the \"tenso\" (a sort of rhymed debate in which two poets write one stanza each) and perhaps of the \"sirventes\".\n\nMost of the information about Cercamon's life is nothing but rumour and conjecture; some of his contemporaries credit him as Marcabru's mentor, and some circumstantial evidence points to his dying on crusade as a follower of Louis VII of France.\n\nAbout seven of his lyrics survive, but not a single melody; the works that most contributed to his fame among his contemporaries, his \"pastoretas\" or pastourelles, are lost.\n\"Cercamon\" means \"world searcher\" in medieval Occitan.\n\n\n"}

The results of a DNA test confirm that Jason is indeed Picard's son, but Picard's attempts to bond with Jason prove difficult, and he is dismayed to discover that Jason has a criminal record, having been convicted of petty theft and trespassing. Meanwhile, Bok beams to the \"Enterprise\" twice (using subspace transport technology) to repeat his threats, and Jason suffers attacks from an unknown disease.\n\nFinally, Bok beams Jason off the \"Enterprise\" and onto his own ship. La Forge determines that the transport is occurring via a small transport platform, and that research into subspace transporter technology was abandoned by the Federation because of its extreme unreliability and high energy requirements.\n\nPicard then beams to Bok's ship via the Ferengi's own subspace transporter, where he confronts Bok and three other Ferengi and reveals that Dr. Crusher has discovered that Jason Vigo is \"not\", in fact, Picard's son. Bok had resequenced Jason's DNA so that Picard would know how it felt to lose a son, but Bok's technique was flawed, and the deception was exposed when Crusher determined that Jason's disease was normally inherited, yet neither his mother nor Picard had it.\n\nRealizing that there was no profit to be earned from Bok's revenge scheme, the three other Ferengi then disarm Bok and release Jason. Later, in the transporter room, Picard finally bonds with his 'son' by presenting him with a Gorlan prayer stick, a rare artifact that Picard had traded a valuable bottle of Saurian brandy to obtain. Jason is sincerely touched by Picard's generosity, suggesting that should Picard be in the area, he should look Jason up.\n\n\n"}

The series was created by Thomas W. Lynch, the creator of \"The Secret World of Alex Mack\" and \"The Journey of Allen Strange\". It was the final series to launch on Fox Kids, as the block folded only 7 months after its debut.\n\nThe show is centered upon Nick Bluetooth, a 15-year-old boy led (with his best friend Allegra Zane) by an extraterrestrial map to a spacecraft nicknamed the Egg, which moves them into an \"Outer Dimension\" threatened by Gorm. They are now there to protect the story's eponymous dimension. To defeat Gorm, Nick must find all the pieces of a key that will unlock the sealed gates to the kingdom of Galidor, one of many realms comprising the dimension.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA licensed Galidor-themed Lego toy line of the same name was produced by the Lego Group in 2002. Unlike other Lego themes, these were simply action figures with swappable body parts, akin to a simplified version of Lego's Bionicle theme. The theme was considered a commercial failure, due to bad design choices and lack of compatibility with other Lego themes. Only 15 sets were released overall, with 2 sets in limited quantities and 2 sets cancelled immediately.\n\nAn eponymous video game adaption of \"Galidor\" was developed for Game Boy Advance by Tiertex Design Studios, and for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2 and GameCube by Asylum Entertainment. In May 2002, publisher Electronic Arts first displayed the Game Boy Advance and PlayStation 2 versions at E3 2002. The Game Boy Advance game was released by Lego Interactive and Electronic Arts on October 29, 2002 to the North American market. The game received a mixed reception, with reviews usually citing repetitive gameplay and unresponsive controls. Asylum Entertainment's take on the game was initially scheduled for a release in early 2003, and in July 2003, Electronic Arts announced that would be released in September of that year; however, on September 3, 2003, Asylum Entertainment announced that, due to financial instability, they had cancelled their \"Galidor\" game for all platforms, and laid off the game's team. The unfinished PC version was eventually found in various budget re-releases of individual Lego video games, or Lego video game bundles, released by Focus Multimedia and ValuSoft in Europe and North America, respectively.\n\n"}

{"id": "2086192", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2086192", "title": "Timbers Army", "text": "Timbers Army\n\nThe Timbers Army is an independent supporters group of Portland Timbers, a soccer club in Major League Soccer—the top tier of the United States soccer pyramid. Its members are known for their loud, enthusiastic support and the raucous atmosphere they create at Timbers games. Centered in section 107 of Providence Park in Portland, Oregon, the Army has grown steadily over the years to encompass much of the north end of the stadium.\n\nThe Timbers Army was founded in 2001 as the Cascade Rangers, a reference to the Cascade Range of mountains in the Pacific Northwest region of North America. The group began with a group of eight people who decided to step up their support, and began congregating in section 107 (erroneously labeled on the stadium diagram to be behind the north goal) of the stadium then known as PGE Park to create a European-style rooting section for the club, complete with drumming, flags, scarves, smoke bombs and constant chanting and cheering. By 2002, the group had changed its name to the Timbers Army in order to lose any perception of partiality toward Scottish football club Rangers and because the Timbers uniforms at the time resembled those of Rangers rival Celtic. although this perception has since changed.\n\nAs noted in a feature story on the front page of \"The Oregonian\"'s Sports section in 2004, the Army had grown from a small group of dedicated fans to approximately 200 passionate supporters. By 2005, when the Army was the subject of a cover story by \"Willamette Week\", its game day support was estimated at over 1,000.\n\nIn 2008, the group's lobbying was credited with helping to convince the Portland City Council to approve a deal to bring Major League Soccer to Portland in 2011. The Timbers Army were named the fifth most influential Oregon sports figure in 2010 by \"The Oregonian\", two spots ahead of Timbers owner Merritt Paulson. In the piece, sports columnist John Canzano said of the Army:Drumming, chanting, scarf-wearing soccer supporters transformed overnight from a band of PGE Park rowdies to an effective and influential political organization. Their political clout ends up greasing the wheels on the effort to bring Major League Soccer to Portland.\nThe supporters group gained national exposure in 2009 when they were featured in a two-page photo spread in the July 13–20 issue of \"Sports Illustrated\" which showed Army members celebrating after the Timbers scored against Seattle Sounders FC of MLS in the third round of the 2009 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup, a game they lost 2-1. A tifo created by the Timbers Army for that game was in 2011 named one of the five best tifos in MLS history—it featured a giant Timber Jim chainsawing down Seattle's Space Needle—despite the Timbers having played in the USL at the time.\n\nThe Timbers Army has a strong history and culture of vocal support. The Timbers Army have utilized chants from all over the world (ex. \"Guinness Boys\", \"Korobeiniki\"), as well as having drums and trumpets to add to the noise in addition to the inclusion of pogoing, scarf waving, and dancing to add to the effect of various chants. Timbers Army traditions are to sing the song \"Portland Boys\" immediately after kickoff, \"Rose City 'Til I Die\" when a goal is scored against the Timbers, \"You Are My Sunshine\" in the 80th minute, and \"Can't Help Falling In Love\" in the 85th minute. Various other chants are drawn from Russian, Greek, Latin American, Italian, and Arabian origins, speaking to the diversity of the section.\n\nThe group engages in a number of charitable activities, including volunteering for the Portland-based nonprofit Friends of Trees and raising money for a trust fund established for Keiana Serrill, the granddaughter of Timber Jim, the team's lumberjack mascot. Timber Jim's daughter, Hannah, was killed in an automobile accident in 2004, and in her memory, the TA has made a tradition of singing \"You Are My Sunshine.\" Timber Jim retired in 2008, but the tradition is carried on by Jim's successor, \"Timber Joey.\"\n\nIn 2010, the Timbers Army established 107 Independent Supporters Trust, or 107ist, in order to plan tifo, bus trips to away matches, and charitable work.\n\nThe Timbers Army is composed of several different subgroups. These subgroups are unique in their own fashion and consist of many different personalities. However, all subgroups fall under the Timbers Army umbrella. Many of the subgroups produce their own special apparel and other items while the proceeds go directly back to Timbers Army causes. Unlike many teams in Major League Soccer, the Timbers Army is the only recognized independent supporters group of the Portland Timbers, while many other clubs have several supporters groups. The subgroups of the Timbers Army rival the size of many other supporters groups in MLS.\n\n\nGeographical\n\nThe Timbers Army fields seven affiliated supporters teams that play in the Greater Portland Soccer District, a Portland area adult soccer league. All teams play a Spring and Fall season as well as participating in the Clive Charles Memorial North End Cup. This tournament is a point based competition between all teams with the winner going on to represent the Timbers Army against a Seattle Sounders Emerald City Supporters team in a supporters Cascadian Champions League. All players are required to be 107ist members, as well as each team performing service related to Timbers Army causes.\n\nTimbers Army Affiliate Teams\n\nIn late August 2005, \"The Oregonian\" ran an article that criticized the Army's use of profanity in their chants. In this instance, then-General Manager Jim Taylor stated that \"People should not come to a sporting event or any event and have to listen to this kind of language... There is no explaining away the actions of that group. It's unacceptable.\"\n\nSports columnist for \"The Oregonian\", John Canzano, received a copy of an email in May 2009 that had been sent to the Timbers front office from a family who had attended a Timbers match at PGE Park. The family, who likened the Timbers Army to hooligans in the letter, were turned off by the Army's use of foul language and called the group \"a bunch of angry white guys tanked up on liquor.\" An email exchange between the family and Timbers owner Merritt Paulson followed, which Canzano published in his column. Paulson did not condone the profanity but did say: \"the Timbers Army is far from being made up of hooligans and MLS soccer teams would be ecstatic to have a supporters groups like the TA which provides an authentic soccer ambience second to none in the US\".\n\nThe 107 Independent Supporters Trust is a member-based non-profit organization open to anyone who loves soccer. It serves to coordinate the activities of the Timbers Army and Rose City Riveters. In addition to supporting the Timbers, the 107ists conduct a variety of community projects including free CPR training in English and Spanish, they manage a library of soccer books, support the Gisele Currier Scholarship Fund, build youth soccer fields and more.\n\nThe Rose City Riveters is the supporters group of Portland Thorns FC, Portland's National Women's Soccer League club.\n\n\n"}

She gave birth on 28 August 1605 to Nurhaci's 12th son, Ajige, on 17 November 1612 to his 14th son, Dorgon, and on 2 April 1614 to his 15th son, Dodo.\n\nLady Ula Nara was forced to commit suicide on 1 October 1626 by her stepsons (including Hong Taiji) because they feared that she might be a barrier to Hong Taiji's succession.\n\nDuring the early reign of the Shunzhi Emperor, Dorgon served as Prince-Regent for the underage emperor.

{"id": "2086214", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2086214", "title": "Danube Swabians", "text": "Danube Swabians\n\nThe Danube Swabians () is a collective term for the ethnic German-speaking population who lived in various countries of southeastern Europe, especially in the Danube River valley, first in the 12th century, and in greater numbers in the 17th and 18th centuries. Most were descended from late 18th-century settlers recruited by Austria-Hungary to repopulate the area and restore agriculture after the expulsion of the Ottoman Empire. They were able to keep their language and religion and initially developed strongly German communities in the region.\n\nThe Danube Swabians are considered the most recent group of ethnic German people to emerge in Europe. In the 21st century, they are made up of ethnic Germans from many former and present-day countries: Germans of Hungary; Satu Mare Swabians; the Banat Swabians; and the Vojvodina Germans of Serbia's Vojvodina and Croatia's Slavonia, especially those in the Osijek region. They called themselves \"Schwowe\" in a Germanized spelling, or \"Shvoveh\" in an English spelling; in the singular first person, a Danube Swabian identified as a \"Schwob\" or a \"Shwobe\". \n\nIn Serbo-Croatian, Danube Swabians, alongside the local populace would refer to them as Švabo, or Njemci, referring to their ethnic origin. However, the Carpathian Germans and Transylvanian Saxons are not included within the Danube Swabian group. Moreover, due to the waning population of Danube Swabians within the Balkans, the word Švabo refers to the diaspora community of Balkan people working in Germany, or Austria.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire following the First World War, the settlement areas of the Danube Swabians were divided into three parts by the Allied Powers. One part remained with Hungary, the second part was allocated to Romania, and the third part fell to the newly established state of Yugoslavia. In this atmosphere of ethnic nationalism, the Danube Swabians had to fight for legal equality as citizens and for the preservation of their cultural traditions. In the 1930s, Nazi Germany promoted National Socialist ideas to the Danube Swabians and claimed the right to protect them as part of its reason for expanding into eastern Europe.\n\nThe Danube Swabians faced particular challenges in the Second World War, when the Axis powers, including Germany, overran many of the nations where they lived. While they were initially favored by the occupiers, some were moved from their homes. As the war progressed and Germany needed more soldiers, the men were conscripted. Many atrocities took place during and after the war, as a result of the complicated allegiances and the brutality of the Nazis. \n\nToward the end of the Second World War, tens of thousands of Danube Swabians fled west ahead of the advancing Soviet army. After the war, the remaining Danube Swabians were disfranchised, their property seized, and many were deported to labor camps in the Soviet Union. Hungary expelled half of its ethnic Germans. In Yugoslavia, the local \"ethnic Germans\" were collectively blamed for the actions of Nazi Germany and branded as war criminals. Immediately after the end of the war, partisan troops conducted mass executions of numerous Yugoslav Danube Swabians. Survivors were later confined to labor and internment camps by the Yugoslavian authorities. Following the dissolution of the camps, the majority of the remaining Yugoslav Danube Swabians left the country, seeking refuge in Germany, other parts of Europe, and the United States.\n\nOf the 1.4 to 1.5 million pre-war population of Danube Swabians, the overwhelming majority of the survivors resettled in German-speaking countries: about 660,000 in Germany and about 150,000 in Austria. Danube Swabians also resettled in the United States, Canada, Brazil, Argentina, and Australia. Diaspora Danube Swabians maintain their language and customs in numerous societies and clubs. The number of organizations is shrinking as the generations that lived in the Danube Swabian homelands die.\n\nBeginning in the 12th century, German merchants and miners began to settle in the Kingdom of Hungary at the invitation of the Hungarian monarchy (\"see Ostsiedlung\"). Although there were significant colonies of Carpathian Germans in the Spiš mountains and Transylvanian Saxons in Transylvania, German settlement throughout the rest of the kingdom had not been extensive until this time.\n\nDuring the 17th–18th centuries, warfare between the Habsburg Monarchy and the Ottoman Empire devastated and depopulated much of the lands of the Danube valley, referred to geographically as the Pannonian plain. The Habsburgs ruling Austria and Hungary at the time resettled the land with people of various ethnicities recruited from the Austro-Hungarian Empire of the Habsburgs, including Magyars, Czechs, Slovaks, Croats, Serbs, Romanians, Ukrainians, and Germanic settlers from Swabia, Hesse, Palatinate, Baden, Franconia, Bavaria, Austria, and Alsace-Lorraine. Despite differing origins, the new immigrants were all referred to as Swabians by their neighbor Serbs, Hungarians, and Romanians. The Bačka settlers called themselves \"Schwoweh,\" the plural of \"Schwobe\" in the polyglot language that evolved there. The majority of them boarded boats in Ulm, Swabia, and traveled to their new destinations down the Danube River in boats called \"Ulmer Schachteln\". The Austro-Hungarian Empire had given them funds to build their boats for transport.\n\nThe first wave of resettlement came after the Ottoman Turks were gradually being forced back after their defeat at the Battle of Vienna in 1683. The settlement was encouraged by nobility, whose lands had been devastated through warfare, and by military officers including Prince Eugene of Savoy and Claudius Mercy. Many Germans settled in the Bakony (\"Bakonywald\") and Vértes (\"Schildgebirge\") mountains north and west of Lake Balaton (\"Plattensee\"), as well as around the town Buda (\"Ofen\"), now part of Budapest. The area of heaviest German colonization during this period was in the Swabian Turkey (\"Schwäbische Türkei\"), a triangular region between the Danube River, Lake Balaton, and the Drava (\"Drau\") River. Other areas settled during this time by Germans were Pécs (\"Fünfkirchen\"), Satu Mare (\"Sathmar\"), and south of Mukachevo (\"Munkatsch\").\n\nAfter the Habsburgs annexed the Banat area from the Ottomans in the Treaty of Passarowitz (1718), the government made plans to resettle the region to restore farming. It became known as the Banat of Temesvár (\"Temeschwar\"/\"Temeschburg\"), as well as the Bačka (\"Batschka\") region between the Danube and Tisza (\"Theiss\") rivers. Fledgling settlements were destroyed during another Austrian-Turkish war (1737–1739), but extensive colonization continued after the suspension of hostilities.\n\nThe late 18th-century resettlement was accomplished through private and state initiatives. After Maria Theresa of Austria assumed the throne as Queen of Hungary in 1740, she encouraged vigorous colonization on crown lands, especially between Timișoara and the Tisza. The Crown agreed to permit the Germans to retain their language and religion (generally Roman Catholic). The German farmers steadily redeveloped the land: drained marshes near the Danube and the Tisza, rebuilt farms, and constructed roads and canals. Many Danube Swabians served on Austria's Military Frontier (\"Militärgrenze\") against the Ottomans. Between 1740 and 1790, more than 100,000 Germans immigrated to the Kingdom of Hungary.\n\nThe Napoleonic Wars ended the large-scale movement of Germans to the Hungarian lands, although the colonial population increased steadily and was self-sustaining through natural increase. Small daughter-colonies developed in Slavonia and Bosnia. After the creation of Austria-Hungary in 1867, Hungary established a policy of Magyarization whereby minorities, including the Danube Swabians, were induced by political and economic means to adopt the Magyar language and culture.\n\nBeginning in 1893, Banat Swabians began to move to Bulgaria, where they settled in the village of Bardarski Geran, Vratsa Province, founded by Banat Bulgarians several years prior to that. Their number later exceeded 90 families. They built a separate Roman Catholic church in 1929 due to conflicts with the Bulgarian Catholics. Some of these Germans later moved to Tsarev Brod, Shumen Province, together with a handful of Banat Bulgarian families, as well as to another Banat Bulgarian village, Gostilya, Pleven Province.\n\nAfter the treaties of Saint-Germain (1919) and Trianon (1920) following World War I, the Banat was divided between Romania, Yugoslavia, and Hungary; Bačka was divided between Yugoslavia and Hungary; and Satu Mare went to Romania. Before World War II, the biggest populations of Germans in the Vojvodina were at Hodschag, Werbass, and Apatin.\n\nThere were approximately two million ethnic Danube Swabians in the region before World War II. In Romania, census of 1930 recorded 745,421 Germans; Hungarian Census of 1933 recorded 477,153; and Yugoslavian Census of 1921, 513,472. German estimations from the interwar period place those estimations at 850,000; 600,000 and 620,000 for Romania, Hungary and Yugoslavia respectively.\n\nBeginning in 1920 and especially after World War II, many Danube Swabians migrated to the United States, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, Austria, Australia, and Argentina. Some of them, descending from French-speaking or linguistically mixed families from Lorraine, had maintained the French language for some generations, as well as an ethnic identity, later referred to as Banat French, \"Français du Banat.\" They were resettled in France around 1950.\n\nIn 1941 much of Yugoslavia was invaded and occupied by Nazi Germany as part of the Second World War, and in the German-occupied Banat, they granted the Swabian minority superior status over the other ethnic groups in the Yugoslav population. The Baranja and Bačka Swabians reverted to Hungary. The Danube Swabians were already under heavy Nazi influence by that time and served as the Axis fifth column during the invasion of Yugoslavia, although many served in the royal Yugoslav army in the brief war against the Nazis in April 1941. The Independent State of Croatia (1941–1945), a fascist puppet state created within Axis-occupied Yugoslavia, was home to 182,000 Danube Swabian ethnic Germans (who were called \"Folksdojčeri\" in Croatian). In addition, the Danube Swabian minority were granted the separate autonomous region of Banat within German-occupied Serbia In Backe in 1941, Danube Swabians formed around 20% of the population. Yugoslav Danube Swabians supplied more than 60,000 troops for German military formations, some voluntarily but many more under duress. They actively participated in the sometimes brutal repression of Yugoslav Partisans and their suspected sympathizers, including 69,000 Jews living in Yugoslavia.\n\nThe local collaborationist authorities were forced to make it illegal to draft Danube Swabians. However, of the approximately 300,000-strong Danube Swabian minority in occupied Yugoslavia (182,000 in the NDH, 350,000 in Vojvodina), 500,000 in Romania and 500,000 in Hungary, approximately 100,000 eventually entered service in various German and Axis military organizations, most notably in the two locally formed Waffen-SS volunteer divisions, the 7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division \"Prinz Eugen\", and the 22nd SS Volunteer Cavalry Division \"Maria Theresa\" (which was made-up of Hungarian Danube Swabians).\n\nAlthough these military units were initially formed as volunteer units, SS officials ultimately imposed conscription under the dubious legal pretext that occupied Serbia was \"deutsches Hoheitsgebiet\", and the archaic \"Tiroler Landsturmordung\" (Tyrol General Levy Act) of 1872 was invoked. The 7th SS \"Prinz Eugen\" was formed as a volunteer unit, but historians have demonstrated that later in the war, the local German authorities of Banat came under significant pressure from the German authorities. Essentially, coercion was used to recruit more troops. Guenther Reinecke, chief of the \"Hauptamt SS-Gericht\" (SS legal office) wrote to Himmler that the \"Prinz Eugen\" was \"no longer an organization of volunteers, that on the contrary, the ethnic Germans from Serbian Banat were drafted, to a large extent under threat of punishment by the local German leadership, and later by the SS \"Ergänzungsamt\".\" Of about 100,000 Danube Swabians who served in the various SS units, approximately 29,000 were killed. This total includes 2,000 POWs from the 7th SS \"Prinz Eugen\" who were summarily executed by the Allied Yugoslav troops as Yugoslav citizens collaborating with the enemy.\n\nBetween 1941 and 1943, a total of 2,150 ethnic German Bulgarian citizens were transferred to Germany as part of Adolf Hitler's \"Heim ins Reich\" policy. These included 164 Banat Swabians from Bardarski Geran and 33 from Gostilya.\n\nIn 1944, a joint advance of the Yugoslav Partisans, and the Soviet Red Army saw the liberation of northern areas of German-occupied Yugoslavia, which were home to the Danube Swabian minority. In Yugoslavia in particular, with many exceptions, the Danube Swabian minority \"collaborated . . . with the occupation\". Consequently, on November 21, 1944 the Presidium of the AVNOJ (the Yugoslav parliament) declared the ethnic German minority in Yugoslavia collectively hostile to the Yugoslav state. The AVNOJ Presidium issued a decree that ordered the government confiscation of all property of Nazi Germany and its citizens in Yugoslavia, persons of ethnic German nationality (regardless of citizenship), and collaborators. The decision acquired the force of law on February 6, 1945. The reasons for this announcement are still debated by historians, but revenge against the ethnic German minority and the expropriation of Swabian agricultural lands to facilitate collectivization in Yugoslavia appears to have been the prime reasons.\n\nDuring the Second World War, many ethnic Germans sent the youngest and the oldest of their families to Germany. From 1945–48, many ethnic Germans in Hungary were dispossessed and expelled to Allied-occupied Germany under the Potsdam agreement. In the Bačka, which had been part of Hungary from 1941, Schwowisch villages were emptied forcibly in March 1945. The old and the young were imprisoned in camps in several villages of Vojvodina (in modern Serbia) including Gakovo, Kruševlje, Rudolfsgnad (Knićanin), Molidorf (Molin), Bački Jarak, and Sremska Mitrovica, and two villages in the Slavonia region of Yugoslavia (now part of Croatia), Krndija, Valpovo. Those able to work were used as slave labor throughout the countryside. On March 1, 1946 there was a proposal to expel 130,388 interned Yugoslav ethnic Germans under the Potsdam Agreement. This proposal was turned down but provides a good estimate of the number of Shwovish internees. Many thousands were forcibly removed by cattle cars to Russia as Allied \"war reparations\", being put to work as slave labor in Siberian coal mines and elsewhere until 1949, when the program was shut down. The conditions were poor, and about half of those sent to Russia died from malnutrition or disease.\n\nIn Yugoslavia in 1945, most ethnic Germans had their land confiscated and some were stripped of their citizenship by the new communist government. They faced summary executions, massacres, deportations. They were rounded up en masse, and some were sent to concentration and labor camps, where they died in considerable numbers. About 27,000 – 37,000 women aged 18–40 were sent to the Soviet Union to perform forced labor. In addition, 35,000–40,000 Swabian children under age sixteen were separated from their parents and force into prison camps and re-education orphanages. Many were adopted by Serbian Partisan families.\n\nOf a pre-war population of about 350,000 ethnic Germans in the Vojvodina, the 1958 census revealed 32,000 left. Officially, Yugoslavia denied the forcible starvation and killing of their Schwowisch populations, but reconstruction of the death camps reveals that of the 170,000 Danube Swabians interned from 1944 to 1948, about 50,000 died of mistreatment. Since only families with the very young (under three), very old, and mothers were interned and starved, many others were unaccounted for in slave labor settings throughout the countryside and in Russia; but their death rates were probably much lower. The Germans in Romania were not deported but were instead dispersed within Romania. Austrian historian Arnold Suppan considers the destruction of the Danube Swabians to be genocide.\n\nMany left Romania for West Germany between 1970–90, and this trend increased in 1990. Since the fall of communism and the formation of new nations with new borders, the forces for movement of people among European nations have changed. Hungary joined the European Union and travel between nations became simpler. From 2001 to 2011, the number of those identifying as German in Hungary increased sharply, comparing the census tables from the two years. Explanations for the increase seem complex, including the willingness of citizens to claim the ethnic identity.\n\n Prior to the First World War, the Swabians were the largest ethnic group to assimilate into Hungarian society, seconded by the Galician Jews and the Slovaks. They were first and foremost Catholics, peasants thereafter, and thirdly loyal subjects to Kaiser Franz Joseph. But a distinct Hungarian Swabian ethno-national consciousness didn't develop until the spread of Romantic Nationalism in the late nineteenth century.\n\nFor the greater portion of their history, the Danube Swabian did not share a cultural identity. The term Swabian has its roots in the first wave a German-speaking immigrants from Swabia to re-settle southern Hungary after the expulsion of the Ottomans in 1689. However, it came to encompass all German-speaking people who followed in migrations from across the Holy Roman Empire in the eighteenth and nineteenth century. The term \"Swabian\" was not originally a self-proclaimed identity of a singular people but a term ascrided by Magyar lords to refer to German-speaking Catholic peasants, tavern keepers, and poor artisans. For the most part Swabians lived in villages, had few privileges, and no developed intellectual layer. In 1930 Hungary 55.4% of the total Swabian population were engaged in agriculture; 28.8% in industry, crafts, commerce, or transport; and 3.1% were in state administration. The rest were employed in the service sector.\n\nThe Danube Swabian culture is a melting pot of southern German regional customs, with a large degree of Balkan and mostly Hungarian influence. This is especially true of the food, where paprika is heavily employed, which led to the German nickname for Danube Swabians as \"Paprikadeutsche\". The architecture is neither Southern German nor Balkan but is unique to itself. The houses, often made of stamped mud and straw walls or mud bricks, are ubiquitous throughout the Vojvodina region. Georg Weifert was responsible for developing one of the most famous beers in the Serbia/Yugoslavia region and later became an important banker and politician in Belgrade (his image currently features on the Serbian 1000 dinar note).\n\nThe Danube Swabian language is only nominally Swabian (\"Schwowisch\", as it was referred to locally). In reality, it contains elements or many dialects of the original German settlers, mainly Swabian, Franconian, Bavarian, Pfälzisch, Alsatian, and Alemannic, as well as Austro-Hungarian administrative and military jargon. Loanwords from Hungarian, Serbian, or Romanian are especially common regionally regarding cuisine and agriculture, but also regarding dress, politics, place names, and sports. Other cultures of influence include Serbian and Croatian, Russian (for communist concepts), Romanian, Turkish (Hambar), English (for football), and general Balkan and South Slavic loanwords like \"Kukuruts\" (corn). The plural of loanwords is in most cases formed in the Shwovish way. Conjunctions and adverbs from the respective contact languages may be integrated as well.\n\nMany German words used by speakers of Danube Swabian dialects may sound archaic. To the ear of a Standard German speaker, the Danube Swabian dialect sounds like what it is: a mix of southwestern German dialects from the 18th century with many strange words from other languages. Due to relative isolation and differing proximities to nearby German speakers (Austrians and Transylvanian Saxons), the language varies considerably, with speakers able to distinguish inhabitants of neighboring villages by the words they use for such things as marmalade (\"Leckwaar\" and \"Schleckle\" being two variants), or by how many (usually Hungarian) loanwords they employ.This even applied to verb conjugations. For example, the German verb \"haben\" was conjugated as \"han\" in Sankt Hubert and as \"hava\" In Mramorak, although both were in Banat. Herman Ruediger, a German sociologist, reports that in his trips throughout the Bačka in the 1920s, he noted that Danube Swabians from widely separated villages had to use standard high German to communicate with each other because their speech was so different. This was particularly true for towns like Esseg (Osijek) where Shwoveh were thoroughly with majority Croatians. For instance, the ethnic Germans of Esseg were so thoroughly assimilated with Croatia that their Shwovish or 'Essekerish' could only be understood by those who also spoke Croatian or Serbian.\n\nAs is the custom in Hungary (as well as southern Germany), Danube Swabians often put the surname first, especially when writing, for example \"Butscher Jakob\" (see photo of memorial). Danube Swabian villages tend to have relatively few family names as the villagers stem from only a few families, but usually the same family name does not appear in more than a couple of villages, meaning that there are many Danube Swabian family names. The names come from throughout southern Germany, from assimilated Hungarians, and occasionally from Balkan and Italian origins. There are usually no middle names, but often double first names, if a distinction can be made. The variety of first names is few, since children were usually named after grandparents or godparents. Popular names for women include: Anna, Barbara, Christina, Elisabeth, Katharina, Magdalena, Maria, Sophia, Theresia, and many two-name combinations thereof. Popular names for men include: Adam, Anton, Christian, Franz, Friedrich, Georg, Gottfried, Heinrich, Jakob, Johann, Konrad, Ludwig, Mathias, Michael, Nikolaus, Peter, Philipp (or Filipp), and Stefan (or Stephan). With so few names in villages, other modifiers or nicknames were almost always used to distinguish people. The modifiers were often size related (e.g., \"Kleinjohann\" or \"Little Johann\"), occupation related (\"Tischler Stefan\" or the \"carpenter Stefan\"), or location related (usually by prefixing the streetname).\n\nA coat of arms designed in 1950 by Hans Diplich has been adopted by many Danube Swabian cultural organizations. Its blazon is \"Parti per fess wavy 1 Or, an eagle displayed couped Sable langued Gules; 2 parti per fess Argent and Vert, a fortress Argent roofed and turreted Gules surmounted with Sun and Crescent waning Or; chief wavy Azure\".\n\nIt depicts:\n\nGermany\n\nAustria\n\nLuxembourg\n\n\n\n"}

She died a child aged 5, after which the earldom of Warwick was inherited by her paternal aunt. The title then passed by marriage to Anne's maternal uncle, Richard Neville, the famous 'Kingmaker' of the later Wars of the Roses.\n\nAnne Beauchamp was born on 14 February 1444 at Cardiff in Wales. Her father was Henry Beauchamp, Duke of Warwick (1425–1446), the last male of the medieval Beauchamp family to hold the Warwick title. Anne's mother was Cecily Neville, sister to Richard Neville, who later played a key role in the Wars of the Roses.\n\nOn 11 June 1446, Anne's father died. The dukedom of Warwick, created in 1445, had been originally granted to heirs male only, and so became extinct upon Henry Beauchamp's death, but the earldom (created in 1088) allowed for female succession and was therefore inherited by his daughter. She also inherited from her father the barony of Burghersh, being the 7th person to hold that title since its creation in 1330. Upon the death of King Henry VI's uncle Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, on 23 February 1447, Anne also succeeded to the lordship of the Channel Islands, which had been previously entailed on her father.\n\nThe infant Anne was one of the greatest heiresses of her day, alongside the infant Lady Margaret Beaufort, the daughter of the 1st Duke of Somerset who had died in 1444. Both girls became wards of Anne's maternal step-great-grandmother, Alice Chaucer (widow of Thomas Montagu, 4th Earl of Salisbury and a lady-in-waiting to Queen Margaret of Anjou) and William de la Pole, shortly to be Duke of Suffolk, who intended Anne to marry his own heir, John de la Pole (1442–1492).\n\nAnne died on 3 June 1449, aged five, at Ewelme (the Chaucer home) in Oxfordshire. She was buried in Reading Abbey church. Reading may have been chosen as her burial site because her great grandmother, Constance of York, had been buried there.\n\nAnne's title \"Countess of Warwick\" was inherited by her paternal aunt, Lady Anne. The barony of Burghersh fell into abeyance between her aunts.\n\nAfter Anne's death, the Duke of Suffolk instead arranged a 'solemn betrothal' between his son and Lady Margaret, a marriage contract that by law could be, and on the initiative of the king was, dissolved while the bride was below the age of twelve; Margaret herself never subsequently recognized John as her first husband. John went on to marry Elizabeth of York, sister to the later kings Edward IV and Richard III. Margaret married Edmund Tudor, 1st Earl of Richmond and became the mother of King Henry VII.\n\n"}

{"id": "2086253", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2086253", "title": "Echos", "text": "Echos\n\nEchos (Greek: \"sound\"; pl. echoi , Old Church Slavonic: \"voice, sound\") is the name in Byzantine music theory for a mode within the eight-mode system (oktoechos), each of them ruling several melody types, and it is used in the melodic and rhythmic composition of Byzantine chant (\"thesis of the melos\"), differentiated according to the chant genre and according to the performance style (\"method of the thesis\"). It is akin to a Western medieval tonus, an Andalusian tab', an Arab naġam (since 1400 \"maqam\"), or a Persian parde (since 18th-century dastgah).\n\nThe noun \"echos\" in Greek means \"sound\" in general. It acquired the specialized meaning of \"mode\" early on in the development of Byzantine music theory since the Octoechos reform in 692.\n\nIn general, the concept of echos denotes a certain octave species, its intervallic structure as well as a set of more or less explicitly formulated melodic rules and formulae that represent a certain category of melodies within the musical genre. As such, echos is the basis for composing or improvising new melodies that belong to it, as well as for properly performing existing pieces that have been written in it. These rules include the distinction of a hierarchy of degrees (tones, notes), where certain degrees figure as cadence notes (ἑστώτες) around which the melody will revolve prominently, or on which the melody will end most of the time. However, only very late stages of the theory (19th-20th century) actually provide systematic descriptions of echoi, while earlier stages use mostly diagrams, indirect descriptions and examples. Explicit detailed descriptions must still be provided based on extensive analysis, as is the case with modal phenomena in numerous other cultures.\n\nEarly treatises only state the initial or \"base\" degree (η βασή) which is the tone sung as a burden (ἴσον) by certain singers of the choir called \"isokrates\" in order to support any melody composed in a certain echos. By this support singers (psaltes) could easily recognise the relative position of each note as it was organised by tetrachords based on the basis note of each echos. This base degree of the mode was communicated by an intonation formula of a foresinger, known as enechema.\n\nThere are different styles by which to notate enechema which are crucial to the understanding of the different chant books and their notation. All these forms were written in red ink. The explicit long form was called by Jørgen Raasted intonation, but only the books of the cathedral rite used such explicit intonations, also between the sections, where these intonations were called medial intonation. This explicit form made sense, since the intonation also communicated the changes between the left and the right choir and their leaders performed these intonations to coordinate these changes. There was a short form as well which was called modal signature. It indicated the echos by the numeral like πλα' for \"plagios protos,\" while the neumes sung with the last syllable of the enechema were written above right to the numeral. This short form was used in two different ways, as main signature it indicated the echos of a whole composition, but especially in sticheraria notators also wrote medial signatures between the neumes above a kolon of the text, in order to indicate that the melos changed here into another echos. The traditional Greek term for these medial signatures was \"martyria\" (), since the medial signature also \"testified\" the phthongos of the cadence made at the kolon.\n\nWithin the dialogue treatise (\"erotapokriseis\") a catalogue of short formulas memorizes each echos of the Hagiopolitan octoechos and its two phthorai (νενανῶ and νανὰ). These formulas are also called \"echemata\" (ἠχήματα)—or more often \"enechemata\" (ἐνηχήματα) or \"apechemata\" (ἀπηχήματα). The use echemata was also imitated by Carolingian cantors who used similar intonation formulas and collected them in a separate book called tonary.\n\nΠερὶ πλαγίων\nἈπο τοῦ πλαγίου πρώτου ἤχου πάλιν καταβαίνεις τέσσαρας φωνάς, καὶ εὑρίσκεται πάλιν πλάγιος πρώτου· ὅυτως δὲ /\nἄνανε ἄνες ἀνὲ ἄνες·\n\nὉμοίως καὶ ὁ β' ἤχος καταβαίνων φωνάς δ', εὑρίσκεις τὸν πλάγιον αὐτοῦ, ἤγουν τὸν πλάγιον τοῦ δευτέρου.\nπλ Β οὕτως δέ.\n\nὉμοίως πάλιν ὁ τρίτος καταβαίνεις φωνὰς τέσσαρας, καὶ εὑρίσκεται ὁ πλάγιος αὐτοῦ, ἤγουν ὁ βαρύς, οὕτως·\nὉμοίως καὶ ἀπὸ τὸν τέταρτον καταβαίνων φωνὰς τέσσαρας, εὑρίσκεις τὸν πλάγιον αὐτοῦ, ὡς ἐστὶ ὁ πλ δ'οὕτως·\nThe enechemata of the medieval eight diatonic echoi already present a fundamental difference to the Carolingian octoechos: \n\nMore information on the structure of echoi is only indicated in a very rudimentary way through diagrams involving neumes—the Byzantine round notation. The details of the actual intervallic and melodic structure of echoi are virtually impossible to deduce from theoretical treatises prior to the 18th century. In fact, only relatively late systematic comparisons of the echoi with the makamlar of Ottoman court music, such as those by the Kyrillos Marmarinos, Archbishop of Tinos, in his manuscript dated 1747, and the reform of the Byzantine notation by Chrysanthos of Madytos at the first half of the 19th century make it possible to understand the structure of echoi and to attempt reconstructions of melodies from earlier manuscripts.\n\nHe already introduced his readers into the \"diatonic genus\" and its \"phthongoi\" in the 5th chapter of the first book, called \"About the \"parallage\" of the diatonic genus\" (Περὶ Παραλλαγῆς τοῦ Διατονικοῦ Γένους). In the 8th chapter he demonstrates, how the intervals can be found on the fingerboard of the tambur.\n\nHence, the \"phthongoi\" of the \"diatonic genus\" had been defined according to the proportions, as they were later called the \"soft chroa of the diatonic genus\" (τὸ γένος μαλακὸν διατονικὸν). For Chrysanthos this was the only diatonic genus, as far as it had been used since the early church musicians, who memorised the \"phthongoi\" by the intonation formulas (\"enechemata\") of the Papadic Octoechos. In fact, he did not use the historical intonations, he rather translated them in the Koukouzelian wheel in the 9th chapter (Περὶ τοῦ Τροχοῦ) according to a current practice of parallage, which was common to 18th-century versions of \"Papadike\":\n\nΤὸ δὲ Πεντάχορδον, τὸ ὁποῖον λέγεται καὶ Τροχὸς, περιέχει διαστήματα τέσσαρα, τὰ ὁποῖα καθ᾽ ἡμᾶς μὲν εἶναι τόνοι. Περιορίζονται δὲ τὰ τέσσαρα διαστήματα ταῦτα ἀπὸ φθόγγους πέντε.\n\nThe pentachord which was also called wheel (τροχὸς), contains four intervals which we regard as certain tones [ἐλάσσων τόνος, ἐλάχιστος τόνος, and 2 μείζονες τόνοι]. The four intervals spanned five phthongoi:\nπα βου γα δι Πα [\"Πα\" means here the fifth-equivalent for the protos: α']These five stations of the pentachord could be memorised by the echemata of the kyrioi echoi in ascending direction or by those of the plagioi echoi in descending direction (see Chrysanthos' explanation of the trochos parallage). Each of these echemata had the potential to develop an own melos within its melody types:\nEach echema is followed by the incipit of a sticheron idiomelon which illustrates a certain melos of the echos. The following book Kekragarion illustrates, how the hesperinos psalm κύριε ἐκέκραξα has to be sung according to the sticheraric melos of each echos. The Kekragarion was later included in the printed editions of the Anastasimatarion or Voskresnik.\n\nIn the chapter \"On the apechemata\" () of his \"Great Theoretikon\", Chrysanthos translated the Byzantine octoechos and its intonation formulas (apechemata, or enechemata), as they could be found in the Papadikai, by offering an exegesis of the papadic apechemata in comparison to the simpler forms used by Orthodox chanters today. They served as kind of model for the composition within a certain melos, similar to the seyirler of an Ottoman makam.\n\nFor the diatonic echos protos, the medieval enechema had the finalis on the top of the protos pentachord, while the enechema passes through it:\n\nChrysanthos made this exegesis to explain the melos of the whole echos:\n\nIn the first descending half he made the usual cadence on D (, phthongos ) which corresponds to the finalis of the modern melos, while it was once the finalis and the basis of the plagios protos. The second half, when the melos raises again, but within the papadic melos (used with a cherubikon or koinonikon) it prepared a change to another base tone on the upper tetrachord like a (, phthongos ).\n\nHence, according to the current practice of Orthodox chant the protos mele were rather based on the lower tetrachord, but the formula could be used a fifth higher likewise. The step between the phthongoi of tetartos () and protos () could be C—D (—) or G—a (—).\n\nConcerning the enechema of the plagios protos, it had not changed during the centuries.\n\nUnlike the tradition which always used register changes, the modern interpretation did not fix the base degree of echos plagios protos to the bottom of the pentachord, it could appear regularly at the top like in the troparic and heirmologic melos: a ()—c ()—b ()—a () or D ()—F ()—E ()—D ().\n\nChrysanthos' exegesis just passed the protos pentachord D ()—a () in an ascending movement, before using the cadence pattern to the base degree of the mode.\n\nChrysanthos' bridges between the diatonic of the Byzantine past and the chromatic melos of the present Orthodox traditions. The latter is characterised by the constant use of the mesos form, which is not on the of —b natural (, β') and E (, phthongos πλβ'), but between them on G (, πλδ').\n\nThe usual diatonic form was this , but only the descending part would lead to the base tone of the .\n\nAs a consequence, Chrysanthos' exegesis starts and ends on this mesos, but it follows the Hagiopolitan convention to pass through the former pentachord, but he even passes through the pentachord C (, πλδ')—G (, phthongos δ'), as it used by the current melos of .\n\nConcerning the chromatic melos of the in the current octoechos, the papadic had become \"soft chromatic\" under the influence of the .\n\nNevertheless, according to the very particular interpretation of Chrysanthos the melos and scale of is ruled by a diphonic organisation based on just two diatonic intervals: the major and minor tone. As a result, the octave C—c between νη and νη' becomes slightly diminished. Chrysanthos' concept of diphonia was so radical that it found no commonplace in current chant manuals, instead a lot alternative interpretations proposed various divisions of the chromatic tetrachords between νη—γα (C—F) and δι—νη' (G—c).\n\nAt the end of his chapter \"on the apechemata\" Chrysanthos offers a separate exegesis of phthora nenano as a modern deduction of the , whose medieval form was this. But it had moved now with the to the of .\n\nChrysanthos did not offer any exegesis for the apechema of the diatonic echos tritos. He only mentions the intonation of phthora nana instead, which is still used as the echos tritos intonation formula in current Orthodox traditions.\n\nHence, his exegesis of this enharmonic phthora is within the enharmonic genus and the triphonic tone system of the phthora nana.\n\nThe same enharmonic interpretation was done with the plagios called \"echos varys\" (grave mode), obviously in certain cases, when the plagios tetartos was expected of fourth under the base tone. Hence, the enharmonic tritos echoi are not separated by a pentachord, but usually both set on F (, phthongos γ' as well as υαρ), in troparic, sticheraric and heirmologic mele:\n\nWithin the papadic chant genre (cherubika, koinonika), but also during the composed recitation of Polyeleos psalms and kalophonic heirmoi (Ἄξιον ἐστίν), the diatonic melos of echos varys was chosen. Its base tone was one phthongos below the plagios tetartos. According to Chrysanthos it diminished the tritos pentachord to a kind of tritone, at least when it was set on fret arak of the Ottoman tambur, but there are also more traditional ways of intonation depending on the local school of a chanter.\n\nThe tetartos echoi have changed between the Byzantine and the Orthodox octoechos today.\n\nThe original tetartos pentachord between plagios and kyrios—C () and G () or likewise G () and d ()—does still exist in the papadic melos of echos tetartos, which is known as the \"papadic Agia\" ().\n\nChrysanthos made for the papadic melos this exegesis.\n\nA commonly used form of might be the one which Chrysanthos mentions as the one used by Petros Peloponnesios.\n\nThe diatonic plagios of tetartos according to the enechema known from the treatises called Papadikai\n\nwhich was interpreted by Chrysanthos, as follows.\n\nSince the has moved to the phthongos of plagios protos (πλα'), the original of the diatonic was vacant. In fact, as a diatonic phthora it was represented by a medial signature of the so-called \"echos legetos\" () which had preserved the diatonic intonation of .\n\nThe signature was used within the , since heirmoi of were still treated as a diatonic melos unlike the school of Petros Peloponnesios and his follower Petros Byzantios. According to their school the was part of the , as a it was used for the heirmologic melos, where the base and final degree was a low intoned E (βου), and for the , which had the base degree of the mode and closing cadences on D (πα), but the concluding finalis E (βου).\n\nChrysanthos interpreted also echos legetos as a diatonic mesos tetartos.\n\nHe also mentioned a common enechema as it was used by Iakovos the Protopsaltes.\n\nIn this last paragraph of the chapter about the apechemata Chrysanthos referred to ten echoi within the tradition of Hagiopolites.\n\nThe echoi of the psalmody are eight. The apechemata preserved though are ten, because the , and the of the , have two apechemata each.\n\nBut unlike the Hagiopolites, where the was mentioned as a \"\" and the as \"\", seemed to have slipped into the role, but it was a diatonic mesos, not an enharmonic like . In fact, Chrysanthos could not longer mention nana and nenano as additional , since their melos had already replaced the diatonic mele of the and .\n\nIn other Ottoman music traditions like the list of composed Mevlevi dance suites as models of well-known and new makamlar created by eponymous masters resulted in a proliferation of modes (makamlar, maqamat), echoi are not attributed to specific composers, but are rather regarded as belonging to the collective and anonymous heritage of liturgical chant. Eponymous compositions do exist throughout most of the history of Byzantine chant, but their echos is always classified from within the system of existing . Due to an interest for makamlar compositions Phanariotes like Georgios the Protopsaltes, one of the great teachers of Orthodox chant, also became a student of the dervish composer Dede Efendi, after he had learnt Turkish. Byzantine notation developed as a universal notation system during the 19th century which includes even attempts to integrate makamlar within the mele of the Octoechos, while ornamental details became part of an oral tradition.\n\nThe system of echoi is rich and diverse. Closer study and comparison with modal systems of neighboring cultures reveals a complex network of cultural and ethnic influences throughout the centuries—a vivid exchange between musicians across the borders of ethnic and religious identity (Phanariotes). The basic theory of echoi is formalized in a system of eight modes called the Octoechos. See the article Neobyzantine Octoechos for a discussion of its origins and a critique of this concept vis-a-vis actual practice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The institution has endured without interruption for years. Ziegfeld was the father of Florenz Jr., the Broadway impresario. The Academy was credited as being the fourth conservatory in America. In 1871, the conservatory moved to a new building which was destroyed only a few weeks later by the Great Chicago Fire; despite the conflagration, the college was again up and running by the end of the year.\n\nIn 1872, the school changed its name to Chicago Musical College (CMC); over 900 students were enrolled in that year. A Normal Teachers' Institute was added to the school's offerings. Tuition in those was an average of one dollar per lesson. Four years later, the State of Illinois accredited the college as a degree granting institution of higher learning. A Preparatory Division was opened which established branches throughout the city.\n\nRudolph Ganz joined CMC's faculty in 1900 and, except for a brief hiatus in the 1920s, remained associated with the school until his death in 1972. In 1917, CMC offered a Master of Music Degree, and seven years later the school became a charter member of the National Association of Schools of Music.\n\nBy 1925, the college moved into its own eleven-story building, Steinway Hall at 64 E.

The player's mission is to develop a crew and a starship and find the raiders' base and rid the system of them. The game was particularly notable for a musical score that simulated multiple instruments by swapping between them faster than the human ear could differentiate.\n\n\"Sentinel Worlds I: Future Magic\" combines both the elements of \"Starflight\" and \"The Bard's Tale\", and featured some innovations which set it apart from other games at the time. It was one of the pioneers in the budding sci-fi RPG genre.\n\nThe game is non-linear and allows players to ignore the entire plot and explore space for as long as they wanted. It mixes elements of an RPG with a space-shooter, requiring both strategy and tactics as the player would have to dog fight enemy vessels. Players can also choose to venture into trading by mining and harvesting resources on other planets. Much of the game also takes the players onto the ground, where they can fight ground battles using a wire-frame 3D display of their environment and engage in conversation, combat, or trade.\n\nThe main component of the game starts out in the dog fighting space combat scenario, fighting to protect merchant shipping. As the story progresses, other elements of the game, including exploration, trade, conversation, ship boarding, ground combat and investigation are brought into the mix. Players must balance their resources and cash with repairs from battle, buying new weapons and armor, and upgrading their vessel.\n\nAt the start of the game, the players are sent as part of a task force to combat a group of mysterious space raiders in the Caldorre system, who appear from nowhere to ravage merchant shipping in the area. Earlier efforts with battleships were ineffective against the light, agile raiders, so smaller Interceptor-class vessels with specially trained crews were dispatched to counter the threat and eventually end it. The Caldorre system has only three worlds—Caldorre itself, inhabited by a technologically advanced culture that dwells in huge towers on the planet's surface and service passing ships; Norjaenn, a frontier like world embroiled in a bitter war between rancher types and settler farmers over limited land space, and Ceyjavik, an icy world that is home to many exotic arctic animals and a small research station.\n\nIn the year 2995, the Federation dispatches a squadron of Interceptor fighters to the Caldorre system with orders to investigate reports of mysterious pirate attacks on merchant shipping. The player controls the crew of one such vessel, a team of five. The investigation proves quite difficult as the enemy, known as the \"Raiders\", self-destruct their ships when boarded and their personnel suicide upon capture. Solving the mystery requires thoroughly exploring all three of the inhabited planets in the system, resolving diplomatic disputes, and unlocking secret power and knowledge which grants the player characters paranormal abilities. These abilities, which are critical to plot advancement, are the reason for the phrase \"Future Magic\" in the game's title.\n\nUnlocking these abilities allows the player to uncover the true, terrible secret of the Caldorre system. When the true enemy is at last revealed, the characters embark on a final, daring mission to board an enemy space installation while the remainder of the Federation fleet engages the Raiders in a climatic final space battle.\n\nScorpia in \"Computer Gaming World\" had mixed feelings about \"Sentinel Worlds\". In 1988 she described the graphics, especially during takeoff and landing, as \"the most exceptional use of EGA graphics I've seen yet in an adventure game\", but criticized the slow movement speed both indoors and out, as well as the fact that only the team leader could be directly controlled, with the computer controlling the remainder of the team, sometimes poorly. Scorpia wrote in 1989, \"Several have written to me, asking if there is more to the game than shooting down raider ships. There certainly is, but it will take awhile before the \"real\" action starts.\" In 1993 she called \"Sentinel Worlds\" \"an interesting science-fiction CRPG\" with a \"good plot\" but \"terrible ending ... if you can live with that, this is a good game to play\". Orson Scott Card was more positive, writing in \"Compute!\" that \"no other game ... matches \"Sentinel Worlds\" for sheer depth\". He praised the graphics and writing, which he compared to the \"embarrassingly bad writing in the \"Ultima\" series\".\n\n"}

He created numerous paintings, wrote many poems and also helped design Brazil's National Patrimony of the Treasury department. Nery married a poet, Adalgisa Nery, in 1922. He contracted tuberculosis in 1931, and died of it in 1934. His iconic work is \"Autorretrato, 1927\", a surrealist painting commonly compared to the \"Green Violinist\" of Marc Chagall.\n\nBorn in 1900, his family settled in 1909 in Rio de Janeiro. In 1915, he joined the National School of Fine Arts. He traveled to Europe in 1920, and attended the Académie Julian in Paris. Back in Brazil, he worked in the architecture section of the National Heritage service at the Ministry of Finance, where he became friends with the poet Murilo Mendes. In 1922, he married Adalgisa Ferreira. In this period, he produced works with an expressionist tendency.\n\nHis favorite themes are always linked to the human figure: portraits, self-portraits and nudes. He is not interested in national, indigenous and Afro-Brazilian themes. It diversifies the techniques used. He is also a scenographer . In 1929, he had two solo exhibitions, in Belém and Rio de Janeiro . The welcome disappoints him. He also participates in a group exhibition of Brazilian painting in New York.\n\nThat same year 1929, after a trip to Argentina and Uruguay, a diagnosis revealed that he was carrying tuberculosis, which forced him to live in a sanatorium for two years. He comes out apparently neat. He participated in a few shows, such as the Salão Revolucionário in Rio de Janeiro in 1931 and the Exposição de Arte Moderna da SPAM in São Paulo in 1933. But in 1933, the disease returned irreversibly. He died in 1934, at the age of thirty-three, in Rio de Janeiro, at a time when his notoriety beyond the circle of connoisseurs was still nascent. He is buried dressed in Franciscan, in a homage of the monks to his ardent Catholic faith.\n\nIn 1959, Adalgisa Nery published an autobiographical novel, \"A Imaginária\" , which became a bestseller. The book relates in particular the common years with Ismael Nery. Adalgisa Nery describes the fascination she initially felt for her husband, but also their agitated relationship, the internal torments of Ismael Nery, and her violence in everyday life.\n\nIsmael Nery's work was forgotten by the public and critics until the 1960s, when his name was inscribed on the Biennale of São Paulo, In the room devoted to surrealism and fantastic art. His works were also exhibited in the 10th Biennale. In 1966 in Rio de Janeiro, and in 1984, at the Museum of Contemporary Art of the University of Sao Paulo (Ismael Nery Retrospective - 50 years later), two retrospectives of his creations were presented.\n"}

They were designed by Henry Ivatt in 1897. In total 22 were built between 1898 and 1903 at Doncaster Works. The class were commonly known as 'Klondykes' , after the 1897 Klondike gold rush. They could reach speeds of up to 90 mph.\n\nThe 4-4-2 or Atlantic type made its first appearance in 1888 in the United States of America. It was the natural development of the 4-4-0 the additional trailing truck not only supporting a larger firebox but improving the riding. Ten years later the GNR's Henry Ivatt introduced the Atlantic type engines to Britain.\n\nIvatt had the daunting task of replacing the venerable Patrick Stirling at the head of the GNR's locomotive department. Stirling, who had died in office aged 75, was revered not only for the performance of his locomotives but for their looks as well. 'Artistry in metal' was one description of his work and many consider the legendary Stirling Single to be the apotheosis of British locomotive aesthetics.\n\nBy the turn of the century, however, these single wheelers were being taxed by increasing train loadings on the East Coast Main Line. Seeking greater power and adhesion, Ivatt took the American route. He was not alone; his counterpart on the Lancashire & Yorkshire Railway, John Aspinall was also working on an Atlantic. Possibly to register a British first construction of the type, Ivatt's Atlantic was given a high priority by the GNR. Numbered No.990 and named \"Henry Oakley\" after the general manager of the railway, it was outshopped from Doncaster works in 1898, beating Aspinall's prototype by a few months.\n\nLike Churchward on the Great Western Railway Ivatt placed great importance on the boiler design. On No.990 he opted for a large capacity vessel and it was this extra steam raising capacity that gave the Atlantics the edge over Stirling's single wheelers. The first production Atlantics entered service in 1900 and proved fast, lively runners. So lively indeed, that Ivatt had to caution his drivers to rein in the speed because stretches of the track between London and Doncaster were considered too uneven for safety! In their turn, the enginemen would have told Ivatt that the cylinders were no match for the boiler. These first Atlantics had to be worked at undesirable and uneconomic rates to achieve the expected performance; in other words they were thrashed. Ivatt attempted to rectify this by fitting superheaters, starting with 988 with the Schmidt variety in 1909. From 1914 until 1925, the remaining engines were fitted with Robinson superheaters. In line with contemporary thinking, when fitted with superheaters, the boiler pressure was reduced from 170 psi to 160 psi, while the cylinders were enlarged to 19 inches diameter to compensate.\n\nFollowing on from this success Ivatt built the large boiler GNR Class C1.\n\nAfter the 1923 grouping this class became London and North Eastern Railway (LNER} Class C2, whereas the large boiler engines were LNER Class C1. GNR's own Class C2 Atlantic tank locomotives became LNER Class C12.\n\nOnly one of the small boiler C1 class has survived into preservation and it was the very first. No.990 \"Henry Oakley\" is preserved as part of the national collection. Although operated since preservation, it is, as of April 2016 on static display at the National Railway Museum, York.\n\n\n"}

The ship was sunk as a target in 2001.\n\n\"Ingraham\" was launched on 16 January 1944 by Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Company, Kearny, New Jersey, sponsored by Mrs. George Ingraham Hutchinson, granddaughter of Duncan Ingraham, the ship's namesake, and commissioned on 10 March 1944 with Commander H.W.

She was still in the United States when World War II ended on 15 August 1945.\n\nAfter additional repairs, \"Ingraham\" operated along the United States West Coast until 7 May 1946 when she departed for the atomic bomb tests at Bikini Atoll.\n\nThose duties completed, \"Ingraham\" departed San Diego, California, on 24 February 1947 for the Far East. She engaged in various exercises and in late June 1947 arrived in Manila to act as official U.S. representative at the Philippine Independence anniversary. As part of the \"Goodwill Tour\" she also visited Guam, Melbourne and Sydney, Australia. The ship participated in a wreath laying ceremony at the site of the Battle of Coral Sea. She returned to San Diego on 8 October 1947.\n\n\"Ingraham\" operated along the California coast until 4 April 1949 when she departed San Diego for Norfolk, Virginia, arriving there on 20 April 1949. She participated in training exercises in the Atlantic Ocean until 24 November 1950, when she departed Norfolk for four months of duty with the United States Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean. She commenced exercises in the Atlantic Ocean during the summer of 1951, then made another cruise to the Mediterranean during the fall of 1951 and summer of 1952.\n\n\"Ingraham\" departed Norfolk 24 April 1953 to escort the aircraft carrier to Japan via the Mediterranean and Suez Canal. She arrived at Yokosuka, Japan, on 9 June 1953 and later that month joined the aircraft carrier task force providing air support to United Nations forces in Korea during the Korean War. Her accuracy was excellent as she destroyed gun emplacements and supply areas.\n\nFollowing the armistice that ended the Korean War, \"Ingraham\" operated on security patrol before returning to Norfolk on 27 October 1953. During 1954 she operated on antisubmarine hunter-killer operations, cruised to South America, and participated in North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) exercises out of Northern Ireland. She resumed training operations following overhaul in June 1955 and steamed on a summer training cruise to the Scandinavian countries, returning to Norfolk on 6 September 1955.\n\n\"Ingraham\" departed Norfolk on 28 July 1956 for duty with the United States Sixth Fleet as trouble flared over the Suez Canal during the Suez Canal Crisis. She returned to Norfolk on 4 December 1956. She returned to Norfolk 4 December to begin a series of training cruises climaxed by a NATO exercise in September and October 1957.\n\n\"Ingraham\" returned to Sixth Fleet duty in February 1958 and operated on patrol and exercises in the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. She returned to Norfolk, Virginia, on 2 July 1958 prior to the Lebanon crisis, in which the Sixth Fleet played a major role in the outcome in Lebanon. \"Ingraham\" then operated on the United States East Coast until 13 February 1959, when she departed for another tour with the Sixth Fleet, and during which a crisis with the Warsaw Pact over Berlin was averted. Departing the Mediterranean on 30 August 1959, she arrived at Norfolk Naval Shipyard at Portsmouth, Virginia, on 7 September 1959 and began overhaul.\n\nDuring 1960, \"Ingraham\" engaged in operations out of Mayport, Florida, before embarking on another cruise with the Sixth Fleet, beginning late September 1960. She resumed readiness training out of Mayport in March 1961, before undergoing the extensive eight-month Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM) II-overhaul at Portsmouth, Virginia.\n\n\"Ingraham\" arrived at her new home port, Newport, Rhode Island, on 23 February 1962, then engaged in fleet operations in the Atlantic and in the Caribbean. In September and October 1962 she was assigned to the recovery area for the Project Mercury flight of \"Sigma 7\" and under more somber conditions took part in the 1962 blockade of Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis, which ended in the removal of Soviet ballistic missiles from Cuba. She continued operations along the United States East Coast until 1 October 1963, when she sailed for another deployment to the Mediterranean.\n\nRegular deployment with the Atlantic Fleet occupied \"Ingraham\"s time until 29 September 1965.\n\nOn 29 September 1965, \"Ingraham\" departed Newport for the Western Pacific and service in the Vietnam War, arriving on 31 October 1965 at Yokosuka, Japan. for resupply before operations in the South China Sea. Though acting as a part of the screen for the aircraft carrier , she also performed fire support missions for ground troops ashore. On 12 November 1965, \"Ingraham\" steamed ten miles up the Saigon River in South Vietnam to bombard an enemy supply base, and, on 13 November 1965, shelled a Viet Cong assembly area some from the site of her action the previous day.\n\nIn early December 1965, \"Ingraham\" maintained regular surveillance on a Soviet submarine off Chinas Hainan Island, bordering the Gulf of Tonkin. From 1 January 1966 to 24 January, \"Ingraham\" operated with Task Force 77 off Vietnam.\n\n\"Ingraham\" left Vietnamese waters bound for Newport on 4 February 1966 by way of the Suez Canal.\n\nArriving on 8 April 1966 at Newport, \"Ingraham\" began a repair and training period. From 14–21 June 1966 she participated in Operation Beachtime, an amphibious landing in the Caribbean.\n\n\"Ingraham\" spent 28 October 1966 to 28 November 1966 preparing for service in the Mediterranean. On 8 December 1966 she arrived at Gibraltar.\n\n\"Ingraham\" was decommissioned on 15 June 1971 and sold to Greece on 16 July 1971.\n\nIn Hellenic Navy service, the ship was renamed \"Miaoulis\" after a 19th-century Greek naval hero. In Greek service, \"Miaoulis\" initially operated an Aérospatiale Alouette III helicopter instead of the DASH drone helicopter used by the US Navy. She was modernized from November 1986, with the ship's variable-depth sonar removed, and an enlarged flight deck and a larger, telescoping hangar fitted to allow an Agusta-Bell AB-212 helicopter to be operated. was active in the Hellenic Navy until 1992, when she was decommissioned and struck from the active roster.\n\nOn 9 October 2001, \"Miaoulis\" was sunk as a target during a Greek naval exercise.\n\n\"Ingraham\" received the Navy Unit Commendation for her action off Okinawa and four battle stars for service in World War II. She earned a fifth battle star for service in the Korean War.\n\n\n"}

He served as NASA Deputy Administrator from August 19, 1958 until his death.\n\nDryden was born in Pocomoke City, Maryland, the son of Samuel Isaac and Nova Hill Culver Dryden, and was named after a popular local Methodist clergyman. During the financial panic of 1907, his father lost his job and the family moved to Baltimore, Maryland.\n\nAs a student, Dryden excelled in mathematics. He graduated from Baltimore City College, a high school, at the age of 14, and was the youngest student ever to graduate from that school. He was awarded the Peabody Prize for excellence in mathematics. With a scholarship, he was admitted to Johns Hopkins University and graduated with honors after only three years. He earned a M.S. in physics in 1916. His thesis was titled, \"Airplanes: An Introduction to the Physical Principles Embodied in their Use.\"\n\nIn 1918, Dryden joined the National Bureau of Standards, becoming an inspector of gauges. With the help and influence of Dr. Joseph S. Ames, he obtained a transfer to the bureau's Wind Tunnel division, and began taking graduate courses in fluid dynamics to complete his Ph.D. In 1919 at the age of 20, he was awarded his degree in physics and mathematics from Johns Hopkins University, the youngest person ever to have received a doctorate from that institution. His thesis was on the \"Air Forces on Circular Cylinders\".\n\nIn 1920 Dryden was appointed the director of the Aerodynamics Division of the National Bureau of Standards, a newly created section. Collaborating with Dr. Lyman J. Briggs, he performed studies of airfoils near the speed of sound. He also performed pioneering aerodynamics research on the problems of airflow, turbulence, and especially the boundary layer phenomenon. His work contributed to the design of the wings for the P-51 Mustang, as well as other aircraft designed during World War II.\n\nBy 1934, Dryden was appointed the bureau's Chief of the Mechanics and Sound Division, and in 1939 he became a member of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA).\n\nWith the start of World War II, Dryden served in an advisory capacity to the Air Force. He led the development of the \"Bat\", a radar-homing guided bomb program that was successfully employed in combat in April, 1945 to sink a Japanese destroyer.\n\nAfter the war, Dryden became the Director of Aeronautical Research for the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) in 1946. While at the NACA he supervised the development of the North American X-15, a rocket plane used for research and testing. He also established programs for V/STOL aircraft, and studied the problem of atmospheric reentry.\n\nHe held the position of Director of NACA, NASA's predecessor, from 1947 until October 1958. In addition he served on numerous government advisory committees, including the Scientific Advisory Committee to the President. From 1941 until 1956 he was editor of the \"Journal of the Institute of the Aeronautical Sciences\". After NACA became NASA, he became the Deputy Director of that organization, serving until his death.\n\nAfter John Glenn's orbital flight, an exchange of letters between President John F. Kennedy and Soviet Premiere Nikita Khrushchev led to a series of discussions led by Dryden and Soviet scientist Anatoli Blagonravov. Their talks in 1962 led to the Dryden-Blagonravov agreement, which was formalized in October of that year, the same time the two countries were in the midst of the Cuban Missile Crisis. The agreement was formally announced at the United Nations on December 5, 1962. It called for cooperation on the exchange of data from weather satellites, a study of the Earth's magnetic field, and joint tracking of the U.S. Echo II balloon satellite.. Unfortunately, as the competition between the two nation's manned space programs heated up, efforts to further cooperation at that point came to an end. They would be revived in 1969 by NASA Administrator Thomas O. Paine and led to the 1975 Apollo-Soyuz Test Project.\n\nHe died from cancer on December 2, 1965.\n\nMichael Gorn, chief historian at NASA Dryden Flight Research Center, described Dryden as a quiet, reserved man who was self-effacing and diligent. He was patient, a good teacher, and effective when collaborating with others. He was also a devout Methodist, who, as a result, had a dislike of self-promotion. He served as a lay minister for his entire adult life. He was married to Mary Libbie Travers, and the couple had four children.\n\nTom Wolfe, writing in 2009 at the 40th anniversary of the launch of Apollo 11, credited Dryden with having been the individual who spoke up, with President John F. Kennedy in April, 1961, and suggested that manned flight to the Moon was the way to \"catch up\" with the Soviets in the space race. Wolfe describes President Kennedy as having been in \"a terrible funk\" at the time of the meeting with James E. Webb, the NASA administrator, and Dryden, his deputy, as the president wrestled with the string of Soviet \"firsts\" in space flight which had started with Sputnik 1 in 1957 and, that month in 1961, had extended to include Yuri Gagarin's Earth-orbital flight. Within a month of the meeting with Webb and Dryden, President Kennedy announced the Apollo Project-scale goal of putting a man on the Moon within 10 years, the goal that Apollo 11 was ultimately to meet. In setting the goal, the president did not credit Dryden's input, according to Wolfe.\n\nDryden is also a founding member of the National Academy of Engineering.\n\nDryden was portrayed by George Bartenieff in the 1998 TV miniseries \"From the Earth to the Moon\".\n\nDryden published over a hundred papers and articles.\n\n\n\n"}

Other nitrate towns of the Atacama Desert include Humberstone and Santa Laura Saltpeter Works. Unlike most of the other ghost towns in the Atacama Desert, Chacabuco became a concentration camp during the Pinochet regime in 1973. To this day, it remains surrounded by approximately 98 lost landmines, left by the Chilean military when Chacabuco was used as a prison camp.\n\nFounded in 1924 by the Lautaro Nitrate Company Ltd., Chacabuco soon fell into ruin as the nitrate mining boom in Chile came to an abrupt halt at the end of the 1930s. Synthetic nitrate had been invented in Germany at the turn of the 20th century and by the 1930s and 40s had severely crippled northern Chile's nitrate industry. What had accounted for virtually 50% of Chile's Gross National Product fell to almost zero within a few decades. A total of 170 nitrate towns were shut down throughout Chile's Atacama Desert, only one remains open today, María Elena, about 95 kilometers north of Chacabuco. Chacabuco shut its doors in 1938. As a town, it had only survived 14 years.\n\nIn 1971, president Salvador Allende declared Chacabuco a Historic Monument of Chile, at which point restoration began. But in 1973, after the military coup, Pinochet turned it into a concentration camp until the end of 1974. As a concentration camp, it held up to 1,800 prisoners many of whom were doctors, lawyers, artists, writers, professors and workers from all over Chile.\n\nBy the 1990s, Chacabuco was in need of extensive restoration and several international organizations began the restoration of parts of Chacabuco. In 1991, a former political prisoner of Chacabuco, Roberto Saldívar, returned to Chacabuco in order to live in the abandoned town and guard it against vandalism and pillaging. He lived there almost completely alone until January 2006. Pedro Barreda replaced Roberto when he left as caretaker of Chacabuco. Currently living in Chacabuco alone, Pedro considers himself to be Roberto's apprentice and remains dedicated to the cause Roberto started.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2086334", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2086334", "title": "Helmsley", "text": "Helmsley\n\nHelmsley is a market town and civil parish in the Ryedale district of North Yorkshire, England. Historically part of the North Riding of Yorkshire, the town is located at the point where Ryedale leaves the moorland and joins the flat Vale of Pickering.\n\nIt is situated on the River Rye on the A170 road, east of Thirsk, west of Pickering and some due north of York. The southern boundary of the North York Moors National Park passes through Helmsley along the A170 road so that the western part of the town is within the National Park.\n\nThe settlement grew around its position at a road junction and river crossing point. Helmsley is a compact town, retaining its medieval layout around its market place with more recent development to the north and south of its main thoroughfare, Bondgate. It is a historic town of considerable architectural character whose centre has been designated as a conservation area. The town is associated with the Earls of Feversham, whose ancestral home Duncombe Park was built overlooking Helmsley Castle. A statue of William Duncombe, 2nd Baron Feversham stands in the town's square.\nThe town is a popular tourist centre and has won gold medals in the Large Village category of Yorkshire in Bloom for three years. The town square is a meeting place for motorcyclists as it is at the end of the B1257 road from Stokesley, which is a favourite with bikers.\n\nThe Cleveland Way National Trail starts at Helmsley, and follows a horseshoe loop around the North York Moors National Park and Yorkshire coast for to Filey. The remains of Helmsley Castle, which was destroyed in the Civil War, loom over the town.\n\nArchaeological discoveries indicate that the area around Helmsley was first settled in around 3,000 BC and small farming communities existed here throughout the Neolithic, Bronze and Iron Ages and into Roman times. Finds of beehive querns confirm local agriculture and the milling of grain since at least the Iron Age. There are also reports of finds of Roman pottery and a second-century Roman coin.\n\nThe ancient settlement, whose Old English name was \"Elmeslac\", pre-dates the \"Domesday Book\". It means ‘Helm’s forest clearing’ and indicates the nature of the landscape at that time.Vikings also left their mark in the Old Norse, \"gate\" ending of the names of many of the streets. The ownership of much of the town and its surrounding land has changed hands only twice since the Norman Conquest. After the conquest it was governed within the wapentake of Maneshou in the North Riding of Yorkshire, held by William the Conqueror’s half brother the Count of Mortain; land to the west of Helmsley was a royal deer park. The ancient pollarded oak trees in Duncombe Park date from this period and the park is now a national nature reserve. In about 1100 the estate passed to Walter Espec, founder of Rievaulx Abbey. Walter Espec’s heirs were the eldest surviving sons of his three sisters and the Helmsley properties devolved upon Robert De Ros, the son of the youngest sister, Adeline. In 1191 Robert de Ros granted Helmsley its Borough Charter, which established it as the market town.\n\nThe charter created the burgage plots – long, narrow plots which can still be seen in the property boundaries on the west side of Castlegate and east side of Bridge Street. Large-scale sheep farming, wool production and weaving were the mainstay of Helmsley’s economy for several centuries. Despite setbacks, including marauding Scots and the Black Death, Helmsley grew steadily throughout the Middle Ages. When wool production declined after the dissolution of Rievaulx Abbey, Helmsley’s weavers turned to flax, much of which was imported. The weavers were located on Bond and Bridge Streets. By the beginning of the 17th century the form of Helmsley was largely complete, and many buildings in use today date from this period. The oldest surviving house is Canon's Garth, the vicarage. The town remained with the holders of the barony of De Ros through the Earls of Rutland and the Dukes of Buckingham until it was sold to the city financier, Sir Charles Duncombe in about 1689.\n\nThe ruined Norman castle is the most significant medieval survival of the buildings in the town, although parts of the parish church and Canon’s Garth are mediaeval in origin. The 18th and 19th centuries saw major developments and expansion in the hands of the Duncombe family, beginning with the construction of Duncombe Park outside the town. At the beginning of the 19th century the cottage weaving industry declined in the face of competition from new industrial cities. Despite this, the 19th century saw various major development in the town, notably the rebuilding of All Saints' Church, and at the end of the century, building of the town hall. More houses were built along Bondgate and, after the arrival of the railway in 1871, along Station Road. This period also saw older houses remodelled so that little thatch remained in the town. With the decline of weaving, agriculture became the mainstay of the economy.\n\nOn 30 June 2011, the BBC Two programme \"History Cold Case\" featured an archaeological investigation into four 2,000-year-old skeletons found in Windy Pits caves, concluding that at least one had been the victim of a ritual killing, including scalping. The findings, including the facial reconstruction of the scalping victim, were presented, at Duncombe Park, to local history experts.\n\nThe conservation area covers about 91.2 acres (36.9 hectares) and contains some 433 buildings within its bounds. It contains all 51 listed buildings in the town, approximately 12% of the building stock, and two scheduled ancient monuments. Of the listed buildings, 48 are classified Grade II and three are Grade II*. Most small buildings in the conservation area are built of local cream and honey-coloured stone. Most buildings, even those of higher status, are constructed using rubble stone which has been laid to course. Most roofs are covered with pantiles. Some of the larger, more imposing town houses and civic buildings have been constructed using ashlar stone and slate as a demonstration of affluence.\n\nHelmsley is situated on the southern boundary of the North York Moors National Park approximately above sea level. The town's geology is sandstone. To the west and the north of the settlement the moorland areas are predominantly limestone.\nHelmsley lies in a hollow in undulating open countryside, flanked by heather moor to the north and the rolling farmland of the Howardian Hills to the south. The flat lowland of the Vale of Pickering stretches eastwards from the town towards Malton. The River Rye runs by the town to the south where it is joined at Rye Bridge by the Borough Beck flowing southwards through the town from the moors. Meadows south of the Rye form an important buffer and create an attractive setting for the town from the southern approach.\nThe area was affected by flash flooding on the night of 19 June 2005.\n\nAn electoral ward in the same name exists. This ward stretches north from Helmsley with a total population of 3,066 measured at the 2011 Census.\n\nThe population of the larger Helmsley ward area was recorded by the 2001 Census as being 3,097. North Yorkshire County Council, however, estimated in 2000 that the population of the actual urban town area was approximately 1,500, measured at 1,515 in the 2011 census. The town is in the catchment area of Ryedale School.\n\nIn the late 20th century a large amount of housing was built on backland sites in the older part of town and in residential developments outside its historic core and a small industrial estate was developed in the south-eastern corner.\nDevelopments included award-winning council house development at Elmslac Road in the 1950s, a primary school, health centre, \"affordable housing\" at Storey Close, housing for the elderly at Elm Green and Pottergate and development of the industrial sector, particularly Thomas's Bakery and a veterinary surgery. The castle visitor centre provides an important attraction for the town. Helmsley is well provided with retail space but less well provided with office space. The main employers are Duncombe Park Estate, Thomas’s Bakery and the North York Moors National Park Authority. The industrial estate is a vital economic asset of Helmsley.\n\nTourism plays an important role in the area's economy. The national park receives around 9 million day-visits each year. Day visitors make up 40% of all visitor days, with people staying within the park making up 31% and people staying outside the park making up 29%. 31% of park visitors stay in serviced accommodation, compared with 64% who stay in self-catering accommodation. Daily expenditure in the national park is approximately £9.10 per person, which excludes accommodation costs. Visitor revenue within the national park was £169 million in 1998, £152 million in 1997 and £119 million in 1996. This can be compared to the figure for the whole of North Yorkshire, which stood at £1,054 million in 1996. However, employment in tourism is, by nature, seasonal. Helmsley draws the largest number of day visitors (32%) within the year, for the North York Moors National Park as a whole. It attracts 37% of longer stay visitors.\n\nHelmsley Community Primary School is on Carlton Lane.\n\nHelmsley Arts Centre has a 140-seat auditorium and 40-seat studio/exhibition space. It provides film screenings, live music, theatre performances, comedy clubs, art exhibitions and workshops/classes. The 1812 Theatre Company is the resident amateur theatre company at the centre. It mounts at least three productions per year in the main theatre and two in the studio. The 1812 Youth Theatre meets there on a regular basis, putting on two shows a year.\n\nThe indie rock band One Night Only is from the town.\n\nThe Helmsley Walled Garden, originally built in 1756, is being restored as a working kitchen garden. A walled garden for the castle stood along the banks of the river to the south. Soon after the family moved out of the castle into Duncombe Park this walled garden was built. The garden incorporates glass houses designed in 1850 as a vine house. The ongoing programme of restoration uses appropriate plants where possible.\n\nHelmsley has an open-air swimming pool and a recreation ground providing facilities for tennis, bowls, cricket and football. The Cleveland Way, a horseshoe-shaped route around the North York Moors National Park starts in Helmsley. It follows the moor's western escarpment to meet the coast at Saltburn-by-the-Sea, and then follows the North Yorkshire and Cleveland Heritage Coast to end at Filey. Other places of interest include the International Centre for Birds of Prey, Rievaulx Abbey and Helmsley Arts Centre.\n\nLocal newspapers are the \"Malton and Pickering Mercury\" and the \"Gazette and Herald\". Helmsley Library is situated at the front of the town hall, in the Market Place. Staff at the library received an award for North Yorkshire County Council's Library of the Year in 2010.\n\nThe Helmsley Archive is a collection of more than 5,000 images illustrating the history of Helmsley over the last 150 years. John Collier bequeathed his collection to Helmsley Town Council who, with the Ryedale Area Committee of North Yorkshire County Council, support the project. The archive is being augmented by local residents.\n\nThere are four churches in Helmsley. The Anglican church is the Church of All Saints a Grade II* listed building.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2086337", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2086337", "title": "Lake Lanier", "text": "Lake Lanier\n\nLake Lanier (officially Lake Sidney Lanier) is a reservoir in the northern portion of the U.S. state of Georgia. It was created by the completion of Buford Dam on the Chattahoochee River in 1956, and is also fed by the waters of the Chestatee River. The lake encompasses or of water, and of shoreline at normal level, a \"full pool\" of above mean sea level and the exact shoreline varies by resolution according to the Coastline Paradox. Named for American poet Sidney Lanier, it was built and is operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for flood control and water supplies. It is patrolled by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources (GDNR), as well as local law enforcement.\n\nThe states of Georgia, Alabama and Florida all have rights to the water of the reservoir, as it feeds rivers going through those areas. The Corps of Engineers has responsibilities to regulate flow for flood control and water use. In addition, it has to ensure that water is available to fulfill such federal mandates as under the Endangered Species Act, to support downstream species. The rapid suburbanization of the Atlanta region, in particular, has greatly increased water consumption by private homeowners for lawns and gardens. During droughts of the 21st century, Lake Lanier reached record lows, and regional actions have been needed to reduce area water usage.\n\nThe lake is in Hall, Forsyth, Dawson, Gwinnett, and Lumpkin counties, split about 60%, 30%, 5%, 4%, and 1% respectively, filling the valley into numerous small arms and fingers. The former thalweg of the Chestatee and the Chattahoochee south of it form the county line between Hall and a corner of Gwinnett to the east, and Dawson and Forsyth counties to the west. \nOne of the main purposes of the lake is flood control of the Chattahoochee River downstream, mainly protecting metro Atlanta. Since the construction of Buford Dam, there have been only three major flooding events on the downstream section. The most severe flooding event was in 2009, following a two-year drought; the most recent was in 2013.\n\nThe lake's original purposes were to provide hydroelectricity, navigation, and flood control of the Chattahoochee River, and water supply for the city of Atlanta.\n\nThe $1 billion project was approved, with ground breaking in 1950. Approximately 700 families were moved from the area after their properties were bought by the USCOE, in order to flood the area and create the lake. A stretch of Georgia Highway 53 had to be abandoned that ran too close to the planned shoreline. Gainesville's Looper Speedway was also condemned and abandoned.\n\nMore than $2 million had been spent by the Corps on preliminary construction when the House Committee on Appropriations refused to provide more funds in June 1951. During that summer Atlanta mayor William Hartsfield traveled to Washington numerous times pressing southern Democratic Senators Richard Russell, Jr. and Walter F. George to restore funding to ensure Atlanta's water supply during droughts. Hartsfield returned to Washington in 1955 to lobby for $11 million more for the dam, which had a target date of 1956, again stressing the importance of an adequate water supply for his growing city. Congress approved the funds, and the dam was completed and opened on schedule.\n\nLake Lanier began filling in 1956, and in 1957, downstream, Morgan Falls Dam was raised to regulate the flow from Buford Dam and regulate the flow of water to Atlanta. In early fall of 1958, the region had two solid months of drought, which would have left the Chattahoochee and its tributaries nearly dry, if not for the construction of Buford Dam and the reserve of Lake Lanier.\n\nSince the 1990s, the Corps of Engineers, Florida, Georgia, and Alabama have all been fighting for use of the water held in Lake Lanier. Federal law mandates that when a river flows between two or more states, each state has a right to an equal share of the water. Additionally, laws such as the Endangered Species Act require that water be available to preserve and support the threatened or endangered species that live in or around Chattahoochee River and Apalachicola Bay.\n\nPertinent information on the reservoir, power plant, etc. can be found on the Mobile District Corps of Engineers web site. Also, historic operational information on lake elevations, discharges, inflows and power generation for all the Corps projects on the ACF are available.\n\nIn June 2006, the USACE revealed that the new lake gauge at the dam, replaced in December 2005, was not properly calibrated, yielding a lake level reading nearly two feet (over half a meter) higher than the actual level. Because of this, nearly twenty-two billion U.S gallons (over eighty-two billion liters) of excess water had been released. This was above the already planned excess releases to support the successful spawning of gulf sturgeon in the Apalachicola River and to protect several species of oysters in Apalachicola Bay from excessive saltwater intrusion.\n\nGeorgia Governor Sonny Perdue said that the Corps had created a \"manmade drought\", because most of the state was already having dry conditions. This came at a time when outdoor water-use restrictions were being put in place by local governments. The high rate of suburban growth in the area resulted in a high rate of water consumption to care for the many lawns which had replaced forests. Because of the error in managing Lake Lanier, the governor's office declared a drought and enacted a ban on outdoor water use from 10 to 4, in addition to the permanent weekly odd/even address system. Other local counties imposed further restrictions or total bans, based on each water system's conditions. Outdoor watering was banned completely as the state suffered its worst drought in its recorded history.\n\nOn October 16, 2007, Governor Perdue gave the USACE until the evening of October 17 to come up with a plan for the continued release of water for Florida wildlife. Senator Johnny Isakson stood before the Georgia General Assembly saying, \"The health, safety and welfare of people are threatened. They are threatened by an act this Congress passed that had no intention to threaten them.\" He eventually withdrew his threat to sue the Corps of Engineers, but the Lake Lanier Association indicated that it would file a private legal action. Governor Perdue's attempts to reach an agreement with Florida over water releases fell through, leaving the final decision on releases from the lake to be made by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\nOn November 22, 2007 the water level was at , setting a new record low (\"see below: Lake water levels & External links\"). The previous low was , set in December 1981. The water level as of November 28, 2007 had dropped to and still decreasing at a day. One month later, the water level stabilized around a final low of , recorded December 26, 2007 at Buford Dam. The day after Christmas, the water level began rising from week to week.\n\nEventually after winter rains, on February 18, 2008, the water level of Lake Lanier rose to , higher than the December 1981 level of , effectively ending the record-low phase of the drought crisis.\n\nA similar drought situation occurred in late 2008. At the end of the year, the water level stabilized around a final low of , recorded December 8, 2008, at Buford Dam, slightly above the record set in 2007.\n\nAfter rainfall during the winter of 2008–2009, on March 30, 2009, the climatologist of the state of Georgia, David Stooksbury, declared the drought over, noting, \"soil moisture is near normal, stream flows are near normal. Small and medium-sized reservoirs are full.\" Stooksbury continued, \"There is still the 500-pound gorilla sitting in the room and that’s Lanier.\" In May 2009, the water level of Lake Lanier rose to exceed 1066 ft, reaching a high of in mid-June 2009. It did not reach the full summer pool of 1071 ft during mid-2009, remaining more than lower. Following weeks of heavy rain in North Georgia, Lake Lanier returned to full pool in mid-October 2009. The record high is set in April 1964.\n\nThe record-low lake levels had revealed parts of the lake bottom not seen since the 1950s, including remnants of a road and foundations of homes that had to be abandoned for the construction. More recent additions to the lake - including discarded trash, boat batteries and sunken boats - were discovered. Local efforts were organized to clean up the lake bottom. Several automobiles, some stolen, and discarded firearms were also recovered by law enforcement officials.\n\nIn July 2009 a federal judge from Minnesota (chosen from a neutral location as an arbiter) ruled that Congress never authorized Lake Lanier to be used as a source of the water supply for metro Atlanta. Georgia was given three years to stop withdrawing from the lake (except for the adjacent cities of Gainesville and Buford), unless Congress authorized it, or if it and the other two states using water from the reservoir came to agreement about use. The Atlanta Regional Commission chairman noted that if enforced, cutting drinking water to 75% of current users in the region would require disaster aid from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).\n\nIn June 2011 the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the 2009 district court decision and confirmed the USACE's authority to regulate Lake Lanier for Atlanta's water supply. The Corps responded in June 2012 with plans for further analysis and evaluation of proposals from the three states.\n\nIn 2013 Florida filed an original action against Georgia in the Supreme Court of the United States, requesting equitable apportionment of waters in the ACF Basin. On November 3, 2014, the Supreme Court granted Florida leave to file the complaint, and the case is currently pending before a Special Master.\n\nThe lake is popular with boaters, houseboats, jetskiers and others, particularly around the summer holidays. Over 10 million people visit the lake annually, including its marinas and the Lake Lanier Islands waterpark. The rowing and sprint canoeing events during the 1996 Summer Olympics were held on the north end of the lake. It has since hosted many international events such as the 2003 ICF Canoe Sprint World Championships, 2016 Pan American Sprint Canoe/Kayak Championships and the 2018 ICF Dragon boat World Championships. The Venue is host to many other events such as Food Truck Friday, ACRA Championships and the Atlanta Hong Kong Dragon boat Festival.\n\nLake Lanier has over 90 Corps, State, County and City parks spread around its 680 miles of shoreline, 23 of which provide swim beaches. All of these parks are accessible by land and some by water and most have other amenities such as picnic areas, restrooms, boat ramps and playgrounds. There are also dozens of beaches on Lake Lanier that are on islands located all over Lake Lanier.\n\nOne resort hotel sits on the lake: Legacy Lodge (Formerly Emerald Pointe Hotel). A second hotel, Pine Isle was demolished in 2008. Both were sold by CNL Hotels & Resorts, a hotel investment firm in Florida, to Georgia businessman Virgil Williams. In 2017-2018 Margaritaville (Jimmy Buffett fame) was announced to take over Lanier Islands Park. Both assets sit on a ground lease from the Lake Lanier Islands Development Authority which in turn leases the land from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\n\nLake Lanier was the site of the 1997 Bilderberg conference.\n\nEvery year from mid-November through January, Lake Lanier Islands are decorated with over of Christmas lights, the largest animated light show in the southeast and one of the world's largest light shows. Magical Nights of Lights is an animated drive-through display that ends with a Christmas village, carnival rides, bonfire, Santa Shop, live nativity, etc.\n\n \n\nAt the end of 2007, the water level of Lake Lanier became notable, on a daily basis, for setting record low levels, worse than any in the previous 25 years. By early November, the water level was dropping a fifth of a foot (.06 m) per day (\"see table below\"), with the largest drop on November 9 of to 1054.08 ft (321.4 m).\n\nFinally, on February 18, 2008, the water level of Lake Lanier had risen above the record-low levels set in November, rising to . This was higher than the December 1981 level of , effectively ending the record-low phase of the drought crisis. As of April 21, 2009, the lake had risen back to 1063.39 feet.\n\nMultiple rain storms further to the south, along the Chattahoochee River to Apalachicola Bay, brought increased fresh water to the Florida wildlife in November and December 2007, despite the reduced water flow from Lake Lanier at Buford Dam. Rainfall along the lower Chattahoochee River was often greater overall than above Lake Lanier, as it spanned the longer length of the river.\n\nMetropolitan Atlanta received far above-average rainfall amounts throughout September and October 2009, and had record floods. On October 14, 2009, Lake Lanier had risen back to above-full pool at 1071.01 feet. The record high is , set in April 1964.\n\nIn 2011 and 2012 the water fell to some of the lowest points on record set during the 2007 droughts. In the spring and summer of 2013, the water level reached some of the highest points due to high amounts of rain and flooding in the north Georgia area. By late June 2016, the southern parts of Forsyth County were having severe drought, and water use was ordered to be reduced.\n\n"}

The family's roots traced back to the arrival of Richard Brackett in the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1629, near present-day Springfield, Massachusetts. His mother's uncle, George Henry Corliss, built the Centennial Engine that powered the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia. A 1915 graduate of Williams College, he earned his degree from Harvard University. He joined the Allied Expeditionary Force during World War I. He was awarded the French Medal of Honor. He was a frequent contributor to the \"Saturday Evening Post\", \"Collier's\", and \"Vanity Fair\", and a drama critic for \"The New Yorker\" from 1925-29. He wrote five novels: \"The Counsel of the Ungodly\" (1920), \"Week-End\" (1925), \"That Last Infirmity\" (1926), \"American Colony\" (1929), and \"Entirely Surrounded\" (1934).\n\nBrackett was president of the Screen Writers Guild (1938–1939). He was president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences from 1949 through 1955. Brackett either wrote or produced over 40 films during his career, including \"To Each His Own\", \"Ninotchka\", \"The Major and the Minor\", \"The Mating Season\" (1951), \"Niagara\", \"The King and I\", \"Ten North Frederick\", \"The Remarkable Mr. Pennypacker\", and \"Blue Denim\".\n\nFrom 1936-50, Brackett worked with Billy Wilder as his collaborator on thirteen movies, including \"The Lost Weekend\" (1945) and \"Sunset Boulevard\" (1950), which won Academy Awards for their screenplays. The duo's professional partnership ended in 1950, after the completion of \"Sunset Boulevard\". Brackett then went to work at 20th Century-Fox as a screenwriter and producer. His script for \"Titanic\" (1953) won him another Academy Award. He received an Honorary Oscar for Lifetime Achievement in 1958.\n\nBrackett married Elizabeth Barrows Fletcher, a descendant of Stephen Hopkins of the \"Mayflower\", on June 2, 1919, in Indianapolis, Indiana. They had two daughters, Alexandra Corliss Brackett, Mrs. Larmore (1920–1965) and Elizabeth Fletcher Brackett (1922–1997). Elizabeth Fletcher Brackett the elder died on June 7, 1948. In 1953, Brackett married his sister-in-law (Elizabeth's sister, Lillian Fletcher); that union was childless.\n\nCharles Brackett died on March 9, 1969, aged 76, in Beverly Hills, California. His diaries covering the years 1932 until the breakup with Wilder were edited by Anthony Slide under the title \"It's the Pictures That Got Small: Charles Brackett on Billy Wilder and Hollywood's Golden Age\" (Columbia University Press, 2014).\n\n\n"}

The university enrolls an estimated 1,300 undergraduate and graduate students. It offers 27 four-year undergraduate programs, an MBA and a master of education. Established in 1923, it has been coeducational since 1932. The university is also home to Greystone Preparatory School, a college-level service academy preparatory program for those who did not receive appointments or nominations straight out of high school.\n\nCaptain Charles Schreiner Sr. founded Schreiner Institute (sometimes called \"Schreiner Military Institute\") in 1917 and worked toward its establishment until 1923. The military institute, a residential school, was created for young boys and included both secondary school and junior college curricula to prepare students for further education. 1971 marked the end of military training at the institute. In 1973, it began focusing on a college curriculum and changed its name to Schreiner College. The college experience changed once more in 1981 when it became a four-year college. The college became Schreiner University in 2001 and began offering master's degrees. Schreiner University now hosts a number of lecture series and academic conferences, including its annual popular culture symposium.\n\nIn 2017, Schreiner surpassed its five-year capital campaign fundraising goal of $50 million. Since 2012, the institution has received $52.4 million from approximately 3,600 donors. Nearly $30 million of the amount raised is earmarked for student scholarships, which have been previously funded at $13 million. The school will add endowed chairs in mathematics, science, and humanities and hire a visiting artist and performer or designer in residence. Schreiner has a current enrollment of 1,300.\n\nThe university no longer operates the Hill Country Museum in the house of its founder, the Capt. Charles Schreiner Mansion.\n\nSchreiner University is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools to award masters, baccalaureate and associate degrees. The university also holds accreditation by the Texas Board of Vocational Nurse Examiners and is approved by the Texas Board of Nursing as well as the State Board for Educator Certification (SBEC) for teacher certification programs.\n\nThe university holds membership in the American Association for Higher Education, the American Council on Education, the Association of Presbyterian Colleges and Universities, the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities, the Association of Texas Colleges and Universities, and the Independent Colleges and Universities of Texas.\n\nSchreiner University sports teams participate as a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA)'s Division III. The Mountaineers are a member of the Southern Collegiate Athletic Conference (SCAC). Men's sports include baseball, basketball, track and field, cross country, golf, soccer and tennis; while women's sports include basketball, track and field, cross country, golf, soccer, softball, tennis and volleyball. Wrestling was added for the start of the 2018-19 year, only the second program in the state after Wayland Baptist University and the first in the NCAA.\n\nGreek life began at Schreiner University with the chartering of the sorority Delta Phi Epsilon, establishing its Gamma Gamma chapter on January 25, 2003. On May 3 of the same year, the Phi Delta Theta fraternity established its Texas Sigma chapter, being the first fraternity to be officially chartered with 26 founding fathers including Mickey Holt, 2nd baseman of the baseball team. Greek life had been unofficially established on campus earlier, on February 21, 2001, when Chi Phi fraternity founded a colony at Schreiner University; however, the colony was not chartered into the Iota Theta chapter of the Chi Phi fraternity until 2005. On March 25, 2006, the Theta Epsilon chapter of Alpha Sigma Alpha was installed, becoming the second sorority on campus.\n\n\n"}

Bonus stage either have no enemies or hazards, or replace the normal penalties for being struck by enemies or hazards with simply being thrown out of the bonus stage. Many bonus stages need to be activated or discovered in some manner, or certain conditions must be satisfied to access them. Otherwise, they appear after the player has completed a certain number of regular stages. They are often much shorter than regular stages.\n\nUnlike most regular stages, a bonus stage does not normally have to be completed to move on. While a regular stage must be replayed until completion, possibly using up lives or continues upon failures, when a player begins a bonus stage they have one chance at it. Some bonus stages do contain an end location or condition to reach, but regardless of whether the player succeeds or fails, game play resumes at the next regular stage after one attempt. Other bonus stages have no end to reach, the player must simply survive as long as they can before inevitably failing at some point. Some bonus stages have a short time limit, where the player must either complete the stage before the time runs out, or simply survive until the clock runs down to zero. As bonus stages are often shorter and over in one attempt, players cannot as easily practice and perfect their play through of them in the same way as regular stages that permit or demand more attempts upon failure.\n\nIn some games, bonus stages have an interface and game paradigm that is completely different and disconnected from the rest of the game, as in the slot machine bonus stage of \"Super Mario Brothers 2\". Other bonus stages use the same gaming paradigm as the rest of the game, as in the car smashing bonus stage of \"Street Fighter II\" or the bonus stages in \"Super Monkey Ball\" where players collect bananas to earn extra points and lives.\n\nNamco's \"Rally-X\" from 1980s contains a bonus round presented with the title \"CHALLENGING STAGE.\" The gameplay goal is to collect all of the flags in the scrolling maze, but enemy cars don't move. Namco's \"Galaga\" from the following year, also has a \"Challenging Stage\" with enemies that do not attack. The player is rewarded extra points based on how many enemies are eliminated.\n\nMost modern bonus stages reward the player with power-ups rather than points. Modern games have often blurred the traditional distinction between bonus stages and ordinary levels. Most first-person shooter games allow players to enter \"bonus rooms\" within larger (non-bonus) levels to temporarily power up. Some games have optional bonus stages which must be discovered and whose completion impacts the mechanics of the rest of the game, as in the \"Star Road\" levels of \"Super Mario World\".\n\nBonus stages are often confused with \"secret levels\"; however, in the majority of games, they are two distinct things.

He is ranked fifth among the world's 100 top chemists in the list released by Thomson Reuters. In 2009, he was named the Director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and in 2014 he was named a laureate for the National Medal of Science. In 2016 he was named U.C. Berkeley's Vice Chancellor for Research. As of July 1, 2017, he is University of California, Berkeley's Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost, and will continue on as Vice Chancellor for Research on an interim basis.\n\nAlivisatos is also Samsung Distinguished Professor in Nanoscience and Nanotechnology Research and Professor of Chemistry and Materials Science & Engineering at UC Berkeley. In addition, he directs the Kavli Energy Nanosciences Institute (ENSI), a new institute on the UC Berkeley campus launched by the Kavli Foundation to explore the application of nanoscience to sustainable energy technologies.\n\nPaul Alivisatos was born in Chicago, Illinois, where he lived until the age of 10, when his family moved to Athens, Greece. Alivisatos has said of his years in Greece that it was a great experience for him because he had to learn the Greek language and culture then catch up with the more advanced students. \"When I found something very interesting it was sometimes a struggle for me to understand it the very best that I could,\" he has said of that experience. \"That need to work harder became an important motivator for me.\" Alivisatos returned to the United States to attend the University of Chicago in the late seventies.\n\nIn 1981, Alivisatos earned a B.A. with honors in chemistry from the University of Chicago. In 1986, he received a Ph.D. in physical chemistry from the University of California, Berkeley, where he worked under Charles Harris. His Ph.D. thesis concerned the photophysics of electronically excited molecules near metal and semiconductor surfaces. He then joined AT&T Bell Labs working with Louis E. Brus, and began research in the field of nanotechnology.\n\nAlivisatos returned to UC Berkeley in 1988 as an assistant professor of chemistry, becoming associate professor in 1993 and professor in 1995. He served as Chancellor's Professor from 1998-2001, and added an appointment as a professor of materials science and engineering in 1999.\n\nAlivisatos’ affiliation with Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (or Berkeley Lab) began in 1991 when he joined the staff of the Materials Sciences Division. From 2005 to 2007 Alivisatos served as Berkeley Lab's Associate Laboratory Director for the Physical Sciences area. In 2008, he served as Deputy Lab Director under Berkeley Lab Director Steven Chu, and then as interim director when Chu stepped down to become the Secretary of Energy. He was named the seventh Director of the Berkeley Lab on November 19, 2009, by the University of California Board of Regents on the recommendation of UC President Mark Yudof and with the concurrence of the U.S. Department of Energy.\n\nEnergy Secretary Steven Chu noted that Alivisatos is \"an incredible scientist with incredible judgment on a variety of issues. He’s level-headed and calm, and he has an ability to inspire people…[and he can] take projects from material science to real-world applications.\"\n\nAlivisatos is an internationally recognized authority on nanochemistry and a pioneer in the synthesis of semiconductor quantum dots and multi-shaped artificial nanostructures. Further, he is a world expert on the chemistry of nanoscale crystals; one of his papers (Science, 271: 933-937, 1996) has been cited over 9,100 times. He is also an expert on how these can be applied, for example as biological markers (e.g., Science, 281: 2013-16, 1998; a paper cited over 7,400 times). In addition, his use of DNA in this area (DNA nanotechnology) has shown the surprising versatility of this molecule. He has used it to direct crystal growth and create new materials, as in Nature, 382: 609-11, 1996, and even to measure nanoscale distances (see Nature Nanotechnology, 1: 47-52, 2006).\n\nHe is widely recognized as being the first to demonstrate that semiconductor nanocrystals can be grown into complex two-dimensional shapes, as opposed to simple one-dimensional spheres. Alivisatos proved that controlling the growth of nanocrystals is the key to controlling both their size and shape. This achievement altered the nanoscience landscape and paved the way for a slew of new potential applications, including biomedical diagnostics, revolutionary photovoltaic cells, and LED materials.\n\nNanocrystals are aggregates of anywhere from a few hundred to tens of thousands of atoms that combine into a crystalline form of matter known as a \"cluster.\" Typically a few nanometers in diameter, nanocrystals are larger than molecules but smaller than bulk solids and therefore often exhibit physical and chemical properties somewhere in between. Given that a nanocrystal is virtually all surface and no interior, its properties can vary considerably as the crystal grows in size.\n\nPrior to Alivisatos’ research, all non-metal nanocrystals were dot-shaped, meaning they were essentially one-dimensional. No techniques had been reported for making two-dimensional or rod-shaped semiconductor nanocrystals that would also be of uniform size. However, in a landmark paper that appeared in the March 2, 2000 issue of the journal Nature, Alivisatos reported on techniques used to select the size but vary the shapes of the nanocrystals produced. This was hailed as a major breakthrough in nanocrystal fabrication because rod-shaped semiconductor nanocrystals can be stacked to create nano-sized electronic devices.\n\nThe rod-shaped nanocrystal research, coupled with earlier work led by Alivisatos in which it was shown that quantum dots or \"qdots\"–nanometer-sized crystal dots (spheres a few billionths of a meter in size)– made from semiconductors such as cadmium selenide can emit multiple colors of light depending upon the size of the crystal, opened the door to using nanocrystals as fluorescent probes for the study of biological materials, biomedical research tools and aids to diagnosis, and as light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Alivisatos went on to use his techniques to create an entirely new generation of hybrid solar cells that combined nanotechnology with plastic electronics.\n\nAlivisatos is the founding scientist of Quantum Dot Corporation, a company that makes crystalline nanoscale tags that are used in the study of cell behavior. (Quantum Dot is now part of Life Technologies.) He also founded the nanotechnology company Nanosys, and Solexant, a photovoltaic start-up that has since restarted as Siva Power. His research has led to the development of applications in range of industries, including bioimaging (for example, the use of quantum dots for luminescent labeling of biological tissue); display technologies (his quantum dot emissive film is found in the Kindle Fire HDX tablet); and renewable energy (solar applications of quantum dots).\n\nMore than 20 as of 2014.\n\nUnder Alivisatos’ leadership, Berkeley Lab has embarked upon an ambitious period of strategic scientific infrastructure renewal, and shifted its priorities to the more interdisciplinary areas of renewable energy and climate-change research. During his tenure, the Lab began construction on new buildings for computational research, buildings efficiency, solar energy research, and biological science. During this time, the Lab also cleared the legacy Bevatron site and has partially cleared and is working to finish cleaning the \"Old Town\" site. This has left the Lab better able to contribute to the Department of Energy's mission today, and with room for potential growth on brownfield sites in the future. In addition, Alivisatos has proactively invigorated Berkeley Lab's safety culture, elevated the Lab's community outreach and operational efficiency efforts, and is currently working to build a more diverse and inclusive community within the lab. On March 23, 2015 Alvisatos announced that he is stepping down as Director when a replacement is identified.\n\nAs he develops these initiatives across the Lab, Alivisatos has remained focused on integrating the Lab into the nation's innovation ecosystem, especially in the areas of energy and the environment. While some of the groundwork for this integration was laid by former Director Steve Chu, Alivisatos has led efforts to leverage the wide range of scientific capabilities at Berkeley Lab with a variety of industry partners and entrepreneurs. These public/private sector collaborations have resulted in technology transfer for industries as diverse as automobiles and medicine, and have contributed to an increased speed of development in manufacturing and renewable energy.\n\nIn addition to his emphasis on innovation and outreach to the private sector, Alivisatos is also working to create a more closely connected network of the U.S. Dept. of Energy's 17 national labs. He serves as the chair of the National Lab Directors Council, and has encouraged greater alignment and collaboration across the labs on such issues as diversity and workforce development.\n\nAlivisatos has also been outspoken on the issue of basic science funding at the federal level and America's ability to stay competitive in the areas global scientific research and development.\n\n\nIn addition to those listed above, Alivisatos has held fellowships with the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Physical Society (1996), and the American Chemical Society. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.\n\n\nFor a full list of publications, see http://www.cchem.berkeley.edu/pagrp/publications.html\n\n\nAlivisatos is the founding editor of \"Nano Letters\", a publication of the American Chemical Society. He formerly served on the Senior Editorial Board of \"Science\". He has also served on the editorial advisory boards of\" ACS Nano\", the \"Journal of Physical Chemistry\", \"Chemical Physics\", the \"Journal of Chemical Physics\", and \"Advanced Materials\".\n\n"}

He went to high school in Costa Rica but was expelled, and went to live with his sister in Boston, Massachusetts, graduating from The Cambridge School of Weston in Massachusetts. He then attended Harvard University's documentary program where he learned filmmaking. He eventually left for Wesleyan University, where he met future collaborators Matthew Greenfield and Mike White.\n\nAfter graduating in 1989, his student film \"Every Day is a Beautiful Day\" won a Student Academy Award, which got him a job as a second assistant camera to Jonathan Demme on the documentary \"Cousin Bobby\". Demme then recommended him to the AFI Conservatory, and Arteta received his MFA there in 1993.\n\nArteta's first film, \"Star Maps\", is a dark tale of a Mexican teenage boy and aspiring actor who is pimped by his father as a male prostitute in Los Angeles. It debuted at the Sundance Film Festival. It was a critical hit, receiving five Independent Spirit Award nominations, including Best First Feature and Best First Screenplay. He then turned to directing television shows, helming episodes of \"\", \"Freaks and Geeks\", and \"Six Feet Under\". He has also since directed episodes of \"The Office\", \"Ugly Betty\", and \"American Horror Story\".\n\nArteta achieved critical acclaim and won a 2001 Independent Spirit Award for Best Feature Under $500,000 for \"Chuck & Buck\", which teamed him with his fellow Wesleyan alumni Greenfield (film producer) and White (screenwriter and star). It is a story of male friendship and homoerotic desire, featuring a 27-year old man who tracks down his former best friend and stalks him, hoping to re-enact their childhood sex games. The trio worked together once more on 2002's \"The Good Girl\", starring Jennifer Aniston, a retelling of Flaubert's Madame Bovary set in the American Midwest. \n\nArteta's \"Youth in Revolt\", a comedy starring Michael Cera, was released in 2010.

It lies in the Yellow Sea off Korea's west coast, separated from Gimpo on the South Korean mainland by a narrow channel spanned by two bridges and from Kaesong (Gaeseong) in North Korea by the main channel of the Han River.\n\nThe island is strategically located, controlling access to the river which runs through the former Joseon and present South Korean capital Seoul. Its fortifications were repeatedly attacked during the 19th century. With an area of , it now constitutes most of Ganghwa County, a division of Incheon Municipality. It has a population of about 65,500 people, half of whom live in Ganghwa Town (Ganghwa-eup) on the northeast.\n\n\"Ganghwado\" or \"Ganghwa-do\" (, formerly ) is Korean for \"Island Made Prosperous\", \"Illustrious\", or \"Flourishing by the River\" in reference to its formation from the silt carried downriver by the Han. Former romanizations include Kang-hoa and Kang-hwa.\n\nThis island lies in the estuary of Korea's Han River. It is , measuring long and wide, making it the 4th largest island in South Korea. Its highest point is Mani-san ( above sea level).\n\n\nGanghwa Island's Turnip (cultivar of \"Brassica rapa\") has been cultivated in Ganghwa for over a thousand years. The moisture content is over 90% and its main component is carbohydrate. They are a taproot vegetable that has a smell of mustard and tastes like ginseng. This distinctive taste is due to its dark purple part.\n\nBoth turnip seeds and full grown turnip are used as an ingredient for folk remedies and oriental medicine because it contains beneficial ingredients for our body. The turnip's leaves have a lot of nutrients and vitamins and the roots contain tryptophan and glycyrrhizin.\nIt has the trait of anticancer activity and helps to cure dermatopathy, digestion organs, tuberculosis and respiratory disease, and anti-bacterial effect.\n\n\nIn Ganghwa Island, there is a specific kind of wormwood that is more effective and outstanding than regular wormwood.\n\nAlleged benefits:\n\n\nGanghwa's Hwamunseok (woven sedge mat) is an elegant and refined handicraft that dates back to Goryeo Dynasty.\n\nIt is cool and absorbs moisture well in the summer, while also preventing chill in the winter.\n\nTherefore, Hwamunseok helps to maintain one's health.\n\n\nIt is produced only in Gangwha. Unlike normal sweet potato, it is high in sugar and very soft, which is good for digestion.\n\n\nThere is a yearly azalea festival held every mid-April in Ganghwa. During the festival, you can make azalea hwajeon which is a pan-fried sweet rice cake with flower petals. Also, a photo and postcard exhibition will take place.\n\n\nEvery year at the beginning of October, the salted shrimp festival is held at the Oepo-ri dock, in Ganghwa. You can watch many different kinds of performances and song festivals. Also, you can make Kimchi using cabbage and salted shrimp. There is a salted shrimp auction, but it is almost free. If a manager specifies the price to be 1,000 won, it will be sold to the person who called 900 won rather than 10,000 won.\n\n\nEvery year, Ganghwa Foundation Day Grand Festival is held at Chamseongdan on Mt. Mani. Chamseongdan was an altar used to offer sacrifices to heaven by Dangun, a legendary founding father of Gojoseon. Ganghwa Foundation Day Grand Festival is held from October 1 until October 3. At this festival, you can see seven Taoist fairies who dance holding fans. On October 3, you can also see carrying sacred fire.\n\nGanghwa Nadeulgil is a walking tour line consisting of 20 courses. People can witness history from the prehistoric age to the Joseon dynasty and also experience the natural ecologic environment of global mud flat and the migrate habitats of birds.\n\nRecently, the ‘나들길 app’ was launched so that people can enjoy a walking tour more conveniently.\n\nIt is 1.5 km west at Ganghwado. The area is 42.31 km and the length of the coastline is 42.0 km. Seokmodo is located at 126°20′ degrees east longitude and 37°40′ degrees north latitude. The island currently home to around 1,800 inhabitants. ‘Seokmodo’ appears in 『Daedongyeojido』 and can be interpreted as ‘Water flowing around a corner’ or ‘A rocky beach corner’.\n\nThere is 'Ganghwa Nadeul-gil'. Starting from Seokpori dock, tourist can walk by dark-colored ditch and see the vast tidal mudflats unfold in front of tourist. After passing by Bomun dock and a fishing port while walking along the Jebang-gil road, visitors will pass through a quiet and peaceful forest. At the far end of the forest, there is Seokmodo Island's one and only beach called Minmeoru Beach. Keep walking along the Jebang-gil with the sea on left and Mount Nakga on the right, and tourist will arrive at Bomun Temple where this course ends. *Course: Seokmodo dock - Maeeum-ri dock - Fishing port - Minmeoru Beach -Eoryujeonghang - Bomunsa (10 miles, 5 hours. Level: Easy)\n\nGanghwa Pungmul Market is a place with long history. A new building for the market was built in 2007, and you can buy grains, vegetables, fruits, etc. in a cheap price.\n\nDealt goods: grains, vegetables, fruits, salted seafood, fresh meat, dried fish, tofu, ginseng, etc.\n\nThis was the palace site of Goryeo from 1232 to 1270.\n\nposition: Incheon Metropolitan City Ganghwa-gun the north gate street(Bungmun street) 42\n\nThe Goryeogung Palace Site leads to the cherry blossom tree path on a northern hill (Bukssan) so many people come to see the cherry blossoms in spring and are often used as hiking trails.\n\nMani Mountain is the highest mountain in Ganghwa.\n\nThere is the home of Chamseongdan Altar where Dangun Wanggeom performed ancestral rites in the top of this mountain.\n\nGanghwa Tidal Power Generation Company comprises Dae woo, Lotte, Hyundae and Kolon. They have signed a memorandum of understanding regarding the joint development of tidal power generation and reinforcement facilities in the Ganghwa County of Incheon in South Korea. This 1.4 trillion won worth project will be financed through private capital. 1.4 generators with a capacity of 30 MW will be fitted in 4-km-long tidal wave dam that Will be constructed around the Ganghwa Islands. This project is expected to be completed in 2023.\n\nAs the location of the primary fortifications protecting the Joseon capital of Seoul from foreign invasion, Ganghwa Island was the site of several punitive expeditions during the 19th century. The mass execution of Catholic French missionaries and Korean converts under the ministry of the Heungseon Daewongun in the mid-1860s led to a French invasion in 1866 which held the island for several weeks, although Admiral Roze was unable to sail up the shallow and uncharted Han River and fortified monasteries prevented overland incursion. In 1871, a Korean assault on an American diplomatic mission led to the Battle of Ganghwa. Rear Admiral Rodgers took five forts on the island but withdrew after the Koreans refused to meet for negotiations. Following a diplomatic incident related to Korea's refusal to recognize the imperial status of the sovereign of Japan in 1868, the forts at Ganghwa fired upon a Japanese boat from the surveying gunship \"Un'yō\" in 1875. During the Japanese Battle of Ganghwa, the \"Un'yō\"'s captain Inoue Yoshika silenced the batteries with superior firepower, then landed a raiding force which plundered local communities. The Imperial Japanese Navy then blockaded the area and compelled the 1876 Treaty of Ganghwa, which opened Korea to Japanese commerce.\nWhen the Mongolia aggression Goryeo, Choe-woo the Goryeo's general changed the capital to Ganghwa at sixth aggression. And they prepared the war. At that time, Goryeo's religion was Buddhism. They want to save their country, so they borrowed the power of Buddha. In this process, the Tripitaka Koreana was made. The Tripitaka Koreana was called Palmandaejanggyeong. It is comprehensive collection of 80,000 Buddhist scriptures.\n\nIn 1866, the \"General Sherman\" arrived at Pyongyang through the Daedong River. The owner of this ship was American, but the ship's captain was Danish, and crews were Chinese and British. One of them was pastor Thomas, who was traveling for missionary work to Joseon. Initially, Pyongyang governor Park Gyu-su, who was Park Ji-won's grandson, informed about his refusal of the trade and advised them to go back.\n\nSome people of Pyongyang provided pork and chicken to them, even ignoring the kidnapping Lee Ik-Hyun, a Joseon soldier who had shot a cannon at the boat, killing 7. Citizens and Park Gyu-su were furious. Park Gyu-su ordered to open fire on the ship. The \"General Sherman\" and all the crew was burned.\n\nIn 1871, during the Joseon expedition, America finally decided to open a port. The United States of America ordered the Joseon expedition to Asia led by Fleet Commander Rogers.\n\nOn June 1, The United States of America led sounding navigation of Ganghwa Strait. When the fleet arrived to Sondolmok, it was attacked from the coastline by Ganghwa artillery unit.\n\nThe American fleet scorched the Chojijin Fort and took it over with naval gunfire. The American army then took over Deokjjinjin Fort on June 11, and began the Gwangseongbo operation. After an hour of shelling of land and sea, the American army captured and took over Gwangseongbo.\n\nThe scale that damage of human life caused by war.\nFirst, damage of the US was: 3 people dead in battle, 10 people wounded. On the other hand, the damage to Joseon was: 350 people dead in battle, 20 people wounded. It can be seen that the damage to Josean is larger than the damage to the United States.\n\nHeungseon Daewongun is the father of King Gojong. Heungseon Daewongun erected Cheokhwabi in each region of the whole country. In every Cheokhwabi he put the inscription: “If you don’t fight against the western barbarians, it means you negotiate for peace. And that is selling our country.” What is more, he strengthened the national isolation policy. Therefore, Cheokhwabi is a monument to exclude westerners.\n\nCheokhwabi is located in Deokseong-ri, Bureun-myeon, Ganghwa-gun. The name of the one located in Ganghwa-gun is Deokjinjin gyeong-gobi, it is also called ‘Cheokhwabi of the sea.’ There is a sentence in the front of the monument written in characters, that says: ‘it is guarding the sea gate, thus foreign ship cannot pass. There is a bullet mark remained on it.\n\nAfter the Unhyo Incident, Japan demanded unilateral compensation from Joseon.\nJoseon was coerced to grant Japan the right of extraterritoriality, permission for ocean measurement and the opening of three ports in Pusan, Incheon and Wonsan. \nAlthough normally extraterritoriality applies to diplomats, common Japanese who lived in Joseon also gained this right. \nBefore, Joseon was isolated because of the Daewongun's closed-door policy.\nBy signing the contract Joseon was to appear on the global stage.\nThe terms of the treaty were unequal, and are regarded as the first step towards Japanese colonialism.\n\n"}
{"id": "2086403", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2086403", "title": "Hawes", "text": "Hawes\n\nHawes is a small market town and civil parish in Upper Wensleydale in the Richmondshire district of North Yorkshire, England, that was granted its market charter in 1699. Historically in the North Riding of Yorkshire, Hawes is located at the head of Wensleydale in the Yorkshire Dales; the River Ure runs to the north of the town and is regarded as one of the honeypot tourist attractions of the Yorkshire Dales National Park. It is known as the home to the Yorkshire Wensleydale Cheese.\n\nThe population in 2011 was 887; the estimated population in 2016 was 893.\nThe parish of Hawes also includes the neighbouring hamlet of Gayle. The population of the full parish was 1,137 in 2011 and was estimated at 1,138 in 2016. Hawes is west of the county town of Northallerton. The Wensleydale Creamery is a major producer of Yorkshire Wensleydale cheese.\n\nDescribed by Reader's Digest as \"The Village That Refused to Die\", Hawes has a very active non-profit community group that seeks funding and uses the money to re-open keep community amenities that were closing.\n\nThere is no mention in the \"Domesday Book\" of a settlement where the current town is. There is little mention of the town until the 15th century when the population had risen enough for a chapel of ease to be built. The settlement was first recorded in 1307 as having a marketplace.\n\nThe place's name is derived from the Old Norse word \"hals\", meaning \"neck\" or \"pass between mountains\".\n\nThe town was granted a charter to hold markets by King William III in 1699. It allowed for a weekly Tuesday market and two fairs a year. In 1887 an auction market was established in the town that held cattle sales fortnightly. In addition, five cattle fairs and three sheep fairs were held each year. Soon after, four cheese fairs spread over the year also became a regular event in the town.\n\nThe Richmond to Lancaster Turnpike was diverted in 1795 and from then on, it passed through Hawes. The Wensleydale Railway reached Hawes in 1878. The village once had a railway station that was the terminus of the Hawes branch of the Midland Railway and an end-on terminus of the line from Northallerton from its opening in 1878 to its closure in April 1954. British Railways kept the line to Garsdale Junction open for passengers until 1959. The Wensleydale Railway Association which operates a heritage train has plans to rebuild the railway from Northallerton (from its current western terminus at Redmire) to Garsdale including re-opening the station in the village. Hawes railway station remains in its original site, now part of the Dales Countryside Museum. Since 2015, the building has been rented to a business operating a bike shop and later a cafe.\n\nIn the past, a water powered mill operated at Gayle and in Hawes; the Gayle Mill, North Yorkshire, for example, was built in 1784. The mills were used to grind corn, produce textiles (wool, cotton, linen, silk, flax), generate electricity or saw wood. Limestone was burnt in kilns. In 1789, Gayle Mill adopted new technology, and became a mechanised sawmill powered by a double-vortex turbine. In 1919, part of the mill was hired to provide electricity to the area using turbines for the generator. The mill provided electricity for the village until 1948.\n\nThe town lies within the Richmond UK Parliament constituency. It also lies within the Upper Dales electoral division of North Yorkshire County Council and the Hawes & High Abbotside ward of Richmondshire District Council.\n\nThe civil parish shares a grouped parish council with the civil parish of High Abbotside, known as Hawes & High Abbotside Parish Council. This is also an electoral ward with a combined population taken at the 2011 Census of 1,347.\n\nThe 2001 UK census showed that the population was split 50% male to 50% female. The religious constituency was made of 82% Christian, 1.5% Jewish and the rest stating no religion or not stating at all. The ethnic make-up was 97.9% White British, 1.3% White other, 0.5% Mixed ethnic and 0.3% Chinese. There were 601 dwellings.\n\nThe 2011 UK census showed that the population was split 50.1% male to 49.91% female. The religious constituency was made of 70.8% Christian, 3.8% Buddhist, 0.1% Muslim and the rest stating no religion or not stating at all. The ethnic make-up was 91.4% White British, 3.5% White Other, 0.3% Mixed Ethnic, 4.2% British Asian and 0.4% each British Black. There were 683 dwellings.\n\nThe parish of Hawes covers the large areas of moorland on Dodd Fell, Snays Fell, Stags Fell and Widdale Fell and includes the River Ure tributaries of Widdale Beck and Gayle Beck. The latter flows through the town of Hawes. There are many abandoned lead mines, quarries and limekilns in the parish indicating its industrial past. A short distance from the town on Gayle Beck are the Aysgill Force waterfalls. The highest point in the parish is Great Knoutberry Hill at . The parish extends as far north as Hellgill Bridge along a narrow strip either side of the Ure.\n\nThe civil parish of Hawes also includes the neighbouring hamlets of Gayle, Appersett and Burtersett. The A684 road from Sedbergh to Osmotherley passes through the town and the B6255 begins at the western edge of the town and links it to Ingleton.\n\nThe M6 and the A1 to the east are under an hour away by car.\n\nNow the largest company, with a staff of 224 (spring 2018) and visited by 250,000 people each year, the Wensleydale Creamery Centre closed down in 1992; at that time, it was owned by Dairy Crest. Within six months, four ex-employees and a local businessman purchased the dormant creamery and reopened it. The operation moved to its current location in 2015 and still handcrafts the eponymous cheese using traditional recipes following those first done by French monks in the 12th century. (Cheese has been made in this village since about 1150.) Wensleydale Creamery has won many prestigious cheese awards, including \"Supreme Champion\" in 2018 for its new Yorkshire Cheddar at The Great Yorkshire Show’s Cheese and Dairy Show. Yorkshire Wensleydale took the \"Reserve Supreme\" Cheese title. The company also received ten other trophies.\n\nThe cheeses produced by the Creamery applied for \"Protected Food Name Status\". The application was successful and the protected geographical indication certificate was received. The term \"Yorkshire Wensleydale\" can only be used for cheese that is made in Wensleydale.\n\nThe farms around Hawes raise sheep and cattle and grow meadow grass for hay and silage. Tourism is important to Hawes; it is a market town with shops and accommodation for visitors. Over 40 farms in the general area supply the Creamery with milk.\n\nA National Park Centre iLocal is located in the village, with a large parking area, beside the Countryside Museum. Attractions include the Dales Countryside Museum, attached to the in the old Hawes railway station of the Wensleydale Railway, nearby Hardraw Force waterfall, and the Buttertubs Pass which links Wensleydale to Swaledale. Hawes has a regular market on Tuesdays, as well as many shops, pubs and tearooms. Hawes is a centre for walking (hiking) the countryside and the Pennine Way passes through here. There is a youth hostel located on Lancaster Terrace at the western end of the town.\n\nThe bookseller Steve Bloom was based in Hawes. His policy of charging a 50 pence entry fee to his shop made him nationally notorious.\n\nJust south of Hawes, the 18th century Gayle Mill is now a Grade II listed building, a scheduled monument. In 2004, it was featured in BBC2's Restoration programme. It came in the top three in the national finals. Restoration of the mill started in the same year and works to bring the site to operational standard took four years and cost over £1m. Although it was still open to visitors during the 2017 tourist season, the Gayle Mill Trust that operates the attraction was advised by the North of England Civic Trust in early 2018 that the mill would need to be closed. Work would be necessary to remedy problems discovered since the restoration in order to ensure safety and to comply with insurance regulations. The site was vacated in March 2018. The Civic Trust was hoping that the work could be completed in time to reopen it at Easter 2019. Fundraising was under way in summer 2018.\n\nHawes Community Primary School provides primary education for the town and nearby settlements. It was established in 1878 and the school retains log books dating back to those dates. Pupils received secondary education at \"The Wensleydale School & Sixth Form\" in Leyburn. The Community School was rated as inadequate by an Ofsted report in late 2015; an action plan was established by North Yorkshire County Council to ensure improvement. In spring 2018, the school had 114 students. The closest secondary school is 17 miles from the village.\n\nThe town has a retained fire station, which means that they are crewed by firefighters who provide on-call cover from home or their place of work. The station is operated by the North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.\n\nMedical care is available at the Hawes Surgery of The Health Centre. Three physicians serve this office and the one in Aysgarth. The nearest hospitals are Friary Hospital in Richmond () and Castleberg Hospital in Settle (). \nOn weekends and bank holiday Mondays, the DalesBus travels among various villages, including Hawes, from Easter Sunday until late summer. Several other buses provide a year-round service stopping at Hawes and other villages in the area.\n\nThe only petrol station at Hawes was expected to close in 2017 due to falling sales, and the next nearest re-fuelling station involved a round trip. A non-profit community group, the Upper Dales Community Partnership (UDCP), took a three-year lease on the station October 2017 after North Yorkshire County Council awarded a grant to the community grant. The Dale Head Garage is so remote that the town receives a £0.05 rebate from the government on every litre of fuel sold. This benefit is passed on directly to consumers at the pump. A grant in May 2018 from the\nRichmondshire District Council’s Economic Growth Fund enabled the petrol station to remain open 24 hours a day. \nIn previous years, UDCP had also taken over the library and the post office. In February 2018 however, Royal Mail announced that the sorting department in the village would close. In addition to the loss of jobs, the plan would have meant that residents would be required to drive 30 minutes to Leyburn to pick up packages. Lobbying by village residents convinced the Post Office to cancel its plans.\n\nThe Partnership also started a bus service in 2011 when the previous service ceased operation. The Little White Bus has 11 vehicles and transports 60,000 visitors per year. After the police station was shut down, the constables were given a room in the community group's office which houses the Post Office and Library, and also offers free Wi-Fi, a coffee machine and a scanner/printer for use by residents. In 2018, the Partnership was considering a plan to start a Land Trust that would build four new houses and rent them to low-income families with children.\n\nFormed over 20 years ago, the Partnership has 25 paid staff and 60 volunteers (May 2018). In 2017, the head of the non-profit group explained the original concept to \"The Times\". Unlike other communities which ask, \"Why isn't the government providing for us?\", the philosophy at Hawes has been, \"If you aren't going to provide for us we are going to provide it for ourselves\".\n\nThe church in Hawes is dedicated to St Margaret of Antioch. The current building was rebuilt in 1850 on the site of the former chapel of ease and is a Grade II listed building. There were Wesleyan and Congregational chapels in the village as well as the Sandemanians and a Friends Meeting House.\n\nThe Methodist Church in Hawes was built in 1856 and was part of the Wensleydale Circuit. It closed in 2015, was sold in early 2017, and placed again on the market in early 2018.\n"}

Mahajani refers to the Hindi word for 'bankers', also known as 'sarrafi' or 'kothival' (merchant).\n\nMahajani has been used as a primary accounting script for Marwari traders and for the use of Hindi and Punjabi in a wide region across northwest India and eastern Pakistan. It was taught in merchant schools as part of the education system. A vast majority of documents in which it is found are financial documents, in addition to primers. Its use has been reported by bookkeepers in Haryana as the Langdi script, although its relationship with Langdi is uncertain. Mahajani descended from Landa scripts in the greater Punjab region in historic times and was well known as a merchant's script throughout north India. It may have also been influenced by Kaithi and Devanagari.\n\nIt has fewer vowels than most North Indian scripts, and the use of them is optional. The vowels i and u can represent both their short and long forms in addition to diphthongs and related vowels. Since vowels are optional, they must be interpreted in context for most Mahajani texts. There are no special conjunct consonant forms, and there are no viramas to indicate them. Nasalization, if indicated, is typically represented by 'na'. It also has various fraction marks, accounting marks, and textual organization marks, to indicate paragraph and word spacing, and abbreviation, punctuation, and space marks. As many Mahajani texts are accounting books, accounting symbols have been found, but they are undergoing further research for proper encoding.

Designed by Patrick Stirling, they are characterised by a single pair of large (8' 1\") driving wheels which led to the nickname \"\"eight-footer\"\". Originally the locomotive was designed to haul up to 26 passenger carriages at an average speed of .\"\n\nOn his arrival at GNR, Stirling set out to standardise the railway's rolling stock. He also borrowed a 'single-wheeler' from the Great Eastern Railway and, in 1868, designed two versions of 2-2-2 with driving wheels.\n\nThe outcome, in 1870 was a locomotive with driving wheels, designed specifically for high speed expresses between York and London. The norm in those days was inside cylinders. Not only were there frequent failures of the cranked axle shafts, with such large driving wheels, they would have set the boiler too high. He therefore used outside cylinders with a four-wheeled bogie for lateral stability at the front end. According to Hamilton Ellis's description entitled 'Pat Stirling's masterpiece,' the design was a version of a 2-2-2 designed by Stirling for the Glasgow and South Western Railway, 'considerably enlarged, and provided with a leading bogie.'\n\nA total of 53 were built at Doncaster between 1870 and 1895, in three series introduced in 1870, 1884, and 1894;. (George Frederick Bird, referred to the three series as 'G, G2 and G3 classes' in 1910, and this classification has been used in other sources but it does not appear to have been used officially by the GNR.)\n\nThe GNR did not number its locomotives sequentially, instead using numbers freed up by withdrawing older locomotives. Thus the 1870 series was numbered between GNR No. 1 and 671, the 1884 series 771-8 and 1001-2, and 1894 series 1003-8.\n\nThese locomotives were able to haul trains at an average of , with a top speed, on lighter trains, of , taking part in the 1895 Race to the North. GNR Stirling No 775 made the from Grantham to York in 1 hour 16 minutes. This translates to an average speed of .\n\nMembers of the 1894 series were originally built weighing but following two high-speed derailments in 1895 the weight was reduced by 1% to .\n\n\nWith the arrival of the Ivatt Atlantics after 1898, the class began to be displaced from the most prestigious express services. Several examples were rebuilt by H.A. Ivatt after 1898 with a domed boiler, but withdrawals of the 1870 series began in 1899. The last examples of the class were in use on secondary services until 1916.\nThe first of the class, No 1 is the only engine to be preserved. It is exhibited at the National Railway Museum, York.\n\nThe locomotive is in good mechanical condition, and was used recently to act as a star player in York Theatre Royal's stage-performance of The Railway Children play, in which it was seen to move into a stage set of a period station, created initially at the National Railway Museum and more recently in the redundant Waterloo International station.\n\nThe locomotive appeared to be in steam for its 'performances', however it was not, with fog machine generated smoke being used to portray escaping steam. In reality the locomotive was shunted into position during the performance using a Class 08 Diesel Shunter which remained out of sight of the main stage.\n\nAn 18\" gauge model of No.1 was built in 1898, at the Regent Street Polytechnic, from a set of parts supplied by W. G. Bagnall. Amongst the students at Regent Street who worked on the model was Henry Greenly who later became a celebrated miniature locomotive builder and supplied locomotives for the Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway. The locomotive was initially sold to Mr.E.F.S. Notter the Great Northern Railway District Locomotive Superintendent at Kings Cross, who between 1910 and 1914 operated it at Alexander Park (London) and later kept it in King Cross 'Top Shed', the home of the full size Stirling Singles. In 1926 this locomotive was bought by the Fairbourne Miniature Railway and in 1936 it was sold to the Jaywick Miniature Railway, which ran it until 1939. It then passed through the hands of a number of private owners until it was bought by the World of Country Life Museum at Sandy Bay, Exmouth, Devon, in 1986.\n\nBagnall had earlier, in 1893, supplied a similar model (works number 1425) to Lord Downshire of Easthampstead Park, Crowthorne Berkshire. This engine was later preserved by Mr Hoare in the Boys Reading Room at the Training Ship \"Mercury\" at Hamble. It was subsequently sold to a private owner in Southampton in 1946. Its current whereabouts is unknown.\n\nNuremberg toymaker Georges Carette's range included a 2.5 inch-gauge model of Stirling Single 776, in around ~1900. It was marketed in the UK by Bassett-Lowke, appearing in their 1904 catalogue.\n\nAn unpowered 5\" gauge model of a Stirling Single locomotive, engineered by Dennis Hefford, is on display at the entrance to Arch Two of Brighton Toy and Model Museum.\n\nA 1/12 scale model of No.93, built by 'R Jackson' around 1888, is displayed at Worthing Museum and Art Gallery.\n\nKitmaster produced an injection moulded plastic kit of the Stirling Single in the 1950s. David Boyle, founder of Dapol Model Railways, recalls seeing the moulds being destroyed in the early 1980s, leading him to purchase the tooling for and reissue the remaining Kitmaster kits.\n\nAster Hobby introduced Gauge1 live steam model in 1996.\n\nIn April 2015, Rapido Trains announced that a forthcoming OO gauge model would be exclusively available from Locomotion Models.\n\n\n\n"}

Her eldest brother, Sancho VII of Navarre, succeeded their father as King of Navarre and was the last male descendant of the first dynasty of Kings of Navarre, the Pamplona dynasty, dying childless. Her elder sister Berengaria of Navarre married Richard I of England.\n\nBlanche married Theobald III, Count of Champagne on July 1, 1199 at Chartres, when she was 22 years old and he was 20 years old. However, Theobald III died young on May 24, 1201, leaving her pregnant. When she gave birth to a son (on May 30, 1201), he immediately became Count Theobald IV of Champagne (Theobald I of Navarre). Blanche ruled the county as regent until Theobald turned 21 years old in 1222. The regency was plagued by a number of difficulties. Blanche's brother-in-law, count Henry II had left behind a great deal of debt.\n\nFurthermore, their son Theobald IV's right to the succession of Champagne was challenged by Henry's daughter Philippa and her husband, Erard I of Brienne, Count of Ramerupt and one of the more powerful Champagne nobles. The conflict with the Briennes broke into open warfare in 1215, in what became known as the Champagne War of Succession, and was not resolved until after Theobald came of age in 1222. At that time Theobald and Blanche bought out their rights for a substantial monetary payment. Blanche had also arranged the dowry of Henry II's elder daughter Alice of Champagne, when she married the young Hugh I of Cyprus. In the 1230s, in order to settle with Alice, Theobald IV had to sell his overlordship over the counties of Blois, Sancerre, and Châteaudun to Louis IX of France.\n\nWith her regency completed, in 1222 Blanche withdrew to the Cistercian convent of Argensolles, whose foundation she had funded herself, for her retirement.\n\nSince some barons suspected Theobald for having a hand in the death of Louis VIII (in November 1226), Blanche of Castile withdrew his invitation to the coronation of Louis IX and proffered it to Blanche instead.\n\nBlanche also took over administration of the kingdom of Navarre when her brother Sancho VII went into retirement (\"El Encerrado\").\n\nBlanche died on March 13, 1229, seven years after the end of her regency, at the age of 52. In her will she left 5 marks of gold to the Cathedral of Reims, which was used to build a statue to contain the Holy Milk of the Virgin.\n\nAfter Blanche's death, her brother in retirement remained as King of Navarre and her son Theobald continued as Count of Champagne. Their eldest sister, Berengaria of Navarre, Queen of England (widow of Richard the Lionheart), died without issue in 1230, leaving Sancho as the sole surviving child of Sancho VI. When he died in 1234, Blanca's son Theobald IV of Champagne was recognized as the next King of Navarre. Theobald had married twice during Blanche's lifetime and had one daughter by the time of her death, who was also named Blanche.\n\nBlanche had two children with Theobald III of Champagne:\n"}
{"id": "2086470", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2086470", "title": "Alan Keith Davidson", "text": "Alan Keith Davidson\n\nAlan Keith Davidson, (born 14 June 1929) is an Australian former cricketer of the 1950s and 1960s. He was an all rounder: a hard-hitting lower-order left-handed batsman, and an outstanding left-arm fast-medium opening bowler. Strongly built and standing six feet tall, Davidson was known for his hard hitting power, which yielded many long hit sixes. His left arm bowling was a mainstay of the Australian pace attack of the 1950s and early 1960s, and from the late 1950s widely regarded as one of the finest pace bowlers in the world, with a classical bowling action which imparted late swing. Davidson was considered along with Wasim Akram as one of the two greatest left arm fast bowlers in history, and bowled with great control, conceding less than two runs per over. Only two other post-war bowlers have a superior bowling average. Davidson was known for his anticipation in close catching positions and his accurate and strong throwing arm from the outfield. His ability to take improbable close range catches saw him earn the nickname \"The Claw\".\n\nDavidson was born at Lisarow near Gosford, New South Wales and made his first-class debut for New South Wales during the 1949–50 season while the Test players were overseas, and took 26 wickets for the summer, earning him selection in an Australian Second XI tour of New Zealand at the season's end. During a non-first-class match on tour, he took 10/29 in an innings and made 157 not out. Over the next two seasons, Davidson was unable to gain a regular position in the state team due to the presence of the Test players, but in 1952–53 he secured a position in the full-strength team and took 41 wickets at 26.75 and scored 418 runs at 34.83 to earn national selection for the 1953 tour of England. He played in all five Tests in the Ashes series, finishing the series with a modest return of 182 runs at 22.75 and eight wickets at 26.50. He also scored his maiden first-class century during the tour. His fledgling international career stagnated over the next three years. Although Davidson was selected in the squad for the next four series, he suffered several injuries and inconsistent form, playing in only 7 of 19 Tests during this time, and taking only 8 wickets. Up to this point, he had played 12 Tests, none of them Australian victories. His individual performances were also unimpressive despite his first-class success, producing only 317 runs at 18.64 and 16 wickets at 34.06.\n\nDavidson's career was then transformed after Australia's veteran fast bowling spearheads Keith Miller and Ray Lindwall retired and were dropped respectively after the tour. Davidson led an inexperienced pace attack on the tour of South Africa in 1957–58—his new ball partner Ian Meckiff was making his debut. In the First Test, he took 6/34, his maiden Test five-wicket haul, after narrowly evading being expelled for breaking a curfew. Davidson went on to take a total of 9/82 in the Fifth Test and end the career-transforming series with 25 wickets at 17.00 as Australia won 3–0. Although he scored few runs in the Tests, Davidson scored four of his nine career first-class centuries during the tour. During the 1958–59 home series against England, Davidson took 24 wickets at 19.00, including a total of 9/95 in the Second Test as Australia won 4–0. During the 1959–60 eight-Test tour of the Indian subcontinent, Davidson overcame conditions unfavourable to fast bowling to take 41 wickets at 17.78 as Australia won four matches and lost one. In the Second Test against India in Kanpur, Davidson took his career-best match and innings bowling figures with 5/31 and 7/93. In the second innings, he bowled for an entire day's play without interruption and lost 11 kg during the match. In a career total of six Tests in India, Davidson took 30 wickets at an average of 15.77.\n\nDavidson reached his all round peak during the 1960–61 home series against West Indies and was regarded as the key player in Australia's victory. In the First Test in Brisbane, Davidson became the first player to take ten wickets and accumulate more than a hundred runs in a match despite a broken finger on bowling hand. He took 5/135 and 6/87 and after scoring 44 in the first innings, made 80 in a counter-attacking seventh-wicket partnership of 134 with captain Richie Benaud as Australia sought victory in the run-chase rather than attempt to survive for a draw. Davidson was run out for 80 as Australia lost their way in the final minutes, causing the first Tied Test in history. He took five-wicket hauls in the three other Tests that he played, including Australia's victory in the Fifth Test to take the series 2–1. Despite missing a Test due to injury, he scored 212 runs at 30.28 and took 33 wickets at 18.55, almost half the average of the next best bowler. He ended the first-class season with 551 runs at 55.10 and 45 wickets at 20.62.\n\nAfter having limited success on the previous two tours of England, Davidson took 23 wickets at 24.87 in 1961 as Australia prevailed 2–1. He took 5/42 in the Second Test at Lord's and then hit a counter-attacking 77 not out in the Fourth Test after the hosts looked set to take the series lead. Davidson's innings gave Australia a defendable total and they sealed the Ashes with a late comeback and victory. During the 1961–62 Australian domestic season, Davidson scored 521 runs at 40.07 including two centuries, and took 42 wickets at 13.62, playing a leading role as his state won the Sheffield Shield for the ninth time in a row. Davidson retired from cricket after the 1962–63 series against England, having taken 24 wickets despite injuring himself despite bowling in just over four Tests. The series was drawn, the only non-victory for Australia since Davidson had become their leading bowler. During the last five years of his career, Davidson took 170 Test wickets at 19.25 in 32 Tests, only four of which were lost. After his departure, Australia struggled, winning only one Test series in four years.\n\nIn retirement, Davidson served on the boards of various organisations across fields as varying as charity, medicine, industry and sport. He was a national cricket selector for five years and was the President of the New South Wales Cricket Association from 1970 to 2003.\n\nThe son of Leslie Keith Davidson and Hilda Aileen Clifton, Davidson grew up in Lisarow, New South Wales (NSW) near the city of Gosford on the NSW Central Coast. He learnt to play cricket on a pitch that he dug out of a hill on his family's rural property. By the age of nine, he was playing in the second division of the Gosford grade competition. Throughout his high school years, he represented Northern High Schools in the state combined public schools' competition where he played against his future Test captain Richie Benaud, who captained City High Schools. During his teenage years, Davidson kept fit by working on the family property, chopping wood and carrying farm produce.\n\nDavidson originally bowled left arm unorthodox spin, but when his uncle's team was missing a fast bowler in a country match, Davidson stepped in, remaining a fast bowler permanently. In 1948–49, he moved to Sydney and joined the Northern Districts grade club. A talented rugby league player in his youth, he trained with the Western Districts Football Club in the off season to maintain his fitness.\n\nThe Australian Test team was touring South Africa in 1949–50, creating opportunities for young players back home. This was especially true with respect to fast bowling, as Keith Miller and Ray Lindwall, Australia's two leading pacemen, were from New South Wales and were in South Africa. In addition, Ernie Toshack, who had been in the Test team since World War II, had broken down.\n\nAmid this environment, Davidson was selected for New South Wales. On debut against South Australia, Davidson claimed the wicket of Bob McLean with his second ball and finished with 4/32. He then made 34 with the bat as New South Wales took a 282-run lead, but was unsuccessful in the second innings, taking 0/90 as South Australia held on for a draw.\n\nHe finished the season strongly, with 19 wickets in the last three matches against Queensland, South Australia and Victoria. This included a haul of 5/28 and 2/37 as he helped New South Wales to a win over their arch-rivals Victoria, who had defeated them earlier in the season. His debut season ended with 26 wickets at 18.73. He did not surpass his debut innings with the bat and ended with 110 runs at 15.71.\n\nThese performances earned him selection for the Australian Second XI tour of New Zealand under Bill Brown. Most of the matches were not first-class, and in one match at Wairarapa, he showed his all round skills by taking all ten wickets for 29 and then made an unbeaten 157, helping Australia to a win by an innings and 466 runs. In the only international match against New Zealand for the tour, Davidson made a duck and took 0/36 in the first innings. He then took 4/24 in the second innings, including the wickets of Bert Sutcliffe and Verdun Scott to help instigate a collapse. The hosts were 9/76, only eight runs ahead, when time ran out. He ended his maiden tour in Australian colours with nine wickets at 18.22 and 18 runs at 6.00 in three first-class matches.\n\nWith the return of the Test players for the 1950–51 season, Davidson had to perform strongly when given opportunities in order to hold his position. He started his season productively by taking 7/49 in the first innings of the opening match against Queensland, including the wickets of Test players Ken Archer, Colin McCool and Don Tallon, but he expressed disappointment at his erratic line and length, frequently bowling full tosses and long hops. New South Wales won by an innings, and Davidson took four wickets in the return match, but results began to dry up thereafter. He had the opportunity to show his skills against Test opposition as New South Wales played England ahead of the Tests, but he went wicketless, and was dropped in December after the next match against Western Australia. Davidson ended the season with 14 wickets at 22.71 and 42 runs at 10.50 from four matches.\n\nDespite another season of limited opportunities in 1951–52—he played in only four matches—Davidson continued to improve. He struggled at the outset, taking only four wickets at 41.25 in his four innings, before breaking through against a full-strength Victorian team. He broke through for his first half-century, scoring 76 before being bowled by Bill Johnston— at the time ranked the No. 1 bowler in the world. He then took 4/93 in the second innings, removing Test captain Lindsay Hassett and Australian representatives Ian Johnson and Doug Ring. He then took five wickets in a match against Queensland before bowling his state to victory over Western Australia in his final match for the summer. He took 6/13 to cut down Western Australia for 50 and took 3/36 in the second innings to seal a 250-run win. Davidson ended the season with 22 wickets at 18.00 and 137 runs at 27.40.\n\nDavidson brought himself to the verge of Test selection in 1952–53; it was the first summer during which he commanded a regular place in a full-strength New South Wales team. He took a total of 6/74 in the second match of the season against Queensland, and then impressed against the touring South African Test team. He took a total of 4/113, including batsmen Jackie McGlew and Russell Endean. Steady wicket-taking, combined with an all round performance of 66, 40 and 3/89 against Western Australia saw Davidson selected for the Australian XI, which took on South Africa in what was effectively a dress rehearsal for the Tests. He managed only nine with the bat, but took 5/108 in the only innings of the match. Nevertheless, he was overlooked for Test selection. He took 41 wickets at 26.75 and scored three half-centuries with the bat to total 418 runs at 34.83.\n\nFollowing these consistent performances, Davidson was selected for the 1953 Ashes tour. He improved on his career best in consecutive matches against Tasmania before the Australians sailed to England, scoring 87 and 90. The second effort featured a 167-run partnership with Richie Benaud. It was to be the first of many joint efforts by the pair of bowling all rounders for Australia over the next ten years. Davidson then took 3/45 with the ball, including the wickets of Miller and leading Australian batsman Neil Harvey.\n\nAfter being omitted in the opening tour match against Worcestershire, Davidson made his debut on English soil against Leicestershire. He scored 63, featuring in a century partnership with Harvey, before taking 2/23 and 0/35 in an innings victory. In the next match against Yorkshire, he removed Len Hutton, regarded as the best batsman in the world at the time. In the nine first-class matches leading up to the Tests, Davidson performed steadily without being spectacular. He scored two fifties and passed 20 in every completed innings to aggregate 317 runs at 45.28, and took 17 wickets at 22.12, taking more than two wickets in an innings on only one occasion. That occasion was against the Marylebone Cricket Club, which was a virtual England Test team, while Australia fielded their strongest possible team. In what was effectively a dress rehearsal for the Tests, Davidson took 2/17 and 3/49, removing Trevor Bailey, Godfrey Evans, Johnny Wardle, Tom Graveney and leading batsman Denis Compton.\n\nWhen the Tests started at Trent Bridge, Davidson was named in the playing XI. He supported the pace attack of Miller, Lindwall and Johnston in the five Tests. His debut in the First Test was unremarkable. As with most of Australia's batsmen, Davidson struggled against Alec Bedser, who broke the English Test wicket-taking record in the wet conditions, making only four and six. He took 2/22 in the first innings as the match ended in a rain affected draw. His first Test wicket was that of Hutton, caught by Benaud, and he added Evans in the latter part of the innings.\n\nHe scored a hard hitting 76 in the first innings of the Second Test at Lord's to help Australia take control, but a stubborn partnership by Bailey and Willie Watson saw England hang on for a draw. Davidson bowled only 24.5 overs for the match, and Wardle was his only wicket. Rainy weather greeted the players in the Third Test at Old Trafford and more than half the playing time was washed out. Davidson took 2/60 in the drawn match, removing Reg Simpson and Willie Watson. Australia were in a good position at the start of the final day of the Fourth Test at Headingley, with England leading by only 78 runs with five wickets in hand. However, Bailey (38) and Jim Laker (48) stubbornly resisted with a mixture of time-wasting and dour defence. Davidson eventually removed both, but there was not enough time remaining to secure an Australian victory. His match figures of 3/59 from 50.1 overs were in large part due to the defensive tactics of England. The fate of The Ashes thus came down to the Fifth Test at The Oval. Davidson scored 22 and 21 and could not take a wicket as England won by eight wickets to regain the urn for the first time in two decades. Australia had blundered by omitting a specialist spinner, mistakenly thinking that the pitch would not spin. Davidson hit England's spinners out of the attack for a period, but succumbed to the variable bounce of the pitch.\n\nDavidson passed 25 in the Tests only once took two wickets on three occasions. He finished the series with 182 runs at 22.75 and his sparingly used bowling yielded eight wickets at 26.50. Despite this, he was Australia's sixth-highest run-scorer and third-leading wicket-taker.\n\nDespite his lack of performance in the Tests, Davidson showed his potential with consistent performance throughout the tour. He compiled 944 runs at 41.04 during the tour and amassed five half centuries and a century. He scored three fifties in the last month of the tour, and after missing his maiden first-class century with 95 against Lancashire, he broke through with 104* against Somerset at County Ground, Taunton. He also took 50 wickets at 20.96 with the ball. Davidson was steady with the ball, never taking more than three wickets in an innings. He ranked seventh among the Australians in both run-scoring and wicket-taking.\n\nDuring the tour, tensions sometimes arose between the senior players, who were war veterans and drinkers, while the younger players including Davidson tended to abstain from alcohol. Teammate Ian Craig estimated that bus journeys to matches proceeded at an average speed of 16 km/h because of persistent stoppages outside pubs, something that frustrated the non-drinkers. In the end, the young players had to the majority of the fielding as their older colleagues were often still intoxicated during matches.\n\nThe 1953–54 season was purely domestic, with no Tests scheduled. Davidson had a modest injury-hit season, scoring 76 runs at 19.00 and taking nine wickets at 32.71 in four matches. His best was a 4/50 against Queensland, and 3/89 in a testimonial match for retiring Australian captain Lindsay Hassett; he removed Test teammates Benaud, Ron Archer and Graeme Hole.\n\nIn 1954–55 England toured Australia for five Ashes Tests. Davidson started his season well, scoring 30 and 27 not out and taking a total of 5/104 as New South Wales drew with England. His victims included leading batsmen Colin Cowdrey and Bill Edrich. However, Davidson succumbed to injury and missed Australia's only win of the series in the First Test, and upon his return in the Second Test, managed match figures of 2/86 and did not pass twenty in either innings as England levelled the series. He was dropped for the Third Test, but continued to perform strongly in domestic matches, including a sequence of 19 wickets in three matches. This included 4/45 including the wickets of Compton, Bailey and Graveney in a tour match against England, and a match-winning performance against arch-rivals Victoria that sealed a second successive Shield triumph with a resounding nine-wicket win in two days. He tore through the Victorians with 5/36 and 4/50, removing Harvey and Test all rounder Sam Loxton twice. It was his best match bowling figures in his career to date.\n\nDavidson was recalled for the Fourth Test, but managed only a wicket as England sealed the series 4–1. However, he then took a total of 6/68 as New South Wales defeated England; it was only the second time the tourists had lost for the summer. Davidson was retained for the final Test, his first on his home ground in Sydney, but was wicketless in a rain-affected draw. His Test series had been poor, with 71 runs at 14.20 and only three wickets at 73.33 as England retained the Ashes 3–1. Davidson had not tasted victory in any of his eight Tests. His poor Test form contrasted to his performances against England in tour matches; he took 15 wicket at 15.13 in three matches outside the Tests.\n\nHis overall bowling performance was strong, with 34 wickets at 23.18, although his batting was ineffective, with only 213 runs at 15.21 and a top-score of 30.\n\nDavidson was selected for the 1954–55 tour of the West Indies, where he injured his right ankle in a tour match against Jamaica and missed the First Test against the West Indies. Upon his recovery, he could not break into the XI and did not play in any of the Tests, which Australia won 3–0. He scored 70 runs at 35.00 and took four wickets at 51.75 in three first-class outings.\n\nAfter his injury-hit Caribbean sojourn, Davidson had the 1955–56 season, which was purely domestic, to force his way back into the national team for the 1956 tour of England. Johnston had also retired, leaving an extra vacancy for a pace bowler.\n\nHe started strongly with match figures of 7/87 in a drawn match against Queensland in Brisbane. The hosts managed to hang on with three wickets in hand, after Davidson's captain had held up play and wasted 20 minutes for the running of the Melbourne Cup. He performed steadily for the next six matches, not taking more than two wickets in any innings, before playing a prominent role in the final match of the Sheffield Shield season against Victoria. It was then 100th anniversary of matches between the old rivals. Davidson took 6/99 in the first innings, including Harvey for 128, before adding 2/61 in the second. It helped prevent a defeat on the anniversary and sealed New South Wales' hat-trick of Shield titles.\n\nDavidson was selected for the England tour and then took 12 wickets and scored his only half-century of the season as the Australians warmed up before sailing abroad. He ended the Australian season with 350 runs at 31.81 and 36 wickets at 25.19.\n\nDavidson had an interrupted lead-in to the Tests. He injured himself while batting in his sixth match, against the MCC, and was unable to take any further part in the match. He was out of action for two weeks but recovered in time for the First Test at Trent Bridge. He had scored 46 runs at 11.50 and took 13 wickets at 20.92during his preparation.\n\nIn the First Test of the series at Nottingham, Davidson removed Cowdrey before his ankle slipped in a footmark during the first innings and a bone was chipped. He was carried off with figures of 1/22 and his ankle plastered. The injury was such that he was unable to bat even with the assistance of a runner and was absent. This injury sidelined him until August.\n\nBy the time of Davidson's return, England had retained the Ashes 2–1 after annihilating Australia by an innings in consecutive Tests. Prior to this, Australia had not lost by an innings since 1938, let alone twice in a row. The Surrey finger spin pairing of Jim Laker and Tony Lock had led the decimation, taking 38 of the 40 wickets of dry dusty wickets doctored for their use. In Australia's match against Surrey before the Tests, the pair had taken 19 wickets as the tourists lost to a county side for the first time since 1912.\n\nAs a result of the finger spinners' success, Australian captain Ian Johnson tried to convert Davidson into a left arm orthodox spinner. Davidson returned as Australia faced a fourth meeting with Laker and Lock, in a match against Surrey immediately after the two consecutive Test maulings. On a sticky wicket that played into the hands of the Surrey spinners, Australia were skittled for 143. Only Davidson, who took the attack to the pair, made 44 not out. One six that he lofted from Laker almost reached the iconic gasometer outside The Oval. The match was drawn, and Davidson took 2/50 including Eric Bedser and Laker in his new role as a slow bowler.\n\nDavidson was able to force his way back into the team for the Fifth Test at The Oval. He scored eight and took a total of 1/34 in another rain-marred draw. Johnson persisted in using Davidson as a spinner, but it was not effective. In eight matches, the ploy yielded only 12 wickets at 24.25. Johnson was criticised for this novel strategy; cricket writer Ray Robinson said \"I have not met one good cricketer or cricket judge who is not mystified by them [Johnson's tactics]\". Davidson felt that Johnson tried to rely too heavily on the senior players and should have placed more responsibility on the likes of Richie Benaud, Ron Archer and himself. Overall Davidson scored 270 runs at 27.00 with two fifties and took 26 wickets at 22.50 in England.\n\nOn the return leg to Australia, the team stopped on the Indian subcontinent. Davidson's 37 in the inaugural one off Test against Pakistan was his first score beyond 25 in nine Tests. He was bowled sparingly with a total of 2/15 from 15 overs as Australia lost by nine wickets. A muscle problem stopped Davidson from playing against India in the First Test in Madras, which Australia won by an innings. He played only in the Second Test, with pacemen Miller and Ron Archer injured and unavailable. It got worse for Australia as Davidson and fellow paceman Pat Crawford were hampered by stomach bugs and a hip strains respectively. Davidson scored 16 and took match figures of 1/42; Australia were unable to finish off the Indians with their depleted attack and the match ended in a draw. Davidson was left out of the Third Test win, so his overseas tour had ended without a Test victory, and only 64 runs at 16.00 and his underused bowling yielded five wickets at 22.60. In total, he had played twelve Tests, none of them resulting in an Australian victory. His individual performances were also unimpressive despite being successful at first-class level, producing only 317 runs at 18.64 and 16 wickets at 34.06. It was to be another year before Davidson tasted victory at the highest level.\n\nWith captain Johnson and vice captain Miller, the main spinner and one of the two leading fast bowlers retiring upon their return from the subcontinent, Australia moved into uncharted territory and needed younger bowlers to step up following three successive series losses to England. The 1956–57 Australian season was purely domestic and a chance for the players to stake their claims to be part of Australia's future. Davidson scored 374 runs at 34.00 including three fifties and took 30 wicket at 27.50 from eight matches. His most effective effort was a 5/65 in the second innings of the match between Harvey's XI and Lindwall's XI. Davidson's effort helped set up a seven-wicket triumph for Harvey's men.\n\nOver the winter, with Test vacancies beckoning, Davidson and Benaud became training partners and decided to bowl for three hours continuously on a daily basis through the winter off season. With Ray Lindwall dropped, Davidson and Benaud became Australia's leading paceman and spinner when the team for the 1957–58 tour of South Africa was announced. It was a heavy burden on Davidson, who had only taken two Test wickets in an innings four times, and three wickets in a Test match on one occasion. The team was to be led by Ian Craig, who had played only six Tests, and at the age of just 22 years, he was the youngest ever Test captain from any country.\n\nDavidson started the tour well, when Australia arrived in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) to play two tour matches against the Rhodesia. He made an unbeaten 100 and took a total of 3/67 in the first match in Salisbury, before scoring 19 and taking 5/36 and 2/22 in the second in Bulawayo. Australia won both by an innings.\n\nThe Australians crossed the border into South Africa and Davidson scored 100 and took a total of 4/62 against Transvaal as Craig's men started with a nine-wicket win. The next match was against a South African XI, and was effectively a dress rehearsal for the Tests. Davidson scored 34 and took a total of 7/103 as the Australians crushed the hosts by an innings. He rounded off his Test preparation with match figures of 6/35 against Border and a 76 against Western Province.\n\nDespite the highly productive lead-up, Davidson faltered in his first outing as Australia's Test spearhead. He conceded 1/115 in only 32 overs in the first innings as South Africa reached 9/470 in the First Test in Johannesburg. With Australia 102 behind on the first innings, Davidson's tour nearly ended. Unable to cope with the 10 pm curfew imposed by team manager Jack Norton, Davidson and roommate Les Favell absconded and went sightseeing. By the time they had returned, Norton had confiscated their keys and left them a note asking them to report. The pair then went to sleep at the home of some supporters who had hosted the team for dinner the previous day.\n\nThe next day, Davidson faced dismissal from the team, but he overcame the turmoil to take 6/34, his first five wicket haul. This included a seven-over spell before lunch that yielded three wickets and reduced South Africa to 4/19, before the match ended in a draw. Davidson, Favell and their hosts all told Norton that the pair of cricketers had stayed the entire night at the home. The duo were not sent home the curfew was repealed.\n\nThe Second Test in Cape Town saw an Australian victory, the first in Davidson's 14 Tests. He took 2/31 and 2/18 as South Africa lost by an innings after being forced to follow on. It was during this match that Davidson earned his famous reputation for injury complaints, something that became a constant source of humour; he spent so much time on the massage table that his teammates attached a plaque that read \"The AK Davidson Autograph Treatment Table\". Benaud reported that Davidson persistently complained to captain Craig about an injury before delivering the next ball with high pace and swing.\n\nHe then scored 123 against Natal before the Third Test in Durban, where he took 2/62 in a drawn match. In the Fourth Test in Johannesburg, Davidson made 62, his first Test half century in over four years, and took a total of 3/83 in a ten-wicket victory. He then took match figures of 7/55 against Griqualand West and recorded his best first-class score of 129 in a match against Western Province in Cape Town. He then took 5/38 to help seal another innings win.\n\nIn the Fifth Test at Port Elizabeth, Davidson took 4/44 and then 5/38 in the second innings as he and Benaud took all ten wickets and South Africa were skittled for 144. Australia won by eight wickets and took the series 3–0. It was his best Test match haul to date. He scored 127 runs at 21.17 and took 25 wickets at 17.0 in the Tests. He had success against Russell Endean and John Waite, dismissing both twice. Although he was unable to score heavily in the Tests, Davidson scored four of his nine first class centuries during the tour. In all, he had taken 72 wickets at 15.13 and scored 813 runs at 54.20 for the entire tour. From this tour onwards, in 32 Tests, he was to take 170 wickets at 19.26 and score 1011 runs at 27.32 in the remainder of his career.\n\nThe 1958–59 English tour of Australia saw Davidson lead the attack for the first time in Australia. It was Australia's first series on home soil since the last English visit four years earlier and came on the back of three successive Ashes series losses. Davidson started well with match figures of 5/66 as Australia took the First Test in Brisbane by eight wickets. In the Second Test in Melbourne, Davidson took 6/64 in the first innings to help bowl out the tourists for 259 and put Australia in control. This included an opening spell in which he removed the three top order English batsmen Peter Richardson, Watson and Tom Graveney without conceding a run. He had Richardson caught behind from the first ball of his second over, before yorking Watson with the fourth ball for duck and trapping Graveney leg before wicket from the next delivery with an inswinger. This brought England captain Peter May to the crease, but Davidson'a hat-trick ball was off target and no shot was offered. He later returned to remove Colin Cowdrey, Brian Statham and Peter Loader.\n\nIn the second innings, he bowled unchanged with Ian Meckiff, taking 3/41, and taking two reflex catches in the leg trap from Meckiff, as England were cut down for 87 and Australia took an eight-wicket win and a 2–0 lead. Davidson's least penetrative match was the Third Test in Sydney, taking a match total of 2/84. It coincided with Australia's only non-victory of the series. Davidson scored 71 as the match ended in a draw. He took three and five wickets in the final two Tests, both of which Australia won. Davidson ended the series with 24 wickets at 19.00. With the bat, Davidson had his most productive Test series yet, scoring 180 runs at 36.00. Australia had defeated Peter May's team, who were heavily favoured, with ease. According to cricket writer Gideon Haigh, \"Davidson had the ball on a string\".\n\nDavidson added a century in a state match against South Australia and for the entire first-class season, he totalled 431 runs at 33.15 and 47 wickets at 18.04.\n\nThe 1959–60 season saw Davidson confronted with an arduous eight Test tour of the Indian subcontinent, with three and five Tests against Pakistan and India respectively. Flat and dry pitches unconducive to fast bowling combined with oppressive heat confronted the players. On the last tour, many of the Australians had fallen ill with food positioning, and Davidson had asked Donald Bradman, the Australian Chairman of Selectors if opting out of the tour was permitted. Bradman turned him down. Davidson was consistent throughout the Pakistan series, taking four wickets in each of the three Tests, to end with 12 wickets at 24.83. He also batted solidly, with 47 and 39* in the latter two Tests to end with 90 runs at 45.00. His contributions helped Australia to a 2–0 series result; it was the first time Pakistan had lost a Test on home soil and the pair of victories were its last in Pakistan for 39 years. He had particular success against Imtiaz Ahmed, removing him four times.\n\nIn the First Test against India in Delhi, Davidson took 3/22 in the first innings, removing both openers Pankaj Roy and Nari Contractor, and captain Polly Umrigar to help Australia seize the initiative and bowl out the hosts for 135. He then contributed four catches in the second as Australia took a 1–0 series lead with an innings victory.\n\nThe Second Test in Kanpur saw Davidson return his career best innings and match bowling figures. On a dry pitch and in searing temperatures unfavourable for fast bowling, he took 5/31 in the first innings as India were all out for 152. He then scored 41 as Australia replied with 219. In heat above 38 degrees Celsius, he bowled unchanged for the entire day to take 7/93 from 57.3 overs in the second innings. During the match, Davidson lost around 11 kg in weight. According to the Australians, it was the \"harshest cricket environment\" that they had encountered. Davidson said that he felt like a \"bloody zombie\".\n\nAustralia were left a target of 225 for victory. Davidson fell for eight as part of a Jasu Patel-inspired collapse. Patel took 14/124 and Australia were out for 105. This resulted in Australia's first loss in the fifteen Tests since Davidson began leading the attack, and their first at the hands of their hosts.\n\nDavidson took 4/62 in the first innings of the Third Test in Delhi as Australia took a 98-run first innings lead, but he was unable to add to his tally in the second innings as the hosts' batsmen held on for a draw. He then took taking match figures of 5/69 and 5/113 in the last two matches as Australia managed to win the Fourth Test to take a hard-fought 2–1 series victory. Davidson had led the way with 29 wickets at 14.86 in a country regarded as a graveyard for fast bowling—in this era, the home team's attack was dominated by spinners. In six Tests in India, Davidson had taken 30 wickets at an average of 15.77.\n\nDavidson was at his all round peak during the 1960–61 series against West Indies. After taking eight wickets in the two opening matches of the season against Queensland, Davidson gave an indication of what was in store in the Tests when New South Wales played Frank Worrell's tourists. He struck 88 as the hosts amassed 6/429 declared and then took three top-order wickets, removing Cammie Smith, Rohan Kanhai and Gary Sobers, holder of the Test world record of 365. He ended with 4/26 as the West Indies fell for 111 and lost by an innings. He then completed his Test preparation with 122 not out against Victoria.\n\nIn the First Test against the West Indies cricket team in Brisbane, Davidson showed his all round skills as well as stamina in becoming the first player to take ten wickets and accumulate more than a hundred runs in a match. On the eve of the match, Davidson broke the little finger on his bowling hand during catching practice and was unable to move it. However, he decided to play after Bradman gave a motivational speech to the team ahead of the match.\n\nOn the first two days, he bowled thirty (eight ball) overs to take 5/135 in the first innings as the West Indies reached 453. He did much of the heavy lifting in removing four of the West Indies' batsmen, Conrad Hunte, Smith, Kanhai and Worrell. Australia took a small lead of 52 after reaching 505, with Davidson contributing 44. In the second innings, Davidson was left with a heavier workload after his new ball partner Meckiff broke down after four overs. He took 6/87 from 24.6 overs as the West Indies were restricted to 284. he was again responsible for cutting down the leading batsmen, removing Smith, Kanhai, Sobers and Worrell. This left Australia 233 runs to win with 312 minutes available on the last day. Former Australian Test batsman and journalist Jack Fingleton commented that \"One sensed that the West Indies realised they were facing defeat\". However, the tourists had other ideas.\n\nAlthough time was plentiful, the pitch had begun to deteriorate and Australia look defeated after they had fallen to 5/57, prompting Davidson to join local batsman Ken Mackay at the crease. They took the score to 92 when Mackay fell and Australia's chances of winning looked remote as Davidson and Benaud reached tea at 6/109 with 124 runs still required with only the tailenders were to follow. Despite this, Benaud told chairman of selectors Don Bradman that he would still be going for an improbable victory in accordance with his policy of aggressive strategy. With an attacking partnership, the pair took Australia to within sight of the target. The pair added 50 runs in 55 minutes. Davidson hooked leading paceman Wes Hall repeatedly and Benaud attacked the spinners when Worrell took Hall off. Both men were noted for their hitting ability and viewed attack as their most effective chance of survival. Davidson hit four fours from the leg spin of Sonny Ramadhin, and the deficit dwindled to 60 with one hour remaining and 27 with 30 minutes to go. The pair took 17 runs from the next two overs, and regular boundaries and quickly run singles took Australia into what looked like a victorious position. They took the score to 226 with a seventh wicket partnership of 134. Only seven runs were required with four wickets in hand as time was running short. Benaud hit a ball into the covers and the pair attempted a quick single, but a direct hit from Joe Solomon saw Davidson run out for his highest Test score of 80. Davidson reflected \"I was as dirty as anyone ever has been\". Australia needed six runs from the final over with three wickets in hand but Benaud was caught and the last two players fell to run outs while attempting the winning run. The match was tie in Test cricket, and Davidson had achieved his unprecedented feat despite carrying a broken finger into the match. Bradman joked that he should break his finger before every match.\n\nAfter this marathon effort, Davidson scored 81 as New South Wales defeated the tourists by an innings for the second time in the space of the month. He was only asked to bowl five overs after his efforts in Brisbane.\n\nDavidson returned to a full workload as he helped Australia take a 1–0 series lead in the Second Test in Melbourne. He scored 35 in the first innings of 348, before taking 6/53 in the West Indies' reply of 181. He removed Joe Solomon, before removing the established batsmen Seymour Nurse and Kanhai to trigger a collapse. This allowed Benaud to enforce the follow on. Davidson took a further 2/51 in the second innings to set up a seven wicket victory. The teams moved to Sydney for the next Test, where Davidson's unhappy experiences on his home ground continued. The West Indies batted first and made 339; Davidson took 5/80, including Smith, Kanhai and Sobers. Davidson made 16 as Australia replied with 202 and were in trouble when Meckiff was forced off the field early in the tourists' second innings with injury. Davidson lifted and removed Hunte, Kanhai and Sobers for single figures with the new ball. However, he too was forced off with a hamstring tear. With Australia two men down, the West Indies recovered to 326 and set the hosts 464 for victory, which would have required a world record fourth innings score. Davidson managed only one as Australia lost by 222 runs. He had not had a Test win in Sydney in three attempts, the only Australian ground where he had not played in a victory. After missing the Fourth Test because of a month on the sidelines to recuperate from the hamstring tear, he returned for the Fifth Test with the series level at 1–1. He took match figures of 6/173, including five wickets with late swing in the second innings to help Australia secure the victory. Davidson scored 28 and 12 as Benaud's men stumbled in the run-chase before scraping home by two wickets.\n\nIn three and a half Tests, he accumulated 212 runs at 30.28 and totalled 33 wickets against the Caribbean visitors at a cost of 18.55, when the next best average of any bowler was 33. Davidson was regarded as the main factor in Australia's 2–1 series win. He ended the first-class season with 551 runs at 55.10 and 45 wickets at 20.62. These efforts led him to retain the number 1 ranking in ICC Test Bowlers ranking for 1961 (which he obtained in the previous year).\n\nThe 1961 tour of England was Davidson's overseas farewell, and he had not been prolific on his two previous visits, never managing to take more than four wickets in an innings and totaling only 76 in 40 first-class matches.\n\nHe broke through for his first five-wicket haul on English soil in his fifth match against Glamorgan, taking 5/63 in the first innings and scoring an unbeaten 68. He added 90 in the next match against Gloucestershire before facing the MCC at Lord's in the traditional dress rehearsal for the Tests. He took 6/46 and 3/58 as Australia took victory. His wickets included leading Test batsmen Cowdrey and Ken Barrington. Davidson headed into the Tests with 257 runs at 42.83 and 26 wickets at 22.35 from eight matches.\n\nDespite this form, his Test campaign started poorly with an ineffective 1/130 in the drawn First Test at Edgbaston. He then broke down with a back injury in a match against Kent and looked unlikely to play. With Benaud already sidelined with a shoulder injury, Australia looked severely weakened without their two main bowlers. Despite again complaining about frailties of his body, Davidson vowed to play and produce a special performance for friend and stand-in captain Neil Harvey in the Second Test at Lord's.\n\nDavidson took copious amounts of capsulin, and he took his position in what was known as the \"Battle of the Ridge\" due to the presence of a ridge on the surface that yielded erratic bounce. He exploited this in the first innings, beating Raman Subba Row three times in the first over and striking Geoff Pullar in the shoulder. He then bowled Pullar and struck Ted Dexter twice in the chest. Dexter then hit a ball to short leg but was dropped. Davidson then removed Peter May and Barrington before ending with 5/42 as Australia dismissed the hosts for 206 to seize the initiative. Davidson credited the performance to the capsulin, which flowed into his lower body and in his own words, put his \"backside on fire\".\n\nAustralia took a first innings lead of 134 and Davidson removed Subba Row and Barrington with the new ball in the second innings to end with 2/50 and help set up a five wicket victory. Davidson was at the crease when the winning runs were scored, albeit at the non-striker's end. It was the first time Davidson had tasted Test victory on English soil in three tours.\n\nHe then took 5/63 in the first innings of the Third Test at Headingley, removing Subba Row, May, Barrington and Ted Dexter at the top of the order, but Australia struggled with the bat and England lost only two wickets in reaching 62 in the second innings to level the series. Davidson took one of those wickets, removing Subba Row.\n\nDavidson played a large role in the Fourth Test Old Trafford. Victory would give Australia an unassailable 2–1 series lead and retention of the Ashes. A loss would mean that Australia would need to win the Fifth and final Test to prevent England from reclaiming them.\n\nAustralia started poorly, and Davidson made a duck as the tourists were dismissed for 190. Davidson then took 3/67, removing Pullar, May and Subba Row as England took a sizeable 177-run lead.\n\nThis appeared to be a match-winning lead after Australia had lost three wickets in quick succession to David Allen, leaving them at 9/334 with only a 157 run lead. Last man Graham McKenzie came to the crease to join Davidson, who had been in poor form with the bat, having failed to pass 22 in the past five matches in six weeks. Davidson said that \"I was shaking like I had Parkinson's\".\n\nMay brought on the part-time spin of Brian Close and 15 runs came in two overs, helping Davidson to feel more at ease. At the time, Allen had bowled 25 maidens in 37 overs. Davidson responded to the situation by hitting Allen out of the attack. In Allen's 10th over for the day, Davidson took 20 runs. He lofted an off drive over the boundary for six, and drove through the covers for four from both the front and back foot. Davidson then hit the bowler out of the stadium onto the adjacent railway lines. Fred Trueman came on and struck Davidson on the foot with a yorker. Davidson responded with a three and a cut for four that brought up Australia's 400. He ended with a hard-hitting 77 not out, after a final wicket partnership of 98 in 102 minutes. This extended Australia's lead to 256 on the last day and gave them hope of stopping England from winning the match. England looked to be heading towards victory with seven wickets in hand and less than 100 runs required, but a Benaud-inspired collapse saw Australia home by 54 runs. Davidson knocked Brian Statham's off stump out of the ground to end the match and ended with 2/50. It was Australia's first victory at Old Trafford since 1902 and sealed the series.\n\nHe ended his final Test series on foreign soil with combined figures of 4/150 in the Fifth Test at The Oval, which was drawn. Davidson finished the series with 23 wickets at 24.87 and 151 runs at 30.20. He was again Australia's leading bowler on tour.\n\nDavidson bade farewell to the English first-class scene with a match-winning display with both bat and ball against AER Gilligan's XI. He took 3/45 and scored 65 and 60, helping Australia to scrape home by three wickets.\n\nDavidson was in strong all round form in the 1961–62 Australian season, which was a purely domestic one. Against Victoria in Sydney, he scored 106 in a hard hitting innings with the tail. He made 58 of the 59 runs added in a last wicket partnership with Doug Ford, the other being a leg bye. The partnership lasted only 44 balls and Davidson managed to farm the strike and face 41 of these. The effort helped to set up a ten-wicket win. The following week against Western Australia in Perth, he made 108 after New South Wales had slumped to 6/38 to help the visitors recover to 218. New South Wales struggled in their second innings and Western Australia needed only 175 for victory. However, Davidson took his career best innings bowling figures of 7/31 to bowl out the hosts for 106 and seize a victory. In both matches against Queensland, Davidson took four quick wickets in the second innings to secure narrow victories after bold declarations. New South Wales won the Shield in that season with 64 of a maximum possible 80 points, playing aggressive cricket under Benaud. It was their ninth title in a row. Davidson was a key factor in the dominance, scoring 521 runs at 40.07 and taking 42 wickets at 13.62.\n\nAt the start of the season, Davidson announced that the 1962–63 Ashes series against England was to be his last in the international arena, citing family and business reasons for his retirement. He started the season with half-centuries in the three consecutive innings ahead of the Tests. The third of these was in a state match that resulted in an innings victory over England.\n\nHowever, he started the Tests slowly, failing to take a wicket in the first innings of the First Test at Brisbane before securing 3/43 in the second as the match was drawn. He removed Barrington, Pullar and David Sheppard. However he returned to form with 96 and 4/80 against South Australia, and then added a milestone to his first-class career with a hat-trick against Western Australia in Perth. Having taken a wicket with the first ball of the innings, Davidson proceeded to bowl both Barry Shepherd and John Parker before Russell Waugh was caught by Norm O'Neill in the first innings. He ended with 5/40 and took 2/32 in the second innings as the visitors completed an innings victory.\n\nIn the Second Test at Melbourne, Davidson made 40 in Australia's first innings of 316. and then captured 6/75 to restrict England's lead to 15. Australia then 248 with Davidson contributing 17, but he went wicketless in the second innings as England successfully reached their target with seven wickets in hand to take a 1–0 series lead. Australia's victory in the Third Test at Sydney, was Davidson's first Test victory on his home ground, and he made a major contribution with bowling figures of 4/54 and 5/25; the latter effort included the wickets of Pullar, Sheppard and Dexter to precipitate a collapse that saw England all out for 104. This left Australia with a victory target of only 65, which was reached just before the beginning of a heavy thunderstorm that would have caused the remainder of the match to be abandoned, thus saving England from defeat.\n\nDavidson struck 46 runs in the first innings of the Fourth Test in Adelaide, then tore his hamstring muscle after bowling only 3.4 overs. Australia, with a bowler short, was unable to force a win without him. The Fifth Test was on his home ground at Sydney with the series locked 1–1. He captured 3/43 and 3/80, taking a wicket with his final ball in Test cricket when Alan Smith was caught at slip by Bob Simpson. This left Australia with a target of 241 in 60 overs, but there was to be no fairytale finish as the match ended in a draw.\n\nThe Ashes series was the only one of seven series that Australia failed to win since Davidson became the team's frontline strike bowler in 1957–58. Of the 33 Tests in this period, Australia won 16, lost four, drew 12 and tied one. Davidson missed one of the drawn games through injury and broke down mid-match in another two. In the five years that he and Benaud led Australia's bowling attack, the pair totalled 333 wickets; Davidson 170 at 19.25 and Benaud 163 at 25, and were a major part in Australia's return to the forefront of world cricket. This came after the first four years of Davidson's career saw Australia win none and lose seven matches out of twelve. Often bowling in tandem, Davidson's accuracy also forced opposition batsmen to attack Benaud, leading them to perish from the pressure to raise the run rate. In the four years after Davidson retired, Australia struggled without his wicket-taking ability. Only one of the six series was won and two were lost; in all Australia managed six wins and eight losses in 30 Tests. Davidson was at his best when Australia was on her knees; In the four Test losses during the last five years of his career, he took 32 wickets at an average of just 13.9 including a ten wicket haul. In the Tied Test, he took eleven wickets, the other ten wicket haul in his Test career.\n\nIn Sydney Grade Cricket, he scored 4,302 runs at 37.08 and took 348 wickets at 13.69. He later served as a selector for the Australian team from 1979 to 1984, and after serving as a vice president for three years, in 1970 became president of the New South Wales Cricket Association. At the age of 41, he was the youngest person to have held the post. Davidson held the post until 2003. Davidson was one of the trustees of the SCG from 1978 to 1998, during which time floodlights were installed at the ground.\n\nDavidson has held positions on the board of directors of a variety of organisations, sporting, medical, philanthropic and corporate. He is the chairman of Freshfood Australia Holdings, and was the president of Surf Life Saving Australia from 1984 to 2002. He served as a member of the New South Wales Sport Advisory Council from 1988 to 2008, and the national equivalent from 1977 to 1981, and served as a director of the ANZAC Health and Research Foundation from 1994 to 2003. He has held positions with the Australian Red Cross and Legacy Australia in the past. Davidson also worked as a teller for the Commonwealth Bank from 1947 to 1974.\n\nDavidson also served as the chairman of the Rothmans National Sports Foundation for six years. He served on the New South Wales Olympic Council from 1980 to 1996. He published his autobiography \"Fifteen Paces\" in 1963, a reference to the length of his bowling run.\n\nA suburban cricket and Australian rules football ground in Alexandria, in Sydney's inner-west, is named after Davidson. There is also a suburban cricket and soccer oval in Wyoming, New South Wales, on the Central Coast that is named after Davidson, as well as a cricket and rugby field located in Homebush.\n\nIn 2013 Davidson appeared in a television commercial for his former employer, the Commonwealth Bank. Davidson appears as an aged dog walker watching a young boy practice his bowling.\n\nDavidson married Betty Patricia McKinley in 1952. Their sons were born in 1953 and 1955 while he was on tour in England and the West Indies respectively. He was named as the New South Wales Father of the Year in 1982.\n\nDavidson was named as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1962. He was made a Member of the order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1964 and a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) in 1987. He was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1988, the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 2004, and the ICC Hall of Fame in 2011. He received an Australian Sports Medal in 2000.

Due to multilingualism among Lebanese people (a majority of the Lebanese people are bilingual or trilingual), it is not uncommon for Lebanese people to mix Lebanese Arabic, English and French into their daily speech.\n\nLebanese Arabic is believed to be a descendant of the Arabic dialects introduced to the Levant in the 7th century CE, which gradually supplanted various indigenous Northwest Semitic languages to become the regional lingua franca. As a result of this prolonged process of language shift, Lebanese Arabic possesses a significant Aramaic substratum, along with later non-Semitic adstrate influences from Ottoman Turkish, English, and French. As a variety of Levantine Arabic, Lebanese Arabic is most closely related to Syrian Arabic and shares many innovations with Palestinian and Jordanian Arabic. However some modern researchers have opposed the idea of descendance from Peninsular Arabic dialects, such as Ahmad Al-Jallad and others. These hold that the vernaculars languages went through a parallel evolution.\n\nLebanese Arabic shares many features with other modern varieties of Arabic. Lebanese Arabic, like many other spoken Levantine Arabic varieties, has a syllable structure very different from that of Modern Standard Arabic. While Standard Arabic can have only one consonant at the beginning of a syllable, after which a vowel must follow, Lebanese Arabic commonly has two consonants in the onset.\n\n\nSeveral non-linguist commentators, including Nassim Taleb, have claimed that the Lebanese vernacular is not in fact a variety of Arabic at all, but rather a separate Central Semitic language descended from older languages including Aramaic; those who espouse this viewpoint suggest that a large percentage of its vocabulary consists of Arabic loanwords, and that this compounds with the use of the Arabic alphabet to disguise the language's true nature. Taleb has recommended that the language be called Northwestern Levantine or neo-Canaanite. Linguists reject this classification on the basis that it is easily disproved by the comparative method and other tools known to historical linguistics, and that attempts to claim another ancestor for Lebanese are motivated more by nationalist politics than by a desire for linguistic impartiality.. \n\nFurthermore, historian and linguist Ahmad Al-Jallad has recently shown that while modern dialects are not descendants of Classical Arabic, forms of Arabic older than Classical are the historical foundation for the various dialects. Thus, \"most of the familiar modern dialects (i.e. Rabat, Cairo, Damascus, etc.) are sedimentary structures, containing layers of Arabics that must be teased out on a case-by-case basis.\" In essence, the linguistic consensus is that Lebanese too is a variety of Arabic.\n\n\nThis table shows the correspondence between general Lebanese Arabic vowel phonemes and their counterpart realizations in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and other Levantine Arabic varieties.\n\nAlthough there is a modern Lebanese Arabic dialect mutually understood by Lebanese people, there are regionally distinct variations with, at times, unique pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary.\n\nWidely used regional varieties include:\n\nLebanese Arabic is rarely written, except in novels where a dialect is implied or in some types of poetry that do not use classical Arabic at all. Lebanese Arabic is also utilized in many Lebanese songs, theatrical pieces, local television and radio productions, and very prominently in zajal.\n\nFormal publications in Lebanon, such as newspapers, are typically written in Modern Standard Arabic, French, or English.\n\nWhile Arabic script is usually employed, informal usage such as online chat may mix and match Latin letter transliterations. The Lebanese poet Saïd Akl proposed the use of the Latin alphabet but did not gain wide acceptance. Whereas some works, such as \"Romeo and Juliet\" and \"Plato's Dialogues\" have been transliterated using such systems, they have not gained widespread acceptance. Yet, now, most Arabic web users, when short of an Arabic keyboard, transliterate the Lebanese Arabic words in the Latin alphabet in a pattern similar to the Said Akl alphabet, the only difference being the use of digits to render the Arabic letters with no obvious equivalent in the Latin alphabet.\n\nThere is still today no generally accepted agreement on how to use the Latin alphabet to transliterate Lebanese Arabic words. However, Lebanese people are now using latin numbers while communicating online to make up for sounds not directly associable to latin letters. This is especially popular over text messages and apps such as WhatsApp.\nExamples:\n\nIn 2010, The Lebanese Language Institute has released a Lebanese Arabic keyboard layout and made it easier to write Lebanese Arabic in a Latin script, using unicode-compatible symbols to substitute for missing sounds.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2086500", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2086500", "title": "Wideopen", "text": "Wideopen\n\nWideopen, also occasionally spelled Wide Open, is a village in the administrative borough of North Tyneside, north of Gosforth and north of Newcastle upon Tyne city centre.\n\nWideopen adjoins the settlements of Seaton Burn, Brunswick Village and Hazlerigg. The village straddles the historic Great North Road, formerly the A1 trunk road, but is now bypassed by a new alignment of the A1 immediately to the west. The village lies in an area with a strong mining history and had its own colliery. Weetslade Country Park, to the east of the village, is reclaimed from an extensive area of coal mining activity.\n\nIn 2012 work commenced on the building of a new housing estate by Bellway homes, called Five Mile Park. It is located to the east of the Great North Road, between Lockey Park and Weetslade Country Park. The name refers to the distance from the centre of Newcastle – similarly there is a Three Mile Inn to the south, and a Six Mile Bridge to the north.\n\nThe village is present on an 1860s Ordnance Survey map as 'Wide Open', with the settlements of 'East Wideopen' to the east, and 'West Wideopen' to the south. The village name is nowadays written as one word in widespread use and appears on signage at either end of the village, but the alternative form of Wide Open is still occasionally found on maps and elsewhere. This leads to an inconsistency in contemporary addresses.\n\nThe pit shafts for the colliery were sunk and opened by Perkins and Thackrah in 1825. The colliery produced its first coal in May 1827. The coal was transported by the Fawdon Wagonway to Scotswood. The colliery was sketched by Thomas Harrison Hair in 1844 as part of his collection. There was for many years a scrapyard on the site, but this closed in 2011 to make way for new housing.\n\nTo the south of the village is the 19th-century Sacred Heart RC Church, a Grade II listed building notable for its stained glass windows, which bear designs by Pre-Raphaelite artists Edward Burne-Jones, Ford Madox Brown and William Morris.\n\nOther churches in Wideopen are St Columba's, the Anglican parish church, and St John's URC church.\n\nThe village is in the metropolitan borough of North Tyneside, in the county of Tyne and Wear. It has been in the Parliamentary constituency of North Tyneside since the creation of the constituency in 1997.\n\nThe village contains one pub (Travellers Rest), two health centres, a library, a garage, a supermarket, a post office, an ambulance station and various local shops. The village has two primary schools, Hazlewood Primary School and Greenfields Community Primary School; students in these schools normally progress to secondary education at Seaton Burn College.\n\nThe village has a local football club – Wideopen Juniors, playing with teams from seniors down to under 8's. The club is based at Lockey Park and has modern changing facilities built in 2008.\n\nWoodlands Hall provides indoor leisure facilities and Wideopen swimming pool (within the grounds of Greenfields Primary School) is used as a school learner pool.\n\nThe Reivers Cycle Route runs past the village providing access to a nationally designated cycle route from the east to west coast of England. The village is directly connected to the local waggonways network (former mineral railways) which provides opportunities for walking and cycling routes throughout North Tyneside.\n\nA driving range, The John Jacobs Golf centre, opened in 1966. This later became Wideopen Golf Club when an 18-hole course was opened in 1984. In 1986 the club changed its name to Parklands Golf Club, but occupies the same area within Gosforth Park.\n\nLying on the outskirts of the village, Wideopen Conservation Area was designated in January 2007 and a character appraisal was adopted in January 2009 by North Tyneside Council. The area includes the Grade II listed Sacred Heart Roman Catholic church.\n\nThe village is served by regular buses running into Newcastle upon Tyne city centre and Blyth town centre. Proximity to the A1 and A19 affords easy access to national road transport links. National rail travel, via the East Coast Main Line, is available at Newcastle station.\n\n\n"}

In the team race, each competing nation sent five athletes. For each heat, the top three athletes from each nation had their placings counted as part of the team score, though good performances by the other two could also help the team by worsening the scores of other teams. Team scores were arrived at by adding the rankings of the top three runners from the team, with low scores being desirable. Thus, a team that took the first three places in a heat would receive 1+2+3=6 points, the best possible score.\n\nThere were two heats in the first round, with three teams competing in each. The top two teams from each heat advanced to the final.\n\nThe four British athletes finished the race hand-in-hand; official reports give them a joint first place in the heat though assigning points to the team as if they had placed first through fourth. Thus, Great Britain received 1+2+3=6 points. Neither Italy nor the Netherlands had three men finish the race, and thus they had no score and were unable to advance to the final.\n\n\n\nThe United States team finished with 10 points, France had 15, and Sweden had 21. The top six runners finished in proximity, but the fact that three of the runners were American ensured the top spot to the United States.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2086569", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2086569", "title": "Superpressure balloon", "text": "Superpressure balloon\n\nA superpressure balloon is a style of aerostatic balloon where the volume of the balloon is kept relatively constant in the face of changes in ambient pressure outside the balloon, and the temperature of the contained lifting gas. This allows the balloon to keep a stable altitude for long periods. This is in contrast with much more common variable-volume balloons, which are either only partially filled with lifting gas, or made with more elastic materials.\n\nIn a variable-volume balloon, the volume of the lifting gas changes due to heating and cooling in the diurnal cycle. The cycle is magnified by a greenhouse effect inside the balloon, while the surrounding atmospheric gas is subject to a much more limited cyclical temperature change. As the lift gas heats and expands, the displacement of atmospheric gas increases, while the balloon weight remains constant. Its buoyancy increases, and this leads to a rise in altitude unless it is compensated by venting gas. Conversely, if the balloon cools and drops, it becomes necessary to release ballast. Since both ballast and gas are finite, there is a limit to how long a variable-volume balloon can compensate in order to stabilize its altitude. In contrast, a superpressure balloon will change altitude much less without compensation maneuvers.\n\nSince the volume of the balloon is more constrained, so is the volume of air displaced by it. In accordance with the Principle of Archimedes, the upwards force on the balloon is equal to the weight of the displaced ambient gas. But the weight of the atmospheric gas is reduced as the balloon rises, because its density diminishes with increasing altitude. So the force pushing the balloon upwards diminishes with altitude and at some particular altitude, the upwards force will equal the weight of the balloon. As a result, the balloon will be stable in a finite equilibrium altitude range for long periods.\n\nThe disadvantage is that such balloons require much stronger materials than non-pressurized types.\n\nSuperpressure balloons are typically used for extremely long duration flights of unmanned scientific experiments in the upper atmosphere, where atmospheric gas temperature is quite stable through the diurnal cycle. In 1985, such balloons were used for aerobots flying at an altitude of approximately 50 km in the atmosphere of Venus, in the international, Soviet-led Vega program. \n\nIn February 1974, Colonel Thomas L. Gatch Jr, USAR attempted to make the first crossing of the Atlantic by balloon in a superpressure balloon named \"Light Heart\". Following the loss of at least two of the ten balloons which provided lift, and after deviating substantially from the course that Colonel Gatch had plotted to take advantage of the jet stream, the last reported sighting of the \"Light Heart\" was 1,610 km west of the Canary Islands; no further trace of the aircraft was ever found.\n\nIn March 2015, NASA launched a SPB to an altitude of 110,000 feet for 32 days from New Zealand and landed in Australia after a leak was detected. This was the first time a SPB was flown for a long duration through the day and night cycle. When fully inflated, it was the size of a football stadium.\n\nGoogle's Project Loon uses superpressure balloons to achieve flights of over 200 days.\n\n\n"}

Bartel was perhaps most known for his 1982 hit black comedy \"Eating Raoul\", which he wrote, starred in and directed.\n\nBartel appeared in over 90 movies and TV episodes, including such titles as \"Eat My Dust\" (1976), \"Hollywood Boulevard\" (1976), \"Rock 'n' Roll High School\" (1979), \"Get Crazy\" (1983) and \"Amazon Women on the Moon\" (1987). He frequently co-starred with friend and former Warhol girl Mary Woronov; the pair appeared in 17 films together, often as husband and wife.\n\nBartel also directed 11 low-budget films, many of which he also acted in or wrote. He started in 1968 with the short \"The Secret Cinema\", a paranoid delusional fantasy of self-referential cinema. He graduated to features in 1972 with the horror-comedy \"Private Parts\". He would go on to direct such cult films as \"Death Race 2000\" (1975), \"Eating Raoul\" (1982), \"Lust in the Dust\" (1985) and \"Scenes from the Class Struggle in Beverly Hills\" (1989).\n\nBartel was born in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Jesse and William Bartel, who was an advertising executive.\n\nHe studied film and theatre at the University of California, Los Angeles, and spent a year on a Fulbright scholarship at the Centro Sperimentale film school in Rome, before returning to the US. He fulfilled his military service by talking his way into the Army Signal Corps Pictorial Center in Long Island City and later made films for the United States Information Agency.\n\nBartel's first films were made in high school, primarily abstract and animated 16mm shorts, including titles such as Cinema Experimental (1954), Non Objective Film (1956), Margaret Whiting Sings 'The Money Tree' (1956), and Camel Rock (1957). After making the 35mm short Italian-language film \"Progetti\" (1962) while attending the Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia in Rome, Bartel produced \"The Secret Cinema\" (1966). Shot on an extremely low budget in 35mm and with his own money, The Secret Cinema was the film that began his reputation as a new and unusual independent voice in narrative cinema.\n\nHe followed it with another short he wrote and directed, \"Naughty Nurse\" (1969). He co-wrote the feature \"Utterly Without Redeeming Social Value\" (1969), also starring in the lead. He worked as an actor only in \"Hi, Mom!\" (1970) directed by Brian De Palma.\n\nBartel's first feature as director was \"Private Parts\" (1972), a comedy horror film for MGM. It was produced by Gene Corman and Bartel was in the cast.\n\nCorman's brother Roger ran a production company, New World Pictures and hired Bartel to be second unit director on \"Big Bad Mama\" (1974), an action film. Bartel also played a small role.\n\nRoger Corman gave Bartel the job of directing \"Death Race 2000\" (1975), a satirical action comedy starring David Carradine, Sylvester Stallone and Mary Woronov. Bartel also played a small role. The film was a huge success at the box office and quickly established itself as a cult favorite.\n\nCorman promptly offered Bartel to do a similar action film with Carradine for New World, \"Cannonball\" (1976). Bartel also worked on the script. The film is littered with cameos from people such as Joe Dante and Martin Scorsese. Bartel later said he worked for a year on \"Death Race 2000\" for $5,000 \"so when it was finished I desperately needed money. The only thing anybody wanted from me was another car picture, hence \"Cannonball\". Corman had drummmed into me the idea that if \"Death Race\" had been \"harder\" and \"more real\" it would have been more popular. Like a fool, I believed him. I am not, and never have been, very much interested in cars and racing\" so he decided to load up the film \"cameos and character gimmicks that did interest me.\"\n\nBartel was in much demand from other directors at New World to play small parts in their pictures: he appeared in \"Eat My Dust\" (1976) for Ron Howard, \"Hollywood Boulevard\" (1976) for Joe Dante and Alan Arkush (quite a large role, as a director, which Bartel credited for really kicking off his acting career), \"Mr Billions\" (1977) for Jonathan Kaplan (not a New World film but Bartel met Kaplan at the company), \"Grand Theft Auto\" (1977) for Howard, \"Piranha\" (1978) for Dante, and \"Rock 'n' Roll High School\" (1979) for Arkush.\n\nOutside New World he appeared in \"The Hustler of Muscle Beach\" (1980) for Kaplan and \"Heartbeeps\" (1981) for Arkush.\n\nBartel wrote a script with Richard Blackburn, \"Eating Raoul\" (1982). Bartel managed to raise the finance and starred in the film along with Woronov. Made for $230,000 (raised by himself and his parents) it was a hit on the art house circuit, grossing $10 million, and became a cult movie.\n\nBartel had small roles in \"White Dog\" (1982), directed by Sam Fuller and produced by New World alumni Jon Davison, \"Trick or Treats\" (1982), \"Heart Like a Wheel\" (1983) for Kalpan, and \"Get Crazy\" (1983) for Arkus.\n\nThe success of \"Eating Raoul\" enabled Bartel to raise $3 million in finance (ten times the budget of \"Raoul\") for a screwball comedy he had co written and wanted to direct, \"Not for Publication\" (1984). It was a box office disaster.\n\nMore successful was \"Lust in the Dust\" (1985) starring Tab Hunter and Divine.\n\nBartel continued to be in demand as an actor, appearing in \"Frankenweenie\" (1984), a short for Tim Burton, \"Into the Night\" (1985) for John Landis, \"European Vacation\" (1985) for Amy Heckerling, and \"Follow That Bird\" (1985).\n\nBartel directed \"The Longshot\" (1986) based on a script by Tim Conway who starred. Bartel said he was a \"director for hire\" on the project. \"My sensibility was on some level antipathetic to what Tim Conway wanted. I was trying to find interesting things under the surface, and he just wanted more surface.\"\n\nHe appeared in an episode of \"Fame\" directed by Arkush, and reprised his \"Raoul\" character in \"Chopping Mall\" (1986) for Jim Wynorski produced by Julie Corman (Wynorski says Bartel and Woronov adlibbed their roles). He appeared in \"The Jar\", an episode of \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\" directed by Burton, and the film \"Killer Party\" (1986).\n\nHe directed two episodes of \"Amazing Stories\", both from his own scripts, both featuring him as an actor: \"Secret Cinema\" (a remake of his short film of the same name) and \"Gershwin's Trunk\".\n\nHe had roles in \"Munchies\" (1987) (produced by Roger Corman), \"Amazon Women on the Moon\" (1987) (in a segment directed by Dante), an episode of \"Crime Story\", \"Baja Oklahoma\" (1988), and \"Shakedown\" (1988).\n\nBartel co wrote but did not direct \"Mortuary Academy\" (1988); he and Woronov also played small roles. He was an executive producer on \"Out of the Dark\" (1988), in which he had a small role. He had a role in \"Caddyshack II\" (1988) directed by Arkush.\n\nBartel directed \"Scenes from the Class Struggle in Beverly Hills\" (1989), based on a story of his.\n\nHe wrote a sequel to \"Eating Raoul\" called \"Bland Ambition\", where Paul and Mary wind up running for Governor of California. It was about 10 days from the start of filming when Vestron withdrew its financial backing.\n\nBartel appeared in \"Pucker Up and Bark Like a Dog\" (1989), \"Far Out Man\" (1990), \"\" (1990) (for Dante), \"Dan Turner, Hollywood Detective\" (1990), an episode \"L.A. Law\" directed by Arkush, \"Liquid Dreams\" (1991), and \"Desire and Hell at Sunset Motel\" (1991).\n\nBartel had a large supporting role in \"The Pope Must Diet\" (1991), directed by Peter Richardson of The Comic Strip. and was in \"The Living End\" (1992) from Gregg Araki, \"Soulmates\" (1992), and \"Posse\" (1993).\n\nA musical adaptation of \"Eating Raoul\" premiered off Broadway in 1992.\n\nBartel appeared in some episodes of \"The Comic Strip Presents...\", even directing on (\"Demonella\"). He was in \"Acting on Impulse\", \"Tales of the City\" and \"Grief\" (1993).\n\nBartel's last feature as director was \"Shelf Life\" (1993). It was based on a play and done for a low budget and struggled to find distribution.\n\nBartel appeared in \"Twin Sitters\" (1993), \"The Usual Suspects\" (1995), and \"\" (1995). He had a rare star role in \"The Wacky Adventures of Dr. Boris and Nurse Shirley\" (1995) but was normally seen in minor parts: \"\" (1995), \"Not Like Us\" (1995) for Corman's new company Concorde Pictures, \"A Bucket of Blood\" (1995) also for Concorde, \"Number One Fan\" (1995), \"Red Ribbon Blues\" (1996), \"Joe's Apartment\" (1996), \"Escape from L.A.\" (1996), and \"Basquiat\" (1996).\n\nHe directed 2 episodes of \"Clueless\", \"We Shall Overpack\" and \"Cher Inc\". He also appeared in both.\n\nHe was in \"Prey of the Jaguar\" (1996), \"The Elevator\" (1996), \"Lewis & Clark & George\" (1997), \"Boston Common\", \"Skeletons\" (1997), \"The Inheritance\" (1997), \"Chicago Hope\", \"The Devil's Child\" (1997), \"Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss\" (1998), \"More Tales of the City\", \"Race\", \"Vengeance Unlimited\", \"Dreamers\",\"\", episodes of \"Ally McBeal\" and \"Snoops\" directed by Arkush, \"Good vs Evil\", \"Zoo\" (1999), \"Hamlet\" (2000), \"Dinner and a Movie\" (2001) and \"Perfect Fit\" (2001).\n\nBartel was openly gay; this influenced his career choice, as he found himself more accepted and afforded more opportunities within the independent film industry than he would have in Hollywood.\n\nIn 1979, he was a member of the jury at the 29th Berlin International Film Festival.\n\nBartel died May 13, 2000, of a heart attack two weeks after liver cancer surgery; he was 61 years old. His final screen appearance was a posthumous role as \"Dad\" alongside Mary Woronov (\"Mom\") in the 2001 independent film \"Perfect Fit\".\n\nThe Belgian horror movie \"Calvaire\" paid a tribute to the late Bartel – the mad innkeeper character is named \"Paul Bartel\".\n\nTwo of Bartel's early directorial efforts, \"Progetti\" and \"The Secret Cinema\", were restored by the Academy Film Archive.\n\n"}

The title refers to the classical elements of fire, earth, air, and water, plus the fifth element, spirit, accessible when one has balanced the other four.\n\nThe novel describes a world set in the year 2048 after a catastrophe which has fractured the United States into several nations. The protagonists live in San Francisco and have evolved in the direction of Ecotopia, reverting to a sustainable economy, using wind power, local agriculture, and the like. San Francisco is presented as a mostly pagan city where the streets have been torn up for gardens and streams, no one starves or is homeless, and the city's defense council consists primarily of nine elderly women who \"listen and dream\". The novel describes \"a utopia where women are leading societies but are doing so with the consent of men.\" To the south, an overtly-theocratic Christian fundamentalist nation has evolved and plans to wage war against the San Franciscans. The novel explores the events before and during the ensuing struggle between the two nations, pitting utopia and dystopia against each other.\n\nThe story is primarily told from the points of view of 98-year-old Maya, her nominal granddaughter Madrone, and her grandson Bird. Through these and other characters, the story explores many elements from ecofeminism and ecotopian fiction.\n\nIn the utopia described in the novel, the streets have been dug up and are replaced with gardens and fruit trees. Additionally, every house is equipped with a small garden plot. The food is available to everyone and access to food is not limited by money, power, or ownership. Farms where the city's fruit and vegetables grow are hidden behind the blocks of homes. There is plenty of food and everyone is said to have more than enough to eat. The gardens are lined with streams that run throughout the city. The only remnants of the pavement that once existed are narrow paths meant for walking, cycling, or rollerblading. These paths are accented with colorful stones and mosaics. The city is depicted as a beautiful locale where everything is shared yet nothing is lacking. In this ecotopian city, food and many other resources are understood as a commons, rather than a commodity. \n\nWhen the city is threatened by an army marching from the South, food becomes central to the non-violent philosophy and practice of the inhabitants as they grapple with how to respond to the possibility of violent attack. The inhabitants decide to invite soldiers to leave the army and to join them living in this ecotopian city. They say to the soldiers 'there is a place set for you at our table, if you will choose to join us' (p.235). This invitation, and the possibility of never going hungry, is almost incomprehensible to the soldiers who have been stripped of their given names and reduced to numbers, survive on small amounts of poor-quality food, and many have never seen running water.\n\nThe novel won \"Best Science Fiction, Fantasy or Horror Novel\" at the 6th Lambda Literary Awards. \"Kirkus Reviews\" described the book as \"a big, shaggy, sloppy dog of a fantasy\" and added, \"Starhawk deserves points for her idealism, but her vision and characterizations are only half-realized here—and further muddied as she goes on far, far too long.\" The review from \"Publishers Weekly\" called it a \"sometimes clumsy but compelling first novel\" by Starhawk: \"[she] delivers her message with a heavy hand and several cliches: her besieged utopia echoes the liberal politics and ecofeminism of her nonfiction; her dystopia features the overused SF bugbear of Christian fanaticism. However, she creates memorable characters—a young midwife, a broken musician, an old Witch-Woman—and skillfully conveys their emotions in gripping, sometimes harrowing scenes set against vivid backdrops.\"\n\nA prequel, \"Walking to Mercury\" (), was released in 1997. A sequel, \"City of Refuge\" (), was released in 2016 following a Kickstarter campaign by the author.\n\n"}
{"id": "2086591", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2086591", "title": "Hugh Porter", "text": "Hugh Porter\n\nHugh William Porter MBE (born Wolverhampton, England, 27 January 1940) is one of Britain's greatest former professional cyclists, winning four world titles in the individual pursuit - more than any other rider - as well as a Commonwealth Games gold medal in 1966. He is now a commentator on cycling events, working most notably for the BBC and ITV.\n\nPorter was born and raised in Wolverhampton and educated at the city's St Peter's Collegiate School. His father, Joe, was a cyclist and at 10, Hugh was taken to the Halesowen Velodrome to watch British sprint world champion Reg Harris.\n\nHe is married to British Olympic swimming gold medallist, Anita Lonsbrough; they met while travelling to Tokyo for the 1964 Summer Olympics and married in 1965.\n\nAged 16, Porter began racing as a junior for Wolverhampton Wheelers cycling club, finishing third in his first road race. He also became a regular competitor in weekly track league meetings at Wolverhampton’s Aldersley Stadium cycle track.\n\nAs a senior, he won his first race in July 1958 and by the end of the season another victory and other high placings led to a first-category licence for the 1959 season. First was the highest of three classes dependent on racing successes. Six victories came that season on the road, along with a gold medal on the track as part of his club's team pursuit squad at the national track championships at the Fallowfield Stadium, Manchester. He also won the Midlands title in the individual pursuit, but remained focused on developing as a road racer.\n\nIn the early 1960s he represented Great Britain in the Tour of Czechoslovakia in 1961 (26th overall) and in the Tour of Ireland. He also finished second that year in the season-long Star Trophy points competition assessed by results in set races through a season, and 17th in his first ride in the Tour of Britain. A year later he was 20th in the same event, and earned selection for the 1962 world championships in Italy to ride both the road race and team time trial events. However, over-exertion in the time trial led to a poor performance in the road race.\n\nPorter still dabbled in track racing and in 1963 performed well in the individual pursuit at Aldersley Stadium's Easter international meeting, before winning the final 10-mile scratch race. Encouraged, Porter began to consider contesting the national individual pursuit championship. In the meantime, he also raced in the national 25-mile individual time trial championship in Gloucestershire, finishing second. The individual pursuit championship was decided at Fallowfield Stadium; Porter was the fastest qualifier and, although headed in the early stages of the final, soon eased into the lead to beat Harry Jackson and win his first individual national title. Porter then travelled to the Rocourt velodrome, near Liège in Belgium, for the 1963 world championship, where he reached the semi-final, to be pipped by 0.18 seconds by Belgian Jean Walschaerts for a place in the final. He won the third-place ride-off to take a bronze medal.\n\n1964 was dominated by thoughts of the Olympic Games in Tokyo where Porter was already selected to ride the pursuit, though he still defended his British championship, emerging victorious at Herne Hill and shaving almost a second off the championship record. He also tested himself in the national 10-mile time-trial championship, finishing second, and was a member of the Wolverhampton Wheelers squad which won the national team pursuit title. However, while Porter qualified fifth fastest in Tokyo, he was suffering from a cold and was eliminated at the quarter-final stage, and went home without a medal, but he did meet his future wife, fellow Olympian and swimmer Anita Lonsbrough whom he married in Huddersfield on 17 June 1965.\n\nWhile Porter retained his British individual pursuit title and won several road races, 1965 was otherwise not memorable. He was defeated in the quarter-finals of the world pursuit championship in Spain (a timetable change meant he almost missed the contest, and, without his normal pre-race routine, he was narrowly defeated by Colombian Martin Rodriguez in the fastest race of the event).\n\nHowever, 1966 proved more successful. Porter began with 12 successive road race victories, and won a pursuit match in the Good Friday meeting at Herne Hill. He then rode the Tour of Britain, winning one stage, finishing second on three other stages, taking ninth place overall and second place in the points classification. His road victories assured him of victory in the season-long Star Trophy series. Without any further track races, he travelled to Jamaica for the 1966 Commonwealth Games, where he set a games record in qualifying for the semi-final of the individual pursuit, and then beat Australian Jan Bylsma in the final to take the gold medal.\n\nIn early 1967 Porter turned professional, riding for the Condor Mackeson team. The step up to the professional ranks meant that in the individual pursuit he was now racing 5,000m instead of 4,000m, but in his first test at the distance, he emerged victorious, beating Dave Bonner to win the professional title in Leicester. Porter was then selected to race in the world professional pursuit event in Amsterdam. Porter qualified for the final, but, unsettled by a puncture to his opponent, Tiemen Groen, that forced a re-run, he was beaten by two seconds. Nonetheless, his silver medal led to contracts from track promoters, including an invitation to ride the London six-day race – his first. He crashed on the fourth day, breaking his collar bone, and missed contracts for other six-day races. However, he recovered and spent much of the winter track-racing in Belgium, finishing the Antwerp six-day before returning to England for the start of the 1968 road season.\n\nPorter began 1968 with a time-trial stage victory and second place overall in a three-day race in Bournemouth, plus two stage wins and sixth overall in the Tour of the West. He was then selected for the British team to ride the Tour de France. Having retained his British pursuit title, he was expected to do well in the prologue time trial – and finished seventh of 120 starters. However, an injury returned and he abandoned on the third stage – a retirement that allowed him to concentrate on the world championship in Rome in late August.\n\nHe was the fastest qualifier, and recorded his fastest time of the championship in the quarter final, beating Siegfried Adler, then holder of the world professional indoor hour record. In the final, Porter faced Ole Ritter, later holder of the outdoor hour record, of Denmark and beat him by eight seconds to win his first world title, an achievement that merited the Bidlake Memorial Prize for 1968.\n\nThe following year Porter again qualified for the final of the individual pursuit at the Worlds in Antwerp, however he was defeated by Ferdinand Bracke, who started the final quickly and caught Porter within a dozen laps. Porter regained his title in 1970 on home soil when the Worlds were held at Saffron Lane sports centre in Leicester, setting the fastest time in qualifying by seven seconds and beating Lorenzo Bosisio in the final by eleven seconds. At the 1971 Worlds in Varese, Porter finished third, prompting rival Dirk Baert to claim: \"Porter is finished, he is an old man\". However Porter rebounded the following year to take his third individual pursuit title at the Worlds in Marseille, defeating Bracke, despite Bracke holding a two and a half second lead by lap seven. Porter described this as his \"most cherished\" world championship: \"I beat Bracke, the rider I had the most respect for... He held the Hour record, finished third in the Tour de France and won the Vuelta. He was some rider\". In 1973 Porter took his fourth world title in San Sebastian, qualifying fastest and catching Martín Rodríguez in the quarter-finals (gaining revenge for the 1965 Amateur World Championships, also in San Sebastian, where Porter had also qualified fastest but had been knocked out by Rodríguez in the next round) before beating Mogens Frey in the semis and defeating René Pijnen by ten seconds in the final after trailing him with seven laps remaining.\n\nPorter is a TV commentator and public-address commentator at events. He started his broadcasting career at Radio Birmingham. He has often worked for BBC Sport and ITV Sport and has voiced the Olympic and Commonwealth Games (track and road), World Championships (track and road) and World Cup track meetings. He commentated on cycling at every Olympics from the 1984 Games in Los Angeles to the 2012 Games in London.\n\nHe commentated on the 2009 Tour of Britain for ITV4, while also public-address commentator. Porter kept referring to the 'stage announcer', which was himself. Porter is a regular at Manchester and Newport velodromes. He is the voice of the \"Revolution\" series at Manchester.\n\nHe is often assisted by his wife Anita Lonsbrough who sits alongside him off-microphone and helps him with his notes.\n\nHe has also worked on the Winter Olympics for the BBC, where he commentated on the speed skating events.\n\nHugh has joined forces with British Swimming and is now \"the voice of British Swimming\", commentating at all the major events throughout the year.\n\nPorter's achievements were celebrated in 1972 when Cycling Weekly awarded him his own page in the Golden Book of Cycling.\n\nIn March 1973, Porter travelled to Buckingham Palace and was made an MBE for services to cycle racing.\n\nPorter was presented with an award for Outstanding Contribution to Cycling at the World Track Championships in Manchester in March 2008.\n\nIn 2009, Porter was inducted into the British Cycling Hall of Fame.\n\nPorter was made Freeman of the City of Wolverhampton in 2009 and there is a road named after him in Aldersley, Wolverhampton (\"Hugh Porter Way\" which leads to Aldersley Leisure Village, where Porter's old club, Wolverhampton Wheelers CC, is based and uses the velodrome). He has also received an honorary degree from the University of Wolverhampton.\n\nPorter is honorary patron of Halesowen Athletic and Cycling Club.\n\nIn 2015, Porter was awarded the Outstanding Contribution to Sport award at the Black Country Sport & Physical Activity awards hosted by the Black Country BeActive Partnership where, accompanied by his wife Anita, he received a standing ovation on receiving the honour.\n\n"}
{"id": "2086606", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2086606", "title": "Deval Patrick", "text": "Deval Patrick\n\nDeval Laurdine Patrick (born July 31, 1956) is an American politician, civil rights lawyer, author, and businessman who served as the 71st governor of Massachusetts, from 2007 to 2015. He was first elected in 2006, succeeding Mitt Romney, who chose not to run for reelection to focus on his presidential campaign. He was reelected in 2010. He was the first African American Governor of Massachusetts. A Democrat, Patrick served from 1994 to 1997 as the United States Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division under President Bill Clinton. He was briefly a candidate for President of the United States in the 2020 U.S. presidential election.\n\nRaised largely by a single mother on the South Side of Chicago, Patrick earned a scholarship to Milton Academy in Milton, Massachusetts in the eighth grade. He went on to attend Harvard College and Harvard Law School, where he was president of the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau. After graduating, he practiced law with the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund and later joined a Boston law firm, where he was named a partner at age 34. In 1994, Bill Clinton appointed him as the United States assistant attorney general for the civil rights division of the United States Department of Justice, where he worked on issues including racial profiling and police misconduct.\n\nDuring his governorship, Patrick oversaw the implementation of the state's 2006 health care reform program which had been enacted under Mitt Romney, increased funding to education and life sciences, won a federal Race to the Top education grant, passed an overhaul of governance of the state transportation function, signing a law to create the Massachusetts Department of Transportation, increased the state sales tax from 5% to 6.25%, raised the state's minimum wage from $8 per hour to $11 by 2017, and planned the introduction of casinos to the state. Under Patrick, Massachusetts joined the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) in an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Shortly after Patrick's second term began on January 6, 2011, he declared he would not seek re-election in 2014.\n\nPatrick is a managing director at Bain Capital and serves as the chairman of the board for Our Generation Speaks, a fellowship program and startup incubator whose mission is to bring together young Israeli and Palestinian leaders through entrepreneurship. He also holds a Board of Directors position at telehealth company American Well.\n\nMembers of his own inner circle and Barack Obama's inner circle encouraged Patrick to run for president in 2020, but Patrick ruled out a 2020 presidential bid in December 2018. In November 2019, however, uneasy about the existing field of Democratic candidates, Patrick was reported to have called a few leading Democrats and allies to say that he would soon announce a 2020 presidential bid. He formally entered the race on November 14, 2019. He ended his campaign on February 12, 2020, following a very poor showing in the Iowa caucus and the New Hampshire primary.\n\nPatrick was born on July 31, 1956 in the South Side of Chicago, where his family resided in a two-bedroom apartment in the Robert Taylor Homes' housing projects. Patrick is the son of Emily Mae (\"née\" Wintersmith) and Pat Patrick, a jazz musician in Sun Ra's band. In 1959, Patrick's father abandoned their family in order to play music in New York City, and because he had fathered a daughter, La'Shon Anthony, by another woman. Deval reportedly had a strained relationship with his father, who opposed his choice of high school, but they eventually reconciled. Patrick was raised by his mother, who traces her roots to American slaves in Kentucky. The family spent many months living on welfare.\nWhile Patrick was in middle school, one of his teachers referred him to A Better Chance, a national non-profit organization for identifying, recruiting and developing leaders among academically gifted minority students, which enabled him to attend Milton Academy in Milton, Massachusetts. Patrick graduated from Milton Academy in 1974 and went on to attend college, the first in his family. He graduated from Harvard College, where he was a member of the Fly Club, with a Bachelor of Arts degree, \"cum laude,\" in English and American literature, in 1978. He then spent a year working with the United Nations in Africa. In 1979, Patrick returned to the United States and enrolled at Harvard Law School. While in law school, Patrick was elected president of the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau, where he first worked defending poor families in Middlesex County, Massachusetts. At Harvard, Patrick won \"Best Oralist\" in the prestigious Ames Moot Court Competition, in 1981.\n\nPatrick graduated from Harvard Law School with a J.D., \"cum laude,\" in 1982. He proceeded to fail the State Bar of California exam twice, before passing on his third try. Patrick then served as a law clerk to Judge Stephen Reinhardt on the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit for one year. In 1983, he joined the staff of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund (LDF), where he worked on death penalty and voting rights cases.\n\nWhile at LDF, he met Bill Clinton, the then Governor of Arkansas, when he sued Clinton in a voting case. In 1986, he joined the Boston law firm of Hill & Barlow and was named partner in 1990, at the age of 34. While at Hill & Barlow, he managed high-profile engagements such as acting as Desiree Washington's attorney in her civil lawsuit against Mike Tyson.\nIn 1994, President Bill Clinton nominated Patrick as the United States Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division, and he was subsequently confirmed by the United States Senate. Federal affirmative action policy was under judicial and political review, and Patrick defended Clinton's policy. Patrick also worked on issues including racial profiling, police misconduct, and the treatment of incarcerated criminals.\"\n\nBetween 1995 and 1997, Patrick coordinated an investigation into a series of arsons of predominantly black churches across the South. The investigation brought together a number of state and federal agencies, and was the largest federal investigation in history until the time of 9/11. In the end, more than 100 arrests were made, but no evidence of national or regional conspiracy was found.\n\nIn 1997, Patrick returned to Boston to join the firm of Day, Berry & Howard (later called Day Pitney LLP), and was appointed by the federal district court to serve as Chairman of Texaco's Equality and Fairness Task Force to oversee implementation of the terms of a race discrimination settlement. Working with employees at all levels, Patrick and his Task Force examined and reformed Texaco's complex corporate employment culture, and created a model for fostering an equitable workplace.\n\nSome gay rights activists criticized him for his tenure on the United Airlines (UAL) board. During this time, the company originally fought an ordinance requiring that it offer domestic partnership benefits, but Patrick successfully encouraged UAL to offer such benefits to all employees, making it the first airline to do so.\n\nIn 1999, partly because of his work on the Equality and Fairness Task Force, Patrick was offered the job as General Counsel of Texaco, responsible for all of the company's legal affairs. While he continued his work transforming employment practices at the company, the majority of his time was devoted to exploring and working out a merger, ultimately announced in October 2000, with larger Chevron Corp.\n\nIn 2001, Patrick left Texaco to become the Executive Vice-President, General Counsel and Secretary at The Coca-Cola Company. Patrick pushed for a thorough review of allegations that some workers at bottlers of Coke products in Colombia had been abused or even killed by paramilitary groups as a result of union organizing activity. Patrick concluded the allegations to be unsubstantiated and untrue, but counseled that the company allow an independent inquiry to lay all questions to rest. After initially supporting Patrick's view, then-CEO Douglas Daft changed his mind, precipitating Patrick's decision to leave Coke.\n\nFrom 2004 to 2006, he served on the board of directors of ACC Capital Holdings, the parent company of Ameriquest and Argent Mortgage. Ameriquest was the largest lender of so-called subprime mortgages and was under investigation by Attorneys General across the country. Patrick joined the board at the request of Ameriquest's founder, Roland Arnall, who asked for his help managing the investigations and changing the company's culture. During his tenure on the board, Ameriquest and Argent originated over $80 billion in subprime mortgages, but those conducting the investigation said that at the time Patrick left Ameriquest the company was on the road to change.\n\nFollowing his career as governor, Patrick joined the private equity firm Bain Capital in 2015, where he is currently acting as a Managing Director.\n\nIn 2005, Patrick announced his candidacy for governor of Massachusetts. He was at first seen as a dark horse candidate, facing veteran politicians Thomas Reilly and Chris Gabrielli in the Democratic primary. Patrick secured the nomination in the September primary, winning 49% of the vote in the three-way race. In the general election, Patrick faced Republican Lieutenant Governor Kerry Healey and Independent Massachusetts Turnpike Commission member Christy Mihos.\n\nThe general election was very heated, described by former governor Michael Dukakis as \"the dirtiest gubernatorial campaign in my memory\". Patrick faced criticism for having once written letters to the parole board describing correspondence from Benjamin LaGuer, a man convicted of a brutal eight-hour rape, as \"thoughtful, insightful, eloquent, [and] humane\".\n\nPatrick contributed $5,000 towards the DNA testing which linked LaGuer to the crime. However, once the DNA test proved LaGuer's guilt, Patrick withdrew his support for the inmate's release.\nPatrick won the general election with 55% of the vote, becoming the first Democratic governor of Massachusetts since Michael Dukakis left office in 1991, and the state's first African-American governor.\n\nOn April 2, 2009, Patrick announced alongside Lt. Governor Timothy Murray that they would both run for re-election.\n\nPatrick was opposed for the Democratic nomination by Grace Ross, the 2006 Green-Rainbow nominee for governor, but she withdrew when she could not garner the number of signatures needed to run.\n\nPatrick bucked the national trend in the mid-term election, defeating Republican challenger Charlie Baker with 48.4% of the vote. Baker received 42.0% and Tim Cahill, a former Democratic state treasurer running as an independent, took 8.0%. Nationally, Republicans gained a net of 63 seats to take control of the House, but remained a minority in the Senate despite gaining 7 seats.\n\nBefore taking office, Patrick assembled a transition team headed by lawyer Michael Angelini, bank executive Ronald Homer, and Weld administration economic affairs secretary Gloria Cordes Larson. In his first meetings with the legislative leadership, he proposed his first action would be to hire 1,000 new police officers and to expand full-day kindergarten statewide.\n\nBreaking with the tradition of being inaugurated in the House Chamber of the Massachusetts State House, Patrick and Murray took their oaths of office, and Patrick delivered his inaugural address, outdoors on the West Portico of the State House facing Boston Common.\n\nDoing this allowed a larger part of the public to witness the event, and was intended to signal a more open, transparent, and accessible government. In honor of his heritage, he took his oath of office on the Mendi Bible, which was given to then-Congressman John Quincy Adams by the freed American slaves from the ship \"La Amistad\".\n\nA series of regional inaugural balls, seven in total, were held to bring the inauguration to the citizens of the Commonwealth. The celebrations took place in Cape Cod, Worcester, Dartmouth, Pittsfield, Springfield, and Boston.\n\nPatrick crafted and signed a bill that allows for the construction and operation of three resort-style casinos in the state. He argued that these casinos would generate over $2 billion for the state economy. He also touted that the casinos would create 30,000 construction jobs and 20,000 permanent jobs.\n\nPatrick proposed that the revenue generated would be spent to beef up local law enforcement, create a state gambling regulatory agency, repair roads and bridges, and aid in gambling addiction treatment, and that the remainder would go towards property tax relief.\n\nPatrick's casino plan had faced strong opposition from Salvatore DiMasi, the former Speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives. DiMasi questioned Patrick's projections of new jobs and revenues to be generated, and was opposed to what he referred to as a casino culture, saying: \"Do we want to usher in a casino culture– with rampant bankruptcies, crime and social ills– or do we want to create a better Massachusetts for all sectors of the society?\"\n\nCasino gaming lobbying in Massachusetts has also received scrutiny for associations with the Jack Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal and efforts by the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe to secure rights to a casino outside the legal framework of the federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. In 2009, Patrick was among the top campaign contribution recipients from casino lobbying interests, and from financiers backing the Wampanoag casino interests.\n\nOn March 20, 2008, the Massachusetts House of Representatives rejected Patrick's casino bill by a vote of 108 to 46. Despite the overwhelming vote, questions were raised by critics of DiMasi as to the tactics he used to win. These included allegations that he promised a subsequent vote on a bill that would allow slot machines at the state's four racetracks and the pre-vote promotions of six lawmakers who had been thought to support the bill, but either abstained or voted against the bill. DiMasi denied that any promise had been made on the race track bill and denied that the promotions were connected to the casino bill vote.\n\nPatrick's conduct was also criticized and his commitment to the bill questioned when it was revealed that he was not in the state on the day the bill was voted on in the legislature. As the bill was being voted down, Patrick was in New York City on personal business, finalizing a $1.35-million deal with Broadway Books, an imprint of Random House, to publish his autobiography.\n\nBy mid-2010, the house and senate passed a bill with plans for three resort-style casinos and two slot parlors. However, Patrick vetoed it as he previously stated that he would only accept one slot parlor. When the 2011 casino legislation was still in debate, an investigative report in \"The Boston Globe\" revealed the governor violated his self-imposed policy of not accepting money from or meeting with lobbyists for the gambling industry, by accepting more than $6,000 in campaign contributions, and meeting with and attending fundraisers hosted by gaming lobbyists.\n\nPatrick signed the legislation into law in December 2011. Its implementation, however, has seen hurdles and delays. The governor's point man on crafting gaming legislation and negotiating a state compact with the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe, Assistant Secretary for Policy & Economic Development Carl Stanley McGee, was forced to resign from his appointment to direct the newly formed Massachusetts Gaming Commission following reports of 2007 charges that he molested a child in Florida. Stan McGee was forced to return to his economic development post where he still oversees casino policies for the governor. The scandal resulted in the Massachusetts legislature passing a bill and overriding a veto by Patrick requiring background checks on casino regulators.\n\nIn June 2014, the Supreme Judicial Court ruled that a referendum to repeal legislation permitting casino gambling could appear on the November ballot, throwing the prospects of the casino legislation into question.\n\nIn 2010, Patrick pushed for legislation to limit the purchase of firearms, citing a series of gun violence incidents and violent crime in Boston. In 2011, Patrick proposed new legislation that would require more stringent regulations on firearms. During an event surrounding the announcement, Patrick said one of his main goals was to \"stop children from killing children.\" Patrick also reported that he would ask for $10 million in private and public funding to help \"fill the gaps.\" Reacting to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, in 2013 Patrick proposed stricter gun control laws, including a limit of one firearm purchase a month and closing the gun show loophole.\n\nThroughout his term in office, Patrick has made achieving \"world-class public education\" a main priority of his administration. Patrick also committed a historic amount of public funds to Massachusetts schools, introduced legislation to tackle a persistent education gap among minority students, and won the national Race to the Top competition. Patrick now supports a doubling of the number of charter schools in Massachusetts. In his first year in office, Patrick proposed making community college free to all Massachusetts high school graduates.\n\nAs of 2005, Patrick favored the legalization of same-sex marriage because of the fundamental principle that \"citizens come before their government as equals\". He worked with the state legislature to prevent a ballot measure eliminating same-sex marriage in Massachusetts, which protected the state's first-in-the-nation same-sex marriage allowance.\n\nPatrick proposed a bill that would streamline Massachusetts' permit appeals process for wind energy projects. The Wind Energy Siting Reform bill would reduce the permitting process to nine to 19 months.\n\nPatrick made expanding renewable energy a focus of his second term, but faced a setback when lawmakers failed to raise caps on solar generation in Massachusetts and to expand the amount of hydropower purchased by utility companies from Canada.\n\nThe legislatively chartered Transportation Finance Commission (TFC) reported in 2007 that over the next 20 years there would be $15–$19 billion gap between revenues and necessary expenditures, just to maintain the existing transportation system in Massachusetts. The Commission identified several reforms and revenue options to close the gap. The Patrick Administration lobbied for and passed a major transportation reform bill, which incorporated many of the TFC-recommended reforms, and which created the Massachusetts Department of Transportation by merging smaller transportation agencies.\n\nPatrick proposed raising the state gas tax by 19¢ per gallon to forestall Massachusetts Turnpike toll and MBTA fare increases, fully fund Regional Transit Authority and Turnpike operations, and address part of the capital shortfall identified by the TFC, but this was defeated in the state legislature. Instead, a sales tax increase of 1.25% was passed, with part of that dedicated to transportation. This was enough to prevent the short-term toll and fare increases, but did not address the long-term funding gap. Patrick has been a supporter of the South Coast Rail Link project.\n\nIn response to the influx of children from Central America crossing the US border in the summer of 2014, Patrick proposed taking 1,000 migrants to be housed at various sites in Massachusetts, until they can be processed at immigration centers.\n\nOn September 24, 2009, Patrick appointed Paul G. Kirk as the interim U.S. senator in the wake of Ted Kennedy's death.\n\nOn January 30, 2013, Patrick chose his former chief-of-staff Mo Cowan to serve as interim U.S. senator until a special election to fill the seat left vacant by Secretary of State designate John Kerry.\n\nIn the early months of Patrick's administration, a series of decisions the governor later conceded as \"missteps\" brought substantial unfavorable press. These included spending almost $11,000 on drapery for the governor's state house suite, changing the state's customary car lease from a Ford Crown Victoria to a Cadillac (thus earning Patrick the snide nickname \"Deville\"), and hiring Amy Gorin, an assistant who had previously helped chair his election campaign, as a staff assistant to Diane Patrick, the Commonwealth's First Lady, at an annual salary of almost $75,000. Emerging from a weekend of working on the state's budget and calling for cuts in services to taxpayers, Patrick responded in a February 20, 2007 press conference that \"I realize I cannot in good conscience ask the agencies to make those choices without being willing to make them myself.\" Patrick subsequently reimbursed the Commonwealth for the cost of the drapery and furniture purchased for the state house, and the additional monthly difference in his car lease. Gorin later resigned.\n\nLater in the same month Patrick again came under fire, this time for contacting Citigroup Executive Committee chair and former Clinton Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin on behalf of the financially beleaguered mortgage company Ameriquest, a subsidiary of ACC Capital Holdings, that had been accused of predatory lending practices and of which Patrick is a former board member. Both Citigroup and ACC Capital Holdings have substantial holdings in Massachusetts. Patrick attempted to deflect criticism, claiming he was calling not as governor but as a private citizen. Later Patrick backed down, stating \"I appreciate that I should not have made the call. I regret the mistake.\"\n\nOn September 17, 2014, Patrick fired the Massachusetts Sex Offender Registry Board chair Saundra Edwards and placed director Jeanne Holmes on paid administrative leave because they had pressured the board to force Bernard Sigh – Patrick's brother-in-law – to register as a sex offender. Sigh had pleaded guilty to raping his wife (Patrick's sister) in California in 1993 and neglected to register as a sex offender when he later moved to Massachusetts. Sigh assaulted his wife again in 2017; in June 2019 he was convicted of rape, stalking, kidnapping, and witness intimidation. In November 2019, Patrick spoke to the \"NH Journal\" about having intervened to help keep his brother-in-law off the sex offender registry, saying, \"No, I don't have any regrets. [...] I stuck up for him then because that was respectful of my sister and I think it was the right thing to do.\"\n\nIn June 2015, the \"Boston Herald\" reported that Patrick's administration secretly diverted nearly $27 million in government funds to off-budget accounts that paid for trade junkets tab, advertising contracts, and a deal with a federally subsidized tourism venture backed by U.S. Sen. Harry Reid. According to the \"Herald\", state legislators never approved the funding, which began in 2009 when Patrick's office directed quasi-public state agencies, including the Massachusetts Convention Center Authority and Massport to begin funding off-budget trusts. A week later, the \"Boston Globe\" quoted Representative David Linsky, chair of the Massachusetts House of Representatives Post Audit and Oversight Committee, as saying that, upon review, the expenditures were either approved by the state legislature or permissible under the state's budget rules and that they violated no applicable law.\n\nIn 2014, Patrick signed a law requiring health insurers to extend coverage to people struggling with drug addiction by covering up to two weeks of inpatient treatment. The bill was seen in the broader context of state government battling the soaring opioid drug abuse rates, following a $20 million package introduced in June consisting of proposals targeting the problem. In the same year, Patrick signed a bill that would allow police to order anti-abortion protesters away from clinic entrances, if hindering public access.\n\nPatrick joined the board of Our Generation Speaks.\n\nHe served as senior advisor to the Chicago Police Accountability Task Force.\n\nFollowing Patrick's speech at the 2012 Democratic National Convention, a reporter asked if Patrick was interested in a 2016 presidential bid. He responded that he intended to return to the private sector after completing his second term as governor. In July 2013, Patrick unequivocally ruled out a 2016 presidential bid.\n\nOn February 28, 2018, in response to reports that David Axelrod and Valerie Jarrett wanted him to run for president, Patrick stated on public radio that it was \"on my radar screen\". On December 6, 2018, Patrick formally stated via Facebook that he would not be running for president in 2020, writing, \"I’ve been overwhelmed by advice and encouragement from people from all over the country, known and unknown. Humbled, in fact. But knowing that the cruelty of our elections process would ultimately splash back on people whom Diane and I love, but who hadn’t signed up for the journey, was more than I could ask.\"\n\nOn November 11, 2019, however, \"The New York Times\" reported that Patrick was considering making a late entry into the presidential race. Two days later, it was reported that Patrick would file to run, beginning with New Hampshire. The next day, on November 14, Patrick officially announced that he would enter the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries. His campaign manager was Abe Rakov.\n\nPatrick's second scheduled public event since announcing his candidacy, a speech at Morehouse College in Atlanta, Georgia on November 20, 2019, was cancelled when only two people showed up. The event, however, was scheduled with only twenty-four hours notice, and preceded the Democratic presidential primary debate that same night and only a few miles away.\n\nDeval Patrick's first campaign ads started January 8 in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina. He spent $100,000 in ads in New Hampshire and $60,000 in South Carolina. Despite a 29% approval rating in New Hampshire, he enjoyed support from only 1% of voters, according to a WBUR-FM poll; a November Quinnipiac poll in South Carolina produced similar results. Morning Consult reported that 46% of Democratic primary voters have never heard of him.\n\nFollowing a poor showing in the New Hampshire primary on February 12, 2020, Patrick suspended his campaign.\n\nDuring the 2008 Democratic primaries, Patrick came to the defense of presidential candidate Barack Obama following plagiarism allegations that key phrases from an Obama stump speech were very similar to words used during Patrick's own 2006 gubernatorial run. The claims were largely dismissed after Patrick explained that he had encouraged their use.\n\nAfter Obama's 2008 election as president, speculation arose that Patrick would be chosen by Obama to serve as United States Attorney General, but the post ultimately went to Eric Holder.\n\nDuring the 2012 Presidential election, Patrick served as a surrogate for the Obama campaign. Patrick generated controversy when he took a position that directly opposed that of the campaign, defending the business practices of the Boston-based private equity firm Bain Capital, which was founded by Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee.\n\nFollowing the 2012 presidential election, Patrick was considered to be a potential successor to Holder, although Patrick had said he would not consider any other position as long as he remained governor. Speculation grew once again in September 2014, when Holder announced his intention to step down. The position was subsequently given to Loretta Lynch.\n\nIn March 2016, Patrick was named by \"USA Today\" as a possible Obama nominee to fill the U.S. Supreme Court associate justice seat, vacated by the February 2016 death of Antonin Scalia.\n\nPatrick and his wife Diane, a lawyer specializing in labor and employment law, married in 1984. They have lived in Milton, Massachusetts since 1989 and have two daughters, Sarah and Katherine. In July 2008, Katherine publicly announced that she is lesbian, and mentioned that her father did not know this while he was fighting against a proposed amendment to the state constitution that would have banned same-sex marriage. In a joint interview Patrick expressed support for his daughter and said he was proud of her. In September 2011, his daughter Sarah married Marco Morgese, a former Italian soldier. On May 20, 2013, Patrick became a grandfather when Sarah gave birth to a son, Gianluca Noah Patrick Morgese.\n\nIn addition to his Milton home, Patrick and his family own a home in Richmond, Massachusetts. In 2013, Illinois governor Pat Quinn renamed a part of Wabash Avenue in Chicago, where Patrick grew up, \"Deval Patrick Way\" in Patrick's honor. On May 28, 2015, Patrick was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws by Harvard University.\n\n\n"}

At the same time, he also obtained Turkish citizenship, and started playing international basketball with the senior Turkish national team. In 1999, he became the first Turkish basketball player to play in the National Basketball Association (NBA).\n\nIn the EuroLeague, Türkcan amassed total of 50 double doubles, and is one of only three players since the year 2000, to record a 20-point, 20-rebound game (27 points and 23 rebounds). He led the EuroLeague in rebounding five times. He was nominated for the EuroLeague 2001–10 All-Decade Team, but he did not make the final list. He became a EuroLeague Legend in 2017.\n\nTürkcan grew up with Efes Pilsen's junior teams, and he made his professional debut with the Efes Pilsen senior men's team, during the 1994–95 season. He won two Turkish Super League championships, in the 1995–96 and 1996–97 seasons with Efes.\n\nTürkcan was selected by the Houston Rockets in the 1998 NBA Draft. A few days after the draft night, he said in an interview: \"This is a big step for me, but I played in Turkey, and I am the first Turkish player to come into the NBA. This is very important for me, for my family, and for my country.\" Because of the 1998–99 NBA lockout, he returned to Istanbul, continuing to play for Efes Pilsen. Later, his rights were traded to the Philadelphia 76ers, in January 1999, and then to the New York Knicks, in March.

In the summer of 2009, he extended his contract with the Turkish club for the next two seasons. In February 2011, Türkcan ruptured the anterior cruciate ligaments in his left knee, during the Turkish Cup final, and because of that, he missed the rest of the season.\n\nIn July 2012, it was reported that Türkcan would announce his retirement, after 19 years of playing professional basketball.

He was the lead editor of \"The New Republic\" from 1997 to 1999. After the \"New Republic\", he worked for the \"Post\", where, from 2000 to 2009, he covered the Supreme Court of the United States and judicial system issues. He has since joined the newspaper's editorial page.\n\nBorn to a Jewish family in 1961, Lane went to Bethesda-Chevy Chase High School, where he was managing editor of the school newspaper, \"The Tattler\". He earned his bachelor's degree from Harvard University in 1983. As a Knight Fellow, he earned a Master of Studies in Law from Yale Law School in 1997.\n\nLane is a former foreign correspondent for \"Newsweek\" and served as the magazine's Berlin bureau chief. His coverage of the former Yugoslavia was featured in the book \"Crimes of War: What the Public Should Know,\" edited by Roy Gutman and David Rieff.\n\n\"The New Republic\"'s owner, Marty Peretz, appointed Lane as editor in 1997 after firing Michael Kelly. Kelly had published a series of articles that Peretz felt were too critical of President Bill Clinton. In 1998, a scandal arose at \"The New Republic\" when fabricated reporting by Stephen Glass was discovered. Lane fired Glass. Peretz replaced Lane with Peter Beinart in 1999. Lane reportedly learned of his firing from the media before he heard about it from Peretz.\n\nThe Glass fabrications were \"the greatest scandal in the magazine's history and marked a decade of waning influence and mounting financial losses,\" the \"New York Times\" would later report. Explaining why it took so long to catch Glass' fraud, Peretz blamed two of his editors, Michael Kelly and Lane, for not catching the fraud earlier. Lane, Peretz claimed, ignored obvious warning signs of the fabrication, and then attempted to unfairly lay the blame to his predecessor, Kelly. Peretz claimed that Lane's alleged inaction \"sullied the good name of the \"New Republic\". Peretz subsequently fired Lane.\" According to an account in the \"American Prospect\", \"Lane got the news [of his firing] from a \"Washington Post\" reporter who called to inquire about his future plans.\"\n\nLane has taught journalism at Georgetown University in Washington, DC and at Princeton University.\n\nIn 2008 Lane published \"\", about the Colfax massacre of 1873 in Louisiana of blacks by white militia, including the murder of surrendered prisoners. He explored its political repercussions during Reconstruction, including the resulting Supreme Court case from United States prosecution of perpetrators, \"United States v. Cruikshank\" (1876). The Court ruled that actions of individuals were not covered by constitutional protections and suggested that individuals should seek relief in state courts. But during and for many decades after Reconstruction, these rarely prosecuted and never convicted white men for offenses against blacks.\n\nThe 1998 journalism scandal at \"The New Republic\" was portrayed in the 2003 film \"Shattered Glass\". Lane was portrayed by actor Peter Sarsgaard.\n\nGlass published a \"biographical novel\" entitled \"The Fabulist\" (2003) about his career of journalistic fabrication. \"Robert Underwood\" was a major character in the \"novel\" and taken as a fictionalized version of Charles Lane. Reviewing the book for the \"Washington Post\", Chris Lehmann wrote that the Underwood character \"is meant to induce in-the-know readers to think poorly of Charles Lane.\"\n\nLane is married to a German immigrant from the former East Berlin. They have three children.\n\n"}

Originally, Regal scouted Jean-Paul Levesque and was slated to be a tag team, before Levesque left to join the WWF. Eventually, Regal recruited Alabama-born Bobby Eaton, getting him (kayfabe) \"knighted\" to rename him \"Earl Robert Eaton\" and taking it upon himself to teach Eaton the finer points of the British lifestyle; including the Queen's English and proper dining etiquette.\n\nThe team feuded with Harlem Heat (Booker T and Stevie Ray) and the team of Bunkhouse Buck and Dick Slater over the WCW World Tag Team Championship but never got their hands on the titles. Later they were joined by \"Squire\" David Taylor and a butler named Jeeves, whom they openly abused.

Paper bags are commonly used as shopping bags, packaging, and sacks.\n\nIn 1852, Francis Wolle, a schoolteacher, invented the first machine to mass-produce paper bags. Wolle and his brother patented the machine and founded the Union Paper Bag Company.\nIn 1871, inventor Margaret E. Knight designed a machine that could create flat-bottomed paper bags, which could carry more than the previous envelope-style design.\n\nIn 1883, Charles Stilwell patented a machine that made square-bottom paper bags with pleated sides, making them easier to fold and store. This style of bag came to be known as the S.O.S., or \"Self-Opening Sack\".\n\nIn 1912, Walter Deubener, a grocer in Saint Paul, Minnesota, used cord to reinforce paper bags and add carrying handles. These \"Deubener Shopping Bags\" could carry up to 75 pounds at a time, and became quite popular, selling over a million bags a year by 1915. Paper bags with handles later became the standard for department stores, and were often printed with the store's logo or brand colors.\n\nPlastic bags were introduced in the 1970s, and thanks to their lower cost, eventually replaced paper bags as the bag of choice for grocery stores. With the trend towards phasing out lightweight plastic bags, though, some grocers and shoppers have switched back to paper bags.\n\nIn 2015, the world's largest paper shopping bag was made in the UK and recorded by Guinness World Records.\n\nStandard brown paper bags are made from kraft paper. Tote-style paper bags, such as those often used by department stores or as gift bags, can be made from any kind of paper, and come in any color. Paper bags can be made from recycled paper, with some local laws requiring bags to have a minimum percentage of post-consumer recycled content.\n\nPaper shopping bags, brown paper bags, grocery bags, paper bread bags and other light duty bags have a single layer of paper. A variety of constructions and designs are available. Many are printed with the names of stores and brands. Paper bags are not waterproof. Types of paper bag are: laminated, twisted, flat tap. The laminated bag, whilst not totally waterproof, has a laminate that protects the outside to some degree.\n\nMultiwall (or multi-wall) paper sacks or shipping sacks are often used as shipping containers for bulk materials such as fertilizer, animal feed, sand, dry chemicals, flour and cement. Many have several layers of sack papers, printed external layer and inner plies. Some paper sacks have a plastic film, foil, or polyethylene coated paper layer in between as a water-repellant, insect resistant, or rodent barrier.\n\nThere are two basic designs of bags: open mouth bags and valve bags. An open mouth bag is a tube of paper plies with the bottom end sealed. The bag is filled through the open mouth and then closed by stitching, adhesive, or tape. Valve sacks have both ends closed and are filled through a valve. A typical example of a valve bag is the cement sack.\n\nPaper bags are readily recyclable. Plastic or water-resistant coatings or layers make recycling more difficult. Paper bag recycling is done through the re-pulping of the paper recycling and pressing into the required shapes.\n\n\n"}

Both Benson and one of the gang pose as the elderly Pawnee—at one point the story has three old Indians.

Ferrovie dello Stato in Italy acquired four and designated them class 831.\n\nThe Oranje-Nassau Mijnen, a coal mining company in The Netherlands acquired two S100's (USATC 4389 and 1948)and numbered them ON-26 (Davenport 2533) and ON-27 (Davenport 2513) respectively. The ON-26 survived the scrapyard and was sold to the museum railway Stoomtrein Goes-Borsele.\n\nThe Southern Railway (GB) bought 15 S100's (14 for operational use and one for spare parts) and designated them USA Class. Other S100's entered British industrial use with the National Coal Board, Longmoor Military Railway, Austin Motor Company and others.\n\nChina acquired about 20 S100's, designating them class XK2. In 1946, Egyptian State Railways bought eight and numbered them 1151–1158. The UK War Department loaned six to Palestine Railways. In 1946 PR bought two of these, both of which subsequently entered the stock of Israel Railways in 1948.\n\nIraqi State Railways bought five, designated them Class SA, and gave them fleet numbers 1211–1215. All five were Davenport-built examples. At least two were still in service in March 1967: 1211 at Basrah and 1214 as the station pilot at Baghdad West.\n\nSeveral European railways produced designs based on the S100. JŽ added to their Class 62 by ordering several similar examples from Đuro Đaković (factory) of Slavonski Brod, Croatia. These differed in minor details, principally the use of plate frames instead of bar frames, resulting in a higher boiler pitch. This gives the steam pipes a shoulder instead of being straight, and requires smaller domes with a flatter top to fit JŽ's loading gauge.\n\nPoland built several TKh Ferrum Fablok TKh49 locomotives. These have a similar outline but include various differences such as the use of 2 domes instead of 3, driving onto the second axle instead of the third, a different cab, \"etc.\"\n\nThe British Great Western Railway (GWR) had used many S100s in South Wales during the Second World War. The GWR 1500 Class was partially inspired by the S100 in its use of outside cylinders and short wheelbase.\n\nA small number of former JŽ 62's remain in commercial service, more than 65 years after they were built. At least two work as switchers (shunters) at the ArcelorMittal steel plant in Zenica, Bosnia-Hercegovina.\n\nMore than 100 S100s survive: either preserved, stored or derelict. Most are in Europe or North America, but there are also two in China and one in Egypt. Project 62 has an online database of them.\n\nPrivate owners in Baraboo, Wisconsin, are currently restoring S100 #5002. #5002 was used for the Naval Yards in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and later sold to the EJ Lavino Company in Pennsylvania, then sold to the Kentucky Railroad Museum.\n\nAn engine of this prototype appears in the \"Thomas & Friends\" TV series as Rosie.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2086678", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2086678", "title": "Hess Corporation", "text": "Hess Corporation\n\nHess Corporation (formerly Amerada Hess Corporation) is an American global independent energy company engaged in the exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas. It was formed by the merger of Hess Oil and Chemical and Amerada Petroleum in 1968 led by Leon Hess. In 1995, his son John B Hess succeeded him as chairman and CEO. Hess, headquartered in New York City, placed #394 in the 2016 list of Fortune 500 corporations. In 2014, Hess completed a multi-year transformation to an exploration and production company by exiting all downstream operations, generating approximately $13 billion from assets sales beginning in 2013. Hess sold its gas station network to Marathon Petroleum (which operates under the retail brand Speedway); sold its wholesale and retail oil, natural gas and electricity marketing business to Direct Energy; closed its refineries in Port Reading NJ and St. Croix USVI (Hovensa JV with PDVSA); sold its bulk storage and terminalling business mostly to Buckeye Partners; and sold its 50% interests in two New Jersey power plants to their respective JV partners (Bayonne Energy Center: ArcLight Capital and Newark Energy Center: Ares EIF). Hess also sold its 50% interest in its JV commodities trading arm HETCO (Hess Energy Trading Company) to Oaktree Capital. HETCO is now known as Hartree Partners.\n\nThe company has exploration and production operations on-shore: United States and Libya and off-shore: United States (Gulf of Mexico), Canada, South America (Guyana & Suriname), Denmark and Southeast Asia (Malaysia and the Joint Development Area of Malaysia and Thailand).\n\nIn 1919, British oil entrepreneur Lord Cowdray formed Amerada Corporation to explore for oil in North America. The firm was incorporated February 7, 1920, in Delaware as a holding company for its principal subsidiary, the Amerada Petroleum Corporation. The oil producer experienced growth during most of the 1920s, hitting a peak in 1926 with a net income of US$4.9 million. However, in the years leading to the Great Depression, weakness in the oil markets contributed to sluggish profits. The aftermath of the market crash aggravated the unsteady oil industry. In the first quarter of 1930, the company experienced a minor loss. The early years of the Depression were a struggle against wavering demand and overproduction in some regions. Later into the 1930s, the financial forecast became more sanguine for Amerada.\n\nIn December 1941, the company reorganized by merging the holding company with the principal operating subsidiary, Amerada Petroleum Corporation, into a simplified operating company. The new entity also adopted the former subsidiary's name.\n\nRobust postwar growth rocketed the company past US$100 million in sales in 1955.\n\nHess Oil and Chemical, an oil refiner and marketer founded by Leon Hess, acquired 10% of the company for US$100 million in 1966 after the British government sold a stake it had amassed during World War II. Albert Levinson became the senior vice president and designed the Hess logo. Hess and Amerada would announce plans for a merger in December 1968. Some Amerada stockholders led by Morton Adler criticized the arrangement as being too favorable for Hess. Adler argued Amerada's oil reserves would contribute the lion's share of assets for the proposed company, so Amerada stockholders should retain more control of the new company. Before the stockholder vote on the matter, Phillips Petroleum, an integrated oil firm, approached Amerada with its own merger proposal, but the offer was declined in March. Still interested, Phillips nonetheless stated it would not carry out a proxy fight against the proposed Hess deal. Hess, fearing such a strategy, made a cash tender offer of US$140 million for an additional 1.1 million shares of Amerada, which would double its holding in the company. The new shares would be employed in a May stockholder vote deciding the merger's fate. The vote took place amidst shareholder rancor that in addition to echoing Adler's arguments, objected to Amerada's financing of the recently completed tender offer. Hess planned to cancel the shares and the cost of the acquisition would be absorbed by the newly formed company. One shareholder at the meeting quipped, \"It looks to me as if Hess is buying Amerada with Amerada's money.\" Proponents of the deal won, and the US$2.4 billion merger combining a purely production company with a refinery and marketer operation was completed. However controversy was not yet extinguished by the stockholder confirmation. A class action federal lawsuit in 1972 claiming the proxy vote information was misleading. In 1976, a court agreed that the company falsely claimed to have considered each company's assets as a reason for the merger.\n\nIn February 2000, Hess acquired the 51% shares of the Meadville Corporation it didn't already own, and rebranded all 178 Merit gas stations as Hess. The Merit gas station chain were primarily in the Boston, New York, and Philadelphia markets.\n\nIn 2001, Amerada Hess purchased Triton Energy Limited in a cash tender deal valued at approximately US$3.2 billion. Triton, one of the largest independent oil and natural gas exploration and production companies in the U.S., had earned a reputation as a maverick oil company due to its highly successful yet potentially risky overseas exploration. According to Amerada Hess press releases at the time, Triton's major oil and gas assets in West Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia would strengthen its exploration and production business and give it access to long life international reserves. Hess also stated that the purchase was expected to immediately increase the company's per-day barrel output by more than 25 percent.\n\nAlso in 2001, Amerada Hess entered into a joint venture with A.T. Williams Oil Co. of Winston-Salem, North Carolina. The company and its gas stations were called WilcoHess. Eventually, there were 1200 WilcoHess stations.\n\nFollowing on the heels of the Triton purchase, energy prices fell and global economies weakened. Amerada Hess struggled through the following years, posting a US$218 million loss in 2002 due primarily to a US$530 million charge relating to its write-down of the Ceiba oil field, but then posting steadily increasing profits from 2003 through 2006, when the company posted US$1.920 billion in net income.\n\nIn May 2006, Amerada Hess Corp. changed its name to Hess Corp.\n\nOn January 18, 2012 the company announced that it would close the Hovensa refinery in St. Croix, United States Virgin Islands by mid-February 2012. The refinery will then serve as a storage terminal\n\nHess will permanently close its Port Reading, New Jersey petroleum refinery by the end of February 2013: Gas prices rose to their highest levels since October and Hess said it will lay off 170 of 217 employees, exit the refinery business and seek a buyer for its 19 storage terminals. It will focus on exploration and production. A Hess press release announces the company's plans for \"Fully exiting the Company's downstream businesses, including retail, energy marketing, and energy trading.\" there is no link between the rise in gas prices after the announcement of the closing of the Woodbridge (Port Reading) NJ facility. The output of that facility was more geared to the aviation and specialty fuels markets and not automotive grade products\n\nOn March 4, 2013 Hess announced that it would sell its domestic refineries and retail operations. The \"New York Times\" also reported that Hess retail and refinery operations contributed about 4 percent of the company's revenue. It also noted that Hess will sell its holdings in Indonesia and Thailand. The company will focus exclusively on oil production, following a recent trend in the oil industry for companies to spin off their downstream assets and focus on their more profitable upstream business; ConocoPhillips and Marathon Oil have also made similar spinoffs in recent years with Phillips 66 and Marathon Petroleum, respectively.\n\nIn April 2013, Hess Corp announced it would be selling its Russian unit to Lukoil for $2.05 billion. In July 2013, Hess Corp said it would sell its energy marketing unit to UK firm Centrica for around $1.03 billion.\n\nHess Corp announced in October 2013 that it was planning on selling its East Coast and St.Lucia storage terminal network to Buckeye Partners LP for $850 million.\n\nHess Corp announced in December 2013 that it is selling its Indonesian assets to an Indonesian petroleum consortium.\n\nOn January 8, 2014, Hess filed for a tax-free spin-off of its gas station network. The newly formed company was to be known as Hess Retail and will include over 1,200 stores throughout the Eastern United States. Before completing the spin-off, Marathon Petroleum subsidiary Speedway LLC announced on May 22, 2014 that it would acquire the retail unit of Hess Corp for $2.87 billion. Following the closure of the acquisition in late 2014, all Hess gas stations will be rebranded as Speedway gas stations by the end of 2017. The transaction completed the transformation of Hess into an energy company focused solely on exploration and production, effectively reversing the Amerada merger almost 50 years prior.\n\n\"The New York Times\" reported on October 28, 1990, that a barge with a load of of kerosene struck a reef in the Hudson River, spilling of fuel. Immediately, Hess assumed responsibility for the cleanup; the Coast Guard worked alongside the Red Star company to clean and to contain the spill to one area. Coast Guard official Mr. Holmes said \"The weather and wind conditions are almost as close to perfect as they could get,\" and this contributed to a quicker and surer cleanup than could otherwise be. According to \"The New York Times\", Mr. Holmes also said that 70 percent of the spill would be gone in three days due to the natural evaporation rate of kerosene. Even though most kerosene evaporates, toxic chemicals such as benzene stay in the water and harm certain fish. Hess claims that their corporate policy has \"long stressed\" their \"fundamental commitment to comply with applicable environment, health and safety laws and regulations,\" and they claim to clean every spill made.\n\nIn accordance with a New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) agreement the Hess Corporation will pay $1.1 million in fines and also \"bring 65 gasoline stations and oil storage facilities into compliance with state requirements.\" The agreement addresses more than 100 violations at 65 gas stations and Hess's Brooklyn major oil storage facility. The agreement is aimed at resolving Hess's violations in the DEC's New York City and lower Hudson Valley regions.\n\nIn a recent water contamination case against several major US oil companies, the Hess Corporation will pay part of a $422 million settlement. The case was filed by 153 public water providers in 17 states against the oil companies \"over drinking water contamination caused by the gasoline additive Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (MTBE).\" The settlement also stipulates that the settling parties pay their share of treatment costs of the plaintiff's wells that may become contaminated or require treatment for the next 30 years.\n\nIn regard to greenhouse gas emissions, Hess outlined in their 2006 Corporate Sustainability Report a \"four element\" strategy to reduce and control emissions. The strategy's steps include monitoring, measuring, managing, and mitigating. Through reporting results, energy efficiency and recovery, and carbon capture and trading the company intends to improve its environmental impact.\n\nPrior to the March 4, 2013 announcement of its withdrawal from refining and retail sales of petroleum products, Hess operated gas stations in Alabama, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Indonesia, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia.\n\nIn May 2014, Speedway LLC, a subsidiary of Marathon Petroleum Company, announced they would purchase Hess Corporation's retail business for $2.6 billion. Hess had 1,342 locations along the Eastern United States. The conversion from Hess branding to Speedway branding took place over the course of 2015. Hess locations still remain in select states as of 2018, including Connecticut.\n\n"}

Scott Steiner was injured in June and the WCW World Tag Team Championship had become vacant because the Steiner Brothers (Scott and Rick Steiner) were not able to defend the title within the 30-day window. The Enforcers were entered into the tournament for the titles and made it to the finals against Rick Steiner and Bill Kazmaier at on September 5, 1991. The Enforcers were known for their dirty tactics and did not fail to deliver upon that at the Clash. They attacked Kazmaier with one of his weights during a power lifting demonstration at the beginning of the Clash. When the match came, they took advantage of his injured ribs and won the titles.\n\nThey then began a feud with Barry Windham and Dustin Rhodes and broke Windham's hand in an out of ring attack before Halloween Havoc started on October 27, 1991. Windham and Rhodes had just arrived for an interview in Windham's car and the Enforcers slammed his hand in his car door as he was getting out of the vehicle.\n\nThis injury came just before they were supposed to get their title match against the Enforcers at Clash of the Champions XVII on November 19, 1991. Nobody knew who Rhodes would get for a partner until just before the match when the returning Ricky Steamboat came out. The Enforcers lost the titles to them at the Clash.\n\nAfter this Clash, The Dangerous Alliance was formed, with Anderson and Zbyszko as members. New manager Paul E.

{"id": "2086690", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2086690", "title": "Tsakonian language", "text": "Tsakonian language\n\nTsakonian (also Tsaconian, Tzakonian or Tsakonic; Tsakonian: , ; Greek: ) is a modern Hellenic language which is both highly divergent from other spoken varieties of Modern Greek and, from a philological standpoint, linguistically classified separately from them. It is spoken in the Tsakonian region of the Peloponnese, Greece. Tsakonian descends from Doric, which was an Ancient Greek language on the Western branch of the Hellenic languages, and it is its only living descendant. Although Tsakonian is treated as a dialect of Modern Standard Greek, some compendia treat it as a separate language, since Modern Standard Greek descends from Ionic and Attic which are on the Eastern branch of the Hellenic languages, while Tsakonian (as a descendant of Doric) is the sole surviving member of the Western branch. \n\nTsakonian is critically endangered, with only a few hundred, mostly elderly, fluent speakers left. Tsakonian and Modern Greek are not mutually intelligible.\n\nIt is named after its speakers, the Tsakonians, which in turn may be derived from 'exo-Laconians' 'Outer Lakonians'.\n\nTsakonian is found today in a group of mountain towns and villages slightly inland from the Argolic Gulf, although it was once spoken farther to the south and west as well as on the coasts of Laconia (ancient Sparta). \n\nGeographical barriers to travel and communication kept the Tsakonians relatively isolated from the rest of Greece until the 19th century, although there was some trade between the coastal towns. The rise of mass education and improved travel beginning after the Greek War of Independence meant that fluent Tsakonian speakers were no longer as isolated from the rest of Greece. In addition, during the war, the Turkish army drove the Tsakonians east, and as a result, their de facto capital shifted from Prastos to Leonidio, further making the people significantly less isolated. There began a rapid decline from an estimated figure of some 200,000 fluent speakers to the present estimate of a speaker count between 200 and 1,000.\n\nSince the introduction of electricity to all villages in Tsakonia by the late 1950s, the Greek mass media can reach the most remote of areas and profoundly affect the speech of younger speakers. Efforts to revive the language by teaching it in local schools do not seem to have had much success. Standard Modern Greek is the official language of government, commerce and education, and it is possible that the continued modernization of Tsakonia will lead to the language's disappearance sometime this century.\n\nThe area where the language is found today in some villages Tsakonia slopes of Parnon in the southern province of Kynouria, including the towns of Leonidio and Tyros and villages of Melana, Agios Andreas, Vaskina, Prastos, Sitaina and Kastanitsa.\n\nTsakonian has no official status. Prayers and liturgies of the Greek Orthodox Church have been translated into Tsakonian, but the ancient Koine of the traditional church services is usually used as in other locations in Greece. Some teaching materials in Tsakonian for use in local schools have reportedly also been produced.\n\nThere are three dialects of Tsakonian: Northern, Southern, and Propontis. \n\nThe Propontis dialect was spoken in what was formerly a Tsakonian colony on the Sea of Marmara (or Propontis; two villages near Gönen, Vatika and Havoutsi), whose members were resettled in Greece with the 1924 population exchanges. Propontis Tsakonian appears to have died out around 1970, although it had already stopped being the primary language of its community after 1914 when they were internally exiled with other Greeks in the region due to the outbreak of World War I. Propontis Tsakonian was overall grammatically more conservative, but it was also influenced by the nearby Thracian dialects of Greek which were much closer to Standard Modern Greek. The emergence of the Propontis community is either dated to the 13th century settlement of Tsakonians by Emperor Michael VII, explicitly referenced by Byzantine George Pachymeres or around the time of the 1770 Orlov Revolt.\nFor an example of the standardizing Thracian Greek influence, compare the Northern and Southern word for water, \"ύο\" (\"ýo\", derived from Ancient Greek ) to Propontic \"νερέ\" and Standard \"νερό\" (\"neré\", \"neró\").\nOf the two mainland dialects of Tsakonian, Southern Tsakonian is spoken in the villages of Melana, Prastos, Tiros, Leonidio, Pramatefti and Sapunakeika, while Northern Tsakonian is found in Sitena and Kastanitsa. The Northern villages were much more exposed to the rest of Greek society, and as a result Northern Tsakonian experienced much heavier Standard Greek lexical and phonological influence, before it began to die out much faster than Southern Tsakonian. As early as 1971, it became difficult for researchers in the northern villages to find any informants who could offer more than \"a few isolated words\".\nThere may have once been a fourth, Western, dialect of Tsakonian given the forms attested by Evliya Celebi in the 17th century.\n\nAnother difference between Tsakonian and the common Demotic Greek dialect is its verb system – Tsakonian preserves different archaic forms, such as participial periphrasis for the present tense. Certain complementisers and other adverbial features present in the standard Modern Greek dialect are absent from Tsakonian, with the exception of the Modern \"που\" () relativiser, which takes the form \"πφη\" () in Tsakonian (note: traditional Tsakonian orthography uses the digraph \"πφ\" to represent aspirated ). Noun morphology is broadly similar to Standard Modern Greek, although Tsakonian tends to drop the nominative, final \"-ς\" (\"-s\") from masculine nouns, thus Tsakonian \"ο τσχίφτα\" for Standard \"o τρίφτης\" (\"o tshífta\"/\"o tríftis\": \"grater\").\n\nThere has always been contact with Koine Greek speakers and the language was affected by the neighboring Greek dialects. Additionally, there are some lexical borrowings from Arvanitika and Turkish. The core vocabulary remains recognizably Doric, although experts disagree on the extent to which other true Doricisms can be found. There are only a few hundred, mainly elderly true native speakers living, although a great many more can speak the language less than fluently.\n\n\nTsakonian in some words preserves the pre-classical Greek [w]-sound, represented in some Ancient Greek texts by the digamma \"(ϝ)\". In Tsakonian, this sound has become a fricative : \"βάννε\" \"sheep\", corresponding to Ancient \"ϝαμνός\" (Attic \"ἀμνός\").\n\nTsakonian has extensive changes triggered by palatalisation:\n\nWord-initial > : \"*ράφων\" > \"σχάφου\" \n\nWord-final > , which reflects an earlier process in Laconian; in Tsakonian, it is a liaison phoneme: \"τίνος\" > \"τσούνερ\" \n\nIn Southern Tsakonian, is deleted before back and central vowels: \"λόγος\" > Northern \"λόγo\" , Southern \"όγo\" ; \"λούζων\" > Northern \"λούκχου\" , Southern \"ούκχου\" ;\n\nOccasionally > , which appears to reflect an earlier process in Laconian, but in others is retained though the word is absent in Standard Greek: \"θυγάτηρ\" > \"σάτη\" , but Ancient \"θύων\" (Modern \"σφάζω\" ) > \"θύου\" \n\nTsakonian avoids clusters, and reduces them to aspirated or prenasalised stops and affricates:\n\nIn the common verb ending \"-ζω\", > : \"φωνάζων\" > \"φωνιάντου\" \n\n<poem>I had a bird in a cage and I kept it happy\nI gave it sugar and wine-grapes\nand from the great amount of grapes and their essence,\nit got naughty [possibly means it got drunk] and escaped.\nAnd its master now runs after it with the cage in his hands:\nCome my bird back where you belong, come to your house\nI will remove your old bells and buy you new ones.</poem>\n\nTsakonian avoids consonant clusters, as seen, and drops final [s] and [n]; as a result, syllable structure tends more to CV than in Standard Modern Greek. (The use of digraphs in tradition spelling tends to obscure this). For instances, ancient [hadros] \"hard\" goes to Tsakonian [a.tʃe], where /t͡ʃ/ can be considered a single phoneme; it is written traditionally with a trigraph as \"ατσχέ\" (= \"atskhe\").\n\nTsakonian has undergone considerable morphological changes: there is minimal case inflection.\n\nThe present and imperfect indicative in Tsakonian are formed with participles, like English but unlike the rest of Greek: Tsakonian \"ενεί αού, έμα αού\" \"I am saying, I was saying\" ≈ Greek \"ειμί λαλών, ήμην λαλών\".\nNote: Participles change according to the gender of the subject of the sentence\nTsakonian has preserved the original inflection of the aorist indicative.\n\nTraditionally, Tsakonian used the standard Greek alphabet, along with digraphs to represent certain sounds that either do not occur in Demotic Greek, or that do not commonly occur in combination with the same sounds as they do in Tsakonian. For example, the [ʃ] sound, which does not occur in standard Greek, does occur in Tsakonian, and is spelled \"σχ\" (much like German \"sch\"). Another sound recalls Czech \"ř\". Thanasis Costakis invented an orthography using dots, \"spiritus asper\", and caron for use in his works, which has been used in his grammar and several other works. This is more like the Czech usage of hačeks (such as \"š\"). Lastly, unpalatalized \"n\" and \"l\" before a front vowel can be written double, to contrast with a palatalised single letter. (e.g. in Southern Tsakonian \"ένει\" [eɲi] \"I am\", \"έννι\" [eni] \"he is\" – the latter corresponding to Northern Tsakonian \"έμι\" [emi] and Standard Greek \"είμαι\" [ime].)\n\n\n\n"}

Based on the 1985 novel \"My Love, My Love; or, The Peasant Girl\" by Rosa Guy, it is set in the French Antilles archipelago in the Caribbean Sea. It concerns a peasant girl on a tropical island, who uses the power of love to bring people together of different social classes.\n\nThe original Broadway production ran from 1990 to 1991, and the West End production opened in 1994, where it won the 1995 Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Musical. The musical was revived on Broadway in a production that opened on December 3, 2017 at the Circle in the Square Theatre.\n\n\"Once on This Island\" was originally staged at Off-Broadway's Playwrights Horizons, running from May 6, 1990 through May 27, 1990. The Broadway production opened on October 18, 1990 at the Booth Theatre and closed on December 1, 1991, after 469 performances and 19 previews. With direction and choreography by Graciela Daniele, the musical featured LaChanze as Ti Moune, Jerry Dixon as Daniel, Andrea Frierson as Erzulie, Sheila Gibbs as Mama Euralie, Kecia Lewis as Asaka, Gerry McIntyre as Armand, Milton Craig Nealy as Agwe, Eric Riley as Papa Ge, Ellis E. Williams as Tonton Julian and Afi McClendon as Little Ti Moune. In 2002, the original Broadway cast was reunited with special guest Lillias White to perform the show for Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS and the Cantor Fitzgerald Relief Fund.\n\nThe European premiere took place in 1994, hosted by the Birmingham Rep, and then transferred to the West End Royalty Theatre (now the Peacock Theatre) in September 1994. The production won the Olivier Award for Best New Musical.\nThe musical was revived in the UK in 2009 at Birmingham Rep, Nottingham Playhouse, and the Hackney Empire Theatre in London. Susie McKenna directed, with Sharon D. Clarke reprising her 1994 role as Asaka. The original West End Ti Moune, Lorna Brown, played Erzulie in this production.\nIn June 2012, the Paper Mill Playhouse presented a production directed by Thomas Kail, with Syesha Mercado as Ti Moune and Darius de Haas as Agwe. \n\nThe first Broadway revival of \"Once on This Island\", produced by Ken Davenport, directed by Michael Arden and choreographed by Camille A. Brown, began previews on November 9, 2017 and officially opened on December 3 at the Circle in the Square Theatre. This production featured a stage covered in sand, with live animals onstage, and set and costume design intended to suggest a wrecked beach community recovering from a hurricane. The opening night cast included Hailey Kilgore as Ti Moune, Isaac Powell as Daniel, Alysha Deslorieux as Andrea, Phillip Boykin as Tonton Julian, Kenita R. Miller as Mama Euralie, Alex Newell as Asaka, Merle Dandridge as Papa Ge, Quentin Earl Darrington as Agwe, Lea Salonga as Erzulie and David Jennings as Armand. The revival closed on January 6, 2019, after 458 regular performances.\n\nThe Broadway revival production tour in North America starting at The Carson Center, Paducah, Kentucky on October 12, 2019,\nwith the official opening on October 15 at the Tennessee Performing Arts Center, Nashville, Tennessee. The tour is directed by Michael Arden with choreography by Camille A. Brown. The tour featured onstage seating, \"creating a unique experience within the footprint of every theatre we play... Audiences will be invited to put their feet in the sand and surround our company, becoming part of the show.\" The tour ended early due to the COVID-19 pandemic at the Smith Center in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nOne stormy night in the Antilles archipelago, thunder booms, making a small girl cry in fear. To comfort her, the village storytellers tell her the story of Ti Moune, a peasant girl who falls in love with a \"grand homme\", Daniel Beauxhomme – a story of life, pain, love, grief, faith, and hope. In this story, four gods (consisting of Asaka: Mother of the Earth, Agwé: god of Water, Erzulie: goddess of Love, and Papa Ge: demon of Death) rule an island known as the Jewel of the Antilles where poor peasants worship them (Prologue/\"We Dance\"). The peasants, \"black as night\", live on one side of the island, and the \"grands hommes\", lighter-skinned descendants of the original French planters and their slaves, live on the other. One night, Agwe unleashes a terrible storm upon the island, which in turn causes a disastrous flood, wiping out many villages. However, the gods save the life of a little orphan named Ti Moune by placing her in a tree above the flood's waves. She is found and subsequently adopted by the peasants Mama Euralie and Tonton Julian (\"One Small Girl\").\n\nYears afterwards, a grown-up Ti Moune prays to the gods to let her know her purpose, and to let her be like the fast-driving strangers on the roads near her village - the \"grands hommes\" (\"Waiting for Life\"). Hearing her plea, the gods laugh at her. However, Erzulie suggests that they give her love, because it is stronger than any of the other elements. Offended, Papa Ge proposes a bet to prove which is stronger: love or death. Agwe arranges for the car of Daniel Beauxhomme, a young \"grande homme\", to crash during a storm so that Ti Moune may meet Daniel and restore him to health (\"And The Gods Heard Her Prayer/Rain\"). Despite the objections of the other peasants including her own parents, Ti Moune helps the intruder recover (\"Pray\"). Ti Moune falls in love with the stranger and as she cares for the unconscious boy, she imagines he loves her too. When Papa Ge comes to take Daniel's life, Ti Moune offers her life in exchange for Daniel's so that he will not die (\"Forever Yours\"). Papa Ge is angry but leaves, hinting he will return – sooner or later, as her life now belongs to him.\n\nTonton Julian travels to the other side of the Island to seek Daniel's family at the Hotel Beauxhomme. When he returns, he brings with him some of Daniel's people to take the boy back, as well as the story of Daniel's family: Four generations ago, during the Napoleonic era, a French aristocrat named Armand colonised the island. Although Armand had a wife, he had affairs with several natives, one of which bore him a son, named Beauxhomme. When Beauxhomme grew up, war broke out between the peasant locals and the French. The peasants won the war with Beauxhomme's help, after which he banished Armand back to France. Before leaving, however, Armand cursed Beauxhomme and his descendants saying their \"black blood will keep them forever on the island, while their hearts yearn forever for France.\" To this day the curse causes future Beauxhommes to alienate the peasants for reminding them of their homeland (\"The Sad Tale of the Beauxhommes\"). Ti Moune is tearfully separated from Daniel and tells her parents that she will go after Daniel to marry him, and though they are reluctant to let her go, they eventually give her their blessing (\"Ti Moune\"). The goddess Asaka tells Ti Moune not to fear, as the Earth will give her everything she needs on her journey to Daniel (\"Mama Will Provide\").\n\nTi Moune travels across the island (\"Waiting For Life (Reprise)\"), and the storytellers relate the many versions of her difficult journey to the city (including being forced to wear too-tight shoes), through the hotel gates and finding Daniel's room (\"Some Say\"). Daniel, still ill and unable to walk, does not remember her but believes her after she describes the scar on his chest. As they stay together, Erzulie gives them the gift of love (\"Human Heart\"). Daniel ignores the townspeople's gossiping (\"Pray (Reprise)\") over the unlikely relationship between a rich Beauxhomme and a poor peasant. Daniel delights in Ti Moune's differences from the rich girls in his life, noting that \"some girls you marry, some you love\" (\"Some Girls\").\n\nAt a ball held at the hotel (\"The Ball\"), Andrea Devereaux, a daughter of Daniel's family friends, cajoles Ti Moune to dance for them (her ulterior motive being to make her look bad in front of the \"grande hommes\"). Ti Moune does dance and gains the admiration of the rich society members, inspiring both the peasant servants and the \"grande homme\" guests to join her (\"Ti Moune's Dance\"). Afterwards, Ti Moune learns that Daniel is already engaged to be married to Andrea (\"When We Are Wed\"). Daniel, reminded of his responsibilities, must go through with the arranged marriage, although he insists they can be lovers forever, leaving Ti Moune crushed. Papa Ge reappears and reminds Ti Moune of her promise to exchange her life for Daniel's – but says she can revoke the bargain if she kills Daniel (\"Promises/Forever Yours (Reprise)\"). Ti Moune enters Daniel's room with a knife, but she still loves him too much to kill him, proving love is stronger than death. However, Daniel finds Ti Moune with the knife. Appalled at the attempted murder, the Beauxhommes throw her out of the hotel grounds.\n\nBarred from the hotel, Ti Moune waits for two weeks to try and meet Daniel at the gate. As Daniel and Andrea are married, they follow an old tradition of throwing coins to the peasants outside the hotel gates. Ti Moune calls to Daniel who gently places a silver coin in Ti Moune's hand, kisses her cheek, and leaves. The storytellers tell of how the gods were moved to tears by Ti Moune's selflessness and love, and chose to bestow a final kindness on her; Erzulie took her by the hand and led her to the ocean, where Agwé allowed her to drown peacefully. Papa Ge received her gently and brought her back to shore where Asaka transformed her into a tree (\"A Part Of Us\").\n\nThe tree becomes a celebration of life and love that cracks open the gates of the hotel, allowing those of all social statuses to become one, including a peasant girl and a young \"grande homme\", Daniel's son, as they play in her branches. As the years go by, the story of Ti Moune is told again and again, passed down through generations as proof of the power of love and stories to bring people together. As the musical ends, the little girl who was frightened by the storm begins to retell the story herself (\"Why We Tell The Story\").\n\n\nNote: The original cast was chosen along racial lines with darker-skinned actors portraying the peasants and lighter-skinned actors portraying the upper-class landowners. In the script, the writers provide small line changes that can be used to remove references to skin color to accommodate multi-ethnic productions, while preserving the storyline about differences between the upper and lower classes.\n\nNotable replacements in the original Broadway cast\n\nNotable replacements in the 2017 Broadway revival cast\n\nCut songs include \"Come Down From the Tree\" and \"When Daniel Marries\". \"Come Down From the Tree\", was a song for Mama Euralie; it is included in several recordings, including its first recording on Bruce Kimmel's Lost in Boston CD, where it was sung by Lillias White - it was also included on Audra McDonald's \"How Glory Goes\".\n\n"}

The paper began in the 19th century as the \"Leicester Daily Mercury\" and later changed to the present title.\n\nThe paper was founded by James Thompson, already proprietor of the \"Leicester Chronicle\" which he had merged with the \"Leicestershire Mercury\" ten years earlier. The \"Leicester Daily Mercury\" would be an evening paper, the first to be published in Leicester, and give extra support to the Liberal Party in the forthcoming general election. The first issue was published on 31 January 1874 from the paper's offices at 3 St Martin's, consisting of four pages of five columns each. The paper had a staff of 25 and a circulation of 5000.\n\nAlong with the rest of Britain's regional daily press, the \"Leicester Mercury\" has struggled in circulation terms over the past two decades. The paper had an average circulation of 69,069 per day in the first half of 2008, down from 73,634 per day the previous year. This represents a year-on-year decline of some 5.7% and a drop of 47% when compared with a sale of 139,357 copies in the equivalent audit period for 1989.\n\nThe newspaper is the sixth largest-selling regional title in England. In 2001, after a re-design and relaunch, it was named Regional Newspaper of the Year. In 2006 the paper attempted to reduce costs by ceasing publication of its localised weekday editions for Loughborough, Hinckley, North West Leicestershire, Melton Mowbray and Market Harborough. They have been replaced with two general editions, covering the east and west of Leicestershire respectively. There are however still two editions published daily to cover the city of Leicester itself. The \"Mercury\" has retained its reporting staff in each of the market towns, despite substantial editorial staff cuts in other areas - achieved through non-replacement of departing staff. The company also closed its \"Sports Mercury\" edition due to declining readership, and the fact ABC rules no longer permitted the paper to include the sport paper's sales within the circulation figure for the main daily editions. In addition, the paper relaunched its \"Sporting Blue\" sports newspaper with tête-bêche binding to cover the city's two major sports teams; Leicester City and Leicester Tigers.\n\nFrom January 2010 to September 2011 the paper also championed its own youth paper: The Leicester WAVE which appeared as a supplement on the last Wednesday of every month. Its content was entirely written by people under the age of 25, often taking unique angles on some of the Mercury's hard hitting stories by illustrating how they would affect young people. During 2011 it was edited by Sam Newton.\n\nSince June 2016 the paper has been edited by George Oliver, who took over the editorship following the resignation of Kevin Booth for personal reasons earlier in the year.\n\nThe newspaper's headquarters underwent a complete external transformation, at a reported cost of £12.5m, and has now reopened to the general public. The new-look building is in keeping with the city's plans for an \"office core\" close to the \"Mercury\"'s head office. However, in April 2009, some of the back-end production work was moved to a hub in Nottingham which also carries out work for the Nottingham Post and the Derby Telegraph. However, about 60 journalists remain in the main Leicester office. In 2016 it was reported that Trinity Mirror had put the third floor of the paper's iconic building up for let and that consequently in 2017 all of the papers journalists would be moved to a new office. All of the newspaper's reporters remain in Leicester or other Leicestershire towns, as do the sports writers, photographers and feature writers, along with the proofing function.\n\nThe offices were moved to New Walk from Mercury Place in March 2017. https://www.holdthefrontpage.co.uk/2017/news/regional-daily-set-to-move-into-new-city-centre-office/\n\nIn December 2006, it was reported that 79% of the \"Mercury\"'s workforce had voted in favour of National Union of Journalists recognition, the paper being only the second Northcliffe Newspapers chapel to win union representation.\n\nIn 2012, Local World acquired Northcliffe Media from Daily Mail and General Trust.

He redshirted in 1998, and then appeared in five games as a freshman in 1999. As a sophomore, Banta-Cain recorded 35 tackles and 5.5 sacks, and as a junior in 2001, he started every game at defensive end and tallied eight sacks and 33 tackles. As a senior in 2002, Banta-Cain was named to the All-Pac-10 first team and was the team's Defensive Most Valuable Player, finishing with 39 tackles, 13 sacks, and 22 tackles for a loss. His 26.5 career sacks ranked third in the school's record books behind Regan Upshaw and Andre Carter.\n\nWhile at Berkeley, Banta-Cain was a member of the Sigma Phi Society of the Thorsen House.\n\nBanta-Cain was drafted by the New England Patriots in the seventh round (239th overall) in the 2003 NFL Draft. In his rookie season, he played in nine games recording 11 tackles and one sack against the Buffalo Bills on December 27. In 2004, he played in all 16 games and finished the season with 28 tackles, 1.5 sacks and his first career interception again against the Buffalo Bills on November 14. He also was part of the Super Bowl XXXVIII winning team. The following season, he only managed to record nine tackles and 0.5 sacks but again was part of the team which won Super Bowl XXXIX. In his final year with the Patriots, he played in all 16 games including five starts and finished the season with 43 tackles and a career-high 5.5 sacks.\n\nBanta-Cain was signed to a 3-year $12 million deal by the San Francisco 49ers as an unrestricted free agent on March 3, 2007. In his debut season, Banta-Cain started in four consecutive games until suffering a high ankle sprain during the 2nd quarter of a close 9–7 loss to the Baltimore Ravens. However, Banta-Cain continued to play due to a timely bye week following the injury, allowing him to not miss a game and still record a career-high 61 tackles and 3.5 sack on the year. He also scored the game-winning touchdown, in a November 25, 2007 game against the Arizona Cardinals, by recovering a fumble in the endzone in overtime. The win snapped an eight-game losing streak. He ended the year with ten starts and the 49ers ended the season with a 5–11 record. In his second season with the 49ers, Banta-Cain was inactive for the first four games of the season under Mike Nolan then activated to start on sub packages and special teams against the New England Patriots recording a half a sack and 5 tackles. Banta-Cain did not play another defensive snap for the season; however, he did manage to lead the team with 20 Special Teams tackles on a 6th ranked Special Teams unit coached by Al Everest (now with the Pittsburgh Steelers). The team finished with a 7–9 record. He was released under Mike Singletary on February 10, 2009.\n\nJust eight days after his release from the 49ers, Banta-Cain was re-signed by the New England Patriots on February 18, 2009. Banta-Cain was released on October 19 and reportedly re-signed the next day to a new contract through the 2011 season. However, the signing was not official as of the end of the regular season. He started 10 of the 16 games he played in 2009, recording 55 tackles and a career-high 10 sacks.\n\nBanta-Cain was officially re-signed to a three-year contract on March 5, 2010, the first day of free agency. The deal included a $6 million signing bonus, and averages $4.5 million per year. However, that yearly average can be raised to as high as $6 million if all performance incentives are met, raising the maximum value of the 3-year deal to $19 million.\n\nIn Week 2 of the 2010 season, Banta-Cain started against the New York Jets, recording eight tackles and one sack in the Patriots loss. In the second quarter, Banta-Cain was penalized 15 yards for unnecessary roughness, and was pulled from the game in favor of rookie Jermaine Cunningham, who replaced Banta-Cain as a starter in the Patriots' base defense for the next game. Banta-Cain went on to make 6 starts in 15 games played, recording 45 tackles and five sacks.\n\nOn July 29, 2011, it was announced that Banta-Cain had been released by the New England Patriots.\n"}

Tepper, published in 1988. It describes a world set three hundred years into the future after a catastrophic war which has fractured the United States into several nations. \n\nThe story is set in \"Women's Country\", apparently in the former Pacific Northwest. They have evolved in the direction of Ecotopia, reverting to a sustainable economy based on small cities and low-tech local agriculture. They have also developed a matriarchy where the women and children live within town walls with a small number of male servitors, and most of the men live outside the town in warrior camps.\n\n\"The Gate to Women's Country\" is set in the future, 300 years after a nuclear war destroyed most of human civilization. The book focuses on a matriarchal nation known as \"Women's Country\", and particularly the city of Marthatown.\n\nStavia, the novel's hero, is the younger daughter of Morgot, an important member of the Marthatown Council. The book opens with Stavia as an adult, heading to meet her fifteen-year-old son, Dawid. He has spent the last ten years living outside the city walls with the warriors, as is customary for Women's Country boys, and is now old enough to decide whether he wishes to remain a warrior or accept a life of study and service among the women as a servitor. At the meeting Dawid formally renounces his mother and chooses to become a full-fledged warrior. Stavia also renounces Dawid.\n\nAfterwards, Stavia remembers when her younger brother was sent to live with the warriors. Much of the rest of the novel is told in flashback, following Stavia's life from childhood to adulthood. In the story's present, Stavia prepares for her role as Iphigenia in Marthatown's annual performance of \"Iphigenia at Ilium\", a reworking of the Greek tragedy \"The Trojan Women\" that weaves through the novel as a leitmotif.\n\nWhile still a child, Stavia met Chernon, the son of one of her mother's friends. Although Chernon lives in the garrison with the other boys and men, he and Stavia form a friendship. They meet at the twice-annual Carnival, the only event in Women's Country where warriors and women can mix freely and during which time boys who have not yet chosen to become warriors can visit their families. Stavia eventually agrees to smuggle books to Chernon for him to read, even though this is forbidden for boys in the garrison.\n\nIn fact, Chernon has been ordered by his commander, Michael, to learn more about the secrets of the women who rule Women's Country. After confessing to breaking the ordinances, Stavia is sent away from Marthatown for several years to train as a doctor. On her return, Chernon pursues their relationship again. When Stavia is selected for an exploration mission to the south, Chernon leaves the garrison (on Michael's orders) meets her there and rapes her.\n\nWhile away from Women's Country, Stavia and Chernon are captured by a band of \"Holylanders\", members of a struggling community to the south of Women's Country. They practice polygamy and a fundamentalist patriarchy with Christian underpinnings. The Holylanders are brutally misogynistic, treating women as slaves to their husbands, and children (both sons and daughters) are subject to severe corporal punishment which they term 'chastisement'. Chernon betrays Stavia after their capture, during which time she realizes she is pregnant by Chernon. She makes an escape attempt, and is struck a blow to the head and incapacitated.\n\nUpon her return to Women's Country, she finally learns the secrets of the Women's Country Council and the choices they have made to preserve their way of life. The secret of Women's Country is that the council has been engaged in a selective breeding program with the population, using select servitors to propagate desirable traits through artificial insemination amongst select women; additionally selective sterilization has been used among the women. Chernon also is changed by his experiences, and returns to his garrison promoting the ways of the Holylanders as an alternative to their current societal structure. The Marthatown garrison is soon sent to battle against another Women's Country city, and no survivors return.\n\nThe story explores many elements from ecofeminism, which has been a hallmark of much of Tepper's writing, both in her feminist science fiction and in her pseudonymous mysteries.\n\nThe question of the causes of human violence is also a major theme, and in the novel Stavia's society hopes they are successfully breeding violence out of humanity. In the novel, violence appears to be biologically determined. By selecting only nonviolent individuals to breed, society is slowly increasing the number of such nonviolent members.\n\nTepper is careful to demonstrate that it is only unreasoning violence, not the ability to learn to fight and defend oneself and others, that is being bred out. For instance, she shows the servitor Joshua and Morgot as skilled fighters -- so skilled they are able to defeat the men who have trained as fighters their entire lives. So it is clear that it is only certain personality traits--violence, especially in men--that is being weeded out. Women are also given hysterectomies and tubal ligations at the discretion of the medical officers.\n\nThe biological determinism of Tepper's world also controls sexuality, and the novel constructs homosexuality as a genetic and hormonal disorder which has been eugenically removed from the population. Jane Donawerth, applauding the depth and richness of Tepper's exploration of this theme, describes Tepper's approach as a \"chillingly homophobic solution\". Tepper thus illustrates a world approaching a feminist utopia through the vision of a powerful leadership who impose rigid behavioral control on their society, and engineer the removal of those traits they consider undesirable (mainly violence) through forced sterilization. Their world remains vulnerable to ideological attack, as can be seen by the plots of the garrisons to take over the women's cities every generation and to force the women to serve them, as well as in Chernon's susceptibility to the violently misogynist ideology of the Holylanders. However, the Council's decision to interfere with its citizens' reproduction, without their consent or knowledge, is shown as a serious ethical issue -- a \"damned\" choice as described by one of the leaders.\n\n"}

They formalise the various situations in geometry and algebra in which \"inverse images\" (or \"pull-backs\") of objects such as vector bundles can be defined. As an example, for each topological space there is the category of vector bundles on the space, and for every continuous map from a topological space \"X\" to another topological space \"Y\" is associated the pullback functor taking bundles on \"Y\" to bundles on \"X\". Fibred categories formalise the system consisting of these categories and inverse image functors. Similar setups appear in various guises in mathematics, in particular in algebraic geometry, which is the context in which fibred categories originally appeared. Fibered categories are used to define stacks, which are fibered categories (over a site) with \"descent\". Fibrations also play an important role in categorical semantics of type theory, and in particular that of dependent type theories.\n\nFibred categories were introduced by , and developed in more detail by .\n\nThere are many examples in topology and geometry where some types of objects are considered to exist \"on\" or \"above\" or \"over\" some underlying \"base space\". The classical examples include vector bundles, principal bundles, and sheaves over topological spaces. Another example is given by \"families\" of algebraic varieties parametrised by another variety. Typical to these situations is that to a suitable type of a map \"f\": \"X\" → \"Y\" between base spaces, there is a corresponding \"inverse image\" (also called \"pull-back\") operation \"f\" taking the considered objects defined on \"Y\" to the same type of objects on \"X\". This is indeed the case in the examples above: for example, the inverse image of a vector bundle \"E\" on \"Y\" is a vector bundle \"f\"(\"E\") on \"X\".\n\nMoreover, it is often the case that the considered \"objects on a base space\" form a category, or in other words have maps (morphisms) between them. In such cases the inverse image operation is often compatible with composition of these maps between objects, or in more technical terms is a functor. Again, this is the case in examples listed above.\n\nHowever, it is often the case that if \"g\": \"Y\" → \"Z\" is another map, the inverse image functors are not \"strictly\" compatible with composed maps: if \"z\" is an object \"over\" \"Z\" (a vector bundle, say), it may well be that\n\nInstead, these inverse images are only naturally isomorphic. This introduction of some \"slack\" in the system of inverse images causes some delicate issues to appear, and it is this set-up that fibred categories formalise.\n\nThe main application of fibred categories is in descent theory, concerned with a vast generalisation of \"glueing\" techniques used in topology. In order to support descent theory of sufficient generality to be applied in non-trivial situations in algebraic geometry the definition of fibred categories is quite general and abstract. However, the underlying intuition is quite straightforward when keeping in mind the basic examples discussed above.\n\nThere are two essentially equivalent technical definitions of fibred categories, both of which will be described below. All discussion in this section ignores the set-theoretical issues related to \"large\" categories. The discussion can be made completely rigorous by, for example, restricting attention to small categories or by using universes.\n\nIf φ: \"F\" → \"E\" is a functor between two categories and \"S\" is an object of \"E\", then the subcategory of \"F\" consisting of those objects \"x\" for which φ(\"x\")=\"S\" and those morphisms \"m\" satisfying φ(\"m\")=id, is called the \"fibre category\" (or \"fibre\") \"over S\", and is denoted \"F\". The morphisms of \"F\" are called \"S-morphisms\", and for \"x\",\"y\" objects of \"F\", the set of \"S\"-morphisms is denoted by Hom(\"x\",\"y\"). The image by φ of an object or a morphism in \"F\" is called its \"projection\" (by φ). If f is a morphism of \"E\", then those morphisms of \"F\" that project to \"f\" are called \"f-morphisms\", and the set of \"f\"-morphisms between objects \"x\" and \"y\" in \"F\" is denoted by Hom(\"x\",\"y\"). \n\nA morphism \"m\": \"x\" → \"y\" in \"F\" is called \"φ-cartesian\" (or simply \"cartesian\") if it satisfies the following condition:\nA cartesian morphism \"m\": \"x\" → \"y\" is called an \"inverse image\" of its projection \"f\" = φ(\"m\"); the object \"x\" is called an \"inverse image\" of \"y\" \"by f\".\n\nThe cartesian morphisms of a fibre category \"F\" are precisely the isomorphisms of \"F\". There can in general be more than one cartesian morphism projecting to a given morphism \"f\": \"T\" → \"S\", possibly having different sources; thus there can be more than one inverse image of a given object \"y\" in \"F\" by \"f\". However, it is a direct consequence of the definition that two such inverse images are isomorphic in \"F\".\n\nA functor φ: \"F\" → \"E\" is also called an \"E-category\", or said to make \"F\" into an \"E\"-category or a category \"over\" \"E\". An \"E\"-functor from an \"E\"-category φ: \"F\" → \"E\" to an \"E\"-category ψ: \"G\" → \"E\" is a functor α: \"F\" → \"G\" such that ψ ∘ α = φ. \"E\"-categories form in a natural manner a 2-category, with 1-morphisms being \"E\"-functors, and 2-morphisms being natural transformations between \"E\"-functors whose components lie in some fibre.\n\nAn \"E\"-functor between two \"E\"-categories is called a \"cartesian functor\" if it takes cartesian morphisms to cartesian morphisms. Cartesian functors between two \"E\"-categories \"F\",\"G\" form a category Cart(\"F\",\"G\"), with natural transformations as morphisms. A special case is provided by considering \"E\" as an \"E\"-category via the identity functor: then a cartesian functor from \"E\" to an \"E\"-category \"F\" is called a \"cartesian section\". Thus a cartesian section consists of a choice of one object \"x\" in \"F\" for each object \"S\" in \"E\", and for each morphism \"f\": \"T\" → \"S\" a choice of an inverse image \"m\": \"x\" → \"x\". A cartesian section is thus a (strictly) compatible system of inverse images over objects of \"E\". The category of cartesian sections of \"F\" is denoted by\n\nIn the important case where \"E\" has a terminal object \"e\" (thus in particular when \"E\" is a topos or the category \"E\" of arrows with target \"S\" in \"E\") the functor\n\nis fully faithful (Lemma 5.7 of Giraud (1964)).\n\nThe technically most flexible and economical definition of fibred categories is based on the concept of cartesian morphisms. It is equivalent to a definition in terms of \"cleavages\", the latter definition being actually the original one presented in Grothendieck (1959); the definition in terms of cartesian morphisms was introduced in Grothendieck (1971) in 1960–1961.\n\nAn \"E\" category φ: \"F\" → \"E\" is a \"fibred category\" (or a \"fibred E-category\", or a \"category fibred over E\") if each morphism \"f\" of \"E\" whose codomain is in the range of projection has at least one inverse image, and moreover the composition \"m ∘ n\" of any two cartesian morphisms \"m\",\"n\" in \"F\" is always cartesian. In other words, an \"E\"-category is a fibred category if inverse images always exist (for morphisms whose codomains are in the range of projection) and are \"transitive\".\n\nIf \"E\" has a terminal object \"e\" and if \"F\" is fibred over \"E\", then the functor ε from cartesian sections to \"F\" defined at the end of the previous section is an equivalence of categories and moreover surjective on objects.\n\nIf \"F\" is a fibred \"E\"-category, it is always possible, for each morphism \"f\": \"T\" → \"S\" in \"E\" and each object \"y\" in \"F\", to choose (by using the axiom of choice) precisely one inverse image \"m\": \"x\" → \"y\". The class of morphisms thus selected is called a \"cleavage\" and the selected morphisms are called the \"transport morphisms\" (of the cleavage). A fibred category together with a cleavage is called a \"cloven category\". A cleavage is called \"normalised\" if the transport morphisms include all identities in \"F\"; this means that the inverse images of identity morphisms are chosen to be identity morphisms. Evidently if a cleavage exists, it can be chosen to be normalised; we shall consider only normalised cleavages below.\n\nThe choice of a (normalised) cleavage for a fibred \"E\"-category \"F\" specifies, for each morphism \"f\": \"T\" → \"S\" in \"E\", a \"functor\" \"f\": \"F\" → \"F\": on objects \"f\" is simply the inverse image by the corresponding transport morphism, and on morphisms it is defined in a natural manner by the defining universal property of cartesian morphisms. The operation which associates to an object \"S\" of \"E\" the fibre category \"F\" and to a morphism \"f\" the \"inverse image functor\" \"f\" is \"almost\" a contravariant functor from \"E\" to the category of categories. However, in general it fails to commute strictly with composition of morphisms. Instead, if \"f\": \"T\" → \"S\" and \"g\": \"U\" → \"T\" are morphisms in \"E\", then there is an isomorphism of functors\nThese isomorphisms satisfy the following two compatibilities:\nIt can be shown (see Grothendieck (1971) section 8) that, inversely, any collection of functors \"f\": \"F\" → \"F\" together with isomorphisms \"c\" satisfying the compatibilities above, defines a cloven category. These collections of inverse image functors provide a more intuitive view on fibred categories; and indeed, it was in terms of such compatible inverse image functors that fibred categories were introduced in Grothendieck (1959).\n\nThe paper by Gray referred to below makes analogies between these ideas and the notion of fibration of spaces.\n\nThese ideas simplify in the case of groupoids, as shown in the paper of Brown referred to below, which obtains a useful family of exact sequences from a fibration of groupoids.\n\nA (normalised) cleavage such that the composition of two transport morphisms is always a transport morphism is called a \"splitting\", and a fibred category with a splitting is called a \"split\" (fibred) \"category\". In terms of inverse image functors the condition of being a splitting means that the composition of inverse image functors corresponding to composable morphisms \"f,g\" in \"E\" \"equals\" the inverse image functor corresponding to \"f ∘ g\". In other words, the compatibility isomorphisms \"c\" of the previous section are all identities for a split category. Thus split \"E\"-categories correspond exactly to true functors from \"E\" to the category of categories.\n\nUnlike cleavages, not all fibred categories admit splittings. For an example, see below.\n\nOne can invert the direction of arrows in the definitions above to arrive at corresponding concepts of co-cartesian morphisms, co-fibred categories and split co-fibred categories (or co-split categories). More precisely, if φ: \"F\" →\"E\" is a functor, then a morphism \"m\": \"x\" → \"y\" in \"F\" is called \"co-cartesian\" if it is cartesian for the opposite functor φ: \"F\" → \"E\". Then \"m\" is also called a \"direct image\" and \"y\" a direct image of \"x\" for \"f\" = φ(\"m\"). A \"co-fibred\" \"E\"-category is an\"E\"-category such that direct image exists for each morphism in \"E\" and that the composition of direct images is a direct image. A \"co-cleavage\" and a \"co-splitting\" are defined similarly, corresponding to \"direct image functors\" instead of inverse image functors.\n\nThe categories fibred over a fixed category \"E\" form a 2-category Fib(\"E\"), where the \"category\" of morphisms between two fibred categories \"F\" and \"G\" is defined to be the category Cart(\"F\",\"G\") of cartesian functors from \"F\" to \"G\".\n\nSimilarly the split categories over \"E\" form a 2-category Scin(\"E\") (from French \"catégorie scindée\"), where the category of morphisms between two split categories \"F\" and \"G\" is the full sub-category Scin(\"F\",\"G\") of \"E\"-functors from \"F\" to \"G\" consisting of those functors that transform each transport morphism of \"F\" into a transport morphism of \"G\". Each such \"morphism of split E-categories\" is also a morphism of \"E\"-fibred categories, i.e., Scin(\"F\",\"G\") ⊂ Cart(\"F\",\"G\").\n\nThere is a natural forgetful 2-functor \"i\": Scin(\"E\") → Fib(\"E\") that simply forgets the splitting.\n\nWhile not all fibred categories admit a splitting, each fibred category is in fact \"equivalent\" to a split category. Indeed, there are two canonical ways to construct an equivalent split category for a given fibred category \"F\" over \"E\". More precisely, the forgetful 2-functor \"i\": Scin(\"E\") → Fib(\"E\") admits a right 2-adjoint \"S\" and a left 2-adjoint \"L\" (Theorems 2.4.2 and 2.4.4 of Giraud 1971), and \"S\"(\"F\") and \"L\"(\"F\") are the two associated split categories. The adjunction functors \"S\"(\"F\") → \"F\" and \"F\" → \"L\"(\"F\") are both cartesian and equivalences (\"ibid\".). However, while their composition \"S\"(\"F\") → \"L\"(\"F\") is an equivalence (of categories, and indeed of fibred categories), it is \"not\" in general a morphism of split categories. Thus the two constructions differ in general. The two preceding constructions of split categories are used in a critical way in the construction of the stack associated to a fibred category (and in particular stack associated to a pre-stack).\n\nThere is a related construction to fibered categories called catagories fibered in groupoids. These are fibered categories formula_9 such that any subcategory of formula_10 given by\n\n\nis a groupoid denoted formula_16. The associated 2-functors from the Grothendieck construction are examples of stacks. In short, the associated functor formula_17 sends an object formula_18 to the category formula_16, and a morphism formula_20 induces a functor from the fibered category structure. Namely, for an object formula_21 considered as an object of formula_10, there is an object formula_23 where formula_24. This association gives a functor formula_25 which is a functor of groupoids.\n\n\nOne of the main examples of categories fibered in groupoids comes from groupoid objects internal to a category formula_26. So given a groupoid objectformula_27there is an associated groupoid objectformula_28in the category of contravariant functors formula_29 from the yoneda embedding. Since this diagram applied to an object formula_30 gives a groupoid internal to setsformula_31there is an associated small groupoid formula_32. This gives a contravariant 2-functor formula_33, and using the Grothendieck construction, this gives a category fibered in groupoids over formula_26. Note the fiber category over an object is just the associated groupoid from the original groupoid in sets.\n\nGiven a group object formula_35 acting on an object formula_36 from formula_37, there is an associated groupoid objectformula_38where formula_39 is the projection on formula_36 and formula_41 is the composition map formula_42. This groupoid gives an induced category fibered in groupoids denoted formula_43.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He briefly served in politics, as a Teachta Dála (TD) for Cork City, and was later the president of University College Cork. He also became a priest following the death of his wife.\n\nBorn (with the last name Rahilly) in Listowel, County Kerry, he was first educated at St. Michael's College, Listowel and at Blackrock College in Dublin. O'Rahilly first earned University College Cork degrees in mathematical physics (BA 1907, MA 1908).\n\nHe studied scholastic philosophy at Stonyhurst College in Lancashire following his master's degree, then returned to UCC for a BSc (1912). In 1914, he was appointed assistant lecturer in the Department of Mathematics and Mathematical Physics at UCC, and then in 1917 he was made Professor of Mathematical Physics.\n\nIn 1919 he received a doctorate from the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome. He became Registrar of UCC in 1920, and held the post until 1943 when he became President of the University. O'Rahilly founded \"Cork University Press\" in 1925. He spent a year, in 1927, at Harvard studying social and political theory.\n\nIn 1938, he published a controversial book surveying electromagnetic theory called \"Electromagnetics\" (Longman, Green and Company), republished in 1956 by Dover as \"Electromagnetic theory, a critical examination of fundamentals.\"\n\nIn 1939, UCC conferred on him the degree D.Litt., and in 1940 the National University of Ireland awarded him a DSc.\n\nAfter the 1916 Easter Rising, O'Rahilly publicly supported Sinn Féin and was elected to Cork City Council as a Sinn Féin and Transport Workers candidate. Arrested early in 1921 for political writings, O'Rahilly was interned in Spike Island prison.\n\nReleased in October 1921 he was constitutional adviser to the Irish Treaty Delegation. O'Rahilly supported the Anglo-Irish Treaty and in 1922 he composed a draft constitution for the Irish Free State with Darrell Figgis.\n\nO'Rahilly lead Irish delegations to the International Labour Organization conferences in 1924, 1925 and 1932, and took on a conciliatory role in trade union and employers disputes in Munster. As President of University College Cork, he initiated workers' education courses in the university in the late 1940s which proved popular with Cork trade unionists.\n\nStanding as a candidate in Cork Borough for Cumann na nGaedheal, he was elected to the 4th Dáil at the 1923 general election. He resigned in 1924, causing a by-election later that year which was won by the Cumann na nGaedheal candidate Michael Egan.\n\nA deeply religious Catholic from early life, O'Rahilly was a member of the Society of Jesus but left before ordination and was dispensed from his vows. He maintained his (sometimes controversial) religious views throughout his life, and became a priest, and then Monsignor, in later years following the death of his wife. He wrote a biography of Fr. Willie Doyle SJ - which was subsequently translated into other languages.\n\nIn 1954, Pope Pius XII conferred on him the Pontifical Order of Saint Gregory the Great, the highest distinction awarded by the Pope to Catholic laymen.\n\nHe was also an advisor on university education to the Archbishop of Dublin John Charles McQuaid and sat on an informal committee from 1950. The committee included O'Rahilly, and the other presidents of the National University of Ireland; Michael Tierney of UCD, Monsignor Pádraig de Brún, Cardinal D'Alton, and Bishops Cornelius Lucey of Cork and Michael Browne of Galway.\n\nIn O'Rahilly's major survey of electromagnetic theory, \"Electromagnetics\" (1938), he opposed Maxwell's dominant (British) theory of the electromagnetic field and followed the French Catholic physicist, historian of science, and philosopher of science Pierre Duhem in rejecting Maxwell's field account. As a logical consequence of his rejection of Maxwell, O'Rahilly also rejected Einstein's theory. O'Rahilly embraced Ritz's ballistic theory of light and Ritz's electrodynamics. While Ritz's theory reduces to Coulomb's Law and Ampere's Law, since its derivation is phenomenological, it differs from the Lienard-Wiechert potential. O'Rahilly also wrote against applying the theory of evolution to human society.\n\nBecause O'Rahilly thought Cork lacked a social science curriculum he volunteered to teach courses in economics and sociology. When told that they could not spare him from the physics courses, he volunteered to teach an economics course and sociology course along with his physics courses.\n\nO'Rahilly's writings include: \"Father William Doyle, S.J.- a Spiritual Study\", \"Electromagnetic Theory\", \"Money\", \"The Burial of Christ\", \"Religion and Science\", \"Aquinas versus Marx\", \"Moral Principles\", \"Social Principles\", \"The Family at Bethany\" and \"Gospel Meditations\".\n\n"}

He played college football for the University of New Hampshire, and was selected by the Bears in the fifth round of the 1999 NFL Draft.\n\nAzumah is the first-generation American son of Theophilus and Bertha Azumah, natives of Ghana. Azumah was born in Oklahoma and grew up in Worcester, Massachusetts. At an early age, he played for the Worcester Vikings Pop Warner football team. Azumah attended Saint Peter-Marian High School receiving football honors as a Central Massachusetts and Shriners All-Star.\n\nAzumah attended the University of New Hampshire where he was a four-year starter on offense for Chip Kelly. He was an All-American tailback. At the time, Azumah was the only player in Division I-AA history to have four seasons of 1000+ rushing yards.\n\nIn 1999, Azumah was the first recipient of the Jim Urquhart Student-Athlete of the Year Award. This annual award is bestowed upon UNH senior student-athletes who excel both in athletic competition and the classroom, in addition to possessing sportsmanship, great character and passion for sports.\n\nDuring Azumah's senior year he was elected, by unanimous vote, All-American and All-Atlantic 10 Conference while shattering conference and school season records with 22 touchdowns and 2,195 rushing yards. He also won the Walter Payton Award as the best offensive player in Division I-AA football.\n\nIn his college playing career, Azumah set the Division I-AA career rushing record with 6,193 yards. He also set the Division I-AA record with 8,276 career all-purpose yards. In 2005 Azumah was inducted into the New Hampshire Wildcats Athletic Council Hall of Fame.\n\nAzumah was selected by the Chicago Bears as the 147th pick of the 1999 NFL Draft out of the University of New Hampshire. In Azumah's first year with the Chicago Bears, he won the prestigious Brian Piccolo Award. This award is given to a Chicago Bear by his teammates. Brian Piccolo played four seasons as a running back for the Chicago Bears from 1965–1968. Piccolo died from cancer in 1970 when he was just 26 years old. The Chicago Bears created the Brian Piccolo award to honor a teammate's courage, loyalty, teamwork and dedication.\n\nAzumah, who was a running back in college, continued to make the transition into an NFL defensive back. As his NFL experience grew, he also saw time on special teams and special situations on defense. In 2001 Azumah was given a contract extension. On January 19, 2002, during the divisional playoff game versus the Philadelphia Eagles, Azumah intercepted then quarterback Donovan McNabb and returned the ball 39 yards for a touchdown. That was the last touchdown scored in old Soldier Field.\n\nHis best season came in 2003 when he led the league in kickoff returns with a twenty-nine-yard average and two touchdowns. In 2004, Azumah was selected to represent the NFC in the NFL Pro Bowl as a kick returner. In that game Azumah broke the record for return yards with 228. He also recovered a fumble.\n\nFor Azumah's career, he appeared in 105 games with 48 starts. He had 384 tackles, 10 interceptions, 29 pass defense, 6.5 sacks, 6 forced fumbles and one recovery. Azumah retired in March 2006.\n\nAzumah has been seen on the Chicago Bears post game coverage and commentary on WFLD-TV, Fox Chicago and appeared weekly on Fox Chicago's Good Day Chicago. Azumah started his television broadcasting career on Comcast SportsNet Chicago in 2006 as a post game analyst and feature reporter. Azumah also worked for ESPN 1000 radio in Chicago in 2010.\n\nAzumah became a board member of the University of New Hampshire Foundation in 2001. The Foundation builds private support for the University of New Hampshire. In the summer of 2003, Azumah donated a six-figure gift to the Foundation which was directed to the University's athletic department. The Jerry Azumah Performance Center was a direct result of Azumah's gift. At age 25, Azumah became the youngest UNH alumnus to give a gift over $100,000.\n\nIn 2004 Azumah started the Azumah Student Assistance Program (ASAP). ASAP is a charitable 501(c)(3) organization and provides scholarships for disadvantaged students that attend private, secondary education. The program helps students in both Massachusetts and Illinois.\n\nAs a retired member of the Chicago Bears Football Club, Azumah joined the Board of Directors of Bears Care in 2006, the philanthropic arm of the Chicago Bears. Bears Care was founded in 1989 and supports youth athletics, education, medical research and treatment programs for breast and ovarian cancer.\n"}

It starred Robert Ri'chard as Bobby, a young boy whose life changed when his strange cousin Skeeter came to live with his family. With Skeeter's help, Bobby learns life lessons and tackles the ups and downs of growing up. The show also included Meagan Good as Bobby's friend Nina, Rondell Sheridan as Bobby's father Andre, and Angela Means as Bobby's mother Vanessa. Skeeter is portrayed by a hand puppet with Bill Bellamy providing his voice, and Drew Massey performing the puppetry, assisted by Alice Dinnean. Within the show, Skeeter is treated like a regular human and no mention of him being a puppet is made. Although the series was shot in a single-camera format, the show used a laugh track.\n\nThe show's theme song is an alternate version of 702's 1996 hit \"Steelo\", written by Missy Elliott.\n\n\"Cousin Skeeter\" first aired on September 1, 1998, sharing the 8–9pm programming block with The Wild Thornberrys. \"Cousin Skeeter\" was one of many shows at this time to touch on the idea of multicultural themes in television around this time, with notable shows such as Dora the Explorer originating around this time as well. The show focused primarily on issues that many Black Americans were facing during this time period, by presenting them in a comical way via the use of Skeeter. Skeeter frequently causes mischief, which is often balanced out by Bobby having to correct the situation.\n\n\n\n\"Cousin Skeeter\" received mixed reviews. A writer from \"The Hollywood Reporter\" described the shows characters as \"undeveloped\" and \"dependent on a one-liner approach\". Others note that the contrast between Bobby and Skeeter is meant to act as a kind of role model for children, but the message is lost in the strange behavior of Skeeter. Many viewers found it odd that the fact that Skeeter is an actual puppet is never acknowledged by any other characters, which left them to wonder why he was even a puppet in the first place. Ray Richmond, a writer for \"Variety\", found the content borderline offensive, calling it an \"a half-hour entrant in Nickelodeon’s primetime \"Nickel-O-Zone\" lineup\" that sends \"TVs view of black culture careening back to the Stone Age\". However, Rotten Tomatoes rated it as one of five 1990s children's shows that helped \"pave the way for black representation on TV\", with the article citing the episode \"The Bicycle Thief\" which tackled the issue of police interacting with black children.\n\nAccording to a \"Variety\" article from February 1999, \"Cousin Skeeter\" was \"consistently ranked as the top-rated live-action series for the [Nickelodeon] network\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2086847", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2086847", "title": "Ostraciidae", "text": "Ostraciidae\n\nOstraciidae is a family of squared, bony fish belonging to the order Tetraodontiformes, closely related to the pufferfishes and filefishes. Fish in the family are known variously as boxfishes, cofferfishes, cowfishes and trunkfishes. It contains about 23 extant species in 6 extant genera.\n\nMembers of this family occur in a variety of different colors, and are notable for the hexagonal or \"honeycomb\" patterns on their skin. They swim in a rowing manner. Their hexagonal plate-like scales are fused together into a solid, triangular or box-like carapace, from which the fins, tail, eyes and mouth protrude. Because of these heavy armoured scales, Ostraciidae are limited to slow movements, but few other fish are able to eat the adults. Ostraciid boxfish of the genus \"Lactophrys\" also secrete poisons from their skin into the surrounding water, further protecting them from predation. Although the adults are in general quite square in shape, young Ostraciidae are more rounded. The young often exhibit brighter colors than the adults.\n\nOstraciids occur in the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific oceans, generally at middle latitudes, although the common or buffalo trunkfish (\"Lactophrys trigonus\") which lives mainly in Florida waters may be found as far north as Cape Cod. The scrawled cowfish, \"Acanthostracion quadricornis\", can grow up to in length, but is generally smaller at higher latitudes.\n\nThe various members of this family are able to secrete cationic surfactants through their skin which can act as a chemical defense mechanism. An example of this is pahutoxin, a water-soluble, crystalline chemical toxin that is contained in mucus secreted from the skin of \"Ostracion lentiginosus\" and other members of the trunkfish family when they are under stress. Pahutoxin is a choline chloride ester of 3-acetoxypalmitic acid that behaves similarly to steroidal saponins found in echinoderms. When this toxic mucus is released from the fish, it quickly dissolves in the environment and negatively affects any fish in the surrounding area. It is possible since this toxin resembles certain detergents so closely, that adding these detergents as pollutants to seawater has potential to interfere with receptor-mediated processes in marine life.\n\nThe author Keiichi Matsuura lists the following genera and species:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2086851", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2086851", "title": "Hans Massaquoi", "text": "Hans Massaquoi\n\nHans-Jürgen Massaquoi (January 19, 1926 – January 19, 2013) was a German American journalist and author of African descent. He was born in Hamburg, Germany, to a white German mother and a black Liberian Vai father, the grandson of Momulu Massaquoi, the consul general of Liberia in Germany at the time.\n\nIn his autobiography, \"Destined to Witness\", Massaquoi describes his childhood and youth in Hamburg during the Nazi rise to power. His autobiography provides a unique point of view: he was one of the very few German-born children of German and African descent in all of Nazi Germany. He was often shunned but miraculously escaped Nazi persecution. This duality remained a key theme throughout his early life until he witnessed racism as practiced in colonial Africa and later in the Jim Crow American South.\n\nMassaquoi enjoyed a relatively happy childhood with his mother, Bertha Baetz, who had arrived to Hamburg from Nordhausen and earlier from Ungfrungen. His father, Al-Haj Massaquoi, was a prince of the Vai people that was in Dublin studying law and who only occasionally lived with the family at the consul general's home in Hamburg. Eventually, his grandfather Momulu, the first African posted to the diplomatic corps in Europe, was recalled to Liberia, and Hans Massaquoi and his mother remained in Germany.\n\nThe early adaptability of the young Massaquoi was remarkable. He was not aware of any other mixed race children in Hamburg, and like most German children his age, he was lured by Nazi propaganda into thinking that joining the Hitler Youth was an exciting adventure of fanfare and games and wished to join. There was a school contest to see if a class could get a 100% membership of the Deutsches Jungvolk (a subdivision of Hitler Youth), and Massaquoi's teacher devised a chart on the blackboard which showed who had joined and who had not. As the chart was filled in after each person joined, Massaquoi was pointedly the sole student left out. He recalled saying, \"But I am German ... my Mother says I'm German just like anybody else\". His later attempt to join his friends by registering at the nearest Jungvolk office was also met with contempt. Massaquoi's denial of this rite of passage reinforced his perception of being ostracized due to being deemed \"Non-Aryan\" despite his German birth and mostly traditional German upbringing after his grandfather returned to Liberia.\n\nAfter the Nuremberg Laws were passed in 1935, Massaquoi was officially classified as non-Aryan. As such, though highly capable and would have been eligible had he not been bi-racial, he was barred from pursuing educational advancement leading to a professional career and instead was forced by the Nazis to embark on an apprenticeship as a laborer. A few months before completing school, Massaquoi was required to go to a government-run job center where his assigned vocational counselor was Herr von Vett, a member of the SS. Upon seeing the \"telltale black SS insignia of dual lightning bolts in the lapel of his civilian suit\", Massaquoi expected humiliation. Instead, he was surprised when he was greeted with \"a friendly wink\", offered a seat and asked to present something which he had made. After showing Von Vett an axe and discussing his experience in working for a local blacksmith shop, Massaquoi was informed that he could \"be of great service to Germany one day\" because there would be a great demand for technically trained Germans who would go to Africa to train and develop an African workforce when Germany reclaimed its African colonies. Before Massaquoi left the interview, Von Vett invited him to shake his hand, an unusual move not in keeping with other Nazi officials Massaquoi had encountered outside of his neighborhood.\n\nThough barred from dating Aryans, Massaquoi courted a white girl, but they had to keep their relationship a secret, especially as her father was a member of the police and the SS. Such relationships were forbidden and classified as \"Rassenschande\" (race defilement) by the race laws. To keep the relationship secret, they met only in the evenings, when they would go for walks. As he dropped his girlfriend off at her house one night, he was stopped by a member of the SD, the intelligence branch of the SS. He was taken to the police station as he was believed to be \"on the prowl for defenseless women or looking for an opportunity to steal\". However, he was recognized by a police officer as living in the area and working: \"This young man is an apprentice at Lindner A.G., where he works much too hard to have enough energy left to prowl the streets at night looking for trouble. I happen to know that because of the son of one of my colleagues apprentices with him\". The SD officer closed the case and gave the Nazi salute, and Massaquoi was allowed to leave the station.\n\nIncreasingly as he matured, Massaquoi came to despise Hitler and Nazism. His skin color made him a target for racist abuse. However, in contrast to European Jews or the Roma-Sinti people and many other politically targeted enemies of Hitler's hegemony, Massaquoi escaped extermination most likely due to the fact that individuals of African descent were not as viciously antagonized. He was often targeted by Nazi employers, denied citizenship and was excluded from serving in the German army during World War II. As unemployment, hunger, and poverty grew rampant, he tried to enlist, but he was once again abusively castigated and rejected by Nazi officers.\n\nDuring the period following the Allies near destruction of Hamburg, he befriended the family of Ralph Giordano, a half-Jewish acquaintance of the surreptitious Swing Kids jazz devotees. The Giordanos managed to survive the war by hiding and helped Massaquoi and his mother secure a nearby basement after their Hamburg neighborhood was destroyed. Giordano, a lifelong friend, became a renowned journalist as well.\n\nIn 1948 Massaquoi's father, Al-Haj, secured his passage for residency in Liberia. Massaquoi was fascinated and chagrined by Africa. While appreciative that his father made possible his escape from post-World War II Germany, he eventually grew estranged from his father, whom he considered arrogant and somewhat tyrannical. However, the two reconciled just before his father's death which preceded Massaquoi's reconnecting with his maternal family in the United States.\n\nMassaquoi emigrated to the United States in 1950. He served two years in the army as a paratrooper in the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division and fought in the Korean War. He later became a naturalized U.S. citizen. His GI bill helped fund his journalism degree from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and he worked on his masters at Northwestern University until the impending birth of his first son catapulted into his career at Jet magazine and then Ebony magazine, where he became managing editor. His position allowed him to interview many historical figures of the arts, politics and civil rights movement in America and Africa. He was interviewed in turn by Studs Terkel for his oral history \"The Good War\", and related his unique experiences in Germany under the Nazi government.\n\nMassaquoi visited family and friends in Germany many times throughout his life, always cognizant of Germany's complex history as the country of his childhood.\n\nAt the time of his death, Massaquoi was married to Katharine Rousseve Massaquoi. He had two sons by a previous marriage, Steve and Hans Jr., who also survived him.\n\n"}

The six-and-a-half mile standard gauge line was the only section built of a plan to connect Shrewsbury with mid Wales. It was part of a joint venture between the Great Western Railway and London and North Western Railway companies.\n\nThe route, which was conceived in the late 1850s, was planned to connect Shrewsbury via Hanwood on the Cambrian Line, with Pontesbury, Minsterley, Montgomery and Newtown. Services would also be able to continue to the Welsh coast. At Pontesbury station, transfer sidings connected the narrow gauge Snailbeach District Railway, which ran to lead mines at Snailbeach.\n\nOn 14 February 1861, the first section of line was opened from Cruckmeole Junction, on the Cambrian Line, to Minsterley. However, with the northerly section of the Cambrian main line into Wales opening the following year in 1862 (connecting Newtown via Welshpool to Shrewsbury), it became apparent there was little need to continue beyond Minsterley to Newtown. The station became the terminus of the cancelled project.\n\nBy the start of World War II, regular traffic on the line had almost ended. Passenger services ceased to Minsterley in 1951, although Hanwood station on the Cambrian Line remained open to passengers until 1960 and to goods until 1964. The rest of the branch line to Minsterley continued to carry goods (mainly for the Minsterley Creamery) until 1967 when the line was closed as part of the Beeching cuts.

His parents emigrated to the United States while he was still an infant. After attending Stanford University, where he was a member of the \"Alpha Sigma Phi\" fraternity, he trained as a theatre actor at the Pasadena Community Playhouse and subsequently performed on Broadway, continuing to return to the stage periodically throughout his career.\n\nHe made his motion picture debut in 1932 as an uncredited spectator at the Colosseum in \"The Sign of the Cross\". At age 22 in 1934, he played the role of Silas Barnaby, the villain in the Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy classic \"Babes in Toyland\". In 1936, having until then been performing under his real name of Henry Kleinbach, he adopted the stage name of Henry Brandon.\n\nHe portrayed the villainous manager of an opera company in \"Our Gang Follies of 1938\". He played the character of Renouf, a deserter from the French Foreign Legion, in the 1939 remake of \"Beau Geste\". In 1940, he featured in the title role of the successful Republic serial \"Drums of Fu Manchu\". In 1943, he played Major Ruck, a British secret agent in the guise of an SS officer in Edge of Darkness. Brandon, standing at 6 ft 4\" in height, managed to make Errol Flynn look short in the scenes in which they appeared together in \"Edge of Darkness\" in spite of Flynn's height of 6 ft 2\". In 1948 he appeared as Giles de Rais in \"Joan of Arc\".\n\nHe played a French army captain in \"Vera Cruz\" (1954). He portrayed Jesse James in \"Hell's Crossroads\" (1957).

He also played the Chinese villain Fu Manchu. The successful serial \"Drums of Fu Manchu\" (1940) with Brandon in the title role was cancelled by its producer Republic Pictures at the express request of the State Department in 1941 after the U.S. entry into World War II out of concern that it was inciting anti-Chinese sentiment in the American public, which conflicted both with the interests of the Chinese-American population and the international relationship with China as an allied power in the war against Japan.\n\nHe appeared as the African tribal chieftain M'Tara in \"Tarzan and the She-Devil\" (1953). In 1956, he played the chief villain, a Comanche chieftain called Scar, in John Ford's \"The Searchers\". In 1960, he played a Native American character again as Running Wolf in the episode \"Gold Seeker\" in the television series \"The Rebel\". He played Asian characters in two 1961 episodes, viz. \"Angel of Death\" and \"The Assassins\", of the television series \"Adventures in Paradise\". In 1961, he played an American Indian chieftain again in John Ford's \"Two Rode Together\". In 1965, he played the Shug chief in the pilot episode of \"F Troop\".\n\nBrandon married in 1941, the marriage produced one son before ending in 1946. He subsequently had a long relationship with the actor Mark Herron.\nHerron left Brandon in the mid-1960s, and was briefly the fourth husband of Judy Garland. Herron and Garland separated after five months of marriage, after which Herron returned to Brandon and remained with him until Brandon's death.\n\nBrandon lived in West Hollywood in his final years. He died on 15 February 1990 at the age of 77 of a heart attack at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles. His body was cremated, and the ashes reportedly were scattered at an undisclosed theatre location.\n\n\n\nNotes\nSources\n\nFurther reading\n\n"}

President Lyndon B. Johnson was nominated for a full term. Senator Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota was nominated for vice president.\n\nThe convention took place less than a year after President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas. On the last day of the convention, Kennedy's brother Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy introduced a short film in honor of his brother's memory. After Kennedy appeared on the convention floor, delegates erupted in 22 minutes of uninterrupted applause, causing him to nearly break into tears. Speaking about his brother's vision for the country, Robert Kennedy quoted from \"Romeo and Juliet\": \"When he shall die, take him and cut him out into the stars, and he shall make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun.\" The Keynote speech was then delivered by Senator John O. Pastore, of Rhode Island, where he spoke passionately of the party's success and in remembrance of President Kennedy. Pastore was later featured on the cover of \"The New York Times\" and \"Life\" magazine for the success of the address. \nAdlai E. Stevenson II, Ambassador to the United Nations and twice a Democratic nominee for President, received a short, but polite ovation before introducing a memorial film the same day for former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, who had died on November 7, 1962. By August 26, 1964, 14,000 retirees from the N. C. S. C. (National Council Of Senior Citizens) arrived at the Convention, to encourage President Johnson to extend public health insurance to millions of Americans. In July 1965, Medicare was signed into law in front of former President Harry S. Truman, whose push for N. H. I. (National Health Insurance) had collapsed, nearly two decades earlier.\n\nAt the national convention the integrated Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) claimed the seats for delegates for Mississippi, on the grounds that the official Mississippi delegation had been elected in violation of the party's rules because blacks had been systematically excluded from voting in the primaries, and participating in the precinct and county caucuses and the state convention; whereas the MFDP delegates had all been elected in strict compliance with party rules. The MFDP prepared a legal brief detailing the reasons why the \"regular\" Mississippi delegation did not adequately represent their state's residents, including the tactics employed to exclude participation by Black citizens. Jack Minnis wrote, \"MFDP, with the help of SNCC, produced brochures, mimeographed biographies of the MFDP delegates, histories of the MFDP, legal arguments, historical arguments, moral arguments\" that were distributed to all of the Convention's delegates. The party's liberal leaders, led by Congresswoman Edith Green supported an even division of the seats between the two delegations. But Johnson was concerned that, while the regular Democrats of Mississippi would probably vote for Goldwater anyway, rejecting them would lose him the South. Eventually, Hubert Humphrey, Walter Reuther and the black civil rights leaders including Roy Wilkins and Bayard Rustin worked out a compromise: two of the 68 MFDP delegates chosen by Johnson would be made at-large delegates and the remainder would be non-voting guests of the convention; the regular Mississippi delegation was required to pledge to support the party ticket; and no future Democratic convention would accept a delegation chosen by a discriminatory poll.\n\nJoseph Rauh, the MFDP's lawyer, initially refused this deal, but eventually urged the MFDP to accept it. But the MFDP delegates refused because by accepting the official all-white Mississippi delegation, the party validated a process in which blacks had been denied their constitutional right to vote and participate in the political process. They felt that because the MFDP had conducted their delegate selection process according to the party rules, they should be seated as the Mississippi delegation, not just a token two of them as at-large delegates. Many civil rights activists were deeply offended by the convention's outcome. As leader (and now Representative) John Lewis said, \"We had played by the rules, done everything we were supposed to do, had played the game exactly as required, had arrived at the doorstep and found the door slammed in our face.\"\n\nMany white delegates from Mississippi and Alabama refused to sign any pledge, and left the convention. In all, \"43 of the 53 members of the Alabama delegation . . . refused to pledge their support for the national ticket of Johnson and Hubert Humphrey and were denied seating.\"\n\nPresident Johnson announced his long-expected candidacy for a full term just days before the convention started. The favorite son candidates who had run in his place then withdrew, his name was the only one placed in nomination, and for the last time, the presidential roll-call vote was dispensed with. Johnson was nominated by voice vote.\n\nThe Balloting:\n\nWith the office of Vice President vacant since the murder of President Kennedy nine months previous, the question of who would fill it was paramount on the minds of the \"chattering classes\". It had been rumored that the President was going to choose his predecessor's brother-in-law Sargent Shriver but that Robert F. Kennedy had nixed this idea, claiming that he wasn't a real Kennedy and it would be impolitic to choose him. The Attorney General made it known that he deserved the second spot instead, but then President Johnson announced that sitting Cabinet members would not be under consideration.\n\nSpeculation centered on Senate Majority Whip Hubert H. Humphrey, a perennial candidate who had run for either the presidential or vice presidential nomination in every election since 1952, and was a champion of civil rights. On the second day of the convention, LBJ invited Humphrey and Connecticut Senator Thomas Dodd to the White House for an extended job interview. After a long wait, the President announced that his choice was Humphrey, who was nominated by voice vote the following day.\n\n\n"}

It formerly aired on Sunday afternoons at 1PM (1:30PM in Newfoundland and Labrador), as well as on Saturday evenings on 6:30PM with repeats on Friday mornings at 11 AM. It was replaced in September 2006 by a comedy show \"The Debaters\".\n\nThe show travelled around Canada, recording in front of a live audience at various local venues. The show provided a mix of stand-up, improvisational, sketch, and musical comedy. Elliott usually began the show with a monologue, and introduced the acts that followed, often comedians who were local to the area, who were given the chance of national exposure through the program.\n\nElliott's work first caught the attention of CBC with the airing of one of his concert performances on \"Definitely Not the Opera\". He also did additional comedy segments for other CBC radio shows, including \"Basic Black\", \"Sunday Showcase\" and \"Morningside\". He was given the retiring \"Royal Canadian Air Farce\"'s traditional radio show timeslot in 1996, and the show became a regular weekly showcase of Canadian comedy.\n\nThe name of the show was derived from a line used by famous Canadian humourist Stephen Leacock in his story \"Gertrude the Governess\". (\"Lord Ronald said nothing; he flung himself from the room, flung himself upon his horse and rode madly off in all directions.\") This phrase was both literally and figuratively applicable, as the show travelled across Canada, and the host and his guests covered the full range of the comedy spectrum.\n\nThere were two years that the format was changed, and Elliott travelled exclusively to smaller venues, accompanied only by Derek Edwards. These tours were intended to be more intimate affairs, and also served as a bit of a break for Elliott, as the pared-down format required much less planning and arranging.\n\nAfter a summer series consisting of repeats in 2006, the show was quietly replaced by \"The Debaters\" in its former timeslots. Beginning in April 2007, further repeats of the show were broadcast Monday afternoons on CBC Radio One.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2086925", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2086925", "title": "Pink-collar worker", "text": "Pink-collar worker\n\nA pink-collar worker refers to someone working in the care-oriented career field or in fields historically considered to be women’s work. This may include jobs in the beauty industry, nursing, social work, teaching, secretarial work, or child care. While these jobs may also be filled by men, they are typically female-dominated and may pay significantly less than white-collar or blue-collar jobs.\n\nThe term pink-collar was popularized in the late 1970s by writer and social critic Louise Kapp Howe to denote women working as nurses, secretaries, and elementary school teachers. Its origins, however, go back to the early 1970s, to when the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) was placed before the states for ratification. At that time, the term was used to denote secretarial staff as well as non-professional office staff, all of which were largely held by women. These positions were not white-collar jobs, but neither were they blue-collar, manual labor. Hence, the creation of the term \"pink-collar,\" which indicated it was not white-collar, was nonetheless an office job and one that was overwhelmingly filled by women.\n\nPink-collar occupations tend to be personal-service-oriented worker working in retail, nursing, and teaching (depending on the level), are part of the service sector, and are among the most common occupations in the United States. The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that, as of May 2008, there were over 2.2 million persons employed as servers in the United States. Furthermore, the World Health Organization's 2011 World Health Statistics Report states that there are 19.3 million nurses in the world today. In the United States, women comprise 92.1% of the registered nurses that are currently employed.\n\nPink-collar occupations include:\nHistorically, women were responsible for the running of a household. Their financial security was often dependent upon a male patriarch. Widowed or divorced women struggled to support themselves and their children.\n\nWestern women began to develop more opportunities when they moved into the paid workplace, formerly of the male domain. In the mid 19th and early 20th century women aimed to be treated as the equals to their male counterparts, notably in the Seneca Falls Convention. In 1920 American women legally gained the right to vote, marking a turning point for the American women's suffrage movement; yet race and class remained as impediments to voting for some women.\n\nAt the turn of the 19th century into the 20th, large numbers of single women in the United States traveled to large cities such as New York where they found work in factories and sweatshops, working for low pay operating sewing machines, sorting feathers, rolling tobacco and other similar menial tasks.\n\nIn these factories, workers frequently breathed dangerous fumes and worked with flammable materials. In order for factories to save money, women were required to clean and adjust the machines while they were running, which resulted in accidents where women lost their fingers or hands. Many women who worked in the factories earned meager wages for working long hours in unsafe conditions and as a result lived in poverty.\n\nThroughout the 20th century women such as Emily Balch, Jane Addams, and Lillian Wald were advocates for evolving the roles of women in America. These women created settlement houses and launched missions in overcrowded squalid immigrant neighborhoods to offer social services to women and children.\n\nIn addition, women gradually became more involved with church activities and came to take on more leadership roles in various religious societies. The women who joined these societies worked with their members, some of whom were full-time teachers, nurses, missionaries, and social workers to accomplish their leadership tasks. The Association for the Sociology of Religion was the first to elect a woman president in 1938.\n\nWorld War I sparked a demand for \"pink-collar jobs\" as the military needed personnel to type letters, answer phones, and perform other secretarial tasks. One thousand women worked for the U.S. Navy as stenographers, clerks, and telephone operators.\n\nIn addition, Military nurses, an already \"feminized\" and accepted profession for women, expanded during wartime. In 1917, Louisa Lee Schuyler opened the Bellevue Hospital School of Nursing, which was the first to train women as professional nurses. After completing training, female nurses worked in hospitals or more predominantly in field tents.\n\nWorld War II marked the emergence of large numbers of women working domestically in industrial jobs to assist in the war effort as directed under the War Manpower Commission which recruited women to fill war manufacturing jobs.\n\nNotably, American women in World War II joined the armed services and were stationed domestically and abroad through participation in non combat military roles and as medical personnel. One thousand female pilots joined the Women Airforce Service Pilots, one hundred and forty thousand women joined the Women's Army Corps and one hundred thousand women joined the U.S. Navy as nurses through WAVES in addition to administrative staff.\n\nA typical job sought by working women in the early 20th century was a telephone operator or Hello Girl. The Hello Girls began as women who operated on telephone switchboards during WWI by answering telephones and talking to impatient callers in a calming tone. The workers would sit on stools facing a wall with hundreds of outlets and tiny blinking lights. They had to work quickly when a light flashed by plugging the cord into the proper outlet. Despite the difficult work, many women wanted this job because it paid five dollars a week and provided a rest lounge for the employees to take a break.\n\nFemale secretaries were also popular. They were instructed to be efficient, tough, and hardworking while also appearing soft, accommodating, and subservient. Women were expected to be the protector and partner to their boss behind closed doors and a helpmate in public. These women were encouraged to go to charm schools and express their personality through fashion instead of furthering their education.\n\nSocial work became a female-dominated profession in the 1930s, emphasizing a group professional identity and the casework method. Social workers gave crucial expertise for the expansion of federal, state and local government, as well as services to meet the needs of the Depression.\n\nTeachers in primary and secondary schools remained female, although as the war progressed, women began to move on to better employment and higher salaries. In 1940, teaching positions paid less than $1,500 a year and fell to $800 in rural areas.\n\nWomen scientists found it hard to gain appointments at universities. Women scientists were forced to take positions in high schools, state or women's colleges, governmental agencies and alternative institutions such as libraries or museums. Women who took jobs at such places often did clerical duties and though some held professional positions, these boundaries were blurred. Some found work as human computers.\n\nMostly women were hired as librarians, who had been professionalized and feminized from the late 19th century. In 1920, women accounted for 88% of librarians in the United States.\n\nTwo-thirds of the American Geographical Society (AGS)'s employees were women, who served as librarians, editorial personnel in the publishing programs, secretaries, research editors, copy editors, proofreaders, research assistants and sales staff. These women came with credentials from well-known colleges and universities and many were overqualified for their positions, but later were promoted to more prestigious positions.\n\nAlthough female employees did not receive equal pay, they did get sabbaticals to attend university and to travel for their professions at the cost of the AGS. Those women working managerial and library or museums positions made an impact on women in the work force, but still encountered discrimination when they tried to advance.\n\nIn the 1940s, clerical work expanded to occupy the largest number of women employees, this field diversified as it moved into commercial service. The average worker in the 1940s was over 35 years old, married, and needed to work to keep their families afloat.\n\nDuring the 1950s, women were taught that marriage and domesticity were more important than a career. Most women followed this path because of the uncertainty of the post-war years. Suburban housewives were encouraged to have hobbies like bread making and sewing. The 1950s housewife was in conflict between being \"just a housewife\" because their upbringing taught them competition and achievement. Many women had furthered their education deriving a sense of self-worth.\n\nA single woman working in a factory in the early 20th century earned less than $8 a week, which is equivalent to roughly less that $98 dollars a week today. If the woman was absent or was late, employers penalized them by docking their pay. These women would live in boarding houses costing $1.50 a week, waking at 5:30 a.m. to start their ten-hour work day. When women entered the paid workforce in the 1920s they were paid less than men because employers thought the women's jobs were temporary. Employers also paid women less than men because they believed in the \"Pin Money Theory\", which said that women's earnings were secondary to that of their male counterparts. With this being said, women took typical jobs that were \"considerably less substantial than their husbands' in terms of both the average number of hours worked per week as well as continuity over time\". However, working women still experienced stress and overload because they were still responsible for the majority of the housework and taking care of the children. This left women isolated and subjected them to their husband's control.\n\nIn the early 1900s women's pay was one to three dollars a week and much of that went to living expenses. In the 1900s female tobacco strippers earned five dollars a week, half of what their male coworkers made and seamstresses made six to seven dollars a week compared to a cutter's salary of $16. This differed from women working in factories in the 1900s as they were paid by the piece, not receiving a fixed weekly wage. Those that were pinching pennies pushed themselves to produce more product so that they earned more money. Women who earned enough to live on found it impossible to keep their salary rate from being reduced because bosses often made \"mistakes\" in computing a worker's piece rate. As well as this, women who received this kind of treatment did not disagree for fear of losing their jobs. Employers would frequently deduct pay for work they deemed imperfect and for simply trying to lighten the mood by laughing or talking while they worked. In the 1937 a woman's average yearly salary was $525 compared to a man's salary of $1,027. In the 1940s two-thirds of the women who were in the labor force suffered a decrease in earnings; the average weekly paychecks fell from $50 to $37. This gap in wage stayed consistent, as women in 1991 only earned seventy percent of what men earned regardless of their education.\n\nLater on in the 1970s and 1980s as women began to fight for equality, they fought against discrimination in jobs where women worked and the educational institutions that would lead to those jobs. In 1973 the average salaries for women were 57% compared to those of men, but this gender earnings gap was especially noticeable in pink-collar jobs where the largest number of women were employed. Women were given routine, less responsible jobs available and often with a lower pay than men. These jobs were monotonous and mechanical often with assembly-line procedures.\n\nIn 1975, a study was carried out that examined the pay differences between single and married women. It was found that married women made substantially less than single women, as single women made up to 97% of what a single man would make and married women would only make up to 62% of married men's pay. This was found to potentially be because of taking maternity leaves, as less work related experience would be gained in the time that these women left to care for their children, leading to less investment from the company. It was also found that women now are more likely to join or re-join the work force after having children, rather than the traditional role of becoming a stay at home mother.\n\nWomen entering the workforce had difficulty finding a satisfactory job without references or an education. However, opportunities for higher education expanded as women were admitted to all-male schools like the United States service academies and Ivy League strongholds. Education became a way for society to shape women into its ideal housewife. In the 1950s, authorities and educators encouraged college because they found new value in vocational training for domesticity. College prepared women for future roles because while men and women were taught together, they were groomed for different paths after they graduated. Education started out as a way to teach women how to be a good wife, but education also allowed women to broaden their minds.\n\nBeing educated was an expectation for women entering the paying workforce, despite the fact that their male equivalents did not need a high school diploma. While in college, a woman would experience extracurricular activities, such as a sorority, that offered a separate space for the woman to practice types of social service work that was expected from her.\n\nHowever, not all of a woman's education was done in the classroom. Women were also educated through their peers through \"dating\". Men and women no longer had to be supervised when alone together. Dating allowed men and women to practice the paired activities that would later become a way of life.\n\nNew women's organizations sprouted up working to reform and protect women in the workplace. The largest and most prestigious of these organizations was The General Federation of Women's Clubs (GFWC), whose members were conservative middle-class housewives. The International Ladies Garment Workers Union (ILGWU) was formed after women shirtwaist makers went on strike in New York City in 1909. It started as a small walkout, with a handful of members from one shop and grew to a force of ten of thousands, changing the course of the labor movement forever. In 1910 women allied themselves with the Progressive Party who sought to reform social issues.\n\nAnother organization that grew out of women in the workforce, was the Women's Bureau of the Department of Labor. The Women's Bureau regulated conditions for women employees. As female labor became a crucial part of the economy, efforts by the Women's Bureau increased. The Bureau pushed for employers to take advantage of \"women-power\" and persuaded women to enter the employment market.\n\nIn 1913 the ILGWU signed the well-known \"protocol in the Dress and Waist Industry\" which was the first contract between labor and management settled by outside negotiators. The contract formalized the trade's division of labor by gender.\n\nAnother win for women came in 1921 when congress passed the Sheppard-Towner Act, a welfare measure intended to reduce infant and maternal mortality; it was the first federally funded healthcare act. The act provided federal funds to establish health centers for prenatal and child care. Expectant mothers and children could receive health checkups and health advice. \n\nIn 1963 the Equal Pay Act was passed making it the first federal law against sex discrimination, equal pay for equal work, and made employers hire women workers if they qualified from the start.\n\nUnions also became a major outlet for women to fight against the unfair treatment they experienced. Women who joined these types of unions stayed before and after work to talk about the benefits of the union, collect dues, obtain charters, and form bargaining committees.\n\nThe National Recovery Administration (NRA) was approved in May 1933. The NRA negotiated codes designed to rekindle production. It raised wages, shortened workers' hours, and increased employment for the first time maximizing hour and minimizing wage provisions benefiting female workers. The NRA had its flaws however, it only covered half of the women in the workforce particularly manufacturing and trade. The NRA regulated working conditions only for women with a job and did not offer any relief for the two million unemployed women who desperately needed it.\n\nThe 1930s proved successful for women in the workplace thanks to federal relief programs and the growth of unions. For the first time women were not completely dependent on themselves, in 1933 the federal government expanded in its responsibility to female workers. In 1938 the Fair Labor Standards Act grew out of several successful strikes. Two million women joined the workforce during the Great Depression despite negative public opinion.\n\n\"Pink ghetto\" is a term used to refer to jobs dominated by women. The term was coined in 1983 to describe the limits women have in furthering their careers since the jobs are often dead-end, stressful and underpaid. The term \"pink ghetto\" is just simply another way of describing pink-collar work. \"Pink ghetto\" was more commonly used in the early years, when women were finally able to work. Pink-collar work became the popular term once it was popularized by Louise Kapp Howe, a writer and social critic, in the 1970s.\n\n\"Pink ghetto\" can also describe the placement of female managers into positions that will not lead them to the board room, thus perpetuating the \"glass ceiling\". This includes managing areas such as human resources, customer service, and other areas that do not contribute to the corporate \"bottom line\". While this allows women to rise in ranks as a manager, their careers may eventually stall out and they may be excluded from the upper echelons.\n\nThe pink collar ghetto, also known as the velvet ghetto, concerns the phenomena of women entering a certain field employment and subsequently the status and pay grade of this profession drops along with the new influx of women workers. Some scholars, such as Elizabeth Toth, claim this is partially the result of women taking technician roles instead of managerial roles, being less likely to negotiate higher pay, and being perceived as putting family life before work .\n\nOther scholars, such as Kim Golombisky, acknowledge the inequalities of women, and especially women of color and different classes, as part of the cause of this phenomenon.\n\nTraditionally, Feminism in public relations focuses on gender equality, but new scholarship makes claims that focusing on social justice would better aid feminist cause in the field. This brings the idea of intersectionalism to the pink collar ghetto. The issue is not caused by what women lack as professionals, but caused by larger societal injustices and interlocking systems of oppression.\n\nScholars such as Judy Wajcman argue that technology has long been monopolized by men and is a great source of their power historically. However, more millennial men are doing pink collar work because technology is affecting blue collar work. Machines are able to perform many of the tasks that were typically gendered male within factories. In a 1990 study conducted by Allan H. Hunt and Timothy L. Hunt, they examined how industrial robots would impact both the creation of jobs as well as job displacement among unskilled workers in the United States. It was concluded that the impact of unemployment due to the spread of robotics would be felt the greatest by uneducated, unskilled blue-collar workers. New technology in the form of robotics eliminates many semi or unskilled jobs, and has taken traditional male filled roles away from the job market. Judy Wajman maintains that skills involving machines and strength are associated with masculinity. This means that the least technical jobs (pink-collar) jobs are associated with women. These machines designed by men, using the technology they have always monopolized, are now displacing them and forcing them into feminized pink-collar work.\n\nIt was found as well that men going into traditionally claimed pink collar jobs are felt discriminated and threatened in their jobs. Men going into positions such as teaching, nursing and childcare faced many negative stereotypes in these lines of work, as men have traditionally been viewed as stern, strong and holding dominant attitudes. This stereotype about men negatively impacts men in these lines of work, as it is expected that a woman with the same position would be more nurturing, caring and well suited for the work.\n\n\n\n"}

They should not be confused with the indoor Papal Slippers or the Episcopal sandals, which are the liturgical footwear proper to all ordained Catholic bishops of the Latin Rite.\n\nAs did many noblemen, the Pope wore slippers (\"pantofole\") inside his residences and leather shoes outside. The indoor Papal Slippers were made of red velvet or silk and were heavily decorated in gold braid, with a gold cross in the middle.\n\nThroughout Church history, the color red has been deliberately chosen to represent the blood of Catholic martyrs spilt through the centuries following in the footsteps of Christ. The red papal shoes are also linked to Christ's own bloodied feet as he was prodded, whipped, and pushed along the Via Dolorosa on his way to his crucifixion, culminating in the piercing of his hands and feet on the cross. The red shoes also symbolize the submission of the Pope to the ultimate authority of Jesus Christ. Beyond this, it is said the red papal shoes also signify God’s burning love for humanity as exhibited during Pentecost when red vestments are worn to commemorate the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the apostles as tongues of fire rest upon their heads. \n\nThe papal shoes, along with the camauro, papal mozzetta, and cloak (tabarro), are the only remnants of the former red color of the papal garments. Pope Pius V (1566 - 1572), who was a Dominican, changed the papal color to white by continuing to wear the white color of his Dominican religious order, and it has remained so since.\n\nBefore 1969, the Pope, like all bishops and prelates, wore episcopal sandals during the Mass. The color of the Episcopal sandals varied to match the liturgical color of the Mass.\n\nThe Papal outdoor shoes were made of plain red Morocco leather and had a wide cross in gold braid. The cross once extended across the shoe and down to the sole. In the eighteenth century the ends of the cross were shortened, as shown in the photo of Pius VII's shoes. This old-fashioned type of dress shoe is very thin-soled and is sometimes called \"pantofola liscia\" or smooth slipper model.\n\nAfter 1958, Pope John XXIII added gold buckles to the outdoor papal shoes, making them similar to the red shoes worn by cardinals outside of Rome. Pope Paul VI eliminated the gold cross and completely discontinued the custom of kissing the papal foot. Paul VI can be seen wearing red buckled shoes in photographs from his 1964 trip to Jerusalem. In 1969, Paul VI abolished buckles from all ecclesiastical shoes, which had been customarily required at the Papal Court and for prelates. He also discontinued the use of the indoor velvet papal slippers and the Paschal mozzetta and shoes. Paul VI wore plain red leather shoes throughout the rest of his pontificate. Pope John Paul I, who was pope for only 33 days, continued wearing the plain red leather shoes worn by Paul VI. Early in his pontificate Pope John Paul II wore red shoes; however he later adopted wearing brown shoes. Paul VI, John Paul I, and John Paul II were buried in the red leather papal shoes.\n\nPope Benedict XVI restored the use of the red papal shoes, which were provided by his personal cobbler, Adriano Stefanelli of Novara, who has several pictures and documents in his shoe-shop attesting the fact. In 2008, Pope Benedict XVI also restored the use of the white damask silk Paschal mozzetta, which was previously worn with white silk slippers.\n\nThe current pope, Pope Francis, has chosen to wear black shoes, forgoing the tradition for his pontificate.\n\n\n"}

In addition to his success in racing, he made a fortune, lost it, and remade it buying and selling timberlands. Throughout his life he developed a reputation for drinking and partying. In 1999, he was inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nHe was born in Floyd, Virginia to Morton and Minnie Turner on April 12, 1924. Curtis grew up with a brother and two sisters. His father, Morton Turner, was into the moonshine business and having a productive still. Curtis was responsible for delivering his father's moonshine it to the customers. From a very early age, long before he was old enough for a driver’s license, Curtis developed his driving talents by running moonshine through the mountains from the law. He was never caught by anyone. Locals spoke of how Curtis would drive away from hot pursuit of revenuers and lawmen and his legendary ability to turn a car 180 degrees in a very small space.\n\nHe began his racing career in 1946 when he finished 18th in a field of 18 contestants in a race at Mount Airy, North Carolina. However, he rebounded and won his next race. He also was one of the founding members in the original group that met in Daytona Beach at the Streamline Hotel to discuss and support the formation of NASCAR. During his career, he won 360 races in several different racing series, including 22 in the NASCAR Convertible Division in 1956, and 17 wins in the NASCAR Grand National Series. From 1950 to 1954, he drove for Oldsmobile being billed as the \"Blond Blizzard of Virginia\". He switched to driving Fords in 1954. He eventually acquired the nickname of \"Pops\", allegedly because of the way he would \"pop\" other drivers on the track.\n\nTurner drove a Holman Moody-prepared Studebaker Lark in the 2-hour compact car race accompanying the inaugural United States Grand Prix at Sebring, Florida, on December 12, 1959. He finished second overall, trailing the disc-brake equipped Jaguar 3.4 of Walt Hansgen.\n\nHe is noted for several other racing accomplishments:\n\n\nNeeding money in order to support the newly constructed Charlotte Motor Speedway, Turner and his business partner Bruton Smith turned to the Teamsters Union to organize a union for them, the Federation of Professional Athletes, in 1961. According to \"The Washington Post\": \"His aims are for better purses, a share in broadcasting rights and retirement benefits for the drivers.\" NASCAR founder Bill France Sr. refused to let any driver who was a part of the union race, and eventually all the drivers except for Turner and Tim Flock sided with France. Turner and Flock were banned for life and Charlotte Motor Speedway went bankrupt before being saved by its board of directors.\n\nTurner continued to race under other sanctioning bodies, including the Midwest Association for Race Cars (MARC), even promoting his own 100-mile event on the dirt at Lakewood Speedway, Georgia, in October 1961. Tim Flock finished second in that event. Turner and Flock sued NASCAR and France, \"seeking $200,000 punitive damages each and restitution for loss of earnings.\" \"Attorneys for the drivers claim the ban represents a violation of state right to work laws because test driving contracts involving $150 a day plus expenses were canceled as a result of the action. NASCAR and France's attorneys contended the ban isn't a right to work violation because it doesn't involve an employer-employee relationship. They said Flock and Turner are individual contractors and not employees of NASCAR or any track.\"\n\nDuring his NASCAR ban, Turner attempted a few USAC Championship Cars races, in 1962, Turner attempted a race at Illinois State Fairgrounds but failed to qualify. In 1963 Turner competed in the season-opener at Trenton International Speedway and finished 12th. He also attempted the 1963 Indianapolis 500 but failed to qualify.\n\nHowever, the ban was lifted after four years in 1965, and Turner returned to NASCAR racing. Bill France was in a bind and needed to mend some fences. 1962 and 1963 NASCAR-points champion Joe Weatherly was killed driving a Mercury at Riverside, California on January 19, 1964, and his star driver Fireball Roberts had died following a fiery crash on May 24, 1964, at the World 600 in Charlotte. The track owners wanted Turner back. \"Turner was slated to drive for a newly-organized group, The Grand American Racing Association, organized July 31 in Sumter, S.C. Turner was due to compete in the first of 17 scheduled races at Concord, N.C. Aug 21.\" France was also short of cars. The Chrysler factory were boycotting NASCAR over the organizing body's ban of the Hemi engine, and Richard Petty went drag racing in the first half of the 1965 season. The Ford factory were also in dispute with NASCAR over the SOHC engine, which faced a joint NASCAR-USAC ban on December 17, 1965.\n\nTurner, then 41, soon notched the first victory of his comeback in a Ford at the inaugural American 500, at the North Carolina Motor Speedway, Rockingham, North Carolina, on October 31, 1965, winning a purse of $13,090. Turner lost his Ford ride in 1966 when: \"Ford withdrew its factory backed racing teams from competition when the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing and the United States Auto Club ruled April 6 that Fords equipped with an overhead cam engine must carry 427 additional pounds.\" Turner started the 1966 season in a Ford, but with the Ford-factory withdrawal, he signed to drive a Chevrolet for Smokey Yunick out of Daytona Beach, Florida.\n\nIn 1968 he was the first NASCAR driver to appear on the cover of \"Sports Illustrated\".\n\nHe died in an airplane crash near Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania on October 4, 1970; the crash also killed golfer Clarence King. Police said the Aero Commander 500 piloted by Turner crashed shortly after taking off from the Dubois-Jefferson Airport en route to Roanoke, Virginia. At the time of the crash, Turner was preparing to compete in that week's National 500 at Charlotte in a special one-off race.\n\nIn December 2017, the Virginia Department of Historic Resources approved the erection of a historic marker denoting Turner's birthplace in Floyd County and detailing his accomplishments.\n\n\n"}

She is the current head coach of the Brazil women's national football team. As a player, Sundhage played most of her career as a forward and retired as the top scorer for her national team, but she also had stints playing as a midfielder and a sweeper.\n\nSundhage was the head coach of the United States women's national team from 2008 to 2012 and led the team to two Olympic gold medals and a silver medal at the World Cup. Her success led to her winning the 2012 FIFA World Coach of the Year. Sundhage later became the head coach of her native Sweden women's national football team from 2012 to 2017, winning an Olympic silver medal in 2016.\n\nSundhage started with IFK Ulricehamn as a youth player and eventually moved to Falköpings KIK in 1978. She then joined Jitex BK from 1979 to 1981. Sundhage played 1982 to 1983 with Östers IF, scoring 30 times in her first season with the club and chipping in 35 more in her second season. 1984 saw a move back to Jitex BK, while 1985 saw Sundhage split time between Stattena IF, S.S. Lazio (where she scored 17 times), and Jitex BK. She played the 1986 season with Hammarby IF DFF, before she moved back to Jitex BK from 1979 through 1989. Sundhage finished her career with Hammarby IF DFF, playing from 1990 until she retired in 1996.\n\nShe won four Damallsvenskan championships, all with Jitex BK, as well as two additional Svenska Cupen with the club. She also won two Svenska Cupen with Hammarby IF DFF.\n\nSundhage made her first appearance for the Swedish National Team as a 15-year-old in 1975, eventually amassing 146 caps and scoring 71 goals for her country. Her 71 goals gave her joint-lead with Lena Videkull for the most in the Swedish National Team history, a record which has since been surpassed by both Hanna Ljungberg and Lotta Schelin.\n\nShe participated for Sweden in the 1991 (a third-place finish) and 1995 editions of the FIFA Women's World Cup and the 1996 Summer Olympics. She won, and was the top scorer, in the 1984 UEFA Women's Championship. Her image appeared on a Swedish postage stamp in 1988. In 1989 Sundhage scored the first goal in a women's match at Wembley Stadium, as Sweden beat England 2–0 in a curtain–raiser for the Rous Cup.\n\nIn 2000, Sundhage finished sixth in the voting for FIFA Women's Player of the Century.\n\nSundhage got her start in coaching as a player/manager when she was with Hammarby IF DFF from 1992 to 1994. She then took assistants jobs with Vallentuna BK (1998 to 1999) and AIK Fotboll Dam (2000) before moving across the Atlantic Ocean to become an assistant with Philadelphia Charge of the new Women's United Soccer Association in the United States. She eventually was hired on by Boston Breakers as the head coach, winning the league title and being named the 2003 WUSA Coach of the Year in the process. Once the WUSA folded however, it was back to Scandinavia to take on further coaching positions.\n\nHer relationship with the Boston Breakers led United States Women's National Team captain Kristine Lilly and fellow USWNT player Kate Markgraf joining her in the Swedish Damallsvenskan when Pia coached KIF Örebro DFF from 2005 to 2006, after a brief stint with Kolbotn IL in 2004. Lilly said she \"wanted to play for Pia again.\"\n\nSundhage served as an assistant to Marika Domanski-Lyfors for the China Women's National Team during the 2007 FIFA Women's World Cup.\n\nPia Sundhage was announced as the United States Women's National Team head coach on 13 November 2007. She became the seventh head coach in the U.S. team's history and the third woman. Lauren Gregg was in charge for 3 games in 2000, April Heinrichs led the squad from 2000–2004 and won the 2004 Summer Olympics, while Sundhage served as a scout for the United States during the 2004 Olympics.\n\nWhile at the helm of the United States, Sundhage won the 2008 Algarve Cup and Gold medals at both the 2008 Summer Olympics and the 2012 Summer Olympics. She was on the verge of winning the 2009 Algarve Cup, but the United States lost out to Sundhage's native Sweden on penalties. However, she did win the 2010 Algarve Cup a year later, defeating World and European Champions Germany 3-2 in the final.\n\nShe coached the Women's team to the final of the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup, where the team advanced to the final for the first time since 1999. However, they were upset by Japan, losing 3-1 on penalty kicks. A year later, Sundhage coached the USWNT to another gold medal at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, defeating Japan 2-1 in a Women's World Cup final rematch, with Carli Lloyd scoring both goals.\n\nOn 1 September 2012, Sundhage announced she was stepping down as the U.S Women's head coach having expressed a desire to seek opportunities in her native Sweden. Sundhage announced she would coach the U.S. team's games on 16 and 19 September on the team's Olympic victory tour before officially resigning. \"I have days where I think, 'What am I doing?' and there are other days where I'm like, 'I'm all up for this next challenge'\" Sundhage said upon announcing her departing the US women's national team. She coached her last game against Australia as part the team's Olympic victory tour on 19 September, defeating them 6-2. With this final win Sundhage was able to leave the team with a 91-6-10(Win-Loss-Tie) record that included two Olympic Gold medals and a second-place finish at the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup.\n\nThe Swedish Football Association announced early 2 September 2012 that Sundhage signed a four-year contract that starts on 1 December. The announcement came hours after Sundhage's match as coach of the U.S. women's team, an 8-0 win in a friendly match against Costa Rica; the first of a series organized to celebrate the winning of gold medal at the 2012 London Olympics. Sundhage replaced Thomas Dennerby, who resigned after Sweden failed to reach the semifinals in 2012 Olympics. \"I have long dreamed of becoming Sweden coach and now I am so happy\" Sundhage said. Sundhage's first major tournament as coach of the Sweden team was the 2013 European championship, which Sweden hosted; Sweden lost 0-1 in the semi-final to Germany, which won the championship.\n\nAfter the UEFA Women’s EURO 2017 tournament, in August 2017, Sundhage left the women's national team. In November 2017, the Swedish Football Association announced the appointment of Sundhage as the new Sweden women's national under-17 football team head coach. Sundhage took over her new duties on January 1, 2018.\n\nIn July 2019, Sundhage accepted an invitation from the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) to become the new coach of the Brazil women's national football team.\n\nIn January 2010, Sundhage mentioned in a Swedish TV interview that as a lesbian she has not felt any homophobia as a coach. \"There has been no problem for me to be openly gay as head coach in the U.S.,\" said Sundhage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll competitive league games (league and domestic cup) and international matches (including friendlies) are included.\n\n\n"}

AOML's research spans tropical cyclone and hurricanes, coastal ecosystems, oceans and human health, climate studies, global carbon systems, and ocean observations. It is one of seven NOAA Research Laboratories (RLs).\n\nAOML’s organizational structure consists of an Office of the Director and three scientific research divisions. The Office of the Director oversees the Laboratory’s scientific programs, as well as its financial, administrative, computer, outreach/education, and facility management services. Research programs are augmented by the Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies (CIMAS), a joint enterprise with the University of Miami’s Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science. CIMAS enables AOML and university scientists to collaborate on research areas of mutual interest and facilitates the participation of students and visiting scientists.\n\nThe Laboratory is a member of a unique community of marine research and educational institutions located on Virginia Key in Miami, Florida. Approximately $150M per year is invested in marine science and education among the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, NOAA's Southeast Fisheries Science Center, the Miami Seaquarium, the Maritime and Science Technology Academy (MAST Academy).\n\nThe deeper roots of AOML can be traced to the oceanographic investigations of the U.S. Coast Survey beginning in the mid-19th century under the direction of Professor Alexander Dallas Bache, great grandson of Benjamin Franklin and a preeminent U.S. science figure of the age. In subsequent decades, the urgency of charting coastal waters in support of growing commerce, a task increased by the acquisition of Alaska, Hawaii, and other island territories, came to require all the resources of the Coast Survey.\nThe modern era can be considered to have begun during the 1960s. In early 1966, an Institute for Oceanography was created, primarily from research groups of the then U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey of the Environmental Science Services Administration (ESSA, forerunner of NOAA). The following year the Institute was relocated to Miami for a variety of reasons, including the presence already in Miami of meteorological research groups of ESSA dedicated to hurricane research, and air-sea interaction was a hot topic of the time in weather research.\nAll of these groups were reorganized as the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratories (AOML) and by 1973 took occupancy in the new laboratory constructed on Virginia Key.\nEmphasis at AOML continues to be on making and interpreting observations of the ocean and atmosphere from ships, buoys, and research aircraft. The motivation and objectives of our research is continually evolving, however. In the beginning, study of the geology, geophysics, and sedimentation of the sea floor was the largest activity of the Laboratory, but it has diminished to a smaller part of ecosystem research. Research in response to concerns for marine environmental quality and large-scale physics and chemistry of the oceans related to climate variation and global change have supplemented the original themes. Research into the nature and mechanisms of hurricanes has been and is also expected to continue as a major theme in view of the importance of this natural hazard to the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States.\nNew projects include expansion of the use of satellite and locally operated remote sensing techniques to enhance the coverage and detail of observations. Outreach via electronic communication is enabling AOML to serve a larger constituency with access to oceanographic and meteorological observations.\n\nAOML conducts mission oriented scientific research that seeks to understand the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics and processes of the ocean and atmosphere, both separately and as a coupled system. The Laboratory’s research themes (oceans and climate, coastal ecosystems, and hurricanes and tropical meteorology) employ a cross-disciplinary approach, conducted through collaborative interactions with national and international research and environmental forecasting institutions. More information about AOML's research can be found at http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/research.\n\nAOML carries out interdisciplinary scientific investigations of the physics of ocean currents and water properties, and on the role of the ocean in climate, extreme weather events, and ecosystems. The tools used to carry out these studies range from sensors on deep ocean moorings to satellite-based instruments to measurements made on research and commercial shipping vessels and autonomous vehicles, and include data analysis and numerical modeling as well as theoretical approaches (http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/phod).\nAOML manages, leads, or participate in the design, implementation, maintenance, and enhancement of several key components of the global ocean observing system and, with these and other data, conducts research in several areas including:\n\nCoastal and regional ecosystem research has been a focus of AOML activities for more than two decades. Current interdisciplinary field efforts include physical, biological, and chemical studies supporting the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration (SFER) effort and the underlying health of this ecosystem to the regional Intra-Americas Sea program, as well as the status and health of coral reef ecosystems worldwide.\n\nCoastal Ecosystem related research projects:\n\nTropical meteorology research at AOML is focused on advancing the understanding and prediction of hurricanes and other tropical weather. Scientists conduct their research utilizing a combination of models, theories, and observations, with particular emphasis on data obtained with research aircraft in the inner core of tropical cyclones and their surrounding environment.\n\nHurricanes and tropical meteorology related research projects:\n\n"}

A $1.5 million electrified fence, which could cause instantaneous death for escaping inmates and which was the first of its kind among California state prisons, was installed in November 1993. After a number of birds had died by electrocution, an ornithologist was hired to help redesign the fence and eliminate the problem.\n\nAs of 1995, CAL's problems included \"double-celling\" (placing two inmates in bunk beds in a cell designed for one), psychological stress, a drastic shortage of work for prisoners, chronic understaffing among prison employees, and gang violence. A May 1995 incident in which five inmates stabbed and assaulted eight officers was described in 1997 as the worst inmate attack on staff in California state prisons in recent years.\n\nThe weather in the area is desert-like, cold in winter and very hot in summer—up to 118 degrees Fahrenheit. The smell of cow manure pervades the prison and the entire area due to large cattle feed lots nearby.\n\nAngelo Buono, Jr. (also known as the Hillside Strangler) died at CAL in September 2002 of a \"massive heart attack.\"\n\nAn August 2005 riot at CAL was the most violent uprising at the prison. The event left 25 inmates and 25 prison staff members wounded. A guard shot and killed an inmate with a Mini-14 semiautomatic rifle, which was believed to have contributed to ending the violence.

It had a population of people at the time of the .\n\nThe town is colloquially known as \"Albur\".\n\nFormerly Alburquerque had one of the longest and heaviest pythons in captivity, with a length of , weighing and with a girth of . This female python died in 2013, but the mounted creature is still exhibited.\n\n\nSince then, Segunto was changed to Alburquerque and its inhabitants are called \"Alburanons\" (\"Alburquerqueños\" in Spanish, Alburquerqueans in English).\n\nDuring the Spanish era, the way to travel around Bohol was by sea. Many coastal areas with a sheltered cove or harbor became progressive settlements. Among them was a place called \"Lo-oc\", Baclayon, Bohol. It was a sheltered cove good for berthing seacraft. It was also the breeding place of the \"Bulinaw\". Since Lo-oc was relatively far from the poblacion, the people had difficulty in attending Holy Mass on Sundays. Accordingly, they had the idea of constructing their own chapel and having a priest from Baclayon come to serve the people. Lady Mariona Irag, a prominent lady in the community took the mantle of leadership. In 1842, she requested the parish priest of Baclayon, Fr. Pedro de la Encarnacion, to supervise the construction of the chapel, a school, and a convent to be built by the people. The construction of these structures gave way to the establishment of Lo-oc as a barrio under the civil and religious jurisdiction of Baclayon and it was renamed Segunto after a town in Cataluña, Spain.\n\nThe first kapitan of the place was Pedro Jala who lived in the sitio of Carnago and was the leader of Segunto. Carnago was a barrio separated from the town. Its name was changed to Sikatuna, in honor of the chieftain Datu Sikatuna, who made a blood compact with Spanish conquistador, Miguel Lopez de Legaspi.\n\nThe town's name changed to Alburquerque following its expansion in 1861. In June 1868, Gov. General Jose de la Gandara, issued the decree establishing the new town of Alburquerque in its civil jurisdiction. In November 1868, the Fr. Provincial of the Recollects approved the creation of the town as to its religious jurisdiction. In June 1869, the Bishop of Cebu in which Bohol was a part of the diocese, made Alburquerque a separate diocesan parish under the Augustinian Recollects, dedicated to Santa Monica. In June 1869 Fr. Tomas Hernandez assumed his post as the first curate of Alburquerque.\n\nAlburquerque is located in the western part of Bohol, from Tagbilaran. The town has a total land area of which is relatively mild rolling to rolling and hilly. The land is used as built-up area , agricultural purposes , timberland , mining/quarrying , roads , and landfill site .\n\nThe central part of municipality, from the east extending toward northwest is characterized by rolling to moderately steep terrain (18-30% slope), with ground elevation ranging from amsl. The area in northeastern and southwestern part is characterized by steep terrain (30–50% slope), with ground elevation up to amsl. The southeastern part is characterized with undulating to rolling terrain (8–18% slope) with ground elevation up to amsl. The area along the coast is characterized by level to nearly level terrain (0-3% slope), with ground elevation ranging from zero near the coast to amsl inland.\n\nAlburquerque municipality is covered by hydrosol and three sorts of clay namely, faraon, bolinao and lugo clay. The northern portion of municipality is covered mostly by lugo clay, the southern half portion is mostly covered by faraon and bolinao clay, while hydrosol has a very limited extent along the coast. The municipal area is covered by grassland, coconut, shrubs and built-up area. The northern portion is mostly covered with grass, with exception of small area in the northeast, which is covered with shrubs. The southern portion along the coast is covered with coconut, with a small built-up area in the west.\n\nThe whole of Bohol is in Coronas climate type IV, characterized by rainfall evenly distributed over the year. The average annual rainfall is estimated at per year. The average annual rainfall is the sum of the average annual rainfall from respective river basin, multiplied with percentage of respective municipal area within respective river basin.\n\nSeveral small rivers and creeks, which have their headwaters in the elevated terrain in the northern part, traverse the Alburquerque municipality. These rivers and creeks generally flow in a north to south direction and drain the major part of municipality into Bohol Sea. The only major river basin is the Tagbuane River Basin situated on the eastern part of Alburquerque ( or 94.64% of municipal area). The municipality of Albuquerque has a poorly developed drainage system, due to presence of permeable limestone, which covers most of municipal area and enables infiltration of large portion of effective rainfall into underground. This is characteristic for karstified limestone terrain.\n\nSurface water runoff (estimated at ), is estimated to be on average, which is sufficient to satisfy the water demand of for irrigation purposes.\n\nThe potable water demand, including domestic, industrial, institutional and commercial water demands of urban and rural population, was estimated in 1998 to be , projected to increase to by 2030. Majority of this water demand (67.4%) in 2030 is for urban population. The water demand estimated at , is required to irrigate of land in brgy Ponong.\n\nAlburquerque comprises 11 barangays, of which six are characterized as coastal (Bahi, San Agustin, Western Poblacion, Eastern Poblacion, Sta Felomina, and Tagbuane) and five as upland (Ponong, Toril, Basacdacu, Cantiguib and Dangay). Furthermore, the urban population is located in three barangays namely, East and West Poblacion and Ponong.\n\nAt the 2000 census, Alburquerque had a total of 8,715 inhabitants, with a population density of of land and an average population growth rate of 2.66% per annum. The population increased to in the census, with population density of .\n\nAlburanons speak in Cebuano/Visayas dialect.\n\nAlburquerque has an average annual income of Php 27,431,496. The town has a labor force of 37% with an employment rate of 90%. The average family income is Php 4,500/month with an average family expenditures of Php 4,000/month.\n\nThe town's major agricultural project is the \"\"Gintong Ani\"\" project in all barangays. One industry is situated in Eastern Poblacion - the Santisima Trinidad Ice Plant. There are 66 micro-type and 2 cottage-size registered business establishments with total combined investments of Php 1.5 million. The existing tourists destinations are Sta Monica stone church and convent, Sta Fe beach resort, calamay making, ceramics making, salt making, loom weaving, basket and broom-making. The potential attractions are Tarsiers Park, Lourdes Spring, Aquarium Fish, Butterfly Sanctuary.\n\nHousehold weaving takes place in barangay Basacdacu. Buri cloth is made from local young buri leaves for export to Cebu. Midribs of the buri palm leaf are sold for basket making, and bundles of bure stems (pawa) to Tagbuane barangay for broom-making.\n\nSeveral households use strips of older buri leaves to make spear-head-shaped fans and smaller fans of that they sell in Cebu. There are 50 households in the area making brooms from buri stems and bamboo poles.\n\nSalt-making is another source of income for some Alburanons. Production begins when the upland farmers plow their fields for rice production. This is because the \"\"asinderos\"\" salt-makers trade their salt for rice in a barter system, and salt production takes about as long as the growth of the rice it will be exchanged for.\n\nThe pottery-making enterprise is located beside the main road in East Poblacion. Clay is dug from a pit near the sea, and mixed with silicate soil before being ground through the large rollers of an electric mill, in a pit beside the pottery works. This is mixed with water and molded into pots of various sizes and shapes on a potter's wheel.\n\nThe municipality of Alburquerque has natural wonders and micro local industries like the making of calamay, traditional method of manufacturing pottery, and the weaving of raffia using locally made loom.\n\nThe Municipal Marine Sanctuary, established in 2000 at brgy Sta Felomina where the beach and the Mangrove Protected Area are located, is set up in the area selected to be fit for the purpose due to its coral cover. The sanctuary contributed to rising fish stocks and corals that had been destroyed by illegal fishers. Bamboo rafts have been put in place to observe the marine ecology. It has been considered as a dive site of the municipality for local and foreign tourist visiting the place. Other activities include trekking up to Tagbuane River passing through a Forestal Reserve Zone.\n\nUntil March 2012, Alburquerque was the home to a female python 17 years old with a length of approximately and an estimated weight of about . It was the biggest python in captivity ever known. The python named Prony was Albuquerque's star and was owned by Sofronio Salibay. \n\nThe Animal Kingdom Federation, Inc. (AKFI), an SEC registered, non-profit and non-stock animal welfare organization registered with the Animal Welfare Division of the Bureau of Animal Industry in coordination with the LGU Alburquerque built an animal sanctuary in Albuquerque. The AKFI made this commitment after hearing reports that the then long python was being fed with stray dogs.\n\nThe reports caught the attention of many local and foreign tourists. It even caught the attention of GMA 7 who sent a crew to document the procedure. Alarmed by the reports, AKFI requested mayor Efren Tungol to stop Salibay from feeding the python with dogs since it is a clear violation of Republic Act No. 8485, otherwise known as the Animal Welfare Act. The mayor agreed. However, in order to preserve the python, which has become a tourist attraction, AKFI, represented by its director Charles Wartenberg, sealed a memorandum of support and cooperation with the municipality creating the site as an animal sanctuary. The memorandum, aside from manifesting full implementation of RA 8485, also reiterates the improvement of the cage based on animal welfare standards and introduction of alternative feeding. Creating an animal sanctuary would make Alburquerque the only Animal Welfare Friendly municipality in the country. AKFI is also associated with the International Wildlife Coalition Trust (IWCT), an internationally recognized organization founded in the United States dedicated to the protection of global wildlife and natural habitat protection.\n\nIn March 2012, Prony was relocated to another sanctuary in brgy Laya, Baclayon, after the owner failed to secure the required permits and licenses from the Local Government of Alburquerque.\n\nSome sources say the parish had its beginning as a \"visita\" in 1842 when a chapel was built under the direction of the parish priest of Baclayon. The parish advocated to Santa Monica was canonically established on 18 June 1869, following royal approval given on November 1868. During the Spanish colonial era, the Augustinian Recollect friars administered the parish.\n\nUp to the 1880s, the parish church was more like a huge shed. Although it boasted three aisles, its walls were only of tabique. The present church of coral stone was commenced shortly afterwards, utilizing the same three-aisled plan. However, the upper portions, especially the tower over the façade, were completed during the first half of this century. On examination it becomes clear that the link between the church and the \"casa parroquial\" was planned along a grander scale, but never finished. The grotto at the back of the courtyard between the two structures hides a ruin which may be of another unfinished arcade.\n\nRay Francia signed the church's interior ceiling painting on one side of the choir loft. Another section, now vanished, showed that the painting was carried out from 12 April to 3 August 1932. As regards the church bells, amongst them in the quadrangular tower are three bells, inscribed with the patron saints of the parish (Santa Monica, San Agustin, and \"Calipay\" or Joy). Dated 1866, two years before the ecclesiastical recognition of the parish, the bells are testimonies to the anxiety of the community in becoming an independent parish.\n\nAs to the \"casa parroquial\", the year 1876 is etched over the porta maior. However, in the center of the entrance arches to the steps, the year 1884 could be read until recently.\n\nThe church was severely damaged in the 2013 earthquake.\n\nAlburquerque's road network is classified into:\nIt has one bridge, the 39 L.M. Bridge to brgy Tagbuane. The power supply is currently distributed by the Bohol Electric Cooperative I (BOHECO I) which served a total of 1,281 households in the 11 barangays. The main source of potable water supply is groundwater. The total potable water demand of per day.\n\nThe municipality has one local port situated in Western Poblacion, which serves local fishermen as well as other fishing vessels and cargo vessels in transporting equipment and raw materials from other neighboring provinces. It is fitted with proper lighting and equipment. The municipal LGU as well as the barangay officials ensure the safety, peace and order situation and proper maintenance of the port.\n\nOne of the biggest projects of the present administration is to provide its constituents with a sufficient potable water supply. Almost 80% of the barangay in the municipality currently has water connections.\n\nEnsuring quality education to the people is also one of the top concerns of the local officials. The LGU assisted in determining and developing appropriate actions that would address the educational needs of the Alburanons in terms of budgetary allocations, maintenance of facilities and policies concerning education.\n\nAlburquerque has one public secondary school, San Roque High School. It has four elementary schools for intermediate level and three primary schools. It has also a total of 11 day care centers, one center in each barangay and one private pre-school. The number of teachers in the municipality is only 63 and the teacher student ratio in elementary is 1:24 and 1:43 in secondary level.\n\n"}

{"id": "2086994", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2086994", "title": "Anda, Bohol", "text": "Anda, Bohol\n\nAnda, officially the Municipality of Anda, (; ), is a 5th class municipality in the province of Bohol, Philippines. According to the 2015 census, it has a population of 16,462 people.\n\nIn 2006, the Anda red hermatite print petroglyphs of Bohol were included in the tentative list of the Philippines for UNESCO World Heritage Site under the name of \"Petroglyphs and Petrographs of the Philippines\", which also includes the Singnapan charcoal-drawn petrographs of southern Palawan, Angono Petroglyphs of Rizal province, Alab petroglyphs of Mountain province, and charcoal-drawn Penablanca petrographs of Cagayan.\n\nThe decree on the separation of Quinale from Guindulman did not explain why the name \"Anda\" was chosen. It was presumed that the name referred to Governor General Simón de Anda y Salazar who was Governor General of the Philippines from 1769-1770. Simon de Anda was a member of the Royal Audiencia in the Philippines who did not surrender to the British in 1762. But considering a century gap between de Anda and the time of the town's creation and also taking into account the poor literacy of the populace at that time, the naming of the town after him may not be the case. A more acceptable reason from oral history, is that \"Anda\" is a reference to the land that moves forward, as in Spanish \"el lugar anda\" – the land walks or moves. This was a rough attempt to translate \"Quinale\" into Spanish. The word \"quinale\" or \"gui kale\", is a colloquial local term for a pile of sand dunes caused by the waves enhancing a new land mass. Hence, Anda, which means \"it walks.\"\n\nThe first inhabitants of the area were migrant Negritos, who were eventually replaced by Austronesians coming from Butuan. The new migrants established the red hematite petrographs in the Anda peninsula and would become a sacred site for ethnic communities. During the first half of the 16th century, the Sultanate of Ternate ransacked the area, along with the communities of western Bohol, specifically, the Kedatuan of Dapitan. When the Spanish arrived during the later half of the 16th century, the Anda communities were easily subjugated as they have already been ravaged by the Ternate people.\n\nThe municipality of Anda was formerly known as Quinale and was a barrio of the municipality of Guindulman from the early part of its civilization up to the later decades of the 19th century. At the onset, Quinale was basically uninhabited with plenty of uncultivated lands and its shores were swampy with many mangroves and hardwood trees.\n\nThrough the years the population of Quinale grew and the people sought independence from Guindulman. On 8 July 1856 they petitioned for independence and the petition was endorsed by the Assessor General of the government to the Governor General of the Philippines on 3 September 1856. Yet their petition was denied for the reason that they could not meet the required number of 500 tributes or taxpayers.\n\nUndaunted, they again petitioned to become an independent town on 30 December 1872. The petition was addressed to the Provincial Governor of Bohol and endorsed by him to the \"Consejo de Administracion de Filipinas (Council for Administration of the Philippines), the Father Provincial of the Recollects and the Archbishop of Manila\".\n\nThe town has progressed at that time. Public buildings and their church were improved and roads created leading to Guindulman. But in spite of these developments, their petition was again denied on the grounds that their total taxpayers reached only 400.\n\nStill persistent, Quinale again filed their petition on 27 March 1874 which was subsequently declined because of the same reason, lack of taxpayers. A few months later, on 23 September 1874, the people again made another petition but now used a different approach and reasoning.\n\nThey were denied for the same reasons yet they pointed out that births in the town of Quinale far exceeded the number of deaths but the people migrated to other places because of lack of supervision and opportunities. To answer this need, the officials wanted their barrio to be made into a town to have proper supervision and leadership. With these, the people would not leave and the number of taxpayers would surely reach 500.\n\nProvincial politico-military governor Don Joaquin Bengoechea (June 1872 – 1878), was amenable to their line of reasoning and suggested that the people make a petition for separation of Quinale in the civil aspect only since the requirement of 500 taxpayers was for becoming a separate parish. So the 23 September 1874 petitioned for becoming a town in the civil aspect only.\n\nMore than six months passed before the Consejo de Administration finally recommended that Quinale be separated in its civil aspect only. Delay was due to the religious authorities' reluctance to approve it.\n\nFinally on 12 March 1875, the governor general Don Jose de Malcampo y Monje issued the decree creating the new town of Anda and its being separated from the town of Guindulman in civil aspect only, consonant with the desire of the religious authorities. Confirmed by the archbishop of Manila, the order of the separation was published on 1 April 1875.\n\nWith this approval, the local officials of the new town of Anda and the mother town of Guindulman gathered to discuss and determine the boundaries of the two towns on 3 May 1875. With the decree, the people were still given the opportunity to till their lands wherever they may be located, in Anda or Guindulman.\nAs the new town now being established with its defined boundaries, a practical concern of the local officials arose: they had no knowledge of running the local government. Hence they requested an educated person from the mother town of Guindulman to assist the local officials run the local government. That person was Pablo Juliano Castro an illegitimate son of a Spanish priest in Guindulman who had had a privileged education in Manila. He was given a prime lot in the center of the town, near the proposed Municipal Hall and the proposed school building. Pablo Castro not only acted as advisor of the local administration but also acted as the first Justice of Peace and Anda's first school teacher. He served some time later also as the town's \"Capitan Municipal\" or town's chief executive at the turn of the century.\n\nSubsequent years saw Anda's growth in terms of population. People did not migrate any more and eventually the number of taxpayers increased until they qualified to be a separate town in the religious aspect. On 18 July 1885, Anda became an independent parish from Guindulman and become a diocesan parish on 19 March 1885, dedicated to the Santo Niño or the Holy Child. Royal approval was given on 6 January 1885 and finally implemented on 18 July 1885 with Fr. Julian Cisnero as the first Parish Priest.\n\nThe line of Spanish priests serving the parish of Anda was not broken from 1885 up to 1937, even after the end of the Spanish regime and through the American era. At the end of the Spanish regime, many Spanish priests fled but not Fr. Hilario Lopez. Even after the American era, priests from the Order of the Augustinian Recollect continued to serve the people until 1937. The last Spanish priest was Fr. Luis Llorente.\n\nAnda comprises 16 barangays:\n\nDuring the Spanish period the town chief executive was called \"\"Capitan Municipal\"\", then some time during the American regime, the title was changed to \"\"Presidente Municipal\"\". It was only during wartime time that the town chief executive was called a \"Municipal Mayor\".\n\nIn the earliest time, the town chief executive was chosen by drawing of lots among prominent persons of the town, those considered to have ample land properties and adequate education. The sequence or order of tenure of the early town executives could not easily be determined. It was only during the American regime that regular elections were held every three years, and then later reduced to four years. For a short period from 1986 to 1988, right after the EDSA Revolution, there were no elections for mayor but only officer-in-charge to act as mayor \"ad interim\".\n\n\"Capitan Municipal\" (from 1885 to 1919):\n\n\"Presidente Municipal\" (from 1919 to 1934):\n\nMunicipal Mayor (from 1938 up to the present):\n\n\n"}

The Mag-Aso falls, whose cascading waters run into natural pools, were greatly altered by the 2013 Bohol earthquake and even more so by flash floods caused by Tropical Storm Seniang in December 2014.\n\nThe early inhabitants of the area were the Eskaya people, who lived in western Bohol, including the lowlands of Antequera at the present barangay of Viga, from the 7th century until the early 17th century. One legendary Eskaya leader was King Lomod or Tamblot, who raised a revolt against the Spanish conquistadors.\n\nOriginally the town was a barangay of Maribojoc known as Agad. Migration from surrounding coastal areas increased the population and created many new sitios. On 17 March 1876, the Governor-General of the Philippines signed a decree that made Agad and all its sitios a new municipality. That same year, the governor of the district of Bohol, Joaquin Bengoechia, enacted the law that finalized the boundaries and appointed its first mayor, Simeon Villas.

Its original name was Bacayan, from the root word \"bacay\", meaning \"detour\" in reference to the fact that travellers used to make a detour there around a rocky cliff.\n\nIn 1595, two Jesuit priests, Juan de Torres and Gabriel Sanchez, arrived in Bohol to convert the local populace to Catholicism. With native help, they built a stone church which is considered as one of the oldest stone churches in the Philippines, and marked the beginning of the town. In 1600, Moros raided the fledgling settlement, which prompted the Jesuits to relocate their \"residencia\" to Loboc.\n\nIn 1717, Baclayon gained status of a parish. In 1742, Tagbilaran was separated from Baclayon, followed by Alburquerque in 1868, Balilihan in 1828, and Corella in 1884.\n\nBaclayon is directly east of Tagbilaran, the provincial capital.

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nIt is located northeast of Tagbilaran through Cortes (via CPG North Avenue), or northeast through Corella (via J.A. Clarin Street). It has the fourth largest land area of the province, with 127.27 km (49.14 sq. mi) of land.\n\nThe place is a panorama of verdant hills, rugged mountains and green fields. It is said to have been so named because of the grass \"\"balili\"\" which grew in abundance.\n\nBefore the beginning of the 19th century, Balilihan was a barrio of Baclayon and an old settlement. When the Dagohoy revolt was suppressed by the Spaniards, the authorities established a garrison in Datag (one of its barrios) to discourage and stamp out further uprisings on the part of the natives. When Balilihan was separated from its mother town on 29 September 1828, the Spanish government formally established a settlement or \"pueblo\" in the sitio \"\"Bay sa Iring\"\" (named so for the network of caves where cats hide) which was about from the Spanish garrison.\nLater, due to the scarcity of water, the seat of government was transferred to its present site which is amply supplied with water from various springs. The elevated land also made a good viewing point to keep watch over all nearby towns. Thus the construction of a Spanish belfry similar to the watch towers of the shores atop the hill. This tower is made of adobe stones gathered from the rock deposits of Baclayon. It was erected in the year 1835. It was inaugurated in 1846 \"gobernadorcillo\". In 1888, Friar Benito Grayoa, who at that time exercised control over local governments, ordered the transfer of the municipio to Cabad, a barrio west of the poblacion. The padre's plan met vigorous opposition from the people and through the able leadership of Capitan Bartolome Racho, they filed the protest before the Spanish Military Governor Linares who disapproved the proposal causing Friar Grayoa's ire who then plotted for the consequent punishment of the captain by dragging him with the friar's horse through the streets causing his death in jail. Fearing reprisals from the clergy, some of the people migrated to Surigao, Leyte and Misamis. Not long afterwards, Friar Grayoa was transferred to Siquijor.\n\nThe Spanish era flourished with the construction of Spanish church at the foot of the Spanish watchtower where a large patio became the hall for social affairs and the friar's convent a school for the cartilla, with the municipio across. With the guidance of the local appointed leaders under the control of the Spanish friar, the town slowly progressed peacefully until the outbreak of the revolution in 1898.\n\nOn 12 November 1900, American soldiers were known to be coming from Antequera. All officials of the town led by Capitan Antonio Racho came out to meet the soldiers with a brass band, but when the Americans arrived, they gathered all the officials in the municipal hall building and placed them under guard, for the Americans had heard that the town officials had been supporting the insurgents. The supplications of spokesman Segundo Racho not to burn the town was of no avail and the sounds of the welcoming brass band turned into volleys of gunshots. The officials were ordered to move towards Sevilla while the civilians ran for safety to the outskirts of the town. The town was razed to the ground. The Americans burned the church, the convent, the municipal building, the school building for boys and girls as well as private houses. The only structure that was spared was the belfry on the top of the hill.\n\nIn 1904, there was a move to fuse Balilihan with Antequera in order to meet the requirements of a municipality under the American regime. The people objected to the plan, so the following year the Philippine Commission finally ruled in its Act. No. 350 abolishing the municipality of Catigbian and instead annexing it to Balilihan as one of its barrios.\n\nDuring World War II, the town residents went into hiding in their mountain hideouts for fear of the Japanese. Balilihan was a haven of refugees from other places who lived a life of privation in the mountains. Many innocent civilians were either tortured or put into death by the enemies on mere suspicions of guerilla activities. Ex-mayor Patricio Ibarra was put up by the people as war time mayor to defend them from their enemies.\n\nThe Japanese atrocities gave rise to the organizations of the guerrillas into full combat force under the supreme command of Mayor Ismael Ingeniero. The people helped the guerilla movement by feeding the troops in the front lines as well as those in the headquarters in Behind the Clouds, in Maitum which was the famous concentration camp of the war. Enemy collaborators were tried here and those found guilty of high crimes were liquidated. Those with slight offenses were imprisoned for the duration of the war. Another concentration camp was at Hanopol where prisoners were kept.\n\nIn 1948, Balilihan suffered a great loss of territory when the biggest barrio (Catigbian) was given its town charter in spite of the strong representation against the move by town mayor Balbino Chatto and Gerardo Racho who personally went to Malacañang to see President Elpidio Quirino.\n\nBalilihan comprises 31 barangays:\n\nThe municipality of Balilihan holds its annual town fiesta every 16 July in honor of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, however, other barangays (Hanopol - comprising 10 barangays) celebrate their fiesta in honor of their patron Santo Niño de Cebú on the 16 January. Balilihan holds its fiestas every 6 months. Another celebration takes place during the last week of September, this gives way for making 29 September of every year as a non-working holiday in Balilihan.\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nBatuan is from Tagbilaran, and is located in the interior part of the island. It is accessible via the Tagbilaran–Loay–Carmen national road or the Tagbilaran–Balilihan–Batuan provincial road. It marches with Sagbayan to the north, with Bilar to the south, with Carmen and Valencia to the east, and with Catigbian and Balilihan to the west.\n\nBatuan covers a total area of comprising fifteen barangays as per the Municipal Comprehensive Development Plan for 1983–1992. However, a certification of the land area of Batuan, issued by ARED for operations, DENR Regional Office Region No. 7 Cebu City on 26 November 2001 at the instance of the LGU in connection with its Comprehensive Land Use Plan (CLUP) preparation work, showed a land area of only , but that included only eleven barangays and excluded four—Quirino, Aloja, Behind the Clouds and Garcia.\n\nLocated within the province's tourist area, Batuan is the gateway to the Chocolate Hills, being only about from the Chocolate Hills complex in Carmen.\n\nThe town of Batuan, Bohol celebrates its fiesta on July 25, to honor the town patron Saint James.\n\nThis interior town used to be a barrio of Bilar during the Spanish regime and was called Lindugon. During the early years of American regime this barrio was made into a municipality by Act No. 968 dated Oct 31, 1903 that provided the following: “The Municipality of Batuan shall consist of the territory of the barrio of Batuan in the present Municipality of Bilar, with the seat of the municipal government at the present barrio of Batuan.” (Acts of the Philippine Commission, Vol. XIV. Washington: Government Printing Office, 1904).\n\nBatuan became a separate municipality through the efforts of some local leaders, such as Manuel Decasa, Alejandro Barril, Victor Tiongson, among others, who were put behind bars for strongly advocating the movement to cede Batuan from its mother town Bilar, and its subsequent creation as a distinct and separate town. Notwithstanding, those leaders pursued their aspirations after release from prison. Municipality of Batuan was created, originally comprising only five barangays namely: Lindugon, Cambacay, Rosariohan, Janlud and Cantigdas; but today comprising fifteen.\n\nThe early years of local administration saw its seat at Lindugon, now Poblacion Vieja. In 1911 however, the Municipal Hall, the seat of local government, was transferred to sitio Tinagacan for reasons of accessibility. Eventually, the parish church was also relocated to its present site at the Poblacion.\n\nBatuan got its name from edible fruit with the same name, which grew galore in the locality. Today though these trees can hardly be found in the area.\n\nDuring the Japanese occupation, Batuan was a haven of evacuees from the provinces of Cebu, Leyte and from other parts of the island/province. It was at the Batuan Central School site where the unification of the guerilla forces of Bohol was forged on 29 June 1942, paving the way for the creation of the Bohol Area Command (BAC) under the command of Major Ismael Ingeniero, whose election was hotly contested by rival factions. The command had its headquarters in brgy Behind the Clouds. Major Ingeniero and his force played a pivotal role in the Battle of the Visayas and capture of Bohol.\n\nLike most of the municipalities of the province, the climate in Batuan falls within Coronas climate type IV, characterized by not very pronounced maximum rainfall with a short dry season from one to three months and a wet season of nine to ten months. The dry season starts in February and lasts up to April sometimes extending to the middle of May. The heaviest rainfalls are from June to August. It is usually cold during the night in the area. Batuan is generally out of the typhoon belt area and very seldom experiences typhoons.\n\nThe entire area of Batuan is covered by two sedimentary rock formations: Maribojoc Limestone, occupying , % of its total land area, and Carmen formation, occupying , %.\n\nDominant slope of the area is 30 – 50% covering an estimated area of , % of its total land area, with , % in the 0 - 3% category (more or less level).\n\nBatuan is entirely within the Loboc River Basin. Two tributaries of Loboc river – the Pagbathan and the Bayog – flow east–west into the main river course.\n\nBasically, Batuan is an agricultural town as more than half of its total land area is devoted to agriculture, about or %. This is the main source of livelihood in the locality where a great portion of its income is derived from crop production, livestock and poultry raising. Rice and corn are the principal crops grown in the area. Coconut, fruits root crops and leafy vegetables come next. Despite the absence of effective irrigation facilities, (% of agricultural land) are devoted to rice production, with an average production of 60 cavans per hectare. (%) are devoted to corn production. Coffee and cacao are among the industrial crops grown in the locality. Just launched by the LGU is the Fish Culture Farming program designed to encourage smallholders to develop small backyard fishponds to address the scarce supply and high costs of fish in the area.\n\nBatuan comprises 15 barangays:\n\nBatuan's working age or economically active population age 15-64, comprises 58% of its total population, while its dependent population, aged and 65 years and above, comprises 42%.\n\nBatuan has a total road network of about of which are barangay roads, are provincial roads, national and municipal roads. While the entire national road network is of either concrete or asphalt surface, only about (%) of its municipal roads, and about (%) of its barangay roads are concrete with the larger portion still earth and / or gravel. 98% of its provincial roads are gravel.\n\nCommercial and trading transactions in Batuan gravitate to the urban area, considered the town's Central Business District. However, commercial and trading activities in the area are brisk. Commercial activities in Batuan pass through a network of various commercial establishments. Sari-sari stores are the most common. Other are bakeries, eateries, drugstores, farm and poultry stores, and hardware stores. Service providers in the area include iron works, welding shops, repair shops, furniture factories & communication facilities. Among the ubiquitous industries of Batuan are the rice and corn mills located mainly in the Poblacion areas. Other than those, industrial activities are minimal.\n\nAlthough Batuan is only about from the Chocolate Hills complex, tourism activities in the municipality are very few. There are no facilities and establishments that cater to the needs and wants of the industry. Batuan also has the Camanayon Mountain.\n\nThere are eighteen learning institutions in Batuan of which nine are primary schools, six elementary schools, one public school and one private high school, providing secondary education. Batuan Colleges, a privately owned college school offering technical and short courses in a close tie-up with TESDA, has been in operation since mid2000s.\n\nAll barangays have their Day Care centers where services are provided by day care workers on a regular basis, a program financially supported by the LGU aside from other programs like supplemental feeding, emergency assistance, and burial assistance.\n\nThe Municipal Health Office (MHO) is staffed by one doctor, five midwives, a nurse, a medical (laboratory) technologist, a sanitary inspector, and a dentist who reports only twice a week due to budget constraints. A team of Barangay Health Workers has been organized in all barangays to help facilitate and speed up the delivery of basic health services even in the remote areas. There are only three Barangay Health stations in the whole area. An ambulance is on stand-by for emergency uses.\n\nFor the maintenance of peace and order in the area, the LGU has a local PNP station headed by a police chief with junior PNP personnel, equipped with some high-powered firearms and one patrol car. The local PNP force is assisted in this regard by tanod members of each composite barangay as far as law and order are concerned at barangay level. The LGU however has neither existing or available personnel nor equipment for fire protection purposes.\n\n\n"}

Graham (April 13, 1925 – December 31, 1995) was a U.S. Army officer. Graham was born in Portland, Oregon and grew up in Medford. He attended college at the United States Military Academy at West Point, the army's Command and General Staff College, and graduated in 1946. He also attended the U.S. Army War College and ultimately rose to the rank of lieutenant general in the United States Army. Graham served in Germany, Korea, and Vietnam and received several decorations including some of the highest the United States military bestows: the Distinguished Service Medal, the Legion of Merit with two oak leaf clusters, and the Distinguished Intelligence Medal during his distinguished 30-year military career.\n\nFrom 1963–1966, Graham worked for the CIA in the Office of National Estimates. During the Vietnam war from 1967-1968 he was chief of the army's military intelligence estimates.\nGraham served again in the Office of National Estimates during 1968–1971, then served as director of collections for the Defense Intelligence Agency in 1971. During 1973–1974 Graham served as deputy director of the CIA under Director William Colby and from 1974–1976 he was the director of the DIA. Ronald Reagan called upon General Graham to be his military advisor for his 1976 and 1980 campaigns. General Graham is a member of the Military Intelligence Hall of Fame.\n\nIn later years, Graham devoted a lot of time to the research and development of Single-Stage To Orbit (SSTO) spacecraft in conjunction with NASA. McDonnell Douglas was awarded a contract to build an SSTO test vehicle on August 16, 1991, and named it the DC-X for Delta Clipper Experimental. The name honored the firm's successful Thor/Delta rocket and recalled the famous 19th-century commercial clipper ships. The McDonnell Douglas SSTO team saw the Delta Clipper as opening the \"space trade routes in the same way that the Yankee Clipper ships opened the sea trade routes.\" The needs of the commercial launch industry thus were integral to the thinking of the McDonnell Douglas DC-X team. General Graham envisioned the DC-X as the perfect inexpensive launch and delivery vehicle for his proposed Brilliant Pebbles space-based ballistic missile defense shield.\n\nThe first test launch of the DC-X was on August 18, 1993. The test flight verified flight control systems and vertical landing capabilities and was deemed a success after reaching a 46 m altitude in a 59-second flight. The second flight on September 11, 1993 tested ascent and landing mode control and ground effects survey, reaching 92 m in a 66-second flight. The third test flight on September 30, 1993 demonstrated 180 degree roll and provided aerostability data while reaching 370 m during 57 second flight. Unfortunately, this marked the last test of first series as the vehicle was mothballed when SDIO funding ran out.\n\nOn June 20, 1994, the DC-X rose once again for the first flight of second series after additional SDIO funding was received. Operating with a full propellent load, the flight tested the radar altimeter in control loop and reached an altitude of 870 m during a 136-second flight. Demonstrating an unplanned event on June 27, 1994, the DC-X became the first unmanned vehicle to save itself when an in-flight abort occurred after a gaseous hydrogen explosion. The vehicle demonstrated autoland its capabilities after reaching an altitude of 790 meters during a 78-second flight. After repairs were made, the DC-X continued expansion of the flight envelope on May 16, 1995, demonstrating constant angle of attack after reaching an altitude of 1330 m during a 124-second flight. Graham was elated and continued to work closely with the program. Graham would not live to see the full glory of the DC-X program. He died in December 1995.\n\nOn Friday, June 7, 1996 at White Sands, New Mexico, the second series vehicle designated DC-XA was successfully launched. It flew to a height of 485 meters (1,600 ft) and then moved horizontally 105 meters (350 ft) before safely landing. After that flight, NASA officials announced that the DC-XA had been renamed the \"Clipper Graham.\" The next day, June 8, 1996, to demonstrate the quick-turnaround capability of the rocket, the Clipper Graham soared into the skies over the old White Sands Missile Range to a height of 3,120 meters (10,300 ft) and stayed in the air for over two minutes before landing. That flight was the highest and longest the vehicle had ever flown until then.\n\nRobert A. Heinlein dedicated his 1985 novel The Cat Who Walks Through Walls to \nGraham and eight of the other members of the Citizens' Advisory Council on National Space Policy.\n\nGraham was chairman of the American Space Frontier Committee, the Coalition for the Strategic Defense Initiative, and in 1978 he became co-chairman of the Coalition for Peace through Strength.\n\nAfter retiring from the army, Graham's goal was to promote a defense against nuclear weapons. The father of seven, said he felt it was unconscionable to fail to protect the American public against nuclear attack. Also, as a student of military history, he was keenly aware that no weapon was abandoned until a defense made the weapon obsolete.\nIn 1981 Graham founded High Frontier, Inc., a private organization that promotes a kinetic-energy weapons approach to space-based defense with help from members of President Ronald Reagan's \"Kitchen Cabinet\".\nAccording to Graham, he is considered by most to be the actual originator of the Strategic Defense Initiative concept. However, the plan as put forward by Reagan also included an emphasis on directed energy technologies such as lasers and particle beams, in addition to the cheaper, \"off the shelf\" kinetic energy technologies promoted by Graham and High Frontier.\n\nThe Strategic Defense Initiative Organization was renamed by President Bill Clinton to the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization on May 13, 1993 and continues today. \n\nHe was also a member of the American Freedom Coalition and was vice chairman of the U.S. Council for World Freedom, and served on the advisory board of a Unification Church sponsored anticommunist association, CAUSA- USA.\n\nGeneral Graham was also an unsuccessful Republican candidate for the Arlington County, Virginia, Board of Supervisors after his retirement from the military \n\n\"As you know, Dan, you and I were talking about missile defense before you set up High Frontier in September of '81...You and a small group of dedicated, determined people helped us move the SDI concept over all the roadblocks put up by people of less vision and belief in American capacity. God bless you!\"—President Ronald Reagan, March 1993\n\nHe died of cancer at his home in Arlington, Virginia on Sunday, December 31, 1995 at the age of 70 and was buried at Arlington National Cemetery with full military honors.\n\n"}

A total of 2,120 were built and they worked on railroads across the world, including Africa, Asia, all of Europe and South America.\n\nDuring the 1930s, the United States Army Transportation Corps approved an update of a Baldwin Locomotive Works World War I design, in contingency for war transportation, to create the S159 Class. During the period of World War II, when America was neutral, the government of Franklin D. Roosevelt approved the Lend-Lease supply to the United Kingdom of the S200 Class, designed specifically to fit into the restricted British loading gauge.\n\nWith America's entry to World War II, the USATC needed a developed design from which to create a volume of locomotive power for the wrecked railways of Europe, which they could use to deploy military hardware and civilian goods. Hence, the design created by Maj. J. W. Marsh from the Railway Branch of the Corps of Engineers, learnt from both previous locomotives, designed on austerity principles and built, using methods which created efficient and fast construction speed over long life, such as axlebox grease lubricators and rolled plates preferred to castings.\n\nWith cast frames (a few had frames flame cut from rolled steel slabs) and cast wheels, the front two driving axles were sprung independently from the rear two driving axles, to allow for running on poor quality track. The larger tender layout was derived from the similar design for the WD Austerity 2-8-0, with the coal bunker inset above the water tank to improve visibility when running backwards.\n\n800 locomotives were constructed in 1942/3 in thirteen batches, split between ALCO, Baldwin and Lima Locomotive Works. Shipped to South Wales and dispatched from the GWR locomotive depot at Newport, Ebbw Junction, the first 43 locomotives were transferred to the LNER Doncaster Works for completion, and later running in over the East Coast Main Line. This started a pattern whereby each of the four British railway companies eventually deployed a total of 400 S160's under the guise of \"running in,\" but factually replacing damaged stock and increasing the capacity of the British railway system to allow for shipping of military pre-invasion equipment and troops. The eventual deployment of S160's were:\n\n\nThe second batch of 400 S160's were prepared for storage by USATC personnel at the Great Western's Ebbw Junction locomotive depot in the immediate run-up to D-Day. After the D-Day invasion of Normandy, the locomotives deployed across Britain again began to be collected and be refurbished at Ebbw Junction in preparation for shipment to Europe.\n\nThe S160's were designed for quick and efficient building, not long-term operations, thus compromises in design led to some difficulties in operation. The axle-box grease-lubricators were not very efficient, particularly when maintenance procedures lapsed or were delayed for operational war reasons, and so axle-boxes often ran hot. Braking was poor by modern standards, with a Westinghouse steam brake used for the locomotive, which was woefully insufficient, due to the long distance from the driver's valve to the brake cylinder.\n\nA major fault of the S160 was use of a single water gauge of a Klinger design, unfamiliar to U.K. crews. If the valves were not fully open, the crews could be misled into thinking that the water level was adequate, even though it was becoming dangerously low. When a low water condition allowed the crown sheet to overheat, the stay bolts holding the crown sheet would fail with little warning, resulting in a boiler explosion. In a space of ten months, three UK S160s suffered a collapse of the firebox crown, with the first leading to the death of a GWR fireman on No. 2403 in November 1943. Although there are claims that the stay bolts or firebox design were less than for domestic locomotive boilers, the locomotives were equipped with a \"(b)oiler built to comply in all aspects with the A.S.M.E. Boiler Code, except that the shell shall have a factor safety of 4.\"\n\nJudging accurately the actual deployment of 2120 locomotives is difficult, but the following numbers are referenced:\n\nThe British locomotives, together with those shipped direct from America were also similarly deployed first with troops reclaiming Europe, and then subsumed throughout European national railways as replacements for their destroyed stock after the war:\n\nAt the same time as S160s were being deployed into Britain, when General Patton led American troops in Operation Torch into the North African Campaign, their Transport Corps brought the S160s with them. These locomotives moved across the north of the continent as Patton's troops waged war, and when the troops moved to Italy the majority of their S160s moved up with them. These locomotives, supplemented with those directly imported from America, were eventually to create a group of 243 locomotives, subsumed by the Italian State Railway's to become the FS Class 736 class.\n\n\n\nAfter World War II, the reconstruction of the world required transportation. The S160s were deployed to Asia under the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, to China and South Korea.\n\n\nAlthough \"S160\" has been popularly adopted as the class identification for this design of War Department Consolidation, it can not be verified as an official designation despite considerable research. The S160 designation is not found in 1942 and 1943 Baldwin drawing indexes, the Lima drawing index for the class, nor in meeting minutes in which representatives of the War Department and the three builders made several design decisions prior to production. It is also not found in any of approximately 900 engineering drawings which are still in existence. The Baldwin designation for the design, 2-8-0-19S, is found in their drawing indexs, on some drawings, and is stamped onto major locomotive components on examples built by Baldwin.\n\nThere were several major variants of the S160 class, excluding in-life design development:\n\nMainly due to their numbers, rather than the design or build quality, at least 26 examples of the S160 have survived into preservation, making them one of the most numerous survivors of all Mainline Steam Locomotives:\n\n"}
{"id": "2087034", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2087034", "title": "Blue Army of Our Lady of Fátima", "text": "Blue Army of Our Lady of Fátima\n\nThe Blue Army of Our Lady of Fátima, now mostly known as the World Apostolate of Fátima, is a public international association of the Christian faithful that has as its general purpose \"the promotion of the authentic teaching of the Roman Catholic Church and the strict adherence to the tenets of the Gospel; the personal sanctification of adherents through faithful adherence to the Message of Our Lady of Fátima and the promotion of the common good by the spreading of that Message of Fátima\".\n\nThe Blue Army was founded in 1946 by Rev. Fr. Harold V. Colgan, parish priest of St. Mary of Plainfield, New Jersey (USA).\nFather Colgan had fallen seriously ill and was hospitalized. During his illness he prayed to Our Lady of Fátima that if she should cure him he would spend the rest of his life spreading devotion to her. He attributed his recovery to his prayers and began preaching to his congregation on a regular basis about the Virgin Mary.\n\nHe summed up the message of Our Lady's apparition as this:\n\nHis message was highly successful; however, he wanted to make more of a lasting impression upon his congregation, and so he added two further items of his own invention. The first was a signed promise that one would try to uphold these values and the second was to wear a blue ribbon or blue medal in order to remember the promise. This was also a success and the congregation all enrolled. It was then that Fr. Colgan began to think about extending this to other parishes and other nations. Thus was born the Blue Army, from Colgan's own words: \"We will be the Blue army of Mary and Christ, against the red of the world and of Satan.\"\n\nFr. Colgan began preaching his message and gained success, especially with the assistance of writer John Haffert who began delivering conferences on the message of Fátima and the Blue Army. Colgan then went to the Vatican in May 1947 to meet Pius XII in order to present his project for approval from the Pontiff. The foundation of the International Blue Army took place at the House of Pontevedra, Spain, where Mary is said to have appeared to request Communion of Reparation every First Saturday. Currently, there are over 20 million members.\n\nThe World Apostolate of Fátima has its world headquarters in the \"Domus Pacis\" (\"House of Peace\"), a pilgrim guest house in Fátima, Portugal. While the Blue Army was founded in 1947, because of its rapid spread around the world, it became necessary to erect a new society. The Decree of Erection of the World Apostolate of Fatima was signed on 7 October (the Feast of the Holy Rosary), 2005. Then on 3 February 2006, the World Apostolate of Fátima held an official ceremony for the consignment of the decree and the approval of its statutes at the Pontifical Council for the Laity in Rome.\n\nThe Apostolate is broken up into prayer cells which are found in parishes throughout the world. These cells fall under state and national Apostolate centers which in turn are subordinate to the International Secretariat based at Fátima in the \"Domus Pacis\". The International Secretariat exists in order to coordinate the activities of the organization throughout the world and to carry out the policy decisions of the Board of Trustees, an elected group of nine members of the Apostolate who represent various regional centers of the Apostolate. They meet once a year to discuss the internal affairs of the Apostolate.\n\nMembership in its most basic sense is through making a Pledge promising the following:\n\n\nThe official pledge of membership is:\nI pledge myself to Our Lady and wish, thereby, to join the World Apostolate of Fátima.<br><br>\nDear Queen and Mother, who promised at Fátima to convert Russia and bring peace to all mankind, in reparation for my sins and the sins of the whole world, I solemnly promise to Your Immaculate Heart:<br><br>\nI shall renew this promise often, especially in moments of temptation.\nThe daily offering mentioned, is traditionally the following:\n\nO my God in union with the Immaculate Heart of Mary \"(here kiss the brown scapular)\". I offer Thee the Precious Blood of Jesus from all the altars throughout the world, joining with it the offering of my every thought, word and action of this day.\n<br><br>\nO my Jesus, I desire today to gain every indulgence and merit I can and I offer them, together with myself, to Mary Immaculate – that She may best apply them to the interests of Thy Most Sacred Heart. Precious Blood of Jesus, save us! Immaculate Heart of Mary, pray for us! Sacred Heart of Jesus, have mercy on us!\nThus are delineated the primary devotions of the World Apostolate. These are the devotions mandated by the Blessed Virgin Mary during the Apparitions at Fátima. Traditionally this pledge is printed, and signed by the person who desires membership. It is also traditional that this signed pledge is then sent to the international headquarters in Fátima where it is then taken and buried near the shrine there.\n\nAside from the daily offering, recitation of the rosary, the wearing of the Brown Scapular of Our Lady of Mount Carmel and the five Saturdays in honor of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, the Apostolate also recommends to its members the practices of nine first Fridays in honor of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, Home Enthronement of the Sacred Heart, and family consecration to the Sacred Heart of Jesus and the Immaculate Heart of Mary.\n\nA further practice associated with the World Apostolate is the Pilgrim statue of Our Lady of Fátima. There are several designated \"pilgrim statues,\" however the primary one is the international pilgrim statue which has traversed the globe several times since its sculpting in 1947 by José Ferreira Thedim. The purpose of the statue is to renew interest in Catholic parishes in the message of Fátima, and to stir up affection to Our Lady.\n\nThe National Blue Army Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima, in Washington Township (Warren County), New Jersey, is located on and rises over the Muscontecong Valley. It hosts more than 50,000 pilgrims annually.\n\nThe Symbol of the apostolate consists of a pair of doves forming an image of praying hands holding a rosary. These are then surrounded by an image of a brown scapular, containing the words in Latin \"Orbis Unus Orans\", (One World Praying) the motto of the Apostolate. All of these surmounted on a blue disc, blue being the symbolic liturgical color of the Virgin Mary in the Catholic Church.\n\nIn 1996, John Haffert (co-founder of the Blue Army of Our Lady of Fatima) spoke about Fatima and his book \"Meet the Witnesses\" in which he personally interviewed nearly 200 witnesses to the Fatima Miracle, describing their detailed witness accounts.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2087053", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2087053", "title": "Ruger P series", "text": "Ruger P series\n\nThe Ruger P series is a line of centerfire semi-automatic pistols made by Sturm, Ruger & Company produced from 1985 to 2013. The P-series pistols were designed for military, police, civilian and recreational use. The designs are largely based on the Browning action found in the M1911 pistol, but with minor variations, generally related to the safety mechanism and the barrel-camblock interface. Reviews have considered them rugged, reliable, and strong, though this strength comes at the price of bulk and a blocky appearance.\n\nThe P-series pistols are short recoil–operated, locked breech semi-automatic pistols. They use a SIG P220 type locking system, and an M1911-style tilting barrel. The P series were made with a traditional double-action/single-action (DA/SA), or double-action-only (DAO) trigger mechanism.\n\nThe standard models have an ambidextrous manual safety/decocker located on the slide; when the safety lever is lowered to the safe position, the firing pin is cammed into the slide away from the hammer, the trigger is disconnected from the sear, and the hammer is decocked. The decocker models have no manual safety; instead, when the lever is lowered, it only cams the firing pin into the slide and drops the hammer. When the lever is released, the firing pin springs back to the normal position. The DAO models have no manual safety or decocker. All models feature an automatic firing pin safety that blocks the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully rearward.\n\nThe pistols make extensive use of investment-cast parts and proprietary Ruger alloys. Nearly all internal parts, including the barrel, are stainless steel, while the slide and ejector are carbon steel. The P85 through P944 use an investment-cast aluminum frame, while the P95 and later models use a fiberglass-reinforced polyurethane frame.\n\nThe 9 mm and .40 S&W versions use double-column box magazines; the 9 mm has a 15-round capacity, and the .40 has a 10-round capacity. The .45 ACP versions use single-column magazines holding seven or eight rounds (depending on the model). All P-series pistols of the same caliber use a similar magazine design, but slight modifications have been made to at least the 9 mm guns so that not all P-series magazines will function in all P-series frames. Ruger did not keep track of the magazine models so an older magazine may not secure in a newer frame. The Ruger Police Carbine also uses P-series magazines. The P-series pistols have an ambidextrous magazine release located behind the trigger guard; it can be pushed forward from either side to eject the magazine.\n\nThe early-model P95s have fixed, three-dot sights; newer P95s, P97s, and P345s have three-dot sights adjustable for windage.\n\nThe P85 was originally developed as a replacement alternative for the U.S. Military's 1984 Joint Service Small Arms Program, a venture to replace the aging M1911A1 to a higher-capacity, more reliable, NATO-compliant weapon. The P85 met all of the military's requirements, including a 20,000-round life expectancy. Despite this, the P85 was not completed in time for the first two trials. It was, however, able to compete in the later XM10 trials in 1988, for which Ruger supplied 30 P85s to the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland. Despite performing well, the Beretta M9, which had succeeded at winning the previous two competitions, won once again and was awarded the contract. Nonetheless, the Ruger P85 did find success with some police departments and civilians, as its rugged design and military qualities did see it adopted by the San Diego Police Department and the Wisconsin State Patrol.\nThe P-85 was also adopted by the Turkish National Police. \n\nThe P85 was developed in 1985, but was not available until 1987. It was only available with a DA/SA trigger, decocker, and a manual safety. The P85 was affordable, initially retailing for just $295, about $100 cheaper than its nearest competitors.\n\nThe Ruger P85 is a full-sized DA/SA alloy-framed service pistol originally designed to compete in the 1984 U.S. military pistol trials. Unfortunately the design wasn't finalized until after the trials. Luckily, the P85 found popularity on the civilian and law enforcement markets but many were recalled after one incident with the firing pin, resulting in a discharge. If the firing pin broke in front of the firing pin block, applying the safety, which dropped the hammer, could transfer enough energy to the broken firing pin to cause a discharge. The P85 was recalled, and a new safety was installed that prevented contact between firing pin and hammer during a decocking operation. This modification was done free of charge. This updated P85 was christened as the P85 MK II in 1989. Other updates included larger safety levers, and improved accuracy. The P85 MK II was produced for several more years, until 1992. By then the P89 was in production (having been introduced the previous year), which is essentially just a re-branded P85 MK II. After the P89 was introduced, there was no longer a need to produce the P85 and it was discontinued.\n\nThe P89 is an upgraded P85 MKII that introduced a number of new features, including a DAO model. Like the P85, all P89s came with an investment cast aluminum alloy frame. In 1992, Ruger produced a limited-run P89X convertible model, which came with a second barrel and recoil spring assembly that allowed conversion between 9 mm and .30 Luger calibers. Ruger only made 5,750 with both barrels in 1994 only. The P89 was one of the most popular and plentiful P-series models. It was discontinued in late 2009.\n\nThe P90 is a scaled-up version of the P89 chambered in .45 ACP with an investment cast aluminum alloy frame. It was introduced in 1991 as the company's first attempt at a .45 ACP pistol, and was in direct competition with SIG Sauer's P220, Smith & Wesson's 4500 series, and to a lesser extent Glock's G21 that came out the same year. The P90 is considered to have above-average accuracy for its price. The P90 was produced until 2010.\n\nThe Ruger P91 is essentially a Ruger P89 chambered in .40 Smith & Wesson. Like its precursors, it also had an investment cast aluminum alloy frame. It was only produced for two years, from 1992 to 1994. \n\nThe P93 was developed in 1993 but not released until 1994. The P93 was designed as a compact version of the Ruger P89 and, as such, still had the investment cast aluminum alloy frame, though the frame was slimmer than that of the P89 and it omitted some unnecessary parts. It was designed for shooters interested in lighter weight or easier concealability. The P93 lacks the flared nosepiece of the P89 and also features different grips with heavier checkering. Standard capacity was either 15 or 10 rounds. The P93 has a barrel that utilized a dropping link like the P89. A larger number of P93s than other variants were also double action-only without an external safety, due to its intended concealed carry market. The P93 was discontinued with the P94 in 2004.\n\nThe Ruger P94 is a mid-sized, slightly larger variant of the P93. The P94 has a long barrel as opposed to a barrel and still has the investment cast aluminum alloy frame. Like the P93, the P94 was introduced in 1994. The P94 features different grips with heavier checkering. The P94 has a full length “streamlined” slide configuration and is chambered for the 9mm Parabellum (9 mm x 19) cartridge, while the P944D is chambered for the .40 S&W cartridge.\n\nThe P94 was discontinued in 2004, ten years after its introduction. However the P944D variant was produced until 2009.\n\nIntroduced in 1996, the P95 incorporated a number of changes from earlier P-series pistols, including a shorter barrel like the P93. The big change was switching the frame construction from an investment cast aluminum alloy to a new high-impact polymer frame made of fiberglass-reinforced polyurethane, based on Dow Chemical's \"Isoplast\". The P95 was also the first pistol in the series to omit the dropping link underneath the barrel. The first P95s came with a glossy black polymer frame with a hooked trigger guard and lacking an accessory rail and grip texture. Later model P95s featured a matte polymer frame with enhanced grip texturing, an accessory rail and a round trigger guard. The P95 was one of the last in the series to be fully discontinued. Most P95 designs were discontinued in 2004 and 2005, but certain types of the P95 were produced until 2009 and 2013.\n\nThe P97 is essentially a P95 chambered in .45 ACP, similar to the P90. The P97 feeds from a single-stack .45 ACP magazine, the same magazine used in the P90. It was only available in decocker only and double-action only versions. It featured an adjustable rear sight and retained the same glass-filled polymer frame of the P95. The front sight is pinned in, and the rear held in by a set screw. Unlike the P95, however, the P97 never got the improved frame with added grip texture and an accessory rail and retained the original smooth frame. The P97 was manufactured from 1999 to 2004.\n\nThe P345, released in 2004, is a transition model between the P series and the SR series. The P345 is chambered in .45 ACP and accepts the same single stack magazines as the P90 and the P97. The P345 features a radically different design (as it was intended to usher in Ruger's new pistol designs) and incorporates an integrated keyed lock that locks the safety in the safe position, a loaded chamber indicator, and a magazine disconnect that blocks the firing pin when the magazine is removed. It also has many ergonomic improvements, such as a new polymer frame design (narrower than the double column derived P95 and P97) and low-profile safety levers. It does not feature an ambidextrous slide release or magazine release. Both controls are designed for a right-handed shooter. The model P345PR adds a Picatinny rail to the frame, for mounting lights and other accessories. It was designed to be legal for sale in states that require elaborate safety measures. The P345 was discontinued in 2013 and replaced by the new SR45.\n\nColin Ferguson used a P89 to murder six people and wounded nineteen others in the 1993 Long Island Rail Road shooting.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2087055", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2087055", "title": "Erethism", "text": "Erethism\n\nErethism, also known as erethism mercurialis, mad hatter disease, or mad hatter syndrome, is a neurological disorder which affects the whole central nervous system, as well as a symptom complex, derived from mercury poisoning. Erethism is characterized by behavioral changes such as irritability, low self-confidence, depression, apathy, shyness and timidity, and in some extreme cases with prolonged exposure to mercury vapors, by delirium, personality changes and memory loss. People with erethism often have difficulty with social interactions. Associated physical problems may include a decrease in physical strength, \"headaches, general pain, and tremors after exposure to metallic mercury\" as well as an irregular heartbeat. \n\nMercury is an element that is found worldwide in soil, rocks, and water. People who get erethism are often exposed to mercury through their jobs. Higher risk jobs include construction, industrial work, and working in factories. Some elemental and chemical forms of mercury (vapor, methylmercury, inorganic mercury) are more toxic than other forms. The human fetus and medically compromised people (for example, patients with lung or kidney problems) are the most susceptible to the toxic effects of mercury.\n\nMercury poisoning can also occur outside of occupational exposures including in the home. Inhalation of mercury vapor may stem from cultural and religious rituals where mercury is sprinkled on the floor of a home or car, burned in a candle, or mixed with perfume. Due to widespread use and popular concern, the risk of toxicity from dental amalgam has been exhaustively investigated. It has conclusively been shown to be safe. \n\nHistorically, this was common among old England felt-hatmakers who had long-term exposure to vapors from the mercury they used to stabilize the wool in a process called felting, where hair was cut from a pelt of an animal such as a rabbit. The industrial workers were exposed to the mercury vapors, giving rise to the expression \"mad as a hatter\". Some believe that the character the Mad Hatter in Lewis Carroll's \"Alice in Wonderland\" is an example of someone suffering from erethism, but the origin of this account is unclear. The character was almost certainly based on Theophilus Carter, an eccentric furniture dealer who was well known to Carroll.\n\nAcute mercury exposure has given rise to psychotic reactions such as delirium, hallucinations, and suicidal tendency. Occupational exposure has resulted in erethism, with irritability, excitability, excessive shyness, and insomnia as the principal features of a broad-ranging functional disturbance. With continuing exposure, a fine tremor develops, initially involving the hands and later spreading to the eyelids, lips, and tongue, causing violent muscular spasms in the most severe cases. The tremor is reflected in the handwriting which has a characteristic appearance. In milder cases, erethism and tremor regress slowly over a period of years following removal from exposure. Decreased nerve conduction velocity in mercury-exposed workers has been demonstrated. Long-term, low-level exposure has been found to be associated with less pronounced symptoms of erethism, characterized by fatigue, irritability, loss of memory, vivid dreams, and depression (WHO, 1976).\n\nEffects of chronic occupational exposure to mercury, such as that commonly experienced by affected hatters, include mental confusion, emotional disturbances, and muscular weakness. Severe neurological damage and kidney damage can also occur. Neurological effects include Korsakoff's dementia and erethism (the set of neurological symptoms characteristically associated with mercury poisoning). Signs and symptoms can include red fingers, red toes, red cheeks, sweating, loss of hearing, bleeding from the ears and mouth, loss of appendages such as teeth, hair, and nails, lack of coordination, poor memory, shyness, insomnia, nervousness, tremors, and dizziness. A survey of exposed U.S. hatters revealed predominantly neurological symptomatology, including intention tremor. After chronic exposure to the mercury vapours, hatters tended to develop characteristic psychological traits, such as pathological shyness and marked irritability (box). Such manifestations among hatters prompted several popular names for erethism, including \"mad hatter disease\", \"mad hatter syndrome\", \"hatter's shakes\" and \"Danbury shakes\".\n\nEspecially in the 19th century, inorganic mercury in the form of mercuric nitrate was commonly used in the production of felt for hats. During a process called carroting, in which furs from small animals such as rabbits, hares or beavers were separated from their skins and matted together, an orange-colored solution containing mercuric nitrate was used as a smoothing agent. The resulting felt was then repeatedly shaped into large cones, shrunk in boiling water and dried. In treated felts, a slow reaction released volatile free mercury. Hatters (or milliners) who came into contact with vapours from the impregnated felt often worked in confined areas.\n\nUse of mercury in hatmaking is thought to have been adopted by the Huguenots in 17th-century France, at a time when the dangers of mercury exposure were already known. This process was initially kept a trade secret in France, where hatmaking rapidly became a hazardous occupation. At the end of the 17th century the Huguenots carried the secret to England, following the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. During the Victorian era the hatters' malaise became proverbial, as reflected in popular expressions like \"mad as a hatter\" (see below) and \"the hatters' shakes\".\n\nThe first description of symptoms of mercury poisoning among hatters appears to have been made in St Petersburg, Russia, in 1829. In the United States, a thorough occupational description of mercury poisoning among New Jersey hatters was published locally by Addison Freeman in 1860. Adolph Kussmaul's definitive clinical description of mercury poisoning published in 1861 contained only passing references to hatmakers, including a case originally reported in 1845 of a 15-year-old Parisian girl, the severity of whose tremors following two years of carroting prompted opium treatment. In Britain, the toxicologist Alfred Swaine Taylor reported the disease in a hatmaker in 1864.\n\nIn 1869, the French Academy of Medicine demonstrated the health hazards posed to hatmakers. Alternatives to mercury use in hatmaking became available by 1874. In the United States, a hydrochloride-based process was patented in 1888 to obviate the use of mercury, but was ignored.\n\nIn 1898, legislation was passed in France to protect hatmakers from the risks of mercury exposure. By the turn of the 20th century, mercury poisoning among British hatters had become a rarity.\nIn the United States, the mercury-based process continued to be adopted until as late as 1941, when it was abandoned mainly due to the wartime need for the heavy metal in the manufacture of detonators. Thus, for much of the 20th century mercury poisoning remained common in the U.S. hatmaking industries, including those located in Danbury, Connecticut (giving rise to the expression the \"Danbury shakes\").\n\nAnother 20th-century cohort of affected hatmakers has been studied in Tuscany, Italy.\n\nThe experience of hatmakers in New Jersey is well documented and has been reviewed by Richard Wedeen. In 1860, at a time when the hatmaking industry in towns such as Newark, Orange and Bloomfield was growing rapidly, a physician from Orange called J. Addison Freeman published an article titled \"Mercurial Disease Among Hatters\" in the \"Transactions of the Medical Society of New Jersey\". This groundbreaking paper provided a clinical account of the effects of chronic mercury poisoning among the workforce, coupled with an occupational description of the use of mercuric nitrate during carroting and inhalation of mercury vapour later in the process (during finishing, forming and sizing). Freeman concluded that \"A proper regard for the health of this class of citizens demands that mercury should not be used so extensively in the manufacture of hats, and that if its use is essential, that the hat finishers' room should be large, with a high ceiling, and well ventilated.\" Freeman's call for prevention went unheeded.\n\nIn 1878, an inspection of 25 firms around Newark conducted by Dr L. Dennis on behalf of the Essex County Medical Society revealed \"mercurial disease\" in 25% of 1,589 hatters. Dennis recognized that this prevalence figure was probably an underestimate, given the workers' fear of being fired if they admitted to being diseased. Although Dennis did recommend the use of fans in the workplace he attributed most of the hatters' health problems to alcohol abuse (thus using the stigma of drunkenness in a mainly immigrant workforce to justify the unsanitary working conditions provided by employers).\n\nSome voluntary reductions in mercury exposure were implemented after Lawrence T. Fell, a former journeyman hatter from Orange who had become a successful manufacturer, was appointed Inspector of Factories in 1883. In the late nineteenth century, a pressing health issue among hatters was tuberculosis. This deadly communicable disease was rife in the extremely unhygienic wet and steamy enclosed spaces in which the hatters were expected to work (in its annual report for 1889, the New Jersey Bureau of Labor and Industries expressed incredulity at the conditions—see box). Two-thirds of the recorded deaths of hatters in Newark and Orange between 1873 and 1876 were caused by pulmonary disease, most often in men under 30 years of age, and elevated death rates from tuberculosis persisted into the twentieth century. Consequently, public health campaigns to prevent tuberculosis spreading from the hatters into the wider community tended to eclipse the issue of mercury poisoning. For instance, in 1886 J. W. Stickler, working on behalf of the New Jersey Board of Health, promoted prevention of tuberculosis among hatters, but deemed mercurialism \"uncommon\", despite having reported tremors in 15–50% of the workers he had surveyed.<ref name=\"Stickler1896/1887\"> (Cited in Wedeen, 1989) (Cited in Wedeen, 1989)</ref>\n\nWhile hatters seemed to regard the shakes as an inevitable price to pay for their work rather than a readily preventable disease, their employers professed ignorance of the problem. In a 1901 survey of 11 employers of over a thousand hatters in Newark and Orange, the head of the Bureau of Statistics of New Jersey, William Stainsby, found a lack of awareness of any disease peculiar to hatters apart from tuberculosis and rheumatism (though one employer remarked that \"work at the trade develops an inordinate craving for strong drink\").\n\nBy 1934 the U.S. Public Health Service estimated that 80% of American felt makers had mercurial tremors. Nevertheless, trade union campaigns (led by the United States Hat Finishers Association, originally formed in 1854) never addressed the issue and, unlike in France, no relevant legislation was ever adopted in the United States. Instead, it seems to have been the need for mercury in the war effort that eventually brought to an end the use of mercuric nitrate in U.S. hatmaking; in a meeting convened by the U.S. Public Health Service in 1941, the manufacturers voluntarily agreed to adopt a readily available alternative process using hydrogen peroxide.\n\nAlthough the expression \"mad as a hatter\" was associated with the syndrome, the origin of the phrase is uncertain. \n\nLewis Carroll's iconic Mad Hatter character in \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" displays markedly eccentric behavior, which includes taking a bite out of a teacup. Carroll would have been familiar with the phenomenon of dementia among hatters, but the literary character is thought to be directly inspired by Theophilus Carter, an eccentric furniture dealer who did not show signs of mercury poisoning.\n\nThe actor Johnny Depp has said of his portrayal of a carrot-orange haired Mad Hatter in Tim Burton's 2010 film, \"Alice in Wonderland\" that the character \"was poisoned ... and it was coming out through his hair, through his fingernails and eyes\".\n"}

It was similar to and a parallel development of the U.S. Army Air Corps’ land-based P-39 Airacobra, differing mainly in the use of a tailwheel undercarriage in place of the P-39's tricycle gear. Only one prototype was manufactured.\n\nThe XFL-1 (Bell Model 5) was powered by a single 1,150 hp (858 kW) Allison XV-1710-6 twelve cylinder, two bank Vee, liquid-cooled engine installed amidships behind the pilot and driving a three-bladed Curtiss Electric propeller in the nose through a 10.38 ft (3.16 m) extension shaft. The aircraft had provisions for a single 37 mm (1.46 in) Oldsmobile T9 cannon which could be replaced by a .50 in (12.7 mm) Browning M2/AN machine gun firing through the propeller shaft and two .30 in (7.62 mm) machine guns in the fuselage nose. It first flew on 13 May 1940.\n\nAlthough based on the P-39, the XFL-1 utilized a conventional tail-wheel undercarriage and the coolant radiators were housed externally in fairings under the wings instead of within the wing center section. The Allison engine was the first of its type to be tried out by the Navy, and lacked the turbosupercharger fitted to the XP-39.\n\nIn January 1938, the U.S. Navy issued a specification for a light carrier-based fighter to replace the obsolete biplanes then in use. On 11 April 1938, Bell, Brewster, Curtiss, Grumman, and Vought-Sikorksy submitted proposals but only three received contracts. Two of them were awarded contracts for one prototype each on 30 June 1938; these were for the Grumman XF5F-1 Skyrocket and the Vought XF4U-1 Corsair. The third contract, which was signed on 8 November, went to Bell Aircraft for one XFL-1 Airabonita. All three aircraft made their first flight in 1940: the XF5F-1 on 1 April, the XFL-1 on 13 May, and the XF4U-1 on 29 May.\n\nSubsequent tests were prolonged because of difficulties with the Allison engine and problems with the balance of the aircraft. Official evaluation began in July 1940 but the XFL-1 failed to be certified for carrier operations because of main landing gear problems. The prototype was returned to Bell for modifications in December 1940 and returned to the Navy on 27 February 1941 at Naval Air Station Anacostia, District of Columbia. Based on the test results, the Navy decided not to order production of the aircraft.\n\nIn February 1942, the XFL-1 was transferred to the Aircraft Armament Unit at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland. It was later grounded, used for armament tests, and later destroyed. For many years its remains were visible at the dump at NAS Patuxent River.\n\nAs a possible further reason for the rejection, it is often stated that the Navy's position during that era was that all its aircraft should use air-cooled engines (while the Allison was liquid-cooled). This appears unfounded speculation. The U.S. Navy \"would consider a liquid-cooled engine installation provided a material increase in performance over air-cooled engine can be shown.\"\n\nIn addition, the Allison engine had only a single-speed supercharger. Consequently, its altitude performance was much inferior to other naval fighters of the period, such as the Grumman F4F Wildcat. \n\nLastly, the Airabonita had to compete against the faster though not \"light\" Vought F4U Corsair, which in the initial F4U-1 version was capable of 390 mph at 24,000 ft.\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nThe town fiesta is held every 16 January in honor of the holy child Jesus, the Santo Niño.\n\nThe history of Cortes dates back to pre-Hispanic times – there already was a form of government way before the coming of the Spaniards. The town was known as \"Malabago\" after its chief, who was a contemporary of King Lomod, otherwise known as Tamblot – the first Boholano to raise arms against the Spanish conquistadors.\n\nThe Malabago settlement was situated in the upland territory of the present day Cortes near the Abatan River while that of Tamblot was at barangay Viga in the lowlands of Antequera which stretches to the riverside valleys opposite that of Malabago beyond the present day Abatan Bridge. The people of Malabago have a culture of their own and recorded their day-to-day activities in their own writing using unique characters which they carved out on a piece of bamboo using a knife called \"panggi\" or \"supok\". Malabago then was a farming community that cultivated the land and made rice paddies in the north and east lowlands.\n\nTamblot's reign started in early 1600 AD and the uprising in 1621 was triggered when a Spanish priest want to take back a silver church bell (\"Lingganayng Ugis\") which he gave to Tamblot in order to put it up in a church he built at Malabago. Tamblot resented such a move; refused to give the bell back and so started the feud between him and the Spaniards. Supporting Tamblot during the uprising, the Malabago settlement was destroyed by the Spaniards in 1621.\n\nThe settlement was transferred to Bahian which was also destroyed by the Spaniards. Again the people settled at Ylaya at the upper part of the river. Not accessible by boats, the people had to berth near the mouth of the river which they eventually called as \"\"Dayhangan\"\", meaning \"berthing place\".\n\nThe people chose to live near the mouth of the river and along the swamps. Their main livelihood was to catch fish, so the new settlement was called \"Pamingwitan\" ('a place where one can catch fish using a fishing rod'). In 1793 or 94, an independent parish was established.\n\n\"Pamingwitan\" was renamed \"Cortes\". The town was probably established in 1862 during the construction of the Catholic church with the settlements of Malabago, Pamingwitan and Dayhangan jointed into one and called \"Pueblo de Cortes\". Toponymy suggests: \n\nThe parish was dedicated to the Santo Niño. The inhabitants of the town were baptized and given instructions in the Catholic faith. Although the church was built in 1880, the bell tower's upper register was completed only in the 20th century. A boys' school building was constructed in 1895.\n\nThe town of Cortes played a prominent role during World War II. The inhabitants of the town formed a bolo battalion to fight the Japanese Invaders. Yet in 1942, the town was overwhelmed by the Japanese; houses were burned down and the school building was occupied and used as a garrison. Cortes was liberated from the Japanese a few days after the arrival of the Americans in Tagbilaran on 11 April 1945. In less than a month, the whole province of Bohol was officially declared liberated on 25 May 1945, by Major General William H. Arnold, Commander of the Americal Division.\n\nIt is about northeast of Tagbilaran. Its nearest neighbor along the national highway to the north is the town of Maribojoc. Located high up on a plateau, the town occupies a total land area of .\n\nCortes comprises 14 barangays:\n\nMedium of discourse is usual Visayan (Cebuano), but English is the medium of instruction in all schools in the town starting from the primary grades. People also understand Filipino.\n\nThe people of Cortes in majority are Roman Catholics. \n\nCortes is the site of the southern Industrial Projects and its subsidiary, Rolling Mills, which produces colored and non-colored galvanized iron for roofing. Rolling Mills is situated high up on a plateau overlooking the Abatan River.\n\nThe town is known for its handmade paper and papercrafts, similar to washi, but made with indigenous fibers.\n\nThe town is also known for handmade paper products chosen now as the town's priority product under the Department of Trade and Industry's One Town, One Product (OTOP) Program. Aside from the manufacturing and handicraft industries, the people of Cortes are also into agribusiness.\n\nSand taken from the Abatan River, and which usually finds its way to construction sites in Tagbilaran, is likewise another source of income for the people of Cortes. Flat-bottomed boats made of marine plywood carry the sand which has to be dug up from the river bed with waist-high waters – back-breaking work for those involved.\n\nThe Local Government Unit (LGU) of Cortes is also developing eco-tourism. One major project is the development of the docking port, envisaged to be the starting point for cruises on the Abatan River, which flows through five towns.\n\nOther projects include the establishment of daycare centers in each of the town's 14 barangays. Health stations will also be constructed. The nine sources of water supply are now installed with automatic chlorinator injection system to insure the health of residents. A reservoir will also be constructed in De la Paz.\n\nThe town of Cortes has several tourism sites that yet need further development in order to attract foreign tourists.\n\nThe Bacong River Heritage Conservation Tour for paddling and river trekking enthusiasts has been set up. Other sites such as the Larga Vista, an old stone building and the municipal hall are must-see.\n\nThe Abatan River is one of its natural assets. The river winds through the town of Antequera and from the town of Balilihan for an estimated length of . It opens at the Cortes nipa swamp, the most extensive nipa swamp in Bohol.\n\nIn former days when roads were scarce, the river served as a waterway for the people to and from the interior towns. Now, the government has seen its potential for tourism after the success of the Loboc River tours and it is now being developed.\n\nKayak exploration and stand-up paddle boarding are now available and can be arranged.\n\nThe church of Cortes is the Santo Niño parish church. It is situated high up on a hill and like all Bohol churches is cruciform shape. The church dates back to the 19th century although the bell tower's upper register was not completed until the 20th century.\n\nThe church is made up of cut coral stone blocks. A portico is in front of an older façade and floral carving frames the doorway. It has frescoes on its ceilings. The main \"retablo\" has twisted Solomonic columns and profusely carved flanges in the baroque idiom.\n\nBilibili Spring is another site envisioned for development by the local government for it will be the first stop of the proposed river cruise. The spring is located in Malayo Norte.\n\n"}

Except that of a lake, all definitions of danao describe the municipality of Danao, with freshet being the most likely meaning. A freshet is either a sudden rise or overflow of a stream or river, or freshwater stream emptying into the sea.\n\nThe Isumod river flowing near the town center of Danao may suddenly overflow and inundate a large portion of the town. The river joins the Wahig river and empties into the sea.\n\nIn the beginning, Danao is part of Inabanga, when the latter became a town in 1724. In 1744, Francisco Dagohoy (Sendrijas) established the First Bohol Republic at Caylagan Cave (now \"Francisco Dagohoy Cave\") in barangay Magtangtang, located northwest of the present-day \"Poblacion\". Magtangtang became the seat of government and headquarters of the independent Bohol that lasted for more than 85 years.\n\nIn 1830, Talibon became an independent pueblo from Inabanga, and Danao was annexed to it. During the first US sponsored Census, Danao is listed as one of the barrios of Talibon with a recorded population of 585 in 1903.\n\nIn 1953, the town of Victoria (now \"Dagohoy, Bohol\") was established and 5 barangays namely Cantubod, Danao, Hibale, Santa Fe, and Santo Niño were carved out from Talibon through Executive Order No. 634 by President Elpidio Quirino to form a new municipality together with other 13 barangays in Carmen, Sierra Bullones, Trinidad, and Ubay. However, after only less than 3 years of existence, Victoria was reorganized and became the new municipality of Dagohoy. The 5 barangays were reverted back to Talibon through Executive Order No. 184 by President Ramon Magsaysay and upon the recommendation of the Provincial Board of Bohol. \n\nFinally, on March 14, 1961, Danao became an independent municipality through Executive Order No. 422 by President Carlos P. Garcia. Sixteen (16) barangays from municipalities of Talibon, Inabanga, and Carmen with the seat of government at barangay Danao were organized into a new town.

Information revealed that the well was constructed through manual digging using bolos, crowbars, pulleys, and rope for digging into the soil stones, which contains limestone rock.\n\nThe first bridge between poblacion of Dauis and Mansasa, Tagbilaran was constructed by Spaniards during their reign, possibly in the 18th century. The bridge is still there and in place, used as a connection between the two islands. The other bridge was constructed near the old City Hall of Tagbilaran City, crossing towards Totolan. That bridge is known as 'the causeway' and leads as far as Panglao Beach resort about from Tagbilaran.\n\nDauis is located in the northern part of Panglao Island.\n\nDauis comprises 12 barangays:\n\nThe town's 18th-century church, is dedicated to \"La Señora de la Asuncion\" or Our Lady of the Assumption. The church is believed to have been built of light materials by the first Spanish missionaries in 1697. Since then, the church has gone through several changes.\n\nThe image of the \"La Señora de la Asuncio\" is famed to be miraculous. Faithfuls come from near and far to hike the distance from the city to the site to invoke special petitions or mainly to honor the Patroness. In addition, at the foot of the altar of the church is a well also believed to have healing power. The water tastes fresh, despite the well's proximity to the seashore.\n\nThe town and all devotees of the \"La Señora de la Asuncion\" attend the Patroness' feast day every 15 August. Stories abound of the Patroness' sojourn and blessings. One of the stories tells of a man who found a \"camiseta\" (blouse) in his fishing boat after a lady passenger disembarked. On several occasions, devotees found the Patroness' \"camiseta\" full of amorseco. Many believe the Patroness must, on occasions, get down from her pedestal to visit them in their homes and farms. To this day, devotees continue to venerate and pay homage as manifestation of gratitude and appreciation after being healed of their ailments through the \"camiseta\".\nAnother fiesta is celebrated last Sunday of January, to commemorate a miracle that happened many years back. It is said that many young girls have seen the lady waving her hands as if bidding them to come near.\n\nDauis's major tourist attractions are Our Lady of Assumption Church and Hinagdanan Cave. Our Lady of Assumption Church is locally known as Señora de la Asunción. The church was built by Boholanos under forced labor imposed by the Spanish.

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nThe town of Guindulman, Bohol celebrates its feast on the first Saturday of September, to honor the town patron Our Lady of Consolation.\n\nIn the olden days, names of certain places were sometimes ascribed to some usual or common incidents or occurrences as is the case with the town of Guindulman. The place was originally called Guinduluman, from a vernacular expression which means \"something or somebody who is overtaken by darkness\".\n\nThere is no official record to show how the town really got its name. However, folklore has it that during the early part of the Spanish era in the Philippines, there were only two formally organized towns along the southeastern and eastern coastal borders of Bohol, namely, Jagna and Batuanan (now known as Alicia). Because of the distances, travelers starting from either of these towns in the early morning were sure to be overtaken by nightfall before reaching the next place; hence the name \"guinduluman\".\n\nFolklore further says that the early condition of the area itself had something to contribute to the appropriateness of the term because the center of the town was once surrounded and almost entirely shaded by a dense forest which also made the town dark even during daytime. Travelers from other places passing through this thick forest could observe its surrounding darkness because the sunlight could hardly penetrate through the thick foliage, thus causing darkness in the area at any time of the day. Such actual condition of the particular place, therefore, gave added significance to the created name.\n\nIt is hard to fix a definite date when this town was established as official records were destroyed during the war. However, Francisca Libres Piezas cited in her compilation that the town of Guindulman was already established before the Tamblot Rebellion of 1622. So Guindulman may now be almost 400 years old.\n\nDuring the Philippine revolution against the Spanish government, there was no fighting in town reported. The people were submissive to the Spanish authorities.\n\nGuindulman was burned down during the Philippine–American War in 1898. Guerrilla warfare was already resorted to by the local insurgents known as \"insurectos\". A resistance movement was organized under the leadership of Colonel Pedro Samson whose headquarters was in Monte Verde in the upper part of the town. There was no battle fought in the poblacion of Guindulman, but a memorable encounter took place in the barrio of Cabantian wherein both sides suffer heavy casualties.\n\nThe historical incident happened when American troops passed by the barrio of Cabantian, the \"\"insurectos\"\" ambushed the troops by jumping from the hilltops and killing many American soldiers with their bolos. However, because of the superiority of American weapons, the insurgents likewise suffered several casualties. On account of such incident, the furious American patrols then burned the houses of the particular village including the rice stocks in the fields. Still dissatisfied, they shot cows and carabaos on sight.\n\nDuring the Japanese occupation in 1944, another encounter occurred between the Japanese troops and members of the guerrilla unit which was organized by the Major Esteban Bernido, native of Guindulman who also became a representative of the 3rd Congressional district of Bohol, governor of the province, and who finally occupied one of the important cabinet positions of the country. The memorable incident started with an ambush made by the guerrillas under Major Bernido right on the boundary of Guindulman and Duero. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties while the guerrilla unit escaped unharmed. As a reprisal, the Japanese burned the entire poblacion, leaving only the convent and the church which were occupied by their garrison.\n\nGuindulman comprises 19 barangays:\n\n\nEskaya people\n\n"}

Wilson\n\nLieutenant General Samuel Vaughan Wilson (September 23, 1923 – June 10, 2017), aka \"General Sam\", completed his active military career in the fall of 1977, having divided his service almost equally between special operations and intelligence assignments. He served as President of Hampden-Sydney College from 1992–2000 and as Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency from May 1976-August 1977; for his foundational work in doctrine for low intensity conflict, where he coined the term \"counterinsurgency\" (COIN); and for facilitating the drafting and passage of the Nunn-Cohen Amendment to the Goldwater-Nichols Act creating the US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) and the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low Intensity Conflict (ASD/SOLIC). He is also credited for helping to create Delta Force, the U.S. Army's premier counterterrorism unit.\n\nAs a general officer, some of his assignments included: Assistant Division Commander (Operations), 82nd Airborne Division; (First) United States Defense Attaché to the Soviet Union; Deputy to the Director of Central Intelligence for the Intelligence Community; and Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency. In his post-military career, he has been a Professor of Political Science and subsequently Wheat Professor of Leadership at the Wilson Center for Leadership in the Public Interest at Hampden–Sydney. Wilson died from lung cancer on June 10, 2017.\n\nA native of Rice, Virginia, Samuel Vaughan Wilson grew up on a tobacco, corn and wheat farm in Southside Virginia hard by the Saylers Creek battlefield, where on 6 April 1865, the Army of Northern Virginia fought its final battle before limping on westward to surrender three days later at Appomattox Courthouse. As a boy, Sam Wilson often rode his pony over the battlefield area looking for the footprint of two armies locked in combat. What still remained of his spare time after arduous farm chores was spent hunting, fishing, reading and pursuing his musical interests. His mother had been a public school teacher, and his father was a ruling elder in the local Presbyterian church. Both parents taught at Sunday school, his mother was his first Sunday School teacher and raised the Wilson siblings in the church. Both parents influenced their children to love books and enjoy reading, especially history.\n\nSam began his formal education in the fall of 1929, daily walking the two miles one-way to Rice High School and return to the farm. He graduated at the head of his class on 26 May 1940. Two weeks later he jogged seven miles through a rainy night from the family farm to the local National Guard armory, where he added two years to his actual age to qualify and was sworn into military service.\n\nLieutenant General Wilson is a graduate of the Infantry Officer Advanced Course, the United States Army Command and General Staff College and the Air War College, where he was the distinguished graduate in the Class of 1964. Following World War II, General Wilson studied at Columbia University and in Europe as a member of the US Army Foreign Area Specialist Training Program (FASTP), later known as the Foreign Area Officer (FAO) Program, mastering several languages and becoming a specialist on the former Soviet Union. He has attended a number of night schools, taken numerous correspondence courses and is the recipient of several honorary degrees.\n\nSam Wilson joined the 116th Infantry Regiment, Virginia National Guard) as a 16-year-old private bugler in June 1940. By early 1942, he had become successively a squad leader, platoon sergeant and acting first sergeant before being sent to Infantry Officer Candidate School (OCS), where he graduated as an 18-year-old second lieutenant at the head of his class and was selected to remain at The Infantry School, Fort Benning, Georgia, as an instructor.\n\nAs a young officer, Wilson taught guerilla and counterguerilla tactics at the Infantry School at Fort Benning, Georgia, in 1942 and 1943. In 1943, already a first lieutenant at the age of 19, he joined the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and subsequently responded to a presidential call for volunteers for \"a dangerous and hazardous mission\" to be undertaken by an elite regimental-sized unit. This move resulted in his becoming chief reconnaissance officer for the 5307th Composite Unit (Provisional), better known as Merrill's Marauders, which operated behind enemy lines in Burma during World War II. His role in that theater was later memorialized in Charlton Ogburn's book \"The Marauders\", which subsequently was made into the 1962 film \"Merrill's Marauders (film)\". Then-Lt. Col. Wilson served as technical advisor for the film and was cast as General Merrill's deputy \"Bannister\" under the pseudonym Vaughan Wilson; he also appeared in the film trailer introducing the film and narrating the trailer.\n\nUpon returning to the US from the China-Burma- India Theater as a combat veteran in fall 1944 with his fifth consecutive appointment in hand to the US Military Academy, Wilson was denied admission to West Point for medical reasons. His tour in Burma had ended with multiple medical ailments, including malaria, amoebic dysentery, mite typhus and severe malnutrition. He returned to the Infantry School where he developed and taught courses in military leadership for the next two years.\n\nDuring this period he applied for and was granted a commission in the Regular Army. This move exposed that he had been a fraudulent enlistment, having told a \"white lie\" earlier about his age, and resulted in his being appointed a second lieutenant in the Regular Army as of age 21—by which time he had already become a combat-experienced captain, Army of the United States (AUS).\n\nIn September 1947, although he was only a high school graduate from a small rural school, he entered the Army's Foreign Area Specialist Training Program (FASTP) and was enrolled in graduate school at Columbia University, specializing in the Russian language and related background and area subjects.\n\nFollowing a successful stint in graduate school, he was assigned for years to Europe as a language and area student, where he developed near-native fluency in the Russian language, as well as a working knowledge of several other languages. Noteworthy extra-curricular activities during this period included being assigned to the State Department's Diplomatic Pouch and Courier Service, which led to extensive travels throughout the Iron Curtain countries and the Soviet Union, as well as to other countries peripheral to the USSR; functioning as an official interpreter in Berlin, Potsdam and Vienna; and serving in a liaison capacity with elements of the Soviet armed forces in East Germany and in Eastern Austria.\n\nNewly promoted to major, Wilson returned to Washington and was assigned to the Army General Staff (Intelligence) in fall 1951, where he handled a variety of sensitive special projects until reassignment to attend the Infantry Officers Advanced Course in 1953. Upon graduation from this course, he was placed on special assignment in the Office of the Secretary of Defense, where he worked on Operations Coordinating Board (OCB) matters as a consultant on Soviet affairs. In the fall of 1955, Wilson began a three -year assignment with CIA's clandestine services, serving part of this period as a CIA case officer running a series of clandestine operations against the Soviet Union from a cover office in West Berlin.\n\nFollowing completion of the US Army Command and General Staff Course and promotion to lieutenant colonel, Wilson was assigned in June 1959 as Director of Instruction of the US Army Special Warfare School, Fort Bragg, NC. Over the next two years, he gained considerable notoriety for his foundational work on doctrine for small wars, insurgency and counter-insurgency. In June 1961, he was appointed Deputy Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Special Operations, serving in that capacity for the next two years and playing a key staff support role at such critical moments as the Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962.\n\nUpon graduation from the US Air War College in Spring 1964, LTC Wilson was placed on loan with the State Department and assigned to the US Agency for International Development (USAID) under the terms of the Participating Agency Service Agreement (PASA). In this capacity, he was employed at the temporary rank-equivalent of a class one foreign service officer and posted to Vietnam as Associate Director for Field Operations, where he was concerned with pacification and nation building efforts by the Americans and South Vietnamese. Some sixteen months later, he was appointed by the US Ambassador to Vietnam as United States Mission Coordinator and Minister-Counselor of the US Embassy in Saigon, receiving in connection with this latter post a presidential appointment to the personal rank of Minister.\n\nReturning to active military duty in the summer of 1967, Wilson, now an Army colonel—his military service had been continued for promotion and retirement purposes during his temporary foreign service appointment, assumed command at Fort Bragg of the 6th Special Forces Group (Airborne), with a mission orientation on the Middle East. He was shifted From this post in late 1969 to the position of Assistant Commandant of the newly named US Army John F. Kennedy Institute for Military Assistance (formerly the US Army Special Warfare School), where he again worked on doctrinal concepts pertaining to the role and mission of US military advisors—especially in insurgency, counter-insurgency and nation building environments—and played a key role in the establishment of the Military Assistance Officers Program (MAOP), which subsequently was merged with the Army's Foreign Area Specialist Training Program (FASTP) under the designation Foreign Area Officers Program (FAOP). Upon being selected for promotion to brigadier general in the summer of 1970, he was assigned as Assistant Division Commander for Operations, 82nd Airborne Division\n\nBetween 1971 and 1973 Brigadier General Wilson was US Defense Attaché (USDATT) in the US embassy in Moscow, USSR, at the height of the Cold War. He was the first general officer to hold that particular portfolio. (He reportedly was the CIA Chief of Station during that same period.) A former US Marine corporal recalls in an article that Wilson knew each embassy Marine by name and was considered \"our general\" by the Marine contingent there.\n\nGeneral Wilson's 1971–73 tour in Moscow was marked by his achievement of marked professional rapport with senior officers of the Soviet military high command. His near-native fluency in Russian, plus that he earlier had majored in Russian and Soviet history—especially military history—and had practically memorized the major battles on the Soviet-German front during the course of World War II, provided a fortuitous entré into Soviet military circles on which he fully capitalized. His insights into Soviet strategic and doctrinal thinking gained thereby were subsequently recognized as critically useful to policy makers and planners of the US national security establishment.\n\nWilson returned to the US, and between 1973 and 1976 held positions in the Defense Intelligence Agency as Deputy Director for Estimates and Deputy Director for Attaché Affairs, followed by an assignment in the rank of lieutenant general as Deputy to the Director of Central Intelligence for the Intelligence Community (D/DCI/IC.)\n\nIn May 1976, Wilson, now a lieutenant general, was appointed as the new Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency and oversaw the agency through \"the death of Mao Zedong, aircraft hijackings, unrest in South Africa, and continuing Mideast dissension.\" link Director Wilson gave a speech to retired intelligence officers in September 1976, which was declassified in 1993 and included the following notable excerpts:\n\nThe revelation of true intelligence secrets makes exciting reading in the morning paper. It is soon forgotten by most readers, but not by our adversaries. Enormously complex and expensive technical intelligence collection systems can be countered. Need I remind this particular audience that dedicated and courageous men and women who risk their lives to help America can be exposed and destroyed? I don't think the American people want this to happen especially when our adversaries dedicated to the proposition that we eventually must be defeated-are hard at work. But Americans must understand or they will inadvertently cause this to happen.\n\n[O]ur primary function is to provide the leadership of this nation with the deepest possible understanding of the military, political, social, and economic climate of countries that affect vital American interests. Our mission is to see that our leaders know about what may happen in the world beyond our borders and about the forces and factors at work there. The American taxpayer should know we do this job well, despite our problems.\n\nWilson is also credited with the statement \"Ninety percent of intelligence comes from open sources. The other ten percent, the clandestine work, is just the more dramatic. The real intelligence hero is Sherlock Holmes, not James Bond.\"\n\nDue to the precarious health condition of his wife, Wilson retired on 31 August 1977.\n\nAfter leaving the Army and DIA directorship in August 1977, Wilson began teaching at Hampden-Sydney College in Hampden-Sydney, Virginia and continued to consult with and provide advice to intelligence leaders, legislators and U.S. presidents, including former CIA Director William Colby, then-Senator Al Gore and President George H.W. Bush.\n\nIn 1992, Wilson became President of Hampden-Sydney College and served an 8-year term during which he shepherded the college through major challenges such as the college's contentious internal debate over whether to remain all-male (it did) and a major capital campaign drive. He remained involved on campus as a fellow of the eponymous Wilson Center for Leadership in the Public Interest.\n\nIn 1993, Wilson was inducted into the U.S. Army Ranger Hall of Fame \"for heroism, extraordinary achievement, and continued service to his country and the special operations community.\"\n\nGeneral Wilson is also a member of the Military Intelligence Hall of Fame. He was a featured interviewee in Ken Burns' documentary series \"The Vietnam War\" (2017), which aired posthumously.\n\nActivities following retirement from the Army and DIA Directorship in August 1977 include the following:\n\nA recent letter to him from General David H. Petraeus, Commanding General, USCENTCOM, reflects the fact that Wilson's earlier work on doctrine for small wars, insurgency, counterinsurgency and nation-building is still considered to be useful.)\n\nLieutenant General Wilson's personal awards and decorations include the Distinguished Service Cross, Defense Distinguished Service Medal, Distinguished Service Medal (U.S. Army) with two Oak Leaf Clusters, Silver Star for \"\"Gallantry in action\"\" with Oak Leaf Cluster, Legion of Merit with Oak Leaf Cluster, Bronze Star for Valor with Oak Leaf Cluster, Army Commendation Medal with two Oak Leaf Clusters, Army Good Conduct Medal (for enlisted service), American Defense Service Medal, Asia-Pacific Campaign Medal with two stars, World War II Victory Medal, American Campaign Service Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, Vietnam Service Medal with four stars, Army Service Ribbon, Army Overseas Service Ribbon with numeral 2, the Vietnam Gallantry Cross with Palm, and the Vietnam Campaign Medal.\n\nUnit awards include the Presidential Unit Citation, and the Vietnam Gallantry Cross Unit Citation.\n\nBadges include the Combat Infantryman Badge, Master Parachutist Badge, Joint Staff Identification, Army General Staff Identification Badge, Office of the Secretary of Defense Identification Badge, Defense Intelligence Agency Badge, and the Expert Marksmanship Badge.\n\nGeneral Wilson is also the recipient of the National Intelligence Distinguished Service Medal (2x), the US Special Operations Distinguished Service Medal, the CIA Distinguished Intelligence Medal, the William Oliver Baker Award, the Arthur D. \"Bull\" Simon Award (Special Operations), the Annual Rylander Award from the National Defense Industrial Association (NDIA), SOLIC Division, for outstanding contributions in Special Operations and Low Intensity Conflict (SO/LIC), and the Military Intelligence Corps Association Knowlton Award.\n\nHe received the following awards from other nations: The Vietnam Gallantry Cross with Palm (Republic of Vietnam), the Vietnamese National Administration Medal for Exemplary Service, Vietnam Campaign Medal (Republic of Vietnam).\n\nHe was awarded the George Washington Honor Medal by the Freedoms Foundation of Valley Forge in 1976.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was active in building new roads and bridges, opening up territory for development. Flood damage by the Humber River in 1850, and the repeal of the British Corn Laws in 1849 (bringing a dramatic fall in the price of his flour) caused his milling business to collapse, but his reputation as a business leader endured and he was active in the foundation of the Bank of Toronto in 1855.

It was promoted as a fact-based treatment of the events surrounding the apparitions of Our Lady of Fátima, in Portugal, in 1917.\n\nIt stars Susan Whitney as Lúcia dos Santos, Sherry Jackson as Jacinta Marto and Sammy Ogg as Francisco Marto, with Gilbert Roland as a fictional character named Hugo, a kindly but agnostic friend of the three children, who rediscovered his faith in God through the miracle of the Sun. The musical score by Max Steiner received an Academy Award nomination. The film was released on DVD on April 4, 2006.\n\nIt is 1917. Portugal is feeling the after-effects of a storm of anti-religious sentiment and the violent overthrow of the monarchy and the government in the 5 October 1910 revolution. Churches in Lisbon and the rest of Portugal are boarded up. Many priests, nuns, monks and friars are shown being fingerprinted, photographed and registered as possible criminals before being jailed. The rural town of Fátima is small enough to have escaped much of this persecution; their church remains open, and most of the people are reasonably devout. \n\nWatching their flocks and playing in a field outside town on May 15 (the actual date of the first apparition was May 13), Lúcia Santos (Susan Whitney) and her cousins, Jacinta Marto (Sherry Jackson) and Francisco Marto (Sammy Ogg) decide to pray their version of the Rosary by yelling out, \"Hail Mary!\" but not finishing the prayer. In the midst of this activity they hear a clap of thunder and see a flash of lightning from a distance. Thinking it is about to rain, the children gather their sheep and head for their homes. Another flash of lightning causes them to run straight into an unusual \"cloud of light\" surrounding a little tree on which a mysterious lady stands. Speaking slowly and gently, the Lady asks them to return on the 13th of each month and to offer their sufferings to God for the salvation of sinners. She entreats them to say the Rosary for world peace. Later, they encounter their agnostic friend Hugo (Gilbert Roland) who tells them it is best not to reveal the vision to anyone else, but of course on returning home, Jacinta immediately divulges her sightings.\n\nJacinta and Francisco's parents quickly believe the story, but Lúcia's mother reacts with disgust and subjects her daughter to emotional and physical mistreatment. She forbids Lúcia to return to the Cova da Iria, but Lúcia does so anyway on the next month's appearance (June 13), and is told then that her cousins will die and go to heaven \"soon\", while she will live a long life in holy service. The parish priest suggests the visions might be from Satan. The local authorities close the Fátima church until the priest can convince the parishioners that no visions have or will happen. The next month, on July 13, the Lady appears again, predicting \"another and worse war\" (World War II) will happen if the world doesn't stop sinning. She also predicts evil will come from Russia if that nation is unconverted. Kidnapped by provincial administrator Artur Santos (who is not related to Lúcia Santos), the children are first offered bribes, then threatened with death if they don't change their story. Trying to frighten them, he has first Jacinta, then Francisco dragged into another room. Jacinta's terrified screams convince Lúcia that her cousins are dead, but she refuses to deny what she's seen. Warning her that she's about to experience \"the full treatment\", Artur Santos reunites her with her cousins, who are very much alive, then throws them all in jail. There they find Hugo, who stands by them as they convince all the prisoners to join in the Rosary. \n\nUnable to find any prosecutable evidence, Artur (Frank Silvera) frees the children, who find that the entire population of Fátima has been standing outside waiting for them.\n\nOn October 13, when the Lady promised \"a sign that will make them believe\", about forty thousand people arrive, waiting through a torrential downpour. The Lady appears and says that the war (World War I) will be over soon and the soldiers will be returning to their homes. At precisely noon, as the Lady raises her hands, the clouds part and the sunlight shines brightly upon all the people—then the Sun shifts through a rainbow of colours and appears to move closer, in what many have described as the miracle of the Sun. Many people panic, some pray or watch calmly, and a few sick and disabled people are healed. As the Sun returns to normal, we see Hugo standing in the middle of the kneeling crowd, his hat still on. Removing it, he says \"Only the fool sayeth there is no God.\" \n\nA short epilogue, circa 1951, shows the huge basilica where the tree once stood and a million people outside paying homage to Our Lady of Fátima. At the end of the film, inside the new basilica (where the Cova da Iria once was), Lúcia is now a nun praying before the tomb where her cousins are buried, with the converted Hugo at her side.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2087196", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2087196", "title": "Windlesham", "text": "Windlesham\n\nWindlesham is a village in the Surrey Heath borough of Surrey, England and civil parish that covers Bagshot and Lightwater in the same borough. Its name derives from the Windle Brook which runs south of the village into Chobham and the common suffix 'ham', the Old English word for 'homestead'.\n\nToday Windlesham has a main clustered community with various clubs. The main public parkland is linked by footpath across the M3 motorway cutting across the south of the parish, Windlesham Arboretum. Passing through its north is the A30 (London Road), two nearby train stations and Heathrow Airport make the settlement economically largely a commuter village. It has one church, St John the Baptist, the Windlesham Club and Theatre and six public houses.\n\nA few large companies of late-20th-century origin have based themselves in Windlesham, including Rainbow Play Systems and the Linde Group.\n\nThe neighbourhood has yielded bronze implements, now in the Archaeological Society's Museum, Guildford, and a certain number of neolithic flints.\n\nWindlesham was once a small community within Windsor Great Park, built as a remote farming settlement around undulating heath, similar to Sunninghill. At Ribs Down in the north in private Updown Court and adjoining gardens land reaches 99 metres above sea level with a minimum descent (notch/col) of 31 metres, ranking 35th of 36 Surrey hills listed in the national hill-climbing database and the tallest private hill in Surrey.\n\nThis corner of the county appears, from absence of notice in Domesday, to have been very sparsely inhabited. Of Windlesham, Malden wrote:\n\nWindlesham Manor appears among the manors granted to Westminster by Edward the Confessor in his foundation charter. It was apparently transferred to the small local Broomhall Convent at an unknown date.\n\nNewark Priory had a grant of land in Windlesham in 1256, and had the advowson (right to appoint the vicar) of the church. \nJoan Rawlyns, Prioress of Broomhall, made a voluntary surrender of the property of her house in 1522 before the 1538 Dissolution of the Monasteries. In the next year Windlesham was granted to St. John's College, Cambridge, who still held it in 1911\n\nIn 1911 the village was, due to Surrey Heath, described as almost entirely modern, in much the same way as Wentworth, Surrey's landscape was tamed approximately at the turn of the 20th century, being naturally heather, gorse and fern and ideal for grass and laid out evergreen trees.\n\nThe village is known for the Lilly Research Centre, built in 1967, to the north of the village. The BOC Group was based in the village, but was bought by Linde plc (Linde AG of Germany) in September 2006.\n\nThere are four schools in the Windlesham area, two of which are in the village itself: Windlesham Village Infants School. Woodcote House School is also in the area.\n\nThe Field of Remembrance (WFoR) is owned, funded and run by the village community (via a board of volunteer trustees). The land was purchased from Admiral Cochrane in 1950 as a permanent memorial to the men and women of the village who lost their lives in the two World Wars. It consists of both open space and mature woodland and includes a play area. Many village events take place on the field, one of the most well known being the annual Windlesham Village Fete. The field is also used by Windlesham Football Club (Youth and Adult teams). In the summer months it is used by local cricket clubs. A Remembrance day service is hosted at the field with the Windlesham branch of the Royal British Legion. Children from Windlesham Village Infant School attend and lay a wreath, along with a member of the Royal British Legion and the Chair of the Windlesham Field of Remembrance Committee. \nThe WFoR committee are raising funds to replace the current dilapidated pavilion building.\n\nWindlesham is known for its annual pram race in which teams race around the village stopping at every pub. This usually happens every Boxing Day. The race starts at 10:30am at the old headquarters of The BOC Group now Linde Group. The finish and prize giving is held at the Windlesham Club & Theatre. Funds raised though entry fees and coin collections on the day are distributed to local charities and good causes.\n\nWindlesham has a thriving running club, Windle Valley Runners, suitable for all standards of runner. The club meets every Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday for group training sessions and group runs, which take place in Windlesham and the surrounding areas. Windle Valley Runners compete in the winter Thames Valley Cross Country League. They also organise a monthly 10K race for members.\n\nWindlesham Drama Group is based at the Windlesham Club and Theatre. There are usually three shows a year including a pantomime (usually end of January / beginning of February) and two plays.\n\nIn April 2017, the village was set to become a hedgehog friendly village, reported to be one of a handful of such villages in the United Kingdom.\n\nValley End is a hamlet and chapelry in the Borough of Surrey Heath in Surrey, England east of Windlesham, so similarly is about 15 minutes drive from the South West Main Line at Woking to the southeast and from Sunningdale on the Waterloo to Reading Line to the north.\n\nValley End has two churches, St Saviour which was built in 1867 by the English architect George Frederick Bodley and Emmanuel Baptist Church. St Saviour's is built in red and brown brick with stone dressed windows. The interior is a simple mixture of brick and stone. There is a Holy Communion service every Sunday at 9am.\n\nValley End School was founded in 1859 by the Hon. Julia Bathurst of Hyams Hall, Windlesham.\n\nThe Valley End Cricket Club was founded in 1895.\n\nSee Bagshot for this developed part of the civil parish. There is the greatest concentration of shops and businesses in Bagshot compared to the other parts of the parish.\n\nSee Lightwater for this developed part of the civil parish\n\nWindlesham Arboretum is connected by footpath to the edge of the village centre but on the opposite side of the M3 motorway. In July 2007, the most expensive house in the world, Updown Court, in Windlesham was valued at £75m ($138m (USD)). This 103-room mansion has of gardens and landscaped woodlands.\n\nThe average level of accommodation in the region composed of detached houses was 28%, the average that was apartments was 22.6%.\nThe proportion of households in the civil parish who owned their home outright compares to the regional average of 35.1%. The proportion who owned their home with a loan compares to the regional average of 32.5%. The remaining % is made up of rented dwellings (plus a negligible % of households living rent-free).\n\n\n"}

When about ten years of age, he was sent by them, in company with a cousin, to America to be educated. An elder brother had returned four years before, and his parents were anxious that their child should receive the same benefits. The captain who brought the two boys over proved to be a treacherous villain, and carried them to Baltimore, where he exposed them for sale, they were both purchased by Portsmouth, New Hampshire men, Prince falling to General William Whipple. He was emancipated during the [Revolutionary] War, was much esteemed, and was once entrusted by the General with a large sum of money to carry from Salem to Portsmouth. He was attacked on the road, near Newburyport, by two ruffians; one was struck with a loaded whip, the other one he shot ... Prince was beloved by all who knew him. He was also known as \"Caleb Quotom\" of Portsmouth, where he died leaving a widow, Dinah, a freeperson and two children.\n\nAccording to the Portsmouth, New Hampshire Town Records, General Whipple granted Prince Whipple the rights of a freeman on February 22, 1781, Prince's wedding day. He was legally manumitted by Gen. William Whipple on February 26, 1784.\n\nAccording to legend, Prince Whipple accompanied General Whipple and George Washington in the famous crossing of the Delaware River and is the black man portrayed fending off ice with an oar at Washington's knee in the painting \"Washington Crossing the Delaware\", painted 75 years after the event by German American artist Emanuel Leutze. Most historians doubt that there is any basis for this story. It is extremely unlikely that either General Whipple or Prince Whipple was present at the Battle of Trenton. At that time, General Whipple was serving in the Continental Congress, which had fled Philadelphia and reconvened in Baltimore, a distance of from Trenton. Moreover, Prince Whipple was not famous at the time the painting was commissioned, and it is unlikely that Leutze would have heard of him.\n\n\n"}

Muir used various found objects as part of his percussion repertoire. He spoke of \"approach[ing] the rubbish with a total respect for its nature as rubbish\", and that \"The way to discover the undiscovered in performing terms is to immediately reject all situations as you identify them (the cloud of unknowing) – which is to give music a future\". During this period he also played in the band Boris with Don Weller and Jimmy Roche (both later of jazz-rock band Major Surgery) and put in a stint with Afro-rock band Assagai in which he met Canterbury scene keyboard player Alan Gowen. Muir and Gowen subsequently formed the experimental jazz-rock band Sunship with guitarist Allan Holdsworth and bass player Laurie Baker, although Muir has admitted that \"we spent more time laughing than playing music\" and suggests that the band played no gigs and got no further than rehearsals.\n\nMuir was a member of King Crimson from mid-1972 to early 1973. With King Crimson, Muir occasionally played a standard drum kit, but more often he contributed an assortment of unusual sounds from a wide variety of percussion instruments, including chimes, bells, gongs, mbiras, a musical saw, shakers, rattles, found objects, and miscellaneous drums. Muir initially appeared on a single King Crimson album, 1973's \"Larks' Tongues In Aspic\". Several live recordings featuring Muir were released later by DGM records; the 15-disc box set released in 2012 for the 40th anniversary of the album includes every recording from that line-up, be it live or studio, documenting everything Muir has ever contributed. King Crimson violinist/keyboardist David Cross reports that \"We all learned an incredible amount from Jamie. He really was a catalyst of this band in the beginning and he opened up new areas for Bill [Bill Bruford, the group's \"conventional\" drummer] to look into as well as affecting the rest of us.\"\n\nIn 1972 Muir decided to pursue a monastic lifestyle, in accordance with the strict principles of Buddhism. He left King Crimson abruptly in early 1973 and moved to Samye Ling Monastery near Eskdalemuir in southern Scotland. He had just completed his contribution to \"Larks' Tongues\", released subsequent to his departure. The British Press at the time cited his departure as the result of \"personal injury sustained onstage during performance\", a phrase attributed to the band's management company, E'G.\n\nJamie Muir also showed Yes's Jon Anderson about Paramahansa Yogananda's works during the wedding reception of the previous Yes drummer Bill Bruford, which ultimately led up to influencing the album \"Tales From Topographic Oceans\" by Yes, based on the Yogananda's \"Autobiography of a Yogi\".\n\nIn 1980, Muir returned to the London music scene, recording with Parker and Bailey. He was also on the soundtrack of the film \"Ghost Dance\", a collaboration with another Crimson alumnus, drummer Michael Giles and David Cunningham recorded in 1983, and eventually released in 1996.\n\nMuir reported that he withdrew from the music business around 1990, to devote his energies to painting.\n\nWith Derek Bailey, Evan Parker and Hugh Davies\nWith King Crimson\nWith Derek Bailey\nWith Evan Parker and Paul Rogers\nWith Michael Giles and David Cunningham\nWith Company\n"}
