Some academics, following the Scottish antiquarian George Neilson (1858–1923), have identified him with a Scottish knight, Hugh of Eglinton, and advanced his authorship of several significant pieces of alliterative verse. Current opinion is that there is little evidence to support this.\n\nThe little that is known about Huchoun comes from the Chronicle of Andrew of Wyntoun, which mentions:\nHucheon,<br> \nþat cunnande was in littratur.<br>\nHe made a gret Gest of Arthure<br>\nAnd þe Awntyr of Gawane,<br>\nÞe Pistil als of Suet Susane.<br>\nHe was curyousse in his stille,<br>\nFayr of facunde and subtile,<br>\nAnd ay to pleyssance hade delyte,<br>\nMad in metyr meit his dyte<br>\nLitil or noucht neuir þe lesse<br>\nWauerande fra þe suythfastnes.<br>\n\nInterest in the otherwise unknown figure of \"Huchoun\" - a diminutive form of \"Hugh\", i.e. \"little Hugh\" - was spurred largely by the work of George Neilson, a lawyer and antiquarian, who gave a series of lectures at Glasgow University in 1902 centred on the subject, and published a book the same year.\n\nOf the works Andrew of Wyntoun mentions, the easiest to identify was \"Þe Pistil als of Suet Susane\". This has been fairly firmly associated with The Pistel of Swete Susan, an alliterative poem surviving in 5 manuscripts.\n\nThe \"Gest of Arthure\", also called \"Gest Historyalle\" and described by Wyntoun, has been more tentatively identified as the well-known \"Alliterative Morte Arthure\" (found in the Thornton manuscript of Lincoln Cathedral).\n\nThe \"Awntyr of Gawane\" (literally the \"Adventure of Gawain\") is less certain. Neilson advanced that it represented the great alliterative work \"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\" and Huchoun was therefore also credited with \"Patience\", \"Pearl\", and \"Cleanness\". The fact that a later hand had written \"Hugo de\" at the head of the manuscript of these works was also taken as supporting evidence. The output of the Pearl Poet, however, is linguistically very distinct from what seems to be the oldest versions of the works more solidly attributed to Huchoun, and this attribution is nowadays dismissed. More likely is the suggestion that the \"Awntyr of Gawane\" represents \"The Awntyrs off Arthure\", an Arthurian poem in a rhymed alliterative stanza similar to \"Swete Susan\", which has several variants in multiple manuscripts.\n\nBeyond the matter of what he may have written, who Huchoun was is uncertain.\n\nWilliam Dunbar, in his \"Lament for the Makaris\", mentions a poet called \"gude Sir Hew of Eglyntoun\", whose works are now lost. Hugh of Eglington was a knight who was brother-in-law to Robert II of Scotland. Following suggestions made by earlier antiquarians, Neilson argued that Huchoun, \"little Hugh\", could be the same figure: given Hugh of Eglington's close connection with the king, and the fact that he was given safe conduct to visit London, the epithet \"of the Awle Ryale\" could be explained, if it was interpreted as \"Aula Regalis\" or \"Royal Palace\".\n\nThe biggest problem with this identification is that the poems ascribed by Neilson to Huchoun / Hugh of Eglington are of varying dialects, none of them Scottish. Even the poem most likely to be authentically Huchoun's own work, the \"Pistel of Swete Susan\", seems to be in a north Yorkshire dialect overlaying a Midland source. \"Gawain and the Green Knight\" and the other three poems in the Cotton Nero A.x manuscript have a clearly north-western provenance, while the \"Alliterative Morte Arthure\" is considered to originate in the East Midlands. Two possibilities suggested by Neilson are that a Scottish poet wrote in a southern dialect, perhaps after being educated in England, or that the Scotticisms were \"translated\" by later scribes. It seems a more likely suggestion either that Andrew of Wyntoun's poet, Huchoun, was not Scottish (and therefore not Sir Hugh), or that the poems he mentions were in fact other works now lost, rather than the great alliterative poems Neilson claimed they referred to.\n\nOther candidates for Huchoun from different parts of England have much less detailed evidence to prove their case. Current academic opinion takes the line that Huchoun, if he existed, may have written \"swete Susan\" but that evidence to link the same poet to other major alliterative works is tenuous at best.\n\n"}

Her character design was meant to strike a balance between realism and a comic-like style, while taking inspiration from the style employed for the characters in the film \"The Dark Crystal\". She was initially known as Freija. She is a member of a race of anthropomorphic rats called Burmecians who mainly live in two cities, Burmecia and Cleyra. Her class is Dragon Knight.\n\nFreya appears in the video game \"Final Fantasy IX\". She is originally from Burmecia, but when met in the game, she has not been home for years. When the man she loved, Sir Fratley, left on a mission but never returned, she left home until she discovered what became of him. After a period in Lindblum, she headed out to wander the world. Freya returns to Lindblum to compete in the \"Festival of the Hunt\" around the same time that Zidane and Tantalus return from their mission to kidnap Princess Garnet. Freya is reunited with Sir Fratley during Alexandria's attack on Cleyra. Her joy is cut short when he reveals that he has lost his memory and does not remember her at all. Freya is crestfallen, but when Fratley leaves again, she says nothing. She explains that she was just happy that he was alive. She is reunited with Fratley during the ending of the game in Burmecia. He has not regained his memories, but he falls back in love with Freya.\n\nA figurine of Freya was released in a compilation with Beatrix, and is slated to release in February 2020.\n\nFreya has received generally positive reception, regarded as a fan favorite by Keegan Lee of \"RPGFan\". Jef Rouner of the \"Houston Press\" ranked her among the most attractive furry characters, calling her one of his favorite \"Final Fantasy IX\" characters. He called her one of the most \"romantic\" characters on his list due to her \"pale colors, tragic stoicism and the shock of emo hair that obscures most pictures of her.\" Anthony John Agnello of \"GamesRadar+\" calls her \"Jim Hensonian\", noting her \"warm\" mixture of human and animal traits. Developer Robert Boyd regarded her as one of the best female warriors in Japanese role-playing games. Brittany Vincent of \"SyFy Wire\" called it a \"veritable crime\" that Freya was absent from the \"Dissidia Final Fantasy\" franchise, calling her \"awesome.\" She noted that she needed \"more time in the spotlight.\" Richard Walls of \"Video Game Music Online\" noted how her musical theme captured her insecurities and solitude well and how it progressed to being more heroic as it progresses. He called it the \"deepest musical portraits of any character\" that composer Nobuo Uematsu had ever made. Julian Whitney, also of \"Video Game Music Online\", similarly discussed her theme, noting its melancholy and sense of hope. They called the theme the standout of the soundtrack, citing Freya's \"courage and perseverance.\"\n\nJoshua Carpenter of \"RPGamer\" praised her, noting her quest as a standout aspect of the game. However, Shaun Musgrave of \"TouchArcade\" felt that Freya was \"completely squandered\" in \"Final Fantasy IX\". Nadia Oxford of \"USGamer\" felt similar, noting that she loves Dragoons and rodent-type characters, which made her feel disappointed in her lack of development. She also called her \"the best\" and showed appreciation for the fact that she is a positive depiction of rats. Steven Toast of \"RPGamer\" disagreed on her development, thinking she was handled well. He praised how she has a stronger side while having her softer, romantic side. Colin Stevens of \"Hardcore Gamer\" noted that despite Freya's design hearkening back to old \"Final Fantasy\" classes, the writers subvert expectations of these classes by giving them more development than people may have expected.\n"}

In general usage, the term \"soil conditioner\" is often thought of as a subset of the category soil amendments (or soil improvement, soil condition), which more often is understood to include a wide range of fertilizers and non-organic materials.\n\nSoil conditioners can be used to improve poor soils, or to rebuild soils which have been damaged by improper soil management. They can make poor soils more usable, and can be used to maintain soils in peak condition.\n\nA wide variety of materials have been described as soil conditioners due to their ability to improve soil quality. Some examples include biochar, bone meal, blood meal, coffee grounds, compost, compost tea, coir, manure, straw, peat, sphagnum moss, vermiculite, sulfur, lime, hydroabsorbant polymers, and biosolids.\nMany soil conditioners come in the form of certified organic products, for people concerned with maintaining organic crops or organic gardens. Soil conditioners of almost every description are readily available from online stores or local nurseries as well as garden supply stores.\n\nThe most common use of soil conditioners is to improve soil structure. Soils tend to become compacted over time. Soil compaction impedes root growth, decreasing the ability of plants to take up nutrients and water. Soil conditioners can add more loft and texture to keep the soil loose.\n\nFor centuries people have been adding things to poor soils to improve their ability to support healthy plant growth. Some of these materials, such as compost, clay and peat, are still used extensively today. Many soil amendments also add nutrients such as carbon and nitrogen, as well as beneficial bacteria.\n\nAdditional nutrients, such as calcium, magnesium and phosphorus, may be augmented by amendments as well. This enriches the soil, allowing plants to grow bigger and stronger.\n\nSoil amendments can also greatly increase the cation exchange capacity (CEC) of soils. Soils act as the storehouses of plant nutrients. The relative ability of soils to store one particular group of nutrients, the cations. The most common soil cations are calcium, magnesium, potassium, ammonium, hydrogen, and sodium.\n\nThe total number of cations a soil can hold, its total negative charge, is the soil's cation exchange capacity. The higher the CEC, the higher the negative charge and the more cations that can be held and exchanged with plant roots, providing them with the nutrition they require.\n\nSoil conditioners may be used to improve water retention in dry, coarse soils which are not holding water well. The addition of organic material for instance can greatly improve the water retention abilities of sandy soils and they can be added to adjust the pH of the soil to meet the needs of specific plants or to make highly acidic or alkaline soils more usable. The possibility of using other materials to assume the role of composts and clays in improving the soil was investigated on a scientific basis earlier in the 20th century, and the term soil conditioning was coined. The criteria by which such materials are judged most often remains their cost-effectiveness, their ability to increase soil moisture for longer periods, stimulate microbiological activity, increase nutrient levels and improve plant survival rates.\n\nThe first synthetic soil conditioners were introduced in the 1950s, when the chemical hydrolysed polyacrylonitrile was the most used. Because of their ability to absorb several hundred times their own weight in water, polyacrylamides and polymethacrylates (also known as hydroabsorbent polymers, superabsorbent polymers or hydrogels) were tested in agriculture, horticulture and landscaping beginning in the 1960s.\n\nInterest disappeared when experiments proved them to be phytotoxic due to their high acrylamide monomer residue. Although manufacturing advances later brought the monomer concentration down below the toxic level, scientific literature shows few successes in utilizing these polymers for increasing plant quality or survival. The appearance of a new generation of potentially effective tools in the early 1980s, including hydroabsorbent polymers and copolymers from the propenamide and propenamide-propenoate families, opened new perspectives.\n\nSoil conditioners may be applied in a number of ways. Some are worked into the soil with a tiller before planting. Others are applied after planting, or periodically during the growing season. Soil testing should be performed prior to applying a soil conditioner to learn more about the composition and structure of the soil. This testing will determine which conditioners will be more appropriate for the available conditions.\n\nWhile adding a soil conditioner to crops or a garden can seem like a great way to get healthier plants, over-application of some amendments can cause ecological problems. For example, salts, nitrogen, metals and other nutrients that are present in many soil amendments are not productive when added in excess, and can actually be detrimental to plant health. (See fertilizer burn.) Runoff of excess nutrients into waterways also occurs, which is harmful to the water quality and through it, the environment.\n\n\n"}

Personnel serving in the United States Army during a major national emergency or armed conflict (either voluntarily or involuntarily) were enlisted into the Army of the United States, without specifying service in a component.\n\nThe term \"Army of the United States\" or \"Armies of the United States\" is also the legal name of the collective land forces of the United States, as prescribed by the United States Constitution. In this concept, the term \"Army of the United States\" has been in use since at least 1841, as in the title \"General Regulations for the Army of the United States\".\n\nThe original concept of a non-Regular Army component, existing to augment the standing military, can trace its origins to the United States Volunteers. State volunteer forces were used extensively to augment the Regular Army throughout the 19th and early 20th century. During World War I and dictated by the provisions of the National Defense Act of 1916, states contributed men to the \"Volunteer Army\" (more commonly known as the National Army). During World War I, a standard practice developed for Regular Army officers to serve in higher positions within the National Army, and thus hold two ranks - a permanent rank and a temporary rank. This concept was related to the idea of the brevet rank, which had generally fallen into disuse by the time of the First World War. The National Army was suspended after World War I.\n\nIn September 1940, the United States reintroduced conscription in response to the increasing likelihood of entry into World War II. Personnel voluntarily enlisting into the United States Army could choose to voluntarily enlist into the Regular Army, National Guard of the United States, or Organized Reserve. On 14 May 1940, legislation provided that all voluntary enlistments in the United States Army during a time of national emergency or war were to be in the Army of the United States \"without specification of any particular component or unit thereof.\" The \"Army of the United States\" as a service component was formally activated in February 1941. It was legally considered the successor to the National Army.\n\nThe Army of the United States saw a major expansion following the 7 December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. On 13 December 1941, legislation provided that personnel inducted into the United States Army under the terms of the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940 were, both retroactively and from that date on, considered to be serving in the Army of the United States.\n\nThe first commissioned officers serving in the Army of the United States were appointed from the Regular Army, generally southerners. The standard practice that these officers held a \"permanent rank\" within the Regular Army as well as a higher \"temporary rank\" while serving in the Army of the United States. A typical situation might be a colonel in the AUS holding the permanent rank of captain in the Regular Army. Another term for rank held in the Army of the United States was \"theater rank.\"\n\nPromotions within the Army of the United States were sometimes very rapid, and some officers were promoted as many as four to five times in the space of just three to four years. Dwight D. Eisenhower, who served as General of the Army, rose from a colonel to five-star general in three years. However, rank in the AUS could be revoked just as easily, with senior commanders who were relieved reverting to their permanent Regular Army rank. This was known as \"loss of theater rank\", with some instances of generals returning to the United States in disgrace or at least under a cloud, as only colonels or majors.\n\nIn 1946, with postwar demobilization, the Army of the United States was suspended, along with the draft. Officers from that point reverted to Regular Army rank and all enlisted personnel either were discharged from the Army of the United States and returned to civilian life, or accepted the offer to reenlist in the Regular Army. Units raised in the Army of the United States were deactivated; if the Army chose to activate them again permanently, they were allotted to the Regular Army.\n\nThe Army of the United States was demobilized in 1946, but still maintained as a component of the Army. Upon the outbreak of the Korean War, the Army of the United States consisted of conscripts in the Regular Army, with the National Guard and Army of the United States existing simultaneously in the same theater. The system of prefixes before service numbers was as follows:\n\n\n. The last use of the Army of the United States (AUS) was during the Vietnam War. It was disbanded in 1974.\n\nThe Army Reserve (USAR) and Army National Guard (ARNG) remained separate components during the modern era of conscription, and their members continued to use their unique identifiers, except in those cases in which officers were appointed or commissioned into a higher grade of rank while on active duty serving in a Regular Army unit. For example, during the war in Vietnam, a graduate of Army ROTC, commissioned as a USAR 2d lieutenant and serving his initial active duty tour, could be promoted to 1st lieutenant, or even captain, with a \"temporary\", active duty (i.e., AUS) commission, while still holding the permanent, USAR rank of 2d lieutenant. Another example would be an ARNG officer serving on active duty, who might accept a commission in the Regular Army (RA), and then might be promoted one or two grades in the AUS above their RA grade. This possibility could result in situations in which an Army National Guard captain could be called to active duty and accept a commission as a Regular Army major, then be promoted in the AUS, holding a \"temporary\", active duty commission at a higher rank, and then could retire after 20 or more years of active duty as a lieutenant colonel or colonel, while actually only having met the time-in-grade requirements (and passed the promotion board selection screening process) for the \"permanent\", Regular Army rank of major.\n\nThere is no equivalent to the Army of the United States in the Navy, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard. During WWII, officers who joined one of these branches were typically commissioned into the \"Naval Reserve,\" \"Marine Corps Reserve,\" or \"Coast Guard Reserve\" respectively (the last of these being newly created in the run up to the war), with the understanding that their active service would be only for the duration of the hostilities. In 1948, for a very brief period, a component known as the \"Air Forces of the United States\" (AFUS) existed to augment Army Air Forces personnel, who held AUS ranks, into the newly created United States Air Force.\n"}

It is especially useful when describing frequency response of electronic systems, such as audio amplifiers and filters.\n\nThe factor-of-ten in a decade can be in either direction: so one decade up from 100 Hz is 1000 Hz, and one decade down is 10 Hz. The factor-of-ten is what is important, not the unit used, so 3.14 rad/s is one decade down from 31.4 rad/s.\n\nTo determine the number of decades between two frequencies (formula_1 & formula_2), use the logarithm of the ratio of the two values: \nor, using natural logarithms:\n\nTo find out what frequency is a certain number of decades from the original frequency, multiply by appropriate powers of 10:\n\nTo find out the size of a step for a certain number of frequencies per decade, raise 10 to the power of the inverse of the number of steps:\n\nDecades on a logarithmic scale, rather than unit steps (steps of 1) or other linear scale, are commonly used on the horizontal axis when representing the frequency response of electronic circuits in graphical form, such as in Bode plots, since depicting large frequency ranges on a linear scale is often not practical. For example, an audio amplifier will usually have a frequency band ranging from 20 Hz to 20 kHz and representing the entire band using a decade log scale is very convenient. Typically the graph for such a representation would begin at 1 Hz (10) and go up to perhaps 100 kHz (10), to comfortably include the full audio band in a standard-sized graph paper, as shown below. Whereas in the same distance on a linear scale, with 10 as the major step-size, you might only get from 0 to 50.\n\nElectronic frequency responses are often described in terms of \"per decade\". The example Bode plot shows a slope of −20 dB/dec in the stopband, which means that for every factor-of-ten increase in frequency (going from 10 rad/s to 100 rad/s in the figure), the gain decreases by 20 dB.\n\n"}
{"id": "2187252", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2187252", "title": "Ciphertext indistinguishability", "text": "Ciphertext indistinguishability\n\nCiphertext indistinguishability is a property of many encryption schemes. Intuitively, if a cryptosystem possesses the property of indistinguishability, then an adversary will be unable to distinguish pairs of ciphertexts based on the message they encrypt. The property of indistinguishability under chosen plaintext attack is considered a basic requirement for most provably secure public key cryptosystems, though some schemes also provide indistinguishability under chosen ciphertext attack and adaptive chosen ciphertext attack. Indistinguishability under chosen plaintext attack is equivalent to the property of semantic security, and many cryptographic proofs use these definitions interchangeably.\n\nA cryptosystem is considered \"secure in terms of indistinguishability\" if no adversary, given an encryption of a message randomly chosen from a two-element message space determined by the adversary, can identify the message choice with probability significantly better than that of random guessing (). If any adversary can succeed in distinguishing the chosen ciphertext with a probability significantly greater than , then this adversary is considered to have an \"advantage\" in distinguishing the ciphertext, and the scheme is \"not\" considered secure in terms of indistinguishability. This definition encompasses the notion that in a secure scheme, the adversary should learn no information from seeing a ciphertext. Therefore, the adversary should be able to do no better than if it guessed randomly.\n\nSecurity in terms of indistinguishability has many definitions, depending on assumptions made about the capabilities of the attacker. It is normally presented as a game, where the cryptosystem is considered secure if no adversary can win the game with significantly greater probability than an adversary who must guess randomly. The most common definitions used in cryptography are indistinguishability under chosen plaintext attack (abbreviated IND-CPA), indistinguishability under (non-adaptive) chosen ciphertext attack (IND-CCA1), and indistinguishability under adaptive chosen ciphertext attack (IND-CCA2). Security under either of the latter definition implies security under the previous ones: a scheme which is IND-CCA1 secure is also IND-CPA secure, and a scheme which is IND-CCA2 secure is both IND-CCA1 and IND-CPA secure. Thus, IND-CCA2 is the strongest of the three definitions of security.\n\nFor a probabilistic asymmetric key encryption algorithm, indistinguishability under chosen plaintext attack (IND-CPA) is defined by the following game between an adversary and a challenger. For schemes based on computational security, the adversary is modeled by a probabilistic polynomial time Turing machine, meaning that it must complete the game and output a \"guess\" within a polynomial number of time steps. In this definition E(PK, \"M\") represents the encryption of a message \"M\" under the key \"PK\":\n\n\nA cryptosystem is indistinguishable under chosen plaintext attack if every probabilistic polynomial time adversary has only a negligible \"advantage\" over random guessing. An adversary is said to have a negligible \"advantage\" if it wins the above game with probability formula_4, where formula_5 is a negligible function in the security parameter \"k\", that is for every (nonzero) polynomial function formula_6 there exists formula_7 such that formula_8 for all formula_9.\n\nAlthough the adversary knows formula_10, formula_11 and PK, the probabilistic nature of E means that the encryption of formula_3 will be only one of many valid ciphertexts, and therefore encrypting formula_10, formula_11 and comparing the resulting ciphertexts with the challenge ciphertext does not afford any non-negligible advantage to the adversary.\n\nWhile the above definition is specific to an asymmetric key cryptosystem, it can be adapted to the symmetric case by replacing the public key encryption function with an encryption oracle, which retains the secret encryption key and encrypts arbitrary plaintexts at the adversary's request.\n\nThe adversarial process of performing a chosen-plaintext attack is usually outlined in the form of a Cryptographic Game. To test for symmetric IND-CPA, the game described above is defined. Let formula_15 be a key generation function, formula_16 be an encryption function, and formula_17 be a decryption function. Let formula_18 be a symmetric encryption scheme. The game formula_19 is defined as:\n\nAs many times as it would like, an adversary selects two plaintext messages of its own choosing and provides them to the LR oracle which returns a ciphertext encrypting one of the messages. An adversary's advantage is determined by its probability of guessing the value of \"b,\" a value chosen at random at the beginning of the game which determines the message that is encrypted in the LR oracle. Therefore, its advantage is defined as:\n\nIndistinguishability under non-adaptive and adaptive Chosen Ciphertext Attack (IND-CCA1, IND-CCA2) uses a definition similar to that of IND-CPA. However, in addition to the public key (or encryption oracle, in the symmetric case), the adversary is given access to a \"decryption oracle\" which decrypts arbitrary ciphertexts at the adversary's request, returning the plaintext. In the non-adaptive definition, the adversary is allowed to query this oracle only up until it receives the challenge ciphertext. In the adaptive definition, the adversary may continue to query the decryption oracle even after it has received a challenge ciphertext, with the caveat that it may not pass the challenge ciphertext for decryption (otherwise, the definition would be trivial).\n\n\nA scheme is IND-CCA1/IND-CCA2 secure if no adversary has a non-negligible advantage in winning the above game.\n\nSometimes we need encryption schemes in which the ciphertext string is indistinguishable from a random string by the adversary.\n\nIf an adversary is unable to tell if a message even exists, it gives the person who wrote the message plausible deniability.\n\nSome people building encrypted communication links prefer to make the contents of each encrypted datagram indistinguishable from random data, in order to make traffic analysis more difficult.\n\nSome people building systems to store encrypted data prefer to make the data indistinguishable from random data in order to make data hiding easier.\nFor example, some kinds of disk encryption such as TrueCrypt attempt to hide data in the innocent random data left over from some kinds of data erasure.\nAs another example, some kinds of steganography attempt to hide data by making it match the statistical characteristics of the innocent \"random\" image noise in digital photos.\n\nTo support such deniable encryption systems, a few cryptographic algorithms are specifically designed to make ciphertext messages indistinguishable from random bit strings.\n\nMost applications don't require an encryption algorithm to produce encrypted messages that are indistinguishable from random bits.\nHowever, some authors consider such encryption algorithms to be conceptually simpler and easier to work with, and more versatile in practice—and most IND-CPA encryption algorithms apparently do, in fact, produce encrypted messages that are indistinguishable from random bits.\n\nIndistinguishability is an important property for maintaining the confidentiality of encrypted communications. However, the property of indistinguishability has in some cases been found to imply other, apparently unrelated security properties. Sometimes these implications go in both directions, making two definitions equivalent; for example, it is known that the property of indistinguishability under adaptive chosen ciphertext attack (IND-CCA2) is equivalent to the property of non-malleability under the same attack scenario (NM-CCA2). This equivalence is not immediately obvious, as non-malleability is a property dealing with message integrity, rather than confidentiality. In other cases, it has been demonstrated that indistinguishability can be combined with certain other definitions, in order to imply still other useful definitions, and vice versa. The following list summarizes a few known implications, though it is by no means complete.\n\nThe notation formula_22 means that property A implies property B. formula_23 means that properties A and B are \"equivalent\". formula_24 means that property A does not necessarily imply property B.\n\n\n\n"}

A medicine is injected into the vessels, which makes them shrink. It is used for children and young adults with vascular or lymphatic malformations. In adults, sclerotherapy is often used to treat spider veins, smaller varicose veins, hemorrhoids and hydroceles.\n\nSclerotherapy is one method (along with surgery, radiofrequency and laser ablation) for the treatment of spider veins, occasionally varicose veins, and venous malformations. In ultrasound-guided sclerotherapy, ultrasound is used to visualize the underlying vein so the physician can deliver and monitor the injection. Sclerotherapy often takes place under ultrasound guidance after venous abnormalities have been diagnosed with duplex ultrasound. Sclerotherapy under ultrasound guidance and using microfoam sclerosants has been shown to be effective in controlling reflux from the sapheno-femoral and sapheno-popliteal junctions.\nHowever, some authors believe that sclerotherapy is not suitable for veins with reflux from the greater or lesser saphenous junction, or for veins with axial reflux.\n\nSclerotherapy has been used in the treatment of spider veins and occasionally varicose veins for over 150 years. Like varicose vein surgery, sclerotherapy techniques have evolved during that time. Modern techniques including ultrasonographic guidance and foam sclerotherapy are the latest developments in this evolution.\n\nThe first reported attempt at sclerotherapy was by D Zollikofer in Switzerland, 1682 who injected an acid into a vein to induce thrombus formation. Both Debout and Cassaignaic reported success in treating varicose veins by injecting perchlorate of iron in 1853. Desgranges in 1854 cured 16 cases of varicose veins by injecting iodine and tannin into the veins. This was approximately 12 years after the probable advent of great saphenous vein stripping in 1844 by Madelung. However, due to high rates of side-effects with the drugs used at the time, sclerotherapy had been practically abandoned by 1894. With the improvements in surgical techniques and anaesthetics over that time, stripping became the treatment of choice.\n\nWork continued on alternative sclerosants in the early 20th century. During that time carbolic acid and perchlorate of mercury were tried and whilst these showed some effect in obliterating varicose veins, side-effects also caused them to be abandoned. Prof. Sicard and other French doctors developed the use of sodium carbonate and then sodium salicylate during and after the First World War. Quinine was also used with some effect during the early 20th century. At the time of Coppleson's book in 1929, he was advocating the use of sodium salicylate or quinine as the best choices of sclerosant.\n\nFurther work on improving the technique and development of safer more effective sclerosants continued through the 1940s and 1950s. Of particular importance was the development of sodium tetradecyl sulfate (STS) in 1946, a product still widely used to this day. George Fegan in the 1960s reported treating over 13,000 patients with sclerotherapy, significantly advancing the technique by focussing on fibrosis of the vein rather than thrombosis, concentrating on controlling significant points of reflux, and emphasizing the importance of compression of the treated leg. The procedure became medically accepted in mainland Europe during that time. However it was poorly understood or accepted in England or the United States, a situation that continues to this day amongst some sections of the medical community.\n\nThe next major development in the evolution of sclerotherapy was the advent of duplex ultrasonography in the 1980s and its incorporation into the practise of sclerotherapy later that decade. Knight was an early advocate of this new procedure and presented it at several conferences in Europe and the United States. Thibault's article was the first on this topic to be published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nThe work of Cabrera and Monfreaux in utilising foam sclerotherapy along with Tessari's \"3-way tap method\" of foam production further revolutionised the treatment of larger varicose veins with sclerotherapy. This has now been further modified by Whiteley and Patel to use 3 non-silicone syringes for more long lasting foam.\n\nInjecting the unwanted veins with a sclerosing solution causes the target vein to immediately shrink, and then dissolve over a period of weeks as the body naturally absorbs the treated vein. Sclerotherapy is a non-invasive procedure taking only about 10 minutes to perform. The downtime is minimal, in comparison to an invasive varicose vein surgery.\n\nSclerotherapy is the \"gold standard\" and is preferred over laser for eliminating large spider veins (telangiectasiae) and smaller varicose leg veins. Unlike a laser, the sclerosing solution additionally closes the \"feeder veins\" under the skin that are causing the spider veins to form, thereby making a recurrence of the spider veins in the treated area less likely. Multiple injections of dilute sclerosant are injected into the abnormal surface veins of the involved leg. The patient's leg is then compressed with either stockings or bandages that they wear usually for one week after treatment. Patients are also encouraged to walk regularly during that time. It is common practice for the patient to require at least two treatment sessions separated by several weeks to significantly improve the appearance of their leg veins.\n\nSclerotherapy can also be performed using microfoam sclerosants under ultrasound guidance to treat larger varicose veins, including the great and small saphenous veins. After a map of the patient's varicose veins is created using ultrasound, these veins are injected whilst real-time monitoring of the injections is undertaken, also using ultrasound. The sclerosant can be observed entering the vein, and further injections performed so that all the abnormal veins are treated. Follow-up ultrasound scans are used to confirm closure of the treated veins, and any residual varicose veins can be identified and treated.\n\nFoam sclerotherapy is a technique that involves injecting “foamed sclerosant drugs” within a blood vessel using a pair of syringes – one with sclerosant in it and one with gas (originally air). The original Tessari method has now been modified by the Whiteley-Patel modification which uses 3 syringes, all of which are silicone free. The sclerosant drugs (sodium tetradecyl sulfate or polidocanol) are mixed with air or a physiological gas (carbon dioxide) in a syringe or by using mechanical pumps. This increases the surface area of the drug. The foam sclerosant drug is more efficacious than the liquid one in causing sclerosis (thickening of the vessel wall and sealing off the blood flow), for it does not mix with the blood in the vessel and in fact displaces it, thus avoiding dilution of the drug and causing maximal sclerosant action. It is therefore useful for longer and larger veins. Experts in foam sclerotherapy have created “tooth paste” like thick foam for their injections, which has revolutionized the non-surgical treatment of varicose veins and venous malformations, including Klippel Trenaunay syndrome.\n\nA study by Kanter and Thibault in 1996 reported a 76% success rate at 24 months in treating saphenofemoral junction and great saphenous vein incompetence with STS 3% solution. Padbury and Benveniste found that ultrasound guided sclerotherapy was effective in controlling reflux in the small saphenous vein. Barrett et al. found that microfoam ultrasound guided sclerotherapy was \"effective in treating all sizes of varicose veins with high patient satisfaction and improvement in quality of life\".\n\nA Cochrane Collaboration review of the medical literature concluded that \"the evidence supports the current place of sclerotherapy in modern clinical practice, which is usually limited to treatment of recurrent varicose veins following surgery and thread veins.\" A second Cochrane Collaboration review comparing surgery to sclerotherapy concluded that sclerotherapy has greater benefits than surgery in the short term but surgery has greater benefits in the longer term. Sclerotherapy was better than surgery in terms of treatment success, complication rate and cost at one year, but surgery was better after five years. However, the evidence was not of very good quality and more research is needed.\n\nA Health Technology Assessment found that sclerotherapy provided less benefit than surgery, but is likely to provide a small benefit in varicose veins without reflux from the sapheno-femoral or sapheno-popliteal junctions. It did not study the relative benefits of surgery and sclerotherapy in varicose veins with junctional reflux.\n\nThe European Consensus Meeting on Foam Sclerotherapy in 2003 concluded that \"Foam sclerotherapy allows a skilled practitioner to treat larger veins including saphenous trunks\". A second European Consensus Meeting on Foam Sclerotherapy in 2006 has now been published.\n\nComplications, while rare, include venous thromboembolism, visual disturbances, allergic reaction, thrombophlebitis, skin necrosis, and hyperpigmentation or a red treatment area.\n\nIf the sclerosant is injected properly into the vein, there is no damage to the surrounding skin, but if it is injected outside the vein, tissue necrosis and scarring can result. Skin necrosis, whilst rare, can be cosmetically \"potentially devastating\", and may take months to heal. It is very rare when small amounts of dilute (<0.25%) sodium tetradecyl sulfate (STS) is used, but has been seen when higher concentrations (3%) are used. Blanching of the skin often occurs when STS is injected into arterioles (small artery branches). Telangiectatic matting, or the development of tiny red vessels, is unpredictable and usually must be treated with repeat sclerotherapy or laser.\n\nMost complications occur due to an intense inflammatory reaction to the sclerotherapy agent in the area surrounding the injected vein. In addition, there are systemic complications that are now becoming increasingly understood. These occur when the sclerosant travels through the veins to the heart, lung and brain. A recent report attributed a stroke to foam treatment, although this involved the injection of an unusually large amount of foam.\nMore recent reports have shown that bubbles from even a small amount of sclerosant foam injected into the veins quickly appear in the heart, lung and brain. The significance of this is not fully understood at this point and large studies show that foam sclerotherapy is safe. Sclerotherapy is fully FDA approved in the USA.\n\nContraindications include: bed rest, severe systemic diseases, poor patient understanding, needle phobia, short life expectancy, late stage cancer, known allergy to the sclerosing agent, and treatment with tamoxifen.\n\n"}

It features Lorenzo Music as the voice of Garfield the house cat, other regulars Thom Huge and Gregg Berger, and guest star Wolfman Jack. It originally aired on CBS on May 27, 1986.\n\nThis was the fifth of twelve Garfield television specials made between 1982 and 1991. The story concerns the characters visiting a tropical vacation destination. The special was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program and has been released on DVD.\n\nJon Arbuckle and Garfield take their third class airline trip to Paradise World, a cheapskate's version of Hawaii. When they arrived on the island, Jon and Garfield check in at a deserted motel and are soon disappointed to find out that there is no beach within sight of the motel, and only an empty swimming pool in the back. When Jon and Garfield enter their room, they find Odie hiding in their luggage. None of the trio has any fun until Jon, Garfield, and Odie plan to rent a car and search for a beach around the island. For a cheap price, they get a really nice and classic Chevrolet Bel Air to hit the beach and later begin to choose where to go when their car mysteriously speeds into a jungle on its own, stopping in the middle of a native village. Jon, Garfield, and Odie presume that they are in trouble until the natives begin kowtowing to their car. They meet the tribal chief (The High Ramma-Lamma) who explains that the villagers (The Ding-Dongs) learned English \"from watching a lot of beach movies\". In 1957, the Cruiser, a James Dean/Fonzie-styled legend, drove his car into the village and introduced the people to the 1950s pop culture. The Cruiser eventually saved the village by sacrificing himself and driving his car into a nearby volcano to prevent it from erupting. The village is now devoted to a 1950s lifestyle and believes that Jon's rental car is actually the same one the Cruiser owned.\n\nIn the village, Jon and Garfield find romance with the tribal princess, Owooda, and her cat, Mai-Tai. Meanwhile, the chief orders the village idiot, Monkey, to fix the car with Odie's assistance. Suddenly, the volcano begins to erupt and Owooda tells Jon that she and Mai-Tai must sacrifice themselves to save the village. However, the volcano rejects Owooda and Mai-Tai, and the village shaman, Pigeon, interprets that it wants the car instead, and if it does not have the car within thirty seconds, it will blow the island to pieces. Monkey and Odie make their last attempt to get the car fixed, which still does not work until Odie successfully taps the distributor cap with a hammer. The car finally starts and zooms through the village and up the volcano with Monkey driving and Odie hanging onto the hood. The car plummets into the crater, the volcano finally erupts, and the Cruiser's spirit and car's ghost drift out, speed off, and vanish into the night sky; the volcano is now at peace. Monkey and Odie are presumed dead until Garfield sees them climb out of the crater unharmed. Jon, Garfield, and the other villagers carry Monkey and Odie back to the village in a hero's fashion.\n\n\n\nThe special guest stars disc jockey Wolfman Jack as the tribal chief. Creator Jim Davis was excited to work with Jack on the special, explaining, \"It was just way fun. We did it for silliness.\" This was the final credit for Frank Nelson, who, once again, portrayed a variation on his recurring character from \"The Jack Benny Program\".\n\nThe special first aired on May 27, 1986, at prime time on CBS. It was aired again in subsequent years. An illustrated children's book adaptation was published by Ballantine Books in 1986.\n\nIn February 2005, the special was included on the DVD \"Garfield Travel Adventures\" along with the specials \"Garfield in the Rough\" (1984) and \"Garfield Goes Hollywood\" (1987). It was released on another DVD compilation, \"The Garfield Holiday Collection\", on November 4, 2014, sold only by Walmart, and was also made available for digital download on November 11 that year.\n\nThe special was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program in 1986. The only other nominee was another \"Garfield\" special, \"Garfield's Halloween Adventure\", which won.\n\nIn his 2005 DVD Talk review, Randy Miller III complimented the special on \"memorable characters\" specifically the James Dean doppelganger and Wolfman Jack's character, concluding, \"Plus, Jon gets some action.\" In 2008, Dan Walsh, creator of the website \"Garfield Minus Garfield\" recalled watching the specials and claimed, \"I can still do a perfect rendition of 'Hello Hawaii,' from \"Garfield in Paradise.\"\" In 2014, Jim Davis identified \"Garfield in Paradise\" as \"absolutely one of my favorites. It’s bright, funny, [there’s] rock n’ roll in it.\"\n\n"}

It lies along Arkansas's National Scenic 7 Byway between Harrison and Jasper. The Marble Falls Post Office is located in the parking lot of the now defunct theme park called Dogpatch USA. For a time, the town was known as Dogpatch to promote the theme park.\n\nMarble Falls is part of the Harrison Micropolitan Statistical Area.\n\nA Choctaw Indian named Ah-Che-To-Mah was the first settler known to have acquired title to land in the vicinity of Marble Falls. The waterfall once supplied power for a flour mill, cotton gin, and a saw mill. Peter Beller built the original water-powered grist mill there \"circa\", and this mill was later rebuilt and remodeled by several different owners.\n\nThe community was originally named Marble City, after the marble that was quarried nearby. Marble City became known as a health resort in the 1880s, through the advertisements of businessmen such as Dr. Silas Scruggs Stacey, proprietor of the Stacey family store and provider of Dr. S. S. Staceys Sulpher Mountain Bitters (which sold briskly for $1 per bottle).\n\nIn 1836, William Harp and his brothers, Elijah and Samuel, with Peter Bellah quarried a large block of marble at Marble City by drilling and wedging. They put the marble on a log wagon and, with ten yoke of oxen to pull it, moved it 60 miles across the Boston Mountains to the Arkansas River near Clarksville, where it was shipped to Washington, D.C. The block of marble (with\" Arkansas\" chiseled on it), along with other memorial stones, is located on the 30 foot level of the Washington Monument.\n\nThe first post office was established September 24, 1883, and the first postmaster, Mander Willcockson, officially renamed the community Willcockson. On October 29, 1917, Ida T. Chesbro was appointed U. S. Postmaster of Willcockson. Absalom C. Phillips,a local preacher, added the cotton gin about 1890. After 1900, the town began to fade away, and the mills and gin were destroyed sometime in the early 1900s. By 1915, many began to leave the area due to economic depression.\n\nAlbert Raney, Sr., who became postmaster in 1934, had the official name changed to Marble Falls.\n\nWhen the Raney property was purchased in 1966 by the developers of Dogpatch USA, Governor Orval Faubus and some developers had the area's postal designation changed to Dogpatch, and it would appear that way on highway maps. The theme park closed in 1993, and in 1997 the citizens of the area voted unanimously to change the postal designation back to Marble Falls, the name it has today.\n\nThe only lift serviced skiing ever in Arkansas was offered at the Marble Falls Resort beginning circa 1972 and lasting until the 1980s.\n\n\n"}

Colt manufactured the launcher for field testing during the Vietnam era. After problems with the experimental design were discovered, the XM148 was replaced by AAI Corporation's conceptually similar M203 design, currently the primary grenade launcher used by the US armed forces and others today.\n\nThe Colt XM148 grenade launcher was created by Colt's Design Project Engineer, gun designer Karl R. Lewis. The May 1967 \"Colt's Ink\" newsletter announced that he had won a national competition for his selection and treatment of materials in the design. The newsletter stated in part, \"In only 47 days, he wrote the specifications, designed the launcher, drew all the original prints, and had a working model built.\"\n\nThe weapon was designed for installation below the barrel of M16-type rifles, and was intended to replace the stand-alone M79 correcting the problem of grenadiers relying on pistols as a secondary weapon.\n\nIn July 1966 the US Government contracted Colt Firearms to provide nearly 20,000 XM-148s with the weapon arriving in South Vietnam in December 1966. The weapon was pulled from service in the fall of 1967.\n\nOriginally made for use with the M16 Rifle, the XM148 was used by US Special Forces in conjunction with the XM177E2 and the Australian Special Air Service Regiment in conjunction with the modified L1A1 and Sterling Submachine Gun. The weapon was also adopted by the United States Air Force Security Forces in 1968.\n\nThe launcher's barrel could slide forward to accept a single 40 mm round into the breech. It came with a primitive version of the quadrant sight later used with the M203. It differed from the later model by featuring an external cocking handle and an extended trigger that allowed the weapon to be fired without removing the hand from the rifle's pistol grip. This same extended trigger was also one source of the weapon's problems as it allowed accidental discharges of a loaded weapon if caught by tree branches, gear, or anything else capable of overcoming the 6 to 11 pound trigger pull.\n\nAnother problem with the weapon was that it was overcomplicated compared to the M203. It was difficult to disassemble and had many small parts that could be easily lost while cleaning the weapon in the field. Where the M203 broke down into receiver group, barrel group, hand guard group and quadrant sight (the quadrant sight being the smallest piece), the XM148 broke down into barrel, pistol grip, receiver, hand guard, quadrant sight, and several small pins and clips. These issues led the U.S. military to adopt the M203 over the XM148, though the U.S. Air Force did keep a number of the XM148s. In fact U.S. Air Force Security Forces were still being trained on the XM148 in lieu of the M203 as late as 1989. Some security police units still had them in their armories until the 1990s.\n\n\n"}

The game won several awards, and reviewers recognized it as well-written. \n\nAs of 2018, the game is only available as a PDF file download from the publisher.\n\nThe prototypical setting of the role-playing game is in an unspecified Central European country in the early 19th century. Players in the game portray the Igor-like minions of an evil Master (or Mistress) who preys on the nearby Townsfolk.\n\nLike most role-playing games, there is a Gamemaster (GM). In this case the GM plays the part of the Master. However, the GM and players together are supposed to \"design\" the Master, in terms of defining his \"Wants\", \"Needs\", \"Aspect\", and \"Type\". These traits have no explicit mechanical effect, but are used to define the desires and mannerisms of the Master and how he interacts with the Townsfolk and his minions. Masters have two game statistics, \"Fear\" (a measure of his power over minions) and \"Reason\" (how much minions and Townsfolk can resist the Master's control over them). \n\nIn contrast, the Master's minions, the characters portrayed by the players, are defined (in terms of game statistics) by their levels of \"Weariness\" and \"Self-loathing\", and the connections of \"Love\" that they have (successfully or unsuccessfully) tried to make with the Townsfolk. Self-loathing is a measure of the power that a minion has to intimidate the Townsfolk, while Weariness limits their abilities to complete their tasks. Love allows minions to resist their Master and his demands on them. \n\nGameplay is generally resolved through a series of \"scenes\". A player describes what their minion is trying to do, be it carrying out their Master's wishes or trying to resist him, interacting with the Townsfolk, attempting an act of Love (which could result in increasing their \"Love\" trait, or increasing their \"Self-loathing\" if the attempt fails), etc. A series of dice rolls are used to determine success or failure, and then the scene is played out according to that outcome.\n\nUnlike other role-playing games that may have long campaigns, \"My Life with Master\" games are typically designed to end after a small number of playing sessions. As one reviewer stated, \"My Life with Master\" \"strives to tell a story, and stories have endings.\" Usually, a game culminates with the death of the Master at the hands of one (or more) of his minions. Sometimes, the Master dies because the Townsfolk are \"sick of his predations\" and \"storm his domicile -- pitchforks in hand and torches aflame\". Some or all of the players' characters might also meet their end in the hands of the Townsfolk, or the Master kills them as they try to resist his commands and suffer the consequences of their failure.\n\n\"My Life with Master\" won the 2004 Diana Jones Award.\nIn addition, it also won the 2003 Out of the Box Award for \"Best Sui Generis RPG\"\nand the 2003 \"Indie Roleplaying Game of the Year\".\n\nSteve Darlington, in his review, stated that \"even if you never play this game, you will be smarter simply for having read it\" since \"it quickly becomes hard to distinguish [Czege's] choice of attributes from a high-level academic deconstruction of the character tropes in gothic horror films at a level which could easily be found on a college reading list.\" He also said that it is \"one of the very few horror games that may actually need disclaimers, and maybe even safe words too\" for its \"darker subtext\" about escaping from abusive relationships.\n\nAccording to Heather Barnhorst \"Czege writes with wit and doesn't fear to let his understanding of game theory shine through. Colin Theriot's illustrations evoke exactly the right mood for the setting and are enjoyable as stand-alone art.\"\n\nReviewer Matthew Pook warned that \"Despite the simplicity of the [game] mechanics ... they are not as clearly written as they need to be ... The GM will need to make a close read of the otherwise well-written text to help grasp how the outcome of a scene will alter a minion's statistics.\" He concluded his review stating \"although not going to be everyone's cup of tea, \"My Life With Master\" is the most interesting roleplaying game released this year [2003] and perhaps the most challenging.\" \n\nGame designer Greg Costikyan has praised \"My Life with Master\" for the way it \"evokes emotions and feelings rare in games\", and considers it to work in part because the Gothic horror theme has \"a defined narrative arc: hubris and terror, followed by a fall\".\n\n"}

The location he recorded, , accurately matches the location given by Russian topographic mapping and SRTM data, although these sources show its height to be slightly lower, at 1,052 meters. However, SRTM data has been demonstrated to have about 5-9m vertical accuracy, while most tracking grade handheld GPS receivers also have several meters of vertical inaccuracy. Only accurate DGPS or RTK-GPS survey, or airborne LIDAR/photogrammetric survey can yield more accurate result. Recently two trekking clubs counted the height of \"Saka Haphong\" as 3,488 and 3,461 feet, respectively. Any of these two figure would make it the highest mountain in Bangladesh exceeding the height of Keokaradong, which is 3,172 feet high.\nThis peak is also known as Mowdok Taung (as per USGS Topo and Russian Topo map), Saka Haphong (by local Tripura tribes). Mowdok Taung was the official name that appeared in all British India topographic maps of 1938, 1939 and 1948 which is also reflected in US Army Corps of Engineers Map of 1954. Because no name change notification by the governments of India till 1947, government of Pakistan till 1971 or the Government of Bangladesh afterward was found anywhere, 'Mowdok Taung' still presumably remains as the official and the most authentic name for this peak. Since 2007 till now route to Saka Haphong is the most desired trekking route for adventure lovers in Bangladesh.\n\nZow Tlang is guarding the eastern horizon of Bangladesh and Myanmar border. In Bawm language the term Zow means Mizo (Mizo is derived from Mizoram, India. Probable reason is that Bangladesh was a part of greater India before 1947) and Tlang means Mountain. According to American and Russian topographic maps Zow Tlang is mentioned as Mowdok Mual. As per Bangla Trek, it is the second-highest peak of the country; though it is not officially recognized by the government till date. Many accomplished local adventurers describe this as one of the most wildest peak of Bangladesh.\n\nThe peak was first summitted in 2005 by two Bangladeshi adventurers, Subrata Das Nitish and Bijoy Shankar Kar. The same team summitted the mountain again in 2007. The altitude couldn't be measured in these two expeditions as the team wasn't carrying any GPS device. On January 12, 2012, the peak was summitted for the third time by the Bangla Trek team members Tashdid Rezwan Mugdho, Tarikul Alom Sujon, Salehin Arshady and SM Mainul. Measured altitude and Geo location of the peak by their Garmin eTrex 20 was 1021.69 meter and 21°40'23.78″N & 92°36'16.01″E. Two of the team members, Mugdho and Sujon died in a tragic bus accident on their way back to Bandarban after the expedition. The other two members, Salehin and Mainul suffered serious injuries and it took them a long time to recover.\n\nOn October 13, 2013, a team led by Shahzaman Chowdhury Hira became the third team to summit the peak at 1400 hrs. This team was having 6 members - Sharfaraj Hussain Jony, Sidratul Afia Mohona, Mahbubur Rahman, Abdullah Anas Oni and Baqui Billah Milon. Member of this team Mohona was the first woman ever to summit this very peak. Several other teams have made their way to the summit in last few years.\n\nIn 2011 Md. Wadud Mohosin Rubel with his three travel fellows, Asif Aminur Rashid, Nagib Meshkat & Abdul Haque have claimed the mountain \"Dumlong\" to be the second-highest mountain; on the basis of Garmin GPS they have measured the height of the mountain which is 3314 feet. The location he recorded, 22°02′02.1″N 92°35′36.3″E, accurately matches the location given by Google Earth. Few months after this expedition, travelers of Bangladesh team led by Zaqiul Deep measured this peak which was 3,312 feet. Few months later Fahim hasan of BD Explorer Reached the summit of Dumlong as 3rd team. Surely there is no doubt about the height of Dumlong peak but whether it is the second- or third-highest peak of the country, is not confirmed yet. It is the highest peak of Rangamati hill district and also the one of only three 1000 meters peaks in Bangladesh. In 2014, several teams have summitted Zow Tlang and based on their readings it can be said that Dumlong is the third-highest peak of the country.\n\nAlthough it is widely reported to be the highest point in Bangladesh at 1,230 meters, recent SRTM data, GPS readings and Russian topographic mapping show that its true height is less than 1,000 meters.\n\nOn the top of Keokradong there is a small shelter and a signboard put up by the Bangladeshi military proclaiming the altitude to be 3172 feet. Garmin GPS recorded 974 meters (3196 feet) at this location, a different team measured 986m with 3m accuracy by GPS, a measurement consistent with Russian topographic mapping and SRTM data. It is at . USGS and Russian mapping dispute the claim that this is the location correctly named Keokradong; they show Keokradong at an 883m summit further north.\n\nLocated at the south-eastern part of Chittagong hill tracts between Bangladesh-India border area, Maithaijama Haphong is the sixth-highest peak of Bangladesh. But it is not officially recognized according to the Bangladesh government. This peak is also the second-highest peak of Reng Tlang range after Dumlong. In 2014, 7 December Fahim Hasan from Dhaka, member of an adventure team BD Explorer with the helps of the local villagers summited the peak of Maithai jama Haphong and measured this peak as 3,174 feet/967 meters by Garmin gps device for the first time. Exact Geo location of the highest point was N 22°00.714', E 92°35.863'.\"Maithai jam Haphong\" name came from Tripura language, which means,\"Bad hilly place for vegetation\". According to Tripura language \"Haphong\" means hill. Stream(jhiri) route to summit & view from the peak is extraordinary.\n\nThingdawlte Tlang is a significant peak of Bangladesh. This peak is the highest point of 'lawmbok Row' range and possible seventh-highest of the country. In December 2012 a local explorer Fahim Hasan of \"BD Explorer\" summitted the peak of Thingdawlte Tlang and measured the height for the first time, which is 3149 feet(959.8 m). GPS accuracy was 3m(+/-). The name of the peak was collected by BD Explorer and confirmed by the local tribal people of Thingdawlte village. Few days later Zaqiul Deep of \"Travelers Of Bangladesh\" measured this peak as 3,133 feet(955m). The most easiest route to summit this peak is to start from Ruma of Bandarban district. Nearest settlement is known as Thingdawlte (Bawm) village. This peak is named after this village.\n\nMukhra Thuthai Haphong is a significant border peak of Bangladesh, situated at the southern part of Belaichori of Rangamati Hill District. In April 2013, Fahim Hasan of BD Explorer summited and measured this peak for the first time. Elevation measured at 953.6 meters (3,129 ft). The name of the peak was collected by BD Explorer and confirmed by the local tribal people of Dhupanichora village. The name Mukhra Thuthai Haphong came from the Tripura language. Nearest settlement is known as Dhupanichora para. The easiest route to summit this peak is to start from Ruma of Bandarban district.\n\nKapital/Capital is a distinctive, beautiful and very eye-catching peak on the Politai range near Thaikeng para. This flat mountain top once used as a hide out place by separatist group from Mizoram. They declared this mountain top as their temporary capital of free and independent Mizoram. Later they moved from this place. Still the locals called this mountain top as kapital.\n\n\nSippi Arsuang measured by a local group located at N 22°11′03.43″ E 92°29′01.57″ with height 896m (15m accuracy). In US Army 1:250k topo map this peak is shown as Ramju Taung with a height of 3016feet and in Russian 1:200k topo map it is shown as 917m.\n\nTaung Prai, a very beautiful dome-shaped mountain at Reng Tlang border range is the most south-eastern border peak of Rangamati district. It is also the last major peak at Reng Tlang range inside our border. View seen from the top is mind-blowing. Taung prai is a Marma word. Means \"Ulta pahar\"(উল্টা পাহাড়). In 2013,6 November Fahim Hasan along with Saki Khan from Dhaka, members of local adventure group BD Explorer summited the peak of Taung Prai and measured this peak as 2,959 feet by Garmin gps device for the first time.\n\nTinmukh/Tinmatha pillar is a significant border pillar which marks the meet point of the three countries border-Bangladesh, Myanmar and India, located above a peak in between \"Mukhra Thuthai Haphong\" and \"Laisra Haphong\".\n\nAnother peak that is sometimes claimed to be the peak of Bangladesh is Tazing Dong (sometimes spelled as Tahjingdong, and also known as Bijoy). It has been claimed to be 1,280 meters. Neither Russian topographic mapping nor SRTM data show anything in the area exceeding 1,000 meters.\n\nThere are three peaks in that area known as Thajindong (Lungphe Tuang in US army 1:250K topo map and Russian 1:200k topo map). A local trekker team measured the highest two peaks and found the middle one (N 21° 49' 16.20\" - E 92° 32' 11.61\") is 871m (3m accuracy) and higher than the other peak which was at N 21° 48' 58.17\" - E 92° 31' 49.87\" with 829m (accuracy 3m) measured height. A different measurement done by another team using Garmin GPS shows the height of the other peak as 829.66m with 3m accuracy \n\nAiyang Tlang is a mountain of Bangladesh . It is situated in Bangladesh–Myanmar border.\n\nMr. Van Rausang Bawm, from local \"Bawm ethnic community\" of \"Dalian headman para\" of \"Remakri\" mouja, Thanchi upozilla, Bandarban dristrict, is the first man, who discovered it .\n\n13 November 2019, Engineer Mr.Jyotirmoy Dhar, being a first Bangladeshi, he was able to climb the peak of \"Aiyang Tlang\" mountain. Engineer Mr.Jyotirmoy Dhar was able to discover the nook and corner of the mountain and the coordinate of the mountain was measured by him, longitude is 21°40′23.78″N and latitude is 92°36′16.01″E . Its height was measured 3298 feet high above sea level with a Global positioning system (GPS) device, by Engineer Mr.Jyotirmoy Dhar.\n\nThe headman of Dalian Headman Para of \"Remakri\" mouja, Thanchi upozilla, Bandarban dristrict, \"Mr. Lal Ram Bawm\" has ensured the authenticity of expedition of Engineer Mr.Jyotirmoy Dhar . The expedition is recorded in the nearest B.G.B camp.\n\nEngineer Jyotirmoy Dhar dedicated his discovery and summit to his beloved person Dr. Rini Dhar and on her name he kept the name of this newly discovered peak in Bengali Language \"Rinir Chura\".\n\n"}

It is Campbell's feature film directorial debut. The film was co-written by David Goodman and co-stars Ted Raimi.\n\nBruce Campbell plays William Cole, the wealthy CEO of a U.S. drug company who travels to Bulgaria with his wife, Jackie in the hopes of diversifying his company's financial interests. Cole is a stereotypical ugly American who constantly complains about the lack of Americanization of the former communist country. They're driven to a hotel by a taxi driver, and former KGB agent, named Yegor Stragov, in which Yegor gives William a ring to give to Jackie. While William is at the construction of a subway, Jackie secretly cheats on William with Yegor.\n\nWilliam gets back to the hotel and bumps into the hotel maid and gypsy, Tatoya, who kills men that date and dump her. Jackie then comes in, catches William kissing Tatoya and dumps him. William chases Tatoya, who had taken William's money and ring (which is revealed to be Tatoya's that she gave to Yegor when they dated), and Tatoya knocks him in the head with a pipe outside the hotel. Yegor witnesses this and so Tatoya kills Yegor with his own gun.\n\nA vengeful Jackie has Cole's life support plug pulled in hospital, and then goes to Gypsy Town where Tatoya lives and attempts to kill her, only to have Tatoya kill her by throwing her down a flight of stairs. Meanwhile, William wakes up in the warehouse of a Russian scientist named Dr. Ivan Ivanovich Ivanov, and his idiotic assistant Pavel, who had taken damaged parts of William's brain and replaced it with healthy tissue from Yegor's. When William runs out of the warehouse, he discovers he can hear Yegor's voice in his head, and they both plan to \"get the woman that killed us both\". Jackie, who had also been picked up by Dr. Ivanov and Pavel, has her brain put inside a robot, and so she escapes and also plans to exact revenge on Tatoya.\n\nWilliam/Yegor and Robo-Jackie chase Tatoya around town. William gets involved in a car crash with his foot underneath a car and Tatoya makes another attempt to kill William by setting the leaking car gasoline alight. Jackie saves him and is presumed dead in the explosion. After avoiding some bar punks that believe William \"raped Tatoya on her wedding day\", William/Yegor begin suffering brain damage due to their cells not able to coexist in the same head. Jackie, who had survived the explosion, appears and attempts to kill Tatoya by throwing her off a bridge, until Jackie stabs her brain, causing her to malfunction, and has Jackie thrown off the bridge. William chases Tatoya through the subway construction and the sewer and finally kills Tatoya by dropping her in sewer river, after obtaining the ring back. William and Jackie then confess their love for each other before Jackie's batteries finally die, as does William due to the brain cells of him and Yegor. Pavel brings William, Jackie and Tatoya's body back to Dr. Ivanov to fix them, as he had earlier found a way to make William and Yegor's brain cells coexist in the same head.\n\nThe movie ends with William back in the U.S. six months later, still sharing his body with Yegor's brain. He goes to a brain trauma benefit with Jackie, whose brain had been transferred into Tatoya's body.\n\n\nThe story for \"Man with the Screaming Brain\" has existed in various forms since the mid-1980s. It was originally supposed to take place in East L.A., but after the fall of communism it was shot in Bulgaria instead, in order to save production costs.\n\nThe production was financed in part by the Sci Fi Channel, where it was aired for the first time on television on September 25, 2005. It premiered on April 3, 2005 at the IHouse in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It was supposed to premiere that same night at the Broadway Theater in Pitman, New Jersey; however, that theater went bankrupt earlier in the week and a new venue was found (the IHouse).\n\nCampbell then took the film with him on his book tour and it was shown at a limited number of theaters throughout the summer of 2005.\n\nRotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 33% of 12 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating was 4.9/10. Joshua Siebalt of Dread Central rated it 3/5 stars and wrote, \"The story is pretty ridiculous from start to finish, but that's not necessarily a bad thing since the film doesn't take itself seriously at all.\" Rob Gonsalves of eFilmCritic.com rated it 4/5 stars and called it \"a decent and diverting piece of work from perhaps the hardest-working man in movies.\"\n\nNegative reviews came from Dennis Harvey of \"Variety\", who called it \"a comedy that doesn't build, lacks structural integrity, and often falls flat. But it's also winningly loopy, with bizarre incidental ideas and performance riffing making for a series of parts that almost make up for the faults of the whole\", and Mark de la Viña of \"San Jose Mercury News\", who called it \"an unapologetically sloppy jumble of Roger Corman-style antics that could only hope to inspire their own drinking game.\"\n\nDark Horse Comics published a four-issue comic book series based on the film.\n\n"}

{"id": "2187296", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2187296", "title": "Disaster response", "text": "Disaster response\n\nDisaster response is the second phase of the disaster management cycle. It consists of a number of elements, for example; warning/evacuation, search and rescue, providing immediate assistance, assessing damage, continuing assistance and the immediate restoration or construction of infrastructure (i.e. provisional storm drains or diversion dams).The aim of emergency response is to provide immediate assistance to maintain life, improve health and support the morale of the affected population. Such assistance may range from providing specific but limited aid, such as assisting refugees with transport, temporary shelter, and food, to establishing semi-permanent settlement in camps and other locations. It also may involve initial repairs to damaged or diversion to infrastructure.\n\nThe focus in the response phase is on putting people safe, prevent need disasters and meeting the basic needs of the people until more permanent and sustainable solutions can be found. The main responsibility to address these needs and respond to a disaster lies with the government or governments in whose territory the disaster has occurred. In addition, Humanitarian organizations are often strongly present in this phase of the disaster management cycle, particularly in countries where the government lacks the resources to respond adequately to the needs.\n\nA \"disaster\", noun, is defined as a calamitous event, especially one occurring suddenly and causing great loss of life, damage or hardship such as a flood, aircraft crash or an angry person. \"Response\" is defined (in this context) as: Noun: An answer or reply, as in words or in some action.\n\nThe Business Dictionary provide a more comprehensive definition for \"disaster response\"; Aggregate of decisions and measures to (1) contain or mitigate the effects of a disastrous event to prevent any further loss of life and/or property, (2) restore order in its immediate aftermath, and (3) re-establish normality through reconstruction and re-rehabilitation shortly thereafter. The first and immediate response is called emergency response.\n\nThe Johns Hopkins and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) state: \"The word disaster implies a sudden overwhelming and unforeseen event. At the household level, a disaster could result in a major illness, death, a substantial economic or social misfortune. At the community level, it could be a flood, a fire, a collapse of buildings in an earthquake, the destruction of livelihoods, an epidemic or displacement through conflict. When occurring at district or provincial level, a large number of people can be affected.\"\n\nA recent case study of a disaster response undertaken by the IFRC can be viewed here.\n\nThe level of disaster response depends on a number of factors and particular situation awareness. Studies undertaken by Son, Aziz and Peña-Mora (2007) shows that \"initial work demand gradually spreads and increases based on a wide range of variables including scale of disaster, vulnerability of affected area which in turn is affected by population density, site-specific conditions (e.g. exposure to hazardous conditions) and effects of cascading disasters resulting from inter-dependence between elements of critical infrastructure\".\n\nIn the British Government's Emergency Response and Recovery guidance, disaster response refers to decisions and actions taken in accordance with the strategic, tactical and operational objectives defined by emergency responders. At a high level these will be to protect life, contain and mitigate the impacts of the emergency and create the conditions for a return to normality. Response encompasses the decisions and actions taken to deal with the immediate effects of an emergency. In many scenarios it is likely to be relatively short and to last for a matter of hours or days—rapid implementation of arrangements for collaboration, co-ordination and communication are, therefore, vital. Response encompasses the effort to deal not only with the direct effects of the emergency itself (e.g. fighting fires, rescuing individuals) but also the indirect effects (e.g. disruption, media interest).\n\nCommon objectives for responders are:\n\nThe United States National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 1600 Standard (NFPA, 2010) specify elements of an emergency response, as: defined responsibilities; specific actions to be taken (which must include protective actions for life safety); and communication directives. Within the standard, NFPA recognize that disasters and day-to-day emergencies are characteristically different. Nevertheless, the prescribed response elements are the same.\n\nIn support of the NFPA standard, Statoil's (2013) practical application of emergency response is across three distinct \"lines\" that incorporate NFPA's elements. Line 1 is responsible for the operational management of an incident; line 2, typically housed off-site, is responsible for tactical guidance and additional resource management. Finally, in the case of major incidents, line 3 provides strategic guidance, group resource management, and government and media relations.\n\nWhile it is impossible to plan for every disaster, crisis or emergency, the Statoil investigation into the terrorist attacks on In Amenas place emphasis on the importance of having a disaster response. The report concludes that a disaster response framework may be utilized in an array of disaster situations, such as that at In Amenas.\n\nThe United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA); is responsible for bringing together humanitarian actors to ensure a coherent response to emergencies that require an international response. OCHA plays a key role in operational coordination in crisis situations. This includes assessing situations and needs; agreeing common priorities; developing common strategies to address issues such as negotiating access, mobilizing funding and other resources; clarifying consistent public messaging; and monitoring progress.\n\nThe organisation in the United Kingdom for the provision of communications disaster response is RAYNET. The UK organisation for the provision of disaster response by off-road vehicles is 4x4 Response.\n\nIn Canada, GlobalMedic was established in 1998 as a non-sectarian humanitarian-aid NGO to provide disaster relief services to large scale catastrophes around the world. \"Time\" magazine recognized the work of GlobalMedic in its 2010 \"Time\" 100 issue. It has a roster of over 1,000 volunteers from across Canada that includes professional rescuers, police officers, firefighters and paramedics who donate their time to respond to international disasters. Their personnel are divided into Rapid Response Teams (RRTs) that operate rescue units, Water Purification Units (WPUs) designed to provide safe drinking water; and Emergency Medical Units (EMUs) that use inflatable field hospitals to provide emergency medical treatment. Since 2004, GlobalMedic teams have deployed to over 60 humanitarian disasters around the world.\n\nIn India, the National Disaster Management Authority is responsible for planning for mitigating effects of natural disasters and anticipating and avoiding man-made disasters. It also coordinates the capacity-building and response of government agencies to crises and emergencies. The National Disaster Response Force is an inter-government disaster response agency that specializes in search, rescue and rehabilitation.\n\nIn the US, the Federal Emergency Management Agency coordinates federal operational and logistical disaster response capability needed to save and sustain lives, minimize suffering, and protect property in a timely and effective manner in communities that become overwhelmed by disasters. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offer information for specific types of emergencies, such as disease outbreaks, natural disasters and severe weather, as well as chemical and radiation accidents. Also, the Emergency Preparedness and Response Program of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health develops resources to address responder safety and health during responder and recovery operations.\n\nAmong volunteers, the American Red Cross is chartered by Congress in 1900 to lead and coordinate non-profit efforts. They are supported by disaster relief organizations from many religious denominations and community service agencies. Licensed amateur radio operators support most volunteer organizations, and are often affiliated with the American Radio Relay League (ARRL).\n\nIn addition to the response by the government, a great deal of assistance in the wake of any disaster comes from charities, disaster response and non-governmental organizations. The biggest international umbrella organizations are the Inter-Agency Standing Committee and the International Council of Voluntary Agencies.\n\nHumanitarian OSM Team works to update and provide map in areas struck by disaster.\n\nSmart Emergency Response System (SERS) prototype was built in the SmartAmerica Challenge 2013-2014, a United States government initiative. SERS has been created by a team of nine organizations led by MathWorks. The project was featured at the White House in June 2014 and described by Todd Park (U.S. Chief Technology Officer) as an exemplary achievement.\n\nThe SmartAmerica initiative challenges the participants to build cyber-physical systems as a glimpse of the future to save lives, create jobs, foster businesses, and improve the economy. SERS primarily saves lives. The system provides the survivors and the emergency personnel with information to locate and assist each other during a disaster. SERS allows to submit help requests to a MATLAB-based mission center connecting first responders, apps, search-and-rescue dogs, a 6-feet-tall humanoid, robots, drones, and autonomous aircraft and ground vehicles. The command and control center optimizes the available resources to serve every incoming requests and generates an action plan for the mission. The Wi-Fi network is created on the fly by the drones equipped with antennas. In addition, the autonomous rotorcrafts, planes, and ground vehicles are simulated with Simulink and visualized in a 3D environment (Google Earth) to unlock the ability to observe the operations on a mass scale.\n\nThe International Charter Space and Major Disasters provides for the charitable retasking of satellite assets, providing coverage from 15 space agencies, etc. which is wide albeit contingent. It focuses on the beginning of the disaster cycle, when timely data is of the essence.\n\nDigital technologies are increasingly being used in humanitarian action, they have shown to improve the health and recovery of populations affected by both natural and man-made disasters. They are used in humanitarian response to facilitate and coordinate aid in various stages including preparedness, response, and recovery from emergencies. More specifically, mobile health (mHealth), which is defined as the use of communication devices such as mobile phones for the purpose of health services information. Nowadays, millions of people use mobile phones as a means of daily communication and data transference, out of which 64% live in developing countries. One of the most important characteristics of disasters are the harms caused to infrastructures, accessibility issues, and an exponential need of medical and emergency services. In such situations, the use of mobile phones for mHealth can be vital, especially when other communication infrastructures are hindered. In such conditions, the abundance of mobile technology in developing countries provide the opportunity to be harnessed for helping victims and vulnerable people.\n\nMobile health information technology platforms, in the acute phase of disaster response, create a common operational framework that improves disaster response by standardizing data acquisition, organizing information storage, and facilitating communication among medical staff. One of the challenges in disaster response is the need of pertinent, effective and continuous analysis of the situation and information in order to evaluate needs and resources. mHealth has been shown to provide effective disaster preparedness with real time collection of medical data as well as helping identify and create needs assessments during disasters. Using mobile technology in heath has set the stage for the dynamic organization of medical resources and promotion of patient care done through quick triage, patient tracking, and documentation storage and maintenance.\n\nManaging an effective and influential response requires cooperation, which is also facilitated through mHealth. A retrospective study demonstrated that applying mHealth can lead to up to 15% decrease of unnecessary hospital transfers during disasters. In addition, they provide field hospital administrators with real-time census information essential for planning, resource allocation, inter-facility patient transfers, and inter-agency collaboration. mHealth technology systems can improve post-operative care and patient handoffs between volunteer providers. Data entry with mobile devices is now widely used to facilitate the registration of displaced individuals, to conduct surveys, identify those in need of assistance, and to capture data on issues such as food security, vaccination rates, and mortality.\n\nAbove all, mHealth can harness the power of information to improve patient outcomes. Efforts lead by the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative and Operational Medicine Institute during the Haiti earthquake resulted in the creation of a web-based mHealth system that created a patient log of 617 unique entries used by on-the-ground medical providers and field hospital administrators. This helped facilitate provider triage, improve provider handoffs, and track vulnerable populations such as unaccompanied minors, pregnant women, traumatic orthopedic injuries and specified infectious diseases. Also, during the Haiti earthquake, the International Red Crescent sent more than 45 million SMSs to Viole mobile phone users. This resulted in 95% of the receiver reporting they had gained useful information, and out of these 90% reported the SMS helped in their preparedness.\n\n\n Citations \n\n"}

It was the first joint venture agreement to be signed in South India after Independence. This resulted in the establishment of the TI Cycle factory in a mango grove in Ambattur by 1951, and manufacture of the 'Hercules India' bicycle soon began. By 1954, the word 'India' was dropped from the name when international quality standards were met.\n\nIn 1954, Sir Ivan signed his second joint venture, Tube Products India, with the Murugappa family. The factory was established on what had been the British Government of Malaya's Immigration Camp. By 1956, production was started in the new factory and soon resulted in the establishment of other TI factories in the Ambattur-Avadi industrial stretch. This led to a rapid growth in population in the region and several public amenities were established in Ambattur by TI company, such as the Sir Ramaswami Mudaliar Higher Secondary School (named after the person who had initially introduced the partners to each other), a post office and a bank. When the growing population demanded a hospital, the company established one between Ambattur and Avadi in 1966 from a gift of around £5,000 from Sir Ivan. The hospital was named the Sir Ivan Stedeford Hospital in his honour.\n\nAmbattur comes under the Sriperumbudur Parliamentary constituency. It was previously under the North Chennai parliamentary constituency, and, along with Villivakkam, it was the largest assembly constituency in India. The Fame organisation sangam originated here. The delimitation process of assembly constituencies had given Ambattur a new identity of its own: Constituency No. 8, Tamil Nadu. Once a major panchayat, Ambattur was made a township in the 1960s and a selection-grade municipality from April 1975. In May 1992, it was raised to special-grade municipality. It was a municipality till October 2011. It had been divided into 52 wards. Ambattur Municipality included Padi, Korattur, Mogappair, kallikuppam, Ayapakkam TNHB and the Ambattur Industrial Estate areas.\n\nOn 15 June 2011, the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu submitted a memorandum to the Prime Minister of India to expand the city limits of Chennai by which the Ambattur Municipality would come under the new scheme.\n\nSince 2011, it is part of Chennai Corporation as Zone 7 with 15 wards (Ward Nos. 79 to 91, 93).\n\nAccording to the 2011 census, Ambattur had a population of 466,205 with a sex-ratio of 985 females for every 1,000 males, much above the national average of 929. A total of 48,444 were under the age of six, constituting 24,829 males and 23,615 females. Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes accounted for 11.49 percent and 0.33 percent of the population, respectively. The average literacy of the town was 82.61 percent, compared with the national average of 72.99 percent. The town had 120,248 households. There were 184,390 workers, comprising 1,252 cultivators, 1,128 main agricultural labourers, 2,467 in house hold industries, 159,242 other workers, 20,301 marginal workers, 507 marginal cultivators, 453 marginal agricultural labourers, 641 marginal workers in household industries and 18,700 other marginal workers. As per the religious census of 2011, Ambattur had 86.53% Hindus, 3.68% Muslims, 8.95% Christians, 0.05% Sikhs, 0.04% Buddhists, 0.17% Jains, 0.57% following other religions and 0.01% following no religion or did not indicate any religious preference.\n\nDuring 2001–2011, Ambattur registered a population growth of 54 percent.\n\nAmbattur has two main waterbodies, namely the Ambattur Eri and the Chithu Oragadam Lake and the bigger Puzhal eri on the outskirts. The upkeep of the Ambattur Eri is plagued by problems such as dumping of garbage, water mining and construction of buildings and the Chithu Oragadam (Thangal) Eri suffers due to pollution by sewage. The local body generates nearly 250 tonnes of garbage daily.\n\nAmbattur has a stormwater drain network of 177.95 km, the largest of the eight zones newly added to the Corporation of Chennai in 2011.\n\nThe economy of Ambattur is mainly industrial. It was well known as an auto ancillary hub. However, in the late 2000s many IT companies have come up in Ambattur.\n\nThe Ambattur Industrial Estate, spread over an area of 1,430 acres (4.9 km), houses about 1,800 units and is the biggest small scale industrial estate in South Asia. It was commissioned in the year 1964 by the Government of Tamil Nadu. Companies like Britannia Industries, TI Cycles of India, Dunlop, and TVS have their plants in Ambattur. Tata Communications has its satellite earth station at the Ambattur–Red Hills road, known as wireless among the locals. Jaya TV, Vijay TV, Asianet and Kairali relay signals from this facility. The Heavy Vehicles Factory (HVF), which manufactures military tanks, is just 5 km from this place, adding to its importance. A railway concrete sleeper manufacturing company is located near the Ambattur railway station. Textile industries such as Ambattur Clothing Limited (ACL) and Bombay Fashions have their facilities here and employ thousands of women. The units in the Industrial Estate generate a combined annual revenue of over 35,000 million.\n\nThe Industrial Estate has a bus terminus. The Ambattur Estate terminus and the maintenance centre with a capacity of 100 buses were opened in 1967. However, , the centre handles 125 buses a day, with a staff count of 1,100.\n\nAmbattur Industrial Estate has attracted a lot of IT companies due to its proximity to residential neighbourhoods and the lower rentals. The lease rentals of IT Parks in Ambattur are half of those in the city. Information Technology (IT) companies such as MilesTs, HCL Technologies, Dell and Tata Consultancy Services have their development centres here. Out of the 22 facilities that HCL Technologies has in Chennai, six are in Ambattur. There are also a few BPO centres such as Perot Systems, Telebuy, Polaris BPO, Serco, First Source & iOPEX Technologies. Prince Info Park, Kochar Technology Park, Ambit IT Park. Chennai Tech Park, a , state-of-the-art, futuristic IT park, on of land is commissioned since 2009 by IndiaLand Park. Now that 10 acres commercial building is bought by Indiabulls Securities Ltd for Rs 600 crores and renamed it as One IndiaBulls Park, current occupiers of the complex include Royal Bank of Scotland, Kone, Britannia Industries, Ajuba, Covenant, Telebuy, Ibox, Bean Balls, Germany's Modisch, Yes Bank and Etisalat. One IndiaBulls park is one of the major IT parks in Ambattur. As a remarkable mile stone, CMA CGM, world's 3rd largest liner started their documentation centre along with Regional eCommerce Team in AMBIT park.\n\nHowever, the demand for commercial space in Ambattur is not as robust as Rajiv Gandhi Salai which is marketed extensively by the government. While IT and ITeS firms in Ambattur have brought in a new image to the industrial belt that has been known for its garment and auto-ancillary units, it has increased the real estate prices.\n\nThe Chennai-Tiruvallur High Road (CTH Road or NH205) passes through Ambattur and the Chennai-Kolkata highway is just about 7 km from the place making it a strategic location. On an average, about 40,000 passenger car units use the CTH Road. The new Chennai Bypass road between Maduravoyal and Madhavaram passes through Ambattur Industrial Estate. It connects NH4 with NH5 and NH205 via Ambattur Industrial Estate.\n\nThe Ambattur bus terminus is located adjacent to the MTH Road and has MTC (city buses) connecting Ambattur with various points in Chennai city. Ambattur does not have a proper bus terminus despite being one of the biggest localities of Chennai. A lot of buses from Avadi and the outskirts of Chennai also pass through Ambattur, offering good connectivity. There are also a few buses operating to Nagercoil, Tirunelveli, Madurai, Vellore and other parts of Tamil Nadu from here. Buses to the famous pilgrim centre of Tirupathi can also be availed from Ambattur.\n\nOn 4 October 2013, the Tamil Nadu Highways department issued a GO extending the entire stretch of the road till Tirutani to 6 lanes at a cost of 1,680 million, by means of land acquisition from 12 villages. In the first phase, the road will be widened to 100 ft (4 lanes) with centre median at a cost of 980 million.\n\nThe Chennai Central-Arakkonam railway line passes through Ambattur and has two railway stations in the neighbourhood. Ambattur railway station serves the residential areas and Pattaravakkam railway station serves the Ambattur Industrial Estate, kallikuppam and Karruku neighbourhood areas. Suburban Broad Gauge EMU trains operate daily from Chennai Central and Chennai Beach to Avadi, Tiruvallur, Patabiram Military Siding, Arakkonam, Vellore, Tirupathi, and Tiruttani via Ambattur. By rail, Ambattur is 30 minutes from Chennai Central, 20 minutes from Perambur and 10 minutes from Villivakkam. Many fast EMU locals (suburban trains) towards Tiruvallur, Arakkonam and Tiruttani, stop at Ambattur railway station, But fast local trains towards Chennai central do not halt at Ambattur because non availability of platform in fast line. By fast local train it takes 25 minutes from Chennai Central. Ambattur having Passenger Reservation Centre Timing 8.00Hrs to14.00Hrs. There is a pending request to extension of Platform length to accommodate express trains, Increase timing of Passenger Reservation Centre, subway, and overbridge at Ambattur\n\n\n\n\nAmbattur also houses the Chennai Zonal Training Center of Life Insurance Corporation of India, located near prithvipakkam.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe residential areas of Ambattur are mainly divided by railway line running east to west. Residential areas round the railways station and south of railway line and about are relatively older residential areas. Residential areas ending with word 'puram' can be considered as older areas of Ambattur town.\n\nResidential areas north of the railway line include Venkatapuram, Vijayalaksmipuram, Vinayagapuram, Kallikuppam, Madhanakuppam (Lakeview Nagar), Ramnagar, Menambedu, Karukku, Prithivipakkam, Gnanamurthy Nagar, DTP Colony (Vijayalaksmipuram), Pudur, Krishnapuram, Thiruvengada Nagar, Nehru Nagar, Sathyapuram, Cholapuram, Oragadam, Venkaeshwara Nagar, Banu Nagar, Lenin Nagar, Abiramipuram and Thirumalai Priya Nagar. Residential areas south of the railway line include Varadharajapuram, Ramapuram, Kamarajapuram, Teachers Colony, Mahakavi Bharathiyar Nagar (MKB Nagar), Sivanandha Nagar, Annai Sathya Nagar, ICF Colony, Old Ambattur areas (near Ambattur Telephone Exachange) such as Ambattur Village Street, Athipet, Managalapuram, Kachana Kuppam, Pattarivakkam, VGN Shanthi Nagar, VGN Cosmopolis, VGN Victoria Park and VGN Brent Park.\n\nThe Branch Library, as it is now called, was opened in May 1971 by the then Minister of Education and Local Administration V. R. Nedunchezhiyan. It was earlier known as Murugappa Library, as the building it is housed in belongs to the A.M.M. Charities Trust. The library is situated near Perunthalaivar Kamarajar Government Girls Higher Secondary School (Girl's High School).\n\nTheatres include Rakki Cinemas (multiplex) and Sri Murugan multiplex near the Ambattur railway station. Kannan Theatre near Senthil Nagar was closed and converted to Dolphin Sports Academy. Parks include Pudur park (Old Pond) near menambedu, Thangal Lake Park near Anjalamaram, Krishnapuram Corporation Park (renovated in October 2009) and the Thiruvengada Nagar Corporation Park (opened on 11 October 2013), Venkatapuram Park at Kubera Vinayagar Temple Ground (opened in 2014), Greater Chennai Corporation Park - VGN Shanthi Nagar, Ambattur. There are many parks in Ambattur which people can use for recreational activities.\n\nThe Ambattur Badminton Association has constructed an indoor stadium ( Kamalam John Samuel Indoor Stadium) name after the Late parents of JCD PRABHAKAR, for playing shuttle badminton, located near the TI Cycles of India factory.\n\nQuite a variety of birds reside and frequent the places in and around Ambattur. Woodland birds, water birds and many more visit here.

{"id": "2187308", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2187308", "title": "DBFS", "text": "DBFS\n\nDecibels relative to full scale (dBFS or dB FS) is a unit of measurement for amplitude levels in digital systems, such as pulse-code modulation (PCM), which have a defined maximum peak level. The unit is similar to the units dBov and decibels relative to overload (dBO).\n\nThe level of 0dBFS is assigned to the maximum possible digital level. For example, a signal that reaches 50% of the maximum level has a level of −6dBFS, which is 6dB below full scale. Conventions differ for root mean square (RMS) measurements, but all peak measurements smaller than the maximum are negative levels.\n\nA digital signal that does not contain any samples at 0dBFS can still clip when converted to analog form due to the signal reconstruction process interpolating between samples. This can be prevented by careful digital-to-analog converter circuit design. Measurements of the true inter-sample peak levels are notated as dBTP or dB TP (\"decibels true peak\").\n\nSince a peak measurement is not useful for qualifying the noise performance of a system, or measuring the loudness of an audio recording, for instance, RMS measurements are often used instead.\n\nA potential for ambiguity exists when assigning a level on the dBFS scale to a waveform rather than to a specific amplitude, because some engineers follow the mathematical definition of RMS, which is −3dB below the peak value, while others choose the reference level so that RMS and peak measurements of a sine wave produce the same result.\n\nThe unit dB FS or dBFS is defined in AES Standard AES17-1998, IEC 61606, and ITU-T P.38x, such that the RMS value of a full-scale sine wave is designated 0dB FS. This means a full-scale square wave would have an RMS value of +3dB FS. This convention is used in Wolfson and Cirrus Logic digital microphone specs, etc.\n\nThe unit dBov is defined in the ITU-T G.100.1 telephony standard such that the RMS value of a full-scale square wave is designated 0dBov. All possible dBov measurements are negative numbers, and a sine wave cannot exist at a larger RMS value than −3 dBov without clipping. This unit can be applied to both analog and digital systems. This convention is the basis for the ITU's LUFS loudness unit, and is also used in Sound Forge and Euphonix meters, and Analog Devices digital microphone specs (though referred to as \"dBFS\").\n\nThe measured dynamic range of a digital system is the ratio of the full scale signal level to the RMS noise floor. The theoretical minimum noise floor is caused by quantization noise. This is usually modeled as a uniform random fluctuation between − LSB and + LSB. (Only certain signals produce uniform random fluctuations, so this model is typically, but not always, accurate.)\n\nAs the dynamic range is measured relative to the RMS level of a full scale sine wave, the dynamic range and the level of this quantization noise in dBFS can both be estimated with the same formula (though with reversed sign):\n\nThe value of \"n\" equals the resolution of the system in bits or the resolution of the system minus 1bit (the measure error). For example, a 16-bit system has a theoretical minimum noise floor of −98.09dBFS relative to a full-scale sine wave:\n\nIn any real converter, dither is added to the signal before sampling. This removes the effects of non-uniform quantization error, but increases the minimum noise floor.\n\nThe phrase \"dB below full scale\" has appeared in print since the 1950s, and the term \"dBFS\" has been used since 1977.\n\nAlthough the decibel (dB) is permitted for use alongside units of the International System of Units (SI), the dBFS is not.\n\ndBFS is not defined for analog levels, according to standard AES-6id-2006. No single standard converts between digital and analog levels, mostly due to the differing capabilities of different equipment. The amount of oversampling also affects the conversion with values that are too low having significant error. The conversion level is chosen as the best compromise for the typical headroom and signal-to-noise levels of the equipment in question. Examples:\n\n\n\n"}

Todd is the younger brother of former racers Geoffrey and Brett Bodine. Bodine is known for his bald head, which has given him the nickname The Onion.\n\nBodine would make his Busch Series debut in 1986, for Pistone Racing at Martinsville. He qualified and finished 27th in the 30-car field, falling out of the race early with an engine problem.\n\nBodine went on a three-year hiatus from the series until 1990, when he would drive eight races for the Highline Racing #42/#81 Ames-sponsored Pontiac, making his season debut at Martinsville. He started 11th and finished in the eighth position. He then followed that up with finishes of seventh at Orange County and third at Dover Downs.\n\nIn 1991, he signed to drive for Frank Cicci. In his first full season in the series, he won his first career race, one of 15 Top 10s in 1991. Bodine also won his first two poles: Back to back at Dublin and South Boston. He ended the year seventh in points.\n\nBodine's career in Cup started at Watkins Glen International Raceway on August 9, 1992 when he was 28 years old. He raced the No. 34 Ford Thunderbird for Cicci-Welliver Racing, finishing 37th. His first full-time season came in 1994 when he raced for Butch Mock Motorsports. He raced the No. 75 Ford Thunderbird sponsored by Factory Stores. He missed one race the whole season and scored two Top 5s and seven Top 10s on his way to a 20th-place position in the points standings. He was unable to match those statistics in 1995 as he finished 33rd in the points with only one Top 5 and three Top 10s. Following his release from Butch Mock, Bodine spent 1996, filling in for Bill Elliott in a four-race span, finishing 10th at Pocono. He also drove three races apiece for David Blair Motorsports and Andy Petree Racing. In 1997, he filled in for Ricky Craven at Hendrick Motorsports at Texas and for his brother Geoff at Charlotte Motor Speedway, before he won the pole at Watkins Glen for Cicci-Welliver in a one-race deal. He finished 35th due to engine problems in that race. Todd started races for five different teams in 1997. At Loudon, he relieved Jeff Burton, who had an inner ear problem and exited his Roush Racing car after 68 laps.\n\nFor 1998, he signed with a new team called ISM Racing. The team struggled and he was temporarily replaced by Loy Allen, Jr. for the Pepsi 400 in July, then after the race was delayed to October was fired by the team before the next race at New Hampshire International Speedway. He went back to Cicci-Welliver in the Busch Series, replacing rookie Mike Cope in the No. 30 Slim Jim-sponsored car. He finished 33rd in points despite running 13 races, and posted a string of five consecutive Top 5 finishes. He also ran part-time in cup for LJ Racing, posting a fifth at Atlanta.\n\nIn 1999, his Cicci-Welliver team switched to No. 66, and he posted ten Top 5’s en route a fourth-place points finish. In addition, he ran seven races for Eel River Racing at the Cup level, his best finish being 15th at Bristol. In 2000, he won a pole at Talladega as well as the race at Michigan.\n\nHe would get back into Cup racing full-time in 2001 while racing the No. 66 K-Mart-sponsored Ford Taurus which was owned by Haas-Carter Motorsports. Despite getting three poles, he only scored two Top 5s, missed the Daytona 500, and was plagued with 12 DNFs, causing him to finish 29th in points. He also won the exhibition No-Bull Sprint, which put him into the Winston at Lowe's Motor Speedway. He also ran half the schedule in the Busch Series, winning two of the first three races of the season with Buckshot Racing, before ending the season driving for Fitz Motorsports. He started 2002 with the 66, but lost his ride after Kmart filed for bankruptcy. He signed on to Herzog Motorsports and won the Kroger 300, finishing 23rd in points. During the season, he rejoined Haas-Carter when Discover Card became the team's primary sponsor. He garnered a fifth-place run at Richmond, and finished 38th in points.\nIn 2003, Carter partnered with Sam Belnavis to field the No. 54 United States National Guard-sponsored Ford for Bodine. Bodine's best finish that year was an eighth at Pocono and he finished 31st in standings. After that year, Belnavis abandoned the operation and took sponsors National Guard and Subway to Roush Racing and the Carter team closed its doors due to the lack of a sponsorship. Bodine also got a win at Darlington in the Busch Series for Herzog and led the Busch Series points standings but again a lack of sponsorship forced his team to close. He ended the season at Innovative Motorsports. He split 2004 between Mach 1 Racing, Arnold Motorsports, and R&J Racing, his best finish a 23rd at Bristol. He ran five Busch races for GIC-Mixon Motorsports and Marsh Racing, finishing fifth at Homestead.\n\nBodine made his Craftsman Truck Series debut in 1995 driving for Roush Racing's No. 61 Ford for 5 races. In his debut, Bodine qualified 3rd on the road course at Heartland Park Topeka, and finished fourth. His worst finish was at Mesa Marin Raceway, where he finished eighth an 8th place, earned his best start of 2nd and led his first career lap.\n\nBodine did not run the Trucks again until 2004, when he competed for Fiddleback Racing at Charlotte, finishing 20th and also ran for HT Motorsports's No. 59 Dodge at Kansas with a 15th. Later, he signed with the new Germain-Arnold Racing team, finishing 4th in their debut at Richmond. After losing in Vegas to Shane Hmiel, Bodine won his first two career races back-to-back at Fontana and Texas. Competing in ten events, Bodine averaged a 13th-place finish in his events, despite falling out of three with mechanical issues. Unfortunately, neither Bodine nor crew chief Mike Hillman Jr. were happy with contract issues and the team leadership. So Bodine parted ways with the team and went back to Fiddleback Racing, where he would drive in 2005. Bodine was able to earn four top-10s with the team in ten starts, but inconsistency was weighing him down to 8th place in points. Fiddleback also had no funding and after a 9th place at Michigan the team was disbanded.\n\nGermain-Arnold signed to have him come back. He won in his second race with the team at Kansas and rolled to four more victories, including three straight at the end of the season. By winning the final three races of the season, he made a serious run for the title. With four races remaining in the season Todd was fourth in the standings, a dismal 256 points behind leader Ted Musgrave. With Bodine's three wins, he was able to gain one spot to third and an entire 183 points on Musgrave to finish only 73 points behind.\n\nIn 2006, Bodine was once again behind the wheel of the No. 30 Lumber Liquidators Toyota. Bodine won at Atlanta, Gateway, and Texas. Bodine won the 2006 Craftsman Truck Series championship on November 17, 2006 by 122 points over Johnny Benson; it was Bodine's first-ever championship in any division. Starting in 2009 Lumber Liquidators left the No. 30 truck, while Copart came along to become the sponsor for the season, while still driving for Germain Racing.\n\nOn November 13, 2010, Bodine won his 2nd Camping World Truck Series title.\n\nFor 2011, Bodine struggled with consistency, as he suffered bad luck in most of the first 10 races. Sponsorship was also a constant issue for the No. 30 team, and they managed to run 10 races with limited sponsorship. However, after Kentucky, Germain was unable to send the 30 team to Iowa without a sponsor. The week before the race at Iowa, Germain partnered with Randy Moss Motorsports to put Bodine in their 5 truck for the rest of 2011. Bodine went winless in 2011, and subsequently left Germain when the team decided to put its focus on the Sprint Cup Series.\n\nIn 2012, Bodine was picked up by Red Horse Racing to run a full schedule. Bodine would run subsequent races with ToyotaCare sponsorship, and won the sixth race of the season, at Dover International Speedway, in a rain-shortened event.\n\nBodine started the 2013 season driving for ThorSport Racing at Daytona International Speedway, finishing 11th. He followed it up with another 11th in the following race at Martinsville Speedway and ran the next six races for ThorSport before departing from the team following the race at Texas Motor Speedway. Four weeks later, he made what would be his final career start in the Camping World Truck Series at Pocono, driving the #30 truck for Turner Scott Motorsports. He finished 11th.\n\nBodine ran a total of eight Nationwide Series races from 2014 to 2017 for SS-Green Light Racing and DGM Racing, his best finish being a 19th at Watkins Glen International in 2015. He ran his final race at Charlotte Motor Speedway in 2017 and finished 30th. He has since retired.\n\nBodine currently works on Fox Sports 1 as a color analyst for select Camping World Truck Series races when Michael Waltrip is unavailable.\n\n Season still in progress<br>\n\n"}

So, they decided to bring back former WCW president Eric Bischoff and former head of creativity Vince Russo, putting them together to run WCW with the thought that they could keep each other's failures in check.\n\nOn-screen, Bischoff and Russo took over and declared all WCW championships vacant on April 10, 2000. They also declared a new stable with both of them at the helm called The New Blood. It consisted of most of the younger, up-and-coming wrestlers in WCW along with longtime talent that had never been pushed for years. Their main enemies became known as the Millionaire's Club, the older veteran stars of the company whom they claimed held back the younger talent. The idea was to get the younger talent over and generate more interest among the younger fans that watched the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) instead of WCW, although it later evolved into an nWo rehash. Many argue that a primary reason the WWF defeated WCW in the Monday Night Wars is because they greatly put over new talent rather than relying so heavily on long-established veterans. As such, this was seen as an overly extreme and late attempt at that strategy.\n\nOn April 16, 2000, at Spring Stampede in Chicago, Illinois, all of the titles were filled with matches between the New Blood and the Millionaire's Club. The feuds continued for another month or so before both factions disbanded due to WCW management deciding the angle was not working due to it backfiring, as the Millionaire's Club got most of the positive fan reaction.\n\nThe true end of the angle occurred on July 9, after the infamous Vince Russo's worked shoot promo, which caused Hogan and Bischoff to leave the promotion.\n\n\n\n"}

Craven is perhaps most well known for winning the 2003 Carolina Dodge Dealers 400, beating Kurt Busch in the closest finish in Cup Series history.\n\nCraven graduated from Hampden Academy in Hampden, Maine.\n\nCraven began racing at the age of 15 at Unity Raceway, winning twice as well as the Rookie of the Year award. The next year, he won 12 feature events and the track championship. In 1984 Craven raced at Wiscasset Speedway in the Late Model Division; in this year he won the track championship along with the Rookie of the Year title. After that, he began running in the American Canadian Tour, where he had rampant success. In 1986, he made his NASCAR debut at Oxford Plains Speedway in his own No. 12, finishing 25th after suffering engine failure. Four years later, he began running the Busch North Series, winning the Rookie of the Year award. In 1991, he was named the champion in that series, winning ten times in the No. 25 Chevrolet, with two of those ten wins in \"combination\" races with the Busch Grand National Series, including the prestigious Oxford 250. In addition, he made his Winston Cup debut at Rockingham, starting and finishing 34th for Dick Moroso. He moved to the Busch Series full-time in 1992 in the No. 99 Chevy for Bill Papke, and once again was named Rookie of the Year. In 1993 and 1994, he finished runner-up to Steve Grissom and David Green, respectively, in the championship standings. On October 9, 1994, Craven would serve as a pit reporter for TBS's broadcast of that year's Mello Yello 500, serving as a precursor to his broadcasting career.\n\nIn 1995, Craven teamed up with Larry Hedrick Motorsports and Kodiak to run for Winston Cup Rookie of the Year. Craven qualified for all 31 races, finished in the Top 10 four times, and was able to defeat Robert Pressley for the top rookie award. For his efforts, he was rewarded with a partial ownership share in the team. He began 1996 with three consecutive Top 10 finishes and his first career pole. He was fourth in points before the Winston Select 500, during which he was involved in a multi-car wreck. On lap 130, his car was launched into the air and impacted with the catch fence above the wall before being thrown back onto the track and hit by another car. This crash was similar to Jimmy Horton's barrel roll in 1993 where he cleared the track. Craven's flip completely sheared the catchfence off the turn and NASCAR threw a lengthy red flag to make repairs. He walked away, but fell to twentieth in points and only had one Top 5 finish and one pole for the rest of the season\n\nAt the end of the year, Craven left Hedrick to drive the No. 25 Chevy for Hendrick Motorsports. Craven finished in the Top 5 in the first two races of the season. He finished third in the 1997 Daytona 500 behind his teammates Terry Labonte in second and Jeff Gordon in first giving Hendrick Motorsports a 1-2-3 sweep of the Daytona 500. While practicing for the inaugural Interstate Batteries 500, Craven crashed hard into the wall. He missed two races due to a concussion suffered from the wreck. Upon his return, he won the Winston Open and finished a then-career-best 19th in points and a total of $1,139,860 in winnings for 1997. After the 1998 season started, the side effects of the concussion began to appear, and Craven was diagnosed with post-concussion syndrome, and was forced to miss several races until he recovered. He returned at his home track at New Hampshire International Speedway later that year won the pole. After four races, he was released permanently from Hendrick, and did not return until the final three races of the season, filling in for Ernie Irvan at MB2 Motorsports.\n\nFor 1999, Craven signed to drive the No. 58 Ford Taurus for Scott Barbour's SBIII Motorsports, a brand new team in NASCAR. He did not finish any better than 19th while driving the car and after he failed to qualify for the Coca-Cola 600, he was replaced by Loy Allen, Jr.. Several weeks later, he signed up with another new team Midwest Transit Racing, replacing rookie Dan Pardus in the No. 50 and finished the season with them. Craven returned to the team in 2000 but after failing to qualify for four of the first nine races of the season, the team switched to a part-time schedule. Following this decision, Craven had four Top 20 finishes but finished 44th in points.\n\nIn January the next year, it was announced that Craven would replace Scott Pruett in PPI Motorsports's No. 32 Ford. He won the pole in the summer race at Michigan International Speedway and in the Old Dominion 500 at Martinsville Speedway, he held off Dale Jarrett in the closing laps for his first career Winston Cup win. In 2002, he won two poles, scored nine Top 10 finishes, and finished a career-best 15th in points. In 2003, his team switched from Ford to Pontiac, providing the No. 32 car with a factory-backed engine program. In the Carolina Dodge Dealers 400 at Darlington Raceway, he battled Kurt Busch for the win, defeating him by .002 seconds in what was voted in December 2009 as the \"Finish of the 2000s\" in the Sprint Cup Series. In that race, he became the last-ever person to win in a Pontiac. Craven failed to win races again that season and dropped 12 spots in the points standings. After he did not post a single Top 10 finish three-quarters of the way through 2004, he was replaced by Bobby Hamilton, Jr., and only returned to run at New Hampshire Motor Speedway, his home track. His last Cup start was the 2004 EA Sports 500 at Talladega, where he drove in a development car for Joe Gibbs Racing, the No. 11 Chevrolet.\n\nIn 2005, Craven moved to the Craftsman Truck Series to drive the No. 99 Ford for Roush Racing. Craven was second in points after 9 races, and there was talk about him being promoted to Mark Martin's No. 6 Nextel Cup ride for 2006. However, a brutal stretch of finishes led to a free fall in the point standings, and it was announced that he would be gone from Roush at the end of the year. Craven did win at Martinsville Speedway late in the year, and finished fourteenth in points.\n\nHis final NASCAR start came at the Goody's 250 at Martinsville in the Busch Series for FitzBradshaw Racing in 2006. He finished 39th after the brakes failed on his No. 14 Dodge.\n\nCraven spent the next few years looking for a part-time ride, but he was unsuccessful. He eventually retired and worked for ESPN and Yahoo! Sports as a NASCAR analyst. In January 2019, he departed ESPN after 11 years with the network to work for Fox.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2187333", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2187333", "title": "Ted Musgrave", "text": "Ted Musgrave\n\nTheodore Musgrave (born December 18, 1955) is an American former stock car racing driver.\n\nMusgrave's father, Elmer, was a famous short-track racer in the Midwest who raced for over 25 years at Soldier Field, O'Hare, Waukegan, and Wilmot, Wisconsin before moving into asphalt late models in the American Speed Association (ASA) and ARCA. \"I was really young at the time,\" Musgrave said. \"But I can still remember sitting in the infield at Milwaukee and watching him race against drivers like Paul Goldsmith. He finally retired so he could help my older brother, Tom, and I get started.\" He began racing in 1977 at age 22 at Waukegan in a 1967 Ford Galaxy that he inherited from his brother. He immediately rebuilt the car into a 1967 Ford Torino and won the track's rookie of the year award.. He and his father built a Ford Mustang using some tips from Dick Trickle to race the next season.\n\nBy 1979 he was a regular driver on the Central Wisconsin (CWRA) circuit, finishing seventh in the season points. Originally from Illinois, Musgrave moved across the nearby state line so that he could race five nights per week in the CWRA. He raced at LaCrosse, State Park Speedway in Wausau, Grundy County Speedway, Wisconsin Dells Speedway (now Dells Raceway Park), and Waukegan. In 1980, he finished second in the points at Wisconsin International Raceway (WIR) behind Alan Kulwicki. Musgrave's highlight of the 1982 season was winning the Holiday 50 at Capital Speedway (now Madison International Speedway). Musgrave qualified the fastest five times in a row at WIR and was leading the points when he battered his wrist in a wreck. He returned the following week in a cast with a special arm support in the car. He finished third in points. Musgrave won ten CWRA features in 1983, including the Holiday 50 at Capital Super Speedway, the Triple Hot Dog Dash at Wisconsin Dells, and the Race of Champions at Capital's Oktober Nationals. Musgrave won seven features at Capital in 1984, along with two features at LaCrosse, two at State Park, and two at Wisconsin Dells. He ran out of money to fund his team in 1985, and he ended his season early. Musgrave returned in 1986 with a new car which contained several of his experimental ideas. He finished tenth in CWRA points even though he started the season over a month late. He had numerous feature wins that season, including the Firecracker 100 at Capital.\n\nIn 1987 he moved to Franklin, Wisconsin and went national in the ASA series in Terry Baker's ride that Bobby Dotter vacated. Musgrave finished 21 of 25 events, winning at the Milwaukee Mile, Birmingham, and Huntsville. He earned rookie of the year honors by finishing fifth in points.\n\nIn 1990, Musgrave was called upon by Winston Cup team owner Ray DeWitt to replace Rich Vogler, who had been killed at a wreck at Salem Speedway. Musgrave had four starts in the Cup Series that year, his best finish being a 22nd at the Checker Auto Parts 500. From 1991 to 1993, he raced the No. 55 for the DeWitt/Ulrich team. He was runner-up to Bobby Hamilton for rookie of the year in 1991 and had twelve Top 10 finishes.\n\nIn 1992, driving for Dewitt/Ulrich, he led all Winston Cup drivers in laps completed. In 1994, he was hired by Jack Roush to race for Roush Racing in the No. 16 Family Channel-sponsored Ford Thunderbird as a teammate to Mark Martin. In his first season, Musgrave had three poles and finished 15th in points. In 1995, Musgrave had a breakout year of sorts, posting seven Top 5 finishes (including two second-place finishes) and 13 Top 10’s. At one point in the season, he was third in Winston Cup points. He slumped late in the season and finished seventh, but most felt his first race win was just around the corner. The 1996 season turned out to be a disappointment for Musgrave. He usually ran well in most races, but could never find what he needed to get his first win. He had several Top 10’s early in the season, but once again slumped in the second half and wound up 17th in points. He did, however, win the pole for the final Winston Cup race ever held at North Wilkesboro Speedway.\nIn 1997, Roush vowed to give Musgrave whatever he needed to win his first race. The No. 16 car now had dual sponsorships from the Family Channel and Primestar. Once again, he started off well, and came very close to his first win, at Darlington Raceway. Musgrave was running second late in the race and clearly had a faster car than leader Dale Jarrett in the closing laps. At one point, he was side by side with Jarrett, but Jarrett held him off for the win. Critics of Musgrave said after the race that he should have been more aggressive and bumped Jarrett out of the way to get his first win. Later in the season at Pocono Raceway, Musgrave had a strong car and was running second late in the race with a chance to win when his car went unexpectedly loose. He ended up fourth. Musgrave was in the Top 10 in points for most of 1997, but a poor final race, at Atlanta, caused him to fall to 12th for the year.\n\nIn 1998, Musgrave got full sponsorship from Primestar, and was 18th in points when he was suddenly replaced by rookie Kevin Lepage, to the shock of many. Still, Musgrave filled out 1998 by running part-time for Bud Moore Engineering and Bill Elliott Racing, as well as doing substitute duty for Travis Carter and Jasper Motorsports. He ended up missing only one race that year and gave Elliott's team its only Top 10 finish with a fifth-place run at Phoenix.\n\nIn 1999, Musgrave was signed by Butch Mock Motorsports to run the No. 75 Remington Arms-sponsored Ford. Musgrave struggled however, and only put together two Top 10 finishes before finally quitting the team after the Pennzoil 400. He began 2000 without a ride, but soon caught on with Joe Bessey Motorsports filling in for the injured Geoffrey Bodine, and ran five races with that team. After a one-race return to the No. 15, Musgrave finished the year with Team SABCO, driving the No. 01 for Kenny Irwin Jr., who was killed in an accident at New Hampshire International Speedway while practicing for the race. Musgrave has run seven Cup races since then, six of them with Ultra Motorsports and one for Petty Enterprises, Musgrave's last Cup race came at the 20-caution Sharpie 500 at Bristol in 2003, when he replaced Jimmy Spencer while he served his one race suspension.\n\nMusgrave made his Busch Series debut in 1989 in the All Pro 300 at Charlotte Motor Speedway, driving the No. 98 Buick. He started 31st and wound up in 12th place. He also ran at North Carolina Speedway the next week, finishing 17th. He did not return to the series until 1995, when he was 14th at Charlotte in the No. 9 Ford for Roush Racing. In 1997, Musgrave finished 12th at Darlington Raceway in the No. 40 Ford for Doug Taylor. He also returned for another race in the No. 9 Roush Ford, finishing 36th at Talladega. Musgrave attempted four races in 1999, but only qualified for one, finishing 17th at Rockingham in the No. 29 Pep Boys-sponsored Chevrolet for Gary Bechtel.\n\nFor 2000, Musgrave signed with Team SABCO to run nine races in the No. 82 Channellock-sponsored Chevrolet. He earned three Top 20 finishes, including his first Top 10, an eighth at Charlotte Motor Speedway. Musgrave did not return to the series until 2003, when he signed a one-race deal with Tommy Baldwin Racing in the No. 6 Dodge. In the Food City 250 at Bristol, he started ninth and finished third, earning a career-best finish for both him and the race team. Musgrave also ran one race in 2004, the Emerson Radio 250 at Richmond International Raceway. Driving the No. 86 Dodge, he started 11th but finished 34th after overheating problems.\n\nIn 2006, Musgrave was one of many to drive the No. 12 and No. 14 Dodges for FitzBradshaw Racing. In five races, he was able to earn a best finish of 21st at Richmond. His final series race to date was that year's O'Reilly Challenge at Texas Motor Speedway, finishing 34th in the No. 14 Family Dollar-sponsored Dodge.\n\nMusgrave made his Craftsman Truck Series debut in 1995 at the GM Goodwrench/Delco Battery 200, driving the No. 61 Ford F-150 for Jack Roush. He started and finished in fourth place. He ran two more races the next year in Roush's No. 99 truck, and finished fifth at Phoenix. He did not run trucks again until 2001, when he signed to drive the No. 1 Mopar-sponsored Dodge Ram for Ultra Motorsports. He won three of out the first five races that year and seven races overall, and had eighteen top-ten finishes, but was unable to catch Jack Sprague for the title. The next two seasons, he had three wins apiece and finished third in both seasons' points. During the 2003 season, Musgrave announced that he had been battling bladder cancer while racing. His wife Debi had been diagnosed with leukemia since 2000. Musgrave appeared to be in position to win the truck championship that year, but in the season-ending Ford 200, Musgrave was penalized for attempting to pass a slower truck low on the final restart past the start-finish line, and surrendered the championship to fellow Wisconsinite Travis Kvapil. \"All I can say is next year you're going to see a whole new Ted Musgrave. He's going to be the dirtiest son of a gun going out there on the racetrack and you might as well throw that rulebook away. I ain't going by it no more\", Musgrave said in reaction to the penalty.\n\nIn 2004, Musgrave did not race dirty as promised, but still raced competitively, winning two races and finishing third in points for the third consecutive year, behind Bobby Hamilton and Dennis Setzer.\n\nIn 2005, Musgrave won just one race, winning from the pole position at Gateway International Raceway as he did also in 2001, but he was able to claim the Craftsman Truck Series title. Musgrave moved on to Germain Racing's No. 9 Toyota for 2006 with sponsorship from Team ASE after Ultra Motorsports closed the doors following the 2005 season. Musgrave finished sixth in points in 2006, but failed to win a race that season.\n\nIn 2006, he was chosen to drive in the International Race Of Champions for the first time. He was the only driver representing the Craftsman Truck Series for the 2006 season. In 2007, Musgrave was parked for one race after hitting Kelly Bires out of anger under a caution at the Milwaukee Mile. He was parked, fined, and docked points, ending any legitimate shot he had to make a run at the championship. Brad Keselowski was named the replacement driver at Memphis Motorsports Park. That marked the first time in Craftsman Truck Series history that a driver had been suspended from a race. Later that season, Musgrave got his first career win for Germain Racing at Texas Motor Speedway, breaking a 66-race winless streak. Despite the one-race suspension, Musgrave finished seventh in the series points, marking seven consecutive top-10 points finishes in the Craftsman Truck Series.\n\nAfter the conclusion of the 2007 season, Germain Racing announced that they would not renew Musgrave's contract for 2008 season. Musgrave was replaced in the No. 9 by rookie Justin Marks. He moved to HT Motorsports for 2008, bringing his ASE sponsorship with him to the No. 59 truck. Eighteen races into the 2008 season, Musgrave and HT parted ways after a practice wreck at Las Vegas Motor Speedway. He was 13th in points at the time of his release.\n\nIn 2010, Musgrave was entered in the season-opening NextEra Energy Resources 250 at Daytona. Driving the No. 15 Hope for Haiti-sponsored Toyota for Billy Ballew Motorsports, he started 18th but finished 31st after getting caught in an early multi-car wreck.\n\nMusgrave served as Ron Hornaday Jr.'s spotter for eight races during the 2012 Camping World Truck Series season. A March 2012 press release stated that Musgrave had retired from driving.\n\nMusgrave married the former Deborah Pantle. They met while traveling back and forth from Waukegan on Sunday nights. \"She was a friend of a friend of my father who needed a ride back to Illinois on Sunday nights,\" he said. After they married, she trained and showed horses while he raced. They have two sons, Justin and Ted, Jr., and a daughter, Brittany. Justin raced light trucks, and Ted, Jr. raced on the ASA tour.\n"}
{"id": "2187342", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2187342", "title": "Bert Lance", "text": "Bert Lance\n\nThomas Bertram \"Bert\" Lance (June 3, 1931 – August 15, 2013) was an American businessman who served as director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Jimmy Carter in 1977. He is known mainly for resigning from the Carter administration because of a scandal during his first year in office. However, he was later cleared of all charges.\n\nLance was born in Gainesville, Georgia. His father, Thomas Jackson Lance, had served as president of Young Harris College, in northeastern Georgia, and in 1941, the family relocated to Calhoun, Gordon County, when Lance's father became superintendent of Calhoun schools. \n\nAfter graduating from Calhoun High School in 1948, Lance attended Emory University for two years before he transferred to the University of Georgia. In 1950, he married LaBelle David, whose family owned the Calhoun First National Bank; they had four sons. Under pressure to support his wife and their first son, Lance dropped out of the University of Georgia, where he had been a member of Sigma Chi, before graduating.\n\nHe became a teller at the bank and, within a decade ascended to its presidency after he had acquired a controlling stake with a consortium of investors in 1958. Meanwhile, he completed American Bankers Association-accredited executive education programs at Louisiana State University's School of Banking of the South (1952–1954) and the Stonier School of Banking at Rutgers University (1961–1963). He later served as president of the National Bank of Georgia in Atlanta from 1975 to 1977.\n\nLance became acquainted with Jimmy Carter during the latter's time as Governor of Georgia and served as State Highway Director during his administration. Lance ran to succeed Carter in 1974 but lost a bid for the Democratic nomination, finishing third in the first primary behind Lester Maddox and the eventual winner, George Busbee. During the campaign, Lance accrued campaign debts of nearly $600,000.\nLance was an adviser to Carter during his successful 1976 presidential campaign. After Carter's victory over President Gerald Ford, Lance was named Director of the Office of Management and the Budget (OMB). According to former OMB officials, it was well known in the department that Bert Lance and President Carter prayed together every morning.\n\nWithin six months, questions were raised by the press and Congress about mismanagement and corruption when Lance was chairman of the board of Calhoun First National Bank of Georgia. William Safire's article written during this time, \"Carter's Broken Lance\", earned a Pulitzer Prize in 1978.\n\nIt was an embarrassment for Carter's administration, particularly as it took place soon after President Nixon's Watergate scandal and President Ford's pardon of Nixon just before he could be tried for any crimes. To ensure there was no hint of similar impropriety in the Carter administration, Lance resigned his position. Later, after a well-publicized trial in 1980, a jury acquitted Lance on nine charges, and did not decide two others.\n\nIn 1981, Lance returned to the Calhoun First National Bank as chairman; he left in 1986. He then made something of a political comeback in 1982 when he was elected Chairman of the Georgia Democratic Party. In 1984, Walter Mondale – who was the Democratic candidate for U.S. President at the time – sought to name Lance chairman of the Democratic National Committee, but was forced to withdraw his name after opposition from Democratic party members. Lance's appointment as general manager of the 1984 campaign lasted only a few weeks.\nLance was an advisor to Jesse Jackson during Jackson's 1988 presidential campaign.\n\nLance is credited with popularizing the phrase \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\", which he was quoted as saying in the May 1977 issue of the magazine \"Nation's Business\". The expression became widespread, and William Safire wrote that it \"has become a source of inspiration to anti-activists.\"\n\nLance was implicated in the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) scandal of the 1980s and early 1990s. He was involved in deals with notable BCCI luminaries Agha Hasan Abedi, Mochtar Riady, and Ghaith Pharaon and with BCCI's largest borrower, Ponnapula Sanjeeva Prasad, and joined with Arkansas-based power investor Jackson Stephens in facilitating BCCI's takeover of Financial General Bankshares. Lance and Stephens made millions in the wake of BCCI's collapse. During Carter's run for office, Lance had helped him secure funding by using stored peanuts at Carter's peanut business. It was alleged that there were no peanuts in the storage facilities.\n\nIn January 1978, Lance sold his stock in National Bank of Georgia to Pharaon, and on the same day, BCCI founder Abedi paid off Lance's $3.5 million loan at the First National Bank of Chicago. Meanwhile, the Chicago bank was making huge loans to the Soviet Union with open lines of credit. The next month, Lance helped BCCI's hostile bid for Financial General Bankshares of Washington. The attempt failed, but three years later, BCCI secretly acquired the bank and renamed it First American Bankshares by using 15 Arab investors as nominees. The next year, Lance introduced Carter to Abedi. In 1987, First American Bankshares acquired National Bank of Georgia from Pharaon. BCCI was terminated in 1991, and it was subsequently revealed that the bank had engaged in many illegal activities, including secretly controlling several US banks, in violation of federal banking statutes.\n\nOn \"Saturday Night Live\", September 24, 1977, the day Lance resigned from the Carter administration, John Belushi (playing Lance) and Dan Aykroyd (playing Carter) appeared in an advertising parody of an American Express credit card commercial.\n\nIn a Season 5 episode of \"Good Times\" (1977), JJ references Bert Lance while offering to make out a check for the family budget, knowing they have no money.\n\nIn \"Making Out\", a 1979 episode of the sitcom \"What's Happening!\", Rerun (played by Fred Berry) confuses Bert Lance with Cyrus Vance while trying to impress a date who is a political science major.\n\nA stretch of Interstate 75 in Georgia has been named for Lance.\n\nLance died on August 15, 2013, at his home in northwest Georgia at age 82. He had been in hospice care due to recent declining health, caused by aging.\n"}

{"id": "2187357", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2187357", "title": "Brad Keselowski", "text": "Brad Keselowski\n\nBradley Aaron Keselowski (; born February 12, 1984) is an American professional stock car racing driver. He currently competes full-time in the NASCAR Cup Series, driving the No. 2 Ford Mustang for Team Penske, and part-time in the NASCAR Xfinity Series, driving the No. 12 Mustang for Team Penske. He was the owner of Brad Keselowski Racing, which fielded two full-time teams in the NASCAR Gander Outdoors Truck Series.\n\nKeselowski, who began his NASCAR career in 2004, is the second of only four drivers that have won a championship in both the Cup Series and the Xfinity Series, and the twenty-fifth driver to win a race in each of NASCAR's three national series.\n\nKeselowski is also the owner and founder of Keselowski Advanced Manufacturing, a hybrid manufacturing company based in Statesville, North Carolina, specializing in additive metal technologies as well as CNC machining.\n\nKeselowski was born in Rochester Hills, Michigan, and grew up in a racing family. He is the fifth child of Kay and Bob Keselowski and the nephew of Ron Keselowski. His older brother, Brian, is also an active racing driver. The Keselowski family is of Polish descent.\n\nKeselowski spent much of his adolescence working at his father's race shop; he swept and mopped the floors, and mowed the grass. In 2000, Keselowski began racing stock cars in the Factory Stock division.\n\nIn 2004, at only 20 years old Keselowski began his NASCAR career as the driver of the No. 29 Ford F-150 for the family-owned K-Automotive Motorsports in the Craftsman Truck Series. He made his debut in the Kroger 250 at Martinsville, where he started twenty-sixth and finished thirty-third. He made seven more starts that season, with his best finish coming in the UAW/GM Ohio 250 at Mansfield, where he finished 16th.\n\nKeselowski began competing in the Truck Series full-time in 2005 with backing from SUBcrews.com and Samson Stone. He opened the season with a seventh-place finish in the Florida Dodge Dealers 250 at Daytona, his only top ten finish of the year. He would end up finishing twenty-first in points. He ran the first two races of 2006 for K-Automotive before a lack of sponsorship caused the team to temporarily suspend operations. Keselowski then drove the No. 02 Chevrolet at Kentucky and Memphis, filling in for an injured Kelly Sutton, and drove the No. 63 Ford for MB Motorsports at Bristol and in the season finale, the Ford 200 at Homestead.\n\nKeselowski began competing in the Busch Series full-time in 2007. He drove the No. 23 Chevrolet Monte Carlo SS for Keith Coleman Racing until the team suspended operations in July. Earlier in June, during the 2007 Truck Series season, Keselowski was tabbed by Germain Racing to replace Ted Musgrave in the No. 9 Team ASE Toyota Tundra for the O'Reilly 200 at Memphis after Musgrave was suspended for an in-race scuffle with another driver at the Milwaukee Mile. Keselowski won his first career pole for the race, and led sixty-two laps, but got turned around by Travis Kvapil as they fought for the lead with ten laps to go. Keselowski wound up finishing 16th. Shortly afterward, Keselowski was called by car owner Dale Earnhardt Jr. to drive the No. 88 United States Navy-sponsored Chevrolet for JR Motorsports for three races, and eventually the rest of the Busch Series season. During the Camping World 300 at California Speedway, Keselowski was involved in an accident involving A. J. Allmendinger and J. J. Yeley. Keselowski was able to climb out of his damaged car but complained of foot pain. He would later be treated and released from Loma Linda University Medical Center and was cleared to race at Richmond the following weekend. Keselowski would close the 2007 season out with five top ten finishes and a twenty-fifth-place finish in points.\nIn 2008 Keselowski re-signed with JR Motorsports for the 2008 Nationwide Series season, and earned his first career victory in the Federated Auto Parts 300 at Nashville Superspeedway, holding off Clint Bowyer. Keselowski would hold off Bowyer again for his second career win in the Food City 250 at Bristol Motor Speedway. He ended the season third in points, the highest finish by a full-time Nationwide Series-only driver. Keselowski also got his first taste of Sprint Cup action during the 2008 season. He was on standby for an ill Jeff Gordon at Kansas and for expectant father Casey Mears at Talladega, before competing in two races for Hendrick Motorsports in the No. 25 GoDaddy.com Chevrolet Impala. Keselowski finished 19th in his Cup debut, the Dickies 500 at Texas, and 23rd in the Ford 400 at Homestead.\n\nKeselowski returned to JR Motorsports to drive the No. 88 Chevrolet for the 2009 Nationwide Series, with sponsorship from GoDaddy.com, as well as competing in a limited Cup schedule. He drove the No. 25 GoDaddy.com Chevrolet for Hendrick Motorsports in seven races and drove the No. 09 Miccosukee-sponsored Chevrolet for Phoenix Racing in five races.\n\nKeselowski pulled off a massive upset and earned his first career Sprint Cup victory in the Aaron's 499 at Talladega. He pushed Carl Edwards towards the front from fifth with two laps to go. Coming out of turn four on the final lap, he attempted to trick Edwards into blocking on the high side so that he could pull underneath. Edwards moved high to block, opening the door for Keselowski to attempt a pass on the low side. When he saw Keselowski moving low, Edwards again tried to block him. Their cars made contact, with Edwards spinning as Keselowski charged to the checkered flag. Due to the rear-wing design on 2009 Car of Tomorrow, Edwards' car lifted off of the ground as it spun backward. After Ryan Newman's No. 39 hit Edwards' car, it sailed into the catch fence separating the track from the front grandstands, then skidded to a halt in the middle of the track. Eight fans were injured by flying debris; the most serious one being a woman who broke her jaw and was taken by helicopter to a nearby hospital. Keselowski earned his first career victory on his fifth career start and earned James Finch his first career victory as an owner in his twentieth year of racing. The race's final lap was the first Sprint Cup lap that Keselowski ever led, and therefore the only lap he led for the entire race; this was the first time in history that the very first lap a Sprint Cup driver led was the final lap of a race.\n\nKeselowski's victory at Talladega earned him more seat time in the James Finch-owned Chevy. Originally scheduled to appear next in the 18th race of the season, at Daytona International Speedway, he was then rescheduled to appear in the upcoming race at Richmond International Raceway. Keselowski also was entered into the Sprint All-Star Race as well. He was forced to pull out of the Richmond race due to commitments to his Nationwide Series team.\n\nKeselowski got his third Nationwide Series victory at Dover when Kyle Busch cut a tire on the restart and second-place Joey Logano made contact, allowing Keselowski to pass both.\n\nAfter taking a gamble and staying out past his pit-window, Keselowski garnered his fourth win at the first ever Nationwide race at Iowa Speedway after battling Kyle Busch to take over and maintain first position. Keselowski finishing first over Kyle Busch, though Busch still tied a record with his ninth consecutive top two finish.\n\nAt Montreal in the 2009 NAPA 200, Keselowski had a promising run. After a brief red flag for sprinkles, Keselowski only could hold his spot up in the top fifteen causing him to lose some spots in the standings. With three laps left, Keselowski barely avoided a pile-up in turn 1 to end up in fifth spot earning back his lost points. When the race ended with rival Carl Edwards as the winner, Keselowski among other drivers said that the pile-up and the shocking finish between Marcos Ambrose and Carl Edwards; resembled the finish of the Montreal race in 2007 when Marcos Ambrose almost won but was crashed by Robby Gordon during confusion of a similar crash in turn 1.\n\nKeselowski's next Nationwide Series victory came in August at the CARFAX 250 at Michigan International Speedway. Pole-sitter Brian Vickers and points-leader Kyle Busch dominated the race, but Keselowski passed them both on the final lap after a blocking move by Vickers on Busch forced both drivers to slow down slightly.\n\nThe rest of Keselowski's 2009 season in Sprint Cup was less than stellar. After the win, he only captured two top fifteens until November 2009. He met controversy at the fall race in Talladega when he bumped future teammate Kurt Busch going into the tri-oval causing a fifteen-car melee, that included Busch, Jeff Gordon, and Mark Martin - who went upside down after being clipped by Martin Truex Jr. Because Keselowski was already being ridiculed by most of the drivers and fans for how he drove aggressively throughout the races, this wreck earned him some jeers, including a disapproving look from Mark Martin.\n\nIn the Nationwide series, Keselowski also had a series of run-ins with Denny Hamlin. Throughout 2007, 2008, and 2009, Keselowski and Hamlin tangled in many races. After Keselowski punted Hamlin during the autumn Phoenix event in the Nationwide race, Hamlin said he would retaliate. The next week Hamlin kept his promise, intentionally colliding into Keselowski early in the race. The wreck ended Keselowski's huge chances of beating Kyle Busch for the championship. NASCAR black-flagged Hamlin 3 laps for aggressive rough driving, but Hamlin recovered for a top ten spot. Hamlin was unapologetic in an interview and fellow competitors said that Hamlin was justified.\n\nKeselowski ended up in third spot behind rivals Carl Edwards and Kyle Busch in the final NNS standings.\n\nAlthough Keselowski had rubbed some of his fellow drivers the wrong way with his driving style, the results he produced on the track seemed to indicate that a permanent move to the Sprint Cup Series was an inevitability. Despite his relationship with Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Hendrick Motorsports, the team did not have a car for him to drive full-time as each of their four regular teams had established drivers under contract. Keselowski began looking elsewhere and left the Chevrolet camp to drive a Dodge for Team Penske.\n\nIn 2010, Keselowski replaced David Stremme in the No. 12 Dodge Charger in the Cup Series and ran the full Nationwide Series schedule as well in the No. 22 Discount Tire. In Atlanta, on lap 41, Keselowski unintentionally tapped Carl Edwards on a restart and Edwards went up to the wall to collect Joey Logano. Later, Keselowski appeared to be headed toward a top-5 finish at Atlanta with three laps to go when Edwards, apparently in retaliation for this accident, intentionally spun Keselowski. Keselowski's car caught air and despite the roof flaps working his car overturned, hitting the front-stretch wall roof-first in an accident that resembled the Talladega finish of the previous year. His new teammate Kurt Busch ended up winning the race. Edwards was parked by NASCAR and Keselowski was physically okay, but shaken up from the heavy impact.\n\nKeselowski scored his first 2010 Nationwide win at Talladega on April 25, after crashing out of the Sprint Cup race earlier in the day, and then went on to win five more races at Richmond, Nashville, Michigan, and Charlotte. At Gateway International Raceway in 2010 Brad Keselowski fought rival Carl Edwards again in the closing stages of the Nationwide Race. On the final lap Keselowski got loose and unintentionally bumped Edwards. Keselowski briefly took the lead, but gave the position back and falling in behind Edwards. The two ran side-by-side through turns two and three before Edwards ran high in turn 4 and then made a hard left into the right quarter panel of the No. 22, tuning him intentionally into the wall hard at the finish line and causing an 11 car wreck. Keselowski's car came down in front of the field and was hit hard by the car of Shelby Howard. Keselowski climbed out of his car with a grimace on his face and mostly unscathed, though one driver was sent to the hospital with rib injuries. With his team and in victory lane Edwards was loudly booed as he bragged publicly that the crash was not an accident. Keselowski was infuriated and told a reporter that Edwards just wrecked him for no reason, saying, \"I am sure Edwards will say sorry or think about how cool he is in his mind but that is not reality.\" That week NASCAR put Edwards on probation for his actions, fined him $25,000, and deducted 60 points from him in the Nationwide Series point standings. NASCAR also placed Keselowski on probation just in case Keselowski felt the need to pay Edwards back. Both drivers were then told by NASCAR to either calm down the rivalry or face an indefinite suspension from the sport.\n\nAt Bristol in the Nationwide Series race Keselowski was the center of controversy because he was involved in an accident caused by Kyle Busch. In turn 3 with 33 laps left, Busch slid in front of Keselowski, causing Keselowski to bump him. Busch was angry that Keselowski bumped him, so in the next turn Busch retaliated, by intentionally wrecking Keselowski into the wall. NASCAR did not penalize Busch because they had previously made a rule allowing drivers to police themselves called \"Boys have at it.\" Keselowski finished in 14th instead of possibly contending for the race win. Kyle Busch ended up winning the race and admitted that wrecking Brad was on purpose in a post-race conference. In reply to the crash, Keselowski called Busch \"an ass\" during driver introductions before the Cup race. Both drivers were given a warning by NASCAR the next week and temporary placed on probation. In 2012, Keselowski and Kyle Busch announced that they ended their rivalry though they've had a few run-ins since (Such as when Keselowski and Busch made contact at Watkins Glen in 2012 and Busch crashing Keselowski at Kansas in 2013) that didn't boil over.\n\nThe next week at Montreal, Keselowski redeemed himself from Bristol. Keselowski had his greatest finish at the track in 4th spot. He was in 6th spot on the restart but Robby Gordon ran out of gas on the restart letting Keselowski battle Paul Menard for 4th place. Eventually as Boris Said and Max Papis had a close amazing finish for the win, Keselowski had a similar finish with Paul Menard with Keselowski holding off Menard for 4th spot.\n\nWith crew chief Paul Wolfe all year, Keselowski won his first ever NASCAR Nationwide Series title, collecting 6 wins, five poles, 26 top 5s, and 29 top 10s along the way. His 26 top 5s beat Kyle Busch's record of 25 top 5s set in 2009.\n\nIn the Sprint Cup it was a different story. Keselowski finished 25th in the final Sprint Cup standings and recorded one pole, no wins, 0 top 5s, and 2 top 10s.\n\nFor 2011, Keselowski moved over to Penske's long time flagship car, the No. 2 Miller Lite-sponsored Dodge. The switch with Kurt Busch, who had driven the car since 2006, occurred due to a sponsorship change and consolidation of operations at the team. Royal Dutch Shell, who had most recently sponsored Kevin Harvick's No. 29 Chevrolet for Richard Childress Racing, signed on to sponsor Penske's second car, which Keselowski had been driving. At the insistence of Shell, the more experienced Busch was moved to the renumbered No. 22 Dodge and his crew went with him. Keselowski, meanwhile, had his crew follow him to the No. 2 and the team's third unit, the No. 77 which had been driven by Sam Hornish Jr., was dissolved (its sponsor, Mobil 1, had left the team) and its operations merged with Keselowski's team.\n\nKeselowski's Nationwide Series crew chief Paul Wolfe replaced Jay Guy in the Sprint Cup Series; Todd Gordon became Keselowski's crew chief in the NASCAR Nationwide Series.\n\nKeselowski's 2011 Cup season began slowly, but starting in May his fortunes began to change. He won the pole for the 2011 Coca-Cola 600, and the following week, he was able to get the lead with nine laps to go and hold off a charging Dale Earnhardt Jr. to win the 2011 STP 400 at Kansas Speedway on fuel mileage. During his victory celebration, he ran out of fuel.\n\nWhile testing at Road Atlanta in August, Keselowski was driving over 200 miles per hour on a straightaway, but his brakes unexpectedly failed. Keselowski could not stop and slammed into a solid concrete wall violently at approximately 190 MPH and broke his left ankle. Keselowski was airlifted to a hospital, claiming he had terrible back pain. Despite racing with injuries, Keselowski won his second race of the season at the Good Sam RV Insurance 500 at Pocono Raceway less than a week after the accident. The win put him into contention to grab one of the two \"Wild Card\" spots available in the Chase for the Sprint Cup championship.\n\nThe next week, Keselowski finished second at the 2011 Heluva Good! Sour Cream Dips at The Glen. He took the lead on a restart two laps to go but was passed by Marcos Ambrose in turn five of the same lap. A violent crash involving David Reutimann and David Ragan on the last lap forced NASCAR to throw the caution, and Ambrose was declared the winner. Keselowski followed his 2nd-place finish with a 3rd-place finish at the Pure Michigan 400. The next week, Keselowski won his third race of the year at the Irwin Tools Night Race at Bristol.\n\nThat win virtually assured Keselowski a spot in the 2011 Chase for the Cup, given NASCAR's rule change designating the final two Chase spots as wild card slots for drivers ranked 11th through 20th in the points with the most wins. Keselowski finished the regular season 11th in points, using his three wins to qualify for his first career Chase.\n\nKeselowski was a factor for much of the Chase, before a late spin during the Tums Fast Relief 500 at Martinsville Speedway derailed his championship hopes. Still, Keselowski finished his second full Cup season fifth in the point standings, 84 points behind champion Tony Stewart. Keselowski finished the season with more wins than teammate Busch (three to two) and with a better points finish.\nIn addition to continuing running in the Sprint Cup Series and a limited Nationwide Series schedule for Penske Racing, Keselowski has competed in a limited number of Camping World Truck Series races for his own team as a teammate to Parker Kligerman.\n\nStatistically, 2012 was Keselowski's best Sprint Cup season to date: he won five races on the way to winning his first Sprint Cup championship. Keselowski started the year by memorably posting pictures and status updates via Twitter from his car during a red flag period. Cars were stopped on the track when a mechanical failure on Juan Pablo Montoya's car caused it to run into a jet dryer under caution at the Daytona 500, leading to a large fire that damaged the track surface, which had to be repaired before the race could be concluded. Keselowski was caught up in a crash on lap 188 and finished 32nd.\n\nOn March 18 he won his first race of the season, the Food City 500 at Bristol. He also won the Aaron's 499 at Talladega from a late race restart and a push from Kyle Busch that allowed him to overtake Matt Kenseth. It was the first time since Dave Marcis in 1976 that Dodge won a Sprint Cup Series race at Talladega and only the fourth win at the track for the automaker. (This also proved to be Dodge's last win at the track as the manufacturer left NASCAR following the end of the 2012 season.)\n\nOn June 30, Keselowski picked up his 3rd win at Kentucky Speedway, the first driver to win three races in the 2012 Cup season and joining Kyle Busch as the first two-time Sprint Cup winners of the race at Kentucky. Beginning with Kentucky, Keselowski went on a hot streak that lasted all the way to the season finale at Homestead that ultimately earned him his Sprint Cup title. In these 19 races, he only finished worse than 11th twice (30th at Bristol and 15th at Homestead).\n\nKeselowski won the first Nationwide series race to be contested at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, the Indiana 250. Although Penske Racing has fifteen victories in the Indianapolis 500, this was the team's first NASCAR triumph at the track.\n\nIn August 2012, Keselowski put himself in second place at the Nationwide race at Watkins Glen. He led the closing stages but several cautions ended up putting his old rival Carl Edwards to the lead; with two laps to go Keselowski fell back to second place and Edwards charged for the win and in victory lane he confirmed he and Keselowski no longer dislike each other; Keselowski in his review said the same confirmation.\n\nThe next day, Keselowski led 37 laps in the Finger Lakes 355 at Watkins Glen. With two laps to go, he was second behind Kyle Busch, and had Marcos Ambrose behind him. Busch slipped on oil after taking the white flag, and Keselowski slid into him, spinning him out in the esses. Keselowski then led most of the final lap before Ambrose was able to get by Keselowski in the final turns; Keselowski finished second to Ambrose in an almost carbon-copy repeat of the previous year's finish.\n\nKeselowski notched another 2nd-place finish the following week at Michigan, leading with 10 laps to go but being passed by Jimmie Johnson and Greg Biffle. Johnson's engine blew up leading with six laps to go, giving the race to Biffle. Keselowski's strong showing during the 2012 Sprint Cup season qualified him automatically for the Chase for the Sprint Cup, which he entered in 4th place on account of his 3 regular season wins.\n\nIn September, he won the first race in the Chase, the GEICO 400 at Chicagoland Speedway. Two weeks after that, he won at Dover after several of the dominant leaders had to pit late for fuel, allowing him to assume the point lead. Keselowski continued on a hot streak of top-eleven finishes: 7th at Talladega, 11th at Charlotte, and 7th at Kansas, although his point lead over Jimmie Johnson narrowed during this stretch. He lost the point lead to Johnson the following week at Martinsville, finishing sixth while Johnson won. The next week Keselowski finished second at Texas, racing Johnson hard before relinquishing the lead. His aggressive driving at the end of the race prompted defending champion Tony Stewart to say that Keselowski drove with a 'death wish.'\n\nWhile Johnson wrecked the following week in Phoenix, Keselowski's sixth-place finish allowed him to reassume the points lead by 20 points. During a red flag period due to Jeff Gordon intentionally crashing Clint Bowyer, Keselowski again tweeted a photo from his car. NASCAR fined Keselowski $25,000 for this, stating that it was prohibited under NASCAR rules (despite NASCAR not having penalized Keselowski for tweeting a photo from his car during the lengthy red flag at the Daytona 500). He qualified third for the finale at Homestead-Miami, but was then moved up to second after pole-sitter Joey Logano was involved in a Saturday practice wreck involving Greg Biffle and Denny Hamlin. Keselowski finished in 15th place, but still clinched his first Sprint Cup championship when Johnson dropped out of the race with gear failure, joining Jeff Gordon and Dale Earnhardt as the only drivers to win the Cup championship within their first three full-time seasons. In an interview on ESPN's SportsCenter during the post-race celebration, Keselowski admitted to being \"a little buzzed\" after consuming plenty of his sponsor, Miller Lite. The video of his interview went viral; interviewer Kevin Connors called it the best interview in SportsCenter's history.\n\nKeselowski opened the 2013 season with four straight top-5 finishes, including a fourth-place finish in the Daytona 500 despite being caught up in two crashes. He almost was on point to repeat what Dale Earnhardt had accomplished in 1995 – start off the season following his championship with five top five finishes, but this attempt came to an end at the Auto Club 500, where he finished 24th after dealing with handling issues. He posted three more top-10s in the next three races before suffering a dropped cylinder in his engine towards the end of the Toyota Owners 400 at Richmond International Raceway that relegated him to a 33rd-place finish. From April–May 2013, Keselowski had one of his worst spring starts of a NASCAR season.\n\nAt Talladega, Keselowski had a promising run. After a long red flag due to rain Keselowski was entering the top ten. He drove his way up to contention to win after two crashes. On the last restart, Keselowski started on the low line. Because of a misunderstanding, Keselowski was not happy with the race winner David Ragan after he ended up in 15th spot due to him being told to restart on the not preferred low line. David Ragan lined up on the high side after making a pass on Keselowski under caution. Ragan used the lane and went on to win a race that is considered the biggest upset of 2013.\n\nAfter climbing out of his car, Keselowski gave a rant on Twitter accusing David Ragan of lining up improperly and NASCAR allowing a rule violation. Nobody agreed with him and Keselowski got jeered by fans and medias; which further made Keselowski frustrated. However, after looking at a video of the finish Keselowski realized that NASCAR was directing fairly and that Ragan was fairly in his line; he apologized two days later.\n\nAt Darlington, Keselowski finished in 32nd place after being involved in a crash on lap 313. At Charlotte in the All-Star race, Keselowski had one of his most heartbreaking races ever. On lap 2, he lost a transmission. He had to slide 15,000 feet back around the track to get to the garage. His car had broke down from steering problems that would take the rest of the race to fix. Keselowski also attended the Indianapolis 500 to cheer on and direct his Team Penske friend/teammate Helio Castroneves. At the Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte, though, on lap 317, Keselowski was wrecked by Danica Patrick after her off-track boyfriend Ricky Stenhouse made it three wide. Keselowski subsequently retired from the race, finishing 35th, his first DNF since the 2012 Daytona 500. At Kentucky, Keselowski won the rain-shortened Nationwide race, but in the Sprint Cup race, he was tagged on lap 47 by Kurt Busch, causing a seven car wreck, and he finished 34th. He then had a 21st-place finish at Daytona in the Coke Zero 400.\n\nAt New Hampshire, Keselowski won his first pole of the season. On August 10, 2013, Keselowski won at Watkins Glen in the Nationwide series, giving him 4 consecutive wins in his last 4 starts.\n\nAt Watkins Glen International in the Cup race, Keselowski recovered from a spin in turn 1 to challenge former Cup rival Kyle Busch for the victory. Keselowski was unable to get by Kyle and finished in second place for the third consecutive time in the event (2011, 2012, and 2013). Brad raced Kyle completely clean, later saying he did it in an attempt to repair their old rivalry. After the event at Watkins Glen International, Keselowski said \"I had nothing for Kyle. He had a great run. Congrats to him and those guys. I could not get by him unless I wrecked him in that final turn and I didn't want to create drama so I decided to settle for my second place spot.\"\n\nAt Michigan, Keselowski nearly scored his first dream Cup victory at Michigan while in a fuel crisis. Keselowski led with 30 laps left but caution issues forced him to pit, putting him in 12th spot for the final results. The only positive side of Keselowski's heartbreak was that through his new teammate Joey Logano who won the race; Penske Racing won at the track they originated from. After the race, Keselowski emotionally said that although he was sad about losing, he was happy to have seen his entire team win the race through Logano. On September 5, 2013, Keselowski won the 3rd Nationwide series race at Richmond, making it 5 race wins in his last 6 starts, and his 24th career win in the series. However, he was in danger of being the second defending Sprint Cup champion since Tony Stewart to ever miss the Chase in the next season.\n\nAt Richmond, Keselowski led the most laps with 142, but a late caution during the race caused him to finish 17th, and missed the Chase due to being 16th in the points standings. On October 2, Keselowski signed a contract extension with Penske Racing to remain with the team until 2017.\nAt Charlotte, Keselowski started well, though he was penalized early when he left his pit during a pit stop under caution carrying the jack with him. He rallied to the last caution and took the last restart in 4th. After battling Kasey Kahne for the lead with 15 laps remaining, Keselowski took the point and captured the win. This was Keselowski's first win driving a Ford, snapping a 38 race winless streak, and also the first Chase race won by a \"spoiler\" (non-Chaser) since Kahne won at Phoenix in November 2011.\n\nHis car and teammate Joey Logano's car each failed pre-race inspections at the NRA 500 at Texas Motor Speedway due to an issue with the cars' rear-end housings. Keselowski was able to start the race from his original qualifying position as his car cleared inspection as driver introductions were ending, while Logano was forced to start from the back of the field because he didn't pass inspection in time to line up in the starting grid. After the race, Keselowski told members of the news media that he felt the Penske teams had been targeted by NASCAR. Both drivers finished the race in the top 10, with Keselowski finishing 9th.\n\nOn Wednesday, April 17, 2013, NASCAR announced penalties related to the rear-housing infraction discovered in Keselowski and Logano's cars prior to the NRA 500: Keselowski's crew chief Paul Wolfe, car chief Jerry Kelley, team engineer Brian Wilson and Penske competition director Travis Geisler were all suspended for the next six races, including the non-points Sprint All-star Race. Wolfe was also fined $100,000 and Keselowski was docked 25 driver points. Identical penalties were also handed down to all of the people in the same positions on Logano's team. Penske Racing released a statement saying the organization planned to appeal the penalties, but on May 1, the NASCAR Appeals Panel unanimously upheld the penalties. Team owner Roger Penske said he would further appeal the ruling to NASCAR Chief Appellate Officer John Middlebrook.\n\nKeselowski started his 2014 season finishing second to Denny Hamlin in the Sprint Unlimited.\n\nIn the Budweiser Duel, Keselowski led 34 laps early, until the cycle of green flag pit stops. However, he was caught speeding and ended up finishing dead last, three laps down. He still made the Daytona 500 under an owners points provisional. In the Daytona 500, Keselowski started 33rd, led 13 laps, and finished 3rd.\n\nAt Phoenix, Keselowski clinched his first pole of the season with a record lap speed of . He was the first driver to win a pole position under the two-round version of the new \"knockout\" qualifying procedure. Keselowski led three laps and finished 3rd.\n\nAt Las Vegas, Keselowski and Joey Logano swept the front row again, with Logano winning the pole. He led 53 laps and overtook Dale Earnhardt Jr. for the lead on the last lap after Earnhardt Jr. ran out of fuel to score his first win of the season. Keselowski was very emotional about his win because it automatically qualified him in the Chase; redemption from 2013 when he did not make the Chase.\n\nAt Martinsville a few weeks later Keselowski got into a feud with former Penske teammate Kurt Busch. On pit road Keselowski stopped for a stalled Kasey Kahne. Kurt didn't react in time and rammed Brad from behind. Keselowski replied by giving Busch a hand gesture on the track at lap 87. Kurt Busch threatened to \"(expletive) Brad's face up.\" Kurt calmed down and went on to win the race. This incident still remains a topic of debate.\n\nKeselowski nearly won the Toyota Owners 400 a few weeks later, but engaged in a battle with Matt Kenseth and Jeff Gordon which allowed teammate Joey Logano to take the lead and ultimately the win with 4 laps left. Kenseth had repeatedly blocked Keselowski, trying to keep him from winning the race. Keselowski showed displeasure with Kenseth after the race, pointing his finger at him and throwing his gloves into his own car. Keselowski called Kenseth's blocking \"Mind-boggling\". However, though Keselowski was upset with Kenseth, he jumped onto the hood of Logano's car and gave him a thumbs up. Keselowski and Logano are great friends off and on track.\n\nA week later at Talladega, Keselowski tried to go for the lead on lap 13, but when the leader, Danica Patrick, tried to slide behind Keselowski, she got into his left-rear quarter panel and wrecked him. Later in the race, Keselowski was trying to regain his final lap back but got loose and spun. 14 cars wrecked as they attempted to avoid Keselowski's spin. During the controversy over his spin, Keselowski said in an interview that it was not on purpose and apologized on television and in a tweet on Twitter. The victims of the wreck, fellow racers, and many fans were upset with Keselowski for his actions as it appeared that Keselowski was setting a double standard following his altercation with Matt Kenseth the previous week. Jeff Gordon is most notably one of the victims who called out Keselowski for his spin as well as Matt Kenseth (collected in the crash), who expressed his displeasure against Keselowski by using Brad's \"mind-boggling\" comment from Richmond against Brad.\n\nThe outcry of the Talladega spin sort of resembled the controversial pace-lap accident before the start of the 1982 Indianapolis 500 given that in both situations a controversial driver (Kevin Cogan, or Keselowski) spun out for no apparent reason and wrecked several cars, causing an outcry of controversy & given the fact that both Cogan and Keselowski drove for Penske at the time.\n\nKeselowski finished 2nd to Johnson at Dover. At Pocono, Keselowski took the lead from Justin Allgaier with less than 19 laps to go. On the final restart, a trash-bag lodged in Keselowski's grille, causing overheating. With four laps to go, Keselowski tried to use the lap down car of Danica Patrick to blow the trash off his grille, which cost him the win as Dale Earnhardt Jr. took advantage of Keselowski slowing to pass him for the win.\n\nA week later at Michigan, Keselowski finished 3rd, which marked his 3rd consecutive Top-3 finish. Keselowski himself is a Michigan native, and said that winning the Michigan race would mean more to him than just winning the Daytona 500. At Sonoma, Keselowski got wrecked on lap 11 by Kyle Busch after Keselowski threw a failed block on Busch. After the wreck, he struggled to a 23rd-place finish.\n\nAt Kentucky, Keselowski raced in all 3 series (CWTS, NNS, and NSCS) and nearly won both the truck race and the Nationwide race, but came up just short. Keselowski however dominated the Sprint Cup race and got his second win of the season. Keselowski said his team was in \"Championship Form\". Keselowski made the headlines when his hand got severely injured by a champagne bottle during the victory lane celebration. Keselowski was rushed to the hospital and released after getting stitches.\n\nAt Daytona, Keselowski got caught up in both Big Ones, but finished 18th, one lap down, by the time the race was called for rain.\n\nKeselowski had a perfect weekend in New Hampshire, when he won both Cup series practices, the pole for the Nationwide race, and leading one-hundred and fifty-five laps to win the Nationwide race. In the Cup race, Keselowski started 7th and moved to the lead early in the race to win his second Cup race in three weeks, his third of the year, and sweep the weekend.\n\nAt Iowa in the Nationwide Series, Keselowski qualified on the front row beside Ford Racing teammate, Trevor Bayne. Keselowski passed Michael McDowell with 2 laps to go to win the race. This was Keselowski's 3rd Nationwide Series victory of the season.\n\nAt Bristol in August, Keselowski won his first Camping World Truck Series race and became the twenty-fifth driver to record wins in all three of NASCAR's major series. He joined Aric Almirola as one of two drivers to record the feat in 2014. Keselowski had never won a Truck race in his previous 63 starts. The win also marked Ford's first truck win in the 2014 season.\nIn the Sprint Cup race, Keselowski finished second to teammate Joey Logano after leading many laps. Keselowski would later win the Federated Auto Parts 400 at Richmond, the 400th win for Penske.\n\nAt the Charlotte race in October, while under caution with six laps remaining, controversy struck Keselowski when, during caution laps, Matt Kenseth slammed into Keselowski's right front in response to a previous restart where Keselowski and Kenseth made unintentional contact. After the race, Denny Hamlin brake-checked Keselowski, due to being upset that Keselowski raced him hard. While driving onto pit road, Keselowski hit Kenseth in the door as retaliation to the incident that happened with 6 to go. When Keselowski began walking to his hauler, Kenseth physically attacked him from behind, and he had to be restrained by Keselowski's crew chief Paul Wolfe. During a later interview, Keselowski stated on lap 333, Kenseth had \"swung at [his] car and tore the whole right-front off of it.\" Keselowski voluntarily went to the Oval Office, but was fined $50,000 and placed on probation along with Tony Stewart who was fined $25,000. NASCAR stated in the penalty announcement that the main reason Keselowski was fined was because he made contact with Kenseth after the race had already ended. Despite this incident, Keselowski won at Talladega the following week, which allowed him to advance to the Eliminator Round of the Chase.\n\nDuring the AAA Texas 500, Keselowski once again was the center of controversy. On a green-white-checkered restart, Jeff Gordon entered the turn going to the high lane, leaving the middle lane open. Keselowski decided to go for it and try the same three-wide move on Gordon and Jimmie Johnson that he had done to win at Chicagoland, and Keselowski made contact with Gordon's rear quarter panel that cut down Gordon's left-rear tire, sending Gordon into a spin that relegated him to falling one lap down and finishing in 29th place, while Keselowski finished third. Following the race, Gordon approached Keselowski on pit road over the incident while both drivers were being surrounded by their pit crews. However, it escalated into a brawl due to Keselowski being shoved from behind by Kevin Harvick, who had wanted Keselowski to fight Gordon. The brawl ended up involving the crew chiefs of both teams as well as other members from Kasey Kahne, Danica Patrick and Paul Menard's teams. Both Gordon and Keselowski sustained facial injuries. He finished 4th in the 2014 Quicken Loans Race for Heroes 500, but it wasn't enough for him to advance to the final round. He was the highest ranking driver outside of the final four at the end of the season. He also had set a personal best record of six victories throughout the season, which was the highest number of wins for anyone in the 2014 season.\n\nOn January 25, 2015, Jeff Gluck of \"USA Today\" stated Keselowski was hired, along with Jeff Gordon and Kevin Harvick, as an Xfinity Series analyst for \"NASCAR on Fox\". Keselowski would be in the booth for the Atlanta, Phoenix, and Richmond races.\n\nKeselowski's season got off to a rocky start. During the Sprint Unlimited after starting 4th, running in the top ten for the first few laps and leading a few laps, Keselowski wrecked after slight contact from fellow driver Kyle Larson. He finished dead last in 25th place. Days later, Keselowski led the waning stages of the Daytona 300 in the Xfinity Series event. While leading on the final lap, Keselowski's momentum slowed down which allowed Ryan Reed to pass him for the lead and win the event. Keselowski finished 5th. The race was overshadowed by Kyle Busch's horrific crash with 8 laps to go.\n\nKeselowski led early at Phoenix, leading 52 laps but lost a critical amount of track position after his team made the mistake of not pitting before a caution with less than 142 laps to go. Restarting 29th after the caution, Keselowski raced his way back to the top ten, finishing 6th.\n\nThe next week at Fontana was a victorious weekend for Keselowski. After a late race restart, Keselowski impressively passed Kurt Busch on the final lap to win the race.\nKeselowski finished second the next week at Martinsville being beaten by rival Denny Hamlin by 0.3 seconds. He had the faster car in the ending laps but he was unable to win the race because after restarting 4th, he was unable to get by Matt Kenseth or Joey Logano, quick enough as Hamlin, to challenge Hamlin for the win.\n\nKeselowski had a dismal summer, but still made the Chase for the Cup. Keselowski led 52 laps at Martinsville, but got taken out of the race from contact with Matt Kenseth on a restart with 49 laps left. His crash set up the controversial wreck with Kenseth and teammate Joey Logano.\n\nAt Texas, Keselowski started on pole and led the most laps (312 of 334). However he got over-taken by Jimmie Johnson after a caution period with less than 10 laps to go. Keselowski finished second. Keselowski was eliminated from the final 4 spots of the Chase after finishing badly at Phoenix. Keselowski led the most laps of the Ford 400, but a late-race caution cost him the race, finishing 3rd behind Kyle Busch who won the race and the 2015 Cup series championship.\n\nKeselowski's season was more disappointing than his 2014 campaign. He finished out the season with 1 win, 9 top fives (5 of which were runners-up) 25 top tens, 3 poles and 1 DNF.\n\nKeselowski started his season on a high note, leading the most laps of the Sprint Unlimited at Daytona. A late-race caution kept him from winning the race. Keselowski recovered from a bad pit stop to finish 9th. Keselowski didn't have any promising races at Daytona and Atlanta. However, he got his first Cup win of the season at Las Vegas, passing Kyle Busch with 6 laps to go.\nKeselowski also won the 10th race of the season, the GEICO 500 at Talladega. He started 7th, and led the most laps, 46 laps. He used the outside line to take the lead on lap 73, and swapped the lead with NASCAR driver Denny Hamlin multiple times, before blocking the three wide lines. When NASCAR came back to Daytona, Brad would have the best car all night and led the most laps to win the Coke Zero 400 and get his third win of the season. Following that, at Kentucky, he would get his 4th win of the season, and second consecutive win, after a lengthy last 70 laps trying to conserve fuel. Keselowski made it through the first round of the Chase, but in the second round he was eliminated. At Charlotte he would finish 7th, the next week at Kansas he was running in the top 10 but with 77 laps to go, Keselowski got loose and spun through the infield, tearing up his splitter and going to the garage and finished 38th. Coming to Talladega, Keselowski was in a must win situation, he started 2nd and had the dominant car leading 90 laps but with less than 50 laps remaining, he got a piece of debris on the grille and blew his engine going to the garage and finishing 38th for the 2nd week in a row. His teammate Joey Logano would go on to win the race. He would be eliminated from the 2nd round.\n\nKeselowski crashed out of the 2017 Daytona 500 after leading 13 laps during the race. At Atlanta, Keselowski suffered from various pit issues, including being forced to pit for a flat tire and loose lug nuts, as the race was dominated by the Ford of Kevin Harvick. On the final restart with eleven laps to go, Harvick was issued a speeding penalty and sent to the rear and enabling Keselowski to start on the front row alongside Kyle Larson. After battling with Larson, Keselowski successfully passed him to record the win.\n\nAfter the Camping World 500 at Phoenix International Raceway, NASCAR announced that Keselowski's car had failed post-race laser inspection. Two days later, NASCAR penalized Keselowski with a $65,000 fine, a 35-point deduction and a 3-race suspension for crew chief Paul Wolfe. In the 2017 Auto Club 400, Keselowski spun early, but rebounded to finish second. After having Paul Wolfe serve one of the 3-race suspension, Team Penske announced plans to appeal the penalty and were granted a deferral of the remainder of the penalty, including the points and fine.\n\nKeselowski's second victory of the season came at Martinsville after passing Kyle Busch on lap 458. This was Keselowski's first win at the track, as well as the first there for Ford in 15 years.\n\nAfter Martinsville, Team Penske's appeal was heard. After a 3-hour hearing, the appeal was denied by the National Motorsports Appeals Panel. Team Penske requested a final hearing with National Motorsports Final Appeals Officer, Bryan Moss. Moss wasn't able to preside over the hearing due to illness, so NASCAR had a former USAC president, Roger Werner preside over the hearing. The appeal was denied on May 9 leaving Wolfe suspended from the sport.\n\nIt has been confirmed that Keselowski will return to Team Penske for the 2018 season.\n\nThe 2018 season started slow for Keselowski, as he failed to win at the first 24 races. He then won back-to-back races at Darlington and Indianapolis, giving Team Penske its first victory in the Brickyard 400, which was a highly coveted win for Team Penske given their history at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and the Indy 500. Keselowski backed up his Playoff run with a win at Las Vegas, giving Roger Penske his 500th overall motorsports victory as a car owner and advancing him to the Round of 12, despite surviving a hard crash at the Charlotte Roval. Keselowski was eliminated from the Round of 12 after the fall Kansas race and finished the season eighth in the points standings.\n\nKeselowski started the 2019 season with a 12th-place finish at the Daytona 500. A week later, he won at Atlanta; this gave him his 60th overall win with Team Penske and the first MENCS win for the new Ford Mustang GT. Keselowski followed this up with wins at Martinsville and Kansas. Keselowski dominated the early stages of the Coke 600, but spun out with 5 to go, finishing 19th. He finished fifth at the Charlotte Roval to advance to the Round of 12. For the second season in a row, Keselowski was eliminated in the Round of 12 after the Kansas race.\n\nKeselowski formed his own race team in 2007. The team began competing in the Truck Series in 2008. Keselowski drove the No. 29 Chevrolet himself and earned the team's first Top 10 finish.\n\nIn 2011 and part of 2012, Parker Kligerman drove the No. 29 Ram in the Camping World Truck Series for BKR. Kligerman finished 11th in points in 2011, but was released from BKR midway through the 2012 season, being replaced by Ryan Blaney. Blaney drove the team to its first victory on September 15, 2012 at Iowa Speedway.\n\nOn August 17, 2017, Keselowski announced that BKR would close at the end of the 2017 season, though he remained hopeful to reopen the team in the future and turn it into a Cup Series team.\n\nEstablished in early 2018 by Keselowski, Keselowski Advanced Manufacturing (KAM) was founded on the premise of celebrating American manufacturing, with an emphasis on additive manufacturing (also known as metal 3D printing). Specialties also include CNC machining, quality control through scanning capabilities and engineering design. KAM's vertically integrated company model is aimed at providing end-to-end capabilities for customers from engineering to prototype, to post processing to delivery. The company held its official launch on January 24, 2019.\n\nOn February 4, 2015, Keselowski announced that he and his girlfriend, Paige White, were expecting their first child, a girl. The baby, Scarlett, was born on May 19, 2015. On December 11, 2016, Keselowski announced his engagement with White. In 2019, they had another baby girl, Autumn. \n\nKeselowski is featured as himself alongside Penske teammate Joey Logano in the movie \"\".\n\nKeselowski guest starred in various episodes of the cancelled sitcom \"Sullivan & Son\".\n\nKeselowski had a cameo as a security guard in the 2017 film \"Logan Lucky\".\n\n Season still in progress\n\n \n"}

He is known for his time in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) from 1997 to 1999, where he performed under the ring name Kurrgan and was a member of The Truth Commission and The Oddities. He is also known for his roles in films such as \"300\" (2007), \"Sherlock Holmes\" (2009), \"Immortals\" (2011), \"Pacific Rim\" (2013), \"Brick Mansions\" (2014), \"Hercules\" (2014), and \"Deadpool 2\" (2018).\n\nMaillet was born in Georgetown, Ontario. Less than a year later, Maillet's family moved to Ste-Marie-de-Kent, New Brunswick, a French-Acadian village where he grew up.\n\nMaillet made an initial appearance in the WWF on November 11, 1991 when he wrestled as The Cajun Giant, defeating Bob Bradley in a dark match at a television taping in Utica, NY. He worked for Super World of Sports as Giant Goliath in 1991. He also spent some working for the Japanese W*ING promotion as Goliath El Gigante.\n\nHe was signed to the WWF in 1997, alongside The Jackyl, as a member of The Truth Commission. The group was sent to the United States Wrestling Association (USWA) before being called up to the main WWF roster, where Maillet's ring name evolved into The Interrogator (whose name was inspired by The Kurgan, and was occasionally referred to as Kurrgan the Interrogator on television). Under the tutelage of The Jackyl, a charismatic cult leader, Kurrgan was a heel known for applying the Iron Claw to his opponents and not breaking the hold until The Jackyl slapped him across the face.\n\nAfter The Truth Commission disbanded, Maillet (now billed simply as Kurrgan) continued as a singles wrestler managed by The Jackyl. He later went on to be part of The Oddities, The Jackyl's new stable; however, once The Jackyl was removed as the advisor of The Oddities and replaced by the Insane Clown Posse, The Oddities turned face and became fan favourites. Maillet later worked for Jacques Rougeau's wrestling events as Kurgan. On July 8, 2005, he wrestled Jim Duggan.\n\nMaillet appeared in the 2006 film \"300\", an adaptation of Frank Miller's graphic novel of the same name. He played the Über-Immortal, a savage berserker who was part of the enemy's imperial guard. In November 2008, during a fight scene for the 2009 film \"Sherlock Holmes\", he accidentally punched Robert Downey Jr. in the face, bloodying Downey and knocking him down. Downey later stated on an episode of the \"Late Show with David Letterman\" that Maillet was \"10 times more upset about it\" than he was.\n\nMaillet played a Russian professional boxer who took a dive in the 2011 film \"The Big Bang\". Later that year, he appeared in the film \"Monster Brawl\" as Frankenstein in a wrestling tournament of eight classic monsters that fight to the death. He played Polyphemus in the 2013 film \"\", Blackwell in the 2013 film adaptation of \"\", and the executioner in the 2014 film \"Hercules\".\n\nHe also had a recurring role on the Syfy original series \"Haven\" billed as a \"Heavy\", a thug for the series antagonist. In 2018, Maillet had a small part in the superhero film \"Deadpool 2\" as Sluggo, a mutant mercenary who is in prison alongside the titular character. He also had a part in the 2018 Netflix film \"Game Over, Man!\".\n\nMaillet has been married to Laura Eaton since June 13, 1997.

{"id": "2187369", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2187369", "title": "Johnson's Island", "text": "Johnson's Island\n\nJohnson's Island is a island in Sandusky Bay, located on the coast of Lake Erie, from the city of Sandusky, Ohio. It was the site of a prisoner-of-war camp for Confederate officers captured during the American Civil War. Initially, Johnson's Island was the only Union prison exclusively for Confederate officers but eventually held privates, political prisoners, persons sentenced to court martial and spies. Civilians who were arrested as guerrillas, or bushwhackers, were also imprisoned on the island. During its three years of operation, more than 15,000 men were incarcerated there.\n\nThe island is named after L. B. Johnson, the owner of the island beginning about 1852. It was originally named 'Bull's Island' by its first owner, Epaphras W. Bull, around 1809 (later misspelled \"Epaproditus\" Bull, by local-historians.).\n\nIn late 1861, Federal officials selected Johnson's Island as the site for a prisoner of war camp to hold up to 2,500 captured Confederate officers. The island offered easy access by ship for supplies to construct and maintain a prison and its population. Sandusky Bay offered more protection from the elements than on other nearby islands, which were also closer to Canada in the event of a prison break. Woods of hickory and oak trees could provide lumber and fuel. The U.S. government leased half the island from private owner Leonard B. Johnson for $500 a year, and for the duration of the war carefully controlled access to the island.\n\nThe prison opened in April 1862. A wooden stockade surrounded 12 two-story prisoner housing barracks, a hospital, latrines, sutler’s stand, three wells, a pest house, and two large mess halls (added in August 1864). More than 40 buildings stood outside the prison walls, including barns, stables, a limekiln, forts, barracks for officers, and a powder magazine. They were used by the 128th Ohio Volunteer Infantry, which guarded the prison. The prisoners had a lively community, with amateur theatrical performances, publishing, and crafts projects available.\n\nAfter the unraveling of a Confederate espionage ring which had been plotting the seizure of the Great Lakes warship USS \"Michigan\" and a mass breakout of prisoners, Forts Johnson and Hill were constructed over the winter of 1864–65. They were not operational until March 1865, in the war's final months, when the prisoner population peaked at 3,200.\n\nMore than 15,000 men passed through Johnson's Island until it was closed in September 1865. About 200 prisoners died as a result of the harsh Ohio winters, food and fuel shortages, and disease. Johnson's Island had one of the lowest mortality rates of any Civil War prison. Confederates made many escape attempts, including efforts by some to walk across the frozen Lake Erie to freedom in Canada, but only a handful of escapes were successful.\n\nAmong the prominent Confederate generals imprisoned on Johnson's Island were Isaac R. Trimble and James J. Archer (both captured at the Battle of Gettysburg), William Beall, Thomas Benton Smith, Edward \"Allegheny\" Johnson and Missouri cavalrymen M. Jeff Thompson and John S. Marmaduke, William Lewis Cabell later Mayor of Dallas and Lieutenant Christopher Columbus Nash, later the sheriff of Grant Parish, Louisiana, who directed the Colfax riot in 1873, was also imprisoned at Johnson's Island.\n\nAfter the war, the prison camp was abandoned. Most of the buildings were auctioned off by the Army, and some were razed after falling into disrepair. The last antebellum house burned down by accident in 1901. About 1894, a summer resort was established at the eastern end of the island, but its pavilion burned in 1897 and, although the pavilion was later rebuilt, the resort failed. The land was used for farming and rock quarrying. Many lakeside homes have since been built, and the island is now quite developed with two subdivisions. As a result of this development, most of the Civil War-related sites have been razed.\n\nOn June 8, 1910 Moses Ezekiel's statue \"Southern\" (or \"the Lookout\"), a monument to the Confederate prisoners held on the island, was unveiled.\n\nIn 1990 Johnson's Island was designated a National Historic Landmark. A causeway was built to connect it with the mainland. The Confederate cemetery, as well as Fort Hill in the interior of the island, are accessible to the public. Ground-penetrating radar studies have proved that several graves lie outside its fence. Heidelberg University conducts yearly archeology digs at the prison site.\n\nThe \"Friends and Descendants of Johnson's Island Civil War Prison\" was formed in 2001 to help in the preservation, interpretation, and education of the Johnson's Island Prison site. In conjunction with Heidelberg University, the Friends have sponsored educational and research programming at this National Historic Landmark.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Du Prez was a member of the 1980s multi-hit Salsa-driven pop band Modern Romance and has since written several film scores including \"Oxford Blues\" (1984), \"Once Bitten\", \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" (1990), and the final Carry On film, \"Carry On Columbus\" (1992). He contributed to \"The Wild\" (2006) soundtrack.\n\nDu Prez originally hails from Sheffield, England. He received his MA (Oxon), B.Mus., ARCM, and was a Trevelyan Scholar at Christ Church, Oxford. In 1976 he joined the staff of the London University's Music Department before becoming a full-time composer. He would then begin a 30-year working relationship with Eric Idle.\n\nDu Prez has often worked with Eric Idle for the music for Monty Python, most notably the score for \"Monty Python's The Meaning of Life\" as well as with John Cleese on \"A Fish Called Wanda\". He acted as music arranger on the Terry Jones film \"Monty Python's Life of Brian\" (1979) and on the Terry Gilliam film \"Time Bandits\" (1981), the latter starring Sean Connery, and he also co-wrote the music for the stage musical \"Spamalot\", as well as the music and the intro theme of the British series \"Captain Star\". In 1986, Du Prez contributed songs to the soundtrack of the Madonna and Sean Penn movie \"Shanghai Surprise\": \"The Hottest Gong In Town\" and \"Zig-Zag\" (both sung by the film's executive producer George Harrison).\n\nThe adoption of the name John Du Prez was to avoid confusion with the South African film composer Trevor Jones. He is probably best known as the trumpet and horn player in the 1980s Pop group Modern Romance, who had a string of Top 40 hits from 1981–83, and made many guest appearances on TV shows such as the BBC programme \"Top of the Pops\".\n\nJohn Du Prez has also scored various films including the Rob Lowe vehicle \"Oxford Blues\" (1984), the Comedy film \"A Private Function\" (1984), the Jim Carrey horror comedy \"Once Bitten\" (1985), and the \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" movies; his piece of music - or Suite - \"Shredder's Suite\" is taken from the soundtrack to the first of the three films, \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" (1990). He recently contributed to the soundtrack of the animated film \"The Wild\" (2006).\n\nDu Prez joined Modern Romance (band) during the early 1980s and remained with them throughout their most successful years. He appeared on their debut album \"Adventures in Clubland\" (1981) and on two further albums: \"Trick of the Light\" (1983) and \"Party Tonight\" (1983). He is probably best remembered as playing the trumpet solo on the Modern Romance cover version of Cherry Pink (and Apple Blossom White) which made the UK top twenty in 1982. The B-side to \"Cherry Pink ...\" is dedicated to Du Prez, a (nearly) instrumental track titled \"Who Is John Du Prez?\". Modern Romance scored seven further Top Forty hits before disbanding in 1985, including \"Best Years of Our Lives (Songs)\" which reached #4 on the UK chart and later featured in the movie Shrek. The other members of Modern Romance included Geoff Deane (Lead Vocalist), Paul Gendler (guitarist), David Jaymes (Bass player, Vocals and Founder Member), Robbie Jaymes (Keyboard player), Andy Kriacou (Drummer), and Michael J. Mullins (Lead Vocalist).\n\nModern Romance toured extensively throughout the early 1980s - including the UK, Europe, the Far East, and Venezuela - and were awarded several Gold Discs for their efforts. Their album, \"Adventures in Clubland\", hit the #1 spot - and went Gold - in South America, and produced three UK hits (\"Everybody Salsa\" #12, \"Ay Ay Ay Ay Moosey\" #10, and \"Queen of the Rapping Scene / Nothing Ever Goes the Way You Plan\" #37); the single \"Can You Move\" also peaked at #2 on the US Dance chart. Following a change in lead vocalist - from Geoff Deane to Michael J. Mullins - Modern Romance enjoyed what would be their watershed year, 1983. They made a significant dent in the UK charts with the following singles: \"Best Years of Our Lives\" #4, \"High Life\" #8, \"Don't Stop That Crazy Rhythm\" #14, \"Walking in the Rain\" #7, and \"Good Friday\" #96. Two albums - a studio album and a Christmas compilation - also made the UK album charts that year: \"Trick of the Light (album)\" #53 and \"Party Tonight\" #45. Du Prez's trumpets and horns featured on nearly every track, from the party songs \"Best Years of Our Lives\" and \"High Life\" to the salsa tunes \"Everybody Salsa\" and \"Ay Ay Ay Ay Moosey\" to the band's bluesy and soulful ballads like \"Walking in the Rain\", the latter UK top ten hit also reaching #1 in Thailand. He also played on the band's cover version of \"Band of Gold (Freda Payne song)\" (1983). Du Prez left Modern Romance before they called it quits in 1985, but his trumpets sounds could be heard on their farewell single, \"Best Mix of Our Lives\" (1985), their last chart entry (#81).\n\nDu Prez can be found - with the other band members - on the cover of the \"Trick of the Light (album)\", which was featured in the Taschen Book \"1000 Record Covers\". The book presents a selection of the best vinyl cover art from the 1960s to the 1990s, and from a cross section of music genres. From a recording and production standpoint, the bulk of Modern Romance's music was produced by Tony Visconti; they were signed by the record labels WEA and Ronco. Du Prez and Modern Romance performed their hit single, \"High Life\", on the \"Russell Harty Television Show\" in 1983, with Cleo Rocos as backing vocalist.\n\nIn 2006 Du Prez featured on the Warner CD \"Modern Romance: The Platinum Collection\", a compilation featuring the best of Modern Romance.\n\nA long time friend of Eric Idle, Du Prez composed the score for \"Monty Python's The Meaning of Life\" in 1983, while still a member of Modern Romance (band). The film stars John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Graham Chapman, Idle, and Michael Palin. It is directed by - and also features - Terry Jones. Du Prez also contributed as composer.\n\nDu Prez composed the score for this 1980s remake of A Yank at Oxford (1938). Oxford Blues (1984) was an early project for Rob Lowe, a teen drama which also featured Cary Elwes, Michael Gough, Chad Lowe, Amanda Pays, Julian Sands and Ally Sheedy.\n\n\"A Private Function\" (1984) marks another team-up with Michael Palin. This comedy (film) - the score composed by Du Prez - also stars Alan Bennett, Denholm Elliott, Pete Postlethwaite and Maggie Smith. Du Prez also contributes as conductor.\n\nThis film was an early film for Jim Carrey, Karen Kopins and Lauren Hutton. \"Once Bitten\" (1985) is a mixture of the horror film and the comedy (film). It also features Cleavon Little. Du Prez is score composer.\n\nFeaturing some of the Monty Python cast, \"A Fish Called Wanda\" (1988) included John Cleese, Jamie Lee Curtis, Kevin Kline and Michael Palin. This is a British comedy (film) for which Du Prez wrote the score.\n\n\"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" (1990) is an action, adventure and comedy - based on the \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" comic book. Du Prez composed the score for the movie, whilst Corey Feldman, Judith Hoag, Elias Koteas, David Warner and other actors provided the voices or played live-action roles. Du Prez also provided the score for the sequels, \"\" and \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III\", and his song - \"That's Your Consciousness\" - can be found on the second film's .\n\n\"Carry On Columbus\" (1992) is a landmark in film, in that it is the final chapter in the Carry On films. Du Prez composed the score for this comedy which stars Julian Clary, Bernard Cribbins, Jim Dale, Maureen Lipman, Rik Mayall, Leslie Phillips, Nigel Planer, Alexei Sayle, and June Whitfield.\n\n\"Fascination\" (2004) is an American mystery thriller starring Jacqueline Bisset, Adam Garcia, and James Naughton. Du Prez composed the score for the film and would work once more with Modern Romance (band) member, David Jaymes, who acted as music supervisor, having since ventured into the management side of the business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2187390", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2187390", "title": "Regular Army (United States)", "text": "Regular Army (United States)\n\nThe Regular Army of the United States succeeded the Continental Army as the country's permanent, professional land-based military force. Even in modern times the professional core of the United States Army continues to be called the Regular Army. From the time of the American Revolution until after the Spanish–American War, state militias and volunteer regiments organized by the states (but thereafter controlled by federal authorities and federal generals in time of war) supported the smaller Regular Army of the United States. These volunteer regiments came to be called United States Volunteers (USV) in contrast to the Regular United States Army (USA). During the American Civil War, about 97 percent of the Union Army was United States Volunteers.\n\nIn contemporary use, the term Regular Army refers to the full-time active component of the United States Army, as distinguished from the Army Reserve and the Army National Guard. A fourth component, the Army of the United States, has been inactive since the suspension of the draft in 1973 and the U.S. armed forces became an all-volunteer armed force.\n\nThe American military system developed from a combination of the professional, national Continental Army, the state militias and volunteer regiments of the American Revolutionary War, and the similar post-Revolutionary War American military units under the Militia Act of 1792. These provided a basis for the United States Army's organization, with only minor changes, until the creation of the modern National Guard in 1903. The Militia Act provided for the use of volunteers who could be used anywhere in time of war, in addition to the State militias who were restricted to local use within their States for short periods of time. Even today's professional United States Army, which is augmented by the Army Reserve and Army National Guard, has a similar system of organization: a permanent, professional core, and additional units which can be mobilized in emergencies or times of war.\n\nThe United States Army traces its origin to the founding of the Continental Army on June 14, 1775, when the Continental Congress authorized a one-year enlistment of riflemen from Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia to join the New England militia army besieging Boston. Late in 1776, Congress called for the Continental Army to serve for the duration of the war. The army was to consist of 88 battalions raised and equipped by the states, with officers appointed by the states. Appointment of officers actually continued to be a collaboration between Congress, the Commander in Chief, George Washington, and the states. The number of battalions was to be apportioned to the states according to their populations. While the initial number of battalions approached the authorized strength, by 1 January 1787 the Continental infantry was only able to maintain enough regiments for fifty battalions. During the Revolutionary War, battalions and regiments were essentially the same. By October 19, 1781 when the British army under General Cornwallis surrendered to the American and French forces at Yorktown, the Continental Army had grown to sixty battalions.\n\nFor varying short periods of time during the war, many state militia units and separate volunteer state regiments (usually organized only for local service) supported the Continental Army. Although training and equipping part-time or short-term soldiers and coordinating them with professionally trained regulars was especially difficult, this approach also enabled the Americans to prevail without having had to establish a large or permanent army.\n\nBecause of the inability of Congress to raise much revenue under the Articles of Confederation, American suspicion of standing armies and perceived safety from foreign enemies provided by large oceans effectively controlled by the then non-threatening British Navy, Congress disbanded the Continental Army after the Treaty of Paris, the peace treaty with Great Britain, became effective. Congress retained 80 caretaker soldiers to protect arms and equipment at West Point, New York and Fort Pitt and called on the States to furnish 700 men from their militias for one year of service on the frontier. The delegates to the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia in 1787 recognized the need for a more permanent military establishment and provided for a national regular army and navy and a militia under state control, subject to civilian control through congressional control of appropriations and presidential leadership as commander in chief of the regular forces and of the militia when called into federal service.\n\nOn June 3, 1784, the day after the Continental Army was reduced to 80 men, the Congress established a regiment which was to be raised and officered by obtaining volunteers from the militia of four of the states. This unit, the First American Regiment was commanded until 1 January 1792 by Josiah Harmar of Pennsylvania, gradually turned into a Regular regiment known as the 1st Infantry in 1791, and in 1815 was it redesignated as the 3d Infantry in the reorganization of the army following the War of 1812. Congress gradually increased the military establishment from 700 men in 1784 to 5,104 in 1793.\n\nThe United States military realised it needed a well-trained standing army following St. Clair's Defeat on November 4, 1791, when a force led by General Arthur St. Clair was almost entirely wiped out by the Western Confederacy near Fort Recovery, Ohio. The plans, which were supported by U.S. President George Washington and Henry Knox, Secretary of War, would lead to the creation of the Legion of the United States. The command would be based on the 18th-century military works of Henry Bouquet, a professional Swiss soldier who served as a colonel in the British Army, and French Marshal Maurice de Saxe.\n\nIn 1792 Anthony Wayne, a renowned hero of the American Revolutionary War, was encouraged to leave retirement and return to active service as Commander-in-Chief of the Legion with the rank of Major General. The Legion, which was recruited and raised in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, was formed around elements of the 1st and 2nd Regiments from the disbanded Continental Army. These units then became the First and Second Sub-Legions. The Third and Fourth Sub-Legions were raised from additional recruits. From June 1792 to November 1792, the Legion remained cantoned at Fort LaFayette in Pittsburgh.\n\nThe new command was trained at Legionville, near present-day Baden, Pennsylvania. The base was the first formal basic training facility for the United States military. Throughout the winter of 1792-93, existing troops along with new recruits were drilled in military skills, tactics and discipline. The Legion then went on to fight the Northwest Indian War, a struggle between American Indian tribes affiliated with the Western Confederacy in the area south of the Ohio River. The overwhelmingly successful campaign was concluded with the decisive victory at the Battle of Fallen Timbers on August 20, 1794. The training the Legion received at Legionville was seen as instrumental to this victory.\n\nHowever, after Wayne's death, Brigadier General James Wilkinson, who was once Wayne's second-in-command of the Legion, began disbanding his former superior's organization in December 1796. His policy was to re-establish a military model based on a regimental system. Wilkinson, who was later found to be a paid agent for the Spanish Crown, tried to rid the US Army of everything Wayne had created. This resulted in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th Sub-Legions becoming the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th Regiments of the United States Army. Nevertheless, the new regiments honored their foundations:\n\nIn 1808, Congress agreed to the expansion of the Regular Army. This led to the establishment of the 5th, 6th and 7th Regular infantry regiments, and a Regiment of Riflemen. The decision was undertaken partly due to British aggression on the high seas. But it was also motivated by fears that the British were offering military support to the American Indians who were offering armed resistance to the expansion along the Northwest American frontier. There was also a powerful motivation for the American government to uphold national honor in the face of what they considered to be British insults (such as the \"Chesapeake\" affair in 1807).\n\nIn January 1812, with the threat of war with Britain looming larger, Congress authorized the army to add ten more regiments of infantry, which were to be larger than the existing regiments and authorized the President to call 50,000 militiamen into service, but in June 1812 Congress authorized a total of 25 infantry regiments of equal strength for the Regular Army. All the while the States competed with the Federal government for soldiers with shorter terms of enlistment for their regiments. Congress then directed the creation, in January 1813, of twenty new infantry regiments enlisted for just one year. Nineteen of them were raised. Early in 1814 four more infantry regiments and three more regiments of riflemen were constituted. These 48 regiments of infantry and 4 rifle regiments were the greatest number of infantry units included in the Regular Army until the First World War. Despite this increase in Regular Army units, nine out of ten infantrymen in the War of 1812 were militiamen.\n\nAt the end of the war, by an act of March 1815, Congress set the peace establishment of the Regular Army at 10,000 men, divided among 8 infantry regiments, 1 rifle regiment; and a corps of artillery, but no cavalry regiments. In effect, most of the new regiments raised for the War of 1812 were treated as if they were volunteer regiments raised for the duration of the war and disbanded at its end.\n\nIn 1821 Congress felt safe enough to cut expenses by disbanding the Rifle Regiment and the 8th Infantry and reducing the size of companies to fifty-one enlisted men, the smallest ever. This arrangement endured for fifteen years when the Indians forced an enlargement. A mostly militia force won the Black Hawk War of 1831–1832. However, the Regular Army needed to be increased by 39 men per company plus one infantry regiment and volunteer and militia units had to be used, at least at first, in order to win the Seminole Wars in Florida, which began in December 1835 and lasted until 1842. After the war, the companies were reduced to minimum size but the second regiment of dragoons which had been added to the army was turned into a regiment of riflemen. When they were reconverted to dragoons after a year, the rifle corps disappeared.\n\nAt the start of the Mexican War, Congress tried to get along with just eight infantry regiments of Regulars, but gave the President power to expand their companies to one hundred enlisted men during the war. After hostilities commenced, Congress had to add nine new regiments with the same organization as the old ones to the Regular infantry. The cavalry of the U.S. Regular Army consisted of two light regiments trained to fight mounted or dismounted and designated as dragoons. Although raised as Regulars, the nine new infantry regiments created during the Mexican War were disbanded when the war was over. By contrast to the army of mainly militiamen who fought the War of 1812, in the Mexican War, one of every ten soldiers was a militiaman, three were Regulars and six were war volunteers. During the Mexican War, some 73,260 volunteers enlisted, although fewer than 30,000 actually served in Mexico.\n\nCongress added two new regiments to the Regular Army in 1855 because of the need to protect the large additional territory obtained from Mexico.\n\nDuring the American Civil War, the Union Army consisted of a very small contingent of pre-war U.S. Army or \"Regular Army\" personnel combined with vast numbers of soldiers in state volunteer regiments raised and equipped by the States before being \"federalized\" and led by general officers appointed by the President of the United States and confirmed by the United States Senate. In many ways, these regiments resembled and might be analogized to the modern day National Guard. Due to their pre-war experience, they were considered by many to be the elite of the Union Army, and during battles regular army units were often held in reserve in case of emergencies.\n\nOfficers during the Civil War from the state forces were known by the rank suffix \"of volunteers\"; if Regular Army, these officers were known by the rank suffix \"USA\". Thus, a state regiment colonel would be known as \"colonel of volunteers\" while a Regular Army captain would be known as \"Captain, USA\". Regular Army officers of the Civil War could accept commissions in volunteer forces and could also be granted brevet ranks (higher ranks than the permanent commission). In some cases, officers held as many as four ranks: a permanent rank (called \"full rank\") in the Regular Army, a full rank in the volunteers, and brevet ranks in both as a result of battlefield promotion, meritorious service or Congressional action. The officers typically would only refer to themselves by the highest rank they held. An example is Union Army officer James Henry Carleton who was a \"full\" captain, a brevet major in the regular army, a colonel of volunteers, and a brevet brigadier general.\n\nAfter the Civil War ended in 1865, the term Regular Army was used to denote an officer's permanent rank only when a brevet commission had also been received. Such was the case with George Custer who was a brevet major general of volunteers and a brevet Regular Army brigadier general while holding the permanent rank of lieutenant colonel in the Regular Army. If no brevet rank was held, the officer was simply referred to by his permanent rank and the suffix \"USA\". Enlisted personnel could not hold brevet ranks and were all considered simply as United States Army personnel.\n\nThe Confederate Army had its own approximate of the Regular Army, this known as the \"Army of the Confederate States of America\" or the \"ACSA\". The ACSA was considered the professional military while, as in the Union Army, the Confederacy mustered massive numbers of state volunteers into the \"Provisional Army of the Confederate States\" or the \"PACS\". Nearly all Confederate enlisted personnel were PACS while most senior general officers held dual commissions in the ACSA and PACS. Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson, for instance, was a lieutenant general in the PACS while holding the permanent rank of major of artillery in the ACSA. The ACSA concept was also used to ensure that none of the senior Confederate officers could ever be outranked by militia officers, considered subordinate to the PACS.\n\nDuring World War I, with the founding of the National Army, the term Regular Army was used to describe a person's peacetime rank in contrast to the commissions offered to fight in the First World War. The Regular Army, as an actual U.S. Army component, was reorganized by the National Defense Act of 1920 (amending the National Defense Act of 1916), when the large draft force of the National Army was demobilized and disbanded. The remaining Army force was formed into the peacetime Regular Army (which included inactive units in the Regular Army Inactive [RAI]), augmented by the Organized Reserve (created by combining the Officer Reserve Corps (ORC) and the Enlisted Reserve Corps (ERC) authorized by the 1916 act), predecessor to the United States Army Reserve. \n\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, the Regular Army was badly underfunded and ranked 16th in the world. Promotions within the Regular Army were also very slow. Commissioned officers could easily spend 10 to 15 years in the junior grades. Enlisted personnel would often never rise above the rank of private. Dwight Eisenhower, for instance, spent sixteen years as a major before being promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1936.\n\nDuring World War II, the Regular Army served as a corps of professionals who helped formed the initial leadership of the Army of the United States. Regular Army officers would sometimes hold two ranks: a permanent rank in the Regular Army and a temporary rank in the Army of the United States. Promotions within the Army of the United States were also very rapid and some officers were known to hold the permanent Regular Army rank of captain while serving as a colonel in the Army of the United States. The Army of the United States rank could also be revoked (sometimes known as \"loss of theater rank\") meaning that an officer would revert to Regular Army rank and, in effect, be demoted.\n\nEnlisted personnel did not hold dual ranks; rather, they were soldiers either in the Regular Army or the Army of the United States. To be a Regular Army soldier was also seen as a point of honor because they had voluntarily enlisted rather than being drafted. Enlisted Regular Army personnel were known by the \"RA\" abbreviation before their service numbers in contrast to the \"AUS\" of the Army of the United States.\n\nAfter the demobilization of the Army of the United States in 1946, the United States Army was divided into the Regular Army (RA) and the Army Reserve (USAR). During the Korean War, the Army of the United States was reinstated but had only enlisted draftees. Officers after this point held Regular Army rank only, but could hold an additional \"temporary\" rank in addition to their permanent rank. Temporary Regular Army ranks were not as easily revoked as the former AUS ranks.\n\nSince the Vietnam War, officers' permanent rank is their RA rank. Active duty officers can hold an RA commission and rank and may also hold a higher rank with a USAR commission. Reserve officers hold only a USAR commission, but may serve in either the reserve component or on active duty. That is, all non-permanent ranks (including theater rank, temporary rank, battlefield promotions, etc.) are handled through USAR commissions. Those officers without RA commissions do not have a permanent rank. Enlisted ranks are all permanent RA ranks.\n\nAfter Vietnam, most Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) and Officer Candidate School (OCS) graduates, and those receiving direct commissions were commissioned as RA, US Army Reserve (USAR), or into the Army National Guard of the United States (ARNG). USAR officers could be assessed into the basic USAR component; that is, officers who served one weekend a month and two weeks a year for training, or as an Other Than Regular Army (OTRA) officer. RA and OTRA officers were those who came on active duty and were expected to serve their full commission service obligation or until retirement. At promotion to major, OTRA officers had the option of requesting integration into the RA or remaining OTRA. If not selected for promotion to lieutenant colonel, OTRA majors were required to retire at 20 years unless the Secretary of the Army authorized further service as part of the Voluntary Indefinite (VOLINDEF) program. In the late 1990s, as part of a series of officer management regulatory changes, upon promotion to major all OTRA officers were required to integrate into the RA or exit service within 90 days. Recently, OTRA is rarely used with virtually all new officers being commissioned RA, USAR, or into the National Guard as appropriate.\n\nAfter the abolition of the draft, the Regular Army became the primary component of the United States Army, augmented by the Army Reserve and Army National Guard of the United States. In the early 1980s, the use of temporary Regular Army ranks was suspended.\n\nSince passage of the 2005 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), all active duty officers are commissioned in the regular army. Eligible commissioned officers serving on active duty were automatically converted to RA on/or after Veteran's Day, 11 November 2005.\n\n\n"}

He won races in NASCAR's two top Northeast touring series (Modified and K&N East) and all three national divisions (Camping World Truck, Nationwide, Sprint Cup). Park was born in East Northport, New York as the youngest of four sons.\n\nPark began racing not in an entry-level class, but in NASCAR Modifieds on Long Island of longtime National Modified Championship contender Bob Park. After establishing himself in weekly Modified racing at Riverhead Raceway, he advanced to the NASCAR Featherlite Modified Series. He won several races and became a championship contender before moving on to the Busch Series.\n\nPark won twice in NASCAR's highest division, but injuries derailed his Cup Series career.\n\nPark was first hired by seven-time Winston Cup Champion Dale Earnhardt in 1996. Initially, Park refused to return Dale's phone messages, who was calling with interest to hire Park, thinking his friends were pranking him. However, after finally being convinced that the real Dale Earnhardt was calling him, Park made one start in the No. 31 Busch Series (now known as the Xfinity Series) car in Charlotte in October that resulted in a 29th-place finish. Park was then given a full-time ride in Earnhardt's No. 3 AC-Delco-sponsored car for the 1997 season. Throughout the season, Park posted three wins at Nashville, Michigan, and Richmond, walking away with Rookie of the Year honors with a third-place finish in the final points standings.\n\nPark came to the Winston Cup Series (now known as Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series) as the driver for the No. 14 team of Dale Earnhardt Inc. (DEI) in 1997. He attempted eight races in this car, qualifying for four of them. He also ran a race in the No. 40 car at Martinsville Speedway for Felix Sabates. In the 1998 season, Park switched to the No. 1 Chevrolet for DEI and drove the first two races, but he failed to qualify at the third race of the year at Las Vegas. During practice for the fourth event of the year at Atlanta, Park suffered a tire failure and had three hard hits before his car came to rest. He sustained a broken leg, broken collarbone, broken shoulder blade, and two chipped front teeth. Park returned later in the year at Indianapolis and ran the rest of the year. He posted a best finish of 11th at Michigan and Dover.\n\nIn 1999, his first of only two full Winston Cup seasons, Park finished 30 of 34 races. He went out with handling problems during the Daytona 500 and Charlotte, an engine failure at the other Daytona race, and a crash at Sears Point. In the Sears Point crash, Park spun around in turn two and backed into an embankment, thrusting his car up into the air and over onto the top of a tire barrier. Park posted a best finish of sixth in the Kmart 400 at Michigan and finished 14th in the point standings.\n\nDuring the 2000 NASCAR Winston Cup Series, Park would grab his first win at his home track of Watkins Glen, winning the 2000 Global Crossing @ The Glen and finish 11th in the point standings.\n\nPark's 2001 season began with a crash in lap 173 of the Daytona 500, in which he was one of eighteen cars involved. He was unhurt and had led for several laps prior to the crash, which itself was overshadowed by his employer Dale Earnhardt's fatal crash on the last lap. The following week, Park scored an emotional win for DEI by winning the Dura Lube 400 at North Carolina Speedway. He also competed in the Busch Series that season, but on September 1, he was injured in a crash at Darlington Raceway while driving the No. 31 Chevrolet for Marsh Racing. While under caution, his steering wheel came off, causing him to yank a hard left. At the same time, Larry Foyt was speeding up to join the front for the restart, and he rammed the driver side of Park's car. Park was hospitalized with a brain injury and several broken ribs, and suffered double vision and slurred speech. Foyt said that his car was traveling \"well over 100 miles per hour.\" The incident marked the beginning of Park's struggles to get back into NASCAR's upper divisions.\n\nPark missed the first four races in 2002, but he returned to race at the fifth race of the year at Darlington. He had many accidents, however. The largest incident was a flip at Pocono Raceway, where he spun into and was turned by his teammate Dale Earnhardt Jr. and hit the infield barrier with tremendous velocity, causing him to flip over. The race had a 65-minute red flag to repair the old-fashioned guardrail highway barrier that Park hit. The barriers were replaced afterwards.\n\nDuring the 2003 NASCAR Winston Cup Series, Dale Earnhardt, Inc. let Park go midway into the season, and he was effectively \"traded\" to Richard Childress Racing for Jeff Green, who took over the No. 1 car from Park with Park taking over the No. 30 car for Childress. A few days later, he won the pole for the Winston All Star Open, but at the start of the race he jumped the start and had to start from the rear. He never made it to the next round. His best finish at RCR was a 5th-place finish at Michigan that June, as he fought then teammate Robby Gordon for that position.\n\nAt the end of the 2003 season, Park announced he would not return to the No. 30 car and would join the Craftsman Truck Series the following season. He joined Las Vegas-owned team Orleans Racing and piloted the No. 62 truck, vacated by Brendan Gaughan who was offered a ride in the No. 77 Nextel Cup car for Penske Racing. Although Park never won a race in 2004, he finished 9th in CTS driver points, and was voted Most Popular Driver by his peers.\n\nIn 2005 Park won the Craftsman Truck Series American Racing Wheels 200, the second race of the season at California Speedway, and became the tenth driver to win a race in all three of NASCAR's top racing series (one of seven drivers to accomplish the feat in the 2005 season alone). However, Park and the team struggled the rest of the season, and in October, right before the truck race in Martinsville, Park and Orleans Racing parted ways due to Dodge pulling support and money to many truck teams.\n\nIn 2008 Park signed with NDS Motorsports and drove the No. 35 Monte Carlo in all 13 of the NASCAR Camping World East Series events. He finished 9th in the standings with his best finish being second place at New Hampshire Motor Speedway.\n\nIn 2009 Park returned to race in the No. 35 Monte Carlo in the NASCAR Camping World East Series. He finished 5th in the point standings. Park made a single start in the Chevy for Corrie Stott Racing in the series, starting 31st and finishing 25th. On August 1, 2009, he won the Edge Hotel 150 at Adirondack International Speedway. It was his first East Series win since July 1, 1996 at Nazareth Speedway.\n\nIn 2010 Park returned again to race in the East Series. Park also drove the numbers 46 and 41 Vandyk Baler Corp/ Bollegraaf Toyotas in the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series for Eddie Sharp Racing in 2010 for three races (two in the 41 and one in the 46), with a best finish of 18th at Chicagoland Speedway.\n\nPark returned to the Sprint Cup Series in July 2010, driving the No. 36 Chevrolet for Tommy Baldwin Racing. In his first Sprint Cup Series race in several years, Park started the Coke Zero 400 at Daytona from the 39th position, as qualifying was rained out. He went on to finish 13th and led one lap. Park's fan-sponsored car was painted to honor Richie Evans, a nine-time NASCAR Modified champion who was killed in a racing accident shortly after winning his final championship in 1985.\n\nPark ran one race for Tommy Baldwin Racing at Talladega, however he retired from the race after completing only four laps. He also attempted the Sylvania 300 at New Hampshire Motor Speedway later that year, but he failed to qualify. The fan-sponsored New Hampshire car was intended to honor six-time Modified Series champion owner Len Boehler. He also ran two races on the NASCAR Southern Modified Tour, finishing fifth at Connecticut's Thompson Speedway and twelfth at Charlotte.\n\nIn October 2012, Park spoke to ESPN in support of IMPACT (Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing) and other neurological testing for drivers in the wake of his former teammate Dale Earnhardt Jr. being sidelined after sustaining a concussion at Talladega. Park himself was a victim of crashes that took him out of action.\n\nPark entered a Whelen Modified Tour race during Speedweeks at Daytona. The race was run as part of the inaugural UNOH Battle at the Beach to open Daytona's new backstretch .4 mile short-oval configuration.\n\nOn the final lap Park was pushed from behind by Eric Goodale into race leader Mike Stefanik and inadvertently wound up winning the race. It was Park's first modified racing victory since 1996. Stefanik was visibly upset with the incident, calling it \"just bullshit\".\n\nIn late 2008, Park was married to longtime girlfriend, Jessica Skarpalezos at Sea Island, Georgia. On January 2, 2010, Park announced on his website the birth of his son Jayden Robert Park.\n\nPark owns and operates a Batteries Plus Bulbs franchise in Mooresville, North Carolina.\n\nPark was inducted into the Suffolk Sports Hall of Fame on Long Island in the Auto Racing Category with the Class of 2004.\n\n"}

He raced in all of the top three NASCAR series in the 2000s.\n\nKluever began his career by racing motorcycles for over nine years before he moved into full-bodied stock cars at a local track. He raced stock cars in the summer and snowmobiles during the Wisconsin winters. Kluever was the 2000 Rookie of the Year at Dells Motor Speedway in Wisconsin. In 2001, he won the Madison International Speedway Late Model Track Champion, and the Midwest All Racing Series (MARS) Championship and Rookie of the Year. He began racing in the American Speed Association in 2002, and finished 10th in the final points standings. He finished seventh in the 2003 final points standings. In 2004, he had four Top 10 finishes in 13 races, but the series' existence ended during the season. In October 2004, he was given the opportunity to participate in the at North Wilkesboro Speedway. He beat out 25 drivers to make the final round at Darlington Speedway. He beat out nine other drivers to win the seat in a Roush truck.\nIn 2006, Kluever was slated to race in six NASCAR Nextel Cup events in the No. 06 car during the season in preparation for a full season in 2007, beginning with the 2006 USG Sheetrock 400. However, David Ragan instead replaced the departing Mark Martin in the No. 6 AAA-sponsored Ford full-time in Nextel Cup in 2007.\n\nFor the 2006 season, Kluever moved to the Busch Series to drive the Roush Racing No. 06 3M Ford.

Admission to the school is based entirely on academic results through the Selective High Schools Test undertaken by students in Year 6.\n\nIn 2001, \"The Sun-Herald\" ranked North Sydney Girls High School first in Australia's top ten girls' schools, based on the number of its alumnae mentioned in the \"Who's Who in Australia\".\n\nNorth Sydney Girls' High School was officially founded in 1914 with an enrolment of 194 students. The school was originally located on the corner of Hazelbank Road and the Pacific Highway (where Cammeraygal High School is now situated). By the 1980s, it was felt that the site could no longer meet the needs of the school, and years of intense lobbying for improved facilities followed. When the New South Wales Government decided to close Crows Nest Boys High School, the facility was transferred to North Sydney Girls. In December 1993, North Sydney Girls High officially moved to its current location, following a $6 million building and renovations project.\n\nNorth Sydney Girls is an academically selective high school; admission to the school for Year 7 is determined by results in the Selective High Schools test, which is open to all Year 6 students in NSW. A small number of students from other high schools are accepted into years 8 to 12, with applications made to the school to sit for an entrance exam.\n\nAt North Sydney Girls High School, awards are given based on academic performance in the senior school only.\n\nThe school performs well in public examinations, and in recent years has been placed as the leading girls' school in New South Wales in the Higher School Certificate (HSC) examinations.

A three-time champion of the NASCAR Gander RV & Outdoors Truck Series (2013, 2014, 2019), he currently races full-time in the series, in which he drives the No. 88 Ford F-150 for ThorSport Racing.\n\nCrafton was born in Tulare, California. Before turning to NASCAR racing in 2000, he raced go-karts, midgets, and mini sprints. Crafton began his go-kart career at the age of seven after receiving a kart as a present for graduating from kindergarten. He won multiple national and regional championships before moving to midgets at the age of 15, winning twenty main events.\n\nHe joined the Featherlite Southwest Series as a substitute for his injured father, Danny Crafton, in 1996, filling in as driver of the No. 46 entry for the final three races of the season. Crafton took over the No. 46 full-time in 1997. His career went national when he became involved in the 1998 Winter Heat Series shown on ESPN at Tucson Raceway Park, during which he raced against other current NASCAR drivers Greg Biffle, Kevin Harvick, Kurt Busch, and Ron Hornaday.\n\nAfter four full-time seasons in the Featherlite Southwest Series, Crafton won the championship in 2000 on the strength of four wins that year. His success in the Featherlite Southwest Series that season led to the invitation to make his NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series debut for ThorSport Racing.\n\nCrafton made his Truck Series debut in 2000 at the season finale at California Speedway. Driving the PickupTruck.com Chevy for ThorSport Racing, he qualified 17th and finished ninth. In 2001, he piloted the No. 88 for ThorSport full-time with sponsorship from Fast Track Delivery Sealer and XE Sighting System. He had eleven top-tens and finished twelfth in the championship standings, third behind Ricky Hendrick and Travis Kvapil for Rookie of the Year. Menards first joined as an associate sponsor in 2002 and that season he earned six top-tens and finished fifteenth in points. Crafton earned 11 top 10s before finishing 11th in points in 2003.\n\nIn 2004, Crafton signed on to drive the No. 6 GM Goodwrench Silverado owned by Kevin Harvick Incorporated. He posted a best finish of third place in two races, and with six top fives and 17 top 10s, he ended the season fifth in the final standings. Despite strong statistics in 2004, he was released from KHI and returned to ThorSport for the 2005 season, where he won his first career pole at New Hampshire International Speedway, earning two top fives and 10 top 10s and finishing ninth in the standings. In 2006, he had four top-five finishes, 10 top-10 finishes and finished fourteenth in points. In 2007, he improved to eighth in points and posted ten top-ten finishes for the third consecutive season.\n\nCrafton's first NASCAR win came at Charlotte Motor Speedway on May 16, 2008, in the North Carolina Education Lottery 200. It was his 178th start, the record for most starts a driver has had before getting his first win in the Truck Series. The win moved him into the top five in points for 2008. Later that season, Crafton filled in for Robby Gordon in practice and qualifying for the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series event at Homestead because Gordon was at the final off-road race of the season.\n\nIn 2009, although he did not win a race that season, Crafton scored two poles (Chicagoland Speedway and Texas Motor Speedway), 11 top-five and 21 top-10 finishes, ultimately finishing second in the point standings behind champion Ron Hornaday. Crafton had another strong season in 2010, earning one pole at Texas Motor Speedway, 10 top-five and 20 top-10 finishes, resulting in a season-ending rank of fourth.\n2011 saw the second win of Crafton's career at Iowa Speedway, in addition to poles at Michigan International Speedway and Martinsville Speedway, where he broke the track qualifying record. However, four DNFs (Did Not Finish) due to engine failures, mechanical issues and accidents caused by other competitors led to only five top fives and 13 top 10s, ultimately relegating Crafton to eighth in the final standings. In 2012, after the team had moved from Chevrolet to Toyota, he had a decent season, finishing 6th in points.\n\n2013 was Crafton's best season in his career to date. He won his third career race at Kansas in April. After this win, Crafton picked up the points lead and held it for the rest of the season. He finished in the top ten in the first sixteen races of the season, and 19 overall, with a worst finish of 21st in the season finale at Homestead. He clinched his first Truck Series championship with his start in that race, and was able to stay on the lead lap despite late crash damage to become the first driver to complete every lap of the season in the Truck Series. He also made his Nationwide debut that year, running the No. 33 car for Richard Childress Racing, since the car was sponsored by Menards (which he drives in the Truck series). He ran both Kentucky races and Chicagoland in July. He performed well in all 3 races, finishing 3rd at both Kentucky races and 10th at Chicagoland.\n\nOn March 30, 2014, Crafton scored his fourth career Truck win at Martinsville. On June 6, he won on fuel strategy at Texas Motor Speedway to win two races in a season for the first time in his career. It was also the first time he led more than 100 laps in a race. Despite crashing out at Dover and Gateway, his first DNFs in over two years, Crafton would ultimately go on to become the first back-to-back champion in the Truck Series.\n\nOn February 28, 2015, Crafton scored his sixth career Truck victory in the revived Atlanta race. On May 8, he used fuel strategy to win at Kansas after multiple other top five Trucks ran out in the closing laps, winning a second race at one track for the first time in his career. He is also the first driver to win two Truck races at Kansas. On June 5, he won at Texas, successfully defending his win from the year before, another career first. His fourth win of the season came at Kentucky after the race was cut short due to damage to the catchfence from Ben Kennedy's crash. Crafton scored his fifth victory of the season at Martinsville on October 31, marking his second win at Martinsville, and the deepest into the season he had ever won a race to that point. He would add one more win in the season finale at Homestead-Miami, marking his first career victory from the pole; his season total of six wins are more than in his entire career prior to 2015. However, Crafton struggled more noticeably with consistency than in the previous two seasons. He crashed out at Gateway for the second year in a row after tangling with John Hunter Nemechek, and a few weeks later crashed out at Pocono after getting hit by Brad Keselowski. He would get swept up in a third wreck at Talladega with Stanton Barrett after being penalized for speeding on pit road, and while racing eventual series champion Erik Jones for the win at Phoenix would wreck out one final time, all of which eventually consigned him to third in points behind Jones and Tyler Reddick.\n\nOn May 13, 2016, Crafton scored his twelfth career Truck victory at Dover. Eight days later, he scored his second career victory at Charlotte, marking the first back-to-back victories in his career.\n\nIn the 2017 NextEra Energy Resources 250, while leading on the final lap, Crafton was caught in a late race incident and was clipped by Ben Rhodes; the contact turned his truck, sent it airborne into a flip, before landing on its wheels. On July 19, he scored his fourteenth career victory at Eldora. Despite finishing last of the final 4 drivers at Homestead, Crafton wound up with his 16th top-ten finish of 2017.\n\nFor the first time since 2012, Crafton went winless in 2018 with a season's best finish of 2nd at the fifth race of the season at Dover and went on to finish 6th in the final point standings despite being eliminated after the Round of 6.\n\nBecause of Crafton's sponsorship with Menards, he has made spot duty with Menards' Cup teams, including taking over for Paul Menard on occasion. Crafton was called in to substitute for Menard's No. 27 Richard Childress Racing Chevrolet twice in 2014; first at January Daytona testing after a pipe burst in Menard's house, and Crafton was third fastest with a speed of . In March, with Menard on paternity leave, he was on stand-by to relief drive for Paul Menard at Las Vegas Motor Speedway for the Kobalt 400, due to Menard and his wife expecting their first child. Crafton practiced and qualified for Menard at the Auto Club 400, qualifying 30th. At Talladega's 2019 1000Bulbs.com 500, he was on standby for Menard's No. 21 Wood Brothers Racing Ford while Menard was dealing with neck pain; Crafton practiced the car on Friday. Menard eventually ran the first stage before Crafton relieved him for the remainder of the race; he was involved in a multi-car wreck on lap 163 but finished 14th.\n\nIn 2014, he attempted to make his Cup Series debut with RAB Racing in the No. 29 at the Brickyard 400, but failed to qualify. Later in the year, he returned to the Childress Cup paddock, qualifying the No. 78 Furniture Row Racing Chevy at the Pure Michigan 400 in place of Martin Truex Jr., who was on leave as his girlfriend, Sherry Pollex, underwent cancer treatment.\n\nCrafton ran his first Cup race in the 2015 Daytona 500, substituting for Kyle Busch in the Joe Gibbs Racing No. 18 after Busch suffered a compound leg fracture in the previous day's Xfinity Series race. He finished 18th after starting 43rd. Over four years later, he made his second Cup start in the 2019 First Data 500 at Martinsville in the No. 36 of Front Row Motorsports after Matt Tifft was hospitalized with a health problem.\n\nOver the course of 11 full-time seasons in the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series, Crafton has reached several milestones and broken records, both individually and with his team:\n\n\n\nIn 2012, Crafton, supported by Travis Pastrana, competed in the series' PRO 2WD truck race at Chicagoland, finishing third. He returned to TORC in 2015, running in the Pro 4WD division in a Chris Kyle Memorial Benefit-sponsored truck at Texas. During the race, he was forced to operate the truck with a two-wheel drive due to problems with his truck's differential.\n\nCrafton raced in the 2014 and 2015 IWK 250 pro stock races at Riverside International Speedway in support of the IWK Health Centre in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Crafton sat on the pole for the 2014 edition of the race, and wound up finishing 10th, one lap down. In 2015 Crafton started third and quickly made his way to the front of the pack before retiring from the race with brake failure, ultimately finishing 21st.\n\nIn March 2019, Crafton participated in the Michelin Pilot Challenge sports car race at Sebring International Raceway, driving a Ford for Multimatic Motorsports alongside ThorSport Racing teammates Grant Enfinger, Ben Rhodes, and Myatt Snider.\n\n Season still in progress<br>\n\n"}

Ripe berries and cooked leaves of edible strains are used as food in some locales, and plant parts are used as a traditional medicine. A tendency exists in literature to incorrectly refer to many of the other \"black nightshade\" species as \"\"Solanum nigrum\"\".\n\n\"Solanum nigrum\" has been recorded from deposits of the Paleolithic and Mesolithic era of ancient Britain and it is suggested by the botanist and ecologist Edward Salisbury that it was part of the native flora there before Neolithic agriculture emerged. The species was mentioned by Pliny the Elder in the first century AD and by the great herbalists, including Dioscorides. In 1753, Carl Linnaeus described six varieties of \"Solanum nigrum\" in \"Species Plantarum\".\n\nBlack nightshade is a common herb or short-lived perennial shrub, found in many wooded areas, as well as disturbed habitats. It reaches a height of , leaves long and wide; ovate to heart-shaped, with wavy or large-toothed edges; both surfaces hairy or hairless; petiole long with a winged upper portion. The flowers have petals greenish to whitish, recurved when aged and surround prominent bright yellow anthers. The berry is mostly in diam., dull black or purple-black. In India, another strain is found with berries that turn red when ripe.\n\nSometimes \"S. nigrum\" is confused for the more toxic deadly nightshade (\"Atropa belladonna\"), which is in a different genus within Solanaceae. A comparison of the fruit shows that the black nightshade berries grow in bunches, whereas the deadly nightshade berries grow individually.\n\nThe suited soil pH value of black nightshade is between 5.5 and 6.5. It is rich in organic matter, water and fertility on the strong soil growth, in the lack of organic matter, poor ventilation clay, its roots will be stunted, plant growth is weak, commodity is poor. It is difficult to grow under the condition of high temperature and high humidity, the plant grows slowly, the tender shoot is easy to aging fiber, and the commodity is poor.\n\nThe \"S. nigrum\" species is a highly variable taxon with many varieties and forms described. The recognized subspecies are:\n\n1. \"S. nigrum\" L. subsp. \"nigrum\" — glabrous to slightly hairy with appressed non-glandular hairs\n2. \"S. nigrum\" L. subsp. \"schultesii\" (Opiz) Wessley — densely hairy with patent, glandular hairs\n\nThe Solanum nigrum\" complex — also known as Solanum\" L. section \"Solanum\" — is the group of black nightshade species characterized by their lack of prickles and stellate hairs, their white flowers, and their green or black fruits arranged in an umbelliform fashion. The \"Solanum\" species in this group can be taxonomically confused, more so by intermediate forms and hybridization between the species. Some of the major species within the \"S. nigrum\" complex are: \"S. nigrum\", \"S. americanum\", \"S. douglasii\", \"S. opacum\", \"S. ptychanthum\", \"S.retroflexum\", \"S. sarrachoides\", \"S. scabrum\", and \"S. villosum\".\n\nSolanine levels in \"S. nigrum\" can be toxic. Children have died from poisoning after eating unripe berries. However, the plant is rarely fatal, with ripe berries causing symptoms of mild abdominal pains, vomiting, and diarrhea.\n\nPoisoning symptoms are typically delayed for 6 to 12 hours after ingestion. Initial symptoms of toxicity include fever, sweating, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, confusion, and drowsiness. Death from ingesting large amounts of the plant results from cardiac arrhythmias and respiratory failure. Livestock have also been poisoned from nitrate toxicity by grazing the leaves of \"S. nigrum\". All kinds of animals can be poisoned after ingesting nightshade, including cattle, sheep, poultry, and swine. However, in central Spain, the great bustard (\"Otis tarda\") may act as a seed disperser of European black nightshade (\"Solanum nigrum\"). Black nightshade is highly variable, and poisonous plant experts advise to avoid eating the berries unless they are a known edible strain. The toxin levels may also be affected by the plant's growing conditions. The toxins in \"S. nigrum\" are most concentrated in the unripe green berries, and immature fruit should be treated as toxic. Most cases of suspected poisoning are due to consumption of leaves or unripe fruit.\n\nThere are ethnobotanical accounts of \"S. nigrum\" leaves and shoots being boiled as a vegetable with the cooking water being discarded and replaced several times to remove toxins.\n\nSome of the uses ascribed to \"S. nigrum\" in literature may actually apply to other black nightshade species within the same species complex, and proper species identification is essential for food and medicinal uses (See \"Taxonomy\" section).\n\n\"S. nigrum\" has been widely used as a food since early times, and the fruit was recorded as a famine food in 15th-century China. Despite toxicity issues with some forms, the ripe berries and boiled leaves of edible strains are eaten. The thoroughly boiled leaves — although strong and slightly bitter flavoureds — are used like spinach as horta and in fataya pies and quiches. The ripe black berries are described as sweet and salty, with hints of liquorice and melon.\n\nIn Kenya, among the Abagusii, \"S. nigrum\" (Rinagu- singular; Amanagu- plural) is a vegetable delicacy which when blanched and sauteed or boiled to soften and then salted or sauteed and eaten with Ugali (a corn meal product). In the rest of Kenya, \"S. nigrum\" (Managu) is eaten in a similar way.\n\nIn Tanzania, S. nigrum (mnafu or mnamvu in Kiswahili) is a popular green vegetable. Sautéed with chicken or pork, eaten with Ugali, it is both delicious and expensive meal in most restaurants in urban areas. Traditionally, the Iraqw people in northern Tanzania have used S. nigrum (manakw) as vegetable for generations, eaten with special ‘ugali’ (xwante), stiff porridge made with corn, millet or sorghum flour.\n\nIn India, the berries are casually grown and eaten, but not cultivated for commercial use. In South India, the leaves and berries are routinely consumed as food after cooking with tamarind, onion, and cumin seeds. The berries are referred to as \"fragrant tomato\". Although not very popular across much of its growing region, the fruit and dish are common in Tamil Nadu ( in Tamil), Kerala, southern Andhra Pradesh, and southern Karnataka.\n\nIn Ethiopia, the ripe berries are picked and eaten by children in normal times, while during famines, all affected people would eat berries. In addition, the leaves are collected by women and children, who cook the leaves in salty water and consume them like any other vegetable. Farmers in the Konso Special Woreda report that because \"S. nigrum\" matures before the maize is ready for harvesting, it is used as a food source until their crops are ready. The Welayta people in the nearby Wolayita Zone do not weed out \"S. nigrum\" that appears in their gardens since they likewise cook and eat the leaves.\n\nIn Ghana, they are called \"kwaansusuaa\", and are used in preparing various soups and stews, including the popular palm nut soup commonly eaten with \"banku\" or \"fufu'.\nIn South Africa, the very ripe and hand-selected fruit (\"nastergal\" in Afrikaans and \"umsobo\" in Zulu) is cooked into a beautiful but quite runny purple jam.\n\nIn Greece and Turkey, the leaves are called \"istifno\", and in Crete known as \"stifno\". They are one of the ingredients included in the salad of boiled greens known as \"horta\".\n\nIn Indonesia, the young fruits and leaves of cultivated forms are used and are known as \"ranti\" (Javanese) or \"leunca\" (Sundanese). The fruit and leaves are eaten raw as part of a traditional salad \"lalapan\", or the fruit is cooked (fried) with \"oncom\".\n\nIt was imported into Australia from Mauritius in the 1850s as a vegetable during the gold rush, but \"S. nigrum\" is now prohibited for trade as a food by the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code.\n\nDuring ancient times in Hawaii young shoots, leaves, small white flowers, and small black berries were eaten. The leaves, among other greens, were cooked by rolling hot stones among them in a covered gourd.\n\nThe plant has a long history of medicinal usage, dating back to ancient Greece. \"... In the fourteenth century, we hear of the plant under the name of Petty Morel being used for canker and with Horehound and wine taken for dropsy.\" It was a traditional European medicine used as a strong sudorific, analgesic and sedative with powerful narcotic properties, but was considered a \"somewhat dangerous remedy\". Internal use has fallen out of favor in Western herbalism due to its variable chemistry and toxicity, but it is used topically as a treatment for herpes zoster. There is much disagreement as to whether the leaves and fruit of \"S. nigrum\" are poisonous. But many countries grow this plant as a food crop. Some scientists have pointed out that the toxicity of \"S. nigrum\" can be determined by the region and species where it grows. Also,There are many studies that have proved that solanum, an alkaloid contained in solanum, is very important for human health, but it depends on the concentration and conditions in which they are used. Early studies have shown that it has anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties and is resistant to diseases caused by pathogenic bacteria, viruses, fungi and protozoa.\n\n\"S. nigrum\" is an important ingredient in traditional Indian medicines. Infusions are used in dysentery, stomach complaints, and fever. The juice of the plant is used on ulcers and other skin diseases. The fruits are used as a tonic, laxative, appetite stimulant, and for treating asthma and \"excessive thirst\". Traditionally the plant was used to treat tuberculosis. It is known as \"peddakasha pandla koora\" in the Telangana region. This plant's leaves are used to treat mouth ulcers that happen during winter periods of Tamil Nadu, India. It is known as \"manathakkali keerai\" (மணத்தக்காளி கீரை)in Tamil Nadu and \"kaage soppu\" in Karnataka, and apart from its use as a home remedy for mouth ulcers, is used in cooking like spinach. In North India, the boiled extracts of leaves and berries are also used to alleviate liver-related ailments, including jaundice. In Assam, the juice from its roots is used against asthma and whooping cough.\n\n\"S. nigrum\" is a widely used plant in oriental medicine where it is considered to be antitumorigenic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective, diuretic, and antipyretic.\n\nA Solanum species of the \"S. nigrum\" group from the Los Lagos Region of southern Chile with the common name \"hierba mora\" is used in local folk medicine as an antidote to the anticholinergic poisoning caused by the dangerous hallucinogenic plant \"Latua pubiflora\". It is used by the shamans of the indigenous Huilliche people when they need to 'sober up' quickly from \"Latua\" intoxication.\n\nSome experiments indicate that the plant inhibits growth of cervical carcinoma in mice. The active ingredient of the plant, solanine, inhibits the proliferation of different cancer cells in vitro, such as breast cancer and pancreatic cancer.Its anti-tumor mechanism is mainly through the induction of different cell and molecular pathways, leading to apoptosis and autophagy of cells and molecules, and inhibiting tumor metastasis.\n\n\"Solanum nigrum\" is known to contain solasodine (a steroidal glycoalkaloid that can be used to make 16-DPA progenitor); a possible commercial source could be via cultivating the hairy roots of this plant.\n\nIt is also a treatment of gastric ulcer. Through experiments on mice gastric ulcer model and control group, the results showed that the extract of black nightshade powder and methanol could significantly affect the secretion of gastric acid and protease in mice, thus significantly reducing the gastric ulcer index of mice.\n\nBlack nightshade is cultivated as a food crop on several continents, including Africa and North America. The leaves of cultivated strains are eaten after cooking. A garden form with fruit diam. is occasionally cultivated.\n\nSelect fertile, loose and easy to drain and irrigate strong seedlings. Use the plots of the previous crops that have not planted fruit and vegetables as seedbed. Dig deep and make a seedling bed with a width of 1m and a height of 15 cm with a fine rake.Before sowing, fill the seedbed with water, mix the seeds with fine sand and mix them evenly. Sow them sparsely to cultivate strong seedlings. Cover soil 0.5 cm after sowing.In winter and spring, seedlings should be raised in the small arch. In summer and autumn, seedlings can be raised in the small arch covered with sunshade net.When the seedlings 3-4 true leaves, thinning the growth potential of the weak seedlings, and timely weeding.\n\nBlack nightshade can be a serious agricultural weed when it competes with crops. It has been reported as a weed in 61 countries and 37 crops. Herbicides are used extensively to control it in field crops such as cotton.\n\n"}
{"id": "2187432", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2187432", "title": "I Believe in You (Kylie Minogue song)", "text": "I Believe in You (Kylie Minogue song)\n\n\"I Believe in You\" is a song recorded by Australian singer Kylie Minogue for her ninth greatest hits compilation, \"Ultimate Kylie\" (2004). It was written by Minogue and Scissor Sisters members Jake Shears and Babydaddy and produced by Shears and Babydaddy. It was released as the lead single from \"Ultimate Kylie\" on 6 December 2004, by Parlophone. \"I Believe in You\" is a pop and Euro disco song in which Minogue proclaims there are many things in which she does not believe, but that she does believe in her lover.\n\n\"I Believe in You\" received positive reviews from music critics. Commercially the song was also successful, reaching the top of the charts in Portugal and Romania, number two in the United Kingdom and at number six in Australia. The song became a dance club hit in the United States, peaking at number three on the \"Billboard\" Hot Dance Club Play chart in 2005 and earning a nomination for a 2006 Grammy Award in the \"Best Dance Recording\" category.\n\nIn August 2004, it was announced that Minogue would be recording new tracks, rumored to be some kind of Christmas material. The month after, it was announced that the artist would be releasing a greatest hits album, titled \"Ultimate Kylie\", containing two new tracks, being \"I Believe in You\" and \"Giving You Up\"; Jake Shears and Babydaddy were in charge of the production of the former, whilst the latter was produced by Brian Higgins and Xenomania. A separate compilation DVD with the same name, containing several music videos by the singer, was also released to coincide with the distribution of the album. In the same statement, it was announced that \"I Believe in You\" would be the lead single from the compilation.\n\nMinogue's collaboration with Shears and Babydaddy was seen as unlikely by many, including the singer herself. \"When the idea of working together came up I thought, 'well, I love their album but that is not the music I make'. However, we got on immediately; we were on the same wavelength\", she said. However, the pair agreed to work with Minogue after discovering they were both huge fans of each other's music. Shears said they \"gelled\" whilst in the studio, elaborating that the experience \"has been really surreal and cool. I was so anxious beforehand, I had jet lag and just wanted to make something good and we've had a fantastic time. Actually we're really collaborating and it went really well and I'm happy because I think she had a really good time. I think we made some really good stuff. We just got down to business. We were down there (in the studio) for long days so I feel like we got to know each other quite a bit which was pretty fun\".\n\n\"I Believe in You\" is a pop and Euro disco song, which features the use of synthesizers and keyboards. The lyrics of the song, co-written by Minogue, describe how she does not believe in anything except her lover, although the song details of a spirit the speaker believes in hence the lyrics \"I don't believe that when you die your presence isn't felt.\" Written and recorded for \"Ultimate Kylie\" during the summer of 2004 in London, the song takes its inspiration from disco and 80s new wave electropop music, and has been described as similar to 80s-era New Order.\n\nThe song opens with a keyboard playing the choral melody. This melody is maintained throughout the song, except for occasional pauses for Minogue's verses. As the song continues, drums and synth strings are added into the background, which continue through the whole song. The refrain features Minogue singing a high octave chorus with strings and a thumping beat in the background. \"I love it. It does everything it's meant to do and then some\", Minogue said about the song.\n\n\"I Believe in You\" received a positive response from many music critics. A review by Mark Edwards from \"Stylus Magazine\" called the song \"a masterpiece\" and \"a fabulous return to form\" from her previous album, \"Body Language\", which was not well reviewed by some music critics. Joey Rivaldo, in a review for About.com, said the song was \"perfect for radio\" and praised it for its \"nice laid back pop sound.\" Rivaldo also said that \"although it has taken a while for many to catch on to this tune, looking back, many say it was well worth the wait.\" In his review, Rivaldo gave the song three out of five stars. In another review for About.com, Jason Shawahn called the song \"one of the finest eurodisco confections to come down the pike since the glory days\". Virgin.net called the song a \"rather demure and stylish collaboration\" with Jake Shears and Babbydaddy, and said that \"while it may all lack any really enticing hooks (or particularly interesting lyrics), it's still quite an enchanting record\" due to its \"pulsing analogue bassline and kick drum combo.\"\n\nThe song was nominated for an ARIA Award in Australia for \"Best Pop Release\" in 2005, and Minogue garnered a nomination for \"Best Female Artist\", providing her with an ARIA Award nomination for the eighth consecutive year. The song was also nominated for a 2006 Grammy Award in the \"Best Dance Recording\" category, providing Minogue with a Grammy nomination in that category for the fourth consecutive year.\n\n\"I Believe in You\" debuted on radio on 14 October 2004, and was released on 6 December 2004 in the United Kingdom and debuted and peaked at number two on the UK singles chart, outsold in its first week of sale by the charity single \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\" by Band Aid 20. It remained in the top ten for four weeks, but it spent six weeks at number one on the airplay chart, and seventeen weeks on the chart in total. As March 2014, it sold 150,000 copies in the UK. In Australia, the single peaked at number six, and was certified gold in 2005. In most European countries, the song was a top ten hit on both the singles and airplay charts. In France, the song made a poor chart showing, which was mainly due to the fact that the single was not made commercially available until the following year, and at the time of its initial release, could only be purchased as an import single.\n\nIn the United States, the single did not chart on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, but did peak at number three on the \"Billboard\" Hot Dance Club Play chart and number four on the \"Billboard\" Hot Dance Airplay chart. The single returned Minogue to popularity in the American dance market (her last single, \"Chocolate\", did not chart on any \"Billboard\" issues). However, the song did not gain popularity outside of the dance music market. In New Zealand, it debuted at number 38, then after two weeks, it peaked at number 29, but dropped out after five weeks.\n\nThe accompanying music video for \"I Believe in You\" was directed by Vernie Yeung and choreographed by Rafael Bonachela. The premise of the futuristic video involved Minogue performing different scenarios within a studio filled with colourful neon lights. The clip opens with Minogue standing in the centre of a large \"sphere\" enclosed by neon lights as it revolves around her. Upon reaching the second verse, a new sphere, with a new set of lights, is added around Minogue, as she wears a new costume and glitter around her eyes. These notable high-end visual effects were done by Soho-based company The Mill, who were responsible for enhancing the light bars on these spheres, as well as adding a new light with each new sphere introduced. The video progresses to Minogue dancing before a psychedelic flash of swirling colours, before resolving to a black background lit up by a troupe of dancers wearing \"glow effects\". It was revealed that these multi-coloured light bulbs were actually attached to the bodies of the dancers, who had to carry their power sources around in makeshift \"shopping\" bags for the duration of the shoot. As the video concludes, these four sequences are then intercut amongst each other until they gradually fade out.\n\nCostumes for the video were designed by Dolce & Gabbana, and consisted of a series of dresses which Minogue described as \"floaty\", including a dress of purple silk chiffon with gold mesh fabric bra-top and girdle, worn with gold metallic shoes made by Chloé. They were then donated to the Arts Centre Melbourne (displayed in the Kylie Minogue Collection) by Kylie herself in 2006.\n\nReleased to music video channels in November 2004, the video was a hit, charting at number one for three weeks on MTV \"Euro Top 20\" countdown and at number two on the UK TV airplay chart. The complete version of \"I Believe in You\" featured in the music video has been released commercially through CD singles and digital downloads, and some include remixes by Mylo and Skylark. The video was released commercially on the \"Ultimate Kylie\" companion DVD, released in December 2004.\n\nThree official remixes were commissioned to promote the song. Mylo created two remixes, the Mylo Vocal and the Mylo Dub, which use the song's original vocals over a new bassline constructed with synthesizers and some electric guitar. The remixes received positive reviews from music critics. About.com stated that the remix provides the song with an \"electro trip\", commenting that it is \"the perfect mix for all the Mixshow DJs out there.\" Skylark's mix features a kick beat and according to About.com is \"more geared toward the clubs\" as it is more \"underground\" than Mylo's remixes.\n\nAll three remixes were included on the CD single and offered through downloads in December 2004. The remixes achieved chart success in Brazil, where they reached number one on the dance music chart, and in the United States. A radically different version of the song was crafted in 2007 for \"The Kylie Show\", a one-off television program that aired on UK's ITV on 10 November 2007 as a marketing vehicle for her tenth studio album \"X\". The new version changed the song from an up-tempo electronic song into a torch song. This version was also performed by Minogue during her KylieX2008 concert world tour.\n\n\"B.P.M.\" was released as the B-side to the commercial single release of \"I Believe in You\". The song was produced by Richard Stannard, and Julian Gallagher (collectively known as \"BiffCo\"), and was written by Minogue, Stannard and Gallagher. The song had gone through many incarnations; it began as an instrumental track written by Stannard and Gallagher titled \"Sunset River\", and when the two began working with Minogue, lyrics were added and changes were made to the music. Originally recorded during the \"Body Language\" album sessions in 2003, the song was not released until the release of \"Ultimate Kylie\" a year later. \"B.P.M.\" was one of the many songs that were considered to be added to the album as a new track, but was released as a B-side to \"I Believe in You\" instead.\n\nIn order to promote \"Ultimate Kylie\" and the single, Minogue performed \"I Believe in You\" in shows such as \"Top of the Pops\", , \"Top of the Pops Saturday\", Premios Ondas, \"Star Academy\", \"\", \"Today with Des and Mel\", and \"Wetten, dass..?\".\n\nThe song was included on the 2005 . Minogue was unable to complete the tour as she was diagnosed with early breast cancer and had to cancel the Australian leg of the tour. After undergoing treatment and recovery, she resumed the concert tour in the form of in 2006, and \"I Believe in You\" was again added to the set list.\n\nShe performed a ballad version, described as orchestral, of the song on her KylieX2008 and was described as a blue train by newspapers. This song was performed as part of all four set orders in the act entitled \"Starry Nights\" (or \"Beach Party\" in the case of one leg). She performed the same version on her For You, for Me tour in 2009 in the fifth act, following performances of \"White Diamond\" and \"Confide in Me\". Minogue performed the song again in 2011 on her , where there is slight remixing. It was performed in the second act following a performance of \"Illusion\". She is pulled round the stage on a chariot by her male dancers who are dressed to resemble horses. She most recently performed the song on her Golden Tour, replacing \"Breathe\".\n\nMinogue also performed the song as a ballad on \"Star Academy\" with Quentin Mosimann, and \"The Kylie Show\" TV special. In 2012, she performed \"The Abbey Road Sessions\" version of the song on BBC Proms in the Park.\n\nThese are the formats and track listings of major single releases of \"I Believe in You\".\n\n\n\n\nThe following people contributed to \"I Believe in You\":\n\n\n\n"}

He is the father of former NASCAR driver Ronnie Hornaday, and son of the late Ron Hornaday Sr., a two-time Winston West Champion. Hornaday is a four-time champion in the Camping World Truck Series, his most recent coming in 2009. He was a long-time driver in NASCAR's Winston West Series, and is a Featherlite Southwest Tour Champion. He was noticed by Dale Earnhardt while participating in the NASCAR Winter Heat on TNN.\n\nHornaday was born in Palmdale, California, and began racing in go-karts and motorcycles early in his career. Eventually, he moved up to race stock cars at Saugus Speedway. In 1992, he won his first championship in the Southwest Series as well as winning the Most Popular Driver award. He won the Southwest championship the next year as well, becoming the only driver to do so in series history until Jim Pettit won back to back titles in 2004-2005. Pettit won the title again in 2011 in the SRL Southwest Tour Series.\n\nHe made his Winston Cup debut in 1992 at the Save Mart 300K, where he started seventeenth but finished 32nd in Bob Fisher's No. 92 Chevrolet. He made another start later that year at Phoenix International Raceway, where he finished 25th. He ran at Phoenix the next year as well, finishing 22nd in the No. 76 Spears Motorsports car.\n\nHornaday signed to drive the No. 16 RCCA Products/Papa John's Pizza-sponsored Chevrolet C/K owned by Dale Earnhardt, Inc. for the then-start-up Super Truck Series. In the first season of competition, Hornaday won six races and four poles on his way to a third-place points finish. The next year, with sponsorship from NAPA Auto Parts, Hornaday won four races and the series championship.\n\nIn 1997, despite seven wins, two of which came by leading every lap in the race, he finished fifth in points. He was able to reclaim his title in 1998 by garnering six wins and 16 top fives out of 27 races. At Memphis 200 he celebrated with a burnout, which was unusual at the time, and made team owner Dale Earnhardt angry for risking damaging the powertrain.\n\nAlso in 1998, Hornaday made his Busch Series debut, driving four races for ST Motorsports, his best finish an eighth at Pikes Peak International Raceway. He also debuted a Winston Cup car for Tim Beverly at Sonoma, finishing fourteenth in the No. 17 NAPA-sponsored Chevy. Hornaday came close to a truck victory at Watkins Glen in the 1998 Parts America 150 in which he led all but 12 laps, only to lose the race due to a final-lap penalty for jumping the restart; Hornaday would pull into victory lane post-race only to be told that he had in fact finished fourth.\n\nIn 1999, he won the 100th race ran in NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series history at the Evergreen Speedway in Monroe, Washington. He was one of four drivers entered in the race that competed in every truck race since its inception at the time for an extra $100,000 if he won, which he did. However, he was unable to capitalize on it and win the championship, finishing seventh in the final standings after an up and down year. Fortunately, he was given an opportunity late in the year to replace Dale Earnhardt Jr. in driving the No. 3 NAPA-sponsored Chevy for DEI's Busch program with Earnhardt moving up to the cup series, and he announced that he would do so the following year.\n\nHornaday began racing full-time in the Busch Series in 2000. He picked up wins at Nazareth Speedway and Indianapolis Raceway Park and finished fifth in points, runner-up to Kevin Harvick for Rookie of the Year honors. He was also voted Most Popular Driver. However, Earnhardt elected to move Hornaday's team up to the Cup series in 2001 and hire Michael Waltrip to drive the car, and Hornaday was released.\n\nHornaday signed with A.J. Foyt Racing in the Cup series, driving the No. 14 Conseco-sponsored Pontiac Grand Prix. Despite posting a ninth-place finish at Las Vegas, Hornaday struggled throughout the year and finished 38th in points with just two Top 20 finishes and four DNQ’s in the second half of the season. Hornaday later criticized Foyt for dismissing him so late in the season, although Foyt unsuccessfully offered Hornaday a Cup Series return in mid-2002. During the 2001 season, Hornaday returned to the Busch Series on a part-time basis, running the No. 11 for HighLine Performance Group before finishing out the year with The Curb Agajanian Performance Group, posting three Top 10’s.\n\nIn 2002, he drove for Hendrick Motorsports' truck team at the season-opening Florida Dodge Dealers 250, where he finished 12th. After Hendrick closed the doors to its truck team, Hornaday moved to their Busch program, filling in for an injured Ricky Hendrick in the No. 5 GMAC-sponsored Chevy, his best finish 15th at Darlington Raceway. A few races later, he replaced Lyndon Amick in the No. 26 Dr Pepper-sponsored car for Carroll Racing. He had eight Top 10s and a pole, finishing 18th in points despite only running 30 of the 36 races. He also capped the season off with a win in the truck series at Homestead-Miami Speedway, driving for Xpress Motorsports.\n\nIn 2003, Hornaday signed to drive the No. 2 ACDelco-sponsored Chevy for Richard Childress Racing. He won at Nazareth and posted 17 Top 10s, finishing third in points. He followed that up with a win at The Milwaukee Mile and a fourth-place points finish the following season.\n\nAt the end of 2004, Hornaday was released in favor of Clint Bowyer, and he returned to the Truck Series. He reunited with a long-time best friend of his, Kevin Harvick, and signed to drive the No. 6 GM Goodwrench-sponsored Chevy for Kevin Harvick Incorporated. Hornaday soon picked up a win at Atlanta Motor Speedway and finished fifth in points. In 2006, the team lost its Goodwrench sponsorship and switched to the No. 33 to yield the No. 6 to Mark Martin's Roush Racing effort. Running unsponsored for most of the year, Hornaday picked up two victories this year at Mansfield and Kentucky He also has two Top 10s in five Busch Series starts that year.\n\nWith sponsorship backing from Camping World, he continued his dominance in the Truck Series in 2007, winning races at two tracks for the first time in his career. He took the checkers at Lowe's in the Quaker Steak & Lube 200. Two weeks later, after a what-should-have-been-a-win-weekend at Mansfield, Hornaday outlasted Kyle Busch to win the AAA Insurance 200 at Dover. He continued his chase for a third title with a victory at O'Reilly Raceway Park in the Power Stroke Diesel 200, his 17th win on a short track.\n\nOn November 16, 2007 Hornaday won his third NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series Championship by overcoming a 29-point deficit on Mike Skinner.\n\nOn September 10, 2008, ESPN's Shaun Assael reported Hornaday admitted to using testosterone cream. He used it to treat Graves' disease. On December 21, 2008, Hornaday's father Ron Hornaday Sr., died due to cancer.\n\nOn June 20, 2009, Hornaday won the Copart 200 at the Milwaukee Mile on his 51st birthday. He is one of the few racing drivers to win a race on his birthday. On July 24, 2009, Hornaday became the first Camping World Truck Series driver to win four races in a row by winning at O'Reilly Raceway Park. On August 1, 2009, he won the Toyota Tundra 200 at Nashville Superspeedway, tying Richard Petty and Bobby Allison as the only drivers to win five consecutive races in their NASCAR careers.\nOn November 13, 2009, he won his fourth Camping World Truck Series championship, joining Jeff Gordon, Richard Petty, Dale Earnhardt, and Jimmie Johnson as the only drivers to win 4 or more titles in the three major series of NASCAR. He also became the first driver since Greg Biffle in 2000 to clinch the title before the last race of the season.\n\nFor the final three races of the 2010 Sprint Cup season, Stewart-Haas Racing hired Hornaday as a standby driver should expectant father Ryan Newman have to leave the track. Newman became a father on November 18, 2010, three days before the season finale.\n\nIn 2011, Hornaday was second in the series being 15 points behind Austin Dillon when he reached the penultimate race of the year at Texas. There Hornaday raced behind rival Kyle Busch and reached second place. When Hornaday passed by Busch on lap 13, he made contact with Busch to avoid a slowing truck of Johnny Chapman and in the next turn under a caution, Busch intentionally slammed into Hornaday pushing him head-on into the wall. Hornaday was mathematically eliminated from contention for the Truck title. Busch received suspension from the NNS and NSCS race that weekend as a result. Hornaday later said that after hearing Busch's arrogance after the incident, he was going to settle matters with Busch at the end of the race, but was restrained and instead had a phone call with Busch a couple days after that sizzled things down.\n\nDuring the 2011 season, it was announced that Hornaday would drive for Joe Denette Motorsports for the 2012 season in the No. 9 Anderson's Maple Syrup Chevrolet.\n\nBefore the 2013 season, Hornaday returned to JDM, now NTS Motorsports, to drive the No. 9 truck. Hornaday started off on a high note in his finishes with a few top tens in the first few races. In the third race of the season at Rockingham Speedway, Hornaday intentionally wrecked rookie Darrell Wallace Jr. under caution to retaliate for prior contact. He was penalized during the race to restart in 37th spot. For his actions, Hornaday was fined $25,000, lost 25 points and was placed on probation by NASCAR until June 12. The penalty dropped him from 4th to 15th in the Truck Series standings.\n\nWith one race remaining in the season, Hornaday was released from the No. 9 truck by NTS Motorsports; in the season finale he drove a sixth truck for Turner Scott Motorsports, finishing fifth. He started the 2014 season once again driving for TSM in the No. 30 truck at Daytona International Speedway, with former KHI sponsor Rheem backing the team. Due to an internal dispute within TSM, Hornaday did not race at Canadian Tire Motorsport Park, after it was initially reported that all three truck teams would shut down. \n\nTwo days later on September 2, Hornaday was released and Turner Scott Motorsports dissolved the 30 team, with owners Steve Turner and Harry Scott Jr. in the process of filing lawsuits against each other. Hornaday was 4th in points prior to the Canada race, and still 6th in points when he was released. On September 13, it was announced that Rheem would partner again with Hornaday at Las Vegas and Texas later that year with NTS Motorsports, the team that had released him in 2013. He missed 6 races late in the season and was 14th in points at the season's end.\n\nOn January 21, 2015, Curtis Key's The Motorsports Group announced that Hornaday would be their primary driver for 2015, running the No. 30 Chevy in the Sprint Cup Series. It marked Hornaday's first return to the Cup Series since 2003. The primary sponsor was announced as Hornaday's Truck sponsor, Smokey Mountain Herbal Snuff.\n\nIn his first attempt, Hornaday failed to qualify for the Daytona 500 after posting the slowest time in qualifying and then lacking the necessary speed to stay in the draft in his Budweiser Duel race. In his second attempt, Hornaday qualified and made his first race in 12 years. Hornaday finished 42nd due to his rear gear breaking. His team skipped the next three races in the West Coast swing to prepare for Martinsville. He did not qualify after wrecking his car during qualifying. After Hornaday once again failed to qualify at Bristol, he and the team parted ways.\n\nOn his brief return to Sprint Cup competition and his sudden retirement, Hornaday said in a 2016 interview, \"\"That was helping a team get started and all that stuff. It didn’t seem to work out. I was always the guy, I told my wife that I’m not going to go out there and ride around just for a paycheck. If I wasn’t competitive I wasn’t going to do it. That (opportunity) didn’t work out. But I’ve got a lot of opportunities. People call me and say, ‘Hey, do you want to drive Martinsville?’ I said ‘Yeah, I’d love to.’ And they’d say, ‘Well, how much money can you bring?’ That ain’t racing to me anymore so…it’s back to dirt racing and having fun.”\"\n\nHornaday has not raced in NASCAR since. He is currently a dirt modified chassis builder, owning Hornaday Race Cars.\n\nApril 8, 2010 was declared \"Ron Hornaday Jr. Day\" in Palmdale, Hornaday's hometown. A roundabout in the Palmdale Auto Mall was also named after Hornaday on April 8. On May 24, 2017, Hornaday was named in the NASCAR Hall of Fame Class of 2018, becoming the first Truck Series driver to earn this honor.\n\nBefore his racing career took off, Hornaday worked at a couple transmission shops and his father's car dealership. He got married at age 20. During his time racing for Kevin Harvick Inc. in the Truck Series, Hornaday was diagnosed with Graves' disease.\n\n Season still in progress<br>\n\n"}

In the US the album sold 93,000 copies.\n\nProduction on \"Dangerous and Moving\" spanned from Los Angeles to London and Moscow. There were two notable recording sessions with the record's producer, Sergio Galoyan. The first took place in Moscow between 4 and 20 August 2004 with just Lena, producing songs like \"Cosmos\", \"Sacrifice\" (one demo featuring Claire Guy) and demos \"All My Love\" (an English counterpart to \"Вся моя любовь\"), \"I Know\", \"One Love\" and \"You\". The second recording session took place from 17 January to 18 April 2005 in Los Angeles with \"Sacrifice\", \"Perfect Enemy\" and the demo of \"We Shout\" (titled \"Reach Out\") also sung by Lena. Yulia was not present during the recording sessions due to her pregnancy.\n\nOther demo versions of the songs are available online, such as \"All About Us\" (performed by The Veronicas), \"Sacrifice\" (with both Yulia and Lena), \"Perfect Enemy\" (recorded by Claire Guy and sometimes referred to as \"Wrap It Up\"), and \"Обезьянка ноль\".\n\nAlthough Sting, Dave Stewart, Richard Carpenter, The Veronicas and Claire Guy did work on the album, they did not actually meet the girls for production. Sergio Galoyan became a liaison for the production. However, Richard Carpenter did meet the girls after the recording of the album at their video shoot for the single Friend or Foe. The video was shot on location at Bronson Cave in Hollywood, directed by James Cox, while the executive producer was Grant Cihlar for 1171 Production Group. According to the booklet, the album was recorded at eight different recording studios. The album cover photography and design was made by their own music group, TA Music.\n\nThere are only two shared tracks between both releases:\n\nFive tracks are Russian/English counterparts:\n\nOn this album, \"Loves Me Not\" has different music than the version on the Russian album counterpart Люди-инвалиды. This is not a remix—it is the same single featuring a more pop arrangement for the international market versus a more electronic arrangement for the Russian market. An English version of \"Вся моя любовь\" was never officially released despite the demo recording. The girls sing an extra verse in \"Cosmos (Outer Space)\" after the second chorus; in \"Космос\", this is an instrumental break with no lyrics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was the foremost economist of the right-wing National Democracy political camp and creator of its economic program.\n\nRybarski studied at the Law School of the Jagiellonian University in Kraków from 1906 to 1911. During the studies, he was a member of the secret Association of the Polish Youth \"Zet\". In 1910 he joined the National League, a secret Polish right-wing organization. Rybarski was professor at the Jagiellonian University from 1917 until 1920, from 1921 until 1923 at the Warsaw University of Technology and from 1924 at the Warsaw University.\n\nIn 1919 he took part in the Paris Peace Conference as an economic expert of the Polish delegation. Rybarski was one of the leading persons in the Camp of Great Poland. In 1928 he co-founded the National Party. From 1928 until 1935 he was a member of the Sejm, where he was one of the leading figures of the party. As one of the foremost persons in the \"old faction\" of the National Democracy, Rybarski advocated the parliamentary democracy.\n\nIn 1928, he authored a study in which he stressed the \"harmful impact\" of Jews on the economy and urban development. His 1931 newspaper article titled \"Jewish Policy\" marked the start of an Endek offensive against Jews. In the article Rybarski attacked the government, asserting that the Jews were responsible for the government's economic policy and by extension Polish suffering.\n\nAfter the German invasion of Poland in 1939, Rybarski worked in the Polish underground, being in the Political Council of the Service for Poland's Victory. He held several other positions in the Polish underground state during World War II. On 17 May 1941 he was arrested by Nazi German authorities and incarcerated in the Pawiak prison. He was later transferred to the Nazi German Auschwitz concentration camp and eventually executed there for organizing the resistance movement in the camp.\n\nIn terms of economic thought, Rybarski was a fierce supporter of a laissez-faire to the economy. He advocated for stability of property rights and economic institutions, and low taxes. Compulsory social security, monopolies and government granted concessions to businesses were not desirable, according to his view.\n\n\n\n"}

It was just over one mile long (1.82 km) and it was lock free. It terminated at Fenny Fields Bridge, Bardsley, which is situated in the Medlock Valley between Ashton-under-Lyne and Oldham.\n\nAlthough this canal was mainly rural, its main purpose was to carry coal so there was a loading stage for coal and a short private branch for the same purpose. There was also a mill.\n\nImmediately north east of the terminus at Fenny Fields Bridge an industrial community was founded at Park Bridge and a tramway, which included a small-bore tunnel long, connected the two together. This community was founded in 1783 by Samuel Lees to make rollers for the textile industry. This community expanded rapidly as the demand for textile machinery increased. Following the premature death of Samuel in 1804 the factory was successfully run by his widow Hannah Lees née Buckley and in later years the company was renamed Hannah Lees & Sons in her honour. The last part of this works closed in 1963 due to the decline in the textile industry.\n\nAround 1800, water was being supplied to this canal by \"Fairbottom Bobs\", a Newcomen engine working for mine drainage.\n\nAt first, waggon haulage on the tramway was by means of horses but early in the 1840s a steam locomotive called ‘The Ashtonian’ replaced them. Because of the narrow-bore tunnel, the driver needed to be of short stature and even then he had to kneel down to pass through the tunnel. The locomotive’s funnel also had to be removed. This tramway remained operational into the 1880s.\n\nIn the early 1930s two leakages occurred that made it necessary to lower the water level in the canal and this, coupled with mining subsidence, caused its unofficial closure in 1932. By 1948 the canal was completely unnavigable but it did remain in water.\n\nMuch of the line of the former canal remained intact and there are now plans to re-open part of it again as an amenity canal along with much of the Hollinwood Branch Canal.\n\n\n"}

He has driven in all three of NASCAR's top series, scoring eighteen wins in the Camping World Truck Series.\n\nSetzer made his NASCAR debut in the Busch Series in 1991 in the All Pro 300. He started 5th in his own #4 Ford Thunderbird, but crashed on lap nine and finished 40th. He ran another race the following year, at Hickory Motor Speedway in a car owned by Bill Davis. He wrecked in that race as well but still managed to finish 26th. In 1993, he ran four races for Daniel Welch, and had a top-ten run in the Advance Auto Parts 500. He was also a notable competitor in the Sportsman Division.\n\nSetzer made his first full-time run in 1994, driving the No. 59 Alliance Training Centers-sponsored Chevrolet for Welch once again. Setzer won in his 23rd career start at South Boston Speedway, then won again two races later at Hickory Motor Speedway. By the end of the year, he was ninth in points and was runner-up to Johnny Benson for Rookie of the Year. In 1995, the team switched to Fords; Setzer struggled in the adjustment. After he won the pole at the Milwaukee Mile, he was released from the ride, and spent the rest of the season making fill-in starts. At the same time, he began running part-time in the newly formed Craftsman Truck Series. He finished second in his debut at Milwaukee, along with seven other starts that year.\n\nIn 1996, he signed to drive the No. 38 Lipton Tea-sponsored Ford for Akins-Sutton Motorsports. Despite two Top 10 finishes, he was released from the ride, and spent he rest of the year driving the Mark III Financial car. He started the 1997 season in that ride, but was released after five races, and spent the rest of the season in the No. 43 Lance Snacks-sponsored Chevy owned by David Ridling, posting four Top 10’s and finishing 19th in points.\n\nAfter 1997, Setzer did not have a ride for 1998. He started the season doing work for Gloy-Rahal Motorsports in the Trucks, but only for a handful of races. After three DNF's in the Busch Series, Setzer was selected by K Automotive Racing to replace driver/team owner Bob Keselowski, who had been injured in a wreck. Setzer had eighth-place finishes in the truck while filling in. After that, he signed with Bill Elliott Racing, replacing Jerry Nadeau for eight races. His best finish in seven starts (he DNQ'd at Dover) was 19th at Talladega Superspeedway. After a brief hiatus from the trucks, Setzer returned to K Automotive to finish the season, and collected a win at Mesa Marin Raceway.\n\nIn 1999, K Automotive provided Setzer with a full-time ride in the #1 Mopar-sponsored Dodge Ram. Setzer won three races and was in the thick of the championship hunt, but an early wreck at the season finale at California Speedway took him out of the running. Nevertheless, he was named the series' Most Popular Driver for 1999. His performance slipped in 2000, as he won just one race and dropped to seventh in points. After that season, he left the team.\n\nIn 2001, Setzer joined Morgan-Dollar Motorsports. In his first year with the team he won two poles, one race, and finished ninth in points. After another quiet year in 2002, things started improving, as Setzer won three races in 2003. Setzer went on a tear, finishing a career-best second in the point standings for three seasons in a row (2003, 2004, & 2005). After failing to win a race in 2006, he departed Morgan Dollar to join Spears Motorsports. In 2007, Setzer won the City of Mansfield 250 at Mansfield Motorsports Speedway after running the entire 250 lap race without a pitstop. The Mansfield victory was his first victory in 41 races, his last coming in the Power Stroke Diesel 200 at O'Reilly Raceway Park on August 1, 2005. \n\nLate in the 2007 season, he parted ways with Spears and raced at New Hampshire for Green Light Racing, and at Las Vegas for Bobby Hamilton Racing. He drove the #18 Dodge Ram Truck to a victory in the 2008 Kroger 250 at Martinsville. It was Setzer's 18th career win, and BHR's first win since Bobby Hamilton Sr. won in Martinsville in 2005. Furthermore, it was the final win for the Dodge nameplate in the Truck Series before they pulled out of NASCAR following 2012. After BHR shut down at the end of 2008, Setzer found himself out of a job entering the season.\n\nSetzer began the 2009 Truck Series season driving one race apiece for GunBroker Racing and Fast Track Racing Enterprises, before being named the driver for MRD Motorsports. He had two second-place finishes and was in the Top 10 in points before he was forced to miss six races due to sponsorship issues. Setzer also returned to K-Automotive in the Nationwide Series, driving the #96 ConelyAuto.com-sponsored Dodge on a part-time basis before moving to the other team car, #92.\n\nDuring the 2010 Aaron's 312 Nationwide Series race in Talladega on the last lap, Setzer, driving the #92, was involved in a huge crash which sent him up the wall and into the catch fence. He then hit a fence pole and spun around, and with a fiery explosion, landed on all four wheels. Setzer was okay after the crash.\n\nSetzer did not have a full-time ride to begin 2011. In March, he was named a substitute driver for Brian Keselowski in the Sprint Cup Series, who was recovering from gallbladder surgery. Setzer successfully qualified for the Bristol race, his first Cup series event since 1998. He went on to finish 38th, the team's best finish to date. Brian Keselowski has since returned to action. After several weeks, Setzer began driving the cars for Jay Robinson Racing in the Nationwide Series. Setzer also attempted a handful of races with ML Motorsports and R3 Motorsports. As of late October, his best finish of the year has been 18th at Road America. Setzer was to attempt the fall cup race at Martinsville, but qualifying was rained out and the field was set by owner's points, and Setzer and his K-Automotive Motorsports team went home.\n\n Season still in progress<br>\n"}

Their greatest success in the US came in 1981 when their song \"Zulu\" spent two weeks at No. 1 on the US Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart.\n\nMcFarlane and Campsie originally met in California in 1978 and began working together when they returned to England, teaming up with guitarist/keyboardist Ivan Penfold and drummer Graham Broad. Augmented by guitarists Rob Greene and Danny McIntosh Jr., the band initially christened themselves Grand Hotel and in early 1979 released one album for CBS UK under the title \"Do Not Disturb\". Later that year, Campsie and McFarlane resurfaced as The Quick. Their debut single, \"Sharks Are Cool, Jets Are Hot\" was released on CBS affiliate Epic Records in 1979. In 1981, the duo's single \"Hip Shake Jerk\" became a hit in Australia, reaching No. 12, and their first album \"On the Uptake\" was quickly released there. Remixed and repackaged as \"One Light in a Blackout\" (in Canada) and \"Fascinating Rhythm\" (in Europe) the album was released to the rest of the world in 1982, scoring a U.S. dance hit with \"Zulu\". The single \"Rhythm of the Jungle\" was another Top 20 success in Australia, reaching No. 13, and also became a hit in Europe. Stylistically, this inaugural period for the band was characterized by a hybrid of popular funk, dance, and new wave influences with an emphasis on bass and keyboards.\n\nBy the early 1980s, McFarlane and Campsie had also started doing studio work for other musicians, producing an album for Endgames among others. The Quick's second album, \"International Thing\", released by Epic in 1984, showed the band moving away from their earlier dance-friendly roots and adopting a more mainstream AOR approach and incorporating a variety of styles that expanded their previous boundaries to include a harder-edged rock sound. During this period, Campsie and McFarlane maintained a close friendship and professional alliance with British duo Go West. The Quick's final album, \"Wah Wah\", released in 1986 on A&M Records, was produced by The Cure bassist Phil Thornalley and saw the band moving sonically in an even heavier rock direction while still maintaining melodic pop sensibilities. Under Thornalley's direction, \"Wah Wah\" features dense 'wall of sound' production and heavy processing of instrumentation akin to that heard on the Trevor Horn-produced \"90125\" album by Yes (1984).\n\nMcFarlane and Campsie returned to Los Angeles for their next project, teaming up with producer Gardner Cole, resurfacing as Giant Steps in 1988 and releasing their sole album \"The Book of Pride\" through A&M. \"Book of Pride\" found Campsie and McFarlane returning to their dance/funk roots but with an updated rhythmic sense and keyboard-dominated sound displaying the influences of artists such as Prince, Morris Day & The Time, and Ready for the World. Working with R&B producer Preston Glass, Campsie and McFarlane recorded three new Giant Steps songs in 1989; the ballad \"Lonely 4 U\", \"Paint the Town Blue\", and the uptempo \"What We're Made Of\" (featuring Larry Graham guesting on bass and vocals). A second Giant Steps album never materialized.\n\nFrom 1990 to 2010, Campsie was married to British vocalist Beverley Craven. Through his London-based company Song-Creator, McFarlane continues to be active as a songwriter, music producer, programmer, arranger and songwriting consultant, and has written music for television shows including \"CSI NY\", \"The Late Show with David Letterman\", \"Two and a Half Men\", \"Sex and the City\", \"American Idol\", \"Good Morning America\", and \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\", among others.\n\n\n\nThe Quick recorded one radio session for the BBC, circa 1984. Four tracks from this session surfaced on their 1986 album \"Wah Wah\":\n\n"}

Its population in 2013 was 43,608. In recent years, the population has greatly increased due to an influx of immigrants, from Western Sahara, Colombia, Cuba, and other African and Latin American countries.\n\nThe municipality extends from the altitudinous center of the island -Mount Guajara (2,718 m, the second-highest mountain on the island, after Teide) is situated in this municipality- to the Atlantic Ocean. \n\nReina Sofía Airport is located in this municipality, as well as the beachside town of El Médano (\"The Sand Dune\"), where many important windsurfing competitions are held. La Montaña Roja (\"The Red Mountain\"), a volcanic cone located in El Médano, is a protected natural preserve, along with five other \"espacios naturales,\" which comprise 25% of the municipality's total area. Plans to build an industrial and commercial port in this municipality along a sector along the coast, from Barranco del Río to Montaña Pelada, have been discussed but not implemented, due to concerns about the environmental damage such a development would cause (All objections have been cleared and port goes ahead).\nThere is a wind farm in this municipality as well.\n\nThe municipality's main town is Granadilla de Abona; other towns include San Isidro, El Cabezo, Castro, Los Abrigos, Charco del Pino, Montaña de Yaco, El Salto, and Los Llanos.\n\nAbona was the name of a Guanche \"menceyato\", or kingdom, that existed in this region of the island at the time of Spanish conquest in the late fifteenth century. Founded around 1445, Abona was ruled by Atguaxoña, son of Axerax and whose son after the conquest was baptised and named Alonso Gonzalez. It extended from the Río de Chasna to Adeje, from the Barranco de Herques, to Güímar. The Spanish toponym of \"Granadilla\" does not appear until the end of the sixteenth century, but the settlement of the area by Europeans began at the time of conquest.\n\nThe Bay of El Médano was the last stop for provisions for Ferdinand Magellan and Juan Sebastián Elcano during the circumnavigation of the world. The expedition's cartographer and translator, Antonio Pigafetta, left this description of the place: \"On Tuesday, September 20, in the same year [1519] we departed from the place called Sanlúcar [de Barrameda], heading southwest, and before the end of the month, on the 26th, we arrived at an island that is called Tenerife, at 28 degrees longitude, to acquire meat, water, and firewood. We remained there for three days and a half; later we approached another port on the same island, \"Monte Rosso\" [Montaña Roja] by name, lingering there for two days…On Monday, October 3, at midnight, we departed southwards...\"\n\nRecords indicate that a church existed in the municipality in 1575. A Franciscan convent was founded in February 1665. St. Peter of Saint Joseph Betancur (1626–1667), spent some time in a little cave situated near the present-day town of El Médano. The cave is now the site of a small shrine dedicated to the saint.\n\nGranadilla de Abona acquired the status of a municipality in the nineteenth century, and a highway linking it to other parts of the island in the 1930s. Previously, travel to other parts of the island was only possibly by boat, which departed from the seaside towns of El Médano and Los Abrigos.\n\n\n\nWEBCAM LIVE EL MEDANO MUELLE \nWEBCAM LIVE EL MEDANO MUELLE \nWEBCAM LIVE EL MEDANO MUELLE "}

After his return to Japan, he worked as an administrator at the Japan Broadcasting Corporation from 1974 to 1985.\n\nIn 1982, the Prince returned to Australia as part of the Japanese delegation in honor of the tenth anniversary of the Australia-Japan Society. He also visited New Zealand to strengthen ties and friendly diplomatic relations. Despite his disabilities following a series of strokes in 1988, he took an active role in public service, and appeared regularly at award ceremonies, diplomatic events, and as President of various charity organizations.\n\nIn July 1997, Prince Katsura again visited Australia, to help promote an exhibition of the traditional sport of sumo, with exhibition matches held in Sydney and Melbourne.\n\nPrince Katsura suffered a series of strokes in May 1988 and had surgery for acute subdural hematoma. Finally he became paralyzed from the waist down, forcing him to use a wheelchair. Despite this, he remained active in public life and appeared regularly at award ceremonies, diplomatic events, and as president of various charity organizations. However, he had been hospitalized on and off since 2008 due to sepsis. In early 2014, the Prince was diagnosed with an unspecified illness that affected and deteriorated his heart.

Prince and Princess Mikasa, Prince Katsura's parents, acted out the duty of chief mourners and his niece, Princess Akiko, hosted the ceremony.\n\nPrince Katsura never married and left no legitimate children. As his brothers only had daughters themselves, his death marked the end of his father's branch of the Imperial Family and also his own branch. As a result, the number of households in the Imperial family dropped to four, excluding those led by Emperor Akihito and Crown Prince Naruhito. He was survived by his parents.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It flows through a sheer-sided, deep canyon immediately south of the Mustang capital of Lo Manthang, then widens as it approaches Kagbeni where high Himalayan ranges begin to close in. The river continues southward past Jomsom, Marpha, and Tukuche to the deepest part of the gorge about 7 km south of Tukuche in the area of Lete. The gorge then broadens past Dana and Tatopani toward Beni.\n\nThe Kali Gandaki gorge has been used as a trade route between India and Tibet for centuries. Today, it is part of a popular trekking route from Pokhara to Muktinath, part of the Annapurna Circuit. The gorge is within the Annapurna Conservation Area.\n\nThe pass at the head of the Kali Gandaki Gorge:\nIts 19th-century name was Kore La. The modern name is not known with certainty. Below is a quotation from Sven Hedin's visit to the headwaters of the Kali Gandaki in 1904. He points out that the pass is only 315 ft or 96 m above the south bank of the Tsangpo as it flows peacefully a few kilometres to the north in Tibet:\n\n\"We stand on the frontier between Tibet and Nepal. Behind us to the north we have flat, level land on the southern bank of the Tsangpo. We have mounted only 315 feet from the river to the Kore-la, where the height is 15,292 feet or 4662 metres asl. And from the pass there is a headlong descent to the Kali Gandak, an affluent of the Ganges. By means of a canal cut through the Kore-la the Brahmaputra might be turned into the Ganges. Northern India needs water for irrigation, but the gain would perhaps be small, for the Brahmaputra in Assam would be as much diminished as the Ganges was increased. Tibet would be opened. A new road would be opened for the invasion of India from the north, and therefore on the whole it is perhaps best for all parties concerned to leave things as they are. But the changes here indicated will some time come to pass without artificial aid, for the tentacles of the Kali Gandak are eating back northwards into the mountains much more quickly than the Tsangpo is eroding its valley. Some time or other, perhaps in a hundred thousand years, the Ganges system will have extended its tentacles to the bank of the Tsangpo, and then will be formed a bifurcation which, in the course of time, will bring about a total revolution in the proportions of the two rivers and their drainage areas.\"\n"}

He was also known as \"Mr. Magnificent\" Kevin Kelly in the American Wrestling Association (AWA) in the 1980s.\n\nKevin Wacholz started wrestling in 1982 after winning a Toughman Contest. He wrestled in various territories in Tennessee, Montreal, Central States, and the Pacific Northwest. \n\nIn 1985 he wrestled as Thor for World Class Championship Wrestling in Texas. Had feuds with Bobby Fulton and Brian Adias. That same year he worked with the same gimmick for Bill Watts' Mid-South Wrestling. \n\nIn 1986 he worked for New Japan Pro Wrestling. \n\nWacholz debut in the American Wrestling Association (AWA) as Kevin Kelly in 1984, as a babyface midcarder. By 1986, he was a top heel and challenged for the AWA World Heavyweight Championship. He used the moniker, \"Mr. Magnificent\" Kevin Kelly. \n\nIn 1987, he was managed by Sherri Martel and regularly issued arm wrestling challenges. This led to a feud with Tommy Rich, who answered one of his challenges on an edition of \"AWA Championship Wrestling\" on ESPN. Rich appeared to have the contest won, when Martel interfered on Kelly's behalf. In retaliation, Rich tore off her dress. Rich would then dominate a series of matches between the two.\n\nAfter Martel left the AWA, Kelly took Madusa Miceli as his manager. He often teamed with Nick Kiniski as \"The Perfect Tag Team\" to contend for the AWA World Tag Team Championship.\n\nHe left the AWA in 1988, before it folded in 1991. \n\nIn June 1990, Kelly returned to Japan for Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling where he had a feud with Dick Murdoch. \n\nWacholz, still performing under the name Kevin Kelly, received a tryout match on June 6, 1989 at a \"WWF Superstars\" taping in Madison, WI, defeating Tim Horner. A night later he defeated Jim Powers at a \"Wrestling Challenge\" taping, but was not signed to a contract that year. After the AWA folded, Wacholz received another tryout match, this time at a \"WWF Superstars\" taping on May 6, 1991, defeating Brian Costello. The following night at a \"Wrestling Challenge\" taping he defeated Gary Jackson in a dark match.\n\nIn 1992, Wacholz debuted in the WWF as Nailz, an ex-convict who, in a series of promos, alleged he was abused by former prison guard Big Boss Man during his incarceration. He also claimed to be innocent of his (unspecified) crimes. Following Big Boss Man's squash of Dave Roulette on the May 30 episode of \"WWF Superstars of Wrestling\", Nailz (dressed in an orange prison jumpsuit) attacked Boss Man, handcuffing him to the top rope before repeatedly hitting and choking him with his own nightstick. Nailz easily defeated numerous jobbers en route to defeating Boss Man's ally Virgil at SummerSlam. He attacked Sgt. Slaughter before a match went ended in a no contest in September 1992. He continued to feud with Boss Man, who had recovered from Nailz's beating. The feud came to its climax when Big Boss Man defeated Nailz in a nightstick match at Survivor Series. Before Nailz finished the feud with Boss Man, he began another feud, this time with The Undertaker. The two had a stare down on the October 24 episode of \"Superstars\", a photo of which was used as the cover of the January 1993 issue of \"WWF Magazine\". He had a few matches losing to WWF Champion Bret Hart. Also he had a short feuded with The Ultimate Warrior.\n\nHowever, Wacholz was released from his WWF contract in December 1992, after he allegedly attacked Vince McMahon in his office over a financial dispute, while John Nord watched the door. Bret Hart recalled in his autobiography that Wacholz \"cornered Vince in his office and screamed at him for fifteen minutes\". Hart claims he was just down the hall from the office when he heard a loud crash, which was Wacholz \"knocking Vince over in his chair, choking him violently\". The incident led to a series of lawsuits between Wacholz and the WWF. Wacholz alleged McMahon had given him steroids on a number of occasions; McMahon denied the claim. Wacholz then filed a wrongful termination lawsuit claiming McMahon sexually assaulted him. The WWF filed a counterclaim against Wacholz, but both suits were later dropped. In 1994, Wacholz testified against McMahon during his trial on charges of supplying steroids to WWF wrestlers. He claimed McMahon had told him to take steroids.\n\nAfter getting fired from the WWF, Wacholz began working in the independent circuit. \n\nWacholz appeared at World Championship Wrestling's (WCW) \"Slamboree\" event in 1993 as The Prisoner (looking identical to his Nailz persona), losing to Sting.\n\nFrom 1993 to 1997 he worked for Pro Wrestling America in Minnesota where he feuded with Road Warrior Hawk. \n\nHe was World Wide Wrestling Alliance's heavyweight champion in 1994. He dropped the title to Brutus Beefcake on April 16. \n\nHe wrestled in Jim Crockett's short-lived promotion, WWN, in 1994, as The Convict. He also wrestled for New Japan Pro Wrestling that year, as D.O.C. Nelson and Nailz. Teamed with Ron Simmons. \n\nIn 1996, Wacholz appeared in Paul Alperstein's American Wrestling Federation as Nails (pronounced identical to \"Nailz\") alongside many WWF wrestlers from the 1980s and 1990s who were also wrestling in that promotion. On November 1, 1997 he lost to Jimmy Snuka at World Wrestling Alliance in Fort Lewis, Washington. \n\nHe returned to WCW for a few appearances from 1997 to 1998. On October 6, 1997 he defeated Yugi Nagata in a dark match on Monday Night Nitro. His last appearance was on April 17, 1998 where he defeated Barry Darsow at a house show. \n\nHis last match was a loss to Matt Burns by disqualification on August 25, 2001 at an independent show in Orrock, Minnesota. After that, Wacholz officially retired from wrestling.\n\n\n\n"}

There was a sharp decline in the population of the Bosnian in Banja Luka from 1879 to 1991, while there was a sharp and consistent increase in the Serbian population in the city in that time frame. Meanwhile, the population of those who were Croatian remained relatively the same in Banja Luka over the years, with a gradual decline starting after WII.\n\nOn the municipal level numbers tend to stay relatively the same. It is noted that the Serbian population has declined due to some of the rural parts that were included in the city, and the in-migration that occurred after the 1969 earthquake. There was a sharp drop in the Bosniak population on the municipal level in 1910, which can be attributed to massive emigration (partly due to Agrarian Reform), and the fact that many Bosnian peoples had to declare themselves as Croats, Serbs or undecided Muslims until 1971 when their national identity was created.\n\n"}

It lies six miles (10 km) south of Solihull and ten miles (16 km) northwest of Warwick.\n\nLapworth boasts an historic church, the Church of St Mary the Virgin, a chapel and two National Trust sites: Baddesley Clinton, a medieval moated manor house and garden; and Packwood House, a Tudor manor house and yew garden with over 100 trees.\n\nThe church is a building largely of the 13th and 14th centuries. It includes several unusual features: the steeple is connected by a passage to the north aisle and is built sheer with a projecting stair; the clerestory has square-headed windows; and there is a two-storey annex at the west end.\n\nIn the church the Portland memorial to Florence Bradshaw was the work of Eric Gill and was installed in 1928. It is a Virgin and Child carved in low relief.\n\nThe village is a popular area for cuisine, with three pubs \"\"The Boot\"\", \"\"The Navigation\"\" and \"\"The Punch Bowl\"\".\n\nAt Kingswood Junction, the Grand Union Canal joins the Stratford-upon-Avon Canal, which has a major flight of locks.\n\nCatesby Lane in Lapworth is named after William Catesby (the father of Robert Catesby of Gunpowder Plot fame), whose family had been settled at Bushwood Hall, in the neighbouring parish of Bushwood, since the 14th century.

Owned by Broadway Media, the station's studios are located in Downtown Salt Lake City and its transmitter site is located southwest of the city on Farnsworth Peak in the Oquirrh Mountains.\n\nKOVO, Inc., received the construction permit for a radio station on 96.1 MHz in Provo on May 9, 1966. The new FM outlet took the call letters KFMC and signed on February 14, 1968. KOVO and KFMC were placed in receivership in 1973, after Glenn C. Shaw sued co-owner Ashley J. Robison asking for a financial accounting of KOVO, Inc.'s operations; when the case could not be settled, the stations were ordered into receivership and bids were accepted to buy the company. Both owners placed bids, but they were beaten out by First Media Corporation of Washington, D.C., whose principal was a former Utah resident and which also had J.W. Marriott Jr. as an investor. However, First Media did not become the owner of KOVO-KFMC until 1976 because the other parties appealed the district court's decision all the way to the Utah Supreme Court.\n\nFirst Media immediately made a mark on the operations of both stations, changing the call letters of KFMC to KAYK-FM on June 1, 1976. KAYK-AM-FM simulcast as adult contemporary outlet \"K-96\".\nThe stations remained a simulcast until 1980, when 960 AM broke off as KDOT. The call letters were changed to KFMY in 1981, but the station moved in a contemporary hit radio direction. K-96 was Glenn Beck's first job out of high school; Beck worked at the station for six months in 1983 before leaving Provo.\n\nIn 1987, First Media announced it would sell its 11 radio stations, including KFMY-AM-FM, to a partnership of Alaskan Eskimos and New York investors, known as Cook Inlet; this gave First Media a tax break under policies that promoted minority ownership of radio stations.\n\nUnder Cook Inlet, KFMY-FM flipped to oldies in 1988 as KZOL. The Great Stock Company of Vast International Import acquired KFMY-KZOL in 1990 from Cook Inlet for $972,000.\n\nThe slumping KZOL, however, went through a major change in 1992, precipitated as much by events at another Salt Lake City-area station as by its own poor performance. In late 1991, 23 of the 25 disc jockeys at alternative outlet KJQN-FM (95.5), known as \"KJQ\", quit after the station hired a new general manager, making them question the ownership's commitment to its \"modern music\" format. The result was that on February 13, 1992, with the financial backing of concert promoter J. C. McNeil, many of the former KJQ airstaff, organizing as the Acme Broadcasting Company, started a new alternative rocker on the former KZOL as KXRK \"X96\". The Great Stock Company said that because of KZOL's unsatisfactory ratings performance as an adult contemporary outlet, it was willing to entertain brokering the station to Acme, which retained KZOL's sales and office staff but none of its air personalities.\n\nThe result was an unusual format war between \"new rock outlets\" which ended when KJQN-FM flipped to CHR in October. Ex-KJQ DJs on the new X96 included Bill Allred (mornings), Dom Casual (mornings), Andrea Gappmayer (mid-day), Mike Summers (afternoon), Todd Nuke'em (evening) and Chet Tapp (overnight). Acme acquired the station from Great Stock in 1993 for $925,000; the application included a copy of a lawsuit filed by the former KJQN-FM, alleging that its former employees took equipment, including a live truck known as the \"Milk Beast\", when they defected, and that the ex-KJQ staffers used KJQN-owned trademarks and made defamatory remarks about their former station.\n\nSince fall 1995, X96 has hosted an annual all-day music festival called the Big Ass Show (BASh) featuring nationally touring alternative and punk bands, as well as providing a stage for local bands. In 1996, X96 underwent a major technical overhaul, moving to 96.3 MHz from a transmitter on Farnsworth Peak, increasing its coverage area (particularly in Utah County).\n\nIn April 1998, Acme sold KXRK to Simmons Media Group. Simmons moved X96 to studios located on the corner of Broadway and 2nd West in Salt Lake City. In its 2006 summer double issue, \"Rolling Stone\" named KXRK one of five \"awesome rock outlets\" that were thriving in their markets despite a recent contraction in rock radio stations across the United States.\n\nIn 2014, Broadway Media acquired Simmons Media Group for $11 million after having taken over operations the previous year. Broadway moved X96 and its sister stations to new studios on 50 W. Broadway (300 S.) in downtown Salt Lake City; the company currently houses seven stations at this location.\n\n\n"}

It was to leave the Stockport Branch Canal in South Reddish and it was to be lock free but with a short tunnel. It was to follow the contour above the right bank of the River Tame, firstly in a northerly direction and then easterly as it followed the meandering course of the river upstream. It was to terminate at or near to the coalmining hamlet of Beat Bank in Denton where it could also secure supplies of coal from nearby mines at Haughton Green.\n\nThe Stockport Branch Canal and the Beat Bank Branch Canal were both authorised by an Act of Parliament obtained by the Proprietors of the Ashton Canal in March 1793, just nine months after the Act which authorised the main line of the canal. This second Act also authorised the Hollinwood Branch Canal, and allowed the Proprietors to raise £30,000 to fund the construction of all three branches. The Hollingwood branch opened in late 1796, and the Stockport branch followed in January 1797. Construction of the Beat Bank branch was difficult, as it was on a clay slope at the edge of the Tame Valley, which was liable to slippage, and once the Ashton Canal Company had secured an adequate coal-carrying business on the Hollinwood Branch Canal and the Fairbottom Branch Canal, they decided to suspend all work on the unfinished Beat Bank Branch Canal. They informed William Hulton, the owner of the coal mines at Denton, that they could not afford to complete the work.\n\nAn Act of Parliament obtained in 1798 allowed the Canal Company to raise further money and abandon the unfinished canal. Its progress through Parliament was opposed by Hulton, who declined an initial offer of the unfinished canal, but he was unsuccessful in his opposition. Some of the money raised was used to pay compensation to land and property owners along the line of the canal for loss or damage caused by the activities of the Canal Company.\n\nOnly a very short length of the canal was put in water at Reddish and this was known as the Beat Bank or Reddish Private Branch.\nJust beyond the watered section, the plans showed a tunnel, but construction of this was not started. Beyond the tunnel, most of the bed was excavated for a distance of around . No work was done on the section between there and the site of a proposed reservoir, and then another section of around was built, but the final length to the collieries was not.\n\nSections of this canal still remain along Reddish Vale Allotments, to the right of Ross Lave Lane and past the M60 viaduct. The engineers who built the M60 viaduct used the same contours as those who built the Beat Bank branch canal and subsequently severed it.\n\nThe 1848 Ordnance Survey map shows about of canal running from the junction towards the site of the tunnel, but there are no buildings to indicate what it might have been used for. By 1893, only about half of it was left, and by 1907, an engineering works had been built beside the railway, and the remains of the canal are shown as little more than a widening of the main line at the location of the former junction.\n\n"}

There were few notable storms this year. Tropical Storms Miriam, Norman, and Rosa all made landfall in Mexico with minimal impact. Hurricane Daniel briefly threatened the U.S. state of Hawaii while weakening. Hurricane Carlotta was the strongest storm of the year and the second-strongest June hurricane in recorded history. Carlotta killed 18 people when it sank a freighter. Overall, the season was significantly more active than the previous season, with 19 tropical storms. In addition, six hurricanes developed. Furthermore, there were total of two major hurricanes, Category 3 or greater on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale.\n\nIt officially started on May 15 in the Eastern Pacific, and on June 1 in the Central Pacific; they both ended on November 30, 2000. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Pacific basin. However, the formation of tropical cyclones is possible at any time of the year.\n\nSeasonal activity began on May 22, when Hurricane Aletta formed off the southwest coast of Mexico. Two storms formed in June, though the season became slowly active in July when three named storms developed, including Hurricane Daniel which was the second-strongest storm of the season. During August, Hurricanes Gilma and Hector formed, as well as four other storms. September was a relatively quiet month with two storms, of which one was Hurricane Lane.

These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. This season had an above average number of storms. However, it had a below-average number of hurricanes and major hurricanes. There were also two tropical depressions that did not reach storm strength. In the central Pacific, two tropical storms formed. The first storm formed on May 22 and the last storm dissipated on November 8.\n\nA tropical wave crossed Central America and entered the Gulf of Tehuantepec on May 20. Deep convection developed near a center, and the system became the first tropical depression of the season on May 22 while located south of Acapulco, Mexico. A mid-level ridge forced a west-northwest track away from the Mexican coast. It intensified into Tropical Storm Aletta early on May 23 while located south of Zihuatanejo, Mexico, becoming the first May tropical storm in four years. As it turned westward, it continued a slow intensification trend, before strengthening more quickly due to decreased wind shear. On May 24, Aletta attained hurricane status, and shortly thereafter reached peak winds of ; this made it a Category 2 on the Saffir–Simpson scale.\n\nAfter maintaining peak winds for about 18 hours, Aletta began a weakening trend due to increasing wind shear. At around the same time, a trough eroded the ridge that was steering the movement of Aletta, causing the hurricane to remain almost stationary for the next two days. The lack of motion resulted in upwelling which imparted additional weakening, and Aletta weakened to tropical storm status on May 27. It quickly deteriorated that day, and on May 28 the system dissipated well south of Cabo San Lucas after it began a slow north drift. The remnants lingered in the same area for the next several days. Aletta caused no known damages or casualties. Hurricane Aletta was the second-strongest May hurricane by pressure, as well as the fourth strongest May hurricane by winds.\n\nA tropical wave that eventually became Tropical Storm Bud was first identified off the coast of Africa on May 22. It moved across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea, then into the eastern Pacific Ocean on June 6 with little development. The tropical wave remained disorganized until June 11 when a broad low-pressure area developed southwest of Acapulco, Mexico. The wave was only intensifying slowly, and on June 13, it became strong enough to be designated as a tropical depression. It quickly strengthened to tropical storm intensity six hours later, and moved to the northwest. It was forecast to strengthen to a strong tropical storm with winds reaching , but the storm only reached a peak intensity of early on June 14. Bud turned to the north-northwest, and slowly weakened from June 15 onwards, due to increasing vertical wind shear and cooler ocean water temperatures. The storm's forward speed decreased and began to meander, as the ridge to the north of Bud weakens and a trough develops over the western United States. It drifted erratically while located just north of Socorro Island, and was downgraded to a tropical depression on June 16. By the next day, it dissipated into an area of low pressure; however, it continued to exist until June 19.\n\nBud passed near Socorro Island on June 15, with estimated one-minute winds of , and caused large waves along the western coast of Mexico. However, no reports of damage or casualties were received.\nA tropical wave that entered the Pacific Ocean acquired a closed circulation and became a depression on June 18. It strengthened into a storm June 19 and a hurricane the next day. Carlotta then began explosively deepening, and it strengthened into a Category 4 hurricane on June 21. It then began to reduce its forward speed and slowly weaken as its path paralleled the Pacific coast of Mexico. Carlotta weakened to a storm on June 24 and a depression June 25. The cyclone dissipated shortly thereafter.\n\nThough it never made landfall, Carlotta killed 18 people when it sank the Lithuanian freighter M/V \"Linkuva\". Carlotta is also the third-most intense June tropical cyclone in the east Pacific; only Ava of 1973 and Celia of 2010 were stronger.\n\nTropical Depression Four-E was a short-lived storm that formed from the same tropical wave that spawned Tropical Depression Two in the Atlantic Ocean. The tropical wave crossed Central America between June 30 and July 1, continuing to move westward into the Pacific Ocean. The wave became more organized on July 6 and the National Hurricane Center started issuing advisories on the newly developed tropical depression later that day. The hurricane center predicted that the depression will reach tropical storm intensity, as there was a lack of vertical wind shear around the system and sea surface temperatures were warm enough for intensification to occur. The depression lacked any deep convection, however, and it began weakening on the next day. It was dissipating late in the day as the storm moved into an area of stronger wind shear.\n\nA tropical wave organized into Tropical Depression One-C on July 20 while located southeast of the Hawaiian Islands. It strengthened slowly and moved nearly due west, before reaching storm strength later on July 20. The storm was named Upana, which is Hawaiian for \"Urban\". Despite a favorable environment, Upana strengthened little, reaching a peak intensity on July 21 with winds of . The storm had no deep convection in its circulation on July 22, and was downgraded to a tropical depression in the afternoon. Late on July 23, deep convection flared up, briefly strengthening the storm, but failed to become a tropical storm again, as it remained poorly organized. It dissipated on July 24, despite a low-shear environment favorable for development.\n\nUpana is the first storm in the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility to be named in July, and the first tropical storm to develop in the region since Tropical Storm Paka in the 1997 season. Upana's remnants continued moving to the west, where JMA classified its remnants a tropical depression, but east of the International Date Line on July 27. It crossed the International Date Line later that day. The remnants encountered a favorable environment just west of the dateline, and developed into Tropical Depression 12W. The depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Chanchu. The name \"chanchu\", submitted by Macau, is a Cantonese word for pearl. Chanchu moved north, and had dissipated by July 30.\n\nGary Padgett suggested that there was good evidence Chanchu was actually a regeneration of Upana. The official policy is that dateline crossers keep their name. However, there was supposedly some doubt at the time so Chanchu and Upana were officially treated as distinct tropical cyclones. Also, since Upana had dissipated several days earlier, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center had already assigned a new number for the system, Gary Padgett deemed it likely that the Japan Meteorological Agency's decision to rename the cyclone was the best choice.\n\nThe origins of Tropical Depression Five-E were first identified on July 8 when a tropical wave moved off the west African coast. It entered the eastern Pacific Ocean on July 16 after tracking over the Caribbean Sea. The wave developed to a tropical depression on July 22. It lacked any deep convection and it was moving over cold waters, so it never intensified further to a tropical storm. The depression dissipated late on July 23, one day after it formed to a depression.\n\nHurricane Daniel reached Category 3 intensity and briefly threatened Hawaii as a tropical storm, but veered to the northwest as it approached the islands.\n\nNo casualties or damaged was reported in association with Hurricane Daniel, despite the system's passing close enough to Hawaii to require tropical storm warnings. It still produced heavy surf conditions along the northern shores of the Hawaiian Islands. Daniel was the first tropical cyclone to be a significant threat to Hawaii since 1994.\n\nOn July 11, a tropical wave moved off the African coast, and moved to the Lesser Antilles one week later. It passed over Central America near Panama on July 22 without any increase in organization. On July 25, the wave began to show curved banding, showing that it had become better organized. It intensified to a tropical depression on July 26 while located south southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico, designated as Tropical Depression Seven-E. The depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Emilia later that day while moving northwest, steered by a mid-level ridge to its north. During this time, Emilia was forecast to strengthen to a hurricane within two days, due to the system moving over warm waters. However, late on July 27, the storm began to accelerate, meaning that it will move into cooler waters sooner than firstly anticipated, therefore, only allowing the storm to intensify within a few hours before weakening. Emilia moved near Socorro Island and its intensity peaked with wind speeds of , with an eyewall beginning to form. A few hours later, the storm moved into cooler waters and drier air, and Emilia's deep convection dissipated, weakening the storm. Late on July 28 deep convection redeveloped near the storm's center, but wind shear prevented Emilia from strengthening. It turned to the west and weakened below tropical storm intensity on July 29, as the deep convection in the storm diminished again. It shortly dissipated while located several hundred miles west south-west of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico.\n\nA tropical wave moved off the west coast of Africa on July 19, and entered into the Pacific on July 27. Minimal development occurred in the west-northwestward moving wave until August 1. It was then that the tropical wave began developing a low-level circulation and convective organization was seen to the south of Manzanillo, Colima, Mexico. The system continued to become better organized, and was classified as Tropical Depression Eight-E, which was centered about west-southwest of Manzanillo on August 3 at 1200 UTC. The depression initially moved west-northwestward about , and later slowed and turned westward on August 4. As the depression had curved westward, it had intensified enough to be upgraded to Tropical Storm Fabio. Despite the presence of wind shear, Fabio continued to strengthen and reach a peak intensity of later that day. Fabio turned toward west-southwest while weakening on August 5. Fabio weakened back to a tropical depression on August 6 and dissipated two days later about west-southwest of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. The remnant swirl of low clouds persisted for several more days, eventually undergoing a Fujiwhara interaction with the remains of Hurricane Gilma.\n\nGilma was a Category 1 hurricane (on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale) that took a climatological west-northwesterly track over the open waters of the eastern North Pacific.\n\nIn the middle of August, two tropical storms developed off the Mexican coastline. Hector became a hurricane and moved out to sea, and Ileana became a strong tropical storm that neared, but never made landfall on the Mexican coastline. Hector formed southwest of Mexico, moved westward and dissipated over colder water southwest of Baja California. The remnants of Hector passed over the Hawaiian Islands several days later, producing heavy rain over most of the island chain.\n\nIleana was a strong tropical storm that briefly threatened the southwest coast of mainland Mexico and the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula before abruptly turning away from Baja California and dissipating over open water.\n\nA tropical disturbance developed in the Western Pacific Ocean along the eastern periphery of the monsoon trough in mid-August. Located at 33° north, it steadily organized, and became Tropical Depression Sixteen-W on August 15 while located to the northwest of Honolulu, Hawaii. It moved eastward along the west-east oriented surface pressure trough, and crossed the International Date Line later on August 15. Abnormally warm sea surface temperatures allowed the system to intensify despite its unusually high latitude, and it became Tropical Storm Wene on August 16. It quickly attained a peak intensity of , but weakened due to colder sea surface temperatures and wind shear. Wene continued to weaken, and dissipated when the storm merged with an extratropical cyclone.\n\nAs a depression, Wene was the first Western Pacific tropical cyclone to cross the dateline since the 1996 season. The name Wene is Hawaiian for \"Wayne\". The system formed at the second-northernmost latitude of any storm in the East Pacific basin.\n\nJohn originated on August 28 from an area of disturbed weather that was associated with the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) near just outside the Central Pacific basin. Developing near the Central Pacific basin, John eventually entered early on August 30 and was then also monitored by the Central Pacific Hurricane Center. that was a tropical storm for several days and moved from the eastern to the central Pacific basin. Thereafter entering the central Pacific region, Tropical Storm John approached hurricane status while meandering erratically east-southeast of Hawaii. John eventually encountered strong wind shear, and dissipated on September 1. Tropical Storm John did not cause any damage or fatalities, as there were no reports of any land being affect.\n\nPart of the same tropical wave that spawned Tropical Storm Chris in the Atlantic uneventfully crossed the rest of the Atlantic and passed far out to sea into the Pacific before it organized into Tropical Depression Fourteen-E on August 31. Despite significant shear, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Kristy as it meandered far from land over the open ocean. Wind shear then dissipated the system on September 3, just 210 kilometers from where it first organized.\n\nThe precursor to Lane was a tropical wave that formed in the Atlantic Ocean on August 20. The wave moved across the Atlantic basin without development and crossed Central America on August 29. By September 1, the system was beginning to organize south of Mexico. On September 4, the system became a tropical depression southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico. The next day the tropical depression became Tropical Storm Lane. After becoming a tropical storm, Lane executed a counter-clockwise loop, during that maneuver, the storm crossed its own wake and weakened slightly. After the storm finished the loop, it continued to move westward where it reached hurricane strength on September 9 while passing over Socorro Island. By September 11, Lane encountered cooler waters which weakened the hurricane back to tropical storm strength. Lane then encountered a trough that had formed off the western United States coastline. The interaction with the system caused Lane to curve northeast towards the West Coast of the United States. On September 13, Lane passed over cooler waters, causing it to weaken to a tropical depression. Lane then dissipated on the next day.\n\nOn September 9, forecasters predicted that the storm would remain offshore and its rainbands would bring heavy rains and gusty winds across the Baja California. However, because forecasters predicted that the storm would stay offshore, and so no warnings or watches were issued. Lane passed directly over Socorro Island where a weather station recorded a pressure of 973 mb. Although the center of Lane was well offshore, it still brought heavy surf that closed several ports in Mexico. In an Jose del Cabo, Mexico, a weather station reported winds of . Lane remnants then affected the Western United States. The moisture from Lane produced thunderstorms in California. At all locations, effects were minimal, with no reports of damage or casualties.\n\nA tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on August 29. It remained weak as it moved westward across the Atlantic Ocean, and entered the Pacific Ocean on September 9. As it moved west-northwestward, it organized, and developed into Tropical Depression Fifteen-E on September 15 while east-southeast of Cabo San Lucas, Baja California Sur. Banding features became more pronounced, though convection remained intermittent. On September 16, the depression briefly became Tropical Storm Miriam, though quickly weakened back to a tropical depression as it continued north-northwestward. Miriam dissipated on September 17 while northeast of Cabo San Lucas. Tropical storm force winds were never reported, and it is possible Miriam never attained tropical storm status.\n\nMiriam dropped lighter than average rainfall upon Mexico, peaking at at La Cruz/Elota. Total damages from the storm amounted to $7.2 million (MXN; $558,000 in 2000 USD, $ in USD). By October 24, a national disaster declaration was signed for areas affected by Tropical Storm Miriam in Baja California Sur.\nThe same tropical wave that spawned Atlantic Hurricane Gordon organized into an area of low pressure in the Eastern Pacific Ocean on September 18. Its convection slowly organized while south of Mexico, and a tropical depression formed on September 20 while south-southeast of Manzanillo, Colima. Weak steering currents forced the depression to drift slowly northward, and later on September 20 it strengthened into Tropical Storm Norman. Norman quickly reached peak winds of before making landfall in western Mexico. The storm rapidly weakened to a tropical depression over land, but Norman maintained its circulation and some deep convection as it turned to the northwest. It emerged over water on September 22, but turned to the northeast, made landfall again in Mexico, and dissipated later that day.\n\nNorman produced heavy rainfall across western Mexico, peaking at nearly in the stacote of Colima. In all, Norman caused $13.3 million (2000 USD; $ USD) in damage.\n\nOlivia was a tropical storm that formed off the southwest coast of mainland Mexico, and generally tracked west-northwestward and remained over open water. After dissipating as a tropical cyclone, the remnant low-level circulation tracked across central Baja California, northwest Mexico and the desert southwest United States.\nAn area of disturbed weather emerged from the ITCZ on October 22. Located several hundred miles south-southeast of the Gulf of Tehuantepec, convection gradually organized and increased, and by October 25 satellite images indicated the development of the eighteenth tropical depression of the season. Operationally it was not classified until 15 hours later. The depression moved westward throughout its duration, and based on Dvorak estimates, intensified into Tropical Storm Paul on October 26. Despite increasing wind shear ahead of the storm, the National Hurricane Center predicted steady intensification to near hurricane status, although Paul only attained peak winds of .\n\nAs wind shear increased and convection became disorganized, Paul weakened. A trough briefly curved it to the northwest, before resuming its westward motion. Although the convection was becoming displaced from the low-level circulation, the National Hurricane Center continued to predict strengthening. However, the thunderstorms became minimal, and Paul weakened to a tropical depression early on October 28. The circulation center deteriorated, and although there were bursts in convection, Paul dissipated early on October 29, as it was becoming indistinguishable in the ITCZ. The remnants continued westward, and interacted with an upper-level low, affecting Hawaii with heavy rainfall in early November. The flooding caused $70 million in damage, and the highest rainfall total was at Kapapala Ranch. That rainfall total makes Paul the third rainiest tropical cyclone in Hawaii, behind only Hurricane Hiki and Hurricane Lane of 1950 and 2018, respectively.\n\nThe origins of Tropical Storm Rosa can be traced to a tropical wave that moved off the coast of Africa on October 18. It showed signs of development in the southwestern Caribbean Sea, though moved into the East Pacific Ocean on November 1 before being able to develop further. Favorable conditions allowed the system to quickly organize, and the wave formed into Tropical Depression Nineteen-E on November 3 while south of the El Salvador–Guatemala border. A ridge of high pressure to its north forced the depression westward, where it slowly organized into a tropical storm on November 5. A mid-level trough eroded the high pressure system, allowing Rosa to turn more to the north. On November 6, the storm reached a peak of , though Rosa slowly weakened as it accelerated to the northeast. On November 8, the storm made landfall on the southern coast of Mexico with winds of , and quickly dissipated.\n\nRosa dropped moderate rainfall across Mexico, peaking at near the Mexico/Guatemala border. Damage was minimal, totaling to only $15,000 (2000 USD; $ USD). Rosa was the first November storm since Hurricane Rick in the 1997 season.\n\nOn July 26, a tropical depression formed east of the International Date Line from the possible remnants of Upana, and it quickly exited the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility. However, this storm was not included in the CPHC database. As it crossed into the western Pacific, it strengthened into a tropical storm and received the name \"Chanchu\".\n\nThis is a table of all the storms that have formed in the 2000 Pacific hurricane season. It includes their duration, names, landfall(s), denoted in parentheses, damages, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all the damage figures are in 2000 USD.\n\nThe following names were used for named storms that formed in the eastern Pacific in 2000. Names that were not assigned are marked in gray No names were retired, so it was used again in the 2006 Pacific hurricane season. This is the same list used for the 1994 season.\n\nFor storms that form in the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility, encompassing the area between 140 degrees west and the International Date Line, all names are used in a series of four rotating lists. The next four names that were slated for use in 2000 are shown below, however only two of them were used.\n\n\n"}

His father died when he was 2 years old. As described in his 2010 one-man show \"It Ain't All Confetti\", Taylor had a tough childhood, which included being molested while in foster care and having to deal with bullies in school. As a teenager he attended Capitol Page School. As a young man, Taylor worked as a congressional page before serving in the Korean War while in the U.S. Army Signal Corps. Although assigned to the Corps, he was sent to Special Services, the entertainment wing of the military, where he performed for the troops in Tokyo and Korea.\n\nTaylor's career in show business began when he joined the U.S. Army, where he started performing stand-up in clubs and restaurants abroad while also performing for the troops. After his military service, and back in the U.S., he focused on a nightclub career. His mainstay material was \"pantomiming records, his favorites were Yiddish folk songs and Spike Jones tunes.\" He said that ended one day when the record player broke, \"I haven't shut up since.\" In the mid-1950s he worked the strip clubs all along the Eastern coast of the U.S. Although a lot of his material were jokes stolen from acts he saw in USO shows, his first signature piece would be to pretend to cry as he begged the audience to laugh. He found he could get a bigger response that way. His bookings started to get more upscale and he played all over Miami Beach, Florida, which had become a winter destination for the wealthy. Taylor was also a mainstay in the summer playground of the wealthy in the Catskills Mountains. One night a booking agent of \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" caught his show, the comic spent a week's salary on champagne to get the audience boisterous, it got him on in 1961. Taylor made close to twenty appearances, Sullivan would forget his name, but used to say \"Get me the crying comedian.\"\n\nIn addition to the \"Ed Sullivan Show\", Taylor appeared on \"The Jackie Gleason Show\" in several guest appearances during the 1963–1964 season as \"the crying comedian\". Taylor's signature confetti tossing gag came from an appearance in the 1960s \"The Merv Griffin Show\" where he was bombing as a stand-up comedian. \"I did props and I was 'The Prop Comedian.' I was dying like hell on Merv Griffin's show. The jokes were dumb, and I tore the five by eight cards, threw them up in the air and it became confetti,\" he recalled. \"I knocked over his desk, walked up the aisle, went to Sardi's and said, 'Well, that's the end of my television career.' I went home that night. Their switchboard had lit up. They said, 'Get the guy that went crazy!'\"\n\nTaylor became somewhat of a fixture in Las Vegas, Nevada. He was the opener for Eleanor Powell's dance-focused revue, and would go on to warm up audiences for headliners \"Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr., Ann-Margret, Debbie Reynolds, Frankie Laine, Judy Garland and The Kingston Trio\". In the 1970s he won Las Vegas Entertainer of the Year three times.\n\nHe appeared in two 1968 episodes of \"The Monkees\" as well as having a cameo in their 1969 special \" Revolutions per Monkee\". He continued to work as a voice performer in the 1970s cartoon series \"Here Comes the Grump\", as the title character, and in the second edition of \"The Addams Family\" cartoon series in 1992, as the voice of Uncle Fester.\n\nThroughout the 1970s, Taylor was a frequent celebrity guest panelist on television game shows such as \"Hollywood Squares\", \"To Tell the Truth\", and \"The Gong Show\", and substituted for Charles Nelson Reilly on \"Match Game.\" He became a regular on Sid and Marty Krofft's \"Sigmund and the Sea Monsters\", playing Sheldon, a sea-genie who lived in a conch shell. In addition, Taylor was also a regular on \"The Brady Bunch Hour\", playing the role of neighbor/performer Jack Merrill. He also hosted a short-lived send-up of beauty pageants titled \"The $1.98 Beauty Show\", created by Chuck Barris in 1978, producer/host of \"The Gong Show\". Taylor appeared as a celebrity on the 1990 version of \"Match Game\". In 1979, he was the voice of C.J. from the Hanna-Barbera television movie \"Scooby Goes Hollywood\".

His ashes were scattered at sea in Hawaii.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2187564", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2187564", "title": "Arduin of Ivrea", "text": "Arduin of Ivrea\n\nArduin (; c.955 – 14 December 1015) was an Italian nobleman who was King of Italy from 1002 until 1014.\n\nIn 990 Arduin became Margrave of Ivrea and in 991 Count of the Sacred Palace of the Lateran in Rome. In 1002, after the death of Emperor Otto III, the Italian nobles elected him King of Italy in the Basilica of San Michele Maggiore in Pavia, making him the first non-German on the Italian throne in 41 years. Arduin was considered the choice of the nobility and opposed by the episcopate, but he was initially supported by the Archbishop of Milan.\n\nIn Germany, however, Henry II was elected to succeed Otto, and he contested Arduin's election in Italy. In 1004, Henry invaded Italy, defeated Arduin and was crowned king in Pavia. He soon withdrew back to Germany, and Arduin was able to reassert his authority at least in the northwest of Italy for the next decade. Henry II invaded Italy again in 1014 and was proclaimed Emperor in Rome, at which point Arduin was finally forced to relinquish his crown. He died soon after at the Abbey of Fruttuaria, ending the independence of the Kingdom of Italy from Germany.\n\nThe study of Arduin's reign has been bedeviled by the many forged diplomas in his name. These caused older scholarship to overrate his importance after Henry's first expedition in 1004, but it is now clear that Arduin's sphere of influence was restricted to a small part of Italy after that. He did, however, have continuing support in Pavia.\n\nArduin was born around 955 in Pombia during a period in which the Kingdom of Italy was struggling to maintain its independence from the ambitions of the Holy Roman Empire. Italy was conquered in 961 by Emperor Otto I, and the Italian King Berengar II was deposed. Arduin, Berengar's grand-nephew, was only a boy when this happened. Although Otto unified the crowns of Italy and Germany, this did not erase the influence of Berengar's Anscarid dynasty in northern Italy, as the March of Ivrea was inherited by Berengar's third son Conrad.\n\nIn the subsequent years, the political situation in Northern Italy was marked by the struggle between the bishops (who at the time were high-ranking nobles appointed by the Emperor himself to rule the largest fiefs, and who thus owed their fortune to their personal relationship with him) and the minor nobles, whose only source of livelihood were small, rural fiefs, and who were threatened by the expansionism of the bishops.\n\nArduin was born around 955 in Pombia and named after his maternal grandfather, Arduin Glaber. His father, Dado, Count of Pombia, was a nephew of King Berengar II. Arduin married Bertha, who is often said to be the daughter of Otbert II, Margrave of Milan. They had three sons: Arduin (sometimes called Ardicino), Otto, and Guibert. From them descended the later counts of Ivrea and in turn those of Agliè, Brosso, Castellamonte, Front and Rivarolo.\n\nIn 990, Arduin succeeded his kinsman Conrad in the March of Ivrea. Conrad was Berengar II's son and was married to a daughter of Arduin Glaber. It is unclear if Arduin was appointed to Ivrea by the king–emperor Otto III or if he succeeded as Conrad's heir. The March of Ivrea, since its restructuring under Berengar II in 950, consisted of the counties of Burgaria, Ivrea, Lomello, Ossola, Pombia, Stazzona and Vercelli, and the dioceses of Ivrea, Novara, Vercelli, and Vigevano, plus part of the dioceses Pavia and Milan. Arduin became Count of the Sacred Palace of the Lateran in Rome in 991.\n\nDuring his rule in Ivrea, Arduin backed the claims of the monastic orders and of the minor nobles, a policy that inevitably led to clashes with the imperially appointed bishops. The hostility turned into open conflict in the year 997, when the Emperor Otto III granted to Pietro, Bishop of Vercelli, the fief of Caresana. Arduin did not recognise the donation. There were riots in the city of Vercelli between the knights and the bishop's followers, during which the bishop was killed. Arduin intervened in the city, formally to restore order; during the clashes, the cathedral, where the bishop had been interred, was burned. The bishop-count Warmund of Ivrea condemned Arduin for the killing of Pietro, excommunicated him, and obtained from the Emperor a proclamation that the city of Ivrea, along with the land for three miles outside the walls, was free from Arduin's rule.\n\nIn the year 1000 Arduin was in Rome to explain his position to the newly appointed Pope Sylvester II. Otto III was also present in the city, and Warmund and Leone, successor of Pietro as the bishop of Vercelli, probably were as well, and the pope confirmed Arduin's excommunication and demanded he abdicate to his title in favor of his son. Arduin did not accept the sentence. He returned in his lands, and, instead of abdicating, expelled Warmund from Ivrea and rapidly conquered the cities of Vercelli and Novara, while his followers took control of Como and several cities of the Piedmont.\n\nAt that point a clash with the Emperor seemed inevitable, but Otto III suddenly died near Rome on 23 January 1002 without leaving a direct heir, throwing the empire into a succession crisis. On 15 February, a diet of feudal lords and knights in Pavia acclaimed Arduin King of Italy. According to the chronicler Arnulf of Milan, Arduin was \"elected by the Lombards in Pavia and was called 'caesar' [emperor] by all\". He then made the rounds of the kingdom with the Archbishop of Milan publicly at his side. However, while Arduin had the loyalty of the minor nobles, that of the bigger landlords, more tied to the imperial power, was much more questionable, and opposition to his rule was instigated by the bishops, led by Frederick, Archbishop of Ravenna.\n\nIn Germany, Henry II was acclaimed king on 7 June 1002, and he did not recognize Arduin's coronation. Henry granted the March of Verona to Duke Otto I of Carinthia, and then sent Otto to Italy to depose Arduin; but in the spring of 1003, Arduin defeated Otto in a pitched battle at Fabrica near the Brenta River.\n\nThis was only the beginning. Henry personally invaded Italy with a large force that left Germany in March 1004 and arrived at Trento on 9 April 1004. He met Arduin outside Verona, where Arduin was disappointed by a poor showing from his erstwhile supporters. Henry entered Pavia, the traditional Lombard capital, and had himself crowned King of Italy on 14 May in San Michele in the face of a disapproving crowd. Then he burned the city that had given shelter to Arduin to the ground. This had its effect: \"All of Italy was horrified by this and likewise extremely fearful. As confidence in Arduin waned from this time on, Henry's power prevailed everywhere.\"\n\nAt this point, Henry was satisfied by his formal recognition as ruler of Italy and returned to Germany in the early summer of 1004. Arduin had withdrawn to his stronghold in the Orco Valley, and Henry chose not to pursue him with the main body of his army. Some imperial forces besieged the valley until the winter 1004-1005 but then withdrew; afterwards, Arduin rapidly regained control of all of his previous possessions.\n\nArduin's rule lasted until 1014, when Henry descended into Italy again, this time to be crowned Holy Roman Emperor in Rome by Pope Benedict VIII. There were several skirmishes between Henry's army and Arduin's followers, both in Rome and as Henry began to withdraw back into Germany. But at that point the old king, probably sick and tired, chose to abdicate the Italian throne. He secured the possession of the main part of the March of Ivrea for his son Arduin II (the March was dissolved, but the younger Arduin was appointed Count of Ivrea), renounced all of his titles, and retired to the Benedectine Abbey of Fruttuaria, which he had founded in 1003. He died there on 14 December 1015.\n\nArduin's coinage was designed to resemble that of Otto III as closely as possible. Unusually, the character ∂, a rounded minuscule D, was used in his name to make it resemble Otto's monogram. Two types of \"denarius\", both minted at Pavia, are known for Arduin. The first bears the inscription (Arduin king) on the obverse and (emperor) on the reverse. It is not clear if the latter is simply a holdover from Otto III's coinage or represents Arduin's anticipation of a future imperial coronation. The second type reads (Arduin in the grace of God king) and (Pavia glorious city). Arduin may have been able to mint coins in Pavia after Henry returned to Germany in 1004. There are no known coins of Henry II from the period before 1014, although coins of Otto III may have continued to be struck in the confusion.\n\n"}

He played for the Cleveland Browns from 1999 to 2012 and holds their franchise record for most field goals made, passing Hall of Famer Lou Groza in 2010. He played college football at Texas. He also played for the San Francisco 49ers from 2013-2016, and the Arizona Cardinals in 2017 and 2018. He signed a contract in 2019 to retire as a member of the team that he started with, the Cleveland Browns.\n\nDawson attended Lake Highlands High School in Dallas, Texas and was a letterman in football. In a 1992 playoff game at Texas Stadium against Nacogdoches High School, Dawson kicked a 52-yard field goal as time expired to beat Nacogdoches 31-28. He graduated in the class of 1993; the Baltimore Ravens placekicker Matt Stover attended the same high school, graduating in 1986. As a senior, he was a starter at both kicker and offensive tackle until he hurt his knee in a preseason scrimmage. He thought he might have to have season-ending surgery, but he gutted it out, stuck to kicking, and was named as an All-American and the Southwest Region Offensive Player of the Year by SuperPrep.\n\nDawson attended the University of Texas at Austin, where he was a four-year letterman in football. After redshirting his freshman year, he scored 80 points his first year of playing. He also tied a school record with 54 consecutive extra points. The following season, he made honorary All-America honors while leading the Longhorns in scoring. He made first-team All-America his junior and senior years, while simultaneously making All-Big 12. He earned a B.A. in political science. Dawson is famous for his 1995 game-winning field goal against the University of Virginia, booting a 50-yarder against a 30-MPH wind to give Texas a dramatic 17-16 victory as time expired.\n\nDawson was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Oakland Raiders, who then waived him. He was picked up by the New England Patriots and assigned to the practice squad, but never appeared in a game for them.\n\nThe Cleveland Browns signed him as a free agent in March 1999, and he remained with the team for 14 years until he joined the San Francisco 49ers in 2013. (He was the only player left from the 1999 Browns squad). Dawson holds the Browns record for most consecutive field goals made (29) and most field goals in a game (6). Dawson is currently the 7th most accurate kicker in the NFL. On October 10, 2010, Dawson tied Lou Groza for the Browns' career field-goal record with 234. \n\nDawson scored the first points in the history of the \"new\" Cleveland Browns in 1999. On October 10 of that year, he scored the only touchdown of his career on a fake field goal against the Bengals in an 18-17 loss. \n\nOn November 17, 2008, Dawson hit a 56-yard field game-winning field goal against the Buffalo Bills on Monday Night Football. \n\nDawson would have become an unrestricted free agent at the end of the 2010 season, but he was given the franchise tag on February 22, keeping him for the 2011 season.\n\nDawson signed with the San Francisco 49ers on March 19, 2013. He made a career record 27 consecutive field goals during the 2013 season, until the streak was snapped by a 24-yard field goal miss against the Arizona Cardinals in Week 17. He finished his first year in San Francisco with the second-most points (140) and field goals (32-of-36) in the team's history. Dawson kicked the game-winning field goal in the 49ers Wild Card playoff game against the Green Bay Packers on January 5, 2014, giving the 49ers a 23-20 victory.\n\nOn September 26, 2013, Dawson attempted and missed a 71-yard fair catch kick in the last seconds of the second quarter of a game against the St. Louis Rams.\n\nOn March 11, 2014, Dawson signed a new two-year contract to remain with the 49ers.\n\nDawson re-signed with the 49ers on a one-year contract on March 12, 2016. He made his 400th career field goal on November 20, 2016 against the Patriots.\n\nOn March 10, 2017, Dawson signed a two-year contract with the Arizona Cardinals.\n\nOn September 10, 2017, in the season opening 35–23 loss to the Detroit Lions, Dawson made his debut as a Cardinal. He converted two extra points and a field goal in the loss.\n\nOn September 17, 2017, Dawson converted three field goals, including a 40-yarder to force overtime and a 30-yarder in overtime to win, in the 16–13 victory over the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nOn November 26, 2017, Dawson hit a 57-yard field goal with one second left to beat the favored Jacksonville Jaguars. It was the longest made field goal of Dawson's career (although he made a 59-yard field goal during a 2010 preseason game with the Browns). He converted four field goals in the game, including the 57-yard game-winner, earning him NFC Special Teams Player of the Week.\n\nDawson became the 11th player in NFL history to appear in 300 career games.\n\nOn November 26, 2018, Dawson was placed on injured reserve with a hip injury.\n\nDawson announced his retirement after 21 seasons on August 1, 2019, after signing a one-day ceremonial contract with the Browns to retire as a member of the team. After Dawson’s retirement, Adam Vinatieri became the sole remaining active player from the 1990s.\n\nDawson had a rule named after him after a missed call by referees. On November 18, 2007, Dawson attempted a 51-yard field goal in the closing seconds of the fourth quarter to tie the game against the Baltimore Ravens. The kick carried through the air and hit the left upright and then the rear curved support post (stanchion), which bounced the football over the crossbar and into the end zone, in front of the goalpost. The kick was originally ruled no good. Under NFL rules, the play was not reviewable. Officials discussed the play among themselves for several minutes and decided that, since the ball had indeed crossed the crossbar within the goal, whatever happened afterward to the ball did not matter. The kick was considered good, as announced by referee Pete Morelli. However, as the play is not technically reviewable, referee Pete Morelli announced that the play was reversed \"after discussion,\" as opposed to \"after further review,\" as is usually stated. At this point the Ravens, already celebrating in the locker room (they would have won 30-27 if the field goal was no good), were called back out onto the field to proceed to an overtime period. The Browns went on to win the game, 33-30 in overtime, as Dawson came through again with a more visible 33-yard field goal. Dawson finished 4 for 5 in FGs whereas fellow Lake Highlands High School alumnus Matt Stover finished 3 for 3 in FGs for the Ravens.\n\nNotably, later in the season on December 16, in driving snow and wind gusts up to 40 mph, Dawson kicked another field goal, an improbable 49-yarder, that hit the same center support post. This field goal helped the Browns achieve an 8-0 win over the Buffalo Bills in blizzard conditions. Hitting this same structure twice in the same season has led some members of the Cleveland press to begin referring to the support post as \"The Dawson Bar.\"\n\nPrior to the 2008 season, the rule was changed to allow field goal and extra point attempts that hit the uprights or crossbar to be reviewed. This new rule is dubbed the \"Phil Dawson Rule.\"\n\nDawson resides in Austin, Texas with his wife, Shannon, and 3 kids, Dru, Beau, and Sophiann. As of 2018, Dru is the starting varsity QB at Vandegrift High School as a junior while other son Beau is also on the varsity as a freshman backup. Dawson kicks right-footed but throws left-handed. His wife Shannon is a singer-songwriter and produced her first album \"Redemption\" in 2013.\n\nOn March 6, 2020, Dawson was named Special Teams Coordinator at Lipscomb Academy in Nashville, TN.\n\n"}
{"id": "2187568", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2187568", "title": "1999 Pacific hurricane season", "text": "1999 Pacific hurricane season\n\nThe 1999 Pacific hurricane season was one of the least active Pacific hurricane seasons on record. The season officially began on May 15 in the Eastern Pacific, and on June 1 in the Central Pacific; in both basins, it ended on November 30. These dates conventionally delimit the period during which most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. The first tropical cyclone of the season, Hurricane Adrian, developed on June 18, while the final storm of the season, Tropical Storm Irwin, dissipated on October 11. No storms developed in the Central Pacific during the season. However, two storms from the Eastern Pacific, Dora and Eugene, entered the basin, with the former entering as a hurricane.\n\nThe season produced fourteen tropical cyclones and nine named storms, which was well below the average of sixteen named storms per season; this was largely due to a strong La Niña taking over much of the Pacific. However, the total of six hurricanes and two major hurricanes during the season was near the averages of eight and three, respectively. Although it remained offshore, Hurricane Adrian caused 6 deaths from flooding and rough surf in Mexico. Hurricane Dora was a long-lived and intense cyclone, which had the second longest track of a Pacific hurricane on record. The storm brought minor impacts to the island of Hawaii; however, no deaths or damage was reported. The deadliest tropical cyclone, Hurricane Greg, killed 10 people from flooding in Mexico.\n\nThe 1999 Pacific hurricane season officially started on May 15, 1999 in the eastern Pacific, and on June 1, 1999, in the central Pacific, and lasted until November 30, 1999. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. The 1999 Pacific hurricane season was well below average, due to the strong La Niña that was occurring at the time, which causes wind shear to be increased and water temperatures to decrease, resulting in conditions less conductive for tropical cyclones in the East Pacific. There were 14 cyclones in total, including 5 unnamed tropical depressions. Of these, 9 became a tropical storm, while 6 reached hurricane status. Further, 2 of these became major hurricanes, which is Category 3 intensity or higher on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale.\n\nTropical cyclogenesis began with Hurricane Adrian, which developed on June 18. Although it remained offshore, Adrian brought rough surf and flooding to Mexico, which resulted in 6 fatalities. The storm peaked as a Category 2 before dissipating on June 22. No other tropical cyclones formed in June. Activity halted until July 9, when Hurricane Beatriz developed. Though it peaked as a Category 3 hurricane before dissipating on July 17, the storm caused no damage on land because it remained well offshore. The next system, a short-lived Tropical Depression Three-E, did not result in impact as a tropical cyclone, though the precursor brought heavy rainfall and gusty winds to Central America. Tropical Depression Four-E, was the first of three cyclones to cross into the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility, which is between 140°W and the International Date Line. Two other short-lived system in July, Tropical Storm Calvin and Tropical Depression Six-E, caused no damage.\n\nIn August, Hurricane Dora, the strongest storm of the 1999 Pacific hurricane season, produced gusty winds and large waves on Johnston Atoll and the island of Hawaii, though minimal damage was left in its wake. After crossing the International Date Line on August 20, Dora became the first tropical cyclones to exist in all three basins of the North Pacific – Eastern, Central, and Western – since Hurricane John in 1994. Hurricane Eugene also existed in the Eastern and Central Pacific, but dissipated on August 15 while south of the main Hawaiian Islands, well before reaching the International Date Line. Nonetheless, it produced up to of rainfall on the Big Island of Hawaii. In the remainder of August, there was a series of short-lived tropical cyclones that did not effect land, including Tropical Depression Nine-E, Tropical Storm Fernanda, and Tropical Depression Eleven-E.\n\nDuring the month of September, the deadliest tropical cyclone of the season, Hurricane Greg, was spawned near the Pacific coast of Mexico. Greg which killed 10 people when it made landfall on southern Baja California. The hurricane and its precursor produced heavy rainfall across much of Mexico, with the highest total reaching 22.23 in (566.9 mm). The heavy rains damaged or destroyed more than 2,000 homes. The remnant moisture from the system, combined with an area of low pressure, resulted in strong thunderstorms across California, which led to numerous power outages, damage to homes and vehicles, and started many wildfires. The other in the month of September was Hurricane Hilary, a storm that approached Baja California, but dissipated offshore on September 21, resulting in no impact. The final system, Tropical Storm Irwin, produced scattered areas of heavy rainfall over Mexico in October, but caused no significant flooding. It dissipated on October 11, over a month and a half before the official end of the season on November 30.\n\nIn addition to the systems observed by the CPHC and NHC, a tropical depression formed east of the International Dateline on August 19, and quickly exited CPHC's area of responsibility; however, this storm was not included into CPHC database.\n\nA broad area of low pressure developed into Tropical Depression One at 0600 UTC on June 18, while situated 290 miles (465 km) southeast of Acapulco, Guerrero. Moving towards west-northwestward, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Adrian about 12 hours later. Favorable levels of wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures (SST's) caused the storm to strengthen further. Early on June 20 Adrian intensified into a hurricane, while located about 420 miles (680 km) south-southeast of the southern tip of Baja California. About 24 hours later, Adrian reached its peak intensity with winds of 100 mph (155 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 973 mbar (28.73 inHg).\n\nAfter reaching peak intensity on June 21, Adrian began weakening due to colder SST's and higher wind shear. Adrian fell to tropical storm status late on June 21, and further weakened to a tropical depression on June 22. Six hours later at 1800 UTC, Adrian degenerated into a swirl of low clouds while situated 300 mi (480 km) southwest of the southern tip of Baja California. Heavy rainfall produced from the storm caused minor flooding throughout Mexico. Two fatalities were directly attributed to the floods, while another person was listed as missing. Four other people were killed when they drowned in rough seas produced offshore the Mexican coastline. There is no damage estimate from the heavy rainfall or rough seas associated with the hurricane.\n\nA tropical wave developed into by 0600 UTC on July 9, while situated roughly 300 mi (480 km) south of Lázaro Cárdenas, Mexico. At this time, the depression was in an environment of strong upper-tropospheric outflow, resulting in gradual intensification. The depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Beatriz at 1200 UTC on July 9. Steady strengthened continued and about 48 hours later, Beatriz became a Category 1 while situated roughly 560 miles (900 km) south-southwest of Cabo San Lucas. Moving westward around the southern periphery of a ridge to the north, it continued to intensify. A well-defined eye became visible on satellite imagery early on July 12. Microwave imagery a few hours later revealed that Beatriz was likely undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle and was complete by 1700 UTC.\n\nFurther intensification occurred, and Beatriz became the first major hurricane of the season at 1800 UTC on July 12. At 0600 UTC the following day, the hurricane attained its peak intensity with winds of 115 mph (195 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 955 mbar (28.20 inHg) while situated roughly 800 miles (1300 km) southwest of Cabo San Lucas. Curving towards the west-northwest, Beatriz began to encounter an area of cooler sea surface temperatures, which led to gradual weakening. The hurricane weakened to a tropical storm at 0000 UTC on July 16, and further to a tropical depression by 1800 UTC that day. At 0600 UTC on July 17, Beatriz degenerated into a swirl of clouds.\n\nA tropical wave moved across the Atlantic and Caribbean in early July. While crossing Central America on July 11 and July 12, the system produced gusty winds and heavy rainfall, especially in Honduras, Nicaragua, and Mexico, where precipitation reached in Coyutla, Veracruz. By July 13, the wave and associated low pressure area emerged into the Pacific Ocean. The system organized further and developed into Tropical Depression Three-E at 1200 UTC on July 14, while located about west-southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico. It initially headed west-northwestward until July 15, when it curved west-southwestward. The depression failed to strengthen further and dissipated at 1800 UTC on July 15, while located about southwest of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico.\n\nOn July 15, a tropical wave entered the eastern Pacific Ocean. Over the following days, slow organization occurred, and it is estimated that the system became developed into Tropical Depression Four-E at 0000 UTC on July 23. Later that day, the depression reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 35 mph (55 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 1007 mbar (29.74 inHg), having failed to reach tropical storm status. While moving westward, the depression entered the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility on July 24. By this time, however, the depression was already becoming disorganized and dissipated early on the following day.\n\nA tropical wave crossed the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea between early and mid-July. Later in the month, the wave acquired a low-level circulation. Thus, Tropical Depression Five-E developed at 0600 UTC on July 25, while situated about south-southwest of Cabo San Lucas. Due to further organization on satellite imagery, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Calvin six hours later. However, wind shear exposed the low-level circulation and halted intensification. Calvin continued west-northwestward as a sheared cyclone.\n\nAccording to satellite classifications, it is estimated that Calvin weakened back to a tropical depression at 0600 UTC on July 26. There was a convective burst late on July 26, though the storm did not re-strengthen. Around that time, Calvin turned northwestward in response to a mid-tropospheric trough. The burst in convection did not persist and the depression dissipated by 1200 UTC on July 27, while located well west-southwest of Baja California. A low-cloud swirl remained and subsequently continued on a west-northwesterly course for a few days.\n\nA tropical wave that previously crossed the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea reached the eastern Pacific basin until late July. The system developed a surface circulation on July 26, while microwave imagery data indicated wind speeds of . As a result, it is estimated that Tropical Depression Six-E developed at 1800 UTC, while located nearly west-southwest of the southern tip of Baja California and about southwest of Tropical Depression Calvin. The depression moved toward the west-northwest and encountered strong vertical wind-shear. Despite a few convective bursts, the depression remained weak and degenerated into a swirl of low clouds at 0000 UTC on July 28.\nA tropical wave moved off Africa on July 23 and crossed the Atlantic Ocean without development. However, the wave quickly increased in organization after entering the Eastern Pacific Ocean on August 4, and was designated Tropical Depression Seven-E on August 6. The depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Dora later that day. Dora continued to intensify despite upper-level wind shear, and became a hurricane on August 8. Shortly after, the hurricane moved westward into a more favorable environment and began to intensify more quickly, reaching Category 4 strength on August 10. It maintained that intensity for three days as it moved almost due west.\n\nDora weakened to Category 1 strength as it entered the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility on August 14. However, it briefly restrengthened into a Category 3 as it passed south of Hawaii on August 16. Dora then began weakening for the final time as it passed south of Johnston Atoll on August 18. At the atoll, Dora produced large waves and wind gusts between 40 and 45 mph (75 and 85 km/h). In Hawaii, heavy surf on the Big Island forced the closure of beaches, campsites, and hiking trails in the districts of Kau and Puna. On August 20, Dora crossed the International Date Line, shortly before weakening to a tropical storm. Due to vertical wind shear, it did not re-strengthen in the western Pacific basin. The storm weakened and fell to tropical depression intensity early on August 22. Dora dissipated late on the following day, while situated several hundred miles east of Wake Island.\n\nA tropical wave crossed Central America between July 28 and July 29, before entering the Pacific Ocean and slowly organizing. After the cloud pattern consolidated, it is estimated that Tropical Depression Eight-E developed at 0600 UTC on August 6, while located about southwest of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. Twelve hours later, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Eugene. It continued to deepen, reaching hurricane status late on August 8. About 24 hours later, Eugene peaked as a strong Category 2 hurricane with winds of 110 mph (175 km/h). The storm began to weaken and was downgraded to a Category 1 hurricane early on August 11.\n\nEugene continued westward, and on August 11, it entered the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility. It continued to weaken and was downgraded to a tropical storm early on August 13. Eugene passed south of the Hawaiian Islands on August 14, with minimal impact noted. Minor surf occurred along the east and southeast shores of the Big Island. Additionally, 24‑hour rainfall totals over windward sections of Maui and the Big Island were near . The storm weakened to a tropical depression by late on August 14. At 0000 UTC on August 16, Eugene dissipated while located about southeast of Johnston Atoll. \n\nA tropical wave moved off the African coast on July 27 and entered the Pacific Ocean on August 6. The system continued westward without development until August 11, when convection began to increase. By 1200 UTC on August 13, the National Hurricane Center began classifying the system as Tropical Depression Nine-E. Due easterly wind shear, the depression did not further intensify as it moved on a generally west-northwesterly track. The depression had dissipated by August 15.\n\nA tropical wave developed into Tropical Depression Ten-E at 0600 UTC on August 17, while located about in south-southwest of Socorro Island, Mexico. The depression intensified gradually due to favorable conditions. At 0000 UTC on August 18, the cyclone was upgraded to Tropical Storm Fernanda while centered about southwest of Socorro Island. The storm continued to slowly strengthened and 1200 UTC on August 19, Fernanda attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 65 mph (100 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of .\n\nAround the time of peak intensity on August 19, Fernanda curved west-southwest track, a motion which persisted for the remainder of its duration. While this track carried the storm over warmer SST's, increasing easterly wind shear caused Fernanda to weaken. By early on August 21, Fernanda weakened to a tropical depression. After weakening slightly further, the storm degenerated into a remnant low cloud swirl at 0000 UTC on August 23. The remnants of Fernanda persisted until finally losing its identity about west-southwest of Socorro Island on August 28.\n\nA tropical wave entered the eastern Pacific on August 15 and formed a surface low pressure area south of Mexico on August 19. After consolidating and organizing somewhat, the system became Tropical Depression Eleven-E late on August 23. However, colder SST's caused convection to diminish almost immediately, while moving parallel to the southern coast of Baja California. as thunderstorm activity slowly decreased due to cool SST's. By 1200 UTC on August 24, the depression dissipated just west of the tip of Baja California, having lasted for less than 24 hours. The highest rainfall total reported in Mexico was at Los Cabos, Baja California Sur.\nThe northern portion of a tropical wave in the Atlantic spawned Tropical Storm Emily, while the southern portion headed westward and crossed Central America between August 31 and September 1. Thereafter, the system emerged into the Pacific Ocean and began to organize. By 1200 UTC on September 5, Tropical Depression Twelve-E developed near Manzanillo, Mexico. Six hours later, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Greg. Further intensification occurred, and late on September 6, Greg was upgraded to a hurricane as winds reached 75 mph (120 km/h). However, Greg weakened to a tropical storm on September 7, while approaching Baja California. At 2100 UTC that day, it made landfall near Cabo San Lucas. The storm then curved westward and weakened over colder SST's, until dissipating on late September 9.\n\nBoth Gerg and its predecessor disturbance brought heavy rain to much of Mexico. The highest report was of 22.23 inches (566.9 mm) in Tecomán, Colima. Precipitation from Greg caused flooding in the states of Colima, Michoacán, Sinaloa, Nayarit, and Jalisco. It was most severe along the Los Mezcales River. The flooding killed ten people. In addition, 2,000 people were rendered homeless and 2,000 others were affected in some way. The remnants of Greg produced thunderstorms in California, particularly the San Francisco Bay Area. As a result, there was widespread power outages and isolated damage to houses and vehicles, as well as causing several small wildfires. Overall damage was relatively limited, however.\n\nA tropical wave moved off the coast of western Africa into the Atlantic Ocean on August 29. It continued to move westward through the tropical waters of the Atlantic into the Caribbean. It still remained a tropical wave as it moved over Central America and began to acquire more convection and organization, from September 10 through September 11. Visible satellite imagery showed low level circulation and more organized deep convection as it became a tropical depression on September 17, while located about south-southeast of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula.\n\nThe system strengthened and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Hilary at 1200 UTC on September 18. Due to the development of an eye feature and large increase in deep convection, Hilary was upgraded to hurricane on September 20, while located about southwest of the Baja California Peninsula. However, later that day, Hilary weakened back to a tropical storm. The storm fell further to tropical depression status on September 21. Hours later, the storm degenerated into a swirl of low-level clouds, as it bypassed Baja California on September 21.\n\nThe southern portion of the tropical wave that previously spawned Tropical Depression Eleven in the Gulf of Mexico entered the Pacific Ocean in early October. After becoming better organized, the system developed into Tropical Depression Fourteen-E at 1200 UTC on October 8, while situated about south-southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico. The depression initially moved slowly north-northwestward and strengthened into Tropical Storm Irwin about six hours later. After a strong mid-tropospheric ridge developed over northern Mexico, Irwin moved northwestward and remained offshore Mexico.\n\nEarly on October 9, the center of the storm passed within about of the coastline between Manzanillo and Cabo Corrientes. The storm then curved west-northwestward and at 1800 UTC on October 9, Irwin attained peaked with winds of 60 mph (95 km/h). Stable air and increasing wind shear caused Irwin to weaken and fall to tropical depression intensity early on October 11. About 12 hours later, the storm dissipated while located about southwest of Cabo San Lucas. While passing offshore, Irwin brought patches of heavy rainfall to some areas of Mexico, peaking at in Coahuayutla de Guerrero, Guerrero.\nThe following names were used for named storms in the Pacific in 1999. This is the same list used in the 1993 season. No new names were used for the first time in the Pacific Basin. No storms were retired during the season, thus this same list was used again in the 2005 season.\nFor storms that form in the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility, encompassing the area between 140°W and the International Date Line, all names are used in a series of four rotating lists. The next four names that were slated for use in 1999 are shown below, however none of them were used.\n\nThis is a table of all the storms that have formed in the 1999 Pacific hurricane season. It includes their duration, names, landfall(s), denoted in parentheses, damages, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all the damage figures are in 1999 USD.\n\n\n"}

It is a local icon for its historical context, as well as modern musical performances and gymnastics. It has a maximum capacity of 1,500. \n\nLocated below the auditorium is the Sokol Underground, where numerous concert promoters such as Hunt Industries host many rock and hip hop concerts.\n\nSokol Auditorium was built in 1926 at the corner of South 13th Street and Martha Street to house many of Omaha's Czech community’s social activities. Sokols were fraternal (and sororal) organizations founded in Bohemia to promote equality, harmony, and fraternity. As one of four in Omaha, the Sokol Auditorium was utilized for meetings by twenty-five Bohemian lodges as well as ethnic Italians and American groups. The hall also offered recreation classes for its members.\n\nThe Sokol Auditorium in Omaha was one of many such buildings built as part of the Sokol movement. In 1862, a highly educated young intellectual, Dr. Miroslav Tyrš (1832-1884) founded Sokol. His goal was to develop physically strong and mentally alert citizens, and to instill in them a deep love for national freedom from volunteer exercise and discipline.\n\nSokols have been prominent in the Olympic Games for many years. Sokol Omaha sent Phil Cahoy and James Hartung as members of the 1980 Olympic team; Hartung competed again in 1984.\n\nThe Sokol Auditorium has been mentioned specifically in a number of songs from the last twenty years. The Faint mentions the Sokol in the song, \"Amorous in Bauhaus Fashion,\" from the album Media. They Might Be Giants wrote the song, \"Sokol Auditorium,\" about the venue. Neva Dinova's music video for \"Yellow Datsun,\" was filmed at the Auditorium, and Johnny Rioux of the Street Dogs collapsed on stage on February 27, 2007 of an apparent seizure while his band was opening for Flogging Molly.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2187581", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2187581", "title": "Daniel Spill", "text": "Daniel Spill\n\nDaniel Spill (11 February 1832 – 1887) was born in Winterbourne, Gloucestershire, England. He became a rubber and an early thermoplastics manufacturer. For over 20 years Spill had pursued the goal of making a successful business from Alexander Parkes' invention Parkesine, the first man-made plastic.\n\nAlthough he trained as a doctor he joined the business of his brother George. The firm of George Spill & Co. manufactured waterproof textiles in Stepney Green, East London by spreading rubber onto cloth. The material was much in demand for capes and groundsheets for soldiers in the wet conditions of the Crimean War.\n\nSpill became aware of Parkes' claim for the waterproof qualities of Parkesine probably at the 1862 exhibition. Negotiations led to an agreement not only to use it for waterproofing but also to develop Parkesine in the works of George Spill at Hackney Wick. A provisional patent was granted in 1863 to the Spill brothers and Thomas James Briggs concerning \"improvements in the manufacture of driving straps or bands and of flexible tubes or hose\"\n\nIn 1866, the Parkesine Company was established with Daniel Spill as works manager and Parkes as managing director. The Company did not prosper and was wound up in 1868, Spill taking over most of the stock. He formed the Xylonite Company in 1869 to carry on the business but that did not fare much better and was wound up in 1874.\n\nUndaunted by these failures, Spill established Daniel Spill & Co. in Homerton, continuing to make Xylonite and Ivoride. This enterprise succeeded in that others entered into an agreement with Spill in 1877 to form the British Xylonite Company in purpose-built premises at Brantham. This company did go on and prosper, going on to employ 1,160 people by 1902 and changed its name to BX Plastics.\n\nSpill's later years were largely occupied in a long legal battle in America with John Wesley Hyatt and the Celluloid Manufacturing Company for infringement of his patents. The lawsuit which was filed in 1875, was first found in his favour in 1880 even after Parkes testified on behalf of Hyatt, but reversed in 1884. Spill returned to England and in 1887 died of diabetes at the age of 55.\n\nHe married at the age of 18; his bride was 15. In 1881 Spill was listed as a retired manufacturer in the 1881 census of Leyton High Street, living with his wife and daughter and his nephew George, an India Rubber Manufacturer.\n\n"}
{"id": "2187585", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2187585", "title": "1998 Pacific hurricane season", "text": "1998 Pacific hurricane season\n\nThe 1998 Pacific hurricane season was a below average Pacific hurricane season. It had six major hurricanes, which was well above average. The season officially started on May 15 in the eastern Pacific and on June 1 in the central Pacific, and ended on November 30; these dates conventionally delimit the period during which most tropical cyclones form in that region. The first tropical cyclone developed on June 11, about ten days later than the normal start of the season. The final storm of the year, Hurricane Madeline, dissipated on October 20. Storm activity in the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's warning zone was low, with just one tropical depression observed in the region. Two tropical cyclones from the eastern Pacific (Darby and Estelle) also entered the central Pacific; the former did so as a hurricane.\n\nThe most notable tropical cyclone of the year was Hurricane Isis, which killed fourteen people when it made landfall on southern Baja California Sur and coastal Sinaloa in Mexico. Isis caused considerable damage in the nation while destroying more than 700 homes and damaging dozens of cars. It later produced sporadic rainfall in the southwestern United States, leading to some traffic accidents. In addition to Isis, Tropical Storm Javier moved ashore the coast of Jalisco in Mexico; the nation experienced indirect effects from four other storms, all of which remained offshore. One tropical cyclone, Hurricane Lester, affected Central America, causing two deaths in Guatemala. Three tropical cyclones brought light to moderate rainfall to the southwestern United States, and one hurricane produced rough surf along the coast of California. Hurricane Madeline contributed to a deadly and costly flood in southern Texas.\n\nThe season produced 13 named storms, slightly below the average of 15 named storms per season. However, the season total of nine hurricanes was one above the average, and the total of six major hurricanes surpassed the average of three. Activity during the season was hindered by the northward movement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). The ITCZ, which is normally situated south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec, shifted northward into Central and Southern Mexico, making the cyclone closer to cooler sea surface temperatures, hence limiting the number of storms that formed during the season. Although a semi-permanent anticyclone persisted through the summer of 1998, causing most of the storms to remain at sea, some storm did threaten the Baja California Peninsula due to a weakness in the anticyclone. Except for Hurricane Kay, all of the storms of the season originated from tropical waves.\nAccumulated Cyclone Energy is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of a storm multiplied by its duration, so longer-lived hurricanes have higher ACEs. The total ACE for the season was 133.97 × 10 kt. Because several storms in 1998 were long-lasting or intense, the season's ACE was near-normal. Hurricane Howard had the highest ACE, measuring 29.27 x 10 kt.\n\nA poorly defined tropical wave crossed Central America into the eastern Pacific Ocean on June 8. As it tracked westward under the influence of a ridge to its north, a broad circulation developed. Gradually, the dominant center of circulation became better defined, with increasingly organized convection and developing banding features. By early on June 11, the center became sufficiently associated with the convection for the National Hurricane Center (NHC) to classify the system as Tropical Depression One-E. This occurred while the area of unsettled weather was about 460 miles (765 km) south-southwest of Acapulco, Mexico.\n\nThe center of the depression was not initially well defined, with restricted outflow in the eastern half of the circulation. As such, the depression failed to attain any significant organization in the days subsequent to its formation. Later, an approaching tropical wave merged with the depression, resulting in a trend of intensification and increased organization. By June 13, the NHC upgraded the depression to tropical storm status, and gave it the name \"Agatha\". Agatha was about 650 miles (1050 km) south-southeast of Cabo San Lucas when it became a tropical storm. As Agatha became a tropical storm, forecasters predicted that it would not strengthen further, due to its forecast track passing over cooler waters. However, Agatha quickly strengthened, developing a curved band of convection wrapping around its center, and early on June 11 it attained a peak intensity of 65 mph (100 km/h) while about 615 miles (985 km) southwest of the southern tip of Baja California. Agatha maintained peak winds for about 12 hours before moving over colder waters and gradually weakening. On June 15, it degenerated back into a tropical depression, and a day later, it dissipated over the open waters of the Pacific Ocean. The storm never affected land.\n\nA few days later, another westward-moving tropical disturbance paralleled the southern coast of Central America and Mexico. Convection in the area organized steadily, and late on June 19, the system developed into Tropical Depression Two-E about 260 miles (420 km) south-southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico. On becoming a tropical depression, the system maintained a large, elongated, low-level circulation with some banding features and restricted outflow due to wind shear. The National Hurricane Center first predicted that the depression would intensify, reaching winds of 50 mph (80 km/h), though two computer models projected it to quickly dissipate. Under the influence of a ridge over Mexico, the depression moved to the west-northwest, and, under the influence of increasing wind shear, the depression failed to organize significantly. By June 20, the circulation center was partially exposed, and was located to the northeast of the primary convection – traits that signal a weak storm. Two-E approached tropical storm status, though deep convection waned after the system moved over cooler waters. On June 21, the National Hurricane Center issued the last advisory on the depression, stating that the depression maintained a very well-defined, low-level circulation, but had no convection associated with the system. Locally heavy rains fell across southwest Mexico in association with this system, peaking at at Las Gaviotas/Compostela.\n\nOn June 8, a tropical wave emerged off the coast of Africa. The wave remained weak and nondescript as it crossed the Atlantic Ocean and entered the eastern Pacific Ocean on June 19. An area of convection developed and organized along the wave's axis, and the National Hurricane Center began to employ Dvorak classifications on June 20. Convective banding features increased as the broad circulation became better defined, and on June 22, the disturbance developed into Tropical Depression Three-E about 575 miles (925 km) south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. Well-defined steering currents resulted in a general west-northwestward movement. Deep convection concentrated near the center, and about 12 hours after becoming a tropical depression, the system strengthened into Tropical Storm Blas about 400 miles (640 km) south of Puerto Angel, Oaxaca.\n\nTropical Storm Blas continued to organize as it moved parallel to the Mexican coast. Banding features increased, and on June 23 the storm attained hurricane status about 345 miles (555 km) southwest of Acapulco. The next day, an eye developed and became apparent on satellite imagery, while upper-level outflow became better defined. Blas quickly strengthened and reached its peak intensity on June 25, with maximum sustained winds of 140 mph (225 km/h), while about 575 miles (925 km) south-southeast of the southern tip of Baja California. Temperatures warmed in the convection around the eye, though the eye remained visible for several days as Blas turned west under the influence of a ridge to its north. On June 28, it degenerated into a tropical storm after entering an area of cooler water. Blas weakened to a tropical depression on June 30, and a day later was considered to have dissipated due to a lack of convection near the center. A remnant low-level cloud swirl persisted for several days, passing well to the south of Hawaii on July 5 before dissipating. The Associated Press attributed 4 deaths from a mudslide in Michoacán to Blas. However, as the primary convection remained offshore, the National Hurricane Center did not consider the deaths related to the hurricane. The threat of Blas prompted officials in Acapulco to close the port to all navigation.\n\nOn July 1, another tropical wave emerged off the coast of Africa. It moved westward due to strong wind shear without further organization, and crossed Central America into the eastern Pacific Ocean on July 11. An area of organizing convection developed along the wave axis, and Dvorak classifications began on July 13, while the tropical wave was south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. The cloud pattern soon became disorganized, and the area of disturbed weather continued west-northwestward. On July 16, convection increased and organized into banding features; early on July 17, the system developed into Tropical Depression Four-E about 150 miles (240 km) south of Manzanillo, Mexico. Soon after becoming a tropical depression, the storm rapidly organized and intensified into Tropical Storm Celia six hours after becoming a tropical depression. The tropical storm initially moved northwestward, and briefly threatened southern Baja California. As a result, the government of Mexico issued a tropical storm warning on July 18 for La Paz southward. Shortly thereafter, a mid- to upper-level anticyclone turned Celia to the west-northwest and forced it to pass about 150 miles (240 km) south-southwest of Cabo San Lucas. On July 19, Celia attained maximum sustained winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) before moving over cooler waters and diminishing in convection. The storm degenerated into a tropical depression on July 20, and Celia dissipated early on July 21, well away from the Mexican coastline.\n\nThe precursor tropical disturbance produced locally heavy rainfall along the south coast of Mexico. Authorities in Mexico closed the port at Acapulco to small fishing and recreational boats, and advised larger craft to use caution. Damage from the storm, if any, is unknown.\n\nA tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on July 4. It tracked westward across the Atlantic Ocean with little increase in convection, and crossed Central America into the Pacific Ocean on July 16. Three days later, convection began to increase along the wave axis while the wave was well to the south of Acapulco, Mexico. On July 21, Dvorak classifications began as the cloud pattern displayed curvature on satellite images. Convective banding features gradually developed, and it is estimated that the system organized into Tropical Depression Five-E early on July 23 about 720 miles (1160 km) south of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula. Under the influence of a mid- to upper-level ridge to its north, the depression tracked west-northwestward. Convection became more concentrated as outflow organized further, and 18 hours after the depression first developed, it intensified into Tropical Storm Darby.\n\nLocated in an area conducive to further development, Darby attained hurricane status on July 24, subsequent to the development of a 17-mile (27 km)-wide eye. The eye became more distinct while surrounded by an area of deep convection, and on July 25 the hurricane reached peak winds of 115 mph (185 km/h) about 850 miles (1370 km) southwest of Cabo San Lucas. The eye soon disappeared on satellite imagery, believed to be from an eyewall replacement cycle, and Darby's winds weakened to about 105 mph (170 km/h). A 25-mile (40 km) eye next developed, and on July 26, the hurricane re-intensified to reach peak winds of 115 mph (185 km/h). For a 30-hour period, Darby attained the characteristics of an annular hurricane, retaining a well-defined structure with few banding features for an extended period. The hurricane began to weaken while entering an area of cooler water and increased wind shear, and after crossing into the jurisdiction of the Central Pacific Hurricane Center, Darby weakened to a tropical storm on July 29. The storm degenerated into a tropical depression on July 31, and early on August 1, Darby dissipated a moderate distance north of the Hawaiian Islands. It never affected land.\n\nOn July 18, a tropical wave exited the western coast of Africa, and moved westward across the Atlantic Ocean with sporadic convection but no development. The wave moved across the Caribbean Sea and the southern Gulf of Mexico before crossing Central America into the eastern Pacific Ocean on July 28. Early on July 29, Dvorak classifications began on the system, and subsequent to the formation of banding features and a surface circulation, the system developed into Tropical Depression Six-E about 170 miles (275 km) southeast of Manzanillo, Mexico. The depression continued to organize, with increasing convection and distinct upper-level outflow, and early on July 30 the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Estelle.\n\nTropical Storm Estelle gradually intensified as it tracked west-northwestward, a motion caused by a large anticyclone to its north. On July 31, the storm attained hurricane status about 550 miles (885 km) south-southeast of the southern tip of Baja California. Its intensification continued as a well-defined eye about 30 miles (48 km) in diameter became visible on satellite imagery, and on August 2 Estelle reached its peak intensity of 135 mph (215 km/h). The hurricane soon began to weaken as deep convection diminished and the eye disappeared on satellite imagery. Two days after peaking in intensity, Estelle weakened to tropical storm status. Late on August 4, the convection associated with the storm dissipated, and the next day the storm weakened to tropical depression status. Convection briefly re-developed on August 6, though increased wind shear and cooler water weakened the depression further. Two days later, Estelle dissipated about 400 miles (645 km) east-northeast of the Hawaiian Islands. High surf from Estelle impacted southern California, resulting in a number of lifeguard rescues. The storm disrupted the trade winds around Hawaii, resulting in light winds and rain showers on Kauai and Oahu.\n\nOn July 19, a tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa. A mid-level circulation developed to the south of Cape Verde on July 22, though the wave became less distinct as it continued westward. The wave axis crossed Central America into the eastern Pacific Ocean on July 31. Convection steadily increased, though it was not until August 4 that the convection began to organize. Dvorak classifications began on August 4, and subsequent to the formation of a low-level circulation the system developed into Tropical Depression Seven-E on August 6 about 550 miles (885 km) south of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula. The depression tracked generally northward, under the influence of a ridge over Mexico and a mid-level trough to its west. The center of the depression was initially elongated, with northerly wind shear impacting the structure of the cyclone. This at first prevented further strengthening, though convection increased and organized into banding features as it moved through an area of warm water. On August 8, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Frank, and it soon turned to the north-northwest, brushing the western coastline of Baja California. On August 9, Frank reached peak winds of 45 mph (75 km/h) about 105 miles (170 km) west-northwest of Ciudad Constitución. It turned to the northwest, with a portion of the circulation of the land, and steadily weakened after moving over cooler water. On August 10, Frank dissipated a short distance off Baja California.\n\nOn August 8, the government of Mexico issued a tropical storm warning for portions of the southwestern Baja California Peninsula. Officials ordered the evacuation of some residents near Cabo San Lucas, whose port was closed, due to the threat of mudslides. Gusty winds and moderate rainfall were reported in a localized area of Baja California Sur, with rainfall peaking at 9.61 inches (244 mm) at Santa Anita, near Los Cabos. Moisture from Frank extended into the southwestern United States, producing more than 2 inches (50 mm) of rain in southern California and Arizona. One news agency attributed three deaths to the storm, though elsewhere there were no reports of damage.\n\nA tropical wave was first observed in the eastern Pacific Ocean on August 4 in association with the Intertropical Convergence Zone. It tracked westward, and by August 9 a low-level circulation formed well to the south of Mexico. Banding features increased as the system detached from the Intertropical Convergence Zone, and on August 11, the system developed into Tropical Depression Eight-E about 730 miles (1170 km) southwest of Acapulco. On becoming a tropical cyclone, the depression maintained an area of concentrated deep convection near the center. The National Hurricane Center initially predicted that the depression would slowly intensify and reach winds of 70 mph (115 km/h) within 72 hours. For much of the rest of the storm's duration, the National Hurricane Center underestimated the intensity of the cyclone.\n\nThe depression tracked steadily northwestward, caused by its location along the western periphery of a subtropical ridge. It would retain that direction for most of its remaining duration. Late on August 11, it intensified into Tropical Storm Georgette, and two days later it attained hurricane status after developing a 40-mile (65 km) eye about 615 miles (990 km) south-southwest of Cabo San Lucas. The eye became increasingly distinct while banding features became very well organized. Georgette attained peak winds of 115 mph (185 km/h) while centered 690 miles (1110 km) west-southwest of the southern tip of Baja California. The hurricane soon moved over cooler water, and began to weaken as convection warmed and decreased. On August 16, it degenerated into a tropical storm, and Georgette dissipated on August 17 without ever affecting land.\n\nAn area of convection developed in association with a northward bulge of the near-equatorial convergence zone. It tracked west-northwestward under the influence of a ridge to its north, and organized into Tropical Depression One-C on August 19, about 1000 miles (1600 km) southeast of the Hawaiian Islands. The depression failed to organize significantly as it turned westward. High wind shear from an upper-level trough continually weakened the system, and on August 19, the Central Pacific Hurricane Center issued the final advisory on the tropical depression about 365 miles (585 km) south of Hilo on the island of Hawaii. It never affected land.\n\nA tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on August 7. As it moved across the Atlantic Ocean, it failed to organize. On reaching the eastern Pacific Ocean on August 17, however, an area of convection developed along the wave axis. Dvorak classifications began the next day, and a broad center of circulation gradually formed. Convection was intermittent at first, though it gradually organized and persisted near the center, and on August 20, the disturbance developed into Tropical Depression Nine-E about south of Puerto Angel, Mexico. It tracked generally west-northwestward, developing more pronounced banding features, and on August 21, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Howard. The center of Howard became embedded within the deep convection, and the storm quickly strengthened to attain hurricane status late on the 21st. An eye developed as outflow organized further, and Howard began to rapidly intensify to reach peak winds of 150 mph (240 km/h) about 600 miles (965 km) south-southeast of the southern tip of Baja California. At the time of its peak intensity, the eye was small and located within a very cold central dense overcast.\n\nShortly after peaking in intensity, the eye of Hurricane Howard gradually became larger, resulting in a slight weakening trend. After weakening to winds of 125 mph (200 km/h), the eye reached a diameter of about 30 miles (50 km), and the structure of the hurricane transitioned into that of an annular hurricane, similar to that of Darby earlier in the season. Howard strengthened again into a Category 4 hurricane on August 25 before weakening slightly the following day. The hurricane retained annular characteristics for about 48 hours before moving over cooler water. On August 28, it weakened to a tropical storm, and early on August 30, Howard was considered to have dissipated. A small, low-level swirl of clouds devoid of convection persisted for a few days before dissipating. Howard never affected land.\n\nIsis developed on September 1 out of the interaction between a tropical wave and a large, low-level circulation to the southwest of Mexico. It moved northward, striking the extreme southeastern portion of the Baja California Peninsula before attaining hurricane status in the Gulf of California. Isis made landfall at Topolobampo in the state of Sinaloa on September 3 and quickly lost its low-level circulation. The remnants persisted for several days before dissipating in the US state of Idaho.\n\nIn Mexico, Isis destroyed more than 700 houses and killed 14 people, primarily due to heavy rainfall of more than 20 inches (500 mm) in southern Baja California Sur. The rainfall caused widespread damage to roads and railways, stranding thousands of people. Moisture from the remnants of Isis extended into the southwestern United States, resulting in light rainfall, dozens of traffic accidents, and power outages for thousands of residents in San Diego County.\n\nJavier is believed to have originated from a tropical wave that moved off the coast of Africa on August 22. A convective disturbance along the northern portion of the wave developed into Atlantic Hurricane Danielle on August 24, while the southern portion of the wave axis continued westward. The wave remained inactive and difficult to track as it crossed the Atlantic. On September 3, an area of convection began to develop near Acapulco, at the same time and location where the wave would have been based on extrapolation. The disturbance became better defined on September 5 as it tracked west-northwestward, and on September 6 the convection became sufficiently organized and persistent for the National Hurricane Center to classify it as Tropical Depression Eleven-E, while it was located about 200 miles (330 km) southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico.\n\nEasterly wind shear initially dislocated the circulation center to the eastern edge of the convection. The subtropical ridge to its north resulted in a general west-northwest motion, and the depression slowly intensified into Tropical Storm Javier late on September 7. Banding features in the system did not organize significantly, and on September 8, Javier attained a peak intensity of 60 mph (95 km/h), which coincided with a sharp increase in convection over the center. Steering currents soon weakened, and the storm turned to the east while convection quickly decreased. By September 9, the center was exposed from the diminishing deep convection, and that night it degenerated into a tropical depression. On September 11, the National Hurricane Center issued its final advisory on Javier, though later analysis indicates that it remained a tropical cyclone as it turned southeastward. At times, it became difficult to distinguish Javier from the broader area of disturbed weather that persisted over the tropical eastern Pacific, though a brief increase in convection and a ship report of winds exceeding 40 mph (65 km/h) indicate that Javier strengthened again into a tropical storm late on September 12. It turned to the northeast, and reached winds of 50 mph (80 km/h) before weakening due to waning convection. Javier made landfall about 35 miles (55 km) east-southeast of Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco early on September 14, and dissipated within 12 hours of moving ashore. The National Hurricane Center advised small craft along coastal areas of Mexico to monitor the progress of the storm.\n\nJavier produced moderate rainfall along coastal regions of Mexico, including a 24-hour peak of 7.36 inches (187 mm) in Colima, 6.69 inches (170 mm) in Michoacán, and 3.34 inches (85 mm) in Jalisco. Puerto Vallarta reported the highest total rainfall, at 17.33 inches (440 mm). Damage, if any, is unknown.\n\nA tropical disturbance developed persistent convection in association with a low-level circulation, and organized into Tropical Depression Twelve-E late on October 1 about 350 miles (565 km) west-northwest of Manzanillo, Mexico. Within an environment of weak steering currents, the depression was initially forecast to track slowly west-northwestward and reach winds of 60 mph (95 km/h), but instead it drifted eastward before turning slowly to the west. The depression failed to organize and gradually worsened in appearance. Early on October 2, two ships reported southwest winds much further to the north, with the National Hurricane Center indicating that either the center was exceedingly small, that no center existed at the time, or that the center was located far to the north of the thunderstorm activity. Operationally, the center was relocated further to the north, then relocated about to the south six hours later based on visible satellite images, then again relocated to the north, coinciding with officials issuing the last advisory on the system. By early October 3, the depression possessed only intermittent convection, and later that day it dissipated to the southwest of the Baja California peninsula. Heavy rains from its eastern periphery fell across southwest Mexico, with a maximum total of at Las Gaviotas/Compostela.\n\nA small, low-level circulation separated itself from the Intertropical Convergence Zone on October 10, several hundred miles southwest of Baja California. The circulation was well defined, though its convection was initially minimal and disorganized. On October 12, the convection increased greatly, and the system was sufficiently organized to be classified Tropical Depression Thirteen-E early on October 13, about 715 miles (1150 km) southwest of Cabo San Lucas. Dvorak classifications also indicated winds of about 35 mph (55 km/h). Operationally, the depression was forecast to intensify to reach peak winds of 45 mph (70 km/h) while tracking steadily west-northwestward.\n\nThe storm center was at first ill-defined, and post-season analysis estimates that it intensified into Tropical Storm Kay about 6 hours after developing. After becoming a tropical storm, Kay rapidly organized as it tracked generally westward. A pinhole eye developed in the center of the convection, and Kay attained hurricane status late on October 13, about 18 hours after developing. After remaining a hurricane for about 12 hours, the eye disappeared and the convection weakened, and early on October 14 Kay degenerated into a tropical storm. Within an environment of weak steering currents, the storm turned to the southwest, then to the south, after weakening to a tropical depression on October 15. Convection sporadically redeveloped, but failed to persist. Kay turned to the southeast and later to the east, and the system dissipated on October 17, about 330 miles (530 km) south-southwest of its origin. Kay never affected land.\nA tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on September 29, and on October 5, an area of convection along the wave developed into Atlantic Hurricane Lisa. The wave axis continued westward, and after crossing Central America convection increased as it tracked northwestward, and the system organized into Tropical Depression Fourteen-E on October 15, about 200 miles (320 km) south of Guatemala. It moved northwestward and late on the 15th it intensified into Tropical Storm Lester, about 115 miles (185 km/h) south of the border of Mexico and Guatemala, before attaining hurricane status on October 16. Lester continued westward and strengthened to reach a peak intensity of 115 mph (185 km/h) on October 22. Late on October 23, it degenerated into a tropical storm, and several days later, Lester dissipated on October 26.\n\nEarly in its lifetime, Lester produced heavy rainfall across southwestern Guatemala. The rainfall destroyed some houses and killed livestock, and a mudslide from the heavy precipitation killed two children. In Honduras, rainfall from the hurricane destroyed a bridge in Tegucigalpa, affecting about 1,000 people. Moisture brought around the northeast periphery of the Sierra Madre Occidental led to a narrow band of heavy rainfall along the upslope side of the mountain range, with a local precipitation maximum exceeding 14 inches (360 mm). Though no surface reports are available, it is estimated that tropical-storm-force winds occurred along coastal areas of southern Mexico.\nA tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on September 25, and remained disorganized while crossing the Atlantic Ocean before crossing Central America into the Pacific Ocean. It continued westward, and on October 15 began to steadily organize until developing into Tropical Depression Fifteen-E on October 16, about 230 miles (370 km) west-southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico. At the western end of a mid-level ridge, the depression tracked north-northwestward. 12 hours after first developing, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Madeline. Banding features gradually improved in organization, and late on October 17, Madeline attained hurricane status. On October 18, Madeline attained peak winds of 85 mph (140 km/h) about 95 miles (150 km) southwest of San Blas, Nayarit. Late on October 19, the hurricane degenerated into a tropical storm, and early on October 20, Madeline dissipated in the southern portion of the Gulf of California.\n\nSome of the rainbands from Madeline moved over portions of southwest Mexico, with close to 9 inches (560 mm) falling at Cabo Corrientes. No damage or casualties were reported as a result of the storm in Mexico. Moisture from Madeline contributed to heavy rainfall across southeastern Texas, reaching over 22 inches (560 mm) in some locations. Thirty-one people died due to the flooding, and damage totaled $750 million (1998 USD).\n\nThe following names were used to name storms that formed in the northeastern Pacific Ocean during 1998. No retired names were announced by the World Meteorological Organization in the spring of 1999, so they were used again in the 2004 season. This is the same list used in the 1992 season.\n\nFor storms that form in the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility, encompassing the area between 140 degrees west and the International Date Line, all names are used in a series of four rotating lists. The next four names that were slated for use in 1998 are shown below, however none of them were used.\n\nThis is a table of all the storms that have formed in the 1998 Pacific hurricane season. It includes their duration, names, landfall(s), denoted in parentheses, damages, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all the damage figures are in 1998 USD.\n\n"}
{"id": "2187599", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2187599", "title": "O Jerusalem!", "text": "O Jerusalem!\n\nO Jerusalem! is a history book by Dominique Lapierre and Larry Collins that seeks to capture the events and struggles surrounding the creation of the state of Israel.\n\nThe book is the result of five years of research by the authors, which also included several thousand interviews, and examination of a series of publicly available documents and relevant materials. These became the basic materials for presenting the story of the birth of the modern state of Israel.\n\nThe book \"O Jerusalem!\" endeavors to present events from all sides who were parties to the conflict and the events which are the subject matter of the book: the Arabs, the Jews—from the simple soldiers and rabbinical students to the commanders like David Ben-Gurion and Golda Meir—and the British.\n\nThe book has forty-six chapters, grouped into four parts:\n\nThe book begins with a prologue, and ends with an epilogue, index, and certain relevant information categorized under biographical note acknowledgements, a bibliography, chapter notes, and photograph credits.\n\nIn 1917, during World War I, Britain defeated the Ottoman Turks and Palestine and Jordan were put under its control. They came under official British mandate in 1922 by League of Nations approval. The Balfour Declaration of 1917, named after British Prime Minister Arthur Balfour, promised that Britain would assist the Jewish people in building their state in the Middle East (\"Balfour Doctrine,\" Britannica). However, Britain also promised to give the Palestinian Arabs independence in the Husayn-McMahon Correspondence. Britain denounced the Husayn-McMahon correspondence with the Churchill White Paper, declaring Britain's favor of the Balfour Doctrine over the Husayn-McMahon correspondence. The 1930 Passfield White Paper reversed this policy with its pro-Husayn-McMahon policy. This White Paper was met with outrage in the Jewish community and Britain quickly reverted its policies back to the 1922 Churchill White Paper. Arabs responded with a strike, followed by a revolt (lasting until 1939) in 1936. In 1939 Britain released the 1939 White Paper, which acceded to Arab demands. The White Paper promised an end to Jewish immigration, and independent Arab Palestine. The League of Nations and the Jews of Palestine rejected the White Paper as entirely outside Britain's mandate.\n\nAfter World War II Britain asked the United Nations to solve the Zion-Arab conflict. On November 29, 1947, the UN voted to partition the British mandate of Palestine to include a Jewish state as well as an Arab Palestinian state (\"Palestine\" Britannica).\n\nThe book begins immediately after the partition decision was announced. The Jews flooded the streets of Palestine, celebrating. However, the Jewish leaders immediately began planning for war. Ehud Avriel was sent to Prague to buy arms in the name of Ethiopia. Meanwhile, the Jews built an army and air force from scratch. The Jewish leaders, like David Ben-Gurion, knew that, due to military shortcomings, the conflict could only be won through intelligence warfare. The Arabs vowed to put Jerusalem under siege, and did. For many months Jerusalem survived on very limited foodstuffs.\n\nOn the Arab side, Captain Abdul-Aziz Kerine bought arms in Prague in the name of Syria, the only sovereign Arab nation at the time. The Arab countries (Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, and Transjordan) discussed their plan of action. They agreed to work together, but everyone, especially King Abdullah of Transjordan, had their own agenda. In the end, the Arab states' lack of cooperation led to their downfall.\n\nThere was a lot of disorganization and non-cooperation on the Jewish side as well. The main Jewish army was the Haganah, however the Stern Gang and Irgun were other Jewish militant groups. The groups had conflicting ideals (for example: the Haganah was willing to internationalize Jerusalem in order to have a unified, peaceful state, but Jerusalem was of the utmost importance to the Stern Gang and the Irgun), but they managed to retain more organization and cooperation than the Arab armies. In the main text of O Jerusalem!, it is related that the Stern Gang and the Irgun massacred the Arab village of Deir Yassin, outraging Arabs. The Haganah denounced the massacre, but the Arabs believed the Haganah to be responsible and retaliated at the Jewish kibbutz of Kfar Etzion.\n\nAs May 15 drew closer, the two peoples continued preparing for war. However, the Jewish intelligence learned that, although the mandate was set to expire on May 15, the British were planning to leave on May 14. Prepared for the early departure, the Haganah mobilized quickly and managed to capture many British buildings before the Arabs even realized that the British had left. Not privy to this intelligence, the Arab armies activated on May 15. The Jewish homeland of Israel was declared on Iyar 5, 5708 Hebrew, or May 14, 1948, Gregorian. Today, this day is celebrated as Yom Ha'atzmaut, or Israeli Independence Day.\n\nAfter the expiration of the mandate, war befell the region. The Arab armies underestimated the Haganah's strength and were not prepared for a strong foe. Both the Arab and Jewish armies suffered major shortcomings in ammunition and manpower. The situation in Jerusalem worsened, leaving Jewish Jerusalemites near starving. On June 11, 1948, a UN sanctioned cease-fire began. Jerusalem's starving were saved by a temporary end to the siege. Jerusalem's storerooms and stomachs were filled again. By cease-fire agreement, neither army was allowed to re-arm itself, but the Haganah was able to buy arms through the black market. The Arab armies, however, were not. After four weeks, the fighting began again, followed by another cease-fire beginning on July 19 (July 17 in Jerusalem), 1948 (O Jerusalem! Collins).\n\nThe authors spent three years interviewing, researching, and reading public documents in order to create an interesting, readable account of the birth of Israel and the lives and deaths of the countless, often nameless, people involved. This perspective gives justice to some of the most compelling factors of the conflict. There are some omissions in their narrative such as the shooting of Thomas C. Wasson which occurred in Jerusalem on 20 May 1948.\n\n"}

{"id": "2187605", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2187605", "title": "1997 Pacific hurricane season", "text": "1997 Pacific hurricane season\n\nThe 1997 Pacific hurricane season was a very active hurricane season. With hundreds of deaths and hundreds of millions of dollars in damage, this season was one of the costliest and deadliest Pacific hurricane seasons. This was due to the exceptionally strong 1997–98 El Niño event. The 1997 Pacific hurricane season officially started on May 15, 1997, in the eastern Pacific, and on June 1, 1997, in the central Pacific, and lasted until November 30, 1997. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when almost all tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean.\n\nSeveral storms impacted land. The first was Tropical Storm Andres which killed four people and left another two missing. In August, Tropical Storm Ignacio took an unusual path, and its extratropical remnants caused minor damage in the Pacific Northwest and California. Linda became the most intense east Pacific hurricane in recorded history, a record it maintained until it was surpassed by Hurricane Patricia in 2015. Although it never made landfall, it produced large surf in Southern California and as a result five people had to be rescued. Hurricane Nora caused flooding and damage in the Southwestern United States, while Olaf made two landfalls and caused eighteen deaths and several other people were reported missing. Hurricane Pauline killed several hundred people and caused record damage in southeastern Mexico. In addition, Super Typhoons Oliwa and Paka originated in the region before crossing the International Date Line and causing significant damage in the western Pacific. There were also two Category 5 hurricanes: Linda and Guillermo.\n\nActivity in the season was above average. The season produced 17 named storms, which was a little above normal. The average number of named storms per year is 15. The 1997 season also had 9 hurricanes, compared to the average of 8. There were also 7 major hurricanes compared to the average of 4.\n\nThe 1997 Pacific hurricane season officially started on May 15, 1997, in the eastern Pacific, and on June 1, 1997, in the central Pacific, and lasted until November 30, 1997. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. This season exceeded these boundaries appreciably, as Tropical Storm Paka formed December 2, and dissipated nineteen days later after crossing the International Dateline and then moved into the Western Pacific.\n\nThe 1997 Pacific hurricane season was fairly active, due to the strong El Niño that was occurring at the time. El Niño causes wind shear to be reduced and water temperatures to increase, resulting in conditions more conductive for tropical cyclones in the East Pacific. There were 24 cyclones in total, including five unnamed tropical depressions. Of these, 19 were in the east Pacific (east of 140°W). Of these, eight peaked at tropical storm intensity, while ten reached hurricane status. Seven of these reached Category 3 intensity or higher on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale, including central Pacific cyclones Super Typhoons Oliwa and Paka, which became typhoons after crossing into the western Pacific. The first hurricane of the year was Hurricane Dolores, and the first major hurricane was Hurricane Enrique. Most months during the year had several storms, but no records were set for storms in any particular month.\n\nActivity in the central Pacific was also above average. Two tropical storms formed, as did several tropical depressions. A number of storms moved in from the east. With a total of nine tropical cyclones entering or forming there, this was the fourth highest number since satellite observations began. The first storm formed on June 1. The last storm dissipated December 21, which gives this season the latest known end. However, if December 6, the date the last storm crossed the dateline is taken to be the end, this season has the second latest end, behind the 1983 season and tied with the 1957 season.\nThe National Hurricane Center uses Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) to rank hurricane seasons as above-normal, near-normal, and below-normal. This season has a total of 17 tropical storms, 9 hurricanes, and 7 major hurricanes. The total ACE of this season is 160*10 kt in the east Pacific proper. This qualifies this season as above-normal.\n\nAndres originated from a disturbance that slowly organized and formed into Tropical Depression One-E on June 1. The next day, it reached tropical storm status as a second circulation formed north-northwest of the initial circulation. However, the former circulation became dominant, and Andres intensified slightly. After a brief period of a normal track to the northwest, Andres was picked up by westerly winds and became the first named storm to threaten Central America. Initially forecast to cross the isthmus and enter the Caribbean Sea, Andres instead turned to the southeast and paralleled the coast. This was the first time since record-keeping began that any East Pacific storm had taken such a path. Andres then turned back to the northeast. It weakened to a depression and made landfall near San Salvador on June 7 and dissipated shortly thereafter.\n\nAmong the casualties were two fishers who were reported missing. Andres caused power outages, flooding rivers, several car crashes, and damage to roughly ten homes. The highest rainfall report from Mexico was at Mazatan. Damage was noted in parts of Nicaragua. Andres also killed four people in Usulután, El Salvador due to heavy flooding.\nTropical Depression Two-E formed from a broad area of low pressure on June 9. Six hours later the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Blanca. This system developed a good outflow, and reached its peak intensity with winds of 45 mph (75 km/h). However, its circulation was not well-defined and a weakening trend began, and Blanca was downgraded to a depression on June 12. It lost its closed circulation shortly thereafter and was thus declared dissipated.\n\nBlanca briefly threatened land on June 10 as warnings and watches were established by the Mexican \"Servicio Meteorológico Nacional\". Shortly thereafter, a ridge of high pressure turned Blanca away from the coast. As Blanca moved just south of the Mexican coast, it dropped a total of of rainfall at Fincha Chayabe/Maragaritas. There were no major damage or casualties as Blanca's impact was generally minimal.\n\nTropical Depression Three-E formed June 21. Moving rapidly westward, it never strengthened and the winds of the depression soon decreased. It dissipated early on June 24. The depression never impacted land.\n\nOn June 22, showers increased associated with a tropical wave several hundred miles away from land. Three days later, deep convection became more concentrated, and the system became a tropical depression. It intensified into Tropical Storm Carlos as banding features increased and the outflow became better defined. As it moved west, convection diminished as Carlos moved into cooler water. Shortly thereafter, increased wind shear took its toll on Carlos as the low-level center became exposed from the deep convection. Carlos weakened into a depression early on June 27, and dissipated June 28. However, a swirl of clouds remained for a couple of days. Except for Socorro Island, which the system passed close to, Carlos never threatened land. No indications of casualties or damage were reported.\n\nOn the afternoon of June 29, Tropical Depression Five-E formed. It erratically moved westward. On July 1, the depression weakened slightly, but quickly reintensified. It dissipated on July 4, without even threatening land.\n\nIn early July, shower activity increased in association with an area of disturbed weather. With surface pressures lower than normal for a tropical disturbance, deep convection increased further and Tropical Depression Six-E formed late on July 5 and reaching tropical storm status the following day and was named Dolores. Despite moderate wind shear, very cold cloud tops formed as the winds increased to , a moderate tropical storm. Moving westward, Dolores strengthened into the first hurricane of the season on July 7 as a ragged eye formed.\n\nDolores continued to intensify and it reached a peak windspeed of , a strong Category 1 hurricane, two days later. Meanwhile, Dolores became the first hurricane in over two years to cross longitude 125°W. Shortly thereafter, the hurricane started losing strength as it moved over cooler waters. The eye dissipated from satellite imagery while the associated thunderstorm activity became sheared. Dolores weakened back into a tropical storm on July 10 and a tropical depression the next day. The cyclone then crossed into the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility (west of longitude 140°W) while producing minimal shower activity. It dissipated on July 12. The hurricane was not a threat to any land.\n\nThe first major hurricane of the season originated from a broad area of low pressure on July 8 near the Gulf of Tehuantepec. The thunderstorms gradually became more concentrated and a tropical depression formed on July 12. It strengthened into a tropical storm twelve hours later, and then began to rapidly intensify as convection increased further near the center. It became a hurricane on July 13. Enrique continued to steadily intensify and became a Category 2 hurricane on July 14. The next day, Enrique reached its peak intensity of and peak pressure 960 mbar (hPa) on July 14. Shortly thereafter, the hurricane outflow became asymmetrical and it began to weaken over cool waters. It weakened fairly quickly and was downgraded into a Category 2 hurricane on July 15. It then lost hurricane intensity later that day. On July 16 the winds had decreased further to . Enrique weakened into a depression the next day, and degenerated into a swirl of clouds shortly thereafter. The system never threatened land.\n\nA large area of disturbed weather formed on July 13. It then organized into a depression south of Manzanillo, Colima, on July 14. Intensification was delayed by wind shear due to its proximity to Enrique for about two days. However, it became a tropical storm late July 15 as it moved west-northwestward. Continuing to intensify, an eye formed. Based on this, Felicia was upgraded into a hurricane on July 17. Its development was again halted by increased wind shear, and as such it leveled off in intensity. After the shear decreased, Felicia began to intensify and the hurricane's winds reached and its pressure fell to 948 mbar (hPa), making it a moderate low-end Category 4 hurricane. Shear increased for the third time, and then moved into cooler waters. It began to weaken as it moved west-northwest. On July 20, it lost major hurricane intensity. Shortly before being downgraded to a tropical storm, it crossed 140°W. A strong wind shear took toll on Felicia and it was downgraded into a tropical depression July 22. No damage or deaths were reported in wake of the hurricane.\n\nTropical Depression One-C formed on July 26 from a disturbance that had been showing signs of organization for the past three days. It moved west to southwest through an unfavorable environment. On the morning of July 27, it dissipated due to strong wind shear caused by an upper-level trough. The system never impacted land, thus no damage was reported.\nA tropical wave emerged into the Pacific Ocean on July 27. It organized into a depression July 30 and was named Tropical Storm Guillermo the next day. It quickly intensified, reaching hurricane status on August 1. Guillermo became a major hurricane August 2. It reached Category 4 intensity on August 3. Continuing to rapidly intensify, Guillermo attained Category 5 strength August 4. The tropical cyclone peak intensity was 919 mbar (hPa) and .\n\nGuillermo then weakened slowly, becoming a tropical storm August 8. It crossed 140°W and entered the Central Pacific. It weakened to a depression late August 10, but restrengthened back into a storm 24 hours later when it encountered a small area of warmer water. It weakened to a depression for the second and final time August 15 and became an extratropical cyclone early the next day. The storm's remnants recurved over the far northern Pacific. They were tracked to a point west of Vancouver Island. The remnants persisted for a few more days and drifted south before being absorbed by a mid-latitude cyclone August 24 off the coast of California.\n\nA tropical wave that had showed signs of development emerged into the East Pacific and organized into Tropical Depression Ten-E on August 10. Despite some wind shear, the depression managed to become a tropical storm late on August 11. Hilda reached its peak intensity as a moderate 50 mph (85 km/h) tropical storm the next day. After maintaining its peak intensity for 24 hours, it gradually weakened due to increasing wind shear On August 14, shear weakened Hilda to a depression and the cyclone dissipated early the next morning. Hilda was no threat to land and caused no known damage or deaths.\nTropical Storm Ignacio formed first as a depression in an area of disturbed weather on August 17. Twelve hours later, it organized into a tropical storm. Its location of tropical cyclone formation was further north and west of where most East Pacific tropical cyclones develop. Steering currents pulled Ignacio north, where it encountered wind shear and cooler waters. Ignacio never intensified beyond 40 mph (65 km/h) and then was downgraded into a depression on August 18. It last transitioned into an extratropical cyclone 24 hours later. It was then absorbed by a cyclone associated with the remnants of Hurricane Guillermo.\n\nIgnacio's remnants moved north, bringing gusty winds to California coastal waters before dissipating. Severe flooding was recorded along Highway 97 with a debris flow estimated at and deep. They caused rainfall as far north as the U.S. state of Washington. Thunderstorms caused power outages in central California.\nDuring the third week of August, a tropical disturbance formed far from land. Although the system was located over warmer than average sea surface temperatures, the upper-level environment was initially unfavorable. However the environment gradually became more conducive for tropical cyclone formation and Tropical Depression Twelve-E formed August 25 from an area of disturbed weather in a rather easterly location. It became a tropical storm the next day and a hurricane on August 27. Intensification was rapid, with winds increasing from to in just 6 hours. Continuing to rapidly intensify, it reached its peak intensity as a low-end category 4 hurricane. After maintaining peak intensity for 30 hours, it moved north-northwest and encountered increasing wind shear which reduced its winds from to in just 24 hours. Jimena completely dissipated on August 30, not long after entering the Central Pacific Basin. Hurricane Jimena was of no threat to land.\nTropical storm Oliwa began as a tropical disturbance that had meandered south of Johnston Atoll. It organized into Tropical Depression Two-C on September 2. Later that day, it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Oliwa (Hawaiian for Oliver) as it slowly moved towards the west. It crossed the dateline late on September 3 and entered the Joint Typhoon Warning Center's Area of Responsibility.) In the Pacific Ocean, tropical cyclones are not renamed when they cross basin boundaries, so Oliwa kept its name.\n\nOliwa passed south of Wake Island on September 6, where it caused heavy rains but no damage. On September 7, Oliwa started a period of rapid strengthening, becoming a typhoon on September 8 and a Super Typhoon eight hours later. Oliwa stayed at that intensity for over two days. While still a strong typhoon, Oliwa passed near the Northern Marianas Islands. It then started weakening as it curved towards Japan. It made landfall as a minimal typhoon September 16. It quickly dissipated later that same day. Typhoon Oliwa caused 12 fatalities and left 30,000 people homeless. Damage totaled to 4.36 billion yen ($50.1 million USD).\n\nTropical Storm Kevin, first displayed hints of development while located near Panama, and developed a well-defined circulation after emerging into the Pacific. It was classified as a tropical depression in the Pacific on September 3 while located south-south west of Baja California. Convection increased and the outflow of the storm became better defined. As such, it became a tropical storm on the morning of September 4. Gradually intensifying, it reached it peak intensity as a mid-level tropical storm on September 5. As it moved westbound, it maintained its intensity for 12 hours. The environment was unfavorable, and two days later, Kevin weakened to a depression when deep convection ceased. It dissipated early on September 7, having never posed a threat to land.\n\nA tropical disturbance formed on September 9 and became Tropical Depression Fourteen-E later that day. The cyclone moved northwest and strengthened into a tropical storm on September 10. Linda then rapidly intensified, reaching hurricane intensity the next day as an eye formed. On September 12, Linda reached its peak intensity, with maximum sustained winds of —making it a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale—and a minimum pressure of 902 mbar (902 hPa), making it the most intense Pacific hurricane ever recorded until Hurricane Patricia surpassed it in 2015. However, Linda soon moved over cooler waters, and began to weaken, falling below hurricane intensity on September 16. It then slowly weakened and dissipated on September 17.\n\nLinda passed very near Socorro Island. In addition, early forecasts predicted that Linda would make landfall in California. The landfall never materialized and warnings or watches were not necessary for any location. However, Linda caused large surf, which crashed ashore in California, where it swept five people off a jetty. Moisture related to Linda also contributed to a landslide in southern California that destroyed or damaged 79 houses.\n\nAn area of disturbed weather formed early on September 10. It became better organized two days later as convection increased, and then organized into Tropical Depression Fifteen-E late on September 12. Moving slowly in a westward direction, it strengthened into a tropical storm in the morning of September 14. Later that day, the system reached its peak intensity of . Meanwhile, the storm's forward speed slowed down even more, and it turned to the south. It then encountered an area of strong wind shear, and it weakened into a depression on September 15 as the center of circulation became displaced from the deep convection. The shear continued to weaken, and the tropical cyclone dissipated late on September 16. There were no deaths or damage.\nA large area of disturbed weather moved into the Pacific on September 12. It then organized into Tropical Depression Sixteen-E on September 16 and quickly strengthened into a tropical storm. Early on September 18, a poorly defined and ragged eye appeared on infrared imagery. Shortly thereafter, its winds reached . Nora eventually peaked at Category 4. It then encountered water temperature anomalies, and fluctuated in strength. Then, a trough pulled Nora northward and accelerated the storm. After weakening to a Category 1, Nora made landfall in northern Baja California and stayed a tropical storm as it entered the United States. At that time, however, most of the deep rest convection was displaced to the northeast. Nora dissipated over Arizona, but its remnants kept going north.\n\nHurricane Nora was the first Pacific hurricane to bring gale-force winds to the Continental United States since Kathleen in 1976. In Mexico, Nora produced high waves, flooding, and heavy damage. Many homes were destroyed. In the United States, rains were heavy, and damage amounted to several hundred million dollars. Several hundred people were rendered homeless, and there was wind and flood damage in Arizona. Nora killed two people in Mexico, and several indirect deaths were reported in California.\nA tropical disturbance left Central America on September 22. Despite some wind shear, the system gradually became better organized and a tropical depression formed September 26, being upgraded to a tropical storm several hours later. The cyclone immediately moved north. Instead of strengthening into a hurricane before landfall as forecasted, Olaf weakened due to its proximity to land. On September 29, Olaf made landfall near Salina Cruz, Oaxaca.\n\nOlaf, as a tropical depression, moved westward, far out to sea. Operationally, Olaf was believed to have dissipated for six days. however, in the Tropical Cyclone Report, a report issued several months after the hurricane's duration, it was believed to have remained a tropical cyclone the entire time. After restrengthening slightly, Olaf moved southeast on October 5 due to the influence of Hurricane Pauline. Olaf then turned north, and on October 12 made a second landfall near Manzanillo, Colima, as a tropical depression. Olaf's surface circulation weakened, and its remnants moved back out to sea, but did not redevelop.\n\nOlaf resulted in some reports of damage and flooding in Mexico and Guatemala. During two time frames, from September 27 through October 2 and 10 through October 16, a total of of rainfall fell in association with Olaf in Soyalapa/Comaltepec. Several people were reported missing. Most of its damage was from its first landfall. Throughout southern Mexico, Guatemala and El Salvador, flooding caused by Olaf was blamed for eighteen deaths.\nOn October 3, a distinct area of disturbed weather formed. It drifted eastbound, and a well-defined low pressure soon formed. It became Tropical Depression Eighteen-E on October 5. Early the next day it intensified into tropical Storm Pauline. An eye feature developed on October 7 and as such Pauline was upgraded into a hurricane. In a favorable environment, the cyclone rapidly intensified, reaching Category 4 intensity. After fluctuating in intensity, interaction with land weakened Pauline to a Category 2 by the time it made landfall on October 9. It accelerated to the northwest, and passed over a mountainous region. The mountains disrupted Pauline's circulation, and squeezed the moisture from the hurricane. Pauline dissipated on October 10 while over Jalisco.\n\nHurricane Pauline was the deadliest storm of the season. Landslides and flooding caused by heavy rain caused tragic loss of life and left thousands homeless. There were at least 230 casualties. The Red Cross reported that 400 people died, but this was disputed by Mexican officials. Pauline was Mexico's deadliest hurricane since 1976's Liza. In addition, the hurricane caused $447.8 million in damage (1997 USD; $473 million 2008 USD).\n\nA tropical disturbance formed near 140°W. It became Tropical Depression Three-C on October 6. The waters were very warm, and there was only moderate wind shear. However, the depression slowly moved westward without intensifying, and dissipated the next day.\n\nA tropical disturbance formed in late October. It became Tropical Depression Four-C on October 30 well southwest of Hawaii. Although the waters were very warm, some dry air was located north of the system. It slowly moved westward without intensifying, and dissipated the next day as the circulation became exposed.\nThe first hurricane in November since 1991 formed from a tropical disturbance. Although the circulation was initially poorly defined, it later acquired enough organization and was classified as a tropical depression on November 7. It moved north until a trough of low pressure turned it to the northeast. It was named on November 8, and was upgraded to a hurricane the next day. It reached its peak intensity of 100 mph (160 km/h) and 973 mbar (hPa). Rick made landfall in Oaxaca – the same area devastated by Hurricane Pauline one month earlier – and quickly weakened, dissipating early on November 11.\n\nThe storm downed trees, washed out recently repaired roads, and disrupted communications in some small population centers. A total of of rain was reported at Astata/San Pedro Huameluca near the point of landfall in Mexico. No one was killed.\n\nRick is one of only eight known hurricanes to form in the Pacific Ocean east of the dateline in the month of November. The other ones are Nina, Tara, Iwa, Nora, Sergio, Kenneth, and Sandra of which only Rick, Tara, and Iwa directly impacted land. It was also the second-latest landfalling Pacific hurricane.\nTropical Depression Five-C formed on December 2, two days after the season ended. It was the second December tropical depression east of the dateline; 1983's Hurricane Winnie was the only other one. The depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Paka (Hawaiian for Pat) while west of Palmyra Atoll. The system began to move westward at a steady pace. As Paka moved westward, dry air and wind shear disrupted its development until it crossed the dateline on December 6.\n\nAfter entering the Western Pacific, the cyclone encountered a more favorable environment, resulting in rapid intensification. It became a typhoon on December 10 and passed near Kwajalein with winds of . It strengthened further, twice reaching Category 5 intensity. While a super typhoon, Paka passed close to Guam on December 17, causing major damage. Afterwards, Paka encountered a hostile environment and had completely dissipated by the evening of December 22.\nThis is a table of the storms in 1997 and their landfall(s), if any. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but are still storm-related. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical or a wave or low, but do not include impacts in the Western Pacific basin.\n\nThe following names were used for named storms that formed in the eastern Pacific in 1997. Names that were not assigned are marked in gray. The names not retired from this list were used again in the 2003 season. This is the same list used for the 1991 season except for Felicia, which replaced Fefa. A storm was named Felicia for the first time in 1997. Also, the name \"Dolores\" was misspelled \"Delores\" in the 1991 season; in this and subsequent seasons, the typo was corrected.\n\nFor storms that form in the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility, encompassing the area between 140 degrees west and the International Date Line, all names are used in a series of four rotating lists. The next four names that were slated for use in 1997 are shown below, however, only two of them were used.\n\nThe World Meteorological Organization retired one name in the spring of 1998: Pauline. It was replaced in the 2003 season by Patricia. In 2006, a name from the Central Pacific list was retired due to its effects west of the International Dateline in this season: Paka. The name set to replace it is Pama.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2187632", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2187632", "title": "1996 Pacific hurricane season", "text": "1996 Pacific hurricane season\n\nThe 1996 Pacific hurricane season saw a record four Pacific hurricanes strike Mexico. It was a below average season that produced 9 tropical storms, 5 hurricanes and 2 major hurricanes. It officially began May 15, 1996, in the eastern north Pacific and on June 1, 1996, in the central north Pacific. It ended on November 30, 1996. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. The season slightly exceeded these bounds when tropical storm One-E formed on May 13.\n\nFew storms formed this season, but it was very eventful. Twelve tropical cyclones formed during this season, of which five made landfall and two other impacted land areas. Two tropical cyclones that formed in other basins entered the eastern north Pacific Ocean. Early in the season three tropical cyclones impacted Mexico in a ten-day span, while the first cyclone of the season formed before it officially began. Hurricane Douglas was the strongest storm, reaching Category 4 intensity on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale and had its beginnings in the Atlantic as Hurricane Cesar.\n\nThis season was below average in activity. In the eastern north Pacific, eleven tropical cyclones formed. Of these, four became hurricanes, one of which were major hurricanes because they reached Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The remainder were tropical storms. In addition, one Atlantic hurricane, Hurricane Cesar, crossed into this zone from the Atlantic Ocean and was renamed Douglas. None of the systems in the eastern north Pacific crossed 140°W and entered the central Pacific. The last time that happened was in the 1979 season.\n\nIn the central north Pacific, one tropical depression formed. In addition, a depression crossed the dateline from the western Pacific before dissipating in this basin. None of these two systems reached tropical storm strength. In addition, data from the Joint Typhoon Warning Center, on September 1 Tropical Depression Rick crossed the International Dateline, entering into CPHC's area of responsibility; however, this storm was not included into CPHC database. The storm eventually became extratropical on September 3 over open waters.\n\nIn terms of the number of storms, the season was below average. Despite this, there were a large number of landfalls. Of note is the fact that three tropical cyclones approached close to, or made landfall on, Mexico during a ten-day span from June 23 to July 3. In all, a record-setting four hurricanes (Alma, Boris, Fausto, and Hernan) struck the coastline. \n\nAccumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) is a measure of how active a season is. It is found by taking a tropical storm or hurricane's windspeed in knots every six hours, squaring it, adding up the results, and dividing the total by 10. The ACE of this season makes it a below-normal season. It is one of the lowest totals ever recorded, with only the 2007, 1977 and 2010 seasons had lower totals.\n\nThe season had an early start on May 13 when a tropical wave in the open ocean organized into Tropical Depression One-E. The depression moved west-northwest and strengthened into a tropical storm on May 14. On that day, the tropical storm reached its peak intensity, with maximum sustained winds at and a minimum central pressure of . Wind shear steadily weakened the cyclone until it dissipated early on May 17. This system was the only tropical storm to form in May during the period from 1992–99.\n\nTropical Storm One-E was not assigned a name because it was determined to be a tropical storm after the season was over. The storm was initially forecast to become a tropical storm, but information available at the time did not warrant the upgrade. Subsequently, wind reports relayed from the US Coast Guard to the National Hurricane Center suggested that this cyclone was a tropical storm.\n\nThis tropical cyclone impacted two ships. The first — called the \"True Blue\" — was near the fringes of the storm and escaped. The other — the trimaran \"Solar Wind\" — provided wind observations until communications with the vessel were lost after 0600 UTC on May 14. Despite a search by the US Coast Guard, the ship and its two-person crew were never found.\n\nOn May 15 an area of disturbed weather in the Intertropical Convergence Zone developed into a tropical depression. The disturbance was not readily traceable back to a tropical wave from the Atlantic. On its first day of its existence, Tropical Depression Two-E was a well-organized system with maximum sustained winds of and a minimum central pressure of . As it slowly moved west, Two-E experienced a few intermittent bursts of convection. However, the depression gradually became less organized during the remainder of its life. On May 18, the cyclone's organization deteriorated markedly until it dissipated the next morning.\n\nTropical Depression Two-E never threatened land. Consequently, there were no reports of deaths or damage.\nOn June 20, the southern part of the same tropical wave that spawned Tropical Storm Arthur in the Atlantic overcame shear to strengthen into Tropical Depression Three-E. It reached tropical storm intensity that same day. When the shear relaxed, Alma strengthened into a hurricane. Weak steering currents sent Alma towards the Mexican coast. It made landfall near Lázaro Cárdenas, Michoacán on June 23 and almost immediately went back out to sea. Alma slowly paralleled the coast as the topography disrupted the cyclone's circulation. Alma weakened to tropical storm intensity on June 24 and to tropical depression intensity on June 26. It dissipated the next day. Alma's maximum winds were 105 mph (165 km/h) and Alma's minimum pressure was .\n\nHurricane Alma was the first of three consecutive storms to come close to, or make landfall on, the Pacific coast of Mexico during a ten-day span. At least three, and possibly twenty, people were killed. Three were killed when a house near Lázaro Cárdenas collapsed. There were unconfirmed reports that 17 people were killed by floods in the state of Puebla caused by Alma's rains. Trees were downed and power was knocked out to many places. Roads were flooded and covered with debris throughout the affected area.\nOn June 27, a tropical wave developed convection and became Tropical Depression Four. It moved north and slowly intensified. The rate of intensification increased and the depression became a tropical storm on June 28. Boris reached hurricane intensity on June 28 and peaked with winds of 90 mph (150 km/h) and a central pressure of . Boris then made landfall on June 29 about midway between Lázaro Cárdenas and Acapulco. Boris then moved offshore after turning to the southwest and dissipated on July 1 while south of Puerto Vallarta.\n\nHurricane Boris was, in general, a well-forecast storm. Due to the short time when the system was at or above tropical storm intensity, long-range forecasts were not verified. The average errors were at one and a half days in the future. Boris caused at least five deaths. One person was killed in Tecpan. Nearby, three other people drowned and five fishers were missing. In Acapulco, a child was killed when a roof collapsed. Rain was heavy throughout the impacted region, with the highest totals in Guerrero. The highest total was at Paso de San Antonio, to the east of the point of landfall.\n\nOn July 1, a tropical wave organized into Tropical Depression Five-E. The location of the depression was the easternmost since the depression that eventually became Hurricane Paul in the 1982 season. Five-E strengthened into Tropical Storm Cristina on July 2 as it continued its west-northwest track. Cristina was almost a hurricane at the time of its landfall near Puerto Angel on July 3. It peak strength, which occurred at landfall, was and . Cristina dissipated over the mountains of Mexico on July 3.\n\nAs a whole, both Cristina's intensity and track were well-forecast. However, the tropical cyclone's short life made verification of a small number of forecasts limited. When Cristina was approaching, the Mexican government issued a tropical storm warning for the coast between Tapachula and Punta Maldonado on July 2.\n\nTropical Storm Cristina killed one person, a fisherman, who was aboard a boat caught at sea. Another person from that boat was missing, and a third individual was rescued. Eleven other fishing boats, with a total of twenty-two people aboard, were missing. Their fate is unknown. The National Hurricane Center received no reports of damage due to Tropical Storm Cristina; however, there was flooding due to storm surge and damage from wind. It also produced rain.\n\nOn July 4, a persistent area of thunderstorms organized into a tropical depression. Weak steering currents slowly moved it northwest. Easterly wind shear inhibited the development of the system. Despite the wind shear, Six-E was forecast to strengthen into a tropical storm, but it instead weakened to a swirl of clouds and advisories were ended on July 5. Tropical Depression Six-E dissipated on July 6. At its peak strength, Six-E had winds of and a central pressure of .\n\nThis cyclone never came ashore. Consequently, no reports of damage or deaths were received by the National Hurricane Center.\nHurricane Douglas was a continuation of Atlantic Hurricane Cesar, which crossed Central America. Continuing Cesar's nearly due-west heading, it was still a tropical storm when it entered the Pacific on July 29, and quickly regained hurricane status.\n\nDouglas strengthened over the next two days as it turned west-northwest, paralleling the coast of Mexico. It reached its peak intensity on August 1, with winds of 130 mph (215 km/h) and a central pressure of , making it the strongest hurricane of the season at a Category 4 strength. It slow weakening began on August 2 as it entered cooler waters, and it officially dissipated on August 6, though like many Pacific hurricanes, a remnant circulation could be tracked westward for several days afterward.\n\nCompared with the long-term average, Hurricane Douglas was a well-forecast storm. The cyclone passed close enough to Mexico to necessitate a tropical storm warning starting on July 29 for the coast from Salina Cruz to Acapulco, with a watch along a further section of coast. The watches and warnings were discontinued on July 30.\n\nHurricane Douglas brought up to 6 in (150 mm) of rain on the south coast of Mexico and resulted in a 4-ft (1.2-m) storm surge. No deaths or damages were attributed to the Douglas portion of Hurricane Cesar-Douglas.\n\nA tropical depression, which formed August 13 from a cutoff area of low pressure area, crossed the dateline on August 14. It continued to head east, passing close to Midway Island. It dissipated on August 14, although the remnants of the system hung around the area for a few more days. At its strongest in the central north Pacific, Tropical Depression Seventeen-W had winds of and a pressure of .\n\nSeventeen-W brought light winds, with gusts reaching gale-force, to Midway Island. It also brought about 2.5 in (63.5 mm) of rain. After the cyclone dissipated, showers and gusty winds continued to occur on Midway and Kure for a few more days.\n\nSeventeen-W was the first tropical cyclone to cross the international dateline in either direction since Typhoon John in the 1994 season.\nHurricane Dolly struck eastern Mexico and managed to hold together, remaining a tropical depression as it entered the eastern Pacific Ocean late on August 24. Although Tropical Depression Dolly entered the eastern Pacific, the National Hurricane Center did not re-classify the system. No re-intensification occurred after the system entered the eastern Pacific, and it had dissipated as a tropical cyclone by the following day, about 40 mi (65 km) west of San Juanito in the Islas Marías.\n\nA tropical wave organized into Tropical Depression Eight-E on August 30. The cyclone paralleled the coast of Mexico and also gradually decelerated. Despite some wind shear, Eight-E strengthened into a tropical storm on September 2 and was named Elida. On September 3 and 4, Elida came close to the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula at its peak intensity of and winds of 65 mph (100 km/h). The cyclone then drifted into cooler waters, was devoid of deep convection on September 5, and dissipated the next day.\n\nThe storm was forecast slightly better than the long-term averages for the eastern North Pacific. Elida posed enough of a threat to the Baja California Peninsula to require a tropical storm warning for the Baja California Peninsula south of Cabo San Lázaro on September 3. The warning was lifted on September 5 after the threat ended. Moderate to heavy rains fell in association with the tropical cyclone across southwest Mexico and the Baja California Peninsula, with the maxima falling at San Marcos/Compostela in southwest mainland Mexico, which measured , and a maximum for Baja California of at La Poza Honda/Comondu. While passing offshore, the tropical storm killed six people and affected 1,200 others, but Elida caused no known damage.\nThe precursor disturbance to Fausto was first noticed over Venezuela as early as August 31, and may have been related to the tropical wave that spawned Hurricane Fran. By September 4 the wave had crossed Central America into the Pacific; it steadily organized until it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Fausto on September 10.\n\nFausto intensified rapidly after it reached hurricane intensity on the September 12, peaking with sustained winds of and a minimum central pressure of 955 mb. The hurricane weakened as an approaching trough increased shear over the storm; this same trough also turned the storm north on the September 13, where it made landfall as a minimal hurricane on Baja California that day. On September 14, the storm turned northeastward across the Gulf of California, and dissipated inland over the Sierra Madre range after its second landfall as a hurricane. Its extratropical remnants flared up briefly over northern Mexico and the U.S. state of Texas, but otherwise soon lost their identity.\n\nHeavy rainfall was accompanied with the passage of this cyclone, with a storm total of 18.50 inches (470 mm) reported at San Vicente de la Sierra. Damage in Mexico was relatively minor, with only a single casualty caused by a downed power line. Damage totaled to around $800,000 (1996 USD). \n\nA tropical disturbance organized into a tropical depression on September 15. It headed west until September 17. That day, it turned to the west for two days before heading back west-northwest on September 19. It soon began to weaken and dissipated the next day. At its most intense, Tropical Depression One-C had winds of 35 mph (55 km/h) and unknown pressure.\n\nThe tropical cyclone caused no known impact and never came near land.\n\nIn the Gulf of Tehuantepec, an area of disturbed weather containing convection formed on September 23. It moved westward without incident until September 27, when it developed stronger convection and became Tropical Depression Ten-E. Immediately thereafter, it strengthened into a tropical storm and was named Genevieve while it continued its westward track.\n\nGenevieve slowly got better organized, and reached its peak intensity of and 50 mph (85 km/h) on September 29. The tropical storm then turned to the west-southwest as steering currents collapsed. The cyclone began a time of erratic motion, which included two loops. The erratic motion also exposed Genevieve to wind shear, and the tropical storm weakened to a tropical depression on October 1. On October 6, the shear temporarily weakened, and Tropical Depression Genevieve restrengthened into a tropical storm. The cyclone's wandering continued, and it entrained dry air. This dry air weakened the system to a depression for a second time on October 8, and Genevieve dissipated the next day. Brief flare-ups of convection could still be seen for a few days thereafter.\n\nTropical Storm Genevieve was a rather poorly forecast storm. Most tropical cyclone prediction models indicated a northwesterly track that never happened, and also over-intensified the system. In addition, advisories on Tropical Depression Genevieve were discontinued on October 3, and only resumed three days later. Later analysis determined that Genevieve had been a tropical depression for this whole time.\n\nTropical Storm Genevieve never came near land, and consequently no watches or warnings were required for any location. The tropical cyclone had no impact on any land.\nOn September 30, a tropical wave organized into Tropical Depression Eleven-E. Gradual strengthening ensued, and the depression strengthened into a tropical storm twelve hours later and was named Hernan. Hernan's initial track was to the west, but the system gradually started to recurve. Its center of circulation reformed, and Hernan briefly turned to the northwest again. By October 2, and Hernan was close to the coast. It strengthened into a hurricane that day. Late on October 2 and early on October 3 Hernan closely paralleled the coast. Interaction with land weakened the cyclone, and when Hernan made landfall on October 3 near Barra de Navidad, Jalisco, it was only a minimal hurricane. Land weakened the cyclone, and by the time it emerged into the ocean north of Puerto Vallarta, it was so disorganized that it dissipated on October 5. At its strongest, Hurricane Hernan had winds of 85 mph (140 km/h) and a central pressure of .\n\nThe National Hurricane Center forecasts on the Hurricane were generally forecast slightly worse than the \"average\" system. Errors by tropical cyclone prediction models were attributed mainly to Hernan's recurvature. In terms of intensity, this system was correctly predicted to become a hurricane although advisories underforecast its eventual intensity.\n\nFor the coast from Acapulco to Manzanillo, a tropical storm warning was issued on October 1. A hurricane watch was issued from Zihuatanejo to Manzanillo on October 2. It was upgraded to a warning later that day. Also on October 2, the coast from Manzanillo to San Blas was placed under a tropical storm warning. Meanwhile, the hurricane warning was extended to Cabo Corrientes. On October 3, the hurricane warning was extended to San Blas and the tropical storm warning was extended to Mazatlán.\n\nBecause it made landfall in a sparsely populated area, Hernan killed no one. Around 1,000 homes were damaged or destroyed and 100 people were injured. Flooding occurred in Melaque, Jalisco. Flooding also caused washed-out roads along Mexico Route 200 and 80. In many areas, telephone service was interrupted and power outages occurred. Along the coasts of Colima and Jalisco, waves caused by Hernan reached 13 ft (3.9 m) in height.\n\nA system acquired enough convection and became organized enough to be considered a tropical depression on November 7. Although the environment was initially favourable and the system was almost upgraded into a tropical storm as was forecast, wind shear kept the cyclone weak. Its convection was eventually destroyed and advisories were ended on November 10. Twelve-E dissipated on November 11 and no deaths or damages were reported.\n\nThe following names were used for named storms that formed in the eastern Pacific in 1996. Names that were not assigned are marked in gray. No names were retired, so it was used again in the 2002 season. This is the same list used for the 1990 season, except for \"Winnie\", which had interchanged with Wallis.\n\nFor storms that form in the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility, encompassing the area between 140 degrees west and the International Date Line, all names are used in a series of four rotating lists. The next four names that were slated for use in 1996 are shown below; however, none of them were used.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2187637", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2187637", "title": "Danny Dichio", "text": "Danny Dichio\n\nDaniele Salvatore Ernest Dichio (born 19 October 1974) is an English retired professional footballer. He last played for Toronto FC in Major League Soccer as a forward, and is now the head coach of the Toronto FC Academy U19 team, as well as an analyst for Sportsnet and Fox Soccer News.\n\nDichio had the honour of scoring the first goal in Toronto FC history against the Chicago Fire on 12 May 2007. Later in that same game he became the first player in club history to be red-carded.\n\nBorn in Hammersmith, London, to an English mother and an Italian father, Dichio began his career at Queens Park Rangers, joining as an apprentice in June 1991 and turning professional in May 1993. The sale of Les Ferdinand to Newcastle United in the summer of 1995 provided Dichio with the opportunity to break into QPR's first team in the 1995–96 Premier League season. He scored on his league debut for QPR against Aston Villa, and forged a strike partnership with Kevin Gallen throughout the remainder of the season. Prior to his QPR debut, he played on loan at Barnet and Welling United. Dichio moved to Italy's Serie A with Sampdoria in the close season of 1996, and soon after had a loan spell at Lecce. He returned to England to join Sunderland in January 1998, helping them win promotion to the Premiership as Division One champions with 105 points in his first full season (1998–99), and finish seventh in the Premiership in the next two seasons.\n\nWhile at Sunderland, Dichio went on loan to West Bromwich Albion at the start of the 2001–02 season. The spell was a successful one, with Dichio scoring on his debut away at Sheffield Wednesday on 25 August 2001 and again on his home debut in a 1–0 win against Gillingham two days later. He joined the Midlands side permanently in November 2001 in a £1.25 million deal, and helped them to achieve promotion. In Albion's first Premiership campaign the following season, Dichio was their joint top scorer in the league (with Scott Dobie), though with just five Premiership goals, not enough to prevent relegation. He finished as top scorer overall by virtue of his FA Cup hat-trick against Bradford City. The following season saw Dichio move himself and his family up to the Midlands, having previously commuted from London. Despite settling in the area, however, he failed to regain a starting place in the team and in October 2003, he joined Derby on loan, scoring once against Ipswich Town. He then had another loan spell, this time at Millwall, whom he later joined on a permanent deal.\n\nDichio was unable to play in the 2004 FA Cup final for Millwall, due to suspension. He scored 10 goals in 27 starts for Millwall in the 2004–05 season. In the summer of 2005, he moved to Preston North End, but did not score in the league in his first season.\n\nIn the summer of 2006, he was the subject of a bid from Brighton. Although a fee was agreed, Dichio chose to stay at Preston and fight for his place. On 14 October 2006, he scored his first league goal for Preston in a 4–1 win over Sunderland. Dichio, despite a difficult start to his Preston career, won over the fans at Deepdale causing many to be greatly upset as the news broke that his move to Toronto was to be finalised.\n\nIn April 2007, Dichio was released from his contract to let him join the newly created MLS club Toronto FC.\n\nOver the next three seasons, Dichio made 59 league appearances for Toronto in the MLS, Canadian Championship and CONCACAF Champions League games. He scored 14 goals, including the club's first ever goal and the club's last goal of its inaugural season. He managed five goals in five shots on target to start the 2008 Major League Soccer season. That same year, Dichio also cemented his association with the Thornhill Soccer Club, a non-profit club that organises soccer leagues for age groups 4 and up, including adult leagues.\n\nOn 18 March 2009, he announced his intention retire after the 2009 Major League Soccer season and to continue living in Toronto while also pursuing coaching opportunities. However, on 9 September 2009, Dichio officially announced his retirement with six games remaining on Toronto FC's season schedule. His new role with the team will be as Toronto FC Team Ambassador, participating in local community appearances, and Academy Coach, where he will \"assist coaches on all three Toronto FC teams while beginning to learn about the nuances of MLS\". He remains much beloved of Toronto fans, who sing a song in his honour in the 24th minute of each game, commemorating his inaugural goal for the franchise (scored at 23:13 on 12 May 2007 vs. Chicago Fire).\n\nHe became a permanent resident of Canada in April 2009. In mid-2009, he began working with the Toronto FC Academy.\n\nFollowing the firing of head coach Preki in September 2010, Nick Dasovic was named interim head coach, and Dichio became an assistant coach. With new management put in place during the off season-Aron Winter as head coach and Bob de Klerk as assistant-Dichio moved within the club and was named head coach of the TFC Academy U-18 team. Dichio replaced former coach Jason Bent, who was with the Academy for three years before being promoted as Winter's second assistant.\n\nDichio is also the Technical Director for Thornhill Soccer Club.\n\n"}

He played college football at Rice University.\n\nDial was born in Ponca City, Oklahoma, but grew up in Magnolia, Texas. He attended Magnolia High School, where he played six-man football, while being a three-time All-District End and linebacker. He helped his team achieve district titles in his junior and senior years, although they lost the class B regional championship to Sugar Land High School in 1953 and to Barbers Hill High School in 1954.\n\nIn 2002, he was inducted into the National High School Hall of Fame.\n\nDial attended Rice University and played as a two-way end on the football team. In 1956, he had 21 receptions for 357 yards, five touchdowns, and was selected sophomore lineman of the year in the Southwest Conference. In 1957, he made 21 receptions (which led the Southwest Conference) for 508 yards, four touchdowns, and was named All-Southwest Conference. He contributed to Rice winning the conference championship in the Cotton Bowl Classic, and was named to the All-Bowl All-Star team. In 1958, he caught 19 passes for 264 yards and four touchdowns. He was the team's co-captain and Most Valuable Player. He also received consensus All-American and the Columbus Touchdown Club Lineman of the Year honors.\n\nDial recorded 61 receptions for 1,129 yards in his college career. He also posted 13 career receiving touchdowns, tying the school record set by James \"Froggie\" Williams.\n\nIn 1971, he was inducted into the Rice Athletics Hall of Fame. In 1993, he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame.\n\nDial was selected by the New York Giants in the second round (22nd overall) of the 1959 NFL Draft. He was waived before the start of the season on September 22, 1959.\n\nOn September 24, 1959, Dial was claimed off waivers by the Pittsburgh Steelers, teaming him with quarterback Bobby Layne. In 1960, Dial set a team record by having a 24.3-yard average per reception. He tallied 40 receptions for 972 yards and nine touchdowns.\n\nIn 1961, Dial registered 53 receptions (tied for eighth in the league) for 1,047 yards (fifth in the league), a 19.8-yard average (third in the league), and 12 touchdowns (second in the league and a Steelers franchise record). He became the first player in team history to gain 1,000 receiving yards and also set a team record with 235 receiving yards in the sixth game against the Cleveland Browns, including the longest pass play in Steelers history (88 yards). He set a franchise record by scoring at least one touchdown in 11 consecutive games.\n\nIn 1962, he recorded 50 receptions for 981 and six touchdowns. After scoring a touchdown against the Dallas Cowboys, a loud cannon charge was set off in front of him (a Steelers tradition) as he ran into the endzone; this was memorialized by NFL Films as one of the league's greatest follies. The team made the Playoff Bowl, losing 10-17 against the Detroit Lions.\n\nIn 1963, he collected 60 receptions (fifth in the league) for 1,295 yards (second in the league and breaking his club record), a 21.6-yard average (led the league) and 9 touchdowns (tied for seventh in the league).\n\nOn January 1, 1964, with the team looking to shore up its defense, Dial was traded to the Dallas Cowboys in exchange for first-round draft choice Scott Appleton, who was selected by the Cowboys after previously agreeing to the deal with the Steelers. Appleton ended up signing with the Houston Oilers of the American Football League, who had also drafted him in the first round. The persistence both teams showed in their attempts to sign Appleton became known as the \"Buddy Dial for Nothing\" trade. \n\nDial left with team records of 229 receptions for 4,723 receiving yards, 42 touchdown receptions, single-season touchdown receptions (12), single-game receiving yards (235), single-season receiving yards (1,295), career yard-per-reception average (21.6) and single-season yards-per-reception (24.3). He was a two-time Pro Bowl selection.\n\nIn 2018, he was inducted into the Steelers Hall of Honor.\n\nIn 1964, Dial started in one game, after being limited with a thigh injury he suffered in training camp that required surgery. He registered 11 receptions for 178 yards and one touchdown. His best game came against the Steelers, in which he tallied five receptions for 100 yards.\n\nIn 1965, he started seven games, before being passed on the depth chart by second-year player Peter Gent. Dial recorded 17 receptions for 283 yards and one touchdown in the season.\n\nIn 1966, he was a backup behind Gent, starting in three games, while making 14 receptions for 252 yards and one touchdown. In 1967, he was placed on the injured reserve list after having back surgery. He announced his retirement in 1968. Dial finished his career with 261 receptions for 5,436 yards, a 20.8-yard average (second in league history), 44 touchdowns, and four carries for 14 yards.\n\nDial started Christian devotional services with the Pittsburgh Steelers and Dallas Cowboys. While playing for the Steelers, he recorded an album of inspirational songs called \"Buddy Dial Sings on Word Records.\" In 1966, he recorded a single with Challenge Records 59352, called Baby/Back In The Old Days. It became a hit in various regional areas, topping the Dallas KLIF radio charts in late 1966 and early 1967, but failed to make the national charts.\n\nInjuries during his NFL career led to significant health problems brought on by the abuse of painkilling drugs (eventually losing a kidney), before receiving treatment in the late 1980s. On February 29, 2008, he died at the age of 71, of complications from prostate cancer and pneumonia.\n\n"}
{"id": "2187640", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2187640", "title": "D Train (music group)", "text": "D Train (music group)\n\nD Train was an American duo that had hits on the \"Billboard\" magazine Dance and R&B charts during the first half of the 1980s. Three of their singles also reached the Top 30 in the UK Singles Chart.\n\nThe project was a collaborative effort between the band's namesake, James D-Train Williams, who was featured as the lead vocalist and songwriter, and Hubert Eaves III, a keyboardist, who performed the instrumentation on the recordings. Hailing from Brooklyn, New York City, Williams himself was a R&B-dance producer as well. He and Eaves met during high school and began performing together. Eaves would spend most of the 1970s as a member of the R&B band Mtume. However, by the 1980s, he and Williams had teamed up again. The group named itself D-Train after a nickname Williams had acquired in high school.\n\nD Train released its first single \"You're the One for Me\" in late 1981. The track became an instant success, hitting number 1 on the US Hot Dance Club Play chart that year; it was remixed and re-released successfully several times since and was contemporaneously covered by Paul Hardcastle with vocalist Kevin Henry in the United Kingdom. The duo's self-titled debut album (which prominently featured the \"You're the One for Me\" title on the front cover, and the album became known by this name) followed in early 1982, and several additional singles from this effort were successful on both the R&B and Dance charts, although they were not as popular as the debut hit. Among these tracks were \"Keep On\", which reached number 2 on the Dance chart, and a cover version of the Burt Bacharach- and Hal David-penned \"Walk On By\", which owed more to the Isaac Hayes version than to Dionne Warwick's original recording.\n\nIn 1983, the band released its follow-up album, \"Music\". The title track became another dance-floor anthem and is the most gospel-infused of D Train's floor fillers. This track nearly equaled the success of the group's debut single. Several other singles from the album were moderately successful.\n\nIn 1984, D Train had its only \"Billboard\" Hot 100 entry with \"Something's on Your Mind,\" which climbed to number 79 and was later covered by Miles Davis on his album \"You're Under Arrest\". The single also cracked the top five on the R&B chart, becoming the group's biggest hit in that market as well. The accompanying album, also titled \"Something's on Your Mind\", found the band branching out into new musical territory, incorporating elements of reggae and more adult-oriented R&B into their music. Williams himself played acoustic guitar on a cover of Carole King's \"So Far Away\".\n\nA greatest hits album titled \"You're the One for Me-The Very Best of D Train\" was issued in several European countries in 1985. Featured on this compilation was a remixed version of \"You're the One for Me\" and the tune charted a second time that year. This version was remixed by Paul Hardcastle, who had previously issued a cover version of the song and, by 1985, had become well known for his own hit \"19\". Despite this success, the group disbanded that same year.\n\nFollowing the dissolution of the group, D Train continued on as a successful solo career. Although billed as a solo artist, however, he did continue to work with Eaves acting as a producer and key instrumentalist. In 1986, D Train released his debut album, \"Miracles of the Heart\", which featured a Top Ten R&B single, \"Misunderstanding\". The follow-up single, \"Oh, How I Love You, Girl\" also performed well in the R&B market.\n\nHis second album, \"In Your Eyes\" followed in 1988. The title track narrowly missed the R&B Top Ten, and one other single was also released.\n\nD Train's albums were eventually rereleased on CDs on Unidisc Music, which acquired Prelude Records and several other New York dance-music labels during the 1990s.\n\nThe song \"You're the One for Me\" exists in remixes by Larry Levan and Shep Pettibone, and most recently was sampled by DJ Kue in his 2006 hit \"I Got Love.\" \"You're the One for Me\" is also sampled in the song \"Girls\" by the Prodigy from its album \"Always Outnumbered Never Outgunned\".\n\nD Train contributed to the Pokémon anime's \"Pokérap\" on the official television soundtrack, \"2BA Master\".\n\nIn 1999, D-Train did the backup vocal for \"Eyes of a Child\", a song written by Trey Parker and Performed by Michael McDonald for the film, \"\".\n\nWilliams was hired as a DJ for Heart & Soul Channel 51 on the Sirius Satellite Radio service based in New York City from 2001 to 2008. In 2007, his performances of \"My Funny Valentine\" and Hot Chocolate's \"You Sexy Thing\" appeared on the soundtrack of the film \"Perfect Stranger\".\n\nThe Notorious B.I.G.'s \"Sky's the Limit\" interpolates part of D Train's 1982 song \"Keep On\".\n\nRapper Yo-Yo's \"Iz It Still All Good\" sampled D-Train's \"Something's on Your Mind,\" which featured Gerald LeVert, in 1998.\n\nIn 2007, ex-Moloko frontwoman Roisin Murphy issued her second solo album, \"Overpowered\". In interviews and radio appearances, she cited disco music as a major inspiration and noted D Train's \"Keep On\". For the \"Overpowered\" tour, Murphy medleyed the extended version of \"Keep On\" (in the form of audio samples from the original featuring Williams' vocals) with her own composition \"Let Me Know.\" The song was the only composition in Murphy's set list that was not co-written by herself.\n\n"}

{"id": "2187649", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2187649", "title": "1995 Pacific hurricane season", "text": "1995 Pacific hurricane season\n\nThe 1995 Pacific hurricane season was the least active Pacific hurricane season since 1979. Of the eleven tropical cyclones that formed during the season, four affected land, with the most notable storm of the season being Hurricane Ismael, which killed at least 116 people in Mexico. The strongest hurricane in the season was Hurricane Juliette, which reached peak winds of 150 mph (240 km/h), but did not significantly affect land. Hurricane Adolph was an early-season Category 4 hurricane. Hurricane Henriette brushed the Baja California Peninsula in early September.\n\nThe season officially started on May 15, 1995, in the Eastern Pacific, and on June 1, 1995, in the Central Pacific, and lasted until November 30, 1995. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. The season saw eleven tropical cyclones form, of which ten became tropical storms. Seven of these storms attained hurricane status, three of them becoming major hurricanes. There were fewer tropical storms than the average of 16, while the number of hurricanes and major hurricanes were slightly below average. The season marked the beginning of a multi-decade period of low activity in the Eastern Pacific.\n\nThe Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) index for the 1995 Pacific hurricane season in total is 100.2 units. Broadly speaking, ACE is a measure of the power of a tropical or subtropical storm multiplied by the length of time it existed. It is only calculated for full advisories on specific tropical and subtropical systems reaching or exceeding wind speeds of 39 mph (63 km/h).\n\nThe seasonal activity during 1995 was below normal, and marked the first of several seasons with lower than normal activity. Four tropical cyclones affected Mexico: first, Hurricane Flossie passed within 75 miles (120 km) of Baja California Peninsula, producing moderate winds and killing seven people. Afterwards, Tropical Storm Gil dropped heavy rainfall in Southern Mexico early in its life, though caused no damage. Hurricane Henriette later made landfall near Cabo San Lucas with winds of 100 mph (160 km/h), resulting in moderate damage but no deaths. Finally, Ismael struck the state of Sinaloa as a minimal hurricane. Offshore, fishermen were caught off guard by the hurricane, causing 57 of them to drown. On land, Ismael destroyed thousands of houses, leaving 30,000 homeless and killing another 59. Both Hurricanes Flossie and Ismael also produced moisture and localized damage in the Southwestern United States.\n\nActivity in the Central Pacific Ocean was below normal, as well. No tropical storms formed in the basin. For the first time in four years, Barbara was the only tropical cyclone to exist within the basin, but it formed in the Eastern Pacific. It entered as a weakening tropical storm, and quickly dissipated, without affecting land. It was the least activity in the basin since 1979, when the basin was completely quiet, as no storms entered the basin that year.\n\nA westward-moving tropical wave entered the Pacific Ocean in mid-May. Convection within the disturbance became more concentrated and organized on May 19 while the wave was located a short distance south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. The deep convection concentrated around a low-level circulation with expanding outflow, and the system developed into Tropical Depression One-E on May 21, while located about 400 mi (645 km) south of Manzanillo, Mexico. Initially the depression was forecast to strengthen to reach winds of 55 mph (90 km/h) as it moved westward under the influence of a high-pressure system to its north. Outflow increased as the storm moved through an area of warm waters and a favorable upper-level environment, and two satellite classifications indicated the system was at tropical storm status around nine hours after forming. Despite the favorable environment and satellite classifications of tropical storm status, the depression failed to organize further. The convection and organization continued to decrease, and on May 23 the depression dissipated.\n\nWhile it was developing, locally moderate to heavy rainfall fell across southern Mexico along the disturbance's northern periphery, with rainfall totals peaking at at Vallecitos/Petatlan.\n\nAn area of disturbed weather associated with a tropical wave organized off the southwest coast of Mexico during the middle of June. Banding features developed as a circulation persisted on the northeast side of its deep convection, and the system developed into Tropical Depression Two-E on June 15. Under weak steering currents, the depression moved slowly northward, and with deep convection organizing near its center, the depression intensified to Tropical Storm Adolph on June 16. Located in an area of warm waters, Adolph exhibited a well-defined outflow pattern, and rapidly strengthened to attain hurricane status on June 17 as a banding-type eye developed. Hurricane Adolph turned to the northwest and attained major hurricane status late that same day. The small eye of the hurricane continued to organize, as very deep convection surrounded the eyewall, and Adolph reached its peak intensity of 135 mph (215 km/h) on June 18, making it a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale. Shortly thereafter, the storm weakened, as the upper-level environment became more hostile, and the system moved over progressively cooler waters. On June 19, Adolph turned to the west, and degenerated back into a tropical storm later that day. On June 20, the storm weakened to a tropical depression, and on June 21, Adolph began to dissipate as its center became devoid of deep convection.\n\nAs Adolph moved north towards Mexico while about 290 mi (465 km) off the coast, the Mexican government issued a tropical storm warning and a hurricane watch from Punta Tejupan to Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco. When the storm turned to the northwest and later to the west, the government discontinued the warnings as it was determined the storm would not be a threat to land. No damage or casualties were reported.\n\nA few days later, on June 24, another weak tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa. It moved steadily westward through the Atlantic Ocean without any development, and entered the eastern Pacific Ocean on July 5. At this point, convection developed along the wave axis, and the system gradually organized. A circulation developed as it passed through an area of warm waters, and the system developed into Tropical Depression Three-E on July 7, while located about 600 miles (965 km) south of Manzanillo, Colima. Although the outer rainbands warmed slightly in the hours after the formation, the convection near the center deepened further with favorable upper-level outflow, and the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Barbara early on July 8. Barbara steadily intensified, and following the development of a ragged eye that night, Barbara strengthened into a hurricane on July 9, while located about 700 miles (1130 km) south of the southern tip of Baja California Peninsula.\n\nAfter moving into an area of light vertical shear and warm water temperatures, Barbara quickly intensified to reach major hurricane status on July 10. The eye continued to become better organized, and Barbara attained winds of 135 mph (215 km/h) later on July 10. After maintaining its intensity for 24 hours, increased wind shear from an upper-tropospheric trough degraded the appearance of the deepest convection, and the eye became obscured from satellite images. After weakening to a 115 mph (185 km/h) hurricane, Barbara maintained its intensity for 30 hours before moving into an area with very warm waters and a favorable upper-level environment. On July 13, the hurricane re-organized, a distinct eye again developed, and Barbara strengthened to reach its peak intensity of 140 mph (225 km/h) later that day. Barbara continued westward under the influence of a subtropical ridge to its north, and began to steadily weaken on July 14 as it moved into an area of cooler water temperatures. The hurricane degraded to a tropical storm on July 16, and a day later it deteriorated to a tropical depression. As a depression with little to no convection near its center, Barbara continued west-northwestward until dissipating on July 18 while located 720 mi (1160 km) east-southeast of Hilo, Hawaii. Barbara remained away from land for its entire lifetime, and it did not cause any damage or deaths.\n\nAs Barbara moved away from land, another area of disturbed weather moved off the coast of Central America on July 11. Moving westward, this area slowly organized, and developed a low-level circulation on July 22. The convection developed into curved rainbands, and based on Dvorak classifications of 35 mph (55 km/h), the National Hurricane Center estimated that the system developed into Tropical Depression Four-E on July 17, while located about 400 mi (645 km) south-southeast of the southern tip of Baja California Peninsula. As the depression was situated in an area with warm waters and moderate upper-level outflow, the system was forecast to slowly intensify to a 50 mph (80 km/h) tropical storm. Initially, the depression followed the forecasts, and it intensified into a tropical storm about 30 hours after developing, receiving the name \"\"Cosme\"\". Cosme was expected to strengthen only slightly due to predicted cooler waters and increased shear.\n\nOn July 18, contrary to the predictions, Cosme became much better organized, and well-defined banding features were visible on satellite imagery. The storm continued to steadily intensify, and subsequent to the development of an eye, Cosme strengthened into a hurricane late on July 19, while located 380 miles (615 km) west-southwest of the southern tip of Baja California Peninsula. After maintaining hurricane status for 18 hours, Cosme weakened back to a tropical storm on July 20. Cooler water temperatures deteriorated the convection near the center, resulting in Cosme quickly weakening to a tropical depression on July 21. After turning to the west-southwest, Cosme dissipated on July 22. Cosme never affected land, and as a result caused no damage or fatalities. However, the intensity of the storm is still uncertain; late on July 18, a ship to the east of Cosme reported winds of 17 mph (27 km/h), despite that a normal 50 mph (80 km/h) tropical storm would produce tropical storm force winds for locations within at least 70 mi (110 km) of the center.\n\nA tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on July 11. It moved westward and quickly developed two areas of convection along the wave axis. One of the areas nearly developed into a tropical depression after moving northwestward, though it failed to organize further and dissipated. The southern area continued westward and ultimately entered the eastern Pacific Ocean on July 21. Thunderstorms along the wave axis became more concentrated a few hundred miles south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec, and the system developed into Tropical Depression Five-E on July 24 while located 500 mi (800 km) southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico.\n\nLocated in an area of weak steering currents and easterly wind shear, the tropical depression drifted to the north-northeast while the convection was displaced up to 70 mi (110 km) west of the circulation. Slightly strengthening occurred, and on July 25 the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Dalila. The storm turned to the northwest, and later to the west-northwest, and remained a minimal tropical storm until July 28 when a decrease in wind shear allowed Dalila to strengthen. A strong anticyclone developed to the north of the system, causing Dalila to accelerate to the northwest. Late on July 28, Dalila reached a peak intensity of 65 mph (105 km/h) at a position 570 mi (915 km) southwest of Cabo San Lucas. Tropical Storm Dalila slowly weakened after moving over progressively cooler water temperatures, and on August 1 it degenerated into a tropical depression. Dalila turned to the southwest after much of the convection waned, and the system dissipated on August 2.\n\nOn July 17 a tropical wave exited the coast of Africa, and moved westward. An area of convection along the wave organized slightly on July 18, though the next day the convection diminished. After moving through the Windward Islands on July 23, deep convection again increased. The system failed to organize further, though convection continued to develop upon entering the eastern Pacific Ocean on July 27. The cloudiness and thunderstorms became more consolidated off the coast of southern Mexico, and on July 31 Dvorak classifications began on the system. A circulation developed, and the system organized into Tropical Depression Six-E on August 1 while located about 520 mi (835 km) south of the southern tip of Baja California Peninsula.\n\nInitially, the depression was a small system with moderate amounts of easterly wind shear. It organized slowly, and after moving to the southwest for 24 hours it turned to the northwest. Subsequent to an increase in convection over the center, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Erick on August 4. Erick gradually strengthened as it moved to the west-northwest, and reached peak winds of 65 mph (105 km/h) on August 5 while located about 720 miles (1160 km) southwest of Cabo San Lucas. Operationally, the storm was forecast to continue to strengthen to reach hurricane status, though this did not occur. The mid-level ridge which had been tracking Erick westward weakened, resulting in Erick to turn to the north over cooler waters. It quickly weakened to a tropical depression on August 6, and after turning to an eastward drift Erick dissipated on August 8 while located 700 mi (1130 km) west-southwest of the southern tip of Baja California Peninsula. Erick never affected land.\n\nA large circulation with an area of low pressure persisted in the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean in early August. The large circulation was well-developed by August 7, and the convection concentrated a few hundred miles southwest of Acapulco. Based on its organization, the National Hurricane Center designated the system Tropical Depression Seven-E. On August 8, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Flossie, based on ship reports. The storm paralleled the coast of Mexico as it moved northwestward, and after a decrease of wind shear Flossie developed very deep convection over its center. It intensified into a hurricane on August 10, reaching peak winds of as an embedded warm spot appeared in the center of the storm. After maintaining its peak intensity for 18 hours and passing within of Baja California Peninsula, Flossie weakened over cooler waters and degenerated to a tropical storm on August 12. The storm continued to weaken, and early on August 14 Flossie dissipated.\n\nThe government of Mexico issued a tropical storm warning from Punta Tejupan to Cabo Corrientes early in its life, though it was discontinued shortly thereafter. Officials issued a tropical storm watch and later a warning for Baja California Sur south of La Paz, which was later extended from Loreto on the east coast to San Juanico on the west coast. The large circulation of Hurricane Flossie produced gusty winds along the west coast of Mexico and southern Baja California Peninsula. Cabo San Lucas reported a gust of 55 mph (90 km/h), and San José del Cabo recorded a gust of 65 mph (105 km/h). The storm produced heavy rainfall, peaking at at San Felipe/Los Cabos. Seven people died in Mexico from the storm, including two that drowned in Cabo San Lucas. A monsoon surge moving around its eastern periphery produced heavy rainfall in the American Southwest. Flooding from the rainfall killed one person and left eleven motorists stranded. Thunderstorms in Tucson, Arizona, produced hurricane-force wind gusts which caused widespread power outages and damage. Damage from the storm in Arizona totaled to $5 million (1995 USD; $  USD), although damage in Mexico, if any, is unknown.\n\nAn area of disturbed weather, possibly related to a tropical wave, persisted and gradually organized in the Gulf of Tehuantepec. A circulation developed within its deep convection, and the system organized into Tropical Depression Seven-E on August 19 while located about 115 mi (185 km) southeast of Acapulco. Operationally, it was not until 15 hours later that the National Hurricane Center initiated advisories on the system. The depression moved westward and quickly intensified into a tropical storm. A nearby ship confirmed the existence of tropical storm force winds, and Gil reached winds of 50 mph (80 km/h) early on August 21. With well-defined outflow and continually developing convection, forecasters predicted Gil to strengthen more and attain hurricane status within two days of becoming a tropical storm. However, increased northeasterly wind shear initially prevented further strengthening.\n\nOn August 22, the cloud pattern of Gil became better organized, though the low-level circulation was located to the northeast of the deep convection due to the wind shear. The shear also limited outflow to the east, preventing further strengthening. Gradually the convection developed nearer to the center. After Gil turned to the northwest, the deep convection organized into a central dense overcast, and it strengthened to reach winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) on August 24. Later that day the storm attained a peak strength of 65 mph (105 km/h) while located 380 mi (610 km) southwest of the southern tip of Baja California Peninsula. After maintaining its peak strength for 30 hours, Gil moved over progressively cooler waters, and weakened to a tropical depression on August 26. The depression drifted westward and later turned to the north, and dissipated on August 27 while located 670 mi (1075 km) to the west of Cabo San Lucas. While located a short distance off of Mexico, Gil produced heavy rainfall near the coast. However, there were no reports of casualties or damages in association with the storm.\nA tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on August 15. It traversed westward and entered the eastern Pacific Ocean on August 29. The system quickly developed deep convection and a low-level circulation, and on September 1 it organized into Tropical Depression Nine-E while located about 170 mi (270 km) off the southwest coast of Mexico. Under favorable conditions, the depression slowly strengthened to become Tropical Storm Henriette on September 2 while located 220 mi (350 km) west of Manzanillo. Henriette quickly organized and intensified into a hurricane on September 3 while located 135 mi (235 km) west-southwest of Puerto Vallarta in Jalisco. Late on September 3, an eye began to form in the center of the deep convection as Henriette turned to the northwest. The eye became better defined the next day, and Henriette attained a peak intensity of 100 mph (160 km/h) as the northern portion of the eyewall moved over southern Baja California Peninsula. The hurricane quickly crossed the southern tip of Baja California Peninsula and re-emerged into the Pacific Ocean. Convection gradually waned as the hurricane moved over progressively colder waters, and on September 6 Henriette weakened to a tropical depression.\n\nOn September 2, a few hours after Henriette became a tropical storm, the government of Mexico issued tropical cyclone warnings and watches for Baja California Peninsula. The threat of Hurricane Henriette prompted a Carnival Cruise Line ship to alter their route. Winds of up to in southern Baja California Sur left much of Cabo San Lucas without water or power. 2,000 people were directly affected by the hurricane. A strong storm surge produced flooding and heavy road damage in the state. 800 people were forced from their homes, and crop damage was reported. No damage estimates are available, and no deaths were reported.\nHurricane Ismael developed from a persistent area of deep convection on September 12, and steadily strengthened as it moved to the north-northwest. Ismael attained hurricane status on September 14 while located 210 mi (340 km) off the coast of Mexico. It continued to the north, and after passing a short distance east of Baja California Peninsula it made landfall on Topolobampo in the state of Sinaloa with winds of 80 mph (130 km/h). Ismael rapidly weakened over land, and dissipated on September 16 over northwestern Mexico. The remnants entered the United States and extended eastward into the mid-Atlantic states.\n\nOffshore, Ismael produced waves of up to 30 ft (9 m) in height. Hundreds of fishermen were unprepared by the hurricane, which was expected to move more slowly, and as a result 52 ships were wrecked, killing 57 fishermen. The hurricane destroyed thousands of houses, leaving 30,000 people homeless. On land, Ismael caused 59 casualties in mainland Mexico and resulted in $26 million in damage (1995 USD; $  USD). Moisture from the storm extended into the United States, causing heavy rainfall and localized moderate damage in southeastern New Mexico.\nHurricane Juliette was the strongest and final hurricane of the season. It formed on September 16 from a tropical wave off the southwest coast of Mexico, and moved west-northwest for the early part of its duration. Juliette was smaller than usual tropical cyclones, and as a result it intensified quickly, reaching hurricane status on September 18 and major hurricane status a day later. On September 20, Juliette reached peak winds of 150 mph (240 km/h), a Category 4 on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. It subsequently began a slow weakening trend and turned toward the northeast, briefly threatening the Baja California Peninsula. Instead, strong wind shear overcame the storm, and Juliette dissipated on September 26 without significantly affecting land.\nAccording to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), on January 4 a tropical depression formed east of the International Dateline on January 4, and three days later it exited CPHC's area of responsibility. According to the JTWC and Japan Meteorological Agency, on November 10 a tropical depression formed east of the International Dateline on November 10, and soon it exited CPHC's area of responsibility.\n\nThe following names were used for named storms that formed in the northeast Pacific in 1995. Names that were not assigned are marked in gray. The names not retired from this list were used again in the 2001 season. This is the same list used for the 1989 season with the exception of Wallis, which switched places with Winnie, the original \"W\" name on this list. The name Dalila was used for the first time in 1995; in the 1989 season, it was Dalilia, though an error in documents prior to the season changed it. The name change has remained.\n\nFor storms that form in the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility, encompassing the area between 140 degrees west and the International Date Line, all names are used in a series of four rotating lists. The next four names that were slated for use in 1995 are shown below, however none of them were used.\n\nThe World Meteorological Organization retired one name in the spring of 1996: Ismael. Originally slated to be replaced by Israel, Ismael was ultimately replaced with Ivo for the 2001 season.\n\nThis is a table of all the storms that have formed in the 1995 Pacific hurricane season. It includes their duration, names, landfall(s), denoted in parentheses, damages, and death totals.

She meets Bhima in the 9th sub-parva (Hidimva-vadha Parva) of the Adi Parva. \n\nShe is also referred to as Bhuṭandevī (भुटनदेवी) or Pallavī (पल्लवी).\n\nThe story begins in the Lākṣāgṛha of the Mahābhārata after the Pāṇḍavās reached a dense forest. Exhausted from their travels, they all fell asleep at night, except for Bhīma who kept watch. \n\nIn the same forest lived Hiḍimbī and her brother Hiḍimbā, a very powerful rakshasa. He smelled the Pāṇḍavās at a distance and as usual asked the goddess Hiḍimbī to lure the well-built Bhīma into a trap so he could eat him. Hiḍimbī confronted Bhīma and instead fell in love with him. She assumed the form of a very beautiful lady and approached Bhīma, expressing her desire to marry him by revealing her true identity, as well as her brother's intentions. Bhīma confronted Hiḍimbā but was soon overpowered. It was only with the supernatural powers of Hiḍimbī, supporting Bhīma from a distance, that he could overcome and slay Hiḍimbā. Kuntī and other Pāṇḍavās all watched the duel from a distance.\n\nAfter killing Hiḍimbā, Kuntī ordered Bhīma to marry Hiḍimbī. Bhīma agreed on the condition that he could leave her once she bore a child. Hiḍimbī agreed and they married. Within a year, Hiḍimbī gave birth to a son. They named him Ghaṭotkaca as his head resembled a pot. Ghaṭotkaca went on to become a great warrior and an important figure in the Mahābhārata war.\n\nThe Madhyamavyayoga or Madhyama Vyāyoga (, ) (English:The Middle One) is a great Sanskrit play attributed to Bhāsa. The story is about the reunion of Bhīma and Ghaṭotkaca as father and son that takes place under the pretext of Hiḍimbā's desire for human flesh. While the characters in this tale are taken from the \"Mahābhārata\", this particular incident is produced solely from the works of Bhāsa.\n\n\nThe most famous temple is the Hiḍimbā Devi Temple in Manali. Some of the sacred objects enshrined here include chariots, footprints and a small statue. Hiḍimbā is one of the most powerful deities in Kullu Valley. The pagoda-shaped wooden temple, with its intricately-carved wooden doors and wooden shikhara is believed to be over 500 years old. It is said that the carver of the artwork at this temple had his hands cut off after completion of his work so that he could never again produce such beautiful work anywhere else. It is also situated among the Deodar forests.\n\nBelievers may travel to the town of Kullu to participate in the annual festival of Dussehra, where Hiḍimbā's chariot leads a rally of gods from all over Kullu valley, escorting the main chariot of Raghunāth. At the end of the seven-day festivities, on the \"Lanka Dahan\" day, sacrifices are made to Hiḍimbā. Ghaṭotkaca is also a popular deity in the neighboring Banjar village and Siraj district.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2187652", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2187652", "title": "Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis", "text": "Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis\n\nNeuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis is the general name for a family of at least eight genetically separate neurodegenerative lysosomal storage diseases that result from excessive accumulation of lipopigments (lipofuscin) in the body's tissues. These lipopigments are made up of fats and proteins. Their name comes from the word stem \"lipo-\", which is a variation on \"lipid\" or \"fat\", and from the term \"pigment\", used because the substances take on a greenish-yellow color when viewed under an ultraviolet light microscope. These lipofuscin materials build up in neuronal cells and many organs, including the liver, spleen, myocardium and kidneys.\n\nThe classic characterization of the group of neurodegenerative, lysosomal storage disorders called the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs) is through the progressive, permanent loss of motor and psychological ability with a severe intracellular accumulation of lipofuscins, with the United States and northern European populations having slightly higher frequency with an occurrence of 1 in 10,000. There are four classic diagnoses that have received the most attention from researchers and the medical field, differentiated from one another by age of symptomatic onset, duration, early-onset manifestations such as blindness or seizures, and the forms which lipofuscin accumulation takes.\n\nIn the early infantile variant of NCL (also called INCL or Santavuori-Haltia), probands appear normal at birth, but early visual loss leading to complete retinal blindness by the age of 2 years is the first indicator of the disease; by 3 years of age a vegetative state is reached and by 4 years isoelectric encephalograms confirm brain death. Late infantile variant usually manifests between 2 and 4 years of age with seizures and deterioration of vision. The maximum age before death for late infantile variant is 10–12 years. Juvenile NCL (JNCL, Batten disease, or Spielmeyer-Vogt), with a prevalence of 1 in 100,000, usually arises between 4 and 10 years of age; the first symptoms include considerable vision loss due to retinal dystrophy, with seizures, psychological degeneration, and eventual death in the mid- to late 20s or 30s ensuing. Adult variant NCL (ANCL or Kuf’s disease) is less understood and generally manifests milder symptoms; however, while symptoms typically appear around 30 years of age, death usually occurs ten years later.\n\nAll the mutations that have been associated with this disease have been linked to genes involved with the neural synapses metabolism – most commonly with the reuse of vesicle proteins.\n\nChildhood NCLs are generally autosomal recessive disorders; that is, they occur only when a child inherits two copies of the defective gene, one from each parent. When both parents carry one defective gene, each of their children faces one in four chance of developing NCL. At the same time, each child also faces a one in two chance of inheriting just one copy of the defective gene. Individuals who have only one defective gene are known as carriers, meaning they do not develop the disease, but they can pass the gene on to their own children. The most commonly identified mutations are in the \"CLN3\" gene. This gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 16 (16p12.1). The normal function of the gene is not presently known but is a transmembrane protein.\n\nAdult NCL may be inherited as an autosomal recessive (Kufs) or, less often, as an autosomal dominant (Parry's) disorder. In autosomal dominant inheritance, all people who inherit a single copy of the disease gene develop the disease. As a result, there are no unaffected carriers of the gene.\n\nMany authorities refer to the NCLs collectively as Batten disease.\n\nBecause vision loss is often an early sign, Batten disease/NCL may be first suspected during an eye exam. An eye doctor can detect a loss of cells within the eye that occurs in the three childhood forms of Batten disease/NCL. However, because such cell loss occurs in other eye diseases, the disorder cannot be diagnosed by this sign alone. Often an eye specialist or other physician who suspects Batten disease/NCL may refer the child to a neurologist, a doctor who specializes in disease of the brain and nervous system. In order to diagnose Batten disease/NCL, the neurologist needs the patient's medical history and information from various laboratory tests.\n\nDiagnostic tests used for Batten disease/NCLs include:\n\n\nThe older classification of NCL divided the condition into four types (CLN1, CLN2, CLN3, and CLN4) based upon age of onset, while newer classifications divide it by the associated gene.\n\nCLN4 (unlike CLN1, CLN2, and CLN3) has not been mapped to a specific gene.\n\nNonsense and frameshift mutations in the CLN1 gene (located at \n1p32) always induce classical INCL, while some missense mutations have been associated with ANCL in addition to the Infantile and Juvenile forms. The mutation typically results in a deficient form of a lysosomal enzyme called palmitoyl protein thioesterase 1 (PPT1).\n\nThe wild type PPT1 is a 306 amino acid polypeptide that is typically targeted for transport into lysosomes by the mannose 6-phosphate (M6P) receptor mediated pathway. Here the protein appears to function in removing palmitate residues by cleaving thioester linkages in s-acylated (or palmitoylated) proteins, encouraging their breakdown. Defective polypeptides, however, are unable to exit the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), most likely due to misfolding; further analyses of this pathway could serve to categorize INCL among lysosomal enzyme deficiencies. It is important to note that the human PPT gene shows 91% similarity to bovine PPT and 85% similarity to rat PPT; these data indicate that the PPT gene is highly conserved and likely plays a vital role in cell metabolism. In addition buildup of defective PPT1 in the ER has been shown to cause the increased release of Ca2+. This homeostasis-altering event leads to increased mitochondrial membrane permeability and subsequent activation of caspase-9, eventually leading to an accumulation of cleaved and uncleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and eventual apoptosis.\n\nThe CLN2 gene encodes a 46kDa protein called lysosomal tripeptidyl peptidase I (TPP1) which cleaves tripeptides from terminal amine groups of partially unfolded proteins. Mutations of this gene typically result in a LINCL phenotype.\n\nOn April 27, 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Brineura (cerliponase alfa) as the first specific treatment for NCL. Brineura is enzyme replacement therapy manufactured through recombinant DNA technology. The active ingredient in Brineura, cerliponase alfa, is intended to slow loss of walking ability in symptomatic pediatric patients 3 years of age and older with late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2 (CLN2), also known as tripeptidyl peptidase-1 (TPP1) deficiency. Brineura is administered into the cerebrospinal fluid by infusion via a surgically implanted reservoir and catheter in the head (intraventricular access device).\n\nAll mutations resulting in the Juvenile variant of NCL have been shown to occur at the CLN3 gene on 16p12; of the mutations known to cause JNCL, 85% result from a 1.02 kb deletion, with a loss of amino acids 154–438, while the remaining 15% appear to result from either point or frameshift mutations. The wild type CLN3 gene codes for a protein with no known function; however, studies of the yeast CLN3 ortholog, the product of which is called Battenin (after its apparent connections to Batten’s Disease, or JNCL), have suggested that the protein may play a role in lysosomal pH homeostasis. Furthermore, recent studies have also implied the protein’s role in cathepsin D deficiency; the overexpression of the defective protein appears to have significant effects on cathepsin D processing, with implications suggesting that accumulation of ATP synthase subunit C would result. Only recently have studies of human patients shown deficiency of lysosomal aspartyl proteinase cathepsin D.\n\nBetween 1.3% and 10% of cases are of the adult form. The age at onset is variable (6–62 yr). Two main clinical subtypes have been described: progressive myoclonus epilepsy (type A) and dementia with motor disturbances, such as cerebellar, extrapyramidal signs and dyskinesia (type B). Unlike the other NCLs retinal degeneration is absent. Pathologically the ceroid-lipofuscin accumulates mainly in neurons and contains subunit C of the mitochondrial ATP synthase.\n\nTwo independent families have been shown to have mutations in the DNAJC5 gene – one with a transversion and the other with a deletion mutation. The mutations occur in a cysteine-string domain, which is required for membrane targeting/binding, palmitoylation and oligomerization of the encoded protein cysteine-string protein alpha (CSPα). The mutations dramatically decrease the affinity of CSPα for the membrane. A second report has also located this disease to this gene.\n\nCurrently there is no widely accepted treatment that can cure, slow down, or halt the symptoms in the great majority of patients with NCL. However, seizures may be controlled or reduced with use of anti-epileptic drugs. Additionally, physical, speech, and occupational therapies may help affected patients retain functioning for as long as possibleSeveral experimental treatments are under investigation.\n\nIn 2001 it was reported a drug used to treat cystinosis, a rare genetic disease that can cause kidney failure if not treated, may be useful in treating the infantile form of NCL. Preliminary results report the drug has completely cleared away storage material from the white blood cells of the first six patients, as well as slowing down the rapid neurodegeneration of infantile NCL.\n\nCurrently there are two drug trials underway for infantile Batten disease/NCL. Both trials are using Cystagon.\n\nA gene therapy trial using an adeno-associated virus vector called AAV2CUhCLN2 began in June 2004 in an attempt to treat the manifestations of Late Infantile NCL. The trial was conducted by Weill Medical College of Cornell University and sponsored by the Nathan's Battle Foundation. In May 2008, it was reported that the gene therapy given to the recipients was \"safe; and that, on average, it significantly slowed the disease's progression during the 18-month follow-up period\" and \"suggested that higher doses and a better delivery system may provide greater benefit\".\n\nA second gene therapy trial for Late Infantile NCL using an adeno-associated virus derived from rhesus macaque (a species of Old World monkey) called AAVrh.10 began in August 2010 and is once again being conducted by Weill Medical College of Cornell University. Animal models of Late Infantile NCL showed that the AAVrh.10 delivery system \"was much more effective, giving better spread of the gene product and improving survival greatly\".\n\nA third gene therapy trial, using the same AAVrh.10 delivery system, began in 2011 and been expanded to include Late Infantile NCL patients with moderate/severe impairment or uncommon genotypes and uses a novel administration method that reduces general anesthesia time by 50% in order to minimize potential adverse side effects.\n\nA painkiller available in several European countries, Flupirtine, has been suggested to possibly slow down the progress of NCL, particularly in the juvenile and late infantile forms. No trial has been officially supported in this venue, however. Currently the drug is available to NCL families either from Germany, Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina, and the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, Ontario.\n\nOn October 20, 2005, the Food and Drug Administration approved a phase I clinical trial of neural stem cells to treat infantile and late infantile Batten disease. Subsequent approval from an independent review board also approved the stem cell therapy in early March 2006. This treatment will be the first ever transplant of fetal stem cells performed on humans. The therapy is being developed by Stem Cells Inc and is estimated to have six patients. The treatment will be carried out in Oregon.\n\nJuvenile NCL has recently been listed on the Federal Clinical Trials website to test the effectiveness of bone marrow/stem cell transplants for this condition. A bone marrow transplant has been attempted in the late infantile form of NCL with disappointing results; while the transplant may have slowed the onset of the disease, the child eventually developed the disease and died in 1998.\n\nTrials testing the effectiveness of bone marrow transplants for infantile NCL in Finland have also been disappointing, with only a slight slowing of disease reported.\n\nIn late 2007, it was reported by Dr. David Pearce et al. that Cellcept, an immunosuppressant medication commonly used in bone marrow transplants, may be useful in slowing down the progress of Juvenile NCL. Fundraising is currently underway to gather the funds needed to start a clinical trial to test the safety and efficiency of CellCept for Juvenile NCL.\n\nOn April 27, 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Brineura (cerliponase alfa) as the first specific treatment for NCL. Brineura is enzyme replacement therapy manufactured through recombinant DNA technology. The active ingredient in Brineura, cerliponase alpha, is intended to slow loss of walking ability in symptomatic pediatric patients 3 years of age and older with late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2 (CLN2), also known as tripeptidyl peptidase-1 (TPP1) deficiency. Brineura is administered into the cerebrospinal fluid by infusion via a surgically implanted reservoir and catheter in the head (intraventricular access device).\n\nIncidence can vary greatly from type-to-type, and from country-to-country.\n\nIn Germany, one study reported an incidence of 1.28 per 100,000.\n\nA study in Italy reported an incidence of 0.56 per 100,000.\n\nA study in Norway reported an incidence of 3.9 per 100,000 using the years from 1978 to 1999, with a lower rate in earlier decades.\n\nThe first probable instances of this condition were reported in 1826 in a Norwegian medical journal by Dr. Christian Stengel, who described 4 affected siblings in a small mining community in Norway. Although no pathological studies were performed on these children the clinical descriptions are so succinct that the diagnosis of the Spielmeyer-Sjogren (juvenile) type is fully justified.\n\nMore fundamental observations were reported by F. E. Batten in 1903, and by Heinrich Vogt in 1905, who performed extensive clinicopathological studies on several families. Retrospectively, these papers disclose that the authors grouped together different types of the syndrome. Furthermore, Batten, at least for some time, insisted that the condition that he described was distinctly different from Tay–Sachs disease, the prototype of a neuronal lysosomal disorder now identified as GM2 gangliosidosis type A. Around the same time, Walther Spielmeyer reported detailed studies on three siblings, suffering from the Spielmeyer-Sjogren (juvenile) type, which led him to the very firm statement that this malady is not related to Tay–Sachs disease. Subsequently, however, the pathomorphological studies of Károly Schaffer made these authors change their minds to the extent that they reclassified their respective observations as variants of Tay–Sachs disease, which caused confusion lasting about 50 years.\n\nIn 1913–14, Max Bielschowsky delineated the late infantile form of NCL. However, all forms were still thought to belong in the group of \"familial amaurotic idiocies\", of which Tay–Sachs was the prototype.\n\nIn 1931, Torsten Sjögren, the Swedish psychiatrist and geneticist, presented 115 cases with extensive clinical and genetic documentation and came to the conclusion that the disease which we now call the Spielmeyer-Sjogren (juvenile) type is genetically separate from Tay–Sachs.\n\nDeparting from the careful morphological observations of Spielmeyer, Hurst, and Sjovall and Ericsson, Zeman and Alpert made a determined effort to document the previously suggested pigmentary nature of the neuronal deposits in certain types of storage disorders. Simultaneously, Terry and Korey and Svennerholm demonstrated a specific ultrastructure and biochemistry for Tay–Sachs disease, and these developments led to the distinct identification and also separation of the NCLs from Tay–Sachs disease by Zeman and Donahue. At that time, it was proposed that the late-infantile (Jansky–Bielschowsky), the juvenile (Spielmeyer–Vogt), and the adult form (Kufs) were quite different from Tay–Sachs disease with respect to chemical pathology and ultrastructure and also different from other forms of sphingolipidoses.\n\nSubsequently, it was shown by Santavuori and Haltia that an infantile form of NCL exists, which Zeman and Dyken had included with the Jansky Bielschowsky type.\n\n"}

{"id": "2187670", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2187670", "title": "1994 Pacific hurricane season", "text": "1994 Pacific hurricane season\n\nThe 1994 Pacific hurricane season was the final season of the eastern north Pacific's consecutive active hurricane seasons that unofficially started in 1982. The season officially started on May 15, 1994, in the eastern Pacific, and on June 1, 1994, in the central Pacific, and lasted until November 30, 1994. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. The first tropical cyclone formed on June 18, while the last system dissipated on October 26. This season, twenty-two tropical cyclones formed in the north Pacific Ocean east of the dateline, with all but two becoming tropical storms or hurricanes. A total of 10 hurricanes occurred, including five major hurricanes. The above average activity in 1994 was contributed to the ongoing 1990-95 El Niño at the time.\n\nOf note in this season is an unusual spree of very intense storms; the season was the first on record to see three Category 5 hurricanes, later tied in 2002 and 2018. Hurricanes Emilia, Gilma, John, and Olivia all reached a pressure below 930 millibars. Longevity-wise, no tropical cyclone of any basin had previously persisted for as long as Hurricane John, which lasted 31 days. Elsewhere, Hurricane Rosa caused four casualties in Mexico as the basin's lone landfalling tropical storm or hurricane, and later was responsible for flooding in Texas.\n\nThis season, twenty-two tropical cyclones formed in the north Pacific Ocean east of the dateline. All but two of them became tropical storms or hurricanes. In the Eastern Pacific region (140°W to North America), nineteen tropical depressions formed, of which seventeen became tropical storms, nine further intensifying into hurricanes, and five ultimately reaching major hurricanes of Category 3 intensity or higher on the Saffir Simpson Scale. These numbers are slightly above the long-term averages of fifteen tropical storms, nine hurricanes, and four major hurricanes.\nIn the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility (140°W to the International Date Line), three depressions, two tropical storms, and one hurricane formed. Overall, there were eleven tropical cyclones, eight tropical storms, five hurricanes, and three major hurricanes that formed or entered the Central Pacific region. These numbers are well above the long-term average of four tropical cyclones, two hurricanes, one tropical storm, and two depressions. The exceptionally high activity was contributed to by an El Niño ongoing at the time.\n\nThe only named storm to make landfall this year was Hurricane Rosa, which killed four people in Western Mexico and forced over 400 to be evacuated. Other notable storms include Hurricane Olivia, a high-end Category 4 system, the three Category 5 hurricanes Emilia, Gilma, and John. Both John and Hurricane Li existed in two of the three basins (East, and West) of the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThis season marked the end of the Northeastern Pacific's most recent active period, which began in 1982, and at the time, included the five most active Pacific hurricane seasons. Beginning in 1995, multi-decadal factors switched to a phase that suppressed Pacific hurricane activity. After 1994, Pacific hurricane seasons were generally been below normal, with the exception of 1997, until 2014.\n\nThe 1994 Pacific hurricane season set several records. First, three hurricanes reached Category 5 intensity on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, setting a record later tied in 2002, then tied again in 2018. Hurricane John lasted longer and spent more time tropical than any other tropical cyclone on Earth in recorded history. Eleven tropical cyclones entered or formed in the central Pacific, a record shared with the 1992 season until the 2015 season broke the record. Finally, of the four most intense hurricanes recorded in the Central Pacific, three of them occurred this season.\n\nThe season began with the formation of Tropical Depression One-E on June 18 and ended with the dissipation of Tropical Depression Nona on October 26. No named systems formed in May, three in June, four in July, five in August, six in September, two in October, and none in November. The total length of the season, from the formation of the first depression to the dissipation of the last, was 130 days.\n\nAccumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) is a measure of how active a hurricane season is. It is calculated by squaring the windspeed of a cyclone with at least tropical storm-force winds every six hours, summing the results, and dividing that total by 10. As a tropical cyclone does not have gale-force winds until it becomes a tropical storm, tropical depressions are not included in these tables. For all storms, ACE is given to three significant figures. The ACE in the east Pacific proper (140°W to North America) is given; the ACE in the central Pacific (the International Date Line to 140°W) is given in brackets. The table includes the ACE for Li and John only during those storm's time east of the dateline. Their ACE west of the dateline is part of the totals of the 1994 typhoon season. The National Hurricane Center uses ACE to rank hurricane seasons as above-normal, near-normal, and below-normal. It defines below-normal as having an ACE less than 95*10 kt kt; It defines above normal as having an ACE above 150*10 kt along with the numbers of any two of the following above average: tropical storms (15), hurricanes (9), or major hurricanes (4); It defines near-normal as having an ACE between 100*10 kt and 150*10 kt, or an ACE above 150*10 kt with fewer than two of the numbers of the following above average: tropical storms (15), hurricanes (9), or major hurricanes (4). Excluding the central Pacific, there were a total of seventeen tropical storms, nine hurricanes, and five major hurricanes. Altogether, the total ACE of this season was 185*10 kt. This qualifies this season as above-normal.\n\nTropical Depression One-E formed from an area of disturbed weather on June 18. It strengthened to Tropical Storm Aletta the next day. It continued intensifying and reached its peak intensity on June 20. Vertical wind shear began to weaken the storm thereafter. The weakening trend continued, weakening Aletta to a depression on June 21. The system dissipated June 23. Aletta's remnant low, however, could be tracked on satellite images for days following the storm. The low finally dissipated north of Hawaii. Aletta never affected land, and no damage or casualties were reported.\n\nTropical Depression Two-E formed on June 27 about south-southwest of the tip of the Baja California Peninsula. The depression headed west-northwest, gradually turned to the northwest, and strengthened into Tropical Storm Bud on June 27. Early the next day, Bud peaked in intensity. Shear caused by a nearby upper level low slowly weakened Bud. Later on June 28, a second center of circulation developed. The two centers started a Fujiwhara interaction. The second center then became dominant and the first one vanished. This confused structure is similar to what happened to 1993's Tropical Storm Arlene. This confused structure also weakened Bud to a tropical depression on the afternoon of the same day the second center formed. Bud then headed westward over cool waters and dissipated on June 29. Tropical Storm Bud spent its entire life over the open ocean far from land areas. No casualties or damage was reported.\n\nThe tropical depression that would be Carlotta formed on June 28. It quickly became Tropical Storm Carlotta, and a large eye became visible. Because of this, the NHC upgraded the storm to a hurricane. Carlotta peaked in intensity on July 1, as a hurricane. It gradually weakened as it moved into cooler waters, dissipating on July 5. Carlotta did not threaten land.\n\nCarlotta buffeted Socorro Island with sustained winds of on June 30. Other than there, Carlotta caused no damage or deaths.\n\nOn July 8, a disturbance located about southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula developed a circulation and became Tropical Depression Four-E. Convection increased, and the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Daniel. Upper-level outflow improved, and Daniel peaked in intensity on July 9. Daniel slowly declined as it continued westward. It entered the central Pacific on July 11. Wind shear weakened Daniel as it approached the Big Island, and by July 15 had degenerated into an open wave.\n\nWhen Daniel was approaching Hawaii, moderate surf of impacted the south and southeast shores of the Big Island on July 13 and 14. Daniel's remnants also passed about south of South Point, Hawaii, on July 15. That day, they caused rainfall on windward slopes of the Big Island locally reaching . No reports of damage or casualties were received.\nOn July 16, an area of low pressure associated with a tropical wave organized into Tropical Depression Five-E. It strengthened into Tropical Storm Emilia later that day. It moved west-northwest and strengthened into a hurricane. It entered the central Pacific on July 17. It continued intensifying, reaching Category 5 intensity on July 19, the first Category 5 Pacific hurricane since Ava. Emilia started weakening quickly on July 21. It weakened to a tropical storm on July 23 and dissipated two days later.\n\nEmilia passed south of the Hawaiian Islands, producing swells of in height near the Puna and Ka‘ū coasts. Winds caused minor damage, and rain was moderate. No one was killed.\n\nA tropical depression formed on July 19. Later that day, it strengthened into Tropical Storm Fabio. Fabio headed generally west or northwestward. It entered the central Pacific as a tropical depression, and dissipated on July 24.\n\nFabio's remnants brought locally heavy rainfall to Hawaii, reaching . No one was killed and there was no damage.\nPart of a tropical wave organized into a tropical depression on July 21. It headed westward and out to sea, strengthening into a tropical storm the next day. Gilma rapidly strengthened and became a hurricane exactly one day after it was named. It continued to intensify as it entered the central Pacific. Shortly after entering the central Pacific, Gilma reached Category 5 intensity on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, the second of the season. It then suddenly weakened for unexplained reasons, and weakened into a tropical storm on July 27. It became a depression three days after that and dissipated on July 31. Hurricane Gilma had minor impact on Johnston Atoll. That atoll received light rain, wind gusts to near gale force, and surf. No casualties or damage were reported.\n\nHurricane Gilma was the second most-intense Pacific hurricane at the time. As of 2019, it is tied with Hurricane Walaka as the tenth-most intense. Gilma is also the strongest July storm in the Eastern or Central Pacific.\n\nA tropical disturbance southwest of Cabo San Lucas organized into Tropical Depression Eight-E on July 31. It headed west-northwest without strengthening much, and crossed into the central Pacific on August 2. Eight-E developed a second center of circulation, which became dominant, and then became bound up in the intertropical convergence zone. Eight-E then became disorganized, with multiple centers of circulation, and advisories were discontinued on August 5. The depression's remains continued their westward path well south of the Hawaiian Islands. The depression regenerated on August 8. It soon strengthened into a tropical storm and was named Li, which is Hawaiian for \"Lee\". Li approached the dateline on its generally westward heading. Just before crossing, it intensified into a minimal Category 1 hurricane. It crossed the dateline on August 12 and became a storm in the 1994 Pacific typhoon season. Wind shear from a tropical upper-tropospheric trough weakened back into a tropical storm as it crossed the dateline, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center downgraded Li with its first advisory. Li stayed a tropical storm until August 16, where it weakened into a tropical depression. The system then began recurving, and dissipated on August 18. A weakening Tropical Depression Li caused showers on Wake Island. Other than there, Li had no impact on any land, and no casualties or damage were reported.\n\nHurricane Li is one of only six tropical cyclones to exist on all three tropical cyclone basins in the Pacific Ocean. It is also one of only six systems to form as a depression in the east Pacific but be named in the central; the others are Lala, Iniki, Lana, Ela and Ulika.\n\nOn August 7, a tropical depression formed from a tropical wave a few hundred miles south of Baja California. It became Tropical Storm Hector quickly, and as it paralleled the coast of Mexico, it began to weaken, dissipating on August 10. No damage was reported anywhere.\n\nTropical Storm Hector was forecast to approach the Baja California Peninsula. A tropical storm watch was issued for part of the peninsula on August 8. It was lifted later the same day. Hector's most significant impact was rain. The tropical storm dumped rain along a discontinuous zone of coastal and inland Mexico. The highest point maxima were at Cerro de Ortega/Ixtlahua and at Caduano/Santiago. No damage or casualties were reported.\n\nAn area of disturbed weather organized into a tropical depression on August 9 while located southeast of Hilo, Hawaii. The depression moved westward without organizing, and dissipated on August 14.\n\nMoisture from the system produced heavy rainfall over the island of Hawaii, totaling to over . The flooding closed all major roads in Hilo, and was considered the worst flooding in 40 years. The rainfall destroyed two homes and damaged 214, 14 severely. It also damaged roads and businesses. Damage throughout the island totaled to $5 million (1994 USD; $  USD). Flooding occurred in Maui as well, where landslides blocked portions of the Hana Highway. One-C's point maximum of makes it Hawaii's ninth wettest known tropical cyclone.\n\nA disturbance that was part of the intertropical convergence zone developed several centers of circulation. After it organized, it separated from the ITCZ and became Tropical Depression Eleven-E on August 10 while the system was about south-southeast of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula. It was upgraded to Tropical Storm Ileana at the second advisory, at the same time as John, the next storm. An eye appeared, and Ileana became a hurricane on August 12. It began weakening almost immediately thereafter, as it passed over cooler waters and encountered increasing wind shear. Ileana was a tropical storm on August 13, and the next day it was a dissipating swirl low-level clouds located about west of Punta Eugenia. Although Ileana paralleled the coast of Mexico, watches and warnings were not issued because winds of tropical storm-force were not expected to affect land. No one was killed and there was no damage reported in association with this cyclone.\nTropical Depression Ten-E formed on August 11 south of Mexico. It headed generally westward, and was upgraded into a tropical storm twelve hours after it formed and was named John. John fluctuated in strength as it headed west, always managing to stay at tropical storm strength. On August 20, steady intensification began, and John was a major hurricane when it entered the central Pacific. It continued westward, reaching Category 5 intensity on August 23. It passed around south of Hawaii, and passed just north of Johnston Atoll on August 26. John stayed at hurricane intensity until it crossed the dateline on August 28, becoming a typhoon of the 1994 Pacific typhoon season. After weakening into a tropical storm, John recurved, looped, and recurved again. It reintensified, and was a hurricane when it recrossed the dateline to reenter the central Pacific. John headed north-northeast until it went extratropical on September 10, thirty one days after it formed.\n\nAhead of the hurricane, the 1100 people at Johnston Atoll evacuated. On the atoll, John caused $15 million (1994 USD; $  USD) in damage. No deaths were reported. Other than on Johnston, Hurricane John had minor effects in Hawaii. Its remnants also affected Alaska.\n\nHurricane John was the longest lasting and farthest traveling tropical cyclone on Earth in recorded history. It is also one of six tropical cyclones to exist in all three basins of the Pacific Ocean, an uncommon west-to-east dateline crosser, and one of the few tropical cyclone to cross the dateline more than once.\n\nOn August 28, Tropical Depression Thirteen-E formed about southwest of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. It was named Tropical Storm Kristy on August 30. As it crossed into the central Pacific, a banding-type eye formed and it became a hurricane. Twelve hours later, it reached Category 2 intensity. Kristy weakened steadily from that point due to wind shear. It passed about south of Hawaii, and dissipated on September 5. The lowest central pressure of Kristy is unknown. The last estimate was made when Kirsty was still a tropical storm.\n\nAs it approached the Hawaiian Islands, a high surf advisory and a high wind warning were issued for the Big Island of Hawaii. No damage or deaths were reported in association with this system. Its remnants crossed 180th meridian very early on September 7 and was absorbed by a tropical depression which became Typhoon Melissa in the Western Pacific basin.\n\nThe same tropical wave that spawned Tropical Depression Five in the Atlantic became Tropical Depression Fourteen-E on September 3. It quickly became Tropical Storm Lane. A high pressure ridge centered itself north of Lane, keeping the storm on a westward track. This brought Lane into very favorable conditions, and Lane intensified. When the tropical storm reached hurricane strength, it entered a phase of rapid intensification, reaching winds of about , making it a category four hurricane. The high pressure ridge shifted eastward, and allowed Lane to enter unfavorable conditions. Lane dissipated on September 10.\n\nA tropical disturbance became Tropical Depression Two-C on September 6. It reached tropical storm strength the next day, being named Mele. The name Mele means \"song\" in the Hawaiian language and is also the Hawaiian form of \"Mary\". Mele headed west-northwest and weakened back into a tropical depression on September 9. It dissipated later that day without incident.\n\nMiriam formed from a weak disturbance on September 15. It strengthened slightly into Tropical Storm Miriam, and dissipated on September 21, having led an uneventful life without impact. In an interesting occurrence, the low-level remnants of Miriam were still visible for weeks after the storm dissipated near 140°W.\n\nA tropical depression formed on September 19, and became Tropical Storm Norman the next day. After tracking northwest, it began to turn north in response to a trough, and convection began to diminish. Norman dissipated on September 22 without having ever affected land.\n\nHurricane Olivia ultimately formed from a disturbance that had separated from the intertropical convergence zone and become distinct by September 19. The disturbance slowly headed westward and it organized into a tropical depression on September 22 while located about south of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula. The depression headed west-northwestwards and strengthened into Tropical Storm Olivia on September 22. It steadily intensified and was a hurricane on September 24. It then rapidly strengthened into a powerful major hurricane. It slowly curled to the northwest as it was observed by NOAA research aircraft. Olivia peaked in intensity on September 25. Meanwhile, a large cyclone off the extreme southern part of California induced a northward path. As Olivia started a small anticyclonic loop, wind shear began to weaken the hurricane. When Olivia was finished the loop, it had weakened to a tropical storm. It then headed westward. It weakened into a tropical depression on September 28 and dissipated the next day. No impact was reported.\n\nAt the time, Olivia was the third-most intense Pacific hurricane on record; it has since dropped to eleventh. The storm also had the lowest barometric pressure of a Category 4 Pacific hurricane on record. In 2001, Hurricane Juliette joined Olivia as the most intense Category 4 hurricane on record. In 2014, Hurricane Odile beat both storms when it attained a minimum pressure of 918 mbars. At the time, Olivia was also the most intense September hurricane, but was surpassed by Hurricane Linda in 1997, and is currently the third most intense September hurricane in the Pacific basin.\n\nA nearly stationary cluster of thunderstorms and convection that had been hanging around since September 15 and escaped destruction by Tropical Storm Miriam organized into Tropical Depression Eighteen-E on September 24. It was located between Miriam's remnants and the developing Olivia. It became Tropical Storm Paul on the afternoon of September 25. It peaked in intensity on September 27. Then, upper outflow from the nearby Olivia started shearing the tropical cyclone. Paul had been completely destroyed by September 30. The tropical cyclone never threatened land, and consequently, no damage or deaths were reported.\nAn area of disturbed weather organized into a tropical depression at midday on October 8. It had trouble organizing, and advisories were discontinued for a while. The cyclone finally became a tropical storm on October 11 and was named Rosa. It moved glacially, but eventually a trough steered Rosa north and then northeast. Rosa intensified quickly, peaking at Category 2 intensity just before landfall near La Concepción on the morning of October 14. Rosa quickly decayed over the mountains of Mexico, and its cloud shield rapidly accelerated northward through the United States, spreading moisture.\n\nOn October 12, a hurricane watch was issued for the coast from Culiacán to Manzanillo and the Baja California Peninsula south of latitude 24°N. At the same time, a tropical storm warning was issued from Manzanillo to Tepic. On October 14, a hurricane warning was issued for the coast between Culiacán and Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco, and a tropical storm warning south of Cabo Corrientes to Manzanillo. All watches and warnings were lifted later that day.\n\nFour deaths, two in each of Nayarit and Durango, were reported. Four people were missing in Sinaloa. All of the deaths were due to drowning. More than 100,000 people had their homes damaged in Nayarit. Telephone poles and power lines were downed in Sinaloa. Rain caused landslides and flash-flooding in mountainous areas. In Jalisco, mudslides forced the evacuation of 400 people from two coastal villages. The highest rainfall total in Mexico was at Mesa de Pedro Pablo. The moisture Rosa sent into the United States was a contributing factor in record rains in parts of southeastern Texas from October 15 to 19. Those rains caused flooding that killed 22 people, destroyed over 3000 homes, and caused US$700 million in damage.\n\nTropical Depression Three-C formed on October 21 in the Central Pacific basin. It traveled westward for about 4 days before strengthening to Tropical Storm Nona on October 25. The name \"Nona\" is Hawaiian for the Latin name spelled the . Nona immediately weakened back into a tropical depression. Upper-level westerlies from a nearby trough destroyed the depression on October 26. No deaths or damage were reported. Nona was a tropical storm for six hours, the minimum possible time.\nOn August 14, an area of convection organized enough to be considered a tropical depression. It was steered by John's circulation, and it was never expected to strengthen much because it was close to cool waters. The cyclone drifted north, then northeast, north again, northwest, and then west. The National Hurricane Center declared the depression dissipated on August 15. The depression had no effects anywhere.\n\nAccording to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center and Japan Meteorological Agency, on October 21, a tropical depression formed west of the International Dateline, and soon exited CPHC's area of responsibility. the system subsequently became Tropical Storm Yuri. \n\nThe following names were used for named storms that formed in the Northeastern Pacific Ocean during 1994. Names that were not assigned this season are marked in gray. No names were retired, so this same list was used again in the 2000 season. This is the same list used for the 1988 season except for \"Ileana\", which replaced \"Iva\" and was used for the first time in 1994.\nFor storms that form in the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility, encompassing the area between 140 degrees west and the International Date Line, all names are used in a series of four rotating lists. The next four names that were slated for use in 1994 are shown below. Three of them, \"Li\", \"Mele\", and \"Nona\", were used throughout the course of the year.\nThis is a table of all the storms that have formed in the 1994 Pacific hurricane season. It includes their duration, names, landfall(s), denoted in parentheses, damages, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all the damage figures are in 1994 USD.\n\n\n"}

Charlton Heston played a supporting role as Andrew Jackson, the second time that Heston played Jackson, having portrayed him earlier in the 1953 film \"The President's Lady\". The film was shot in Technicolor and VistaVision, the story takes place during the War of 1812, telling a heavily fictionalized version of how the privateer Lafitte helped in the Battle of New Orleans and how he had to choose between fighting for America or for the side most likely to win, the United Kingdom.\n\nThe movie's supporting cast featured Inger Stevens, Henry Hull, E. G. Marshall, Lorne Greene, Ted de Corsia, Ed Hinton, Douglass Dumbrille and Majel Barrett. Ty Hardin was uncredited) Anthony Quinn directed the film.\n\nPossibly as a film tie-in, Johnny Horton had a big success at the time with his version of the song \"The Battle of New Orleans\".\n\n\"The Buccaneer\"s budget was $6 million. $1.2 million was given for the promotion of the picture. Quinn was given five stars, fifty-five featured actors, 100 bit actors, 12,000 extras, 60,000 props, $100,000 worth of antique furniture, Spanish moss, and cypress trees.\n\nClaiborne's only surviving daughter, Sophronie (or Sophronia) Louise Claiborne, was only two years old at the time of the battle. The romance with Lafitte is complete fiction.\n\nThe film is a remake of the 1938 film of the same name which starred Fredric March and Akim Tamiroff (Boyer played Tamiroff's role in the remake). The 1938 version was produced and directed by Cecil B. DeMille, but he was seriously ill by the time the 1958 version was made, so he was only the executive producer of that version, leaving his then son-in-law, Anthony Quinn, to direct. It was the only film that Quinn ever directed. Henry Wilcoxon, DeMille's longtime friend, who made frequent appearances in his films, was the actual producer, and DeMille did received screen credit as \"supervised by Cecil B. Demille\", though students of his films would probably find that his touch is obvious throughout the film.\n\nStaff writers for \"Variety\" wrote in their review: \"Continuity-wise, \"Buccaneer\" is a scrambled affair in the early reels. Open to question, also, are the story angles in the screenplay which derives from a previous \"Buccaneer\" scenario put out by DeMille in 1938 and, in turn, from an adaptation of the original book, \"Lafitte the Pirate\", by Lyle Saxon.\" In his book, \"Success in the Cinema Money Making Movies\", John Howard Reid, states most reviews of the film left out the director's name, Quinn, like \"Time\" and \"Newsweek\". The \"Time\" review states: \"What (Henry) Wilcoxon and Quinn have produced is just a half-deflated imitation of the old man at his overblown best.\" The \"Newsweek\" review stated without criticizing anyone: \"two hours of the most pretentious nonsense to lay claim to a moviegoer's spending money.\"\n\n\"The Buccaneer\" was released in New York City theatres during Christmas week of 1958. The film was released on DVD ON February 28, 2012, by Olive Films.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2187674", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2187674", "title": "Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah", "text": "Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah\n\nGrand Ayatollah Mohammad Hussain Fadlallah (also Sayyed Muhammad Hussein Fadl-Allāh; ; 16 November 1935 – 4 July 2010) was a prominent twelver Shia cleric from a Lebanese family. Born in Najaf, Iraq, Fadlallah studied Islam in Najaf before moving to Lebanon in 1952. In the following decades, he gave many lectures, engaged in intense scholarship, wrote dozens of books, founded several Islamic religious schools, and established the \"Mabarrat Association\". Through the aforementioned association, he established a public library, a women's cultural center, and a medical clinic.\n\nFadlallah was sometimes called the \"spiritual mentor\" of Hezbollah in the media, although this was disputed by other sources. He was also the target of several assassination attempts, including the 1985 Beirut car bombing.\n\nHis death was followed by a huge turnout in Lebanon, visits by virtually all major political figures across the Lebanese spectrum, and statements of condolence from across the greater Middle East region; but it also led to controversy in the west and a denunciation in Israel.\n\nFadlallah was born in the Iraqi Shia shrine city of Najaf on 16 November 1935. His parents, Abdulraouf Fadlullah and al-Hajja Raoufa Hassan Bazzi, had migrated there from the village of 'Aynata in south Lebanon in 1928 to learn theology. By the time of his birth, his father was already a Muslim scholar.\n\nFadlallah went first to a traditional school (Kuttāb) to learn the Quran and the basic skills of reading and writing. He soon left and went to a more \"modern\" school that was established by the publisher Jamiat Muntada Al-Nasher where he remained for two years and studied in the third and fourth elementary classes.\n\nAt these schools he began studying the religious sciences at a very young age. He started to read the Ajroumiah when he was nine years old, and then he read Qatr al-Nada wa Bal Al-Sada (Ibn Hisham).\n\nHe completed Sutouh in which the student reads the book and listens to his teacher's explanation. He also studied the Arabic language, logic and Jurisprudence, and did not need another teacher until he studied the second part of the course known as Kifayat at Usul which he studied with an Iranian teacher named Sheikh mujtaba Al-Linkarani. He attended the so-called Bahth Al-Kharij in which the teacher does not restrict himself to a certain book but gives more or less free lectures. Fadlallah published a minor periodical before going to Lebanon. At the age of ten, he put out a handwritten literary journal with some of his friends.\n\nAfter 21 years of studying under the prominent teachers of the Najaf religious university he concluded his studies in 1966 and returned to Lebanon. He had already visited Lebanon in 1952 where he recited a poem eulogizing Muhsin al Amin at his funeral.\n\nIn 1966 Fadlallah received an invitation from a group who had established a society called \"Usrat Ataakhi\" (The family of Fraternity) that became the Islamic Dawa Party in Lebanon to come and live with them in the area of Naba'a in Eastern Beirut. He agreed, especially as the conditions at Najaf impelled him to leave.\n\nIn Naba'a Fadlallah began his work, by organising cultural seminars and delivering religious speeches that discussed social issues as well.\n\nNevertheless, Fadlallah's main concern was to continue to develop his academic work. Thus he founded a religious school called the Islamic Sharia Institute in which several students enrolled who later became prominent religious scholars including Sheikh Ragib Harb. He also established a public library, a women's cultural centre and a medical clinic.\n\nWhen the Lebanese Civil War forced him to leave the area, he moved to the Southern Suburbs where he started to give priority to teaching and educating the people. He used the mosque as his centre for holding daily prayers giving lessons in Qur'anic interpretation, as well as religious and moral speeches, especially on religious occasions such as Ashura. He soon resumed his academic work and began to give daily lessons in Islamic principles, jurisprudence and morals. In 1982 Dawa unites with other Islamic Shia armed organizations (Islamic Amal, Islamic Jihad Organization, Jundallah and Imam Hussein suicide squad) to found Hezbollah.\n\nAs one of the alleged leaders of Hezbollah, a status both he and the group denied he was the target of several assassination attempts, including the allegedly CIA-sponsored and funded 8 March 1985 Beirut car bombing that killed 80 people.\n\nOn 8 March 1985, a car bomb equivalent to of dynamite exploded 9–45 metres from his house in Beirut, Lebanon. The blast destroyed a 7-story apartment building and a cinema, killed 80 people and wounded 256. The attack was timed to go off as worshippers were leaving Friday Prayers. Most of the dead were girls and women who had been leaving the mosque, though the ferocity of the blast \"burned babies in their beds,\" \"killed a bride buying her trousseau,\" and \"blew away three children as they walked home from the mosque.\" It also \"devastated the main street of the densely populated\" West Beirut suburb. but Fadlallah escaped injury. One of his bodyguards at the time was Imad Mughniyeh, who was later assassinated in a car-bombing in February 2008.\n\nAccording to Bob Woodward, CIA director William Casey was involved in the attack, which he suggests was carried out with funding from Saudi Arabia. \"In his book Woodward portrays Casey as a wily and aggressive director who made the CIA his personal instrument of foreign policy. In early 1985 Woodward reports, Casey went \"off the books\" to enlist Saudi help in carrying out three covert operations. One was the attempted assassination of Sheik Fadlallah, who had been linked to the bombings in Beirut. After that plot failed, Woodward writes, the Saudis offered Fadlallah a $2 million bribe to cease his terrorist attacks. He accepted, and the attacks stopped. Woodward's account of the incident was denied last week by the Saudi press agency and by Fadlallah's office.\" Former Lebanese warlord and statesman late Elie Hobeika was accused as one of those likely responsible for the actual operation.\n\nDuring the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war, Israeli warplanes bombed his two-story house in Beirut's southern Haret Hreik neighborhood. Fadlallah was not at home at the time of the bombing, which reduced the house to rubble.\n\nHe has been variously attributed by the media as being the spiritual leader of Hezbollah. \"Al Manar\" said he had at least \"inspired the leaders\" of the group. It added that \"From the pulpit of the Imam Rida mosque in the Bir al-Abd neighborhood, Sayyed Fadlullah's sermons gave shape to the political currents among mainly the Muslim Shiite sect [of Lebanon], from the latter half of the 1980s till the last days of his life.\" Other sources, such as journalist Robert Fisk, also refuted such claims that he was affiliated with the group.\n\nHe supported the Iranian Islamic Revolution. In his sermons, he called for armed resistance to the Israeli occupations of Lebanon, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip, along with opposition to the existence of Israel.\n\nHe held relatively liberal views on the status of women. When he died in 2010, TIME magazine wrote about his contrarian stance:\n\n\"Fadlallah had broken with Hizballah and the toxic legacy of his early edicts. He criticized Iran's clerical rule, supported women's rights and insisted on dialogue with the West.\"\n\nHe has asked for a boycott of American products.\n\nThis boycott should become an overwhelming trend that makes these two states feel that their economies are in a real and actual danger.))\n\nIn November 2007, Fadlallah accused the United States of trying to sabotage the election in Lebanon: \"The insanity of the U.S. president and its administration is reflected in Lebanon by their ambassador pressuring the Lebanese people and preventing them from reaching an agreement over the presidential election.\"\n\nThough he welcomed the election of Barack Obama as the American president, the following year he expressed disappointment with Obama's lack of progress in the Middle East peace process saying he appeared to have no plan to bring peace to the region.\n\nDespite his criticism of U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East, he condemned the September 11 attacks in the United States as acts of terrorism.\n\nFadlallah made statements in favour of suicide bombings against Israeli citizens. In a 2002 interview with \"The Daily Telegraph,\" he said: \n\nHis support for suicide bombings against Israel were based on the grounds that the latter uses advanced weaponry; it was also claimed that he wished that the state of Israel would cease to exist. \nFollowing the Mercaz HaRav massacre, Fadlallah called the attack \"heroic.\" Western sources also cite his favour for suicide bombings against Israeli citizens. Fadlallah explained the religious basis for suicide attacks in an interview with \"Daily Star\".\n\nIn September 2009, Fadlallah issued a \"fatwa\" banning normalisation of ties with Israel. He also objected to any territorial settlement, saying \"the entire land of Palestine within its historical borders is one Arab-Islamic country and no one has right to spare on[e] inch of it.\" Another English translation (from the Arabic in \"Al Akhbar\") was given in \"The Daily Middle East Reporter\".\n\nDespite his ties with the Islamic Republic of Iran, Fadlallah distanced himself from the Ayatollah Khomeini's legacy of by Islamic clerics was said to argue that \"no Shia religious leader, not even Khomeini… has a monopoly on the truth.\" He also first endorsed Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani rather than Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as the marja for Shia in matters of religion, before claiming the role for himself. In a 2009 interview, Fadlallah said that he did not believe wilayat al-faqih has a role in modern Lebanon.\n\nFadlallah was known for his relatively liberal views on women, whom he sees as equal to men. He believed that women have just as much of a responsibility towards society as men do, and women should be role models for both men and women. But almost all of the mainstream faqihs say the same thing as does the Quran so he wasn't giving anything new on the role of women in society and family. Fadlallah also believed that women have the same exact ability as men to fight their inner weaknesses. He saw the hijab as something that makes a man see a woman not as a sex object, but instead as a human being. He believes, like all of his peers in the Islamic seminary that women should cover their entire body except for their face and hands, and that they should avoid wearing excessive makeup when they go out in public.\n\nFadlallah also issued a \"fatwa\" on the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women that supports the right of a woman to defend herself against any act of violence whether \"social\" or \"physical\". The fatwa reaffirms the rights of women, both at their workplace and at home, and states that Islam forbids men from exercising any form of violence against women and forbids men from depriving women of their legal rights. In his words \"physical violence in which women are beaten, proves that these men are weak, for only the weak are in need of unjust violence\". He also issued \"fatwa\"s forbidding female circumcision and honour killings. Yet, almost all of the leading Fiqih leaders believe in the same treatment and honor of women within Islam. \n\nHe was opposed to abortion in most cases; however, when the women is in an abnormal amount of danger by the pregnancy, he believed it was permissible.\n\nHe was one of the Ulama signatories of the Amman Message, which gives a broad foundation for defining Muslim orthodoxy.\n\nFadlallah held controversial views regarding Islamic doctrine, as espoused in some of his works and speeches. He also issued many fatwas and opinions that courted controversy, for which he was condemned and not supported by other eminent Islamic scholars, including a representative of Grand Ayatollah al-Sistani, the office of Grand Ayatollah Mirza Jawad Tabrizi, in the holy city of Qom, released a statement that “any help to or cooperation with him in publishing his writings is not legal with respect to Islam”. He was also condemned by Grand Ayatollahs Bashir al-Najafi, Hossein Waheed Khorasani, Mohammad al-Husayni al-Shirazi, Sadiq Hussaini Shirazi and others.\n\n\nFadlallah was quoted as saying, \"We have to improve our education and gain more scientific knowledge. If we do not make the best of our time now, we will not be able to build our future or develop in the future.\" In addition to the academic work that Fadlallah did, he also opened up schools, Islamic centres, and orphanages:\n\n\n\n\nFadlallah was hospitalized several times in the months before his death, suffering from internal bleeding. His frailty prevented him from delivering Friday sermons in the weeks preceding his death. Fadlallah's media office announced his death at Al-Hassanein Mosque in the southern Beirut suburb of Haret Hureik on 4 July 2010. He was 74. His office said the funeral was scheduled for 6 July at 13:30 p.m. leaving from his house, his burial to be in Al-Hasanein Mosque. His family received condolences at the mosque.\n\nThe day was also declared by Lebanon as a day of national mourning. The cabinet's General Secretariat said all public institutions and administrations, headquarters of municipalities, private and public schools and universities would be closed. The Lebanese flag would be lowered to half-mast in public institutions and administration and the headquarters of municipalities. Radio and television programmes would also be \"adjusted in line with the painful occasion.\"\n\nAt his funeral, his supporters carried his body around Shia neighbourhoods in southern Beirut, then marched to the spot of his 1985 assassination attempt before returning to Imam Rida Mosque, where he was laid to rest. Thousands of mourners gathered at the mosque for prayer services before the funeral procession. Delegations included representatives from Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Syria and Iran. Thousands of his followers also gathered outside his mosque in Haret Hreik. \"Al-Manar\" broadcast the funeral. They said thousands of his followers took part in his funeral and told \"his eminence for the last time their 'own secrets' and vowing to stay committed to his path. They told him that even if he has died, he will remain the ideal and the model for them, that even if he has died, his eminence will remain a great man in the eyes of all those who had the chance to know him, and his views will continue to circulate from one generation to another\". Al-Manar said his followers \"launched a school of beliefs and thoughts, a school that would always be committed to the main causes of Islam, from Jihad to Resistance, and face all foreign threats against the region.\" It claimed that Fadlallah \"committed to the central cause, Palestine, calling to fight occupation through all possible means. His eminence issued different 'fatwa's calling to fight Israel and boycott American goods and ban normalizing of relations, and was a 'true supporter' of Islamic unity all over his life. In his last moments before his death, Sayyed Fadlullah was still preoccupied with the cause. He was asking about the dawn prayers and telling his nurse that he wouldn't rest before Israel's vanishing.\"\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2187693", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2187693", "title": "Arkansaurus", "text": "Arkansaurus\n\nArkansaurus (meaning \"Arkansas lizard\") is an extinct genus of ornithomimosaurian theropod dinosaur. It lived during the Albian and Aptian stages of the Early Cretaceous. The type and only species is Arkansaurus fridayi.\n\nIn August 1972, Joe B. Friday, who owned a service station in Locksburg, Arkansas, noticed some vultures circling above his land. Checking his cows, he noticed that fossil bones were visible in a ditch near the road where some gravel had been removed recently for the reconstruction of Arkansas Highway 24. He removed them and for some months displayed the fossils in his station. At the time, nobody recognised them for dinosaur bones. A geology professor at the University of Arkansas and former resident of the nearby town of Nashville, Doy Zachry Jr., took the bones to his colleague at the University of Arkansas, paleontologist Dr. James H. Quinn, to view. Quinn recognized the fossilized remains as dinosaurian and prepared the bones. He took the remains to the annual meeting of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology in Lincoln, Nebraska in the fall of 1972. Once there, the bones were examined by experts from both the US and Europe. They were thought to be related to \"Ornithomimus\". Quinn first presented on the fossils in 1973 at the Geological Society of America Meeting in Little Rock, Arkansas.\n\nIn March 1973, Dr. Quinn and Benjamin Clardy of the Arkansas Geological Commission went to the area on the Friday farm where the remains had been discovered, hoping to find more remains. The site was a pit that had been dug for road construction and the fossils had been taken from the Early Cretaceous Trinity Group. Unfortunately, all the scientists were able to find was a toe bone. They speculated that the bones had either been scattered when they were buried or during the road construction. In all there were three metatarsals, four phalanges, and three claws found of \"Arkansaurus\".\n\nFour casts of the bones were made. These casts were given to the Friday Family, the University of Arkansas, the Arkansas Geological Commission, and the Arkansas Museum of Science and Natural History. The University cast is hanging in a classroom in Ozark Hall. The Museum of Science and Natural History actually had a large statue of the dinosaur constructed to go along with their cast, and it was on display for many years when the museum was located at the Tower Building. The original bones, donated to the university by Friday, currently reside at the University of Arkansas Museum Collections, now housed at the Arkansas Archaeological Survey in Fayetteville, Arkansas.\n\nQuinn intended to name the species \"Arkansaurus fridayi\" but in 1977 made a fatal fall when prospecting for fossils in Nebraska. The name \"Arkansaurus\" first appeared in print in a popular-science book by Helen Roney Sattler in 1983, remaining an invalid \"nomen nudum\". The full species name was first published by Angela K. Braden in 1998, mentioning that Quinn had informally used the combination \"Arkansaurus fridayi\".\n\nIn January 2017 Rep. Greg Leding, D-Fayetteville, submitted a bill to the Arkansas Legislature to designate Arkansaurus the State Dinosaur, along with several cosigners. The original idea of the bill came from high school student Mason Cypress Oury, who, accompanied by Rep. Leding, presented a modified version of the bill to a House panel, and answered questions. Among his reasoning for adopting the Arkansaurus as the state dinosaur Oury pointed out that Oklahoma, Texas and Missouri all have listed state dinosaurs, and Arkansas already has 24 designated state symbols, and since it was the 25th state to be admitted to the union, it made sense to add one more. The bill was approved by the governor February 17, 2017.\n\n\"Arkansaurus\" was declared the official Arkansas state dinosaur in 2017. The dinosaur was discovered in Lockesburg, Arkansas, and was a bipedal ornithomimosaur dinosaur. A near relative is the ornithomimosaur \"Nedcolbertia\". It is named for the state of Arkansas and its discoverer Joe B. Friday, who found the dinosaur's fossilized foot on his land in 1972. It is the only dinosaur fossil currently described from Arkansas. The fossil was officially described in 2018 by paleontologists ReBecca Hunt-Foster and James Harrison Quinn in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology.\n\nThe official description of this dinosaur was published on March 19, 2018 in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology by paleontologists ReBecca Hunt-Foster and, posthumously, James H. Quinn. The study determined that the fossils contain a combination of unique anatomical details, such as differentiated pedal unguals, a laterally compressed third metatarsal that is ovoid in proximal view, and a distal ungual with a very weak flexor tubercle, lacking spurs. The condition of this third metatarsal suggests that \"Arkansaurus fridayi\" is more basal than Asiatic ornithomimosaurs of similar age, but consistent with older North American forms, such as \"Nedcolbertia\".\n\n\"Arkansaurus\" was probably a fast moving omnivore between tall. Its long arms would likely have ended in three fingered grasping hands.\n\nA single autapomorphy, unique derived trait, was indicated: the strong curvature of the foot claws. These are normally rather flat with ornithomimosaurians.\n\n\"Arkansaurus\" was placed in the Ornithomimosauria in a basal position, outside of the Ornithomimidae.\nOrnithomimisaur tracks of similar age are known from north of Moab, Utah, at the Mill Canyon Dinosaur Tracksite, in the Ruby Ranch Member of the Cedar Mountain Formation (Early Cretaceous). This tracksite also preserves the tracks of ankylosaur, hadrosaur, sauropod and several size classes of theropod dinosaurs, along with crocodiles and birds. A similar fauna has been noted from the Trinity Group in Arkansas.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2187699", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2187699", "title": "1993 Pacific hurricane season", "text": "1993 Pacific hurricane season\n\nThe 1993 Pacific hurricane season was a slightly above-average Pacific hurricane season with seven named storms directly impacting land. The season officially started on May 15 in the eastern Pacific, and on June 1 in the central Pacific, and ended on November 30; these dates conventionally delimit the period during which most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. The first tropical cyclone developed on June 11, over a month after the traditional start of the season. The final named storm of the season, Tropical Storm Norma, dissipated on October 14. The Central Pacific Ocean saw very little tropical activity, with only one cyclone, Hurricane Keoni, developing in that particular region. However, many storms out of the season crossed the threshold into the Central Pacific, many as hurricanes, and even major hurricanes.\n\nThe season produced fifteen named storms, which was slightly below the average of sixteen named storms per season. However, the total of eleven hurricanes during the season was slightly above average, and the total of nine major hurricanes was significantly higher than the average of three. The deadliest storm was Hurricane Calvin, which killed 37 people in Mexico. \n\nThe Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) index for the 1993 Pacific hurricane season in total is 201.8 units. Broadly speaking, ACE is a measure of the power of a tropical or subtropical storm multiplied by the length of time it existed. It is only calculated for full advisories on specific tropical and subtropical systems reaching or exceeding wind speeds of 39 mph (63 km/h).\n\nThe most intense cyclone of the season was Hurricane Lidia, a powerful Category 4 hurricane that made landfall in Sinaloa as a Category 2. Killing seven people, Lidia also caused extensive property damage in Mexico and the United States, as the remnants of the system combined with a cold front to produce Severe weather in Texas. However, the most notable storm of the season, in terms of fatalities, was Hurricane Calvin. Originating from an area of disturbed weather on July 4, it reached a peak intensity of before making an initial landfall near Manzanillo, Colima, Mexico. Rapidly weakening due to land interaction with the Mexican coastline, the hurricane re-emerged into Pacific waters, though the storm did not strengthen, and continued to weaken as it moved northwestward. On July 8, Calvin made a second, and final, landfall on the southern tip of Baja California Peninsula before weakening to a tropical depression and dissipating on July 9. At least 34 deaths can be attributed to the system, as well as $32 million (1993 USD) or more in damage.\n\nOn June 11, an area of shower and thunderstorm activity situated approximately intensified into a tropical depression. Embedded within a weak steering flow, the depression initially drifted towards the west, and began to organize above high Sea surface temperatures and low wind shear. Eighteen hours after formation, the depression strengthened into a tropical storm, earning the name \"Adrian\", and becoming the first tropical storm of the season. Turning towards the northwest, Adrian gradually strengthened to attain hurricane status by 1200 UTC on June 15, and the storm reached a peak intensity of 85 mph (140 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of early the next day. However, the system turned clockwise towards the southeast, wind shear began to take toll on the cyclone, and Adrian weakened to a tropical storm early on June 17. Becoming nearly stationary, Adrian further weakened to a tropical depression late the same day, and dissipated at 1800 UTC on June 19, without any effects to land.\nOn June 14, satellite imagery revealed an increase in thunderstorm activity to the south of the Gulf of Tehuanpec. Moving little, a broad surface low developed with the cloud mass, and a tropical wave moved through the area. Although the disturbance remained disorganized, a second tropical wave moved into the region on June 18, when the cloudiness there became better concentrated. According to a post-storm analysis of satellite data and synoptic reports, it is noted that a tropical depression formed at 0600 UTC on June 18, while located approximately south-southeast of Huatulco, Mexico. Quickly strengthening, the depression intensified a tropical storm six hours later based on a ship report, earning the name \"Beatriz\". Moving generally towards the northwest, partially due to Tropical Storm Arlene's large circulation in the Gulf of Mexico, Beatriz reached a peak intensity of by 1800 UTC on June 19. Shortly thereafter, the system made landfall near Puerto Escondido, Oaxaca and rapidly weakened to a tropical depression over the mountainous terrain of Mexico. Beatriz dissipated at 0600 UTC on June 20, although the remnant cloudiness and associated convection from the storm spread across portions of the western Gulf of Mexico that same day. Beatriz caused extensive damage in southwest Mexico, especially from heavy rains and flooding, with highest rainfall totals of between five and ten inches occurring in Oaxaca, with even higher totals of 11.97 in (304 mm) and 15.46 in (393 mm) from Las Pilas and Salina Cruz. Six deaths were reported in the Mexican states of Morelos and Veracruz from flooding and downed trees attributed to Beatriz.\n\nOn June 12, a tropical wave moved off the western coast of Africa, and crossed the Atlantic Ocean with little to any development. Moving into the Pacific Ocean, it is estimated that a tropical depression formed at 00 UTC on June 27. Initially moving towards the northwest, the depression, referred to as \"Three-E\", became slightly better organized as it neared the Mexican coastline. Twenty-four hours later, the depression was approximately off the coast of Mexico, near Puerto Escondidio. Shortly thereafter, the depression began to weaken, likely due to land interaction. Turning towards the west-northwest, the depression accelerated in its forward motion, while remaining in a disorganized state. Shortly thereafter, the Three-E turned back towards the northwest, and began to organize once again. Satellite imagery on June 30 revealed that the depression was close to tropical storm strength, although the system still lacked the organized to be declared as such. For the next several days, Three-E transitioned in movement between north and northwest, and by July 1, the depression approached Baja California. However, likely due to cooler sea surface temperatures and higher wind shear, most of the convection associated with the system had dissipated before it reached the southern portion of Baja California. At 00 UTC July 2, the depression dissipated a short distance north of La Paz.\n\nShortly before the formation of Tropical Depression Three-E, it is reported that locally heavy rains fell over portions of the states of Chiapas, Oaxaca, and Tabasco, where 24-hour rainfall totals of , and were reported, respectively. In Atoyac and Acapulco, 24-hour rainfall totals of and were reported. Additionally, between June 26 and June 29, Acapulco reported a 4-day rainfall total of . Lastly, according to an Associated Press wire story, 300 families were evacuated in Mexico, although a specific location is unknown. No deaths or damage was reported in association with the tropical depression.\nThe deadliest storm of the season, Hurricane Calvin, was first identified as an area of disturbed weather near the Gulf of Tehuantepec on July 2. Following the development of banding features, the disturbance organized into a tropical depression two days later, while situated southeast of Acapulco, Mexico. Quickly intensifying, the depression was soon named Calvin as it attained gale-force winds. After initially tracking westward, Calvin turned north and attained hurricane status before reinstating a westward component. Situated just off the coast of Mexico, Calvin attained its peak intensity with winds of 110 mph (175 km/h) on July 7 before moving ashore. Substantially disrupted by the interaction with land, the hurricane rapidly weakened before emerging back over water as a minimal system. Now a tropical depression, Calvin made its final landfall in Baja California Sur before dissipating over cold waters in the region.\n\nFollowing Calvin's closest approach, the Mexican Weather Service station in Manzanillo recorded a minimum barometric pressure of, as well as surface winds as the center of Calvin passed a little to the west. The Instituto Oceanografico del Pacifico in Manzanillo reported a minimum central pressure of . Only two other reports of tropical storm force winds were reported on the Mexican mainland, besides Manzanillo, were reported in associated with Calvin. In Calimo, sustained winds of were observed at 1300 UTC. Shortly thereafter, near 1545 UTC, sustained winds of with gusts up to were reported in the same location. Several ships reported rough weather during Calvin's existence, with the \"Pacific Sandpiper\" reporting a maximum wave height of . In Acapulco, it is reported that waves in excess of moved through the city. In several states, heavy rainfall between to inches was recorded. However, in Las Pilas, the highest rainfall total was observed, at . According to \"The Miami Herald\" and the \"West Hawaii Today\", Calvin is blamed for the 34 deaths, which includes both direct and indirect. Most of the fatalities came from heavy rainfall associated with the system. A state of emergency was declared in at least ten states in Mexico following Calvin's passage, and the Mexican Defense Department said that 42,063 people were evacuated in eleven states. Additionally, at least 1,600 people were left homeless. Finally, rough seas near Lázaro Cárdenas caused all 4,000 tons of sulfuric acid to leak aboard the previously beached cargo tanker, \"Betula\".\n\nOn June 27, a tropical wave emerged off the western coast of Africa and crossed the Atlantic with no further development. On July 9, the wave entered the Eastern Pacific, depicted with little in the way of heavy thunderstorm activity. However, on July 11, deep convection significantly increase in association with the disturbance, and it is estimated that a tropical depression formed three days later, at 1200 UTC. Embedded within an area of low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures, the depression quickly strengthened into a tropical storm, receiving the name \"Dora\", six hours after formation. Moving towards the west, Dora attained hurricane status at 1800 UTC on July 15, and Category 2 status by early on July 16. Strengthening further, Dora reached major hurricane status early the following morning, and reached its peak intensity of with a minimum barometric pressure of early on July 17. Moving west to west-northwest around the periphery of a subtropical high, the hurricane began to enter cooler sea surface temperatures (SST's) and higher wind shear. Thus, the cyclone weakened to a tropical storm by 1800 UTC on July 18. The following afternoon, Dora weakened to a tropical depression, and dissipated early on July 21. No deaths, damage, or associated impact because of the system was reported to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nA tropical wave traversed the Atlantic and Caribbean, before reaching the Pacific Ocean in mid-July. Following the development of a low-level circulation about south-southwest of the southern tip of Baja California, the system was classified as Tropical Depression Six-E on July 15. After banding features improved, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Eugene on July 16. The storm continued to strengthen and organize, reaching hurricane status early on July 17. Eugene attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 125 mph (205 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of at 1800 UTC on July 19. After peak intensity, Eugene began to weaken due to increasing wind shear and decreasing SST's, and was downgraded to a tropical storm on July 22.\n\nEugene crossed 140°W on July 22 and entered the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility. Eugene weakened further and was downgraded to a tropical depression on July 24. At 1200 UTC on July 24, Eugene made landfall near Pahala, Hawaii, with winds of 35 mph (55 km/h). After a buoy near the path of Eugene reported no abnormal weather on July 25, Eugene was declared dissipated at 0600 UTC, while located just southeast of the Hawaiian Islands. Eugene brought much-needed rain to the major Hawaiian Islands. The storm caused no significant damage, only scattered minor blackouts and breaking of tree limbs; roads were also dangerous to drive on. The only fatality in associated with Eugene was the death of a 45-year-old fisherman, who was killed when his boat was destroyed in rough seas.\n\nAn area of disturbed weather developed into Tropical Depression One-C at 0000 UTC on August 9, near 12°N, 144°W. The depression remained disorganized and strengthened slowly over the next three days. Late on August 12, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Keoni. Thereafter, it moved in a move west-northwesterly direction. Keoni intensified into a Category 1 hurricane by late on August 14. Less than 24 hours later, it reached Category 2 intensity. On August 18, Keoni peaked as a 130 mph (215 km/h) Category 4.\n\nThe storm passed about south of Johnston Atoll on August 18. As Keoni approached, about 1000 people evacuated the atoll. It brought rough seas and because the storm was compact, wind gusts reached only . By August 17, Keoni began to weaken and fell to Category 3 intensity. Six hours later, it weakened to a Category 2 hurricane. Keoni further fell to a Category 1 hurricane on August 18. Late on the following day, Keoni crossed the International Date Line and was re-classified as a typhoon.\nFernanda formed from a tropical wave that moved off the west African coast on July 28 and crossed into the Eastern Pacific Ocean. The developing storm reached tropical storm status on August 9 while 635 mi (1,022 km) south of the southern tip of Baja California, and Fernanda strengthened into a hurricane the next day. Fernanda developed a large and well-defined eye, reaching its peak of 145 mph (235 km/h) on August 12 over the open eastern Pacific. Fernanda eventually crossed into the central Pacific on August 14, and passed as close as 300 mi (483 km) northeast of the Big Island of Hawaii as a Category 2 hurricane on August 16. Fernanda later began to curve slowly to the northwest on August 16 under the influence of an upper-level trough after approaching the Hawaiian Islands, becoming extratropical on August 19 after weakening due to shear and cooler waters, with the remnant circulation merging with the cold upper-level trough.\n\nAlthough it did not make landfall in the Hawaiian Islands, Fernanda's close approach prompted a hurricane warning for the Big Island and a hurricane watch elsewhere in the islands. Heavy surf and wave action affected the islands, with waves as high as between 15 (5 m) and 20 ft (6 m) reported on Kauai, causing damage to shoreline roads on all of the islands, allowing water intrusion into some homes, and washing one home several feet off its foundation. Many beach parks were also inundated, though evacuations prevented any deaths. In total, Fernanda caused $5 million (1993 USD, $  USD) in damage to the Hawaiian Islands, and moisture induced by the interaction of Fernanda and the cold-core trough also affected the islands, producing showers and thunderstorms on all of the islands and localized flooding on Kauai.\n\nOn August 10, Tropical Storm Bret made landfall in Nicaragua with maximum sustained winds of . Moving quickly inland, Bret weakened to a tropical depression, and dissipated over the mountainous terrain of Central America. Moving off towards west, convection associated with the remnant area of cloudiness developed in intermittent bursts, but by August 14, a more steady trend of development was observed. While centered south-southeast of Manzanillo, it is estimated that a tropical depression formed around 0000 UTC August 15. According to the National Hurricane Center, satellite imagery on the 15th revealed a much better organized system than twenty-four hours previous, and the depression is estimated to have intensified into a tropical storm at 1200 UTC, receiving the name \"Greg\". Turning towards the west-northwest, the system continued to intensify, attaining hurricane status at 1200 UTC on August 16. At this time, hints of an eye feature was observable on satellite imagery. Rapid intensification then ensued, and Greg became a strong Category 2 hurricane by 1800 UTC, with maximum sustained winds of as a small and fairly well-defined eye became visible. However, shortly thereafter, the eye became obscured from view, an indication that Greg was on a weakening trend. A slowdown in forward motion occurred, and Greg turned towards the west before moving west-southwest, towards the general direction of Socorro Island.\nThe third in a series of intense August hurricanes, Hilary originated from a tropical wave that crossed Central America on August 14. By August 17, just three days after entering the Eastern Pacific, the wave was sufficiently organized to be declared Tropical Depression Nine-E. Tracking westward, the depression gradually developed, attaining hurricane status two days later. By this time, a ridge situated over the Gulf of Mexico caused Hilary to turn northwestward, parallel to the Mexican coastline. Following the development of an 18 mi (29 km) wide eye on August 21, the storm further intensified into a Category 3 hurricane, attaining peak winds of 120 mph (195 km/h). By August 23, the hurricane nearly stalled as it underwent a Fujiwhara interaction with the newly developed Tropical Storm Irwin. Executing a small counter-clockwise loop, Hilary degraded to tropical storm intensity and took a northerly track for the remainder of its existence. The storm made two landfalls in Mexico, one in Baja California Sur on August 25 and again near Hermosillo, Sonora the following day. The remnants of Hilary were last noted over the northern Gulf of California on August 27.\n\nDue to Hilary's proximity to Mexico on August 20, hurricane watches were issued for much of the southern coastline; however, they were later discontinued. Once the system began its northward track, further advisories were issued for the Baja California Peninsula as well as the Gulf of California coastline. Heavy rains, peaking at , accompanied the storm, though no damage or loss of life took place. The outer bands of the storm also brought localized downpours to parts of California, resulting in flash floods.\n\nOn August 20, convection increased south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec, when a tropical wave, which is likely responsible for Tropical Storm Cindy's in the Atlantic, moved into the region. Satellite imagery on August 21 revealed an increase in organization associated with the disturbance, and it is estimated that a tropical depression formed at 0600 UTC. Six hours later, the depression was upgraded to a tropical storm after a surface wind was reported by the ship \"BT Nestor\". Receiving the name \"Irwin\", the system moved off towards the northwest, displaying a rather disorganized cloud appearance. Additionally, most satellite wind estimates never topped , with the exception being a estimate from the Air Force Global Weather Center at 0427 UTC on August 22. At 2100 UTC on August 21, tropical storm warnings issued from Zihuatanejo to Cabo Corrientes, Mexico in anticipation of the storm's arrival. Despite the system's disorganized cloud appearance, combined observations from nearby ships, as well as a report from Manzanillo, Mexico, reveals Irwin's maximum sustained winds may have been as high as with a minimum barometric pressure of , which was set as the storm's peak intensity at 00 UTC on August 22. Paralleling the southern Mexican coastline, Irwin quickly weakened as it began to be absorbed by Hurricane Hilary. By 1800 UTC on August 22, Irwin was fully absorbed by Hurricane Hilary, when the hurricane was situated west of Irwin. At this time, all tropical storm warnings were discounted for the Mexican coastline.\n\nWhile located to the south of Manzanillo, the cyclone generated sustained winds of in the city, as well as a minimum pressure of . At the same time, winds of were reported in the Manzanillo harbor by Peter Maxwell, an owner of the hotel at the time, although, according to the National Hurricane Center, these winds were likely overestimated. In Jala, a maximum rainfall total of was recorded. No deaths or associated damage was reported with the system.\n\nOn August 14, a tropical wave moved off the east coast of Africa and entered the Atlantic Ocean. The wave moved westward, eventually entering the eastern Pacific Ocean. On August 26, signs of a circulation developing began to appear. The circulation gradually became better defined, and on August 29, the wave became a tropical depression while about 125 nautical miles south of the coast of Mexico. The depression moved northwestward, paralleling the coast of Mexico, becoming Tropical Storm Jova at 18:00 UTC. Early on August 31, Jova strengthened into a hurricane and shortly afterward began to rapidly intensify, reaching its peak intensity with sustained winds of 130 mph (215 km/h) at 06:00 UTC on September 1. Afterward, the eye of the hurricane became clouded and ill-defined, resulting in a swift weakening trend that brought it to minimal hurricane strength on September 2. Jova briefly reintensified on September 3, but began weakening once again afterward. Early on September 4, the hurricane weakened to a tropical storm, and then to a tropical depression at 12:00 UTC. Finally, at 00:00 UTC on September 6, Jova became a remnant low while well west of the Baja Peninsula.\n\nBecause Jova remained offshore, no damage or deaths occurred as a result of the hurricane. The outer rainbands of the storm dropped light rainfall in southern Mexico, with no reported impact.\n\nOn August 30, a cloud cluster just to the south of Panama was observed by the National Hurricane Center (NHC). Moving towards the west for several days, the disturbance remained relatively disorganized, but was classified as a tropical depression of 1200 UTC on September 5, after Satellite analysts at the NESDIS Synoptic Analysis Branch (SAB) and the NHC Tropical Satellite Analysis and Forecast (TSAF) unit classified the disturbance as a T1.5 by the Dvorak Technique at the time. Additionally, satellite imagery showed a typical banding type pattern, although the associated convection was loosely organized. However, by 0600 UTC September 6, convection had become more intense and better organized. Subsequently, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm \"Kenneth\", while situated south of the southern tip of Baja California. At this time, a large circulation associated with Kenneth was evident, with the ship \"Silvie III\" reporting sustained winds, which was positioned away from the storm's center. On September 7, deep convection began to markedly increase near the center of circulation, and it estimated that Kenneth attained hurricane status early on September 8. Continuing to strengthen, Kenneth attained Category 2 status at 0600 UTC on September 10, characterized by a distinct eye, and strengthened further to attain major hurricane status six hours later. Moving towards the northwest, Kenneth attained Category 4 status at 1800 UTC, and reached a peak intensity of with a minimum barometric pressure of at 0600 UTC on September 11. Shortly thereafter, the storm began to weaken as high wind shear and cooler sea surface temperatures began to impede on the storm. Kenneth weakened to a Category 3 hurricane early on September 12, and a Category 2 hurricane by 1800 UTC. Moving towards the west-northwest, Kenneth became a minimal hurricane late on September 14, and weakened further to tropical storm status at 00 UTC on September 15. The system weakened to a tropical depression on September 16, and finally, after thirteen days as a tropical cyclone, Kenneth dissipated in the open Pacific, without any effects to land.\nForming from a tropical wave on September 8, Lidia steadily organized and became a hurricane on September 10. The hurricane continued to strengthen while developing a well-defined eye, and peaked as a Category 4 hurricane on September 11. However, it weakened considerably before making landfall in Sinaloa as a Category 2 storm. Lidia dissipated near Austin, Texas on September 14 and was later absorbed by a cold front. Across Mexico, the hurricane killed seven people; over 100,000 people were forced to evacuate their homes. A total of 160 homes were destroyed and 10,000 people were left homeless because of the storm. In the United States, five people suffered injuries and storm damage totaled $8 million (1993 USD).\nMoving across the mountainous terrain of mainland Mexico, Atlantic Hurricane Gert quickly weakened to a tropical depression upon its emerge into the Pacific, where it was reclassified as Tropical Depression \"Fourteen-E\". Initially moving towards the west, and eventually towards the west-northwest, it is possible that the depression could have been close to tropical storm status before turning towards the southwest, west of the southern tip of Baja California. Deep convection began to decrease on September 24, and two days later, the depression dissipated. There are no reports of deaths or damage associated with Tropical Depression Fourteen-E, although its processor caused many deaths and extensive damage in Mexico.\n\nAn area of convection, probably associated with a tropical wave from the Atlantic, strengthened a tropical depression at 00 UTC on September 30. Continuing to organize, the depression strengthened into a tropical storm twelve hours later, earning the name \"Max\". However, shortly thereafter, strong wind shear removed convection from atop Max's low-level center, and the system weakened to a tropical depression. As a large upper-level anticyclone began to extend towards the west, the storm wind shear affecting Max resided, and it is estimated that the system reattained tropical storm status late on October 1, as deep convection redeveloped in associated with the cyclone. At 00 on October 2, Max reached its peak intensity of with a minimum barometric pressure of . Embedded within a region of weak steering currents, Max meandered for a couple of days while weakening. The system was once again downgraded to a tropical depression during the afternoon hours of October 3, and was later absorbed by a larger Tropical Storm Norma by 00 UTC on October 4. Because the system strayed far from land, no deaths, damage, or effects to land were reported.\n\nOn September 29, a large area of disturbed weather was first identified a few hundred miles to the south of Acapulco. Gradually organizing, the disturbance developed a closed, low-level center of circulation on October 2, and subsequently, was upgraded to a tropical depression at 1800 UTC, while centered south of the southern tip of Baja California. Embedded within a region of low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures, the depression quickly intensified to attain tropical storm status at 1200 UTC October 3, earning the name \"Norma\". Moving towards the northwest, Norma attained a peak intensity of with a minimum barometric pressure of early on October 4. At this time, the smaller Max was absorbed into Norma's circulation, and the storm moved into an area of southwesterly upper-level flow. Subsequently, Norma began to weaken, and its low-level center became exposed to the southwest of the system's deep convection late on October 4. Weakening to a tropical depression at 00 UTC on October 5, Norma drifted towards the northwest as a swirl of low clouds, and dissipated during the afternoon hours of October 6, without any fatalities, damage, or effects to land.\n\nOn October 11, the last tropical cyclone of the 1993 season developed several hundred miles to the southeast of Baja California. Under seemingly favorable conditions, the depression moved northwest and strengthened slightly to reach a peak intensity of with a minimum barometric pressure of . Shortly thereafter, the depression began to enter cooler sea surface temperatures and higher wind shear, subsequently dissipating at 00 UTC on October 14, without any effects on land.\nAccording to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center, on August 11 a tropical depression formed east of the International Dateline, and soon exited CPHC's area of responsibility. According to the JTWC, on October 12 a tropical depression formed east of the International Dateline, and 3 days later exited CPHC's area of responsibility. As it entered into western Pacific, it strengthened as a tropical storm and received the name \"Hattie\".\n\nThe following names were used for named storms that formed in the eastern Pacific in 1993. Names that were not assigned are marked in gray. No names were retired, so it was used again in the 1999 season. This is the same list used for the 1987 season with the exception of \"Kenneth\", which replaced \"Knut\" and was used to name a storm for the first time in 1993.\n\nFor storms that form in the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility, encompassing the area between 140 degrees west and the International Date Line, all names are used in a series of four rotating lists. The next four names that were slated for use in 1993 are shown below. However, only one name, \"Keoni\", was used.\n\nThis is a table of all the storms that have formed in the 1993 Pacific hurricane season. It includes their duration, names, landfall(s), denoted in parentheses, damages, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all the damage figures are in 1993 USD.\n\n\n"}

At the age of 11, he went to Nelson House preparatory school in Oxford and his parents hoped that this would be their son's key to a better life. But they were unable to pay the fees, and three years later he came back to the family home and attended Norlington Boys' School in Leyton. Pearce attended there for two years before leaving, at age 16, to go into the advertising industry.\n\nAfter a dispute with Barclays Bank, Pearce targeted six different branches on 6 December 1994 with home-made bombs. Two of them, in Hampstead and Ladbroke Grove, exploded, injuring two members of staff. From May 1995, Pearce was randomly sending bombs to different targets and addresses, including one to the Barclaycard headquarters in Northampton with a blackmail demand. In 1996 he targeted Barclays banks again, exploding two devices in the Ealing branch and one in Eltham from January to April. Three civilian injuries were caused by the last one in Ealing on 20 April.\n\nAfter 17 months of inactivity, Pearce resumed his blackmailing and bombing campaign, this time targeting Sainsbury's supermarkets, in the hope of obtaining money from them. He targeted five branches in November 1997 in the west and south-east London. A 73-year-old woman accidentally picked up a device left in West Ealing with her shopping. His last attack was in Eltham, south-east London, on 17 April 1998.\n\nIn total, he planted 36 devices. At the time he was unemployed and divorced, living in the affluent Chiswick area of west London. Police believed the suspect was acting alone and possibly influenced by Ted Kaczynski, who was being sentenced in America at the time.\n\nOn 28 April 1998, Pearce was arrested in Whitton, south-west London, after falling into a police trap whilst withdrawing cash, as his account was linked and being watched by the police. At his Chiswick home, police found home-made bombs. His terror campaign cost Sainsbury's £640,000 in lost trade.\n\nLawyers acting for Pearce claimed he suffers from Binswanger's disease, a rare form of dementia that can change the way people think. But following further medical reports, the judges at the Old Bailey rejected this. On 14 April 1999, he was convicted of 20 charges including causing an explosion, possessing firearms and wounding, and was sentenced to 21 years imprisonment.\n\nPearce was labeled the \"Mardi Gra\" bomber because he often left a calling card containing the phrase \"Welcome to the Mardi Gra experience\".\n\n"}

{"id": "2187721", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2187721", "title": "1992 Pacific hurricane season", "text": "1992 Pacific hurricane season\n\nThe 1992 Pacific hurricane season is the most active Pacific hurricane season on record, featuring 27 named storms. It was at the time the costliest Pacific hurricane season in history, until the record was surpassed 21 years later. The season also produced the highest ACE value on record at the time, until the record was surpassed 26 years later. The season officially started on May 15 in the eastern Pacific, and on June 1 in the central Pacific, and lasted until November 30. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. However, these bounds were easily exceeded when Hurricane Ekeka formed on January 28 and again a couple months later with Tropical Storm Hali.\n\nThe most notable storm was Hurricane Iniki, which caused billions of dollars of damage to the Hawaiian Islands, primarily in Kauai, along with six casualties. Hurricanes Lester, Virgil, Winifred, and Orlene also made landfall and killed several people, but were significantly less destructive. Hurricane Darby and Tropical Storm Agatha brought rains and more destruction to Mexico, without making landfall. Hurricane Tina was, in addition to being the strongest storm of the year, the longest-lasting Pacific hurricane at the time.\n\nThe season officially started on May 15, 1992, in the Eastern Pacific, and on June 1, 1992, in the central Pacific, and lasted until November 30, 1992. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern and north-central Pacific Ocean. However, the season wildly exceeded these bounds, as climatological effects including an El Niño caused Hurricane Ekeka to form on January 26. It is also the only known time that multiple cyclones had formed before the season began.\n\nDuring the season, twenty-seven tropical cyclones formed in the Eastern Pacific (east of longitude 140°W), and twenty-four developed further and became tropical storms. Both of these figures constitute records in the basin, as the 1992 season surpassed the season with the most tropical cyclones (1982, 26) and the season with the most named storms (1985, 22). Of these, fourteen reached hurricane strength and eight became major hurricanes—storms that reach Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale.\n\nThis season had five storms reach tropical storm intensity or higher in the month of October, the only time that had happened in this basin. In addition, Hurricanes or Tropical Storms Winifred through Zeke are the earliest twenty-first through twenty-fourth named storms in a season in the eastern north Pacific.\n\nThe Central Pacific (between 140°W and the International Date Line) saw similarly high levels of activity. Eleven tropical cyclones were tracked by the Central Pacific Hurricane Center throughout the hurricane season. Of those, eight developed in the Eastern Pacific and crossed into the Central Pacific, and three formed within the basin. Two of the storms strengthened to major hurricane status within the Central Pacific's boundaries.\n\nOne of the crossover storms, Iniki, crossed into the basin as a tropical depression, strengthened to a Category 4 hurricane, and made landfall in Hawaii, becoming the most destructive hurricane in the state's history.\n\nACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. ACE is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34 knots (39 mph, 63 km/h) or tropical storm strength. The figures in parentheses are for storms in the Central Pacific basin west of 140°W; those not in parentheses are for the Eastern Pacific basin. This season had the highest ACE of any season on record at the time, with an overall value of 295.492, until it was surpassed by the 2018 season.\n\nThe first storm of the season developed from an area of disturbed weather near Kiritimati in the Line Islands. The tropical disturbance had been tracked since January 23, and at 0600 UTC January 28, the Central Pacific Hurricane Center designated the system as Tropical Depression One-C. This was unusual, since the system was located well to the south of the area of normal tropical cyclone formation, further south than any other Pacific hurricane at the time, and the formation occurred well outside the climatological bounds of the hurricane season. The system intensified and reached tropical storm status 12 hours later, at which point it became known as Ekeka.\n\nThe system continued intensifying until reaching hurricane status at 0000 UTC on January 30, and it reached major hurricane status on February 2, reaching maximum sustained winds of 115 mph (185 km/h). However, unfavorable wind shear began taking a toll on the storm, causing it to rapidly weaken. Ekeka crossed the International Date Line as a weakened tropical storm, and shortly thereafter degraded to tropical depression status. Ekeka continued westward, passing through the Marshall Islands and later over Chuuk, before dissipating on February 9 about 310 mi (500 km) off the north coast of Papua New Guinea.\nIn late March, meteorological conditions similar to what allowed Ekeka to develop persisted in the central Pacific. An area of convection organized into Tropical Depression Two-C, just north of 5˚N, atypically close to the equator, and far to the southwest of Hawaii. Moving west-northwestward, it slowly intensified, intensifying into a tropical storm on March 29. Upon doing so, the CPHC gave it the name Hali. Later that day, the storm attained peak winds of 50 mph (85 km/h), before increased southwesterly wind shear imparted weakening. Hali was downgraded to a tropical depression on March 30, and it dissipated shortly thereafter. It never affected land. Hali is notable as being the only known Pacific tropical cyclone east of the dateline to develop in the month of March.\nOn May 26, a tropical wave moved off the Central America, which began to show signs of organization on May 29. Early on June 1, the NHC classified it as a tropical depression while located southwest of Acapulco. Based on a combination of ship data and Dvorak intensity estimates, the system was upgraded into Tropical Storm Agatha on June 2. Agatha steered toward the north while steadily intensifying. Around 1800 UTC June 2, the storm peaked in intensity with winds of 70 mph (110 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 990 mbar (hPa; 29.23 inHg).\n\nMaintaining its peak intensity for 30 hours, Agatha gradually decelerated as it passed within southwest of the Mexican coast. The center of the storm promptly became less defined on June 3, simultaneously recurving to the west. By 0600 UTC June 5, the storm was downgraded back into tropical depression status prior to dissipating the next day.\n\nAgatha approached close enough to the coast of Mexico that watches and warnings were issued. An estimated 1,500 people were evacuated due to the storms' approach. Waves up to were reported along the coast of Mexico and torrential rains triggered flash flooding resulting in ten fatalities.\n\nA tropical wave went through Central America during the period of June 14 and June 16. The system entered the Eastern Pacific basin without much convection. The northward portion of the wave developed a circulation in the mid-levels of the atmosphere. Moving westbound, the storms was poorly organized. Over waters marginally suitable for cyclogenesis, a tropical wave organized into the third depression of the season on June 22 as deep convection developed near the center. At this time, the system was located south of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula. Early on June 23, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Blas. Although the storm developed an impressive upper-level outflow and well-organized thunderstorm activity. Although the storm was moving into an area sea surface temperatures of , the National Hurricane Center (NHC) forecasted slight intensification. Water vapor imagery also suggested that strong wind shear would introduce a weakening trend. Later that day, Blas weakened back into a depression, and dissipated on 000 UTC June 24. Blas never affected land.\n\nCelia formed from tropical wave that crossed over into the East Pacific basin around June 19. Dvorak Classifications were initiated on June 21, and a circulation developed the next day. The system was classified as a tropical depression while located west of Guatemala based on ship reports. Upon becoming a tropical cyclone the storm formed further east than most Pacific hurricanes due to little wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures near Central America. Due to these conditions, Meteorologists at the NHC were anticipating steady intensification. Although the storm was initially ragged via weather satellite imagery the storm intensified into Tropical Storm Celia on 1800 UTC June 23 as banding features improved. The banding features continued to improve and by the evening on June 24, Celia had developed a large area of convection near the center, and the NHC re-assessed the intensity at 65 mph (100 km/h). At that time, the agency noted that Celia had the potential to become a hurricane at any time. In addition, the storm was forecasted to become a moderate Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale.\n\nSeveral hours later, Celia was upgraded into a hurricane based on intensity estimates via Dvorak Technique. Celia's rate of intensification accelerated and thus underwent a period of rapid deepening. Overnight, the storm developed an excellent upper-level outflow and very cold cloud tops. Late on June 25, an eye appeared, and the NHC classified the storm as a strong Category 1 hurricane. By midday June 26, Celia intensified into a Category 2 hurricane A well-defined eye soon developed, and the storm was upgraded into a Category 3 hurricane later that day. Early on June 27, Celia became a Category 4 major hurricane with winds of 145 mph (230 km/h) and a minimal pressure of . Celia maintained Category 4 intensity for about 24 hours and then started to gradually weaken.\n\nLate on June 28, the eye became somewhat ragged. Celia fluctuated in intensity over the next several days. at 0000 UTC June 29. Moving westward at an unsteady pace, Celia weakened to winds of 85 mph (130 km/h) 18 hours later. this made it a Category 1 hurricane. The system briefly re-intensified into a moderate Category 2 hurricane, but later resumed the weakening trend. Celia fell below hurricane status on 000 UTC July 2. Turing northwest, the tropical cyclone weakened back to tropical depression status the next day. Thereafter, all that was left of Celia was a tight low to mid-level swirl of low-convection clouds and dissipated July 4.\nA tropical wave organized into tropical depression Five-E on July 2. It strengthened and was named Darby the next day. Steering currents became very strong, and Darby accelerated as it paralleled the coast of Mexico. It strengthened into a hurricane on July 5 and also substantially increased in size. It peaked as a strong Category 3 on July 6. Darby began to substantially weaken thereafter as it passed over cooler waters. The hurricane weakened into a storm and then a depression on July 8 and July 9, respectively. Tropical Depression Darby lost tropical characteristics the next day. Moisture from the hurricane eventually spread over parts of the Continental United States.\n\nDuring Darby's formation, flooding from the cyclone's rainbands killed three people in Acapulco, where 180 shops were damaged. Four fishermen were reported missing, fate unknown. Manzanillo, Colima, reported sustained winds just above tropical-storm force. The hurricane's remnants brought mainly light rain to the U.S. state of California. Cloud cover also delayed the landing of the Space Shuttle \"Columbia\" for one day. South-facing beaches of that state were pounded with waves up to 7 feet (2.3 m) in height. A monetary value for damage is not available.\n\nDarby also caused a few shipping accidents. A pleasure craft, the \"Oasis\", had an engine failure and was abandoned. The seven people aboard were rescued, but the boat was sunk. A smaller sailboat, the \"Hosanna\", had difficulties but was towed to a safe location by a cutter from the United States Coast Guard. A fishing boat at an unspecified location also experienced difficulties.\n\nThe origins of Hurricane Estelle were from a tropical wave that began on June 23 off the African coast. After passing over northern South America, a large area of disturbed weather formed about west of Acapulco on July 9 and was classified as a tropical depression two days later. Eighteen hours later, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Estelle as banding features increased. Gradually intensifying, the storm's outflow improved, and a burst of deep convection occurred over the center. Early on July 10, an eye developed, and based on this, Estelle was upgraded into a hurricane. Around that time, Estelle turned to the northwest.\n\nAlthough the eye briefly disappeared from satellite imagery later that day, a small and distinct eye quickly re-formed within very deep convection, and Estelle was respectively upgraded into a Category 2 hurricane. Later on July 11, the NHC reported that Estelle had intensified into a major hurricane. A few hours later, Estelle was upgraded into a Category 4 system as the storm continued to rapidly deepen. Moving northwestward due to interaction with a trough, Estelle began a weakening trend. By the afternoon, Estelle was downgraded into a Category 3 system. At 0000 UTC, winds fell below major hurricane force, only to re-intensify back to a major hurricane hours later. Hurricane Estelle quickly re-developed a well-defined eye and an impressive upper-level outflow and Estelle attained its peak intensity of 140 mph (230 km/h). However, the next day the thunderstorms around the eye began to warm. The storm gradually weakened over the next few days as it encountered cooler waters. By early on July 14, Hurricane Estelle was re-classified as a Category 3 hurricane, and shortly afterwards, winds fell below major hurricane strength several hundred miles west of the Baja California Peninsula. Turning west under shallow low-level steering currents, Estelle weakened into a tropical storm on July 15. It weakened into a tropical storm the next day. On 0800 UTC July 17, Tropical Depression Estelle had dissipated over west of Baja California Sur.\n\nThe origins of Hurricane Frank were from a tropical wave that exited the coast of Africa on July 1. After reaching the Pacific, it developed an area of disturbed weather on July 9 off the southern Mexican coast. Continuing westward, the system developed into Tropical Depression Seven-E on July 13 about 660 mi (1070 km) south-southeast of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula. The depression intensified with favorable water temperatures and well-defined outflow. Based on estimates from satellite imagery, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Frank on July 14. For about a day, the storm tracked generally northwestward before turning to the west due to a building ridge north of the system. An eye developed within the Central Dense Overcast, a large mass of deep convection, late on July 14. Additional intensification was expected, and Frank was predicted to become a major hurricane within 48 hours. The next day, Frank attained hurricane status.\n\nLate on July 15, Hurricane Frank passed about 175 mi (280 km) south of Socorro Island. A station on the island reported winds of 67 mph (107 km/h), which indicated that the hurricane had a large wind field. Slow intensification continued, and Frank intensified into a major hurricane, or a Category 3 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, on July 17. By that time, the eye had become well-defined, and later became surrounded by a ring of deep convection. On July 18, Frank reached its peak intensity of 145 mph (230 km/h) well to the west-southwest of the Baja California peninsula. By July 20, winds dropped below major hurricane intensity, and by the evening, Frank was just a Category 1 hurricane.\n\nAfterward, the hurricane turned northwestward over progressively cooler water temperatures, resulting in weakening. On July 21 Frank was downgraded to a tropical storm, after wind shear caused further weakening. The next day, it crossed into the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility, with winds at the time of crossing over were estimated at 50 mph (85 km/h). Rapidly declining in strength, it weakened to a tropical depression on July 23. Later that day Frank dissipated about 800 mi (650 km) northeast of Hawaii.\n\nA tropical wave left Africa in early July and crossed the Atlantic without development. It crossed into the eastern Pacific on July 13, and organized into Tropical Depression Eight-E on July 14. The system was located over warm waters, and moving west-northwest, the depression paralleled the coast of Mexico and strengthened into Tropical Storm Georgette on July 15. About 18 hours later, Georgette became a minimal hurricane after deep convection developed over the center. During its formative stages, Georgette brought higher than average humidity to California. The hurricane turned westward due to a ridge to the north, but a west-northwest track later resumed. On July 18, Georgette reached a peak of 110 mph (175 km/h) and a minimum pressure of , although the NHC operationally estimated peak winds of .\n\nShortly after its peak, the eye became less defined, only intermittently seen on satellite imagery. After wind shear increased, Georgette weakened for about two days, and on July 20 a ridge forced the hurricane southwestward. Similar to hurricanes Celia and Estelle earlier this season, Georgette re-intensified once it turned back toward the west and it regained its peak intensity as a Category 2 hurricane on July 21. Although meteorologists predicted the storm to intensify into a major hurricane, this did not occur. Strong upper-level winds weakened Georgette back to a tropical storm early on July 23. About 30 hours later, it weakened to a tropical depression, devoid of deep convection, and shortly thereafter entered the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility. Moving quickly westward, Georgette had difficulty maintaining a closed atmospheric circulation, and it dissipated late on July 26. Around that time, the system was south of Hawaii, and it brought locally gusty winds as high as to the northern part of the Big Island. Several large waterspouts were sighted early on July 26 off of a beach in the south Kohala district. Georgette's remnants later produced squally weather at Johnston Atoll. The remnants moved across the International Dateline into the western Pacific on July 29, and was still a weak tropical disturbance when it moved past Wake Island at the end of the month.\n\nOn July 26 a tropical depression formed and became a weak tropical storm the next day. It steadily organized, ad reached it peak intensity as a strong tropical storm. It then began to weaken, despite being located over warm waters. Howard dissipated several days later without affecting land.\n\nIsis formed on July 28 as a depression and became a tropical storm the next day. Isis peaked as a strong tropical storm with winds on July 30. Due to cooler water, it weakened to a depression on the first and dissipated the next day. Isis degenerated to a broad area of low pressure on August 2.\n\nHurricane Javier probably originated from a tropical wave that left Africa on July 17. While it showed some signs of organization off the west coast of Africa, most of the convection dissipated by time it was near the Lesser Antilles. Around the time it entered the Pacific on July 27, thunderstorm activity increased and became more concentrated. By July 30, the cloud pattern began to organize, though it was initially elongated. Moving westward, the system was declared a tropical depression on 1800 UTC July 30.\n\nInitially, the depression developed slowly and there was even uncertainty on whether it had an atmospheric circulation or not. It was not until 1200 UTC August 2 when the system was finally upgraded into a tropical storm. Around this time, Javier turned west-northwest, a direction it would maintain for days when a ridge north of the cyclone caused it turn to the west, and later, west-southwest. Shortly after turning west, Javier intensified into a hurricane.\n\nBy 0000 UTC August 6, Hurricane Javier had attained peak wind speeds of . After hanging on to hurricane strength for a day, Javier rapidly lost deep convection and become much less organized. By August 7, winds were only . However, the weakening rate slowed somewhat once Javier before it moved CPhC's AOR on August 8. Tropical Storm Javier continued to diminish in strength while moving west-southwest. On August 9, the CHPC reported that Javier had weakened into a tropical depression. By 0000 UTC August 12, Javier had dissipated south of Hawaii. As a dissipating tropical depression, some rainfall and showers were recorded along the Hawaiian islands.\n\nTwelve-E had a peak windspeed of 35 mph (55 km/h), and a pressure of . It formed on August 10, and dissipated on August 13.\n\nA depression formed on August 18. It became a tropical storm shortly after forming and was named Kay. Kay was a short lived system. Its peak intensity was only . However, Kay was a very small tropical storm. It dissipated on August 22. Kay never impacted land.\nTropical Depression Fourteen-E formed on August 20 from a tropical wave that began to show signs of organized on August 19. At the time of the upgrade, it was located about 275 miles (445 km) south-southwest of Manzanillo. The depression slowly strengthened and steadily organized attained tropical storm status late on August 20. The next day, Lester turned to the north. Lester intensified into a hurricane late on August 22 while located about 240 miles (385 km) west of La Paz. The hurricane continued to organize and Lester attained peak winds of 85 mph (140 km/h) on August 23 before making landfall as a minimal hurricane near Punta Abreojos, Baja California Sur. After passing through the northern Gulf of California, it made a second landfall in the state of Sonora as a tropical storm. Lester entered Arizona as a tropical storm on August 24, the first time since 1967 that a Pacific hurricane entered the United States as a tropical storm. The low-level circulation subsequently dissipated over New Mexico, though the remnants transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, and subsequently merged with the remnants of Hurricane Andrew and another frontal system on August 29.\n\nHurricane Lester produced heavy rainfall across its path with a peak rainfall occurring in Mulege. Extensive flood damage was reported west of Hermosillo. A large highway was damaged and many communities were destroyed. Flash flooding from Lester caused 10,000 people to be evacuated from their homes. In addition, mudslides killed three people, and left 5,000 homeless. The remnants of Lester produced heavy rainfall across the Southwestern United States causing flash flooding of arroyos and moderate flooding in Denver. Snowfall from the storm generated traffic problems in mountainous areas. The remnants of Lester extended through the eastern United States, resulting in rainfall records in Minnesota, Nebraska, Colorado, and North Dakota. In all, Hurricane Lester resulted in $3 million (1992 USD) in damage.\n\nFar in the open ocean, a tropical wave organized into Tropical Depression Fifteen-E on August 27. Banding and convection increased, and the depression became a tropical storm the next day. Development continued, and Madeline peaked with a minimum pressure of , and winds of 50 mph (85 km/h), on August 29. As the system progressed westward, it entered a region of strong wind shear and had dissipated on August 31. The system never came near land.\n\nNewton was a fairly short-lived storm. It formed from a tropical wave on August 27. It became a tropical storm, was named Newton 18 hours later, and dissipated four days later on August 31. Newton never impacted any land.\n\nTropical Depression Seventeen-E formed September 2, rapidly intensifying to a tropical storm the next day, then a Category 1 hurricane late that day. Orlene peaked at Category 4 major hurricane status on September 6. The system held intensity for a day or so, with gradual weakening due to shear over the area, but the shear relaxed over the cyclone early on September 9, which brought about a quick restrengthening phase on September 9, although it stopped, and the weakening trend resumed later that day. Orlene weakened back to a tropical storm on September 10, and finally a depression on September 12, around the same time that it moved into the Central Pacific. It dissipated two days later, on September 14, after making landfall as a tropical depression on the Big Island of Hawaii. The remnants caused downpours and washed out roads, and the damage was minimal, though some areas got up to of rain.\nForming on September 5 about 1,700 miles (2,700 km) southwest of Cabo San Lucas, the depression continued quickly westward and remained weak until September 8, when it strengthened into a tropical storm. Having been designated in the Central Pacific, the storm was given the name Iniki. Iniki continued westward and strengthened over the unusually favorable central Pacific; it reached hurricane status on September 9 while 470 miles (760 km) south-southeast of Hilo. The subtropical ridge, which typically keeps hurricanes well away from the Hawaiian Islands, weakened due to an approaching upper level-trough and allowed Iniki to turn to the northwest. With very favorable upper-level outflow and warm water temperatures, Iniki steadily intensified, and attained major hurricane status on September 10 while south-southwest of the island chain. As Iniki turned to the north, it continued to strengthen, reaching a peak of 145 mph (235 km/h) winds on September 11 while 170 miles (270 km) south-southwest of Kauai. It continued rapidly to the north-northeast, and made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale.\n\nAfter crossing the island, Iniki weakened rapidly, and became extratropical on September 13 about halfway between Alaska and Hawaii. The Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) failed to issue tropical cyclone warnings and watches for the hurricane well in advance as the CPHC forecast Iniki to remain well south of the island chain until September 10, less than 24 hours before landfall that any warning was given to the public. Iniki's large wind field caused nearly 30,000 people to evacuate to 110 public shelters in Oahu.\n\nHurricane Iniki's high winds caused extensive damage in Kauai. 1,421 houses were completely destroyed, and 63 were lost from the storm surge and wave action. A total of 5,152 homes were severely damaged, while 7,178 received minor damage. Iniki's high winds also downed 26.5% of the island's transmission poles, 37% of its distribution poles, and 35% of its 800-mile (1300 km) distribution wire system. Some areas were without power for up to three months after the storm. More than 7,000 people were homeless after the storm's passage. One person died when struck by debris, while another lost her life when a portion of her house fell on her. Offshore, two humans died when their boat capsized. More than 100 injuries can be attributed to Iniki.\n\nUpon passing by Oahu, Iniki produced tides of 1.7–3 feet (0.5–0.9 m) above normal. Prolonged periods of high waves severely eroded and damaged the southwestern coast of Oahu. In all, Hurricane Iniki caused several million dollars in property damage, and two deaths on Oahu. Overall, Iniki was the costliest hurricane to strike the state of Hawaii, causing $3.1 billion in damage. In all, Iniki also was responsible for 6 deaths. During the aftermath of the storm, communities held parties to necessarily consume perishable food from unpowered refrigerators and freezers. Kauai citizens remained hopeful for monetary aid from the government or insurance companies, though after six months they felt annoyed with the lack of help. though military effectively provided aid for their immediate needs. Amateur radio proved to be helpful during the three weeks after the storm, with volunteers coming from around the Pacific to assist in the recovery. Local operators assisted with the American Red Cross to provide disaster relief centers across Kauai. Many insurance companies left Hawaii after the storm, forcing Hawaii to launch a Hurricane Relief Fund in 1993 to help unprotected Hawaii residents, but it was stopped in 2000.\n\nThe tropical wave from which Paine originated moved off the coast of Africa on August 25, reaching the Caribbean on September 2, and eventually crossed Central America and the Yucatán Peninsula. The wave finally reached the Pacific on September 8, developing a mid-level circulation a short distance south of Manzanillo. The circulation finally organized enough to be classified as Tropical Depression Nineteen-E early on September 11, a couple hundred miles southwest of Baja California. The depression continued just south of due west for the next couple of days, under the influence of a deep-layer-mean anticyclone. The depression soon intensified into Tropical Storm Paine around 1800 UTC on the September 11. Gradually intensifying, the storm approached hurricane intensity early on September 13. Upon the formation of an eye, Paine attained hurricane status. Meanwhile, the storm reached its peak intensity of 75 mph (120 km/h), a mid-level Category 1 hurricane.\n\nPaine then slowed to a forward speed of only , while executing a slow, erratic clockwise loop for the next three days. The loop was initially caused by an approaching trough, but was later caused by Paine's proximity to the approaching Hurricane Roslyn from the east. By 1800 UTC September 14, Paine weakened back to a tropical storm. By September 16, Paine had dissipated. The remnants of Hurricane Paine were later absorbed into Roslyn's larger circulation.\n\nOn September 13, a tropical wave developed into Tropical Depression Twenty-E, about south of Baja California. Despite initial disorganization, the system developed an eye-like feature the next day and was named Tropical Storm Roslyn, the storm also began to develop banding features, concurrent with the better establishment of upper-level outflow. Roslyn quickly intensified to just below hurricane status on the September 15, but began a short weakening trend, as it passed through the wake of Hurricane Paine, where it had begun intensifying on the 11th. By 1800 UTC that day, Roslyn began interacting with the weakening and nearby Paine, with centers of both systems being only a few hundred miles apart, and with this interaction, Paine was absorbed into Roslyn the next day, although this merger didn't affect Roslyn's intensity in the least. On the September 18, Roslyn had a brief period of strengthening. By September 21, deep convection began to rapidly increase, followed by a visible eye on satellite imagery the next day, which indicated that Roslyn had reached hurricane intensity. The hurricane peaked at moderate Category 2 status later on the September 22, with a quick decrease in strength thereafter. Roslyn was downgraded to a tropical storm just as it crossed into the Central Pacific two days later, and over the next several days, a trough to the west turned the weakening Roslyn to the northeast, and then to the north. The system finally dissipated on September 30, over two weeks after it formed.\n\nOn September 17, a tropical wave was upgraded into a tropical depression. The next day, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Seymour a couple hundred miles south of the southern tip of Baja California, and while continuing on a west-northwest and northwest track, Seymour reached hurricane strength on September 19. However, the system soon weakened to a tropical storm, due to the effects of a trough producing moderate shear, and cooler waters. This was short-lived. The trough soon moved out of the area and was replaced by a ridge, which steered Seymour to the west, and allowed it to regain hurricane status on the September 23, while Seymour had developed a broad and clear eye. However, Seymour only held hurricane intensity for a short period of time, and by that night, it had already weakened back to a tropical storm. After losing a significant amount of deep convection, it weakened to a depression two days later. Tropical Depression Seymour finally dissipated on September 27. Seymour never affected land, and no damage or deaths were reported.\nTina was the strongest storm of the season and threatened land for a time. It formed from a tropical wave on September 17. It moved glacially towards the west and strengthened into a hurricane. A breakdown in a ridge and to the north and a trough then recurved Tina to the northeast and towards land, still moving slowly and gradually slowing down. The trough broke down and was replaced by a strong ridge. Tina then changed direction again and headed out to sea. It intensified into a Category 4 storm with a central pressure of . Tina then slowly weakened as it turned to the north. The stubborn Tropical Depression Tina dissipated on October 11, shortly after entering the central Pacific. Similar to Hurricane Isabel, Tina displayed annular characteristics.\n\nDue to its erratic track and slow motion, Tina was alive from September 17 to October 11— a span of 24 days. This is the record for the eastern Pacific Ocean, smashing the east/central record of 20 days held by Hurricane Fico in the 1978 season and surpassing Typhoon Rita's west Pacific 1972 record. It was itself surpassed just two years later by Hurricane John.\nOn October 1, a tropical wave organized into Tropical Depression Twenty Three-E, a few hundred miles south of the Mexican coast. Despite weak shearing over the system, it became Tropical Storm Virgil later that day, rapidly intensifying to a hurricane on the October 2, when a distinct and well defined eye appeared on satellite images. Virgil was originally on a slow northwest track, but a mid-upper level trough turned the hurricane to the north early on October 3. Despite the change in track, the hurricane reached a peak at minimal Category 4 status around the same time that it turned to the north that day. Virgil continued north until early on October 4, when it turned to the northwest and made landfall at high Category 2 strength, halfway between Manzanillo and Lázaro Cárdenas, and after landfall, the system was quickly weakened over the mountainous terrain of Mexico, passing to the north of Manzanillo late on the October 4. Shortly after passing over Manzanillo, it weakened below tropical storm strength, and early on October 5, the weakened Tropical Depression Virgil exited into the Pacific, but no regeneration was expected, as strong westerlies and the weakened state of the system prevented any regeneration, and it dissipated shortly thereafter.\n\nBecause Virgil made landfall in a sparsely populated area, damage from storm surge was minimal. The chief effect was heavy rain and flooding, peaking at over in one location.\nAn area of disturbed weather developed into Tropical Depression Twenty Four-E a few hundred miles south of Acapulco. The next day, it was upgraded into Tropical Storm Winifred when satellite imagery showed increased convective banding features around the storm's center. Winifred was upgraded to a hurricane on October 8, subsequently an eye appeared on satellite imagery. Hurricane Winifred peaked at Category 3 status the next day, turning to the north-northeast just hours before landfall. Initially, the storm maintained major hurricane intensity; however, the eye had disappeared hours prior to landfall. Based on this, Winifred weakened into a Category 2 hurricane. On October 9, it made landfall just east-southeast of Manzanillo. At the time it was a weak Category 2 hurricane with winds of 110 mph (175 km/h) and a central pressure of . After moving ashore, Hurricane Winifred rapidly weakened to a depression over the mountainous terrain of Mexico by October 10, while continuing on a northeast track and finally degenerating to a remnant low later that day.\n\nThree people were killed by floods. Damage was concentrated in Colima and Michoacán. High waves flooded portions of Highway 200 between Zihuatenajo, Ixtapa, and Lázaro Cárdenas. Electricity and water systems was knocked out in Colima. About of farmland were damaged. Total damage in one state was estimated at 16000 pesos (1992 MXP) or $5 million (1992 USD, $  USD). The highest point maximum reported was of , recorded at Lázaro Cárdenas, Michoacán. Elsewhere, Winifred forced a temporary closure of the port of Acapulco.\n\nOn October 13, a tropical wave developed a visible low level circulation center, developing into Tropical Depression Twenty Five-E later that day, several hundred miles south of Baja California. The system quickly reached tropical storm status, while moving west at about . On October 17, Xavier dissipated several hundred miles south of the tip of Baja California, the remnants were tracked for several days, until it moved out of range of available satellites. Xavier was only the second tropical system to be named with an 'X' in the eastern Pacific basin, after 1985's Xina. Xavier formed at sea, and therefore, no deaths or damages are associated with it.\n\nOn October 15 a tropical depression formed from the wave several hundred miles south of Manzanillo, and on October 16, it strengthened into Tropical Storm Yolanda. The storm turned to the northwest later that day, and maintained this track for the rest of its lifespan. Yolanda peaked as a strong tropical storm on October 19, but strong southwesterly shear removed all deep convection within the storm's circulation later that day, although there were several occasional flare-ups of convection for the next 12 hours or so. The storm weakened back to a depression the next day, while steering currents moved the weakening depression's center to the southwest, and then finally the west before dissipating in the Central Pacific on the October 22. Due to the fact that it formed at sea, no deaths or damages are associated with the storm.\nOn October 25, a tropical wave organized into Tropical Depression Twenty Seven-E several hundred miles south of Baja California. It became Tropical Storm Zeke the next day, concurrent to developing banding features as well as good upper level outflow. A mid-upper level trough approached the west coast of the United States, which induced strong shear over the storm, separating deep convection from the center, and it was downgraded to depression status on October 27. However, the trough also forced Zeke north, then northeast, which resulted in the shear weakening, allowing it to re-develop, and the system was again upgraded to tropical storm status. Zeke reached peak intensity on the October 29, while on course for a potential landfall in Baja California. Despite reaching peak intensity, new westerlies spread over Zeke, which rapidly weakened the system, eventually dissipating on October 30.\nTropical Depression Two-E developed during June 16, about to the southwest of Mexico City. Over the next few days the system moved north-westwards, but did not develop any further and dissipated on June 18.\n\nDuring September 24, a tropical disturbance developed within the trade-wind trough of low pressure, just to the east of the International Dateline. Over the next few days the system gradually developed further as it moved north-westwards, before it was classified as Tropical \nDepression 21W by the JTWC during September 26. The system subsequently moved out of the Central Pacific basin and into the Western Pacific, where it was immediately classified as a tropical storm by both the JTWC and the Japan Meteorological Agency and named Ward by the former. During October 23, a tropical disturbance developed within the trade-wind trough of low pressure about to the south of Johnston Island. Over the next day atmospheric convection surrounding the systems low level circulation increased, as it moved towards the International Dateline. During October 24, it was classified as Tropical Depression 27W, by the JTWC in coordination with the CPHC because of its proximity to the Western Pacific basin. 27W subsequently gradually intensified further, before it was classified as a tropical storm and named Dan by the JTWC, just after it had moved into the Western Pacific basin. During November a small tropical disturbance developed, within a cloud mass over to the southwest of Hawaii's Big Island. Over the next few days, the system moved westwards and developed a closed circulation, before it was designated as Tropical Depression 03C by the CPHC during November 21. The system continued to move westwards over the next 24 hours but did not develop any further and dissipated during November 23.\n\nThe following names were used for named storms that formed in the Northeast Pacific Ocean in 1992. No eastern Pacific names were retired, so it was used again in the 1998 season. This is the same list used for the 1986 season. Storms were named \"Seymour\", \"Tina\", \"Virgil\", \"Winifred\", \"Xavier\", \"Yolanda\", and \"Zeke\" for the first time in 1992. Yolanda and Zeke were the first Y and Z names used in the Pacific basin.\n\nAll names on the list were used this year. This is the second time that a Northeastern Pacific hurricane season had exhausted its list. The 1983 season also used every name on its list, but the list only went to the W name at the time. In addition, the 1985 season's list was lengthened while it was going on to prevent exhaustion.\nFor storms that form in the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility, encompassing the area between 140 degrees west and the International Date Line, all names are used in a series of four rotating lists. The next four names that were slated for use in 1992 are shown below. Three of them - \"Ekeka\", \"Hali\", and \"Iniki\", were used throughout the course of the year. Also, a fourth system, Tropical Storm Ward, unofficially formed in the Central Pacific but received a name from the Western Pacific naming lists.\n\nOne name was retired from the Central Pacific list after the 1992 season – \"Iniki\". It was replaced with \"Iolana\". Later, in 2006, a name change for various Central Pacific names took place and a second name, \"Hali\", was removed and replaced by \"Hene\".\n\nThis is a table of all the storms that have formed in the 1992 Pacific hurricane season. It includes their duration, names, landfall(s), denoted in parentheses, damages, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all the damage figures are in 1992 USD.\n\n\n"}

Typically, exempt property includes a family car, and a certain amount of cash (perhaps $10,000-$20,000), or the equivalent value in personal property.\n\nExempt property calculations and provisions are determined on a state-by-state basis. This is important within the bankruptcy process, and may affect an individual's decision to file Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy. State exemptions vary from strict to generous. For example, Texas property exemptions are more lenient and include your homestead and up to $60,000 in personal property. Texas also exempts certain investments and insurance policies.

{"id": "2187733", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2187733", "title": "1991 Pacific hurricane season", "text": "1991 Pacific hurricane season\n\nThe 1991 Pacific hurricane season was a near-average Pacific hurricane season. The worst storm this year was Tropical Storm Ignacio, which killed ten people in Mexico. Elsewhere, Tropical Storm Ignacio injured forty people in Mexico, and Hurricane Fefa caused flooding in Hawaii. Hurricane Kevin was the strongest system of the season and became the then longest-lasting hurricane in the eastern north Pacific basin. Hurricane Nora was the strongest November storm at that time.\n\nThe season officially started on May 15, 1991, in the eastern Pacific, and on June 1, 1991, in the central Pacific. It lasted until November 30, 1991, in both basins. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean.\n\nDuring the season, a total of sixteen tropical cyclones developed, featuring ten hurricanes, four tropical storms and two tropical depressions. These totals are close to the climatological averages established since 1966, when satellite surveillance began. However, the season was less active than 1990, which had a record 16 hurricanes (more than 1991). On the other hand, it ended late with the first November hurricane since 1966. On the other hand, the months of July and August, often the most active ones in this basin, only produced two tropical cyclones each. The activity in July is four systems below the average of six at that time due to unusual circulation patterns aloft over the tropical Pacific. A shorter gap from late August to early September was attributed to anomalous flow patterns near the Baja California Peninsula. Several tropical cyclones grew into specially long-lived and intense systems. For example, Hurricane Kevin endured as a hurricane for 12½ days to the east of 140°W, establishing a new record for longevity in the eastern Pacific.\n\nNone of the tropical storms or hurricanes made landfall. One of the two tropical depressions of the season, Five-E, came ashore near Salina Cruz, Mexico, on the last day of June. The depression caused the only fatality of the season, injured five hundred, with two people missing. Delores, Ignacio and Marty threatened the coast of Mexico, coming close enough to require tropical cyclone watches and warnings. Of these, Ignacio was also responsible for 40 injuries as the system passed just offshore of Lázaro Cárdenas. Public advisories were issued for four other systems due to the threat of heavy rain along the coast.\n\nTropical cyclone data was gathered at 6 hour intervals throughout the season. Even though most intensity assessments were estimates via the Dvorak Technique, there was a large research mission for Tropical cyclogenesis in the Pacific. A NOAA research mission investigated Hurricane Jimena and gathered a few surface observations. Track forecasts were slightly more accurate than the past three years; intensity forecasts were comparable to the previous three seasons.\n\nThe season began with the formation of Tropical Depression One-E on May 16 and ended with the dissipation of Tropical Depression Nora on November 12. One named storm formed in May, three in June, two in July, two in August, three in September, two in October, and one in November.\n\nOn May 16, the first tropical depression of the season formed to the southwest of Baja California, out of a tropical disturbance that had developed during May 5 within the vicinity of Panama. During May 16 the depression gradually developed, before early the next day the National Hurricane Centre declared it a tropical storm and named it Andres. The newly named tropical cyclone reached its peak intensity of 60 mph (95 km/h), later that day. After maintaining its peak intensity for 24 hours, Andres started to gradually weaken as upper level windshear over the system increased before it dissipated during May 20. Throughout its life as a tropical cyclone, Andres moved very little and slowly executed a cyclonic loop, while remaining well away from any land.\n\nA well organized tropical wave over northern Africa entered the Atlantic Ocean on May 31. The wave never showed signs of organization while crossing the Atlantic. It emerged into the eastern north Pacific on June 10. It was not until June 13 when the convection associated with the wave became better organized. On June 14, Tropical Depression Two-E formed at a location about 515.7 miles (830 km) from Acapulco, Mexico.\n\nFor the next 48 hours, the depression moved toward the west and then northwest in response to a weakening ridge to the northwest. On June 17, the strong shear relaxed somewhat and the exposed center moved under the deep convection again. Thus, the depression strengthened into a tropical storm about 723.9 miles (1,165 km) south of the southern tip of Baja California. Tropical Storm Blanca experienced limited development, reaching its peak windspeed of 60 mph (95 km/h) early on June 20. Then, the center of Blanca became exposed again and weakened into a tropical depression on June 21. Finally, it dissipated on June 22 over colder waters about 1285.9 miles (2,380 km) southwest of the southern tip of Baja California. There were no casualties or damages attributed to this tropical cyclone.\n\nA tropical wave left the African coast on June 4 showing some cyclonic curvature in the low clouds. It passed Barbados six days later, where a low-to-mid wind shift was detected. The wave was followed by a low level wind surge which was observed in Curaçao on June 12. Most of the shower activity associated with the wave moved westward over South America, and then over Panama on June 14. The convection became organized and developed into Tropical Depression Three-E on June 16 while it was located 348 miles (560 km) south of Salina Cruz. It became a tropical storm one day later. Carlos reached minimal hurricane strength on June 18. Two days later, Carlos was briefly downgraded to tropical storm status. A strong high pressure system forced Carlos to move over warmer waters and Carlos began to reintensify. Carlos regained hurricane status and developed a well-defined eye and excellent upper level outflow. On June 24, Carlos peaked at central pressure and 115 mph (185 km/h) maximum sustained winds. The hurricane then weakened when it moved west over colder waters and encountered upper level shear. Carlos dissipated on June 27. The National Hurricane Center received no reports of impact due to this tropical cyclone.\n\nDelores developed from a tropical wave which moved from Africa to the Atlantic on June 7. And it was not until June 22 when it gained organization and was identified as an area of disturbed weather south of Mexico.\n\nThe system immediately showed signs of rotation and it was designated Tropical Depression Four-E the same day. It was centered about south-southeast of Manzanillo, Mexico. Then, the depression reached storm strength, and was named Delores on June 24 while 143 miles (230 km) from the coast of Mexico. It rapidly intensified to a hurricane on June 25 as it approached to the coast. However it rapidly weakened and on June 27 it was downgraded to tropical storm status as it was moving over colder waters. Its deep convection gradually diminished and its west-northwestward motion abruptly halted as the system was being sheared. It weakened to a depression on June 28 near Socorro Island and it dissipated on June 29.\n\nIn response to Delores' approach, the Mexican government issued a tropical storm warning and a hurricane watch from Ixtapa to Manzanillo on June 24. The watch and the warning were dropped the next day. The cyclone remained far away enough that no reports of high winds were received. Satellite observations indicated that heavy rains fell in affected areas from June 23 to 26. However, no damages or casualties were reported.\n\nA tropical disturbance south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec became better organized on June 29 and became a tropical depression. Strengthening was very limited as the depression was approaching to land. It made landfall later that day very near of Salina Cruz, Oaxaca. As it continued its west-northwest track, it dissipated inland after bringing torrential rains.\n\nFive-E caused the year's lone fatality and caused the most significant damage. Five-E destroyed up to 118 homes, injured 500, and also caused two people to go missing. Rainfall totals as high as in 24 hours accompanied the depression over Mexico.\n\nEnrique formed from a westward-moving tropical wave that crossed the Atlantic from June 30 to July 8. A short-lived cyclonic circulation center within the wave was detected on satellite imagery when the system was over the eastern Atlantic. However, persistent deep convection did not occur until the wave neared the Gulf of Tehuantepec in the eastern Pacific Ocean on July 11. On July 12, the convection became more concentrated about south of Acapulco, near a mid-level vortex within the wave; however, it had diminished the next day. On July 14 it became better organized. Based on reports from satellite imagery the low had developed into the seasons season's sixth tropical depression on July 15. The depression intensified further and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Enrique the next day as it became better organized.\n\nEnrique steadily intensified and by early on July 16, the National Hurricane Center was anticipating for the system to reach hurricane intensity. Continuing to strengthen, it reached hurricane status On July 17. However, this was for a short period of time as it developed an eye. Due to uncertainty in the storm's intensity that day, it is possible that it could have been a hurricane earlier than originally estimated. Wind shear associated with a trough and passage over cooler waters caused Enrique to begin weakening and the cyclone center soon became exposed. Enrique was downgraded to a depression on July 19 and the weakening cyclone crossed into the central Pacific on July 20. The system persisted drifting northwestward for several days, while maintaining a well-defined, albeit weak, center of circulation. On July 27, after it passed well to the north of the Hawaiian Islands, Enrique managed to briefly re-intensify to tropical storm status, attaining a secondary peak intensity of 50 mph (85 km/h), while completing a clockwise loop. As Enrique headed toward the Midway Island, increased wind shear weakened the system, causing another downgrade to depression status. As the storm approached the International Dateline, the system started to restrengthen. Shortly after crossing the dateline, Enrique became a tropical storm again on August 1. It lasted for less than 24 hours before it lost its convection and thus the cyclone began to dissipate. No damages or casualties were caused by Enrique.\nA tropical wave became better organized and it developed into Tropical Depression Seven-E while 976 miles (1570 km) south-southeast of Cabo San Lucas on July 29. The depression intensified quickly and became Tropical Storm Fefa the same day. Fefa continued to strengthen over the warm Pacific water and reached hurricane status on July 31. Satellite imagery showed the appearance of an eye on August 1. Fefa peaked on August 2 with a central pressure of and winds of 120 mph (195 km/h), making it a Category 3 hurricane in the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Fefa crossed into the north central Pacific basin on August 5. As it crossed, wind shear increased and Fefa began to weaken as it approached the Hawaiian Islands as a tropical storm on August 7. Fefa passed over the Big Island and rapidly weakened back to a tropical depression later that day. It finally dissipated on August 9 when northwest Kauai.\n\nThe remnants of Fefa caused heavy rains and strong winds in the counties of Hawaii and Kauai. Flash flooding was reported in the Kohala and Hamakua districts. Lightning injured two persons on the Big Island.\n\nA significant tropical wave with very little deep convection left Africa on July 22. It crossed the Atlantic, with convection associated with its southern part passing over the Windward Islands on July 28 and crossing Central America on July 31.\n\nSigns of organization were evident late on August 2 when the wave was south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. Then, on August 4, Tropical Depression Eight-E was formed while centered 348 miles (560 km) south-southeast of Acapulco. Despite the presence of easterly shear, the depression gradually intensified as the center moved toward the west-northwest, paralleling the coast of Mexico. Then, it reached tropical storm strength the same day. At that time, it was centered south-southwest of Acapulco. It peaked on August 5 with a central pressure of and maximum sustained winds of while of Manzanillo, Colima.\nAfter its peak, Guillermo weakened to tropical storm status as it began losing convection. It subsequently weakened to a tropical depression and dissipated after that on August 10. There were no damages or casualties associated with this tropical cyclone.\n\nSatellite imagery showed a convective area with some cyclonic turning in connection with a tropical wave over Africa on July 22. The convection gradually diminished as the system moved west-southwest into the Atlantic. On July 31, the wave passed south of Trinidad, where a low-level wind shift was detected. For the next couple of days, this system passed over Venezuela and Colombia. Then it crossed into the Pacific basin. It was not until August 6, while it was south of Guatemala, when the convection became organized. Then, the wave strengthened into a tropical depression about 230 miles (370 km/h) south-southwest of Acapulco, on August 8. The system intensified further and became Tropical Storm Hilda August 9. The storm reached its peak intensity on August 11 with estimated maximum winds and a pressure of . The tropical storm moved on a general west-northwest track for the next couple of days and then turned toward the north on August 13 as it was under the influence of an upper level trough. Later on that day, tropical storm force winds were reported on Guadalupe Island as the center of Hilda was located about 150 nautical miles (280 km) from the island.\n\nHilda gradually weakened over cool waters but maintained a rather large level of circulation. This caused its dissipation to be slower than normal. Tropical Depression Hilda dissipated on August 14. It large remnant circulation continued northwards and eventually passed over California. There were no casualties or damages attributed to this tropical cyclone. Hilda's remnants caused rain as far north as San Francisco.\n\nA tropical disturbance southwest of Manzanillo, Colima became a tropical depression on September 12 when its convection became persistent around a newly formed center of circulation. Conditions were not favorable for development because of strong wind shear environment caused by a trough. The depression took a northward track and dissipates on September 13 as it was being sheared just south of the Gulf of California.\n\nTropical Depression Ten-E brought heavy showers to parts of Mexico. There were no reported deaths or damages.\nOn September 11, a tropical wave entered the eastern Pacific. An area of convection developed when it was west of the southern tip of Baja California Peninsula. A trough axis extended southward from the low to the west of the convection. By September 15, the area of disturbed weather included some convective bands. The organization of the convection improved and the cloud system became Tropical Depression Eleven-E the next day. The trough that was near the depression moved the cyclone to the north-northwest and during that period it strengthened and became Tropical Storm Ignacio, all on the same day. With time, the influence of the trough over Tropical Storm Ignacio diminished. The track of the tropical storm transcribed a small clockwise loop, and Ignacio reached the northernmost point of the loop on September 17. The storm was centered about 28 miles (45 km) offshore and was near its peak intensity, . Further intensification was precluded by the storm's proximity to land and by shear associated with the upper level low near the Baja California peninsula. As Ignacio turned toward the east, its forward motion slowed. When the storm began moving to the south, it lost its identity very rapidly. Ignacio weakened to depression status and dissipated six hours later. The remnants of Ignacio moved toward the west-southwest over the next two days.\n\nWhen Ignacio was closely approaching the coast of Mexico, a tropical storm warning was issued from Zihuatenajo to Cuyutan on September 16. When Ignacio was forecast to move up the coast, the warnings were extended to Cabo Corrientes on September 17. The warnings were dropped when the cyclone dissipated. Ignacio caused street flooding in Acapulco. Forty people were injured, but no further casualties or damage were reported. Rain fell over a large area of Mexico. The highest amount recorded was at Pasa de San Antonio.\n\nPart of the same tropical wave that formed Tropical Storm Danny in the Atlantic crossed over the Isthmus of Panama and became a disturbance in the Intertropical Convergence Zone during mid to late September. On September 20 the cloud pattern had increased in organization and the system was designated a tropical depression.\n\nContinuing to strengthen, the depression became a tropical storm on September 21. The tropical storm then headed towards the northwest. Development was rapid, especially after September 22 as a banding type eye was forming. Further rapid development took place by the following day and the maximum sustained winds increased to near by the afternoon of September 23. Later, on September 24, Jimena reached its peak with maximum winds of and a minimum central pressure of . Jimena maintained itself as a powerful hurricane for three days, moving west until September 26, when it turned toward the west-northwest. Jimena began to weaken on September 27. A northwestward movement commenced on September 29 in response to a large upper level trough which developed in its northwest. It continued to weaken and on September 30 it regained tropical storm intensity before becoming downgraded to a depression. On October 2, Jimena dissipated as a tropical cyclone. Hurricane Jimena caused no reported damage or casualties.\n\nKevin formed from a westward-moving tropical wave which emerged from the northwest coast of Africa on September 11. The wave crossed into the Pacific basin on September 21 with no signs of development. Cloudiness and convection became better organized on the first hours of September 24, becoming Tropical Depression Thirteen-E the next day as it was located about southeast of Acapulco. Then the depression moved toward the west. The banding pattern became more pronounced and the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Kevin later that day, being centered about 316 miles (509 km) south-southeast of Acapulco. The convective banding increased for the next 24 hours and Kevin strengthened to hurricane status on September 26, while south-southwest of Acapulco. Kevin continued to strengthen and an eye intermittently appeared on September 27 and 28.\n\nBy September 29, Kevin had a well-defined eye and this feature persisted for several days. The hurricane continued to strengthen and on October 1 reached its peak intensity while centered south-southwest of the southern tip of Baja California, with estimated maximum winds and a minimum pressure of . Kevin was moving toward the west at this time. It turned toward the west-southwest due to a strong high pressure system located northwest of the hurricane. Then, Kevin began to weaken gradually and its eye became poorly defined on October 4. It weakened on October 6 as the hurricane began turning toward the northwest and continued this general motion for the next few days.\n\nHowever, a well-defined eye reappeared in the system and Kevin re-intensified to a low-end Category 3 hurricane with maximum winds of and a minimum pressure of on October 7. But this was short-lived and on October 8 the hurricane began to weaken again and on October 9 it had entered into the Central Pacific basin as a waning Category 1 hurricane. After this crossing, it was subsequently downgraded to storm strength the same day and on October 11, to a depression. It dissipated as a tropical cyclone that same day. The remnant circulation did persist a while longer as it slowly drifted north to finally lose its identity late on October 14. Despite its long life, Hurricane Kevin caused no damage or casualties. Because Kevin passed north of Hawaii, its only effect on land was increased trade winds.\n\nThe tropical wave that ultimately produced Hurricane Linda emerged from the northwest coast of Africa on September 16 and tracked westward across the tropical Atlantic. The convection increased markedly upon approaching the Lesser Antilles on September 21. The tropical wave's northern portion split off to the north and caused showers in Jamaica, the Bahamas and Cuba while the southern part continued and crossed Panama into the Pacific basin on September 25 as a group of disorganized cloud clusters. It took many days to organize and it was not until October 3 when organization improved and the wave became Tropical Depression Fourteen-E.\n\nThe tropical depression moved toward the northwest while strengthening and became Tropical Storm Linda within 12 hours. As Linda then drifted to the north it was upgraded to a hurricane on October 5. Then, the hurricane reached its estimated peak intensity of and a minimum central pressure of that same day. Linda began to weaken as it was following Kevin's track and entered to colder waters. Linda turned the west-northwest and passed from Socorro Island, where it caused sustained winds on October 7. Later that day, Linda weakened to a tropical storm. On October 9, as Linda was following Kevin's track, the cyclone continued to weaken and was downgraded to a depression, although deep convection continued to intermittently appear. Finally, on early October 14, Linda dissipated. There were no reported casualties or damages from Linda.\n\nOn October 5, a tropical wave crossed Central America and it began to organize the next day. Based on satellite classifications, the weather system was upgraded to tropical depression status about south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec on October 7. It became a tropical storm on October 8 and was named Marty. It reached hurricane status early on October 10 while moving parallel to the coast of Mexico. There were several occasions when an eye was becoming apparent in satellite imagery but it never fully developed. An upper trough over the Western United States forced Marty to moved toward the northwest and north for a while, bringing the hurricane to waters previously cooled by hurricanes Kevin and Linda. Then, Marty disorganized and weakened into a tropical storm. Also, the trough which forced Marty northward moved out of the area, which made that Marty turned sharply to the west, then west-southwest around a high pressure system. Marty weakened further and remained as a tropical depression. It finally dissipated on October 18.\n\nOn October 8, Marty was threatening enough to prompt the Mexican government to issue a tropical storm watch from Manzanillo to Acapulco. The warning was dropped on October 9 when Marty moved away. There were no associated casualties or damages with this tropical cyclone.\nOn November 7, an area of convection associated with a tropical wave developed into a tropical depression, while located about to the southeast of Acapulco, Mexico. During that day the depression moved towards the northwest, intensified into a tropical storm and was named Nora later that day. During the next day, the storm gradually intensified further while temporarily moving towards the west, due to the flow field around a strengthening high pressure system located to the north of Nora. During November 9, the NHC noted that Nora had developed an eye, before reporting that the system had developed into a category one hurricane.\n\nOn November 9, Nora. It peaked as a Category 2 hurricane on November 10. A large trough moved in from the west and formed a low. Shear increased and disrupted Nora's convection. The low also caused an abrupt change of course to the northeast. Nora weakened to a depression on November 11 and dissipated the next day. Nora's remnants continued to the northeast, showing brief flare-ups of convection. No deaths or damage were reported to have occurred in association with Nora, despite probable rainfall totals of around within the Mexican states of Sinaloa and Nayarit.\n\nThe following names were used for named storms that formed in the eastern Pacific in 1991. Names that were not assigned are marked in gray. The names not retired from this list were used again in the 1997 season. This is the same list used for the 1985 season. Also, the name \"Dolores\" was misspelled \"Delores\" in this season; however in subsequent seasons, the typo was corrected.\n\n† – The initial spelling is \"Dolores\", however the name \"Delores\" was used this season.\n\nFor storms that form in the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility, encompassing the area between 140 degrees west and the International Date Line, all names are used in a series of four rotating lists. The next four names that were slated for use in 1991 are shown below, however none of them were used.\n\nThe World Meteorological Organization retired one name in the spring of 1992: Fefa. It was replaced in the 1997 season by Felicia.\n\nThis is a table of all the storms that have formed in the 1991 Pacific hurricane season. It includes their duration, names, landfall(s), denoted in parentheses, damages, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all the damage figures are in 1991 USD.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2187737", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2187737", "title": "Sunset Las Palmas Studios", "text": "Sunset Las Palmas Studios\n\nSunset Las Palmas Studios, located at 1040 N. Las Palmas Avenue in Hollywood, California, is an independent production lot providing stages and related services to television, movie and commercial production companies. Founded in 1919, the lot is one of the oldest production facilities in Hollywood and has played host to many notable productions, including such television shows as \"The Burns and Allen Show\", \"I Love Lucy\", \"The Addams Family\", seasons 2-10 of \"Jeopardy!\" (1985-1994), \"The Rockford Files\", The Keenen Ivory Wayans Show, \"MADtv\", and \"The Suite Life on Deck\", \"RuPaul's Drag Race\" and \"Raven's Home\", as well as such movie productions as \"When Harry Met Sally...\" and \"The Player\". It was previously known as Hollywood Center Studios.\n\nSunset Las Palmas Studios continues to provide stage facilities for many television productions, including shows produced by Disney, NBC, Comedy Central and MTV. The lot features 12 sound stages, ranging in size from 4,400 square feet to 19,000 square feet, several of which are able to accommodate live audiences, as well as a virtual set stage for webcasts.\n\nIn 1919, John Jasper, a former associate of Charlie Chaplin, built exterior sets, three production stages and several bungalows on a 16.5 acre site in Hollywood and named it Hollywood Studios Inc. The first stages resembled hot houses with steel frames, cloth walls, glass roofs and clerestory windows. Outdoor sets included an \"Americana\" residential street, a massive New York street, and an elegant Spanish villa. Among the first tenants was comedian Harold Lloyd who produced some of his most successful films on the lot.\n\nThe lot changed ownership and name several times during its early years while continuing to evolve and grow. In 1926, the then Metropolitan Studios began construction of one of the industry's first sound stages. A few years later, Howard Hughes took up residence on the lot and used it to shoot his World War I epic \"Hell's Angels\" (1930), known for its innovative use of sound and for the screen debut of Jean Harlow.\n\nScores of films were produced on the lot during the 1930s and 1940s. They included the Mae West vehicles \"Klondike Annie\" and \"Go West, Young Man\" (both 1936), the 21-picture \"Hopalong Cassidy\" series, the Bing Crosby classic \"Pennies from Heaven\" (1936) and the Marx Brothers’ \"A Night in Casablanca\" (1946). Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy, Fred Astaire, Cary Grant, Glenn Ford, Fredric March and Erich von Stroheim were among the stars who worked on the lot in the pre-World War II years. James Cagney made several films on the lot at a time when his brother William was a part owner.\n\nWith the advent of television, production on the lot changed dramatically. In 1951, the lot made history when Stage 2 became home to \"I Love Lucy\", the first prime-time comedy shot on film and produced before a live audience originating from the West Coast.\n\nFrom 1951 to 1953, it was the home of Desilu Productions, owned by Lucille Ball and her husband Desi Arnaz. The television version of actress Eve Arden's radio series \"Our Miss Brooks\" produced its first season on the stage adjacent to \"I Love Lucy\". Both stages were known as the Desilu Playhouse seeing that a common entrance had been created at the rear of each sound stage. After the second season of \"I Love Lucy\", Desilu moved to what is currently Red Studios Hollywood. \"Our Miss Brooks\" and other Desilu produced and filmed series moved with them.\n\nThe floodgates soon opened and the lot became ground zero for television’s Golden Age. In the 1950s, General Service was the home of George Burns's McCadden Corporation (\"The Burns and Allen Show\", \"The Bob Cummings Show\", \"Panic\", and \"The People's Choice\"); Ozzie Nelson's Stage Five Productions (\"The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet\") and Jack Chertok Productions (\"Private Secretary\"). It later hosted a number of classic CBS comedies including \"Petticoat Junction\", \"Green Acres\" and \"The Beverly Hillbillies\". \"The Lone Ranger\", \"Perry Mason\", \"Mr. Ed\", \"The Addams Family\" and \"Get Smart\" were also produced on the lot. George Burns maintained his office on the lot until his death.\n\nIn 1980, director Francis Ford Coppola purchased the lot, intending to use it to produce a slate of films. Among them was the ambitious movie musical \"One from the Heart\". For that film, Coppola transformed the entire lot into a giant set that included a replica of part of Las Vegas’ McCarran Airport. During this time Mel Brooks's Brooksfilms also rented a stage on the lot to film \"Frances\", starring Jessica Lange. Cost overruns on \"One From the Heart\" combined with its poor box-office performance caused Coppola to fall into financial difficulties and the lot was sold again, this time to Canadian real estate developers, the Singer Family.\n\nThe Singers initiated a comprehensive modernization and refurbishing effort that sparked a revival of the lot’s fortunes and attracted a new generation of feature film and commercial filmmakers. The Singers also returned television production to the lot by adding control rooms and the infrastructure required for multi-camera video production. The lot again became home to some of the country’s most popular shows, including \"Jeopardy!\" (seasons 2-10), \"Star Search\", \"Soul Train\", \"The Man Show\", and \"Pee-wee's Playhouse\".\n\nIn a multimillion-dollar investment, the lot’s control rooms, camera packages and infrastructure were upgraded to HDTV. This was done to support television clients such as Disney Channel, which produced a number of original series under their It's a Laugh Productions banner for Disney Channel and Disney XD lot. Three cyc stages were added, one dedicated to green screen production. A virtual set stage was also built to provide a cost-effective way to produce high-quality content for broadcast and the web. Additionally, production office space more than doubled, providing homes for independent companies.\n\nIn May, 2017, a Los Angeles based real estate company, Hudson Pacific Properties Inc., purchased Hollywood Center Studios from the Singer family for $200 million, then immediately renamed the property as the \"Sunset Las Palmas Studios.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "2187753", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2187753", "title": "1990 Pacific hurricane season", "text": "1990 Pacific hurricane season\n\nThe 1990 Pacific hurricane season was a very active season which observed 21 named storms within the basin. The season also produced the fourth highest ACE index value on record. The season was officially started on May 15 in the eastern Pacific, and on June 1 in the central Pacific, and lasted until November 30. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. However, these bounds were slightly exceeded when Hurricane Alma formed on May 12.\n\nHurricane Alma became the third earliest tropical cyclone in the Eastern Pacific basin since the satellite era began in 1966, while Trudy is the third strongest October eastern Pacific hurricane on record. Overall, the impact of this season was minimal. Tropical Storm Rachel made two landfalls in Mexico and brought rain to the United States. Hurricane Boris brought light showers to California.\n\nThe 1990 eastern North Pacific hurricane season was active in terms of number of storms that attained at least tropical storm intensity and of Accumulated Cyclone Energy. All of the tropical cyclones of this year developed from westward-moving African tropical waves. The season established several tropical storm records for this basin and was marked by several strong hurricanes. There were 21 named tropical cyclones, seven below the record established by the 1992 Pacific hurricane season two years later, but four more than the long-term average. Sixteen of those named storms, twice the average and four more than the previous record, reached hurricane intensity. Only Cristina, Douglas, Aka, Rachel, and Simon did not reach hurricane strength. Six of those hurricanes reached Category 3 intensity or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Hurricanes Hernan and Trudy were among the strongest ever observed in this area. Alma became the earliest named tropical cyclone for the eastern Pacific ocean east of the 140th meridian west. The eastern Pacific produced four tropical depressions that did not reach tropical storm status.\n\nWith the exception of Marie and Polo, these systems developed between 5° and 15°N, east of the longitude of Baja California in the climatologically favored area for tropical cyclogenesis. After their development, most of the tropical cyclones moved on a west to northwest track and dissipated over cool waters without affecting land. Rachel was the only system to make landfall. In addition, one tropical storm formed in the Central Pacific and eventually crossed the International Dateline before dissipating.\n\nAccumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. ACE is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34 knots (39 mph, 63 km/h) or tropical storm strength. The cumulative ACE for the Eastern Pacific this season fell within the official \"Above Normal\" grading, being one of the most active. This occurred because the season had many intense storms that lasted for a long period of time. Also it is important to note that this is the fourth highest ACE, only behind the 1992, 2015 and 2018 seasons respectively.\n\nA tropical wave emerged from Africa on April 29. It then moved across the Atlantic, crossed northern South America, and entered the Pacific Ocean on May 9. Convection started to increase with the wave just to the south of Panama. The wave moved westward and continued to become better organized over the next few days. On May 12, the wave had become organized enough and was designated Tropical Depression One-E.\n\nTropical Depression One-E moved slowly to the northwest while strengthening slowly due to easterly vertical wind shear. The depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Alma on May 14. The storm quickly strengthened once the vertical wind shear relaxed and was near hurricane force by the morning of May 15. Hurricane Alma reached its peak intensity early on May 16 with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph (135 km/h). The hurricane entered an area of southwesterly wind shear caused by an upper-level ridge of high pressure. The increasing vertical wind shear and cooler water caused Alma to weaken to a tropical storm. On May 17, the storm continued to weaken and became a depression. The next day, the system dissipated as a tropical cyclone well west of mainland Mexico. Alma was the earliest named storm and hurricane in the satellite era in the east Pacific proper at the time; the storm was subsequently eclipsed by Adrian in 2017.\n\nA tropical wave came off the northwest coast of Africa on May 20. The wave did not significantly develop as it moved west across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea. Once it crossed Central America into the eastern Pacific Ocean, cloudiness increased considerably with the system on May 31. It became well-enough organized to be upgraded to Tropical Depression Two-E on June 2. After becoming a depression, the system moved to the west-northwestward. Upper-level easterly vertical wind shear limited the amount of the initial strengthening. However, an increase in convective banding led to its upgrade to Tropical Storm Boris on June 4, southwest of Manzanillo. Further strengthening occurred due to an anticyclone aloft fostered additional development, and by June 5, Boris became a hurricane. The hurricane began to move to the north-northwest in response to a trough off of the West Coast of the United States. Strengthening continued, and the storm reached its peak strength with winds of and a minimum central pressure of . The hurricane's cloud pattern became elongated along a southwest-northeast axis on June 6 due to an increased amount of vertical wind shear. Boris was downgraded to a tropical storm later in the day on June 6. The deep convection of the tropical storm decreased, as Boris moved over cooler waters. It was downgraded to a tropical depression on June 7 due to these factors. The depression dissipated as a tropical cyclone on June 8 as the system quickly lost its tropical characteristics. A small circulation remained in the cloud field offshore the northwest coast of Baja California for a few more days.\n\nThe winds in the eyewall of Boris ripped off the sails of the Azure Dream sailboat. Outer rainbands from the storm produced moderate rain in several Mexican states. In Mexico, rainfall peaked at near San Lucas, Michoacán. The remnants of Boris also brought sporadic rainfall over the western United States, with precipitation being reported in Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada and Wyoming. The remnants of Boris were responsible for causing the wettest June in San Diego since records began in 1850; however, not even of rain fell at that location. Rainfall from the remnant system in the United States peaked at over the Santa Rita Mountains. No other direct damages or casualties were reported from Boris.\n\nA tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Africa on May 28. The wave moved across Central America into the northeastern Pacific Ocean, where convection organized with the system on June 6. The system became well-enough organized to be upgraded to Tropical Depression Three-E on June 8, while south of the southern tip of Baja California. The depression continued to strengthen, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Cristina on June 9.\n\nCristina initially had well-established upper-level outflow. It failed to reach hurricane status, peaking with maximum sustained winds of due to movement of its associated upper-level anticyclone to the north over Mexico which caused Cristina to be exposed to easterly vertical wind shear. Cristina moved generally northwestward, which eventually placed the storm in cooler waters, and caused the deep convection of the system to dissipate. On June 14, Cristina diminished to a tropical depression. Cristina moved west-northwestward with the low-level flow. The depression dissipated as a tropical cyclone on June 16, after a lack of deep convection for 48 hours.\n\nA tropical wave moved off the northwest coast of Africa on June 5. It continued westward across the tropical North Atlantic and Caribbean Sea without significant development. The wave entered the northeastern Pacific Ocean on June 16, where it generated an area of increased cloudiness. Organization of thunderstorm activity increased late on June 18 and early on June 19. Tropical Depression Four-E formed on June 19, when it was south of Acapulco, Mexico after evidence of low-level circulation for the past 24 hours. The depression moved in a west-northwest direction, due to a subtropical ridge north of the depression. Satellite analysis indicated that the depression had reached tropical storm force strength, and it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Douglas on June 19, while southwest of Acapulco. Douglas reached peak strength of on June 21\n\nA tropical storm warning was issued on June 21, from Punta Tejupan to Cabo Corrientes before being discontinued on June 22. Tropical Storm Douglas brushed the western coast of Mexico. The center of circulation approached within of the coast of Mexico on June 22. Douglas then began to weaken because of interaction with the mountainous terrain of Mexico. The system continued to weaken despite warm water temperatures and favorable upper-level conditions. Douglas dissipated early on June 24, while south-southeast off the southern tip of Baja California. The highest rainfall report from Mexico from Douglas totaled at La Huerta. No deaths or damage were reported.\n\nA tropical wave came off the coast of Africa into the eastern Atlantic Ocean on June 10 and 11. The system moved across the Atlantic and entered into the northeastern Pacific Ocean. The wave became a significant tropical system, with cyclonic turning in the lower and middle layers of the system's cloudiness on June 25. The center of circulation was located south of Acapulco, Mexico. The system exhibited sufficient organization to be considered Tropical Depression Five-E on June 26. The depression quickly strengthened and became Tropical Storm Elida later that day. The track of Elida was west-northwestward to northwestward from June 27 through June 28. Some rainbands moved over the mountainous region of southwestern Mexico, but no flooding, damage, or casualties were reported as a result. Elida continued strengthening and it was upgraded to a hurricane early on June 28 passing directly over Socorro Island later in the day, right as Elida reached peak strength of , dropping of rain on the island. Some windows broke also as a result, and minor structural damage was reported as a result on the island.\n\nA high-pressure area to the north forced Elida to move more westward on June 29. Convection began to decrease in the hurricane as it moved into cooler waters, and it weakened to a tropical storm later in the day. It then weakened to a tropical depression on July 1, and dissipated on July 2.\n\nAn area of disturbed weather south of Acapulco organized into Tropical Depression Six-E on June 29 and the system began to move northwest. Originally the system was expected to reach tropical storm strength and near hurricane intensity by late on July 2 or early on July 3, however persistent vertical wind shear over the system impeded its development. After convection began to merge into the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), the National Hurricane Center discontinued advisories on Tropical Depression Six-E, stating that the depression dissipated, and regeneration seemed unlikely.\n\nHowever, wind shear began to decrease, and convection associated with the remnants of Tropical Depression Six-E quickly began to increase. Although the low-level circulation was near the edge of the deep convection, the National Hurricane Center resumed advisories on Tropical Depression Six-E by July 1. Intensification into a tropical storm was again predicted, but Tropical Depression Six-E remained poorly defined, and eventually dissipated on July 4. \n\nA tropical wave came off the northwest coast of Africa on June 19. The wave crossed the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea, into the warm waters of the northeastern Pacific Ocean, on July 2. An area of disturbed weather moved northwards towards the Gulf of Tehuantepec and became Tropical Depression Seven-E early on July 6. The depression moved northwest, and because of increased organization of deep convection, was designated Tropical Storm Fausto on July 7, south of Manzanillo, Mexico. A weakly defined eye formed on July 8, and the storm was upgraded to Hurricane Fausto, south of Cabo San Lucas.\n\nFausto peaked in strength with winds of 85 mph (140 km/h) and a central pressure of on July 9. Fausto passed 40 mi (60 km) north of Socorro Island causing a northwest wind of 40 mph (60 km/h), and of rain at that location. The hurricane fluctuated in intensity on July 10, before weakening into a tropical storm later that day, west of Cabo San Lucas. The weakening Fausto moved over continuing cooler waters, and was downgraded to a tropical depression on July 11, west of Cabo San Lucas. The depression dissipated as a tropical cyclone on July 13, and its low level circulation of clouds persisted for a few days.\n\nA tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on June 25 and moved across the Atlantic Ocean and central Caribbean Sea with little development. Within the western Caribbean Sea, convection developed with the wave on July 7. The system became better organized as it moved into the northeastern Pacific Ocean. The system was upgraded to Tropical Depression Eight-E on July 11. The depression moved west-northwest, with a good outflow to the north, and gradually strengthened into Tropical Storm Genevieve later that day. Genevieve continued to strengthen, reaching hurricane strength on July 13. The storm approached within of Socorro Island where a sustained wind of and gust of were reported, before the weather equipment on the island failed.\n\nThe hurricane began to turn west because of the strengthening and growing ridge to its north. Increasing outflow aloft began to form, and the hurricane reached its peak strength of 105 mph (170 km/h) with a well-defined eye at its center of circulation. Genevieve turned northwest on July 16 into an area with strong vertical wind shear and low water temperatures. The hurricane quickly weakened into a tropical storm on July 17 and then into a tropical depression on July 18. Genevieve dissipated as a tropical cyclone later in the day, reduced to a circulation in the stratocumulus cloud field.\n\nA tropical wave that moved off the northwest coast of Africa on July 4 passed through the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea without significant development. The wave moved across Central America into the northeastern Pacific Ocean on July 15. Thunderstorm activity increased in the system between July 16 and 18 before rainbands became present within the tropical disturbance on July 19. Tropical Depression Nine-E formed later that day while 565 mi (910 km) southwest of Acapulco, Mexico.\n\nTropical Depression Nine-E strengthened into Tropical Storm Hernan on July 21 while 684 mi (1,100 km) south of Cabo San Lucas. The tropical storm continued to strengthen and as it moved to the northwest, and became a hurricane late on July 21. Hernan continued to strengthen and as it passed 145 mi (230 km) southwest of Clarion Island. On July 23, Hernan reached its peak strength of 155 mph (250 km/h) and minimum pressure of as the center of circulation was 207 mi (335 km) south-southwest of Clarion Island. On July 24, concentric eyewalls (one eyewall located inside another) formed around the center of Hernan, which was the first time this pattern had been observed with an eastern Pacific hurricane.\n\nHernan kept Category 4 hurricane intensity a few more days and hurricane strength for six days overall. The hurricane weakened into a tropical storm on July 28 as it moved over cooler waters. Hernan turned more to the west as its low level center became separated from its thunderstorm activity and was steering by a surface high-pressure system to its north. Hernan moved over cooler waters, dissipating as a tropical cyclone early on July 31.\n\nA tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on July 7. The wave moved west, but it was not until it moved across the Caribbean Sea that the wave's convection organized. The system entered into the northeastern Pacific Ocean with concentrated convection and a surface center of circulation while southeast of Acapulco. Moving west-northwest, Tropical Depression Ten-E formed on July 20 south of Puerto Ángel, Mexico. Early on the following day, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Iselle. The storm continued strengthening while in the proximity of Hurricane Hernan, becoming a hurricane on July 22.\n\nThe hurricane continued to move west-northwest through its duration, and reached its peak strength of on July 25. Iselle crossed Socorro Island, which recorded a sustained wind and heavy rain on July 25. The hurricane weakened on following days after it moved over cooler waters, downgraded to a tropical storm on July 28 and subsequently into a tropical depression on July 30. The depression dissipated later that day, after losing its low-level circulation southwest of San Diego.\n\nOn July 24 a tropical disturbance behind Hurricane Hernan strengthened into a tropical depression. Due to the close proximity of Hernan to its west, the development of the depression was hindered due to vertical wind shear from the outflow of Hernan. This wind shear dissipated the depression on July 26, and its remnants were absorbed by the nearby cyclone. No damages or casualties were caused by the depression as it was well out to sea.\n\nTropical Storm Aka was the only tropical storm to form in the Central North Pacific during 1990. An area of disturbed weather began to organize on August 6. By August 7, the system became well-enough organized to become designated Tropical depression One-C. The depression intensified into a tropical storm while moving west, to the south of the Hawaiian Islands. On August 10, Tropical Storm Aka peaked with maximum sustained winds of . The storm continued to move west and approached Johnston Island, though the island's weather did not deteriorate. The tropical storm crossed the International Date Line on August 13. Aka weakened back into a depression and dissipated two days later on August 15.\nHurricane Diana struck eastern Mexico and managed to hold together, remaining a tropical depression as it entered the eastern Pacific Ocean late on August 8. Although Tropical Depression Diana entered the eastern Pacific, the National Hurricane Center did not re-classify the system. No re-intensification occurred after the system entered the eastern Pacific, and it had dissipated as a tropical cyclone by the following day. The remnant tropical disturbance recurved through the Gulf of California while developing significant convection before it moved into northwest Mexico, which brought rainfall amounts of over to local areas within the state of Sonora. The remnant disturbance moved into the American Southwest on August 11.\n\nTropical Depression Two-C was the second and last tropical cyclone to develop within the north-central Pacific Ocean in 1990. The depression developed from a tropical disturbance well southeast of Hawaii, which became much better organized on the night of August 10. The tropical depression moved in a west northwest direction for the next 18 hours and then changed to a west-southwest track on August 11. As it turned more to the southwest, the depression weakened until it dissipated on August 13 about south-southeast of Hilo, Hawaii.\n\nA persistent area of thunderstorm activity southwest of Puerto Vallarta became better organized and strengthened into Tropical Depression Twelve-E on August 16. Moving northwest, the system developed slowly as it was embedded within the Intertropical Convergence Zone. Easterly shear kept the system from reaching tropical storm strength and caused its ultimate dissipation on August 19. No damages or fatalities were caused by this depression.\n\nA tropical wave moved off the western coast of Africa on August 5, moving across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea without significant development. The system entered the northeastern Pacific Ocean, and became well-enough organized to be upgraded to Tropical Depression Thirteen-E on August 17 while centered south of Acapulco, Mexico. The depression moved on a west-northwestward track and strengthened, becoming Tropical Storm Julio on August 18. Strengthening continued and Julio reached hurricane strength on August 19. The cyclone peaked with maximum sustained winds of on August 21. The storm turned westward and began weakening. Julio regained tropical storm status on August 23 and tropical depression status on August 24 before dissipating as a tropical cyclone later that day. No damage was reported from Julio.\n\nA tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on August 9, and spawned Tropical Storm Fran four days later, before it moved through the southern Windward Islands on August 14. While Fran dissipated shortly after that, the tropical wave progressed into the northeastern Pacific Ocean. The wave spawned Tropical Depression Fourteen-E east-southeast of Hurricane Julio. The depression moved westward for the next several days. As Julio weakened, the depression began to increase in strength. It became Tropical Storm Kenna on August 22 and continued to strengthen into a hurricane on August 25, peaking with winds of the next day. On August 26, a strong frontal trough weakened the high pressure system to the storm's north, causing a turn to the north during the next few days. The hurricane weakened in response to cooler water and increasing vertical wind shear, which removed convection from its center. Kenna weakened back to tropical storm strength on August 28, then into a tropical depression on August 29. The system dissipated as a tropical cyclone on August 30.\n\nA tropical wave moved off the northwestern coast of Africa into the Atlantic Ocean on August 11. After moving across the Atlantic and Caribbean Sea without development, the system moved through the Intertropical Convergence Zone of the northeastern Pacific Ocean. The cloudiness moved northward toward the Gulf of Tehuantepec on August 22. The thunderstorm activity organized sufficiently for the system to be upgraded to Tropical Depression Fifteen-E on August 23 while southeast of Acapulco, Mexico. The depression moved west-northwestward and strengthened into a tropical storm 217 mi (350 km) south-southwest of Puerto Vallarta on August 25. The storm began to turn more westward due to a strengthening high pressure system to its north and was upgraded to a hurricane on August 27 while southwest of Cabo San Lucas. As the high to the north continued to strengthen, the hurricane turned west-southwest.\n\nThunderstorm activity with the hurricane began to weaken and Lowell was downgraded back to tropical storm status on August 28. The tropical storm then turned to a north-northwestward with the storm passing over cooler waters. On August 31, the storm was downgraded to a tropical depression, with only minimal amounts of deep convection remaining within its circulation. Lowell dissipated as a tropical cyclone on September 1, though a low-level circulation of clouds could be seen on satellite imagery for the next few days. No damage or casualties was reported as a result of Lowell.\n\nA tropical wave moved off the northwestern coast of Africa on August 16. The wave moved west through the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea without significant development. The wave moved across Central America and into the northeastern Pacific Ocean, on August 29. Isolated convection with the system increased while south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec as the system moved northwest parallel to the southwest coast of Mexico. Once convective activity increased, the system was upgraded to Tropical Depression Sixteen-E on September 7 while centered 659 mi (1,060 km) southwest of Clarion Island.\n\nA weaker than normal high pressure system controlled the movement of the depression, and the system moved slowly to the west through its duration. The depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Marie on September 8, and into a hurricane on September 9, while south-southwest of Clarion Island. Marie reached its peak intensity of on September 11. The hurricane crossed into the central North Pacific on September 14 as a hurricane with maximum sustained winds of . The hurricane weakened thereafter and on September 17 Marie regained tropical storm status. The system weakened into a tropical depression on September 19 and dissipated as a tropical cyclone on September 21 near the Hawaiian coast. No casualties or damages were caused by Marie.\n\nA tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa and across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea without significant development. The wave entered the northeastern Pacific Ocean and began to show signs of organized thunderstorm development. Tropical Depression Seventeen-E formed on September 10 while centered south-southwest of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. The depression became better organized and strengthened into Tropical Storm Norbert later in the day.\n\nOn September 12, Norbert absorbed Tropical Depression Eighteen-E which was in close proximity. Norbert strengthened as it moved north-northwestward. The tropical storm was upgraded to a hurricane on September 14, and formed an eye on September 15. The storm reached its peak strength of sustained winds that day. Turning north of due west, Norbert then weakened as it moved over cooler waters. It was downgraded to a tropical storm later on September 15, and then to a tropical depression on September 18. Norbert dissipated as a tropical cyclone on September 19 after losing all its deep convection.\n\nOn September 12, satellite images indicated that the eighteenth tropical depression of the season formed southwest of Cabo San Lucas. Located in close proximity to Tropical Storm Norbert, the depression would soon enter a region of colder sea surface temperatures, and the National Hurricane Center noted that only very little intensification was possible. As predicted, Norbert hindered further intensification of Tropical Depression Eighteen-E. The National Hurricane Center noted six hours later that the depression would likely be absorbed into Norbert. The National Hurricane Center later believed that Tropical Depression Eighteen-E was \"dominating\" the interaction between the two systems, and was forecast to absorb Norbert. Unlike the latter prediction, Norbert absorbed Tropical Depression Eighteen-E later that day.\n\nA tropical wave move off the coast of Africa on September 5, and crossed the Atlantic waters, the Caribbean Sea and eventually into the Pacific Ocean as a weak system. An area of convection entered into the northeastern Pacific Ocean a few hundred miles south of Acapulco, Mexico. On September 23, Tropical Depression Nineteen-E formed from this convection, while south-southeast from the southern tip of Baja California. The depression moved on a west-northwestward track, rounding the southwest side of a strong high pressure system. The depression continued to strengthen and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Odile on September 24 and into a hurricane on September 25. Its intensity peaked with maximum sustained winds of on September 26.\n\nThe hurricane began to turn more northwestward in response to a high-pressure system weakening to its north. Odile began to weaken as it moved over cooler waters on September 28. The cyclone regained tropical storm status on September 29 while it slowly progressed northward. The system weakened into a tropical depression status on September 30. Once it lost its deep convection, Odile was steered southwestward by the low-level flow, before it dissipated as a tropical cyclone on October 2. Its remaining low-level circulation of clouds continued on a southwestward course thereafter.\nIn mid-September, a weak tropical wave moved off the coast of Northwest Africa. It moved westward and entered the eastern Pacific Ocean early on September 23. Cloudiness became concentrated with the system south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. On September 27, the organized thunderstorm area was upgraded to Tropical Depression Twenty One-E while south of Acapulco. The depression developed slowly, and became a tropical storm on September 30. As Rachel briefly moved northward, before re-curving and accelerating towards the Mexican coast. The storm passed over the southern portion of Baja California Sur on October 2. Rachel made its final landfall midway between Los Mochis and Culiacán, and became the only system to make landfall from the eastern north Pacific Ocean in 1990. Rachel decayed rapidly over land, and the final public advisory on Rachel was issued early on October 3. its remnants continued accelerating over Texas until they lost their identity.\n\nThe highest rainfall total from the system in Mexico totaled at Santa Anita near the tip of Baja California. Across northern Mexico, thousands were homeless, and 18 people died. In Texas, Rachel's remnants caused heavy rain. Flooding occurred in the Big Bend area.\n\nPolo originated from a tropical wave that moved off the African coast on September 2 which spawned Hurricane Isidore in the Atlantic basin. On September 14, the system increased in convection as it was moving to the west and approaching Central America. The southern extent of the wave crossed into the Pacific Ocean on September 18.\n\nThe wave continued westward and related thunderstorm activity increased during the following week. The convective system organized into Tropical Depression Twenty-E on September 28 nearly midway between Mexico and Hawaii. Initially, the depression drifted toward the northwest due to a large upper-level trough located to its west. Polo strengthened rapidly into a hurricane early on September 30, with its winds peaking at . Since the storm was very small, vertical wind shear caused significant weakening thereafter. On October 1, Polo regained tropical storm strength as it was crossing into the north Central Pacific basin. It dissipated as a tropical cyclone later that day. There were no casualties or damages caused by Polo.\n\nA weakly defined tropical wave moved off the northwest coast of Africa on September 20, and crossed the northern portion of the tropical Atlantic and northern South America without significant organization. The wave moved into the northeastern Pacific waters, off the coast of Colombia on September 30. As the wave passed over southern Central America, rainbands and cloudiness increased with the system between October 1 and October 3, before the system merged with the ITCZ from October 4 to October 6. Signs of convective organization reappeared on October 8, and by October 9, the system was upgraded to Tropical Depression Twenty Two-E south of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico.\n\nThe depression continued to develop and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Simon on October 10 while south-southwest of Cabo San Lucas. Due to a high-pressure system to the north-northwest, Simon continued on a west-northwestward path. The tropical storm continued to strengthen to its peak intensity of by late on October 11. Simon passed over cooler waters and weakened back into a tropical depression on October 13. The depression moved on a westward course, and the low-level circulation was displaced from its deep convection during the following day. Simon then dissipated as a tropical cyclone early on October 15 across the open waters of the northeast Pacific.\n\nThe tropical wave that would become future Hurricane Trudy became identifiable on satellite imagery as early as September 30, emerging near the African coast off Cape Verde. However, the wave did not show any signs of development until October 16, when the wave developed into a tropical depression several hundred kilometers south of Acapulco. The tropical depression intensified significantly. The ship \"Maple Ace\" reported tropical storm-force winds about from the center at 1800 UTC on October 18. In less than 36 hours, at 1200 UTC on October 20, Trudy became a powerful hurricane with Category Four equivalent maximum winds of and a minimum pressure of according to satellite estimates. The hurricane was at least as intense as Hurricane Max three years earlier and Hurricane Hernan earlier in the year. Estimates state that Trudy may have been the strongest eastern Pacific hurricane since wind estimates have been available from satellite images.\n\nAn upper-level trough forced Trudy to move northwards, increasing the risk of hurricane conditions to Baja California residents. The same trough caused an unfavorable environment that caused Trudy to weaken considerably. At that time, dynamically based numeral models forecasted Trudy to move northwards over Baja California and make landfall there. Authorities closed five ports on Baja California and the Pacific Ocean port of Mazatlán on October 22 as Hurricane Trudy was approaching the Mexican coast with gusts of up to . However, the trough progressed eastwards and was replaced by a ridge, sparing a landfall, but still causing locally heavy rainfall and high waves. Socorro Island reported hurricane-force winds for more than 7 hours. Moving away from land, Trudy then started to re-intensify, developing an unusually large eye of nearly in diameter. However, another deep trough approached Trudy and pulled the hurricane northwards, shearing it at the same time. Trudy dissipated on November 1 at 1800 UTC. Its remnant moisture spread over parts of Mexico and the United States.\n\nTrudy is the fourth-strongest Pacific hurricane in October, behind Kenna of the 2002 season, Rick of the 2009 season, and Patricia of the 2015 season.\n\nAn area of disturbed weather, possibly related to a tropical wave, organized into Tropical Depression Twenty Four-E on October 21. It strengthened into Tropical Storm Vance early on October 23 and then into a hurricane two days later. Vance moved parallel to the west coast of Mexico and approached the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula. Before it could strike land, a high-pressure area blocked Vance's path and forced the storm to transcribe a small clockwise loop over a two-day period. During the loop, Vance encountered wind shear and cool waters stirred up by Trudy as well as earlier in its duration. Vance weakened to a tropical storm on October 27 and a depression on October 30. The cyclone dissipated late on October 31.\nThe following names were used for named storms that formed in the eastern Pacific in 1990. Names that were not assigned are marked in gray. Since no names were retired, no new names were replaced for the 1996 season. This same list was used in the 1984 season. \"Wallis\" would trade years with \"Winnie\" in future seasons.\n\nFor storms that form in the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility, encompassing the area between 140 degrees west and the International Date Line, all names are used in a series of four rotating lists. The next four names slated for use are shown below.\n\nThis is a table of all the storms that have formed in the 1990 Pacific hurricane season. It includes their duration, names, landfall(s), denoted in parentheses, damages, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all the damage figures are in 1990 USD.\n\n\n"}

He was the founder and the head of the Bektashi Sufi lodge (\"tekke\") located in Taylor, Michigan, United States.\n\nBaba Rexheb was born as \"Rexheb Beqiri\", on 18 August 1901, into a family with strong Bektashi ties in Gjirokastër, southern Albania, at a time when Albania was still part of the Ottoman Empire. His father, Refat Beqiri, was a local mullah in the old neighbourhood of Dunavat, Gjirokastër. Refat’s family had originally migrated to southern Albania from the Kosovar town of Gjakova. His mother was from Elbasan in central Albania as was his murshid, his spiritual guide, Selim Baba Elbasani. He entered the Bektashi Order at the age of sixteen and was promoted to the rank of dervish at the age of twenty. A year later, he took an additional vow as a \"mücerred\" (celibate) dervish. For the next twenty-five years he served in the Asim Baba Tekke, under the guidance of his maternal uncle, Baba Selim. During World War II, Dervish Rexhep followed the guidance of his murshid and went from village to village, telling the people that the communists \"Din yok, vatan yok,\" that is, \"They have no religion, they have no homeland.\" Because of this he was forced to flee in 1944 when the communists under Enver Hoxha came to power. He spent four years in a displaced persons camps in Italy. His dream was to serve Bektashis in America, but after World War II, it was very difficult to come to America. So instead he went to the Bektashi Kaygusuz Sultan Tekke in the Mokattam in Cairo, Egypt. He stayed there for four years until his number for the United States finally came up. He traveled to New York City where one of his sisters, Zejnep Cuçi, had preceded him.\nIn 1954, Baba Rexheb established the \"First Albanian American Bektashi Monastery\" outside Detroit, Michigan, where there was a group of Albanian Bektashis who supported him.\n\nBaba Rexheb was joined by Baba Bajram, Dervish Arshi, and small number of other Bektashi clerics from Egypt and the Balkans. In the 1960s, Albanian Bektashi immigrants began to arrive the Detroit area from Macedonia and these strengthened the Bektashi community. At this time the Bektashi Teqe was also a working farm with orchards, fields, gardens, animals, and a large hen barn. Bektashis came from Canada and other parts of America to be with Baba. There were always many people at the long kitchen table for the main midday meal of the day. People gathered outside in the garden and many came days early for the holidays.\n\nIn 1967 Baba Rexheb began his master work in Albanian, \"Misticizma Islame dhe Bektashizma\" (\"Islamic Mysticism and Bektashism\".) He published it in 1970. Later he was asked by Baba Qamil of Gjakova in Kosova to translate into Albanian Fuzuli's \"Hadikat-i Su'ada,\" a classic 16th century work in Ottoman Turkish, parts of which are read aloud at the holiday of Muharrem. Indeed, he was the only one in the world with the depth of Islamic learning and linguistic skills to do this. Baba was fluent in Arabic, Persian, Ottoman Turkish, modern Turkish, Greek, and Italian. He had passed the tests for the ulemma back in Albania, but more important, he had studied Arabic and Persian texts with Selim Baba Elbasani for twenty years. While he was in Egypt, he had also spent time in the Bektashi library reading more of these texts.\n\nBaba Rexheb taught in Turkish an American student, Frances Trix, who learned Albanian, for over twenty years. His prayers were sought by people of all backgrounds.\n\nBaba Rexheb died on August 10, 1995 (Rabi' ul-Awwal 12, 1416 Hijrah). His türbe (mausoleum) is located on the \"tekke\" grounds and is open for pilgrims and truth-seekers of all walks.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2187756", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2187756", "title": "Venizelism", "text": "Venizelism\n\nVenizelism () was one of the major political movements in Greece from the 1900s until the mid-1970s.\n\nNamed after Eleftherios Venizelos, the key characteristics of Venizelism were:\n\n\nIn the contemporary sense the ideology incorporates national liberalism, civic nationalism, economic liberalism, liberal democracy, pro-Europeanism, republicanism, secularism, centrism, radical centrism and generally moves from centre-right to social democracy.\n\nVenizelos' liberal party ruled Greece from 1910 until 1916. That year, determined to enter World War I on the entente side, Venizelos rebelled against the king and formed a Provisional Government of National Defence in Thessaloniki. Venizelos regained full control of the country in 1917 and ruled until losing the 1920 elections. The strongest support for Venizelism came in the \"New Greece\" gained after the Balkan Wars of 1912-13 consisting of Crete, Thrace, Epirus, the North Aegean islands, and Macedonia. By contrast, people in \"Old Greece\" tended to be more much royalist. The fact that in 1916 King Constantine I had allowed the Bulgarians to occupy parts of Macedonia and had been willing to contemplate giving up all of recently gained \"New Greece\" in the north to the Bulgarians to weaken the Venizelist movement cemented the identification of people in northern Greece with Venizelism. Refugees from Turkey also tended be strongly Venizelist, at least until the 1930s and the signing of the Greco-Turkish friendship agreement by Venizelos (1930).\n\nAfter a crisis period (including two short-lived pro-Venizelist military governments after Nikolaos Plastiras 1922 revolution) the liberals returned to power from 1928 until 1932. Venizelists Sophoklis Venizelos and Georgios Papandreou formed the core of the Greek government in exile during the Axis Occupation of Greece (1941–1944), and held power a number of times in the 1950s.\n\nGeorgios Papandreou created the Centre Union party in 1961, as a coalition of old Venizelists and progressive politicians. In 1963 the party was elected and held power until 1965, when its right wing broke ranks in the events known as the \"Apostasia\". The current Union of Centrists claims to be the ideological continuation of the old party Centre Union.\n\nAfter the 1967–1974 Junta, Venizelists formed the Centre Union – New Forces party, which then evolved into the Union of the Democratic Centre (). While the Venizelist legacy was still popular, election results were disappointing as the abolition of the monarchy, the dilution of support for Greek nationalism after the seven years of the junta and the 1974 Turkish invasion of Cyprus, and Karamanlis' move towards the political centre had blurred the differences between the liberals and their former conservative opponents, while the socialist PASOK party was gaining support at the left side of the spectrum.\n\nMost members of the Centre Union – New Forces party with their leader Georgios Mavros were absorbed by PASOK.\n\nAlthough the image of Venizelos is still very popular in Greece today, Venizelism is no longer a major force in Greek politics. Venizelos' prestige however and his ideology's connotations of republicanism, and progressive reforms means that most mainstream political forces claim his political heritage. There are few explicitly \"Venizelist\" movements today in Greece. In the 2004 elections for the European Parliament, the leading Venizelist party was the Union of Centrists, gaining only 0.54% of the Greek popular vote. An attempted revival of the original Liberal Party, under the same name, was founded in the 1980s by Venizelos' grandson, Nikitas Venizelos.\n\nAgainst Venizelos' policies could be found politicians of different political orientation during the 1910s (monarchists, conservatives, part of the clergy, but also socialists/communists of the newly founded SEKE). Some points of disagreement included the Venizelos' extreme pro-Entente stance during the World War I and the National Schism (which led to the division of the country between a venizelist and a royalist government), his policy about the Megali idea and its results (regarding the relations with Turkey and the Greeks who were still under Ottoman sovereignty) and later the Treaty of Lausanne and the population exchange.\n\nWith antivenizelism sided also the religious minorities in Greece (Muslim, Jewish etc), being in general of conservative political orientation. Another common point of the antivenizelists was a criticism about the country's social and economical transformation/modernization, such as critics for political/economical mismanagement.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2187757", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2187757", "title": "Pitching wedge", "text": "Pitching wedge\n\nA pitching wedge is a wedge used to hit a shot with higher and shorter trajectory than a 9-iron and a lower and longer trajectory than a gap wedge.\n\nThough technically a wedge, pitching wedges are generally treated as if they were numbered irons. This is for a number of reasons: first, before the term \"wedge\" became common for high-loft short irons, the pitching wedge was actually numbered as the \"10-iron\" of a matched set, and to this day it follows the normal loft progression of the numbered irons. Also, even though it has been named a wedge, many matched iron sets for retail sale include the pitching wedge even when not including other wedges. Finally, the loft of modern irons has been reduced compared to older designs. This is both to compensate for cavity-back iron designs that launch the ball higher for a given loft, and to increase the distance carried by each club for the average golfer's clubhead speed. (Professionals now also use similar designs, preserving the gap in hitting distance between the amateur golfer and the pro.) As a result the loft of the pitching wedge decreased along with the numbered irons from a traditional loft of between 48–54° to between 45–50°, similar to that of an older 8-iron. Many pitching wedges have a loft close to 50°.\n\nThe pitching wedge is a very versatile club. Being on the cusp between numbered irons and wedges, the pitching wedge has generally accepted uses falling into either class. Used with a \"full swing\" similar to a short iron, a golfer can produce a high-trajectory shot that carries between (depending on a variety of factors such as swing and club design), then \"bites\" with little or no roll after initial impact. Used with an abbreviated \"chipping\" motion, the club can produce short () \"lob\" or \"approach\" shots. And with a \"putting\" motion, the club can lift the ball over rough or fringe onto the putting green from a short distance to the pin (). This last kind of stroke is commonly called a \"bump and run\" and can be done with many other irons, generally with a loft equal or higher than a 7-iron.\n\nThese clubs are most commonly used with a full swing to produce high-altitude shots such as approaches to the green or lifting the ball over trees. They are also commonly used to \"lay up\" in front of a hazard or to create a better lie for the next shot, and for recovery from firmer rough or sometimes from sand when the ball is lying on top of the surface. The loft of a particular pitching wedge follows the progression of the numbered irons of the same set, and these sets can have subtle differences in the loft progression and starting loft of the set, so the loft of pitching wedges can vary widely between sets. The loft of a pitching wedge generally falls between 42 and 49 degrees, but the launch angle and the average carry distance of the club between sets are typically similar. Pitching wedges can also have between zero and 10 degrees of bounce, though most pitching wedges have very low bounce (only 2 or 3 degrees) as other wedges like gap wedges or sand wedges are more traditionally suited for play out of hazards or soft lies where high bounce is desired.\n\n"}

{"id": "2187766", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2187766", "title": "1989 Pacific hurricane season", "text": "1989 Pacific hurricane season\n\nThe 1989 Pacific hurricane season officially started on May 15, 1989, in the eastern Pacific, and June 1, 1989, in the central Pacific, and lasted until November 30, 1989. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. A total of 17 storms and 9 hurricanes formed, which was near long-term averages. Four hurricanes reached major hurricane status (Category 3 or higher) on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale.\n\nNotable storms include Hurricanes Cosme, Kiko, and Raymond. Cosme crossed over Mexico and killed 30 people. Hurricane Kiko made landfall on the Gulf of California side of the Baja California Peninsula. Hurricane Raymond was the strongest storm of the season, but weakened significantly before landfall.\n\nOverall, the season continued the general trend in the 1980s of near to above-average seasons in the East Pacific. Seventeen cyclones formed. Eight peaked at tropical storm strength. Nine systems became hurricanes, of which four were major hurricanes at Category 3 intensity or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. On August 28, three systems were active, one of a few times when there has been three tropical cyclones active simultaneously (Kiko, Lorena, and Manuel) in the east Pacific (west of 140°W). Despite the activity this season, no named storms formed in October. This was the second consecutive season this happened.\n\nDuring the second week of January, an upper-level trough located east of Hawaii created an area of divergence to its southeast, allowing an area of low pressure to develop alongside deep convection. Initially, the system was hampered by wind shear as it moved west-northwestward to the south of Hawaii; however, by January 11, the system was able to maintain convection over its center and was classified as a tropical depression. On January 13, it was estimated in post-storm analysis to have become a tropical storm at an unprecedented . Meteorologists at the time struggled to forecast the storm as climatological forecast guidance (modeling based off previous cyclones), was not available due to the uniqueness of Winona. On January 15, the system crossed the International Dateline and entered the Western Pacific basin.\n\nAs a tropical depression, Winona brought heavy rains to portions of Hawaii, triggering flash flooding on a few islands. No damage resulted from the floods. After becoming a tropical storm, the system brushed Wake Island, bringing gusty winds and moderate rainfall. Several days later, the storm passed near the Mariana Islands and Guam, bringing tropical storm-force wind gusts and heavy rainfall. Minor damage resulted from Winona but there was no loss of life. Operationally, this system was not classified a tropical storm until January 16, thus it was not warned upon by the Central Pacific Hurricane Center during its early stages.\n\nThe first storm of the season developed out of a weak area of low pressure situated about 570 mi (925 km) south-southwest of Acapulco, Mexico. Tracking towards the west, the circulation briefly dissipated on May 30, before redeveloping the following day into Tropical Depression One-E. A ridge of high pressure north of the system steered it towards the west-northwest. By 0600 UTC on June 1, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) upgraded the depression to a tropical storm and gave it the name Adolph. Adolph continued to strengthen until early on June 2, at which time it reached its peak intensity with winds of 65 mph (100 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 994 mbar (hPa). Shortly after peaking, cool, dry air became entrained in the circulation, preventing further intensification. Early on June 3, Adolph weakened slightly due to unfavorable conditions. Later that day, Adolph briefly re-intensified. On June 4, strong wind shear displaced convection associated with the storm to the west of the center of circulation; this resulted in Adolph weakening to a tropical depression by 1800 UTC that day, and Adolph persisted until June 5 at which time it dissipated.\n\nOn June 10, an area of disturbed weather was located several hundred miles southwest of Acapulco, Mexico, and the system slowed to a westward drift. After gradually becoming better organized, the NHC estimated that the wave spawned Tropical Depression Two-E around 1800 UTC on June 15. Initially, the depression towards the northwest before a ridge of high pressure situated over Mexico caused the storm to turn towards the west-northwest. Based on improving satellite presentation, the NHC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Barbara. With favorable conditions, Barbara continued to intensify, attaining hurricane-status roughly 24 hours after being named. Six hours later, the storm reached its peak intensity with winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) Satellite images early on June 18 showed that cool, dry air was becoming entrained into the northern inflow of the storm and Barbara was nearing cooler waters. These factors led to the storm weakening below hurricane intensity by 0000 UTC on June 19. Wind shear at this time also began to increase, displacing all convection associated with the storm to the northeast of the center. By June 20, the former hurricane was further downgraded to a tropical depression. The NHC issued their final advisory on the system early on June 21; however, the remnants of the storm persisted until June 27.\nOn June 18 a tropical disturbance formed several hundred miles off the coast of Mexico. Ships in the vicinity of the storm, in addition to satellite images, indicated that the disturbance had developed into Tropical Depression Three-E around 1800 UTC. Remaining nearly stationary, the depression gradually strengthened into a tropical storm by June 20, receiving the name \"Cosme\" at that time. Early on June 21, Cosme began to track towards the north and intensify. Around 1200 UTC, Cosme strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Several hours later, Cosme reached its peak intensity. Late on June 21, the center of the hurricane made landfall on the Mexican coast, just east of Acapulco with winds of 80 mph (130 km/h). The low associated with the former hurricane was last identified near Brownsville, Texas.\n\nCosme brought heavy rains, which killed at least 30 people due to drowning. Many adobe homes were destroyed, but a specific cost of damage is not known. The highest rainfall recorded in relation to Cosme was in Yautepec San Bartolo, Mexico.\n\nThe fourth tropical cyclone of the season formed as a well-organized depression on July 9. Deep convection associated with the system indicated that intensification into a tropical storm was possible. The system track generally westward in response to high pressure system to the north. On July 10, the depression quickly became disorganized, with only a small area of convection around the center remaining by midday. Although the depression was nearly at tropical storm intensity, the NHC held off on upgrading it due to its proximity to Tropical Depression Five-E. However, the system failed to intensify. By July 11, the depression entered the Central Pacific hurricane center's area of responsibility. Tracking generally northwest, the system slowly weakened before dissipating on July 14 to the south of Hawaii.\n\nOn July 10, a tropical depression formed far from land. Upon formation, there was uncertainty of the location of center. Shortly thereafter, the system became sheared and further intensification was no longer anticipated. On July 11, the low-level center became displaced form the deep convection.\nthe next day, the center was relocated, and moved to the west. While the NHC noted the possibility of intensification, the depression was forecasted to dissipate in 36 hours. It failed to intensify, and moved into the Central Pacific on July 14. The fast-moving tropical depression dissipated two days later. The remnants of the depression passed far to the south of Hawaii, thus there was no damage.\nOn July 9, a defined low pressure system formed south of Baja California and increased convective activity led to the NHC classifying it Tropical Depression Six-E on July 11. About 24 hours later, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Dalilia. By July 13, Dalilia had intensified into a minimal hurricane as it tracked generally toward the northwest. Two days later, the storm took a nearly due west track, which it maintained until July 19. Although the storm tracked near cool waters, a well-developed outflow allowed it to maintain hurricane-intensity. Shortly before crossing into the Central Pacific basin, the storm reached its peak intensity with winds of 90 mph (150 km/h) and a central pressure of 977 mbar (hPa; 28.85 inHg). After crossing 140°W, Dalilia weakened to a minimal hurricane. The storm maintained this intensity until July 19, at which time the system slowed and turned northwest. The following day, the weakening tropical storm brushed the Hawaiian Islands to the south, eventually curving away from the island chain on July 21. Later that day, Dalilia further weakened to a tropical depression, with the Central Pacific Hurricane Center issuing their final advisory at that time. The remnants of the former hurricane continued to track northwest.\n\nWhile tracking near the Hawaiian islands, Dalilia produced waves up to along south-facing coastlines. Along the coasts of Ka'u and South Kona, winds gusted up to 45 mph (75 km/h); the winds caused minor damage Along the southeast slopes of Mauna Loa, heavy rains caused minor flooding which forced transit officials to shut down several roads. Localized areas received rainfall in excess of .\n\nOn July 16, an area of disturbed weather located organized into a tropical depression. Upon formation, the NHC did not anticipate significant intensification due to it close distance to both cooler waters and Hurricane Dalilia. The next day, however, the center became difficult to locate and the system was no longer forecast to intensity. By the night, only minimal deep convection remained. The depression soon moved into cold water and as such the system was expected to dissipate within 24 hours. It dissipated the next day. The remnants of this system contributed to a surge in the monsoon trough that led to the formation of Tropical Storm Erick. This system never impacted land, and thus no damage or deaths were reported.\n\nOn July 16, there was a surge in convection in the monsoon trough. The most concentrated area soon separated for the trough and by July 19, satellite imagery indicated an area of deep convection that was located nearly away from Mexico. Early that day, the system was upgraded to a tropical depression. Upon becoming a tropical cyclone, only slight intensification was anticipated. The system intensified to a tropical storm 24 hours after forming. Erick soon moved into cooler waters. This quickly weakened the cyclone and was downgraded to a tropical depression on July 20. It dissipated the next day, without ever impacting any land masses.\n\nFlossie originated from a tropical wave that entered the Pacific Ocean on July 20. The system began to show signs of organization two days later. Continuing to organize, the system was upgraded Tropical Depression Nine-E on July 23. Despite being located over warm waters, only gradual intensification was anticipated. It strengthened into Tropical Storm Flossie the next day. Shortly thereafter the upgraded, convection began to diminish. The cyclone then drifted northwest. The upper-level environment rapidly changed, and the cyclones convection became disorganized. The convection separated from the center of circulation. The cluster of convection developed a new center of circulation on July 24. The original center drifted away from Flossie for 12 hours before dissipating. The new center, which was still a tropical storm, drifted northwest. Flossie then encountered an unfavorable environment, and weakened into a depression on July 25. Flossie continued drifting to the northwest until dissipating July 28, while just off the coast of the Baja California Peninsula. Despite its close distance to Mexico, no damage or deaths were reported.\n\nGil formed from an area of disturbed weather located near the Mexico–Guatemala border developed a circulation in the Gulf of Tehuantepec and then dissipated. On July 30, the disturbance redeveloped a circulation and then convection. It paralleled the coast of Mexico and headed in a northwesterly direction. The low continued to organize, and was upgraded into a tropical depression. Initially, there was some uncertain in the storms future path, and there was a possibility of the system recurving towards the coast. It strengthened into a tropical storm on July 31. The system continued to become better organized, with further intensification foretasted because the low was located over very warm waters; and was upgraded into a hurricane that same day. Shortly thereafter, the cyclone developed an eye. Gil was a hurricane for only about 30 hours, and it began to encounter dry air. By the August 1, Gil had lost hurricane intensity. It was downgraded to a tropical depression the next day. The cyclone dissipated on August 5.\n\nThe outer bands of Gil produced significant amounts of rainfall over coastal areas of Mexico, with satellites estimating areas of rainfall in excess of . The heavy rains may have triggered deadly flooding and landslides; however, no reports from Mexican officials have been received to confirm this. However, officials reported of rain in a 12-hour period.\n\nA tropical wave crossed Central America on August 11, and then became an area of low pressure. While located of the coast of Mexico it became better organized on August 14. This was enough to warrant an upgrade to Tropical Depression Eleven-E. This system slowly became better organized, but northerly wind shear prevent rapid intensification. Initially, this system was slow to intensify. After strengthening into Tropical Storm Ismael, it closely paralleled the coast of Mexico, Ismael turned to the west. It would maintain that generally westerly direction for the rest of its long path across the Pacific Ocean. The system steadily intensified, and by August 16, Ismael had developed a fair outflow. It reached hurricane strength later that day. Continuing to intensify, the hurricane reached Category 2 intensity. However, the system was not expect to intensify further due to cool sea surface temperatures. However, Ismael managed reached Category 3 status. It then reached a peak intensity of 120 mph (195 km/h) and a peak pressure of 955 millibars. Shortly after its peak, Ismael underwent fluctuations in strength. On August 21, Ismael passed over cooler waters. In addition, the storm encountered strong wind shear. The hostile environment continued to take its toll on Ismael, and it weakened to a tropical storm on August 23. Ismael dissipated not long after weakening to a depression on August 25. The remains of Ismael, which was only a swirl of clouds, dissipated near Hawaii.\n\nBetween August 15 and 17, the outer bands of Ismael produced heavy rains along coastal areas of Mexico between Acapulco and Manzanillo, Colima. At least three people were killed by flooding triggered by the storm; however, no structural damage was reported. Despite the rainfall, there were no reports of flooding. The remnants of the hurricane passed near Hawaii, but did not pose a threat.\n\nOn August 12, a tropical wave formed in the Pacific Ocean. it steadily organized into the twelfth tropical depression of the season early on August 14. It slowly strengthened and was named \"Henriette\" after strengthening into a tropical storm. After peaking with winds of 50 mph (85 km/h) and a peak pressure of on August 15, wind shear immediately began to weaken the tropical cyclone. On August 16, after becoming devoid of any convection, it was downgraded into tropical depression status on August 16. Henriette degenerated into a remnant low on August 17. The low persisted for a few more days until completely dissipating.\n\nA surge in convection in the monsoon trough caused by nearby Hurricane Ismael interacted with a tropical wave to form the thirteenth tropical depression of the season on August 21. Due to the small distance of between the cyclones, the depression followed Ismael. Despite strong wind shear caused by Ismael, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Juliette on August 22 as a strong burst of convection occurred. After Ismael dissipated, steering currents collapsed, and Juliette moved over cool waters in the open ocean for several days. In addition, strong wind shear took toll on the system. The low had completely dissipated during the evening of August 25. Juliette never impacted land.\nOn August 25, the seasons fourteenth tropical depression formed off the coast of Sonora, Mexico from a Mesoscale Convective System. A small cyclone, the system rapidly intensified over the warm waters of the Gulf of California, becoming Tropical Storm Kiko hours after forming and a hurricane 12 hours later. The fast rate of strengthening continued until August 27, at which time Kiko peaked in intensity as a strong Category 3 hurricane with winds of 120 mph (195 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 955 mbar (hPa; 28.2 inHg). Slight weakening occurred before the storm made landfall near Punta Arena, Mexico, becoming one of the strongest storms to make landfall in Mexico since reliable records began in 1949. The hurricane quickly weakened as it moved over the Baja Peninsula, being downgraded to a tropical depression before emerging into the Pacific Ocean on August 28. The following day, the remnants of Kiko were absorbed by the nearby Hurricane Lorena.\n\nAlthough Kiko was a major hurricane upon landfall, little damage resulted from the storm. However, 20 homes were destroyed and numerous highways were flooded by torrential rains.\n\nIn the Atlantic, a tropical wave spawned Tropical Depression Six. Twenty four hours later, wind shear degenerated the depression back into a wave. The wave continued westward, and in the southern Caribbean Sea, split in two on August 21. The southern part crossed Central America and emerged into the Pacific Ocean. Banding and convection steadily organized, and Tropical Depression Fifteen-E formed on August 27. It strengthened into Tropical Storm Lorena the next day. At this time, three systems were active and in close proximity. Lorena and a weakening Kiko started a Fujiwhara interaction. Lorena eventually became the dominate system, and absorbed the remnants of Kiko on August 29. Moving slowly out to sea, Lorena reached minimal hurricane strength on the September 1 as the convection became more concentrated. Lorena was a hurricane for less than a day. It weakened quickly to a depression on September 3. The cyclone was devoid of convection by September 7, and was thus declared a remnant low. The system never affected land.\n\nAn area of thunderstorms organized into a tropical depression on August 28. The next day, convection increased near the center, and was respectively upgraded into a tropical storm. Manuel gradually strengthened, reaching a peak of 45 mph (75 km/h). Manuel approached to within of Lorena. Due to its proximity to the storm, Manuel lost its center circulation on August 31. The storms only impact on land was light rainfall near Manzanillo, Colima. No reports of death or damage were reported.\n\nOn September 2, a tropical wave began showing sings of organization, and on September 3, it organized into a tropical depression. Upon becoming a tropical cyclone, Narda was located over warm sea surface temperatures. Moving rapidly, to the west-northwest, Narda strengthened into a tropical storm. Strong wind shear prevented significant intensification beyond minimal tropical storm strength, with winds peaking at 50 mph (75 km/h). Initially, Narda managed to produce brief burst of convection. By September 7, however, Narda was devoid of convection, and was respectively downgraded to a tropical depression. It never impacted land.\nAt low latitude in the Atlantic, Tropical Depression Nine formed from a tropical wave on August 28. The depression degenerated the next day due to strong wind shear. The wave continued drifting westward, and entered the Pacific Ocean on the September 2. It slowly developed, and organized into Tropical Depression Eighteen-E on September 8. The cyclone turned northwestward, and strengthened into Tropical Storm Octave on September 10. After strengthening into a hurricane the next day, Octave started deepening. After peaking as a Category 4 on September 13 with winds, Octave moved into a region of cooler waters and strong shear. Octave weakened to a storm at midday on September 14 and a depression 32 hours later. The depression hooked to the east, and dissipated on September 18 near Guadalupe Island. The remnants eventually turned to the north before dissipating.\n\nWhile Octave had no significant effects on land as a hurricane, its remnants did move into California. In the Sacramento Valley, the town of Redding recorded of rain in a 12-hour span.\n\nTropical Depression Nineteen-E organized from an area of low pressure on September 21. Upon being upgraded, the depression was anticipated to slowly strengthen, becoming a strong tropical storm in three days. Moving northwestward, it was named Priscilla the next day. Continuing to intensify, it reached its peak intensity of 65 mph (100 km/h). Due to its close proximity to the cooler waters, Priscilla began weakening almost immediately thereafter. The cyclone weakened into a tropical depression on September 24 and dissipated the next day .\n\nAlthough Priscilla did not directly impact land as a tropical cyclone, the remnant moisture enhanced a non-tropical low off the California coastline, resulting in heavy rainfall along the Pacific coast of the United States. In southern California, the system also resulted in hot and humid weather, with some areas reaching up to .\n\nOn September 24, Tropical Depression Twenty-E formed southwest of Guatemala. Although convection increased, significant development was not anticipated due to its proximity to land. It was also forecasted to make landfall in 36 hours. A small cyclone, its close distance to Hurricane Raymond hindered development. Moving very little, the winds soon diminished. The depression dissipated on September 27.\nWhen the depression was anticipated to make landfall in Mexico. As such, the NHC noted the possibility of heavy rains especially over the higher elevations. However, no impact was reported from the tropical cyclone.\nTropical Depression Twenty One-E formed from part of the same tropical wave that had earlier spawned Hurricane Hugo. Moving slowly to the west-northwest, it accelerated to the northwest in response to a trough and strengthened into the seventeenth named storm of the season on September 26. Raymond turned to the west again and entered a favourable environment. Raymond eventually peaked as a Category 4 hurricane and the strongest storm of the season on October 1. A trough over Mexico destroyed the ridge that was steering Raymond and recurved the cyclone to the northeast. The hurricane accelerated into a less favorable environment, and slowly weakened as its forward speed increased to . Raymond made landfall as a tropical storm on October 4. Northern Mexico's mountains disrupted Raymond's circulation, and dissipated over New Mexico on October 5 after passing over that state and Arizona as a depression.\n\nSince Raymond had significantly weakened prior to its first landfall, only minor impacts were recorded in Mexico. The highest rainfall was recorded in Nogales at . In the city, the swollen Santa Cruz River destroyed a heavily traveled bridge, known as the Calle Obregon, and destroyed a store which was situated on the banks of the river. Mexican officials estimated damages at $250,000 (1989 USD, $  USD). The remnants of the storm tracked into the Southwest United States and further into the Central United States before dissipating. Rainfall in excess of fell in parts of southern Arizona; the highest total was recorded in Independence, Kansas, at . One person was killed in a mobile home which was destroyed by high winds. Flash flooding triggered by Raymond caused an estimated $1.5 million (1989 USD, $  USD) in damages in Arizona.\n\nOn October 3, a tropical depression formed south of Mexico from an area of disturbed weather that had become better organized. Upon becoming a tropical cyclone, the cyclone was located in a favorable environment. As such, it was forecasted to reach a peak intensity of to be named \"Sonia\". Later that day, convection increased, but the NHC did not upgrade the system into a tropical storm. However, increased wind shear quickly caused the system to become exposed. After drifting westbound, it did not become a tropical storm and dissipated on October 4. However, it regenerated on October 7 as deep convection had developed near the center for about 12 hours. Upon regenerating, it was forecasted to intensify into a strong tropical storm as it was expected to turn to the north. Shortly thereafter, the system became less organized; it dissipated again the next day. The depression never threatened land.\n\nOn October 15, Tropical Depression 23E developed about to the southwest of Mexico City, within an area of warm water and diminishing wind shear and as a result was expected to slowly intensify further. However, during October 16, all of the deep convection associated with 23E dissipated, before the National Hurricane Center issued its final advisory during the next day.\n\nOn October 18, the NHC began issuing advisories on Tropical Depression Twenty Four-E. Although the depression was located within an area of high wind shear, convection had managed to partially develop around the center of circulation. A ship nearby the system reported sustained winds of 40 mph (65 km/h); however, the winds were not considered to be representative of the actual intensity of the depression. Further intensification was not expected as the depression tracked in a northward direction Shortly after the first advisory was issued, convection rapidly dissipated, leaving an exposed low pressure area, devoid of shower and thunderstorm activity. The system was forecast to dissipate within 36 hours due to high shear. Late on October 18, the forward motion of the depression abruptly changed towards the west. The final advisory on Tropical Depression Twenty Four-E was issued during the afternoon of October 19 as the system remained devoid of convection; redevelopment of the system was not anticipated due to unfavorable conditions.\nThe following names were used for named storms that formed in the eastern Pacific in 1989. Since no names were retired, no new names were replaced for the 1995 season. However, the name Dalilia was later changed to Dalila through a misspelling of the name. The changed spelling has remained in use since 1995. Names that were not assigned are marked in gray. \"Winnie\" would later trade years with \"Wallis\" in future seasons.\n\nStarting in the early 1980s, the Central Pacific Hurricane Center assigned names to tropical storms that formed between the 180° to 140°W. Names for the basin are taken off a single list due to the low frequency of storms in the area. Had a tropical storm formed in the Central Pacific during 1989, it would have received the name \"Aka\". The first six names on the list that could have been used are listed below.\n\nThis is a table of all the storms that have formed in the 1989 Pacific hurricane season. It includes their duration, names, landfall(s), denoted in parentheses, damages, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all the damage figures are in 1989 USD.\n\n\n"}

Inis Mór has a population of about 840, making it the largest of the Aran Islands in terms of population and largest island off the Irish coast with no bridge or causeway to the mainland. The island is famous for its strong Irish culture, loyalty to the Irish language, and a wealth of Pre-Christian and Christian ancient sites including Dún Aonghasa, described as \"the most magnificent barbaric monument in Europe\" by George Petrie.\n\nPrior to the 20th century, the island was more commonly called Inis Bant or as \"Árainn na Naomh\". The modern Irish name, \"Árainn Mhór\", (which translates as \"Great Aran\" in English) leads to some confusion with Arranmore, County Donegal. The Irish word \"\" means \"long ridge\", presumably referring to the island's geography. \"Árainn\" is the legal placename in Irish or English as declared in the Official Languages Act 2003.\n\nThe island is an extension of the Burren. The terrain of the island is composed of limestone pavements with crisscrossing cracks known as \"grikes\", leaving isolated rocks called \"clints\".\nThe limestones date from the Visean period (Lower Carboniferous), formed as sediments in a tropical sea approximately 350 million years ago, and compressed into horizontal strata with fossil corals, crinoids, sea urchins and ammonites.\nGlaciation following the Namurian phase facilitated greater denudation. The result is that Inis Mór and the other islands are among the finest examples of Glacio-Karst landscape in the world. The effects of the last glacial period (the Midlandian) are most in evidence, with the island overrun by ice during this glaciation. The impact of earlier Karstification (solutional erosion) has been eliminated by the last glacial period. So any Karstification now seen dates from approximately 10,000 years ago and the island Karst is thus recent.\n\nSolutional processes have widened and deepened the grikes of the limestone pavement. Pre-existing lines of weakness in the rock (vertical joints) contribute to the formation of extensive fissures separated by clints (flat pavement like slabs). The rock karstification facilitates the formation of sub-terrainean drainage.\n\n\nThe island supports arctic, Mediterranean and alpine plants side by side, due to the unusual environment. Like the Burren, the Aran islands are known for their unusual assemblage of plants and animals.\nThe grikes (crevices) provide moist shelter, thus supporting a wide range of plants including dwarf shrubs. Where the surface of the pavement is shattered into gravel, many of the hardier Arctic or alpine plants can be found. But when the limestone pavement is covered by a thin layer of soil, patches of grass are seen, interspersed with plants like the gentian and orchids.\nInsects present include the butterfly the pearl-bordered fritillary (\"Boloria euphrosyne\"), brown hairstreak (\"Thecla betulae\"), marsh fritillary (\"Euphydryas aurinia\") and wood white (\"Leptidea sinapis\"); the moths, the burren green (\"Calamia tridens\"), Irish annulet (\"Gnophos dumetata\") and transparent burnet (\"Zygaena purpuralis\"); and the hoverfly \"Doros profuges\".\n\nInis Mór today is a major tourist destination, with bed and breakfast accommodation scattered across the island. Private minibuses, horse-drawn carriages and bicycles are the main methods of getting about for the numerous tourists who visit the island in the summer months.\n\nThere is a small museum illustrating the history of Dún Aonghasa and its possible functions, while the Aran Sweater Market is also a focal point for visitors who can trace the culture and history associated with the Aran sweater through the on-site museum. Nearby are a Neolithic tomb and a small heritage park at Dún Eochla, featuring examples of a traditional thatched cottage and poteen distillery.\nThe \"Tempull Breccain\" (Church of Brecan), commonly called the Seven Churches of Aran, is a complex of churches and other buildings dedicated to the 5th-century Saint Brecan, once a popular destination for pilgrims. There is a nineteenth-century lighthouse in the centre of the island, said to have views of the mountains of distant County Kerry on a clear day.\n\nThe island plays host to Ted Fest each year. Established in 2004 it is a celebration of the television sitcom \"Father Ted\". Festival goers dress as their favourite characters, watch their favourite episodes and take part in various \"Ted\" related events and competitions.\n\nSome of the limestone sea cliffs have attracted interest from rock-climbers.\nDiving is possible. A particularly popular location for this is Poll na bPéist (hole of worms/sea monsters), located at the southern coast of the island, which is a large naturally formed rectangular pool communicating via underground channels with the sea. Since 2012 Inis Mór has hosted an event as part of the Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series.\n\nThe island is serviced by Aran Ferries ferry from Rossaveal and Doolin. These are passenger-only ferries; cars and heavy goods are transported on unscheduled services.\n\nAer Arann Islands runs daily scheduled flights from Inis Mór Aerodrome to Connemara Airport using Britten Norman Islander aircraft.\n\nThe island features heavily in Martin McDonagh's play \"The Lieutenant of Inis Mór\".\n\nInis Mór was used as a recording location for the 1997 film \"The Matchmaker\" and the 2010 film \"Leap Year\".\n\nThe first story in \"These Precious Hours\" by Michel Corrigan has a scene set on Inis Mór.\n\nThe island appeared on the premiere episode of \"The Amazing Race 12\" with teams needing to find Teampall Bheanáin after they arrived.\n\nThe music video for Dermot Kennedy's \"For Island Fires and Family\" (video released 10 January 2019) was filmed entirely on Inis Mór.\n\n\nAnnals of Inisfallen (AI)\n\n\nThe table below reports data on Inis Mór's population taken from \"Discover the Islands of Ireland\" (Alex Ritsema, Collins Press, 1999) and the Census of Ireland. \nAI=Annals of Inisfallen.

{"id": "2187778", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2187778", "title": "Conditional factor demands", "text": "Conditional factor demands\n\nIn economics, a conditional factor demand is the cost-minimizing level of an input (factor of production) such as labor or capital, required to produce a given level of output, for given unit input costs (wage rate and cost of capital) of the input factors. A conditional factor demand function expresses the conditional factor demand as a function of the output level and the input costs. The conditional portion of this phrase refers to the fact that this function is conditional on a given level of output, so output is one argument of the function. Typically this concept arises in a long run context in which both labor and capital usage are choosable by the firm, so a single optimization gives rise to conditional factor demands for each of labor and capital.\n\nSince the optimal mix of input levels depends on the wage and rental rates, these rates are also arguments of the conditional demand functions for the inputs. This concept is similar to but distinct from the factor demand functions, which give the optimal demands for the inputs when the level of output is free to be chosen; since output is not fixed in that case, output is not an argument of those demand functions.\n\nWith two inputs, say labor and capital, the optimization problem is to minimize the total cost (amount spent on factors of production, say labor and physical capital) subject to achieving a given level of output, as illustrated in the graph. Each of the convex isoquants shows various combinations of labor and capital usage all of which would allow a given amount of output to be produced. Each straight line segment is an isocost curve showing various amounts of labor and capital whose combined usage would cost a given amount unique to that isocost curve. Conditional on producing the amount of output consistent with, say, the middle isoquant, the lowest cost can be obtained by using amounts of labor and capital such that the point on the given isoquant is on the lowest possible isocost curve--that is, at the point of tangency between the given isoquant and one of the cost curves. At the tangency the marginal rate of technical substitution between the factors (the absolute value of the slope of the isoquant at the optimal point) equals the relative factor costs (the absolute value of the slope of the isocost curve).\n\nThis optimization can be formalized as follows:\n\nwhere \"L\" and \"K\" are the chosen quantities of labor and capital, \"w\" and \"r\" are the fixed unit costs of labor (wage rate) and capital (rental rate) respectively, \"f\" is the production function specifying how much output can be produced with any combination of inputs, and \"q\" is the fixed level of output required.\n\nThe resulting factor demand functions are of the general form\n\nfor labor demand, and \n\nfor demand for physical capital. That the wage rate and capital rental rates affect the optimal input quantities can also be seen graphically because they both affect the slope of the isocost curves in the above graph, while the required quantity \"q\" of output affects them because it determines the relevant isoquant in the graph.\n\nAs the target level of output is increased, the relevant isoquant becomes farther and farther out from the origin, and still it is optimal in a cost-minimization sense to operate at the tangency point of the relevant isoquant with an isocost curve. The set of all such tangency points is called the firm's \"expansion path\".\n"}
{"id": "2187780", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2187780", "title": "1988 Pacific hurricane season", "text": "1988 Pacific hurricane season\n\nThe 1988 Pacific hurricane season was a Pacific hurricane season that saw a below-average amount of tropical cyclones form, the first time since 1981. It officially began May 15, in the eastern Pacific, and June 1, in the central Pacific and lasted until November 30. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. The first named storm, Tropical Storm Aletta, formed on June 16, and the last-named storm, Tropical Storm Miriam, was previously named Hurricane Joan in the Atlantic Ocean before crossing Central America and re-emerging in the eastern Pacific; Miriam continued westward and dissipated on November 2.\n\nThe season produced 23 tropical depressions, of which 15 attained tropical storm status. Seven storms reached hurricane status, three of which became major hurricanes. The strongest storm of the season, Hurricane Hector, formed on July 30 to the south of Mexico and reached peak winds of 145 mph (230 km/h)—Category 4 status—before dissipating over open waters on August 9; Hector was never a threat to land. Tropical Storm Gilma was the only cyclone in the season to make landfall, crossing the Hawaiian Islands, although there were numerous near-misses. Gilma's Hawaiian landfall was unusual, but not unprecedented. There were also two systems that successfully crossed over from the Atlantic; the aforementioned Hurricane Joan and Hurricane Debby which became Tropical Storm Miriam and Tropical Depression Seventeen-E, respectively. Three systems caused deaths; Tropical Storm Aletta caused one death in southwestern Mexico, Hurricane Uleki caused two drownings off the coast of Oahu as it passed by the Hawaiian Islands, and Hurricane Kristy caused 21 deaths in the Mexican states of Oaxaca and Chipas.\n\nThe Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) index for the 1988 Pacific hurricane season was 127.45 units (87.79 units from the Eastern Pacific and 39.66 units from the Central Pacific).\n\nThe total tropical activity in the season was below-average. There were 13 cyclones in the Eastern Pacific, as well as two in the Central. Of the 15 cyclones, one crossed from the Atlantic Ocean into the Pacific, and another moved from the Central Pacific to the Western Pacific. In the Eastern Pacific, there were seven cyclones peaking as a tropical storm, and six hurricanes, of which two reached Category 3 intensity or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. A tropical storm and a major hurricane occurred in the Central Pacific.\n\nTropical Storm Gilma made the only landfalls of the season in the Hawaiian Islands, causing some rainfall, but no direct deaths or damage occurred as a result of it. These were the only landfalls in the season that were made, which is unusual as most landfalls in the Eastern Pacific occur on the Mexican coast. This is due to the closeness of the Mexican region to the major source of tropical activity to the west of Central America. Hurricane Uleki, the strongest hurricane in the Central Pacific region during the season, caused two drownings in Oahu and heavy waves hit the coast of the Hawaiian Islands. Tropical Storm Miriam, the last storm of the season, formed as a result of Hurricane Joan from the Atlantic, and flooding resulted in parts of Central America, due to heavy rainfall.\n\nA tropical disturbance organized into the first eastern Pacific tropical depression of the season on June 15. A convective band on the north and west sides of the system became well-defined, and anticyclonic outflow allowed for initial organization. After forming, the depression tracked west-southwestward and intensified due to disrupted outflow from a large air stream disturbance. On June 16, strong convection with spiral banding developed over the depression, although it failed to strengthen further. A low pressure system northwest of the depression in combination with Tropical Storm Aletta to the northeast caused the depression to weaken, and it dissipated on June 18.\n\nA tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa and progressed westward through the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea, before crossing over Central America on June 13 and emerging into the warm waters of the east Pacific on June 14. Shortly after, satellite imagery showed good upper-level outflow, although cloud banding remained disorganized. On June 16, the broad circulation better organized on the northeastern section, with deep convection developing. A tropical depression formed later that day about 200 miles (320 km) to the southeast of Acapulco, Mexico. It developed further as it moved northward toward the southwest coast of Mexico, and had organized sufficiently to be named Tropical Storm Aletta on June 17. The cyclone drifted north-northwest for the next 36 hours before turning westward, parallel to the Mexican coast. The storm began to lose its convection on June 19 and weakened into a tropical depression later that day. The depression weakened further into a weak low-level circulation before dissipating on June 21. Although Aletta approached the Acapulco area of the Mexican coast, it did not make landfall.\nThe portion of coast affected by Aletta received heavy rainfall; unofficial reports state that one person died as a result of the storm, and the storm produced some damage due to rainfall and flooding.\n\nSatellite imagery first detected a low-level circulation on June 20, associated with some heavy convection, 200 miles (325 km) south of the Mexico–Guatemala border, and it intensified into a tropical depression. The cyclone moved northwest then west-northwest over two days. A 40 mph (65 km/h) wind report from a ship on June 21 allowed the depression to be upgraded to Tropical Storm Bud later that day. For the next day, the low-level circulation moved away from its deep convection, dissipating near Acapulco, Mexico. A portion of Bud remaining over land may have been part of the reason for the lack of strengthening of the cyclone.\n\nA system developed in the eastern Pacific, and later strengthened into a tropical depression on July 1, when it obtained a better defined low-level circulation. The center was exposed, with little convection on the northeast side, due to shear aloft. The system moved to the northwest, while shear continued to move the deep convection of the cyclone to the southwest of its center of circulation. The circulation completely lacked deep convection late on July 2, although it continued to have a well-defined low-level center.\nThe depression drifted slowly northward, located south of Baja California, before dissipating just south of the peninsula on July 4, with no circulation or deep convection detected. A small amount of associated rainfall affected Baja California, as the cyclone passed near the peninsula.\n\nA tropical wave moved off the western coast of Africa on June 23, and for the next two weeks, moved through the tropical waters of the Atlantic Ocean and later crossed Central America. It began developing further when it entered the Pacific Ocean and became a dense area of moisture and cloudiness. The wave developed into a disturbance on July 8, and attained tropical depression status in the afternoon on July 8, south of Mexico. After entering a favorable area of warm waters, the depression strengthened to Tropical Storm Carlotta on July 9. Carlotta continued to develop, reached peak strength, and developed into Hurricane Carlotta on July 11. During the duration of the storm, Carlotta was not considered a hurricane, however after post-season reanalysis Carlotta's strength was upgraded to minimal hurricane status. As it moved into less favorable conditions it lost strength and weakened to a tropical storm on July 12. Carlotta began to lose its deep convection, and weakened into a tropical depression on July 13 as it moved into cooler waters. It later moved west-southwest and dissipated on July 15.\n\nA tropical wave moved off the coast of northwestern Africa on July 4, and moved through tropical regions of the northern Atlantic and Caribbean Sea without the indication of development. The tropical disturbance crossed Central America on July 14, and from then until July 18, the westward motion decreased, as convection and organization increased over warm waters. It developed into a tropical depression on July 19, and into Tropical Storm Daniel southwest of the southern tip of Baja California on July 20. A high pressure system over the western United States and northern Mexico forced Daniel and an upper-level low on parallel west-northwest paths. Daniel stayed generally the same strength for the next few days, reaching peak strength on July 23. Daniel declined into a tropical depression on July 25 and dissipated on July 26.\n\nOn July 15, a tropical wave exited Africa and crossed the Atlantic Ocean. It crossed into the Pacific Ocean on July 24, developing convection and outflow. On July 27, it organized into a tropical depression off the southwest coast of Mexico. Continuing generally westward, the thunderstorm activity fluctuated, and slowly developing, it intensified into Tropical Storm Emilia on July 29. The storm attained peak winds of 70 mph (110 km/h) on July 30, although wind shear and interaction with nearby Tropical Storm Fabio prevented further intensification; the low-level circulation was located along the northwest edge of the deepest convection. It became disorganized and difficult to locate on satellite imagery, and soon the circulation was exposed from the thunderstorms. On August 1, Emilia weakened to tropical depression status, and late on August 2, the last advisory was issued as the system had become very disorganized with minimal convection. Its remnants were tracked for the next few days, and although some deep convection returned momentarily, the system's convection soon disappeared.\n\nA well-organized ITCZ disturbance with deep convection organized further over the northeastern Pacific Ocean on July 28. It developed into a tropical depression later that day, while southwest of the southern tip of Baja California. The position of Fabio's formation was much further south and west than where most tropical cyclones form during the same time period. The depression moved westward while gradually strengthening and it developed into Tropical Storm Fabio on July 29. It intensified further over the next few days and it intensified into a hurricane on July 31. The system increased its speed as it steadily strengthened further. A trough turned the storm west-northwestward on August 3. Satellite estimates indicated that Fabio reached its maximum intensity later on August 3, with a well-defined eye with very deep convection surrounding it. The Central Pacific Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm watch for the Big Island on August 4, due to the threatening west-northwest turn towards it. However, the retreat of a trough later turned Fabio back to the west and the CPHC discontinued the tropical storm watch on August 5. Fabio's good upper-level conditions later weakened and began to lose its convection over cooler waters. Fabio quickly weakened and it weakened into a tropical storm again later on August 5, and back to a depression on August 6. The depression turned west-northwestward again on August 8, but Fabio dissipated on August 9. As the cyclone moved near the Hawaiian islands, heavy rainfall fell across the chain, peaking at near Pāpa'ikou on the island of Hawaii.\n\nA tropical depression developed in the eastern Pacific on July 28, forecast to be absorbed by a very close nearby depression, later Tropical Storm Gilma. The depression moved northward, although in unfavorable conditions.\nThe cyclone weakened as the depression to the southwest strengthened further. Limited deep convection developed with the system, although the cyclone continued in unfavorable conditions with shearing. Visible satellite imagery later showed a very weak system, and the storm dissipated on July 29.\n\nA wave that previously moved through the Atlantic from the northwest coast of Africa, crossed over Central America into the Pacific on July 17 or July 18. On July 19, this disturbance was 700 miles (1125 km) to the southeast of the developing Tropical Storm Daniel. The system moved westward for the following week without any signs of intensification. However, on July 26 and 27, the system appeared to be strengthening due to a banding pattern. By July 28, the convection underwent further organization with some weak outflow high in the storm. It developed into a tropical depression later on July 28, much further west then most east Pacific storms develop at. For the next day the cyclone remained fairly stationary, but began to strengthen over warm waters. On July 29 the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Gilma, based on satellite imagery. Limited intensification followed, due to shear high in the storm. It weakened a tropical depression again on July 30, due to weakness depicted in satellite imagery. Gilma then moved west-northwestward through the northeast Pacific. The depression skirted the Hawaiian Islands, but dissipated near Oahu on August 3. On the Hawaiian Islands there were no direct damage or deaths, although some rainfall occurred on the islands.\n\nA tropical depression formed on July 30, while 400 miles (645 km) south of Acapulco, Mexico. The depression tracked west-northwestward, becoming Tropical Storm Hector on July 31. Its west-northwest motion continued, due to an area of high pressure to its north, and Hector intensified into a hurricane on August 2. Based on satellite data, the hurricane is estimated to have reached its peak intensity of 145 mph (235 km/h) on August 3; this made Hector a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, which was the strongest storm of the season. Hector began to move due west on August 5 and it had already begun weakening. The storm continued westward increasing its forward speed. On August 6 it had appeared Hector had strengthened, but steadily weakened afterwards and finally dissipated on August 9, while 650 miles (1,045 km) east of Hilo, Hawaii. Hector never a threat to land.\n\nA wave that first came off the northwest coast of Africa moved through the Atlantic, before entering the East Pacific on August 4. The wave developed more organized convection when it entered the region, and it turned into a tropical depression on August 5, while 165 miles (270 km) south of Oaxaca, Mexico. It developed into Tropical Storm Iva on August 6. Iva turned on a west-northwestward course and continued strengthening, before it developed into a hurricane on August 7. The cyclone moved northwestward after becoming a hurricane, and satellites estimate it reached peak intensity on August 8. On the same day Iva passed within 50 miles (80 km) of Socorro Island. Winds of 45 mph (70 km/h) were reported on the island along with moderate rain. The storm moved through cooler waters for the next day, and began to weaken. Iva declined into a tropical storm again on August 9, and by August 10 the cyclone lost its deep convection along with organization. It intensified into a tropical depression again on August 11, and moved southwest due to a high pressure before dissipating on August 13. For unknown reasons, Iva was retired from the lists of\nEastern Pacific storm names, but it was probably to avoid confusion with Hurricane Iwa of the 1982 Pacific season, which was itself retired due to its damage in Hawaii. The name was replaced with Ileana for 1994.\n\nA tropical depression formed on August 12, with movement towards the west-northwest. It continued toward the west-northwest, near the circulation of Tropical Storm Iva. The low-level circulation of the cyclone was displaced to the east of the deep convection, and the system moved to the northwest. The depression lost much of its convection later on August 13, and it had a less defined center. The cyclone turned to the south, and lost its associated deep convection. Some weak convection redeveloped near the center, but the depression dissipated later on August 14.\n\nA disturbance that passed off the northwestern African coast on August 3 crossed the Atlantic Ocean, before entering into the Pacific. A tropical depression formed in the East Pacific on August 16, 150 miles (240 km) southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico, based on satellite estimates. The cyclone progressed slowly northwestward, and intensified Tropical Storm John on August 17, less than 24 hours after its formation. John continued northwest for a short while, before the low-level center of circulation had been exposed. John degenerated to a tropical depression on August 18 due to a lack of convection, made a loop while less than 100 miles (160 km) south of the southern tip of Baja California. It shortly became a little better organized after completing the loop on August 20, but John dissipated on August 21, southwest of Baja California, due to shearing and cold waters. Its remnants continued northwestward parallel to the southwest coast of Baja California. John caused no reported deaths or damage.\n\nOn August 26, a disturbance south of Baja California organized into Tropical Depression Fifteen-E. Initially, the system moved northwest towards cooler waters as the location of the low-level circulation was to the southwest of the deep convection associated with the cyclone. The center drifted to the east of the small area of concentrated convection, and its intensity remained steady.\nIt weakened and became loosely defined due to upper-level wind shear, and the storm lost all of its convection before dissipating and degenerating into a low-level swirl.\nTowards the end of August, tropical activity in the ITCZ southeast of the Hawaiian Islands began to be monitored. On August 28, this tropical disturbance organized into a tropical depression, as it was located about 800 miles (1,285 km) southeast of the Big Island. It intensified at a fair rate, and intensified Tropical Storm Uleki the next day. It continued to strengthen, and reached hurricane intensity on August 31. It moved slowly west-northwest until steering currents collapsed on September 1. Now a Category 3 hurricane, Uleki slowly edged north towards the Hawaiian Islands. After looping, Uleki resumed its westward path on September 4. Its stalling in the ocean had weakened it, and the hurricane passed midway between Johnston Island and French Frigate Shoals. Uleki crossed the dateline on September 8. It turned slightly to the north and meandered in the open Pacific days until it dissipated on September 14.\n\nAs Uleki drifted towards the Hawaiian Islands, tropical storm watches were issued for Oahu, Kauai, and Niihau on September 3. In addition, reconnaissance missions were flown into the hurricane. Uleki caused heavy surf on the Hawaiian Islands, that being its only significant effect. This heavy surf flooded the southeastern runway on Midway Island, and produced two drownings on Oahu. Nineteen people were also rescued from rough surf, with five- to six-foot (1.5 to 1.8 meter) waves, off the coast of beaches in Hawaii.\n\nA tropical wave passed off the northwestern coast of Africa on August 6. It did not develop as it passed through the Atlantic Ocean, until August 19 when convection began to form. On August 20 the disturbance turned into Tropical Depression Six in the Atlantic basin. It passed from the Leeward Islands up to the central Caribbean, until it dissipated on August 23. As it passed over Central America, the disturbance had little remaining convection. However, the convection associated with the system began to organize when it entered the Pacific, and it strengthened into a tropical depression on August 29, while located 300 miles (485 km) south-southeast of Acapulco, Mexico. Later that day the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Kristy, based on ship reports of tropical storm force winds. Kristy strengthened into a hurricane on August 31, based solely on satellite imagery. Hurricane Kristy had short lifespan though, and weakened to a tropical storm on September 2. The easterly shear associated with an anticyclone south of Baja California, which caused Kristy's convection to be forced west of the low-level center of the system, and therefore weakened it. Kristy weakened further to a depression on September 3, and weak steering currents allowed the cyclone to remain stationary on September 4, loop the following day, and then began to move eastward. The depression dissipated on September 6, weakening to a low-level swirl. Kristy caused heavy rains and flooding in the Mexican states of Chiapas and Oaxaca.\n\nAlthough the storm passed relatively close to the coast, no tropical cyclone warnings and watches were required as the storm remained offshore. However, Kristy produced heavy rains and widespread flooding in the Mexican states of Chiapas and Oaxaca; as a result, several rivers overflowed their banks. Thousands of tourists were stranded from the beaches. At least 21 deaths were attributed to Kristy: 16 in Oaxaca and 5 in Chiapas. More than 20,000 people in the former were evacuated from their homes; consequently, a state of emergency was declared. The outer rainbands of Kristy delayed the rescue of the victims of a Brazilian-made aircraft that crashed west of the Sierra Madre Occidental mountain range. No official damage figures were reported by the Mexican government.\nThe remnants of Hurricane Debby moved over the mountainous areas of Mexico, passing into the Pacific from the Pacific coast of Mexico near Manzanillo. The disturbance moved towards the north-northwest and organized into a tropical depression on September 6 just south of the Gulf of California. The cyclone remained stationary due to weak low-level steering currents, later drifting to the north-northwest with an area of deep convection causing rain on the Mexican coast. It later moved to the northwest, with partial exposure of the center of the system, and with some shear still affecting it.\nThe cyclone continued to have shear over the system, which caused it not to strengthen, and its movement became nearly stationary. After remaining stationary longer, the system dissipated as a low-level swirl.\n\nA disturbance organized, and based on satellite imagery it strengthened into a tropical depression on September 12. The center of circulation remained on the eastern fringe of its deep convection and the storm moved west or west-northwestward. On September 13, the depression underwent shearing, while its low-level circulation center had only a small amount of deep convection associated with it.\nThe cyclone became poorly defined, and its movement turned stationary on September 14. The low-level circulation of the system remained visible, even though it weakened due to shearing. Little deep convection remained associated with the system, and the cyclone stayed stationary. The depression having no remaining convection and having become just a low-level cloud swirl, dissipated on September 15.\n\nA tropical depression formed on September 21 as an area of deep convection. The cyclone organized slowly though, drifting slowly, initially west then to the northwest. However, the depression recurved northeast, due to a trough. As the cyclone moved northeast, the system strengthened as indicated by an Air Force reconnaissance plane showing tropical storm force winds. It therefore intensified into Tropical Storm Wila on September 25. Wila, however, weakened within a day, and therefore became a tropical depression. The remnant low of Wila produced some heavy rain over the Hawaiian Islands on September 26 and 27.\n\nA wave moved westward off the coast of Africa, passed through the Caribbean Sea, and into the ITCZ of the eastern Pacific on September 20. The system developed organized deep convection, and strengthened into a tropical depression on September 21, while 300 miles (485 km) southeast of Acapulco, Mexico. As the low-level circulation organized further in the depression it intensified into Tropical Storm Lane, later on September 21. Lane developed further with an upper-level outflow pattern, and the cyclone turned into a hurricane on September 23. Later on September 23 and on September 24, an eye appeared on satellite imagery. A trough to the northwest of Lane disturbed its upper-level outflow on September 24. Diminishing convection and loss of its eye caused Lane to weaken to a tropical storm on September 27, and into a depression on September 28. Later on September 28, the cyclone moved into cooler waters and Lane lost nearly all of its deep convection. It weakened into a low-level swirl, and Lane dissipated on September 30. Lane caused no reported casualties or damage.\n\nThe remnants of Atlantic basin Tropical Storm Isaac moved into the eastern Pacific. These remnants underwent better organization and strengthened into a tropical depression on October 11 south of Baja California. Strong vertical southwesterly wind shear affected the cyclone, with the center of circulation later seen on the west side of the lessening amount of deep convection. The system remained poorly organized and had trouble strengthening to this continual poor organization as it moved westward.\nThe system could not be located on satellite imagery and therefore dissipated on October 12.\nAtlantic hurricane, Hurricane Joan survived the passage over Central America and entered the Pacific, although greatly weakened. Following the policy at the time, Joan was renamed Miriam.\n\nMiriam brought heavy rains to parts of Central America. Isolated flooding and mudslides happened, although casualties and damage reports are not available. of rain fell in Kantunilkin/Lazaro Cardenas, Mexico as a result of Miriam and the former Joan. Guatemala's ports along its Pacific coast were closed and people in El Salvador were evacuated from low-lying areas due to the storm. Miriam then turned away from Central America and weakened to a depression. The depression survived for over a week until it dissipated on October 30. Tropical Depression Miriam's remnants regenerated the next day, and Miriam finally dissipated on November 2.\n\nThe following names were used to name storms that formed in the northeastern Pacific Ocean during 1988. Retired names, were announced by the World Meteorological Organization in the spring of 1989. The names not retired from this list were used again in the 1994 season. This is the same list used in the 1982 season.\n\nFor storms that form in the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility, encompassing the area between 140 degrees west and the International Date Line, all names are used in a series of four rotating lists. The next four names that were slated for use in 1988 are shown below.\n\nThe World Meteorological Organization retired one name in the spring of 1989: Iva. It was replaced with Ileana for the 1994 Pacific hurricane season.\n\nThis is a table of all of the storms that have formed in the 1988 Pacific hurricane season. It includes their duration, names, landfall(s), denoted in parenthesis, damages, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all of the damage figures are in 1988 USD.\n\n\n"}

They are part of the Sermon on the Mount, and is one of a series of metaphors often seen as adding to the Beatitudes. The previous verse compared the disciples to a City upon a Hill that can't be hidden. These verses present a similar analogy.\n\nIn the King James Version of the Bible the text reads:\n\nThe World English Bible translates the passage as:\n\nFor a collection of other versions see BibleGateway Matthew 5:15-16\n\nThe KJV translation of bushel is more literal. R. T. France reports that a bushel was a measure of grain equivalent to about nine litres. One cannot put a unit of measure on top of something, so the word is generally seen as an expression for a bowl or container holding this amount. The WEB uses this more figurative translation. David Hill in the New Century Bible Commentary notes that this might be a reference to the hiding of the Hanukkah lamp to protect it from desecration. Eduard Schweizer notes that at this time almost all houses would have only had one room, so a single lamp is all that would have been needed to shine on all inhabitants.\n\nFrance notes that as with , the science in this verse is somewhat shaky. He notes that a lamp could not be hidden under a bowl as it would be rapidly extinguished by the lack of oxygen. Schweizer disagrees with this view. He feels that the metaphor is on how one would not light a lamp simply to put it out. He feels that a bowl would be a standard device to extinguish a lamp without generating smoke.\n\nThis verse is paralleled in and . Hill notes that there is an important difference between Luke and Matthew's versions. In Matthew the lamp shines on all who are in the house, implying conversion from within the community, Luke has the lamp shining for those who come into the house, implying new people joining the community.\n\nSt. Augustine linked this verse to , and the two have been closely associated ever since, despite the somewhat different meanings of the two verses.\n\nLike the previous two verses, Clarke notes that this one has appeared prominently in history and culture. Charlemagne cited it as the reason for building a series of schools and universities across his empire. It inspired the popular Victorian era hymn \"Jesus Bids us Shine\" and the still popular song \"This Little Light of Mine\". The verse also appears in several major works of literature including James Fenimore Cooper's \"The Pioneers\" and Thomas Hardy's \"Far from the Madding Crowd\". In James Joyce's \"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\", a character is described as \"shining quietly under a bushel of Wicklow bran\".\n\nHill notes that Father in heaven is a favourite expression of the author of Matthew's, occurring twenty times in his gospel, which could be a version of the common Old Testament phrase God of Israel, but with Israel replaced with heaven to show the wider application of the new message. Schweizer notes that the light is intended to shine towards people in general, also emphasizing the universal mission.\n\n"}
{"id": "2187803", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2187803", "title": "Battle of Jankau", "text": "Battle of Jankau\n\nThe Battle of Jankau, also known as Jankov, Jankow, or Jankowitz, took place in central Bohemia, on 6 March, 1645. One of the last major battles of the 1618 to 1648 Thirty Years War, it was fought between Swedish and Imperial armies, each containing around 16,000 men.\n\nThe more mobile and better led Swedes under Lennart Torstensson effectively destroyed their opponents, commanded by Melchior von Hatzfeldt. However, by this stage of the war, the devastated countryside forced armies to spend much of their time trying to support themselves, and the Swedes were unable to take advantage. \n\nBy 1646, the Imperialists had regained control of Bohemia; combined with inconclusive campaigns in the Rhineland and Saxony, it was clear a military solution was no longer possible. Fighting continued, as the different Powers tried to improve their positions, but it increased the urgency of negotiations leading to the 1648 Peace of Westphalia. \n\nThe Thirty Years War began in 1618 when the Protestant dominated Bohemian Estates offered the Crown to fellow Protestant Frederick of the Palatinate, rather than conservative Catholic Emperor Ferdinand II. Most members of the Holy Roman Empire remained neutral, and the revolt was quickly suppressed. An army of the Catholic League, dominated by Bavarians, then invaded the Palatinate and sent Frederick into exile. \n\nHis replacement by the Catholic Maximilian of Bavaria changed the nature and extent of the war. It drew in Protestant German states like Saxony and Brandenburg-Prussia, as well as external powers like Denmark-Norway. In 1630, Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden invaded Pomerania, partly to support his Protestant co-religionists, but also to control the Baltic trade, which provided much of Sweden's income. \n\nEconomic factors meant Swedish intervention continued after Gustavus was killed in 1632, but conflicted with states within the Empire, including Saxony, and regional rivals, such as Denmark. Most of Sweden's German allies made peace in the 1635 Treaty of Prague. The war lost much of its religious nature, and changed into a contest between the Empire and Sweden, who was supported by France, and George Rákóczi, Prince of Transylvania. \n\nIn 1637, Ferdinand III succeeded his father; he began peace talks in 1643, then delayed negotiations, pending a 1644 military offensive. This was unsuccessful; the Swedes defeated the Danes, who had re-entered the war as an Imperial ally, then destroyed an Imperial army in Saxony. Despite victory at Freiburg in August, the Bavarians under Franz von Mercy could not prevent French troops capturing Philippsburg, and occupying Lorraine. Mercy withdrew into Franconia, establishing winter quarters at Heilbronn. \n\nFor 1645, Swedish commander Lennart Torstensson proposed a three-part offensive, intended to compel Ferdinand III to agree terms. It envisaged three simultaneous attacks, in order to prevent Imperial forces supporting each other. While France attacked Bavaria, Torstensson would lead his army into Bohemia; they would be joined here by Rákóczi, and their combined force would then move against the Imperial capital, Vienna. \n\nWhile the armies in Bohemia were roughly equal in numbers, the Swedes were far better integrated, and led; despite poor health, Torstensson was an energetic and experienced general, with capable officers. Although Von Hatzfeldt was competent, he lacked the ability to control his subordinates, Von Götzen, and Von Werth. In addition, many of his troops were poorly equipped remnants from defeated armies, his best unit being 5,000 veteran Bavarian cavalry under von Werth.\n\nIn late January, Torstensson took advantage of the frozen ground to enter Bohemia, near Chomutov. The Imperial army had established winter quarters near Plzeň; unsure of Swedish intentions, von Hatzfeldt held his position to protect Prague. On 18 February, the Swedes passed to the west, and the two sides spent the next three weeks tracking each other along either side of the Vltava river. In early March, a sudden freeze allowed Torstensson to cross near Staré Sedlo; von Hatzfeldt followed, reaching Tábor on 4 March, where he made contact with Swedish cavalry. On 5 March, he withdrew to the hills around Jankov, and prepared for battle the next day. \n\nHatzfeldt selected a strong position; the hills and woods negated the superior Swedish artillery, his centre was protected by a stream, the right by a steep slope and deep forest. His left was the most vulnerable, with open ground directly to its front, overlooked by a hill to the south, known as 'Kappellhodjen' or Chapel Hill. In a conference the night before, Torstensson and his senior officers recognised the drawbacks, but agreed to an assault; their co-ordinated attack contrasted with command failures among the Imperial generals.\n\nThe battle consisted of two parts, the first from dawn to midday, the second from early afternoon until nightfall. Around 6:00 am, a Swedish column under Robert Douglas feinted against the Imperial right, while their main force moved around their left. After ordering Götzen to post a detachment on Chapel Hill, Hatzfeldt set off to assess Douglas' move, which he correctly deduced was a diversion. On his return, he discovered Götzen had misinterpreted his orders, moving his entire force towards the hill; it became stuck in the woods and broken ground, giving the Swedes time to install artillery and infantry at the crest. After a furious argument, Götzen launched a series of attacks, which were repulsed with heavy loss; just after 0915, he was killed, and his troops withdrew. \n\nHatzfeldt moved troops from the centre to cover the retreat of Götzen's men, but unlike the lighter Swedish guns, their artillery got stuck in the mud, and were captured by Arvid Wittenberg. Cavalry charges led by Werth kept the Swedes at a safe distance, and the two armies broke contact just before midday. His objective of clearing the road to Olomouc achieved, and hoping to re-organise his exhausted troops prior to setting off, Torstensson decided to end operations, and allow the Imperials to withdraw. \n\nHowever, Hatzfeldt felt the Swedes were too close for him to retreat in safety, and opted to hold his position until nightfall. Seeing this, Torstensson moved his guns forward, firing at close range into the helpless Imperial infantry. Werth charged and scattered the Swedish right, before his cavalry stopped to loot the baggage train, where they capturing Torstensson's wife. The Swedish cavalry reformed and counter-attacked, inflicting heavy casualties; only 1,500 of the 5,000 Bavarians made it back to Munich. Left isolated, the infantry surrendered, with 4,450 taken prisoner, including Hatzfeldt. In addition, his army suffered 5,000 casualties; less than 3,000 men from the 36 infantry regiments involved were present in Prague a week later. The Swedes had around 4,000 casualties.\n\nHearing of the defeat, Ferdinand and his brother Archduke Leopold quickly scraped together another army; by early May, Leopold had around 15,000 men. Although it could not match the Swedish veterans, 25 years of constant war had devastated the countryside; armies spent more time foraging, than fighting, drastically reducing their ability to sustain campaigns, or maintain positions. \n\nThis forced Torstensson into an attempt on the strategically placed town of Brno, which had an Imperial garrison of 1,500 under de Souches, a French Protestant exile. The Swedes were joined there by 14,200 Transylvanian troops; mostly unpaid and unfed, this worsened the supply issues, and the besiegers lost over 8,000 men, from disease, hunger, and desertion. With the opening of the 1645 to 1669 Cretan War, the Ottomans withdrew their support from Rákóczi; in return, Ferdinand renewed the Peace of Zsitvatorok, forcing the Transylvanians to make peace, and lifting the siege of Brno. \n\nThe end of the Danish war in favour of Sweden encouraged Torstensson to make one last attempt on Vienna, but by October, fewer than 10,000 Swedes faced 20,000 Imperialists. He retreated into Saxony, and relinquished command to Wrangel on 23 December; by February 1646, the Swedes had been totally expelled from Bohemia. \n\nHowever, Ferdinand could not also support his allies in Bavaria and Saxony. While the French campaign in Bavaria ended in stalemate, Torstensson's three part strategy finally proved its worth when Königsmarck burst into Saxony; without hope of reinforcement, Elector John George agreed a six month truce in September 1645. Accepting a military solution was no longer possible, Ferdinand instructed his representatives at Westphalia to begin serious negotiations.\n\n"}

This is the only Hindu Temple in Kerala where a Theyyam performance is a daily ritual offering.\n\nTradition has it that for the Annual Festival, Ulsavam, of the Muthappan Temple at Parassinikkadavu to start, a procession led by a female member of the \"Thayyil\" clan of Thayyil, Kannur begins from the family home and terminates at the main altar of the temple with a 'pooja' (prayer) to the Gods.\n\nParassinkkadavu is also noted for the Parassinikkadavu Snake Park which is committed to the preservation and conservation of snakes. There are about 150 varieties of snakes including the spectacled cobra, King cobra, Russell's viper, Krait and Pit Viper living in the park.\n\nA research laboratory to extract venom from snakes is proposed here. The park also has a large collection of non-poisonous snakes including pythons.\n\nVismaya Water Theme park is situated at Parassinikkadavu\n\nSeveral Muthappan Temples are seen in different parts of Kodagu, Kannur and Kasaragod districts. This shows the popularity of the God in the minds of the people of these districts. Each madappura has its own tradition. One interesting story relating to the God Muthappan is about the Nileshwar Muthappan Madappura.\n\nThe Sree Muthappan temple near National Highway No 17 in Nileshwar has a rich heritage. It indicates philosophical, devotional and educational importance of Nileshwar. There is an interesting story regarding the construction of Sree Muthappan Temple. An elder member of the Koroth family regularly visited the place now known as the Muthappan temple and drank madhu, a kind of intoxicating drink. He was a famous scholar and got the title Ezhuthachan for his commendable achievement as a teacher. Before drinking madhu, as a devotee he poured several drops of madhu on the nearby jackfruit tree as an offering for the god Muthappan. He regularly repeated the practice. Several years after the death of the above-mentioned scholar the natives found serious problems and they called upon an astrologer for assistance. The astrologer reveal that as a result of the regular practice of giving madhu to the god Muthappan, the God started residing there. After the death of the scholar, he did not get the madhu, and piqued, he started creating disturbances in the area. To placate him, the natives erected a Muthappan temple there. Koroth family got the right of Koymma [ patron] in the temple.\n\nAs a result of the formation of a committee and the great work done by the members of the committee the temple became famous, and daily hundreds of people visited there. There is a strong belief that the God will cure all diseases and will give prosperity to the devotees. The devotees will get Payakutti from the temple and stood developing as a great temple like the Sree Muthappan temple at Parassini kadavu.\n\n\n"}

The add-on begins its story after the events pictured in \"Sin\", replacing the villain Elexis Sinclaire (who went missing due to mysterious circumstances) with Mafia boss Gianni Manero, and once again letting players enter Freeport City in John R. Blade's shoes.\n\nWhile keeping the interactivity level and the real-world level design of the original game, \"Wages of Sin\" adds a few extra elements beyond the standard weapons and enemies upgrade. \"Wages of Sin\" features new enemies, locations and weapons, as well as items like the flashlight, nightvision goggles and ropes. A multiplayer game type called Hoverbike deathmatch is also included in the game.\n\nAfter Elexis Sinclaire disappeared at the end of \"Sin\", \"Wages of Sin\" continues the storyline by introducing the new villain Gianni Manero, a mob boss who seeks to gain power from the leftovers of Elexis' former company SinTEK. Manero produces new genetically engineered creatures (mutants) under secret supervision, but when some of these mutants break out and run into the city, the elite security force group HARDCORPS becomes aware of them and it's up to HARDCORPS leader John Blade, who starred as the hero and the player's character in \"Sin\", to set things right. Blade's hunt for Manero leads him to new locations of Freeport City that were not included in the original game, features new enemies and weapons, and has such interesting story/gameplay elements as the kidnapping of a scientist's daughter and day/night scenarios of the same levels, depending on the player's choice.\n\nAlthough Elexis Sinclaire never appears in \"Wages of Sin\", there are lots of references to her (in serious and humorous ways) throughout the game and the ending leaves a big hint towards her return (which happens in \"Sin's\" official sequel, \"SiN Episodes\").\n\n\"Wages of Sin\" is an add-on utilizing the same technology the original game is based on. However, great attention to detail and interactivity was kept when 2015 designed \"Wages of Sin\", resulting in even more options and visual treats than \"Sin\" could offer. Also, the locations the player character visits greatly expand the Freeport City experience started in \"Sin\", and because \"Sin\" moves out of Freeport at about halfway through the story, the add-on bases the whole adventure in the city and lets the player visit such locales as a cargo ship, a vacant building, a nightclub and Manero's casino and penthouse complex.\n\nMany special effects are impressive even today, such as a spider emerging from the body of a shot mutant or the earthshaking fireball explosion of the IP36 nuclear rocket launcher.\n\nOn the audio side there is some new music, new sound effects and brand-new voice acting from the same actors who voiced \"Sin\", plus some new voices (like Manero's) specifically for this add-on.\n\nGame Revolution gave it a B rating, writing \"As an add-on, \"Wages of Sin\" is great. Unfortunately, was \"Sin\" ever that good to begin with? I found it to get stale quickly and almost tediously repetitive as time went on, lacking both the sharpness and polish of games like \"Half-Life\", which took the Quake 2 engine to new untold highs. Wages of Sin is still good, but it expands on that flawed base, like a rose growing from soil that was not blessed with Miracle Grow\". GameSpot was also mostly positive in their review, which stated \"Despite the sound problem and the other minor issues, however, \"Wages of Sin\" is a very impressive first-person shooter. If you held onto your copy of \"Sin\" and resisted the urge to return it before the patch came out, you should definitely give this mission pack a try. It's not a groundbreaking game experience, but it is a fast-paced, action-packed first-person romp that hearkens back to the classics of the genre.\"\n\n"}

The area of the district is 33.4 km. The district is second only in size to Blue Hill, and includes the settlement of Hutt's Gate, with its St Matthew's church. The district also contains the island's only golf course.\n\nThe district contains Prosperous Bay Plain, which is where Saint Helena Airport is located.\n\nThere is a weather recording station in the Longwood district. Readings of temperature, air pressure and visibility are automatically taken and communicated every 3 hours.\n\nOn leaving the University of Oxford, in 1676, Edmond Halley visited Saint Helena and set up an observatory with a aerial telescope with the intention of studying stars from the Southern Hemisphere. The site of this telescope is near St Matthew's church in the district. The hill there is named for him and is called Halley's Mount.\n\nHalley's Observatory was in use from 1677–1678. Having returned to England in 1678, Halley published \"Catalogus Stellarum Australium\" in 1679, which included details of 341 southern stars. These additions to present-day star maps earned him comparison to Tycho Brahe. Halley was subsequently awarded his Master's from Oxford and Fellowship of the Royal Society.\n\nIn 1686, Halley published the second part of the results from his Helenian expedition, being a paper and chart on trade winds and monsoons. In this, he identified solar heating as the cause of atmospheric motions. He also established the relationship between barometric pressure and height above sea level. His charts were an important contribution to the emerging field of information visualisation.\n\nIn the 19th/early 20th centuries, an observatory (in use 1840–1849) was situated in Longwood village and two further observatories were erected in the Hutt's Gate area: one in use from 1892–1924 and the second in use from 1925–1975.\n\nIt was the location of Napoleon's second exile from 1815 until his death on 5 May 1821. France owns Briars Pavilion, Napoleon's initial exile residence, Longwood House and its properties, where he lived during most of his time on the island, and his original grave, but the United Kingdom retains ultimate sovereignty over these properties. Napoleon's main physician, Barry O'Meara, wrote letters describing the issues of Napoleon and his entourage while in captivity, and sent them clandestinely to a friend at the Admiralty in London.\n\nAs opposed to the hot and arid Jamestown being near sea level, Longwood is located about 500 metres above sea level . Being one of the island's highest settlements, Longwood experiences a cooler variation of the warm-summer mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: Csb), bordering on a subtropical highland climate (Köppen climate classification: Cfb) due to its persistent mild temperatures and consistent precipitation levels. Due to its elevated geography, the town has abundant vegetation. \n\n"}

It is used in conjunction with the DiSEqC 1.2 protocol. It was developed by STAB, an Italian motor manufacturer, who still make the majority of USALS compatible motors.\n\nSoftware on the satellite receiver (or external positioner) calculates the position of all available satellites from an initial location (input by the user), which is the latitude and longitude relative to Earth. Calculated positions can differ ±0.1 degrees from the offset. This is adjusted automatically and does not require previous technical knowledge.\n\nCompared to DiSEqC 1.2, it is not necessary to manually search and store every known satellite position. Pointing to a known satellite position (for example 19.2ºE) is enough; this position will act as the central point, and the USALS system will then calculate visible satellites position within the offset.\n\nReceivers are aligned to the satellite most southern to their position in the northern hemisphere, or the northernmost in the southern hemisphere.\n\nAs it is not an open standard, for a receiver to carry the USALS logo it must undergo a certification test by STAB's laboratories. If successful the manufacturer can include a USALS settings entry in its own menu, as well as place the logo on the front of their unit. However, a large number of manufacturers of both receivers and motors provide compatible modes which have not received certification, leading to use of unofficial terms.\n\nUSALS is a program and not a communication protocol. The USALS calculates the dish angular position given by the dish longitude/latitude and the position of the satellite in geostationary orbit. It then sends the angular position to the positioner using the DiSEqC 1.2 protocol. This calculation is straight on using geometric calculations.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2187822", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2187822", "title": "Gallican Rite", "text": "Gallican Rite\n\nThe Gallican Rite is a historical version of Christian liturgy and other ritual practices in Western Christianity. It is not a single rite but a family of rites within the Latin Church, which comprised the majority use of most of Western Christianity for the greater part of the 1st millennium AD. The rites first developed in the early centuries as the Syriac-Greek rites of Jerusalem and Antioch and were first translated into Latin in various parts of the Western Roman Empire Praetorian prefecture of Gaul. By the 5th century, it was well established in the Roman civil diocese of Gaul, an early center of Christianity. Ireland too is known to have had a form of this Gallican Liturgy mixed with Celtic customs.\n\nThe Gallican Rite was used from before the 5th century, and likely prior to the Diocletian reform in AD 293 Roman Gaul, until the middle or end of the 8th century. There is no information before the 5th century and very little then; and throughout the whole period there was, to judge by existing documents and descriptions, so much diversity that, though the general outlines of the rite were of the same pattern, the name must not be taken to imply more than a very moderate amount of homogeneity. The Rite of Iberia was used from the 5th century in Roman provinces within the Roman civil diocese of Hispania to the end of the 11th century, and lingered as an archaeological survival in chapels at Toledo and Salamanca. It was so nearly allied to the Gallican Rite that the term Hispano-Gallican is often applied to the two. But the Iberian Mozarabic Rite has, like the allied Celtic Rite, enough of an independent history to require separate treatment, so that though it will be necessary to allude to both by way of illustration, this article will be devoted primarily to the rite once used in what is now France. Of the origin of the Gallican Rite there are three principal theories, between two of which the controversy is not yet settled. These theories may be termed: the Ephesine, the Ambrosian, and the Roman.\n\nThe Ephesine theory, first put forward by William Palmer in \"Origines Liturgicae\", was once very popular among Anglican scholars. According to it the Gallican Rite went back to one brought to Lyon from Ephesus by St. Pothinus and Irenaeus, who had received it through Polycarp from John of Patmos. The idea originated partly in a statement in the 8th-century tract in a manuscript, which refers the Service of the Gauls (\"Cursus Gallorum\") to such an origin, and partly in a statement of Colmán of Lindisfarne at the Synod of Whitby (664) respecting the Johannine origin of the Quartodeciman Easter. This theory \"may be dismissed as practically disproved,\" according to Henry Jenner, in \"Catholic Encyclopedia\".\n\nThe second theory is that which Louis Duchesne puts forward in place of the Ephesine. He holds that Milan, not Lugdunum (Lyon), was the principal centre of Gallican development. He lays great stress on the incontestable importance of Mediolanum (Milan) as the capital of the Western Roman Empire from 286 to 402 and of the Church of Milan in the late 4th century, and conjectures that a liturgy of Oriental origin, introduced perhaps by Auxentius the Arian bishop of Milan from 355 to 374, spread from the capital city, Mediolanum, to the Roman provinces in Gaul, Hispania, and Britannia. Duchesne points out that \"the Gallican Liturgy in the features which distinguish it from the Roman, betrays all the characteristics of the Eastern Orthodox liturgies,\" and that \"some of its formularies are to be found word for word in the Greek Orthodox texts which were in use in the Churches of the Syro-Byzantine Rite either in the fourth century or somewhat later,\" and infers from this that, \"the Gallican Liturgy is an Oriental liturgy, introduced into the West towards the middle of the fourth century.\" Duchesne does not, however, note that in certain other important peculiarities the Gallican Liturgy agrees with the Roman where the latter differs from the Oriental. Controverting the third or Roman theory of origin, he stresses that Pope Innocent I (416) in a letter to Decentius, bishop of Gubbio, spoke of usages which Duchesne recognizes as Gallican (e.g. the position of the Diptychs and the Pax) as \"foreign importations\" and did not recognize in them the ancient usage of his own Church, and he thinks it hard to explain why the African Church should have accepted the Roman reforms, while Ambrose himself a Roman, refused them. He assumes that the Ambrosian Rite is not really Roman, but Gallican, much Romanized at a later period, and that the Gubbio variations of which Innocent I complained were borrowed from Milan.\n\nThe third theory is perhaps rather complicated to state without danger of misrepresentation, and has not been so definitely stated as the other two by any one writer. It is held in part by Milanese liturgists and by many others whose opinion is of weight. In order to state it clearly it will be necessary to point out first certain details in which all the Latin or Western rites agree with one another in differing from the Eastern, and in this we speak only of the Mass, which is of far more importance than either the canonical hours or the occasional services in determining origins.\n\nThe Eastern Eucharists of whatever rite are marked by the invariability of the priest's part. There are, it is true, alternative anaphoras which are used either \"ad libitum\", as in the Syro-Jacobite Rite, or on certain days, as in Byzantine and East Syrian, but they are complete in themselves and do not contain passages appropriate to the day. The lections of course vary with the day in all rites, and varying antiphons, troparia, etc., are sung by the choir; but the priest's part remains fixed.\n\nIn the Western rites – whether Hispano-Gallican, Ambrosian, or Roman – a very large proportion of the priest's part varies according to the day, and these variations are so numerous in the Gallican Rite that the fixed part, even of the Prayer of the Consecration, is strangely little. Certain varying prayers of the Hispano-Gallican Rite have a tendency to fall into couples, a Bidding Prayer, or invitation to pray, sometimes of considerable length and often partaking of the nature of a homily, addressed to the congregation, and a collect embodying the suggestions of the Bidding Prayer, addressed to God. These Bidding Prayers have survived in the Roman Rite in the Good Friday intercessory prayers, and they occur in a form borrowed later from the Gallican in the ordination services, but in general the invitation to prayer is reduced to its lowest terms in the word \"Oremus\".\n\nAnother Western peculiarity is in the form of the Words of Institution. The principal Eastern liturgies follow Paul the Apostle's words in the First Epistle to the Corinthians () and date the Institution by the betrayal, and of the less important anaphoras, most either use the same expression or paraphrase it. The Western liturgies date from the Passion, \"Qui pridie quam pateretur\", for which, though of course the fact is found there, there is no verbal Scriptural warrant. The Mozarabic of today uses the Pauline words, and no Gallican Recital of the Institution remains in full; but in both the prayer that follows is called (with alternative nomenclature in the Gallican) post-\"Pridie\" and the catchwords \"\"Qui pridie\"\" come at the end of the post-\"Sanctus\" in the Gallican Masses, so that it is clear that this form existed in both.\n\nThese variations from the Eastern usages are of an early date, and it is inferred from them, and from other considerations more historical than liturgical, that a liturgy with these peculiarities was the common property of Gaul, Hispania, and Italy. Whether, as is most likely, it originated in Rome and spread thence to the countries under direct Roman influence, or whether it originated elsewhere and was adopted by Rome, there is no means of knowing. The adoption must have happened when liturgies were in rather a fluid state. The Gallicans may have carried to an extreme the changes begun at Rome, and may have retained some archaic features which had been later dropped by Rome. During the 4th century – it has been conjectured that it was in the papacy of Pope Damasus I (366–384) – liturgical reforms were made at Rome: the position of the Great Intercession and of the Pax were altered, the latter perhaps because the form of the dismissal of the catechumens was disused, and the distinction between the first part, the Mass of the Catechumens, and second part, the Mass of the Faithful, was no longer needed, and therefore the want was felt of a position with some meaning to it for the sign of Christian unity. The long and diffuse prayers were made into the short and crisp collects of the Roman type. It was then that the variable post-\"Sanctus\" and post-\"Pridie\" were altered into a fixed Canon of a type similar to the Roman Canon of today, though perhaps this Canon began with the clause which now reads \"\"Quam oblationem\"\", but according to the pseudo-Ambrosian tract \"De Sacramentis\" once read \"Fac nobis hanc oblationem\". This may have been introduced by a short, variable post-\"Sanctus\". This reform, possibly through the influence of Ambrose, was adopted at Milan, but not in Gaul and Hispania. At a still later period, during the 5th and 6th centuries, changes were again made at Rome, principally attributed to Pope Leo I, Pope Gelasius I, and Pope Gregory I; these three popes are the eponyms of three varying sacramentaries. These later reforms were not adopted at Milan which retained the books of the first reform, which are now known as Ambrosian.\n\nHence it may be seen that, roughly speaking, the Western or Latin Liturgy went through three phases, which may be called for want of better names the Gallican, the Ambrosian, and the Roman stages. The holders of the theory no doubt recognize that the demarcation between these stages is rather vague, and that the alterations were in many respects gradual. Of the three theories of origin, the Ephesine may be dismissed as practically disproved. To both of the other two the same objection may be urged, that they are largely founded on conjecture and on the critical examination of documents of a much later date than the periods to which the conjectures relate. But at present there is little else to go upon. It may be well to mention also a theory put forward by W. C. Bishop in \"Church Quarterly\" for July 1908, to the effect that the Gallican Liturgy was not introduced into Gaul from anywhere but was the original liturgy of that country, apparently invented and developed there. He speaks of an original independence of Rome (of course liturgically only) followed by later borrowings. This does not seem to exclude the idea that Rome and the West may have had the germ of the Western Rite in common. Again the theory is conjectural and is only very slightly stated in the article.\n\nThe later history of the Gallican Rite until the time of its abolition as a separate rite is obscure. In Hispania there was a definite centre in Toledo whose influence was felt over the whole peninsula, even after the coming of the Moors. Hence it was that the Hispanic Rite was much more regulated than the Gallican, and Toledo at times, though not very successfully, tried to give liturgical laws even to Gaul, though probably only to the Visigothic part of it. In the greater part of France there was liturgical anarchy. There was no capital to give laws to the whole country, and the rite developed there variously in different places, so that among the scanty fragments of the service-books that remain there is a marked absence of verbal uniformity, though the main outlines of the services are of the same type. Several councils attempted to regulate matters a little, but only for certain episcopal provinces. Among these were the Councils of Vannes (465), Agde (506), Vaison (529), Tours (567), Auxerre (578), and the two Councils of Mâcon (581, 623). But all along there went on a certain process of Romanization due to the constant applications to the Holy See for advice, and there is also another complication in the probable introduction during the 7th century, through Columbanus's missionaries, of elements of Irish origin.\n\nThe changes in the Roman Rite happened rather gradually during the course of the late 7th and 8th century, and seem synchronous with the rise of the Mayors of the Palace, and their development into kings of France. Nearly all the Gallican books of the later Merovingian period, which are all that are left, contain many Roman elements. In some cases there is reason to suppose that the Roman Canon was first introduced into an otherwise Gallican Mass, but the so-called Gelasian Sacramentary, the principal manuscript of which is attributed to the Abbey of St. Denis and the early 8th century, is an avowedly Roman book, though containing Gallican additions and adaptations. And the same may be said of what is left of the undoubtedly Frankish book known as the \"Missale Francorum\" of the same date. Duchesne attributes a good deal of this 8th-century Romanizing tendency to Boniface, though he shows that it had begun before his day.\n\nThe Roman Liturgy was adopted at Metz in the time of Chrodegang (742–66). The Roman chant was introduced about 760, and by a decree of Pepin of Herstal, Mayor of the Palace, quoted in Charlemagne's \"Admonitio generalis\" in 789, the Gallican chant was abolished in its favour. Pope Adrian I between 784 and 791 sent to Charlemagne at his own request a copy of what was considered to be the Gregorian Sacramentary, but which certainly represented the Roman use of the end of the 8th century. This book, which was far from complete, was edited and supplemented by the addition of a large amount of matter derived from the Gallican books and from the Roman book known as the Gelasian Sacramentary, which had been gradually supplanting the Gallican. It is probable that the editor was Alcuin of York, Charlemagne's principal liturgical advisor. Copies were distributed throughout Charlemagne's empire, and this \"composite liturgy\", as Duchesne describes, \"from its source in the Imperial chapel spread throughout all the churches of the Frankish Empire and at length, finding its way to Rome gradually supplanted there the ancient use.\" More than half a century later, when Charles the Bald wished to see what the ancient Gallican Rite had been like, it was necessary to import Hispanic priests to celebrate it in his presence. Subsequently with the Normans the Gallican rite in the Kingdom of Sicily is the official liturgy.\n\nThe name \"Gallican\" has also been applied to two other uses:\n\nThese have nothing to do with the ancient Gallican Rite.\n\nThere are no manuscripts of the Gallican Rite earlier than the later part of the 7th century, though the descriptions in the letters of Germain of Paris (555–76) take one back another century. The known manuscripts are:\n\n\"The Reichenau fragments\" are described in Léopold Victor Delisle's \"Mémoire sur d'anciens Sacramentaires\". They were discovered by Franz Mone in 1850 in a palimpsest manuscript from the Abbey of Reichenau, in the library of Karlsruhe. The manuscript, which is late 7th century, had belonged to (760–781). It contains eleven Masses of purely Gallican type, one of which is a Mass for the feast of Germanus of Auxerre, but the others do not specify any festival. One Mass is written entirely in hexameter verse, except for the post-\"Pridie\" which is prose.\n\nThe Peyron, Mai, and Bunsen fragments are disjointed palimpsest leaves. Those fragments which are eponyms of Cardinal Angelo Mai and were found in the \"Biblioteca Ambrosiana\" at Milan, and those fragments which are an eponym of Christian Charles Josias von Bunsen were found at the Abbey of Saint Gall. The Peyron fragment contains part of what looks like a Lenten \"Contestatio\" (Preface) with other prayers of Gallican type. The Bunsen fragment contains part of a Mass for the Dead (post-\"Sanctus\", post-\"Pridie\") and several pairs of Bidding Prayers and Collects, the former having the title \"Exhortatio\" or \"Exhortatio Matutina\". The Mai fragments begin with part of a Bidding Prayer and contain a fragment of a Contestatio, with that title, and fragments of other prayers, two of which have the title \"Post Nomina\", and two others which seem to be prayers \"ad Pacem\".\n\nThe \"Missale Gallicanum Vetus\" (\"Gallicanum\"), described by Delisle, is a manuscript dating from the end of the 7th, or the early part of the 8th. Only a fragment, it begins with a Mass for the feast of Germanus of Auxerre, after which come prayers for the Blessing of Virgins and Widows, two Advent Masses, the Christmas Eve Mass, the \"expositio symboli\" and \"traditio symboli\" and other ceremonies preparatory to Baptism; also the Maundy Thursday, Good Friday and Easter Sunday ceremonies and the baptismal service, Masses for the Sundays after Easter up to the Rogation Mass, where the manuscript breaks off. Masses, as in \"Gothicum\", are Gallican in order with many Roman prayers. The Good Friday prayers are, with a few verbal variations, exactly as those in the Roman Missal.\n\n\"Missale Gothicum\" (\"Gothicum\"), described by Delisle, is a manuscript dating from the end of the 7th century and once belonging to the Petau Library. The name is due to a 15th-century note at the beginning of the book, and hence it has been attributed by Tommasi and Jean Mabillon to Narbonne, which was in the Visigothic Kingdom. Duchesne, judging by the inclusion of Masses for the feast of Symphorian and the feast of Leodegar (d. 680), attributes it to Autun. Masses are numbered, the manuscript beginning with Christmas Eve which is numbered III. Probably there were once two Advent Masses, as in \"Gallicanum\". There are eighty-one numbered sections, of which the last is the first prayer of \"Missa Romensif cottidiana\", with which the manuscript breaks off. The details of Masses in this book are given in the section of the present article on the liturgical year. Masses are all Gallican as to order, but many of the actual prayers are Roman.\n\n\"The Luxeuil Lectionary\" (Luxeuil) is a 7th-century manuscript discovered by Mabillon in the Abbey of Luxeuil, but because among its very few saints' days it contains the feast of Saint Genevieve, Germain Morin, it has been attributed to Paris. It contains the Prophetical Lessons, epistles, and Gospels for the year from Christmas Eve onwards. At the end are the lessons of a few special Masses, for the burial of a bishop, for the dedication of a church, when a bishop preaches, \"\"et plebs decimas reddat\"\", when a deacon is ordained, when a priest is blessed, \"\"in profectione itineris\"\", and \"\"lectiones cotidianae\"\". This lectionary is purely Gallican with no apparent Roman influence. The manuscript has not been printed in its entirety, but Mabillon, in \"De Liturgia Gallicana\", gives references to all the lessons and the beginnings and endings of the text.\n\n\"The Letters of St. Germanus of Paris\" are from a manuscript at Autun. There appears to be no reason to doubt that they are genuine. They contain mystical interpretations of the ceremonies of the Mass and of other services. Duchesne says of the descriptions, on which the interpretations are based, that \"We may reconstruct from the letters a kind of \"Ordo Gallicanus\"\".\n\nMuch side light is thrown on the Gallican Rite by the Celtic books, especially by the Stowe Missal and Bobbio Missal. The latter has been called Gallican and attributed to the Province of Besançon, but it is now held to be Irish in a much Romanized form, though of Continental provenance, being quite probably from the originally Irish Bobbio Abbey, where Mabillon found it. A comparison with the Ambrosian Liturgy and Rite may also be of service, while most lacunae in our knowledge of the Gallican Rite may reasonably be conjecturally filled up from the Mozarabic books, which even in their present form are those of substantially the same rite. There are also liturgical allusions in certain 5th and 6th century writers: Hilary of Poitiers, Sulpicius Severus, Caesarius of Arles, and especially Gregory of Tours, and some information may be gathered from the decrees of the Gallican councils mentioned above.\n\nThe above are all that exist as directly Gallican sources, but much information may also be gleaned from the books of the transition period, which, though substantially Roman, were much edited with Germanic tendencies and contained a large amount which was of a Gallican rather than a Roman type. The principal of these are as follows.\n\nThere are three extant manuscripts of the Gelasian Sacramentary, one at Vatican City, one at Zürich, and one at the Abbey of Saint Gall. The manuscripts are of the early 8th century. The groundwork is Roman, with Gallican additions and modifications. Evidence for the Gallican rites of ordination and some other matters is derived from this book.\n\nThe \"Missale Francorum\" (Vat. Reg. Lat. 257) is a fragment of a sacramentary similar to the Gelasian Sacramentary, though not identical with it.\n\nThere are many manuscripts of the Gregorian Sacramentary. It represents the sacramentary sent by Adrian I to Charlemagne, after it had been rearranged and supplemented by Gelasian and Gallican editions in France.\n\nThe Luxeuil Lectionary, \"Missale Gothicum\" and \"Missale Gallicum\", and the Gallican adaptations of the \"Martyrologium Hieronymianum\" are the chief authorities on this point, and to these may be added some information to be gathered from the regulations of the Council of Agde (506), Fourth Council of Orléans (541), Council of Tours (567), and Second Council of Mâcon (581), and from Gregory of Tours' \"Historia Francorum\", as to the Gallican practice in the 6th century.\n\nIt is probable that there were many variations in different times and places, and that the influence of the \"Martyrologium Hieronymianum\" brought about gradual assimilation to Rome. The year, as is usual, began with Advent. The Council of Mâcon arranged three fasting days a week during Advent and mentioned St. Martin's Day as the key-day for Advent Sunday, so that, as a present in the Mozarabic and Ambrosian Rites, there were six Sundays of Advent (but only two Advent Masses survive in \"Gallicanum\"). \"Gothicum\" and the Luxeuil Lectionary both begin with Christmas Eve.\n\nBoth books also have Commons of Martyrs and Confessors, the Luxeuil has Commons of bishops and deacons for a number of other Masses, and \"Gothicum\" has six Sunday Masses. \"Gallicanum\" has a Mass for the feast of Germanus of Auxerre before the two Advent Masses. In both \"Gothicum\" and \"Gallicanum\" a large space is given to the services of the two days before Easter, and in the latter the \"expositio symboli\" and \"traditio symboli\" are given at great length. The moveable feasts depended, of course, on Easter. When the Roman Church altered the Easter computation from the old 84-year-cycle to the new Victorius Aquitaine 532-year-cycle in 457, the Gallican Church, unlike the Celts, did the same; but when, in 525, the Roman Church adopted the Dionysius Exiguus 19-year-cycle, the Gallican Church continued to use the 532-year-cycle, until the end of the 8th or beginning of the 9th century. Lent began with the first Sunday, not with Ash Wednesday. There is a not very intelligible passage in the canons of the Council of Tours to the effect that all through August there were \"\"festivitates et missae sanctorum\"\", but this is not borne out by the existing sacramentaries or the Lectionary.\n\nThere is curiously little information on this point, and it is not possible to reconstruct the Gallican Divine Office from the scanty allusions that exist. It seems probable that there was considerable diversity in various times and places, though councils, both in Gaul and Hispania, tried to bring about some uniformity. The principal authorities are the Councils of Agde (506) and Tours (567) and allusions in the writings of Gregory of Tours and Caesarius of Arles. The general arrangement and nomenclature were very similar to those of the Celtic Rite. There were two principal services, Matins and Vespers; and four Lesser Hours, Prime, or \"ad Secundum\", Terce, Sext, and None; and probably two night services, Complin, or \"ad initium noctis\", and Nocturns.\n\nBut the application of these names is sometimes obscure. It is not quite clear whether Nocturns and Lauds were not joined together as Matins; Caesarius speaks of Prima, while \"Gallicanum\" speaks of \"ad Secundum\"; Caesarius distinguishes between \"Lucernarium\" and \"ad Duodeciman\", while Aurelian distinguishes between \"ad Duodeciman\" and \"Complin\"; \"Gothicum\" speaks of \"Vespera Paschae\" and \"Initium Noctis Paschae\", and \"Gallicanum\" has \"ad Duodeciman Paschae\". The distribution of the Psalter is not known. The Council of Tours orders six psalms at Sext and twelve \"ad Duodecimam\", with Alleluia (presumably as Antiphon). For Matins there is a curious arrangement which reminds one of that in the \"Rule of St. Columbanus\". Normally in summer (apparently from Easter to July) \"\"sex antiphonae binis psalmis\"\" are ordered. This evidently means twelve psalms, two under each antiphon. In August there seem to have been no psalms, because there were festivals and Masses of saints. \"\"Toto Augusto manicationes fiant, quia festivitates sunt et missae sanctorum\".\" The meaning of manicationes and of the whole statement is obscure. In September there were fourteen psalms, two under each antiphon; in October twenty-four psalms, three to each antiphon; and from December to Easter thirty psalms, three to each antiphon. Caesarius orders six psalms at Prime with the hymn \"\"Fulgentis auctor aetheris\"\", two lessons, one from the old and one from the New Testament, and a \"capitellum\"\"; six psalms at Terce, Sext, and None, with an antiphon, a hymn, a lesson, and a \"capitellum\"; at \"Lucernarium\" a \"Psalmus Directaneus\", whatever that may be (cf. \"\"Psalmus Directus\"\" of the Ambrosian Rite), two antiphons, a hymn, and a \"capitellum\"; and \"ad Duodecimam\", eighteen psalms, an antiphon, hymn, lesson, and \"capitellum\". From this it seems as though the office of \"Lucernarium\" and \"ad Duodecimam\" made up Vespers, combining the twelfth hour of the Divine Office (that is, of the recitation of the Psalter with its accompaniments) with a service for what, without any intention of levity, one may call \"lighting-up time\". The Ambrosian and Mozarabic Vespers are constructed on this principle, and so is the Byzantine Hesperinos.\n\nCaesarius mentions a blessing given by the bishop at the end of \"Lucernarium\", \"\"cumque expleto Lucernario benedictionem populo dedisset\"\". The rules of Caesarius and Aurelian both speak of two nocturns with lessons, which include on the feasts of martyrs lessons from their passions. They order \"Magnificat\" to be sung at Lauds and during the Paschal days, and \"Gloria in excelsis Deo\" sung on Sundays and greater festivals.\n\nThere is a short passage which throws a little light upon the Lyon use of the end of the 5th century in an account of the Council of Lyon in 499. The council, assembled by Gundobad, king of Burgundy, began on the This began with a lesson from the Pentateuch, . Then psalms were sung and a lesson was read from the prophets (,), more psalms and a lesson from the Gospels, or , and a lesson from the Pauline epistles, .\n\nAgobard, in the 9th century, mentions that at Lyon there were no canticles except from the Psalms, no hymns written by poets, and no lessons except from Scripture. Mabillon says that though in his day Lyon agreed with Rome in many things, especially in the distribution of the Psalter, and admitted lessons from the Acts of the Saints, there were still no hymns except at Complin, and he mentions a similar rule as to hymns at Vienne. But the 767 Council of Tours canon 23 allowed the use of the Ambrosian hymns. Though the Psalter of the second recension of Jerome, now used in all the churches of the Roman Rite except St. Peter's Basilica, Vatican City, is known as the \"Gallican\", while the older, is known as the \"Roman\", it does not seem that the Gallican Psalter was used even in Gaul until a comparatively later date, though it spread thence over nearly all the West. At present the Mozarabic and Ambrosian Psalters are variants of the \"Roman\", with peculiarities of their own. Probably the decadence of the Gallican Divine Office was very gradual. In an 8th-century manuscript tract, the \"Cursus Gallorum\" is distinguished from the \"Cursus Romanorum\", the \"Cursus Scottorum\" and the Ambrosian, all of which seem to have been going on then. The unknown writer, though his opinion is of no value on the origin of the \"cursus\", may well have known about some of these of his own knowledge; but through the 7th century there are indications of adoption of the Roman or the Monastic \"cursus\" instead of the Gallican, or to mix them up, a tendency which was resisted at times by provincial councils.\n\nThe chief authorities for the Gallican Mass are the letters of Saint Germanus of Paris (555–576), and by a comparison of these with the extant sacramentaries, not only of Gaul but of the Celtic Rite, with the Irish tracts on the Mass, with the books of the still existing Mozarabic Rite, and with the descriptions of the Hispanic Mass given by Isidore of Seville. One may arrive at a fairly clear and general idea of the service, though there exists no Gallican Ordinary of the Mass and no Antiphoner. Duchesne, in \"Origines du Culte chrétien\", gave a very full account constructed on this basis, though some will differ from him in his supplying certain details from Ambrosian books, and in his claiming the Bobbio Missal Sacramentary as Ambrosian rather than Celtic.\n\nJenner's analysis shows that the Gallican Mass contained a very small number of fixed elements and that nearly the whole service was variable according to the day. The absence of an Ordinary of the Mass is, therefore, of less importance than it would be in, for instance, the Roman Mass or the Ambrosian Mass. Thus the fixed parts of the service would only be: (a) the three Canticles, (b) the \"Ajus\" and \"Sanctus\", etc., at the Gospel, (c) the \"Prex,\" (d) the Dismissal, (e) the priest's prayers at the Offertory, (f) the Great Intercession, (g) the \"Pax\" formula, (h) the \"Sursum corda\" dialogue, (i) the \"Sanctus,\" (j) the Recital of the Institution, (k) the Lord's Prayer. Possibly fixed would be the \"Confractorium\", \"Trecanum\", and \"Communio\". and probably fixed would be the priest's devotions at Communion. Most of these are very short and only the most important passage wanting is the one fixed passage in the Prayer of Consecration, the Words of Institution.\n\nThe authorities for the Gallican Baptismal Service are \"Gothicum\" and \"Gallicanum\", both of which are incomplete, along with a few details in the second Letter of Germanus of Paris. The forms given in the Stowe Missal and the Bobbio Missal are too much Romanized to well illustrate the Gallican Rite. The form given in \"Gothicum\" is the least complete. \"Gallicanum\" has a much fuller form with the \"traditio symboli\" and \"expositio symboli\", etc.\n\nThe Holy Week ceremonies which are mixed with the Baptismal service in the two books are not very characteristic. The couplets of invitatory and collect which occur in the Roman Good Friday service are given with verbal variations in \"Gothicum\"; in both, however, there are other prayers of a similar type and prayers for some of the Hours of Good Friday and Easter Vigil. The Blessing of the Paschal Candle consists of a Bidding Prayer and collect (in \"Gothicum\" only), the \"Exsultet\" and its Preface nearly exactly as in the Roman, a \"Collectio post benedictionem cerei\", and \"Collectio post hymnum cerri\". There is no blessing of the new fire in either.\n\nThe Ordination services of the Gallican Rite do not occur in any of the avowedly Gallican books. They are found in the Gelasian Sacramentary and the \"Missale Francorum\". That is to say, a mixed form which does not agree with the more or less contemporary Roman form in the Leonine and Gregorian Sacramentaries, though it contains some Roman prayers, is found in these two books, and it may reasonably be inferred that the differences are of Gallican origin. Moreover, extracts relating to ceremonial are given with them from the \"Statuta Ecclesia Antiqua\", formerly attributed to the Fourth Council of Carthage, but now known to be a Gallican decree \"promulgated in the province of Arles towards the end of the 5th century\" (Duchesne).\n\nThe ceremonial contained therein agrees with that described in \"De Officiis Ecclesiasticis\" by Isidore of Seville. The forms of minor orders, including subdeacon, were very short, and consisted simply of the delivery of the instruments: keys to the porters; books of lectors and exorcists; cruets to acolytes; chalice, paten, basin, ewer and towel to subdeacons. Bidding Prayers and all are in the Roman Pontifical of today. In the ordination of deacons there is a form which is found in the Byzantine Rite but has not been adopted in the Roman Rite, the recognition by the people, after an address, with the cry of \"Dignus est!\" This is used for priests and bishops also, for example, the \"Axios\" acclamation in Byzantine ordinations. The Bidding Prayer and collect which follow are both in the present Roman Pontifical, though separated by much additional matter. The ordination of priests was of the same type as that of deacons, with the addition of the anointing of the hands. The address, with a varied end, and the collect (but not the Bidding Prayer), and the anointing of the hands with its formula are in the modern Roman Pontifical, but with very large additions. The consecration of bishops began, after an election, with a presentation and recognition, neither of which is in the modern Pontifical. Then followed a long Bidding Prayer, also not adopted in the Roman Rite, and the Consecration Prayer \"Deus omnium honorum\", part of which is embodied in the Preface in the Leonine and Gregorian Sacramentaries, and in the present Pontifical. During this prayer two bishops held the Book of the Gospels over the candidate, and all the bishops laid their hands on his head. Then followed the anointing of the hands, but apparently not of the head as in the modern rite, with a formula which is not in the Roman books.\n\nThe Consecration of a church does not occur in the recognized Gallican books and from prayers in the Gelasian Sacramentary and \"Missale Francorum\". Duchesne's analysis of both rites shows, in \"Christian worship\", that at a time when the Roman Rite of Consecration was exclusively funerary and contained little else but the deposition of the relics, as shown in the \"Ordines Romani\" in the Saint-Amand Abbey manuscript, the Gallican Rite resembled more closely that of the modern Pontifical, which may be presumed to have borrowed from it. A 9th century commentary on the ritual of a dedication, attributed by Edmond Martène to Remigius of Auxerre, and the 8th or 9th century Angoulême Sacramentary manuscript are the other authorities from which Duchesne derives his details. The order of the Celtic Consecration given in the An Leabhar Breac is very similar.\n\n\n"}

Lake Braddock opened in 1973. Its mascot is the bruin, and the school colors are purple and gold.\n\nWhen opened in 1973, adjacent to the namesake reservoir, Lake Braddock drew its students from nearby Robinson Secondary School to the west and West Springfield High School to the south. At first, Lake Braddock was built without walls in most of its educational areas, as it was believed by the administrators of the era that students would learn better in an open environment. When school officials realized a school without walls was distracting to teenage students, temporary walls were installed around many classrooms in the late 1970s and early 1980s. This resulted in significant climate control problems throughout the building, most of which were left unfixed until the school was renovated.\n\nBesides the \"open classroom\" approach, Lake Braddock, when it opened, also employed the \"Forecast Five\" approach, which was a \"school within a school\", or teams, of 150 students assigned to five teachers (math, English, science, social studies, special ed). On field trips, all 150 would go. These teams were later given names and colors.\n\nLake Braddock Secondary School is a fully accredited secondary school based on standardized testing in Virginia. The average SAT score of a LBSS 12th grader in the 2012–2013 school year was 1674.\n\nThe following table shows the passing rates of all Lake Braddock students in their respective years and academic subjects, as determined by the Virginia Department of Education.\n\nFor the 2012–13 school year, Lake Braddock's student body was 54.04% White, 19.24% Asian, 16.54% Hispanic, 5.93% African-American, and 4.25% of other races.\n\nThe Lake Braddock cross country team has won ten girls' state championships and three boys' state championships. Combined, these teams have more championship titles than any other Lake Braddock sport. Both the boys' and the girls' teams won the state title in 1987. The girls' team won the state title in 2009 and the boys' team received 4th place in the state. In 2010, the boys' team took back-to-back Patriot District championships and the girls won the Northern Region championship. Both teams competed in the 2012 Virginia State championships, with the girls' team winning by 82 points, and the boys' team placing fourth. In both 2014 and 2015, the boys' team won the 6A Patriot conference, 6A Northern Region, and 6A Virginia State Championships. The girls were state runner-ups in 2014 and champions in 2015. In 2017, the girls' team won the 6A Patriot District, with the boys as runners-up. The boys' team won the 6A Northern Region, with the girl as runners up, and both the girls' and boys' teams won the 6A Virginia State Championships.\n\nIn 1987 the girls' varsity soccer team became the first soccer team in Virginia to go undefeated and win the State Title with a 20-0 record. They are also the only team in Virginia to win two back-to-back AAA state championships, in 2006 and 2007. The boys' soccer team has won the state championship several times, including a 5-0 victory over Hylton High in 1988 and other titles in 1982, 1989, and 1995.\n\nThe Bruins have a long-standing tradition of winning since 1973. They won district championships in 1992, 1995, 1996, 2001, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2016, 2017, and 2018. The team has been to the Virginia State playoffs as regional champions in 1995, 2001, 2009, and 2010, and went to the state finals in 2009.\n\nIn the 2007 season, the Bruins went on a seven-game winning streak after their first-week loss to Robinson. Their only other loss came to Northern Region runner-up West Springfield. The Bruins went 8-3 in the regular season in 2007 and made the playoffs for the first time since 2000. In 2009 the Bruins were the Patriot District and the Northern Region Champions, and went 8-2 in the regular seasons, led by future Fordham QB and Virginia State Player of the Year Michael Nebrich. They made it to the playoffs, where they managed to beat Fairfax, defeat Robinson, redeem themselves against Woodson, and win a thrilling overtime game against Battlefield. They continued on to the State Championship and were defeated by the Thomas Dale Knights, 35-21. In the first round of 2010 Division 6 playoff games, Lake Braddock easily defeated Langley, 34-10. In the second round of the 2010 Division 6 playoff games, after a stunning 17-3 first half deficit, the Bruins overcame arch-rival Robinson with a 24-23 victory on their road to another Northern Region Championship Game, led by Michael Nebrich. Lake Braddock then advanced to the state semi-final after a 56-18 win over Chantilly High School. In an exciting rematch of the 2009 state semi-final playoff game, the Battlefield Bobcats, who had been defeated 27-24 in overtime by the Bruins the previous year, hung on to win a close 35-27 victory and advanced to win the state title. In the fall 2011 season, Lake Braddock had even wins and four losses, and won another district title.\n\nThe Lake Braddock baseball program has won 13 district championships (6 under head coach Dan Griel and 7 under head coach Jody Rutherford) and 8 regional championships (4 under Dan Griel, 3 under Jody Rutherford, and 1 under John Thomas).\n\nIn 2012, the Lake Braddock varsity baseball team won both the Patriot District title and the Virginia State Championship. This was the first state championship and best season record (26–3) in school history.\n\nIn 2019, the first year under head coach John Thomas, the Bruins won both the regional title and the state title, as well as matching the 26–3, school best, season record. This was the first state championship since 2012 and 2nd in school history.\n\nThe Lake Braddock tennis teams have achieved much success in recent years, becoming a perennial contender in the post-season tournaments. The boys' team holds the Patriot District titles from 2008 to 2013, and continued that streak in 2014, when the name was changed to the Patriot Conference. In 2014, the team won the 6A Region tournament, the first boys' tennis regional title for the school. The team had state appearances in 2010 and 2014, losing in the state semi-finals in 2010 to Deep Run HS, and winning the State tournament in 2014 over Langley High School, which was the first boys' tennis state title for Lake Braddock. Lake Braddock's website shows that the girls' tennis team won 48 of its 59 matches from 2015-2018.\n\nThe Lake Braddock Theatre program is currently in its 47th season, having been under the direction of R.L. Mirabal for most of that time. It has participated in the Cappie program since its inception in 1999, garnering 49 nominations and 13 awards. The theatre is represented in the International Thespian Society by troupe #4807, and contributes to the ITS festival in Lincoln, Nebraska every summer. LBT competes annually at the Virginia Theatre Association Conference.\n\nLBT has won the Virginia High School League Patriot District/Conference One-Act Play Championship nine times (1996, 2000, 2005, 2011, 2012, and 2014–2017). Lake Braddock Theatre has advanced to the Regional level 15 times since 1996. In 2004, 2015 and 2018, LBT advanced to the State Festival in Charlottesville, Virginia. In 2018, they won the VHSL State One-Act Play Championship for Class 6A. LBT has won 25 Cappie Awards, which include Best Play, for the 2000 production of \"Dracula\". The theater was invited to perform at the Fringe Festival in Edinburgh, Scotland, in 2003. Individual students have also received awards for their performances throughout the years.\n\nSeveral students from the Lake Braddock Music program have gone to conservatories and major schools of music, including four to the Juilliard School.\n\nThe Lake Braddock band program consists of five concert ensembles at the high-school level: Symphonic Band, Concert One, Concert Two, Concert Three and a specialty Jazz Band. The high school band program is conducted by Michael Luley and Jason Miller. Roy Holder announced his retirement at the end of the 2010–2011 school year, after 30 consecutive years as honor band; every year since the award was created. The Symphonic Band has been awarded 38 consecutive superior ratings at the Virginia Band & Orchestra Association (VBODA) Festival since 1981, when the ratings system was first installed. The Lake Braddock Middle School bands consist of four concert ensembles; Wind Ensemble, Select Band, Cadet Band, and Bruin Band. These middle school bands are conducted by Louis Bean, Michael Luley, and Jason Miller.\n\nThe Lake Braddock Marching Band of over 230 people is a subset of Lake Braddock Bands and is combined with the Color Guard, conducted by Michael Luley and assistant Jason Miller. The band has played the half-time show at Bruin football games for over 16 years. The band consistently wins awards at competitions every fall and has received a rating of Superior 39 times at the VBODA Marching Festival.\n\nThe Color Guard generally has about 20 members. Besides performing with the marching band in the fall, the guard performs an indoor performance in the spring, calling it \"Spring Guard\". In recent years, the Color Guard has been a main benefactor in the school's participation in the National Color Guard Invitational in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nEight ensembles comprise the Lake Braddock Orchestra program. The middle school groups are Primo Orchestra, Concert Orchestra, String Ensemble, Chamber Orchestra, and the high school groups are Sinfonietta Orchestra, Concert Orchestra, String Ensemble, and Symphony Orchestra. The current orchestra directors are Austin Issac and Clayton Allen.\n\nThe Lake Braddock Chorus consisted of five different choirs until the 2017–2018 school year. These were divided by skill level, and requirement of audition. The Men's Choir, Women's Vocal Ensemble and the female Freshmen in Bel Canto make up the non-auditioned choirs, and Select Women and Lake Braddock Singers make up the auditioned choirs. In 2017, Bel Canto and Women's Vocal Ensemble were combined.\n\nThe Lake Braddock Singers (formally known as Symphonic Chorale) is composed of sopranos, altos, tenors, and basses. Each of the vocal sections is divided into two subsections. The choir sings primarily \"a cappella\" music with exception to the major works concert. The group is encouraged by the director to be leaders within the full choir and help the non-auditioned choirs with their music.\n\nSelect Women is a traditional women's choir of approximately 35 10th-12th graders; this number varies from year to year. It is one of the two auditioned choirs at Lake Braddock. They sings in four parts, Soprano 1, Soprano 2, Alto 1, and Alto 2. Members of this group are expected to be leaders in the Choral program. Select is also expected to help the non-auditioned choirs with their music when performing together during the major works concert.\n\nAn a cappella group formed in 2008, inspired by the pop a cappella groups of major colleges, including JMU Madison Project and Blues Tones organizations that perform yearly for the choir program at Lake Braddock. The group was founded by students and is managed by students as well.\n\nThe choirs have won many awards, including winning almost every category they entered in Nashville in 2006. In 2007, the choir performed in New York City near the site of the former World Trade Center buildings. The choirs also have turned out several highly successful singers, including a quarter-finalist for American Idol, and a several performers in musical theater.\n\nLake Braddock Secondary School's Musical Theatre is well known in Fairfax County. Every year the Lake Braddock Chorus and the Lake Braddock Theatre programs come together and produce a musical. The musical theatre has been around since 1975 and has produced shows such as \"Guys and Dolls\"; \"Thoroughly Modern Millie\"; \"Annie\"; \"Les Misérables\"; \"Cinderella\"; \"Annie, Get Your Gun\"; \"Hairspray\"; \"Beauty and the Beast\". Auditions are usually held in the fall, and rehearsals begin shortly after the end of auditions. Rehearsals last until the spring when the show airs to the public. Anyone can audition for a musical at Lake Braddock, and one does not have to be enrolled in the chorus or theatre classes in order to audition.\n\nThe director of the High School Chorus Program, Andrea Harmon, took over the program after former director Mary Demarco retired in the 2016–2017 school year. Harmon works with the director of the middle school Chorus Program, Mrs. Tolbert. Mr. Mirabal, the head of the Lake Braddock Theatre Program, is also involved in these performances. The Theatre program is responsible for things in the show including the lighting, sound, and sets/set changes. Musicals at Lake Braddock Secondary School usually have five showings over the course of a weekend.\n\nLake Braddock is home to over 70 clubs. The DECA Club has sent students to national level competitions. In September 2006, Lake Braddock started a boys' volleyball team. The Lake Braddock Speech Team was reorganized in 2006 and began to compete in the VHSL. The Lake Braddock Key Club is one of the school's biggest and most prosperous clubs; having over 400 members, they raised $5,300 for UNICEF in October 2012. The Lake Braddock Model United Nations Club is an active participant in local and national conferences. LBSS has one of the few active high school chapters of Students for a Democratic Society. The It's Academic team has been featured on WRC-TV multiple times. Lake Braddock provides crew (rowing) as a club sport. Lake Braddock Crew has medaled in many regattas, including state competitions. Lake Braddock also features an Army JROTC program, started in 2010, which currently has over 150 cadets.\n\nLake Braddock houses many honor societies including the Lake Braddock chapter of the National Honor Society, National Social Studies Honor Society, Spanish National Honor Society, French Honor Society, German Honor Society, National Art Honor Society, and many more. These actively work to improve the Lake Braddock community. \n\n\"The Bear Facts\" is Lake Braddock's student news periodical with a circulation of about 3000 students and community members. It is student-run under the guidance of an adviser. Content decisions are governed by staff writers, editors, and any other students involved. Printed as a newspaper since its founding in 1973, it changed to a black and white/color news magazine format in 2013. \"The Bear Facts\" is a member of the Virginia High School League, the National Scholastic Press Association, and the Colombia Scholastic Press Association. \n\nIn 2007, \"The Bear Facts\" had an advisory change over issues published in March 2007. Controversy arose on articles published on \"homosexuality, trans sexuality and review of a documentary about bestiality,\" as well as its March 30 issue, which had carried a story on Post Secret, a website that posts anonymous contributors' secrets displayed on homemade postcards. The school released a statement that the dismissal was for \"basic journalism\" errors.\n\n\"The Lair\" is Lake Braddock's student-run yearbook, under the guidance of a faculty adviser. All design, writing, and editing is done entirely by students. One 300-page book and spring supplemental insert, printed by Herff Jones, are produced by a staff of about 70 each school year. \"The Lair\" is a member of the Virginia High School League, the National Scholastic Press Association, and the Colombia Scholastic Press Association. The 2015 book, \"Live Your Moment\", was awarded a Columbia Scholastic Press Association Silver Crown and was a nominee for the National Scholastic Press Association Pacemaker Award. It is one of only 37 books in the country to achieve this feat. In 2011, the Lake Braddock Middle School started to produce their own book, the \"Ursa\", instead of being a small portion of the high school book.\n\n\"The Morning Bru\" is Lake Braddock's morning announcement show produced by the school's broadcast journalism class. They have recently expanded to extend coverage of the school and the Lake Braddock Community. Later, the \"Bruin Cave\" was established as a separate morning announcement show for the middle school students.\n\nThe Lake Braddock Speech and Debate Team offers competition in Lincoln-Douglas Debate, Congressional Debate, and all standard individual events. The team is open to any student at Lake Braddock Secondary School, grade 7-12, who is in good academic standing. Team practices begin in the late summer, with competitions being held from October through Memorial Day weekend. The team has enjoyed great success in recent years, winning the 2011 NCFL National Championship in LD debate, four state individual VHSL State Champions in Debate, 10 VHSL State Championships in Speech, and multiple other awards at VHSL, NCFL, and NSDA Nationals.\n\nOn February 19, 1975, a bomber exploded a tear gas canister in a stairwell, sending 65 students to the school clinic and one student to the hospital for eye irritation.\n\nOn May 28, 1979, an electrical panel fire forced the school to be closed for the remainder of the school year.\n\nOn November 11, 1982, a dropout looking for his girlfriend held a group of employees hostage with a rifle for 21 hours.\n\nIn 1990, a man set fire to Lake Braddock Secondary School and two other schools. The total damage among all the schools was $200,000.\n\nIn April and May 1994, there were two incidents of 13-year-olds bringing guns to school.\n\nOn September 23, 1994, two teenagers were shot by a gang member after a Lake Braddock football game.\n\nOn March 23, 2015, a bomb threat was sent to several teachers early in the morning, resulting in the closure of the school. The threat was ruled a hoax after police swept the building and found nothing.\n\nIn 2018 the principal, Dave Thomas, retired after a report of his handling of a sexual harassment scandal at the school by the \"Washington Post\" and later WUSA9. Daniel Smith is currently the principal.\n\nThe school finished a three-year renovation in the summer of 2007, beginning right after school ended in June 2004. The renovations cost taxpayers around $72 million - a record for Fairfax County Public Schools. Fifty-two classroom trailers were installed on campus to accommodate the construction. Other than expanding the school and refurbishing the building, two main goals of the project were to repair an overhaul of the ventilation system and enclose classrooms with permanent walls. Samaha Associates, P.C. were the architects for Lake Braddock's renovation, which is now seen as a model for other renovation projects in Fairfax County, such as the renovation of nearby W.T. Woodson High School.\n\n"}

The editions were originally dated by the season covered (e.g., 1946–47) but, since the 1962 edition, the date is the calendar year of publication.\n\n\"Indian Cricket\" was founded in 1946–47 under the editorship of S. K. Gurunathan who continued in that role until his death in 1966. He was succeeded by P. N. Sundaresan, sports editor of \"The Hindu\" and Indian cricket correspondent of \"Wisden Cricketer's Almanack\". Sundaresan edited the annual until his retirement in 1972 and G. Viswanath edited the most recent issues.\n\nThe first edition was only 104 pages long whereas the 2004 edition had 1240 pages. The early issues were paperbacked and then a hardbacked standard edition was issued from 1972.\n\n\"Indian Cricket\" was largely inspired by \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\". It had the same page size as Wisden and replicated many of Wisden's usual features. It included domestic cricket matches in India and matches played by Indian teams abroad. Match details included brief reports and full scores. There was a detailed statistics section on domestic cricket, India in Test cricket, a small section on Test cricket abroad and obituaries. From its inception, \"Indian Cricket\" had a \"Five Cricketers of the Year\" award, based on Wisden. From 1952, there was a \"special portrait\" section that profiled a notable ex-cricketer.\n\nFrom 1957–58 to 1964–65 there was a rival publication called \"The Indian Cricket Field Annual\" edited by Dicky Rutnagur. This also contained full scores of all first-class matches in India and a biographical section on current players. Anandji Dossa was the statistical editor of this publication.\n\n"}

{"id": "2187851", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2187851", "title": "Dancing mania", "text": "Dancing mania\n\nDancing mania (also known as dancing plague, choreomania, St. John's Dance and St. Vitus's Dance) was a social phenomenon that occurred primarily in mainland Europe between the 14th and 17th centuries. It involved groups of people dancing erratically, sometimes thousands at a time. The mania affected men, women, and children who danced until they collapsed from exhaustion. One of the first major outbreaks was in Aachen, in the Holy Roman Empire, in 1374, and it quickly spread throughout Europe; one particularly notable outbreak occurred in Strasbourg in 1518, also in the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nAffecting thousands of people across several centuries, dancing mania was not an isolated event, and was well documented in contemporary reports. It was nevertheless poorly understood, and remedies were based on guesswork. Often musicians accompanied dancers, due to a belief that music would treat the mania, but this tactic sometimes backfired by encouraging more to join in. There is no consensus among modern-day scholars as to the cause of dancing mania.\n\nThe several theories proposed range from religious cults being behind the processions to people dancing to relieve themselves of stress and put the poverty of the period out of their minds. It is speculated to have been a mass psychogenic illness, in which physical symptoms with no known physical cause are observed to affect a group of people, as a form of social influence.\n\n\"Dancing mania\" is derived from the term \"choreomania\", from the Greek \"choros\" (dance) and \"mania\" (madness), and is also known as \"dancing plague.\" The term was coined by Paracelsus, and the condition was initially considered a curse sent by a saint, usually St. John the Baptist or St. Vitus, and was therefore known as \"St. Vitus's Dance\" or \"St. John's Dance\". Victims of dancing mania often ended their processions at places dedicated to that saint, who was prayed to in an effort to end the dancing; incidents often broke out around the time of the feast of St. Vitus.\n\nSt. Vitus's Dance was diagnosed, in the 17th century, as Sydenham chorea. Dancing mania has also been known as epidemic chorea and epidemic dancing. A disease of the nervous system, chorea is characterized by symptoms resembling those of dancing mania, which has also rather unconvincingly been considered a form of epilepsy. Scientists have described dancing mania as a \"collective mental disorder\", \"collective hysterical disorder\" and \"mass madness\".\n\nThe earliest known outbreak of dancing mania occurred in the 7th century, and it reappeared many times across Europe until about the 17th century, when it stopped abruptly. One of the earliest known incidents occurred sometime in the 1020s in Bernburg, where 18 peasants began singing and dancing around a church, disturbing a Christmas Eve service.\n\nFurther outbreaks occurred during the 13th century, including one in 1237 in which a large group of children travelled from Erfurt to Arnstadt (about ), jumping and dancing all the way, in marked similarity to the legend of the Pied Piper of Hamelin, a legend that originated at around the same time. Another incident, in 1278, involved about 200 people dancing on a bridge over the River Meuse resulting in its collapse. Many of the survivors were restored to full health at a nearby chapel dedicated to St. Vitus. The first major outbreak of the mania occurred between 1373 and 1374, with incidents reported in England, Germany and the Netherlands.\n\nOn 24 June 1374, one of the biggest outbreaks began in Aachen, (Germany), before spreading to other places such as Cologne, Flanders, Franconia, Hainaut, Metz, Strasbourg, Tongeren, Utrecht, and countries such as Italy and Luxembourg. Further episodes occurred in 1375 and 1376, with incidents in France, Germany and Netherlands, and in 1381 there was an outbreak in Augsburg. Further incidents occurred in 1418 in Strasbourg, where people fasted for days and the outbreak was possibly caused by exhaustion. In another outbreak, in 1428 in Schaffhausen, a monk danced to death and, in the same year, a group of women in Zurich were reportedly in a dancing frenzy.\n\nAnother of the biggest outbreaks occurred in July 1518, in Strasbourg (see Dancing plague of 1518), where a woman began dancing in the street and between 50 and 400 people joined her. Further incidents occurred during the 16th century, when the mania was at its peak: in 1536 in Basel, involving a group of children; and in 1551 in Anhalt, involving just one man. In the 17th century, incidents of recurrent dancing were recorded by professor of medicine Gregor Horst, who noted:\n\nDancing mania appears to have completely died out by the mid-17th century. According to John Waller, although numerous incidents were recorded, the best documented cases are the outbreaks of 1374 and 1518, for which there is abundant contemporary evidence.\n\nThe outbreaks of dancing mania varied, and several characteristics of it have been recorded. Generally occurring in times of hardship, up to tens of thousands of people would appear to dance for hours, days, weeks, and even months.\n\nWomen have often been portrayed in modern literature as the usual participants in dancing mania, although contemporary sources suggest otherwise. Whether the dancing was spontaneous, or an organised event, is also debated. What is certain, however, is that dancers seemed to be in a state of unconsciousness, and unable to control themselves.\n\nIn his research into social phenomena, author Robert Bartholomew notes that contemporary sources record that participants often did not reside where the dancing took place. Such people would travel from place to place, and others would join them along the way. With them they brought customs and behaviour that were strange to the local people. Bartholomew describes how dancers wore \"strange, colorful attire\" and \"held wooden sticks\".\n\nRobert Marks, in his study of hypnotism, notes that some decorated their hair with garlands. However, not all outbreaks involved foreigners, and not all were particularly calm. Bartholomew notes that some \"paraded around naked\" and made \"obscene gestures\". Some even had sexual intercourse. Others acted like animals, and jumped, hopped and leaped about.\n\nThey hardly stopped, and some danced until they broke their ribs and subsequently died. Throughout, dancers screamed, laughed, or cried, and some sang. Bartholomew also notes that observers of dancing mania were sometimes treated violently if they refused to join in. Participants demonstrated odd reactions to the color red; in \"A History of Madness in Sixteenth-Century Germany\", Midelfort notes they \"could not perceive the color red at all\", and Bartholomew reports \"it was said that dancers could not stand... the color red, often becoming violent on seeing [it]\".\n\nBartholomew also notes that dancers \"could not stand pointed shoes\", and that dancers enjoyed their feet being hit. Throughout, those affected by dancing mania suffered from a variety of ailments, including chest pains, convulsions, hallucinations, hyperventilation, epileptic fits, and visions. In the end, most simply dropped down, overwhelmed with exhaustion. Midelfort, however, describes how some ended up in a state of ecstasy. Typically, the mania was contagious but it often struck small groups, such as families and individuals.\n\nIn Italy, a similar phenomenon was tarantism, in which the victims were said to have been poisoned by a tarantula or scorpion. Its earliest known outbreak was in the 13th century, and the only antidote known was to dance to particular music to separate the venom from the blood. It occurred only in the summer months. As with dancing mania, people would suddenly begin to dance, sometimes affected by a perceived bite or sting and were joined by others, who believed the venom from their own old bites was reactivated by the heat or the music. Dancers would perform a tarantella, accompanied by music which would eventually \"cure\" the victim, at least temporarily.\n\nSome participated in further activities, such as tying themselves up with vines and whipping each other, pretending to sword fight, drinking large amounts of wine, and jumping into the sea. Some died if there was no music to accompany their dancing. Sufferers typically had symptoms resembling those of dancing mania, such as headaches, trembling, twitching and visions.\n\nAs with dancing mania, participants apparently did not like the color black, and women were reported to be most affected. Unlike dancing mania, tarantism was confined to Italy and southern Europe. It was common until the 17th century, but ended suddenly, with only very small outbreaks in Italy until as late as 1959.\n\nA study of the phenomenon in 1959 by religious history professor Ernesto de Martino revealed that most cases of tarantism were probably unrelated to spider bites. Many participants admitted that they had not been bitten, but believed they were infected by someone who had been, or that they had simply touched a spider. The result was mass panic, with a \"cure\" that allowed people to behave in ways that were, normally, prohibited at the time. Despite their differences, tarantism and dancing mania are often considered synonymous.\n\nAs the real cause of dancing mania was unknown, many of the treatments for it were simply hopeful guesses, although some did seem effective. The 1374 outbreak occurred only decades after the Black Death, and was treated in a similar fashion: dancers were isolated, and some were exorcised. People believed that the dancing was a curse brought about by St Vitus; they responded by praying and making pilgrimages to places dedicated to Vitus.\n\nPrayers were also made to St John the Baptist, who some believed also caused the dancing. Others claimed to be possessed by demons, or Satan, therefore exorcisms were often performed on dancers. Bartholomew notes that music was often played while participants danced, as that was believed to be an effective remedy, and during some outbreaks musicians were even employed to play. Midelfort describes how the music encouraged others to join in however, and thus effectively made things worse, as did the dancing places that were sometimes set up.\n\nNumerous hypotheses have been proposed for the causes of dancing mania, and it remains unclear whether it was a real illness or a social phenomenon. One of the most prominent theories is that victims suffered from ergot poisoning, which was known as St. Anthony's fire in the Middle Ages. During floods and damp periods, ergots were able to grow and affect rye and other crops. Ergotism can cause hallucinations and convulsions, but cannot account for the other strange behaviour most commonly identified with dancing mania.\n\nOther theories suggest that the symptoms were similar to encephalitis, epilepsy, and typhus, but as with ergotism, those conditions cannot account for all symptoms.\n\nNumerous sources discuss how dancing mania, and tarantism, may have simply been the result of stress and tension caused by natural disasters around the time, such as plagues and floods. Hetherington and Munro describe dancing mania as a result of \"shared stress\"; people may have danced to relieve themselves of the stress and poverty of the day, and in so doing, attempted to become ecstatic and see visions.\n\nAnother popular theory is that the outbreaks were all staged, and the appearance of strange behaviour was due to its unfamiliarity. Religious cults may have been acting out well-organised dances, in accordance with ancient Greek and Roman rituals. Despite being banned at the time, these rituals could be performed under the guise of uncontrollable dancing mania. Justus Hecker, a 19th-century medical writer, described it as a kind of festival, where a practice known as \"the kindling of the Nodfyr\" was carried out. This involved jumping through fire and smoke, in an attempt to ward off disease. Bartholomew notes how participants in this ritual would often continue to jump and leap long after the flames had gone.\n\nIt is certain that many participants of dancing mania were psychologically disturbed, but it is also likely that some took part out of fear, or simply wished to copy everyone else. Sources agree that dancing mania was one of the earliest-recorded forms of mass hysteria, and describe it as a \"psychic epidemic\", with numerous explanations that might account for the behaviour of the dancers. It has been suggested that the outbreaks may have been due to cultural contagion triggered, in times of particular hardship, by deeply rooted popular beliefs in the region regarding angry spirits capable of inflicting a \"dancing curse\" to punish their victims.\n\n\n\n"}

At the top of the architrave blocks, a row of six \"guttae\" below the narrow projection of the taenia (fillet) formed an element called a regula. A \"regula\" was aligned under each triglyph of the Doric frieze. In addition, the underside of the projecting geison above the frieze had rectangular protrusions termed \"mutules\" that each had three rows of six \"guttae\". These mutules were aligned above each triglyph and each metope. \n\nIt is thought that the guttae were a skeuomorphic representation of the pegs used in the construction of the wooden structures that preceded the familiar Greek architecture in stone. However, they have some functionality, as water drips over the edges, away from the edge of the building.\n\nIn the strict tradition of classical architecture, a set of guttae always go with a triglyph above (and vice versa), and the pair of features are only found in entablatures using the Doric order. In Renaissance and later architecture these strict conventions are sometimes abandoned, and guttae and triglyphs, alone or together, may be used somewhat randomly as ornaments. The Doric order of the Villa Lante al Gianicolo in Rome, an early work of Giulio Romano (1520–21), has a narrow \"simplified entablature\" with guttae but no tryglyphs. The stone fireplace in the Oval Office has Ionic columns at the side, but the decorative wreath in the centre of the lintel has sets of guttae below (only five to a set). The Baroque Černín Palace in Prague (1660s) has triglyphs and guttae as ornaments at the top of arches, in a facade using an eclectic Ionic order.\n\n"}

It is also the name of their flagship product, the Geochron Global Time Indicator. The Geochron was the first world clock to display day and night on a world map, showing the familiar \"bell curve\" of light and darkness. The Geochron employs an intricate analog clockwork mechanism for its display, that shows the month, date, day of the week, hours and minutes, the areas of the world currently experiencing day and night, and the meridian passage of the sun. The main display is dominated by a world map, with time zones prominently indicated. At the top of the map are arrows corresponding to each time zone. As each day progresses, the map is scrolled from left to right by gear mechanisms, and the arrows for each time zone shift their positions relative to a stationary band fixed at the top that has a horizontal series of numbers representing hours. The viewer may read the time by seeing what number his time zone's arrow is currently pointing to. The map is backlit, and a mechanism behind the map defines well-lit and shaded areas that are also stationary relative to the movement of the map. In this way, as time progresses, different areas are shown to be experiencing daytime and night. The center of the lit area lines up with the 12 noon on the stationary time strip. There is also a day-and-month readout below the map, and a minutes readout above.\n\nEach Geochron is assembled upon demand, with prices starting at above $1,500. President Ronald Reagan presented a Geochron to Mikhail Gorbachev in 1985 as an \"example of American ingenuity.\" In the mid-1980s, the company was selling about 75 clocks per month, increasing to around 200 per month during the holiday season. It had 16 employees in 1987.\n\nThe Hubble Space Telescope control center at Goddard Space Flight Center uses a Geochron in its day-to-day operations.

They were issued to Hungarian army troops in 1939 and remained in service throughout World War II and until the early 1950s. A total of roughly 8,000 were made between 1939 and 1945. The Danuvia was a large, sturdy weapon, similar to a carbine. Although inspired by the 9×19mm Parabellum Beretta Model 38/42, the Danuvia used the more powerful 9×25mm Mauser round. The Danuvia's magazine can be folded forward into a recess in the stock where a plate then slides over it.\n\nThe gun was well-liked by troops it was issued to; it reportedly functioned well in the sub-zero, muddy conditions on the Eastern Front. The only difficulty was the availability of 9×25mm Mauser ammunition. It was used by the Hungarian army, military police and police forces and stayed in service until the early 1950s when it was gradually replaced by the PPSh-41 and the Kucher K1.\n\nThe Danuvia featured a patented two-part lever-delayed blowback bolt. The fire selector switch is a circular cap on the rear of the receiver and is rotated to one of three settings: \"E\" (Egyes)(semiautomatic fire), \"S\"(Sorozat) (full automatic), or \"Z\" (Zárt)(the safety setting). The ejection port and cocking handle are on the right side of the receiver. It had a ramp-type rear sight above the ejection port and a post foresight at end of the barrel.\n\nThe original Danuvia was the Géppisztoly 39M with a fixed wooden stock, which was followed in limited numbers by the Géppisztoly 39M/A with a folding wooden stock. In 1943 a new version with a forward folding metal stock, wood fore stock and a pistol grip was designated the Géppisztoly 43M. The 43M was the most produced version and had a shortened barrel and a forward-angled magazine.\n\n"}

In the literature, he is usually referred to as H. Kern or Hendrik Kern; a few other scholars bear the same surname.\n\nHendrik Kern was born to Dutch parents in the Central-Javanese town of Purworejo in the Dutch East Indies, but when he was six his family repatriated to the Netherlands. When he entered grammar school, he added the extra-curricular subjects of English and Italian to his studies.\n\nIn 1850 he went up to Utrecht University to study Letters, but in 1851 moved to Leiden University to avail himself of the opportunity to read Sanskrit with Professor A. Rutgers. After obtaining his Doctor's Degree in 1855, he moved to Berlin, where he continued his Sanskrit studies as a pupil of Albrecht Weber, and also took up Germanic and Slavonic languages.\n\nOn his return to the Netherlands in 1858, Dr Kern accepted a post as a lecturer of Greek at Maastricht. In 1863 he was offered a Professorship in Benares, India where he taught Sanskrit at Brahmana and Queen's Colleges until 1865, when he was offered the Chair of Sanskrit at Leiden University. He remained there until his retirement in 1903, when he moved to the city of Utrecht. In 1866 he became member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.\n\nProfessor Kern continued work after his retirement, but when in 1916 his wife died, he was heart-broken and out-lived her by less than a year.\n\nTogether with Herman Neubronner van der Tuuk, Kern is regarded as one of the founding fathers of Oriental Studies in the Netherlands. His interest in languages was great, as witness his decision to take up English and Italian while still a secondary school pupil. In addition, he displayed an extraordinary ability to study, and to master, a wide variety of languages.\n\nAt first, his studies were restricted (if \"restricted\" is indeed the correct word) to Indo-European languages, ranging from the Germanic sub-group to Sanskrit. His thesis, entitled \"Specimen historicum exhibens scriptores Graecos de rebus Persicis Achaemenidarum monumentis collatos\" (1855) broadened the field to Persian, showing that inscriptions in that language could now be used to extend our knowledge of Ancient Persia. While in Benares, he applied himself to the study of Dravidian languages as well as picking up some Arabic and Hebrew, but also learnt sufficient Hungarian to be able to read novels in that non-Indo-European language within a year. His studies also included the Malay languages.\n\nIn 1874, he published an edition of the astronomer Āryabhata's work, thus putting out the first publication in Nagara script in the Netherlands.\n\nApart from promoting the study of Sanskrit, Professor Kern laid the foundation for Austronesian studies by Dutch scholars. It is as a comparativist and a philologist that he gained his great reputation. In 1879 he worked on Cambodian inscriptions, then turned his attention to Kawi (or Old Javanese) and in 1886 showed that Fijian and Polynesian were cognate languages. He was the first scholar to propose that the Oceanic languages constituted a sub-group of Austronesian (or Malayo-Polynesian, as the language family was then called), and in 1906 he published a study of Aneityum and Erromanga, two languages in the Vanuatu branch of the Oceanic sub-group.\n\nHis interests were not restricted to pure linguistics. Thus, in 1889 he made use of the \"Wörter und Sachen\" method (which compares designations for plants, animals and objects in cognate languages) to ascertain a putative dispersal centre for the \"Malayo-Polynesian\" peoples.\n\nKern's versatility also showed itself in his cultural studies. His \"History of Buddhism in India\" (1881–83), displays a thorough command of its subject. However, the author has been criticised for an incomplete understanding of Eastern astrology and mysticism, which may in part have been due to his positivist approach. Professor Kern has also been said to have borne a deep distrust of his contemporary Neogrammarians.\n\nHe published extensively, and his influence on subsequent linguists, both in the Netherlands and elsewhere, has been profound.\n\nKern's chief work is considered to be \"Geschiedenis van het Buddhisme in Indië\" (Haarlem, 2 vols., 1881-1883). In English he wrote a translation of the \"Saddharma Pundarika\" (Oxford, 1884, published as Vol. 21 of Max Müller's \"Sacred Books of the East\"); and a \"Manual of Indian Buddhism\" (Strassburg, 1896) for Buhler Kielhorn's \"Grundriss der indoarischen Philologie\".\n\nHe also critically edited the \"Jataka-Mala\" of Arya Shura in the original Sanskrit [Nâgarî letters] which was published as volume 1 of the Harvard Oriental Series in 1891. A second issue came in 1914.\n\n\n\n"}

He was a man standing at 6'1 with a dominating career in music. During his career, he recorded over 150 albums, which sold 25 million copies, and acted in more than 120 films. He was given the honorific nickname \"\"El Charro de México\"\" (Mexico's Horseman) because he is credited with popularizing the Mexican equestrian sport \"la charrería\" to international audiences.\n\nAguilar began his career singing on the Mexican radio station XEW in 1950. That same year, he signed a contract with the Mexican independent label Musart Records and became one of its best-selling artists. He made his acting debut with Pedro Infante in the drama \"Un rincón cerca del cielo\" (1952). After appearing in gentleman roles in several films, he achieved popularity as a film star with his performance as lawman Mauricio Rosales in a series of seven films in the mid-1950s. His success increased with his tours throughout Latin America and his studio albums, which included Mexican folk songs (\"rancheras\") and ballads (\"corridos\"). In the 1960s, he focused on producing and starring in films set in the Mexican Revolution. In 1970, he won Latin ACE Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of Emiliano Zapata in the 1970 epic film of the same name. He also portrayed Pancho Villa twice in film. In 1997, Aguilar was awarded the Golden Ariel for his \"invaluable contribution and spreading of Mexican cinema\". To this day, he has been the only Hispanic artist to sell out the Madison Square Garden of New York City for six consecutive nights in 1997.\n\nHis second wife was famous singer and actress Flor Silvestre. They had two sons, Antonio Aguilar Hijo and Pepe Aguilar, who also became singers and actors. His family is known as \"\"La Dinastía Aguilar\"\" (The Aguilar Dynasty).\n\nAguilar was born in Villanueva, Zacatecas, the son of Jesús Aguilar Aguilar and Ángela Márquez Barraza Valle, both of Villanueva. His parents had six other children: José Roque, Salvador (deceased), Guadalupe (deceased), Luis Tomás (deceased), Mariano (deceased) and Josefina. His cousin is Jose Rodriguez of Maravillas Villanueva Zac. He spent his early childhood in La Casa Grande de Tayahua, an hacienda first built in 1596 in the town of Tayahua, about 35 km from Villanueva. Aguilar's ancestors acquired this property in the early 19th century.\n\nAguilar began his recording career in 1950, eventually making over 150 albums and selling more than 25 million records. He was known for his corridos, with some of his best known songs including \"Gabino Barrera\", \"Caballo prieto azabache\", \"Albur de amor\", and \"Un puño de tierra\". He was the first Mexican performer to mix rodeos and concerts while touring his show in Latin America and the United States. He has been compared to American actors like Roy Rogers, Gene Autry, and Ronald Reagan.\n\nHe began his acting career in 1952 during the Golden Age of Mexican cinema. In the 1950s, Aguilar was cast in aseries of films centered on rural hero \"Mauricio Rosales\" in \"El rayo justiciero\" (1955), \"La barranca de muerte\" (1955), \"La sierra del terror\" (1956), \"La huella del chacal\" (1956), \"La pantera negra\" (1957), \"La guarida del buitre\" (1958), and \"Los muertos no hablan\" (1958).

Other collaborations with Rodríguez include \"La Cucaracha\" (1959) and \"Ánimas Trujano\" (1962), where he received starring roles. Amongst his best ranchera films are \"Yo... el aventurero\" (1959), \"Caballo prieto azabache\" (1968), \"El ojo de vidrio\" (1969), and \"Valente Quintero\" (1973). Aguilar appeared in American western films like 1969's \"The Undefeated\" starring John Wayne. He also made a memorable starring role alongside his wife Flor Silvestre in \"Triste recuerdo\" (1991).\n\nAguilar was also largely responsible for the renewed popularity of the tambora music in the mid-1980s, when he single-handedly resuscitated the genre with the hit \"Triste recuerdo\".\n\nAguilar was married to singer and actress Flor Silvestre (the stage name of Guillermina Jiménez Chabolla), and one of their children, José \"Pepe\" Aguilar, is among Mexico's most popular modern singers.

While there, the family received visits from many famous people including Vicente Fernández.\n\nAguilar died on 19 June 2007 at 11:45 p.m. from pneumonia. His coffin was carried through the streets of Zacatecas, the state capital, and was honored at a memorial service attended by hundreds at a church there.\n\nHis body was then taken to the hamlet of Tayahua, about to the south, where residents waited in the streets to bid Aguilar a final farewell before he was buried at his family's \"El Soyate\" ranch nearby, the government news agency Notimex reported.\n\nObituaries appeared in many newspapers, including \"Los Angeles Times\" (US), \"The New York Times\" (US), \"The Washington Post\" (US), \"The Guardian\" (UK) and \"The Independent\" (UK).

{"id": "2187873", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2187873", "title": "Kannadasan", "text": "Kannadasan\n\nKannadasan (24 June 1927 – 17 October 1981) was a Tamil philosopher, poet, film song lyricist, producer, actor, script-writer, editor, philanthropist, and is heralded as one of the greatest and most important lyricists in India. Frequently called Kaviarasu(\"Poet Laureate\"), Kannadasan was most familiar for his song lyrics in Tamil films and contributed around 5000 film lyrics apart from 6000 poems and 232 books, including novels, epics, plays, essays, his most popular being the 10-part religious book on Hinduism, \"Arthamulla Indhu matham\" (\"Meaningful Hindu Religion\"). He won the Sahitya Akademi Award for his novel \"Cheraman Kathali\" in the year 1980 and was the first to receive the National Film Award for Best Lyrics, given in 1969 for the film \"Kuzhanthaikkaga\".\n\nKannadasan was born to Sathappan and Visalakshi in the year 1927, in Sirukudalpatti, near Karaikudi, Tamil Nadu, India and was given the birth – name Muthiah. He was the 8th child to his parents and had 10 siblings. He was adopted by Chigappi Aachi for a sum of INR 7000 at an early age, who brought him up and was responsible for his early stages of school education. He completed his schooling till the 8th standard in Sirukudalpatti and Amaravathipudhur. He worked for a private company, AJAX, in Tiruvottiyur before taking up an editorial post in a Tamil Magazine where for the first time he took up the pseudonym Kannadasan.\n\nHis friendship with MSV was legendary and the combination of these two geniuses created some of the most important songs of Tamil Cinema.\n\nMuthiah was a keen follower of the Dravidian atheistic movement. He had great love of Tamil language and its culture, and excelled in Tamil literature, both prose and poetry. He read the Thiruppaavai of Aandaal, and was amazed at its mystic poetry, which was to have a deep and lasting impact on him. After a lot of introspection, he decided to go back to Sanaatana Dharma. He renamed himself as Kannadaasan, meaning the servant of Lord Sri Krishna (In Tamil Kannan means Krishna and in Sanskrit, \"daasa\" means \"servant\"), as he had become a Vaishnava Hindu. He Also built a Temple for Lord Krishna which is located on Thankichaalam Chetty road in T'Nagar, just a couple of hundred metres from his home. He dug deep into understanding Sanaatana Dharma, and wrote his series of books on Sanatana Dharma titled \"Arthamulla Indhu Matham\". He was born in the village of Sirukoodalpatti, which is near Kaaraikkudi.\n\nKannadasan's greatest contribution to Tamil culture is his songwriting. Before Kannadasan, many lyricists like Papanasam Sivan, Kambadasan, Vindhan, A. Maruthakasi, and Ku. Ma. Balasubramaniam were sought after in the Tamil music industry, but after the advent of Kannadasan, the scene changed. He quickly became the most sought after lyricist in the industry and remained so until his death. Kannadasan was so popular that few songs written by other contemporary poets were considered to be written by Kannadhasan. Though, after his death, film lyrics have come a long way, many people still consider Kannadasan to be the best songwriter. He is considered to be the greatest modern Tamil poet after Subramanya Bharathi.\n\nHe was the producer of the historic Tamil film \"Sivagangai Seemai\" portraying the pioneers of the Indian freedom struggle \"Marudhu Pandaiars\". The song \"Santhupottu\" from that film remains popular.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKannadasan was the poet Laureate of the Tamil Nadu Government at the time of his death. He wrote two notable autobiographies, titled \"Vanavasam\", a book about his past life whilst he was atheist, with the DMK and a sequel, titled \"Manavasam\" a book about his life after he had left DMK.\n\nKannadasan was a prolific writer and his writing covered a variety of forms- poems, novels, lyrics for Tamil films and books on spirituality. His series titled \"Arthamulla Indhu Matham\" (\"Meaningful Hindu Religion)\" is known for its simplicity in explaining the principles of Hinduism. He wrote a number of spiritual works in the later part of his life including \"Yesu Kaviyam\" the story of Jesus told in the poetic form. Many of Kannadasan's poems have been translated into French.\nHe wrote and published several volumes of poetry. He was an admirer of Kambar, and wrote a number of poems praising Kambar's artistry, contrary to the satire (\"Kambarasam\") on the same by C.N.Annadurai. He also spoke at several of the Kambar festivals. He sang the beauty of Seethai's gait and the shoulders of Rama; he spoke of beauty intoxicating and dropped me in a vessel of amrut (nectar)\" This is one of Kannadasan's tribute to the poet Kambar.\n\nHe wrote a book about the life of Jesus Christ \"Yesu Kaaviyam\" rendered in a pristine poetical Tamil. It was published at Tiruchirapalli in the year 1981. The function was presided over by the then chief minister of Tamil Nadu Mr. M.G. Ramachandran. Yesu Kaaviyam was the last literary work of Kannadasan.\n\nKannadasan died on 17 October 1981 in Chicago, United States, where he had gone from India to attend a Tamil conference organised by the Tamil Association of Chicago. He was aged just 54 at the time of his death. The song \"Kanne Kalaimane\" from the film 'Moondram Pirai', released a few months later, was his last song.\n\nThe Government of Tamil Nadu erected a memorial hall as \"Kaviarasar Kannadasan Manimandapam\" at Karaikudi. The road adjoining Natesan Park in T.Nagar, Chennai was previously called as Hensman Road is where Kannadasan resided from 1958 and it was renamed \"Kannadasan street\" in his honour after his demise. It was in this house where 7 Chief Ministers from Sri Mr. Bakthavachalam to Sri Ms.Jayalalitha had visited Kannadasan. Kannadhasan once owned 14 cars which were parked on either side of the road in front of house and the last remaining one which was given by Sri Kamarajar is still at display in this very house.\n\n"}

It was released only outside the US, but quickly became available as an import. Of the album's twelve songs, four were new compositions recorded specifically for it: \"I'm a Legend Tonight,\" \"Down on Your Knees,\" \"Nowhere to Run\" and \"Partners in Crime.\" These new songs were recorded at the behest of Phonogram Records, in response to the commercial failure of 1981's \"Music from \"The Elder\"\".\n\nBy 1982, Kiss' commercial popularity was at its nadir. 1980's \"Unmasked\" had barely achieved gold certification in the United States, and the band toured exclusively outside the US for the first time in their career that year, aside from one show in New York which introduced Eric Carr as their new official drummer. \"Music from \"The Elder\"\" fared even worse, as it failed to gain any certification, and the band did not tour behind it at all. The album, released in November 1981, was off the charts by February 1982.\n\nPhonogram Records (the parent company of Kiss' label Casablanca Records) then requested that Kiss record four new songs, to be included on an upcoming greatest hits album. Phonogram requested hard rock songs specifically, in contrast to the progressive rock-style of \"Music from \"The Elder\"\". The album cover featured the streamlined look the band had adopted during the \"Elder\" period.\n\nNumerous outside songwriters and session musicians were employed for the writing and recording of the four new songs on \"Killers\", as well as the subsequent album, \"Creatures of the Night\". Songwriter and musician Mikel Japp, who co-wrote three songs on Paul Stanley's 1978 solo album, co-wrote \"Down on Your Knees\" with Stanley and Bryan Adams. Adam Mitchell, another outside songwriter, was brought in by producer Michael James Jackson.\n\nDespite being pictured on the album's cover art (from the photo session for \"Music from \"The Elder\"\"), lead guitarist and co-founder Ace Frehley did not participate at all in the production of \"Killers\". He had essentially ended his active involvement with Kiss in late 1981, although he would not officially leave the group until the end of 1982, after the release of \"Creatures of the Night\". His replacement for the \"Killers\" sessions was Bob Kulick, who had previously substituted for Frehley on a handful of studio tracks on 1977's \"Alive II\"; however, whereas Kulick had been asked to mimic Frehley's playing style when recording for \"Alive II\", he was permitted to employ his own techniques for \"Killers\". The four new songs were considered a \"primer\" for Kiss' next release, while some fans have indicated that fan club memos at the time listed Frehley as \"temporarily out of action,\" possibly due to a car accident or something similar, and originally listed Vinnie Vincent as a temporary replacement for Frehley.\n\nDue to the large volume of Kiss live albums and greatest hits albums already available domestically, Phonogram decided to issue the album outside the US. The album sold in moderate numbers, reaching its highest chart position of #6 in Norway. \"Killers\" peaked at #21 and #27 in Australia and Japan, respectively. In Sweden and the UK, it reached #41 and #42, respectively. None of the singles released from the album charted in any country. Also, due to the shape of the S in their band logo, there were two covers: one with the standard \"S\", and a more European friendly version with a \"backwards\"-Z shape.\n\n\nKiss\n\nAdditional musicians\n"}
