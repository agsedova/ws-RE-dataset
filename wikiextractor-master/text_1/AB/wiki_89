{"id": "2028197", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2028197", "title": "CHFI-FM", "text": "CHFI-FM\n\nCHFI-FM (98.1 FM) – branded \"98.1 CHFI\" – is a commercial adult contemporary radio station licensed to Toronto, Ontario. Owned by Rogers Media, it serves the Greater Toronto Area. The CHFI-FM studios are located at the Rogers Building on the northwest corner of Bloor and Jarvis Streets in downtown Toronto, while the station transmitter is located atop the CN Tower.\n\nCHFI is currently the most listened to station in the Toronto radio market according to the Numeris ratings.\n\nCHFI-FM first signed on the air on February 1, 1957, owned by CHFI-FM, Ltd. CHFI-FM was the first commercial FM outlet in Toronto to provide its own distinct programming rather than simulcasting an AM station, with the call sign chosen to represent the words \"Canada HiFI\" or \"high fidelity,\" providing a higher quality sound than on AM radio. CHFI also initially provided a special Muzak-like background music service for offices and retail outlets in the city.\n\nThe station was acquired in 1960 by Aldred-Rogers Broadcasting, forerunner to Rogers Radio. In 1962, an AM counterpart, CHFI (1540 AM), was added.\n\nCHFI-FM pioneered the \"beautiful music\" format in Canada. The main programming heard from dawn until midnight was traditional easy listening fare, mostly instrumental cover versions of popular hits, as well as Broadway and Hollywood show tunes.\n\nMusic director Michael Compeau created a number of the station's much-imitated programs. The most famous was the popular and long running \"Candlelight and Wine\" heard evenings from 6 to 11 p.m. The program, hosted by Don Parrish, mixed soothing instrumentals, soft vocals and occasional light classical pieces in \"pop\" arrangements. The program spun off a series of best-selling record albums, many of which are now highly prized collectors' items. Compeau also created the popular \"Classics 'til Dawn\", an overnight program of popular classical music. (In 1984, Compeau would become program director of classical station CFMX-FM and use this same format for its overnight program.) Another of Compeau's innovations was \"Front Row Centre\", heard Sunday afternoons at 2 p.m. This one-hour program featured full original cast recordings of popular Broadway musicals, with host Don Parish explaining the story between songs.\n\nIn the 1970s, Todd Russell began hosting a late evening program called \"Reminiscing\" featuring modern recordings of popular songs from the 1920s, 1930s, 1940s and 1950s. In 1973, Compeau decided to add some spice to the program by sprinkling in a few original period recordings. Since very few had been reissued on LP at this time, a call went out to collectors who loaned their original 78-rpm records to the radio station. The records were cleaned, repaired and brushed with distilled water before being transcribed to tape. Dubbed the \"new library of old 78's\", these antique rarities were showcased each weeknight. (In 1974, host Todd Russell died and was replaced by Sandy Hoyt.) CHFI soon amassed a collection of over 3,500 period recordings and the reminiscing program became one of the station's biggest successes. As time went on, the modern recordings were phased out and the program featured mainly the period recordings.\n\nA format change in the mid-1980s led to the elimination of these programs, and CHFI began moving towards a soft adult contemporary format, making the station one of the longest-running English-language adult contemporary stations in Canada. In December 1987, Don Daynard became CHFI's new morning show host, a position he would hold until his retirement on December 10, 1999. Bob Magee took over mornings on December 13.\n\nA new logo was unveiled in 2000, when Rogers rebranded the station from \"CHFI FM98\" and the \"Toronto's Perfect Music Mix\" slogan, to \"98.1 CHFI\", moving away from soft adult contemporary to mainstream adult contemporary under the \"Toronto's Soft Rock\" slogan.\n\nIn June 2003, CHFI, competing closely with fellow Toronto adult contemporary station CJEZ (now adult hits CHBM-FM), attempted to popularize a younger morning show. Firing longtime CHFI morning show personality Erin Davis (who had been with the station since September 1988) and moving Bob Magee to afternoons, the station named Mad Dog and Billie, later known as Jay and Billie, to host the morning show, beginning June 23. Jay and Billie hosted mornings on co-owned Toronto station KISS 92 FM before it flipped to adult hits earlier that month. The station began IDing as \"98-1 CHFI\" (no point) instead, and unveiled the \"Today's Lite Music\" slogan.\n\nBringing Jay and Billie on for mornings backfired on CHFI, as the station's ratings declined. In September 2004, Erin Davis was hired by CJEZ as a fill-in co-host, working alongside Mike Cooper. This brought CJEZ's ratings up dramatically, beating CHFI in several books. In June 2005, CHFI management fired Jay and Billie, rehired Davis for mornings (who returned on September 6), and also hired Mike Cooper as her co-host on October 26 after his contract with CJEZ expired. (Cooper has since retired, with Darren B. Lamb (formerly of CHUM-FM) joining as Davis' co-host in February 2016.) At the same time, the station returned to using the point on the station's ID, returned to their old soft AC sound and switched to the \"Toronto's Lite Favourites\" slogan. This turned around CHFI's ratings, as the station reclaimed the top spot in Toronto ratings, while CJEZ's ratings fell, prompting that station to flip to adult hits in December 2009.\n\nIn 2009, the station returned to mainstream AC, but retained the \"Toronto's Lite Favourites\" slogan (which has since reverted to the \"Toronto's Perfect Music Mix\" slogan as of February 2013) and decimal point from the station ID. In addition, newer jingles were unveiled, along with an opening bumper for newer music. Some upbeat, rhythmic material, such as The Black Eyed Peas' \"I Gotta Feeling\" was added. At the same time, softer artists such as Michael Bolton and Air Supply were largely dropped from the station's playlist. On December 26, 2009, long-time competitor CJEZ switched from an adult contemporary format to an adult hits format, leaving CHFI as the only adult contemporary station in the Toronto radio market, although rimshot stations CKDX-FM in Newmarket, CKLH-FM in Hamilton and CHRE-FM in St. Catharines can be heard in some parts of the market.\n\nOn November 9, 2016, Erin Davis announced she would be retiring from CHFI on December 15, and would be moving to British Columbia to be closer to her family. Darren B. Lamb continues to host mornings, along with new co-host Maureen Holloway.\n\n\nOther personalities:\n\nCHFI-FM can also be heard on these low-power transmitters:\n\n\n"}

It is the world's largest manufacturer of plasterboard. It once was a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. In 2005, the company was purchased by Saint-Gobain of France. The company subsidiary British Gypsum, which was the UK operating arm of the company, operates as a subsidiary of Saint-Gobain, with five manufacturing sites in Britain as of 2012.\n\nThe development of plasterboard (a sandwich of gypsum plaster between two sheets of paper) dates back to the late nineteenth century in the USA. The first patent was granted in 1894 but it was not until an American, Frank Culver, persuaded his new employer, Thomas McGhie and Sons, to buy a plasterboard plant from the USA that this new product was introduced to Britain. A site was acquired at Wallasey Cheshire and building started in 1916. However, McGhie's shareholders could not supply sufficient funding and in 1917 the plasterboard assets were sold to a new company, British Plaster Board Limited [BPB].\n\nThe British building industry was initially slow to adopt the new product. Helped by a more modern plant, purchased in 1927, sales gradually increased and by 1932 the Company was able to float on the London Stock Exchange. The additional capital enabled BPB to build a new factory at Erith in 1934. The Erith plant had the capacity to manufacture the gypsum plaster (the core of the plasterboard product) and BPB began importing gypsum rock from Canada. This encouraged negotiations with other gypsum companies in Britain and a \"breath-taking series of take-overs\" followed in the next two years, making BPB the dominant force in the industry. In particular, these included the Gotham Company with plaster works in the north of England, and The Gypsum Mines Limited, with its large gypsum mine at Mountfield Sussex.\n\nIn 1944, BPB acquired its large rival, Gyproc Products Limited; after that there were only a handful of small companies and when ICI withdrew from the market in 1968 BPB was the 100% British producer of plaster and plasterboard. Organisationally, all domestic gypsum activities were consolidated in the British Gypsum subsidiary and the parent company was BPB Industries. BPB had also acquired the main paper supplier in 1953 – the Aberdeen firm of C. Davidson.\n\nThe post-war period saw extensive overseas investment through subsidiaries and associates. South Africa was the first investment (1946) followed by Placoplatre in France (1952), Western Gypsum of Canada (1954) and Sweden (1957).\n\nIn 1987 it bought Rigips, a well-known brand in Austria, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands.\n\nIn April 1996, it bought Borgadts of Germany for £21m. In June 1996, it bought Gypsum Industries of South Africa for £28m. In October 1998, it bought Gyproc of Scandinavia for £95m, already having a joint venture called Scancem. In March 2000 it bought Heidelberger Dammsysteme of Germany, which made polystyrene insulation, for £22m. In June 2000, it acquired the Celotex company of the USA, which made ceiling tiles, for £230m. In January 2001, it bought Rawlplug Ltd. for £27m. In October 2002, it acquired Gyproc Benelux of Belgium for £52m.\n\nIn March 2002 it acquired \"James Hardie Industries\", another US business, for £245 million.\n\nBPB regained its place in the FTSE 100 Index in June 2005 after an absence of fourteen years.\n\nHowever, since May 1996, BPB had a joint venture with the French company Saint-Gobain, making glass fibre insulation. In August 2005, BPB received a hostile takeover bid from Saint-Gobain, which set a price of 720 pence per share.\n\nThe BPB initially resisted this strongly, but eventually accepted a revised bid of 775 pence per share, which valued the company at £3.9billion (US$6.7 billion). BPB was delisted in December 2005.\n\nBPB was a multinational company with operations in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia. In Europe its main rivals are Lafarge of France and Knauf of (Germany) (who have a UK plant at Immingham).\n\nPlasterboard is mainly used for internal partition walls. BPB's other products include plaster, insulating materials, fastenings, decorative wall covering and ceiling components. British Gypsum has plants at Barrow upon Soar in Leicestershire, Kirkby Thore in Cumbria, Mountfield near Robertsbridge in East Sussex, Sherburn-in-Elmet in North Yorkshire and East Leake in Nottinghamshire. It also has training facilities in Erith, south-east London, Clevedon, in Bristol and Flitwick, in Bedfordshire.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2028206", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2028206", "title": "Eduard Nápravník", "text": "Eduard Nápravník\n\nEduard Francevič Nápravník (Russian: Эдуа́рд Фра́нцевич Напра́вник; 24 August 1839 – 10 November 1916) was a Czech conductor and composer. Nápravník settled in Russia and is best known for his leading role in Russian musical life as the principal conductor of the Imperial Mariinsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg for many decades. In that capacity, he conducted the premieres of many operas by Russian composers, including those by Mussorgsky, Tchaikovsky and Rimsky-Korsakov.\n\nNápravník was born in Býšť, Bohemia, in 1839. His studies of music were precariously uneven as a child, being the son of a poor teacher. Orphaned in 1853 at the age of 14, he first worked as a local church organist. In 1854 he entered the Prague Organ School, where he studied under Jan Bedřich Kittl and others, eventually becoming an assistant teacher as Kittl's generosity allowed him to continue his studies. In 1861, he worked in Russia for the first time as conductor of the private orchestra of Prince Yusupov in St. Petersburg.\n\nNápravník became organist and assistant conductor at the Imperial theatres in 1863, second conductor in 1867, and chief conductor, succeeding Liadov, in 1869, holding the post until his death. He led the first performances of \"Boris Godunov\" in 1874, conducted five operas by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, including \"The Maid of Orleans\", \"Mazepa\" and \"The Queen of Spades\", and five by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, including \"May Night\", \"The Snow Maiden\" and \"Christmas Eve\". He also conducted concerts of the Russian Musical Society. In 1914, after a productive career in the service of Russian opera, he was forced to retire due to ill health.\n\nIn November 1875, Nápravník conducted the first performance in Russia of Tchaikovsky's First Piano Concerto with Gustav Kross as soloist (whose playing was described by the composer as \"an atrocious cacophony\"). Nápravník is also well known for leading the second — and overwhelmingly persuasive — performance of Tchaikovsky's \"Pathétique\" symphony on 6/18 November 1893, twelve days after the composer's death. The premiere, under the composer's baton, had not fared so well, partly due to the audience's and the orchestra's unfamiliarity with a work that contained so many novelties, compositionally speaking, and partly due to Tchaikovsky's (perhaps understated?) conducting (although Rimsky protested after that second performance, in his autobiography Moy Muzikalny Zhizn [My Musical Life], that the first performance had also gone well under the baton of its creator). Under Nápravník's baton, however, and under the solemn influence of Tchaikovsky's sudden passing, the work was seen as a masterpiece with an overwhelming emotional message. It included some minor corrections that Tchaikovsky had made after the premiere, and was thus the first performance of the work in the exact form in which it is known today.\n\nOf Nápravník's own four operas the most successful was \"Dubrovsky\" (1894, staged 1895) written to a Russian libretto by Modest Ilyich Tchaikovsky after the story by Alexander Pushkin.\n\nHe died in Petrograd in 1916. In May 1917, his family went abroad and eventually settled in Belgium.\n\nHis wife was singer Olga Shryoder (ru: Ольга Эдуардовна Шрёдер).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Mr. Napravnik is our well-known Russian orchestra conductor\" (\"Fyodor Dostoyevsky: \"The Brothers Karamazov\" (1880), book 2, chapter 2\").\n\n"}
{"id": "2028217", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2028217", "title": "Inland Empire (film)", "text": "Inland Empire (film)\n\nInland Empire is a 2006 film written, directed and co-produced by David Lynch. The film's cinematography, editing, score and sound design were also helmed by Lynch, with pieces by a variety of other musicians also featured. Lynch's longtime collaborator and then-wife Mary Sweeney co-produced the film. The cast includes such Lynch regulars as Laura Dern, Justin Theroux, Harry Dean Stanton, and Grace Zabriskie, as well as Jeremy Irons, Karolina Gruszka, Peter J. Lucas, Krzysztof Majchrzak, and Julia Ormond. There are also brief appearances by a host of additional actors, including Nastassja Kinski, Laura Harring, Terry Crews, Mary Steenburgen, and William H. Macy. The voices of Harring, Naomi Watts, and Scott Coffey are included in excerpts from Lynch's 2002 \"Rabbits\" online project. The title borrows its name from a metropolitan area in Southern California.\n\nReleased with the tagline \"A Woman in Trouble\", the film follows the fragmented and nightmarish events surrounding a Hollywood actress (Dern) who begins to take on the personality of a character she plays in a film. An international co-production between the United States, France, and Poland, the film was completed over a three-year period and shot primarily in Los Angeles and Poland. The process marked several firsts for Lynch: the film was shot without a finished screenplay, instead being largely developed on a scene-by-scene basis; and it was shot entirely in low-resolution digital video by Lynch himself using a handheld Sony camcorder rather than traditional film stock. \n\n\"Inland Empire\" premiered in Italy at the Venice Film Festival on 6 September 2006. It received generally positive but polarized reviews from critics, with attention centering on its challenging and surrealist elements. It was named the second-best film of 2007 (tied with two others) by \"Cahiers du cinéma\", and listed among \"Sight & Sound\"s \"thirty best films of the 2000s\", as well as \"The Guardian\"s \"10 most underrated movies of the decade\".\n\nIn a hotel room, a young prostitute, identified in the credits as the \"Lost Girl\", cries following an unpleasant encounter with her client while watching a television show about a family of surrealistic anthropomorphic rabbits who speak in cryptic statements and questions. A gramophone plays \"Axxon N.\", \"the longest-running radio play in history\". Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, actress Nikki Grace (Laura Dern) auditions for the lead role in the film \"On High in Blue Tomorrows\". Nikki is visited by a Polish woman (Grace Zabriskie) who claims to be her neighbor. The woman tells Nikki two stories: one of a boy who, looking at his reflection in a mirror, created evil, and another about a girl who, wandering through an alleyway behind a marketplace, \"discovers a palace\". The woman predicts that Nikki will get the role, and asks her if her character is married and if the plot involves murder. Nikki denies both, but her neighbor disagrees. The next day, Nikki celebrates having won the role as her husband Piotrek (Peter J. Lucas) watches her. Nikki meets the film's lead actor Devon Berk (Justin Theroux) and the two begin a relationship, though Devon is warned by his entourage that Nikki is out of bounds due to her husband's power and influence. Later, during a rehearsal, the crew is interrupted by a disturbance. Devon investigates, but finds nothing. Shaken by the event, director Kingsley Stewart (Jeremy Irons) confesses that they are shooting a remake of a German feature entitled \"47\". Production was abandoned after both leads were murdered, creating rumors of the film being cursed. One day, Nikki finds a door marked \"Axxon N.\" in an alley behind the set. Upon entering, she finds herself at the rehearsal weeks before, and she causes the noise that Devon investigated that day. Nikki escapes into the home of a character named \"Smithy\". Devon looks through the windows, but sees only darkness.\n\nIn the house, Nikki finds Piotrek in bed and hides from him in a closet, where she encounters a troupe of prostitutes who advise her to burn a hole through silk with a cigarette and look through the hole. Nikki complies and sees one of the film's characters, \"Doris Side\" (Julia Ormond), tell a policeman that she had been hypnotized by a man known as \"The Phantom\" to murder someone with a screwdriver, but finds the screwdriver embedded in her own side. A mysterious organization claims to have captives from Inland Empire. In 1930s Łódź, prostitutes are beaten by pimps while murder permeates the city. Nikki, having become one of the group of present-day prostitutes, wanders the streets while her companions ask, \"Who is she?\" Nikki asks several men if they had met her. Meanwhile, Nikki's character \"Sue\" meets a policeman at a nightclub and tells him how she was abused in her childhood, which led to her prostitution, and how she is being pursued by a red-lipped man; Sue arms herself with a screwdriver in response. She also mentions her husband Smithy, a circus bear tamer with connections to both the pimps and the organization. Sue walks down Hollywood Boulevard and sees Nikki, but is attacked by Doris, who was hypnotized by the Phantom to kill her. Doris stabs Sue with her own screwdriver, and Sue falls at a bus stop, where two homeless women talk about a prostitute named Niko, a beautiful woman whose blond wig makes her look like a movie star, thus allowing her to walk through the rich district without drawing attention. One of the women holds a lighter in front of Sue's face until she dies. Kingsley yells \"Cut!\" and the camera pans back to show this has merely been a film scene.\n\nKingsley informs Nikki that her scenes for the film are complete. In a daze, Nikki wanders off set and into a nearby cinema, where she sees not only \"On High in Blue Tomorrows\", but events that are currently occurring. She wanders to the projection room, but finds an apartment building marked \"Axxon N.\". There, Nikki confronts the red-lipped man, now known to be the Phantom, and shoots him. The Phantom transforms into a deformed version of Nikki, and then into a bloodied figure before dying. Nikki flees into Room 47, which houses the rabbits on television, though she fails to see them. She then meets the Lost Girl, and they kiss. Nikki and the rabbits disappear in a white light, and the Lost Girl escapes from the hotel and into Smithy's house, where she happily embraces her husband and son.\n\nNikki, back at home, smiles victoriously at the Polish woman and finds a one-legged woman (Tracy Ashton) that Sue had mentioned, Niko the prostitute, and a monkey. The end credits roll over a group of women dancing to Nina Simone's \"Sinner Man\" while a lumberjack saws a log to the beat.\n\n\"Inland Empire\" is the first Lynch feature to be completely shot in digital video; it was shot with a hand-held Sony DSR-PD150 by Lynch himself. Lynch has stated that he will no longer use film to make motion pictures. He explained his preference, stating that the medium gives one \"more room to dream\", and more options in post-production. Much of the project was shot in Łódź, Poland, with local actors, such as Karolina Gruszka, Krzysztof Majchrzak, Leon Niemczyk, Piotr Andrzejewski and artists of the local circus Cyrk Zalewski. Some videography was also done in Los Angeles, and in 2006 Lynch returned from Poland to complete filming. Lynch then edited the final results in Final Cut Pro in his home office over six months. He did not work with frequent collaborator and editor Mary Sweeney because \"there wasn't a real organized script to go by and no one knew what was going on except\" him.\n\nLynch shot the film without a complete screenplay. Instead, he handed each actor several pages of freshly written dialogue each day. In a 2005 interview, he described his feelings about the shooting process:\n\"I've never worked on a project in this way before. I don't know exactly how this thing will finally unfold ... This film is very different because I don't have a script. I write the thing scene by scene and much of it is shot and I don't have much of a clue where it will end. It's a risk, but I have this feeling that because all things are unified, this idea over here in that room will somehow relate to that idea over there in the pink room.\"\n\nInterviewed at the Venice Film Festival, Laura Dern admitted that she did not know what \"Inland Empire\" was about or the role she was playing, but hoped that seeing the film's premiere at the festival would help her \"learn more\". Justin Theroux has also stated that he \"couldn't possibly tell you what the film's about, and at this point I don't know that David Lynch could. It's become sort of a pastime—Laura [Dern] and I sit around on set trying to figure out what's going on.\" In an NPR interview, Dern recounted a conversation she had with one of the movie's new producers, Jeremy Alter. He asked if Lynch was joking when he requested a one-legged woman, a monkey and a lumberjack by 3:15. \"Yeah, you're on a David Lynch movie, dude,\" Dern replied. \"Sit back and enjoy the ride.\" Dern reported that by 4 p.m. they were shooting with the requested individuals.\n\nLynch financed much of the production from his own resources, with longtime artistic collaborator and ex-wife Mary Sweeney producing. The film was also partially financed by the French production company StudioCanal, which had provided funding for three previous Lynch films. StudioCanal wanted to enter the film in the 2006 Cannes Film Festival. Instead, it premiered at Italy's Venice Film Festival on 6 September 2006, where David Lynch also received the Golden Lion lifetime achievement award for his \"contributions to the art of cinema\". The film premiered in the United States on 8 October 2006 at the New York Film Festival. The film received a limited release in the US beginning on 15 December 2006; distribution was handled by the specialist company 518 Media.\n\nLynch hoped to distribute the film independently, saying that with the entire industry changing, he thought he would attempt a new form of distribution as well. He acquired the rights to the DVD and worked out a deal with StudioCanal in an arrangement that allowed him to distribute the film himself, through both digital and traditional means. A North American DVD release occurred on 14 August 2007. Among other special features, the DVD included a 75-minute featurette, \"More Things That Happened\", which compiled footage elaborating on Sue's marriage to Smithy, her unpleasant life story, the Phantom's influence on women, and the lives of the prostitutes on Hollywood Boulevard.\n\nLynch contributed a number of his own compositions to the film's soundtrack, marking a departure from his frequent collaborations with composer Angelo Badalamenti. His pieces range from minimalist ambient music to more pop-oriented tracks such as \"Ghost of Love\". Polish composer Marek Zebrowski wrote music for the film and acted as music consultant. The soundtrack includes the following musical pieces:\n\n\nWhen asked about \"Inland Empire\", Lynch refrained from explaining the film, responding that it is \"about a woman in trouble, and it's a mystery, and that's all I want to say about it.\" When presenting screenings of the digital work, Lynch sometimes offers a clue in the form of a quotation from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad:\n\nWe are like the spider. We weave our life and then move along in it. We are like the dreamer who dreams and then lives in the dream. This is true for the entire universe.\n\nNew York Film Festival official Richard Peña summarized the film as \"a plotless collection of snippets that explore themes Lynch has been working on for years\", including \"a Hollywood story about a young actress who gets a part in a film that might be cursed; a story about the smuggling of women from Eastern Europe; and an abstract story about a family of people with rabbit heads sitting around in a living room.\" \"The Guardian\" critic Peter Bradshaw called the film \"a meditation on the unacknowledged and unnoticed strangeness of Hollywood and movie-making in general\", adding that Lynch \"establishes a bizarre series of worm-holes between the worlds of myth, movies and reality.\" Critic Mark Fisher wrote that the film \"often seems like a series of dream sequences floating free of any grounding reality, a dream without a dreamer [in which] no frame is secure\", but argued that \"it is the \"film\" that is mad, not the characters in it ... it is Hollywood itself that is dreaming\". He also commented that \"to see Lynch's worlds captured on digital video makes for a bizarre short-circuiting: as if we are witnessing a direct feed from the unconscious\".\n\nDennis Lim of \"Slate\" described the film as \"a three-hour waking nightmare that derives both its form and its content from the splintering psyche of a troubled Hollywood actress\", and commented on Lynch's use of digital video, describing it as \"the medium of home movies, viral video, and pornography—the everyday media detritus we associate more with ... intimate or private viewing experiences than communal ones\", adding that the film \"progresses with the darting, associative logic of hyperlinks\". Scholar Anne Jerslev has argued that the film \"constitutes multiple and fractured modes of perception in a world of digital screens\". Other critics have argued that the film features \"formal similarities with a website's hyperlinked layering of screens/windows, constantly disclosing new worlds from new points of view\", but according to theorist Steven Shaviro \"it also builds on cinematic codes, even as it deconstructs them\". The scholar Delorme indicated that the film is about adultery, in a way that Lynch \"avoid[s] a chronological unfolding of the scenes and situations provoked by the adultery\", but rather \"superimpose[s] them instead in as many scenarios developing from the potentials of the adultery\", so that \"[t]he narrative is constructed on strange characters brought together by a similar terror\".\n\nThe film was screened at several film festivals around the world, most notably the Venice Film Festival in Italy, New York Film Festival in New York, United States, the Thessaloniki Film Festival in Greece, Camerimage Film Festival in Poland, Fajr International Film Festival in Iran, International Film Festival Rotterdam in the Netherlands and the Festival Internacional de Cine Contemporáneo de la Ciudad de México in México City, Mexico.\n\n\"Inland Empire\" was released and distributed by Ryko to the United States on 14 August 2007. It was released on 20 August in the United Kingdom, 4 October in Belgium and the Netherlands, with distribution by A-Film and 6 August 2008 in Australia, with distribution by Madman Entertainment.\n\n518 Media released \"Inland Empire\" to two theaters in the United States on 6 December 2006, grossing a total of $27,508 over its opening weekend. It later expanded to its widest release of fifteen nationwide theaters, ultimately grossing $861,355 at American box office. In other countries outside the United States, \"Inland Empire\" grossed $3,176,222—bringing the film's worldwide total gross to $4,037,577.\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 72% based on 108 reviews, with an average score of 7.16/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Typical David Lynch fare: fans of the director will find Inland Empire seductive and deep. All others will consider the heady surrealism impenetrable and pointless.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 73 out of 100, based on 24 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\n\"The New York Times\" classified \"Inland Empire\" as \"fitfully brilliant\" after the Venice Film Festival screening. Peter Travers, the film critic for \"Rolling Stone\" magazine wrote, \"My advice, in the face of such hallucinatory brilliance, is that you hang on.\" \"The New Yorker\" was one of the few publications to offer any negative points about the film, calling it a \"trenchant, nuanced film\" that \"quickly devolves into self-parody\". Jonathan Ross, presenter of the BBC programme \"Film 2007\", described it as \"a work of genius ... I think\". Damon Wise of \"Empire\" magazine gave it five stars, calling it \"A dazzling and exquisitely original riddle as told by an enigma\" and Jim Emerson (editor of RogerEbert.com) gave it 4 stars and praised it: \"When people say \"Inland Empire\" is Lynch's \"Sunset Boulevard\", Lynch's \"Persona\" or Lynch's \"8½\", they're quite right, but it also explicitly invokes connections to Stanley Kubrick's \"The Shining\", Jean-Luc Godard's \"Pierrot le Fou\", Buñuel and Dalí's \"Un Chien Andalou\", Maya Deren's LA-experimental \"Meshes of the Afternoon\" (a Lynch favorite) and others\". However, Carina Chocano of the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote that \"the film, which begins promisingly, disappears down so many rabbit holes (one of them involving actual rabbits) that eventually it just disappears for good\".\n\nDern received almost universal acclaim for her performance, with many reviews describing it as her finest to date. Lynch attempted to promote Dern's chances of an Academy Award for Best Actress nomination at the 2007 Academy Awards by campaigning with a live cow. She was not nominated for the award.\n\n"}

He is the grandson of Glen Wood, one of the famous Wood Brothers who founded what has become the NASCAR Cup Series' longest continuously active team.\n\nWood was given his first go kart as a child by Dale Jarrett, the Wood Brothers' driver at the time. After racing go-karts, he moved up to stock cars, racing in the USAR Hooters Pro Cup Series and the NASCAR Winston West Series. Wood made his NASCAR debut in the 2001 Craftsman Truck Series at Martinsville Speedway, driving the #15 Ford F-150 for Billy Ballew Motorsports. He started and finished 31st after suffering rear end failures. The release of Chuck Hossfeld allowed Wood to drive Roush Racing's #50 Eldon Ford for the rest of the year. He claimed a pair of top five finishes (Kansas and Fontana) in his limited appearances. In 2002, Jon ran the entire schedule, earning ten top-10s with sponsorship from the United States Navy. That year, he made his Busch Series debut at IRP, subbing for Jeff Burton in the #9 Gain Ford Taurus. He started and finished 6th that day.\n\nIn 2003, Wood notched two poles, 10 top fives and 20 top ten finishes, including two wins on his way to a fifth-place standing in the Craftsman Truck Series points. He ran most of the season with sponsored by Bob Graham. He ran his second Busch race that season at the Ford 300 in the #15 for ppc Racing. He finished 22nd. Unfortunately, the 2004 Craftsman Truck Series season was a struggle for Wood, who was forced to run unsponsored for virtually the entire season.\n\nWood moved to NASCAR's Busch Series full-time in 2005, driving for ST Motorsports (which later merged with the Wood Brothers to form Wood Brothers/JTG in 2006.) Wood had two top-fives and finished fifteenth in points, finishing fourth in the Rookie of the Year standings. In August 2005, Wood was released from his development contract with Roush Racing and became a member of the Wood Brothers driver development program. Wood had one top-five finish in 2006 and moved up one spot in the standings.\n\nOriginally, plans called for Wood to move up to Nextel Cup full-time in 2007; however, because of sponsor issues and the need for more experience, Wood ran only a partial schedule during the 2007 Nextel Cup season. Wood was to continue to drive full-time in the #47 Clorox-sponsored Ford Fusion in the Busch Series but was pulled from the ride following medical issues. He spent the rest of the season back in the Truck Series in the #21 Ford and had six top-tens in eleven starts as well as a pole position. He shared the #21 truck in 2008 with his cousin Keven but only had two top-ten finishes. He also made three Sprint Cup starts that season but failed to finish higher than 33rd. At the end of the season, the truck team for which Woods was running closed down and he has not raced since late 2010.\n\nAfter retiring from racing, Wood now serves as the Senior Vice President (formerly the Director of Business Development) for Wood Brothers Racing where he actively participates in the day to day operations of the company’s merchandising and business development. \n\n"}

The chain also once operated in the United States and Canada but exited those countries in 2004. Currently Chi-Chi's is also a brand of Mexican-themed grocery foods (later purchased by Hormel) with an emphasis on salsa.\n\nChi-Chi's was founded in 1975 in Richfield, Minnesota, a suburb of Minneapolis, by restaurateur Marno McDermott (his wife's nickname was \"Chi Chi\") and former Green Bay Packers player Max McGee. MacDermott had previously founded the Zapata fast-food Mexican chain, which later became Zantigo. From 1977 to 1986, the chain was run by former KFC executive Dula Brown. When Dula took leadership, the chain moved its headquarters to his hometown of Louisville.\nBy March 1995, the chain had grown to 210 locations.\n\nIn 2001, Chi-Chi's applied for a trademark on the word \"salsafication\" but was denied by the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board.\nThe company's slogans were \"A celebration of food\" and, later, \"Life always needs a little salsa.\"\n\nChi-Chi's last owner while the company was still in business in the U.S. and Canada was Prandium Inc., which had filed for bankruptcy several times, including in 1993 as Restaurant Enterprises Group Inc. and again in 2002 as Prandium. On October 8, 2003, Chi-Chi's and Koo Koo Roo, another Prandium subsidiary, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy themselves.\n\nIn November 2003, a month after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, Chi-Chi's was hit with the largest hepatitis A outbreak in U.S. history, with at least four deaths and 660 other victims of illness in the Pittsburgh area, including high school students who caught the disease from the original victims. The hepatitis was traced back to green onions at the Chi-Chi's at Beaver Valley Mall near Monaca, Pennsylvania, about northwest of Pittsburgh. Chi-Chi's settled the hepatitis A lawsuits by July 2004. At the time the suits were settled, Chi-Chi's had only 65 restaurants, fewer than half of the number of four years prior.\n\nIn August 2004, Outback Steakhouse bid $42.5 million for the rights to buy its choice of Chi-Chi's 76 properties, but did not purchase the Chi-Chi's name, operations, or recipes. On the weekend of September 18, 2004, Chi-Chi's closed all 65 of its remaining restaurants. Outback had hoped to convert many of the properties to its own restaurants, but instead eventually sold the majority of the properties to Kimco Realty Corporation, a real estate investment trust company in New Hyde Park, New York.\n\nChi-Chi's master franchise now belongs to a Swiss company which franchises Chi-Chi's in Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and North Africa, the best-represented country being Belgium, with 3 units.\n\nHormel Foods, which had bought the rights to use the Chi-Chi's brand on grocery items, continues to produce Chi-Chi's salsa and related products, and uses the chichis.com domain name to market them.\n\n"}

He was drafted third overall by the Washington Redskins, who had given up two first-round picks (16th and 24th) plus a fourth and fifth-round choice to move up to third in the first round. Samuels was the only offensive tackle drafted in the top 19 of the draft, and the first Alabama offensive lineman selected in the first round of an NFL Draft since Bob Cryder in 1978.\n\nSamuels immediately became the starting left tackle for the Redskins and was then selected to six Pro Bowls.

There are many Latinisms in English, and other (especially European) languages. \n\nOn the basic level of particular words and lexemes, creation and adoption of Latinisms has a long history, dating back to the ancient times. Early lexical Latinisms are attested in various languages that came into contact with Latin language during the expansion of ancient Roman culture. The same process continued during the Middle Ages, and acquired new forms in modern times under the influence of scientific terminology, largely based on the Scientific Latin. As a particular subgroup of lexical Latinisms, various onomastic Latinisms are formed through Latinisation of proper names, including personal names and toponyms.\n\nRenewed interest in Classical Latin literature during the Renaissance period resulted in the emergence of various forms of syntactical Latinisms, manifested by a tendency of renaissance and later authors to shape the syntax of their sentences according to rhetorical style used by Classical Latin authors, like Cicero and Caesar.\n\nIdiomatic Latinisms are phrases or idioms that are adopted from Latin language, or modeled according to Latin phraseology. \n\n"}

The company also operates Central Market, an upscale organic and fine foods retailer. As of 2017, the company has a total revenue surpassing 25 billion. H-E-B ranked No. 12 on \"Forbes\" 2019 list of \"America's Largest Private Companies\". H-E-B was named Retailer of the Year in 2010 by \"Progressive Grocer\". \"Supermarket News\" ranks H-E-B 13th on the list of \"Top 75 North American Food Retailers\" by sales. Based on 2014 revenues, H-E-B is the 20th largest retailer in the United States. It donates 5% of pre-tax profits to charity.\n\nThe company was founded on November 26, 1905, when Florence Butt opened the C.C. Butt Grocery Store on the ground floor of her family home in Kerrville, Texas. In 1919, Howard Edward Butt, Florence's youngest son, took over the store upon his return from World War I. Shortly after becoming owner of his mother's small store, Howard tried four expansions into Central Texas, including one in Junction, all of which failed. Finally, in 1927, Howard launched a successful second store in Del Rio, Texas, followed by the purchase of three grocery stores in the Lower Rio Grande Valley. The initials of Howard E. Butt became the name of the store.\n\nCharles, the younger son of Howard E. Butt, became president of H-E-B in 1971. As of 2019, Charles Butt is chairman and CEO of H-E-B, having grown the business from annual sales of $250 million in 1971 to $13 billion in 2006. In 2010, Craig Boyan was named H-E-B's President and COO. By 2018, Martin Otto, the former CFO and Chief Merchant, had become the COO. In 2011, the company was #12 H-E-B is the largest privately held company and largest private employer in Texas.\nH-E-B acquired Favor Delivery as a wholly owned subsidiary in February 2018. The details of the merger were not disclosed.\n\nIn 2019, H-E-B is investing millions of dollars to replace cashier stations with self-checkout kiosks or smartphone apps, at the same time that many other supermarkets (such as Walmart, Target, etc) are shifting towards more self-checkout lane and app usage, and displacing cashiers.\n\nHeadquartered in Downtown San Antonio, H-E-B operates more than 300 stores in over 150 communities across Texas. As of late 2010, its operations serve approximately \"55-plus\" percent of the Texas market, according to \"Progressive Grocer\", with primary Texas markets including the Corpus Christi, San Antonio, Austin, Laredo and Houston metro areas. The company does business in five different retail formats: general H-E-B stores, Central Market, H-E-B Plus, Mi Tienda and Joe V's Smart Shop. In 2010, the company announced plans to build 19 new stores in Texas. H-E-B opened its first store outside of Texas in 1996, a H-E-B Pantry store in Lake Charles, Louisiana; though the expansion was, in comparison, short-lived and ultimately failed to catch on, either with planners or with the community. The H-E-B Pantry store format was discontinued in 2000, and the company closed its sole Louisiana store in 2003. In 2010, H-E-B offered consumers the opportunity to vote on possible designs for new stores as they expand into new communities.\n\nThe company operates several manufacturing facilities in Texas, including one of the largest milk- and bread-processing plants in the Southwest. H-E-B produces many of their own-brand products, including milk, ice cream, bread, snacks, and ready-cooked meats and meals. These and other private-label products are sold under various brands, including \"Central Market Naturals\", \"Central Market Organics\",\"H-E-B\", \"H-E-Buddy\", \"Hill Country Fare\", \"H-E-B Creamy Creations\" ice cream, \"H-E-B Mootopia\" milk, and \"H-E-B Fully Cooked.\"\n\nSeveral stores include multi-tenant operations through third-party lease arrangements.

Common nationally recognized tenants include Sprint-Nextel, IBC Bank, Enterprise Rent-A-Car, Panda Express, Chase Bank, Flexi-Compras, Auntie Anne's Pretzel, AT&T, Gold & Silver Buyers, Wells Fargo, and Maui Wowi.\n\nThe H-E-B corporate offices have more authority over decision-making at individual H-E-B outlets in San Antonio than Foodarama does over individual La Fiesta chains in San Antonio. Because H-E-B is a regional chain, Elizabeth Allen of the \"San Antonio Express-News\" said that it is more \"nimble\" than national grocery companies such as Albertsons.\n\nThe Austin Business Journal rated H-E-B as the largest private-sector employer in the region in 2017.\n\nIn 2019 the company announced plans to build a technology center at its headquarters complex.\n\nIn 1994, H-E-B introduced its Central Market concept in Austin. Based in Austin, Central Market offers an organic and international food selection, including a European-style bakery and extensive wine and beer selections. The chain is now composed of eight stores, two in Austin and one each in Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston, Plano, San Antonio, and Southlake. H-E-B operates four different formats of stores that introduce general merchandise and elements of the Central Market concept: The \"Woodlands Market\" in The Woodlands in Montgomery County, \"Kingwood Market\" in the Kingwood section of Houston, and the \"Austin-Escarpment\" store in south Austin. A fourth store opened on March 22, 2008 in West Lake Hills, and in 2009, the H-E-B in Bee Caves was remodeled. H-E-B's \"Alon Market\" opened on October 17, 2008 in San Antonio. In October 2007, H-E-B opened its \"Cypress Market\" store, located at the intersection of Highway 290 and Barker-Cypress. In November 2007, the \"Vintage Market\" store opened in northwest Harris County in greater Houston. In November 2012, H-E-B opened its second Cypress store, \"Fairfield Market\", located at the intersection of Highway 290 and Mason Road to serve the master-planned community of Fairfield and surrounding areas.\n\nIn July 2015, the Market concept was expanded as a new \"Spring Creek Market\" was opened in southern Montgomery County in Spring, Texas on Rayford Road adjacent to the new Texas State Highway 99 to serve the expanding suburb of Houston.\n\nIn 2004, the company launched three (in Austin, Corpus Christi, and Waco) \"H-E-B Plus!\" stores with an expanded focus on non-food categories, such as entertainment and other general merchandise. The company added three additional locations in 2005 (Corpus Christi, Round Rock and San Antonio). The stores offered several new departments including Do-It-Yourself and Texas Backyard, and greatly expanded product categories in baby, card and party, cosmetics, entertainment, housewares and toys.\n\nSeveral other locations were later added, including stores in Flour Bluff, Corpus Christi, Bastrop, Beaumont, Belton, Boerne, Katy, Killeen, Cypress, Victoria, Kyle, Laredo, Leander, Mission, Rio Grande City, San Juan, San Antonio, Midland, Pearland, Copperas Cove \nand Hutto.\n\nIn 2006, H-E-B opened \"Mi Tienda\" in South Houston (adjacent to Pasadena) in Greater Houston - a Latino-themed store. Another Mi Tienda opened in north Houston in 2011; it is twice the size of the original location, and has of space. This second location is off of Little York and U.S. Route 59. Mi Tienda, which means \"my store\" in Spanish, sells Mexican baked goods; a tortilleria, where employees make tortillas; and a carniceria providing marinated cuts of chicken, beef and pork. In addition, Mi Tienda also houses the Cocina restaurant, which serves Mexican food and drinks.\n\nIn 2010, H-E-B opened \"Joe V's Smart Shop\", a brand featuring discount items modeled after discount grocer Aldi. The first location opened was a store located in northwest unincorporated Harris County, Texas, near northwest Houston. The store format is smaller compared with a full-service H-E-B store but double the size of an H-E-B Pantry store. A larger, second location with a space opened in December in northeast unincorporated Harris County, Texas. As of 2016, there are seven Joe V's stores. The \"Joe V\" name was based on the name of an executive of the company who was involved in the development of this store format.\n\nTrue Texas BBQ is located inside select H‑E‑B stores.\n\nH-E-B crossed the $1 billion mark annual sales mark in Mexico in 2012.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, local grocery chains Handy Andy and Centeno joined a lawsuit against H-E-B citing unfair pricing practices. H-E-B eventually settled the suit out of court with Centeno in 1998 for $6.5 million and with Handy Andy for an undisclosed settlement amount.\nH-E-B has paid $12 million to settle a whistleblower lawsuit accusing the San Antonio-based grocery chain of Medicaid fraud. Since at least 2006, according to the suit, H-E-B allegedly submitted to Texas Medicaid inflated prices on thousands of claims for prescriptions it filled so the company could obtain higher reimbursements than allowed.\n\nThe company gives five percent of annual pretax earnings to causes in the areas in which it operates, including education and food banks. The Excellence in Education Awards are an annual charitable program maintained by H-E-B since 2000, in which teachers, administrators and schools in Texas are recognized, with awards totaling $500,000 in contributions in 2009.\n\nH-E-B coordinated donations to relief efforts in the wake of a fertilizer plant fire and explosion in West, Texas. The company donated $50,000 to the American Red Cross and launched a checkstand campaign benefiting the organization to get the community involved in the relief effort. The company said in a news release 100 percent of the donations from the campaign will support the American Red Cross’s disaster relief efforts. H-E-B also activated its emergency response units, sending the H-E-B Eddie Garcia Mobile Kitchen and water tanker to West, including donations of meals and water to the victims and first responders.\n\nIn the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey in 2017, H-E-B donated $100,000 toward its relief efforts. Its campaign drive for customer contributions totaled $1,000,000. In addition, H-E-B's Mobile Kitchen and Disaster Relief Units distributed 10,000 hot meals to volunteers and victims in the affected areas in Texas.\n\n"}

{"id": "2028274", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2028274", "title": "Alaskeros", "text": "Alaskeros\n\nThe Alaskeros are Filipino seasonal migrant workers in the United States and their descendants. They worked in salmon canneries in Alaska during the summer, and on farms on the west coast during the rest of the year. The Alaskeros were instrumental in the formation of the first Filipino-led union in the U.S., the Cannery Workers and Farm Laborers Union, Local 7 (Seattle, WA).\n\nAfter Spain relinquished the Philippine Islands to the U.S. under the Treaty of Paris in 1898, Filipinos became American nationals and had the ability to migrate to the U.S. to find a better life, while providing cheap labor for the agriculture and fish cannery industries. A large amount of these immigrants first started being recruited for work by contractors for the salmon canneries and mines in Alaska. In the canneries, Filipinos worked with other groups of Asians loading and unloading trucks; and line jobs consisting of sorting, gutting, cleaning, and packing fish. The tasks of maintenance and operations were assigned to the whites. After negotiations of the Gentlemen's Agreement with Japan in 1908, along the Chinese Exclusion Act in effect, Filipinos arrived to the U.S. in significant numbers, taking the place of a large amount of the Chinese and Japanese labor workers in the canneries.\n\nSeattle's International District became the homequarters for Alaskeros during the cold months of the year. They would share hotel and boardinghouse rooms to save money before sailing back up north to work in the canneries from late spring to late summer. The population of Alaskeros in Washington grew between 1910 and 1930 from 1700 to 3500. Nearly 1000 Filipinos were recruited by the Japanese and Chinese in 1921 to work in the Alaskan fisheries, and by the mid-1930s, they had become the dominant population in the canneries. Despite this fact, very few Filipinos became contractors, as they were halted from advancing past the position of foreman. This was mainly due to the fact of contractor positions were being held by mainly Japanese and Chinese employees. They entered into the canning industry before the Filipinos, and they held onto these jobs, while Filipinos worked as unskilled laborers in mechanized plants. Filipinos were dependent on whatever the Chinese and Japanese contractors made available to them, and their lack of proficiency in the English language as well as the difference in wages between the U.S. and the Philippines left them to be taken advantage of. The contractors would sell them items that were supposed to be compensated to the workers, such as food, work supplies, bedding and lodging. Sometimes, the contractors would take off without paying Filipino laborers their wages at the end of the season, leaving them without any money, and with no way to leave. Some Filipino foremen would charge the workers half a month's wages as a finder's fee for the cannery job. Unfortunately, mistreatment of fellow ethnics by more competent workers is a common occurrence in the migrant society.\n\nAlaskeros faced less discrimination in Alaska than in the U.S. mainland, mostly due to the native Eskimos and the large Asian community that was already present in the area. Some cannery workers lived in Alaska permanently, marrying Eskimo women and establishing their own communities there. In 1935, they formed the Filipino Community of Juneau. Because of the images portrayed by American educators in the Philippines, some Filipinos were under the impression that a way into American society was easily obtained through marriage, often taking up with \"women of color,\" and avoiding white women because of the social problems that might stir up. In California and Washington, white resentment against the Filipinos grew. Filipinos were often portrayed as sexual threats that wanted to mix with white and Mexican women, and concerns over \"hybridization\" caused several race riots to come to a head. Whites tried to drive out Filipinos from their communities. The incident near Watsonville, California, in 1930 was the most publicized- involving 400 white vigilantes targeted a Filipino dance club, beating many and killing one. The California state legislature responded by amending anti-miscegenation laws, prohibiting white-Filipino marriages, similar to the laws in 12 other U.S. states.\n\nIn 1953, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of union member Ernesto Mangaoang, who was jailed along with 30 other Alaskeros over communist implications, and established residency rights for thousands of Filipino Americans who entered the U.S. before the Philippines gained their independence in 1946.\n\nWages for low-skilled jobs like those in the Alaskan cannery deteriorated after the stock market crash in 1929, in the onset of the Great Depression. Filipino students made up a large part of the cannery workers and were among those in the group that were hit the hardest, having to take up seasonal jobs elsewhere that left little time for classes or even no time at all for school. Luckily, because of the strong sense of community in the Filipino culture, many Alaskeros were able to rely on their traditional system of mutual aid to help pull them through these hard times. Explained by a Filipino scholar, \" a Filipino can expect help and protection from his family and kin group, [but] he also has obligations to them.\"\nAmericans were constantly worried about losing their jobs, and many people who would otherwise works together in groups competed with each other over jobs and security. In 1935, the Welch Bill was funded with $300,000 to repatriate Filipinos- offering to send them back to the Philippines free of charge should they volunteer to go back. Only 5% of Filipinos took up the offer. The ones that remained had their legal status changed by the U.S. government, through the Tydings-McDuffie Act, from nationals to aliens, rendering them exempt from any sort of government aid. This action also limited immigration of Filipinos to 50 per year. This did not restrict them from being able to serve in the U.S. military, or even being called up under the draft in 1942. These restrictions on immigration were dissolved in 1952 with the introduction of the McCarran-Walter Act, which also provided for the nonquota of immigration for the Filipino-Americans' relatives. Filipinos made up the second largest group of immigrants after Mexicans by 1975.\n\nEconomic decline and a volatile work environment led Alaskeros to unionize and stand up for their rights. The Cannery Workers and Farm Laborer Union was created on June 19, 1933, in Seattle, representing Filipino laborers in Alaska's canneries. Shortly after, CWFLU was chartered as Local 18527 by the American Federation of Labor (AFL). By 1937, CWFLU had integrated with the United Cannery, Agricultural, Packinghouse, and Allied Workers of America (UCAPAW) under the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), becoming UCAPAWA-CIO Local 7, turning into Local 37 of the International Longshoremen and Warehousemen Union (ILWU) by the summer of 1950.\n\nIn the beginning, the CWFLU was very slow to unite the Filipino community of laborers in the canneries. It wasn't until two union leaders were murdered in 1936 did Filipinos rally behind the union for higher wages, better hours, and sanitary working conditions for its members. By 1938, the contract system was eliminated, and from that point on, hiring for the canneries was done through the union hall. When WWII started, union activity was limited to Filipino workers, while the internment of Japanese workers was brought about. Many of the cannery workers were enlisting in the military or finding jobs in defense industries, while governmental emergency controls banned strikes and initiated a wage freeze. Another wave of immigrants arrived at the canneries in the 1970s, and a separate organization was established called the Alaska Cannery Workers Association (ACWA). Local 37 was reformed, and by 1980, reformers had gained control of the union, which was changed to IBU/ILWU, Region 37 in 1987, which was actually a merging of the Longshoremen's Union and the Inland Boatmen's Union of the Pacific.\n\n\n"}

According to the theorem, once the spatial distribution of the electrons has been determined by solving the Schrödinger equation, all the forces in the system can be calculated using classical electrostatics.\n\nThe theorem has been proven independently by many authors, including Paul Güttinger (1932), Wolfgang Pauli (1933), Hans Hellmann (1937) and Richard Feynman (1939).\n\nThe theorem states\n\nwhere\n\n\nThis proof of the Hellmann–Feynman theorem requires that the wavefunction be an eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian under consideration; however, one can also prove more generally that the theorem holds for non-eigenfunction wavefunctions which are stationary (partial derivative is zero) for all relevant variables (such as orbital rotations). The Hartree–Fock wavefunction is an important example of an approximate eigenfunction that still satisfies the Hellmann–Feynman theorem. Notable example of where the Hellmann–Feynman is not applicable is for example finite-order Møller–Plesset perturbation theory, which is not variational.\n\nThe proof also employs an identity of normalized wavefunctions – that derivatives of the overlap of a wavefunction with itself must be zero. Using Dirac's bra–ket notation these two conditions are written as\n\nThe proof then follows through an application of the derivative product rule to the expectation value of the Hamiltonian viewed as a function of λ:\n\nThe Hellmann–Feynman theorem is actually a direct, and to some extent trivial, consequence of the variational principle (the Rayleigh-Ritz variational principle) from which the Schrödinger equation may be derived. This is why the Hellmann–Feynman theorem holds for wave-functions (such as the Hartree–Fock wave-function) that, though not eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian, do derive from a variational principle. This is also why it holds, e.g., in density functional theory, which is not wave-function based and for which the standard derivation does not apply.\n\nAccording to the Rayleigh–Ritz variational principle, the eigenfunctions of the Schrödinger equation are stationary points of the functional (which we nickname \"Schrödinger functional\" for brevity):\n\nThe eigenvalues are the values that the Schrödinger functional takes at the stationary points:\n\nwhere formula_11 satisfies the variational condition:\nLet us differentiate Eq. (3) using the chain rule:\nDue to the variational condition, Eq. (4), the second term in Eq. (5) vanishes. In one sentence, the Hellmann–Feynman theorem states that \"the derivative of the stationary values of a function(al) with respect to a parameter on which it may depend, can be computed from the explicit dependence only, disregarding the implicit one\". On account of the fact that the Schrödinger functional can only depend explicitly on an external parameter through the Hamiltonian, Eq. (1) trivially follows.\n\nThe most common application of the Hellmann–Feynman theorem is to the calculation of intramolecular forces in molecules. This allows for the calculation of equilibrium geometries – the nuclear coordinates where the forces acting upon the nuclei, due to the electrons and other nuclei, vanish. The parameter λ corresponds to the coordinates of the nuclei. For a molecule with 1 ≤ \"i\" ≤ \"N\" electrons with coordinates {r}, and 1 ≤ α ≤ \"M\" nuclei, each located at a specified point {R={\"X\",\"Y\",\"Z\")} and with nuclear charge \"Z\", the clamped nucleus Hamiltonian is\n\nThe x-component of the force acting on a given nucleus is equal to the negative of the derivative of the total energy with respect to that coordinate. Employing the Hellmann–Feynman theorem this is equal to\n\nOnly two components of the Hamiltonian contribute to the required derivative – the electron-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus terms. Differentiating the Hamiltonian yields\n\nInsertion of this in to the Hellmann–Feynman theorem returns the x-component of the force on the given nucleus in terms of the electronic density (\"ρ\"(r)) and the atomic coordinates and nuclear charges:\n\nAn alternative approach for applying the Hellmann–Feynman theorem is to promote a fixed or discrete parameter which appears in a Hamiltonian to be a continuous variable solely for the mathematical purpose of taking a derivative. Possible parameters are physical constants or discrete quantum numbers. As an example, the radial Schrödinger equation for a hydrogen-like atom is\n\nwhich depends upon the discrete azimuthal quantum number \"l\". Promoting \"l\" to be a continuous parameter allows for the derivative of the Hamiltonian to be taken:\n\nThe Hellmann–Feynman theorem then allows for the determination of the expectation value of formula_18 for hydrogen-like atoms:\n\nIn computing the energy derivative we need to know how formula_20 depends on formula_21. We usually think of these quantum numbers as being independent, but here we must vary the solutions so as to keep the number of nodes in the wavefunction fixed. The number of nodes is formula_22, so formula_23.\n\nIn the end of Feynman's paper, he states that, \"Van der Waals's forces can also be interpreted as arising from charge distributions \nwith higher concentration between the nuclei. The Schrödinger perturbation theory for two interacting atoms at a separation \"R\", large compared to the radii of the atoms, leads to the result that the charge distribution of each is distorted from central \nsymmetry, a dipole moment of order 1/\"R\" being induced in each atom. The negative charge distribution of each atom has its center of gravity moved slightly toward the other. It is not the interaction of these dipoles which leads to van der Waals's force, but rather the attraction of each nucleus for the distorted charge distribution of its \"own\" electrons that gives the attractive 1/\"R\" force.\"\n\nFor a general time-dependent wavefunction satisfying the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, the Hellmann–Feynman theorem is not valid.\nHowever, the following identity holds:\n\nFor\n\nThe proof only relies on the Schrödinger equation and the assumption that partial derivatives with respect to λ and t can be interchanged.\n"}

It was produced by Anthony Cardoza, Roland Morin and Jim Oliphant.\n\nThe film stars Swedish former wrestler Tor Johnson as \"the Beast\". It starred Anthony Cardoza, Coleman Francis and Jim Oliphant in bit parts, as well as Conrad Brooks in a very small role. Director Francis cast his two sons (Ronald and Alan Francis) in the film as the two lost boys.\n\nThe plot concerns a Soviet scientist named Joseph Jaworsky (Tor Johnson), who defects and flees to a Nevada Test Site called Yucca Flats, only to be turned into a mindless monster by atomic radiation, stalking the desert. The film has very little dialogue and most of the speech is done by omniscient narration.\n\nSome critics have characterized the film as one of the worst science fiction horror films made, and one of the all-time worst films of any kind, even suggesting that it may be worse than Ed Wood's legendarily bad \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\". In 1995, the television comedy series \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\" featured \"The Beast of Yucca Flats\", helping the film develop a cult status.\n\nA woman (Lanell Cado) steps out of a shower and is attacked and strangled to death by a mysterious man as a clock ticks, then stops.\n\nLater (or possibly before) in Yucca Flats, Nevada, Soviet scientist Joseph Javorsky (Johnson) has defected from the USSR and arrives in America with a briefcase carrying various military secrets, including the Soviet moon landing. Javorsky and his American contacts are suddenly attacked by a pair of KGB assassins (Cardoza and John Morrison) killing Javorsky's contacts and bodyguards. Javorsky flees into the desert, walking for a great distance, and the searing heat causes him to discard much of his clothing. When he wanders in range of an American nuclear test, the bewildered Russian is transformed by it into a mindless beast with an uncontrollable urge to kill. He proceeds to murder a couple in their car on a nearby road, prompting pursuit from police officers Jim Archer (Stafford) and Joe Dobson (Aten).\n\nMeanwhile, a vacationing family ventures along the same road. After stopping at a service station, the family's two young sons (Ronald and Alan Francis) wander off into the surrounding desert where they eventually encounter and escape from the mutated Javorsky. Their father (Douglas Mellor) searches for them, but is mistaken for the killer by one of the police officers, who is searching for the murderer from the air in a small plane. The officer opens fire with a high-powered rifle on the innocent man, who manages to escape.\n\nEventually, the family is reunited and the police shoot and mortally wound Javorsky. A jackrabbit later nuzzles his dying body, and using the last of his strength, he caresses it before dying.\n\n\nThe setting for the film, \"Yucca Flats,\" was based on the real-life Yucca Flat, which has been called \"the most irradiated, nuclear-blasted spot on the face of the earth\". In 1970, nine years after the film was made, 86 workers were exposed to radiation during the Yucca Flat Baneberry Test. In March 2009, \"Time\" identified the accident as one of the world's worst nuclear disasters. Actual shooting locations for the film were all in California: Santa Clarita (desert scenes), Saugus (airplane scenes) and Van Nuys (opening scene interior).\n\nThe movie was filmed without a soundtrack. Narration, voice-overs and some sound effects were added in post-production. To avoid having to synchronize the audio to the picture, characters speak only when their faces are either off-screen or not clearly visible due to darkness or distance. Likewise, during scenes in which firearms are used, the muzzles of the guns are usually out of shot when the weapons are fired. During scenes of gunplay, many characters appear at first to have suffered life-threatening bullet wounds, only to appear in later scenes fully recovered with no visible signs of having been wounded. Extensive narration is used in lieu of plot points being conveyed through dialogue. Film historian Bill Warren stated \"The AFI catalog says (the film) may have been reissued in 1964 as \"Girl Madness\"\"\n\nAccording to producer Anthony Cardoza, the film's closing scene in which Johnson's character, expressing a final bit of humanity, embraces a jackrabbit, was not planned; a wild rabbit entered the shot while the camera was rolling, and Johnson improvised.\n\nThe film's total budget was estimated at $34,000.\n\nThe first scene in the film is the strangulation murder of a woman (played by Lanell Cado) who has just stepped out of a shower, by a man whose face is never shown; it is implied that the killer raped her corpse. The murderer is dressed like Javorsky after the blast, but the murder is never mentioned during the actual film, nor is there any apparent place in the narrative where it could be said to occur.\nAccording to an interview with producer Cardoza by film historian Tom Weaver, the scene was added after the film was complete because director Francis liked nude scenes. Some prints (such as the one used for the \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\" episode) were edited to show the woman clothed for the duration of the scene (running 81 seconds), with the only nudity being a brief flash of breast as she towels herself in front of a mirror. The 2003 Alpha Video DVD print has a slightly longer version of the scene (running 93 seconds), where the woman is shown naked as she puts on a pair of underwear, with both breasts visible several times before she is shown walking out of the room.\n\n\"The Beast of Yucca Flats\" was first released on DVD by Image Entertainment on September 5, 2000, followed by numerous later DVD releases. It was released by Alpha Video on November 18, 2003, and by Image Entertainment on December 30, 2003 as a part of a double feature with \"Mesa of Lost Women\" (1953). It was released as a part of a 12-disc \"Horror Classics Collection\" by Digital 1 Stop on January 20, 2004. Platinum Disc released the film on June 7, 2005, and again on August 23 as a part of several multi-disc collections; Mill Creek Entertainment released the film on July 5, 2005. In 2006, it was released by Digiview Entertainment and ST Clair Vision on May 9 and October 17, respectively. ST Clair Vision re-released it on June 26, 2007. Releases by Direct Source and Mill Creek Entertainment, as part of multi-film collections, also appeared in 2007. ST Clair Vision re-released the film one more time on May 20, 2008. In 2010, \"The Beast of Yucca Flats\" was released three separate times by TNT Media Group and Echo Bridge Home Entertainment. On August 20, 2013, Mill Creek released it as part of a 3-disc, 12-film collection, \"The Best of the Worst Film Pack\". The film was last released by Echo Bridge on September 1, 2015.\n\n\"The Beast of Yucca Flats\" was universally panned by critics upon its release, with many considering it one of the worst films ever made.\nAuthor and film critic Leonard Maltin awarded the film one star, or 'BOMB', calling it \"one of the worst films ever made\". In his review, Maltin criticized the overuse of voiceover narration, and an opening sequence unrelated to the main story.\nBruce Eder from AllMovie panned the film, criticizing the film's \"pretentious and obtuse narration\" and further stating, \"The most enjoyable aspect of this movie is its remarkably short running time\".\n\"VideoHound's Golden Movie Retriever\" awarded the film their lowest rating, calling it \"A really cheap, quasi-nuclear protest film.\"\nOn his website \"Fantastic Movie Musings and Ramblings\", Dave Sindelar panned the film's \"maddening\" voice-over narration, editing, and apparent lack of a real storyline.\n\"TV Guide\" awarded the film 1.5 out of 4 stars, writing, \"In an honest attempt to make a brief protest picture, the producers apparently didn't have enough money to accord this any sort of production value.\"\n\n\nBibliography\n\n"}

An elderly Cree woman, who warns them that they must kill a boy to prevent one sister from killing the other; she gives them each a pendant. As their startled horse runs off, Brigitte's foot is caught in a bear trap. Ginger seeks help, but a Cree man (known as \"The Hunter\") frees Brigitte before she returns. He leads them to Fort Bailey, where they take refuge. Ginger says they are the daughters of a drowned trader and are seeking passage east.\n\nWerewolves have besieged the fort for some time. Murphy, the fort's physician, inspects Brigitte’s wound and applies a leech, surreptitiously testing for werewolf infection. They are given a room that belonged to Wallace's son. Awakened by a voice, Ginger investigates the corridors, where she eventually finds the source: a deformed boy kept in a small, bolted unlit room; he bites her shoulder as he flees.\n\nWhen Ginger and Brigitte attempt to leave, James confronts them. While Ginger and James are fighting, werewolves attack, killing one of the residents. Reverend Gilbert leads the sisters to an allegedly safe building, which actually contains a werewolf. The sisters run up the stairs, chased by the werewolf, but The Hunter appears and kills it. As Ginger and Brigitte are going to their room Ginger's nose starts to bleed, which is a sign that she is infected.\n\nThe sisters discover the boy who bit Ginger is Wallace's son, Geoffrey. As Ginger sleeps, he sneaks into the bedroom and wakes her. She tries to grab him, but he gets away, taking a lock of her hair; Geoffrey then kills a man who investigates the noise, and frames Ginger for his murder. James holds Brigitte captive as the others drag Ginger away. Wallace arrives, he dismisses James, and makes a deal with Brigitte: her sister's life in exchange for their silence regarding his son. Wallace and Brigitte find Ginger at the doctor's, strapped to the examination table and held at gunpoint, about to be tested with a leech. When Wallace demands they release Ginger, Murphy ignores the order. Wallace shoots him dead, which prompts the other men to leave.\n\nDetermined to kill Geoffrey, Ginger finds him as he cries and holds his dead mother's hand at his mother's grave. He escapes and is captured instead by the men. Wallace arrives and kills his son himself. The sisters' protection at an end, Ginger is forced to leave, and Brigitte goes with her. Desperate for a cure, the sisters go to The Hunter's cave.\n\nAt the cave, The Hunter and Native American seer woman reveal the sisters' coming had long been prophesied and that the Red and the Black would decide the destiny of the werewolf bloodline. After Brigitte enters a trancelike state, she has a vision of her destiny - The Hunter attempts to kill Ginger, and she kills her sister herself. As Brigitte emerges from the trance she finds the seer is dead, killed by Ginger, who has fled. The Hunter leads Brigitte back to the fort.\n\nBack at the fort, Brigitte is taken prisoner. Gilbert goes to her, telling her to beg forgiveness to save her soul; instead, Brigitte spits in his face. He drags her out onto the parade square, and prepares to burn her alive but is interrupted by Wallace who runs him through with his sword before setting him on fire. James engages Ginger in a fight and she slashes his throat. As he falls to the ground, bleeding to death, Ginger opens the gates and ushers in the werewolves that attack and kill two of the men. Wallace is soon bitten and sets the fort on fire before killing himself. The Hunter urges Brigitte to kill her sister, instead, she kills him and flees with Ginger.\n\nOnly Ginger and Brigitte left alive. Brigitte then holds out her hand and presses a cut on it against a cut on Ginger's hand, mixing their blood and infecting herself.\n\n\n\"Ginger Snaps Back: The Beginning\" was shot back-to-back with \"\".\n\nThe film premiered at the Fantasia International Film Festival on July 10, 2004. After the disappointment of the second film's theatrical run, \"Ginger Snaps Back: The Beginning\" was released direct-to-DVD. Lionsgate released it on August 27, 2004 in Canada and on September 7, 2004 in United States.\n\nRotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 60% of five surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating was 6.2/10. Bloody Disgusting rated it 5/5 stars and said, \"It surpasses its two predecessors by leaps and bounds.\" Joshua Siebalt of Dread Central rated it 2.5/5 and wrote that the film does not live up to the previous installments of the series. Brett Cullum of DVD Verdict wrote, \"It's not quite up to snuff with what came before, but it still takes Canadian horror above and beyond anything Hollywood has been cranking out lately.\"\n\n"}

A price mechanism affect both buyer and seller who negotiate prices. A price mechanism, part of a market system, comprises various ways to match up buyers and sellers. \nPrice mechanism is a mechanism where price plays a key role in directing the activities of producers, consumers, resource suppliers.\nAn example of a price mechanism uses announced bid and ask prices. Generally speaking, when two parties wish to engage in trade, the purchaser will announce a price he is willing to pay (the bid price) and seller will announce a price he is willing to accept (the ask price).\n\nThe primary advantage of such a method is that conditions are laid out in advance and transactions can proceed with no further permission or authorization from any participant. When any bid and ask pair are compatible, a transaction occurs, in most cases automatically.\n\nUnder a price mechanism, if demand increases, prices will rise, causing a movement along the supply curve.\n\nFor example: the oil crisis of the 1970s drove oil prices dramatically upwards, which in turn caused several countries to begin producing oil domestically. \n\nA price mechanism affects every economic situation in the long term. Price Mechanism plays a vital role in determining prices in a capitalist economy. An example of the effects of a price mechanism in the long run involves fuel for cars. If fuel becomes more expensive, then the demand for fuel would not decrease fast but eventually companies will start to produce alternatives such as biodiesel fuel and electrical cars.\nA price mechanism is a system by which the allocation of resources and distribution of goods and services are made on the basis of relative market price.\nThere are two important elements of price mechanism –\n1. PRICES - prices are essence of price mechanism. price mechanism works through prices in a free enterprise economy, where all goods and services carry price tags with them. a whole set of prices prevail in such an economy. goods and services are available at a price because it involves cost in producing these goods and services. consumers have to pay some prices if they want to buy some goods like food, clothes, etc. producers are willing to sell goods and services only if they get the appropriate price.\n2. MARKET - forces of demand and supply operate within the framework of market. market constitute an integral part of the price mechanism \"A market means a system or a set-up in which the buyers and sellers of the commodity are able to interact and communicate with each other and strike a deal, i.e., price and the quantity to be bought and sold. \"\n\nWhen trading in a stock market, a person who has shares to sell may not wish to sell them at the current market price (quote). Likewise, a person who wishes to buy shares may not wish to pay the current market price either. Some negotiation is necessary in order for a transaction to occur.\n\nThe negotiation often comes in the form of adjusting the bid prices and the ask prices as the value of the share goes up and down. For example, if the share is worth $10, a buyer may \"bid\" $9.97 (3 cents less), and a seller may ask for $10.02 (2 cents more). If the value of the stock goes down, a seller may be forced to reduce his asking price. Conversely, if the value of the stock goes up, a buyer may be forced to increase his bidding price.\n\nMost of the time, the bid and ask prices remain very close to the market value of the share, often separated by only a couple of cents. The difference between the bid and ask price is called the Bid/ask spread.\n\nIn actual trading, the parties involved might use a limit order to specify which bid or ask price they wishe to trade at. The traders specifies the number of shares and their bid/ask price (depending on whether they are buying or selling). Such orders can have execution limits, such as \"by end of day\" or \"all or nothing\".\n\nAn auction is a price mechanism where bidders can make competing offers for a good. The minimum bid may or may not be set by the seller, who may choose to predetermine a minimum asking price. The highest bidder would be awarded the transaction.\n\nIf the terms \"pay\" and \"sell\" are understood very generally, then, a very broad range of applications and different market systems can be enabled this way. Internet dating for instance could be based on offers to talk for a period of time, accepted by those who are compensated not in money but in additional credits to keep using the system. Or, a political party could trade support for different measures in a platform, perhaps using allocation voting to \"bid\" a certain amount of support for a measure that a leader has \"asked\" them to support: if the measure has enough support in the party, the leader will proceed; a very explicit model of so-called \"political capital\".\n\nThough there are many concerns about liquidating any given transaction, even in a conventional market, there are ideologies which hold that the risks are outweighed by the efficient rendezvous. In greenhouse gas emissions trading, companies doing the \"bidding\" argue that Earth's atmosphere can be seen as affected almost uniformly by emissions anywhere on Earth. They argue further that, as a result, there are almost no local effects, and only a measurable and widely agreed climate change effect, of a greenhouse gas emission, justifying a \"cap and trade\" approach. Somewhat more controversially, the approach was applied even earlier to sulfur dioxide emissions in the United States, and was quite successful in reducing overall smog output there.\n\nIn most applications of such methods, however, the comprehensive outcome of the transaction is not so easily measured or universally agreed. Some theorists assert that, with appropriate controls, a market mechanism can replace a hierarchy, even a command hierarchy, by ordering actions for which the highest bid is received:\n\nAn infamous example is the assassination market proposed by Timothy C. May, which were effectively bets on someone's death. This has since been generalized into the prediction market idea which the Pentagon proposed to operate as part of Total Information Awareness; however, this proved controversial as it would theoretically let assassins predict and then benefit from their predictions, which they would cause to come true. This is a problem even with the commodity markets and any other financial markets, where a single person's choices or fate might be influenced, predicted, or decided by someone already in the market.\n\nSo price mechanism is a technique by which inflation is controlled. The price can only be increased if the supply is less and has more demand for the same.\n\nLess controversial applications of bid and ask matching include:\n\n"}
{"id": "2028313", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2028313", "title": "Drawing Restraint 9", "text": "Drawing Restraint 9\n\nDrawing Restraint 9 is a 2005 film project by visual artist Matthew Barney consisting of a feature-length film, large-scale sculptures, photographs, drawings, and books. The Drawing Restraint series consists of 19 numbered components and related materials. Some episodes are videos, others sculptural installations or drawings. Barney created \"Drawing Restraint 1-6\" while still an undergraduate at Yale University and completed \"Drawing Restraint 16\" in 2007 at London's Serpentine Gallery. With a soundtrack composed by Björk, \"Drawing Restraint 9\" is an unconventional love story set in Japan. The narrative structure is built upon themes such as the Shinto religion, the tea ceremony, the history of whaling, and the supplantation of blubber with refined petroleum for oil.\n\nThe film primarily takes place aboard the Japanese factory whaling vessel, the Nisshin Maru, in the Sea of Japan, as it makes its annual journey to Antarctica. Two storylines occur simultaneously on the vessel: one on deck and one beneath. The narrative on deck involves the process of casting a 25-ton petroleum jelly sculpture (one of Barney’s signature materials), which rivals the scale of a whale. Below deck, the two main characters participate as guests in a tea ceremony, where they are formally engaged after arriving on the ship as strangers. As the film progresses, the guests go through an emotional and physical transformation slowly transfiguring from land mammals into sea mammals, as they fall in love. The petroleum jelly sculpture simultaneously passes through changing states, from warm to cool, and from the architectural back to the primordial. The dual narratives, the sculptural and the romantic, come to reflect one another until the climactic point at which they become completely mutual.\n\n\"Drawing Restraint 9\" premiered at the 62nd Venice Film Festival and was screened at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2005. IFC Films acquired the U.S. theatrical rights to \"Drawing Restraint 9\" and distributed the film to screen in 18 cities across the U.S. in the fall of 2006.\n\nThe film opens with the careful, ceremonial wrapping of two unidentifiable organic objects in several layers of carefully folded decorative paper, an activity known in Japanese as \"tsutsumi\" or \"orikata\", sealed with twine and gold field emblems and finished with a sliver of white shell. The centre strips of the field emblems, a recurring symbol in Barney's works, are then pulled off, a frequently repeated motif throughout the film. The scene moves to Nagasaki bay where a celebratory procession of dancers, animals and floats approaches the docks as the crew of the whaling ship finish construction on the shore.\n\nAfter the opening credits, a field emblem mould is assembled on the deck of the \"Nisshin Maru\" and filled with molten petroleum jelly from one of the vehicles in the celebratory procession. One of the 'Occidental Guests', played by Björk, waits on another shore with her gaze directed out to sea. The other Occidental Guest, Matthew Barney, waits on a docking rig in a large fur coat. In a third location a group of young women at the water's edge, pearl divers, apply grease to each other's skin in preparation for the dive. Separately, the Occidental Guests are picked up by small motorised vessels and carried towards the \"Nisshin Maru\". The pearl divers enter the water with their collection barrels, hyperventilate to improve their lung capacity and make the first dive. Mayumi Miyata is shown playing the \"shō\" over the scene with a string of pearls entwined in her hair and hanging down her exposed back.\n\nThe pearl divers come across a long, floating mass of compacted organic material, a sculpture from Barney's repertoire titled and here representing ambergris, an extremely valuable organic material produced as waste by whales. Whilst they keenly examine it, the \"Nisshin Maru\" leaves dock in a festive cloud of coloured ribbons and excited, screaming children. In the ship's galley, the chef cleans his knives and utensils, boils shrimp and cuts blocks of grey, layered jelly into plated portions using a field emblem mould. The central strip of the top layer of each field emblem is incised in order to allow the ship's crew, to whom the jelly is served, to pull it away. The chef goes through the ship's mess, filling each central void with shrimp and pomegranate seeds.\n\nAs the small vessels ferrying the Occidental Guests pull up to the ship, an activity on deck is shown in which a man with two large stamps, in the style of a Japanese calligraphic seal, repetitively and rhythmically inks the instruments and imprints large rectangles of canvas. The Female Guest is led to descending stairs in the deck. She looks out over the prow of the vessel and finds her way down into the labyrinthine bowels of the ship. Occasionally she comes across small rocks on the corridor floor wrapped with red twine, which she appears to intuitively interpret as warning markers to prevent her from losing her way. Her path eventually takes her to a room with a large, metal, cubic bath where two Japanese women in blue serving garb, amah, attend to her. They pour a basket of lemons that have had a central strip excised into the water and remove the Guest's clothing before she steps into the bath. The Male Guest is lifted to the ship's deck in a large, winched basket and led to the same descending stairs. He searches for the correct door and arrives at the ship's barber, who carefully shaves off the entirety of Guest's substantial beard with a straight-razor. The petroleum jelly in the field-mould starts to solidify on deck. The Male Guest, shorn and dressed in denim, is guided by twine-wrapped rocks to a room separated by a large antique screen on which a traditional fishing scene is painted.\n\nIn the whaling bay the crew, bantering in Japanese, 'harpoon' a mock whale made from a black bin bag painted with the stylised features of a whale and stuffed with whole shrimp that burst out of the ruptured plastic after a direct hit from a crewman. A building component, reminiscent of a spine and covered with the debris of the shrimp, is victoriously hoisted aloft on a harpoon. In the screened room the Male Guest takes off his shoes and falls asleep. The barber, carrying his shaving kit and swigging from an open can of beer, slips in quietly and shaves a wide strip through the center of the Guest's hair.\n\nThe next morning, the harpoon vessel \"Yushin Maru\" sets out. It eventually snares the log of ambergris and the \"Nisshin Maru\" winches it up into the flensing bay through the back of the ship. Below deck, the Female Guest wanders through the corridors in a thin towel following her bath. She is encouraged to sit before a mirror in another preparation room by an amah, who carefully combs and arranges her hair into an ornate, traditional style using pieces of organic marine material arranged on combs, pins and boards. Another amah attends to the Male Guest, replacing his shorn eyebrows and hair with similar objects. Both Guests are stripped and redressed in ceremonial costume of skins and furs, with a base layer of damp fabric resembling thick kelp. The female Guest's eyebrows are shaved, her face painted with a thick layer of white foundation, and her lips painted over with the small, red pout of a Shinto bride. Both Guests also carry a large conch shell strapped to their backs, flensing knives with horn handles and a small bone instrument resembling a folded fan. Meanwhile, on deck, the field emblem sculpture has hardened in the mould and the crew use flensing tools and a winch to strip the central piece out of the mould.\n\nIn awkward bone sandals, both Guests make their way to the traditionally-appointed tea room. They wait together in silence in the ante-chamber, a niche in the corridor, whilst the workers examine the ambergris on deck and the Host prepares his organically-fashioned instruments for the tea ceremony. The sliding door to the tea room is pulled ajar and the two Guests look searchingly at each other to decide how to proceed. The Male Guest kneels at the door first, places his shoes outside the room and enters in the agonisingly slow ritual style of placing his fan one pace ahead to where he will shuffle forward, in his restrictive ceremonial garb, acknowledging the tokonoma alcove before he reaches his place in front of the host. The Female Guest enters and repeats the process. The Host enters and the Guests thank him for his invitation - the Male Guest in English and the Female Guest in Icelandic, the actors' native languages. The tea ceremony is enacted and the Host describes the history of the \"Nisshin Maru\" vessel as the crew carve the excised part of the field sculpture into solid blocks and render them in the ship's furnace. The plastic 'spine' from the excised part is lowered into the ship's hold.\n\nAs the sun goes down outside, the two Guests shift gradually closer to each other in the empty tea room. On deck the ambergris is anointed with sake and the remainder of the spirit is doled out to the crew. They toast the ambergris with their sake and night falls, bringing a heavy storm.\n\nIn the furnace room, the needle on a pressure gauge vibrates towards the end of the scale and the rivets on the machinery give. The ship begins to flood with molten grease. In the infirmary, a small Japanese boy with an extrusion of white fur from his mouth vomits grey liquid. The Female Guest falls as the ship pitches and the Male Guest leans over to help her up and remove her ceremonial hood. The two examine each other, finding strange holes on the back of each other's necks which they lovingly caress. They passionately kiss as the room begins to flood and the storm rages outside. With their flensing knives they alternate cutting deep strips from the flesh of the other's legs at a slow, ritualistic pace with minimal apparent sensation of pain, at one stage rolling such a strip into a rough imitation of sushi and eagerly consuming it. On deck, the ambergris log is inserted between the two halves of the field emblem sculpture into the void left by the excised strip. A troupe of small children wearing white robes carry in a box and set of plastic ritual equipment shaped as whaling tools. They also carry two wooden barrels, one containing shrimps and other a viscuous grey substance. Two of the children proceed to cement the shrimp around the base of the ambergris using the grey substance to bind it. The crew later return to winch the ambergris back out of the sculpture, leaving only the cemented shrimp base. At dawn the mould is then removed from the sculpture, which then collapses into a large pile of congealed petroleum jelly with the assistance of the long-handled flensing knives, and the ambergris is lowered back down into the hold to lie alongside the plastic 'spine' where it begins to disintegrate. The remainder of the field emblem sculpture is dismantled by knives and winches and the ambergris has attained the shape of the plastic spine it lies joined with.\n\nBack in the tea room, the Occidental Guests remove the last of each other's legs by slicing at the thigh. They wearily embrace, then dive beneath the water together. Their severed stumps become the waving tails of whales. A clown-like figure with matted hair and coloured face-paint, identified by Barney as the \"petrolatum spirit\", approaches the ambergris with a hose and raises a new flag on deck. The Occidental Guests complete their metamorphosis into whales.\n\nAt the coast, as the \"Nisshin Maru\" continues its journey at sea, a winch drags a wedge-shaped block up the sloping bay to the docks. A pearl diver surfaces with her mouth dripping with pearls. The docking slope collapses under the weight of the block and pearls spill into the ocean, landing on the ocean bed in the perfect form of two overlapping circles. The film ends on Mayumi Miyata playing the shō.\n\nThe Drawing Restraint 9 soundtrack was composed by Björk and was released on One Little Indian, July 25, 2005. It features the \"shō\" (Japanese mouth organ) playing of Mayumi Miyata, who appears playing her instrument near the start and conclusion of the film. Vocals for the opening scenes – featuring the English translation of the text of a letter from a Japanese citizen to General MacArthur thanking him for lifting the U.S. moratorium on whaling off the nation's coasts adapted by Barney and set to the harp (Zeena Parkins) and celeste (Jónas Sen) by Björk – were provided by Will Oldham.\n\n\n"}

Mustard seed is used as a spice. Grinding and mixing the seeds with water, vinegar, or other liquids creates the yellow condiment known as prepared mustard. The seeds can also be pressed to make mustard oil, and the edible leaves can be eaten as mustard greens.\n\nAlthough some varieties of mustard plants were well-established crops in Hellenistic and Roman times, Zohary and Hopf note, \"There are almost no archeological records available for any of these crops.\" Wild forms of mustard and its relatives, the radish and turnip, can be found over west Asia and Europe, suggesting their domestication took place somewhere in that area. However, Zohary and Hopf conclude: \"Suggestions as to the origins of these plants are necessarily based on linguistic considerations.\" Encyclopædia Britannica states that mustard was grown by the Indus Civilization of 2500–1700 BCE. According to the Saskatchewan Mustard Development Commission, \"Some of the earliest known documentation of mustard's use dates back to Sumerian and Sanskrit texts from 3000 BC\".\n\nMild white mustard (\"Sinapis alba\") grows wild in North Africa, the Middle East, and Mediterranean Europe, and has spread farther by long cultivation; oriental mustard (\"Brassica juncea\"), originally from the foothills of the Himalaya, is grown commercially in India, Canada, the United Kingdom, Denmark, and the US; black mustard (\"Brassica nigra\") is grown in Argentina, Chile, the US and some European countries. Canada and Nepal are the world's major producers of mustard seed, between them accounting for around 57% of world production in 2010. White mustard (\"Sinapis alba\") is commonly used as a cover crop in Europe (between UK and Ukraine). Many varieties exist, e.g. in Germany, Netherlands, mainly differing in lateness of flowering and resistance against white beet-cyst nematode (\"Heterodera schachtii\"). Farmers prefer late-flowering varieties, which do not produce seeds; they may become weeds in the subsequent year. Early vigor is important to cover the soil quickly and suppress weeds and protect the soil against erosion. In rotations with sugar beets, suppression of the white beet-cyst nematode is an important trait. Resistant white mustard varieties reduce nematode populations by 70–90%.\n\nRecent research has studied varieties of mustards with high oil contents for use in the production of biodiesel, a renewable liquid fuel similar to diesel fuel. The biodiesel made from mustard oil has good flow properties and cetane ratings. The leftover meal after pressing out the oil has also been found to be an effective pesticide.\n\nA genetic relationship between many species of mustard, along with turnips, cabbage, and their respective derivatives, has been observed and is described as the triangle of U.\n\n"}

The dynasty was founded when emperor Trần Thái Tông ascended to the throne after his uncle Trần Thủ Độ orchestrated the overthrow of the Lý dynasty. The final emperor of the dynasty was Thiếu Đế, who at the age of five years was forced to abdicate the throne in favor of his maternal grandfather, Hồ Quý Ly. The Trần dynasty defeated three Mongol invasions, most notably in the decisive Battle of Bạch Đằng River in 1288.\n\nThe Tran improved Chinese gunpowder enabling them to expand southward to defeat and vassalize the Champa. They also started using paper money for the first time in Vietnam.\n\nThe Tran dynasty was considered a golden age in Vietnamese language, arts, and culture; with the first pieces of Chữ Nôm literature written during this period, and first-time introduction of the vernacular Vietnamese language into the court, alongside Chinese. This laid the foundation for the further development and solidifying of Vietnamese language and identity.\n\nThe ancestors of the Trần clan originated from the province of Fujian before they migrated under Trần Kinh (陳京, Chén Jīng) to Đại Việt, where their mixed-blooded descendants established the Trần dynasty which ruled Đại Việt. They were mixed-blooded due to many intermarriages between the Trần and several royal members of the Lý dynasty alongside members of their royal court. This was the case of Trần Lý and Trần Thừa, the latter whose son Trần Thái Tông would later become the first emperor of the Trần dynasty. Their descendants established the Tran dynasty, which ruled Vietnam (Dai Viet). Some of the mixed-blooded descendants and certain members of the clan could still speak Chinese, as when a Yuan dynasty envoy met with the Chinese-speaking Tran Prince Trần Quốc Tuấn in 1282. The first of the Trần clan to live in Đại Việt was Trần Kinh, who settled in Tức Mặc village (now Mỹ Lộc, Nam Định) who lived by fishing. After three generations in Đại Việt, the Trần clan became a rich and powerful family under Trần Lý, who was Trần Kinh's grandson.\n\nDuring the troubled time under the reign of Lý Cao Tông, the Crown Prince Lý Sảm sought refuge in the family of Trần Lý and decided to marry his beautiful daughter Trần Thị Dung in 1209. Afterward, it was the Trần clan who helped Lý Cao Tông and Lý Sảm restore the throne in Thăng Long. As a result, the Emperor appointed several members of the Trần clan to high positions in the royal court, such as Tô Trung Từ, who was an uncle of Trần Thị Dung, and Trần Tự Khánh and Trần Thừa, who were Trần Lý's sons. In 1211 the Crown Prince Lý Sảm was enthroned as Lý Huệ Tông after the death of Lý Cao Tông. By that time the Trần clan's position began to rise in the royal court.\n\nHaving been mentally ill for a long time, the Emperor Lý Huệ Tông ultimately decided to cede the throne of the Lý dynasty to crown princess Lý Chiêu Hoàng in October of the lunar calendar, 1224. Ascending the throne at the age of only six, Lý Chiêu Hoàng ruled under the total influence of the commander of the royal guard, Trần Thủ Độ. Even the Empress Regnant's servants were chosen by Trần Thủ Độ; one of them was his 7-year-old nephew Trần Cảnh. When Trần Cảnh informed Trần Thủ Độ that the Empress Regnant seemed to have affection towards him, the leader of the Trần clan immediately decided to take this chance to carry out his plot to overthrow the Lý dynasty and establish a new dynasty ruled by his own clan. First Trần Thủ Độ moved the whole Trần clan to the royal palace and arranged a secret marriage between Lý Chiêu Hoàng and Trần Cảnh there, without the appearance of any mandarin or member of the Lý royal family. After that, he announced the \"fait accompli\" to the royal court and made Lý Chiêu Hoàng cede the throne to her new husband on the grounds that she was incapable of holding office. Thus Trần Cảnh was chosen as her successor. As a result, the 216-year reign of the Lý dynasty was ended, and the new Trần dynasty was created on the first day of the twelfth lunar month (Gregorian: December 31) 1225.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Lý Dynasty, Trần Thủ Độ was still afraid that the newly established Trần Dynasty might be overthrown by its political opponents. He therefore continued to eliminate members of the Lý royal family: first the former emperor Lý Huệ Tông in the tenth lunar month of 1226, then other members of the Lý royal family were massacred by the order of Trần Thủ Độ in the eighth lunar month of 1232.\n\nTrần Thái Tông was enthroned when he was only eight-years-old. There were several rebellions in Đại Việt at that time, so Trần Thủ Độ had to devote all of his efforts to consolidating the rule of Thái Tông in the royal court and over the country. Right after the coronation of the Emperor in 1226, Nguyễn Nộn and Đoàn Thượng rose in revolt in the mountainous region of Bắc Giang and Hải Dương. By both military and diplomatic measures, such as sending an army and by awarding two leaders of the revolt the title of Prince (Vương), Trần Thủ Độ was able to put down this revolt in 1229.\n\nAccording to \"Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư\", Thái Tông and his wife, the Empress Chiêu Thánh, did not have their first son for some time. This situation worried the grand chancellor Trần Thủ Độ because he had profited from similar circumstances with the Emperor Lý Huệ Tông in overthrowing the Lý dynasty. Therefore, in 1237 Trần Thủ Độ decided to force Prince Hoài Trần Liễu, Thái Tông's elder brother, to give up his wife, Princess Thuận Thiên, for the Emperor when she had been pregnant with Trần Quốc Khang for three months. After the royal marriage, Thuận Thiên was entitled the new empress of the Trần dynasty, while Chiêu Thánh was downgraded to princess. Furious at losing his pregnant wife, Trần Liễu rose in revolt against the royal family. Meanwhile, Thái Tông felt awkward about the situation and decided to become a monk at Yên Tử Mountain in Quảng Ninh. Finally Trần Thủ Độ successfully persuaded Thái Tông to return to the throne, and Trần Liễu had to surrender after judging that he could not stand with his fragile force. All soldiers who participated in this revolt were killed; Trần Thủ Độ even wanted to behead Trần Liễu but was stopped by Thái Tông.\n\nFujian was the origin of the Trần ancestors who migrated to Vietnam under Trần Kinh along with a large amount of other Chinese during the Ly dynasty where they served as officials. Distinctly Chinese last names are found in the Tran and Ly dynasty Imperial exam records. Ethnic Chinese are recorded in Tran and Ly dynasty records of officials. Clothing, food, and language were all Chinese-dominated in Van Don where the Tran had moved to after leaving their home province of Fujian. The Chinese language could still be spoken by the Tran in Vietnam. The oceanside area of Vietnam was colonized by Chinese migrants from Fujian which included the Tran among them located to the capital's southeastern area. The Red River Delta was subjected to migration from Fujian including the Tran and Van Don port arose as a result of this interaction. Guangdong and Fujian Chinese moved to the Halong located Van Don coastal port during Ly Anh Tong's rule in order to engage in commerce. The usurpation of the Ly occurred after they married with the Fujianese Tran family, many of whom were fishermen.\n\nIn 1257, the first Mongol invasion of Đại Việt was launched with the purpose of opening a southern front against the Song dynasty, whom they were fighting for more than two decades. The Mongols had already conquered parts of modern-day Sichuan and the Dali kingdom in modern-day Yunnan in order to besiege the Southern Song from the west. Trần Dụ Tông opposed the encroachment of a foreign army across his territory to attack their ally, and so dispatched soldiers on elephants to deter the Mongol troops. The elephant-mounted troops were routed from sharpshooters targeting the elephants. At the beginning of the war, the Đại Việt army suffered several defeats by an overwhelming force that had already conquered a vast area in Asia. Several high-ranking officials of the Trần dynasty were so fearful that Prince Trần Nhật Hiệu, the younger brother of Thái Tông, even suggested to the Emperor that they might escape from Đại Việt to the Song dynasty. Trần Dụ Tông submitted to the Mongols after the loss of a prince and the capital. In 1258, the Trần commenced regular diplomatic relations and a tributary relationship with the Mongol court, treating them as equals to the embattled Southern Song dynasty without renouncing their ties to the Song.\n\nKublai Khan was dissatisfied with the arrangement at the end of the first invasion and requested greater tributary payments, including taxes to the Mongols in both money and labor, \"incense, gold, silver, cinnabar, agarwood, sandalwood, ivory, tortoiseshell, pearls, rhinoceros horn, silk floss, and porcelain cups\", and direct oversight from a Mongol-appointed \"darughachi\". In 1283, Khubilai Khan sent word to the Trần that he intended to send Yuan armies through Trần territory to attack the kingdom of Champa, with demands for provisions and other support to the Yuan army. In the twelfth lunar month of 1284, the second Yuan invasion of Đại Việt was launched under the command of Kublai Khan's prince Toghon. Đại Việt was attacked from two directions, with Toghan himself conducting an infantry invasion from the northern border while the Yuan navy under general Sogetu advanced from the southern border through the territory of Champa. Initially, Trần Thánh Tông and Trần Nhân Tông had to order the army to retreat to avoid the pressure from the Yuan force when Prince Chiêu Minh Trần Quang Khải commanded his troops to try to stop Sogetu's fleet in the province of Nghệ An. Meanwhile, several high-ranking officials and members of the royal family of the Trần dynasty defected to the Yuan side, including Thánh Tông's own brother, Prince Chiêu Quốc (Trần Ích Tắc) and Trần Kiện, who was the son of Prince Tĩnh Quốc (Trần Quốc Khang). To ensure the safety of Thánh Tông and Nhân Tông during their retreat, Princess An Tư was offered as a present and diversion for prince Toghan, while Marquis Bảo Nghĩa (Trần Bình Trọng) was captured and later killed in the Battle of Đà Mạc defending the two emperors. The mass defections were the result of the significant effect that recent Mongol conquest of the Southern Song had on contemporary observers, with a Mongol conquest of Vietnam appearing inevitable to many.\n\nAt the southern border, Trần Quang Khải also had to retreat under the pressure of Sogetu's navy and the defection of the governor of Nghe An. This critical situation for the Trần dynasty began to change after the Toghan made the decision to retreat with the forward troops their victory in the fourth lunar month of 1285 at the Battle of Hàm Tử, where the troops commanded by Trần Nhật Duật, Prince Chiêu Thành, Trần Quốc Toản, and Nguyễn Khoái were finally able to defeat the fleet of general Sogetu. On the tenth day of the fifth lunar month of 1285, Trần Quang Khải fought the decisive battle in the Chương Dương, where the Yuan navy was almost destroyed and the balance in the battlefield tilted definitively in favor of the Trần dynasty. Ten days later Sogetu was killed and the Trần Emperor Nhân Tông and Emperor Emeritus Thánh Tông returned to the capital, Thăng Long, on the sixth day of the sixth lunar month, 1285.\n\nIn the third lunar month of 1287, the Yuan dynasty launched their third invasion of Đại Việt. This time, unlike the second invasion, commander-in-chief Prince Hưng Đạo (Trần Quốc Tuấn) assured the Emperor that Đại Việt's army could easily break the Yuan military campaign. After occupying and looting the capital, Toghan decided to retreat with the forward troops. This invasion was indeed ended one year later by a disastrous defeat of the Yuan navy at the Battle of Bạch Đằng on the eighth day of the third lunar month, 1288. Besides Trần Quốc Tuấn, other notable generals of the Trần dynasty during this time were Prince Nhân Huệ Trần Khánh Dư, who destroyed the logistics convoy of the Yuan navy at the Battle of Vân Đồn, and general Phạm Ngũ Lão, who took charge of ambushing prince Toghan's retreating troops. After the destruction of the Mongol navy, both the Đại Việt and Champa decided to accept the nominal supremacy of the Yuan dynasty and serve as tributary states in order to avoid further conflicts.\n\nProfessor Liam Kelley noted that people from Song dynasty China, like Zhao Zhong and Xu Zongdao fled to Tran dynasty, ruled Vietnam after the Mongol invasion of the Song and they helped the Tran fight against the Mongol invasion. Like the Tran dynasty, the Daoist cleric Xu Zongdao originated from Fujian. He recorded the Mongol invasion and referred to the Mongols as \"Northern bandits\".\n\nWu Bozong 吳伯宗 (b. 1334-d. 1384) was sent as ambassador to Annam. Wu wrote in the Rongjinji 榮進集 that when he asked the Tran monarch about Annam's affairs, the Tran ruler said that Annam proudly adhered to Tang dynasty and Han dynasty customs.\n欲問安南事，<br>安南風俗淳。<br>衣冠唐制度，<br>禮樂漢君臣。<br>玉甕開新酒，<br>金刀斫細鱗。<br>年年二三月，<br>桃李一般春。<br>\n\nAfter the three invasions, the people of Đại Việt were finally able to enjoy a long period of prosperity and peace during the reigns of Trần Anh Tông, Trần Minh Tông, and Trần Hiến Tông. Anh Tông was the first Trần emperor to reign without facing attacks from the Mongol Empire. Despite the deaths of the two most important generals of the early Trần dynasty, Trần Quang Khải in 1294 and Trần Quốc Tuấn in 1300, the Emperor was still served by many efficient mandarins like Trần Nhật Duật, Đoàn Nhữ Hài, Phạm Ngũ Lão, Trương Hán Siêu, Mạc Đĩnh Chi, and Nguyễn Trung Ngạn. Anh Tông was very strict in suppressing gambling and corruption, but he also generously rewarded those who served him well.\n\nIn 1306, the king of Champa, Chế Mân, offered Vietnam two Cham prefectures, Ô and Lý, in exchange for a marriage with the Vietnamese princess Huyền Trân. Anh Tông accepted this offer, then took and renamed Ô prefecture and Lý prefecture to Thuận prefecture and Hóa prefecture. These two prefectures soon began to be referred to collectively as the Thuận Hóa region. Only one year into the marriage, Chế Mân died and, in line with the royal tradition of Champa, Huyền Trân was to be cremated with her husband. Facing this urgent condition, Anh Tông sent his mandarin Trần Khắc Chung to Champa to save Huyền Trân from an imminent death. Finally Huyền Trân was able to return to Đại Việt, but Chế Chí, the successor of Chế Mân, no longer wished to abide by the peace treaty with Đại Việt. After that event, Anh Tông himself, along with the generals Trần Quốc Chân and Trần Khánh Dư, commanded three groups of Đại Việt military units to attack Champa in 1312. Chế Chí was defeated and captured in this invasion, and Anh Tông installed a hand-picked successor, but the relations between Đại Việt and Champa remained strained for a long time afterwards.\n\nAfter the death of the Retired Emperor Trần Minh Tông in 1357, the Trần dynasty began to fall into chaos during the reign of Trần Dụ Tông. While being modest and diligent under the regency of Minh Tông, the reign of Emperor Dụ Tông saw extravagant spending on the building of several luxurious palaces and other indulgences. Dụ Tông introduced theatre, which was considered at the time to be a shameful pleasure, into the royal court. The Emperor died on the 25th day of the fifth lunar month, 1369, at the age of 28, after appointing his brother's son Dương Nhật Lễ despite the fact that his appointee was not from the Trần clan.\n\nLike his predecessor Dụ Tông, Nhật Lễ neglected his administrative duties and concentrated only on drinking, theatre, and wandering. He even wanted to change his family name back to Dương. Such activities disappointed everyone in the royal court. This prompted the Prime Minister Trần Nguyên Trác and his son Trần Nguyên Tiết to plot the assassination of Nhật Lễ, but their conspiracy was discovered by the Emperor and they were killed afterwards. In the tenth lunar month of 1370, the Emperor's father-in-law, Trần Phủ, after receiving advice from several mandarins and members of the royal family, decided to raise an army for the purpose of overthrowing Nhật Lễ. After one month, his plan succeeded and Trần Phủ became the new emperor of Đại Việt, ruling as Trần Nghệ Tông, while Nhật Lễ was downgraded to Duke of Hôn Đức (Hôn Đức Công) and was killed afterwards by an order of Nghệ Tông.\n\nAfter the death of Hôn Đức Công, his mother fled to Champa and begged King Chế Bồng Nga to attack Đại Việt. Taking advantage of his neighbour's lack of political stability, Chế Bồng Nga commanded troops and directly assaulted Thăng Long, the capital of Đại Việt. The Trần army could not withstand this attack and the Trần royal court had to escape from Thăng Long, creating an opportunity for Chế Bồng Nga to violently loot the capital before withdrawing. In the twelfth lunar month of 1376 the Emperor Trần Duệ Tông decided to personally command a military campaign against Champa. Eventually, the campaign was ended by a disastrous defeat of Đại Việt's army at the Battle of Đồ Bàn, when the Emperor himself, along with many high-ranking madarins and generals of the Trần dynasty, were killed by the Cham forces. The successor of Duệ Tông, Trần Phế Đế, and the retired Emperor Nghệ Tông, were unable to drive back any invasion of Chế Bồng Nga in Đại Việt. As a result, Nghệ Tông even decided to hide money in Lạng Sơn, fearing that Chế Bồng Nga's troops might assault and destroy the royal palace in Thăng Long. In 1389 general Trần Khát Chân was appointed by Nghệ Tông to take charge of stopping Champa. In the first lunar month of 1390, Trần Khát Chân had a decisive victory over Champa which resulted in the death of Chế Bồng Nga and stabilised situation in the southern part of Đại Việt.\n\nDuring the reign of Trần Nghệ Tông, Hồ Quý Ly, an official who had two aunts entitled as consorts of Minh Tông, was appointed to one of the highest positions in the royal court. Despite his complicity in the death of the Emperor Duệ Tông, Hồ Quý Ly still had Nghệ Tông's confidence and came to hold more and more power in royal court. Facing the unstoppable rise of Hồ Quý Ly in the court, the Emperor Trần Phế Đế plotted with minister Trần Ngạc to reduce Hồ Quý Ly's power, but Hồ Quý Ly pre-empted this plot by a defamation campaign against the Emperor which ultimately made Nghệ Tông decide to replace him by Trần Thuận Tông and downgrade Phế Đế to Prince Linh Đức in December 1388. Trần Nghệ Tông died on the 15th day of the twelfth lunar month, 1394 at the age of 73 leaving the royal court in the total control of Hồ Quý Ly. He began to reform the administrative and examination systems of the Trần dynasty and eventually obliged Thuận Tông to change the capital from Thăng Long to Thanh Hóa in January 1397.\n\nOn the full moon of the third lunar month, 1398, under pressure from Hồ Quý Ly, Thuận Tông, had to cede the throne to his three-year-old son Trần An, now Trần Thiếu Đế, and held the title Retired Emperor at the age of only 20. Only one year after his resignation, Thuận Tông was killed on the orders of Hồ Quý Ly. Hồ Quý Ly also authorised the execution of over 370 persons who opposed his dominance in the royal court, including several prominent mandarins and the Emperor's relatives together with their families, such as Trần Khát Chân, Trần Hãng, Phạm Khả Vĩnh and Lương Nguyên Bưu. The end of the Trần dynasty came on the 28th day of the second lunar month (Gregorian: March 23) 1400, when Hồ Quý Ly decided to overthrow Thiếu Đế and established a new dynasty, the Hồ dynasty. Being Hồ Quý Ly's own grandson, Thiếu Đế was downgraded to Prince Bảo Ninh instead of being killed like his father. Hồ Quý Ly claimed descent from Duke Hu of Chen (Trần Hồ công, 陳胡公), whose Hồ clan originated in State of Chen (modern day Zhejiang, China) around the 940s.\n\nTo restore the country's economy, which had been heavily damaged during the turbulent time at the end of the Lý dynasty, Emperor Trần Thái Tông decided to reform the nation's system of taxation by introducing a new personal tax (\"thuế thân\"), which was levied on each person according to the area of cultivated land owned. For example, a farmer who owned one or two \"mẫu\", equal to , had to pay one \"quan\" per year, while another with up to four \"mẫus\" had to pay two \"quan\". Besides personal taxes, farmers were obliged to pay a land tax in measures of rice that was calculated by land classification. One historical book reveals that the Trần dynasty taxed everything from fish and fruits to betel. Taxpayers were divided into three categories: minors (\"tiểu hoàng nam\", from 18 to 20), adults (\"đại hoàng nam\", from 20 to 60), and seniors (\"lão hạng\", over 60). During the reign of Trần Thánh Tông members of the Trần clan and royal family were required by the Emperor to take full advantage of their land grants by hiring the poor to cultivate them. Đại Việt's cultivated land was annually ruined by river floods, so for a more stable agriculture, in 1244 Trần Thái Tông ordered his subordinates to construct a new system of levees along the Red River. Farmers who had to sacrifice their land for the diking were compensated with the value of the land. The Emperor also appointed a separate official to control the system.\n\nTowards the end of the Trần dynasty, Hồ Quý Ly held absolute power in the royal court, and he began to carry out his ideas for reforming the economy of Đại Việt. The most significant change during this time was the replacement of copper coins with paper money in 1396. It was the first time in the history of Vietnam that paper money was used in trading.\n\nTrần literature is considered superior to Lý literature in both quality and quantity. Initially, most members of the Trần clan were fishermen without any depth of knowledge. For example, Trần Thủ Độ, the founder of the Trần dynasty, was assessed in \"Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư\" as a man of superficial learning. However, after their usurpation of power from the Lý dynasty, Trần emperors and other princes and marquises always attached special importance to culture, especially literature.\n\nTwo important schools of literature during the reign of the Trần dynasty were patriotic and Buddhist literature. To commemorate the victory of Đại Việt against the second Mongol invasion the grand chancellor Trần Quang Khải composed a poem, named \"Tụng giá hoàn kinh\" (\"Return to the capital\"), which was considered one of the finest examples of Vietnamese patriotic literature during the dynastic era. Patriotism in Trần literature was also represented by the proclamation \"Hịch tướng sĩ\" (\"Call of Soldiers\"), written by general Trần Quốc Tuấn, which was the most popular work of the \"hịch\" (appeal, call) form in Vietnamese literature.\n\nBesides members of the Trần clan, there were several mandarins and scholars who were well known for patriotic works such as Trương Hán Siêu, an eminent author of the \"phú\" form, or general Phạm Ngũ Lão with his famous poem \"Thuật hoài\". As Buddhism was \"de facto\" the national religion of the Trần dynasty, there were many works of Trần literature that expressed the spirit of Buddhism and Zen, notably the works of the Emperor Trần Nhân Tông and other masters of Trúc Lâm School. Besides the literature created by the upper classes, folk narratives of myths, legends, and ghost stories were also collected in \"Việt Điện U Linh Tập\" by Lý Tế Xuyên and \"Lĩnh Nam chích quái\" by Trần Thế Pháp. These two collections held great value not only for folk culture but also for the early history of Vietnam.\n\nTrần literature had a special role in the history of Vietnamese literature for its introduction and development of the Vietnamese language (Quốc ngữ) written in chữ nôm. Before the Trần dynasty, Vietnamese was only used in oral history or proverbs. Under the rule of the Emperor Trần Nhân Tông, it was used for the first time as the second language in official scripts of the royal court, besides Chinese.\n\nIt was Hàn Thuyên, an official of Nhân Tông, who began to compose his literary works in the Vietnamese language, with the earliest recorded poem written in chữ Nôm in 1282. He was considered the pioneer who introduced chữ nôm in literature. After Hàn Thuyên, chữ Nôm was progressively used by Trần scholars in composing Vietnamese literature, such as Chu Văn An with the collection \"Quốc ngữ thi tập\" (\"Collection of national language poems\") or Hồ Quý Ly who wrote \"Quốc ngữ thi nghĩa\" to explain \"Shi Jing\" in the Vietnamese language. The achievement of Vietnamese language literature during the Trần era was the essential basis for the development of this language and the subsequent literature of Vietnam.\n\nThe Trần dynasty was considered a golden age for music and culture. Although it was still seen as a shameful pleasure at that time, theatre rapidly developed towards the end of the Trần dynasty with the role of Lý Nguyên Cát (Li Yuan Ki), a captured Chinese soldier who was granted a pardon for his talent in theatre. Lý Nguyên Cát imported many features of Chinese theatre (also see 话剧) in the performing arts of Đại Việt such as stories, costumes, roles, and acrobatics. For that reason, Lý Nguyên Cát was traditionally considered the founder of the art of \"hát tuồng\" in Vietnam. However this is nowadays a challenged hypothesis because \"hát tuồng\" and Beijing opera differed in the way of using painted faces, costumes, or theatrical conventions. The art of theatre was introduced to the royal court by Trần Dụ Tông and eventually the emperor even decided to cede the throne to Dương Nhật Lễ who was born to a couple of \"hát tuồng\" performers.\n\nTo celebrate the victory over the 1288 Mongol invasion, Trần Quang Khải and Trần Nhật Duật created the \"Múa bài bông\" (\"dance of flowers\") for a major three-day festival in Thăng Long. This dance has been handed down to the present and is still performed at local festivals in the northern region.\n\nAlthough Buddhism was considered the national religion of the Trần dynasty, Confucianist education began to spread across the country. The principal curricula during this time were the Four Books and Five Classics, and Northern history, which were at the beginning taught only at Buddhist pagodas and gradually brought to pupils in private classes organized by retired officials or Confucian scholars. The most famous teacher of the Trần dynasty was probably Chu Văn An, an official in the royal court from the reign of Trần Minh Tông to the reign of Trần Dụ Tông, who also served as royal professor of Crown Prince Trần Vượng. During the reign of Trần Thánh Tông, the emperor also permitted his brother Trần Ích Tắc, a prince who was well known for his intelligence and knowledge, to open his own school at the prince's palace. Several prominent mandarins of the future royal court such as Mạc Đĩnh Chi and Bùi Phóng were trained at this school. The official school of the Trần dynasty, Quốc học viện, was established in June 1253 to teach the Four Books and Five Classics to royal students (\"thái học sinh\"). The military school, Giảng võ đường, which focused on teaching about war and military manoeuvre, was opened in August of the same year. Together with this military school, the first Temple of Military Men (Võ miếu) was built in Thăng Long to worship Jiang Ziya and other famous generals.\n\nSeven years after the establishment of the Trần dynasty, the Emperor Trần Thái Tông ordered the first imperial examination, in the second lunar month of 1232, for royal students with the purpose of choosing the best scholars in Đại Việt for numerous high-ranking positions in the royal court. Two of the top candidates in this examination were Trương Hanh and Lưu Diễm. After another imperial examination in 1239, the Trần emperor began to establish the system of seven-year periodic examinations in order to select royal students from all over the country. The most prestigious title of this examination was \"tam khôi\" (\"three first laureates\"), which was composed of three candidates who ranked first, second, and third in the examination with the names respectively of \"trạng nguyên\" (狀 元, \"exemplar of the state\"), \"bảng nhãn\" (榜 眼, \"eyes positioned alongside\") and \"thám hoa\" (探 花, \"selective talent\"). The first \"tam khôi\" of the Trần dynasty were \"trạng nguyên\" Nguyễn Hiền, who was only 12 at that time, \"bảng nhãn\" Lê Văn Hưu who later became a royal historian of the Trần dynasty, and \"thám hoa\" Đặng Ma La. In the 1256 examination, the Trần dynasty divided the title \"trạng nguyên\" into two categories, \"kinh trạng nguyên\" for candidates from northern provinces and \"trại trạng nguyên\" for those from two southern provinces: Thanh Hóa and Nghệ An, so that students from those remote regions could have the motivation for the imperial examination. This separation was abolished in 1275 when the ruler decided that it was no longer necessary.\n\nIn 1304, the Emperor Trần Anh Tông decided to standardize the examination by four different rounds in which candidates were eliminated step by step through tests of classical texts, Confucianist classics, royal document redaction, and finally argument and planning. This examining process was abandoned in 1396 by the Emperor Trần Thuận Tông under pressure from Hồ Quý Ly, who replaced the traditional examination with the new version as a part of his radical reforms of the social and administrative system. Hồ Quý Ly regulated the imperial examination by a prefectural examination (thi hương) and a metropolitan examination (\"thi hội\") following in the next year. The second-degree examination included four rounds: literary dissertation, literary composition, royal document redaction, and eventually an essay which was evaluated by the Emperor in person. For the lower-ranking officials, the emperor had another examination which tested writing and calculating, such as the examination in the sixth lunar month of 1261 during the reign of Trần Thánh Tông.\n\nDuring its 175 years of existence, the Trần dynasty carried out fourteen imperial examinations including ten official and four auxiliary contests. Many laureates from these examinations later became prominent officials in the royal court or well-known scholars such as Lê Văn Hưu, author of the historical accounts \"Đại Việt sử ký\", Mạc Đĩnh Chi, renowned envoy of the Trần dynasty to the Yuan dynasty, or Nguyễn Trung Ngạn, one of the most powerful officials during the reign of Trần Minh Tông. Below is the complete list of examinations with the candidates who ranked first in each examination:\n\nThere is evidence for the use of feng shui by Trần dynasty officials, such as in 1248 when Trần Thủ Độ ordered several feng shui masters to block many spots over the country for the purpose of protecting the newly founded Trần dynasty from its opponents. Achievements in science during the Trần dynasty were not detailed in historical accounts, though a notable scientist named Đặng Lộ was mentioned several times in \"Đại Việt sử kí toàn thư\". It was said that Đặng Lộ was appointed by Retired Emperor Minh Tông to the position of national inspector (\"liêm phóng sứ\") but he was noted for his invention called \"lung linh nghi\" which was a type of armillary sphere for astronomic measurement. From the result in observation, Đặng Lộ successfully persuaded the emperor to modify the calendar in 1339 for a better fit with the agricultural seasons in Đại Việt. Marquis Trần Nguyên Đán, a superior of Đặng Lộ in the royal court, was also an expert in calendar calculation.\n\nNear the end of the Trần dynasty the technology of gunpowder appeared in the historical records of Đại Việt. It was responsible for the death of the King of Champa, Chế Bồng Nga, after general Trần Khát Chân fired a cannon from his battleship in January 1390. According to the NUS researcher Sun Laichen, the Trần dynasty acquired gunpowder technology from China and effectively used it to change the balance of power between Đại Việt and Champa in favour of Đại Việt. As a result of this Sun reasoned that the need for copper for manufacturing firearms was probably another reason for the order of Hồ Quý Ly to change from copper coins to paper money in 1396. The people of the Trần dynasty and later Hồ dynasty continued to improve their firearms using gunpowder. This resulted in weapons of superior quality to their Chinese counterparts. These were acquired by the Ming dynasty in their invasion of Đại Việt.\n\nDuring the rule of the Trần dynasty, medicine had a better chance to develop because of a more significant role of Confucianism in society. In 1261, the emperor issued an order to establish the Institute of Royal Physicians (Thái y viện) which managed medicine in Đại Việt, carrying out the examination for new physicians and treating people during disease epidemics. In 1265 the institute distributed a pill named \"Hồng ngọc sương\" to the poor, which they considered able to cure many diseases. Besides the traditional Northern herbs (\"thuốc Bắc\"), Trần physicians also began to cultivate and gather various regional medicinal herbs (\"thuốc Nam\") for treating both civilians and soldiers. During the reign of Trần Minh Tông the head of the Institute of Royal Physicians Phạm Công Bân was widely known for his medical ethics, treating patients regardless of their descent with his own medicine made from regional herbs; it was said that Phạm Công Bân gathered his remedies in a medical book named \"Thái y dịch bệnh\" (\"Diseases by the Royal Physician\").\n\nAnother Trần person and fellow countryman of Phạm Công Bân was the monk Tuệ Tĩnh, one of the most famous physicians in Vietnamese history, who was called \"Father of the Southern Medicine\" for creating the basis of Vietnamese traditional medicine with his works \"Hồng nghĩa giác tư y thư\" and \"Nam dược thần hiệu\". \"Nam dược thần hiệu\" was a collection of 499 manuscripts about local herbs and ten branches of treatment with 3932 prescriptions to cure 184 type of diseases while \"Hồng nghĩa giác tư y thư\" provided people with many simple, easy-to-prepare medicines with high effect.\n\n\n\n"}

This would involve extending the Heletz railway to Tarqumiyah (thus providing a rail link from Erez Crossing to the West Bank) and building a spur for the future Eastern Railway to Tulkarm, as well as rebuilding the old railway branch from a renewed Jezreel Valley Railway to Jenin. These links might be extended later through to Egypt and Jordan.\n\n, a plan for a 475-kilometer rail network, establishing 11 new rail lines in West Bank, was confirmed by Israeli Transportation Ministry. The West Bank network would include one line running through Jenin, Nablus, Ramallah, Jerusalem, Ma'aleh Adumim, Bethlehem and Hebron. Another would provide service along the Jordanian border from Eilat to the Dead Sea, Jericho and Beit She'an and from there toward Haifa in the west and in also in a northeasterly direction. The proposed scheme also calls for shorter routes, such as between Nablus and Tulkarm in the West Bank, and from Ramallah to the Allenby Bridge crossing into Jordan.\n\nThe Gaza Strip had a standard-gauge railway running 34 kilometers along its length from north to south, which was built in 1916. Prior to 1948 and from about 1972 until an unknown date the line connected to what then became the Israeli system to the north. It also connected to the Egyptian railway system to the south from 1916 to 1967. The line has now been dismantled.\n\nIn the West Bank, a narrow-gauge railway operated until the 1940s from Jenin to Tulkarm and Nablus, which was built during Ottoman rule, and connected to the Hejaz Railway on a gauge.\n\nSeveral defunct railways in the Palestinian territories were previously used to link with adjacent countries:\n\n\nIn 2010, the West Bank and Gaza Strip together had of roadways.\n\nSalah al-Din Road, also known as the Salah ad-Deen Highway, is the main highway of the Gaza Strip. It is 45 kilometers long, and runs the entire length of the Gaza Strip from the Erez Crossing to Israel in the north to the Rafah Crossing to Egypt in the south.\n\nThe West Bank is landlocked and has no ports. \n\nThe Port of Gaza is a small port near the Rimal district of Gaza City. It is the home port of Palestinian fishing-boats and the base of the Palestinian Naval Police, a branch of the Palestinian National Security Forces. Under the Oslo II Accord, the activities of the Palestinian Naval Police are restricted to 6 nautical miles from the coast. The Port of Gaza has been under naval blockade since 2007, and activities at the port have been restricted to small-scale fishing. \n\nConstruction of the Gaza Seaport had begun in the Gaza Strip, but the building was destroyed and the project abandoned after the outbreak of the Second Intifada in September 2000. There are no ships in the Gaza Strip over 1,000 gross tons.\n\nThere are three airports in the Palestinian territories, all of which are presently closed. The Yasser Arafat International Airport (previously called Gaza International Airport), located in the Gaza Strip, was opened on 24 November 1998 as part of the Oslo II Accord and the 23 October 1998 Wye River Memorandum. The airport was closed in October 2000 by Israeli order, after the breakout of the Second Intifada. Its runway was destroyed by the Israel Defense Forces in December 2001. Atarot Airport was also closed in 2000. Gush Katif Airport, also in the Gaza Strip, was closed in 2004.\n\nWest Bank Palestinians traveling abroad can use the Allenby Bridge to enter Jordan and then use the Queen Alia International Airport in Amman to fly abroad.\n\nThe Allenby Bridge, also known as the Al-Karameh Bridge and the King Hussein Bridge, is a bridge that crosses the Jordan River near the city of Jericho, and connects the West Bank with Jordan. The bridge is currently the sole designated exit/entry point for West Bank Palestinians traveling abroad. Since the 1994 Israel–Jordan peace treaty, the Allenby Bridge Terminal has been operated by the Israel Airports Authority.\n\nThe Erez Crossing, Karni Crossing and the Kerem Shalom Crossing are three border crossings on the Israel-Gaza Strip barrier between the Gaza Strip and Israel, and have been affected by the Israeli Blockade of the Gaza Strip.

Wirtschaftschule students are normally between 13 and 16 years of age and study a variety of traditional academic subjects, and receive training specifically geared towards a future career in business.\n\nPupils in the Wirtschaftsschule stay there for between two and four years. The Wirtschaftsschule is unique to the Bavarian educational system, and students become out of sync with the traditional system of education as a consequence of enrolling in this type of school. Students in the 'Gymnasium' and 'Realschule' track often are able to transfer to the Wirtschaftschule program.\n\nAdmission is granted when the student has successfully gained the necessary qualifications from the 'Hauptschule', or after an assessment of their suitability to enter. This generally takes the form of a three-day assessment specializing in German and Mathematics.\n\nThe Wirtschaftsschule programs end after the tenth year of schooling or for students of the two years program after the eleventh year. Thus, the four-year program begins after the sixth year, the three-year program after the seventh year, and the two-year program after the eighth year.\n\nSuccessful graduates of the school have the length of their training shortened by a year in many occupations.\n\nUpon successful completion of the curriculum, students receive a \"Mittlerer Schulabschluss\", which is comparable to the British GCSE.\n\nAt the eight academic year, students generally have a choice between focusing on business-related and on technical and mathematical subjects for the duration of their study.\n\nStudents can choose between the H pathway (100% economic focus) and the M pathway (mathematical and technical focus).\n\nAcademic courses in the H pathway are\n\n1.

Bartley III\n\nWilliam Warren Bartley III (October 2, 1934 – February 5, 1990), known as W. W. Bartley III, was an American philosopher specializing in 20th century philosophy, language and logic, and the Vienna Circle.\n\nBorn in Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania, on October 2, 1934, Bartley was brought up in a Protestant home. He completed his secondary education in Pittsburgh and studied at Harvard University between 1952 and 1956, graduating with a BA degree in philosophy. While an undergraduate at Harvard, he was an editor at \"The Harvard Crimson\" newspaper. He spent the winter semester of 1956 and the summer semester of 1957 at the Harvard Divinity School and the Episcopal Theological School in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In 1958, he completed his MA degree in philosophy at Harvard. Bartley was training to become a Protestant minister, but rejected Christianity at that point. He went on to study under Sir Karl Popper at the London School of Economics, where he completed his PhD in 1962. Parts of his dissertation, \"Limits of Rationality: A Critical Study of Some Logical Problems of Contemporary Pragmatism and Related Movements\", were subsequently published as \"The Retreat to Commitment\" in the same year.\n\nAfter his doctoral graduation, Bartley worked as a lecturer in logic in London. Later, he held positions at the Warburg Institute and the University of California, San Diego. He was appointed to his first full professorship in 1969, at the University of Pittsburgh, where he had been teaching since 1963.\n\nIn 1973, he joined the California State University, Hayward faculty as a professor of philosophy, where he received the distinction of \"Outstanding Professor\" of the entire California State University System in 1979. His last position was that of a senior research fellow at the Hoover Institution.\n\nBartley and Popper had a great admiration for each other, partly because of their common stand against justificationism. However, at the International Colloquium in the Philosophy of Science at Bedford College, University of London, July 11–17, 1965, they came into conflict with each other. Bartley had presented a paper, \"Theories of Demarcation Between Science and Metaphysics,\" in which he accused Popper of displaying a positivist attitude in his early works and proposed that Popper's demarcation criterion was not as important as Popper thought it was. Popper took this as a personal attack, and Bartley took his reply as indicating that Popper was ignoring his criticism. Their friendship was not restored until 1974, after the publication of \"The Philosophy of Karl Popper\" (edited by Paul Schillpp). Bartley changed the tone of his remarks about Popper's criterion of demarcation, making it less aggressive. However, despite the restored friendship, Bartley's view was never accepted by Popper, who criticised it even after Bartley's death.\n\nBartley published a biography of the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, titled simply \"Wittgenstein\", in 1973. The book contained a relatively brief, 4–5 page treatment of Wittgenstein's homosexuality, relying mainly on reportage from the philosopher's friends and acquaintances. This matter caused enormous controversy in intellectual and philosophical circles; many perceived it as a posthumous \"attack\" on Wittgenstein. Some foreign translations of the book, such as the first edition of the Spanish translation, omitted the \"offending\" material. In the second edition of the biography (La Salle, Illinois: Open Court, 1985, pp. 159–97), Bartley answered the objections of critics, pointing out that Wittgenstein's periods of active homosexuality are verified by the philosopher's own private writings, including his coded diaries, and that extensive confirmation was also available from people who knew Wittgenstein in Vienna between the two World Wars, including ex-lovers. Bartley also considered, and rejected, the idea of a connection between the private life and the philosophy.\n\nBartley also wrote a biography of Werner Erhard, the founder of est. Bartley was graduate of Erhard Seminars Training and served on the advisory board of Est, an educational company.\n\nBartley edited Lewis Carroll's book \"Symbolic Logic\" (see symbolic logic), including the second volume, which Carroll had never published.\n\nBartley extended Popperian epistemology in his book \"The Retreat to Commitment\", in which he describes pancritical rationalism (PCR), a development of critical rationalism and panrationalism. PCR attempts to work around the problem of ultimate commitment or infinite regress by decoupling criticism and justification. A pancritical rationalist holds all positions open to criticism, including PCR, and never resorts to authority for justification.\n\nParts of Popper's \"Realism and the Aim of Science\", a book that Bartley edited, and the Addendum to the fourth edition of \"The Open Society and Its Enemies\" contain passages that are commonly interpreted as Popper's acceptance of Bartley's views. Mariano Artigas held that these were in fact written by Bartley himself.\n\nAlan Ebenstein, a biographer of F. A. Hayek, criticized Bartley for the extent of the changes he made as the editor of \"The Fatal Conceit\", a book attributed to Hayek. Bruce Caldwell suggests that the book in its published form may actually have been written by Bartley.\n\nBartley died of bladder cancer on February 5, 1990 at his home in Oakland, California, after having been diagnosed with the disease in the middle of the preceding year.\n\nAt the time of his death, Bartley had just finished his last book, \"Unfathomed Knowledge, Unmeasured Wealth: On Universities and the Wealth of Nations\". Other works he was preparing at that time included writing a biography, and editing the collected works, of Friedrich Hayek. The latter was being completed after Bartley's death by his colleague and executor Stephen Kresge. Also unfinished was a biography of Popper. Both biographies were in an advanced stage at the time of Bartley's death.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2028438", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2028438", "title": "Abdelbaset al-Megrahi", "text": "Abdelbaset al-Megrahi\n\nAbdelbaset Ali Mohmed al-Megrahi ( , ; 1 April 1952 – 20 May 2012) was a Libyan who was head of security for Libyan Arab Airlines, director of the Centre for Strategic Studies in Tripoli, Libya, and an alleged Libyan intelligence officer. On 31 January 2001, Megrahi was convicted, by a panel of three Scottish judges sitting in a special court at Camp Zeist in the Netherlands, of 270 counts of murder for the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, on 21 December 1988 and was sentenced to life imprisonment. His co-accused, Lamin Khalifah Fhimah, was found not guilty and was acquitted.\n\nMegrahi unsuccessfully appealed his conviction in January 2001. In June 2007, the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission granted Megrahi leave to appeal against his Lockerbie bombing conviction for a second time. After initially appealing, Megrahi abandoned his second appeal in August 2009 as an ongoing appeal would have prevented him from being moved to Libya under the Prisoner Transfer Scheme which was thought to be a possibility. He decided to drop his appeal two days before he was released on compassionate grounds by the Scottish Government on 20 August 2009. Doctors reported on 10 August 2009 that he had terminal prostate cancer. On his return to Libya, al-Megrahi was initially hospitalized then allowed to leave on 2 November 2009, taking up residence in a villa in Tripoli. He died on 20 May 2012, two years and 9 months after his release.\n\nSeveral legal experts as well as the UN observer at the Lockerbie trial have vehemently challenged the verdict that convicted Megrahi, while Ulrich Lumpert, the Mebo AG engineer who testified to the validity of a key piece of evidence, admitted in an affidavit to lying in court and stealing the object from his employer, after which he gave it to one of the crime investigators.\n\nA Magarha, Abdelbaset al-Megrahi was born in Tripoli on 1 April 1952 to a poor family. Although little is known of his early life, in 1971, he spent nine months studying in Cardiff, Wales and in the late 1970s, he made multiple visits to the United States and the United Kingdom. Later, he was the head of security for Libyan Arab Airlines (LAA), and director of the Centre for Strategic Studies in Tripoli. It was alleged by the FBI and the prosecution in the Lockerbie case that he was also an officer of the Libyan intelligence service, Jamahiriya el-Mukhabarat.\n\nIn November 1991, Megrahi and Fhimah were indicted by the US Attorney General and the Scottish Lord Advocate for the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103. Libya refused to extradite the two accused, but held them under armed house arrest in Tripoli, offering to detain them for trial in Libya, as long as all the incriminating evidence was provided. The offer was unacceptable to the US and UK, and there was an impasse for the next three years.\n\nOn 23 March 1995, over six years after the 1988 attack, Megrahi and Fhimah were designated as United States fugitives from justice and became the 441st and 442nd additions on the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list. This list offered a US$4 million reward from the US Air Line Pilots Association, Air Transport Association, and United States Department of State, and $50,000 from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), for information leading to their arrest.\n\nThe parties eventually agreed on a compromise and a trial was held in the Netherlands under Scots law. The trial format was engineered by legal academic Professor Robert Black of the University of Edinburgh and was given political impetus by the British foreign secretary, Robin Cook.\n\nProtracted negotiations with the Libyan leader, Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, and the imposition of UN economic sanctions against Libya brought the two accused to trial in a neutral country. Over ten years after the bombing, Megrahi and Fhimah were placed under arrest at Camp Zeist in the Netherlands on 5 April 1999. During his seven-year house arrest awaiting deportation and trial, Megrahi lived on a Libyan Arab Airlines pension and worked as a teacher.\n\nThe Scottish High Court of Justiciary at Camp Zeist was presided over by three senior judges and an additional, non-voting, judge. The two accused, Megrahi and Lamin Khalifah Fhimah, denied all charges against them. The full charges included the names of the murdered 259 passengers and crew of Pan Am Flight 103, and the eleven residents killed on the ground at Lockerbie in Scotland.\n\nRepresenting Megrahi were his solicitor, Alistair Duff, and advocates William Taylor QC, David Burns QC and John Beckett. Fhimah was represented by solicitor Eddie McKechnie and advocates Richard Keen QC, Jack Davidson QC and Murdo Macleod. Both defendants also had access to a Libyan defence lawyer, Kamel Maghur, a former foreign affairs minister in the Libyan government.\n\nCourt proceedings started on 3 May 2000. The crucial witness against Megrahi for the prosecution was Tony Gauci, a Maltese storekeeper, who testified that he had sold Megrahi the clothing later found in the remains of the suitcase bomb. At the trial, Gauci appeared uncertain about the exact date he sold the clothes in question, and was not entirely sure that it was Megrahi to whom they were sold. Nonetheless, Megrahi's appeal against conviction was rejected by the Scottish Court in the Netherlands in March 2002. Five years after the trial, former Lord Advocate, Lord Fraser of Carmyllie, publicly described Gauci as being \"an apple short of a picnic\" and \"not quite the full shilling\".\n\nDuring the trial, the defence showed that Megrahi's co-defendant, Fhimah, had a watertight alibi, having been in Sweden at the time of the sabotage.\n\nThe judges announced their verdict on 31 January 2001. They said of Megrahi: \"There is nothing in the evidence which leaves us with any reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the first accused, and accordingly we find him guilty of the remaining charge in the indictment as amended.\" Megrahi was sentenced to life imprisonment, with a recommendation that he should serve at least 20 years before being eligible for parole.\n\nThe judges unanimously found the second accused, Lamin Khalifah Fhimah, not guilty of the murder charge. Fhimah was freed and returned to his home at Souk al-Juma in Libya on 1 February 2001.\n\nMegrahi was sent to Barlinnie Prison. In February 2005, he was transferred to HM Prison Greenock.\n\nMegrahi's appeal against his conviction in January 2001 was refused on 14 March 2002 by a panel of five Scottish judges at Camp Zeist in the Netherlands. According to a report by the BBC, Dr Hans Köchler, one of the UN observers at the trial, expressed serious doubts about the fairness of the proceedings and spoke of a \"spectacular miscarriage of justice\".\n\nOn 24 November 2003, Megrahi appeared at the High Court in Glasgow, in front of the three judges who originally sentenced him at Camp Zeist, to learn that he would have to serve at least 27 years in jail – back-dated to April 1999 when he was extradited from Libya – before he could be considered for parole. This court hearing was the result of the incorporation into Scots law of the European Convention on Human Rights in 2001, nine months after Megrahi's sentence was imposed, which required him to be told the extent of the \"punishment part\" of his life term. On 31 May 2004, he was granted leave to appeal against his 27-year sentence. The appeal against sentence was scheduled to be heard in Edinburgh by a panel of five Judges on 11 July 2006. However, the Scottish Court of Criminal Appeal decided to postpone the July hearing to allow consideration of whether the appeal against sentence ought to be heard at Camp Zeist rather than in Edinburgh.\n\nOn 23 September 2003, lawyers acting for Megrahi applied to the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission (SCCRC) for a review of the case (both sentence and conviction), arguing that there had been a miscarriage of justice. On 1 November 2006, Megrahi was reported to have dropped his demand for the new appeal to be held at Camp Zeist. In an interview with \"The Scotsman\" newspaper of 31 January 2006, retired Scottish Judge Lord MacLean – one of the three who convicted Megrahi in 2001 – said he believed the SCCRC would return the case for a further appeal against conviction:\n\nThey can't be working for two years without producing something with which to go to the court.\n\nMacLean added that any new appeal would indicate the flexibility of Scots law, rather than a weakness:\n\nIt might even be the strength of the system – it is capable of looking at itself subsequently and determining a ground for appeal.\n\nIn January 2007, the SCCRC announced that it would issue its decision on Megrahi's case by the end of June 2007. On 9 June 2007, rumours of a possible prisoner swap deal involving Megrahi were strenuously denied by the then-prime minister, Tony Blair. Later in June, \"The Observer\" confirmed the imminence of the SCCRC ruling and reported:\n\nAbdelbaset al-Megrahi never wavered in his denial of causing the Lockerbie disaster: now some Scottish legal experts say they believe him.\n\nOn 28 June 2007, the SCCRC concluded its four-year review and, having uncovered evidence that a miscarriage of justice could have occurred, the commission granted Megrahi leave to appeal against his Lockerbie bombing conviction for a second time. The second appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal was abandoned in August 2009, as an impediment to the legal power to release him to Libya under the Prisoner Transfer Scheme then operating in the United Kingdom. Ultimately, he was not released under this scheme, rather, on compassionate grounds due to his ill health. There was in the event, no requirement to drop his appeal against conviction.\n\nNew information casting fresh doubts about Megrahi's conviction was examined at a procedural hearing at the Judicial Appeal Court (Court of Session building) in Edinburgh on 11 October 2007:\n\nOn 1 November 2007, Megrahi invited Professor Robert Black QC to visit him at Greenock Prison. After a two-hour meeting, Black stated \"that not only was there a wrongful conviction, but the victim of it was an innocent man. Lawyers, and I hope others, will appreciate this distinction.\"\n\nPrior to Megrahi's second appeal, another four procedural hearings took place at the High Court of Appeal in Edinburgh between December 2007 and June 2008.\n\nIn the June 2008 edition of the Scottish lawyers' magazine \"The Firm\", the UN Observer at the Lockerbie trial, Professor Hans Köchler, referred to the 'totalitarian' nature of Megrahi's second appeal process saying it \"bears the hallmarks of an 'intelligence operation'.\" Pointing out an error on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's website (FCO) and accusing the British government of \"delaying tactics\" in relation to Megrahi's second Lockerbie appeal, UN Observer at the Lockerbie trial Dr Hans Köchler wrote to Foreign Secretary David Miliband on 21 July 2008 saying:\n\nAs international observer, appointed by the UN, at the Scottish Court in the Netherlands I am also concerned about the Public Interest Immunity (PII) certificate which has been issued by you in connection with the new Appeal of the convicted Libyan national. Withholding of evidence from the Defence was one of the reasons why the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission has referred Mr. Al-Megrahi's case back to the High Court of Justiciary. The Appeal cannot go ahead if the Government of the United Kingdom, through the PII certificate issued by you, denies the Defence the right (also guaranteed under the European Convention on Human Rights) to have access to a document which is in the possession of the Prosecution. How can there be equality of arms in such a situation? How can the independence of the judiciary be upheld if the executive power interferes into the appeal process in such a way?\n\nThe FCO corrected the error on its website and wrote to Köchler on 27 August 2008:\n\nUltimately, it will be for the Court to decide whether the material should be disclosed, not the Foreign Secretary.\n\nOn 15 October 2008, five Scottish judges decided unanimously to reject a submission by the Crown Office to the effect that the scope of Megrahi's second appeal should be limited to the specific grounds of appeal that were identified by the SCCRC in June 2007.\n\nIn January 2009, it was reported that, although Megrahi's second appeal against conviction was scheduled to begin on 27 April 2009, the hearing could last as long as 12 months because of the complexity of the case and volume of material to be examined. At a preliminary High Court hearing in Edinburgh on 20 February 2009, Megrahi's Counsel, Maggie Scott QC, was informed that a delegation from the Crown Office was due to travel to Malta to \"actively seek the consent for disclosure\" of sensitive documents that could determine the outcome of the second appeal.\n\nScottish ministers denied in April 2009 they had clandestinely agreed to the repatriation of Megrahi before the start of his second appeal on 28 April.\n\nKenny MacAskill announced in May 2011 that the re-elected SNP Government would seek to change Scots law to allow publication of the SCCRC report, which can presently be blocked by any party that provided evidence to the review. Nevertheless, \"The Herald\" published this report online in March 2012.\n\nThe first Scottish call for the release of Megrahi was made by Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland Iain Torrance. At the beginning of 2003, Nelson Mandela had asked for the intervention of the Western Christian churches in what he described as \"a clear miscarriage of justice\". This led to the production of a highly critical report of the scientific and forensic evidence presented at the original trial by the Church of Scotland's leading scientist Dr John Urquhart Cameron. As a result, in July 2003, Torrance petitioned the then prime minister Tony Blair to consider his release in view of the widespread unease in Scotland concerning the safety of the verdict.\n\nOn 14 September 2008, the Arab League Ministerial Council passed a resolution calling for the 'political hostage' Megrahi to be released from prison in Scotland. The resolution demanded that the Scottish government should hand to Megrahi's lawyers the documents which the SCCRC had identified, adding that Britain's refusal to do so represented a 'miscarriage of justice'. The Arab League also endorsed Libya's right to compensation for the damage done to its economy by UN sanctions which were in force from 1991 until 1999.\n\nOn 6 November 2008, three Criminal Appeal Court judges reserved judgment on an application by defence counsel Maggie Scott for Megrahi to be released on bail pending his second appeal against conviction which was expected to be heard in 2009. A week later, Megrahi's bail application was refused.\n\nOn the Lockerbie bombing's 20th anniversary, \"The Independent\" published an opinion piece by journalist Hugh Miles, repeating questions around Megrahi's guilt, writing in part,\n\nSince the Crown never had much of a case against Megrahi, it was no surprise when the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission (SCCRC) found prima facie evidence in June 2007 that Megrahi had suffered a miscarriage of justice and recommended that he be granted a second appeal.\n\nIf Megrahi didn't do it, who did? Some time ago suspicion fell on a gang headed by a convicted Palestinian terrorist named Abu Talb and a Jordanian triple agent named Marwan Abdel Razzaq Khreesat. Both were Iranian agents; Khreesat was also on the CIA payroll. Abu Talb was given lifelong immunity from prosecution in exchange for his evidence at the Lockerbie trial; Marwan Khreesat was released for lack of evidence by German police even though a barometric timer of the type used to detonate the bomb on Pan Am Flight 103 was found in his car when he was arrested.\n\nOn 14 August 2009, Megrahi withdrew his appeal. South of Scotland SNP MSP Christine Grahame said, \"There are a number of vested interests who have been deeply opposed to this appeal continuing as they know it would go a considerable way towards exposing the truth behind Lockerbie... In the next days, weeks and months new information will be placed in the public domain that will make it clear that Mr Megrahi had nothing to do with the bombing of Pan Am 103.\" Tam Dalyell, the former Labour MP for West Lothian, has long believed Megrahi was the victim of a catastrophic miscarriage of justice, and has publicly stated that Megrahi is merely a scapegoat. Dalyell was supported by Nelson Mandela, the Church of Scotland, the Catholic Church, the law faculties of the Scottish universities, the representatives of British relatives and the UN's official observer at the trial in The Hague.\n\nAlastair Darling, the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer from 2007 to 2010, stated that \"It's true to say that the British Government wanted Megrahi out. It's probably true to say that [Scottish First Minister] Alex Salmond fancied a wander into the international stage\" but denies that British government had anything to do with the release.\n\nMegrahi married Aisha in 1982. They had five children: four sons and one daughter.\n\nOn 23 September 2008, Megrahi was diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer, prompting calls for his second appeal to be heard promptly.\n\nOn 4 December 2008, Megrahi's family joined others protesting against alleged miscarriages of justice within the Scottish justice system.\n\nAn online petition to the Scottish Ministers seeking Megrahi's compassionate release was raised on 19 December 2008. It stated that he was terminally ill and would benefit physically and psychologically from compassionate release to his temporary home in Glasgow while he awaited the outcome of the appeal granted to him by the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission in June 2007. Since it was likely to be many months before such an appeal was finally decided, the petition asked that Megrahi be allowed to spend his \"very limited\" remaining time in Scotland with his family and loved ones.\n\nOn 4 August 2009, the Cabinet Secretary for Justice in Scotland, Kenny MacAskill, visited Greenock Prison to hear Megrahi's request for a prisoner transfer to Libya. The following week it was reported that Megrahi was likely to be released within a few days on compassionate grounds due to terminal prostate cancer, although the Scottish Government dismissed this as \"complete speculation\"; meanwhile, a United States official said that the U.S. had no information suggesting Megrahi would be released and that he should serve out his sentence. MacAskill faced international pressure from politicians in the United Kingdom and United States, with U.S. victims' groups and Syracuse University (which lost 25 students in the Lockerbie bombing) all urging him not to release Megrahi.\n\nOn 14 August, lawyers representing Megrahi announced that he had applied to the High Court in Edinburgh two days previously to withdraw his second appeal, and that his condition had \"taken a significant turn for the worse\". On 19 August 2009, it was divulged that MacAskill had reached a decision on the bomber's fate to be announced the following day. The following day, MacAskill granted his release on compassionate grounds, stating that Megrahi was in the final stages of terminal prostate cancer and was expected to die within three months.\nSpeaking of the Scottish tradition of justice with compassion and mercy, MacAskill said he was \"bound by Scottish values to release him\", and allow him to die in his home country of Libya.\n\nImmediately following the announcement, Megrahi, who had served just over 8½ years of his life sentence, was escorted by Strathclyde Police to Glasgow Airport where he boarded a specially chartered aircraft to Tripoli operated by the Libyan state-owned Afriqiyah Airways. The aircraft - an Airbus A300 (registration 5A-IAY) - was the personal aircraft of Colonel Gaddafi; it was destroyed on the ground at Tripoli Airport in 2011 during fighting to overthrow the Gaddafi regime. Megrahi arrived back in time to join celebrations to mark 40 years since the country's revolution.\n\nMegrahi landed in Libya to national celebrations and acclaim. As he left the plane, a crowd of several hundred young people were gathered at Tripoli Airport to welcome him, some waving Libyan or Scottish flags, others throwing flower petals. Many had been ushered away by Libyan officials in an attempt to play down the arrival in accordance with British and US wishes. Megrahi was accompanied by Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, son of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, who had pledged in 2008 to bring al-Megrahi home, and was then joined on the aircraft steps by Lamin Khalifah Fhimah. This was the first time the pair had met since they had stood side by side during their eight-month trial at Camp Zeist, in the Netherlands 8½ years earlier.\n\nAfter he left the aircraft, Megrahi was driven away in convoy for a long-awaited meeting with his 86-year-old mother, Hajja Fatma Ali al-Araibi, who a few days earlier had pleaded emotionally with Scottish Ministers to release her son. Hajja had not been told of her son's terminal cancer for fear that the shock would be too much for her.\n\nMegrahi also met Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. The reception was shown afterwards on Libyan state television.\n\nIn an interview the following day with \"The Times\", Megrahi vowed to present new evidence before he died which would exonerate him of any involvement in the 1988 Lockerbie bombing. He said, \"If there is justice in the UK I would be acquitted or the verdict would be quashed because it was unsafe. There was a miscarriage of justice ... my message to the British and Scottish communities is that I will put out the evidence and ask them to be the jury\".\nIn May 2010, a sister of one of the victims expressed her desire to visit and forgive him, saying \"I want to look him in the eye and make sure he knows our pain... God will judge him\". She said the decision to release him was \"more than we could ever expect from Libya if the tables were turned.\"\n\nFollowing his release, Megrahi was taken to Tripoli Medical Center, Libya's most advanced public clinic, for cancer treatment. A video of him in the hospital showed him using an oxygen mask to breathe. On 2 September 2009, it was reported that his cancer had worsened, and that he had been transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). Libyan Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammed Seyala claimed that Megrahi had been moved to a special VIP wing of the hospital, was receiving full treatment from a team of doctors, and that his condition was not dangerous. Megrahi's family claimed that they had been informed that he had been taken to the ICU, but they were not allowed to visit him. The Foreign Ministry confirmed that his family were not allowed to visit him, but said that it was to ensure his safety. On 5 September, Megrahi was released from the ICU, but remained under close observation by a team of doctors.\n\nWhile in hospital, Megrahi underwent chemotherapy treatment, receiving the drug Docetaxel. He was discharged from hospital on 2 November, and sent to live with his family in the New Damascus district in west Tripoli, in a villa reportedly built or bought for him, shortly before his release, by the Libyan government. Under police protection, he resumed chemotherapy, making regular visits to hospital for chemotherapy sessions and other intensive treatment.\n\nFollowing the release, doubts were expressed whether Megrahi was as ill as claimed by MacAskill in his statement to the Scottish Parliament. The guidance on compassionate release of a terminally ill prisoner under Scottish law specifies that death must be likely to occur \"soon\"; there is no fixed time limit but a life expectancy of three months is suggested as \"appropriate\". The Labour MSP for Mid Scotland and Fife and a Minister in the previous Labour administration, Dr. Richard Simpson, accused the Scottish justice minister of failing to conduct sufficient checks before deciding to release Megrahi. Dr. Simpson, a former member of the British Association of Urological Surgeons' prostate cancer working group who specialised in prostate disease research, expressed doubt that Megrahi would die within the next three months and claimed that he could live for eight months, going on to say that, \"Kenny MacAskill released him apparently on the advice of just one doctor whose status is not clear and who is not named.\" He added that a second specialist opinion in palliative care should have been sought before the release. A source close to the justice secretary called Simpson's comments \"tasteless\" and added: \"I really don't think we should be speculating on the day somebody is going to die.\"\n\nOn 27 August 2009, \"The Scotsman\", quoting an anonymous Scottish Government source, reported that MacAskill ignored the advice of four specialists who were unwilling to speculate on Megrahi's anticipated lifespan.\n\nReviewing the case, members of Holyrood's justice committee stated that Scottish Prison Service guidelines were not followed in the decision to release Megrahi, that the medical evidence presented was flimsy, and that four cancer specialists had refused to back up the opinion of the prison doctor that Megrahi would be dead within three months. However the prison doctors and numerous experts brought in had said that Megrahi met the Scottish standards for release. The release of prisoners on compassionate grounds is up to the Minister of Justice and not to a committee.\n\nSoon afterwards, Libyan media reported that Megrahi was able to talk to his mother by telephone from his hospital bed and \"The Times\", at the beginning of November, suggested that his condition had not deteriorated significantly.\n\nIn early April 2010 it was reported that his cancer was no longer responding to treatment. The cancer consultant Karol Sikora, who had originally supported the three months prognosis (although his evidence was not allowed to contribute to the release decision as he was paid by the Libyan authorities), reported that Megrahi was bed-bound and had probably no more than four weeks to live, with his earlier apparent recovery probably due to his being with his family. The Libyan Consul General in Glasgow also reported that his condition had rapidly deteriorated. In July 2010, Dr Sikora told \"The Daily Telegraph\", \"There was always a chance he could live for 10 years, 20 years ... but that would be unusual\". He also stated that \"It was clear that three months was what they (the Libyan government) were aiming for\" adding that \"On the balance of probabilities, he felt he could sort of justify that.\"\n\nIn response to an attempt to have his medical condition made public from Scottish Tories in July 2010, First Minister Alex Salmond compared him to one of Britain's most famous prisoners, Ronald Biggs, who was outliving al-Megrahi while on compassionate release.\n\nIn a July 2010 interview with Scottish Television Dr Sikora said that his statements were misquoted extensively by dropping his qualification that 10 years' survival \"would be unusual\". He stated that the chances of such a long survival would be less than 1% but there was a 90% likelihood that he would be dead in a matter of weeks. UPI was still reporting the other version in August 2010.\n\nLibyan media outlets reported Megrahi had been released from the hospital and was living at his family's villa.\n\nOn 26 July 2011, during the Libyan Civil War, Megrahi was shown on Libyan state television, attending a pro-Gaddafi rally of members of his tribe. Megrahi appeared to be frail, and was in a wheelchair. However, in late August 2011, CNN reported that a TV crew had found Megrahi comatose and, according to his family, on his deathbed. Notwithstanding this report, in early October in an interview with Reuters from his bed, al-Megrahi protested his innocence and claimed that he had only days, weeks or months to live. On 13 April 2012, he was hospitalized. He died on 20 May 2012, aged 60. \n\nOn 29 August 2011, a letter written by Megrahi was discovered by \"The Wall Street Journal\" at intelligence headquarters in Tripoli, Libya. In what was a private letter to Libya's intelligence chief not previously available to the public, Megrahi wrote \"I am an innocent man,\" a letter apparently composed while he was serving a life sentence in Scotland, and written in blue ink on ordinary paper. The letter was found in a steel four-drawer filing cabinet that had been forced open by rebels who entered the office of intelligence chief Abdullah al-Senussi.\n\nJim Swire, whose daughter Flora was killed in the bombing and who has been a spokesman for UK Families Flight 103, which represented British relatives, has said that he believes Megrahi is innocent. Swire is also concerned by comments attributed to the former lord advocate Lord Fraser, which appeared to doubt the credibility of the key prosecution witness, Tony Gauci. Swire said \"the scandal around Megrahi is not that a sick man was released, but that he was ever convicted in the first place. All I have ever wanted is to see the people who murdered my daughter are brought to justice.\"\n\nProfessor Robert Black, an expert in Scots law who devised the non-jury trial that saw the Lockerbie case heard in 2000, has called Megrahi's murder conviction \"the most disgraceful miscarriage of justice in Scotland for 100 years\". Prof Black said he felt \"a measure of personal responsibility\" for persuading Libya to allow Megrahi and his co-accused, Al-Amin Khalifa Fhima, who was acquitted, to stand trial under Scots law.\n\nI have written about this and nobody is interested. Every lawyer who has ... read the judgment says 'this is nonsense'. It is nonsense. It really distresses me; I won't let it go.\n\nThe non-profit religious think tank Ekklesia noted that \"all of the Crown's witnesses in the 36-week trial, which took place at a specially convened Scottish Court in the Netherlands, have subsequently been discredited. In the latest revelation, a prosecution expert misled judges about key evidence, according to a classified police memo published by the Sunday Herald on 17 July [2011],\" cautioning that\n\nDr Swire, other UK relatives of the victims, and a range of legal campaigners, including Professor Black, say that the May 2000 trial of two Libyan suspects, the other of whom was not convicted, amounts to a cover up and a serious miscarriage of justice. Their concern is that the truth has not come out, and that the guilty have not been brought to justice.\n\nMegrahi himself, according to his cousin, used to say \n\nIf God gives me life and health I will appeal my case and prove my innocence.\n\nOn 28 August 2009, \"The Herald\" published an interview conducted with Colonel Gaddafi's son, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, in which he stated that Megrahi's release was not tied to any oil deals but was an entirely separate issue. Referring to the Prisoner Transfer Agreement (PTA), he continued, \"People should not get angry because we were talking about commerce or oil. We signed an oil deal at the same time. The commerce and politics and deals were all with the PTA. This was one animal and the other was the compassionate release. They are two completely different animals.\"\n\nOn 30 August, an article published in the \"Sunday Times\" claimed ministers at Westminster had agreed not to specifically exclude al-Megrahi from an agreement concerning prisoner transfers in 2007 because of \"overwhelming national interests\". In a letter dated 19 December 2007, Secretary of State for Justice Jack Straw wrote to his Scottish counterpart, \"I had previously accepted the importance of the al-Megrahi issue to Scotland and said I would try to get an exclusion for him on the face of the agreement. I have not been able to secure an explicit exclusion. The wider negotiations with the Libyans are reaching a critical stage and, in view of the overwhelming interests for the UK, I have agreed that in this instance the [PTA] should be in the standard form and not mention any individual.\" Straw is quoted as stating that an application under the prisoner transfer agreement was turned down. Straw denied that the release was part of any deal, while Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond reiterated that the release had been granted on compassionate grounds and not as part of any deal struck by the British Government.\n\nOn 16 July 2010, four United States senators made public their concerns over the release, stating they believed that the oil company BP pushed for his release to secure a deal with Libya. BP confirmed that it did press for a Prisoner Transfer Agreement as it was aware that a delay might have \"negative consequences\" for UK commercial interests. However, the firm said it was not involved in any discussions regarding Megrahi's release. A spokesman for the Scottish government insisted that they acted alone stating: \"The Scottish government had no contact from BP in relation to Mr Al-Megrahi.\" Further hearings examining Megrahi's release, due to be held at Capitol Hill on 29 July, were postponed when the US Dept of Justice and British witnesses – and in particular from the Scottish Government – refused to attend, and were rescheduled for September the same year, before the then forthcoming senatorial elections.\n\nWhile President Obama expressed surprise at the decision, stating \"I think all of us here in the United States were surprised, disappointed and angry about the release\", the U.S. government was aware that a release was possible. The deputy head of the U.S. embassy in London, Frank LeBaron, wrote in a letter to the Scottish first minister Alex Salmond that the U.S. believed al-Megrahi should remain in prison for his role in downing Pan Am flight 103 in 1988, and continued: \"Nevertheless, if Scottish authorities come to the conclusion that Megrahi must be released from Scottish custody, the U.S. position is that conditional release on compassionate grounds would be a far preferable alternative to prisoner transfer, which we strongly oppose.\" This same letter stressed the importance to the United States of America of a 3-months prognosis, despite it not being a legal requirement in Scotland: \"any such release should only come after the results of independent and comprehensive medical exams clearly establishing that Megrahi's life expectancy is less than three months\".\n\nOn 18 September 2009, Megrahi released a 300-page dossier of evidence that challenges the prosecution case against him, and that he believed would have secured his release on appeal. The release of the evidence dossier was condemned by Lord Advocate Elish Angiolini, who said that Megrahi had abandoned his appeal before his release on compassionate grounds.\n\nCable 08LONDON2673 (dated 2008-10-24) from US Embassy London reports:\n\nCable 09TRIPOLI65 (dated 2009-01-28) from US Embassy Tripoli reports:\n\nAnother stated that the UK feared action by Libya against British interests if Megrahi died in jail. It also stated that the UK government fully supported his release by the Scottish government.\n\nThe United States urged the National Transitional Council (NTC) to review the case, with a view towards deporting Megrahi if he did not die in the meantime. The Scottish government rejected the calls, saying that only it could make such a request, and that it would not do so, as Megrahi had abided by the conditions of his release. NTC leaders initially said that they would not deport Megrahi or any other Libyan, but also admitted that only the future elected government of Libya could deal with such issues.\n\nFollowing the fall of Tripoli when forces of the NTC had largely taken control of Libya, there were calls for al-Megrahi to be extradited to the United States. These calls were dismissed by the Scottish government and the NTC in Libya until such time as a decision can be made by the new elected government\".\n\nThe United States government has said that it has asked the new Libyan government to re-examine the Megrahi case.\n\nOn 30 August 2011, the Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond said, \"The latest pictures broadcast of Mr al-Megrahi clearly demonstrate that he is an extremely sick man, dying of terminal prostate cancer. Hopefully, this will end the ridiculous conspiracy theories that seek to claim anything else.\" He also said that the issue was under Scottish jurisdiction and that what American lawyers and senators had to say \"was neither here nor there\". In October 2011 Al-Megrahi gave an interview from his bed in which he claimed that he had only days, weeks or months to live.\n\nAfter the death of Muammar Gaddafi on 20 October 2011, the United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called for al-Megrahi to be returned to prison in Scotland, describing the release of al-Megrahi as a miscarriage of justice. Additionally Clinton stated that having already raised the question of al-Megrahi's return to a Scottish prison with the leadership of the NTC, she would raise the matter again once a Libyan government had been formed. Clinton also indicated that, while preferring imprisonment in Scotland, she supported imprisonment outside Scotland over al-Megrahi remaining out of jail. In early November, the U.S. State Department indicated that it was preparing to make a \"formal approach\" to the NTC, requesting al-Megrahi's extradition to the United States.\n\nAl-Megrahi died at home in Tripoli on 20 May 2012 at the age of 60. His funeral was held the following day, on 21 May.\n\nBritish Prime Minister David Cameron, speaking at a NATO summit in Chicago, said that it was a day to think of the victims of \"an appalling terrorist act\". Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond also stated that people should use the occasion of al-Megrahi's death to remember the Lockerbie victims. \"The Guardian\" reported that Libyans \"expressed relief rather than sadness\" at news of al-Megrahi's death, as he was a reminder of the international sanctions that had impoverished the country following the bombing.\n\nMany families of the Lockerbie victims called for al-Megrahi's appeal to be reopened following his death and headed by investigators outside Scotland, claiming that it would exonerate al-Megrahi. Cameron refused, stating, \"I'm very clear that the court case was properly done and properly dealt with.\"\n\nAlex Salmond said it was up to Megrahi's relatives to apply to the Scottish Criminal Case Review Commission to seek a further appeal, adding that his death \"ends one chapter of the Lockerbie case, but it does not close the book\".\n\nIn May 2014, a group of relatives of the Lockerbie victims continued to campaign for al-Megrahi's name to be cleared by reopening the case.\n\nOn 5 June 2014, it was announced that one of Scotland's top criminal lawyers Aamer Anwar was instructed by immediate members of Al-Megrahi's family. Although Al-Megrahi had died from cancer following his compassionate release from prison an application was still being lodged with the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission seeking to review his case and return it to the appeal court as a miscarriage of justice. Aamer Anwar was also instructed by 24 British relatives of passengers who died on the flight including Dr. Jim Swire. In December 2014, Frank Mulholland, the Lord Advocate (Scotland's senior law officer), restated his belief that al-Megrahi had been guilty of the bombing and that he was hopeful that progress might be made in the continuing investigation to find al-Megrahi's accomplices.\n\nIn December 2018 Eddie Fenech Adami, Malta's Prime Minister at the time of the bombing, said \"we have never accepted the theory\" of how Abdul Baset Ali al-Megrahi transported the bomb from Malta to the UK and suggested that a miscarriage of justice had taken place.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2028582", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2028582", "title": "Bellarine Peninsula", "text": "Bellarine Peninsula\n\nThe Bellarine Peninsula is a peninsula located south-west of Melbourne in Victoria, Australia, surrounded by Port Phillip, Corio Bay and Bass Strait. The peninsula, together with the Mornington Peninsula separates Port Phillip from Bass Strait. The peninsula itself was originally occupied by Indigenous Australian clans of the Wathaurong nation, prior to European settlement in the early 19th century. Early European settlements were initially centred on wheat and grain agriculture, before the area became a popular tourist destination with most visitors arriving by paddle steamer on Port Phillip in the late 19th century.\n\nToday, approximately 55,000 people live on the peninsula and unlike its cousin, the Mornington Peninsula, this number increases only slightly during peak tourist months. However, the peninsula is a growing tourist region with a variety of beaches and seaside resorts and wineries; most of the peninsula is a part of the City of Greater Geelong.\n\nThe area of Geelong and the Bellarine Peninsula was originally occupied by Indigenous Australian clans of the Wathaurong nation, prior to European settlement in the early 19th century. The convict William Buckley escaped from the Sullivan Bay settlement in 1803, and lived among the Wathaurong people for 32 years on the Bellarine Peninsula. In 1835, John Batman used Indented Head as his base camp, leaving behind several employees whilst he returned to Tasmania (then known as Van Diemen's Land) for more supplies and his family. In this same year, Buckley surrendered to the party led by John Helder Wedge and was later pardoned by Lieutenant-Governor Sir George Arthur, and subsequently given the position of interpreter to the natives.\n\nBy the 1850s the peninsula was known as ‘the granary of the colony’ and Portarlington became a major player in the wheat industry. Transport was by sea on Port Phillip Bay due to the poor roads. By the 1870s excursion traffic to the peninsula commenced, with tourists travelling from Melbourne by paddle steamers to enjoy fishing and swimming by the bay, with the coastal towns being major holiday resorts. In 1879 one of the first branch railways was built in Victoria, from South Geelong station to Drysdale and Queenscliff. Encouraging the growth in agricultural production and leading to the decline in the bay steamer traffic to towns along the way, the line did not close until 1976.\nIn recent years with improved roads the peninsula has become popular with people employed in Geelong, with population growth in towns such as Leopold, Drysdale and Ocean Grove. The Seachange demographic phenomenon has also led to increased growth. Ironically, the Australian TV series \"SeaChange\" was filmed at various locations on the peninsula, particularly at Barwon Heads, which helped promote tourism on the peninsula. The peninsula is showing signs of environmental consciousness and attitudes towards sustainability, much the same as the Mornington Peninsula.\n\nThe Bellarine Peninsula is a gently to moderately undulating landform that protrudes in an east and north-easterly direction into Port Phillip. The peninsula is generally considered to begin its protrusion from between the town of Torquay and east of Geelong. It is surrounded by Corio Bay and the Outer Harbour to the north, Port Phillip to the north-east and east, The Rip to the south-east and Bass Strait to the south.\n\nThe peninsula's eastern regions host several bays and islands such as The Rip, Lonsdale Bay, Swan Bay, Swan Island, Rabbit Island and various other small islands. The central and north-eastern regions host a gently undulating topography with no major rivers, mountains or significant landforms. The most distinct feature in the western region of the peninsula is the Barwon River which flows through a series of large lakes and extensive wetlands before emptying into Bass Strait at Barwon Heads.\n\nThe uplifted block of the Bellarine Peninsula forms a very weakly dissected undulating plain of low elevation, less than 150m. Drainage from the remnant basalts of the Palaeogene Older Volcanics forms a vaguely radial pattern on the elevated plateau. A narrow strip of deeply weathered Cretaceous Otway Group rocks occurs in outcrop along the southern edge of the Curlewis Monocline, which forms the northern boundary of the peninsula. Landslides and narrow gullies have formed along the northern edge of the monocline. A sheet of marine sands of Late Neogene age covers the southern portion of the uplifted Bellarine block.\n\nThe majority of soils on the peninsula consist of grey-brown sedimentary sandy loams, overlaying medium to heavy textured clay. The Bellarine Hills are a significant variation with heavy black self mulching clay loams being well suited to intensive crop production. Mining of shell grit for glass making was an important industry on the shores of Swan Bay.\n\nMuch of the native vegetation throughout the peninsula has been cleared for agriculture, notable exceptions being areas of land around Swan Bay, parklands in Portarlington, coastal areas along the Barwon Coast and some small remnant pockets around the Barwon River lakes and wetlands, many of these last remaining areas are protected or included in parklands. The largest area of original native woodland vegetation remaining on the Peninsula lies in the 143 hectare Ocean Grove Nature Reserve.\n\nThe peninsula contains several significant wetlands, many of which form part of the Port Phillip Bay (Western Shoreline) and Bellarine Peninsula Ramsar Site and are of international significance for the protection of waterbirds and the critically endangered orange-bellied parrot. They are also recognised by BirdLife International in the Bellarine Wetlands and Swan Bay and Port Phillip Bay Islands Important Bird Areas.\n\nMarine mammals visit here include whales (southern right and southern humpback), endemic Burrunan dolphins, Australian fur seals and Australian sea lions.\n\nThe peninsula is covered by two local government areas with a population of approximately 55,337. There were around 25% over sixty years old which is significantly higher than the national average of 18%.\n\nThe Borough of Queenscliffe, situated on the peninsula is the last remaining borough left in Victoria, and was the only local government area not changed in the mass Victorian municipality reorganisation of 1993 enacted by then Liberal Premier Jeff Kennett. The remainder of the peninsula is part of the City of Greater Geelong, having been part of the Rural City of Bellarine before this time. The peninsula is also one of the parishes of the County of Grant, one of the Cadastral divisions of Australia.\n\nSome of the more significant and historical shipwrecks include;\n\n\n\n\nBlack Rock on the southern coast (near Breamlea) is the location of the main ocean outfall for Geelong's sewage. Opened in 1915, initially the sewage was left untreated before being discharged into the ocean. A primary filtration system was installed in the 1970s, and in the 1980s the current plant was built with an upgraded filtration system, along with a 1.2 kilometre long ocean outfall. The plant was upgraded in 1997, with secondary filtration introduced, and a pipeline installed to transport recycled water to the flower farm at Torquay.\n\nA 60 kW capacity wind generator is located on Black Rock Road in Breamlea. Erected in November 1987 by the then State Electricity Commission of Victoria and the Victorian Solar Energy Council (now Energy Victoria) as a demonstration, it was sold in 1994 to the Alternative Technology Association of Melbourne. Electricity production ceased at 1200hrs on 17 May 2003 due to an electrical generator burn-out, caused by moisture, salt, and electrical flash-over. The wind generator remains in place today intact.\n\n"}

It is noted for being one of only four bridges in England to incorporate a chapel (the others being at Rotherham, Wakefield, and Bradford-on-Avon).\n\nPrior to the first bridge here there was a ford across the Ouse, probably dating back several thousand years. The river was at that time wider and shallower until locks were added to make it navigable.\n\nThe St Ives settlement was developed by the monks of Ramsey Abbey who built the town's first bridge, a wooden structure, in 1107. In 1414 it was decided to replace this bridge with a stone arch bridge, which was completed in 1425, adding the bridge chapel dedicated to St Leger in 1426.\n\nSuch chapels were relatively common in medieval times and served as toll-houses, as well as to allow travellers to pray or to give thanks for a safe journey. They also hosted church services.\n\nDuring the English Civil War the bridge was partially blown up by the troops of Oliver Cromwell to prevent King Charles I's troops approaching London from the Royalist base in Lincolnshire. The two arches on the southern side were demolished and a drawbridge installed in 1645 as a defensive measure by Cromwell's forces, who held the town. The drawbridge remained in use until 1716. When the bridge was partially rebuilt that year, the shape of the new arches was different from the surviving ones, leaving the bridge with two rounded arches on its South side and two Gothic arches on the North.\n\nAt some point, the bridge chapel fell into disuse and was for a time, in fact, used as a bawdy house, during the eighteenth century. St Ives was an official last stop of all the many drovers with their livestock, who descended upon St Ives before for accommodation, refreshments and other relief, during what was a famously exhausting journey to the market called Smithfield, within London. At one time there were dozens of doss houses, inns and other bawdy houses, in and around St Ives town centre; in the old days, a defunct chapel was just another place to do business, presumably.\n\nThe chapel was restored in 1930, having previously served as a toll house, inn and as a private residence. It had originally been designed as a chapel, though, and dedicated by the monks to Saint Leger. By 1736 it was being used as accommodation, and in that year two extra floors were added. During the 1850s and 1860s it was turned into a notorious public house named \"Little Hell\", then a doctor's surgery. By 1930 the structure was found to be weakened so the extra stories were removed and the chapel restored. As a result of this, the roof is modern. An unusual feature is the crypt, about two metres above the river's water level. The bridge and the chapel are now Grade I listed and a Scheduled Ancient Monument. The chapel is still used for public worship on an occasional basis.\n\nThe bridge served as the primary southern entrance to the town and the only road bridge across the river until Harrison Way by-pass was added down-river to the east in 1980.\n\nThe bridge is one of nine Scheduled Ancient Monument Grade 1 in Cambridgeshire. All maintenance must be carried out in a sympathetic manner to preserve its aesthetic and functional aspects. Since 1980 the foundations have been strengthened and the structure reinforced. In 1998 the bridge was resurfaced, special precautions being taken to prevent water ingress into the structure. In 2002, external lighting of the arches and chapel was fitted, along with internal lighting of the chapel and lights fitted into the pedestrian refuges at each pier. English Heritage control all work on the bridge, although it is not one of the properties in Cambridgeshire that they own.\n\nA gravel lorry breached the parapet. St Ives sub-aqua club recovered the stones from the river-bed. Mr George Hunter from Huntington was one of the local tradesman assigned to restore the chapel after this event. All tradesmen who worked on the project have details engraved on the stones that rebuilt the bridge chapel.\n\nDuring the big flood this year an amphibious tank breached the parapet.\n\nA Home Guard Bren gun carrier breached the parapet.\n\n"}

The region is named for the native \"Aristida stricta\", commonly known as wiregrass due to its texture.\n\nThe region stretches approximately from just below Macon, Georgia and follows the Fall Line west to Montgomery, Alabama. From there it turns south and runs to approximately Washington County, Florida in the northern panhandle. From there it runs east, roughly making its southern boundary along Interstate 10 to Lake City, Florida. From there it turns north, roughly following the Suwannee River back into Georgia and along the western fringes of the Okefenokee Swamp. From here it runs due north back to Macon.\n\nInterstate 75, Interstate 10, U.S. Route 231, U.S. Route 331, and portions of Interstate 65 traverse parts of the Wiregrass. The portion of U.S. Route 84 through Georgia is known as the Wiregrass Georgia Parkway.\n\nMajor cities in the region include:\n\nThe region includes Fort Rucker, a U.S. Army post located mostly in Dale County, Alabama. The post is the primary flight training base for Army Aviation and is home to the United States Army Aviation Center of Excellence (USAACE) and the United States Army Aviation Museum, as well as Moody Air Force Base located in Lowndes and Lanier County, Georgia. Moody AFB is the home of the 23d Wing. The wing executes worldwide close air support, force protection, and combat search and rescue operations (CSAR) in support of humanitarian interests, United States national security and the global war on terrorism (GWOT).\n\nThere are two major waterways in the region, and they bisect the Wiregrass, dividing it into three portions. The Chattahoochee River and the Flint River join to form the Apalachicola River, which flows south from Bainbridge, Georgia and Lake Seminole to the Gulf of Mexico at Apalachicola, Florida. Other waterways include Little Choctawhatchee River, Choctawhatchee River, and Choctawhatchee Bay.\n\nThe Wiregrass Region suffers from extremely high humidity in the summer (due to its proximity to the Gulf) and enjoys mild winters. Snowfall occurs occasionally in this region in extremely cold years. The area is also prone to hurricanes and tropical storms, most notably, Hurricane Michael which devastated the area during October 2018.\n\nThe Wiregrass Region received over of snow on February 12, 2010. The region had not seen this depth of snowfall since the 1970s or 1990s. The first winter storm warning in many years was issued in the Wiregrass and Florida.\n\n\"Harper's Magazine\" published a poem by Charles Ghigna in September 1974 describing the Wiregrass Region; it is titled \"The Alabama Wiregrassers.\"\n\n"}

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 22, 1998. It was written by Dan Greaney and directed by Neil Affleck. The episode sees Ralph Wiggum becoming friends with Bart. Phil Hartman guest stars as recurring character Troy McClure.\n\nAt a science museum the family is visiting, Bart runs into Ralph Wiggum, who is in the process of being pushed into a giant ear by Kearney, Jimbo, Nelson, and Dolph. When Ralph is freed by a museum employee, Marge and Chief Wiggum are there to meet him. Marge observes that Ralph has a vivid imagination and learns that he has no friends to play with; she arranges a play-date for Ralph to spend time with a horrified Bart, who fears that being seen with Ralph will damage his reputation.\n\nDuring their play-date, Bart and Ralph walk into Ralph's father's closet, consisting of various police utilities and records before Wiggum, initially forbidding them to enter the closet, allows them to play with the items. Bart then sees Wiggum toss aside a police master key capable of opening any door in Springfield. Bart and Ralph thus steal the key and decide to enter several closed stores at night. After encountering Nelson and his gang, the boys go to a condemned penitentiary. When Ralph objects because he is afraid, the bullies leave, but not before tossing the key into the penitentiary. Ralph and Bart enter the prison to retrieve the key, and in the process stumble onto a room housing an old electric chair. After testing out the chair, the two flee when an elderly guard approaches.\n\nAt the Simpsons' home, Bart and Ralph discover that the penitentiary will once again be used by the town, and remember that they forgot to disable the power. Unaware that the power is now active, Mayor Quimby straps himself into the electric chair in a publicity attempt. After failing to call the penitentiary, Ralph then tells Bart that Lisa can probably figure out a way to warn the Mayor. She decides to launch a model rocket with a warning message attached and aims it toward the penitentiary. However, the rocket is blown off-course and crashes through Mr. Burns' office window. As Quimby is getting electrocuted by the chair, Mr. Burns reads the note and disables the penitentiary's power, barely saving Quimby from getting killed. In the aftermath, the Simpsons congratulate Ralph, for pointing out that Lisa could solve the problem. Lisa objects but joins in after Bart points out that Ralph deserves some credit.\n\nShow runner Mike Scully had pitched an idea to Dan Greaney on Marge forcing Bart to become Ralph Wiggum's friend. Scully gave the idea to Greaney due to his ability to write Ralph's lines and actions well, and his overall liking of the character.\n\nThis episode was the second to focus on Ralph, after the fourth-season episode \"I Love Lisa\". Despite this, in 2007, producer J. Stewart Burns did not believe Ralph had an episode with a plot centered on him.\n\nThe robot that was introduced early in the episode was influenced by Greaney's experiences working with a \"USA Today\" themed robot. While at a baseball game with the robot, the robot led the stadium in singing \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\". The robot was not well-received, and the spectators threw objects at it. The robot's operator had to stay close to the robot during the baseball game, and was also teased and bothered in the same way as the operator in the episode.\n\nEpisode director Neil Affleck was praised by the staff for his directing in this episode. In the scene where Chief Wiggum falls on his back in his bedroom, unable to roll over or get back up, Affleck decided to act out the scene for the staff to showcase how Affleck envisioned Chief Wiggum's predicament. Affleck was also praised for his ability to create three new elaborate settings in the episode: the science museum, the Springfield penitentiary, and the large toy store.\n\nThe episode originally did not involve Lisa helping Ralph and Bart to brainstorm an idea to alert the penitentiary. The original scene, which Greaney cites as one of his favorite scenes in the show, despite never actually being in the show, involved Bart, Ralph, and Homer trying to make a plan to save Mayor Quimby.\n\nIn its original broadcast, \"This Little Wiggy\" finished 27th in ratings for the week of March 16–22, 1998, with a Nielsen rating of 9.1, equivalent to approximately 8.9 million viewing households. It was the second highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following \"Ally McBeal\".\n\nThe authors of the book \"I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide\", Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, enjoyed the episode, remarking: \"Marvellous fun as Bart comes to realize there's more to Ralph, or at least his daddy, than he realised.\"\n\n"}

He is now Baker Skateboard's sole owner. Andrew established Bakerboys Distribution with Erik Ellington and Jim Greco in 2007. Bakerboys Distribution provides distribution for closely related in-house skateboard companies such as Deathwish Skateboards and Shake Junt. He is also the head of design at Altamont Apparel. Andrew primarily skates street.\n\nAndrew Reynolds first picked up a skateboard when he was 9 years old. He was influenced by Powell videos at the time.\n\nReynolds emerged into the skateboarding scene in the early 1990s. Following a phone call from professional skateboarder and ex-Bones Brigade member Tony Hawk, Reynolds joined Birdhouse. Reynolds has stated that Hawk contacted Reynolds with little knowledge about the latter's skateboarding. Reynolds explained in 2008:\nTo me, that was such a trip when they told me, \"The ams [amateurs] on Birdhouse are gonna be you and Ocean Howell.\" And I'm, like, \"Me! And the guy, from the H Street video with the Doors song and everything?!\" I was like, \"Oh my god!\", it's not even right. Some little kid from a hick town, and the other am is Ocean Howell? It's wrong. It just was so wrong. At first, when I met him I was just a fan. But then we became friends. He would get a girl at every demo almost and I'm just... amazed! I [thought] \"Man, how does he do it? He's so cool.\"\n\nProfessional skateboarder and Emerica team manager Heath Kirchart revealed in 2007 that he perceived Reynolds as his competition, as Reynolds was recruited to Birdhouse after he joined the team. Kirchart further explained:\nI don't tell many people this. But there was [a] point, I remember when [we] were filming \"The End\" when he kickflip noseslided the UCI ten-stair. I [thought], \"Holy shit! Hopefully, I'll do that.\" And I didn't. But it was my coming to \"Wow! He's better than me.\" And since that time it's been \"way\" better than me. He's not just better than me—he's \"way\" better than me.\n\nIn 1998, Reynolds was featured in the fourth Birdhouse video \"The End\", with a section of his footage from the Bro Bowl in Tampa.\n\nIn 2000, Reynolds left Birdhouse and started the Baker brand with Jay Strickland; the company was named after a lifestyle in which a person \"gets baked\" (smokes and experiences the effects of the drug cannabis) and skateboards every day. In 2007, Reynolds provided a detailed account of the company's beginnings:\nWell, I was living in Huntington, riding for Birdhouse. We just thought to ourselves, all these companies are really lame. Birdhouse doesn't promote piles, you know what I mean? Zero's not promoting what we're all about. We met up with Jay Strickland [and] we started telling him about our ideas. \"We want do something. We want do a company.\" And we're like, \"All of us, together.\" It was just a big mess. I went and talked to Tony [Hawk] and Per [Welinder]—\"It's either [that] I quit and take a bunch of guys and do something, or you guys help me start a company\"\n\nThe skateboard deck brand signed a distribution deal with Blitz Distribution, the company that, at the time, was distributing Birdhouse and other brands, such as Fury and Hook-Ups (Blitz had originally been formed by Per Welinder and Hawk to distribute their own products). As of 2008, the brand was the top-selling brand under the Blitz Distribution umbrella. Reynolds has publicly disclosed that all of the Baker team members, including himself, receive the same amount of remuneration: \"I get paid the same as Braydon. Dustin tried to ask for more money one time…I had to tell him, like, everybody gets paid the same…there’s no favoritism.\"\n\nThe company then parted ways with Blitz and, in 2007, Reynolds and fellow professional skateboarders, Jim Greco and Erik Ellington, established Bakerboys Distribution to distribute the Deathwish brand. Baker's distribution was then newly managed by Bakerboys in 2011. As of July 2014, Bakerboys distributes seven brands, some of which are owned by past and current Baker riders.\n\nAs of November 2018, Reynolds has released thirteen signature shoe models with skateboarding shoe company Emerica: The Reynolds 1, The Reynolds 2, The Reynolds 3, The Boss, The Reynolds Light, The AR Slim, Reynolds Cruisers, The Reynolds Classics, The Reynolds, The Reynolds low, the Reynolds Low Vulc, the Reynolds 3 G6 and the Reynolds G6.\n\nIn September 2019, Reynolds and Emerica announced they had parted ways.\n\nIn 2006, Reynolds collaborated with Sole Technology, the owner of the Emerica shoe brand, on the joint skateboard clothing venture Altamont Apparel. During the launch event, held at the Altamont Speedway car-racing venue, Reynolds stated that he had been inspired by the spirit of rebellion and freedom that had defined the Rolling Stones concert at the speedway in 1969. For the launch, a select group of retailers, journalists, and members of the skateboarding community were driven in limousines to the Altamont Speedway, where they listened to Reynolds speak about the brand and participated in the brand's launch.\n\nIn collaboration with the creative direction of Reynolds, the head designer for the brand is English artist FOS, who is also the owner of the Heroin skateboard brand. As of October 2012, the brand's team includes Mike Watt, Brian Hansen, Neen Williams, Kenny Hoyle, Jon Dickson, Justin Figeroa, and Bryan Herman. Former riders have included Garrett Hill and Theotis Beasley, with a signature Beasley clothing line released in early 2012.\n\nAs of September 2019, Reynolds is sponsored by Baker Skateboards, Vans, Spitfire Wheels, Brigada, Independent, Shake Junt, Stance.\n\nCalled \"Madness\" by Reynolds himself, he experiences a \"condition\" while skateboarding that has been perceived as a mild form of obsessive compulsive disorder, even though an official diagnosis has not been confirmed. In a 2007 episode of the online show \"Epicly Later'd\" the Vice YouTube channel depicted an example of the \"Madness\" while Reynolds was filming a trick in San Francisco, California.: \"And he's gonna walk right up to the top and tap the wall three times. And then he comes and checks it [the area where the trick is being performed] again. He's gonna say, 'Lance, Beagle, Mike' ... ready? [Reynolds] 'Lance?' ... 'Beagle?' ... 'Mike?'\n\nReynolds explained in the Vice interview:\nLike, before I go to bed at night, I go to the door, and I lock it ... nine times, but, like, three, three, three; three, three, three; three, three, three; and I do that ... three times. And, then, sometimes I'm layin' down, and I'm, like, \"Did I do it?\", and I go back. And then it's once I do that, then it has to be the nine, the whole thing—three, three, three, three, three, three—three time. And, then, if I messed up and did it, then I have to do that whole thing three times. You know what I mean?\n\nAs part of the DVD release of the Emerica video \"Stay Gold\", a bonus section on the \"Madness\" was included. While watching footage of his pre-trick behaviour, Reynolds states, \"I don't know what I'm doing right here. Ha ha. I don't know. Like, if you would've told me if someone would've told me, 'You rolled up, without trying a noseslide, twenty times, or thirty times, I woulda said, \"Nuh. You're wrong.\" Professional skateboarder and teammate Jerry Hsu explained in the same video:\nWell, lately, he's been really into being healthy and exercising. I'm rooming with him right now, and it's like we're in a gym; the room is like a gym, where he's just constantly eating bananas and only healthy stuff. He's stretching all the time and it's only to get tricks, that's what he says. He's just like, \"I just gotta do whatever I can to get tricks.\" Do everything he possibly can to do it just the way he pictured it. He's totally obsessive about it and it's really rad; I like it.\n\nIn an interview for the online series \"Free Lunch\", produced by RIDE Channel, Reynolds stated about Hawk:\n... and then Tony's just, like, Tony Hawk. Basically, to me, it says, \"You can be a skater and take over everything and use skateboarding to be a businessman, a role model to young people.\" He's just the best. And he called my house when I was fifteen, and [asked] \"Do you wanna do something with us?\", not knowing anything about me. Yeah, Tony's the man. Sure, he's the best.\n\nIn 2012, Reynolds recruited Hawk's son Riley Hawk for Baker and explained the process in an online interview:\n... I [thought], \"it's kinda touchy, you know what I mean, like?\" It's kind of weird, you know? Tony's kid, he rides for Birdhouse. But I look at it [and] I picture him on Baker, you know what I mean? So we just approached Tony [and said] \"We want to talk to Riley about maybe getting [him] some Baker boards or something like that.\" And Tony's like, \"Man, he's rippin'. He's nineteen years old. It's really up to him. You guys talk to him.\" So we just kind of said, \"You wanna get some boards?\" He's like, \"I'm down, man!\" And [the way] I look at it, there would be no Baker without Tony and Birdhouse. I know it's an ongoing process, you know? Tony quits to start Birdhouse. I quit to start Baker. My guys quit to start a new brand. It's just an ongoing thing.\n\nOn Mark Gonzales, Reynolds has stated:\nGonz is the most influential skater of all time, no question. Mark Gonzales created how to street skate, doing handrails and things that no one has ever done. When people were doing a boardslide on the rail and thought that was super crazy, he was doing 180 nosegrinds and 180 fakie 50-50s. The best and most technical skater today doing the hardest tricks beyond what anyone could think of is not doing what Gonz was doing then. It’s just not the same. \n\nReynolds has also been a vocal supporter of Flip professional skateboarder Tom Penny and stated in a 2009 article, entitled \"The Church of Tom Penny\":\nThe switch flip. It’s unexplainable. That whole thing is just like the Penny package. It’s like a display. Not many people have got kickflip, frontside flip, switch frontside flip and switch flip all looking exactly the same. It wasn’t even really that common to do tricks over handrails at that point. He just killed it.\n\nIn December 2011, Reynolds was identified as the tenth most influential skateboarder of all time by \"Transworld Skateboarding\" magazine.\n\nProfessional skateboarder, friend, and teammate Braydon Szafranski has stated, \"You're a complete fucking moron if you don't think that Andrew is the best skater in the world. Every single day he does tricks that I've never seen him do, and I've known him, like, six years.\" Professional skateboarder, teammate, artist, and company owner Ed Templeton has stated: \"I don't know how he does it. I don't know how he jumps down the stuff he jumps down, year after year, and, and, still be like ... I don't know—to me, it's shocking. He's been number one for so long, that it's mind-blowing at this point.\" Emerica teammate Jerry Hsu has also expressed his admiration of Reynolds:\nHe just has, like, a really cool obsession with skating... it's like being around a little kid... as long as you are focused on skating, you can do whatever you want. You can... he is pretty nice. He does a lot of crazy shit in skating. Like, you wouldn't believe it. All he, all he eats is fruit. I don't know how he skates when he just eats fruit and salad... oh, he eats tons of vegetables. He's crazy.\n\nIn April 2013, Artist and Skateboarder Logan Yuzna made \"Skate Like Andrew Reynolds\", a music video dedicated to Reynolds influence in Skateboarding that was featured on Reynolds Skateboard company Baker Skateboards website and social media platforms.\n\nIn July 2013, professional skateboarder Paul Rodriguez included Reynolds in his \"top ten\" list of favorite professional skateboarders, explaining: \"If you ask me, nobody jumps huge stairs and gaps better than Reynolds. Nobody does it with better style, more grace, or more control ... He’s another guy with amazing style. He is everything you could ever ask in the most pristine pro skateboarder.\"\n\nReynolds' skating profile was featured in the original \"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater\" video game. He has subsequently been featured in most of the following \ngames in the series. Outside of the \"Tony Hawk's\" series, Reynolds was featured in EA's \"Skate 3\".\n\nReynolds won Thrasher Magazine's \"Skater of the Year\" award in 1998. For his video part in the 2010 skateboard video \"Stay Gold\", produced by the Emerica brand, Reynolds received \"Transworld Skateboarding\" magazine's award for \"Best Video Part\" in 2011.\n\nAs of October 2012, Reynolds has not drunk or taken drugs for ten years following a period of problematic illicit and licit drug use in his early twenties. He also stopped smoking cigarettes after his daughter was born.\n\nIn response to the question \"What in particular triggered you going sober?\" in a 2011 interview, Reynolds replied:\nCocaine - just messing with hard drugs and not being able to stop. My drinking was way out of control; I couldn't drink one beer without ending up blacking out and doing drugs. It would happen over and over again. Probably from like seventeen years old to twenty-four, I just didn't know how to control my intake of drugs or alcohol. It just happens to certain people. You are either that way or you aren't that way, you know? I smoked weed like my life depended on it. Then one day, I woke up and I knew it was a problem. The hard stuff - I knew I shouldn't be messing with it.\n\nHe has expressed that his inspiration is his family. In a September 2014 interview, Reynolds expressed concern over the influence that the recorded behavior of \"Baker, Pissdrunx and our whole crowd\" might have exerted upon young viewers and fans. Reynolds explained that he'd \"like to try and repair that\" as much as possible and added: \"I feel like that’s a good job for me.\"\n\nIn 2008, Reynolds resided in Hollywood, California with his daughter, Stella who is as of 2019 a budding amateur skateboarder. However, in 2012, a report stated that Reynolds had undergone a divorce and subsequently sold the Hollywood house, as well as his Cadillac, in a process of simplification. In response to the life changes that Reynolds has undergone in his older years, Regan has stated, \"That’s how he simplifies things down. If you want what he’s got, do what he does.\"\n\nIn a 2012 interview, Reynolds revealed the origin of his nickname \"The Boss\":\nIt's just a nickname that [professional skateboarder] Jim Greco came up with. I guess growing up watching mob movies and mob documentaries, there's always like has to be a boss. I had a Cadillac, it was just little stuff. I had an apartment; Jim was like, \"He's the Boss\". That's it. And then he just kind of stuck with it after that. I don't take part in it. I don't go around [saying] \"I'm the Boss\", you know? I don't care, whatever.\n\nReynolds has been involved with film projects on a minor level. He starred in the short film \"Shadows\" (2000) and the feature film \"Cop and 1/2\" (1993), appearing as \"The Skateboard Kid\" in the latter. He was also a stunt performer in the documentary \"Collage\" (2001).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2028679", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2028679", "title": "Hy Peskin", "text": "Hy Peskin\n\nHyman \"Hy\" Peskin (November 5, 1915 – June 2, 2005) was an American photographer known for several famous photographs of American sports people and celebrities published by \"Sports Illustrated\" and \"Life\". He was a pioneer of sports photography, with his work being ranked amongst the best sports photojournalism of the 20th century. In 1966 he changed his name to Brian Blaine Reynolds, and founded the Academy of Achievement, bringing young people together with statesmen and Nobel Prize winners.\n\nPeskin was born to Russian Jewish immigrant parents in Brooklyn, where his father Elias Peskowitz was a tailor who lost his job in the Depression, the family being saved by Hy's first job as a newspaper seller.\n\nPeskin became a newspaper journalist at the \"New York Daily Mirror\" after it started up in 1924, but soon became a photographer because it paid a higher salary.\n\nSports photographers would work from the press box, limiting the pictures they could take. Peskin was the first sports photographer to cover the action from the sideline or climb up on the roof to obtain more interesting shots. In his early days, he was known for the photographs he took of the Brooklyn Dodgers from Ebbets Field. Peskin often said \"I helped make the Dodgers famous and they helped make me\".\n\nAfter serving in the Marines during World War II, he wanted to start work as a magazine photographer using color. He applied for positions with 20 magazines but only \"Look\" showed any interest. It offered him a job after showing the photo editor pictures of a boxing match he had taken showing the blood on one boxer's face.\n\nPeskin was the first staff photographer hired by \"Sports Illustrated\". \"The number of famous pictures that he made here is astonishing,\" Steve Fine, the director of photography at Sports Illustrated told The New York Times. His picture of Ben Hogan playing a 1-iron shot to the green at the 72nd hole of the 1950 US Open was ranked by \"Sports Illustrated\" as one of the greatest sports photographs of the twentieth century. \"Instead of following every other shooter to the green, Hy hung back and took his shot from behind Hogan,\" recalled longtime \"Sports Illustrated\" photographer Neil Leifer in an essay in the magazine. \"You don't even see Hogan's face, yet it's all there: that perfect swing, his signature cap, the crowd. It's one of the most iconic sports photos ever taken, and Hy got it on one of the most important swings of Hogan's career. That was Hy: always defining an epic moment with an epic picture.\n\nAnother of Peskin's photographs is said to have inspired the set design for the film \"Rocky\": boxer Carmen Basilio leaping into the arms of his cornermen after knocking out Tony DeMarco in their 1955 welterweight title fight. The black-and-white image walked \"the line between reportage and film noir,\" according to \"Sports Illustrated\".\n\nIn 1953, Peskin shot a \"Life\" cover and photographic feature of Senator John F. Kennedy and his fiancé Jacqueline Bouvier. These photos helped to promote Kennedy as a national figure and were Peskin's personal favorites.\n\nDuring his career as a sports photographer, Peskin had 40 of his photographs appear on the front cover of \"Sports Illustrated\". He finished his career on an unfortunate note when technical problems meant that he virtually took no photographs at the first title fight between Muhammad Ali and Sonny Liston in early 1964.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Peskin became interested in other ventures and helped organize the World Series of Sports Fishing with Ted Williams. That year, he also launched the first gathering of what became the Academy of Achievement, a non-profit organization that brings leaders from various fields together with \"young achievers\" to inspire them to succeed. Under Peskin's leadership, the Academy attracted such prominent people as Elizabeth Taylor, Elie Wiesel, Linus Pauling, Johnny Cash and Willie Mays, among dozens of others—to receive awards and talk with top high school students. The Academy of Achievement is now run by his son, Wayne Reynolds.\n\nBy 1964, believing his Jewish name to be a liability in fundraising, Peskin legally became known as Brian Blaine Reynolds—using the middle names of his three sons.\n\nIn later years, Peskin lived in California and Plano, Texas. His first wife, Blanche, died in 1978. Peskin became known as such a litigious person, usually representing himself in court, that in 1995 a Texas television station did a story about his frequent court cases. He served time in a Texas jail for contempt of court.\n\nPeskin died in Herzliyya, Israel in 2005 of technical errors occurring during kidney dialysis. He was survived by his second wife, Adriana Reynolds of Plano, Tex., and Herzliya, Israel; two sons from that marriage, Brian Jeremy Reynolds and Preston Blaine Reynolds, both of Herzliya and Plano; three sons from his first marriage, Evan Reynolds of McKinney, Tex., Ron Reynolds of San Marcos, Calif., and Wayne Reynolds of McLean, Va.; and a granddaughter.\n\n"}

{"id": "2028684", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2028684", "title": "Behula", "text": "Behula\n\nBehula is the protagonist in the Shiva Purana and the Manasamangal genre of Bengali medieval epics. A number of works belonging to this genre were written between the thirteenth and eighteenth centuries. Though the religious purpose of these works is to eulogise the Hindu goddess Manasa, these works are more well known for depicting the love story of Behula and her husband Lakhindar (or Lakshindar or Lakshmindara).\n\nUsha (or Usa), the daughter of Banasura, fell in love with Aniruddha the son of Pradyumna. Aniruddha was a grandson of lord Krishna. After their marriage they were reborn again as Behula and Lakshindar in next life and married each other again.\n\nBehula was the daughter-in law of Chand Sadagar of Champaknagar. According to myth, two beautiful \"apsara's\" of the kingdom of heaven, Usha and Aniruddha were cursed by Gods as per the plan of Goddess Manasa and sent to earth as Behula and Lakshinder - Behula as the only daughter of Say bene (or Sayven of Ujaninagar) and Lakshinder as the seventh son of Chand Sadagar.\n\nChand sadagar was a great devotee of Shiva and for certain reasons he hated Manasa. But Manasa had to get \"Anjali\" by Chand sadagar's right hand- the Bhaktasreshto to get position of Goddess in the heaven. However, Chand sadagar promised to himself that he will never give Anjali to Manasa by the hand he uses to give anjali to Shiva. To get an anjali from Chand, Manasa took away his six sons. They died from poisonous snake bites and Manasa had absolute power over all snakes. These deaths infuriated Chand Sadagar even more and he vowed to save his last son, Lakhinder, in any way possible. Chand found a girl, Behula, whose destiny spoke that she will never be a widow. Chand got his seventh son, Lakshinder married with Behula. Chand also had an iron palace built without any hole so that not a single snake could enter the house.\n\nBishyakarma made it for the wedding night of Behula and Lakshinder. But due to the request of Manasa, Bishyakarma kept a hole in the palace. The night came and Manasa sent her Kalnagini, the most poisonous snake, to the iron palace and it crept into the room. Behula fell asleep due to a spell Manasa cast on her. When Kalnagini was going to bite Lakshinder, she saw that Behula had committed no sin for which she might be given such a harsh punishment. So kalnagini, with the help of the lower end of her body smeared the parting of Behula's hair with the oil of the lamp, which was a sin according to the Hindu mythology. After she bit Lakshinder, Lakshinder shouted aloud. Behula woke up and saw kalnagini slithering out of the room. In anger, she threw the jaanti towards kalnagini and the lower part of the snake's body was cut off. Kalnagini was not eager to bite Lakshinder; Manasa forced her to do so.\n\nTo get back her husband's life from the Gods in the heavens, Behula sailed with her dead husband in a raft towards Heaven. She faced many dangers during her incredibly long and difficult journey in the rivers. After reaching Heaven, she pleased all the Gods with her beautiful and enchanting dancing and got the Gods to promise to give back her husband's life on the condition that Chand would give anjali to Manasa. Desperate to save his son's life, finally Chand gave in and gave the anjali by the left hand. Consequentlty Manasa got the position of Goddess in heaven and gave back the life of all the six sons of Chand.\n\nHaving returned to Champak Nagar, Chand Sadagar managed to rebuild his life. A son was born to him. They named the boy Lakshmindara. At around the same time Saha's wife gave birth to a daughter, whom they named Behula. Both the children grew up together and were a perfect made-for-each-other, but when their horoscopes were tallied, it was predicted that Lakshmindara would die of snake-bite on the wedding night. However, as both the children were already devotees of Manasa and were so well matched that the marriage went through. Chand Sadagar took extra precaution in building a new bridal chamber that snakes could not penetrate.\n\nIn spite of all the precautions, Manasa had her way. One of the snakes, sent by her, killed Lakshmindara. It was the custom that anyone who died of snake-bite was not cremated in the usual way but was allowed to float on a raft down the river, with the hope that the person could miraculously come back to life. Behula insisted on accompanying her dead husband on the raft ignoring all the pleas of others not to do so. They sailed for six months, passing village after village, the corpse began to decompose, the villagers thought of her as a mad person. She kept on praying to Manasa. All that the latter did was to protect the raft from sinking.\n\nThe raft arrived at the place where Neta, Manasa's foster mother stayed. She worked as a washer woman and was on the river bank when the raft touched land. Hearing Behula's perpetual prayers to Manasa, she decided to take her to Manasa. Using her supernatural powers, Neta whisked Behula and the dead Lakshmindara to heaven. Manasa said, \"You deserve to have him back, but this can only be done if you promise to convert your father-in-law to my worship.\"\n\n“I will,” said Behula, and immediately life started to stir the corpse of her dead husband. His decayed flesh healed, he opened his eyes. He smiled at Behula.\n\nWith Neta as their guide they returned to earth. Behula met her mother-in-law and narrated all that happened. She went and told Chand Sadagar about it. He could not say no to worshipping Manasa.\n\nBehula continues to fascinate the Bengali mind, both in Bangladesh and West Bengal. She is often seen as the archetypal Bengali woman, full of love and courage. This image of Behula is reflected in one of the poems of Jibanananda Das. Behula is regarded as the epitome of a loving and loyal wife in the Bengali culture.\n"}

{"id": "2028687", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2028687", "title": "Rowan of Rin (series)", "text": "Rowan of Rin (series)\n\nThe Rowan of Rin series is a series of five children's fantasy novels by Australian author Emily Rodda. The series follow the adventures of a shy village boy, Rowan. When Scholastic released Emily Rodda's \"Star of Deltora\" fantasy series, the \"Rowan of Rin\" series was revealed to be part of the world of Deltora, and the lands mentioned in the books are islands located to the west of Deltora.\n\nThe \"Rowan\" stories take place in a fictional world, and each book always begin in the small village of Rin, an isolated valley that rests at the foot of the forbidden Mountain. West of the Mountain is an unnavigable wasteland, and east of Rin lies a river that runs into the sea. On the coast is the larger, more populous city of Maris, home to the fish-like Maris people. It is stated in \"Rowan and the Zebak\" that Maris is the only point on the coast where ships can land safely, as north and south of Maris the coast is lined by hazardous rocks and steep cliffs. Across the sea, to the east, lies the Land of the Zebak; the Zebak territory is a desert, its city reunited in steel walls and protected from land threats by the desolate, hazard-ridden Wastelands.\n\nThe series is set in the village of Rin, which is found within a valley on an island known as Maris, which lies across the Silver Sea to the west of Deltora.\nLong before the time of humans, the bukshah traveled up the Mountain every winter to feast on a grey fungus produced by the ice creepers. The bukshah were sustained for the winter, and the heat from the river of molten gold at Mountain Heart radiated into the ice creepers' cavern, maintaining a balance that controlled the population of the ice creepers and subdued the elemental rage in Mountain Heart. The valley behind the Mountain was eventually settled, and named the Valley of Gold. The people of this Valley learned the secrets of Mountain Heart, and deliberately prevented the bukshah from traveling up there; the fungus, uneaten, caused the river to flow with greater pressure, giving the people of the Valley more gold and riches. However, this also made the ice creepers more populous, causing the first Cold Time. The people eventually allowed the Bukshah to climb the mountain again, and the balance was restored - but they never told their Traveler friends the Mountain's secret. Many years later, the people of the Valley of Gold discovered the mountain berries, but that winter, before the berries completed their life-cycle, the Zebak took a foothold in Maris and messengers were sent to the Valley asking for reinforcements. The people of the Valley left for the coast, but the keeper of the bukshah remained with the keeper of the silks, and soon one warrior returned - the people of the Valley had been captured by the Zebak before they'd even reached the coast. When the Bukshah left the Valley for Mountain Heart, the three companions followed them, hiding in the cave after the beasts had left. As the snow receded, the Mountain berries in the Valley spread, and overnight the abandoned Valley was overrun by the devil trees, transformed into the abhorred Pit of Unrin. The Mountain wall, undermined by the roots of the trees, collapsed, and Mountain Heart was blocked, sealing the companions inside. The people of the Valley of Gold, enslaved by the Zebak, founded the first village of Rin behind the walls of the Zebak city. Above their abandoned home, the companions lay dying and the Bukshah were kept from Mountain Heart, leaving the creepers to breed and multiply.\n\nHundreds of years later, the Zebak took the strongest of the Rin slaves as warriors to fight against the Travelers and the Maris-folk. The cunning works of the Keeper of the Crystal of Maris led to the Rin slaves turning against their Zebak masters, defeating the invaders. The Rin people then headed west and settled at the foot of the Mountain. Minds wiped by the Zebak, they remained unaware that half of their kinsmen were still enslaved across the sea, keeping their sad history recorded on silk paintings, as the people of the Valley of Gold had done also.\n\nThree hundred years later, the Zebak devise a plan to invade Rin via the air, using flying creatures called grach, then taking the Travelers and Maris-folk by surprise through a land attack. Rowan of Rin travels to the Zebak city to find his sister, and returns with Norris and Shaaran as well, the last two descendants of the original Rin slaves. Shaaran brings the silks with her to the new Rin, causing the leader of the Travelers, Ogden, to suspect that the people of Rin and the people of the Valley of Gold are one and the same.\n\n\nRowan is a weak and timid boy, with a strong heart and mind but a frail, sickly body and a love for the gentle Bukshah. He is an oddity in Rin, the people of which value physical strength, chest hair and courage, and is looked down upon by all those that feel ashamed that he does not live up to his late father's reputation. He is designated the Keeper of the Bukshah, a domesticated form of cattle. However trouble strikes when the stream that flows from the top of the Mountain dries up. Without its water, their precious bukshah herds will die, and Rin will be doomed. The six strongest villagers must brave the unknown terrors of the Mountain to discover the answer to their problem. And Rowan, the unwanted seventh member of the group, must go with them.\n\nRowan and his mother must travel to the beaches where the Maris civilisation dwell all in order to choose the next Keeper of the Crystal. Rowan suspects nothing until his mother is poisoned and he must take her place, but Rowan refuses to elect the new Keeper, deciding that he needs the antidote to save his mother. He and the three candidates battling to be the next Keeper must go to find the antidote to save his mother.\n\nEverything seems to be very well and usual in the valley of Rin. But, somehow, Rowan, Perlain and Ogden all sense danger in the land. Rowan knows he must do something, but he doesn't want to disturb the wedding of Jiller, his mom, and Jonn, his step father. Unexpectedly, before the wedding ceremony ended, Annad is snatched by a flying creature known as the Zebak grach. With guilt and despair Rowan set off for his journey to rescue Annad. Accompanied by his three companions and Sheba's prophecies, Rowan must travel to the land of his ancient enemy - the Zebak. But what if the Zebak find them, and what danger is waiting for them in the land of the Zebak?\n\n(Retitled to \"Rowan and the Ice Creepers\" in North America) An endless winter has begun in the land of Rin. The Rin folk have fled to the Maris and only a few remain in the village, but Rowan must still embark on a deadly quest. He journeys up the mountain in his beloved bukshah's wake to cease the endless frost and ice, but doing so may endanger not only himself, but his loved ones as well.\n"}

He is best known for his work as principal comedian in the Gilbert & Sullivan comic operas, which he performed and recorded with the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company and other troupes.\n\nAfter army service in World War I, Green studied singing and began to perform in musical theatre. In 1922 he joined the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company playing in the chorus and in a variety of smaller roles, while understudying, and often substituting for, the company's principal comedian. Beginning in 1931, he was regularly given the roles of Major-General Stanley in \"The Pirates of Penzance\" and Robin Oakapple in \"Ruddigore\". In 1934, Green became the principal comedian, playing all the famous Gilbert and Sullivan patter roles, including Sir Joseph in \"H.M.S. Pinafore\", the Major-General in \"Pirates\", Bunthorne in \"Patience\", the Lord Chancellor in \"Iolanthe\", Ko-Ko in \"The Mikado\", Jack Point in \"The Yeomen of the Guard\" and the Duke of Plaza Toro in \"The Gondoliers\", among others.\n\nAt the beginning of World War II, Green left the D'Oyly Carte organisation and acted in other companies. In 1941, he joined the Royal Air Force, serving until 1945. He soon rejoined D'Oyly Carte and continued as the principal comedian until 1951. He then left the company again and moved to New York City, where he continued his career in Broadway musicals, plays, television, recordings and films. In 1959, his left leg was crushed in a garage elevator and had to be amputated below the knee. Greatly determined, Green was soon acting and directing again using a prosthetic limb. He continued to act and direct for the rest of his life and had film roles in \"A Lovely Way to Die\" (1968) and \"The Iceman Cometh\" (1973).\n\nGreen was born in London. His father, William Green, a singer, was his first singing teacher. He had a sister, Julia. Green was educated at Latymer Upper School. He served in the army during World War I, and was wounded in his left leg by shrapnel. After the war, he entered the Royal College of Music in 1919, studying singing with Gustave Garcia. Green was married three times, first to Ethel Beatrice Andrews, then to Joyce Mary Fentem and later to the operatic soprano Yvonne Chauveau (1922–2016). He had a daughter from the first marriage, Pamela, who married Geoffrey John Farrer Brain in 1950. His grandchildren are Joanna Elizabeth Brain (b. 1953) and Philippa Carol Brain (b. 1956).\n\nGreen's first stage appearance was in Nottingham in 1919 in the chorus of \"A Southern Maid\". After he left the Royal College in 1921, he first joined a touring company, where he played Paul Petrov in \"Sybil\" and decided that Martyn Green would be his stage name. He also appeared in the provinces in the revue \"Shuffle Along\". His first appearance in London was at the London Palladium in \"Thirty Minutes of Melody\" in September 1921.\n\nGreen joined D'Oyly Carte's \"New Company\" (its second touring company) in 1922 as a chorus member and occasional principal. His first role was Luiz in \"The Gondoliers\" the same year. In July 1923 he was made understudy to Frank Steward, the New Company's principal comic baritone. While taking on some smaller roles on a regular basis, such as Antonio in \"The Gondoliers\", the Associate and then Counsel in \"Trial by Jury\", he also had the opportunity to perform many of the patter roles, as Steward's understudy, playing the Learned Judge in \"Trial\", Sir Joseph Porter in \"H.M.S. Pinafore\", the Lord Chancellor in \"Iolanthe\", Ko-Ko in \"The Mikado\", and the Duke of Plaza-Toro in \"The Gondoliers\". In 1924, he added the roles of Mr. Cox in \"Cox and Box\" and First Citizen in \"The Yeomen of the Guard\" to his regular repertory and soon added Pish-Tush in \"The Mikado\".\n\nIn 1925, Green was promoted to the main repertory company, becoming the understudy to the long-time leading comedian Henry Lytton. There, he also regularly played the roles of Cox, the Associate, Major Murgatroyd in \"Patience\", and Luiz (and sometimes Antonio). Beginning in 1927, he added the role of the Usher in \"Trial by Jury\". On occasion, he substituted for Lytton as Major-General Stanley in \"The Pirates of Penzance\" and also filled in from time to time as Florian in \"Princess Ida\", Giuseppe in \"The Gondoliers\" and Counsel in \"Trial\". By the 1928–30 seasons, in addition to singing these smaller baritone roles, Green had a chance to fill in for Lytton from time to time in all the patter roles, including General Stanley, Bunthorne in \"Patience\", the Lord Chancellor, Ko-Ko, Robin Oakapple in \"Ruddigore\", Jack Point in \"Yeomen\" and the Duke of Plaza-Toro. He sang the part of Mr. Cox in a 1929 BBC radio broadcast.\n\nIn 1931, Lytton was injured in a car accident in which D'Oyly Carte principal contralto Bertha Lewis received fatal injuries. Green took over Lytton's nine patter roles until Lytton's return about two months later. Afterwards, two of the roles – Major-General Stanley in \"Pirates\" and Robin Oakapple in \"Ruddigore\" – were assigned to Green permanently in 1932. He also began substituting more frequently for Lytton in the role of Jack Point. In 1934, Lytton's retirement left Green as the principal comedian of the D'Oyly Carte company, playing all of the comic roles in their repertory over the next five years. Green gained enthusiastic notices for, among other things, his excellent diction and comedic stage movement, despite the World War I injury to his left knee. Green finally added John Wellington Wells in \"The Sorcerer\" to his long list of roles when the company revived that work in 1938, and he appeared in the film version of \"The Mikado\" in the role of Ko-Ko in 1939. His director in the film, Victor Schertzinger, said of Green: \"He has that special sort of comedian's quality that only Chaplin has so far developed to perfection. He can make you laugh and cry at the same moment.\"\n\nIn September 1939, at the outbreak of World War II, the British government ordered all theatres to close indefinitely. Rupert D'Oyly Carte cancelled the company's entire autumn tour and terminated the contracts of all of his performers. Green immediately arranged for an engagement with Charles B. Cochran to appear in the Noel Gay revue \"Lights Up\" at the Savoy Theatre. On Christmas Day 1939, the D'Oyly Carte resumed performing, and since Green was not available, they engaged Grahame Clifford to play Green's roles. After the Cochran review, Green appeared with other companies, including touring with Sylvia Cecil in variety halls in their act, \"Words with Music,\" which included Gilbert and Sullivan songs. He then joined the Royal Air Force, serving as an instructor and administrator from 1941 to 1945. Green returned to the company in 1946 as principal comedian for another five years. During this time, he recorded most of the patter roles in the earliest D'Oyly Carte LP recordings. For a generation of Gilbert & Sullivan fans, his performances in those recordings were considered definitive. \"Billboard\" wrote, during the company's 1948 US tour, that his performance of Jack Point \"is another triumph. ... His Jack Point is a G. and S. portrait to be cherished.\"\n\nIn 1949, soon after Bridget D'Oyly Carte inherited the company, she appointed Eleanor Evans (known in the company as \"Snookie\") as Stage Director and Director of Productions to replace Anna Bethell (Mrs. Sydney Granville). The choice of the temperamental Snookie, a former chorister with the company and wife of the company's longtime principal bass Darrell Fancourt, was a highly unpopular one and contributed to a wave of defections from the company, including Green's departure in 1951. He wrote: \nI had heard there was some possibility of [the selection of Evans] happening and ... told Miss Carte that I thought she was making a great psychological error. During Anna Bethell's regime (Mrs. Sydney Granville), there had been growing signs of discontent and suggestions of favouritism being shown to some of the members of the chorus in respect to passing over existing understudies, selections for small parts, and so on... But to appoint not only a woman who had for fifteen years worked in the chorus alongside several who were now principals, but the wife of one of the main principals, seemed to me to be a psychological error of the first magnitude. I felt that ... she would, rightly or wrongly, be accused of that very same favouritism. My views made no impression on Miss Carte, but time was to prove that I was right. Discontent grew, changes were constantly taking place, and criticism became rampant. Nor did it stop at the methods of production; it went so far as to suggest a complete lack of knowledge, evidenced ... by constant self-contradiction. There were other accusations levelled against her, of a more serious nature... [Those] in control ... apparently assumed in the first place that the performers are little more than automatons and are completely devoid of brains or the ability to think for themselves. Production is done to a plan that takes no consideration of the individual, his personality or his histrionic ability – a stereotyped plan that results in a clockwork performance devoid of spontaneity.\n\nHistorian Tony Joseph wrote: \"It was the largest single exodus of performers in D'Oyly Carte history, and that was why the sense of sadness that hovered over the season was so marked... August 1951 was the end of an era.\"\n\nAfter leaving the D'Oyly Carte company, Green appeared as George Grossmith in the film \"The Story of Gilbert and Sullivan\" (filmed in the summer of 1952, but released in 1953). He then travelled to America, together with Ella Halman and Radley Flynn, to tour in Gilbert and Sullivan operas for S. M. Chartock. He remained in America, settling in New York City, where he continued his career in musicals, plays, television, recording and films. Apart from his many appearances on Broadway in Gilbert and Sullivan roles up to 1952, his Broadway appearances in the 1950s include Chang in \"Shangri-La\" (1956), Lionel Croy in \"Child of Fortune\" (1956), and Kreton in \"A Visit to a Small Planet\", by Gore Vidal (1957–58). In 1954, he appeared with Ginger Rogers in a \"Producers' Showcase\" television presentation of \"Red Peppers\" and two other plays from \"Tonight at 8.30\", directed by Otto Preminger. He also played in a number of TV musicals, such as \"The Stingiest Man in Town\" as Bob Cratchit (1956).\n\nIn 1959, Green's left leg was crushed in a garage elevator and had to be amputated below the knee. An ambulance intern from India, Dr. P. Shamsuddin, borrowed a pocket knife from a police officer to perform the operation without anaesthesia. Green sued the garage company, but the case was dismissed. According to \"Time Magazine\", he was operating the elevator himself because he didn't trust the garage attendants to park his M.G. sports car. Eight months later, using a prosthetic limb, he appeared as W. S. Gilbert in the musical \"Knights of Song\" in St. Louis. In 1960 he directed Groucho Marx, Helen Traubel, Stanley Holloway and Robert Rounseville in a Bell Telephone Hour television condensed production of \"The Mikado\". He also continued to perform on Broadway, as Colonel Melkett in \"Black Comedy\" (1967), Justinus (the innkeeper) and Chaucer in \"Canterbury Tales\" (1969), Colonel Sir Francis Chesney in \"Charley's Aunt\" (1970), and Col. Elbourne in \"The Incomparable Max\" (1971). He also worked in summer stock during the rest of his life.\n\nGreen also continued frequently to direct and produce Gilbert and Sullivan productions, and worked with various touring companies and in summer stock. His film roles included Finchley in \"A Lovely Way to Die\" (1968), and the Captain in \"The Iceman Cometh\" (1973). Green last appeared on stage in Chicago (December 1974) in Edward Bond's play, \"The Sea\". His final performance in any medium was in The National Radio Theater's 1974 production of \"Mathry Beacon\" by Giles Cooper. After this, he returned to his Hollywood home (where he had lived since 1973) and was soon hospitalised.\n\nGreen died of a blood infection on 8 February 1975 at the age of 75.\n\nIn addition to his D'Oyly Carte recordings, Green made four additional Gilbert and Sullivan recordings: \"Martyn Green's Gilbert & Sullivan\" (Columbia, 1953), \"The Mikado\" (Allegro-Royale, 1954), \"Martyn Green Sings the Gilbert & Sullivan Song Book\" (MGM, 1962), and \"The Pirates of Penzance\" (RCA-Victor, 1966). He appeared on the 1956 soundtrack recording of \"The Stingiest Man in Town\" and the 1969 cast album of \"Canterbury Tales\". He did work for radio and television in America including an adaptation of the Major-General's Song for Campbell's Soup. In 1956, Green recorded selections from \"A Treasury of Ribaldry\" (edited by Louis Untermeyer, published by Hanover House). He also recorded songs and stories for children, for example, with Julie Andrews (and music by Moondog) in 1957, \"Songs of Sense & Nonsense – Tell It Again\", and a recording called \"Arabian Nights' Entertainment\".\n\nGreen wrote two books: an autobiography, \"Here's a How-de-do\" in 1952, and an annotated songbook, \"Martyn Green's Treasury of Gilbert & Sullivan\" (New York, Simon & Schuster) in 1961. There are two editions of \"Here's a How-de-do\". The American edition (New York, W. W. Norton & Co., 275 pp.) is somewhat more candid and expansive in dealing with D'Oyly Carte personalities and situations than its British counterpart (London, Max Reinhardt, 210 pp.). He also wrote an introduction to Leslie Ayre's 1972 \"The Gilbert & Sullivan Companion\", in which he commented wryly that the Gilbert and Sullivan operas \"have been translated into many languages, including American and Australian...\"\n\nGreen's papers are housed at the Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center in the Mugar Memorial Library at Boston University.\n\n\n\n"}

Fairlight is also the name of the civil parish forming part of the Rother district which includes the villages of Fairlight and Fairlight Cove.\nThe village of Fairlight lies on a minor road between Ore, Pett and Winchelsea. St Andrew's Church (built 1845) has a tall tower and beacon turret, and can be seen for some distance around. The church is one of three in the United Benefice of Fairlight, Guestling and Pett. Richard D'Oyly Carte, founder of the Savoy Theatre, Savoy Hotel, and D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, which produced the Gilbert and Sullivan light operas, is buried in the churchyard. So also are Thomas Attwood Walmisley, and Sir James Roberts of Saltaire and his wife.\n\n\"Fairlight Cove\", the neighbouring settlement and part of the parish, suffered from coastal erosion and landslip at Rockmead Road and Sea Road. A number of houses there are very close to the sea edge, and properties on those roads suffered through demolition and abandonment of a number of properties. The Fairlight Preservation Trust - a registered charity was set up with a view to combating the loss by erosion and more generally to enhance and protect the village. Sea defences were built in the 90s at Sea Road and at Rockmead Road in 2007. The 2007 works are intended to be effective for 50 years from 2007, and are regularly monitored by Rother District Council and by the Trust.\n\nAlthough the nearest railway station is Three Oaks, Hastings offers a much better service and can be reached by bus from Fairlight. Rye station is also accessible by bus from Fairlight.\n\nHastings Country Park stretches from Hastings to \"Cliff End\", where it gives access to the beach. This is a favoured spot for fossil-hunters; the \"Hastings Beds\" are part of the Early Cretaceous Wealden Group, aged 140–136 million years.\nThe park also gives access to the beach at Fairlight Glen.\n\nThe highest point in Hastings, now named North's Seat, is at the top of Fairlight Down in Hastings Country Park. It is named after Frederick North (MP) who represented the town. There used to be a windmill at this location, near which General William Roy erected a 32-foot temporary tower for vital cross-channel observations as part of the Anglo-French Survey (1784–1790), which used trigonometric measurements to link the Royal Greenwich Observatory with the Paris Observatory.\n\nThe country park is part of the larger Site of Special Scientific Interest called Hastings Cliffs to Pett Beach which extends into neighbouring parishes.

Kinney also founded the short-lived supergroup Spys4Darwin, and has collaborated with Johnny Cash, Metallica, and played drums for his Alice in Chains bandmate Jerry Cantrell's first solo album, \"Boggy Depot\" (1998). In September 2018, Kinney was a guest drummer on NBC's \"Late Night with Seth Meyers\".\n\nSean Howard Kinney was born in Renton, Washington on May 27, 1966. His father was a police officer and his mother was a city official.\n\nKinney's interest in music was developed at an early age. He got his first drum kit when he was 5 years old. By the age of 9, he was the drummer for his grandfather's band, \"The Cross Cats\", and was traveling the Northwest playing small venues. Kinney grew up in Renton, where he attended Liberty Senior High School in the Issaquah School District.\n\nKinney met singer Layne Staley around 1985, when Staley's band Sleze was playing at Alki Beach. Kinney revealed to \"Guitar Legends\" magazine that in their first meeting he told Staley that he was cool but his band sucked, and that he should get a different drummer, so Kinney suggested himself. Kinney did not have a phone at the time, so he gave Staley a piece of paper with his girlfriend's number.\n\nKinney met up with Alice in Chains in 1987, when guitarist Jerry Cantrell wanted to form a new band after his band Diamond Lie broke up, so his roommate Layne Staley gave him the phone number of Kinney's girlfriend, Melinda Starr, so that Cantrell could talk to Kinney and set up a meeting. Kinney and his girlfriend went to the Music Bank in Seattle where Cantrell was living and listened to his demos. Cantrell mentioned that they needed a bass player to jam with them, and he already had someone in mind: Mike Starr, with whom Cantrell had played in a band in Burien called Gypsy Rose. Kinney then mentioned that his girlfriend was actually Starr's sister, and that he had been playing in bands together with Starr since they were kids. Kinney called Starr and a few days later he started jamming with him and Cantrell at the Music Bank, but they didn't have a singer. Cantrell, Starr and Kinney wanted Staley to be their lead singer, so they started auditioning terrible lead singers in front of Staley to send a hint. The last straw for Staley was when they auditioned a male stripper – he decided to join the band after that. Starr was replaced by former Ozzy Osbourne bassist Mike Inez in 1993.\n\nKinney almost didn't play on Alice in Chains' debut album, Facelift. He had broken his hand and the band started rehearsing with Greg Gilmore, the drummer from Mother Love Bone. Kinney explained in the 2009 book \"Grunge is Dead\":\nSince the band's inception, Kinney has been the only drummer. He also played piano and sang chorus vocals through a megaphone on the hidden song from \"Sap\" entitled \"Love Song\". The album was named after a dream Kinney had about the band recording some light acoustic songs for an album they name Sap, because it's \"sappy.\".\n\nKinney was featured in the 1992 movie \"Singles\", along with the other members of Alice in Chains performing the songs \"It Ain't Like That\" and \"Would?\".\n\nIn 1996, Kinney joined singer Johnny Cash, guitarist Kim Thayil of Soundgarden, and bassist Krist Novoselic of Nirvana for a cover of Willie Nelson's \"Time of the Preacher\", featured on the tribute album \"Twisted Willie\", which also had Kinney playing drums for Jerry Cantrell's cover of \"I've Seen All This World I Care to See\". In the same year, Kinney played drums for Cantrell's first original solo song, \"Leave Me Alone\", featured on the soundtrack of the 1996 film \"The Cable Guy\".\n\nIn 1998, Kinney played drums for Cantrell's first solo album, \"Boggy Depot\", and percussion in the song \"Tuesday's Gone\", a cover of Lynyrd Skynyrd released on Metallica's 1998 album \"Garage Inc.\", also featuring Cantrell on guitar.\n\nAfter they toured as part of Cantrell's solo band in 1998, Kinney and Queensrÿche guitarist Chris DeGarmo formed a new band called Spys4Darwin in 1999. Alice in Chains' bassist Mike Inez and Sponge lead vocalist Vin Dombroski joined the band soon after. The band released their first and only album on May 18, 2001, a 6-track EP entitled \"Microfish\", and made their live debut at Endfest in Seattle on August 4, 2001.\n\nSince 2009, Kinney co-owns the club The Crocodile in Seattle along with Alice in Chains' manager Susan Silver, Capitol Hill Block Party co-founder Marcus Charles, Peggy Curtis, and Portugal. The Man guitarist Eric Howk. In 2013, Rolling Stone named The Crocodile as one of the best clubs in America, ranked at #7.\n\nSoundgarden lead vocalist Chris Cornell personally asked Kinney to join him, Pearl Jam guitarist Mike McCready, Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron, Screaming Trees drummer Barrett Martin and Guns N' Roses bassist Duff McKagan in the tribute show to the band Mad Season at Seattle's Benaroya Hall on January 30, 2015. Kinney played bongo for the song \"All Alone\" while a track with Layne Staley's original vocals were played. The performance was released as a live album in August 2015, entitled \"Mad Season / Seattle Symphony: Sonic Evolution / January 30, 2015 / Benaroya Hall\".\n\nFrom September 17 to September 20, 2018, Kinney was a guest drummer on NBC's \"Late Night with Seth Meyers\".\n\nAlice in Chains was inactive from 1996 onwards due to Layne Staley's drug issues, which resulted in his death in April 2002. In 2005, Kinney came up with the idea of reuniting with the other two surviving members of Alice in Chains, Jerry Cantrell and Mike Inez, to perform at a benefit concert for the victims of the tsunami disaster that struck South Asia in 2004. Kinney made calls to his former bandmates, as well as friends in the music community, such as former Alice in Chains manager Susan Silver. Kinney was surprised by the enthusiastic response to his idea, and the band performed for the first time in 10 years at the \"K-Rock Tsunami Continued Care Relief Concert\" in Seattle on February 18, 2006, featuring guest vocalists singing Staley's parts.\n\nOn March 6, 2006, the band performed together again at VH1's Decades Rock Live concert, honoring fellow Seattle musicians Ann Wilson and Nancy Wilson of Heart. That night they played \"Rooster\" with Comes with the Fall vocalist William DuVall and Ann Wilson. DuVall joined Alice in Chains as lead singer shortly thereafter. The band has toured extensively worldwide since then.\n\nThe album \"Black Gives Way to Blue\", the first without Staley, was released on September 29, 2009 featuring DuVall as the new vocalist. The album was totally funded by Kinney and Cantrell, as the band did not have a record label at the time. Their fifth studio album, \"The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here\", was released on May 28, 2013.\n\nIn 2013, Kinney added the initials \"LSMS\" on his drum kit, a tribute to Alice in Chains' late members Layne Staley and Mike Starr.\n\nAlice in Chains' sixth studio album (and the third with DuVall), \"Rainier Fog\", was released on August 24, 2018.\n\nKinney plays a large role in the presentation of the band, having helped design artwork, T-shirts and stage setups for most of the band's albums and tours.\n\nIn 1995, Alice in Chains was contemplating making a third studio album. When it was official, Kinney drew out artwork for the cover and liner notes. The cover features a three-legged dog, reason being, according to band lore, there was a three-legged dog named Tripod that used to terrorize Kinney and chase him around during his paper-work duty when he was a kid. The music video for the album's first single, \"Grind\", shows a three legged dog (similar to the one that allegedly used to chase Kinney) walking up a stairway with an elderly man.\n\nThe cover art of \"Black Gives Way to Blue\" (2009), an illustration of a heart surrounded by a black background, was Kinney's basic concept.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The body is mostly green, with a blue head and neck, and red undertail coverts. It is a resident in tropical and subtropical South America and southern Central America, from Costa Rica, Venezuela and Trinidad south to Bolivia and Brazil.\n\nIts habitat is forest and semi-open country, including cultivated areas. It is largely restricted to humid or semi-humid regions, but locally extends into drier habitats, at least along rivers. The blue-headed parrot lays three to five white eggs in a tree cavity.\n\nBlue-headed parrots are noisy birds and make light, high-pitched squeaking \"sweenk\" calls. They eat fruit and seeds, and sometimes grain. They roost communally in palm and other trees, and large numbers can be seen at the roost sites at dawn and dusk.\n\nBlue-headed pionus parrots are popular as pets. Compared to other parrot species (Amazons for example) they are very quiet. They are affectionate, but not known for their talking ability.\n\nThe blue-headed parrot is about long and weighs 245 g. It is mainly green with a blue head, neck and upper breast, red undertail coverts, and some yellowish on the wing coverts. The upper mandible is black with reddish areas on both sides. They have dark ear patches. In addition to the well-known nominate subspecies found throughout most of the species' South American range, there are two more localized subspecies: \"rubrigularis\" from southern Central America and the Chocó has an overall paler plumage and typically a relatively distinct pinkish patch on the throat, and \"reichenowi\" from the Atlantic Forest in east Brazil has a paler bill and most of the underparts blue. In all subspecies the male and the female are alike, and juvenile birds have less blue on the head, as well as red or pinkish feathers around the ceres. They moult into their adult plumage at about 8 months of age, but it can take up to two years for the full blue hood to emerge.\n\nIn South America, the blue-headed parrot is mainly an Amazonian species, including in the southeast the neighboring Araguaia-Tocantins River system as its eastern limit; a disjunct population lives southeastwards on Brazil's South Atlantic coast, a coastal strip from Pernambuco in the north to Espírito Santo state in the south, about 1500 km long. In northwest South America the range continues into Central American Panama to Costa Rica. It avoids the northern Andes cordillera spine, and a smaller contiguous area of central Venezuela and northern Colombia. A Pacific Ocean coastal strip continues the range, from southern Ecuador, north to Caribbean areas of northwestern Colombia and western Venezuela.\n\nThey eat fruit and seeds, and sometimes grain.\n\nThe blue-headed parrot nests in tree cavities. The eggs are white and there are usually three to five in a clutch. The female incubates the eggs for about 26 days and the chicks leave the nest about 70 days after hatching.\n\n\n"}

(19 October 1926 – 12 July 2008) was a Canadian lawyer, politician and judge. Born in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Murphy was the eldest son of Charlie and Monica Murphy. He attended Holy Angels Catholic School and Sault Collegiate Institute (Class of 1943), and entered St. Peter's Seminary in London, Ontario. However, a year later he transferred to Assumption College at the University of Western Ontario, from which he graduated at the age of 19 with a BA (Hon) in philosophy. From there he went to Osgoode Hall Law School.\n\n\"I had no inclination to work with figures, so that ruled out maths and sciences - - it only left teaching and the law - - I chose the latter.\"\n\nAmong his activities at some point during his time in Toronto, Murphy visited regularly with a friendly University of Toronto English professor for a beer and talk in the evening at the professor's home. Over twenty years later, when Murphy contacted the professor to see if he would be willing to make a presentation to the Liberal Party Caucus, the professor remembered Murphy's visits. But Marshall McLuhan, now internationally famous, said, \"Ah, Terrence, times have changed. We can't talk for nothing any more.\" McLuhan's fee proved to be more than the Caucus was willing to pay.\n\nIn 1949, at the age of 22, Murphy became the youngest person in Ontario to be called to the Bar. He returned to Sault Ste. Marie and spent seven years in partnership with George Majic, after which he established his own practice.\n\nMurphy served a term as Alderman for the City of Sault Ste. Marie in 1965. He was elected in 1968 as a Liberal member of parliament representing the Sault Ste. Marie electoral district, at which time he joined the firm of Fitzgerald, Kelleher and Kurisko.\n\nWhile a member of parliament, Murphy served on the parliamentary justice committee. In 1970 he became the leader of the Canadian delegation representing Canada in the North Atlantic Assembly. The Assembly provided elected representatives from NATO countries with some insight into and oversight of the operation of NATO. He was named president of the North Atlantic Assembly in 1971, a position which required him to visit NATO countries and meet their ministers of defence. He also attended meetings of a group nicknamed \"the Nine Wise Men\", which had been formed to review NATO policy and organization. The group consisted of one representative from each of the NATO countries, including former Canadian Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson, and later West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt.\n\nIn October 1970, Liberal Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau proclaimed a state of \"apprehended insurrection\" under the War Measures Act in response to the kidnapping of British Trade Commissioner James Cross by Quebec separatists. Regulations under the act permitted arrest and detention without charge and banned the kidnappers' organization, the Front de libération du Québec(FLQ). Murphy objected to what he considered to be an unjustifiable suppression of civil liberties and planned to vote against the government. Trudeau met with him and advised him that, if he voted against the government, he would not only be ejected from the Liberal caucus and barred from running for the party again, but his constituency would not receive any programmes or benefits from the government during the balance of his tenure in office. Murphy did not believe that his constituents should suffer as a result of his conscientious convictions, but would not support the government on the issue. He absented himself from the House during the key vote.\n\nMurphy returned to legal practice with the firm after his defeat in the 1972 federal election by New Democratic Party candidate Cyril Symes. He ran against Symes again in the 1979 election, but was again defeated.\n\nIn 1980 he was appointed Judge for the District of Sudbury/Manitoulin, becoming a judge of the Superior Court of Justice when the superior courts of the province were re-structured. He retired from the bench in 2000. Five years later, Murphy was formally acknowledged by the Advocates’ Society in the book \"Learned Friends\" as one of fifty of the finest advocates practising in Ontario from 1950 to 2000, who exemplified the very highest standards of advocacy and shaped the legal profession in the province.\n\n"}

The US version does not contain the final track, \"The Garden\".\n\nBy the mid-1990s, the CD reissues of Donovan's 1960s albums and the \"\" boxed set reacquainted his fans with his music. These releases also introduced him to newer generations, which helped rebuild his fan base.\n\nIn 1993, producer and American Recordings founder Rick Rubin contacted Johnny Cash to record a set of songs featuring Cash with sparse instrumentation. Cash's \"American Recordings\" succeeded both critically and commercially, and signaled a fresh start in his career. This success prompted Rubin to search for other artists who would benefit from the same model. While in the studio with Tom Petty, Rubin mentioned that he would like to work with Donovan. Petty suggested that he call Donovan, which he did.\n\nDonovan agreed to have Rubin produce his next album, and prepared over one hundred songs for the recording sessions. The sessions were to feature sparse instrumentation, much like the sessions that made Cash's \"American Recordings\" such a success. Rubin insisted that Donovan listen to the folk material that Donovan recorded for Pye Records in 1964 and '65 for inspiration. The recording sessions commenced in 1995 with mixing of the song \"El Dorado\" in Los Angeles by Sylvia Massy. The deeply meditative \"Sutras\" was released late the following year.\n\n\"Sutras\" received mixed reviews and failed to achieve the kind of commercial success Cash's \"American Recordings\" had. Donovan did not receive a longer contract, and \"Sutras\" became his only collaboration with Rubin; it is now out of print in the US. Yet for all its lack of commercial success, \"Sutras\" galvanized Donovan's fan base by reestablishing him as a current artist releasing new material. The internet in particular served a vital role in uniting his fans after the release of \"Sutras\". Donovan paid close attention to this movement, and spent the next five years reorganizing his business around the internet to better reach his fans. \"Sutras\" can be seen as one of his most coherent solo efforts, since his creative period shortly after learning Transcendental Meditation and the period he spent in India with The Beatles (1967–71).\n\nAll tracks by Donovan Leitch, except where noted. The US version of \"Sutras\" retained the same track sequence, but deleted the last song on the album (\"The Garden\"), making it a fourteen-track album.\n\n\ncredits from allmusic.com\n\n"}

Winch is perhaps most famous for his early book, \"The Idea of a Social Science and its Relation to Philosophy\" (1958), an attack on positivism in the social sciences, drawing on the work of R. G. Collingwood and Ludwig Wittgenstein's later philosophy.\n\nWinch was born on 14 January 1926, in Walthamstow, London. He attended Leyton County High School for boys, before going up St Edmund Hall, Oxford to read Philosophy, Politics and Economics. Following the outbreak of World War II, he served in the Royal Navy 1944–47, before graduating from the University of Oxford in 1949.\n\nHe was a lecturer in philosophy at the Swansea University from 1951 until 1964. He was influenced by his colleagues Rush Rhees and Roy Holland, both experts in the philosophy of Ludwig Wittgenstein. In 1964, he moved to Birkbeck College, University of London, before becoming Professor of Philosophy at King's College London in 1967. During this period, he served as president of Aristotelian Society, from 1980 to 1981. In 1985 Winch moved to the United States to become Professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.\n\nHe died on the 27 April 1997, in Champaign, Illinois.\n\nHe was survived by his wife Erika Neumann and his two sons, Christopher and David.\n\nMajor influences upon Winch include Ludwig Wittgenstein, Rush Rhees, R. G. Collingwood and Simone Weil. He gave rise to a form of philosophy that has been given the name 'sociologism'. He also bears responsibility for a small school of sociology that was prepared to accept his radical criticism of the subject.\n\nWinch saw himself as an uncompromising Wittgensteinian. He was not personally acquainted with Wittgenstein; Wittgenstein's influence upon him was mostly mediated through that of Rush Rhees, who was his colleague at the University College of Swansea, now known as Swansea University, and whom Wittgenstein appointed as one of his literary executors. Winch's translation of Wittgenstein's \"Vermischte Bemerkungen\" (as edited by Georg Henrik von Wright) was published in 1980 as \"Culture and Value\" (with a new translation by Winch of a revised edition by Alois Pichler appearing in 1998). After the death of Rhees in 1989, Winch took over his position as literary executor.\n\nFrom Rush Rhees, Winch derived his interest in the religious writer Simone Weil. Part of the appeal was a break from Wittgenstein into a very different type of philosophy which could nevertheless be tackled with familiar methods. Also Weil's ascetic, somewhat Tolstoyan, form of religion harmonised with one aspect of Wittgenstein's personality.\n\nAt a time when most Anglo-American philosophers were heavily under the spell of Wittgenstein, Winch's own approach was strikingly original. While much of his work was concerned with rescuing Wittgenstein from what he took to be misreadings, his own philosophy involved a shift of emphasis from the problems that preoccupied Oxford style ‘linguistic’ philosophy, towards justifying and explaining 'forms of life' in terms of consistent language games. He took Wittgensteinian philosophy into areas of ethics and religion, which Wittgenstein himself had relatively neglected, sometimes showing considerable originality. An example is his illuminating treatment of the moral difference between someone who tries and fails to commit murder and someone who succeeds, in his essay \"Trying\" in \"Ethics and Action\". With the decline of interest in Wittgenstein, Winch himself was increasingly neglected and the challenge his arguments presented to much contemporary philosophy was sidestepped or ignored. In insisting on the continuity of Wittgenstein's concerns from the \"Tractatus\" through to the \"Philosophical Investigations\", Winch made a powerful case for Wittgenstein's mature philosophy, as he understood it, as the consummation and legitimate heir of the entire analytic tradition.\n\nWittgenstein famously said that philosophy leaves the world as it is. Winch takes his ideas into regions that have strong moral and political implications.\n\n\nAs Translator/Editor:\n\n\nPhil Papers - works by Peter Winch.\n\n"}

It is the deepest trench of the Southern Atlantic Ocean, and the second deepest of the Atlantic Ocean after the Puerto Rico Trench. Since the trench extends south of the 60th parallel south, it also contains the deepest point in the Southern Ocean.\n\nThe deepest point in the entire trench is the Meteor Deep, whose location prior to February 2019 was identified as at a depth of . This sounding was made during the German Meteor expedition. The depth is named after the German survey ship Meteor, which first surveyed the area as part of its namesake expedition in 1926. The deepest point below the 60th parallel south, the deepest point in the Southern Ocean, is dubbed by Victor Vescovo as the Factorian Deep, a name that he hopes will become official. This point lies at a depth of , and is the only subzero Hadal zone in the world.\n\nThe trench is long and has a maximum depth of below sea level at , as measured by a Kongsberg EM124 multibeam sonar from February 2–7, 2019 during the Five Deeps Expedition. This measurement was made during the first complete sonar mapping of the trench which covered its entire length, with a measurement error of +/- . The deepest point of the South Sandwich Trench is only shallower than the deepest point in the Puerto Rico Trench, sometimes known as the Milwaukee or Brownson Deep.\n\nThe trench is produced by the subduction of the southernmost portion of the South American Plate beneath the small South Sandwich Plate. The South Sandwich Islands constitute a volcanic island arc which results from this active subduction. Mount Belinda on Montagu Island is an active volcano.\n\nIn February 2019, however, the Five Deeps Expedition, led by its survey ship , has recommended that the location of the Meteor Deep be \"relocated\" to the newly discovered, truly deepest location at and ± in depth, given the precision of the new survey. This new deepest point is part of the same subsurface feature as the previous Meteor Deep location so the expedition recommended keeping the old name.\n\n\"Pressure Drop\" completed an entire survey of the trench on February 9, 2019 and will be making the data publicly available to GEBCO in 2019. Approximately ten other major subsurface features including various deeps, seamounts, and ridges—previously unidentified—were mapped by the vessel and new names for the features will be submitted to the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) later in 2019.\n\nThe southernmost portion of the South Sandwich Trench reaches south of 60°S latitude and is therefore in the Southern Ocean. The maximum depth of that ocean is also in the South Sandwich Trench, which was surveyed by the Five Deeps Expedition in early February 2019. The expedition's sonar team identified the deepest point at , with a depth of ± . The expedition leader and chief submersible pilot Victor Vescovo has proposed naming this deepest point in the Southern Ocean the \"Factorian Deep,\" based on the name of the manned submersible DSV \"Limiting Factor\", in which he successfully visited the bottom for the first time on February 4, 2019. The deepest points of a maritime trench have historically been named after the vessel that first discovered or explored them.\n\n\n"}

On 6 February 1987 Davies was the third appointee to the Order of New Zealand.\n\nSonja Vile was born in the Upper Hutt suburb of Wallaceville in 1923. Her mother was Gwladys Ilma Vile, a nurse, and a granddaughter of Job Vile. Sonja Vile only learned of her father's identity, the Irish army major Gerald Dempsey, when she was 20, but never made any contact. She had four different foster homes before her grandparents took her in, and they lived in Oamaru and Woodville. Aged seven, she went back to her mother in Wellington to live with her younger sister and her new step-father. The family moved to Dunedin, then Auckland, and in 1939 back to Wellington; by then, she also had a younger brother. The speeches by pacifists Ormond Burton and Arch Barrington appealed to her social conscience but caused tension with her parents, and she consequently left home aged 16 supporting herself by work in bookshops.\n\nShe married Lindsay Nathan in 1941, and began training as a nurse. She became pregnant after an affair with an American marine and her daughter Penny was born in 1944. Soon afterwards, Sonja was hospitalised for tuberculosis.\n\nAfter divorcing Nathan, she married Charlie Davies in late 1946, who she had known before the war. The following year she was discharged from hospital, and the couple moved to rural Nelson. In 1953 they moved into the city, where she became politically active in a campaign to stop the closure of the railway. She was elected to the Nelson Hospital Board in 1956, and to the Nelson City Council in 1961.\n\nDavies helped to found the Working Women's Council, and in 1974 she became the first female executive of the Federation of Labour.\n\nDavies became the Labour MP for Pencarrow in 1987 and served two terms, retiring in 1993; Trevor Mallard replaced her.\n\nIn 1990, Davies received the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal, and in 1993 she was awarded the New Zealand Suffrage Centennial Medal.\n\nDavies died in Wellington in 2005.\n\nHer autobiography, \"Bread and Roses: Her Story\", (), was turned into a film in 1994. Directed by Gaylene Preston, the film was also called \"Bread and Roses\". A second volume of autobiography, \"Marching On\" () was published in 1997.\n\n"}

The Weber number is the dimensionless parameter that determines the onset of this phenomenon called the entrainment limit (Weber number greater than or equal to 1). In this case the Weber number is defined as the ratio of the momentum in the vapor layer divided by the surface tension force restraining the liquid, where the characteristic length is the surface pore size.\n\n"}

From around the middle of the 20th century, birth rates and average family sizes fell sharply, for a number of reasons including increasing costs of raising children and more women having their first child later in life. The proportion of families in the U.S. with only children increased during the Great Depression but fell during the Post–World War II baby boom. After the Korean War ended in 1953, the South Korean government suggested citizens each have one or two children to boost economic prosperity, which resulted in significantly lowered birth rates and a larger number of only children to the country.\n\nFrom 1979 to 2015, the one-child policy in the People's Republic of China restricted most parents to having only one child, although it was subject to local relaxations and individual circumstances (for instance when twins were conceived).\n\nFamilies may have an only child for a variety of reasons, including: personal preference, family planning, financial and emotional or physical health issues, desire to travel, stress in the family, educational advantages, late marriage, stability, focus, time constraints, fears over pregnancy, advanced age, illegitimate birth, infertility, divorce, and death of a sibling or parent. The premature death of one parent also contributed to a small percentage of marriages producing just one child until around the mid 20th century, not to mention the then rare occurrence of divorce. \n\nOnly children are sometimes said to be more likely to develop precocious interests (from spending more time with adults) and to feel lonely. Sometimes they compensate for the aloneness by developing a stronger relationship with themselves or developing an active fantasy life that includes imaginary friends. Children whose only siblings are much older than them sometimes report feeling like an only child. Advantages cited of having an only child are the decreased financial burden, the absence of any sibling rivalry, and that it becomes possible to take the child to an event suitable for their age without having to bring along an uninterested sibling.\n\nIn Western countries, only children can be the subject of a stereotype that equates them with \"spoiled brats\". G. Stanley Hall was one of the first commentators to give only children a bad reputation when he referred to their situation as \"a disease in itself\". Even today, only children are commonly stereotyped as \"spoiled, selfish, and bratty\". While many only children receive a lot of attention and resources for their development, it is not clear that as a class they are overindulged or differ significantly from children with siblings. Susan Newman, a social psychologist at Rutgers University and the author of \"Parenting an Only Child\", says that this is a myth. \"People articulate that only children are spoiled, they're aggressive, they're bossy, they're lonely, they're maladjusted\", she said. \"There have been hundreds and hundreds of research studies that show that only children are no different from their peers.\" However, differences have been found. Research involving teacher ratings of U.S. children's social and interpersonal skills has scored only children lower in self-control and interpersonal skills. While a later study failed to find evidence this continued through middle and high school, a further study showed that deficits persisted until at least the fifth grade.\n\nIn China, perceived behavioral problems in only children has been called the Little Emperor Syndrome and the lack of siblings has been blamed for a number of social ills such as materialism and crime. However, recent studies do not support these claims, and show no significant differences in personality between only children and children in larger families. The one child policy has also been speculated to be the underlying cause of forced abortions, female infanticide, underreporting of female births, and has been suggested as a possible cause behind China's increasing number of crimes and gender imbalance. Regardless, a 2008 survey given by the Pew Research Center reports that 76% of the Chinese population supports the policy.\n\nThe popular media often posit that it is more difficult for only children to cooperate in a conventional family environment, as they have no competitors for the attention of their parents and other relatives. It is suggested that confusion arises about the norms of ages and roles and that a similar effect exists in understanding during relationships with other peers and youth, all throughout life. Furthermore, it is suggested that many feel that their parents place extra pressure and expectations on the only child, and that often, only children are perfectionists. Only children are noted to have a tendency to mature faster.\n\nA 1987 quantitative review of 141 studies on 16 different personality traits failed to support the opinion, held by theorists including Alfred Adler, that only children are more likely to be maladjusted due to pampering. The study found no evidence of any greater prevalence of maladjustment in only children. The only statistically significant difference discovered was that only children possessed a higher achievement motivation, which Denise Polit and Toni Falbo attributed to their greater share of parental resources, expectations, and scrutiny exposing them to a greater degree of reward, and greater likelihood of punishment for falling short. A second analysis by the authors revealed that only children, children with only one sibling, and first-borns in general, score higher on tests of verbal ability than later-borns and children with multiple siblings.\n\nAccording to the Resource Dilution Model, parental resources (e.g. time to read to the child) are important in development. Because these resources are finite, children with many siblings are thought to receive fewer resources. However, the Confluence Model suggests there is an opposing effect from the benefits to the non-youngest children of tutoring younger siblings, though being tutored does not make up the reduced share of parental resources. This provides one explanation for the poorer performance on tests of ability of only children compared to first-borns, commonly seen in the literature, though explanations such as the increased and earlier likelihood of experiencing parental separation or loss for last-born and only children have also been suggested, as this may be the cause of their very status.\n\nIn his book \"Maybe One\", the environmental campaigner Bill McKibben argues in favor of a voluntary one child policy on the grounds of climate change and overpopulation. He reassures the reader with a narrative constructed from interviews with researchers and writers on only children, combined with snippets from the research literature, that this would not be harmful to child development. He argues that most cultural stereotypes are false, that there are not many differences between only children and other children, and where there are differences, they are favorable to the only child.\n\nMost research on only children has been quantitative and focused on the behaviour of only-children and on how others, for example teachers, assess that behaviour. Bernice Sorensen, in contrast, used qualitative methods in order to elicit meaning and to discover what only-children themselves understand, feel or sense about their lives that are lived without siblings. Her research showed that during their life span only children often become more aware of their only child status and are very much affected by society's stereotype of the only-child whether or not the stereotype is true or false. She argues in her book, \"Only Child Experience and Adulthood\", that growing up in a predominantly sibling society affects only children and that their lack of sibling relationships can have an important effect on both the way they see themselves and others and how they interact with the world.\n\nThe latest research by Cameron et al. (2011) controls for endogeneity associated with being only children. Parents that choose to have only one child could differ systematically in their characteristics from parents who choose to have more than one child. The paper concludes that \"those who grew up as only children as a consequence of the (one-child) policy (in China) are found to be less trusting, less trustworthy, less likely to take risks, and less competitive than if they had had siblings. They are also less optimistic, less conscientious, and more prone to neuroticism\". Furthermore, according to Professor Cameron, it was found that \"greater exposure to other children in childhood – for example, frequent interactions with cousins and/or attending childcare – was not a substitute for having siblings.\"\n\nIn his book \"Born to Rebel\", Frank Sulloway provides evidence that birth order influences the development of the \"big five personality traits\" (also known as the Five Factor Model). Sulloway suggests that firstborns and only children are more conscientious, more socially dominant, less agreeable, and less open to new ideas compared to laterborns. However, his conclusions have been challenged by other researchers, who argue that birth order effects are weak and inconsistent. In one of the largest studies conducted on the effect of birth order on the Big Five, data from a national sample of 9,664 subjects found no association between birth order and scores on the NEO PI-R personality test.\n"}

She won the LPGA major Nabisco Dinah Shore and twice finished second in the U.S. Women's Open. She also won the Women's British Open once and the Evian Masters three times before those events were designated as majors in women's golf by the LPGA Tour. In 2019, she won a \"senior slam\" by winning both of the senior women's major championships. \n\nAlfredsson was born in Gothenburg, Sweden and at age 11 began playing golf at Gullbringa Golf & Country Club north of Gothenburg. At young ages, she represented Sweden on both junior level and in the national amateur team.\n\nShe attended United States International University, San Diego, California, playing in their golf team led by coach Gordon Severson and graduated in 1988. During summer time she played in Sweden and won the Swedish Match-play Championship three years in a row 1986 through 1988.\n\nIn 1987, she was a member of the winning Swedish team at the European Ladies' Team Championship at Turnberry, Scotland. She was also a member of the Swedish team in the Espirito Santo Trophy 1986 and 1988. At home soil in Stockholm in 1988, Sweden finished second after the United States, the best Swedish finish ever. The same year Alfredsson finished individual bronze-medallist at the European Ladies' Championship at Pedrena Golf Club, Spain.\n\nShe turned professional on 1 January 1989.\nAlfredsson began her professional career on the Ladies European Tour where she was awarded 1989 Rookie of the Year. The next year, in 1990, she claimed her maiden professional win at the Women's British Open. She won twice on the LET in 1991 and won once each on the Australian and Japan tours. She earned exempt status for the 1992 LPGA Tour season by tying for 17th at the LPGA Final Qualifying Tournament.\n\nShe earned Rookie of the Year honors on the LPGA Tour in 1992 and has won seven LPGA Tour events, including one LPGA major: the 1993 Nabisco Dinah Shore. A little over three months after her Dinah Shore victory, Alfredsson nearly won the U.S. Women's Open at Crooked Stick Golf Club. Alfredsson entered the final round with a two-stroke advantage, but finished tied for 2nd, one shot behind winner Lauri Merten.\n\nAt the 1994 U.S. Women's Open at Indianwood Golf & Country Club, Michigan, Alfredsson shot an 8 under first round 63, a new tournament single round record. Her 36-hole total 132 also broke the tournament record. When she reached 13 under during the third round, it was at the time the lowest score to par ever reached in a U.S. Open, by men or women. After playing her last 29 holes in 14 over par, she fell to tied 9th, eight shots behind winner Patty Sheehan.\n\nDuring her career on the LPGA Tour, Alfredsson continued to play a limited number of events in Europe, where she won eleven times. She finished on top of the Ladies European Tour money list in 1998.\n\nIn 2008, Alfredsson came back, after recovering from injuries in her leg, back and shoulder, and won her third Evian Masters title, her first LPGA Tour win in five years.\n\nShe was member of the European Solheim Cup team as a player 8 times: 1990, 1992, 1994, 1996, 1998, 2000, 2002 and 2009. She was appointed captain of the 2007 European Solheim Cup team, losing to the United States team 12-16. When she qualified for the European Team at the 2009 Solheim Cup, she became the first, and still the only, player on both teams, to qualify as a player after she has been the team captain a previous year.\n\nWhile playing golf, Alfredsson has been known to curse long and loud in Swedish. The Financial Times of London once editorialized \"They can be louder and more richly worded than many of Lenny Bruce's best performances\". Alfredsson said about cursing \"You have to stay so focused on the tour, you work so hard, you don't want anything to interfere. But then all of a sudden this little devil comes crawling out, saying, 'It's time to do something. You've been good too long.\" \"\n\nIn September 2013, Alfredsson officially announced her retirement from the LPGA Tour.\n\nShe is a life time member of the Ladies European Tour. \n\nAfter her retirement from competitive golf on the regular tour, she came back, playing on the women's senior tour, the Legends Tour, primarily in the senior majors, with great success. She tied for third in the inaugural Senior LPGA Championship in 2017 and improved that by finishing tied second at the 2018 Senior LPGA Championship. She won both of the two senior ladies major championships in 2019, the U.S. Senior Women's Open and the Senior LPGA Championship, completing the same \"senior slam\" as Laura Davies achieved in 2018.\n\nAt young age she practiced ice skating and team handball. Her father Björn was a six-time Swedish handball champion. In later years she has practiced yoga.\n\nDuring her college years in San Diego, California, she met Leo Cuellar, the school's soccer coach and a former World Cup and Olympic soccer player for Mexico. The couple later got engaged.\n\nAfter graduating in 1988 with a degree in International Business and Marketing, she tried a career in Paris, France as a model and stayed for six months.\n\nIn 2005, Alfredsson married former National Hockey League player Kent Nilsson and became stepmother of his son, hockey player Robert Nilsson. Kent Nilsson was en elite amateur golfer himself, with a handicap below scratch. They divorced in 2016, but came back to live together.\n\nShe has contributed to the foundation of a charity golf tournament supporting research on Alzheimer's disease, which affected her mother, who died in 2010.\n\n\nLPGA Tour playoff record (1–3)\nNote: The Women's British Open was not co-sanctioned by the LPGA until 1994, and did not become an LPGA major until 2001.<br>\n^The Evian Masters has been co-sanctioned with the Ladies European Tour since 2000.\n\nSources: \n\nLadies European Tour playoff record (4–1)\n\n\n\n^ The Women's British Open replaced the du Maurier Classic as an LPGA major in 2001.<br>\n^^ The Evian Championship was added as a major in 2013.\n\nCUT = missed the half-way cut<br>\nDQ = disqualified<br>\nWD = withdrew<br>\nT = tied\n\n\nAmateur\n\nProfessional\n\n\n"}

It is the nominate species (\"F. p. passerinus\").\n\nThere are four subspecies: the Colombian green-rumped parrotlet or Rio Hacha parrotlet (\"F. p. cyanophanes\"), the Trinidad green-rumped parrotlet or Venezuelan parrotlet (\"F. p. viridissimus\"), the Roraima green-rumped parrotlet or Schlegel's parrotlet (\"F. p. cyanochlorus\"), and the Amazon green-rumped parrotlet or delicate parrotlet or Santarem passerine parrotlet (\"F. p. deliciosus\").\n\nGreen-rumped parrotlets are found in tropical South America, from Caribbean regions of Colombia, Venezuela and Trinidad south and east to the Guianas and Brazil, on the lower Amazon River. It has been introduced in Jamaica, Curaçao, Barbados and Tobago, and was not recorded on Trinidad prior to 1916. They are the only parrotlet species to occur in the Caribbean.\n\nGreen-rumped parrotlets are fairly common in open, semi-arid habitat and are found residing in dry scrubland, deciduous woodland, gallery forest, farmland, forest edges, and deforested areas throughout their range. While they are non-migratory, they may wander locally to locate sources of food. They are not found at altitudes greater than above sea level.\nThe global population size is not known, but this species has been described as widespread and common. However, there is strong evidence that populations are decreasing, which is likely related to habitat destruction by deforestation. The species has been classified as Least Concern by the IUCN Red List.\n\nGreen-rumped parrotlets are very gregarious and roost communally; they are often seen in flocks of up to 100 individuals. \n\nGreen-rumped parrotlets make light, twittering calls. While in flocks, calls are louder and more penetrating. Contact calls, similar to names, are individually distinct and are used for individual mate recognition. Each call varies in duration, frequency, and pitch.\n\nGreen-rumped parrotlets have been observed in flocks consisting of combinations of breeding male-female pairs, nonbreeding male-female pairs, male-male pairs, and individual nonbreeding males; the number of each type depends on the season. Extra-pair copulation is relatively uncommon (less than 8% of young are conceived through extra-pair fertilization).\n\nGreen-rumped parrotlets form strong pair bonds and rarely switch mates, but typically only breed with the same individual for 1-2 seasons. Almost half of wild females attempt a second brood during their breeding season. Green-rumped parrotlets breed during the rainy season (May-November), though each subspecies tends to breed during different months. They typically make their nests in unlined tree cavities, holes found in arboreal termite nests, or in cavities in wooden fence posts.\n\nThe female lays 5-6 small white eggs over a period of 9–16 days. The female usually initiates incubation after the first egg is laid, leading to asynchronous hatching which begins 18–22 days after the start of incubation. Depending on the clutch size, hatching concludes 2–14 days after the first egg hatches. Fledging occurs 29–35 days after hatching, with the clutch fledging over a period of 14 days on average.\n\nThe unusual length of the green-rumped parrotlet's nestling period is believed to be caused, or at least influenced, by the low levels of available nutrients and minerals for young found in typical green-rumped parrotlet habitat. Because of the difference in hatching time, not all chicks are the same size when they are young. Research has been done on resource allocation between different chick sizes by green-rumped parrotlet parents. It was shown that male parents tend to feed larger chicks more often, while females are far more likely to feed smaller individuals first because of their begging habits - smaller chicks tend to beg more, while larger chicks are more submissive. This effect has also been observed in other parrot species.\n\nResearch has shown that by planning asynchronous hatching, parent parrotlets don't have to spend as much time expending the high levels of energy associated with brooding, but the amount of energy expended does not change. \n\nIt has been observed that over the course of mating and raising a brood of chicks, a female green-rumped parrotlet's mass varies greatly. Female individuals gained up to 25% more mass before laying and maintained this mass through incubation until hatching began. The amount of mass lost over the brooding and fledging periods was dependent on the size of the brood. It is believed that this mass change is caused by a combination of brooding starvation, adaptation to a new lifestyle, and sexual activity.\n\nGreen-rumped parrotlets primarily eat seeds from grasses and forbs, as well as flowers, buds, berries, and fruits. They have also been observed to eat the seeds from fruit trees including \"Annona\" sp. and guava.\n\nGreen-rumped parrotlets are bred in captivity and kept as pets, though they are less common than some other \"Forpus\" species. Imports of wild green-rumped parrotlets into the United States are prohibited under the Wild Bird Conservation Act and international trade is limited by other laws, so aviculture is dependent on existing captive populations.\n\n\n"}

It is part of the Foothills Erratics Train of typically angular boulders of distinctive quartzite and pebbly quartzite.\n\nThis massive angular boulder, which is broken into two main pieces, measures about and is high. It consists of thick-bedded, micaceous, feldspathic quartzite that is light grey, pink, to purplish. Besides having been extensively fractured by frost action, it is unweathered. Big Rock lies about west of the town of Okotoks, Alberta, Canada, south of Calgary in the SE. 1/4 of Sec. 21, Township 20, Range 1, West 5th Meridian.\n\nBig Rock is a glacial erratic that is part of a long, narrow ( wide), linear scatter of thousands of distinctive quartzite and pebbly quartzite glacial erratics between and in length. This linear scatter of distinctive quartzite glacial erratics is known as the Foothills Erratics Train. The Foothills Erratics Train extends along the eastern flanks of the Rocky Mountains of Alberta and northern Montana to the International Border. The boulders and smaller gravel, which comprises the Foothills Erratics Train, consist of Lower Cambrian shallow marine quartzite and conglomeratic quartzite, which occurs only within the Gog Group and is found in the Athabasca River Valley of central western Alberta. Big Rock is the largest erratic within the Foothills Erratics Train. Lying on prairie to the east of the Rocky Mountains and like all the larger erratics, it is visible for a considerable distance across the prairie and likely served as a prominent landmark for Indigenous people.\n\nNear the end of the Pleistocene Period, between 12,000 and 17,000 years ago, a massive landslide occurred within the upper reaches of the Athabasca River valley. As a result of this landslide, millions of tonnes of beige to pinkish quartzite and quartzitic conglomerate slid from the side of a mountain and onto the top of a valley glacier within the Athabasca River valley. On its top, the narrow valley glacier carried eastward this mass of Gog Group quartzite and quartzitic conglomerate. Because it lay on and within the top of this glacier, the highly fractured boulders were neither broken up into smaller blocks nor rounded by movement of the glaciers that transported it. After leaving the Rocky Mountains, the valley glacier collided with the westward moving ice streams of the Laurentide Ice Sheet and both it, other Rocky Mountain valley glaciers, and Laurentide ice streams coalesced as ice streams and were diverted southward and parallel to the eastern flanks of the Rocky Mountains. Together they flowed as far south as northern Montana as an ice sheet before they stagnated and melted. When the ice sheet melted, erratics of Gog quartzite and quartzitic conglomerate were dropped to form the line of rocks known as the Foothills Erratics Train. Big Rock is one of these glacial erratics of Gog quartzite and quartzitic conglomerate that originated as part of a landslide in the Athabasca River valley and carried on the top of a glacier, later ice stream, to its present site.\n\nThe people of the Blackfoot First Nation used Big Rock as a landmark for finding a crossing over the Sheep River (where Okotoks stands today) long before European settlement. The town's name, Okotoks, is derived from \"\"o'kotok\"\" , meaning \"rock\" in the Blackfoot language, and may refer to the rock. The rock also contains native pictographs and was considered a medicine rock to the natives. In the 1970s the government declared it a Provincial Historic Site to protect its geological and cultural importance.\n\nJames Hector, a geologist with the Palliser Expedition, first documented the rock in 1863. He misidentified the feature as a klippe.\n\nOne interesting feature of Big Rock is the large split down the middle. A Blackfoot story describes how this may have happened:\n\nOne hot summer day, Napi, the supernatural trickster of the Blackfoot peoples, rested on the rock because the day was warm and he was tired. He spread his robe on the rock, telling the rock to keep the robe in return for letting Napi rest there. Suddenly, the weather changed and Napi became cold as the wind whistled and the rain fell. Napi asked the rock to return his robe, but the rock refused. Napi got mad and just took the clothing. As he strolled away, he heard a loud noise and turning, he saw the rock was rolling after him. Napi ran for his life. The deer, the bison and the pronghorn were Napi's friends, and they tried to stop the rock by running in front of it. The rock rolled over them. Napi's last chance was to call on the bats for help. Fortunately, they did better than their hoofed neighbours, and by diving at the rock and colliding with it, one of them finally hit the rock just right and it broke into two pieces.\n\nNot only does this story explain why the rock is in two pieces, but also why bats have squashed-looking faces. The tale provides helpful caution against taking back what you have given away.\n\nAlthough it has been claimed to be the largest glacial erratic in the world, e.g. Sterenberg (2013), Big Rock is not. For example, one large glacial erratic in Germany measures and is thick. Near Cooking Lake, Alberta, one of several large glacial erratics, which is called the \"Cooking Lake (Number 6) megablock\", covers an area of at least , has a length of and is about thick. Pollen studies indicate that the Lower Cretaceous sedimentary strata that comprise this glacial erratic were transported a minimum distance of about .\n\nBig Rock is located along the side of Highway 7, and public parking is available at the turn-off. Depsite the presence of a fence around Big Rock and a sign telling people not to climb, many tourists, who visit the rock, ignore the warnings to either boulder or climb the tall erratic.\n\nBig Rock Brewery in Calgary is named after Big Rock.\n\n"}

G. Wodehouse's \"Jeeves and Wooster,\" and \"Rosemary & Thyme.\"\n\nHe was born Clive Jack Montague Brooks in Islington, London, England, the son of a civil service clerk. He spent two years in the British Army, stationed in Germany. Equity, the actors' union, required his change of professional name, as there was already an actor registered under the name Clive Brook. After training at the Central School of Speech and Drama and deciding to act, he borrowed the name Exton from the character \"Sir Piers Exton\" in the William Shakespeare play \"Richard II\".\n\nHis first television play, \"No Fixed Abode,\" was transmitted by Granada Television in 1959. He then contributed to Sydney Newman's \"Armchair Theatre\" series which included the episodes: \"Where I Live\", \"Hold My Hand, Soldier\", \"I'll Have You to Remember,\" and \"The Trial of Doctor Fancy,\" among others; the best of them being directed by Ted Kotcheff.\n\nHe later wrote \"The Close Prisoner\" (also with Kotcheff) for ATV's \"Studio 64\" – a season of plays designed to emphasise the role of the writer in television – and \"Land of My Dreams\", \"The Bone Yard\", \"The Big Eat\", \"Are You Ready For the Music?\" and \"The Rainbirds\" for the BBC. He also wrote \"The Boundary\" (1975), with Tom Stoppard, for the BBC's experimental series \"The Eleventh Hour\". Most of this early work is now lost, having been made at a time when programmes recorded on tape were routinely wiped and telerecordings discarded.\n\nExton then moved away from the single play and initiated series such as \"Killers\", \"Conceptions of Murder\" and \"The Crezz\", a depiction of Notting Hill life in the seventies. He also contributed, under the nom de plume M. K. Jeeves, two episodes to the first season of Terry Nation's \"Survivors\" for the BBC.\n\nExton said that the only feature film he ever wrote that pleased him was \"10 Rillington Place, \" with Sir Richard Attenborough (1971). Other films include \"Night Must Fall\", \"The House in Nightmare Park\", \"Isadora\" (with Melvyn Bragg and starring Vanessa Redgrave) and \"Entertaining Mr Sloane\" (from the Joe Orton play). He worked without credit on many films, but it is now known that he made major contributions to the scripts of \"Georgy Girl\" and \"The Bounty\".\n\nA 10-year stay in Hollywood bore little fruit. He co-wrote \"The Awakening\" (1980), an adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel \"The Jewel of Seven Stars\", and the action-adventure \"Red Sonja\" (starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, 1985), and, uncredited, contributed to \"The Bounty\" (with Sir Anthony Hopkins, 1984) before returning to Britain.\n\nReturning to England in 1986, Exton found that the television business had radically changed through the rise of the independent producer, such as Brian Eastman, for whom he wrote most of the episodes (20) of Agatha Christie's \"Poirot,\" with David Suchet (1989–2000), all of the episodes (23) of \"Jeeves and Wooster,\" with Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry (1990–1993), and ten episodes of \"Rosemary & Thyme\" (2003–2006).\n\nHe also dramatised for television works by Jean Cocteau, Daphne du Maurier, Graham Greene, Somerset Maugham, Ruth Rendell, Georges Simenon and H. G. Wells.\n\nHe was married twice, first to Patricia Fletcher Ferguson (1951–1957), with whom he had two daughters (Ghislaine Frances Crerar Metcalfe and Sara Charlotte Montague-Brooks), and then from 1957 until his death to Margaret \"Mara\" Reid, with whom he had three children, two daughters (Antigone Margaret Exton White and Cornelia Plaxy Locatelli ) and a son (Saul Alexander).\n\nExton died in London of brain cancer on 16 August 2007.\n\nExton wrote only sporadically for the theatre:\n\nBarking in Essex made its West End début in September 2013 and starred Lee Evans, Sheila Hancock and Keeley Hawes.\n"}

Among them was Osaka National College of Engineering (). Since then the faculties in the field of engineering have been very competitive. In 1955 the university was renamed University of Osaka Prefecture (Japanese name for the university has not been changed since 1955).\n\nThe history of the precedent colleges of Naniwa University (NU) is as follows:\n\nIn 1883, the prefectural government founded the attached to Osaka Prefectural Medical School. In 1888, the institute was moved to in Sakai, which had two courses of agriculture and veterinary science. In 1942, during World War II, the course for Veterinary Medicine was reorganized into Osaka Higher School of Veterinary Medicine (), which was renamed Osaka College of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Husbandry () in 1945. This prefectural college, together with Osaka Agricultural College (, established in 1944 in Ikeda), constituted NU Faculty of Agriculture (now OPU Graduate School of Life and Environmental Sciences/School of Life and Environmental Sciences).\n\nThe main origin was founded as Osaka National Higher School of Engineering () in 1939, which was renamed Osaka National College of Engineering in 1944. Its site is now the main (Nakamozu) campus of OPU. The college was merged with four prefectural technical colleges to constitute NU Faculty of Engineering (now OPU Graduate School of Engineering/School of Engineering). In 1950, the two of the former prefectural colleges constituted Junior Technical College Division (one campus in Neyagawa and the other in Yodogawa-ku, Osaka. Neyagawa campus was reorganized into Osaka Prefectural College of Technology [] in 1962, while Yodogawa campus was later abolished).\n\nStill other origin was established as Osaka Youth Normal School (a national college: ) in 1944. This teachers college constituted NU Faculty of Education, which was later abolished and reorganized into Division of Liberal Arts (now OPU Faculty of Liberal Arts and Sciences).\n\nThe was a junior college in Mihara-ku, Sakai. It was established in 1953, and closed in 1964. It offered courses in agriculture and food chemistry.\n\nOWU was established in 1949 by developing Osaka Prefecture Women's College, which was established in 1924 under old educational systems (the second oldest public women's college in Japan). Its campus was originally located in Sumiyoshi-ku, Osaka. In 1976, the university was moved to Sakai. The campus (abolished in March 2007) was next to Daisen-kofun (supposed to be the tomb of Emperor Nintoku).\n\nOWU at first had one faculty: Faculty of Liberal Arts and Education, which included:\n\nIn 1999 Faculty of Liberal Arts and Education was reorganized into two faculties:\n\nOPCN was founded as Osaka Prefecture Junior College of Nursing in 1978.

There are four cafeterias which are popular among the students and also the professors.\n\nOPU is specially superior in the engineering science field. All information about classes and student's results are administered using an IT System and there are lots of computers that all students can use freely.\n\nOPU has four school festivals namely \"Yuko festival\", \"Tanabata festival\", \"Anju festival\" and \"Shirasagi festival.\"\nThe Yuko festival is held in May, where many freshmen set up refreshment booths and make friends in this festival, since \"Yuko\" means \"friendship\" in Japanese.

He formerly played rugby union at fullback for Bath and England. He is the brother of ex-Newport RFC player Nigel Callard.\n\nCallard taught physical education classes and sports classes at Downside School (Somerset) in the early to mid-1990s. He also taught Biology to younger students.\n\nCallard joined Bath from Newport in 1989. In November 1993 he made his international debut for England against the All Blacks, which saw England cause an upset, winning 15-9. Callard enjoyed a fine debut, scoring 12 points from four successful penalties. In February 1994, on his second appearance for England, Callard was again the England's hero in the 1994 Five Nations Championship match between Scotland and England at the newly rebuilt Murrayfield Stadium in Edinburgh.\n\nHe kicked all of England's points from five penalties, in a scrappy and closely fought match, as England narrowly beat Scotland 15-14. Controversially, the winning penalty came deep into stoppage time at the end of the match with the score at 12-14, when the referee erroneously gave a penalty against Scotland in the final climactic tussle for possession. Video replays later confirmed that the ball was handled on the ground in a ruck by Rob Andrew, and the referee, believing it had been handled illegally by Scottish player Ian Jardine, awarded England a penalty. England's white jersey that season had 'blue' cuffs that matched the Scotland jersey, which could be easily mistaken in a mass crowd of bodies. Callard held his nerve against a cacophony of booing and jeering from the home fans and successfully kicked the resultant penalty, from nearly 50 yards out. As the kick went between the posts, the referee blew the final whistle, and Callard celebrated wildly with his relieved England teammates.\n\nThe adulation he received in the wake of such a dramatic victory was fleeting however, as despite his match winning performance against Scotland, Callard was criticised after England's next match, a fortnight later, against Ireland at Twickenham. He missed four penalty attempts, and also failed to prevent an Irish try by Simon Geoghegan. Although he managed to convert four penalties in the match, England still lost 13-12. The defeat ended England's chances of a Grand Slam and reduced their chances of winning the Championship. Callard, along with several other players were consequently dropped from the England side for the remainder of the Five Nations campaign. England's form improved and they won their remaining two matches but still lost out on the Five Nations Championship on points difference to Wales.\n\nDespite continuing to be selected for future England squads, including for their 1994 Summer Tour of South Africa, he fell behind, initially Paul Hull, and later Mike Catt, Tim Stimpson and Matt Perry as England's first choice Full Back. The intense competition for places in the England side over the next few years meant that Callard would only gain a total of five caps for England, although he did score an impressive total of 69 points in that time. He played in one solitary match in the 1995 Rugby World Cup against Western Samoa, scoring 21 points from the boot, in a 44-22 win that helped England progress to the Quarter Finals. Callard won his last cap for England in November 1995, in a 24-14 defeat to South Africa.\n\nAt club level with Bath he was part of a very successful side in the early to mid 1990s which won five English Courage League Premiership titles, as well as five Pilkington Cup titles. His crowning achievement came late in his career when he scored all 19 of Bath's points in their 1998 Heineken Cup final victory over Brive. In August 1998 Callard was appointed assistant coach to Andy Robinson at Bath, before being made Head Coach in 2000. In 2002 he became assistant coach to Phil Davies at Leeds Tykes and later that year was also appointed as head coach of the England U21s. During his time at Leeds he coached them to victory the 2004–05 Powergen Cup, in the final of which they defeated his old side Bath. He joined the Rugby Football Union's National Academy in summer 2005.\n\nCallard was appointed kicking coach to the senior England rugby team for the Rugby World Cup 2007.\n\n"}

A boss typically has absolute or nearly absolute control over the other members of the organization, is greatly feared for their ruthlessness and willingness to take lives to exert their influence, and profits from the criminal endeavours in which the organization engages.\n\nSome groups may only have as little as two ranks (a boss and their soldiers). Other groups have a more complex, structured organization with many ranks, and structure may vary with cultural background. Organized crime enterprises originating in Sicily differ in structure from those in mainland Italy. American groups may be structured differently from their European counterparts, and Latino and African American gangs often have structures that vary from European gangs. The size of the criminal organization is also important, as regional or national gangs have much more complex hierarchies.\n\nThe boss in the Sicilian and American Mafia is the head of the crime family and the top decision maker. Only the boss, underboss or consigliere can initiate an associate into the family, allowing them to become a made man. The boss can promote or demote family members at will, and has the sole power to sanction murders inside and outside the family. If the boss is incarcerated or incapacitated he places an \"acting boss\" who responsible for running the crime family. When a boss dies the crime family members choose a new boss from inside the organization.\n\nThe typical structure within the Mafia in Sicily and America is usually as follows:\n\nA boss will typically put up layers of insulation between himself and his men so as to hinder police efforts to connect his orders to him. Whenever he issues orders, he does so either to his underboss, consigliere or capos. The orders are then passed down the line to the soldiers. This makes it difficult under most circumstances for the police to directly implicate a boss in a crime, since he almost never directly gives orders to the soldiers.\n\nThe term Mr Big is used within the underworld, and additionally during media reportings of persons associated with criminal activities, to refer to a leader of a body of persons functioning in the capacities of roles within organised crime. Sometimes bosses of the so-called gangland are referred to as being \"Mr Big\", as for example when he could not be named for legal reasons. The term implicitly indicates a degree of a possession of a higher intelligence of an individual.\n\nThe term especially indicates the existence of involvement in what is known as \"big-time crime\", which would include for example armed robbery, and the more organised aspects of careers within crime.\n\nA 1945 dictionary of criminal slang in the USA lists \"Big Brains\" as \"a gang-leader\", but not \"Mr Big\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2029112", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2029112", "title": "Bond market", "text": "Bond market\n\nThe bond market (also debt market or credit market) is a financial market where participants can issue new debt, known as the primary market, or buy and sell debt securities, known as the secondary market. This is usually in the form of bonds, but it may include notes, bills, and so on.\n\nIts primary goal is to provide long-term funding for public and private expenditures. The bond market has largely been dominated by the United States, which accounts for about 39% of the market. As of 2017, the size of the worldwide bond market (total debt outstanding) is estimated at $100.13 trillion, according to Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA).\n\nThe bond market is part of the credit market, with bank loans forming the other main component. The global credit market in aggregate is about 3 times the size of the global equity market. Bank loans are not securities under the Securities and Exchange Act, but bonds typically are and are therefore more highly regulated. Bonds are typically not secured by collateral (although they can be), and are sold in relatively small denominations of around $1,000 to $10,000. Unlike bank loans, bonds may be held by retail investors. Bonds are more frequently traded than loans, although not as often as equity.\n\nNearly all of the average daily trading in the U.S. bond market takes place between broker-dealers and large institutions in a decentralized over-the-counter (OTC) market. However, a small number of bonds, primarily corporate ones, are listed on exchanges. Bond trading prices and volumes are reported on Financial Industry Regulatory Authority's (FINRA) Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine, or TRACE.\n\nAn important part of the bond market is the government bond market, because of its size and liquidity. Government bonds are often used to compare other bonds to measure credit risk. Because of the inverse relationship between bond valuation and interest rates (or yields), the bond market is often used to indicate changes in interest rates or the shape of the yield curve, the measure of \"cost of funding\". The yield on government bonds in low risk countries such as the United States or Germany is thought to indicate a risk-free rate of default. Other bonds denominated in the same currencies (U.S. Dollars or Euros) will typically have higher yields, in large part because other borrowers are more likely than the U.S. or German Central Governments to default, and the losses to investors in the case of default are expected to be higher. The primary way to default is to not pay in full or not pay on time.\n\nThe Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) classifies the broader bond market into five specific bond markets.\n\n\nBond market participants are similar to participants in most financial markets and are essentially either buyers (debt issuer) of funds or sellers (institution) of funds and often both.\n\nParticipants include:\n\nBecause of the specificity of individual bond issues, and the lack of liquidity in many smaller issues, the majority of outstanding bonds are held by institutions like pension funds, banks and mutual funds. In the United States, approximately 10% of the market is held by private individuals.\n\nAmounts outstanding on the global bond market increased by 2% in the twelve months to March 2012 to nearly $100 trillion. Domestic bonds accounted for 70% of the total and international bonds for the remainder. The United States was the largest market with 33% of the total followed by Japan (14%). As a proportion of global GDP, the bond market increased to over 140% in 2011 from 119% in 2008 and 80% a decade earlier. The considerable growth means that in March 2012 it was much larger than the global equity market which had a market capitalisation of around $53 trillion. Growth of the market since the start of the economic slowdown was largely a result of an increase in issuance by governments.\n\nThe outstanding value of international bonds increased by 2% in 2011 to $30 trillion. The $1.2 trillion issued during the year was down by around a fifth on the previous year's total. The first half of 2012 was off to a strong start with issuance of over $800 billion. The United States was the leading center in terms of value outstanding with 24% of the total followed by the UK 13%.\n\nAccording to the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA), as of Q1 2017, the U.S. bond market size is (in billions):\n\nNote that the total federal government debts recognized by SIFMA are significantly less than the total bills, notes and bonds issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, of some $19.8 trillion at the time. This figure is likely to have excluded the inter-governmental debts such as those held by the Federal Reserve and the Social Security Trust Fund.\n\nFor market participants who own a bond, collect the coupon and hold it to maturity, market volatility is irrelevant; principal and interest are received according to a pre-determined schedule.\n\nBut participants who buy and sell bonds before maturity are exposed to many risks, most importantly changes in interest rates. When interest rates increase, the value of existing bonds falls, since new issues pay a higher yield. Likewise, when interest rates decrease, the value of existing bonds rises, since new issues pay a lower yield. This is the fundamental concept of bond market volatility—changes in bond prices are inverse to changes in interest rates. Fluctuating interest rates are part of a country's monetary policy and bond market volatility is a response to expected monetary policy and economic changes.\n\nEconomists' views of economic indicators versus actual released data contribute to market volatility. A tight consensus is generally reflected in bond prices and there is little price movement in the market after the release of \"in-line\" data. If the economic release differs from the consensus view, the market usually undergoes rapid price movement as participants interpret the data. Uncertainty (as measured by a wide consensus) generally brings more volatility before and after a release. Economic releases vary in importance and impact depending on where the economy is in the business cycle.\n\nBond markets determine the price in terms of yield that a borrower must pay in order to receive funding. In one notable instance, when President Bill Clinton attempted to increase the U.S. budget deficit in the 1990s, it led to such a sell-off (decreasing prices; increasing yields) that he was forced to abandon the strategy and instead balance the budget. \n\nBonds typically trade in $1,000 increments and are priced as a percentage of par value (100%). Many bonds have minimums imposed by the bond or the dealer. Typical sizes offered are increments of $10,000. For broker/dealers, however, anything smaller than a $100,000 trade is viewed as an \"odd lot\".\n\nBonds typically pay interest at set intervals. Bonds with fixed coupons divide the stated coupon into parts defined by their payment schedule, for example, semi-annual pay. Bonds with floating rate coupons have set calculation schedules where the floating rate is calculated shortly before the next payment. Zero-coupon bonds do not pay interest. They are issued at a deep discount to account for the implied interest.\n\nBecause most bonds have predictable income, they are typically purchased as part of a more conservative investment scheme. Nevertheless, investors have the ability to actively trade bonds, especially corporate bonds and municipal bonds with the market and can make or lose money depending on economic, interest rate, and issuer factors.\n\nBond interest is taxed as ordinary income, in contrast to dividend income, which receives favorable taxation rates. However many government and municipal bonds are exempt from one or more types of taxation.\n\nInvestment companies allow individual investors the ability to participate in the bond markets through bond funds, closed-end funds and unit-investment trusts. In 2006 total bond fund net inflows increased 97% from $30.8 billion in 2005 to $60.8 billion in 2006. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are another alternative to trading or investing directly in a bond issue. These securities allow individual investors the ability to overcome large initial and incremental trading sizes.\n\nA number of bond indices exist for the purposes of managing portfolios and measuring performance, similar to the S&P 500 or Russell Indexes for stocks. The most common American benchmarks are the Barclays Capital Aggregate Bond Index, Citigroup BIG and Merrill Lynch Domestic Master. Most indices are parts of families of broader indices that can be used to measure global bond portfolios, or may be further subdivided by maturity or sector for managing specialized portfolios.\n\nIn ancient Sumer, temples functioned both as places of worship and as banks, under the oversight of the priests and the ruler. Loans were made at a customary fixed 20% interest rate; this custom was continued in Babylon, Mesopotamia and written into the 6th Century BCE Code of Hammurabi.\n\nThe first known bond in history dates from circa 2400BC in Nippur, Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq). It guaranteed the payment of grain by the principal. The surety bond guaranteed reimbursement if the principal failed to make payment. Corn was the currency of that time period.\n\nIn these ancient times, loans were initially made in cattle or grain from which interest could be paid from growing the herd or crop and returning a portion to the lender. Silver became popular as it was less perishable and allowed large values to be transported more easily, but unlike cattle or grain could not naturally produce interest. Taxation derived from human labor evolved as a solution to this problem.\n\nBy the Plantagenet era, the English Crown had long-standing links with Italian financiers and merchants such as Ricciardi of Lucca in Tuscany. These trade links were based on loans, similar to modern-day Bank loans; other loans were linked to the need to finance the Crusades and the city-states of Italy found themselves - uniquely - at the intersection of international trade, finance and religion. The loans of the time were however not yet securitized in the form of bonds. That innovation came from further north: Venice.\n\nIn 12th Century Venice, the city-state's government began issuing war-bonds known as \"prestiti\", perpetuities paying a fixed rate of 5% These were initially regarded with suspicion but the ability to buy and sell them became regarded as valuable. Securities of this late Medieval period were priced with techniques very similar to those used in modern-day Quantitative finance. The bond market had begun.\n\nFollowing the Hundred Years' War, monarchs of England and France defaulted on very large debts to Venetian bankers causing a collapse of the system of Lombard banking in 1345. This economic set-back hit every part of economic life - including clothing, food and hygiene - and during the ensuing Black Death the European economy and bond market were depleted even further. Venice banned its bankers from trading government debt but the idea of debt as a tradable instrument and thus the bond market endued.\n\nWith their origins in antiquity, bonds are much older than the equity market which appeared with the first ever joint-stock corporation the Dutch East India Company in 1602 (although some scholars argue that something similar to the joint-stock corporation existed in Ancient Rome).\n\nThe first ever Sovereign bond was issued in 1693 by the newly formed Bank of England. This bond was used to fund conflict with France. Other European governments followed suit.\n\nThe U.S.A. first issued sovereign Treasury bonds to finance the American Revolutionary War. Sovereign debt (\"Liberty Bonds\") was again used to finance its World War I efforts and issued in 1917 shortly after the U.S. declared war on Germany.\n\nEach maturity of bond (one-year, two-year, five-year and so on) was thought of as a separate market until the mid-1970s when traders at Salomon Brothers began drawing a curve through their yields. This innovation - the yield curve - transformed the way bonds were both priced and traded and paved the way for quantitative finance to flourish.\n\nStarting in the late 1970s, non-investment grade public companies were allowed to issue corporate debt.\n\nThe next innovation was the advent of Derivatives in the 1980s and onwards, which saw the creation of Collateralized debt obligations, Residential mortgage-backed securities and the advent of the Structured products industry.\n\nSpecific:\n"}

The station broadcasts sports programming, using the brand name \"TSN 1200 Ottawa\". CFGO is a Class B station operating on the clear-channel frequency of 1200 kHz, operating from a 6-tower transmitter array near Manotick, with studios located in the Bell Media Building on George Street in Downtown Ottawa's ByWard Market.\n\nThe station was launched in 1964 by Confederation Broadcasting, with the call letters CKPM at 1440 AM. CKPM aired an MOR music format with a heavy local news commitment.\n\nIn 1970, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission revoked Confederation's licence, alleging that the company had failed to live up to its financial and management obligations. Confederation appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, who ruled in April 1971 that Confederation had not had a fair hearing before the CRTC.\n\nIn 1972, majority interest in the station was sold to Baton Broadcasting. The station also adopted its current CFGO callsign that year and moved to a Top 40 music format to compete with top-rated CFRA.\n\nOn November 15, 1984, CFGO Radio Ltd. received approval from the CRTC to change CFGO's frequency to 1200 kHz with power remaining at 50,000 watts day and night. The station moved to its current 1200 (with a better AM signal) on January 5, 1986, and was sold to Rawlco Communications the following year.\n\nPlaying Starship's \"We Built This City\" as the inaugural song on the new 1200 AM frequency, Rawlco transitioned the station from Top 40 to adult contemporary as \"Adult Rock, Go 1200\" at the same time as the frequency switch, with local actress Abby Hagyard (of \"You Can't Do That on Television\" fame) serving as morning co-host. However, following CFRA's move from contemporary hits to a soft rock/oldies mix in August 1986, CFGO switched back to its previous all-hit presentation within a month. On March 8, 1988, Rawlco relaunched the CHR format, with the station now downplaying its call letters in favour of the name \"Energy 1200\". The station subsequently changed its callsign to CJBZ and its brand name to The Buzz in late 1997, with a focus on more alternative and underground rock.\n\nOn September 9, 1998, at 7:30 a.m., the station switched to its current all-sports format, using the brand name \"OSR1200 - Ottawa Sports Radio\". It was acquired the following year by CHUM Limited, reverting to its CFGO callsign. In 1999, the station adopted the \"Team 1200\" brand name.\n\nOn May 7, 2001, the station formed the basis for CHUM's short-lived national sports radio network The Team, which adopted the Ottawa station's brand identity. The station retained its format and brand when CHUM subsequently folded the network.\n\nOn June 22, 2007, CFGO along with the other CHUM stations were sold to CTVglobemedia.\n\nOn September 30, 2013, CFGO re-branded as \"TSN Radio 1200\".\n\nTSN 1200 broadcasts a wide variety of sports programming, as well as news and weather, and the station streams Fox Sports Radio at night.

Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005), is a United States Supreme Court decision on criminal sentencing. The Court ruled that the Sixth Amendment right to jury trial requires that other than a prior conviction, only facts admitted by a defendant or proved beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury may be used to calculate a sentence exceeding the prescribed statutory maximum sentence, whether the defendant has pleaded guilty or been convicted at trial. The maximum sentence that a judge may impose is based upon the facts admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nIn its majority decision, the Court struck down the provision of the federal sentencing statute that required federal district judges to impose a sentence within the United States Federal Sentencing Guidelines range, along with the provision that deprived federal appeals courts of the power to review sentences imposed outside the range. The Court instructed federal district judges to impose a sentence with reference to a wider range of sentencing factors set forth in the federal sentencing statute, and it directed federal appeals courts to review criminal sentences for \"reasonableness,\" which the Court left undefined.\n\nThe ruling was the direct consequence of the Court's ruling six months earlier in \"Blakely v. Washington\", in which the Court had imposed the same requirement on a guidelines sentencing scheme employed in Washington State. \"Blakely\" arose out of \"Apprendi v. New Jersey\" in which the Court held that except for a prior conviction, any fact that increases the defendant's punishment above the statutory maximum punishment must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nIn 2003, Freddie Joe Booker was arrested after police officers found 92.5 grams of crack cocaine in his duffel bag. He later gave a written statement to the police that admitted to selling an additional 566 grams of crack cocaine. In 2003, a jury in the United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin found Booker guilty of possessing with intent to distribute at least 50 grams of cocaine base. Federal law provided for a statutory sentence of ten years to life in prison.\n\nAt sentencing, the judge found by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant (1) distributed 566 grams over and above the 100 grams that the jury had to have found and (2) had obstructed justice. Under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, that increased the defendant's base offense level from 32 to 36 (U.S.S.G. §§ 2D1.1(c)(2),(4)). The enhancement for the drug possession and obstruction of justice (U.S.S.G. § 3C1.1) made Booker's sentencing range of 30 years to life; the judge sentenced Booker to the minimum.\n\nBooker appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, claiming the sentencing guidelines violated his Sixth Amendment rights since the judge was able to find facts absent the findings of the jury, other than his criminal history, to determine his sentencing range. The Seventh Circuit affirmed Booker's conviction but found the application of the Guidelines violated the Sixth Amendment, as interpreted in \"Blakely\", and so reversed Booker's sentence. The Government appealed the Seventh Circuit's ruling to the Supreme Court.\n\nNarcotics agents discovered 2.5 kilograms of cocaine and 281.6 grams of cocaine base in Ducan Fanfan's vehicle and arrested him. A jury in the US District Court for the District of Maine found that Fanfan had conspired to distribute and to possess with the intent to distribute at least 500 grams of cocaine, in violation of , and 841(b)(1)(B)(ii). The maximum sentence for Fanfan under the Federal Guidelines, without any additional findings, was 78 months in prison.\n\nAt sentencing, the judge, by a preponderance of the evidence, determined that Fanfan was responsible for 2.5 kilograms of cocaine powder and 261.6 grams of crack and was an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor in the criminal activity. That would have resulted 188 to 235 months sentence under the Guidelines, which was a 10-year increase in the sentencing range from what the jury had found. The Supreme Court had issued \"Blakely\" four days before the judge imposed Fanfan's sentence. The sentencing judge, believing that \"Blakely\" had implications on federal judges increasing sentences on facts not found by juries, imposed the maximum sentence, 78 months, based on the jury's verdict. The government asked the judge to correct Fanfan’s sentence, which was denied.\n\nThe Government filed a notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit and a petition for a writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court in the Fanfan case. Because of the importance of the case, the Supreme Court granted the petition as well as a similar petition filed by the government in Booker’s case, following the Seventh Circuit's ruling in favor of Booker. The Government asked the Court to determine whether \"Apprendi\" applied to the Sentencing Guidelines and which of the Guidelines were constitutional.\n\nThe decision of the Supreme Court was announced by two different groups of Justices. Justice Stevens wrote the majority opinion answering the question of whether the application of the Guidelines in these two cases violated the Sixth Amendment as articulated in the \"Apprendi\" line of cases. Justice Breyer wrote the majority opinion answering the question of how to remedy the Sixth Amendment violation identified by the Court.\n\nAs applied to modern sentencing schemes, the Sixth Amendment demands that, other than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the defendant's punishment above the statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The \"statutory maximum\" is the greatest sentence the judge can impose based solely on the jury's fact finding. In a guidelines sentencing scheme that requires judges to impose a sentence within the guideline range, the jury-trial and reasonable-doubt requirements apply to the determination of any fact that exposes the defendant to punishment above the guideline range.\n\nThe Federal Sentencing Guidelines, like the Washington sentencing guidelines discussed in \"Blakely\", were mandatory; sentencing judges were required to impose sentences within the range dictated by the Guidelines. In this sense, the decision in \"Blakely\" dictated the constitutional holding that the rule of \"Apprendi\", as construed in \"Blakely\", applies to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines.\n\nThe Government made three principal arguments against applying \"Blakely\" to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, all of which the Court rejected:\n\n1. \"Commission vs. Legislature\"\n\nThe Federal Sentencing Guidelines were promulgated by a sentencing commission; the Washington sentencing guidelines at issue in \"Blakely\", by contrast, were enacted by that state's legislature. That distinction, the Court said, \"lacked constitutional significance,\" because regardless of the body that set the rules, the rules required sentencing judges to increase sentences on the basis of particular facts not submitted to the jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. \"Regardless of whether the legal basis of the accusation [against the defendant] is in a statute or in guidelines promulgated by an independent commission, the principles behind the jury trial right are equally applicable\" to each.\n\n2. \"Stare decisis\"\n\nThe Government identified four recent cases that, it argued, precluded the Court from applying \"Blakely\" to the Guidelines under the principles of \"stare decisis\". First, \"United States v. Dunnigan\", , held that the Guidelines provision that provided for an enhanced sentence if the defendant committed perjury during the trial did not violate the defendant's Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. In \"Dunnigan\", the Court had no occasion to consider whether the jury-trial right applied to that particular provision. Furthermore, although a sentence based on such an enhancement had the potential to exceed the statutory maximum, this did not mean that the judge had to impose such a sentence. \"Thus, while the reach of \"Dunnigan\" may be limited, we need not overrule it.\"\n\nNext, \"Witte v. United States\", , in which the Court held conduct that supported an enhancement in a prior case did not prevent a separate criminal prosecution for the same conduct, did not prevent applying \"Blakely\" to the Guidelines. This was so because, ultimately, the conduct in the two respective cases was subject to two different burdens of proof. The Court considered the converse of the \"Witte\" rule in \"United States v. Watts\", , where it held that conduct of which the defendant had been acquitted could nevertheless support a sentence enhancement under the Guidelines. In neither case had the Court considered whether the sentence enhancements in question were subject to the jury-trial requirement. \"The issue we confront today simply was not presented.\"\n\nFinally, \"Edwards v. United States\", , in which the Court allowed a sentence for a drug conspiracy involving both powder and crack cocaine to rest on both drugs in the face of a general verdict not specifying whether the jury believed the conspiracy involved either powder cocaine or crack cocaine or both, did not prevent the Court from applying \"Blakely\" to the Guidelines. In \"Edwards\", the defendants could not have argued that the powder and crack cocaine were not part of the same overall conspiracy; hence, the Court's ruling in that case was not inconsistent with applying \"Blakely\" to the Guidelines.\n\n3. \"Separation of Powers\"\n\nThe Government argued that applying the jury-trial requirement to sentencing enhancements promulgated by a commission would transform those enhancements into a criminal code, resulting in an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to the judicial branch. In \"Mistretta v. United States\", the Court had upheld the delegation of such legislative power to a body in the judicial branch, reasoning that the judicial branch had the power to exercise other quasi-legislative functions such as proposing rules of evidence and civil procedure for use in the federal courts. The United States Sentencing Commission was not performing an adjudicatory function; rather, it was exercising a policy-making power appropriate for judicial officers and uniquely within their expertise. This reasoning did not preclude applying \"Blakely\" to the Guidelines.\n\nThus, the Court ruled that the holding in \"Blakely\" applied to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines.\n\nThe Court next confronted the question of a remedy for the constitutional violation. A different majority of the Court concluded that 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b) — the provision of the federal sentencing statute that required district courts to impose a sentence within the Guidelines range — was \"incompatible\" with the constitutional holding and therefore had to be \"severed and excised\" from the statute. Likewise, 18 U.S.C. § 3742(e), the provision that governed the handling of appeals from sentences, also had to be severed and excised, because that provision was inextricably linked with the provision that made the Guidelines mandatory. The result of severing and excising these two provisions was to make the Guidelines \"effectively advisory,\" such that district courts could, after considering the Guidelines range, tailor a sentence that reflected the broader range of concerns set forth in the federal sentencing statute.\n\nThe Court evaluated two possible remedies in light of Congress's intent in enacting the Guidelines system. The first option, and the one preferred by the Justices who dissented from the remedial holding, \"would engraft onto the existing system today's Sixth Amendment 'jury trial' requirement.\" The second, the one the Court ultimately adopted, made the Guidelines advisory while at the same time \"maintaining a strong connection between the sentence imposed and the offender's real conduct — a connection important to the increased uniformity of sentencing that Congress intended its Guidelines system to achieve.\" Although both remedies would \"significantly alter the system that Congress designed,\" the remedial majority observed that it was not possible to \"maintain the judicial factfinding that Congress thought would underpin the mandatory Guidelines system\" in light of the jury factfinding requirement the constitutional majority had applied to that system.\n\n\"Why the Jury Factfinding Requirement Is Not Compatible with the Guidelines Scheme\"\n\nSeveral considerations persuaded the Court that Congress would not have enacted the Guidelines system and made it mandatory for federal district judges to apply if it had known that a jury factfinding requirement would apply to it. First, the text of the sentencing statute required \"the court\" to consider \"the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant\" when imposing sentence. In context, this meant \"the judge sitting alone\" instead of \"the judge together with the jury.\" When it was debating the Guidelines, Congress had intended for the judge to weigh the factors bearing on a defendant's sentence by himself.\n\nSecond, \"Congress's basic statutory goal — a system that diminishes sentencing disparity — depends for its success upon judicial efforts to determine, and to base punishment upon, the \"real conduct\" that underlies the crime of conviction.\" Many federal crimes are defined so broadly as to encompass a vast array of underlying conduct. And other federal crimes, like robbery, can be committed in a variety of different ways. Judges typically relied on presentence reports, which set forth the relevant conduct and offender characteristics, to assist them in determining what an appropriate sentence was. Congress anticipated that, under the Guidelines, this practice would continue, and this expectation supported the Court's holdings in \"Witte\" and \"Watts\". By contrast, imposing the jury factfinding requirement onto the Guidelines would \"destroy the system\" by \"prevent[ing] a judge from relying on a presentence report for factual information, relevant to sentencing, uncovered after the trial,\" because such facts would necessarily not have been submitted to the jury during the course of the trial. This, in turn, would \"weaken the tie between a sentence and an offender's real conduct.\"\n\nImagine that both Smith and Jones violate the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1951(a), which forbids obstructing, delaying, or affecting commerce or the movement of any article or commodity in commerce by extortion. Smith threatens to injure a co-worker if the co-worker does not advance him a few dollars from the interstate company's till. Jones threatens to injure a co-worker unless the co-worker advances him a few thousand dollars from the company's accounts, and reinforces this threat by \"making certain that the co-worker's family is aware of the threat, by arranging deliveries of various dead animals to the co-worker's home to show that he is serious, and so forth.\" Both Smith and Jones, although they violated the same statute, created different harms as a result of their actions. Under the Guidelines, their sentences would be different. If the jury factfinding requirement were merely grafted onto the Guidelines scheme, unless prosecutors \"decide to charge more than the elements of the crime,\" the judge would have to impose similar punishments.\n\nImagine next that two former felons, Johnson and Jackson, each threatened a bank teller with a gun, made off with $50,000, and injured an innocent bystander while fleeing the bank. Suppose Johnson was charged with illegal possession of a firearm under 18 U.S.C. § 922(g), and Jackson was charged with bank robbery under 18 U.S.C. § 2113(a). The Guidelines would have allowed a judge to impose similar sentences on both Johnson and Jackson, despite their being charged with different crimes. Requiring the sentence-enhancing facts to be submitted to a jury undermines the ability of the Guidelines to achieve their goal of sentence uniformity, meaning uniformity of sentences imposed for the same real conduct, not for violations of the same statute.\n\nFurthermore, imposing the jury-factfinding requirement onto the Guidelines would prove more complex than Congress could have intended. Would the sentence enhancements have to be charged in the indictment? How could a defendant defend against specific enhancements, such as that he used a gun during the crime, while simultaneously denying his guilt entirely? The fact that the vast majority of criminal cases are resolved through plea bargains would not simplify things. Instead, it would complicate them by increasing the likelihood that any agreed-upon sentence reflects more the skill of defense counsel and the prosecutor's policies than the real conduct underlying the offense.\n\nSuch a system \"would have particularly troubling consequences with respect to prosecutorial power.\" Because a prosecutor would control not only the charge to bring against the defendant but also the sentence enhancement, he would necessarily have the \"power to decide, based on relevant information about the offense and the offender, which defendants merit heavier punishments.\"\n\nCongress also would not have intended to craft a system that makes it more difficult to ratchet sentences upward than downward. Yet imposing the jury-factfinding requirement on the Guidelines would have precisely that effect. For all these reasons, the Court concluded that Congress would not have enacted the Guidelines as it did if it had known that many of the various sentence-enhancing factors would be subject to a jury-trial requirement.\n\n\"Which Parts of the Statute Should Be Excised?\"\n\nIn order to eliminate the constitutional violation the Court had identified and at the same time tailor the federal sentencing statutes more closely to Congressional intent, the Court struck out 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b)(1), the provision of the sentencing statute that made it mandatory for district courts to impose sentences according to the Guidelines. The rest of the sentencing statute \"functioned independently.\" It required district judges to \"consider\" the Guidelines sentencing range established for the applicable category of offense committed by the applicable category of defendant in order to impose a sentence that reflects the seriousness of the offense, promotes respect for the law, provides for adequate deterrence, protects the public, and provides the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care.\n\nBecause the Court had struck out § 3553(b)(1), it also had to strike out 18 U.S.C. § 3742(e), the provision governing the standard for reviewing sentences on appeal. This did not impose an unnecessary obstacle for handling appeals of sentences, for \"a statute that does not \"explicitly\" set forth a standard of review may do so \"implicitly\".\" Before the Court's decision in \"Booker\", § 3742(e) had instructed appellate courts to determine whether a sentence was \"unreasonable\" with respect to the Guidelines range. After \"Booker\", the Court read the remaining provisions of the sentencing appeal statute to instruct appellate courts to determine whether sentences were \"unreasonable\" with respect to all the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) — the statute spelling out which factors district courts were required to consider in fashioning a sentence in the first instance. Though the Justices who dissented from the remedial holding called this standard unworkable, the Court reasoned that a standard of \"reasonableness\" was familiar from other areas of the law. Together with the Sentencing Commission, which would still collect data about criminal sentencing, the courts of appeals together are able to maintain uniformity of criminal sentences. Furthermore, if Congress was unsatisfied with this arrangement, it was free to amend the sentencing laws.\n\nJustice Stevens pointed out that it was possible to avoid the Sixth Amendment violation in Booker's case without making any changes to the Guidelines at all. Solely on the statute of conviction, the maximum Guidelines sentence Booker could have received was 262 months. If the prosecution had submitted the quantity of drugs to the jury, the range would have increased to between 324 and 405 months. Booker ultimately received a sentence of 360 months, one within the increased sentencing range and one which the sentencing judge could have imposed after evaluating Booker's criminal history and whether he had obstructed justice. \"Because the Guidelines as written possess the virtue of combining a mandatory determination of sentencing ranges and discretionary decisions within those ranges, they allow ample latitude for judicial factfinding that does not even arguably raise any Sixth Amendment issue.\"\n\nBut Stevens's principal objection was that the Court had crafted a new kind of severability analysis. He started with the premise that all legislative enactments are presumed to be valid, and may only be struck down in their entirety if the law is unconstitutional in \"all or nearly all of its applications,\" or if the invalid provision cannot be severed from the remainder of the statute. Neither of those conditions applied to the federal sentencing laws, Stevens observed, and so there was no need to adopt a third method of curing constitutional violations. After all, according to the Sentencing Commission, 45% of criminal sentences involve no enhancements whatsoever, and not all of the rest would actually implicate a defendant's Sixth Amendment rights. Furthermore, defendants may waive their jury-trial rights, and so it follows that they may also waive their \"Blakely\" rights in appropriate situations.\n\nThese two observations led Stevens to the conclusion that only a \"tiny portion\" of criminal sentences imposed under the mandatory Guidelines scheme would actually implicate the \"Blakely\" rule. In those cases, prosecutors, defense attorneys, and judges could cope. Indeed, after \"Blakely\" was decided, the Department of Justice instructed prosecutors to include drug quantity allegations in the indictment. Also, in many cases, Guidelines ranges overlap, and there would be no \"Blakely\" problem if the judge imposed a sentence within that overlapping range and based that sentence solely on judicial factfinding. In light of these valid applications of mandatory Guidelines (constrained by \"Blakely\"), Stevens saw no plausible way to say that the sentencing statute was unconstitutional in nearly all of its applications.\n\nStevens further envisioned no difficulty in applying \"Blakely\" to the Guidelines. The word \"court\" could just as easily refer to the judge and jury together as it could to the judge alone. Congress must presumably legislate within constitutional limitations, after all, and it was not plain from the language of the statute that this alternative interpretation was incompatible. Stevens disputed that applying \"Blakely\" to the Guidelines would frustrate the goal of achieving uniformity in sentences based on real conduct, because judges retained discretion to impose sentences within prescribed ranges; if defendants pleaded guilty and waived their \"Blakely\" rights, the range within which the judge could exercise his discretion would necessarily increase. Given the fact-based nature of certain sentence enhancements under the Guidelines — drug quantity, firearm enhancements, and extent of injury or loss to the victim — there was no reason juries could not make those determinations. In complicated cases, prosecutors, defense attorneys, and judges together could be trusted to craft workable solutions. To the extent prosecutors overstep their charging authority, judges retain the ability to reject unsatisfactory plea agreements. In light of these objections, Stevens disputed that Congress would have preferred the majority's remedy to a solution of its own devising.\n\nJustice Breyer reiterated his disagreement with the \"Apprendi\" rule, and then identified specific reasons not to apply the \"Blakely\" holding to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. The facts used to determine a defendant's sentence had historically been solely within a judge's purview, and the Federal Sentencing Guidelines should be treated no differently. Creating a system that frustrated the goal of increased sentencing uniformity hardly seemed fair to defendants or to the public at large. The fact that the Guidelines were administrative rules rather than statutes also was significant to Breyer. And to the extent that the Guidelines did not adequately take into account an aggravating or mitigating circumstance, a judge was free to depart from the Guidelines range. Thus, the defendant had every expectation that, despite the Guidelines, he might receive a sentence at or near the \"statutory\" maximum rather than at the top end of the Guidelines range.\n\nJustice Scalia took issue with the Court's inferring a \"reasonableness\" standard of appellate review of sentences from the remainder of a statute from which it had excised the express statement that sentences should be reviewed for \"reasonableness.\" Traditionally, sentencing discretion was not reviewable on appeal. When the Guidelines were enacted, appellate review was limited to discrete cases delineated by statute; appellate review was not plenary. According to the text of the statute, the \"power to review a sentence for reasonableness arises only when the sentencing court has departed from the applicable guideline range.\" The situation here was not that the statute did not \"explicitly\" set forth a standard of review, but rather that the statute did explicitly set forth such a standard, but then excised from the statute the provision that established the standard. Was it proper for the Court to \"look for some congressional 'implication' of a \"different\" standard of review in the remnants of the statute that the Court has left standing? Only in Wonderland.\"\n\nFurthermore, it was not as easy for the courts to apply the \"reasonableness\" standard in the context of appellate review of sentences as the majority would have liked. First, there was no history of applying that standard under the Guidelines regime. Second, under the majority's holding that standard would apply across the board to all sentence appeals, including those that involved no legal error. \"The worst feature of the scheme is that no one knows — and perhaps no one is meant to know — how advisory Guidelines and 'unreasonableness' review will function in practice.\"\n\nThe lower courts had to revisit Booker's sentencing in light of the Supreme Court decision. He was resentenced by the same judge to the same 30-year sentence (longer than the 21-year sentence the judge could have imposed if the guidelines not been made advisory); however, retroactive changes in crack cocaine guidelines meant that Booker's sentence has been reduced slightly by a federal judge (from 30 to 27 years). He was released from federal prison on 1 November 2019.\n\nFanfan was resentenced by the US District judge from 78 months to 210 months in prison. The new sentence was upheld on appeal by the US Court of Appeals. His sentence was later reduced by the new federal sentencing guidelines for crack cocaine offenses. He was released from federal prison on 12 June 2015.\n\nThe decision has been criticized for fear that defendants and prosecutors will suffer from greater uncertainty and that some plea agreements will be entered into or rejected because of mistaken beliefs on the sentences that the judge will impose if the case is taken to trial or settled with a guilty plea.\n\n\n"}

A loyalist paramilitary group calling itself the Red Hand Defenders claimed responsibility for the murder. Allegations that the British state security forces were involved in her killing led to a public inquiry. It found no evidence that state forces directly facilitated her murder, but could not exclude the possibility that individual members had helped the perpetrators. It said that the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) failed to protect her and that she had been publicly threatened and assaulted by officers, which helped legitimize her as a target.\n\nNelson obtained her law degree at Queen's University Belfast (QUB) School of Law. She worked with other solicitors for a number of years before opening her own practice in Lurgan in 1989. Nelson represented clients in a number of high-profile cases (including Michael Caraher, one of the South Armagh Snipers, as well as a republican paramilitary accused of killing two RUC officers. She also represented the Garvaghy Road Residents' Coalition in nearby Portadown in the long-running Drumcree conflict against the Orange Order and RUC.\n\nNelson was posthumously awarded the Train Foundation's Civil Courage Prize, which recognises \"extraordinary heroes of conscience\".\n\nNelson claimed she had received death threats from members of the RUC as a result of her legal work. Some RUC officers made abusive and threatening remarks about Nelson to her clients, which became publicly known. In 1997, while approaching police lines in her capacity as legal representative of the Garvaghy Road Residents' Coalition, she was grabbed by an RUC officer and pulled into the middle of the police. Nelson reported to the Committee on the Administration of Justice that one of the officers said \"Rosemary you Fenian fucker\", spat in her face, and that the police pushed her around to the extent that she had bruises all over her arm, her right shoulder and her legs. The later Rosemary Nelson Inquiry concluded that her account of this incident was honest and truthful.\n\nIn 1998, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges and Solicitors, Param Cumaraswamy, noted threats from the RUC in his annual report, and stated in a television interview that he believed her life could be in danger. He made recommendations to the British government concerning threats from police against solicitors, which were not acted upon. Later that year, Nelson testified before a committee of the United States Congress investigating human rights in Northern Ireland, confirming that death threats had been made against her and her three children.\n\nNelson was assassinated, at the age of 40, by a car bomb outside her home in Lurgan, County Armagh, in 1999. The Red Hand Defenders claimed responsibility for the killing. She was survived by her husband and their three children.\n\nIn 2004, the Cory Collusion Inquiry recommended that the UK Government hold an inquiry into the circumstances of Nelson's death.\n\nThe resulting inquiry into her assassination opened at the Craigavon Civic Centre, Craigavon, County Armagh, in April 2005. In September 2006 the British Security Service MI5 announced it would be represented at the inquiry. This move provoked criticism from Nelson's family, who reportedly expressed concerns that MI5 would remove sensitive or classified information.\n\nThe results of the inquiry were published on 23 May 2011. The inquiry found no evidence that state agencies (the RUC, British Army and MI5) had \"directly facilitated\" her murder, but \"could not exclude the possibility\" that individual members had helped the perpetrators. It found that state agencies had failed to protect her and that some RUC intelligence about her had 'leaked'. Both of these, it said, increased the danger to her life. The report also stated that RUC officers had publicly abused and assaulted her in 1997, and made threatening remarks about her to her clients, which became publicly known. It concluded that this helped \"legitimise her as a target in the eyes of loyalist terrorists\".\n\n\n"}

It was included on Williams's debut solo album \"Life thru a Lens\" (1997)\",\" and released as a single in December 1997. \"Angels\" was written by Williams and Guy Chambers, based on an earlier song written by Ray Heffernan. It is Williams' best-selling single and was voted the best song of the previous 25 years at the 2005 Brit Awards.\n\n\"Angels\" has been covered by artists including Jessica Simpson, David Archuleta, Beverley Knight, All Angels and Declan Galbraith. It has been recorded in Spanish (as \"Ángel\") by Mexican singers Yuridia and Marco Moré, and in Italian (as \"Un Angelo\") by Patrizio Buanne. Williams also recorded a Spanish version of the song. In 2003, \"Q Magazine\" ranked \"Angels\" at number 237 in their list of the \"1001 Best Songs Ever\". In a 2005 poll, Britons voted it the song they most wanted played at their funeral.\n\nIn 2011, Robbie Williams said he wrote \"Angels\" with collaborator Guy Chambers in 25 minutes about his aunt and uncle. By his account, he and Chambers were sitting outside a cafe watching a water fountain, which inspired them to write the chorus. In 2016, Williams said: \"It was the first of our songs that we wrote together. We could tell and hoped and prayed that we got something incredibly special. After we wrote the song ... I hailed a cab down. [The taxi driver] played it and said 'that is great, that is, Robbie, 'that is gonna be number one', and you know what: it never was number one.\" Williams has expressed irritation that some assumed Chambers was the sole author, saying: \"It pees me off because everyone thinks Guy penned 'Let Me Entertain You' and 'Angels', but they're my songs.\"\n\nIrish singer-songwriter Ray Heffernan asserts that he wrote the first version of \"Angels\" in Paris in 1996, after his partner had a miscarriage. According to Heffernan, he met Williams in a pub by chance in Dublin. He showed him an incomplete version of the song, and that week the two recorded a studio demo. Williams confirmed that he had recorded a demo with Heffernan but said he rewrote the song significantly with Chambers.\n\nWhen Heffernan learnt that a version of \"Angels\" would appear on Williams' debut album \"Life thru a Lens\", he accepted an offer from Williams's management to buy the rights for £7,500. Heffernan is thanked in the UK CD2 single liner notes. Williams said: \"We could have gone to court, and it all would have been down to whether what way the judge wakes up that day out of bed ... So I gave him some money, and he went away.\" In 2011, Heffernan said: \"For a long time, I was angry about this, but as you get older you see things differently ... the 'Angels' connection has opened doors to publishing companies and earned me a few quid.\"\n\n\"Aberdeen Press and Journal\" wrote that \"Angels\" \"is perhaps the strongest cut\" from the \"Life thru a Lens\" album. Larry Flick from \"Billboard\" described the song as \"a sweet ballad that never gets sappy\". He noted that the \"production is first-rate, the lyric is thoughtful and ear-grabbing, and his smoky, crisp vocal is a sheer delight. All that and a chorus to kill for.\" \"Irish Independent\" called it an \"epic ballad\". \"Music & Media\" commented that \"with songs of the quality of Angels, Robbie Williams is on his way towards extending his audience by drawing in older listeners.\" They also added that the song \"distinguishes itself from its indie rock inspired predecessors Old Before I Die and Lazy Days by exchanging their guitars for a more mellow, piano-based arrangement.\" Dave Fawbert from \"ShortList\" called it a \"genuinely brilliant song\", adding that it has \"a pretty understated vocal from Robbie. Nothing too over the top, just sincere.\"\nThe video for \"Angels\" was directed by Vaughan Arnell, and filmed at Saunton Sands. Filmed largely from the air, Williams walks around a beach, stares at the sky, kicks a football and rides a motorbike with a woman while a helicopter flies around them.\n\nIn November 2013, English singer-songwriter Olly Murs released a music video promoting his song \"Hand on Heart\", imitating the video to \"Angels\". Also directed by Arnell, and shot in black-and-white, the video featured a cameo appearance by Williams. He said: \"Imitation is the highest form of flattery. I am easily flattered, and I love Olly. We always have a good time together and this was no exception.\"\n\n\"Angels\" was the 38th-bestselling single of 1997 in the UK, and the 26th of 1998. It was the 34th-bestselling single of the decade. Despite only reaching a peak of No. 4, it is Williams' bestselling UK single and according to Official UK Charts Company figures passed the million sales mark in June 2009, with a combination of both physical and download sales. It has sold 1.2 million copies in the UK as of November 2012. It was released in 1999 in the US, after Williams' debut there with \"Millennium\". \"Angels\" re-entered the ARIA Top 100 at #91, on 5 May 2008.\n\nAt the 2005 BRIT Awards, \"Angels\" was voted by the British public the best song in the past 25 years of British music, though it had only reached number four on the singles chart. Williams performed the song live with Joss Stone then. In a survey by UK digital TV station Music Choice, Britons chose it as the song they would most like played at their funeral.\n\nIn 2009, Williams performed \"Angels\" at the final of the sixth series of \"The X Factor\" with Olly Murs. On 14 June 2018, Williams performed \"Angels\" with Russian soprano Aida Garifullina at the 2018 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony held at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, Russia. On 23 June 2018, Williams performed the song as a special guest at American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift's Reputation Stadium Tour concert at Wembley Stadium in London.\n\n\n\nJessica Simpson's cover of \"Angels\" was the fourth and final single released from her album \"In This Skin\" in 2004. It was produced by Billy Mann.\n\nThe video for \"Angels\" opens a visibly anxious Simpson on an empty stage rehearsing for a performance. She can be seen in intercut scenes staring into space, as if she has lost her self-confidence and ability to perform. As the song progresses, however, white roses can be seen scattered around her as a sign of hope, and soon Simpson begins to regain her confidence. The song then shifts into its instrumental bridge to correlate with the emotions of the characters, as Simpson proceeds to climb to the top of the building for her final performance. There she is greeted by a youth orchestra, and finishes the song.\n\nSimpson's version of \"Angels\" failed to break into the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 (though it did reach number six on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles). However, the song did become a moderate success on the Top 40 Mainstream and Hot Digital Tracks charts. Both Simpson, and her father and manager Joe Simpson, had hoped this song would lead to her first Grammy nomination, as Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera, her 1990s rivals, had each already been nominated as well as winning. The song's downloads were not allowed to help it.\n\n\n\nIn 2005, Yuridia, former contestant of the popular Mexican show \"La Academia\", released \"Ángel\", a Spanish version of the song which she had interpreted during her stay in the reality show, as her debut and lead single. In Mexico, as well as in other parts of Latin America, \"Ángel\", became an instant hit, leading her debut album of almost the same name to achieve Diamond status in Mexico and becoming one of the most recent best selling Mexican singers and the best female Mexican seller of the past decade. The singer received two gold certifications for 20,000 copies sold in Mexico.\n\n\"Ángel\" reached 32 on the \"Billboard\" Hot Latin Songs chart and \"La Voz de un Angel\" managed to climb into the top 20 on the \"Billboard\" Hot Latin Albums chart, peaking at 16. In Mexico the song became the most successful song of 2005, leading the charts during 13 week.\n\nIn March 2006, British soul singer Beverley Knight recorded a live gospel version of \"Angels\". The track, performed live on BBC Radio 2 with musician Guy Chambers, was included on her \"Voice - The Best Of Beverley Knight\" album. The inclusion came after Knight performed the song at the Live 8 concerts in July 2005.\n\nIn December 2006, British classical crossover group All Angels released a cover version of Angels, with a classical touch to the song. Bookmakers put odds of 7-1 on them for getting a UK Christmas number-one single with their cover.\n\nThe single is the first ever Christmas single to be released in association with the Royal British Legion and their Poppy Appeal. Incidentally All Angels performed at the Festival of Remembrance (2006).\n\nCD single\n\nDavid Archuleta initially covered this song during the 7th series of \"American Idol\", in 2008. A studio version of this cover was produced and made available for purchase as a digital download exclusively via iTunes Store for a limited period.\n\nLater in that year, he decided to re-record the song, with a different arrangement and production, for his debut album. The version is also available for digital purchase since 27 October 2008, when it was released to help promote the pre-order of Archuleta's album.\n\n\nArchuleta's version of the song has become the second highest charting version in the United States after the original performed by Robbie Williams. It managed to enter the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 at #89 due to digital downloads. On the Canadian Hot 100 the song peaked at #64.\n\n"}

The infection occurs most commonly in tropical or subtropical climates, often in rural areas. It can be caused by many different types of fungi which become implanted under the skin, often by thorns or splinters. Chromoblastomycosis spreads very slowly; it is rarely fatal and usually has a good prognosis, but it can be very difficult to cure. The several treatment options include medication and surgery.\n\nThe initial trauma causing the infection is often forgotten or not noticed. The infection builds at the site over a period of years, and a small red papule (skin elevation) appears. The lesion is usually not painful, with few, if any symptoms. Patients rarely seek medical care at this point.\n\nSeveral complications may occur. Usually, the infection slowly spreads to the surrounding tissue while still remaining localized to the area around the original wound. However, sometimes the fungi may spread through the blood vessels or lymph vessels, producing metastatic lesions at distant sites. Another possibility is secondary infection with bacteria. This may lead to lymph stasis (obstruction of the lymph vessels) and elephantiasis. The nodules may become ulcerated, or multiple nodules may grow and coalesce, affecting a large area of a limb.\n\nChromoblastomycosis is believed to originate in minor trauma to the skin, usually from vegetative material such as thorns or splinters; this trauma implants fungi in the subcutaneous tissue. In many cases, the patient will not notice or remember the initial trauma, as symptoms often do not appear for years. The fungi most commonly observed to cause chromoblastomycosis are:\n\n\nOver months to years, an erythematous papule appears at the site of inoculation. Although the mycosis slowly spreads, it usually remains localized to the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Hematogenous and/or lymphatic spread may occur. Multiple nodules may appear on the same limb, sometimes coalescing into a large plaque. Secondary bacterial infection may occur, sometimes inducing lymphatic obstruction. The central portion of the lesion may heal, producing a scar, or it may ulcerate.\n\nThe most informative test is to scrape the lesion and add potassium hydroxide (KOH), then examine under a microscope. (KOH scrapings are commonly used to examine fungal infections.) The pathognomonic finding is observing medlar bodies (also called muriform bodies or sclerotic cells). Scrapings from the lesion can also be cultured to identify the organism involved. Blood tests and imaging studies are not commonly used.\n\nOn histology, chromoblastomycosis manifests as pigmented yeasts resembling \"copper pennies\". Special stains, such as periodic acid schiff and Gömöri methenamine silver, can be used to demonstrate the fungal organisms if needed.\nNo preventive measure is known aside from avoiding the traumatic inoculation of fungi. At least one study found a correlation between walking barefoot in endemic areas and occurrence of chromoblastomycosis on the foot.\n\nChromoblastomycosis is very difficult to cure. The primary treatments of choice are: \n\nOther treatment options are the antifungal drug terbinafine, another antifungal azole posaconazole, and heat therapy.\n\nAntibiotics may be used to treat bacterial superinfections.\n\nAmphotericin B has also been used.\n\nThe prognosis for chromoblastomycosis is very good for small lesions. Severe cases are difficult to cure, although the prognosis is still quite good. The primary complications are ulceration, lymphedema, and secondary bacterial infection. A few cases of malignant transformation to squamous cell carcinoma have been reported. Chromoblastomycosis is very rarely fatal.\n\nChromoblastomycosis occurs around the world, but is most common in rural areas between approximately 30°N and 30°S latitude. Madagascar and Japan have the highest incidence. Over two-thirds of patients are male, and usually between the ages of 30 and 50. A correlation with HLA-A29 suggests genetic factors may play a role, as well.\n\n"}

{"id": "2029175", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2029175", "title": "The Time Traveler's Wife", "text": "The Time Traveler's Wife\n\nThe Time Traveler's Wife is the debut novel of American author Audrey Niffenegger, published in 2003. It is a love story about a man with a genetic disorder that causes him to time travel unpredictably, and about his wife, an artist, who has to cope with his frequent absences and dangerous experiences. Niffenegger, frustrated in love when she began the work, wrote the story as a metaphor for her failed relationships. The tale's central relationship came to her suddenly and subsequently supplied the novel's title. The novel, which has been classified as both science fiction and romance, examines issues of love, loss, and free will. In particular, it uses time travel to explore miscommunication and distance in relationships, while also investigating deeper existential questions.\n\nThe book was published by MacAdam/Cage, a small publishing firm located in San Francisco, California. The book became a bestseller after an endorsement from author and family friend Scott Turow on \"The Today Show\", and as of March 2009 had sold nearly 2.5 million copies in the United States and the United Kingdom. Many reviewers were impressed with Niffenegger's unique perspectives on time travel. Some praised her characterization of the couple, applauding their emotional depth; others criticized her writing style as melodramatic and the plot as emotionally trite. The novel won the Exclusive Books Boeke Prize and a British Book Award. A film version was released in August 2009.\n\nUsing alternating first-person perspectives, the novel tells the stories of Henry DeTamble (born 1963), a librarian at the Newberry Library in Chicago, and his wife, Clare Anne Abshire (born 1971), an artist who makes paper sculptures. Henry has a rare genetic disorder, which comes to be known as Chrono-Impairment, that causes him to involuntarily travel through time. When 20-year-old Clare meets 28-year-old Henry at the Newberry Library in 1991 at the opening of the novel, he has never seen her before, although she has known him most of her life.\n\nHenry begins time traveling at the age of five, jumping forward and backward relative to his own timeline. When he leaves, where he goes, or how long his trips will last are all beyond his control. His destinations are tied to his subconscious—he most often travels to places and times related to his own history. Certain stimuli such as stress can trigger Henry's time traveling; he often goes jogging to keep calm and remain in the present. He searches out pharmaceuticals in the future that may be able to help control his time traveling. He also seeks the advice of a geneticist, Dr. Kendrick. Henry cannot take anything with him into the future or the past; he always arrives naked and then struggles to find clothing, shelter, and food. He amasses a number of survival skills including lock-picking, self-defense, and pickpocketing. Much of this he learns from older versions of himself.\n\nOnce their timelines converge \"naturally\" at the library—their first meeting in his chronology—Henry starts to travel to Clare's childhood and adolescence in South Haven, Michigan, beginning in 1977 when she is six years old. On one of his early visits (from her perspective), Henry gives her a list of the dates he will appear and she writes them in a diary so she will remember to provide him with clothes and food when he arrives. During another visit, he inadvertently reveals that they will be married in the future. Over time they develop a close relationship. At one point, Henry helps Clare frighten and humiliate a boy who abused her. Clare is last visited in her youth by Henry in 1989, on her eighteenth birthday, during which they make love for the first time. They are then separated for two years until their meeting at the library.\n\nClare and Henry marry, but Clare has trouble bringing a pregnancy to term because of the genetic anomaly Henry may presumably be passing on to the fetus. After six miscarriages, Henry wishes to save Clare further pain and has a vasectomy. However a version of Henry from the past visits Clare one night and they make love; she subsequently gives birth to a daughter, Alba. Alba is diagnosed with Chrono-Impairment as well but, unlike Henry, she has some control over her destinations when she time travels. Before she is born, Henry travels to the future and meets his ten-year-old daughter on a school field trip and learns that he dies when she is five years old.\n\nWhen he is 43, during what is to be his last year of life, Henry time travels to a Chicago parking garage on a frigid winter night where he is unable to find shelter. As a result of the hypothermia and frostbite he suffers, his feet are amputated when he returns to the present. Henry and Clare both know that without the ability to escape when he time travels, Henry will certainly die within his next few jumps. On New Year's Eve 2006 Henry time travels into the middle of the Michigan woods in 1984 and is accidentally shot by Clare's brother, a scene foreshadowed earlier in the novel. Henry returns to the present and dies in Clare's arms.\n\nClare is devastated by Henry's death. She later finds a letter from Henry asking her to \"stop waiting\" for him, but which describes a moment in her future when she will see him again. The last scene in the book takes place when Clare is 82 years old and Henry is 43. She is waiting for Henry, as she has done most of her life.\n\nNiffenegger is an artist who teaches at the Center for Book and Paper Arts at Columbia College Chicago, where she prepares editions of handpainted books. She produced some of her earlier works in editions of ten copies, which were sold in art galleries. However, she decided that \"The Time Traveler's Wife\" would have to be a novel: \"I got the idea for the title, and when I draw I have this big drawing table covered with brown paper, and I write ideas down on the paper. So I wrote down this title and after a while I started to think about it. I couldn't think of a way to make it a picture book because still pictures don't represent time very well, so I decided to write a novel.\" She was intrigued by the title because \"it immediately defined two people and their relationship to each other\". Niffenegger said that its source was an epigraph to J. B. Priestley's 1964 novel \"Man and Time\": \"Clock time is our bank manager, tax collector, police inspector; this inner time is our wife.\" Drawing her central theme from this image, she says, \"Henry is not only married to Clare; he's also married to time.\" Other authors whom Niffenegger has cited as influencing the book include Richard Powers, David Foster Wallace, Henry James, and Dorothy Sayers.\n\nShe has said the story is a metaphor for her own failed love affairs and that \"I had kind of got the idea that there's not going to be some fabulous perfect soulmate out there for me, so I'll just make him up.\" She also drew on her parents' marriage for inspiration—her father spent the bulk of each week traveling. Despite the story's analogies to her own life, Niffenegger has forcefully stated that Clare is not a self-portrait; \"She's radically different. I am much more willful and don't think I could go through a lifetime waiting for someone to appear, no matter how fascinating he was.\"\n\nNiffenegger began writing the novel in 1997; the last scene, in which an aged Clare is waiting for Henry, was written first, because it is the story's focal point. The narrative was originally structured thematically. Responding to comments from readers of early drafts of the manuscript, Niffenegger reorganized the narrative so that it largely followed Clare's timeline. The work was finished in 2001. With no history of commercial publication, Niffenegger had trouble finding interested literary agents—25 rejected the manuscript. In 2002, she sent it unsolicited to the small, San Francisco-based publisher MacAdam/Cage, where it reached Anika Streitfeld. Streitfeld, who became Niffenegger's editor, \"thought it was incredible. Right from the very beginning you feel like you are in capable hands, that this is someone who has a story to tell and who knows how to tell it.\" She gave it to David Poindexter, the founder of the publishing firm, \"who read it overnight and decided to buy the book\". However, Niffenegger had acquired an agent by this time, and several publishing houses in New York City were interested in the novel. The manuscript was put up for auction and MacAdam/Cage bid US$100,000, by far the largest sum it had ever offered for a book. Although another publisher outbid them, Niffenegger selected MacAdam/Cage because they were so dedicated to her work. Also, Niffenegger explains that her \"own natural inclination is to go small. My background is in punk music—I'd always pick the indie company over the giant corporation.\"\n\nReviewers have found \"The Time Traveler's Wife\" difficult to classify generically: some categorize it as science fiction, others as a romance. Niffenegger herself is reluctant to label the novel, saying she \"never thought of it as science fiction, even though it has a science-fiction premise\". In Niffenegger's view, the story is primarily about Henry and Clare's relationship and the struggles they endure. She has said that she based Clare and Henry's romance on the \"cerebral coupling\" of Dorothy Sayers's characters Lord Peter Wimsey and Harriet Vane.\n\nTime travel stories to which the novel has been compared include Jack Finney's \"Time and Again\" (1970) F.M. Busby's short story \"If This Is Winnetka, You Must Be Judy\" and the film \"Somewhere in Time\" (1980). Henry has been compared to Billy Pilgrim of Kurt Vonnegut's \"Slaughterhouse-Five\" (1969). Science fiction writer Terence M. Green calls the novel a \"timeslip romance\". \"The Time Traveler's Wife\" is not as concerned with the paradoxes of time travel as is traditional science fiction. Instead, as critic Marc Mohan describes, the novel \"uses time travel as a metaphor to explain how two people can feel as if they've known each other their entire lives\".\nRobert Nathan's \"Portrait of Jennie\", as novel, or film, is another obvious comparison, although Jennie, as a ghost, travels time in one direction, not randomly.\n\nNiffenegger identifies the themes of the novel as \"mutants, love, death, amputation, sex, and time\". Reviewers have focused on love, loss, and time. As Charlie Lee-Potter writes in \"The Independent\", the novel is \"an elegy to love and loss\". The love between Henry and Clare is expressed in a variety of ways, including through an analysis and history of the couple's sex life.\n\nWhile much of the novel shows Henry and Clare falling in love, the end is darker and \"time travel becomes a means for representing arbitrariness, transience, [and] plain bad luck\", according to \"The Boston Globe\"s Judith Maas. As Andrew Billen argues in \"The Times\", \"The book may even serve as a feminist analysis of marriage as a partnership in which only the male is conceded the privilege of absence.\" Several reviewers noted that time travel represents relationships in which couples cannot quite communicate with each other. Natasha Walter of \"The Guardian\" describes the story's attention to \"the sense of slippage that you get in any relationship—that you could be living through a slightly different love story from the one your partner is experiencing.\" She points, for example, to the section of the book which describes the first time Clare and Henry make love. She is 18 and he is 41, already married to her in his present. After this interlude, he returns to his own time and his own Clare, who says,\nThe novel raises questions about determinism and free will. For example, critic Dan Falk asks, \"Given that [Henry's] journey has 'already happened,' should he not simply be \"compelled\" to act precisely as he remembers seeing himself act? (Or perhaps he \"is\" compelled, and merely \"feels\" he has a choice...?).\" Although Henry seemingly cannot alter the future, the characters do not become \"cynical\" and, according to Lee-Potter, the novel demonstrates that people can be changed through love. Walter notes that there is a \"quasi-religious sense\" to the inevitability of Henry's and Clare's lives and deaths. Niffenegger, however, believes that the novel does not depict destiny but rather \"randomness and meaninglessness\".\n\nThe hardback edition of \"The Time Traveler's Wife\" was published in the United States in September 2003 by MacAdam/Cage and in the United Kingdom by Random House on 1 January 2004. MacAdam/Cage initiated an \"extensive marketing drive\", including advertising in \"The New York Times\" and \"The New Yorker\" and a promotional book tour by Niffenegger. As a result, the novel debuted at number nine on the \"New York Times\" bestseller list. After popular crime writer Scott Turow, whose wife is a friend of Niffenegger, endorsed it on \"The Today Show\", the first print run of 15,000 sold out and 100,000 more copies were printed. In Britain, the book received a boost from its choice as a \"Richard & Judy\" book club recommendation—nearly 45,000 copies were sold in one week. It was named the 2003 Amazon.com Book of the Year. A December 2003 article in \"The Observer\" reported that although \"a tiny minority of American reviewers\" felt that the novel was \"gimmicky\", it was still \"a publishing sensation\". At that point, the novel had been sold to publishers in 15 countries. As of March 2009, it had sold almost 1.5 million copies in the United States and 1 million in the United Kingdom. The success of \"The Time Traveler's Wife\" prompted almost every major publishing firm to attempt to acquire Niffenegger's second novel, \"Her Fearful Symmetry\", which has been called \"one of the most eagerly sought-after works in recent publishing history\". It garnered her an advance of US$5 million from Scribner's.\n\nReviewers praised Niffenegger's characterization of Henry and Clare, particularly their emotional depth. Michelle Griffin of \"The Age\" noted that although Henry \"is custom-designed for the fantasy lives of bookish ladies\", his flaws, particularly his \"violent, argumentative, depressive\" nature, make him a strong, well-rounded character. Charles DeLint wrote in \"The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction\" that one of Niffenegger's \"greatest accomplishments\" in the novel was her ability to convey the emotional growth of Clare and Henry in character arcs while at the same time alternating their perspectives. Stephen Amidon of \"The Times\", however, questioned the selfishness of the central characters.\n\nMost reviewers were impressed with the premise of the novel, but critical of its melodramatic style. While Griffin praised the plot and concept as \"clever\", she argued that Niffenegger's writing is usually \"pedestrian\" and the story at times contrived. Heidi Darroch of the \"National Post\" agreed, contending that the story has an excess of overwrought emotional moments \"which never quite add up to a fully developed plot\". Writing in \"The Chicago Tribune\", Carey Harrison praised the originality of the novel, specifically the intersection of child-bearing and time travel. Despite appreciating the novel's premise, Amidon complained that the implications of Henry's time-traveling were poorly thought out. For example, Henry has foreknowledge of the September 11 attacks but does nothing to try to prevent them. Instead, on 11 September 2001, he gets up early \"to listen to the world being normal for a little while longer\". Amidon also criticized the novel's \"overall clumsiness\", writing that Niffenegger is \"a ham-fisted stylist, long-winded and given to sudden eruptions of cliche\". Miriam Shaviv agreed to an extent, writing in \"The Jerusalem Post\", \"There are no original or even non-cliched messages here. True love, Niffenegger seems to be telling us, is timeless, and can survive even the worst yet, the book is a page-turner, delicately crafted and psychologically sound.\" The \"Library Journal\" described the novel as \"skillfully written with a blend of distinct characters and heartfelt emotions\"; it recommended that public libraries purchase multiple copies of the book.\n\nOn September 23, 2013 it was announced that a sequel to the novel is in the works. The sequel will focus on Henry and Clare's daughter Alba as an adult. She finds herself in love with two different men: Zach, a normal man, and Oliver, a musician and fellow time-traveler. The first 25 pages are currently available with the purchase of \"The Time Traveler's Wife\" eBook. In February 2014, Niffenegger estimated that the book \"should be ready in 2018 or so\".\nIn March 2017, Niffenegger stated on Twitter that the sequel would be called \"The Time Traveler’s Husband\" but didn't expect it to be released before 2019.\n\nBBC Audio published an audio book of \"The Time Traveler's Wife\" that was narrated by William Hope and Laurel Lefkow, described as \"feisty readers\" in one review.\n\nHighBridge also produced an unabridged version in 2003, which is twelve hours long and narrated by Maggi-Meg Reed and Christopher Burns; their performance has been described as \"sincere and passionate\".\n\nThe 2006 Audible/HighBridge version is narrated by Fred Berman and Phoebe Strole and is 17:43 in length.\n\nAudible.co.uk produced an unabridged version in 2008, also narrated by Hope and Lefkow.\n\nThe film rights for \"The Time Traveler's Wife\" were optioned by Brad Pitt's production company Plan B Entertainment, in association with New Line Cinema, before the novel was even published. The adaptation was written by Bruce Joel Rubin and directed by Robert Schwentke, and stars Rachel McAdams and Eric Bana. Filming began in September 2007 and the movie was released by Warner Bros. on 14 August 2009. When asked about the prospect of her novel being turned into a film, Niffenegger said, \"I've got my little movie that runs in my head. And I'm kind of afraid that will be changed or wiped out by what somebody else might do with it. And it is sort of thrilling and creepy, because now the characters have an existence apart from me.\" In general, the film received mixed-to-negative reviews. For example, \"The New York Times\" wrote that the film was an \"often ridiculous, awkward, unsatisfying and dour melodramatic adaptation\".\n\nIn July 2018, HBO secured the rights to adapt the novel into a television series to be written by Steven Moffat.\n"}

From 1851 the statue is kept in the Archaeological Museum of Kraków, however its copies are available in the Moscow Historical Museum, the Ternopil Regional Museum, and the Pochaiv Museum of Atheism.

The source of the river lies in a relative proximity to such other rivers as Horyn and Sluch and used to serve as an alternative route for the tradeway \"From the Varangians to Greeks\". Presumably the earliest name for the river was Boruch.\n\nIts international significance the river received following the first partition of Poland when between 1772 and 1793 the river was a border between Poland-Lithuania and Habsburg Monarchy. After the second partition of Poland in 1793–1807 and 1815–1918 the river was a border between the Austrian Galicia on one side and Imperial Russia on the other. During that time the river was also called Pidhirtsi. Following the Polish-Ukrainian Alliance of 1920 it was intended as the border between Poland and Ukraine. After the Treaty of Riga the Polish-Soviet border was established in the area, running along the river (this situation lasted until 1939).\n\n\nIt is 247 km in length and its drainage basin is 3,330 km². The average depth is 1.5-2 m. The width of the river is 8-11 m, the depth of the plains is 2.5-4 m. The channel has numerous meanders, there are borderlines, many islands and elders. The slope of the river is 0.8 m / km, the cross-sectional area is 22 m ², the flow rate is 0.57 m / s, the water flow is 15.54 m³ / sec.\n\n\nIn the upper reaches of the valley is small, its slopes are flattened, plowed. In the middle reaches, the valley is V-shaped (canyon-shaped), width 0.5-1.6 km, slopes steep, dissected by ravines and beams. Floodplain up to 80-100 m, sometimes absent, in the upper reaches up to 1-1,2 km, swampy; Belts narrow down to 80-120 m or less.\n\n"}

His father was a general in the Army who was arrested in WW2 by the British during the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran after attempting to form an armed resistance.\n\nAccording to Ali Razmjoo in \"Hezb-e-Pan-Iranist\", Forouhar was one of the founding members of the original nationalist Pan-Iranist Party of Iran in 1951 with Mohsen Pezeshkpour. During the Pahlavi era, he had been very active in the anti-Shah nationalist movement and was a strong supporter and close friend of the Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh. In the midst of post-revolutionary tensions in Iranian Kurdistan in 1979, Forouhar was part of a delegation sent by Tehran to negotiate with Kurdish political and religious leaders. Although this delegation's recommendations were never implemented by the central government and Kurdish revolt was dealt with harshly, Forouhar's attempts to reach a peaceful settlement with Kurds earned him respect among Kurds.\n\nForouhar served as minister of labor in the interim government of Mehdi Bazargan in 1979.\n\nForouhar and his wife, Parvaneh Eskandari Forouhar, were overt opponents of Velayet-e-Faqih (clerical theocracy) and under continuous surveillance. They were assassinated in their home in 1998. The murders, which are believed to have been politically motivated, remain unsolved, although the general belief is that the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence was involved and had ordered the killings.\nIt is thought that the murders were provoked by Forouhar's criticism of human rights abuses by the Islamic Republic in interviews with Western radio stations that beamed Persian-language programs to Iran. This \"brought them to the attention of Iran's ubiquitous intelligence service.\"\n\nUnder pressure from public opinion, the then Iranian president Mohammad Khatami formed a committee to follow up the case, which eventually asked for the resignation of the Minister of Intelligence, Ghorbanali Dorri-Najafabadi. One of the main characters behind the case, Saeed Emami, reportedly committed suicide while in prison.\n\nShirin Ebadi, the lawyer of the Forouhars' relatives quoting Parastou says: \"All evidence shows that my father was preparing himself to go to prison, because at the time of his slaying, his shoes had no laces, he did not wear his wrist watch and had his wallet emptied of its contents and papers except for some money.\"\n\nTheir murders brought to light a pattern known as the chain murders of Iran.\n\nForouhar had two children. Son, Arash, and daughter, Parastou, are both politically active and continue to raise awareness of the plight of political dissidents in Iran. In 2009, Parastou signed an open letter of apology posted to Iranian.com along with 266 other Iranian academics, writers, artists, journalists about the Persecution of Bahá'ís.\n\n"}

Prior to this, the only successful wheat-based cereal products had been Shredded Wheat and the hot semolina cereal, Cream of Wheat. The product was cheap to produce and kept well on store shelves.\n\nThe first advertising copy for the new product described the cereal as \"The Food That is all Food\", the advertising images showed rosy-cheeked children, and it was sold in a box decorated with images of muscular men wrestling with chains. Perhaps because it was not initially targeted at a well-defined market, it did not sell well.\n\nIn late 1901 Minnie Maud Hanff, a freelance jingle writer, invented the character Jimmy Dumps, a morose character who on eating the cereal was transformed into Sunny Jim. Dorothy Ficken produced line drawings, and Hanff produced lighthearted jingles describing Sunny Jim's transformation. The advertising appeared in magazines, on billboards, and on the sides of urban trolley cars from May 1902 through to the fall.\n\nThe campaign was wildly successful. Force was originally produced in a single plant in Buffalo, but by early 1904 the \"Canadian Grocer\" reported that there was one more Force food mill in Buffalo, a third mill in Chicago and one in Hamilton, Ontario, producing a total of 360,000 packages per day.\n\nEllsworth overextended and lost control of his companies in 1907. After that the Force cereal changed ownership frequently.\n\nIn 1903 a British subsidiary of the Force Food Company was formed to import the cereal to Europe. A slightly modified version of Sunny Jim and his jingles caught the fancy of British consumers. A. C. Fincken, a former employee of the Force Food Company, set up an agency in 1910 to import American cereals to the UK. The cereal, and the Sunny Jim character achieved wide success in Britain, at its peak in 1930 selling 12.5 million packages. In 1932 the cereal was reintroduced into the United States by Herbert C. Rice, an Englishman involved in radio production in Buffalo. He introduced The H-Bar-O Rangers, a popular radio adventure serial for boys involving another permutation of the Sunny Jim character, and linked to an advertising campaign for the cereal. It didn't last.\n\nIn 1940, Force sponsored The Adventures of Superman, a radio show which introduced key concepts to Superman like Kryptonite.\n\nSince 1954 the cereal was manufactured in the UK for domestic sale. A.C. Fincken & Co., Ltd. was sold to Rank Hovis McDougall, a subsidiary of the Nestle Company, in 1985. An unusual marketing campaign in the 1970s was focussed on the Ravenglass and Eskdale Railway: perhaps successful, but exposed to a very narrow market. A pre decimal coin collection was available with all 10 coins of ER2 including the farthing, circa 1986-88.\n\nManufacture of Force cereal ceased in 2013, the reason cited being poor sales, although in the last few years of production the cereal had been difficult to find due to having very few retail outlets, latterly only Sainsbury's, Waitrose and Ocado.\n\nSince then, the Force wheatflakes brand was revived for UK consumers, and was acquired by Nestlé. It was, but is no longer, for sale on the Waitrose website. \n\n"}

Glatt owned Treble Clef music stores, a chain of retail record stores, and was also a major local concert promoter.\n\nThe initial signal strength was 100,000 watts, and the first song was \"Isn't She Lovely\" by Stevie Wonder. The original morning show host was Mike O'Reilly, better known at the time as frontman in the rock group Bolt Upright and the Erections. Other early DJs included Geoff Winter, Steve Colwill, Sheryl Nicholson, Brian Murphy, Pierre Bourque, Paul Hunks, and Kathy Donovan. Ken Rockburn provided news and Randy Burgess did sports.\n\nThe station focused on the 18-34-year-old demographic by playing English progressive rock music. CHEZ also ran children's programming, talk programming and even some French programming when it first launched on air. Shows like \"CHEZ Ottawa\", \"The Source\", \"Jazz 106\", \"Medium Rare\" and \"In the City\" distinguished the station from others in the Ottawa market.\n\nDuring the first few years on air, CHEZ-FM competed with AM station CFRA, then a pop-leaning music station. In 1987, just a few weeks before celebrating its tenth anniversary on the air, CHEZ attained the number one position in the Ottawa market for the first time, with nearly 300,000 weekly listeners.\n\nCHEZ had two sister stations, CHEQ and CJET, under the umbrella of Rideau Broadcasting, located in Smiths Falls.\n\nIn 1994, CHEZ 106 shifted to classic rock, partly due competing station CJSB moving its active rock format from AM to FM.\n\nThe station and its holdings (Rideau Broadcasting), Canada's last major independent radio station, was sold to Rogers Radio in 1999, joining CKBY (Y105) and CIWW (1310 News) as Rogers-owned stations in the Ottawa market.\n\nIn 2011, CHEZ changed their slogan to \"World Class Rock\", and began adding more current rock music to its playlist, shifting towards a mainstream rock format. In March 2014, the station added more active rock music, and their slogan was changed again to \"Ottawa's Rock Station\" reflecting their competitor CKQB switching from active rock to a Top 40/CHR format.\n\nOn June 6, 2016, CHEZ 106 was rebranded to 106.1 CHEZ with a new logo and the station's new website was launched reflecting the change.\n\nIn June 2019, CHEZ announced the arrival of their new morning show, \"The Biggs and Barr Show\", which formerly aired on the St. Catharines ON Bell Media station CHTZ.

Masters' children went on to be notable figures in journalism, media and film making.\n\nOlga Masters was born in Pambula, New South Wales, the second of eight children. Her early life was characterised by the poverty of the depression era, her family moving around the South Coast region in search of work. Masters herself began working as a journalist at the age of 15 on the \"Cobargo Chronicle\", a weekly newspaper serving the south coastal area between Bega and Moruya.\nIn 1937, at the age of 18 she moved to Sydney, where she worked in office jobs and met Charles Masters, a teacher, whom she married in 1940. With him, she again travelled around country towns, including Grafton, Lismore and Urbenville, before returning to Sydney.\n\nMasters wrote as a journalist for most of her life, and supplemented the family income by writing for local newspapers in the towns she lived in with her husband. On their return to Sydney, she wrote for papers such as \"The Manly Daily\" and \"The Sydney Morning Herald\".\n\nWhile she wanted to write fiction from an early age, she was not published as a writer of fiction until the late 1970s. During this decade she wrote several radio plays, receiving many rejections, but on 29 April 1977, her radio play \"The Penny Ha-penny Stamp\" was broadcast. However, with the publication of her short story, \"Call me Pinkie\", in \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" in 1978, she moved from writing drama to prose fiction. Between 1979 and 1980, she won nine awards for her short stories. She wrote fiction full-time from 1982, after the publication of \"The Home Girls\".\n\nDue to her late start from age 58 and her relatively early death 11 years later, Masters' published output is small but her impact was disproportionate in that her style and writings about writing inspired many others to take up the craft.\n\nIn an interview, Masters described her fiction: \"All my writing is about human behaviour. There's not much drama, no great happenings in it. No violence. It's about the violence that's inside the human heart, I think, more than anything else\". In the same interview she also credits her journalistic career for helping her creative writing: \"you would sometimes take quite an ordinary and humble person and write a story about them, and you'd be surprised at the quality that there was in the ordinary human being ... I learned a lot about human nature, and human behaviour, as a journalist ... there is more in life, more in situations, than meets the eye\".\n\nWebby, in discussing \"The Home Girls\", states that her writing is not experimental, that its \"virtues are the classic ones of tight dramatic structure, strong characterisation and believable dialogue\". In listing her books for adults and senior students to read, Shapiro wrote that Masters \"has been called one of the best writers of fiction in Australia. Comedies of manners written with sensitivity, wit, and exuberance. Novels about mothers and daughters, fathers and sons. A very special novelist who only began writing novels and short stories in her fifties after raising a large family\".\n\n\n\n\nOlga and Charles had seven children:\n\nOlga Masters died of a brain tumour in Wollongong Hospital in 1986.\n\n\n"}

Formed in 1999 by former Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, the aim was to create a group of moderates to challenge Binyamin Netanyahu on the right and opposition leader Ehud Barak's Labor Party on the left.\nThe Center party platform promoted new thinking about national unity, leadership credibility and strategic planning and hoped to establish new institutional rules to guide public life, including a written constitution.\nThe party was established on 23 February 1999, towards the end of the 14th Knesset's term, by Mordechai, David Magen and Dan Meridor from Likud, Hagai Meirom and Nissim Zvili of Labor, and Eliezer Sandberg of Tzomet. However, the most significant ally for Mordechai was General Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, the just-retired army Chief-of-Staff who had been a bitter rival for that post in 1994.\n\nThe party borrowed many of its themes from The Third Way, a group that split with the Labor Party in 1994 over the latter's willingness to negotiate the return of the Golan Heights to Syria for a peace treaty. However, by 1999 The Third Way was a partner of the Likud government and had lost public support due to its lack of influence on Netanyahu. Mordechai wanted further progress in the Oslo Accords, and clashed with the prime minister and other members of his cabinet. \n\nBringing Dan Meridor on board was important. One of the Likud's younger members, Meridor had a solid record as minister of justice from 1988 until 1992, was the son of Irgun resistance member and later Knesset member Eliyahu Meridor, and was a civilian counterbalance to Mordechai.\n\nPrior to the 1999 elections the party changed its name to the \"Center Party\". Mordechai was also a candidate in the direct election for prime minister but dropped out when it became clear that Ehud Barak was rising in the polls. In the Knesset elections, the Center Party won roughly 5% of the vote, enough for 6 seats.\n\nThe party joined Ehud Barak's One Israel coalition alongside Shas, Meretz, the National Religious Party and Yisrael BaAliyah. Mordechai became Minister of Transport and Deputy Prime Minister, whilst Lipkin-Shahak became Minister of Tourism. Following Shas leaving the coalition in August 2000, former mayor of Tel Aviv, Roni Milo, was made Minister of Health. Mordechai resigned in the wake of a sex scandal on 30 May 2000; Lipkin-Shahak replaced him as Minister of Transport. Milo and former Likud member Yehiel Lasry defected back to Likud, and Rabin-Pelossof, Lipkin, and Uri Savir formed the New Way after Barak lost elections for prime minister to Ariel Sharon in 2001. By the end of the Knesset term only Meridor and Nehama Ronen remained in the faction. The party did not run in the 2003 elections.\n"}

Owned by Corus Entertainment, it broadcasts a Top 40/CHR format. CKQB's studios are located at 1504 Merivale Road in Nepean, Ontario along with sister station CJOT-FM, while its transmitter is located in Camp Fortune, Quebec.\n\nThe station was launched on August 31, 1982 by Standard Broadcasting at 540 AM, with the call sign CJSB and a power of 50,000 watts (daytime) and 10,000 watts (nighttime). The station was initially a mixture of MOR music and talk programming, then became an adult standards/easy listening (Music of Your Life) station, and in January 1987, evolved into a soft adult contemporary format with the brand name \"54 Lite Rock\".\n\nIn 1988, the station adopted a mainstream rock format and the brand name \"54 Rock\". In June 1989, the station's nighttime power was increased from 10,000 watts to 12,500 watts in an effort to extend their coverage area in the west-end of Ottawa. Through all the changes, the station continued to lose money hand over foot.\n\nIn 1993, after 11 years without a profit on AM, the station applied to move from the AM band to the FM band using the available 106.9 frequency that had been occupied by CKO from 1977 to 1989. This was the first time the CRTC had allowed a commercial station in a major market to switch from AM to FM.\n\nThe AM station signed off the air at 9 a.m. on August 31, 1994 and the FM station signed on at 6 p.m. on September 1, 1994 with the new brand name \"106.9 FM The Bear\" and changed its call sign to CKQB-FM. Darren Stevens became the first personality to be heard on the new station during a live broadcast from Minglewoods bar in the Byward Market.\n\nIn 2004, CKQB was given approval by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission to operate an FM transmitter at Pembroke on 99.7 MHz, to rebroadcast the programming of CKQB-FM's main station in Ottawa and provide better service to CKQB-FM's listeners in Pembroke and in the surrounding west Ottawa Valley area.\n\nThe station's music director, Kath Thompson, won the Canadian Music Industry Award for Music Director of the Year (Major Market) in 2007. On October 29, 2007, Astral Media took control of CKQB-FM as a result of its takeover of Standard Broadcasting.\n\nOn December 4, 2008, Astral Media announced that CKQB, along with sister stations CJFM-FM in Montreal and CKZZ-FM in Vancouver, would be rebranded as a Virgin Radio station in January 2009. This was in addition to an existing Virgin Radio station, CKFM-FM in Toronto. CKQB featured a \"re-energized\" rock format, as opposed to a hot adult contemporary format at the other Virgin Radio stations in Canada. The Toronto Virgin flipped to Top 40/CHR the following year.\n\nThe rebranding was completed at 4 p.m. on January 9, 2009. The first song after the relaunch was \"London Calling\" by The Clash. The station subsequently faced criticism for its inaugural promotional campaign, which featured images of pregnant young women accompanied by the slogan \"Lock up your daughters, the gods of rock are now in Ottawa.\" The station dropped the advertisements after a number of listeners filed complaints.\n\nOn August 26, 2009, Astral applied to change Pembroke's repeater frequency (CKQB-FM-1) from 99.7 to 99.9 MHz to mitigate interference due to the approval of Astral's new FM station in Ottawa at 99.7 MHz. The move to 99.9 FM received CRTC approval on October 14, 2009.\n\nCKQB-FM's studios are located at the broadcasting complex shared by its former sister station CJOH-TV, on Merivale Road in Nepean. On February 7, 2010, CJOH-TV's studios were gutted by a four-alarm fire in the pre-dawn hours; CKQB-FM's studios, located in a separate building, were not affected.\n\nIn 2010, following the reformatting of francophone station CFTX-FM as a mainstream rock station, CKQB included more active rock songs to its playlist. On February 4, 2011, the station dropped the Virgin branding, returning to its former Bear identity.\n\nIn March 2013, as part of Bell Media's acquisition of Astral Media, Corus Radio reached a tentative deal to acquire several radio stations, including CKQB, as part of an overall deal totalling $400.6 million. On January 28, 2014, the CRTC approved Corus's acquisition of CKQB-FM and sister station CJOT-FM. The acquisition was closed on January 31, 2014.\n\nOn March 6, 2014, Corus announced that CKQB would drop its rock format by the end of the month, promising a \"fresh, new direction\". The station would run jockless in the meantime, with no on-air staff. On March 28, 2014, CKQB began stunting with nature sounds and ambient chill music; three days later on March 31, CKQB flipped to CHR as \"Jump! 106.9\". The new format would compete primarily with the dominant CIHT, and Rogers' CISS-FM, contrasting their adult contemporary-leaning formats with a younger-skewing rhythmic direction, and a \"very strong\" social media presence.\n\nIn September 2018, CKQB laid off its morning hosts Jesse Reynolds and Jenna Mo, and announced that they would be replaced by the syndicated \"Brooke & Jubal\" (originating from KQMV in Seattle, Washington). Corus claimed that the change was intended to \"maximize how we deliver content to listeners and further position radio brands for the future\", but was widely criticized by listeners for replacing the local hosts with syndicated talent from the United States.\n\n\n"}

While O'Hearn's musical repertoire spans a diverse range of music, he is an acclaimed new-age artist in his solo career. In addition to solo albums, he has composed soundtracks for movies and television.\n\nBorn in Los Angeles, California and raised in the Pacific Northwest, O'Hearn began his professional music career at age 15 when he joined the Musicians Union and began playing night clubs in Portland, Oregon. Upon graduating from Sunset High School in 1972, he moved to Seattle, Washington. There, he briefly attended Cornish College of the Arts and, as well, studied privately with bassist Gary Peacock.\n\nIn 1973, he moved to San Francisco, California and soon became involved in the vibrant Bay Area jazz scene of that time, playing bass for well-established artists Charles Lloyd, Joe Henderson, Dexter Gordon, Joe Pass, Woody Shaw, Eddie Henderson, and Bobby Hutcherson, as well as with other like-aged young musicians, including Terry Bozzio, Mark Isham and Peter Maunu.\n\nWhile on tour in Los Angeles in 1976, O'Hearn met musician Frank Zappa, who offered him a job as bass player in his band—a position he held for over two years. During this period, O’Hearn shifted from the acoustic bass to the electric bass guitar (given the requirements of Zappa's arrangements), and also became increasingly interested in electronic music. Zappa encouraged O’Hearn to explore his premium collection of synthesizers, and also introduced him to the technical aspects of intricate physical tape editing as a way of producing compositions (in an era prior to home computers), audio engineering, and home studio audio recording equipment.\n\nIn 1979, O'Hearn teamed with trumpet player Mark Isham and guitarist Peter Maunu to form Group 87, an ensemble influenced by the early recordings of Weather Report, Kraftwerk and ambient minimalism of Brian Eno. Although they only produced two LPs—\"Group 87\" in 1980, and \"A Career in Dada Processing\" in 1984—Group 87 would help establish the musical direction of O'Hearn's solo career. Both Isham and Maunu would continue as important collaborators on several of O'Hearn's subsequent solo releases.\n\nIn 1981, drummer and former Zappa bandmate Terry Bozzio invited O’Hearn to join his emerging new wave band, Missing Persons along with guitarist and fellow Zappa alumnus Warren Cuccurullo and Dale Bozzio, who had performed vocals in several Zappa productions and recently married Terry. The nature of the music called for O'Hearn to make a further shift—this time, from electric bass to synthesizers. Missing Persons recorded three albums for Capitol Records: \"Spring Session M\" (1982), \"Rhyme & Reason\" (1984), and \"Color In Your Life\" (1986). The band dissolved in early 1986; subsequently, O'Hearn joined with former Duran Duran guitarist Andy Taylor and former Sex Pistols guitarist Steve Jones for one album, \"Thunder\" (1987), and a brief tour. Although both Terry Bozzio and Warren Cuccurullo later contributed to several of O'Hearn's solo albums, O'Hearn declined to take part in the 2001 Missing Persons reunion.\n\nO'Hearn's solo career was spurred in large part by former Tangerine Dream member Peter Baumann, who had been conceiving of a new music label that would showcase progressive instrumental music—a niche earlier explored by Group 87. Baumann formed the Private Music label in late 1984, and signed O'Hearn as a charter artist (with Mahavishnu Orchestra violinist Jerry Goodman, Roxy Music keyboardist Eddie Jobson, and later, new-age notables Yanni and Suzanne Ciani), and produced O'Hearn's debut solo album, \"Ancient Dreams\" (1985).\n\nSignature elements readily manifest in \"Ancient Dreams\": found percussion instruments, hypnotic bass guitar patterns, synthesized pads, and minimalist harmonies. Perhaps biased by his preferred instrument, O'Hearn often adds jazz elements, particularly in his frequent use of the bass guitar (often a fretless bass) as the lead voice.\n\nO'Hearn followed \"Ancient Dreams\" with two more albums—\"Between Two Worlds\" (1987), which earned the artist his first Grammy nomination, and \"Rivers Gonna Rise\" (1988). Notably, the albums gradually became brighter in tone as O'Hearn began to receive greater airplay on jazz and new-age radio stations. O'Hearn also co-produced several tracks for guitarist Colin Chin's \"Intruding on a Silence\", featuring Mark Isham on trumpet - as such, the output strongly echoes Group 87's earlier work.\n\nThe fourth album, \"Eldorado\" (1989), ventured decidedly into the world music genre, infusing O'Hearn's signature sound with rhythms and timbres drawn from disparate sources such as South America and the Middle East. As such, O'Hearn's arrangements accommodated a wider array of instrumentation, such as human singing and the solo violin (most notably on \"Black Delilah\".) Commercially, \"Eldorado\" performed well among new-age audiences; some tracks remain popular on jazz stations today.\n\nIn 1990, Private Music, O'Hearn's record label at the time, released an album of techno remixes aptly named \"Mix-Up\", featuring contributions from popular music producers, including David Frank, Joe \"The Butcher\" Nicolo, and Carmen Rizzo Jr. However, \"Mix-Up\" was panned by critics and fans, and remains long out of print. The album was the brainchild of the A&R department of Private Music and was released without Patrick knowing about it. He had only agreed to allow some remixes of his material to be experimented with in European dance clubs, and the first he knew of the album's release was when it was in the stores. The versions of the tracks are vastly different from what O'Hearn had originally produced.\n\nYet another major turning point in O'Hearn's music career was marked with the release of \"Indigo\" (1991). Ostensibly billed by the label as being \"In the tradition of \"Ancient Dreams\"\", O'Hearn downplayed the use of synthesizers and instead focused on manipulating space, acoustics, and textures to create an album with a cohesive consistency of tone.\n\nAs O'Hearn's tenure with Private Music was ending, a compilation album representing their years together was released in 1992, titled \"The Private Music of Patrick O'Hearn.\" This album included three previously unreleased tracks titled \"Down Hill Racer\", \"Irene\", and \"Step\".\n\nIn 1992, O'Hearn composed and performed the music score for \"White Sands,\" a police thriller starring Willem Dafoe and Samuel L. Jackson. The film was directed by Roger Donaldson. Later that year he composed the score to \"Silent Tongue\", written and directed by Sam Shepard and starring Alan Bates, Richard Harris, River Phoenix and Dermot Mulroney.\n\nAfter a four-year absence of solo album recording, a period primarily focused on composing film scores, O'Hearn released \"Trust\" in 1995 under the newly formed Deep Cave record label. Featuring contributions from David Torn and former bandmates Terry Bozzio and Warren Cuccurullo, \"Trust\" earned O'Hearn his second Grammy nomination. Shortly after the release of his next album, \"Metaphor\" (1996), the Deep Cave record label folded. Also released in 1996 was the soundtrack to the film \"Crying Freeman,\"\n\nThere have been a few various artists albums that O'Hearn has contributed new material to. In 1998, his 12-minute composition \"35th Parallel\" appeared on the five-artist album \"The Ambient Expanse\". In 2000, his version of a Johann Sebastian Bach piece called \"Prelude from Cello Suite No. 1\" appeared on the compilation \"A Different Prelude: A Contemporary Collection\". In 2003 his version of the Joaquín Rodrigo composition \"Adagio from Fantasy for a Gentleman\" appeared on the compilation \"Adagio: A Windham Hill Collection\". This last track can also be found on the various artists compilation \"Sundown: Windham Hill Piano Collection\", released in 2006.\n\nO'Hearn's next solo project, \"So Flows the Current\" (2001), was recorded over a three-year period from 1997 to 2000. The album saw O'Hearn move away from the MIDI-centric style of music production and performance, relying more on musicians playing live together in the studio. The result is an album of earthy and atmospheric music, and which yielded a subsequent album in 2006.\n\nIn 2002, cinematographer David Fortney created a film of spectacular landscape images, assembled together with some of his favorite Patrick O'Hearn music. The result was \"Timeless - A National Parks Odyssey\" which was released on DVD in 2003. This also includes a new version of the track \"Beauty In Darkness,\" originally from O'Hearn's debut album.\n\n\"Beautiful World\" was O'Hearn's next release in 2003, and it was voted the No. 1 album on the nationally syndicated radio program \"Echoes\". This was followed by \"Slow Time\" in 2005, which marked a departure for O'Hearn, in that he ventured into the experimental realm characterized by musical movements of the 20th century, including references to Steve Roach and Pierre Boulez.\n\nIn 2006, O'Hearn released three recordings via iTunes online delivery only. The first two of these were the soundtrack EP to Sean Garland's short film \"The Wheelhouse\" and the soundtrack to the Sam Shepard play \"Simpatico\" (originally recorded in 1994). These were shortly followed by \"The So Flows Sessions\", which was previously unreleased material from the same recording sessions in 1997–2000 that produced \"So Flows The Current\".\n\nThe next year in 2007 O'Hearn released the CD \"Glaciation\", inspired by images of Earth's Arctic regions. In the summer of 2007, O'Hearn was introduced to singer-songwriter John Hiatt and played bass on Hiatt's \"Same Old Man\" album. Hiatt subsequently asked him to join his band and tour in support of the album's 2008 release. O'Hearn continued to tour with Hiatt through 2010 and recorded on his following releases: \"The Open Road\" (2010), \"Dirty Jeans and Mudslide Hymns\" (2011), and \"Mystic Pinball\" (2012).\n\nO'Hearn's 13th album \"Transitions\" was released digitally on August 23, 2011, and on CD on October 4. It was voted No.1 album of 2011 on the \"Echoes\" Listener's Poll.\n\nIn December 2013, a various artists album titled \"Nashville Indie Spotlight\" was released, which includes a new piece by Patrick O'Hearn and Peter Maunu called \"Out of Reach\". It is a slow, atmospheric blend of acoustic guitar, double bass and keyboards.\n\nHis daughter, Rachel, is an electronic musician, performing under the names Chromatiq, and Black Sound Effects.\n\n\n"}

In his third game as a professional soccer player, Torres scored a spectacular goal against Chivas which tied the game 1–1. The following season, Leo Beenhakker became the new coach of Club América and he relegated Torres. He did not play a single minute. Clausura 2004 was not much better as Torres only made 2 appearances for a total of 33 minutes.\n\nApertura 2004 brought a new hope for Torres.

{"id": "2029255", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2029255", "title": "System Restore", "text": "System Restore\n\nSystem Restore is a feature in Microsoft Windows that allows the user to revert their computer's state (including system files, installed applications, Windows Registry, and system settings) to that of a previous point in time, which can be used to recover from system malfunctions or other problems. First included in Windows ME, it has been included in all following desktop versions of Windows released since, excluding the Windows Server.In Windows 10, System Restore is turned off by default and must be enabled by users in order to function. This does not affect personal files such as documents, music, pictures, and videos.\n\nIn prior Windows versions it was based on a file filter that watched changes for a certain set of file extensions, and then copied files before they were overwritten. An updated version of System Restore introduced by Windows Vista uses the Shadow Copy service as a backend (allowing block-level changes in files located in any directory on the volume to be monitored and backed up regardless of their location) and allows System Restore to be used from the Windows Recovery Environment in case the Windows installation no longer boots at all.\n\nIn System Restore, the user may create a new \"restore point\" manually (as opposed to the system creating one automatically), roll back to an existing restore point, or change the System Restore configuration. Moreover, the restore itself can be undone. Old restore points are discarded in order to keep the volume's usage within the specified amount. For many users, this can provide restore points covering the past several weeks. Users concerned with performance or space usage may also opt to disable System Restore entirely. Files stored on volumes not monitored by System Restore are never backed up or restored.\n\nSystem Restore backs up system files of certain extensions (.exe, .dll, etc.) and saves them for later recovery and use. It also backs up the registry and most drivers.\n\nStarting with Windows Vista, System Restore takes a snapshot of all volumes it is monitoring. However, on Windows XP, it only monitors the following:\n\nThe list of file types and directories to be included or excluded from monitoring by System Restore can be customized on Windows Me and Windows XP by editing \"%windir%\\system32\\restore\\Filelist.xml\".\n\nThe amount of disk space System Restore consumes can be configured. Starting with Windows XP, the disk space allotted is configurable per volume and the data stores are also stored per volume. File are stored using NTFS compression and a Disk Cleanup handler allows deleting all but the most recent Restore Point to free up disk space. System Restore can be disabled completely to regain disk space. It automatically disables itself if the disk free space is too low for it to operate.\n\nWindows creates restore points:\n\n\nWindows XP stores restore-point files in a hidden folder named \"System Volume Information\" on the root of every drive, partition or volume, including most external drives and some USB flash drives.\n\nThe operating system deletes older restore points per the configured space constraint on a first in, first out basis.\n\nThere are considerable differences between how System Restore works under Windows XP and later Windows versions.\n\n\nUp to Windows XP, the system can be restored as long as it is in an online state, that is, as long as Windows boots normally or from \"Safe mode\". It is not possible to restore the system if Windows is unbootable without using a 3rd-party bootable recovery media such as ERD Commander. Under Windows Vista and later, the Windows Recovery Environment can be used to launch System Restore and restore a system in an offline state, that is, in case the Windows installation is unbootable. Since the advent of Microsoft Desktop Optimization Pack, Diagnostics and Recovery Toolset from it can be used to create a bootable recovery disc that can log on to an unbootable Windows installation and start System Restores. The toolset includes ERD commander for Windows XP that was previously a 3rd-party product by Wininternals.\n\nA limitation which applies to System Restore in Windows versions prior to Windows Vista is that only certain file types and files in certain locations on the volume are monitored, therefore unwanted software installations and especially in-place software upgrades may be incompletely reverted by System Restore. Consequently, there may be little or no practical beneficial impact. Certain issues may also arise when attempting to run or completely uninstall that application. In contrast, various other utilities have been designed to provide much more complete reversal of system changes including software upgrades. However, beginning with Windows Vista, System Restore monitors all system file types on all file paths on a given volume, so there is no issue of incomplete restoration.\n\nIt is not possible to create a permanent restore point. All restore points will eventually be deleted after the time specified in the RPLifeInterval registry setting is reached or earlier if allotted disk space is insufficient. Even if no user or software triggered restore points are generated allotted disk space is consumed by automatic restore points. Consequently, in systems with little space allocated, if a user does not notice a new problem within a few days, it may be too late to restore to a configuration from before the problem arose.\n\nFor data integrity purposes, System Restore does not allow other applications or users to modify or delete files in the directory where the restore points are saved. On NTFS volumes, the Restore Points are protected using ACLs. Since its method of backup is fairly simplistic, it may end up archiving malware such as viruses, for example in a restore point created before using antivirus software to clean an infection. Antivirus software is usually unable to remove infected files from System Restore; the only way actually to delete the infected files is to disable System Restore, which will result in losing all saved restore points; otherwise they will remain until Windows deletes the affected restore points. However stored infected files in themselves are harmless unless executed; they will only pose a threat if the affected restore point is reinstated. Windows System Restore is not compatible with restore points made by third party applications.\n\nChanges made to a volume from another OS (in case of dual-boot OS scenarios) cannot be monitored. In addition, dual-booting different versions of Windows can disrupt the operation of System Restore. Specifically, Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 delete the checkpoints created by Windows Vista and later. Also, checkpoints created by Windows 8 may be destroyed by previous versions of Windows.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2029256", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2029256", "title": "CKKL-FM", "text": "CKKL-FM\n\nCKKL-FM (93.9 FM) is a radio station in Ottawa. Owned by Bell Media, it broadcasts a country music format branded as Pure Country 94. CKKL's studios are located in the Bell Media Building on George Street in Downtown Ottawa's ByWard Market, while its transmitter is located in Camp Fortune, Quebec.\n\nFrank Ryan originally launched the station in 1947 as CFRA-FM, simulcasting the programming of its AM sister station. In 1959, the station began airing some separate programming. In 1961, Ryan sought approval to increase power from 860 watts to 146,000 watts via a new transmission site at Camp Fortune. The Ryan Tower would become the area's main radio and television transmission site. Two years later, in 1961, the station's programming became fully independent of CFRA's, and the station adopted the callsign CFMO. CFRA and CFMO were subsequently acquired by CHUM Limited in 1968.\n\nThe station manager at the time was veteran broadcaster Gord Atkinson, well known to Ottawa listeners. The music director was Ray Eckford. Announcers included: John Cavill and Bryan Williams (mornings) as well as Jim Bristow and Dick Richards (whose real name was Richard \"Dick\" Gasparini from CKWW and CKCY-FM) in the evenings. The station's MOR format included an unwavering diet of traditional artists such as Bing Crosby (a personal favourite of Atkinson's), Mantovani, Peggy Lee, Ronnie Aldrich, the Somerset Strings, Frank Sinatra and others of the same genre.\n\nCHUM dropped the station's longtime easy listening format on August 28, 1992, adopting the CKKL-FM calls and the brand name Kool FM for its new Hot AC format. The first song was \"Time, Love & Tenderness\" by Michael Bolton. The CFMO calls and format were picked up by CHEZ-FM Inc., and adopted on what is now CKBY. During their Hot AC days, they aired mostly CHR music during the evening hours (in large part due to CRTC regulations banning FM stations for having more than 50% of hit material on their playlists to protect AM stations and French-language stations), as well as the dance music show \"Pirate Radio\" with Chris Sheppard on Saturday nights. During the 1990s, CKKL competed against Top 40 stations CKTF-FM (which airs in French) and AM station Energy 1200 (which aired in English). Station liners during this time promoted \"Hit Music on FM,\" directly targeting Energy 1200 listeners. After \"Energy\" flipped to alternative rock in 1997, CKKL was considered the default English-language hit music station in Ottawa. By February 2003, when CIHT-FM (now a CHR station) launched with its Rhythmic CHR format, CKKL completely shifted to CHR.\n\nOn May 31, 2003, at 9:39 AM, CKKL-FM dropped its CHR format, and began stunting with the audio from the movie \"What About Bob?.\" After the movie aired, snippets of music played, with Bob FM launching at Noon that day, adopting the adult hits format. The first song on \"Bob\" was \"I Want A New Drug\" by Huey Lewis and The News.\n\nBob FM's morning show, Cub & Company, was hosted by Cub Carson and Melanie Adams, and until February 2013, Sandy Sharkey. The show was formerly hosted by \"Stuntman\" Stu Schwartz, who is now at CJMJ-FM.\n\nIn 2007, CTVglobemedia bought CKKL-FM along with the other CHUM Limited properties. In 2011, Bell Canada acquired CTVglobemedia, renaming the company as Bell Media.\n\nOn February 1, 2013, Bell Media announced that longtime Bob FM announcers Steve Gregory and Sandy Sharkey were leaving the station as a result of cuts.\nOn November 10, 2014, Bell Media announced that the Bob FM format would be discontinued, citing changing \"market conditions\" and the need to \"pursue a new opportunity\". All of the station's on-air talent, including Cub Carson, were laid off, and the station began airing blocks of music punctuated by promos announcing an impending relaunch. Its website referred Bob FM listeners to the online stream of sister station CJPT-FM. On November 12, 2014 at 11:45 a.m., after playing \"Like a Virgin\" by Madonna, CKKL went into a 15-minute stunt of a ticking clock. At Noon, CKKL flipped to country music as \"New Country 94\"—launching with a marathon of 10,000 songs played commercial-free.\n\nOn May 28, 2019, the station was renamed \"Pure Country\" as part of a nationwide rebranding.\n\n"}
{"id": "2029258", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2029258", "title": "Embioptera", "text": "Embioptera\n\nThe order Embioptera, commonly known as webspinners or footspinners, are a small group of mostly tropical and subtropical insects, classified under the subclass Pterygota. The order has also been called Embiodea or Embiidina. More than 400 species in 11 families have been described, the oldest known fossils of the group being from the mid-Jurassic. Species are very similar in appearance, having long, flexible bodies, short legs, and only males having wings.\n\nWebspinners are gregarious, living subsocially in galleries of fine silk which they spin from glands on their forelegs. Members of these colonies are often related females and their offspring; adult males do not feed and die soon after mating. Males of some species have wings and are able to disperse, whereas the females remain near where they were hatched. Newly-mated females may vacate the colony and found a new one nearby. Others may emerge to search for a new food source to which the galleries can be extended, but in general, the insects rarely venture from their galleries. \n\nThe name Embioptera (\"lively wings\") comes from Greek (), meaning \"lively\", and (), meaning \"wing\", a name that has not been considered to be particularly descriptive for this group of fliers, perhaps instead referring to their remarkable speed of movement both forward and backward. The common name \"webspinner\" comes from the insects' unique tarsi on their front legs, which produce multiple strands of silk. They use the silk to make web-like galleries in which they live.\n\nEarly entomologists considered the webspinners to be a group within the termites or the neuropterans and a variety of group names have been suggested including Adenopoda, Embidaria, Embiaria, and Aetioptera. In 1909 Günther Enderlein used the name Embiidina which was used widely for a while. Edward S. Ross suggested a new name, Embiomorpha in 2007. The currently most-widely accepted ordinal name is Embioptera, suggested by Arthur Shipley in 1904.\n\nFossils of webspinners are rare. The group probably first appeared during the Jurassic; the oldest known, \"Sinembia rossi\" and \"Juraembia ningchengensis\", both in a new family Sinembiidae created for them, are from the Middle Jurassic of Inner Mongolia, and were described in 2009. The female of \"J. ningchengensis\" had wings, supporting Ross's proposal that both sexes of ancestral Embioptera were winged. \nSpecies such as \"Atmetoclothoda orthotenes\", possibly the first fossil member of the Clothodidae to be discovered, sometimes thought to be a \"primitive\" family, have been found in mid-Cretaceous amber from northern Myanmar. \"Litoclostes delicatus\" (Oligotomidae) has been found in the same locality. \nThe largest number of fossils have been found in mid-Eocene Baltic amber and early-Miocene Dominican amber. Flattened compression fossils that have been interpreted as being webspinners have been found from the Eocene/Oligocene shales of Florissant, Colorado.\n\nOver 400 embiopteran species in 11 families have been described worldwide, the largest proportion of which inhabit tropical regions. It is estimated that there may be around 2000 species extant today.\n\nThe external phylogeny of Embioptera has been debated, with the polyneopteran order controversially classed in 2007 as a sister group to both Zoraptera (angel insects) and Phasmatodea (stick insects). The position of the Embioptera within the Polyneoptera suggested by a phylogenetic analysis carried out in 2012 by Miller et al., combining morphological and molecular evidence, is shown in the cladogram.\nThe internal phylogeny of the group is not yet fully resolved. Miller et al.'s phylogenetic analysis examined 96 morphological characters and 5 genes for 82 species across the order. Four families were found to be robustly monophyletic in whatever way the phylogeny was analysed (parsimony, maximum likelihood, or Bayesian): Clothodidae, Anisembiidae, Oligotomidae, and Teratembiidae. The Embiidae, Scelembiidae, and Australembiidae remain monophyletic in one or more of the three analyses, but are broken up in others, so their status remains uncertain. Either the Clothodidae (under parsimony analysis) or Australembiidae (under Bayesian analysis) is the sister taxon to the remaining Embioptera taxa, so no single phylogenetic tree can be taken as definitive from this work.\n\nAll webspinners have a remarkably similar body form, although they do vary in coloration and size. The majority are brown or black, ranging to pink or reddish shades in some species, and range in length from . The body form of these insects is completely specialised for the silk tunnels and chambers in which they reside, being cylindrical, long, narrow and highly flexible. The head has projecting mouthparts with chewing mandibles. The compound eyes are kidney-shaped, there are no ocelli, and the thread-like antennae are long, with up to 32 segments. The antennae are flexible, so they do not become entangled in the silk, and the wings have a crosswise crease, allowing them to fold forwards and enable the male to dart backwards without the wings snagging the fabric.\n\nThe first segment of the thorax is small and narrow, while the second and third are larger and broader, especially in the males, where they include the flight muscles. All the females and nymphs are wingless, whereas adult males can be either winged or wingless depending on species. The wings, where present, occur as two pairs that are similar in size and shape: long and narrow, with relatively simple venation. These wings operate using basic hydraulics; pre-flight, chambers (sinus veins) within the wings inflate with hemolymph (blood), making them rigid enough for use. On landing, these chambers deflate and the wings become flexible, folding back against the body. Wings can also fold forwards over the body, and this, along with the flexibility allows easy movement through the narrow silk galleries, either forwards or backwards, without resulting in damage.\n\nIn both males and females the legs are short and sturdy, with an enlarged basal tarsomere on the front pair, containing the silk-producing glands; the mid and hind legs also have three tarsal segments with the hind femur enlarged to house the strong tibial depressor muscles that enable rapid reverse movement. It is these silk glands on the front tarsi that distinguish the embiopterans; other noteworthy characteristics of this group include three-jointed tarsi, simple wing venation with few cross veins, prognathous (head with forward-facing mouthparts), and absence of ocelli (simple eyes).\n\nThe abdomen has ten segments, with a pair of cerci on the final segment. These cerci, made up of two segments and asymmetric in length especially in the males are highly sensitive to touch, and allow the animal to navigate while moving backwards through the gallery tunnels, which are too narrow to allow the insect to turn round. Because morphology is so similar between taxa, species identification is extremely difficult. For this reason, the main form of taxonomic identification used in the past has been close observation of distinctive copulatory structures of males, (although this method is now thought by some entomologists and taxonomists as giving insufficient classification detail). Although males never eat during their adult stage, they do have mouthparts similar to those of the females. These mouthparts are used to hold onto the female during copulation.\n\nThe eggs hatch into nymphs that resemble small, wingless adults. After a short period of parental care, the nymphs undergo hemimetabolosis (incomplete metamorphosis), moulting a total of four times before reaching adult form. Adult males never eat, and leave the home colony almost immediately to find a female and mate. Those males that cannot fly often mate with females in nearby colonies, meaning their chosen mates are often siblings or close relatives. In some species, the female eats the male after mating, but in any event, the male does not survive for long. A few species are parthenogenetic, meaning they can produce viable offspring without fertilisation of the eggs. This phenomenon occurs when a female is, for whatever reason, unable to find a male to mate with, thus giving her and her species reproductive security at all times. \nAfter moulting and mating, the female lays a single batch of eggs either within the existing gallery, or wanders away to start a new colony elsewhere. Because the females are flightless, their potential for dispersal is limited to the distance a female can walk.\n\nMost, if not all, embiopteran species are gregarious but subsocial. Typically, adult females show maternal care of their eggs and young, and often live in large colonies with other adult females, creating and sharing the webbing cover that helps to protect them against predators. The advantages of living in these colonies outweigh the disadvantage that results from the increased parasite load that this lifestyle entails. Although some species breed once a year, or even once in two years, others breed more frequently, with \"Aposthonia ceylonica\" producing four or five batches of eggs in a twelve-month period.\n\nMaternal care starts with the placement of the eggs. Some species attach batches of eggs to the web structure with silk; others form the eggs into rows in grooves excavated in the bark; others fix them in rows with a cement formed from saliva, while many species bury them in a mass of silk, even incorporating other materials into the covering. The majority of embiopterans guard their eggs, some actually standing over them, the main exception being species such as \"Saussurembia calypso\" that scatter their eggs widely. The main threat to the eggs is from egg parasitoids, which can attack whole batches of undefended eggs. At this time the adult females become very territorial and aggressive to other individuals with whom they previously lived in harmony; three different types of vibratory signals are used to deter other embiopterans that approach the eggs too closely, and the intruder usually retires.\n\nAfter the eggs have hatched, the mothers resume their gregarious behaviour. In some species, they continue caring for their young for several days after hatching, and in a few, this parental care even involves the female feeding the nymphs with portions of chewed-up leaf litter and other foods. The parthenogenetic \"Rhagadochir virgo\" incorporates scraps of lichen into the silk wrapping the eggs, and this may be eaten by newly hatched nymphs. Perhaps because individuals of this species are so closely related, the adults spin silk together and move around in coordinated groups. Even in species that provide no further parental care, the nymphs in the colony benefit from the greater silk-producing power of the adults and the extra protection that the more copious silk covering brings.\n\nSubsociality is a trade-off for the female, as the energy and time that is exerted in caring for her young is rewarded by giving them a much greater chance of surviving and carrying on her genetic lineage. Some species do share galleries with more than one adult, however, most groups consist of one adult female and her offspring.\n\nWhen webspinners clean their antennae, they may differ in their behavior from other insects which typically make use of the forelegs to either clean or bring the antennae toward the mouthparts for manipulation. Webspinners (as observed in the genus \"Oligembia\") instead fold the antennae under the body and clean the antennae as they are held between the mouthparts and the substrate.\n\nWhen constructing their silken galleries, webspinners use characteristic cyclic movements of their forelegs, alternating actions with the left and right legs while also moving. There are variations in the choreography of these movements across species.\n\nEmbiopterans produce a silk thread similar to that produced by the silkworm, \"Bombyx mori\". The silk is produced in spherical secretory glands in the swollen tarsi (lower leg segments) of the forelimbs, and can be produced by both adults and larvae. Unlike \"Bombyx mori\" and other silk-producing (and spinning) members of both Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera, which only have one pair of silk glands per individual, some species of embiid are estimated to have up to 300 silk glands: 150 in each forelimb. These glands are linked to a bristle-like cuticular process known as a silk ejector, and their exceedingly high numbers allow individuals to spin large amounts of silk very quickly, creating extensive galleries. The silk web is produced throughout all stages of the embiopteran lifespan, and requires modest energy output.\n\nWebspinner silk is among the thinnest of all animal silks, being in most species about 90 to 100 nanometres in diameter. The finest of any insect are those of the webspinner \"Aposthonia gurneyi\", averaging about 65 nanometres in diameter. Each thread consists of a protein core folded into pleated beta-sheets, with a water-repellent coating rich in waxy alkanes.\n\nThe galleries produced by embiopterans are tunnels and chambers woven from the silk they produce. These woven constructions can be found on substrates such as rocks and the bark of trees, or in leaf litter. Some species camouflage their galleries by decorating the outer layers with bits of leaf litter or other materials to match their surroundings. The galleries are essential to their life cycle, maintaining moisture in their environment, and also offering protection from predators and the elements while foraging, breeding and simply existing. Embiopterans only leave the gallery complex in search of a mate, or when females explore the immediate area in search of a new food source.\n\nWebspinners continually extend their galleries to reach new food sources, and expand their existing galleries as they grow in size. The insects spin silk by moving their forelegs back and forth over the substrate, and rotating their bodies to create a cylindrical, silk-lined tunnel. Older galleries have multiple laminate layers of silk. Each gallery complex contains several individuals, often descended from a single female, and forms a maze-like structure, extending from a secure retreat into whatever vegetable food matter is available nearby. The size and complexity of the colony vary between species, and they can be very extensive in those species that live in hot and humid climates.\n\nThe embiopteran diet varies between species, with available food sources changing with varying habitat. The nymphs and adult females feed on plant litter, bark, moss, algae and lichen. They are generalist herbivores; during his research, Ross maintained a number of species in the laboratory on a diet of lettuce and dry oak leaves. Adult males do not eat at all, so they die of starvation soon after mating.\n\nThe Sclerogibbidae are a small family of aculeate wasps that are specialist parasites of embiopterans. The wasp lays an egg on the abdomen of a nymph. The wasp larva emerges and attaches itself to the host's body, consuming the host's tissues as it grows. It eventually forms a cocoon and drops off the carcass. A Neotropical tachinid fly, \"Perumyia embiaphaga\", and a braconid wasp species in the genus \"Sericobracon\", are known to be parasitoids of adult embioptera. A few scelionid wasps in the tribe Embidobiini are egg parasitoids of the Embioptera. A protozoan parasite in Italy effectively sterilises males, forcing the remaining female population to become parthenogenetic. These parasites and agents of disease may put evolutionary pressure on embiopterans to live more socially.\n\nAdult webspinners are vulnerable when they emerge from their galleries, and are preyed on by birds, geckos, ants and spiders. They have been observed being attacked by owlfly larvae. Birds may pull sheets of silk off the galleries to expose their prey, ants may cut holes to gain entry and harvestmen may pierce the silk to feed on the webspinners inside.\n\nAnother group of associates inside the galleries are bugs in the family Plokiophilidae. Whether these are feeding on embiopteran eggs or larvae, on mites and other residents of the gallery, or are scavenging is unclear. The embiopteran \"Aposthonia ceylonica\" has been found living inside a colony of the Indian cooperative spider, probably feeding on algae growing on the spider sheetweb, and two webspinner species have been discovered living in the outer covering of termites' nests, where their silk galleries may protect them from attack.\n\nEmbiopterans are distributed worldwide, and are found on every continent except Antarctica, with the highest density and diversity of species being in tropical regions. Some common species have been accidentally transported to other parts of the world, while many native species are unobtrusive and yet to be detected. Some species live underground, or concealed under rocks or behind sections of loose bark. Others live out in the open, either swathed in sheets of white or blue silk, or hidden in less-conspicuous silken tubes, on the ground, on the trunks of trees or on the surface of granite rocks.\n\nLargely restricted to warmer locations, webspinners are found as far north as the state of Virginia in the United States (38°N), and as high as in Ecuador. They were absent from Britain until 2019, when \"Aposthonia ceylonica\", a southeast Asian species, was found in a glasshouse at the RHS Garden, Wisley.\n\n\n"}

In other cases, quartz and iron oxides, limonite, goethite, and jarosite, exist as pseudomorphs, replacing the pyrite and primary ore minerals. Frequently, gossan appears as a red \"stain\" against the background rock and soil, due to the abundance of oxidized iron; the gossan may be a topographic positive area due to the abundance of erosion-resistant quartz and iron oxides.

{"id": "2029298", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2029298", "title": "Benjamin Libet", "text": "Benjamin Libet\n\nBenjamin Libet (; April 12, 1916 – July 23, 2007) was a pioneering scientist in the field of human consciousness. Libet was a researcher in the physiology department of the University of California, San Francisco. \nIn 2003, he was the first recipient of the \"Virtual Nobel Prize in Psychology\" from the University of Klagenfurt, \"for his pioneering achievements in the experimental investigation of consciousness, initiation of action, and free will\".\n\nHe was the son of Ukrainian Jewish immigrants. Harry Libitsky, his paternal grandfather, came to America in 1905 from a town called Brusilov in Ukraine. \nHis mother, Anna Charovsky, emigrated from Kiev in 1913. His parents first met in Chicago. They were married in 1915, and somewhat over nine months later Benjamin was born. \nHe had a brother Meyer, and a sister Dorothy. Libet attended a public elementary school and John Marshall High School. Libet graduated from the University of Chicago, where he studied with Ralph Gerard.\n\nIn the 1970s, Libet was involved in research into neural activity and sensation thresholds. His initial investigations involved determining how much activation at specific sites in the brain was required to trigger artificial somatic sensations, relying on routine psychophysical procedures. This work soon crossed into an investigation into human consciousness; his most famous experiment was meant to demonstrate that the unconscious electrical processes in the brain called Bereitschaftspotential (or readiness potential) discovered by Lüder Deecke and Hans Helmut Kornhuber in 1964 precede conscious decisions to perform volitional, spontaneous acts, implying that unconscious neuronal processes precede and potentially cause volitional acts which are retrospectively felt to be consciously motivated by the subject. The experiment has caused controversy not only because it challenges the belief in free will, but also due to a criticism of its implicit assumptions. It has also inspired further study of the neuroscience of free will.\n\nTo gauge the relation between unconscious readiness potential and subjective feelings of volition and action, Libet required an objective method of marking the subject's conscious experience of the will to perform an action in time, and afterward comparing this information with data recording the brain's electrical activity during the same interval. For this, Libet required specialized pieces of equipment.\n\nThe first of these was the cathode ray oscilloscope, an instrument typically used to graph the amplitude and frequency of electrical signals. With a few adjustments, however, the oscilloscope could be made to act as a timer: instead of displaying a series of waves, the output was a single dot that could be made to travel in a circular motion, similar to the movements of a second hand around a clock face. This timer was set so that the time it took for the dot to travel between intervals marked on the oscilloscope was approximately forty-three milliseconds. As the angular velocity of the dot remained constant, any change in distance could easily be converted into the time it took to travel that distance.\n\nTo monitor brain activity during the same period, Libet used an electroencephalogram (EEG). The EEG uses small electrodes placed at various points on the scalp that measure neuronal activity in the cortex, the outermost portion of the brain, which is associated with higher cognition. The transmission of electrical signals across regions of the cortex causes differences in measured voltage across EEG electrodes. These differences in voltage reflect changes in neuronal activity in specific areas of the cortex.\n\nTo measure the actual time of the voluntary motor act, an electromyograph (EMG) recorded the muscle movement using electrodes on the skin over the activated muscle of the forearm. The EMG time was taken as the zero time relative to which all other times were calculated.\n\nResearchers carrying out Libet's procedure would ask each participant to sit at a desk in front of the oscilloscope timer. They would affix the EEG electrodes to the participant's scalp, and would then instruct the subject to carry out some small, simple motor activity, such as pressing a button, or flexing a finger or wrist, within a certain time frame. No limits were placed on the number of times the subject could perform the action within this period. \n\nDuring the experiment, the subject would be asked to note the position of the dot on the oscilloscope timer when \"he/she was first aware of the wish or urge to act\" (control tests with Libet's equipment demonstrated a comfortable margin of error of only -50 milliseconds). Pressing the button also recorded the position of the dot on the oscillator, this time electronically. By comparing the marked time of the button's pushing and the subject's conscious decision to act, researchers were able to calculate the total time of the trial from the subject's initial volition through to the resultant action. On average, approximately two hundred milliseconds elapsed between the first appearance of conscious will to press the button and the act of pressing it.\n\nResearchers also analyzed EEG recordings for each trial with respect to the timing of the action. It was noted that brain activity involved in the initiation of the action, primarily centered in the secondary motor cortex, occurred, on average, approximately five hundred milliseconds \"before\" the trial ended with the pushing of the button. That is to say, researchers recorded mounting brain activity related to the resultant action as many as three hundred milliseconds \"before\" subjects reported the first awareness of conscious will to act. In other words, apparently conscious decisions to act were \"preceded\" by an unconscious buildup of electrical activity within the brain - the change in EEG signals reflecting this buildup came to be called Bereitschaftspotential or readiness potential. As of 2008, the upcoming outcome of a decision could be found in study of the brain activity in the prefrontal and parietal cortex up to 7 seconds before the subject was aware of their decision.\n\nThere is no majority agreement about the interpretation or the significance of Libet’s experiments. However, Libet's experiments suggest to some that unconscious processes in the brain are the true initiator of volitional acts, and free will therefore plays no part in their initiation. If unconscious brain processes have already taken steps to initiate an action before consciousness is aware of any desire to perform it, the causal role of consciousness in volition is all but eliminated, according to this interpretation. For instance, Susan Blackmore's interpretation is \"that conscious experience takes some time to build up and is much too slow to be responsible for making things happen.\"\n\nSuch a conclusion would be overdrawn as in a subsequent run of experiments, Libet found that even after the awareness of the decision to push the button had happened, people still had the capability to veto the decision and not to push the button. So they still had the capability to refrain from the decision that had earlier been made. Some therefore take this brain impulse to push the button to suggest just a readiness potential which the subject may either then go along with or may veto. So the person still has power over his or her decision. \n\nFor this reason, Libet himself regards his experimental results to be entirely compatible with the notion of free will. He finds that conscious volition is exercised in the form of 'the power of veto' (sometimes called \"free won't\"); the idea that conscious acquiescence is required to allow the unconscious buildup of the readiness potential to be actualized as a movement. While consciousness plays no part in the \"instigation\" of volitional acts, Libet suggested that it may still have a part to play in suppressing or withholding certain acts instigated by the unconscious. Libet noted that everyone has experienced the withholding from performing an unconscious urge. Since the subjective experience of the conscious will to act preceded the action by only 200 milliseconds, this leaves consciousness only 100-150 milliseconds to veto an action (this is because the final 20 milliseconds prior to an act are occupied by the activation of the spinal motor neurones by the primary motor cortex, and the margin of error indicated by tests utilizing the oscillator must also be considered).\n\nLibet's experiments have received support from other research related to the Neuroscience of free will.\n\nThe German philosopher Uwe Meixner commented,\"For making an informed decision, the self needs to be conscious of the facts relevant to the decision prior to making the decision; but...the self certainly does not need to be conscious of making the decision at the very same time it makes it...the consciousness of a state of affairs P being (presently) the case is always somewhat later than the actual fact of P’s being the case...\"\n\nWhen one is speaking to another individual, as a result of the limited velocity of light signals and the limited velocity of sound waves and the limited velocity of nerve signals, what one is experiencing as now is always slightly in the past. No person ever has a definite present awareness of what is occurring around them. There is a small time delay due to the limited velocity of these many different signals that is indiscernible to people because it is extremely short. Meixner also says, “it is hardly surprising that the consciousness of making a decision is no exception to this general rule, which is due to the dependence of consciousness on neurophysiology.”\n\nJust as nothing that is actually presently there can be observed because of the limited velocity of light but events as they are just a little in the past can be observed, in the same way people do not have a consciousness of their own decisions simultaneously with their making them but they have it undetectedly afterwards.\n\nIf the soul has the power to think without being causally determined, then all it requires to do in order to make accountable, knowledgeable, free decisions is consciousness of the pertinent facts before its decision making. However, the soul does not require to be aware or conscious of the decision itself at the same it makes that decision.\n\nIt has been suggested that consciousness is merely a side-effect of neuronal functions, an epiphenomenon of brain states. Libet's experiments are proffered in support of this theory; our reports of conscious instigation of our own acts are, in this view, a mistake of retrospection. However, some dualist philosophers have disputed this conclusion: \n\nIn short, the [neuronal] causes and correlates of conscious experience should not be confused with their \"ontology\" [...] the \"only\" evidence about what conscious experiences are like comes from first-person sources, which consistently suggest consciousness to be something other than or additional to neuronal activity.\n\nA more general criticism from a dualist-interactionist perspective has been raised by Alexander Batthyany who points out that Libet asked his subjects to merely \"let the urge [to move] appear on its own at any time without any pre-planning or concentration on when to act\". According to Batthyany, neither reductionist nor non-reductionist agency theories claim that urges which appear on their own are suitable examples of (allegedly) consciously caused events because one cannot passively wait for an urge to occur while at the same time being the one who is consciously bringing it about. Libet's results thus cannot be interpreted to provide empirical evidence in favour of agency reductionism, since non-reductionist theories, even including dualist interactionism, would predict the very same experimental results.\n\nDaniel Dennett argues that no clear conclusion about volition can be derived from Libet's experiment because of ambiguities in the timings of the different events involved. Libet tells when the readiness potential occurs objectively, using electrodes, but relies on the subject reporting the position of the hand of a clock to determine when the conscious decision was made. As Dennett points out, this is only a report of where it \"seems\" to the subject that various things come together, not of the objective time at which they actually occur.\nSuppose Libet knows that your readiness potential peaked at millisecond 6,810 of the experimental trial, and the clock dot was straight down (which is what you reported you saw) at millisecond 7,005. How many milliseconds should he have to add to this number to get the time you were conscious of it? The light gets from your clock face to your eyeball almost instantaneously, but the path of the signals from retina through lateral geniculate nucleus to striate cortex takes 5 to 10 milliseconds — a paltry fraction of the 300 milliseconds offset, but how much longer does it take them to get to \"you\". (Or are you located in the striate cortex?) The visual signals have to be processed before they arrive at wherever they need to arrive for you to make a conscious decision of simultaneity. Libet's method presupposes, in short, that we can locate the \"intersection\" of two trajectories:\n\n• the rising-to-consciousness of signals representing the decision to flick\n\n• the rising to consciousness of signals representing successive clock-face orientations\n\nso that these events occur side-by-side as it were in place where their simultaneity can be noted.\n\nLibet's early theory, resting on study of stimuli and sensation, was found bizarre by some commentators, including Patricia Churchland, due to the apparent idea of backward causation. Libet argued that data suggested that we retrospectively \"antedate\" the beginning of a sensation to the moment of the primary neuronal response. People interpreted Libet's work on stimulus and sensation in a number of different ways. John Eccles presented Libet's work as suggesting a backward step in time made by a non-physical mind. Edoardo Bisiach (1988) described Eccles as tendentious, but commented: \n\nThis is indeed the conclusion that the authors (Libet, et al.) themselves seem to be willing to force upon the reader. [...] They dispute an alternative explanation, suggested by Mackay in a discussion with Libet (1979, p. 219) to the effect that 'the subjective referral backwards in time may be due to an illusory judgment made by the subject when he reports the timings', and more significant, Libet, et al. (1979, p. 220) hint at 'serious though not insurmountable difficulties' for the identity theory (of mind and matter) caused by their data.\n\nLibet later concluded that there appeared to be no \"neural mechanism\" that could be viewed as directly mediating or accounting for the subjective sensory referrals backward in time [emphasis Libet's]. Libet postulated that the primary evoked potential (EP) serves as a \"time marker\". The EP is a sharp positive potential appearing in the appropriate sensory region of the brain about 25 milliseconds after a skin stimulus. Libet's experiments demonstrated that there is an automatic subjective referral of the conscious experience backwards in time to this time marker. The skin sensation does not enter our conscious awareness until about 500 milliseconds after the skin stimulus, but we subjectively feel that the sensation occurred at the time of the stimulus.\n\nFor Libet, these subjective referrals would appear to be purely a mental function with no corresponding neural basis in the brain. Indeed, this suggestion can be more broadly generalized:\n\nThe transformation from neuronal patterns to a subjective representation would appear to develop in a mental sphere that has emerged from that neuronal pattern. [...] My view of mental subjective function is that it is an emergent property of appropriate brain functions. The conscious mental cannot exist without the brain processes that give rise to it. However, having emerged from brain activities as a unique 'property' of that physical system, the mental can exhibit phenomena not evident in the neural brain that produced it.\n\nIn the later part of his career, Libet proposed a theory of the \"conscious mental field\" (CMF) to explain how the mental arises from the physical brain. The two main motivations prompting this proposal were: (1) the phenomenon of the unity of subjective conscious experience and (2) the phenomenon that conscious mental function appears to influence nerve cell activity.\n\nRegarding the unity of conscious experience, it was increasingly evident to Libet that many functions of the cortex are localized, even to a microscopic level in a region of the brain, and yet the conscious experiences related to these areas are integrated and unified. We do not experience an infinite array of individual events but rather a unitary integrated consciousness, for example, with no gaps in spatial and colored images. For Libet, some unifying process or phenomenon likely mediates the transformation of localized, particularized neuronal representations into our unified conscious experience. This process seemed to be best accountable in a \"mental sphere\" that appears to emerge from the neural events, namely, the \"conscious mental field\".\n\nThe CMF is the mediator between the physical activities of nerve cells and the emergence of subjective experience. Thus the CMF is the entity in which unified subjective experience is present and provides the causal ability to affect or alter some neuronal functions. Libet proposed the CMF as a \"property\" of an emergent phenomenon of the brain; it does not exist without the brain but emerges from the appropriate system of neural activity. This proposal is related to electromagnetic theories of consciousness.\n\nTo test the proposed causal ability of the CMF to affect or alter neuronal functions, Libet proposed an experimental design, which would surgically isolate a slab of cerebral cortex (in a patient for whom such a procedure was therapeutically required). If electrical stimulation of the isolated cortex can elicit an introspective report by the subject, the CMF must be able to activate appropriate cerebral areas in order to produce the verbal report. This result would demonstrate directly that a conscious mental field could affect neuronal functions in a way that would account for the activity of the conscious will. Detailed description of the proposed experimental test is as follows: \n\nA small slab of sensory cortex (subserving any modality) is neuronally isolated but kept viable by making all the cortical cuts subpially. This allows the blood vessels in the pia to project into the isolated slab and provide blood flow from the arterial branches that dip vertically into the cortex. The prediction is that electrical stimulation of the sensory slab will produce a subjective response reportable by the subject. That is, activity in the isolated slab can contribute by producing its own portion of the CMF.\nLibet further elaborated on CMF:\n\nThe CMF is not a Cartesian dualistic phenomenon; it is not separable from the brain. Rather, it is proposed to be a localizable system property produced by appropriate neuronal activities, and it cannot exist without them. Again, it is not a ‘‘ghost’’ in the machine. But, as a system produced by billions of nerve cell actions, it can have properties not directly predictable from these neuronal activities. It is a non-physical phenomenon, like the subjective experience that it represents. The process by which the CMF arises from its contributing elements is not describable. It must simply be regarded as a new fundamental ‘‘given’’ phenomenon in nature, which is different from other fundamental ‘‘givens,’’ like gravity or electromagnetism.\n\nDr. Robert W.

{"id": "2029316", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2029316", "title": "Volley (tennis)", "text": "Volley (tennis)\n\nA volley in tennis is a shot in which the ball is struck before it bounces on the ground. Generally a player hits a volley while standing near the net, although it can be executed farther back, in the middle of the tennis court or even near the baseline. The word derives from M. French \"volée\" meaning flight.\n\nThe primary objective of the volley is to go on the offensive and cut the amount of time for the opponent to react. Another advantage is that a player eliminates any possibility of a bad bounce from an uneven surface such as on some grass and clay courts. Also, if near the net, a volleyer has a wider choice of angles to hit into the opponent's court. However, quick reflexes and hand–eye coordination are required to execute this shot. The primary means of countering a volley are the passing shot and the lob.\n\nGenerally, a player who advances to the net in the serve and volley type of game will make the initial volley fairly near the service line. The player will then move closer to the net in hopes of making a put-away volley for a winning point. It is difficult to hit an effective volley in the area between the baseline and the service line, consequently this is often called \"no man's land\".\n\nA regular volley is hit with a short backswing and a punching stroke. While standing at the net, a player usually has no time to take a long backswing. When the ball comes at less pace, though, the volleyer can take a longer backswing to impart more force on the ball, which is called a \"swing volley\". A player can also touch the ball lightly, so that the ball will fall just after the net. This is known as a \"drop volley\".\n\nAnother type of volley is the drive volley. This is hit with more backswing and followthrough than a normal volley. Effectively this is a volley groundstroke and a very aggressive shot, giving your opponent less time, and can be used as a way to approach the net (approach shot).\n\nTo be effective and safe, a volley should be either (1) a drop volley that barely passes the net so the opposing player will not be able to get to it, or (2) a very sharply angled shot so that again the opponent will not be able to get to it, or (3) a hard shot that bounces very near both the opponent's baseline and the sideline and that serves as a set-up shot in anticipation of a weak return by the opponent. Any other volley will permit the opponent to get to the ball in plenty of time to make an aggressive return shot, either a lob or a passing shot.\n\nThe lower the ball comes at the volleyer, the harder it is to hit an effective volley. In such cases, a player maybe better off to let the ball bounce and immediately hit the return on the rise rather than attempt to volley it. In this case the racquet contacts the ball almost at surface level. This tennis shot is named a half volley although it is actually no longer a volley, given that the ball has not been intercepted before it bounced. It is one of the more difficult shots in tennis as it requires both quick thinking and good reflexes; John McEnroe, Patrick Rafter and Leander Paes were considered masters of it.\n\nIn his 1979 autobiography, Jack Kramer, who had a fine volley himself, devoted a page to the best tennis strokes he had ever seen. He wrote: \n\nFOREHAND VOLLEY—Wilmer Allison of Texas, who won the 1935 Forest Hills, had the best I ever saw as a kid, and I've never seen anyone since hit one better. Budge Patty came closest, then Newcombe. BACKHAND VOLLEY—Close among Budge, Sedgman and Rosewall, with Sedgman getting the edge probably because of his quickness. Schroeder and Trabert were almost as outstanding.\nAmong open era (post 1968) male players, John McEnroe and Stefan Edberg and Leander Paes are generally regarded as being the finest and most natural volleyers, though some consider Patrick Rafter or Tim Henman to have been equally proficient. Pete Sampras is also regarded as having had the finest volleys in recent times.\n\nAmong open era female players, Martina Navratilova is considered to be the outstanding volleyer. Jana Novotná was also noted for her superior volleying skills.\n\nOther male players known for their superior volleying skills include:\n\n\nFemale players known for their superior volleying skills include:\n\n"}

On December 31 of that year, Rogers converted the station to a modern rock format and moved the station's studios into Ottawa, using the callsign CIOX and the brand name Xfm. However, in 2001 the CRTC found that by operating CIOX as an Ottawa station, Rogers was in contravention of market concentration rules about the number of radio stations in a single market that can be owned by the same company.

The final song as 101.1 Xfm was \"Good Riddance (Time Of Your Life)\" by Green Day.\n\nOn June 28, 2013 at 3PM, the station was rebranded as \"Country 101.1\", as part of Rogers' rebranding of its country-formatted stations to a unified brand.

He served as Master of Peterhouse, Cambridge, as Knightbridge Professor of Philosophy in the University of Cambridge from 1764 to 1769, and as bishop of Carlisle from 1768 to 1787.\n\nLaw was born in the parish of Cartmel, Grange-over-Sands, Lancashire on 6 June 1703. The bishop's father, Edmund Law, descended from a family of yeomen or \"statesmen\", long settled at Askham in Westmoreland, was son of Edmund Law, of Carhullan and Measand (will dated 1689), by his wife Elizabeth Wright of Measand. The bishop's father was curate of Staveley-in-Cartmel, and master of a small school there from 1693 to 1742. He married at Kendal 29 November 1701 Patience Langbaine, of the parish of Kirkby-Kendal, who was buried in Cartmel Churchyard. He seems on his marriage to have settled on his wife's property at Buck Crag, about four miles from Staveley. There his only son, Edmund - the future bishop, was born. The boy, educated first at Cartmel school, and afterwards at the free grammar school at Kendal, went to St. John's College, Cambridge. He earned his B.A. in 1723. Soon elected fellow of Christ's College, he proceeded M.A. in 1727. He was always an earnest student. At Cambridge his chief friends were Daniel Waterland, master of Magdalene College, John Jortin, and John Taylor, the editor of Demosthenes. He was said to be a great personal influence on the intellectual development of Richard Watson, Bishop of Landaff.\n\nIn 1737, Law was presented with the living of Greystoke in Cumberland, the gift of which at this time devolved on the university, and soon afterwards he married Mary Christian of Royal lineage, the daughter of John Christian of Milntown, Isle of Man and Unerring in Cumberland. In 1743, he was made archdeacon of Carlisle, and in 1746 he left Greystoke for Great Salkeld, the rectory of which was annexed to the archdeaconry.\n\nLaw became Master of Peterhouse on 12 November 1754, and at the same time resigned his archdeaconry. In 1760, Law was appointed librarian, or rather proto-bibliothecarius, of the university of Cambridge, an office created in 1721, and first filled by Dr. Conyers Middleton, and in 1764 he was made Knightbridge professor of moral philosophy. In 1763, he was presented to the archdeaconry of Staffordshire and a prebend in Lichfield Cathedral by his former pupil, Frederick Cornwallis; he received a prebend in Lincoln Cathedral in 1764, and in 1767, a prebendal stall in Durham Cathedral through the influence of the Duke of Newcastle.\n\nIn 1768, Law was recommended by the Duke of Grafton, then chancellor of the university, to the bishopric of Carlisle. His friend and biographer, William Paley, declares that Law regarded his elevation as a satisfactory proof that decent freedom of inquiry was not discouraged.\n\nLaw died at Rose Castle, in Dalston, Cumbria on 14 August 1787, in his eighty-fifth year. He was buried in Carlisle Cathedral, where the inscription on his monument commemorates his zeal alike for Christian truth and Christian liberty, adding \"religionem simplicem et incorruptam nisi salva libertate stare non posse arbitratus.\" His biographer, who knew him well, describes the bishop as \"a man of great softnesse of manners, and of the mildest and most tranquil disposition. His voice was never raised above its ordinary pitch. His countenance seemed never to have been ruffled.\"\n\nLaw's wife predeceased him in 1772, leaving eight sons and four daughters:\n\nThe bishop's portrait was three times painted by Romney: in 1777 for Sir Thomas Rumbolt; in 1783 for Dr. John Law, then Bishop of Clonfert; and a half-length, without his robes, in 1787 for Edward Law, afterwards Lord Ellenborough.\n\nHis first literary work was his \"Essay on the Origin of Evil\", a translation of Archbishop William King's \"De Origine Mali\", which Law illustrated with copious notes in 1731. In 1734, while still at Christ's College, he prepared, with John Taylor, Thomas Johnson, and Sandys Hutchinson, an edition of Robert Estienne's \"Thesaurus Linguæ Latinæ\", and in the same year appeared his \"Enquiry into the Ideas of Space and Time\", an attack upon à priori proofs of the existence of God, in answer to a work by John Jackson entitled \"The Existence and Unity of God proved from his Nature and Attributes\".\n\nThe work by which he is perhaps best known, \"Considerations on the State of the World with regard to the Theory of Religion\", was published by him at Cambridge in 1745. The main idea of the book is that the human race has been, and is, through a process of divine education, gradually and continuously progressing in religion, natural or revealed, at the same rate as it progresses in all other knowledge. In his philosophical opinions he was an ardent disciple of John Locke, in politics he was a whig, and as a priest he represented the most latitudinarian position of the day, but his Christian belief was grounded firmly on the evidence of miracles The \"Theory of Religion\" went through many editions, being subsequently enlarged with \"Reflections on the Life and Character of Christ\", and an \"Appendix concerning the use of the words Soul and Spirit in the Holy Scripture\". Another edition, with Paley's life of the author prefixed, was published by his son, George Henry Law, then bishop of Chester, in 1820. A German translation, made from the fifth enlarged edition, was printed at Leipzig in 1771.\n\nIn 1754, Law advocated in his public exercise for the degree of D.D. his favourite doctrine that the soul, which in his view was not naturally immortal, passed into a state of sleep between death and the resurrection. This theory met with much opposition; it was, however, defended by Archdeacon Francis Blackburne.\n\nIn 1774, Law, now a bishop, published anonymously an outspoken declaration in favour of religious toleration in a pamphlet entitled \"Considerations on the Propriety of requiring Subscription to Articles of Faith\". It was suggested by a petition presented to parliament in 1772, by Archdeacon Francis Blackburne and others for the abolition of subscription, and Law argued that it was unreasonable to impose upon a clergyman in any church more than a promise to comply with its liturgy, rites, and offices, without exacting any profession of such minister's present belief, still less any promise of constant belief, in particular doctrines. The publication was attacked by Thomas Randolph of Oxford, and defended by \"A Friend of Religious Liberty\" in a tract attributed by some to Paley, and said to have been his first literary production.\n\nIn 1777 Law published an edition of the \"Works of Locke\", in 4 vols., with a preface and a life of the author. This included, anonymously, his 1769 essay 'A Defence of Mr. Locke's Opinion Concerning Personal Identity'. Law also published several sermons. His interleaved Bible, with many manuscript notes, is preserved in the British Museum.\n\n\n\n"}

Filmed between May and June 1980 on a budget of £1 million, half of which was supplied by the Shaw Brothers, it was shot largely on location at Chislehurst Caves in Kent and on the island of Gozo in Malta, with a week's studio filming at Lee International Studios in London. Composer John Scott completed the film's electronic musical score over hours-long recording sessions.\n\nDespite a positive box office response in the UK and overseas, \"Inseminoid\" failed to impress most critics, who reacted negatively to the film's production design and special effects. The acting in general was also poorly received, though Geeson's performance was praised. \"Inseminoid\"s reputation suffered from its premise of an extraterrestrial insemination, which led critics to regard the film as a weak copy of \"Alien\" (1979). However, both Warren and \"Alien\" distributors 20th Century Fox rejected claims that the script for \"Inseminoid\" was influenced by the earlier film.\n\nAcademic criticism of \"Inseminoid\" has concentrated on the film's presentation of the female sex and female sexualities in the context of corruption by an alien source. Commentators have noted that as well as portraying Sandy as an abject Other, the film depicts a battle of the sexes as the character eliminates her former friends. The film was released on VHS to strong sales and novelised by Larry Miller.\n\nOn a freezing planet, a team of 12 Xeno Project archaeologists and scientists are excavating the ruins of an ancient civilisation. They discover a cave system containing wall markings and crystals of unknown origin. During a survey, a mysterious explosion cripples photographer Dean White and injures Ricky Williams. Deciphering the wall markings, exolinguist Mitch theorises that the civilisation was based on a concept of dualism: the planet orbits a binary star and seems to have been ruled by twins. Medical assistant Sharon discovers that the crystals are surrounded by an energy field and suggests that the civilisation was controlled by a form of chemical intelligence.\n\nA crystal sample begins to pulsate, causing the intelligence to take control of Ricky through a wound on his arm. In his delusional state, he is compelled to leave the team's base and re-enter the caves. He throws Gail into a pile of twisted metal, damaging her environmental suit and trapping her foot. Desperate to free herself, Gail removes her helmet and tries to amputate her foot with a chainsaw, but instead freezes to death in the planet's toxic atmosphere. Documentation officer Kate Carson shoots Ricky with a harpoon gun before he unseals the airlock and evacuates the base's breathable air.\n\nRicky and Gail are buried outside the base. Later, Mitch and Sandy return to the caves to collect more crystals. A monstrous alien creature appears and dismembers Mitch before raping Sandy. Sandy is taken back to base and treated by the team's doctor, Karl, who discovers that the rape has triggered an accelerated pregnancy. When further underground explosions block off the caves, the survivors are left with nothing to do but await pick-up by Xeno.\n\nThe intelligence takes over Sandy, giving her superhuman strength. She stabs Barbra to death with a pair of scissors and mutilates Dean and the remains of Mitch, drinking their blood. The rest of the team take refuge in the control room as Sandy uses explosives to blow up the base transmitter. When Sandy's psychosis appears to subside, Karl, Sharon and Commander Holly McKay attempt sedation. However, Sandy reverts to her former state, kills Karl and Holly and disembowels their corpses.\n\nMark radios Sandy from the control room to distract her while Kate and Gary arm themselves with chainsaws from a storage room. The ruse is uncovered and Sandy harpoons Gary outside the airlock, breathing the atmosphere to no ill effect as she feeds on his flesh. She then re-enters the base and gives birth to hybrid twins. Mark stumbles across the newborns and leaves them with Sharon as Sandy blows up the door to the control room and proceeds to smash all the equipment inside. She then wounds Kate with another explosive charge and kills her. In a last fight to the death, Mark strangles Sandy with a length of cable. He returns to Sharon to find one of the twins drinking from her torn-out throat, then comes face to face with its equally bloodthirsty sibling.\n\nTwenty-eight days later, a Xeno shuttle lands on the planet to investigate the loss of contact with the team. With the base in ruins and its occupants either dead or missing, commandos Corin and Roy abandon the search for survivors and shuttle pilot Jeff radios Xeno control for clearance to return. The final shots reveal that the twins have stowed away inside a storage compartment on board the shuttle.\n\nAfter making \"Satan's Slave\" (1976), \"Prey\" (1977) and \"Terror\" (1978), Norman J. Warren was to have directed a film called \"Gargoyles\". After this production collapsed without a finished script, Warren and producer Richard Gordon accepted a story idea from the husband-and-wife duo of Nick and Gloria Maley, who had been members of the special effects unit on \"Satan's Slave\". The Maleys wrote the film both as an amalgam of their favourite science-fiction ideas and to showcase their effects work. Their script, which indicated that the film is set two decades in the future in a militaristic universe, was provisionally titled \"Doomseeds\"; to avoid confusion with the 1977 film \"Demon Seed\", this was changed to \"Inseminoid\".\n\nGordon cast American actors Robin Clarke and Jennifer Ashley as Mark and Holly while on business in Hollywood. Prior to \"Inseminoid\", Ashley had appeared in several independent films, while Clarke had just played a supporting role in John G. Avildsen's \"The Formula\". Beacham, then a mother of two young children, accepted the role of Kate Carson to support her family, recalling in a 2003 interview: \"I had to choose between a play that I really, really wanted to do, which would have paid me £65 a week, and this script for a film called \"Inseminoid\". Hey! No choice. Two pink babies asleep upstairs! No choice!\"\n\nThe Hong Kong Shaw Brothers agreed to provide half of the proposed £1 million budget and became partners in the production, with elder brother Run Run Shaw credited in the opening titles as the film's presenter. Nick Maley reprised his special effects role to build the alien twin puppets. Principal photography began on 12 May 1980 with a crew of 75. The production filmed for three weeks on location at Chislehurst Caves in Kent and one week at Lee International Studios in Wembley Park, London. A fifth week was devoted to effects and linking shots, completed by the second unit at Film House on London's Wardour Street. The crew then travelled to the island of Gozo, Malta for a final, two-day location shoot to film the long shots set on the planet's surface, capitalising on the strong Mediterranean sun to ensure good lighting.\n\nWarren says that shooting the base interior scenes at Chislehurst Caves produced more realistic results for the film's low budget than any possible studio alternative. However, the cold, damp and airless conditions inside the caves, compounded by the uneven terrain, caused frequent minor injuries among the cast and crew as well as damage to filming equipment. Shooting often ran for 12 hours at a time and some of those present developed intense feelings of claustrophobia in the confined space. Gordon believed that the uncomfortable working conditions made the actors' performances more credible, once stating: \"I think all this paid off in terms of what we got on the screen for the budget, but the circumstances were very difficult.\" Due to the lack of space inside the caves, the crew were forced to set up their production office, as well as the dressing and make-up rooms, in a car park some distance from the location. When the filming started to fall behind schedule, Warren was forced to cut some of the scenes of Ricky's rampage inside the caves: \"Three pages of script, which I had to condense into one shot. Having to make such an enormous compromise was not a happy choice for me, but it was the only way of getting us back on schedule.\" The shoot ultimately overran by two days.\n\nAs filming progressed, the working relationship between Warren and Clarke broke down. According to Warren, Clarke routinely refused to follow instructions and instead offered his own, unsolicited interpretation of the script, which made every scene featuring him \"an uphill struggle\". He remembers that during preparations for a fight scene, Clarke's behaviour caused him to lose his temper: \"Robin kept on ranting and raving about his ideas to the point where I couldn't take it any more. So I screamed at him to shut up and keep quiet. I told him I was the director and we would do the scene the way I said. He was shocked, he just stopped dead, and from that point on he hardly said a word.\" Warren's rapports with the rest of the cast were positive. He has described Geeson as \"an absolute dream to work with\" and praised her acting, arguing that it avoids being unintentionally comic. Gordon was similarly impressed, stating that Geeson fully embraced her role and did not complain that it demeaned her as an actress. Warren also has fond memories of Beacham's \"very professional\" performance, recalling that \"with tongue firmly in cheek, she would often wind me up by asking what her motivation was for a particular action, just as I about to call 'Action!', knowing full well that my answer would be, 'Because it's in the script'.\"\n\n\"Inseminoid\" was shot on 35 mm Eastman Kodak film with anamorphic lenses. Warren remembers that this format produced an \"incredibly sharp image and what I would term as the 'American' look.\" During post-production, the picture was brightened as it was feared that if the film appeared too dimly lit it would be harder to sell to television broadcasters. In addition, some of the more graphic shots of Sandy's labour were removed to ensure that the film would not be rejected by the British Board of Film Censors (BBFC). According to Warren, editor Peter Boyle \"had a natural feel for the material and managed to create just the right pace and rhythm throughout the film.\" The title sequence was produced by Oxford Scientific Films.\n\nAs the low budget precluded the use of an orchestra, Warren and composer John Scott agreed that the film would have an electronic score. The recording involved many hours of multi-tracking and overdubbing. Warren has described the completed soundtrack as an \"amazing achievement\", noting that electronic scores were \"quite experimental\" in the early 1980s. The soundtrack was released as an LP record in 1982.\n\nCinemas in Germany began showing \"Inseminoid\" in January 1981 under the title \"Samen des Bösen\" (English: \"Seeds of Evil\"). In the UK, the film premiered on 22 March in the Midlands, subsequently opening at 65 cinemas in the region. It reached London in October. The film was commercially successful, reaching fifth position at the UK box office and seventh in France. \"Inseminoid\" was also one of the first films to receive a VHS release not long after cinema release, and in November 1981 reached seventh in the UK video charts. It was re-released on VHS in 1992 and 1998.\n\nThe film was originally promoted in the UK partly via a regional mailshot with a circular showing a screaming Geeson in character as Sandy with the tagline \"Warning! An Horrific Alien Birth! A Violent Nightmare in Blood! \"Inseminoid\" at a Cinema Near You Soon!\" Warren later regretted that the film had been announced in this fashion, commenting: \"The problem with mail drops is that you have no way of knowing who lives in the house, or who will see it first. It could be a pregnant woman, and old lady, or even worse, a young child. So it was not such a good idea.\" The BBFC originally certified the film X and later 18. In 2005, this was lowered to 15.\n\nTo Warren's displeasure, overseas distributor Almi renamed the film \"Horror Planet\" for its release in North America. This was later changed back to \"Inseminoid\". The Motion Picture Association of America rated the film R for \"profanity, nudity, violence, rape and gore\".\n\n\"Inseminoid\" was nominated for the Fantasporto award for best film and won the Fantafestival award for best special effects. Roger Corman congratulated Warren on the film and considered hiring him as a director. However, \"Inseminoid\" failed to impress members of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, who according to Warren dismissed it as \"'Commercial rubbish! ... Not the sort of thing the Academy should be showing ... And certainly not the kind of film the British film industry should be making!'\" Warren also remembers that it displeased female audiences: \"It seems it is quite common for pregnant women to have nightmares about giving birth to some kind of monster. Of course, all their complaints and their letters which were printed in the local papers only helped to increase the queue at the box office.\"\n\nAlan Jones of \"Starburst\" magazine expressed a preference for the British members of the cast, describing Geeson as \"absolutely first-rate\" but criticising the \"weak performances from the token Americans\" Robin Clarke and Jennifer Ashley. Praising the film's cost-effective production values, he suggested that its violent on-screen killings carried Warren's \"particular trademark\". He added that \"Inseminoid\" \"is not faultless by any means,\" citing a predictable and often \"ridiculous\" plot as one of the film's downsides. However, he concluded that it met audience expectations for a sci-fi B movie, declaring it \"far less routine and far more enjoyable than I had expected.\"\n\nIn the US, \"Inseminoid\" made the \"Los Angeles Times\" top ten list. Critical response from other commentators was less favourable. Edward Jones of Virginia's \"The Free Lance–Star\" praised the \"novel touch\" of casting an expectant mother as the villain but added that \"in what has to be a new low, even for extraterrestrial-horror films, all the men end up punching this pregnant woman in the stomach.\" He summed up the film as \"no more than a mix of everything-you've-ever-seen-in-a-horror-movie-and-didn't-particularly-want-to-see-again.\" In a review for Florida's \"Boca Raton News\", Skip Sheffield branded the film \"horrible\" and \"cheapo\", advising readers to \"imagine \"Alien\" without the fantastic sets, convincing special effects and literate dialogue, and you have a picture of \"Horror Planet\".\" He also argued that the film's graphic violence did not create suspense, punning on the name Run Run Shaw in his conclusion that \"\"Horror Planet\" is a film to run, run away from – fast.\"\n\nThe website AllMovie rates the film one star out of five. Reviewer Cavett Binion calls Geeson's performance \"more than a bit uncomfortable to watch\", describes the rape sequence as \"surreal and truly disgusting\" and considers the choice of title \"sleazy\". To Douglas Pratt, \"Inseminoid\" features poor acting and production design with \"some gooey gore shots but few other thrills\". He concedes that the film \"goes through the motions properly, however, so fans will probably find it worth passing the time.\"\n\nWarren rejected the notion that \"Inseminoid\" is comparable to a \"video nasty\". On the film's supposed cult status, he said: \"If \"Inseminoid\" has become some form of cult movie, then I am very pleased and, indeed, very flattered.\" He added that if he were to re-make \"Inseminoid\", he would demand a longer filming schedule and use darker lighting to heighten the suspense.\n\n\"Inseminoid\" has been criticised as a perceived imitation, \"knock-off\" or \"rip-off\" of the 1979 science-fiction horror film \"Alien\". Peter Wright, a film historian and lecturer at the University of Liverpool, believes that the \"atmospheric\" cave sequences and the mess hall scene preceding Ricky's madness may have been inspired by Ridley Scott's film, comparing the former to the sequences set on the desolate planetoid and the latter to the violent reveal of the alien \"chestburster\". Wright considers the connection to \"Alien\" potentially \"exploitative\"; to Barry Langford of the University of London, it highlights the dependence of UK cinema on its US counterpart. Alan Jones argues that \"any similarity between \"Inseminoid\" and \"Alien\" is totally intentional. Except here is the basic idea contained in \"Alien\" taken to its sleaziest extreme.\" He finds one such parallel in the character of Kate (Stephanie Beacham), whom he likens to Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver). However, he also regards \"Contamination\" (1980) and \"Scared to Death\" (1981) as less effective imitations of Scott. Edward Jones suggests that the plot of \"Inseminoid\" also borrows from the novel \"Dracula\" (1897), the TV series \"The Bionic Woman\" (1976–78) and the films \"The Thing from Another World\" (1951) and \"Night of the Living Dead\" (1968).\n\nThough he acknowledges similarities to \"Alien\", Warren has denied claims that \"Inseminoid\" was made as an imitation, pointing out that the script for his film was completed months before \"Alien\" was released in the UK. He has also said that \"Alien\" distributors 20th Century Fox were shown the final cut of \"Inseminoid\" and that even they discounted the possibility: \"... in fact, the head of Fox sent us a very nice letter saying how much he enjoyed the film and wished us luck with the release ... I find it flattering that anyone can compare \"Alien\", which cost in the region of $30 million, with \"Inseminoid\" which cost less than £1 million. We must have done something right.\"\n\nVarious commentators have discussed \"Inseminoid\"s depiction of sexual reproduction, female sexuality, conflict between male and female gender roles, pregnancy, new motherhood and Otherness. Wright interprets Sandy's transformation as a \"direct manifestation of masculine anxiety regarding female reproductive capacity\". He argues that the film's horror is internalised within the seed of the alien being, which renders Sandy \"woman-as-other\" or \"abject \"Other\". This is in contrast with \"Alien\", which concerns transfer of \"fear of woman onto the alien other\". Wright suggests that \"Inseminoid\" contains echoes of the film \"Demon Seed\" (1977), in which a woman is raped and impregnated by an artificially-intelligent computer: \"in both films, women are framed as 'Other' by their sexual congress with more conventional iconic others: the machine and the alien.\" In all these films, pregnancy is depicted as a source of horror; in \"Inseminoid\", this is conveyed by the \"uterine and cervical\" title sequence, suggestive of \"entering the realm of the monstrous womb ... the titling reveals a microscopic insect resident in the body of a larger organism.\"\n\nWright argues that the distorted representation of the womb reveals similarities to the 1979 film \"The Brood\", in which a woman parthenogenetically gives birth to deformed offspring. Analysing the rape sequence itself, in which Karl injects Sandy with an unknown substance, Wright makes a connection to dialogue in other scenes implying that the women on the archaeological team are given regular contraceptive injections. Sandy's impregnation, conflicting with the suppression of fertilisation manifested in Karl's use of a hypodermic (and phallic) needle, reveals \"coherent sexism\": it \"attacks the very notion of female sexual freedom, while suggesting, paradoxically, that contraception is the responsibility of women.\" Sandy's accelerated pregnancy and regression to the level of a savage add to her depiction as an abject Other or object of \"male paranoia\".\n\nDuring the struggle between Sandy and Gary, it is not until Gary has half-suffocated that Sandy kills him. Wright suggests that this sequence is reassuring from a male point of view as it implies that no woman – not even one with unnatural strength – is strong enough to kill a man in cold blood. That Sandy is ultimately killed by a man (Mark) makes her an aid in the re-empowerment of the male sex, although her offspring are quick to avenge their mother. Comparing the plot of \"Inseminoid\" to Christian scripture, Christopher Partridge of Lancaster University refers to the twins as \"essentially space Nephilim, technological demons with appetites and habits reminiscent of the mythic forebears.\"\n\nThe film's sexual references continue into the epilogue, which shows the arrival of rescuers Jeff, Corin and Roy. In an allusion to the menstrual cycle, it is stated in dialogue that 28 days have passed since Xeno lost contact with the team. The deaths of the archaeologists are attributed to an \"internal disturbance of some kind\"; Wright calls this \"an ironic phrase which encapsulates the film's vision of pregnancy as an irruption of Otherness from within.\"\n\nDiscussing Larry Miller's novelisation, which he describes as \"imaginative and misogynistic\", Wright notes a number of scenes that are absent from the film and portray a distorted image of the female form, causing revulsion in the reader. Miller has Sandy grow sores and her nipples ooze pus, which Wright likens to colostrum. Sandy accepts these unnatural changes with fascination.\n\n"}
{"id": "2029407", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2029407", "title": "Jet (magazine)", "text": "Jet (magazine)\n\nJet is an American weekly magazine that focus on news, culture, and entertainment within the African–American community. Founded in November 1951 by John H. Johnson of the Johnson Publishing Company in Chicago, Illinois, The magazine was initially billed as \"The Weekly Negro News Magazine\". \"Jet\" chronicled the Civil Rights Movement from its earliest years, including the murder of Emmett Till, the Montgomery bus boycott, and the activities of Civil Rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nFirst published on November 1, 1951 in small digest-sized format from its inception, \"Jet\" printed in all or mostly black-and-white until its December 27, 1999 issue. In 2009, \"Jet\"s publishing format was changed; it was published every week with a double issue published once each month. Johnson Publishing Company published the final print issue on June 23, 2014, continuing solely as a digital magazine app. In 2016, Johnson Publishing sold \"Jet\" and its sister publication \"Ebony\" to private equity firm Clear View Group. The publishing company is now known as Ebony Media Corporation.\n\nThe first issue of \"Jet\" magazine was published on November 1, 1951 by John H. Johnson in Chicago, Illinois. Johnson called his magazine \"Jet\" because he wanted the name to symbolize \"Black and speed\". In Jet’s first issue, Johnson wrote, \"In the world today everything is moving along at a faster clip. There is more news and far less time to read it.\" Jet's goal was to provide \"news coverage on happenings among Negroes all over the U.S.—in entertainment, politics, sports, social events as well as features on unusual personalities, places and events.\" Redd Foxx called the magazine \"the Negro bible\".\n\n\"Jet\" became nationally known in 1955 for its shocking and graphic coverage of the murder of Emmett Till. Its popularity was enhanced by its continuing coverage of the burgeoning Civil Rights Movement. The publication of Till's brutalized corpse on the cover of the issue inspired the black community to address racial violence, catalyzing the Civil Rights Movement. The Johnson Publishing Company's campaign for economic, political and social justice influenced its inclusion of progressive views. From 1970-1975, \"Jet\" challenged conservative readers' anti-abortion stance by giving physicians who performed abortions a platform to discuss scientific facts about abortion procedures. \n\nIn May 2014, the publication announced the print edition would be discontinued and switch to a digital format in June.\nIn June 2016, after 71 years, \"Jet\" and its sister publication \"Ebony\" were sold by Johnson Publishing to Clear View Group, an Austin, Texas-based private equity firm, for an undisclosed amount. In July 2019, three months after Johnson Publishing filed for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy liquidation, it sold its historic \"Jet\" and \"Ebony\" photo archives to a consortium of foundations to be made available to the public.\n\n\"Jet\" coverage includes: fashion and beauty tips, entertainment news, dating advice, political coverage, health tips, and diet guides, in addition to covering events such as fashion shows. The cover photo usually corresponds to the focus of the main story. Some examples of cover stories might be a celebrity's wedding, Mother's Day, or a recognition of the achievements of a notable African American. Many issues are given coverage to show the African-American community that if they want to reach a goal, they have to be willing to work for it. \"Jet\" also claims to give young female adults confidence and strength because the women featured therein are strong and successful without the help of a man. Since 1952, \"Jet\" has had a full-page feature called \"Beauty of the Week\". This feature includes a photograph of an African-American woman in a swimsuit (either one-piece or two-piece, but never nude), along with her name, place of residence, profession, hobbies, and interests. Many of the women are not professional models and submit their photographs for the magazine's consideration. The purpose of the feature is to promote the beauty of African-American women. Similar to \"Essence\", \"Jet\" routinely deplores racism in mainstream media, especially its negative depictions of black men and women. However, Hazell and Clarke report that between 2003-4, \"Jet\" and \"Essence\" themselves ran advertising that was pervaded with racism and white supremacy. In fact, \"Jet\" has published colorist advertisements in the past. An advertisement for Nadinola, a bleaching cream, appeared in an issue published in 1955. It depicts a light-skinned woman as the center of men's attention\n\n\n\n"}

He wrote some notable political pamphlets. In theology, he belonged to an influential group of followers of Edmund Law that included also John Hey and William Paley.\n\nWatson was born in Heversham, Westmorland (now Cumbria), and educated at Heversham Grammar School and Trinity College, Cambridge, on a scholarship endowed by Edward Wilson of Nether Levens (1557–1653). In 1759 he graduated as Second Wrangler after having challenged Massey for the position of Senior Wrangler. This challenge, in part, prompted the University Proctor, William Farish, to introduce the practice of assigning specific marks to individual questions in University tests and, in so doing, replaced the practice of 'judgement' at Cambridge with 'marking'. Marking subsequently emerged as the predominant method to determine rank order in meritocratic systems. In 1760 he became a fellow of Trinity and in 1762 received his MA degree. He became Professor of Chemistry in 1764 and was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1769 after publishing a paper on the solution of salts in \"Philosophical Transactions\".\n\nWatson's theological career began when he became the Cambridge Regius Professor of Divinity in 1771. In 1773, he married Dorothy Wilson, daughter of Edward Wilson of Dallam Tower and a descendant of the eponymous benefactor who had endowed Watson's scholarship. In 1774, he took up the position of prebendary of Ely Cathedral. He became archdeacon of Ely and rector of Northwold in 1779, leaving the Northwold post two years later to become rector of Knaptoft. In 1782, he left all his previous appointments to take up the post of Bishop of Llandaff, which he held until his death in 1816. In 1788, he purchased the Calgarth estate in Troutbeck Bridge, Windermere, Westmorland. The same year he was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.\n\nWatson was buried at St Martin's Church in Bowness-on-Windermere.\n\nWatson contributed to the Revolution controversy, with \"A treatise upon the authenticity of the Scriptures, and the truth of the Christian religion\" (1792) and most notably in 1796 when he delivered his counterblast to Thomas Paine's \"The Age of Reason\" in \"An Apology for the Bible\" which he had \"reason to believe, was of singular service in stopping that torrent of irreligion which had been excited by [Paine's] writings\". In 1798 he published \"An Address to the People of Great Britain\", which argued for national taxes to be raised to pay for the war against France and to reduce the national debt. Gilbert Wakefield, a Unitarian minister who taught at Warrington Academy, responded with \"A Reply to Some Parts of the Bishop Llandaff's Address to the People of Great Britain\", attacking the privileged position of the wealthy.\n\nAn autobiography, \"Anecdotes of the life of Richard Watson, Bishop of Landaff\", was finished in 1814 and published posthumously in 1817.\n\nIn the 19th century, it was rumoured that Watson had been the first to propose the electric telegraph, but this is incorrect. At the time William Watson (1715–1787) made researches in electricity, but even he was not involved in the telegraph.\n\n"}

Instead, he chose, temporarily, to work on patterns (\"A Pattern Language\") together with other well-known architects (Sarah Ishikawa and Murray Silverstein). These patterns are visible or material manifestations of the driving forces underlying the synthesis of form. For an example, consider the following excerpt from the part one of the book (page 15): \n\nNevertheless, what matters here is not only the form itself but the forces induced by the magnetic field. The fact that the magnetic field induces certain kind of form is relevant for some purposes; however, there are many practical applications not related to form. The equations describing the magnetic field can be translated into many useful outputs, to which, the concept denoted here by term \"pattern\" is a corresponding material manifestation or articulation. In his most recent work, \"The Nature of Order\", Alexander demonstrates that it is illogical to separate formal manifestations from the underlying processes or sequences which produce the form, as both are observable aspects of the same field, thereby resolving the apparent conflict between this work and his subsequent pattern research.\n\n"}

Issue tracking systems are generally used in collaborative settings—especially in large or distributed collaborations—but can also be employed by individuals as part of a time management or personal productivity regime. These systems often encompass resource allocation, time accounting, priority management, and oversight workflow in addition to implementing a centralized issue registry. \n\nIn the institutional setting, issue tracking systems are commonly used in an organization's customer support call center to create, update, and resolve reported customer issues, or even issues reported by that organization's other employees. A support ticket should include vital information for the account involved and the issue encountered. An issue tracking system often also contains a knowledge base containing information on each customer, resolutions to common problems, and other such data. \n\nAn issue tracking system is similar to a \"bugtracker\", and often, a software company will sell both, and some bugtrackers are capable of being used as an issue tracking system, and vice versa. Consistent use of an issue or bug tracking system is considered one of the \"hallmarks of a good software team\". \nA ticket element, within an issue tracking system, is a running report on a particular problem, its status, and other relevant data. They are commonly created in a help desk or call center environment and almost always have a unique reference number, also known as a \"case\", \"issue\" or \"call log\" number which is used to allow the user or help staff to quickly locate, add to or communicate the status of the user's issue or request.\n\nThese tickets are called so because of their origin as small cards within a traditional wall mounted work planning system when this kind of support started. Operators or staff receiving a call or query from a user would fill out a small card with the user's details and a brief summary of the request and place it into a position (usually the last) in a column of \"pending slots\" for an appropriate engineer, so determining the staff member who would deal with the query and the priority of the request.\n\nThe shared conceptual foundation between issue tracking systems and bugtrackers is that a valid issue must be amenable to a decisive resolution (such as \"completed\", \"fixed\", or a group consensus that the issue is not worth solving, such as \"not a problem\" or \"won't fix\"); that each issue is unique (duplicate problem reports are in most cases promptly amalgamated into a single active issue or ticket); and—beyond the screening stage—that there is precisely one person assigned formal responsibility to move the issue forward (this formal baton will often bounce around many times as the issue evolves). In bug trackers, issues are generally quality or feature related with respect to a codebase (which is inherently a project management setting) whereas in generalized issue tracking systems, the tickets are often service-related or relationship-based, with closer ties to customer relationship management (CRM) concerns.\n\nIssues can have several aspects to them. Each issue in the system may have an urgency value assigned to it, based on the overall importance of that issue. Low or zero urgency issues are minor and should be resolved as time permits.\nOther details of issues include the customer experiencing the issue (whether external or internal), date of submission, detailed descriptions of the problem being experienced, attempted solutions or workarounds, and other relevant information. Each issue maintains a history of each change.\n\nIssue-tracking systems fulfill different functions, in particular:\n\nAn example scenario is presented to demonstrate how a common issue tracking system would work:\n\n\nIf the problem is not fully resolved, the ticket will be reopened once the technician receives new information from the customer.\nA Run Book Automation process that implements best practices for these workflows and increases IT personnel effectiveness is becoming very common.\n\n\n"}

She started classes with 450 students in the Secondary One and Two levels, and a teaching body of 15 on 3 January 1986, headed by the school's first principal, Mr Ow Chiong Hoo. In the same year, the school saw the first Investiture of the BTVSS Student Council, the formation of the School Military Band and the Library. The school was fully functional with the completion of the outdoor fitness stations and the landscaped garden. In 1987, Bukit View held their first Track-and-Field Meet, and also was the convenor of the West Zone Secondary Schools Badminton Tournament. The school facility also installed an electric kiln installed for students to explore their artistic talents through pottery. On 15 July 1988 Bukit View was officially opened by Mr Chai Chong Yii, MP for Bukit Batok. A school lecture hall was built and officially opened by the newly appointed MP for Bukit Batok Dr Ong Chit Chung on 6 November 1989.

In 1987, she organized the first Annual West Zone Inter-Primary Schools Languages, Maths & Science competitions. She was also the host for the finals of the inaugural Primary Inter-School Chinese Debate between Pei Chun Public School and Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus (CHIJ) on 23 June 1990. The Debate, organized by Mr Ow, saw the Convent emerging as winners for the first of the bi-annual competition.\n\nBetween the years 1989 and 1991, the school hall was the venue of choice for important speeches delivered by VIPs from various social levels. They were organized by the Bukit Batok Community Centre Current Affairs Club, and chaired by MP, Dr Ong. Members of the public heard Dr S.

Named after Martin Place, it is served by Sydney Trains T4 Eastern Suburbs & Illawarra Line services and NSW TrainLink South Coast Line services. It was designed by Fowell, Mansfield Jarvis and McLurcan and built from 1973 to 1979. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.\n\nMartin Place Station was opened on 23 June 1979 as part of the inauguration of the Eastern Suburbs Railway (ESR) line. The station had been constructed using an open-cut excavation.\n\nA line to the eastern suburbs had been part of the wider rail plan for Sydney since the late 1890s, with provisions made for the eventuality during the construction of the City Circle underground stations in the 1920s, although work never proceeded past the planning phase at this time. The City and Suburban Electric Railways (Amendment) Act, Act No. 13 of 1947, made provision for the construction of further electric railways in the City of Sydney, serving the eastern, southern and south-eastern suburbs. This Act amended an earlier scheme proposed by John Bradfield in 1916 which had provided for an eastern suburbs line (via St James Station) and a south-eastern railway. The Act made provision for the construction of 44 miles of new suburban electric railways.\n\nSince the late 1940s the ESR had been under construction on and off, with meaningful progress made from the early 1970s. The construction of the line was a contentious political issue, not only because of the extended period over which it was undertaken, but also because of the resumptions and demolitions throughout Woolloomooloo that were required to build it. The alignment and profile for the ESR was set in 1926 and construction on the railway was started by the NSW Department of Railways. In 1952, the project was abandoned until the mid 1960s. In 1967 the NSW Department of Railways engaged the Snowy Mountains Authority (SMA) to prepare and develop documents for the city tunnels and stations, Kings Cross tunnel and stations, and Rushcutters Bay viaduct and various other associated works.\n\nMartin Place was created in stages between 1860 and 1935 and transformed into a pedestrian area between 1968 and 1978. The final form of the area was determined by prolonged argument and, ultimately, compromise between the City Council, State Government and authorities and private landowners.\n\nBy the late 1960s, the conversion of Martin Place into a pedestrian plaza had reached as far east as Pitt Street. In mid 1971, a new plan for the long-term development of the City, known as the Strategic Plan, was published. The second of four principles in this plan involved the improvement of ‘access and movement within the city’, including pedestrian movement. Included among the 'actions', was the extension of Martin Place as a pedestrian plaza through to Macquarie Street. This extension of the closure of Macquarie Street had long been proposed and objected to by various parties, not the least of whom were the affected property owners. The design of Martin Place Railway Station played an important role in promoting the extension of Martin Place to Macquarie Street and in determining the design of the easternmost end of the plaza.\n\nIn 1967, the State Government awarded the contract for the civil and structural design of the line to the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Authority. The section of the line near Macquarie Street was 30 metres below ground level; the main concourse for the proposed Martin Place Station were thus below street level and extended from under Phillip Street as far as Macquarie Street. It was proposed to construct entrances, with escalator access, down to the concourse from both streets. Concurrent to the development of the station, there were proposals to provide underground access from the railway concourse, under Elizabeth Street, to connect with a retail arcade within the Prudential Building on the southern side of Martin Place. The area beneath the roadway between Elizabeth and Castlereagh Streets consisted of basements, owned by the Council, which had been constructed for an aborted State Savings Bank building.\n\nAbove ground, the design of the Pitt Street-Castlereagh Street block of Martin Place took shape. Taking advantage of the six-metre height difference between the two streets, a raised terrace, overlooking the existing plaza area of Martin Place to the west, was proposed for the Pitt Street end of the block. At the Castlereagh Street end, it was proposed to build a sunken amphitheatre for civic and public performances, from which access under Castlereagh Street would lead via a shopping arcade into the City owned basements to the railway concourse. This vital link was opposed for sometime and would be the last element in the overall plan to be constructed (see below). Varied uses for the plaza above were proposed. The short block between Castlereagh and Elizabeth Street was considered suitable for markets and the area between Elizabeth and Phillip Street was to be a quiet landscaped haven. The final section, between Phillip and Macquarie Streets, was to be an important place of arrival in the city centre. A large fountain was proposed to provide a focal point for the vista towards Sydney Hospital and it was envisaged that outdoor café seating would make this area a good waiting area near the railway entrance.\n\nThe Minister for Lands gave notice of the closure of Martin Place from the eastern side of Pitt Street to the western side of Macquarie Street, exclusive of cross streets, on 24 November 1972. Almost every Government Agency and owner objected, resulting in prolonged negotiations. The objector who could not be satisfied was the Chairman of the Rural Bank, who used his high level contacts to ensure that the plaza, as first gazetted, extended only as far as Elizabeth Street, stopping short of the Rural Bank (1973). In reality, the upper two blocks were closed for a number of years to through traffic to allow railway construction, ultimately paving the way for permanent closure. The objections of the Rural Bank were finally overcome in 1974. It had always been the Railway's intention to build an entrance to the station in the corner of the Rural Bank Building because there was no room on the footpath. This entrance could be moved into the plaza, if created, a clear incentive for the Rural Bank's co-operation. The design of for the upper two blocks of Martin Place were finalised during 1975.\n\nThe design of the middle block between Castlereagh and Elizabeth Streets had, meanwhile, been held up by a number of considerations, partially connected to the railway. It was not clear if the concourse of the railway station would extend beyond the eastern side of Elizabeth Street. Secondly, it was a condition of consent for the MLC Centre, then under construction, that a subway be built under Castlereagh Street to connect the building to the station. Thirdly, the lessee of the old basements of the aborted State Savings Building, Prudential Insurance Company, were reluctant to surrender their lease to Council \"The architects were trying to bring all these issues together so that the MLC tunnel under Castlereagh Street would connect into a naturally lit shopping arcade in the basements and then join under Elizabeth Street to the railway concourse. If this was realised there would be an undercover connection from the amphitheatre on the western side of Castlereagh Street to the railway concourse\".\n\nThese issues took years to resolve; this section of Martin Place would be the last to be built. The Eastern Suburbs Railway line officially opened in 1979. Although originally proposed to extend southwards into Randwick, the line was only built to Bondi Junction. The shopping arcade and connection to the railway station was not made until 1982.\n\nThe design by Fowell Mansfield Jarvis & Maclurcan Pty Ltd was awarded a public buildings merit award by the Royal Australian Institute of Architects in 1979. Each station on the Eastern Suburbs Railway had a different colour to identify it. Bright red was used throughout Martin Place in both glazed tiles for walls and columns and painted cement surfaces. The red was chosen to reflect the banking and finance associations of the area. The design of the ESR underground stations continued the design ideas of the city underground stations of the 1920s, with individual station colours and features.\n\nIn 2010, work commenced on an upgrade to the station, consisting of two lifts and an accessible toilet. The upgrade was completed in April 2011.\n\nAs part of the Sydney Metro City & Southwest project a further two platforms are scheduled to open in 2024.\n\nThe station complex is below ground with access via stairs from Martin Place and then banks of three escalators to the concourse level. Pedestrian access is via arcades constructed at the same time as the station and leading to adjacent office and retail plazas. The ceiling of the public concourse above the platforms is raked following the topography of the street above and the supporting concrete beams are painted red to match the feature ceramic wall tiling, also in red.\n\nThe station consists of an island platform with two faces serving an Up and Down line. The platform is accessed via two sets of three escalators. The station and platforms are constructed of reinforced concrete finished with pre-cast white terrazzo panels, and red glazed ceramic wall tiles. A turnback siding is located east of the station.\n\nA service tunnel extends from Martin Place railway station under Sydney Hospital into The Domain. The tunnel carries air conditioning services from an underground room, which is located beneath two ventilation towers in The Domain, by the side of the road behind Sydney Hospital.\n\nAs at 6 October 2015, Martin Place underground railway station is significant as a representative of the latest major railway construction undertaken in the State in the eastern suburbs railway line. The whole of the structure being underground is a development of the structures built in the city in the 1930s and represents the latest in technology at the time. Martin Place Railway Station is significant as the only underground railway station constructed in the centre of the city within the last fifty years. It is a good example of a Late Twentieth-Century International style structure which is highly intact with many of its original materials and finishes still in place. Its design by architects Fowell Mansfield Jarvis & Maclurcan Pty Ltd was awarded a public buildings merit award by the Royal Australian Institute of Architects in 1979.\n\nMartin Place railway station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.\n\nThe place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.\n\nThis item is assessed as historically rare. This item is assessed as scientifically rare. This item is assessed as arch. rare. This item is assessed as socially rare.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The first version, 1.0.2, was released in October 1996, predating Sun's official Linux port.\n\nBlackdown Java supported Linux on architectures that the official version did not, including SPARC and PowerPC. The Blackdown project ended in August 2007, after Sun released an open source version of the HotSpot JVM as part of OpenJDK; OpenJDK is available under the free GNU General Public License. The Java software itself still exists on many mirrors.\n\nAt its close, Blackdown supported J2SE versions 1.4.2 on i386 and AMD64, 1.4.1 on SPARC, and 1.3.1 on PowerPC. Work on J2SE 1.5.x support for x86, AMD64, SPARC, and PowerPC had been announced, but was never released.\n\nIn 1999 Sun Microsystems and Inprise announced a port of Java to Linux. The port was based on Blackdown work, but the Blackdown team was not recognized or given any credit for the release. After some controversy, Sun publicly apologized to the Blackdown developers. The incident revealed that there were long standing problems between Sun and Blackdown.\n\nDespite widespread confusion, Blackdown was neither free software nor open-source software; this was due to licensing restrictions from Sun Microsystems. Its binary redistribution policy allowed it to be pre-installed or included with many Linux distributions (e.g., Gentoo Linux), whereas at the time, Sun Java's binary redistribution policy did not. Since Java 5, the Operating System Distributor License for Java (DLJ) met many Linux distributions' requirements, lessening the demand for the older Blackdown JVM.\n\nThe Blackdown team pioneered Sun's involvement with external, volunteer efforts. Steve Byrne, who was working at Sun at the time, worked with Sun legal to establish an agreement to license the Java test suite for a few Blackdown participants at no cost, and this was used to certify the Blackdown Java implementation as being 100% Java compatible.\n\nThe Blackdown team received recognition at the JavaOne conference in 1998 for the work that the team had been doing.\n"}

{"id": "2029551", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2029551", "title": "7th Issue", "text": "7th Issue\n\n7th Issue is the third studio album by Korean musician Seo Taiji. Although it is the third solo album by Seo, some refer to it as his seventh counting the four albums released by Seo Taiji and Boys. Instead of performing every instrument himself like he did on his previous two albums, Seo enlisted several well-known Japanese musicians among others. Although the album was a commercial success as the best-selling album of the year with 482,066 copies sold, it did not match the heights of his previous two. \"Live Wire\" won the 2004 Mnet Asian Music Award for Best Rock Performance.\n\nSeo Taiji explained that because he is curious and wants to try many styles of music, the style on \"7th Issue\" is \"\"sensitive-core\", which is hardcore that stresses the melodies. I wanted to bring out the sensitive side, and in particular, I expressed people's pain.\" The songs touch on social issues, such as sexual discrimination, the music industry, and stalkers.\n\nInstead of performing every instrument himself like he did on his previous two albums, Seo enlisted Japanese musicians J (Luna Sea), K.A.Z and I.N.A (both from hide with Spread Beaver) to contribute to the album among others. Guitarist Top and drummer Heff Holter would continue as part of his backing band for several years. Strings on the song \"0 (Zero)\" were arranged and conducted by Takayuki Hattori (Face Music). Many of Seo's fans have noted that the whole CD sounds like one very long song. This is because most of the songs are written in dropped C tuning with similar chord structures.\n\n\"Heffy End\" is perhaps the most loved song from the album. It is essentially a sad love song where a woman obsessively stalks and confines her lover. Although the title \"Heffy End\" might indicate a bit of irony, and Taiji justifies their deviated love from the norm by using purposely misspelled \"Heffy.\" Also of note is that the name of the album's drummer is Heff Holter.\n\n\"Nothing\" begins with a man's voice mocking about women's rights in Korea. The voice comments that sexism is becoming an issue because of such things as women rights campaigns, but he disagrees with the efforts that women put it that women are placed at higher level than men in (Korean) society. However, one should note that Taiji has put this as sarcasm, or to reflect what most men are thinking in South Korea.\n\n\"Victim\" is a song about female discrimination. The song caused controversy, being banned by the Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation.\n\n\"Live Wire\" is a song celebrating musical freedom. Taiji hails to his fans \"You feel me? Here I come to show you love\", referring to his steadfast devotion to music. The lyrics contain lots of poetic devices; the overall motif is the feeling of rock.\n\n\"Robot\" tells a story about a boy, or Taiji himself, who is destroyed by the cruelty that exists in the current overly digitalized society. After he has stopped checking his height on the doorway with his mom, he feels that his emotions are gone and can only think \"illogically\"; where the metaphor \"logical\" Taiji's view is things that are emotional and analogical, as his fans can easily catch from his previous works.\n\n\"October 4th\" represents a shift in his usual heavy metal style. \nAlso, if expressed in numerical form, October 4 would be 1004, which is read \"천사\"(\"chun-sa\", where \"chun\" is thousand and \"sa\"), and that reading of 1004 spells the same to mean \"angel\". The song is lightly driven by two guitars, one playing chords at complex rhythms and the other plays a repetitive (yet catchy) melody line. It later makes a transition into a full ensemble with heavy percussion and a bass guitar. The pensive lyrics tell the story of a man whose mind is flooded with memories of a lost love. He still regrets having lost her but acknowledges that she is \"like a fox\" (in the Korean culture, someone who is like a fox is sly and deceitful). In the end, he enjoys holding on to the memories and watches his former lover from afar, commenting how she's more beautiful than ever.\n\nThe title \"F.M Business\" stands for \"Fucked up Music Business\" as the lyric suggests. The song \"lampoons Korea's highly commercial music industry\" and Seo's \"frustration with having to return to a dirty business that he left because of his doubts about it.\"\n\nTaiji makes various accusations regarding the current direction Korean pop music is heading. In the early 1990s, Taiji introduced the concept of \"American\" music, such as hip-hop and rock. His ideology makes him detest the current trend in the Korean music scene. According to Taiji, idol groups (aka \"boybands\") were born for the sole purpose of making profit out of music. While he admits making the same mistake in the past, he is more concerned with asking musicians to take a look at themselves (\"You and me... why are we face to face here? For the selling my soul & music? For the making of money?\").\n\n\"0\" is a symphonic rock piece that spans five minutes and thirty seconds, the longest song on the album. Unlike the other songs, which follow a simple formula with guitar chords and a memorable melody line, 0 (Zero) consists of a noticeably more complex composition. A demanding song that showcases Taiji's mastery of music-writing as well as endurance when performed live, it features distortion guitars as well as clean guitar riffs during the vocals and harmonizing part. Strings were arranged by Takayuki Hattori of Face Music.\n\n\"7th Issue\" was a commercial success, selling 482,066 copies. Although South Korea's best-selling album of the year, it did not match the heights of Seo's previous two.\n\n\"Live Wire\" won the 2004 Mnet Asian Music Award for Best Rock Performance.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2029556", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2029556", "title": "List of historical tropical cyclone names", "text": "List of historical tropical cyclone names\n\nTropical cyclones are named for historical reasons and so as to avoid confusion when communicating with the public, as more than one tropical cyclone can exist at a time. Names are drawn in order from predetermined lists. They are usually assigned to tropical cyclones with one-, three- or ten-minute windspeeds of at least 65 km/h (40 mph). However, standards vary from basin to basin, with some tropical depressions named in the Western Pacific whilst tropical cyclones have to have gale-force winds occurring more than halfway around the center within the Australian and Southern Pacific regions.\n\nThe official practice of naming tropical cyclones started in 1945 within the Western Pacific. Naming continued through the next few years, and in 1950, names also started to be assigned to tropical storms forming in the North Atlantic Ocean. In the Atlantic, names were originally taken from the World War Two version of the Phonetic Alphabet, but this was changed in 1953 to use lists of women's names which were created yearly. Around this time naming of tropical cyclones also began within the southern and central parts of the Pacific. However naming did not begin in the Eastern Pacific until 1960, with the original naming lists designed to be used year after year in sequence. In 1960, naming also began in the Southwest Indian Ocean, and in 1963 the Philippine Meteorological Service started assigning names to tropical cyclones that moved into or formed in their area of responsibility. Later in 1963 warning centers within the Australian region also commenced naming tropical cyclones. In 2011, the Brazilian Navy Hydrographic Center started using naming list to name tropical cyclones over the South Atlantic basin.\n\nBy 1950, tropical cyclones that were judged by the US Weather Bureau to have intensified into a tropical storm started to be assigned names. Storms were originally named in alphabetical order using the World War Two version of the Phonetic Alphabet. By 1952 a new phonetic alphabet had been developed and this led to confusion as some parties wanted to use the newer phonetic alphabet. In 1953, to alleviate any confusion, forecasters decided to use a set of 23 feminine names. After the 1953 Atlantic hurricane season, public reception to the idea seemed favorable, so the same list was adopted for the next year with one change; Gilda for Gail. However, after storms like Carol and Hazel got a lot of publicity during the 1953 season, forecasters agreed to develop a new set of names for 1955. However, before this could happen, a tropical storm was declared significant on January 2, 1955 and was named as Alice. The new set of names were developed and used in 1955 beginning with Brenda continuing through the alphabet to Zelda. For each season before 1960, a new set of names was developed. In 1960 forecasters decided to begin rotating names in a regular sequence and thus four alphabetical lists were established to be repeated every four years. The sets followed the example of the western Pacific typhoon naming lists and excluded names beginning with the letters Q, U, X, Y and Z. These four lists were used until 1972 when the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) replaced them with 9 lists designed to be used from 1972. In 1977, NOAA made the decision to relinquish control over the name selection by allowing a regional committee of the World Meteorological Organization to select the new sets of names, which would contain male names and some Spanish and French names, in order to reflect all the cultures and languages within the Atlantic Ocean. The World Meteorological Organization decided that the new lists of hurricane name would start to be used in 1979. Since 1979 the same lists have been used, but with names of significant tropical cyclones removed from the lists and replaced with new names. In 2002 subtropical cyclones started to be assigned names from the main list of names set up for that year. In 2005, as all the names pre-selected for the season were exhausted, the contingency plan of using Greek letters for names had to be used. Since then there have been a few attempts to get rid of the Greek names, as they are seen to be inconsistent with the standard naming convention used for tropical cyclones and are considered generally unknown and confusing to the public. However, the lists of pre-selected names for the year are not expected to be used up frequently enough to warrant any change in the existing naming procedure and thus the Greek alphabet will be used if the list of pre-selected names should ever be used up again.\n\nWithin the Eastern Pacific basin between the western coasts of the Americas and 140°W the naming of tropical cyclones started in 1960, with four lists of female names initially designed to be used consecutively before being repeated. In 1965 after two lists of names had been used, it was decided to return to the top of the second list and to start recycling the sets of names on an annual basis.\n\nIn 1977, after protests by various women's rights groups, NOAA made the decision to relinquish control over the name selection by allowing a regional committee of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) to select new sets of names. The WMO selected six lists of names which contained male names and rotated every six years. They also decided that the new lists of hurricane name would start to be used in 1978 which was a year earlier than the Atlantic. Since 1978 the same lists of names have been used, with names of significant tropical cyclones removed from the lists and replaced with new names. As in the Atlantic basin should the names preselected for the season be exhausted, the contingency plan of using Greek letters for names would be used. However unlike in the Atlantic basin the contingency plan has never had to be used, although in 1985 to avoid using the contingency plan, the letters X, Y, and Z were added to the lists. Since the contingency plan had to be used in the North Atlantic during 2005 there have been a few attempts to get rid of the Greek names as they are seen to be inconsistent with the standard naming convention used for tropical cyclones and are generally unknown and confusing to the public. However none of the attempts have succeeded and thus the Greek letters will be used should the lists be used up.\n\nIn 1950 a tropical cyclone that affected Hawaii was named Able, after a tropical cyclone had not affected Hawaii for a number of years. The system was also named Salome by the Air Weather Service Office in Guam, before it became widely known as Hurricane Hiki, since Hiki is Hawaiian for Able. Typhoon Olive of 1952 developed within the Central Pacific, but was not named until it had crossed the International Dateline and moved into the Western Pacific basin. During 1957, three other tropical cyclones developed in the Central Pacific and were named Kanoa, Della and Nina, by the Hawaiian military meteorological offices. It was subsequently decided that future tropical cyclones, would be named by borrowing names from the Western Pacific naming lists. Hawaiian names were reinstated for the lists during 1979, with 5 sets of names drafted using only the 12 letters of the Hawaiian alphabet, with the intent being to use the sets of names on an annual rotation basis. However, after no storms had developed in this region between 1979 and 1981, the annual lists were scrapped and replaced with four sets of names and designed to be used consecutively. Ahead of the 2007 hurricane season, the Central Pacific Hurricane Center introduced a revised set of Hawaiian names for the Central Pacific, after they had worked with the University of Hawaii Hawaiian Studies Department to ensure the correct meaning and appropriate historical and cultural use of the names.\n\nIn the Western North Pacific Ocean, there are two sets of names generally used. The first are the international names assigned to a tropical cyclone by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) or the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC). The second set of names are local names assigned to a tropical cyclone by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration. This system often ends up with a tropical cyclone being assigned two names, should a tropical storm threaten the Philippines.\n\nOn January 1, 2000, the Japan Meteorological Agency, as the official Regional Specialized Meteorological Center, took over the naming of tropical cyclones in this basin. The names selected by the World Meteorological Organization's Typhoon Committee were from a pool of names submitted by the various countries that make up the Typhoon Committee.\n\nSince 1963, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA), have assigned their own names to typhoons that pass through its area of responsibility. Unlike the World Meteorological Organization's standard of assigning names to tropical cyclones when they reach wind-speeds of 65 km/h (40 mph), PAGASA assigns a name to a tropical depression when they either form or move into their area of responsibility. Four sets of tropical cyclone names are rotated annually with typhoon names stricken from the list should they do more than  pesos worth of damage to the Philippines and/or cause 300 or more deaths. Should the list of names for a given year prove insufficient, names are taken from an auxiliary list.\n\nDuring its annual session in 2000 the WMO/ESCAP Panel on North Indian tropical cyclones, agreed in principle to start assigning names to Cyclonic Storms that developed within the North Indian Ocean. As a result, the panel requested that each member country submit a list of ten names to a rapporteur by the end of the year 2000. At the 2001 session of the Panel, the rapporteur reported that seven of the eight countries had submitted their names. However, India had refused to submit a list of names, as it had some reservations about assigning names to tropical cyclones, due to the regional, cultural and linguistic diversity of the panel members. The panel subsequently studied the names and felt that some of the names would not be appealing to the public or the media, and requested that members submit new lists of names. At the following years session the rapporteur reported that there had been a poor response by member countries in resubmitting their lists of names. In response the panel felt that it was important that the work continued and urged the members to copperate and submit their names to the rapporteur. The names were subsequently submitted in time for the 2004 session, however, India had still not submitted their names, despite promising to do so. The rapporteur presented the 4 lists of names that would be used with a gap left for India's names and recommended that the India Meteorological Department's Regional Specialised Meteorological Centre in New Delhi name the systems. The rapporteur also recommended that the naming lists were used on an experimental basis during the season, starting in May or June 2004 and that the lists should only be used until 2009 when a new list would be drawn up for the following ten years. The naming lists were then completed in May 2004, after India submitted their names, however the lists were not used until September 2004 when the first tropical cyclone was named Onil by India Meteorological Department.\n\nIn January 1960, a formal naming scheme was introduced for the South-West Indian Ocean between Africa and 80°E, by the Mauritius and Madagascan Weather Services with the first cyclone being named Alix. Over the next few years the names were selected in various ways including by the meteorological services of the region for several years at a time, before it was turned over to the WMO's South West Indian Ocean Tropical Cyclone Committee at the start of the 2000-01 season.\n\nTropical cyclones in the Australian region are named by either the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, Indonesian Agency for Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics or the National Weather Service of Papua New Guinea. The naming of cyclones officially started during the 1963–64 tropical cyclone season, with the first name being assigned on January 6, 1964 to Cyclone Bessie. Female names were used exclusively until the current convention of alternating male and female names commenced in 1975. Names that cause significant damage within the Australian region are retired by the Bureau of Meteorology (Australia) with new names selected at the bi-annual meeting of the World Meteorological Organization's RA V Tropical Cyclone Committee. In 2008, the lists used by the three TCWC centres were combined to form a single list of names.\n\nTropical Cyclones started to be named within the South Pacific, by the New Caledonia Meteorological Office during the 1958–59 season. The Fiji Office of the New Zealand Meteorological Service subsequently started to also name cyclones during the 1969–70 season with Alice being the first name to be used.\n\nDuring March 2004, a rare tropical cyclone developed within the Southern Atlantic, about to the east-southeast of Florianópolis in southern Brazil. As the system was threatening the Brazilian state of Santa Catarina, a newspaper used the headline \"Furacão Catarina,\" which was presumed to mean \"furacão (hurricane) threatening (Santa) Catarina (the state)\". However, when the international press started monitoring the system, it was assumed that \"Furacão Catarina\" meant \"Cyclone Catarina\" and that it had been formally named in the usual way. During March 12, 2010, public and private weather services in Southern Brazil, decided to name a tropical storm Anita in order to avoid confusion in future references. A naming list was subsequently set up by the Brazilian Navy Hydrographic Center with the names Arani, Bapo, Cari, Deni, Eçaí, Guará, Iba, Jaguar and Kurumí subsequently taken from that list during 2011, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2019 and 2020, respectively.\n\n\n"}

The valleys have limited vegetation and soil, containing a variety of different colored rocks and diverse fauna and flora. The best known and largest makhtesh is Makhtesh Ramon.\n\nAlthough commonly referred to as \"craters\", these formations are \"erosion cirques\" (steephead valleys or box canyons). Craters are formed by the impact of a meteor or volcanic eruption, whereas makhteshes are created by erosion. \n\nThe word makhtesh is the Hebrew word for a mortar grinder (). The geological landform was given this name because of its similarity to a grinding bowl.\n\nWhere a hard outer layer of rock covers softer rocks, erosion removes the softer minerals relatively quickly, and they are washed away from under the harder rock. The harder rocks eventually collapse under their own weight, and a crater-like valley structure is formed. In Negev and Sinai makhteshes, the hard rocks are limestone and dolomites, while the inner softer rocks are chalk or sandstone. \n\nThe center of the Negev is dominated by northeast-southwest anticlinal ridges.

It offers secondary education leading to the Singapore-Cambridge GCE Ordinary Level and Singapore-Cambridge GCE Normal Level examination.\n\nSwiss Cottage Secondary School started in 1962 with about 200 pupils, housed at Raffles Institution in Bras Basah Road as the school building along Dunearn Road was still under construction. In July 1963, students and staff moved into a new school premises at Swiss Cottage Estate (along Dunearn Road), which officially opened in November 1963, with an enrollment of about 870 pupils in two media, namely English and Malay. In 1966, the then Minister of Law and National Development, Mr E.W. Barker, described Swiss Cottage as one of the foremost integrated schools in Singapore.\nIn 1991, the school relocated from Dunearn Road to its current Bukit Batok campus. In 1997, Swiss Cottage was ranked top 19 in Singapore.\n\nThe crest is headed by five stars which symbolise Equality, Peace, Progress, Justice and Democracy. These are ideals on which a brotherhood of persons can be built. Below, there is a torch which signifies the light of knowledge and the love of learning. Encompassing it are the five rings symbolising sports and the part they play to link persons together. The five horizontal bands denote the five houses as rivals in competition but steadfast in fraternity.\n\nSwiss Cottage's uniform consists of a white collard shirt with an embroidered crest and long white trousers for all male students, and a white blouse with an embroidered crest and turquoise-blue 4-pleated skirt for female students. \n\nFor official functions, students representing the school would wear a turquoise blazer, with a white long-sleeved shirt with long white trousers for males, and a long-sleeved blouse with a pleated white skirt for females. A turquoise tie is worn and formal dress shoes are worn for males, and court shoes for females.\n\nSwiss Cottage Secondary offers three academics streams, the 4-year Express Stream, Normal (Academic) Stream, and the Normal (Technical) Stream. The Express stream leads to the Singapore-Cambridge GCE Ordinary Level examinations, while the Normal (Academic & Technical) streams leads to the Singapore-Cambridge GCE Normal Level examinations. \n\nSwiss Cottage Secondary School became one of the six Community Youth Leadership (CYL) schools in Singapore in 2014. To effect the CYL function well, we developed the distinctive Thoughtful Leadership Programme (TLP). The TLP is also the Learning for Life (LLP) curriculum that propels the Thoughtful Leadership focus. It is one of the two Distinctive Programmes (the second being the Applied Sciences for Sustainable Development Programme) of the school.\n\nThe Applied Sciences programme was developed and launched in 2014 to educate our youths about sustainable development. The programme provides a platform for students to develop knowledge and confidence about their potential roles in helping to ensure our future.\n\nStarted in 2014, the Enhanced Citizenship Programme complements the school’s Humanities Programme and enlivens the outcomes of Character and Citizenship Education by tapping on multiple platforms. The study of Conservation that the programme puts a sharp focus on helps students to navigate the balance between rootedness and openness in an age of globalization and modernity.\n\nSwiss Cottage Secondary School is one of the 28 secondary schools selected by the Ministry of Education to start piloting aspects of Full Subject-Based Banding (abbreviation: SBB) from 2020 onwards. With Full SBB, the school is moving towards one secondary education, with many subject bands, to better meet students’ learning needs, without labels. This is part of the broader shift in the education system to recognise the strengths and interests of students, to help them build their confidence and develop an intrinsic motivation to learn for life in them.\n\nStudent are enrolled through the Direct School Admission (Abbreviation: DSA) or the Joint Admissions Exercise (Abbreviation: JAE). Swiss Cottage's cut-off point for the Express Stream has consistently been within the 235-240 range, making it one of the top 40 secondary schools in Singapore. Swiss Cottage does not have affiliations with other schools or institutions. \nSwiss Cottage offers 20 co-curriculum activities (abbreviation: CCA). These CCAs include uniformed groups, sports, performing arts, and clubs and societies. \n\nThe school is notable for its military band, the Singapore National Cadet Corps (NCC) Command Band “Swiss Winds”. The Command Band primarily provides musical support in HQ NCC's military functions, in addition to other uniformed services. In the local band scene, the Command Band has consistently achieved Distinction in the Singapore Youth Festival, and has been a part of the National Day Parade’s Parade and Ceremony Combined Band since 2010. \n\nThe school is also well-known for its floor ball team which has achieved National 1 Runner Up in Schools Championship ‘C’ Division Girls in 2018.\n\nThe school's Uniformed Groups are also particularly notable, with the National Cadet Corps (Air) achieving Gold in the Best Unit Competition in 2017, Girl Guides achieving the Puan Noor Aishah Gold Award, Scouts achieving the Frank Coopers Sand Gold Award in 2017, and St. John's Brigade achieving Corps Achievement Gold Award.\n"}

This colorless, flammable liquid is a common solvent and a widely used intermediate in the manufacture of other chemicals.\n\nThe major use of chlorobenzene is as an intermediate in the production of commodities such as herbicides, dyestuffs, and rubber. Chlorobenzene is also used as a high-boiling solvent in many industrial applications as well as in the laboratory. Chlorobenzene is nitrated on a large scale to give a mixture of 2-nitrochlorobenzene and 4-nitrochlorobenzene, which are separated. These mononitrochlorobenzenes are converted to related 2-nitrophenol, 2-nitroanisole, bis(2-nitrophenyl)disulfide, and 2-nitroaniline by nucleophilic displacement of the chloride, with respectively sodium hydroxide, sodium methoxide, sodium disulfide, and ammonia. The conversions of the 4-nitro derivative are similar.\n\nChlorobenzene once was used in the manufacture of certain pesticides, most notably DDT, by reaction with chloral (trichloroacetaldehyde), but this application has declined with the diminished use of DDT. At one time, chlorobenzene was the main precursor for the manufacture of phenol:\n\nThe reaction also has a byproduct of salt. The reaction is known as the Dow process, with the reaction carried out at 350 °C using fused sodium hydroxide without solvent. Labeling experiments show that the reaction proceeds via elimination/addition, through benzyne as the intermediate.\n\nIt was first described in 1851. Chlorobenzene is manufactured by chlorination of benzene in the presence of a catalytic amount of Lewis acid such as ferric chloride, sulfur dichloride, and anhydrous aluminium chloride:\nThe catalyst enhances the electrophilicity of the chlorine. Because chlorine is electronegative, CHCl exhibits somewhat decreased susceptibility to further chlorination. Industrially the reaction is conducted as a continuous process to minimize the formation of dichlorobenzenes.\n\nChlorobenzene is producible from aniline via benzenediazonium chloride, otherwise known as the Sandmeyer reaction.\n\nChlorobenzene exhibits \"low to moderate\" toxicity as indicated by its of 2.9 g/kg. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has set a permissible exposure limit at 75 ppm (350 mg/m) over an eight-hour time-weighted average for workers handling chlorobenzene.\n\nChlorobenzene can persist in soil for several months, in air for about 3.5 days, and in water for less than one day. Humans may be exposed to this agent via breathing contaminated air (primarily via occupational exposure), consuming contaminated food or water, or by coming into contact with contaminated soil (typically near hazardous waste sites). However, because it has only been found at 97 out of 1,177 NPL hazardous waste sites, it is not considered a widespread environmental contaminant. The bacterium \"Rhodococcus phenolicus\" degrades chlorobenzene as sole carbon sources.\n\nUpon entering the body, typically via contaminated air, chlorobenzene is excreted both via the lungs and the urinary system.\n\nIn 2015, the SAM science team announced that the Curiosity rover reported evidence of higher concentrations of chlorobenzene in a sedimentary rock, named \"Cumberland\", on Mars. The team speculated that the chlorobenzene might have been produced when the sample was heated in the instrument sampling chamber. The heating would have triggered a reaction of organics in the Martian soil, which is known to contain perchlorate.\n\n"}

This is possible with the help of variational parameters, which are determined by optimization order by order in formula_4. The partial sums are converted to convergent partial sums by a method developed in 1992.\n\nMost perturbation expansions in quantum mechanics are divergent for any small coupling strength formula_4. They can be made convergent by VPT (for details see the first textbook cited below). The convergence is exponentially fast.\nAfter its success in quantum mechanics, VPT has been developed further to become an important mathematical tool in quantum field theory with its anomalous dimensions. Applications focus on the theory of critical phenomena. It has led to the most accurate predictions of critical exponents.\nMore details can be read here.\n\n"}
{"id": "2029637", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2029637", "title": "Palayamkottai", "text": "Palayamkottai\n\nPalayankottai (also Palamcottah) is a prominent neighbourhood in Tirunelveli City, India. It is part of the Tirunelveli City Municipal Corporation. It is on the eastern bank of the Thamirabarani river, while downtown Tirunelveli is on the western bank.\n\nThe archaic word \"Palayankottai\" in Tamil means a small administrative region or district. A \"Kottai\" is a fort. The portmanteau Tamil word Palayankottai was hence derived historically from an ancient fort that was in the centre of the region. Today, the fort lies in ruins and is almost camouflaged by its surrounding old residential edifices. To anyone who reads about Palayankottai for the first time, it may be surprising to see that atlases and other books refer to the city with both, an M or an N (Palayamkottai or Palayankottai). This uncertainty is because the actual Tamil word for the city uses an alphabet that is phonetically between M and N, and sometimes even completely substituted by G (\"pronounced Palayangkottai in colloquial Tamil\"). Natively speaking, it is hence correctly pronounced as Palayamnkottai. Historically during the British Raj, the area was referred to as Palancottah and also Palamkottah. The anglicization of the word was dropped by the locals immediately after independence, and the city is now called both Palayankottai and Palayamkottai according to official government documents and records. For disambiguation, the city is referred to as Palayankottai in this article.\n\nTirunelveli and Palayamkottai called as Twin city. Palayamkottai is situated on the eastern bank of the perennial Thamirabarani river. The region is very fertile and supports a thriving agrarian community in the midst of many urbanized areas. Regular monsoon rains coupled with the Thamirabarani water, support the purely agricultural villages around the city. Palayamkottai is located on the National Highway in close proximity to many bigger cities (international seaport: Tuticorin - 45 km; international airports: Trivandrum - 140 km, Madurai - 150  km; domestic airport: Tuticorin - 25 km) hence supporting trade and commerce.\n\nPalayamkottai has always been a rather laid-back little city. Among the elite population, it is sometimes called as a \"Pensioner's Paradise\". However, in recent years, businesses are rapidly developing and local businessmen are opening up major outlets in capital cities in response to their regional successes. However, it was only in late 2004 when the first ATM was installed in Palayamkottai and it was an instant success. In 2005, the government project of Underground drainage was undertaken and finished in about mid 2006. Similarly it was only in early 2006 that the city had its first traffic lights. In 2007, the city had a popular landmark - the district Police Headquarters, a remarkable purple building in the city centre. Close to it, is also one of the first Ladies' Police stations in the southern districts. Although broadband (256 kbit/s) was introduced in 2005, it was only on New Year's Day 2007, that BSNL announced 2 Mbit/s broadband access in the city commercially. Faster cable internet services are available by the year 2016 with speeds supporting up to 10 Mbit/s.\n\nMajor localities in Palayamkottai are Vannarapettai, Murugankuruchi, Market, Samathanapuram, Rahmathnagar, Perumalpuram, Maharaja nagar, High Grounds, VM Chatram and KTC Nagar and posh town called Santhi Nagar out of which Vannarpettai, Murugankurichi and Market are concentrated with largely commercial activities. There are also several other minor suburban areas which collectively contribute to the overall cityscape of Palayamkottai.\nThe little city also has a Government Museum with a huge and realistic fibreglass \"Tyrannosaurus rex\" which is very popular among the young people of Palayamkottai. The museum houses a small collection of ancient artifacts found in the areas surrounding the city. Some of its literary collections include ancient Tamil inscriptions in palm leaves.\n\nPalayamkottai also has one of the most popular Science Centres in South India, a satellite unit of Visvesvaraya Industrial and Technological Museum, Bangalore. Since the Science Centre lies between Palayamkottai and Tirunelveli (the twin cities) and as it is difficult to mark a border between the two, it is often called as the Tirunelveli District Science Centre (by the district's name). It is a popular hangout area for young people, and is frequently visited by teams of school students to explore and learn the principles of science through the centre's interesting outdoor equipment and experiments.\n\nPalayamkottai has many hospitals and other medical facilities. Among them, Our Lady's Hospital, founded nearly 50 years ago by a Belgian nun called Sister Delphine Bruyndonx, was and still remains one of Palayamkottai's popular hospitals for people who are poor or disadvantaged. Sister Delphine was popularly called the \"Teresa of Tirunelveli\" by all the people who knew her, because she had served this society since a time when it did not have any electricity.\n\n\"Shifa Hospital\" one of the oldest and leading centre in Tirunelveli district and popular among the locals.\n\nGovernment Siddha Medical College Hospital is a leading siddha hospital, established in 1964.\n\nCSI Bell Pins Mission Hospital and the recently renovated CSI Jeyaraj Annapackiam Hospital in Palayamkottai provide free and reduced cost medical services to the local community. Dental clinics like NST Muthiah memorial dental hospital, Captain Manickam, Doss, Charli dental and Raakshak are popular among the locals. The Tirunelveli Medical college Hospital - a tertiary referral center, located in the High Grounds provides free services to poor people. Many nursing homes like Annai Velankani, Kartheek, Pushpalatha, Lakshmi Hospital and Celin hospital are famous for their maternity care with all the latest medical equipment. Other eminent hospitals in the region are Rosemary, Shifa Hospital, Galaxy, Devi and Sudharsanam hospital. Muthu Damian Hospital near the Palayamkottai bus depot offers both traditional Siddha treatment and modern medicine. Angel Heart centre is one of the leading heart speciality hospital. Palayamkottai also has a specialized kidney care centre and heart surgery centre. The city also has four blood banks: Shifa hospitals, Aarthi, Bethel and at Government Medical college hospital.\nFor Paediatrics Krishna children's Hospital and Maternity Home serves as a private referral Hospital since 1983 and one of the most popular hospitals for maternity. Also we have Agnes hospital for Maternity and Dr Sundarajans hospital one of the oldest and popular place for general practise.\n\nBeing a student city, Palayamkottai has many playgrounds filled with hyperactive young cricketers. Palayamkottai has two major public playgrounds: the \"VOC maithanam\" and the \"Anna Stadium\". Grand celebrations during the Republic day and Independence day are conducted by various schools in the VOC ground. State Level Hockey tournaments sponsored by Bell Pins are held in VOC grounds annually. A beautiful park and an Indoor Stadium has been built here in this ground, in order to cover the small children and youngsters. The Anna Stadium holds field hockey and Kabbadi matches at both district and state level. The stadium has an excellent professional German Hockey Turf, which trains a lot of young and energetic teams and Sports Development Authority of Tamil Nadu (SDAT)has recently released tenders for installation of synthetic athletic track in it. The stadium also houses a well maintained swimming pool.\n\nThere is a big market in central Palayamkottai, serviced by many bus routes. Also very popular among locals, is the Ulavar Santhai where farmers sell their products directly. The produce is very fresh and very cheap, and the market is usually very crowded in the morning with eager housewives excersing their haggling skills with the illiterate farmers. The success of the Ulavar Santhai market in Palayamkottai was under a deep speculation during the changing of governments. Now, with the ruling party DMK back in power, (which originally introduced the concept) the Ulavar Santhai is maintained well and is a popular grocery market for the locals.\n\nSupermarkets like Aryaas Supermarket have revolutionized shopping in Palayamkottai by bringing all homeneeds into a common commercial zone. Although there are not many supermarkets in Palayamkottai, there are practically all kinds of shops catering to the local people's needs. For example, electronic superstores like Viveks, Sathya and Vasanth & Co are prime hotspots for the digital lifestyle. RMKV and Colors are frequented by people for purchase of clothes and readymade garments. Eagle Book Centre, Shyamala book centre and Velavan are exclusive choices for good books and stationery. RMKV and Baby's Gallery cater to the needs of the kids segment. The entry of big players like Big Bazaar and Reliance Hypermall further promotes the economical status of Palayamkottai. Palayamkottai being a small city, brings a visitor back to square one in terms of shopping for quality goods.\n\nPalaymakottai is also a very clean city with beautiful trees situated in the bank of Thamirabarani river.\n\nPalayamkottai has excellent schools for the blind, deaf and mentally handicapped children. These organizations are predominantly run by the Tirunelveli Diocese of Church of South India(CSI), they are\n\n\nLeprosy missions, orphanages and medical missions are also very active organizations in Palayamkottai\n\nPalayamkottai also has an efficient fire-fighting service which conducts camps in local schools annually. The postal service is also a reputed and historic department with its statues of Nandhis (mascot of the Indian Postal department) at the facade.\nIt also has the post offices, police stations, big malls, markets, etc.\n\nPalayamkottai has an efficient bus network. Palayamkottai Bus Stand, or \"Palai Bus Stand\" as it is popularly called by the locals, was the major connecting hub of the City bus network. In 2003, the then Chief minister J.Jayalalithaa inaugurated a major new bus terminal for Tirunelveli in Veinthankulam on Tiruvananthapuram High Road. The new bus terminal connects Palayamkottai and Tirunelveli in an extensive network of neighbouring towns, cities and also the major metropolitan cities of Chennai, Bangalore and Hyderabad. The Palayamkottai bus terminal is also a major stopover for all buses going to Kanyakumari and Nagercoil. There are also numerous connections between the local Palayamkottai bus-stops and Tirunelveli town. Palayamkottai also has a railway station on the Tirunelveli Junction to Tuticorin railway station and Tiruchendur Junction lines\n\nShare-autos (autorickshaws that car-pool paying customers on a common route) ply extensively along Palayamkottai's streets and are easy to flag down. The regular yellow-black Greaves Garuda autorickshaws, although plenty in number, are considered to be the common man's taxis of Palayamkottai. Autorickshaw drivers are known to overcharge tourists. Cars as taxis, are generally only available in taxi stands where tourists and locals use them to travel to short distances outside of the city. As a common practise, people of Palayamkottai or Tirunelveli do not use taxis as an alternate public transportation to buses or trains. Ola taxis have gained popularity with other private taxis as they are cheap than autos.\n\nThe city has several famous Hindu temples: The Gopalaswamy Temple, Siva Temple known as Thiripuraanthakaeshwarar temple, Ramar Temple, and Amman(goddess) temples. Dasara is a popular Hindu festival in this region. The renovation of the lord Gopalaswamy temple was completed by the Government of Tamil Nadu recently. It is a Vaishvanite temple symbolizing the cultural and architectural ancestry of the city. The herbal wall paintings found inside the sanctum sanctorum are considered rare. After renovation, the Azhagiyamannar Rajagopalaswamy Temple, built in the 11th century, popularly known as Gopalasamy Temple celebrated Kumbhabhishekham on 9 July 2009. Popular temples in Palayamkottai are also located in Maharajanagar, Perumalpuram and Shanthi nagar. In particular, Aayirathamman temple,Yadavar Uchinimakali Amman temple and Thoothuvari temple (in its vicinity) and Shri.Muppandal Essaki Amman Temple near Perumalpuram are notable temples. Aazhigudi Maradachan with a monolithic high Ayyanar statue is also popular. \n\nA popular mosque in the city is located in old Police Hospital road, with hundreds of Islamic followers chanting their prayers regularly. Melapalayam is the exclusive Muslim quarter of the city, with numerous mosques and schools for children of Islamic parents.\n\nThe city is an epicenter in south Tamil Nadu for Christianity and there are a lot of churches affiliated to Tirunelveli Diocese Church of South India (CSI), Society Of Jesus and others. The biggest and most widely recognized church in Palayamkottai is The Holy Trinity Cathedral of CSI at Murugankurichi. With its prominent centenary 35m high steeple, it is fondly called the 'Oosi Gopuram' (Needle Tower). Extensive renovations of the church were done during the period of Rev.Anand Asir, Rev.Dr.Joshva Raja and Rev.Vedhanbu, who worked as priests in the Trinity Cathedral in Palayamkottai and re-dedicated during the period of Bishop Jason S. Dharmarj and the Rev. V. Gandhi Selwyn, Former Bishop Commissary & Vice Chairman, CSI Tirunelveli Diocese. India's first church, Clarinda Church was founded and consecrated in 1860 by a Brahmin lady who was the first convert in the southern districts. The periphery of this tiny church has a cemetery with wonderfully decorated tombstones from England.Also there are numbers of famous churches found around tirunelveli which are built during British period like military lines church and new built up congregations are also at perumalpuram church, shanthi nagar church and KTC nagar church.\n\nSt. Francis Xavier who was responsible for propagation of Christianity in the 16th century in Southern districts of Tamil Nadu had travelled to Palayamkottai. Fr.Joseph Constantine Beschi SJ, better known in Tamil as 'Veeramaamunivar', propagated Christianity in the area. St.Xaviers' Cathedral church, situated at the heart of St. Xaviers' College and established by Jesuit priests, now belongs to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Palayamkottai. It is one of the earliest Catholic Churches in Palayamkottai. The St.Xaviers' College church is dedicated to Our Lady of the Assumption. It is an architectural amalgamation combining Christian, Hindu and Muslim architectures.\n\nPalayamkottai is rightly called the \"Oxford of South India\". Almost all the best schools, colleges and institutions of higher education in and around Tirunelveli district are located in Palayamkottai, some of which date back to more than a century. The architecture of many of these old institutions are said to resemble the majesty, elegance and academic fortitude of the real Oxford and Cambridge Universities. The imperialistic old stone buildings maintain their name and fame after so many years of creating dynamic young individuals. These educational precincts with large squares, verdant gardens, elaborate cathedrals, strict headmasters and white-robed fathers create the ambience of an Etonian or Harrovian education.\n\nThe District Educational Officer (DEO) and Chief Educational Officer (CEO) control the activities of all the educational institutions in the city. Their offices are in Kokarakulam (behind the District Science Centre) and in Tirunelveli town respectively.\n\nMost schools in Palayamkottai were founded by the Christian missionaries almost a hundred years ago. Schools like St.Xavier's Hr.Sec. School, popularly known for its discipline and good education, St. John's Higher Secondary School, MDT Hindu College Higher Secondary School (the oldest School in Tirunelveli, of which Bharathiar, VaVu C and Pulamaipithan were eminent alumni) and Schafter High School have roughly 12,000 boys altogether, M.N. Abdur Rahman Higher Secondary School, High Ground, Cathedral Hr. Sec. School is located in the heart of the city under the shadow of the famous Holy Trinity Cathedral Church. Girls Schools like Mary Sargent Higher Secondary School, St. Ignatius' Convent Higher Secondary School and Sarah Tucker Hr. Sec School have over 10,000 girls enrolled. These girls' schools are very popular for their strict code of conduct and extraordinary skills level of their huge young girls' population. It is mostly these institutions that employ the large teaching community of Palayamkottai.\n\nIn recent years, schools in Palayamkottai have gained a state-level recognition and some are even known all around South India. Rosemary matriculation higher secondary school, Pushpalatha vidya mandir(CBSE), Chinmaya vidhyalaya, Jeyandara saraswathi swamigal school at maharajanagar, Magdalene high school, Bell international school, IIPE Matric Hr.Sec. are some schools.\n\nSoon after completing Higher Secondary education, most young people opt for a college education right within the city. Their wide range of options include excellent medical colleges like the Tirunelveli Medical College and Govt. Siddha Medical College; engineering colleges like the Government Engineering College and Francis Xavier Engineering College; Arts and Science colleges like St. Xavier's College, Palayamkottai, St. John's College, Sadakathullah Appa College, MDT Hindu College and Sarah Tucker College (STC), most of these being over 100 years old.\n\nSt.Xavier's College recently celebrated its 150th anniversary of the Jesuit Priests who founded the great institution. The college truly resembles those in Oxford and Cambridge, with huge, historic and monumental stone structures. The college has also opened up a stunning new library in 2005 with many modern amenities for the student generation of today. The campus also has halls of residences for its large number of resident students. St. Xavier's College of Education and St.John's College are the other xavier institutes with an age restriction for admission, similar to most other colleges in India.\n\nSarah Tucker College, established in 1895 by the Christian Missionary Society, was the first college for women in South India. It is named after Ms.Sarah Tucker, a physically challenged lady confined to her room in England, who was moved by the reports of the appalling condition of the women in this region due to their illiteracy. She stepped in with a crusading spirit to provide education and uplift them. This girls-only college has over eleven departments of education today.\n\nThe Government Siddha Medical college and Hospital is a pioneering institution in Siddha Medicine in Tamil Nadu, established in 1964. Tirunelveli Medical college, also located in Palayamkottai, is a leading institution in the field of medical studies.\n\nThere are lot of NGO's in the city of which Saranalayam is for Abandoned babies, Street Children and Woman in Distress. Udavum Karangal is one among the various organizations for the poor orphan girls and boys, which has been run successfully since 1990.\n\nPalayamkottai also has a jail called Palayamkottai Central Prison, which housed several eminent people during the pre-independence era and afterwards. Tamil language poet Subramanya Bharathi spent a part of his life here. The District Central Jail is notable for its large capacity and tight security. The prison is a popular landmark along the periphery of the city. Even the former Chief Minister, J.Jayalalitha (Late) was thrice held in Palayamkottai jail.\n\nTirunelveli city is expected to grow rapidly in a few years because of the large number of professional students that it produces from its Engineering and Medical colleges. Young entrepreneurs are now abundant and the environment is rapidly modernising with huge billboards, great restaurants, popular malls and big retail shops. The city has already revamped its police headquarters, telecommunications offices, district court and many other government bodies - which are all positive signs of a modernizing metropolitan society. Residential areas in Palayamkottai are getting to have unique styles, excellent roads and public utilities, along with numerous high-rise apartments in the horizon. Beautiful villas with swimming pools are becoming commonplace, along with many gyms, modern eateries and stocked libraries.\n\nPalayamkottai assembly constituency is a part of Tirunelveli (Lok Sabha constituency).\n"}

It has been associated with iron deficiency anemia, and shown to respond to iron supplementation,\nleading some investigators to postulate that some forms of pica may be the result of nutritional deficiency. Chewing ice may lessen pain in glossitis related to iron deficiency anemia. However, the American Dental Association recommends not chewing ice because it can crack teeth; instead ice should be allowed to melt in the mouth.\n\nFolk wisdom (and some early investigators) maintained that pica reflected an appetite to compensate for nutritional deficiencies, such as low iron or zinc. Some forms of pica (as in pregnant women who are iron deficient) can be treated by supplementing the nutrient.\n\nLater research has demonstrated that the substances ingested generally do not provide the mineral or nutrient in which patients are deficient. As the people start eating nonfoods, pica can also cause the nutritional deficiencies with which it is associated. In one case study, pagophagia was reported to \"cause\" iron deficiency anemia. At the same time, however, the researchers suggested that chewing ice may benefit stomatitis and glossitis. The nutrients obtained from nonfoods such as soil or ice will vary widely depending on geographic location. For example, ice made from hard water will contain more minerals, especially calcium and magnesium, but simply drinking the water will provide the same minerals.\n"}

Elder, was the owner of the Norman Elder Museum at 140 Bedford road in the Annex, an affluent neighbourhood in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.\n\nNorman Elder was the son of Robert James Elder, wealthy founder of Elder Carriage Works, the first carriage business in southern Canada. The company provided carriages for the Eaton's Company.\n\nHe grew up on Park Lane Circle, Toronto, where he discovered himself, his love of animals, and his knack for outrageous endeavors.\n\nElder was lifelong friends with Canadian businessmen Galen Weston and Conrad Black.\n\nHe was a graduate of Upper Canada College, the University of Western Ontario and the University of Toronto.\n\nHe also ran for Alderman in Toronto where he had many remarkable television interviews before losing.\n\nIn 1998, an Ontario Court sentenced Elder to two years less a day in prison for sexual contact with several young men.\n\nElder died on Wednesday, October 15, 2003 in Toronto of an apparent suicide by hanging. Along with Robin Hardy and Scott Symons, he was the subject of a chapter in Ian Young's 2013 book \"Encounters with Authors: Essays on Scott Symons, Robin Hardy, Norman Elder\".\n\nThe museum was a private home containing thousands of artifacts collected from his travels. The upper floors of the Museum served as a rooming house for up to 10 tenants.\n\nTwo of the interior scenes in David Cronenberg's film Naked Lunch were shot in the Museum's main living room and library.\n\nThe Norman Elder Museum was home a number of exotic animals. 'Tony', a Galapagos Islands tortoise, lived for many years, roaming the first floor. He ate lettuce and would often walk to those in the room. He enjoyed his neck being scratched, and would extend it during the process. He eventually fell ill and was transported to Guelph University hospital, where he died. There, he was frozen until he could be delivered to a taxidermist. He was eventually returned to the museum stuffed.\n\nAlso living in the museum were two very large pythons and a boa constrictor which lived in the basement and often escaped to other parts of the house. Also residing in the house from time to time were a fruit bat, three lemurs, several chinchillas and numerous ferrets.\n\nOf the myriad artifacts displayed within the museum, the most peculiar were a reconstructed panther skeleton, a collection of grapefruit-sized turquoise malachite eggs, fossilized elephant bird eggs, unexploded military mortar shells, an elephant skull with jaw-bone, dried elephant dung balls, a stuffed dingo, and various human skulls from the Ganges river.\n\nThe front garden of the museum was enclosed by an 8 foot high iron polar bear fence purchased from the Riverdale Zoo during renovations.\n\nThe back garden held an underground, granite-walled tunnel which led to a room known as the \"tomb\". The entrance to the tunnel was a secret doorway under Elder's bed in the first-floor master bedroom.\n\n140 Bedford Rd. was gutted and renovated after Elder's death, leaving little trace of the house's former occupant. Norman's beloved dog Charley (who was stuffed and mounted on a movable wheeled platform) was retrieved and is owned by a private collector.\n\nAs an explorer, Elder embarked on lengthy expeditions to remote areas of Papua New Guinea, Namibia, the Amazon, the Congo, the Arctic, Madagascar, and many other countries. He founded the Canadian Chapter of the Explorers Club in 1979.\n\nHe wrote 'This Thing of Darkness', a book about the Amazon with the foreword written by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.\n\nNorman Elder was an accomplished equestrian. He competed as a member of the Canadian Equestrian Team in Three-Day Eventing at the Olympic Games, first in Rome in 1960, and again in Mexico City in 1968.\n\nHe also competed in the 1959 Pan-American Games, where in he placed third individually riding Prince Maple, and also won team gold. In 1967 he finished second individually, riding Ranae Doe.\n\nHis brother Jim Elder also competed in the Olympics six times in equestrian events, winning one gold medal.\n\nElder was the author of 'The Norman Elder Horse Book'.\n\nIn 1998, Elder pleaded guilty to indecently assaulting 10 young men between 1970 and 1980. On March 12, 1998, Judge Faith Finnestad sentenced Elder to two years less a day in jail.\n\nThe men were all between the ages of 18 and 20 at the time of the encounters but Canada's laws at the time gave 21 as the age of consent for same-sex contact.\n\n\n\n"}

Because of the political unrest, he attended private schools. In 1864, with the support of his parents, he enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich, where he studied under Alexander von Wagner. Later, from 1867 to 1869, his teacher was Karl von Piloty. While there, he met Wilhelm Leibl, who introduced him to plein-air painting. After seeing a major art exhibition in 1869, he was anxious to get to work and left the Academy.\n\nIn 1870, at the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War he moved to Genoa and was inclined to stay there, but returned in 1872 at the urging of his father. Once there, he set up a studio near one operated by his friend, Arnold Böcklin. The following year, he got married. Soon, he was largely occupied with financial matters and his painting suffered. After years of critical abuse and increasing family problems, he gave up painting for over a decade, beginning in 1882.\n\nIn 1887, his problems culminated in a divorce. For the next few years, he concentrated on raising his son Félix, who had remained with him. When Félix left home, his friends began a campaign to convince him that he should start painting again. In 1894, they organized a retrospective exhibition where one of his works was purchased by the Emperor Franz Joseph.

The correlation energy is a measure of how much the movement of one electron is influenced by the presence of all other electrons.\n\nWithin the Hartree–Fock method of quantum chemistry, the antisymmetric wave function is approximated by a single Slater determinant. Exact wave functions, however, cannot generally be expressed as single determinants. The single-determinant approximation does not take into account Coulomb correlation, leading to a total electronic energy different from the exact solution of the non-relativistic Schrödinger equation within the Born–Oppenheimer approximation. Therefore, the Hartree–Fock limit is always above this exact energy. The difference is called the \"correlation energy\", a term coined by Löwdin. The concept of the correlation energy was studied earlier by Wigner.\n\nA certain amount of electron correlation is already considered within the HF approximation, found in the electron exchange term describing the correlation between electrons with parallel spin. This basic correlation prevents two parallel-spin electrons from being found at the same point in space and is often called Fermi correlation. Coulomb correlation, on the other hand, describes the correlation between the spatial position of electrons due to their Coulomb repulsion, and is responsible for chemically important effects such as London dispersion. There is also a correlation related to the overall symmetry or total spin of the considered system.\n\nThe word correlation energy has to be used with caution. First it is usually defined as the energy difference of a correlated method relative to the Hartree–Fock energy. But this is not the full correlation energy because some correlation is already included in HF. Secondly the correlation energy is highly dependent on the basis set used. The \"exact\" energy is the energy with full correlation and full basis set.\n\nElectron correlation is sometimes divided into dynamical and non-dynamical (static) correlation. Dynamical correlation is the correlation of the movement of electrons and is described under electron correlation dynamics and also with the configuration interaction (CI) method. Static correlation is important for molecules where the ground state is well described only with more than one (nearly-)degenerate determinant. In this case the Hartree–Fock wavefunction (only one determinant) is qualitatively wrong. The multi-configurational self-consistent field (MCSCF) method takes account of this static correlation, but not dynamical correlation.\n\nIf one wants to calculate excitation energies (energy differences between the ground and excited states) one has to be careful that both states are equally balanced (e.g., Multireference configuration interaction).\n\nIn simple terms the molecular orbitals of the Hartree–Fock method are optimized by evaluating the energy of an electron in each molecular orbital moving in the mean field of all other electrons, rather than including the instantaneous repulsion between electrons.\n\nTo account for electron correlation there are many post-Hartree–Fock methods, including:\n\nOne of the most important methods for correcting for the missing correlation is the configuration interaction (CI) method. Starting with the Hartree–Fock wavefunction as the ground determinant, one takes a linear combination of the ground and excited determinants formula_1 as the correlated wavefunction and optimizes the weighting factors formula_2 according to the Variational Principle. When taking all possible excited determinants one speaks of Full-CI. In a Full-CI wavefunction all electrons are fully correlated. For non-small molecules Full-CI is much too computationally expensive. One truncates the CI expansion and gets well-correlated wavefunctions and well-correlated energies according to the level of truncation.\n\nPerturbation theory gives correlated energies, but no new wavefunctions. PT is not variational. This means the calculated energy is not an upper bound for the exact energy. It is possible to partition Møller–Plesset perturbation theory energies via Interacting Quantum Atoms (IQA) energy partitioning (although most commonly the correlation energy is not partitioned). This is an extension to the theory of Atoms in Molecules. IQA energy partitioning enables one to look in detail at the correlation energy contributions from individual atoms and atomic interactions.\nIQA correlation energy partitioning has also been shown to be possible with coupled cluster methods.\n\n\nThere are also combinations possible. E.g. one can have some nearly degenerate determinants for the multi-configurational self-consistent field method to account for static correlation and/or some truncated CI method for the biggest part of dynamical correlation and/or on top some perturbational ansatz for small perturbing (unimportant) determinants. Examples for those combinations are CASPT2 and SORCI.\n\nIn condensed matter physics, electrons are typically described with reference to a periodic lattice of atomic nuclei. Non-interacting electrons are therefore typically described by Bloch waves, which correspond to the delocalized, symmetry adapted molecular orbitals used in molecules (while Wannier functions correspond to localized molecular orbitals). A number of important theoretical approximations have been proposed to explain electron correlations in these crystalline systems.\n\nThe Fermi liquid model of correlated electrons in metals is able to explain the temperature dependence of resistivity by electron-electron interactions. It also forms the basis for the BCS theory of superconductivity, which is the result of phonon-mediated electron-electron interactions.\n\nSystems that escape a Fermi liquid description are said to be strongly-correlated. In them, interactions plays such an important role that qualitatively new phenomena emerge. This is the case, for example, when the electrons are close to a metal-insulator transition. The Hubbard model is based on the tight-binding approximation, and can explain conductor-insulator transitions in Mott insulators such as transition metal oxides by the presence of repulsive Coulombic interactions between electrons. Its one-dimensional version is considered an archetype of the strong-correlations problem and displays many dramatic manifestations such as quasi-particle fractionalization. However, there is no exact solution of the Hubbard model in more than one dimension.\n\nThe RKKY interaction can explain electron spin correlations between unpaired inner shell electrons in different atoms in a conducting crystal by a second-order interaction that is mediated by conduction electrons.\n\nThe Tomonaga–Luttinger liquid model approximates second order electron-electron interactions as bosonic interactions.\n\nFor two independent electrons \"a\" and \"b\",\n\nwhere represents the joint electronic density, or the probability density of finding electron \"a\" at and electron \"b\" at . Within this notation, represents the probability of finding the two electrons in their respective volume elements and .\n\nIf these two electrons are correlated, then the probability of finding electron \"a\" at a certain position in space depends on the position of electron \"b\", and vice versa. In other words, the product of their independent density functions does not adequately describe the real situation. At small distances, the uncorrelated pair density is too large; at large distances, the uncorrelated pair density is too small (i.e. the electrons tend to \"avoid each other\").\n\n"}

It is believed, though not proven, that they are universal, i.e. they do not depend on the details of the physical system, but only on some of its general features. For instance, for ferromagnetic systems, the critical exponents depend only on:\n\nThese properties of critical exponents are supported by experimental data. Analytical results can be theoretically achieved in mean field theory in high dimensions or when exact solutions are known such as the two-dimensional Ising model. The theoretical treatment in generic dimensions requires the renormalization group approach or the conformal bootstrap techniques.\nPhase transitions and critical exponents appear in many physical systems such as water at the liquid-vapor transition, in magnetic systems, in superconductivity, in percolation and in turbulent fluids.\nThe critical dimension above which mean field exponents are valid varies with the systems and can even be infinite. It is 4 for the liquid-vapor transition, 6 for percolation and probably infinite for turbulence.\nMean field critical exponents are also valid for random graphs, such as Erdős–Rényi graphs, which can be regarded as infinite dimensional systems.\n\nThe control parameter that drives phase transitions is often temperature but can also be other macroscopic variables like pressure or an external magnetic field. For simplicity, the following discussion works in terms of temperature; the translation to another control parameter is straightforward. The temperature at which the transition occurs is called the critical temperature . We want to describe the behavior of a physical quantity in terms of a power law around the critical temperature; we introduce the reduced temperature\n\nwhich is zero at the phase transition, and define the critical exponent formula_2:\n\nThis results in the power law we were looking for:\n\nIt is important to remember that this represents the asymptotic behavior of the function as .\n\nMore generally one might expect\n\nLet us assume that the system has two different phases characterized by an order parameter , which vanishes at and above .\n\nConsider the disordered phase (), ordered phase () and critical temperature () phases separately. Following the standard convention, the critical exponents related to the ordered phase are primed. It is also another standard convention to use superscript/subscript + (−) for the disordered (ordered) state. In general spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs in the ordered phase.\nThe following entries are evaluated at (except for the entry)\n\nThe critical exponents can be derived from the specific free energy as a function of the source and temperature. The correlation length can be derived from the functional .\n\nThese relations are accurate close to the critical point in two- and three-dimensional systems. In four dimensions, however, the power laws are modified by logarithmic factors. These do not appear in dimensions arbitrarily close to but not exactly four, which can be used as a way around this problem.\n\nThe classical Landau theory (also known as mean field theory) values of the critical exponents for a scalar field (of which the Ising model is the prototypical example) are given by\n\nIf we add derivative terms turning it into a mean field Ginzburg–Landau theory, we get\n\nOne of the major discoveries in the study of critical phenomena is that mean field theory of critical points is only correct when the space dimension of the system is higher than a certain dimension called the upper critical dimension which excludes the physical dimensions 1, 2 or 3 in most cases. The problem with mean field theory is that the critical exponents do not depend on the space dimension. This leads to a quantitative discrepancy below the critical dimensions, where the true critical exponents differ from the mean field values. It can even lead to a qualitative discrepancy at low space dimension, where a critical point in fact can no longer exist, even though mean field theory still predicts there is one. This is the case for the Ising model in dimension 1 where there is no phase transition. The space dimension where mean field theory becomes qualitatively incorrect is called the lower critical dimension.\n\nThe most accurately measured value of is −0.0127(3) for the phase transition of superfluid helium (the so-called lambda transition). The value was measured on a space shuttle to minimize pressure differences in the sample. This value is in a significant disagreement with the most precise theoretical determinations coming from high temperature expansion techniques, Monte Carlo methods and the conformal bootstrap.\n\nCritical exponents can be evaluated via Monte Carlo simulations of lattice models. The accuracy of this first principle method depends on the available computational resources, which determine the ability to go to the infinite volume limit and to reduce statistical errors. Other techniques rely on theoretical understanding of critical fluctuations. The most widely applicable technique is the renormalization group. The conformal bootstrap is a more recently developed technique, which has achieved unsurpassed accuracy for the Ising critical exponents.\n\nIn light of the critical scalings, we can reexpress all thermodynamic quantities in terms of dimensionless quantities. Close enough to the critical point, everything can be reexpressed in terms of certain ratios of the powers of the reduced quantities. These are the scaling functions.\n\nThe origin of scaling functions can be seen from the renormalization group. The critical point is an infrared fixed point. In a sufficiently small neighborhood of the critical point, we may linearize the action of the renormalization group. This basically means that rescaling the system by a factor of will be equivalent to rescaling operators and source fields by a factor of for some . So, we may reparameterize all quantities in terms of rescaled scale independent quantities.\n\nIt was believed for a long time that the critical exponents were the same above and below the critical temperature, e.g. or . It has now been shown that this is not necessarily true: When a continuous symmetry is explicitly broken down to a discrete symmetry by irrelevant (in the renormalization group sense) anisotropies, then the exponents and are not identical.\n\nCritical exponents are denoted by Greek letters. They fall into universality classes and obey the scaling relations\n\nThese equations imply that there are only two independent exponents, e.g., and . All this follows from the theory of the renormalization group.\n\nThere are some anisotropic systems where the correlation length is direction dependent. For percolation see Dayan et al.\n\nDirected percolation can be also regarded as anisotropic percolation. In this case the critical exponents are different and the upper critical dimension is 5.\n\nMore complex behavior may occur at multicritical points, at the border or on intersections of critical manifolds. They can be reached by tuning the value of two or more parameters, such as temperature and pressure.\n\nThe above examples exclusively refer to the static properties of a critical system. However dynamic properties of the system may become critical, too. Especially, the characteristic time, , of a system diverges as , with a \"dynamical exponent\" . Moreover, the large \"static universality classes\" of equivalent models with identical static critical exponents decompose into smaller \"dynamical universality classes\", if one demands that also the dynamical exponents are identical.\n\nThe critical exponents can be computed from conformal field theory.\n\nSee also anomalous scaling dimension.\n\nCritical exponents also exist for transport quantities like viscosity and heat conductivity. A recent study suggests that critical exponents of percolation play an important role in city traffic.\n\nCritical exponents also exist for self organized criticality for dissipative systems.\n\nPhase transitions and critical exponents appear also in percolation processes where the concentration of occupied sites or links play the role of temperature. See percolation critical exponents. For percolation the critical exponents are different from Ising. For example, in the mean field formula_9 for percolation compared to formula_10 for Ising.\nIn network theory, the strength of interactions between communities has been found to behave analogous to an external field in magnets near the phase transition or as ghost field in percolation.\n\n\n"}

While the park itself is located in Belgrade's municipality of Vračar, majority of what is today considered the neighborhood of Karađorđev Park is since 1957 located in the municipality of Savski Venac (though historically still within the old, much larger neighborhood of Vračar).\n\nIn 1979 Karađorđev Park was added to Historic Landmarks of Great Importance list, and it is protected by Republic of Serbia.\n\nKarađorđev Park is located on the southern slope of the Vračar hill, beginning at the Vračar plateau and the National Library of Serbia and ending at the highway interchange of Autokomanda. It is elongated in the north to south direction, bordered by the Boulevard of the Liberation on the west and the \"Nebojšina\" street on the east.\n\nToday, Karađorđev Park in the term of neighborhood covers larger area than the park itself. It is bordered by the neighborhoods of Vračar on the north, Neimar on the east and Autokomanda on the south, but the term spread on the area west and northwest of the park (former sections of Zapadni Vračar and Englezovac/Savinac, respectively), so basically all the area along the Boulevard of Liberation from Autokomanda to the Slavija square is today called Karađorđev Park. Across the northernmost top of the park to the west is another park, Park Milutin Milanković.\n\nIt is one of the busiest parts of Belgrade with very dense traffic as the Boulevard of Liberation is one of the major routes to downtown Belgrade. Area is mostly non-residential, with public buildings (the Faculty of the veterinarian medicine of the University of Belgrade, many clinics of the Belgrade Clinical Center, Children University Hospital, Belgrade Meteorological Station, etc.).\n\nThe predecessor to the modern park was a camp set by the Serbian army in 1806 during the siege of Belgrade in the First Serbian Uprising. After the Serbs secured Belgrade, killed soldiers were buried at this place and the place was arranged as the Insurgents Cemetery in 1848, when the Monument to the Liberators of Belgrade was also erected. Out of the 50 original tombstones, 12 still survives. As the ruling prince of Serbia at that time was Aleksandar Karađorđević, who was also the patron of the monument, the park which soon developed around the monument was named after his father, leader of the First Serbian Uprising and the founder of the Karađorđević royal family, Karađorđe.\n\nOne of the first avenues in Belgrade was planted along the Kragujevac Road (modern Liberation Boulevard), in 1848, from which the park developed in time. The planted seedlings were of chestnut trees, and the chestnut alley descending from the original one still survives in the park. Originally outside the urban core of Belgrade, park was much enlarged in 1903-04, when it got, more or less, its present borders and a hedge which encircled it. After the World War I many additional monuments were erected in the park.\n\nNeglected for a long time, Karađorđev Park went through massive reconstruction and beautification in the early 2000s which completely rejuvenated the park, including new benches, children playgrounds and candelabra. The idea at the time was to turn it into the first English type park in Belgrade, with added wall around the park, gates with porters and working hours, but after the failed bids for the job, the idea is put on hold for the time being.\n\nThere is a small, pavilion-type house in the central part of the park. There were also two swimming pools in front of it, built during the Interbellum. After World War II, in the 1950s, the venue was adapted into the children's cultural center. In time, the venue was abandoned and the pools were covered with earth and the flowers were planted. There was another, even smaller, green pavilion, at the plateau behind the house. It was used for selling food and beverages, but was demolished later. In September 2019 it was announced that the house will be adapted into the \"Momo Kapor Endowment\".\n\nMonuments in the park include:\n\n\n\n \n"}

They are mostly confined to the Elbe and Danube basins, in modern-day Germany, Austria, Czech Republic, Slovakia, as well as the adjacent parts of Hungary and Poland, in a stretch of Central European land some 800 km (500 mi) across.\nThey date to the first half of the 5th millennium BC; they are associated with the late Linear Pottery culture and its local successors, the Stroke-ornamented ware (Middle Danubian) and Lengyel (Moravian Painted Ware) cultures. The best known and oldest of these Circular Enclosures is the Goseck circle, constructed c. 4900 BC.\n\nOnly a few examples approximate a circular form; the majority are only very approximately circular or elliptic. One example at Meisternthal is an exact ellipse with identifiable focal points.\nThe distribution of these structures seems to suggest a spread from the middle Danube (southern Slovakia and western Hungary) towards the west (Lower Austria, Lower Bavaria) along the Danube and to the northwest (Moravia, Bohemia, Saxony-Anhalt) following the Elbe. \nThey precede the comparable circular earthwork or timber enclosures known from Great Britain and Ireland, constructed much later during c. 3000 to 1000 BC (late Neolithic to Bronze Age).\nBut, by contrast to the long lifetime of the \"Megalithic\" culture, the time window during which the \nneolithic \"Roundels\" were in use is surprisingly narrow, lasting only for about 200–300 years (roughly 49th to 47th centuries BC).\n\nThe earliest roundel to be described was the one at Krpy (Kropáčova Vrutice), Bohemia, by 1886, but it was only with systematic aerial survey in the 1980s and the 1990s that their ubiquity in the region became apparent. \nThree types have been distinguished:\n\nThe structures are mostly interpreted as having served a cultic purpose.\nMost of them are aligned and seem to have served the function of a calendar (\"Kalenderbau\"), in the context of archaeoastronomy sometimes dubbed \"observatory\", with openings aligned with the points sunrise and/or sunset at the solstices. This is the case with the \"gates\" or openings of the roundels of Quenstedt, Goseck and Quedlinburg. \nThe observational determination of the time of solstice would not have served a practical (agricultural) purpose, but could have been used to maintain a lunisolar calendar (i.e. knowledge of the date of solstice allows an accurate handling of intercalary months).\n\nKnown Circular Enclosures:\n\n\n"}

The church building is on Crown Lane part of the Morden one-way system.\n\n\"In 1880s Morden was a place of cornfields and cattle, a country district with three little far sundered groups of houses. Each group of houses had a public house at its centre. Those public houses can still be found - \"The Plough\", \"The George\" and \"The Crown\". On a Sunday evening in 1885 a little company of \"Lovers of Jesus\" gathered in one of the shops in what is now London Road, to hold a simple evangelistic service. They met, and sang, and prayed and read the Scriptures. Near Morden one of the iron building firms had a few sample buildings on show. When they abandoned the pitch, they offered an iron chapel for sale and Queens Road Church Wimbledon, London offered to buy it for Morden\".\nIn 1915 the membership was only 16. However the extension of the Northern line and development of Merton Park, Morden and St. Helier Estate resulted in the numbers of church members rising to 84. 1929 saw the fellowship moving across the road from the 'Tin Chapel' to the \"new\" School Hall. This building still remains, and is now used for sports, playgroup, luncheon club and other activities. From small beginnings above a shop in 1885, who could have foreseen that exactly 50 years later, a new church would be needed (in addition to the School Hall) to accommodate the rapidly growing fellowship. So on 9 March 1935, the new church was formally opened.\n\nAs Morden ceased to be a quiet rural parish, and become part of London's suburbia, so the Church grew, developed and changed, Morden centre changed during this period. As the church continued to grow the old buildings proved inadequate to meet those needs. In 1990 a very substantial building scheme was undertaken to provide the current improved facilities, and including an enclosed concourse new offices and a sound-proofed cresh with a view into the main church. The Church now stands with the main entrance facing up Crown Lane part of the Morden one way system.\n\nThe Current Minister is Reverend Elaine Youngman, there is also a co-minister Darren Powell and a youth worked Hannah Rouse.

{"id": "2029761", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2029761", "title": "Romanization of Bulgarian", "text": "Romanization of Bulgarian\n\nRomanization of Bulgarian is the practice of transliteration of text in Bulgarian from its conventional Cyrillic orthography into the Latin alphabet. Romanization can be used for various purposes, such as rendering of proper names and place names in foreign-language contexts, or for informal writing of Bulgarian in environments where Cyrillic is not easily available. Official use of romanization by Bulgarian authorities is found, for instance, in identity documents and in road signage. Several different standards of transliteration exist, one of which was chosen and made mandatory for common use by the Bulgarian authorities in a law of 2009.\n\nThe various romanization systems differ with respect to 12 out of the 30 letters of the modern Bulgarian alphabet. The remaining 18 have constant mappings in all romanization schemes:\nа→a, б→b, в→v, г→g, д→d, е→e, з→z, и→i, к→k, л→l, м→m, н→n, о→o, п→p, р→r, с→s, т→t, ф→f. Differences exist with respect to the following:\n\nThree different systems have been adopted officially by Bulgarian authorities at overlapping times.\n\nAn older system in the tradition of common Slavic scientific transliteration was adopted by the Council of Orthography and Transcription of Geographical Names in Sofia in 1972 and subsequently by the UN in 1977. It is identical to that codified in the ISO norm . This system uses diacritic letters (<č, š, ž>) as well as <j> and <c>. It was adopted in 1973 as the Bulgarian state standard BDS 1596:1973 which, although still valid formally is no longer used in practice, having been superseded by the 2009 Transliteration Law.\n\nThe second system was a French-oriented transliteration of personal and place names in the documents issued by the Bulgarian Ministry of Interior for travel abroad, used until 1999.\n\nSystems based on a radically different principle, which avoids diacritics and is optimized for compatibility with English sound-letter correspondences, have come into official use in Bulgaria since the mid-1990s. These systems characteristically use <ch, sh, zh> rather than <č, š, ž>, and <y> rather than <j>.\n\nOne such system was proposed in Danchev et al.'s \"English Dictionary of Bulgarian Names\" of 1989.\n\nA similar system (differing from the former in the treatment of letters \"ъ, у,\" and digraphs \"ай, ей, ой and уй\"), called the \"Streamlined System\" by Ivanov (2003) and Gaidarska (1998), was adopted in 1995 for use in Bulgarian-related place names in Antarctica by the Antarctic Place-names Commission of Bulgaria. Another system along similar lines, differing from the Antarctic one only in the treatment of \"ц\" (<ts> vs. <c>), was adopted by the Bulgarian authorities for use in identity documents in 1999; after an amendment in 2000, the official Bulgarian system became identical with that of the Antarctica Commission.\n\nThe new official Bulgarian system does not allow for unambiguous mapping back into Cyrillic, since unlike most other systems it does not distinguish between \"ъ\" and \"а\" (both rendered as \"a\"). It also does not distinguish between the digraph values of <zh=ж>, <sh=ш> and the value of the same Roman strings in rendering accidental clusters of separate Cyrillic letters <zh=зх> and <sh=сх>, as they occur in words like изход (\"izhod\") or схема (\"shema\").\n\nA modification of the system using a diacritic was proposed in the authoritative New Orthographic Dictionary of the Bulgarian Language in 2002, with ъ rendered as ă rather than a. However, that proposal was not adopted for official usage, and failed to become established in popular practice.\n\nAn exception to the rules was introduced by the Bulgarian authorities in 2006, mandating the transliteration of word-final -ия as \"-ia\" rather than \"-iya\" in given names and geographical names (such as \"Ilia\", \"Maria\" and \"Bulgaria\", \"Sofia\", \"Trakia\" etc.). In 2009, a law passed by the Bulgarian parliament made this system mandatory for all official use and some types of private publications, expanding also the application of the \"ia\"-exception rule to all -ия in word-final position.\n\nThe Streamlined system was adopted by UN in 2012, and by BGN and PCGN in 2013.\n\nAccording to Arenstein, “The international roots of the Bulgarian romanization system strike at the core of one of romanization’s most perplexing paradoxes: an impulse to redefine and distinguish national identity while also ensuring the accessibility of that identity to outside groups. In other words, instilling nationalism with a sense of internationalism.” \n\nA variant of the Streamlined System allowing for unambiguous mapping back into Cyrillic was proposed by Ivanov, Skordev and Dobrev in 2010 to be used in cases when the retrieval of the original Cyrillic forms is essential. For that purpose, certain Cyrillic letters and combinations of letters are transliterated as follows: ъ→`a, ь→`y, зх→z|h, йа→y|a, йу→y|u, сх→s|h, тс→t|s, тш→t|sh, тщ→t|sht, шт→sh|t, шц→sh|ts, ия (in final position, if the \"ia\"-exception rule is applied) →i|a. The standard transliteration form of a given text is obtained from its unambiguously reversible one by simply removing the additional symbols ` and |.\n\nSystems along similar lines to the new official Bulgarian system, though with differences regarding the letters х, ъ, ь, ю and я, have also been in use in the ALA-LC Romanization scheme of the Library of Congress, the now defunct pre-2013 BGN/PCGN romanization of the United States and British governments, and the 1917 system of the British Academy.\n\nThe ISO 9 standard, in its 1995 version, has introduced another romanization system that works with a consistent one-to-one reversible mapping, resorting to rare diacritic combinations such as <â,û,ŝ>.\n\nThe GOST 7.79-2000 \"Rules of transliteration of Cyrillic script by Latin alphabet\" contains an unambiguous and reversible ASCII-compatible transliteration system for Bulgarian: й→j, х→x, ц→c or cz, ч→ch, ш→sh, щ→sth, ъ→a`, ь→`, ю→yu, я→ya.\n\nThe archaic Cyrillic letters ѣ and ѫ, which were part of the pre-1945 orthography of Bulgarian, are variously transcribed as ⟨i͡e, e⟩, as ⟨ya, ě⟩, and as ⟨u̐, ŭǎ⟩, respectively, in the ALA/LC, BGN/PCGN and ISO 9 standards.\n\nSome people and companies prefer to use or retain personalized spellings of their own names in Latin. Examples are politicians Ivan Stancioff (instead of \"Stanchov\") and Simeon Djankov (instead of \"Dyankov\"), and beer brand Kamenitza (instead of Kamenitsa). The freedom of using different Roman transliterations of personal names is guaranteed by Article 2(2) of the governmental 2010 Regulation for Issuing of Bulgarian Personal Documents.\n\nSometimes, especially in e-mail or text messaging, the Cyrillic alphabet is not available and people are forced to write in Roman script. This often does not follow the official or any other of the standards listed above, but rather is an idiosyncratic Bulgarian form of text speak. While most letters are straightforward, several can take different forms. The letter variants listed below are often used interchangeably with some or all of the above standards, often in the same message.\n\nThere is no set rule, and people often vary the combinations within a single message, so that \"ъ\" may be presented as \"u\", \"a\" or \"y\" in three adjacent words, and \"щ\" can be \"sht\" in one word, and \"6t\" in the next, and \"ю\" may be written differently in the same word. Conversely, \"j\" could be used to represent \"й\", \"ж\" and even \"дж\" in adjacent words, while \"y\" can be used for \"ъ\" in one word and for \"й\" in the next.\n\nThis unofficial email/SMS language is often referred to as \"shlyokavitsa\" The use of Latinised Bulgarian, while ubiquitous in personal communication, is frowned upon in certain internet contexts, and many websites' comment sections and internet forums have rules stating that posts in Roman script will be deleted.\n\n\n\n"}

However, 98% of people modified their food intake and 94% of participants increased their exercise. After losing weight, almost all of the registry members ate breakfast and weighed themselves regularly, most commonly once per week. About 45% of registry participants lost weight on their own, while 55% of participants obtained help from some type of program. Registry participants watch less television than the average American, which leaves time to engage in about 60 minutes per day of moderate intensity physical activity, or the equivalent.\n\nResearch findings from the National Weight Control Registry have been featured in many national newspapers, magazines, and television broadcasts, including: USA Today, Oprah magazine, The Washington Post, and Good Morning America.

Marie area, and can be heard northward to Montreal River, Ontario and southward to Mackinaw City, Michigan and at times to Gaylord, Michigan.\n\nThe station was launched on May 13, 1965 as CKCY-FM by Algonquin Broadcasting, the owners of the city's CKCY (AM). In 1976, both stations were acquired by Huron Broadcasting, who also launched CKCY-TV in 1978. Huron subsequently sold the radio stations to a new business consortium, CKCY 920 Ltd., in 1985. The station adopted its current callsign that year, as well as its longtime \"Q104\" branding. CKCY 920 Ltd. was subsequently acquired by Mid-Canada Radio in 1988, and Mid-Canada in turn was acquired by the Pelmorex Radio Network in 1990.\n\nDue to the economic circumstances of the Sault Ste.

Telemedia subsequently acquired the Pelmorex group in 1999.\n\nTelemedia was acquired by Standard Broadcasting in 2002, with Standard selling both CJQM and CHAS to their current owner, Rogers Media, the same year. Rogers Media would drop CJQM's longtime \"Q104\" branding on June 28, 2013, rebranding the station as \"Country 104.3,\" part of an effort by Rogers to apply a unified \"Country\" branding to its roster of country music-formatted stations.\n\nThe \"Country 104.3\" playlist emphasizes current country songs and artists, with a few classic country titles sprinkled in (the station has its own classic country show on Sunday mornings). The schedule also features a live local morning show hosted by Jeff McNiece, as well as syndicated weekly shows including \"American Country Countdown\" and \"Canadian Country Spotlight\". CJQM was formerly radio home to the Ontario Hockey League's Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds, a relationship that ended after the 2008-2009 season; the Greyhounds are currently heard on Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan-based WSUE.\n\n"}

He also discovered the lek breeding system of the kakapo.\n\nWhen Don Merton began his work as a conservationist, Kakapo were believed to be extinct, but about 20 years into his career a small population of Kakapo were found on a semi-remote national park in mainland New Zealand. However, it was several months before they finally found a female, and soon after they found the first female they discovered a surprise, well-fed chick a few weeks old. Merton and his crew initially wanted to relocate all of the rediscovered Kakapo they found to off shore Codfish Island, but the New Zealand Department of Conservation only gave permission to relocate 20. Despite the limited relocation, the Kakapo population has steadily recovered (as of 2019 there are 147 mature adult Kakapo, and the 2019 season produced 181 eggs and 34 chicks so far, though not all are likely to survive due to problems with in breeding- lack of genetic diversity). But thanks to technological advances in GENOME Mapping tools like \"CRISPR\", scientists have successfully mapped all of the 147 Kakapos' genomes, and in the near future it may be possible to edit the Genomes of an egg to allow for a higher survival rate among newly hatched chicks.\n\nUntil his retirement in April 2005, Merton was a senior member of the New Zealand Department of Conservation’s Threatened Species Section, within the Research, Development & Improvement Division, Terrestrial Conservation Unit, and of the Kakapo Management Group. He has had a long involvement in wildlife conservation, specialized in the management of endangered species since he completed a traineeship with the New Zealand Wildlife Service (NZWS) in 1960.\n\nMerton was born in Devonport, Auckland in February 1939 and with his family moved to Gisborne later that year when his father, Glaisher (Major) Merton was appointed the first New Zealand Automobile Association representative in the Poverty Bay region. Initially, the family settled at Wainui Beach near Gisborne, but in 1945 moved to a farmette in Mangapapa Road, Gisborne.\n\nTogether with his two older brothers, Merton had early success fostering an orphaned wild goldfinch nestling to their grandmother's canary. This early success proved crucial 35 years later in inspiring a cross-fostering programme to save the black robin, which at that time numbered five individuals including just one productive pair, and was the most endangered species in the world.\n\nMerton attended schools at Kaiti, Mangapapa, Gisborne Intermediate and Gisborne High School. On leaving school he secured a traineeship with the fledgeling New Zealand Wildlife Service. In 1987 the Wildlife Service merged with other Government conservation agencies to form the Department of Conservation. In the early 1960s, Merton became one of only two field officers working nationally on threatened species, roles now filled by more than 80 staff.\n\nTogether with NZWS colleagues and volunteers, his contributions include:\n\n\nIn New Zealand Merton is also known for his role in the rescue of the South Island saddleback when in the early 1960s rats \"Rattus rattus\" invaded its final refuge – Big South Cape Island; for facilitating recovery in the North Island saddleback, confined in the early 1960s to a single island (Taranga/Hen Island); for his role, since 1974, in developing the rescue strategy and techniques, and for his role in the rescue and recovery programme for the giant, flightless, nocturnal kakapo parrot; and for devising the rescue strategy and leading the successful rescue and recovery of the Chatham Islands black robin when in the late 1970s its numbers fell to just seven individuals – including only one effective breeding pair. The black robin now numbers ~250 individuals on two islands.\n\nMerton retired from the Department of Conservation in 2005. He lived in Tauranga where he remained active in conservation issues, and died there from pancreatic cancer on 10 April 2011.\n\nMerton was awarded a Churchill Fellowship in 1973 to study management of endangered species in the US and Europe. He was the international chairperson of IUCN/Birdlife International's Parrot Specialist Group from 1983 to 1986. In the 1989 Queen's Birthday Honours he was awarded the Queen's Service Medal for public services; in the following year he received the Royal Society of New Zealand’s Fleming Award for Environmental Achievement; in 1992 the honorary degree of Doctor of Science was conferred on him by Massey University for his contribution to science; in 1994 the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (UK) awarded him its medal for his \"international contribution to species survival\" and in 1998 the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) elected him to its Global 500 Roll of Honour for his \"outstanding contributions to the protection and improvement of the environment.\" Merton was named one of \"100 Great New Zealanders of the 20th Century\" in the 60th anniversary issue of the New Zealand Listener; in 2001 the New Zealand Government presented him with a certificate in commemoration of the United Nations International Year of the Volunteer 2001, for his \"valued contribution toward assisting developing countries to reduce poverty and achieve sustainable development\"; in 2004, BirdLife International awarded him its Conservation Achievement Award for achievements during his 48-year career in the rescue and recovery of endangered birds within New Zealand and elsewhere; on his retirement from the NZ Department of Conservation in April 2005 the Department granted him Honorary Technical Associate status – the first such recipient; in 2010 the Royal Forest & Bird Protection Society of NZ presented him with its \"Old Blue Award\" in recognition of his extraordinary and sustained contributions to conservation in NZ and worldwide\"; and in 2011 he became a \"Fellow of the Ornithological Society of NZ in recognition of his \"lifetime contributions to ornithology and to the work of the Society\".\n\nAs well as being the recipient of numerous awards the \"Don Merton Conservation Pioneer Award\" is named after him.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2029811", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2029811", "title": "Navajo Nation Zoological and Botanical Park", "text": "Navajo Nation Zoological and Botanical Park\n\nThe Navajo Nation Zoological and Botanical Park is located in Window Rock, Arizona, the capital of the Navajo Nation. It is the only tribally owned zoological park in the United States and is notable among zoological facilities in that it labels its exhibits in the Native American Indian language of Navajo. Having been operated by the Navajo Nation Parks & Recreation Department since its inception in the early 1960s, it became part of the Navajo Nation Department of Fish and Wildlife in September 2006.\n\nWhile its facilities have the unique mission of preserving and caring for the fauna and flora significant to Navajo culture, its existence has also sparked controversy among the more traditionalist elements in Navajo society.\n\nThe zoo's first specimen was a bear that had been left behind after the 1963 Navajo Nation Fair by a state organization, and the animal was named \"Yogi the Bear,\" after the then-popular cartoon character. Since then, the exhibit has grown to about 50 different species on display, almost all of them native to the area. In 1976, the zoo, then named \"Navajo Tribal Zoo,\" relocated to its current home and became part of the Navajo Tribal Parks & Recreation system. In September 2006, it was reorganized to be administered by the Navajo Nation Department of Fish and Wildlife.\nThe facility's current director and curator is David Mikesic, a biologist that served the Navajo Nation as an endangered species field zoologist from 1994 to 2010 under the Navajo Natural Heritage Program. His predecessor, Matthew Holdgate, was the first director (2007 to 2010) under the Department of Fish and Wildlife's leadership of the facility. He was responsible for setting the Navajo Zoo on a course of transformation and modernization.\n\nThe zoo currently employs five dedicated full-time animal care staff; this includes four zookeepers and one supervisory zookeeper. These staff also provide the construction/renovation and behavioral enrichment activities. It is primarily funded by the Navajo Nation Government with an annual budget of under US$500,000, but also solicits for donations from project sponsorship, animal adoption, and donations. Admission to the facility is free.\n\nThe zoo operates on an area spanning and is located in the vicinity of the Navajo Nation Museum in Window Rock (Tségháhoodzání). It is home to about 100 animals, representing over 50 species and sees an estimated 45,000 visitors each year.\n\nThe zoo dubs itself \"a Sanctuary for Nature and the Spirit\", and according to its mission statement, it aims to conserve \"native plants and animals, including rare, sensitive and endangered species\" with an emphasis on fauna and flora that is important and significant to Navajo culture and traditions. In this spirit, it houses primarily injured and orphaned animals native to Navajoland and implements cultural and educational programs in cooperation with schools and similar facilities in the area. Furthermore, it provides care for injured and orphaned animals found in the wild. The zoo also fosters the use of plants and animals for ceremonial purposes in accordance with Navajo tradition, and regularly accepts appointments for offerings being made and ceremonies held within its facilities.\n\nIts wild creatures include black bear, bobcat, Mexican wolves, mule deer, elk, Gila monsters, coyotes, cougars, and red foxes, as well as wild turkey, cranes, golden eagle, red-tailed hawk, and great horned owls. This zoo has exhibited the federally endangered Mexican wolf since the early 1980s. More recently, the zoo re-homed their three exhibit snakes in 2015 for cultural concerns, and became one of 20+ facilities across the U.S. to house the federally endangered black-footed ferret. In keeping with Navajo tradition, none of the zoo's birds were captured for the purpose of being exhibited, but were rather rescued after sustaining injuries from vehicles or electrical lines and are thus unable to fly; the majority of the other specimens are also non-releasable and unable to survive in the wild due to being orphaned or having been confiscated as illegal pets from their former owners.\n\nStarting in 2008, the zoo's then 30-year-old Discovery Center was renovated and redesigned to bring it in line with modern zoo standards; apart from displaying the majority of the park's invertebrates, it also incorporates a display with traditional Navajo stories relating to the animals.\n\nThe major transformation of the Zoo continues in recent years; some of the notable improvements for exhibit animals include: incorporating behavioral enrichment practices into everyday activities, constructing permanent animal shades, enlargement of coyote and elk enclosures, incorporating wire mesh into exhibit renovations, construction of a quarantine and veterinary station, and constructing a large eagle aviary (details below). Major improvements for visitors include: more exhibit signage, a paved parking lot, concrete sidewalks, more seating around the zoo grounds, a covered stage for events, and installation of a 40-octagon pavilion for parties.\n\nAny animal in the zoo can be \"adopted\" for a price of US$150 annually to cover the cost of food and care; the adopting party will receive a certificate and has his or her name engraved on the plaque next to the exhibit in question. If the animal has never been adopted before, the sponsor will have the opportunity of giving the animal a name; in this process, various animals have been given names such as \"Hunter\" for the park's mountain lion, \"Boomer\" for the elk, and \"Thor\" for one the golden eagles.\n\nSince 2008, the zoo had lobbied for funding and a permit to build an eagle sanctuary in order to be able to distribute the animals' feathers to tribal members for ceremonial purposes in accordance with federal law. According to requirements under the federal Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, any remains of dead eagles are collected by the federal government and transported to a central repository in Colorado; members of Native American Indian nations then have to apply individually to receive parts, such as feathers, in a lengthy process with wait-times that can exceed several years. Since a tribal-operated eagle sanctuary constitutes an exception to the process, it is instrumental in strengthening Navajo cultural sovereignty. With support from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Navajo Nation was permitted in 2012 to release naturally-molted eagle feathers to enrolled member of the Navajo Nation. These feathers came from the four Golden Eagles already on exhibit at the zoo.\n\nThen in 2015, the Navajo Nation Zoo was successful in obtaining the necessary funding for a large Eagle Sanctuary; the bulk of the direct funding came from the Navajo Nation Council, Navajo Nation Department of Tourism, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Tribal Wildlife Grant Program). Another nine Navajo-Tribal and NGOs, contributed in-kind services or direct funding to make this project a reality. The Navajo Nation Golden Eagle Sanctuary officially opened on July 1, 2016 with 5 non-releasable Golden Eagles. In 2018, the sanctuary houses 10 Golden Eagles. The facility has a footprint of 80 feet (length) by 50 feet (width) with many perching areas, and is permitted to house up to 25 Golden Eagles. This facility continues to serve as: a permanent home for non-releasable eagles, an exhibit of Golden Eagles, a location for eagle conservation education, and a legal source of molted feathers for Navajos and other Native Americans.\n\nIn January 1999, outgoing Navajo Nation president Milton Bluehouse ordered the zoo closed after two women from Rock Ridge claimed to have been visited by the (traditional Navajo deities), who had given them a warning, saying that the Navajo people were not living according to tradition by keeping caged animals, specifically bears, snakes, and eagles, which are considered sacred.\n\nSubsequently, during his first days in office, Bluehouse's successor, Kelsey A. Begaye, received more complaints and letters protesting the zoo's closure than concerning any other political issue. After temporarily reversing Bluehouse's decision, Begaye then summoned a meeting with the Navajo Nation's Hataałii Advisory Council to discuss the situation; the group, however, refused to consider the matter while the animals were in hibernation and postponed any advice or decision until April of the following year. Options under consideration were releasing the animals into the wild, not accepting new animals and closing the zoo after the last one had died, or renaming the zoo to a term that would be considered more respectful to the animals.\n\nOpponents to the shut-down maintained that most of the animals were unable to survive in the wild and would perish, and that the zoo's facilities had become one of the last possibilities for future generations of Navajos to see the sacred creatures and thereby relate to traditional stories, due to the fact that most younger Navajos are more accustomed to dealing with domesticated livestock rather than untamed animals.\n\nOn March 12, Begaye announced his decision to keep the zoo open without expanding it and letting the remaining animals live out their lives on the zoo-grounds. According to Harry Walters, an anthropologist and former chairman of the Center for Diné Studies at Diné College in , the incident demonstrates a crucial difference between Navajo and Western culture in the way visions and supernatural experiences are handled: \"Rather than focus on the sightings to determine if who saw it was nuts or not – that's what a Westerner would do – we look at it as a message: 'Are we going the way we should? Walters said.\n\n"}
{"id": "2029825", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2029825", "title": "X-Men: The Last Stand", "text": "X-Men: The Last Stand\n\nX-Men: The Last Stand (also marketed as X3) is a 2006 superhero film based on the X-Men superhero team introduced in Marvel Comics. It is the sequel to 2003's \"X2\", as well as the third installment in the \"X-Men\" film series, and was directed by Brett Ratner and written by Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn. It features an ensemble cast including Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Ian McKellen, Famke Janssen, Anna Paquin, Kelsey Grammer, James Marsden, Rebecca Romijn, Shawn Ashmore, Aaron Stanford, Vinnie Jones and Patrick Stewart. The film's script is loosely based on two \"X-Men\" comic book story arcs: \"The Dark Phoenix Saga\" by writer Chris Claremont and artist John Byrne, and \"Gifted\" by writer Joss Whedon and artist John Cassaday, with a plot that revolves around a \"mutant cure\" that causes serious repercussions among mutants and humans, and on the resurrection of Jean Grey.\n\nBryan Singer, who had directed the two previous films, \"X-Men\" (2000) and \"X2\", decided to leave the sequel to work on \"Superman Returns\". \"X2\" composer John Ottman and \"X2\" writers Dan Harris and Michael Dougherty also left to work on \"Superman Returns\", as did James Marsden, who had very limited screen time in \"The Last Stand\" before his character was killed off due to his departure from the film. Singer had not even defined the storyline for a third film. Matthew Vaughn, who was initially hired as the new director, left due to personal and professional issues, and was replaced with Ratner. Filming took place from August 2005 to January 2006 with a budget of $210million, and was consequently the most expensive film made at the time of its release. It had extensive visual effects created by 11 different companies.\n\n\"X-Men: The Last Stand\" was released on May 26, 2006, by 20th Century Fox. It grossed approximately $459million worldwide, becoming the seventh-highest-grossing film of 2006; it was at the time the highest-grossing film in the series and currently the fourth-highest-grossing film of the franchise. Critical reception was mixed, with the acting, musical score and the action scenes receiving positive notice, and criticism directed at the screenplay, overuse of characters, style and lack of dynamics.\n\nTwenty years in the past, Professor Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr meet young Jean Grey at her parents' house to invite her to join their school, the X-Mansion. Ten years later, the industrialist father of Warren Worthington III discovers his son is a mutant as Warren tries to cut off his wings.\n\nIn the present, Worthington Labs announces it has developed an inoculation to suppress the X-gene that gives mutants their abilities and offer the \"cure\" to any mutant who wants it. The cure is created from the genome of a young mutant named Jimmy, who lives at the Worthington facility on Alcatraz Island. While some mutants are interested in the cure, including the X-Men's Rogue, many others are horrified by the announcement. Magneto re-establishes his Brotherhood of Mutants with those who oppose the cure, warning his followers that the cure will be forcefully used to exterminate the mutant race.\n\nWith help from Pyro, Magneto recruits Callisto and several other mutants. They attack the mobile prison holding Mystique to free her, also freeing Juggernaut and Multiple Man. Mystique, shielding Magneto from a cure dart, is hit by it and loses her mutant abilities. Magneto abandons her as a result.\n\nMeanwhile, Scott Summers, still distraught over the loss of his fiancée Jean Grey, drives to her resting location at Alkali Lake. Jean appears to Summers but, as the two kiss, Jean kills him. Sensing trouble, Xavier sends Logan and Storm to investigate. When they arrive, they find only telekinetically floating rocks, Summers' glasses, and an unconscious Jean.\n\nWhen Logan and Storm return to the X-Mansion, Xavier explains to Logan that when Jean sacrificed herself to save them, she also freed the \"Phoenix\", a dark and extremely powerful alternate personality which Xavier had telepathically repressed, aware of the Phoenix's godlike destructive potential. Logan is disgusted to learn of this psychic tampering with Jean's mind but, once she awakens, he discovers that she killed Summers and is not the Jean Grey he once knew. The Phoenix emerges, knocks out Logan, and escapes to her childhood home.\n\nMagneto learns of Jean's resurrection through Callisto, and the X-Men arrive at the Grey home at the same time as the Brotherhood. Magneto and Xavier go in, and both vie for Jean's loyalty until the Phoenix resurfaces. She destroys the house and disintegrates Xavier before Magneto and Logan can stop her. Jean leaves with Magneto. After interrogating Mystique, the FBI discover Magneto's base in the woods. However, the life forms in the camp are all decoy copies of Multiple Man. Magneto and the Brotherhood have gone to storm Alcatraz by using his magnetic manipulation powers to reroute the Golden Gate Bridge. The remaining X-Men confront the Brotherhood, despite being significantly outnumbered, and arrive just as the military troops who thus far have been neutralizing the attacking mutants are overwhelmed by the Brotherhood.\n\nDuring the fight, Kitty Pryde saves Jimmy from Juggernaut, who had been sent to kill him by Magneto. Logan has Colossus throw him at Magneto and distract him long enough for Hank McCoy to inject Magneto with the \"cure\" and thus nullify his powers. Army reinforcements arrive and shoot at Jean just as Logan had calmed her down. The Phoenix is awakened by the attack and disintegrates the troops in retaliation. The Phoenix then begins to destroy Alcatraz and anyone within range of her powers. Logan realizes that only he can stop the Phoenix due to his healing factor and adamantium skeleton. When Logan approaches her, Jean momentarily gains control and begs him to save her, and everyone else, by killing her. Logan fatally stabs Jean, killing the Phoenix, but mourns her death.\n\nSome time later, mutant rights are finally obtained and Xavier's school is still operating with Storm as headmistress. The President of the United States appoints McCoy as ambassador to the United Nations. Rogue reveals to Bobby Drake that she has taken the cure, much to his disappointment. Meanwhile, Magneto sits at a chessboard in San Francisco, seemingly human and weak. As Magneto gestures toward a metal chess piece, it moves slightly, suggesting the effects of the cure are temporary. Elsewhere, Moira MacTaggert checks on a comatose patient who greets her with Xavier's voice, leaving her startled.\n\n\nOther actors who portrayed mutants were: Meiling Melançon as Psylocke, a mutant with the ability to teleport herself through areas of shadow, although that depiction differs significantly from the comics; Omahyra Mota as Arclight, a mutant who has the ability to generate shock waves of concussive force; Ken Leung as Kid Omega, a mutant with the ability to eject spikes from his body, most notably his face (though the character resembles the comic books' character Quill and was later confirmed as such however, the official cast credits read \"Kid Omega\"); and Cameron Bright as Jimmy / Leech, a mutant who has the ability to neutralize the powers of nearby mutants.\n\nVarious characters were included at the suggestion of editor Mark Helfrich, who brought Marvel's \"X-Men Encyclopedia\" to director Brett Ratner, searching for mutants who could make appearance. Mark Helfrich portrays an unnamed mutant with ash-gray skin. These include Phat, a mutant that is a very large man who can slim down to fit in a smaller space (played by two actors, Via Saleaumua – \"large mode\" – and Richard Yee – \"small mode\"); Spike (played by Lance Gibson), a mutant who battles Wolverine in the forest by extruding bony spikes from his flesh – the character was added because the editing team felt that the original cut of the scene portrayed Logan as a cold-blooded killer, which could be changed if another mutant attacked Wolverine before he struck the Brotherhood and Glob Herman (played by Clayton Dean Watmough), a mutant with transparent skin.\n\nVarious other mutants make cameos at the X-Mansion; Shauna Kain and Kea Wong reprised their cameo roles as Siryn and Jubilee respectively, and three identical girls in the background in one scene are a reference to the Stepford Cuckoos. Olivia Williams portrays Moira MacTaggert. \"X-Men\" co-creator Stan Lee and writer Chris Claremont have cameos in the film's opening scene as the neighbors of young Jean Grey. The sergeant directing defensive preparations before the Brotherhood assaults Alcatraz Island is played by R. Lee Ermey. Lloyd Adams portrays the green-skinned mutant that climbs the guard tower on Alcatraz. Many fans believed this was Toad; however, the credits list him as lizard man and Brett Ratner confirmed it was Anole. Avalanche and Vanisher also appear; however, it is not known who portrayed them.\n\nBryan Singer, the director of the first two \"X-Men\" films, left the project in July 2004 in favor of developing \"Superman Returns\". Singer stated that he \"didn't fully have \"X-Men 3\" in my mind\" in contrast to a fully formed idea for a Superman film and interest in joining that franchise. By the time of his departure, Singer had only produced a partial story treatment with \"X2\" screenwriters Dan Harris and Michael Dougherty, who accompanied him to \"Superman Returns\". The treatment focused on Jean Grey's resurrection, which would also introduce the villainness Emma Frost, a role intended for Sigourney Weaver. Frost was an empath manipulating Jean's emotions in the treatment and, like the finished film, Magneto desires to control her. Overwhelmed by her powers, Jean kills herself, but Jean's spirit survives and becomes a god-like creature, which Dougherty compared to the star child in \"\".\n\nNew contracts for returning cast members were made, as the actors and actresses had signed for only two films. Hugh Jackman's contract included the approval of director, initially offering the position to Darren Aronofsky, with whom he had just finished filming on \"The Fountain\". Joss Whedon, whose comic book \"Gifted\" was integrated into the script's plot, turned down the offer because he was working on a \"Wonder Woman\" film. Rob Bowman and Alex Proyas were also rumored to be up for consideration, though Proyas personally turned it down, citing feuds with 20th Century Fox president Thomas Rothman while producing \"I, Robot\". Zack Snyder was also approached, but he was already committed to \"300\". Peter Berg was also considered to direct the film but he too turned down the job. In February 2005, with still no director hired, Fox announced a May 5, 2006, release date, with filming to start in July 2005 in Vancouver. One month later, the studio signed Matthew Vaughn to direct, and pushed the release date three weeks to May 26, Memorial Day weekend. Vaughn cast Kelsey Grammer as Beast, Dania Ramirez as Callisto, and Vinnie Jones as Juggernaut, but family issues led him to withdraw before filming began. Vaughn was also cautious of the tight deadlines imposed by Fox, stating that he \"didn't have the time to make the movie that I wanted to make\".\n\nBrett Ratner, who was previously considered to direct \"X-Men\" in 1996, and John Moore were both in the running to replace Vaughn during pre-production. On June 5, 2005, Ratner was confirmed as Vaughn's replacement. Ratner said he was surprised to get an invitation, as he thought he would have no chance to do a comic-book film after the cancelled \"\" for Warner Bros. With a limited knowledge of the \"X-Men\" mythos, Ratner trusted his writers on doing something faithful to the comics, having the script drawing all of its scenes from the original Marvel publications.\n\nSimon Kinberg, who had worked in other two Marvel adaptations for Fox, \"Fantastic Four\" and \"Elektra\", was hired as writer for \"X-Men 3\" in August 2004. \"X2\" co-writer Zak Penn was separately working on his own draft, and the two joined forces for a combined screenplay in January 2005. Kinberg wanted \"The Dark Phoenix Saga\" to be the emotional plot of the film, while \"Gifted\" would serve as the political focus. The duo had seven months to complete \"The Last Stand\"s script, and during the first week of work completed the first eighty pages, consisting of the first two-thirds of the plot. This incomplete draft was leaked to Ain't It Cool News, who proceeded to write a negative review.\n\nThe writers had to fight Fox's executives to retain the Phoenix plot, as the studio only wanted the cure story as it provided a reason for Magneto's conflict with the X-Men. Still the disputes made them not add much for Jean Grey to do in most of the film's second half, as the executives considered the tone of the Phoenix story too dark for a mainstream summer movie, and that its appeal would be limited to hardcore fans rather than a general audience. Penn defended the divergences from the original Dark Phoenix stories, stating that the Phoenix was not a firebird-shaped cosmic force \"because it doesn't fit into the world,\" and that Cyclops did not have as much screentime as Wolverine because the latter was more popular and \"with Cyclops, you can't see his eyes. It's a harder character to relate to for the audience.\" Killing Cyclops was Fox's decision, based on the availability of actor James Marsden, who was cast in Singer's \"Superman Returns\". The studio considered killing him off-screen with a dialogue reference, but Kinberg and Penn insisted that Jean kill him, emphasizing their relationship. Xavier's death was intended to match the impact of Spock's demise in \"\", as Fox felt the script called for a dramatic turning point. Kinberg and Penn were originally cautious, but grew to like the idea of killing off Xavier. They decided to write a post-credits scene suggesting the character's return for a sequel.\n\nAs the studio was simultaneously developing \"\", limitations were set on which mutants could be used for cameo appearances in \"X-Men 3\" in an attempt to avoid risking character development for \"Wolverine\". Gambit was considered for both the convoy scene being freed by Magneto and the Battle of Alcatraz along with the X-Men, but the writers did not want to introduce a fan favorite character and \"not be able to do him justice.\" Kinberg reasoned, \"there just wasn't enough space\", and considered Gambit would only work with as much screentime as Beast. Alan Cumming had been uncomfortable with the long hours he had to take with the prosthetic makeup as Nightcrawler in \"X2\", but still planned to return for the sequel. The part of Nightcrawler was so minimal, however, that the studio felt it was not worthwhile to go through the long and costly makeup process, and the character was cut. Kinberg felt that \"there wasn't much left to do with the character. It also felt like he might tread a little bit on the terrain of Beast, in terms of similarities in the characters and their political standpoints in terms of dealing with their mutancy.\" Nightcrawler's absence was later explained in . The introductory scenes tried to emulate the Auschwitz opener for the first film, going with different scenes that resonated later in the plot instead of an action scene like in most blockbusters. Afterwards came a scene in the Danger Room, which was considered for the previous \"X-Men\" films but never included for budget and writing concerns. The writers tried to make the simulation not feel extraneous by showcasing some of the character conflicts and abilities in a \"Days of Future Past\"-inspired battle with a Sentinel. Another repurposed scene was Magneto attacking the convoy to free Mystique, Madrox and Juggernaut, which Penn had previously envisioned for \"X2\".\n\nRatner collaborated with Penn and Kinberg in rearranging the plot structure of the film. Originally, the Golden Gate Bridge sequence was in the middle of the film, where the moved bridge was used by Magneto to free mutants being held prisoners on Alcatraz, and the climax was set in Washington, D.C.. Ratner felt too many recent action films, such as \"Planet of the Apes\" and \"X2\" itself, had their ending in Washington, and the Golden Gate sequence \"would be the biggest sequence in my entire career\", and suggested to instead put the Worthington laboratory in Alcatraz, along with \"creating a face for the cure\", which became the character of Jimmy/Leech. Kinberg agreed, as he previously argued with Penn about \"blowing so many things early in the movie\".\n\n\"X-Men: The Last Stand\" began shooting in August 2005 and wrapped in January 2006. Much of the film was shot at Vancouver Film Studios, the same location of \"X2\". Locations included the Hatley Park National Historic Site and Royal Roads University, which doubled for the X-Mansion. An old lumber mill next to the Fraser River doubled as Alcatraz Island. The tight schedule made Ratner \"begin post-production the day I started shooting,\" sending the scenes he had just filmed to his editors. The editing team was led by Mark Helfrich, who had edited all of Ratner's films, assisted by Mark Goldblatt in the action scenes and Julia Wong with effects-heavy footage.\n\nAccording to associate producer Dave Gordon, \"This is the biggest production ever filmed in Canada. It used to be \"X2\", now it's \"X3\".\" The $210million budget also made \"The Last Stand\" the most expensive film to be made at the time. The film's record would be first broken by \"\"'s $225million budget. The original cinematographer was Philippe Rousselot, who eventually opted to depart production. Dante Spinotti, a frequent collaborator of Ratner, replaced him, with assistance of J. Michael Muro. Fox Filmed Entertainment co-chairmen Thomas Rothman and Jim Gianopulos debated whether Rogue should give Iceman a passionate kiss at the film's end or simply hold his hand. The two executives screened \"The Last Stand\" for their daughters, as well as the studio's female marketing executives, and the hand holding prevailed. Gianopulos stated that the kissing \"was all about sex, and we didn't want that.\" A strong campaign of secrecy about the script was enforced by Ratner and the writers. Even the actors had problems with getting full screenplays, the call sheets did not reveal all the characters, and many scenes were shot in varied ways. Both of the ending scenes were not included on the shooting script, with Ratner taking a small crew during one day's lunch time to film the post-credits scene with Xavier, and later going to London to film Magneto in the park.\n\nIn 2014, Kinberg said of the wobbling chess piece at the end of the film, \"There is a scene before the credits where Magneto's playing chess, and you see that he can just make the chess piece move, so there's a hint that he's starting to regain his powers. The leap from there was that cure from \"The Last Stand\" didn't work exactly the way they thought it would, and so we just leaped forward however many years, and he's got his powers back.\"\n\nTo make sure the visual effects were made in just one year and without exceeding the budget, special effects supervisor John Bruno shipped the 900 effects shots to eleven companies in four countries – United States, New Zealand, United Kingdom and Canada – and did extensive previsualization. Their work begun in April 2005, before the director Brett Ratner had even been announced, and Bruno made sure to emphasize practical effects, \"shoot as many practical elements as possible, and only use CG when we had to.\" For instance, complex wirework rigs were employed which enabled the actors to do some stunts without resorting to digital doubles, including a computer controlled flying rig from Cirque Du Soleil for Angel's flight, and one for Halle Berry's flying spins.\n\nBruno estimates one-sixth of the effects budget was spent on the Golden Gate Bridge scene, which employed both a miniature of the bridge and computer graphics. The miniature was filmed over a period of two months in Santa Clarita, California, just outside of Los Angeles. The effects team would shoot one minute of footage outdoors each day at \"golden hour,\" complete with explosives in order to have enough plates to composite the scene.The effects team had to work without reference footage due to the city of San Francisco vetting any filming in the actual bridge, including aerial shooting as the area has restrictions on flying helicopters. Framestore had further challenges in matching the varied weather conditions across the film's plates. As compositing supervisor Matt Twyford detailed, \"the elements consisted of cold, rainy night live-action footage from Vancouver, sunny day miniature elements, traditional misty day background plates of San Francisco, and of course the CG bridge and fx elements.\" Another miniature was for the Grey home, which had a destructable equivalent matched the Canadian location and also had a digital equivalent. A notable effect was the \"digital skin-grafting\", which rejuvenated the faces of senior actors Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen, made by the Brothers Strause's Lola Visual Effects. Bruno made sure to ask the atomization made by Phoenix was not too vivid and gruesome, instead resembling oatmeal.\n\nRatner, a fan of John Powell's work in \"The Bourne Identity\", invited Powell to write the music for \"The Last Stand\". Powell was unsure if the \"Bourne\" work was \"the kind of score that would fit the film\" and Fox became reluctant on the composer's availability, given he was already scoring \"\" at the time of Ratner's contact. However, Powell finished the \"Ice Age\" score early to accept the \"X-Men\" job even if it meant a tighter schedule. Powell included references to the score from the previous two films as \"it all had to be in the same family, and the same language\". The Phoenix theme used lyrics from Benjamin Britten's \"Requiem Mass\" for the choir parts. A soundtrack album was released on May 23, 2006.\n\nThe marketing for \"The Last Stand\" was darker and more ambiguous compared to the two predecessors. Fox president Tom Rothman declared that the decision was made so the film would \"be different from all of the other movies in the summer,\" with a campaign that \"wanted people to stop and not have it be so immediately apparent that we're selling a movie. We're interested in selling an emotion and an idea.\" The film's official website was launched in October 2005. The teaser trailer release with \"King Kong\" the following December was done in conjunction with the studio releasing the film's first official screen shots of the film to \"USA Today\". Diamond Select Toys created a toy line, scanning the actors from the film with likenesses for the first time in the trilogy. Additional product tie-ins came with Harley-Davidson and 7-Eleven. A seven-minute sneak peek aired on Fox Broadcasting two weeks before the film's theatrical release.\n\nDel Rey Books published a novelization of the film, written by comic book writer Chris Claremont, while Newmarket Press published \"The Art of X-Men: The Last Stand: From Concept to Feature Film\". Claremont also worked on Activision's tie-in video game, \"\", doing the script along with screenwriter Zak Penn. The game's story bridges the events between \"X2\" and \"The Last Stand\", featuring Wolverine, Iceman and Nightcrawler as playable characters, voiced by their film portrayers Hugh Jackman, Shawn Ashmore, and Alan Cumming. Patrick Stewart also appears as Professor X. The game was released to negative reviews and eventually underperformed commercially.\n\n\"X-Men: The Last Stand\" premiered at an out-of-competition event of the 2006 Cannes Film Festival on May 22, 2006. Two days later, Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry and Kelsey Grammer attended an advance screening at USS \"Kearsarge\" (LHD-3), as the ship was en route to New York City for Fleet Week. The film was released in the United States on May 26, 2006, in 3,690 theaters, while also opening in 95 international markets that same weekend.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 57% based on 238 reviews, with an average rating of 5.93/10, as of March 2020. The site's critical consensus reads, \"\"X-Men: The Last Stand\" provides plenty of mutant action for fans of the franchise, even if it does so at the expense of its predecessors' deeper moments.\" At Metacritic, the film has a score of 58 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\n\"Ebert and Roeper\" gave the film a \"two thumbs up\" rating, with Roger Ebert saying, \"I liked the action, I liked the absurdity, I liked the incongruous use and misuse of mutant powers, and I especially liked the way it introduces all of those political issues and lets them fight it out with the special effects.\" Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com gave it a mixed review, noting that it was \"only half a mess\", and that Ratner \"could have stuck a bit more closely to the 'Dark Phoenix' narrative than he did.\" However, Zacharek did note that that third act captured some of the original story's \"majesty\", praising the performances of Jackman, McKellen, Romijn and Janssen. \nFamke Janssen's performance was praised by critics. Matt Mueller of \"Total Film\" was impressed with Janssen's performance and said, \"Playing the super-freaky mind-control goddess like \"GoldenEye\"'s Xenia Onatopp's all-powerful psycho sister, her scenes – particularly that one with the house – crackle with energy and tragedy. If only the rest of \"X3\" had followed suit.\"\n\nJustin Chang of \"Variety\" said the film was \"a wham-bam sequel noticeably lacking in the pop gravitas, moody atmospherics, and emotional weight that made the first two Marvel comicbook adaptations so rousingly successful.\" Frank Lovece of \"Film Journal International\" said, \"A risk-taking script with genuine consequences elevates this above the lackluster direction of Brett Ratner, whose competent mechanics move the story efficiently but with very little soul.\" Lisa Schwarzbaum of \"Entertainment Weekly\" called it a \"\"diminished sequel, a brute-force enterprise\" and said it was an example of \"what happens when movies are confused with sandwich shops as franchise opportunities\". The Minneapolis \"Star Tribune\" characterized Ratner's approach as \"Forget subtlety! Let's blow things up!\" David Edelstein of \"New York\" magazine called it \"just another big-budget B-movie. It's a fast and enjoyable B-movie, though.\" Foreshadowing \"\", Peter Travers of \"Rolling Stone\" said, \"Last stand? My ass. Billed as the climax of a trilogy, the third and weakest chapter in the X-Men series is a blatant attempt to prove there is still life in the franchise. And there is: just enough to pull a \"Star Trek\" and spawn a \"Next Generation\" saga.\"\n\n\"X-Men: The Last Stand\" has been criticized by fans for killing off major characters such as Professor Charles Xavier, Cyclops, and Jean Grey. The 2014 film \"\" has subsequently been viewed by some critics as a revision of those controversial plot elements in \"X-Men: The Last Stand\". Writer Kinberg would later state that \"there are a lot of things about 'X3' that I love and there are a lot of things that I regret\", detailing that he would have preferred the Dark Phoenix as the main plotline and \"I would have fought harder\" for that, considering that at the period \"the darkness of her story was a little bit daunting on a huge $200million studio movie\" leading Fox to ask for rewrites. Previous \"X-Men\" director Bryan Singer declared that \"The Last Stand\" \"isn't what I would have done\" and he was dissatisfied with the busy plot and excessive character deaths, but Singer still liked some parts of the movie, such as Ellen Page's casting – leading Singer to bring her back as Kitty Pryde in \"\" – and the scenes with Leech, which he described as \"really sweet moments\". Matthew Vaughn, who was attached as director before dropping out, said that given the limited time they had to make it, the film was \"pretty good\" but criticized Ratner's direction: \"I could have done something with far more emotion and heart. I'm probably going to be told off for saying that, but I genuinely believe it.\" While promoting his own installment of the franchise, 2011's \"\", Vaughn would say regarding \"The Last Stand\" that \"I storyboarded the whole bloody film, did the script. My \"X3\" would have been 40 minutes longer. They didn't let the emotions and the drama play in that film. It became wall-to-wall noise and drama. I would have let it breathe and given far more dramatic elements to it.\" Having admitted being unhappy with the way some elements of the film turned out, Kinberg then went on to direct and write the reboot film \"Dark Phoenix\", which retold the events of \"X-Men: The Last Stand\".\n\nThe film broke the Memorial Day weekend record with $102,750,665 in its four-day opening weekend. The film's release was also a new single-day record for Friday openings. The opening weekend gross was surpassed six weeks later by \"\", making \"The Last Stand\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s opening the second-highest of 2006. Internationally, \"The Last Stand\" topped the box office in 26 countries with a total gross of $76.1million overall, but suffered competition from \"The Da Vinci Code\", which retained the top spot in most markets, and beat \"The Last Stand\" in international gross that weekend with $91million. The film's second weekend dropped 67 percent to $34million, which was the steepest post-Memorial Day opening drop on record. \"X-Men: The Last Stand\" eventually grossed $234,362,462 in the domestic box office and $224,997,093 internationally, for a worldwide total of $459,359,555, the fourth-highest in domestic grosses and seventh-highest worldwide for 2006. \"X-Men: The Last Stand\" was also the highest-grossing film in the franchise, until it was surpassed by \"X-Men: Days of Future Past\" eight years later.\n\n\"X-Men: The Last Stand\" was released on October 3, 2006, on DVD. It was available in three editions: single-disc, two-disc, and a trilogy box set with the previous two films. Extras included three alternative endings, each with optional commentary by director Ratner; 10 deleted scenes; audio commentaries from Ratner, the writers and the producers; and two hidden Easter eggs. The two-disc edition came with a 100-page commemorative comic book with a new story written by \"X-Men\" co-creator Stan Lee, his first original Marvel comic book in five years. The DVD sold 2.6million units in its first day, exceeding Fox's expectations, and sold a total 5million in its first week. A Blu-ray edition was issued in November 2006.\n\n\"X-Men: The Last Stand\" is included in the \"X-Men Trilogy\" 4K UHD Blu-Ray set which was released on September 25, 2018.\n\nIn February 2006, Ratner said that \"The Last Stand\" could be the final \"X-Men\" film: \"We wanted to make sure the audiences knew that this was a trilogy. Even though they weren't made together like \"Lord of the Rings\", this is really closure for the \"X-Men\" series. ... This is the last stand for sure.\"\n\nThe next two \"X-Men\" films, \"\" (2009) and \"\" (2011) were prequels that took place before the events of the first \"X-Men\" movie. The first film set chronologically after \"The Last Stand\" was \"The Wolverine\", released in 2013. A stand-alone sequel, \"The Wolverine\" shows Logan heading for Japan to escape the memories of what occurred during \"The Last Stand\". Hugh Jackman and Famke Janssen reprised their roles, while Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart appear in a mid-credits scene.\n\n\"\", the direct sequel to \"The Last Stand\", was released on May 23, 2014, with Jackman, Berry, Stewart, McKellen, Paquin, Page, Ashmore, Cudmore, Grammer, Janssen, and Marsden reprising their respective roles. The plot, inspired by the comic book \"Days of Future Past\" story arc, begins with a dystopian future set years after \"The Last Stand\". Wolverine's consciousness is sent back in time, to his 1973 body in order to guide the younger Xavier and Magneto into preventing the events that lead to the desolate future. The events of the film end up retroactively changing the continuity of the series, changing some events in films set after \"First Class\", resulting in an altered timeline where Jean and Cyclops are still alive.\n\n"}

He studied Music at Amherst College. He is Jewish. He has said that one of his grandmothers was from Latvia and one of his grandfathers was from Austria.\n\nMiller is primarily regarded as a character actor and is well known for playing 'stuck up to suck up' characters that alternate between being condescending and sycophantic.\n\nMiller's first acting job was as the Emcee on the TV series \"Fame\". He gained mainstream attention for his part in popular scenes of \"Pretty Woman\" involving him as a store clerk for the main characters.\n\nHis film roles include Walter Stratford in the movie \"10 Things I Hate About You\", as well as several characters in Christopher Guest's mockumentary movies. He has held prominent supporting roles in \"Carry On Columbus\", \"The Nutty Professor\", \"\", and \"Max Keeble's Big Move\". He has over 50 film appearances.\n\nHe was part of the main cast of \"Life's Work\", \"The Pursuit of Happiness\", and \"High School Cupid, a Cupid Inc. Story\". He is also a frequent guest actor on television, most notably as the nasty doorman on \"Seinfeld\". He played Edwin Poole in the ABC dramedy \"Boston Legal\". He played night-club owner Michael Dobson in two \"Law & Order\" episodes, first in the episode \"Coma\" and then later in \"Encore\". Miller appeared as himself in a third episode, \"Smoke\". He was also in \"8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter\", where he played Tommy, Kyle's obnoxious father and Paul's colleague.\n\nHe is close friends with Jerry Seinfeld and auditioned for the part of George Costanza.\n\nMiller served as a writer for the television shows \"Uncommon Sense\" (2005), \"Just Words\" (1992), and \"Pros & Cons\" (1999).\n\nFrom 2002 to 2004, Miller wrote a column for the magazine \"The Weekly Standard\" that usually ran once every two weeks. Since then, he has continued to contribute occasionally to the magazine. His subject matter has included politics as well as reminiscences about fellow entertainers, and anecdotes from his own life.\n\nTwo of the columns he wrote in 2002 served as the text for frequently forwarded emails at the time, though in both cases his words were attributed to others. The first was his very first \"Weekly Standard\" column in January 2002, in which he mocked various anti-war platitudes of the time; the text was incorrectly attributed to retired Air Force general Richard E. Hawley. The second was an April 2002 column defending Israel in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, which was attributed to fellow comedian Dennis Miller. Another email which also began to be forwarded in 2002, purporting to offer \"George Carlin's Views on Aging\", was derived in part from a stand-up routine that Larry Miller performed in the 1990s.\n\nMiller began a weekly podcast on the Carolla Digital Network, \"This Week with Larry Miller\", suspending it after falling and injuring his head severely in April 2012. After hospitalization and a coma, he said in January 2013 that he was convalescing. Miller resumed the podcast on January 9, 2013. In February 2015 the podcast was retitled \"The Larry Miller Show\" with direct distribution.\n\nMiller married television writer Eileen Conn in 1993. The couple has two children.\n\n"}

His career did have an early start, however. In Shiraz, he first opened a newspaper called \"Banāy-i Islam\" (Foundations of Islam), followed by the newspaper \"Ra'd\" (Thunder) at the age of 23. After \"Ra'd\" was shut down by the authorities, he then published another newspaper called \"Bargh\" (Lightning), and became active in the Persian Constitutional Revolution.\n\nHis political tendencies were perceived to be pro-British by many Iranians and British diplomats. However, when he went into exile in the Palestine in the 1930s, he received money from fascist Italy and promised an oil concession in northern Iran. The historian Ervand Abrahamian characterized Tabatabaee as a \"right-wing opportunist\". In Palestine, he was also hired as a senior consultant by the government of Afghanistan with Britain's backing. Tehran's government vehemently objected to this move, leading Kabul to back down on the initiative.\n\nTabatabaee died at the age of 80 of a heart attack in Tehran. He was buried in Ray.\n\nSometime after his death, the ownership of Tabatabaee's house was transferred to SAVAK and was then converted into what is today known as Evin Prison, the main prison where political prisoners are kept, both before the Iranian Revolution and afterwards.\n\nIt is argued by the historian Cyrus Ghani, that Tabatabaee was out of his depth when it came to governing . He was an incompetent administrator who had grandiose agenda such as reorganization of ministries, granting lands to peasants, which never fully came to fruition . The only plan of Tabatabaee that came to fruition was the closure of ships on Fridays and holidays, the end of sale and consumption of alcohol, and having calls to prayers at public buildings at noontime; these were motivated steps for the goal of getting greater support from the Ulama . Moreover, the average Iranian thought of him as first being concerned about British interests . \n\n"}

Hoplin focused on strengthening the national College Republican organization's political influence during his tenure as Chairman. His administration was the subject of a fund-raising scandal involving direct mail solicitations from senior citizens by Response Dynamics, Inc.. Hoplin is credited and widely lauded for completing the task begun under predecessor Scott Stewart of terminating the decade old contract with Response Dynamics, Inc.\n\nIn 2004, Hoplin and his administration organized a program of paid field staffers to recruit College Republicans across the country, helping to provide volunteers for numerous Republican campaigns, including the successful reelection effort of President George W. Bush.\n\nHoplin chose not to run for reelection as CRNC Chairman in 2005, pursuing the post of Deputy Chairman of the Minnesota Republican Party instead. He was elected to that position in June 2005. Hoplin was succeeded as CRNC Chairman by Paul Gourley of South Dakota in a highly contested election against Michael Davidson. The contest gave rise to a rapid but short-lived proliferation of CRNC related blogs, most of which have since ceased publishing updated content.\n\nIn March 2007, Hoplin announced that he would not seek re-election to the position of Deputy Chairman of the Republican Party of Minnesota. He gave his reasons as wishing to continue a further education and work abroad.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2029909", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2029909", "title": "Bizenghast", "text": "Bizenghast\n\nBizenghast is a debut gothic graphic novel series written and illustrated by M. Alice LeGrow. The first seven volumes were published by Tokyopop, with the final volume released in late April 2012. After placing in Tokyopop's Rising Stars of Manga competition with her short story \"Nikolai\", LeGrow successfully pitched the series to Tokyopop's editors. She worked on the series from 2004 to 2011. Set in the haunted New England town of Bizenghast, the story follows Dinah, an orphaned teenager who is tasked with returning each night to an ancient mausoleum to free the ghosts within the building.\n\nSeveral adaptations of \"Bizenghast\" have been released, including a novel by Shawn Thorgersen, animated episodes, and a tabletop roleplaying game. Critics praised \"Bizenghast\" for the gothic atmosphere and art, but noted the traditional elements and varying quality of the series.\n\nSet in the fictional New England town of the same name, \"Bizenghast\" focuses on fifteen-year-old Dinah Wherever. Her parents' car crash leaves her orphaned at a young age, and as a result, she moves in with her aunt. Dinah can see the ghosts which haunt her aunt's house, which was a hospital and later a boarding school; however, her aunt and doctor believe that she suffers from schizophrenia. One day, she and her only friend, Vincent Monroe, sneak out of her aunt's house to search for materials for his garden. They stumble across an ancient mausoleum, and after Dinah reads aloud from a plaque, she discovers that her name is written on a contract which binds her to return to the mausoleum every night to free the ghosts. If she succeeds, she will win her freedom and a reward. If she fails, she will die and stay in the mausoleum as a corpse.\n\nFor every ten ghosts appeased, Dinah and Vincent get a tower guard to help with their task. Over the course of the series, they meet two of the guards: Edaniel, a grinning cat-like creature, and his brother Edrear, who secretly likes Dinah. Vincent dies while in one of the vaults, causing Dinah to become depressed. Later, the hooded angel, which normally guards the entrance to the mausoleum, appears as two stones that talk to Dinah and help her overcome the depression which resulted from Vincent's death.\n\nDinah continues searching the vaults and discovers that Edaniel and Edrear's sister, Eniri, is missing, and that the seed of the mausoleum—its link to the Host in the afterlife—has been stolen. Additionally, Edaniel and Edrear's other sister, Elala, is found dead. After Edaniel and Edrear lock down the mausoleum, they send Dinah home and she discovers that Maphohetka, a girl hanged for witchcraft and who now as a ghost can control minds in the real world, is manipulating Eniri and the townspeople. Unsuccessful in her attempt to stop her, Dinah flees to the mausoleum and receives a special outfit melted from the gold tolls that she and Vincent paid to gain access to the mausoleum. Returning, she confronts Maphohetka, who then orders Edaniel to kill her.\n\nIn the ensuing battle, Dinah faces off against her former friend, accidentally decapitating Edaniel in the process. An enraged Edrear attempts to kill her, but eventually halts when Dinah points out that he's crying for his brother, something that he's normally unable to do and that's being caused by Maphohetka's influence. Knowing that he's been compromised, Edrear stabs himself with his own sword, leaving Dinah to mourn him and share one kiss. Maphohetka, taking the opportunity, destroys Dinah's scythe (the only thing she had that could potentially kill her) and ends up mutating into a large monster. After Dinah is captured in Maphohetka's body, she happens upon the entity's core, which is Maphohetka's decayed corpse. Using Eniri's bracelet to see into the monster, she finds that a piece of the cross Maphohetka was stabbed with during her hanging is still lodged in her chest, allowing Dinah to conclude that the piece is what keeps the evil spirit anchored in the living world. Dinah removes the cross shard, causing Maphohetka to fade away.\n\nWanting to seek help, Dinah stabs herself with the crucifix piece, allowing her to temporarily ascend into the afterlife. There, she encounters her mother, who gives her another mausoleum seed that Dinah takes back to the living world. Dinah uses the seed to revive everyone killed in the incident and her armor melts into coins that flow out of the fountain. But in the end, Dinah opts to remove the crucifix piece, killing herself.\n\nDinah walks through her own funeral, bidding her mourning aunt goodbye before wandering outside. On the way, she encounters Vincent, but the two don't recognize each other until they find the hidden graveyard. Dinah and Vincent become two mausoleum guards alongside a revived Edaniel and Edrear (two young women who happened onto the graveyard having been contracted to the mausoleum). The series closes with Dinah on top of one of the towers beside Vincent, commenting how \"she's starting to like this town.\"\n\nAs a young girl, Mary Alice LeGrow was not interested in comics since she grew up in Weisbaden, Germany where comics were not readily available. In her freshman year of high school, she discovered comics and anime. She heard about Tokyopop's Rising Stars of Manga competition from a friend at the 2003 Otakon, an anime convention in Baltimore, Maryland; the stort story LeGrow submitted won a runner-up place in the competition and was published in the 2003 Rising Stars of Manga anthology. She successfully pitched \"Bizenghast\" to the Tokyopop editors, and became the second Rising Stars of Manga winner to have an original series published by Tokyopop.\n\nLeGrow worked on the series from 2004 to 2011. She began \"Bizenghast\" when, for an art class assignment, she drew an open door and added the hooded angel statue in another class. In her initial designs, Dinah had simple features and short black hair, and Vincent was one of Dinah's friends. LeGrow later removed the other friends from the story. She later lengthened Dinah's hair and depicted her dressed in Lolita fashion—clothing influenced by the Rococo and Victorian eras. Other changes included Dinah's hair being altered from straight to curly and the addition of an exoskeleton-like armour to Edrear. Tired of thin female characters in comics, LeGrow designed Edaniel's girlfriend, Nareesha as \"super full-figured\".\n\nWhen deciding on names for her protagonist, LeGrow considered Molly, Charlotte, Moira, Sally, and Diana before choosing Dinah—a reference to the pet cat of the protagonist of Lewis Carroll's novel \"Alice in Wonderland\"; the 1984 comedy film \"Johnny Dangerously\" inspired her last name, Wherever. Vincent Monroe takes his name from Vincent Price and the actress Marilyn Monroe. Jane, Dinah's aunt, shares her name with LeGrow's sister. Edaniel takes his name from the name Daniel in a middle school yearbook which LeGrow picked at random; she noted that the editors let her keep him in the story although he appeared a risky character to them. Edrear was initially named Mordred after the character from Arthurian myths. The name of his sister Elala comes from the character Lala Orange of \"Rainbow Brite\", an animated television series. The minor character Prince Ironbound takes his name from the city Ironbound, New Jersey, while Lalibela, a holy town in northern Ethiopia, inspired Bali Lali's. Another minor character, Dr. Morstan, takes his name from Mary Morstan, Dr. Watson’s wife. \"марионетка\", the Russian word for marionette, inspired the name of the antagonist Maphohetka.\n\nLeGrow comments that the series \"is about life, death and fabulous outfits (not in that order)\" and notes that there are \"a lot of religious themes\" present. The town of Bizenghast \"represents a world cut off from that sort of constant access [of technology].\" The series was initially written to span about fourteen volumes and be divided into three seasons: the first seven volumes would make up the first story arc; the second season, volumes eight through eleven, would center on the mausoleum's relationship with the other guilds; and season three would focus on the afterlife and consist of the last three volumes. LeGrow also considered writing a spin-off based on \"Bizenghast\" with a guest artist, after she finished the first story arc of \"Bizenghast\". The spin-off would contain chapters not present in the original series, and after her other series was completed, she would continue \"Bizenghast\". LeGrow concluded \"Bizenghast\" at eight volumes.\n\nA minor controversy occurred over a statement published in the July 2007 issue of the Tokyopop publication \"Takuhai\" and in the back of the first \"Bizenghast\" volume written by a former Tokyopop editor and not authorized by LeGrow. It read:\n\nLeGrow called it \"worded in a way that I felt was offensive to me and to cosplayers\" and noted that \"none of it reflects my opinions.\" Fan reaction to learning that the statement was inaccurate was generally relief since \"they felt it didn't mesh with [her] personality.\" She stated:\n\nWritten and illustrated by M. Alice LeGrow, \"Bizenghast\" is published in North America by Tokyopop. As of July 2010, seven volumes have been released. The first was released on 9 August 2005; the most recent was published 1 July 2010. However, Tokyopop's North American branch stopped publishing on 31 May, 2011; because of it, the final volume of the series is being released through a print-on-demand agreement with RightStuf.com. The series is also distributed in New Zealand and Australia by Madman Entertainment, in Hungary by Mangattack, in Germany by Tokyopop Germany, in Finland by Pauna Media Group, and in Russia by Comix-art.\n\nThree books based on \"Bizenghast\" have been released. On 13 February 2007, Tokyopop also released a 72-page limited-edition art book, \"Bizenghast: Falling into Fear\" (), which included stickers and pinup pages.\nRunning Press published a coloring book based on the series, \"Color Me Manga: Bizenghast\" () on 12 November 2007. On 13 August 2008, Tokyopop published a novel adaption, \"Bizenghast: The Novel\" (), written by Shawn Thorgersen and with illustrations by LeGrow.\n\nMenfond Electronic Art adapted \"Bizenghast\" into animated short episodes or \"iManga\". The iManga episodes featured music by Divine Madness and Kissing Violet, and premiered on My Space in summer 2007. Overall, LeGrow praised the adaption. She liked the \"kooky\" background effects and Edaniel's voice actor, but disliked Dinah's \"high-pitched\" voice which she had imagined as \"deeper...with a slight edge to it. Sort of like Mandy from \"The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy\", but without the sarcasm.\" The episodes were also available on Verizon's V CAST. The television network iaTV acquired the seventeen two- to three-minute-long episodes as part of a \"program acquisition deal and strategic ad sales partnership with Tokyopop.\"\n\nA tabletop roleplaying game based on the series was created by Clint Krause. Other merchandise included posters, scarves, playing cards, a plushie, postcards, a signed puzzle kit, and T-shirts. Additionally, a two-and-a-half-hour DVD commentary about the first \"Bizenghast\" volume, with Tokyopop editor interviews and bonus material, was planned to be released in mid-August 2010.\n\n\"Bizenghast\" was well received by English-language readers. The first volume debuted at the 79th spot on a list of the top 100 best-selling graphic novels of August 2005 with an estimated 1,434 copies sold. \"Daily Variety\" named \"Bizenghast\" one of Tokyopop's top ten biggest titles. In June 2010, the seventh volume sold 425 copies, ranking 294th on the list of the top 300 best-selling graphic novels.\n\n\"Bizenghast\" received positive reviews from critics. The September 2005 issue of \"Teen People\" listed \"Bizenghast\" as the Hot Book of the Month. Sheena McNeil of \"Sequential Tart\" praised the first volume as \"a highly enjoyable read\". Coolstreak Cartoons's Leroy Douresseaux described the series as \"belong[ing] to a fantasy subgenre sometimes referred to as 'pop Gothic' and relying on atmosphere and looks. Critics praised the art of \"Bizenghast\" as detailed, but did not see it as manga-styled. \"Anime Jump\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Chad Clayton called the series \"heavily steeped in the gothic tradition\" and commented that the series \"successfully develops an inventive visual style all its own. It seems to owe more to classical art, gothic comics, and even artists like Edward Gorey than it does to manga.\" Johanna Draper Carlson, a longtime reviewer for \"Publishers Weekly\", found the art reminiscent \"of classic fantasy indy comics\" and noted \"stock elements\" in the story. Reviewers found Dinah's character design \"striking\" and with the potential to appeal to fans of the Gothic Lolita fashion. Criticism focused on the writing, \"uneven pacing\", flat characters, and the varying quality of the art. Anime News Network's Zac Bertschy heavily criticized \"Bizenghast\" for the \"slightly modified generic monster-of-the-week cliché\" plot, one-dimensional characters, and art. David Welsh compared \"Bizenghast\" to \"a cosplay of a horror manga\", and wrote: \"It’s got a handle on the cosmetics, but central elements of story and character are vague and underdeveloped.\"\n\nIn his review of the novel adaption, Mania Entertainment's Greg Hackmann disliked the large amount of description, the \"inconsistent\" narration, and felt that the novel was more of a \"novelization in the most literal sense of the word, reading much less like an adaptation in the spirit of LeGrow's work than a 1-to-1 copy of the source material.\" Conversely, Sabrina Fritz wrote that the novel adaption was \"well-written, [and] engaging\" and called it \"one of the best light novels on the market\". Another reviewer for Mania Entertainment, Danielle Van Gorder, enjoyed \"[t]he detail and perspective in the architectural drawings\" and \"incredibly detailed costumes\" of the art book \"Falling into Fear\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2029910", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2029910", "title": "Nordic League", "text": "Nordic League\n\nThe Nordic League was a far right organisation in the United Kingdom from 1935 to 1939 that sought to serve as a co-ordinating body for the various extremist movements whilst also seeking to promote Nazism. The League was a private organisation that did not organise any public events.\n\nThe Nordic League (NL) originated in 1935 when agents of Alfred Rosenberg's \"Nordische Gesellschaft\" arrived in Britain to establish a UK version of their movement. The main force behind this new group was Unionist MP Archibald Maule Ramsay who chaired the group's 14-man leadership council. The group's constitution described it as an \"association of race conscious Britons\" and sought to co-ordinate all far-right and fascist movements whilst giving particular emphasis to anti-Semitism.\n\nThe League sought to unite leading figures from across the far right, as demonstrated in April 1939 when a meeting addressed by Ramsay was chaired by a member of the British Union of Fascists who was supported by former British Fascists president R. B. D. Blakeney and Imperial Fascist League member E. H. Cole. Other leading members included J. F. C. Fuller, the United Empire Fascist Party leader and Nazi agent Serocold Skeels, Henry Hamilton Beamish, Arnold Leese and P. J. Ridout. The latter was credited with helping to popularise the NL's slogan \"Perish Judah\", which was frequently rendered \"P.J.\" in public.\n\nBUF leader Oswald Mosley, fearful of being too closely associated with the League's extremist rhetoric, did not join but he permitted party members to do so which the likes of Fuller, Robert Gordon-Canning and Oliver C. Gilbert did readily. As a result of these links the BUF was able to absorb the National Socialist Workers Party, a small group led by NL member Lieutenant-Colonel Graham Seton-Hutchison.\n\nThe NL was closely linked to the \"White Knights of Britain\", a secret society otherwise known as the Hooded Men with ritual initiation based on Freemasonry and compared to the Ku Klux Klan that was active from 1935 to 1937.The White Knights and the NL shared the same building as their headquarters. Another group, the Militant Christian Patriots, that was active after the Munich Crisis urging Neville Chamberlain not to become involved in a \"Jewish war\", was also closely connected to the NL and said by MI5 to be a front organisation. By using this group and another front organisation, the Liberty Restoration League, the NL was able to ensure that high-ranking figures such as the Duke of Wellington, the Duchess of Hamilton, Baron Brocket, and Michael O'Dwyer became involved in their movement.\n\nThe NL came under increasing scrutiny after Kristallnacht, particularly for the violence of Ramsay, William Joyce and A. K. Chesterton in their anti-Semitic speeches. Others such as Elwin Wright, who until 1937 was secretary of the Anglo-German Fellowship, called for the shooting of Jews, whilst Commander E. H. Cole condemned the House of Commons as being full of \"bastardised Jewish swine\". However, such extremist language worked against the NL because its speakers were seen by the public at large as quite mad and so their pro-appeasement arguments were ignored.\n\nFollowing the outbreak of the Second World War, two leading members, T. Victor-Rowe and Oliver Gilbert, were interned, and the NL largely went into abeyance, with members joining other, more public, anti-war groups. The League had officially disbanded as soon as war was declared although it continued to meet secretly at Gilbert's house until his arrest in late September 1939. Two of its members, Joyce and Margaret Bothamley, left Britain for Nazi Germany after the outbreak of war. Given the association of the NL with Nazism, BUF organiser Alexander Raven Thomson even suggested that Mosley publicly denounce the League as traitors in an attempt to present a more patriotic image, although Defence Regulation 18B came into force before this could be attempted.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2029911", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2029911", "title": "Adelaide 500", "text": "Adelaide 500\n\nThe Adelaide 500 (known for sponsorship reasons as the Superloop Adelaide 500) is an annual motor racing event for Supercars, held on the streets of the east end of Adelaide, South Australia, Australia. It was previously known by its longtime former name as the Clipsal 500 Adelaide or colloquially as \"Clipsal\", after the sponsor, Clipsal. First held in 1999, the event uses a shortened form of the Adelaide Street Circuit, the former Australian Grand Prix track.\n\nIt generally takes place in February and March, contributing to what locals term \"mad March\", along with the Adelaide Festival, Adelaide Fringe, WOMADelaide and Adelaide Writers' Week.\n\nCurrently held over four days in early March, the \"500\" itself currently consists of two 250 kilometre races. In addition to this, Supercars contest 105 minutes of practice over, usually, three sessions, two knockout qualifying sessions and two Top 10 shootouts to determine the grid for the two races. Up to two wildcard entries are also eligible to enter the event. Between 2014 and 2016 the event consisted of two 125 km races on the Saturday and one 250 km race on Sunday. In 2017 the organisers switched back to the original format due to the low popularity of the 125 km races from both fans and drivers.\n\nAlthough the results of all races count towards the Supercars Championship, the winner of the final race is normally declared the winner of the event, regardless of the results of the first race. The rest of the four days are filled with practice, qualifying, and support races for a number of other racing categories, which over the history of the event has included the Super2 Series, Super5000, SuperUtes Series, Touring Car Masters, Australian GT and Australian Carrera Cup amongst others. The event also regularly features evening concerts, with artists including Kiss, Mötley Crüe, Keith Urban and Robbie Williams having performed.\n\nThe Adelaide Street Circuit was used for the Formula One Australian Grand Prix from 1985 to 1995. Supercars, then known as Group A (1985 to 1992) and Group 3A Touring Cars (1993 to 1995), had competed in support races at each of these Grands Prix although these races did not count towards the annual Australian Touring Car Championship (ATCC). The state of South Australia had also previously hosted championship rounds of the ATCC at Mallala Motor Sport Park in 1963 and between 1969 and 1998 and at Adelaide International Raceway from 1972 to 1988.\n\nOn 1 September 1998, the Government of South Australia announced the conclusion of successful negotiations with the Australian Vee Eight Supercar Company (AVESCO) for the staging of a Supercars race to be known as the \"Sensational Adelaide 500\" on a shortened version of the Grand Prix track. The race effectively replaced the Mallala round on the calendar. The initial contract was for a period of five years with an option for a further five years. After the conclusion of the 1999 race, Clipsal were announced as the event's major sponsor and it became known as the \"Clipsal 500 Adelaide\", a deal which continued until 2017. After the 2018 race was held with no major naming rights sponsor, it was announced that broadband provider Superloop would take over as title sponsor for the next three years. The event currently has an agreement to appear on the calendar until 2021.\n\nThe 1999 event saw Craig Lowndes win the Saturday race, only to be disqualified due to his involvement in an accident with Danny Osborne, and made to start from the back of the grid for race two on the Sunday. Lowndes passed every car in the field to also win race two and thus become the first winner of the Adelaide 500, in what remains his only event victory. Lowndes' disqualification from race one was later overturned. The 1999 race was also controversial as the original regulations stated the race was one 500 kilometre race with an overnight break at the 250 km mark. When a significant portion of high-profile cars retired in the first leg, the regulations were changed overnight to allow those cars to start the Sunday race. The inaugural event also proved a challenge to the fitness of the drivers, with both Paul Radisich and John Faulkner requiring medical assistance due to dehydration.\n\nThe 2000 event once again saw a last-to-first drive, with Mark Skaife winning the Sunday race after starting 38th due to a DNF on Saturday. Despite this, the event win was awarded to Garth Tander, the only occasion in which the Sunday winner was not awarded the event win. In 2001 Clipsal 500, Craig Lowndes won his first race for Ford since his defection from the Holden Racing Team to a Gibson Motorsport Ford. After winning the Saturday race, he was again in contention on Sunday until an incident with his former teammate Skaife ended his charge. In 2002, the track layout received its only modification to date, with Turn 8 being re-profiled to what became known as 'The Sweeper'. The change followed Brad Jones's roll-over at the previous version of the corner in 2000 among other incidents. The re-profiled corner became one of the most infamous corners in Australian motorsport with several high-profile victims in the first year including Radisich and Glenn Seton.\n\nHolden had dominated the event from 1999 to 2003, with three wins to Skaife and one each to Bright and Tander following Lowndes' inaugural event victory. It wasn't until 2004 that a Ford driver won the event, with Marcos Ambrose winning both races, repeating the feat in 2005. Ford's turn of fate was signified by a sweep of the top four in the Saturday race of the 2005 event. Jamie Whincup then made it three in a row for Ford in 2006 with his first event win in Supercars in his first appearance for Triple Eight Race Engineering. The 2007 event brought about the first instance of the driver who scored the most weekend points not winning the event. Brothers Todd Kelly and Rick Kelly won one race each across the weekend however Rick was credited with the event win for his Sunday race victory despite scoring less points in the other race. Whincup went on to win again in 2008, 2009 and 2011 to be the most successful driver in the event's history to date. The 2008 event was, however, marred by the death of Ashley Cooper following a crash in the second-tier Fujitsu V8 Supercars Series race.\n\nFrom 2002 to 2009, the Adelaide 500 was the opening round of the championship. It lost this position in 2010 and 2011, with the Yas V8 400 in the United Arab Emirates opening the series. From 2012, Adelaide returned to being the opening round. The 2012 Clipsal 500 provided one of the event's most memorable finishes when Whincup chased down and overtook Will Davison on the final lap of the Saturday race. Whincup had made an additional pitstop and gained enough ground to take advantage when Davison's car began to run out of fuel. Davison went on to win the event with a win on Sunday, his first since joining Ford Performance Racing. The 2013 event was the first of the Car of the Future regulations, which saw Nissan and Mercedes-Benz join the series as the first manufacturers outside Ford and Holden since 1993. The Sunday race was won by Shane van Gisbergen in the aftermath of his controversial decision to announce his retirement during the 2012 season before switching teams to Tekno Autosports over the off-season.\n\nIn 2014, Volvo rejoined the series and made an immediate impact with Scott McLaughlin fighting off Whincup on the final lap to finish second in the newly-introduced second 125 km race on Saturday. On the Sunday, Jason Bright rolled his Brad Jones Racing car at the Senna Chicane, thirteen years after team boss Brad Jones rolled his car at Turn 8. James Courtney won the event and in 2015 became the fourth driver to win the Clipsal 500 back-to-back, after Skaife, Ambrose and Whincup. In doing so he also provided the Holden Racing Team with a record sixth and seventh event wins, two ahead of Triple Eight, who scored their fifth victory in 2017 with van Gisbergen. The intervening event in 2016 was disrupted by thunderstorms and heavy rain on the Sunday with Nick Percat eventually taking his first solo win and the only for Lucas Dumbrell Motorsport amidst a delayed start, confusion surrounding the fuel drop regulations and a red flag.\n\nVan Gisbergen swept the 2017 and 2018 editions of the event, taking four poles and four race victories in a return to the two by 250 km format. The 2018 victory, in the twentieth running of the event, was the first victory for the Holden ZB Commodore in its debut appearance. 2018 also saw the state of South Australia hosting two championship rounds for the first time since 1977 with The Bend Motorsport Park in Tailem Bend joining the calendar. In the return of the Ford Mustang nameplate to the championship in 2019, Scott McLaughlin achieved the same feat as van Gisbergen, winning the first championship race and round for the new car on debut. It was also the first race and round win for the Mustang nameplate since Allan Moffat at Oran Park in 1972, while McLaughlin's team's co-owner Dick Johnson had also won a non-championship race at the Adelaide Street Circuit in a Ford Mustang GT in 1985.\n\nIn the week leading into the 2020 Adelaide 500, General Motors announced that the Holden brand, which was founded in Adelaide and has competed in every edition of the championship since its inception, would be retired by the end of the year. The factory Holden team, run by Triple Eight Race Engineering, won the first race of the weekend with winner Jamie Whincup dedicating the win to Holden. Whincup's team-mate van Gisbergen was leading the Sunday race until he was forced to make an additional pitstop for fuel due to a team error and then later suffered a mechanical failure and did not finish. This granted 2019 winner McLaughlin with a back to back event win.\n\nThe Adelaide 500 was recognised on several occasions as the winner of the \"Major Festivals & Events\" category at the Australian Tourism Awards in 2003/04, 2005, 2007 and 2008. The event won best event of the series every year from 1999 to 2004. In 2005 it was inducted into the Supercars Hall of Fame and it has also been inducted into the SA Tourism Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 2008 the Clipsal 500 was attended by 291,400 people, the largest crowd for a domestic motorsport event in Australia and () the record for attendance at the event.\n\nIn 2011 the Clipsal 500 was once again named Best Event of the Year (of 14) at the V8 Supercars annual awards, after an hiatus, for the eighth time. (After being put into the sport's Hall of Fame in 2005, it was ineligible for the best event award for some years). It was also South Australia's biggest ticketed sports event for the 13th year, and by that year had won four Australian Tourism Awards and seven SA Tourism Awards for best major festival or event.\n\nBy 2017, attendance had been dropping at the event (244,350 in 2017), although television viewing figures remained strong. Robbie Williams played at the 2018 event concert, with attendance reaching attendance 273,500 that year. Attendances in 2017 and 2019 (254,000) were the lowest since 2004 (237,400), and dropped significantly further in 2020 (206,000).\n\nNotes:\n\n\n"}

It arises in the numerical analysis of explicit time integration schemes, when these are used for the numerical solution. As a consequence, the time step must be less than a certain time in many explicit time-marching computer simulations, otherwise the simulation produces incorrect results. The condition is named after Richard Courant, Kurt Friedrichs, and Hans Lewy who described it in their 1928 paper.\n\nThe principle behind the condition is that, for example, if a wave is moving across a discrete spatial grid and we want to compute its amplitude at discrete time steps of equal duration, then this duration must be less than the time for the wave to travel to adjacent grid points. As a corollary, when the grid point separation is reduced, the upper limit for the time step also decreases. In essence, the numerical domain of dependence of any point in space and time (as determined by initial conditions and the parameters of the approximation scheme) must include the analytical domain of dependence (wherein the initial conditions have an effect on the exact value of the solution at that point) to assure that the scheme can access the information required to form the solution.\n\nTo make a reasonably formally precise statement of the condition, it is necessary to define the following quantities:\nThe spatial coordinates and the time are discrete-valued independent variables, which are placed at regular distances called the \"interval length\" and the \"time step\", respectively. Using these names, the CFL condition relates the length of the time step to a function of the interval lengths of each spatial coordinate and of the maximum speed that information can travel in the physical space.\n\nOperatively, the CFL condition is commonly prescribed for those terms of the finite-difference approximation of general partial differential equations that model the advection phenomenon.\n\nFor one-dimensional case, the CFL has the following form:\n\nwhere the dimensionless number formula_6 is called the Courant number,\n\n\nThe value of formula_10 changes with the method used to solve the discretised equation, especially depending on whether the method is explicit or implicit. If an explicit (time-marching) solver is used then typically formula_11. Implicit (matrix) solvers are usually less sensitive to numerical instability and so larger values of formula_10 may be tolerated.\n\nIn the two-dimensional case, the CFL condition becomes\n\nwith the obvious meanings of the symbols involved. By analogy with the two-dimensional case, the general CFL condition for the formula_1-dimensional case is the following one:\n\nThe interval length is not required to be the same for each spatial variable formula_16. This \"degree of freedom\" can be used to somewhat optimize the value of the time step for a particular problem, by varying the values of the different interval to keep it not too small.\n\n\n"}

Its editors claim that the paper, published on-and-off in one form or another since 1756, is the oldest newspaper in the United States and has trademarked the phrase \"The Nation's Oldest Newspaper.\"\n\n\"The New Hampshire Gazette\" was founded in Portsmouth on October 7, 1756, by printer Daniel Fowle as the first newspaper in the Province of New Hampshire. Fowle lived in Boston before founding the \"Gazette,\" and was the first to print the words of Samuel Adams. He also spent time in prison for printing anti-British pamphlets \"The Monster of Monsters\" and \"A Total Eclipse of Liberty.\"\n\nThe \"Gazette\" continued publishing after Fowle's death in 1787, and in 1839, was recognized as the oldest newspaper in America after the \"Maryland Gazette\" ceased publication. Starting in the 1890s, the Gazette was published by \"The Portsmouth Herald\" on weekends as a supplement to the \"Herald\". In 1960, the \"Gazette\" was renamed the \"Herald Weekend Edition\", although the masthead indicated that the paper was \"Continuing the New Hampshire Gazette.\"\n\nDuring the American Revolution it published a eulogy, dated Epsom, July 1775, to Andrew McClary, who died during the Battle of Bunker Hill. It read: \"The Major discovered great intrepidity and presence of mind in the action, and his noble soul glowed with ardor and the love of his country . . .\"\n\nIn 1989, a descendant of Daniel Fowle's, Steven Fowle, discovered that the \"Herald\" relinquished the trade name for the \"Gazette\". Fowle registered the rights to the name and that spring began publishing the \"Gazette\" as an independent entity \"episodically, in a very small format\" until May 1, 1999, when the publishers began its current format and schedule.\n\nThe \"Hartford Courant\", founded as a weekly in 1764, calls itself the nation's oldest continuously published newspaper, and is cited as such in standard journalism history texts. It was an independent company until being absorbed by the Times Mirror chain in 1979, then Tribune Corporation acquired Times Mirror. In contrast, the \"New Hampshire Gazette\" has changed owners \"over two-dozen times\", by its owner's count, and has sometimes been merged with other publications.\n\nThe \"Newport Mercury\" in Rhode Island was identified as the nation's oldest newspaper during one of the \"New Hampshire Gazette\"s lulls. It was founded in 1758. The \"Mercury\" eventually was published by \"The Newport Daily News\" as a weekly by-mail edition, reprinting stories from the daily for out-of-town subscribers. Most recently, it became a tabloid magazine and web site using the addess newportmercury.com but also using the name \"Mercury Magazine\".\n\nThe \"Gazette\", as an alternative paper, is more focused on commentary than the reporting of current events. Its editorial content can easily be described as \"liberal\". In recent years the paper has cemented its self-imposed mission as an independent voice railing against corporate media and conservative political control.\n\nPublished every two weeks as a smaller format broadsheet, usually of 14–20 pages, the \"Gazette's\" front page is usually an editorial called \"The Fortnightly Rant\", covering a few subjects of national or regional importance, accompanied by a political cartoon by Mike Dater reflecting the editorial. The motto of the newspaper is the motto of the state of New Hampshire, \"Live free or die\".\n\nAmong articles of varying size and content are regular columns such as \"Moving Pictures\" (film commentary) by Rodman Philbrick and most notedly a regular essay, \"History Matters,\" covering two pages or more by Portsmouth historian J. Dennis Robinson. Other regular features include \"Hate Mail, Mash Notes, & Other Correspondence\" (the letters page), the \"Northcountry Chronicle\", an editorial by William Marvel, \"Free the Media Press\" (stories culled from the New Hampshire Indymedia Collective), and a reprinting of \"Vintage News\" from past issues of the \"Gazette\" usually dating to the mid-19th century. (\"Better old news, than new lies.\") The most popular section of the newspaper is \"Admiral Fowle's Piscataqua River Tidal Guide\" on the last page which, in addition to a chronology of the tides to take place over each day of the upcoming two weeks, contains an idiosyncratic, and often hilarious listing of significant events from that day in history.\n\nThe paper's circulation, at over 5,500 readers, is relatively small, but as it is a non-profit independent paper with no marketing, it can be considered a significant number. Its readership is also very loyal, with nearly 1,000 mail subscribers throughout the country.\n\nFor many years, the website for the \"Gazette\" had many resources in relation to its history, including a 19th-century reproduction of its first issue, a timeline and explanation of its position as oldest newspaper, and much more. Beginning the summer of 2007, the website changed focus and format to that of a blog-type website. Content from each issue of the paper is minimal in comparison with how most newspapers publish articles online as well as in print, though the \"Gazette\" occasionally does offer a .pdf of an issue, usually a couple of weeks after its publication.\n\n"}

The garden was designed by landscape designer Elsie Cornish (1887-1946), and the statue created by Ola Cohn was unveiled by Lady Muriel Barclay-Harvey (the wife of the Governor of South Australia, Sir Malcolm Barclay-Harvey) on 19 April 1941.\n\nThe main entrance is located off King William Road opposite the Adelaide Festival Centre, between the Torrens Parade Ground on the north side and the rear of Government House on the south. The shady garden and surrounding lawned areas are used for quiet recreation throughout the year, and for a week each March becomes a hive of activity when the Adelaide Festival presents the Adelaide Writers' Week there.\n\nThe garden was proposed in May 1938 by the Pioneer Women's Memorial Trust of South Australia. Two representatives of this organisation, Miss Phebe Watson and Chair of the Trust Adelaide Miethke, approached the City of Adelaide's Town Clerk, W. C. D. Veale, to create a 'garden of memory'. It is claimed that the garden was modelled on the Pioneer Women's Memorial Garden in Melbourne, which had been opened in 1935.\n\nIn the proposal Watson wrote:\n\"With the approval of and consent of the Adelaide City Council, we desire to lay down a formal garden, with a sundial and figure as its central unit (to denote the passing of time) within the base of which will be placed a casket containing the records of the first centenary celebration. Our proposal is for a garden approximately 120 feet [36.5 m] by 80 feet [24 m], surrounded by a dwarfbrick wall, with long central pathway of brick leading up three short steps to the sundial ...\nGarden beds are provided as in the accompanying sketch, shrubs and ornamental trees as jacaranda and flame tree, against a background of golden poplars ...\nMiss Elsie Cornish is our adviser, and the sketch submitted is, of course, capable of modification.\"\n\nThe area behind Government House in Adelaide was proposed, with site and garden proposals being taken up in 1938.\n\nCornish and the Trust argued with the Adelaide City Council over design issues through to late 1939 with Trust Chair Miethke writing to the Council in support of Cornish during this time. The garden was eventually developed to Cornish's design, with her planting the original species and herself erecting the low brick wall.\n\nThe design of the garden is a simple rectangle with a low decorative brick wall. At the centre of the garden is Cohn's sculpture of a female figure, raised on a plinth. This is surrounded by green lawns, and four garden beds with ornamental trees and shrubs at the edges.\n\nCornish's choice of plants was influenced by their symbolic meanings, selecting five \"Populus nigra \"Italica\"\" (Lombardy poplars) to represent the five women of the Pioneer Women’s Memorial Trust; \"Quercus ilex\" (holly oak) and \"Myrtus communis\" (myrtle) for protection and love; \"Lonicera\" (honeysuckle) for love, generosity and devotion; and \"Syringa vulgaris\" (lilac) to symbolize memory, protection, youth and tenderness. Here the designer carefully selected plants for their metaphorical meanings.\n\nOriginal plans for the garden included the use of a 'floral clock', that would represent the passage of time; however this idea was rejected on the grounds that it would require too much maintenance.\n\nFour park benches face the garden from the west, commemorating the following women:\n\nCarol Rowntree\n20.07.55 - 15.09.02\n\"Passionate about People, Books and Justice\"\n\nElizabeth Webb Nicholls\n21.02.1850 - 03.08.1943\n\"Suffragette, social reformer, and for many years the leader of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union of South Australia and Australia\"\n\nColonel Sybil Irving, M.B.E.\n\"Controller A.W.A.S. 1941-1946\"\n\"Honorary Colonel, W.R.A.A.C. 1956-1961\"\n\nCatherine Jean Cleave\n09.02.1980 - 27.08.1998\n\"A caring and joyful spirit who made a difference\"\n\nA large memorial also stands on the rise by King William Street, by the path beginning the war memorial walk between King William Street and Kintore Avenue.

{"id": "2029981", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2029981", "title": "Rasgulla", "text": "Rasgulla\n\nRasgulla is an Indian syrupy dessert popular in the Indian subcontinent and regions with South Asian diaspora. It is made from ball-shaped dumplings of chhena (an Indian cottage cheese) and semolina dough, cooked in light syrup made of sugar. This is done until the syrup permeates the dumplings.\n\nThe dish originated in East India; the present-day states of Odisha and West Bengal have variously claimed to be its birthplace. In 2015, a committee formed by the government of Odisha asserted that the sweet had originated in Odisha, where it is offered at the Puri Jagannath Temple. In 2016, the West Bengal government applied for a Geographical Indications (GI) tag for the variant called \"Banglar Rosogolla\" (Bengali Rasgulla), clarifying that the Bengal and Odisha variants were different in \"both in colour, texture, taste, juice content and method of manufacturing.\"\n\nIn 2017, when West Bengal got its Rosogolla's GI status, the Registry office of India clarified that West Bengal was given GI status for Banglar Rosogolla and Odisha can claim it too if they site the place of origin of their variant along with colour, texture, taste, juice content and method of manufacturing.\n\nIn 2018, Odisha government applied for GI status for \"Odisha Rasagola\" (Odia Rasgulla), which got approved by GI Registry of India and subsequently Odisha got its own Rasagola's GI status on 29 July 2019.\n\nThe dessert is known as Rasagola in Odia, and Rosogolla or Roshogolla in Bengali. Rasgulla is derived from the words \"ras\" (\"juice\") and \"gulla\" (\"ball\"). Other names for the dish include Roshgulla (Sylheti), Rasagulla, Rossogolla, Roshogolla, Rasagola, Rasagolla, and Rasbhari or Rasbari (Nepali).\n\nAccording to historians of Odisha, the rasgulla originated in Puri, as \"khira mohana\", which later evolved into the Pahala rasgulla. It has been traditionally offered as \"bhog\" to goddess Lakshmi at Jagannath Temple, Puri. According to the local legend, Laxmi gets upset because her husband Lord Jagannath goes on a 9-day sojourn (the \"ratha yatra\") without her consent. So, she locks \"Jai Vijay Dwar\", one of the temple gates and prevents his convoy from re-entering the sanctum sanctorum of the temple. To appease her, Jagannath offers her rasgullas. This ritual, known as \"Bachanika\", is part of the \"Niladri Bije\" (or \"Arrival of the God\") observance, which marks the return of the deities to the temple after the Ratha Yatra.\n\nThe Jagannath Temple scholars such as Laxmidhar Pujapanda and researchers like Jagabandhu Padhi state that the tradition has existed since the 12th century, when the present-day temple structure was first built. Pujapanda states that the Niladri Bije tradition is mentioned in \"Niladri Mahodaya\", which is dated to the 18th century by Sarat Chandra Mahapatra. According to Mahapatra, several temple scriptures, which are over 300 years old, provide the evidence of rasgulla offering ritual in Puri.\n\nAccording to folklore, Pahala (a village on the outskirts of Odisha's capital Bhubaneshwar) had a large number of cows. The village would produce excess milk, and the villagers would throw it away when it became spoilt. When a priest from the Jagannath Temple saw this, he taught them the art of curdling, including the recipe for rasagulla. Pahala thus went on to become the biggest market for chhena-based sweets in the area.\n\nAccording to the Bengali culinary historian Pritha Sen, in the mid-18th century, many Odia cooks were employed in Bengali homes who arguably have introduced Rasgulla along with many other Odia dishes. According to another theory, it is possible that the Bengali visitors to Puri might have carried the recipe for rasgulla back to Bengal in the nineteenth century.\n\nThis claim is contested by Bengali historians. According to food historians K. T. Achaya and Chitra Banerji, there are no references to cheese (including chhena) in India before the 17th century. The milk-based sweets were mainly made up of khoa, before the Portuguese influence led to introduction of cheese-based sweets. Therefore, the possibility of a cheese-based dish being offered at Jagannath Temple in the 12th century is highly unlikely. According to Nobin Chandra Das' descendant Animikh Roy and historian Haripada Bhowmik, rasgulla is not even mentioned as one of the \"chhappan bhog\" (\"56 offerings\") in the early records of the Temple; the name of the sweet was coined in Bengal. They also state that it would have been a blasphemy to offer something made from spoiled milk (chhena) to a deity. However, Michael Krondl argues that Hindu dietary rules vary from region to region, and it is possible that this restriction did not exist in present-day Odisha.\n\nAccording to Asit Mohanty, an Odia research scholar on Jagannath cult and traditions, the sweet is mentioned as \"Rasagola\" in the 15th century text \"Jagamohana Ramayana\" of Balaram Das. The text mentions Rasagola, along with other sweets found in Odisha. There is also mention of many other cheese made sweets like \"Chhenapuri\", \"Chhenaladu\" and \"Rasabali\". Another ancient text \"Premapanchamruta\" of Bhupati also mentions cheese (Chhena). It is being argued that cheese making process was well known before coming of Portuguese in Odisha.\n\nThe spongy white rasgulla is believed to have been introduced in present-day West Bengal in 1868 by a Kolkata-based confectioner named Nobin Chandra Das. Das started making rasgulla by processing the mixture of chhena and semolina in boiling sugar syrup in contrast to the mixture sans semolina in the original rasgulla in his sweet shop located at Sutanuti (present-day Baghbazar). His descendants claim that his recipe was an original, but according to another theory, he modified the traditional Odisha rasgulla recipe to produce this less perishable variant.\n\nYet another theory is that rasgulla was first prepared by someone else in Bengal, and Das only popularized it. In \"Banglar Khabar\" (1987), food historian Pranab Ray states that a man named Braja Moira had introduced rasgulla in his shop near Calcutta High Court in 1866, two years before Das started selling the dish. In 1906, Panchana Bandopadhyay wrote that rasgullla was invented in the 19th century by Haradhan Moira, a Phulia-based sweetmaker who worked for the Pal Chowdhurys of Ranaghat. According to \"Mistikatha\", a newspaper published by West Bengal Sweetmeat Traders Association, many other people prepared similar sweets under different names such as \"gopalgolla\" (prepared by Gopal Moira of Burdwan district), \"jatingolla\", \"bhabanigolla\" and \"rasugolla\". Food historian Michael Krondl states that irrespective of its origin, the rasgulla likely predates Nobin Chandra Das. A sales brochure of the company run by Das' descendants also hints at this: \"it is hard to tell whether or not cruder versions of similar sweets existed anywhere at that time. Even if they did, they did not match the quality of Nobin Chandra, and having failed to excite the Bengali palate, they slipped into oblivion.\"\n\nBhagwandas Bagla, a Marwari businessman and a customer of Nobin Chandra Das, popularized the Bengali rasgulla beyond the shop's locality by ordering huge amounts.\n\nPortuguese made sweet cheese and sandesh from milk in sixth century. Bangalee wives then improvised the formula. Late veteran recipe writer and food connoisseur Shawkat Osman told BBC Bangla that Nobin Chandra Das, the maker of Rasgulla, is a man from Barisal and lived near Patuakhali. It is beleived that the main origin is formulated in Bangladesh and then popular in Kolkata.\n\nIn 1930, the introduction of vacuum packing by Nobin Chandra's son Krishna Chandra Das led to the availability of canned Rasgullas, which made the dessert popular outside Kolkata, and subsequently, outside India. Krishna Chandra's son Sarada Charan Das established the K.C. Das Pvt Ltd company in 1946. Sarada Charan's younger, estranged son Debendra Nath established K.C. Das Grandsons in 1956.\n\nToday, canned rasgullas are available throughout India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, as well as in South Asian grocery stores outside the subcontinent. In Nepal, Rasgulla became popular under the name \"Rasbari\".\n\nThe Indian space agency, ISRO is developing dehydrated rasgullas and other dishes for Indian astronauts in its planned manned missions. \n\nIn 2015, the Odisha government initiated a move to get Geographical indication (GI) status for the rasagulla made in Pahala. On 30 July, the people of Odisha celebrated \"Rasagola Dibasa\" (\"Rasgulla Day\") to reaffirm Odisha as the place of the dish's origin. In August, West Bengal decided to legally contest Odisha's move to obtain GI Status. In 2015 The odisha state government constituted three committees to claim over the Rasgulla . The committees submitted their interim report to the government. Noted journalist and food researcher Bhakta Tripathy and a member of the committee had submitted dossier containing historical evidence of Rasgulla origin in Odisha. The Science and Technology department of the West Bengal government also started the process to get its own GI status for the dessert.\n\nOn 30 July 2015, on the day of \"Niladri Bije\", a social media campaign was started by using a hashtag #RasagolaDibasa and it later became a mainstream celebration as the maiden day to celebrate Rasgulla's origin to be Odisha. Odia newspaper Sambad and FM radio Radio Choklate in collaboration with the confectioners of Pahala celebrated a rasgulla exhibition-cum-awareness event in Bhubaneswar. Sand artist Sudarshan Patnaik made a sand sculpture in Puri Beach depicting \"Niladri Bije\" and Jagannath offering rasgulla to Lakshmi.\n\nIt has been agreed upon to celebrate the Rasagola Dibasa every year on the tithi of Niladri Bije in the lunar calendar. In the year 2016, the Rasagola Dibasa has been celebrated on 17 July.\n\nTo prepare rasgulla, the cheese (chhena) mixture is formed into small balls. These balls are then simmered in a sugar syrup. It can also be prepared using a pressure cooker or an oven. While serving add a drop of rose water (only organic and edible type of rose water, not rose perfume or synthetic flavors) to enhance the flavor and taste.\n\nThe \"Pahal Rasagola\" from the Pahala area (located between the cities of Bhubaneswar and Cuttack) is also popular in India.\n\nAlong with chhena gaja and chhena poda, Rasgulla is one of three traditional Odia chhena desserts. Due to rasgulla becoming associated with the Bengali cuisine, the Odisha Milk Federation has tried to popularize chhena poda as the signature Odia dessert.\n\nTypically, a 100-gram serving of rasgulla contains 186 calories, out of which about 153 calories are in the form of carbohydrates. It also contains about 1.85 grams of fat and 4 grams of protein.\n\nIn 2015, West Bengal applied for a Geographical Indication (GI) status for \"Banglar Rasogolla\" (Bengali Rasgulla). The Government clarified that there was no conflict with Odisha, and its application was only for a specific variant which was different in \"both in colour, texture, taste, juice content and method of manufacturing\" from the variant produced in Odisha. On 14 November 2017, the GI Registry of India granted West Bengal the GI status for Banglar Rasogolla.\n\nThe GI Registrar office at Chennai later specifically clarified that West Bengal was given GI status only for the Bengali version of Rasgulla (\"Banglar Rasogolla\"), not for the sweet's origin. The office also stated that Odisha had not by then applied for any GI tag, but it could also get Odisha Rasgulla's GI tag by presenting the necessary evidence. \n\nIn 2018 Odisha had applied for GI status in Chennai GI Registry. On 29 July 2019 the GI Registry of India granted Odisha the GI status for Odisha Rasagola. \n"}

Always forward looking, in 1978 Mason created plans for a fifty-home community of solar-powered houses in Columbia, Maryland, that was to be called \"Solar Village\". Mason invented architronics, which was exemplified in his Xanadu homes. Mason was a founding member of the World Future Society, the publisher of Futurist Magazine. He also co-designed their first logo. In the 1980s Mason was the architecture editor of the \"Futurist\" magazine. He was also the first executive director of the Home Automation Association.\n\nMason was very interested in modern education. He designed a sprayed foam building for an experimental college called College of the Potomac in Paris, Virginia, in 1971. He also donated his time and talents to the Capital Children's Museum in Washington, D.C., where he created several forward-looking exhibits.\n\nMason worked and lived most of his life in and around Washington, D.C. In 1996, at age 57, he was killed by a man named Christopher Robin Hatton at the architect's home in the 4200 block of Military Road NW. Christopher Hatton, in a drug-induced rage and demanding money from Mason, bludgeoned Mason with a hammer twenty-five times (per the autopsy). Christopher Robin Hatton was sentenced to fourteen years for the murder of Roy Mason. \nMason's lover of many years, Brian Carneal, had died a year earlier of complications related to HIV. When Mason wasn't in Washington, D.C., he and Carneal resided in Delaware at their Dupont Estate.\n\nBefore entering his career of architecture and design, Mason received a master's degree from the Yale University School of Architecture. Mason was interested in futuristic homes that use alternative materials which make it easier to build homes and more affordable. Mason also favored the concept of computer automated homes which he demonstrated in his Xanadu homes with Bob Masters.\n\nDuring the mid 1980s the Bell System was being organized for a breakup into 7 Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs), also known as \"Baby Bells\". A new company, Arlington-based Intelligent Building Information Systems (iBis) was formed by entrepreneur Tom Colligan whose telecom career included a brief stint with United Technologies' intelligent building endeavor. His vision was to create a hub and spoke network of office building complexes that not only took advantage of new telecom network technologies but incorporated central computer efficiency within the building's or office park's infrastructure. Those elements included HVAC environmental systems, elevator controls, fire and safety and security systems. The term Shared Tenant Services was also introduced to help lure tenants into an infrastructure that would allow central computing and communications into the formula. À la carte phone charges and PBXs were expensive business charges at the time and PCs were just being introduced at that time.\n\nAn article in MIS Week and the Washington Post gained the attention of Roy Mason. Roy and Tom shared futuristic visions that would someday include intelligent homes. Roy was immediately enveloped into the strategic business plan process and lent his experience to iBis' corporate resume. He became a spokesman for the company, often holding seminars for contractor/developers interested in offering services beyond the brick and mortar.\n\nIn 1984, iBis signed a contract with NYNEX (now Verizon) to offer tenant network services nationwide. The contract included network switches and a national sales campaign plus $10 million in startup cash for iBis. Nine months later, the 1984 Modified Final Judgement by Judge Green disallowed the newly formed RBOCs to offer voice and data services. The NYNEX contract was nullified immediately, leaving little time to find a backup investor.

C-E was a multi-national American-based engineering firm and a leader in the development of both fossil and nuclear steam supply power systems in the United States with approximately 42,000 employees worldwide. Originally headquartered in New York City, C-E moved its corporate offices to Stamford, Connecticut in 1973. C-E owned over three dozen other companies including Lummus Company, National Tank Company and the Morgan Door Company. Former workers have gone on to hold leadership positions in major engineering firms and governments around the world. The company was acquired by Asea Brown Boveri in early 1990. The boiler and fossil fuel businesses were purchased by Alstom in 2000, and the nuclear business was purchased by Westinghouse Electric Company also in 2000.\n\nCombustion Engineering was organized in 1912 through the merger of the Grieve Grate Company and the American Stoker Company, two well-known manufacturers of fuel burning equipment. The company was originally headquartered on 11 Broadway and at 43 \"-\" 5 \"-\" 7 Broad Street (Manhattan), both in Lower Manhattan.\nThe city block was leased from the Alliance Realty Company in April 1920. In May of the same year the firm began construction of an eight-story office building on the same site.\n\nDuring the 1920s, C-E's signature boiler equipment was the English designed Type-E stoker. C-E also offered several other types of underfeed stokers in addition to the Type-E. During the 1920s, all of C-E's stokers were fabricated in manufacturing plants along the Monongahela River south of Pittsburgh.\n\nIn 1925 C-E entered the steam boiler business, beginning with a steam boiler installed at the Ford Motor Company's River Rouge Plant in Dearborn, MI. C-E also acquired two boiler companies in Chattanooga, TN to augment its manufacturing capabilities. \n\nIn the 1970s C-E acquired the first 'Recycling Wire Granulation System' from a young entrepreneur/inventor and metallurgical engineer by the name of Charles Victor Paul Balo. The recycling wire granulation system was a large piece of machinery that took scrap wire from the phone companies and electric companies and extracted the alloy from the plastic or rubber coating quickly and automatically, separating the dross. The stripped alloy would go into a containment device and the dross would go into another. Both to be recycled, therefore avoiding the rapidly overflowing landfills.\n\nDuring the Great Depression, C-E formed a partnership with the Superheater Company. The Locomotive Superheater Company was founded in 1910 to further the use of superheated steam in locomotives. The Superheater Company's primary manufacturing facility was located in East Chicago, Indiana.\nIn December 1948 stockholders approved a merger between the Combustion Engineering Company and Superheater Company. Following consolidation the corporation was called Combustion Engineering-Superheater Inc. In September 1950 the firm announced plans to build a large high-pressure generating unit for Virginia Electric & Power Company in Chester, Virginia.\n\nIn 1953, the name Superheater was eliminated and the company took the more familiar name - Combustion Engineering, Inc. At this time, C-E primarily designed and built boiler assemblies for conventional power plants; those powered by coal and oil.\n\nIn the mid-1950s, C-E also expanded its operations into oil and gas exploration, production, refining, and petrochemicals with the acquisition of the Lummus Company located in Bloomfield, New Jersey. Lummus also supplied small industrial steam supply systems for oil field enhanced recovery.\n\nC-E was one of the major suppliers of boilers for US Navy steam-powered warships, including Liberty ships during World War II. Amongst many other warships, all of the 46 s built during the 1960s and 1970s were equipped with a C-E power plant.\n\nC-E also was a leader in the development of large coal utility steam supply systems which were used worldwide. C-E pioneered the tangential firing process used in modern large pulverized coal utility boilers. C-E maintained a large coal burning test unit at the Windsor, Connecticut site which allowed the Power Systems Group to test changes to boiler air-flow and other critical boiler design factors.\n\nC-E's nuclear power activity began in 1955 under Arthur Santry Jr. The history of the C-E Windsor, Connecticut campus dates to the early development of the nuclear submarine. From the mid-1950s through the early 1960s, Combustion Engineering, under federal government contract, produced nuclear fuel for the US Navy's \"Nuclear Navy\" nuclear submarines. Also located at the Windsor site was the prototype marine nuclear propulsion training facility known as S1C, which was designed and constructed by C-E adjacent to its main campus. The S1C prototype was operated by C-E for more than ten years as an R&D and Naval training facility. After expiration of C-E's contract, the S1C contract was subsequently awarded to Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory (KAPL), who operated the unit until its decommissioning and dismantlement in the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nIn the 1960s, C-E began selling nuclear power steam supply systems. The first commercial nuclear steam supply system was sold to Consumers Power Company of Michigan for the Palisades Nuclear Generating Station, which is still in operation (though scheduled to shut down permanently in 2022). C-E competed aggressively with General Electric and Westinghouse in this domain.\n\nIn the late 1960s the company supplied nuclear reactor systems and fabricated uranium fuel for electric utility companies. A joint venture was announced in April 1968, involving the Combustion Engineering Company, Houston Natural Gas, and Ranchers Exploration & Development Corporation. The three businesses combined to search for uranium on in New Mexico.\n\nC-E was generally credited with a superior design, evidenced by the fact that the megawatt yield of its nuclear reactors was typically about 10% higher than that of comparable Westinghouse plants. The basis for this increase in efficiency was a computer-based system called the Core Operating Limit Supervisory System (COLSS) for design, and the Core Protection Calculator (CPC) for real-time control room operation, which leveraged almost 300 in-core neutron detectors and a patented algorithm to allow higher power densities. Combustion also fabricated a number of the Westinghouse reactor vessels and steam generators at its Chattanooga manufacturing facility under contracts with the Westinghouse company.\n\nC-E maintained a sophisticated nuclear reactor operator training simulator at the Windsor facility for support for customers of its nuclear steam supply systems.\n\nIn the 1960s, and continuing through 1988, C-E acquired a number of companies, many not directly related to the core utility steam supply business. As a result, the company structure evolved so that it had five and later six major business groups or divisions. C-E Power Systems comprised the original utility steam supply components, C-E Industrial Group, C-E Lummus & Engineering Services Group, C-E Refractories & Minerals Group, C-E Oil & Gas Group, and last C-E Instrumentation & Controls Group were formed to provide management focus as the company and its products base expanded. The Power Systems Division included the original major manufacturing facilities at Chattanooga, St. Louis, Monongahela, Birmingham; and in Canada, Brantford, Cornwall, and Upper Canada Manufacturing. A number of companies were acquired or developed and added to the division including, American Pole Structures, C-E Controls, the P.F. Avery Co., C-E Impel, C-E Maguire (Charles A. Maguire & Associates) and C-E Metals (primarily a specialty scrap metal operation in Chattanooga); and was basically divided into three major sub-groups: Fossil, Nuclear, and Services (which included field erection, aftermarket spare parts, and engineering services). The Industrial Group included C-E Industrial Boiler (part of the original base of CE in East Chicago, IN and Detroit & Saginaw, MI), C-E Bauer (Pulp & Paper Equipment), C-E Raymond (Crushing and Conveying Equipment), C-E Air Preheater (Ljungström® technology), C-E Tyler Screening (Industrial Wire Screens), C-E Ehrsham (Conveyors & Grain Elevators). C-E Enterprise Manufacturing, C-E Tyler Elevator, CERREY, and other industrial supply companies. The Oil & Gas Group included such companies as C-E Natco, C-E Grey Tool, Beaumont Well Works, C-E Vetco, OilField Engineering, C-E Houston Forging, etc. The Refractories & Minerals Group included C-E Minerals, C-E Refractories, C-E Cast Industrial Products, C-E Building Products (C-E Aluminum Building Products, C-E Morgan, C-E Stanley Artex), Georgia Kaolin, Pryor-Giggey, C-E Transport, C-E Glass, C-E Hordis Bros. Glass, etc. The Instrumentation & Controls group included C-E Taylor Instruments, C-E Resource Recovery Systems, C-E Process Analytics (acquired from Bendix), et al. Each group had a separate headquarters and support staff which coordinated each group's companies actions with the C-E Corporate support functions of Administration, Information Systems, Insurance, Treasury, Accounting, Audit, and Personnel.\n\nC-E had a large presence in Canada, including fossil and nuclear steam supply manufacturing facilities. A number of the Industrial Group companies had manufacturing facilities there as well, primarily located in the province of Ontario. The Oil & Gas Group had operations in the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. C-E maintained offices as well as a number of manufacturing sites on a worldwide basis, including the UK, Ireland, Austria, Germany, Italy, South Africa, Belgium, Mexico and France. C-E's technology on a wide range of products was licensed worldwide.\n\nFor much of the existence of the company, the Santry family controlled the management of C-E. Joseph Santry was President of the company until 1963. Arthur Santry, Jr., Joseph's nephew, was named President in 1963 and Chairman of the C-E Board of Directors in 1982 and held both titles until he resigned his post as President in 1984. He remained as Chairman until 1988. Charles Hugel was named President of C-E in 1984 and remained in that position until 1988 when he succeeded Mr. Santry as Chairman of the Board. George Kimmel was named President and Chief Operating Officer in 1988 and remained in that position until the sale of the company to ABB in 1990.\n\nIn 1990 C-E became a wholly owned subsidiary of Asea Brown Boveri (ABB), a Swiss-Swedish multinational conglomerate based in Zurich and one of the largest electrical engineering companies in the world.\n\nC-E's financial debt and lingering asbestos liability brought ABB to the brink of bankruptcy in the early 2000s. ABB was able to resolve asbestos claims filed against Combustion Engineering and Lummus Global in 2006 with a billion-plus dollar settlement agreement.\n\nABB and Alstom merged their power groups in 1999 creating a 50/50 joint venture, ABB-Alstom Power. In 2000, Alstom bought out ABB.\n\nIn 2001, the nuclear steam supply system vendor portion of the company, operating as Combustion Engineering, was bought by Westinghouse Electric Co., a then subsidiary of British Nuclear Fuels.\n\nNovember 2, 2015 GE Power announced it had completed the acquisition of Alstom's power and grid businesses.\n\n"}

{"id": "2030012", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2030012", "title": "Brewer (John Updike)", "text": "Brewer (John Updike)\n\nBrewer, Pennsylvania is a fictional city that serves as the major setting for American writer John Updike's \"Rabbit\" cycle of novels (comprising \"Rabbit, Run\", \"Rabbit Redux\", \"Rabbit Is Rich\", \"Rabbit at Rest\", and \"Rabbit Remembered\", two of which won Pulitzer Prizes for Updike). It is the center of the only fictional universe which Updike developed across multiple works, and symbolically represents his assessment of American culture from 1959 to 1999.\n\nBrewer is described as being the \"fifth largest city in Pennsylvania\", and seems to have many characteristics in common with the real-life city of Reading, Pennsylvania, but is in fact a composite of many places. Brewer is large enough to have a daily newspaper as well as a weekly, the \"Brewer Vat\", printed by the company where Rabbit works as a linotypist in \"Rabbit Redux\", and a fairly well-defined social and class structure. It also has a cinema multiplex, which Updike uses as a device to define the era in which each novel is set by frequently listing which films are playing there. Rabbit eventually comes to head the city's Toyota car dealership, inherited by his wife from her father. Brewer is called the \"flowerpot city\" due to its extensive use of red brick. Updike, a Pennsylvania native, set much of his fiction in the state, largely in Brewer and in the much smaller rural town of Olinger. The novels also include a settling called Mt. Judge, a suburb of Brewer modeled after the real-life Mt. Penn, Pennsylvania.\n\nBrewer represents a typical middle-class American town, one that scholar Laurence W. Mazzeno describes as an \"all-American city\". Writer and literature professor Erik Kielland-Lund wrote that Brewer is used to depict \"details of the American urban scene\" and the \"landscapes of contemporary America\". Brewer at times serves as a representation of American capitalism and commercial materialism, or what writer Peter J. Bailey describes as \"an omnipresence of commodities and pop culture creates a pervasive aura of oppressively banal, soulless materialism.\"\n\nBrewer reflects all the changes that occur in American society from 1959 to the 1980s and beyond. This included changes in once long-standing institutions, as Brewer's church and ministers become more socialized. Other changes in American society are reflected in Brewer, such as altering family patterns, with an increase in divorce, working mothers, and family counseling, as well as the rise of new classes and groups such as African Americans, Latinos, women, gay men and women, and white-collar workers. These changes also extend to entertainment, leisure, and sports: country clubs become more prevalent, characters go on vacation more frequently or retire to Florida, and golf becomes accessible to the middle class. Brewer also grows seedier over time, as reflected by increases in recreational drugs, riots, and white-collar crime, as well as formerly luxurious movie theaters gradually becoming pornographic theaters. By the novel \"Rabbit Is Rich\", Brewer has changed so much that protagonist Harry Angstrom begins to feel few connections to the city anymore; as Bailey writes, Angstrom feels \"no remaining link to a world of cultural difference and personal growth\".\n\nBrewer experiences an economic decline over time, serving at times as a center of racial unrest and urban blight. Both declining and emerging businesses are depicted as the city's economy changes and evolves, particularly in its portrayal of linotyping giving way to printed technology. High-tech industries and upscale housing developments are welcomed as the city's economy changes. These changes inspire mixed emotions, with Kielland-Lund describing Brewer as prompting \"nostalgic longing for a vanishing pastoral ideal and grudging acceptance of the potential beauty of the cold and metallic urban landscape\". One passage in \"Rabbit Run\" describes the city as a \"treeless waste of industry, shoe factories and bottling plants and company parking lots and knitting mills converted to electronics parts and elephantine gas tanks lifting above trash-filled swampland\". \"Rabbit Redux\" describes the city's attempts to revive its fledgling downtown neighborhood, tearing away entire blocks of buildings to create parking lots and exposing church facades. The novel describes this development in stark terms, describing the result as \"generating new perspectives of rear entryways and half-alleys and intensifying the cruel breadth of light\".\n\nBrewer often serves as a symbol and embodiment of the various states of mind Angstrom experiences throughout the course of the \"Rabbit\" novels. For example, in \"Rabbit Redux\", Angstrom's isolation and feelings of being trapped are reflected in the book's description of Brewer as a \"stagnant city\" and a wasteland characterized by a \"desolate openness\", as well as his home as a \"spacecraft\" floating through a monotonous setting filled with uncaring residents. Likewise, in \"Rabbit at Rest\", in which Angstrom's health is on the decline, Brewer is described as a city of decline and decay, its diminishing, with what Mazzeno describes as a \"diminished virility\" that matches that of Angstrom himself. Conversely, after Angstrom survives a heart attack in \"Rabbit at Rest\", he views Brewer with a renewed sense of optimism and beauty: at one point, he travels through a tunnel of Bradford pear trees and describes it as if it is heaven. Similarly, in one passage of \"Rabbit, Run\", Brewer serves as what the narrative describes as \"shelter of love\" and \"return to security\" for Angstrom even as he experiences an existential crisis. Members of Angstrom's family experience similar mixed feelings about Brewer; for Harry's son Nelson, Brewer is a \"home that has simultaneously nurtured and stifled him\", according to Bailey.\n\n"}

Carr performed and recorded with the Rendell-Carr quintet and jazz-rock band Nucleus, and was an associate professor at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London. He also wrote biographies of musicians Keith Jarrett and Miles Davis.\n\nCarr was born in Dumfries, Scotland, the elder brother of Mike Carr. From 1952 to 1956, he attended King's College, now Newcastle University, where he read English Literature, followed by a diploma in education.\n\nAt the age of 17 Carr started to teach himself trumpet. After university he joined his brother in a Newcastle band, the EmCee Five, from 1960 to 1962, before moving to London, where he became co-leader with Don Rendell of the Rendell–Carr quintet (1963–69). In its six years, the group (including pianist Michael Garrick, bassist Dave Green, and drummer Trevor Tomkins) made five albums for EMI – all of which have been re-issued – and performed internationally. During the 1960s he also played with the New Jazz Orchestra under the direction of Neil Ardley and recorded an album with altoist Joe Harriott.\n\nAfter leaving the quintet, Carr went on to form the ground-breaking jazz-rock band Nucleus. This led to the release of 12 albums (some under the band's name, some under Carr's), and a successful international career. In their first year Nucleus won first prize at the Montreux Jazz Festival, released their first album, \"Elastic Rock\", and performed at both the Newport Jazz Festival and the Village Gate jazz club. Carr also played with the United Jazz + Rock Ensemble from 1975.\n\nCarr worked as a session musician in non-jazz contexts, with Nico, No-Man, Faultline, and others. He also doubled up on flugelhorn.\n\nApart from writing a regular column for the \"BBC Music Magazine\", Carr wrote biographies of the jazz musicians Keith Jarrett and Miles Davis. He was also the co-author of the reference work \"The Rough Guide to Jazz\", which has passed through four editions from 1994 (originally \"Jazz, The Essential Companion\", 1988). In addition he contributed sleeve notes for the albums of other musicians (e.g. \"Indo-Jazz Fusions\" by Joe Harriott and John Mayer).\n\nIn 1987, he was appointed associate professor at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London, where he taught composition and performance, especially improvisation. He was founder of the jazz workshop at the Interchange arts scheme, where pianist Julian Joseph, among others, was one of his students.\n\nIan Carr died aged 75 on 25 February 2009, having suffered from Alzheimer's disease. A memorial service was held at Golders Green Crematorium in London the following month. In addition to fellow Nucleus member Geoff Castle, speakers at the service included artist Gerald Laing, author, critic and broadcaster Alyn Shipton, Mike Dibb (with whom Carr collaborated on two films on Miles Davis and Keith Jarrett) and Carr's students Julian Joseph, Sara Dillon and Nikki Yeoh.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
